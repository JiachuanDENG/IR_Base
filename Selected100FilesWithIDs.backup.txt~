Great, I love the ipad2. I received my I pad about 3 to 4 months ago. I did not get this item from amazon, I am in high school and my school issued out iPads to 11th and 12th graders. It's a wonderful device, nice browser and it has a very responsive touch screen, not one scratch is on the screen. It has almost a glass feel to the screen, very good quality. It's light, the speaker has good sound. I have heard people complain about the camera quality, honestly I love the camera and I think it's great. I know its not the best quality but I thinks it's fine.

Not my favorite tablet. Bought the 16GB version last week, played with it for a day, and returned it 24 hours later.  I'm not an Apple fanboy as I happily use both Macs and PCs, and feel like there's a place for both.  I have an iPad 2, and understand the strengths and weaknesses of Apple products and tablets in general.  What I wanted to try in the Playbook was a smaller form factor and apps that helped improve productivity.  Here are my impressions:Pros:- build quality is phenomenal.  RIM must be applauded for the device, which has tight build tolerance, high-quality materials, and a nice feel.- The display is likewise terrific.  Bright, clear, high contrast.- Initial setup was painless, and I was up and running in 10 minutes.- Price!  Compared to the Toshiba Thrive or Samsung Galaxy 7.0 Plus, it's hundreds of dollars cheaper.- The web browser is a full-fledged browser.  Unlike the iPad, I can browse the full Wall Street Journal website.  Big thumbs up for this.- GPS worked well.- Audio volume and quality is superior to the iPad.Cons:- Lack of apps!  This is the main reason that I returned it.  No Kindle app?  No easy way to read my own eBooks?  Yes, one can use the Kindle reader through Amazon's website, but that's not doable if you're not in a wifi area.  What if you're on an airplane?  No mail app either?  No calendar app? Similarly, no Pandora app.  Yes, you can use the browser...however...- The web browser kept crashing on me.  Over and over and over.  I restarted the tablet, reset the tablet.  Didn't help.  I found it maddening.  Other apps crashed fairly regularly too (like Spotify), but not as much as the browser.- I'm not sure a 7 inch tablet is a good form factor for web surfing.  It's way easier on a 10 inch tablet.  Duh.  But I found it pretty hard to read the screen - got a headache after a few minutes.  This is probably the downside of having the same website views as on a full-sized computer.- Steve Jobs comment about needing sandpaper to narrow your fingers so they tap the screen effectively seems pretty accurate.- I would have really liked an SD card slot (or even micro-SD).All in all, I'm not sure if the Playbook is better or worse than the Kindle Fire (it's not quite fair to compare it to the iPad, which retails for hundreds of dollars more).  The hardware is superior on the Playbook.  But the lack of usable apps hobbles it.  Maybe the supposed February software update will render it great.  But the update isn't set in stone, and RIM has already pushed it back from summer 2011.  So it's a gamble.  The question is, does the tablet work for me in its current state?  For me, no.Last note - I don't have a Blackberry smartphone.  If I did, and was able to use Blackberry bridge to tether my Playbook and get access to my mail and calendar, many of the weaknesses would be rendered moot.  But at this point, I'd rather buy a tablet to complement my current smartphone, as opposed to buying a smartphone to complement my tablet.

Solid and reliable. One of the most solid pieces of technology that I have ever owned. I don't need apps I use this mainly for games and browsing. No its not perfect, matter of fact far from it but at the price point this was a very smart buy.

AWFUL!!!! This I Pad had porn pictures on it, I could not even use the camera, it would hang up on websites and would not go to most websites. It was AWFUL! I had to pay for the postage to ship it back and I still have not gotten a refund back on my card.

We love it.... We've wanted one for a while... finally bit the bullet.  We bought the one without the phone in it to keep the cost down... but we haven't had any trouble finding plenty of wi-fi hotspots where we could use it.  We can skype or facetime with our family also... really liking it a lot.

Great alternative to regular iPad if you're on a budget. The regular iPad is great, I'm sure, but I wasn't really willing to spend $500+ on a tablet. This was much more affordable, and you get all of the same great features besides the size. Now, I know there are obviously other differences between the two, but coming from someone who isn't super tech savvy... it's basically the same. I love it! The only thing I would say isn't amazing is the sound. Sometimes it's not loud enough when I'm watching Netflix. That's it though! It's great!

AcerIconia Tab review. If you're looking to buy a Windows based tablet this is the one.  Not too heavy and full of features.  THe dock station has ample USB ports to connect a laptop, mouse, or any other USB device.  Works like any other Windows based PC or notebook only in a smaller, portable package.  THe only limit as to what programs can be installed is the size of the internal SSD.  The work around is to attach an SDHC card into the available slot and use that to store data.  My wife uses it for work and she is thrilled with this product.  The touch screen gets a bit getting used to.  Sometimes it can be a bit sensitive.  Comes with WIndows 7 which is not a real touch-pad OS but nevertheless it gets the job done.  If you don't want a Mapple HiPad or an Android based pad this is the way to go.

i'm not a isheep anymore.... First, I hate to admit that I was a iSheep and was worshiping Apple products (iphone, ipad) for three years.Not anymore.I am completely blown off by the Honeycomb + Motorola tablet GUI which provides me with the level of customization that could not be achieved in iPad even with all the help from Cydia or any winterboard.I am completely blown off by the DLNA support that this tablet offers. I could easily transfer all the transfer videos,mp3 directly to this device via uPNP client(DNLA service). I have tonnes of movies in different formats lying in my hard disk connected to desktop shared via dlna and could be easily accessed by Motorola Xoom and it plays every known video format known. I could read every possible known ebook format in Motorola Xoom.I am completely blown off by the quality of Android apps available in the Market and they are comparable and in par with the apps from iTunes. Can you imagine installing Antivirus software in a tablet that scans each and every emails and apps for any potential virus or trojan horse? You can do it in this tablet. Can you imagine running easily 20 to 30 apps in the back ground and still not compromise on the cpu? You can do it here. All the networking apps (vnc, logmein,ssh,....) are available in Android world. The widgets are cool and the level of customization that you can do with these is really great. I am sure that the Android app store will overtake apple app store in a year or two. I think people, who are sick and tired of looking at Apple same old GUI again and again, should start looking at Honeycomb and appreciate the effort that has gone into this.Of course, we easily saw tonnes of bugs in iPad in the early days, but the look and feel of it made us mesmerized and forget all those issues.But, when it comes to Honeycomb, it really makes me laugh after reading the silly reviews that these people post in Amazon.com about the reason why they did not like Motorola Xoom and I really feel sorry these people who don't realize the level of customization, tweaks,... that could be done in this device.After rooting it, I could do a lots of things, like connecting a USB hard disk, Super user rights, side loading, install non android apps, ap*****et, titanium back ups, skype with video,..and the list goes on and on...(I cannot reveal more than this...Join xda-developers for more info...)Hats off to Motorola for making this one of a kind tablet and good luck to all the iSheep's who are still out there reading this review.

Excellent Excellent!!! Was very nervous at first because I have never ordered anything over $50 for Amazon.To my surprise this ipad delivered and exceeded my expectations.After 5 months it works just as good as the day I bought it.I recommend this product to anyone.I am sold on Amazon as the number one online marketplace!!Oh an Amazon Prime is worth it!!

Cracked screen. When I first bought this it was the best I could find. I really did my research! The game play was amazeing, the sound decent... I Absolutly loved it. Perfect laptop replacement. Then came a night when I was significantly let down. I was watching utube videos and there was nothing wrong. Absolutly nothing. When it was time to put my children to bed I set my tablet down on the kitchen counter in its docking station where it sits every time it is not in use, and there it stayed for about 30 minutes. Once my duties were done I went to check my emails before going to bed when I noticed a crack in the screen. Not a small scratch, not an unnoticeable crack, but a a hairline crack from the top left corner to the bottom right. I had done nothing wrong to damage the tablet. I have investigated this issue and there are numerous complaints on numerous web sites, including androids own web site. After three weeks of waiting for them to locatate the tablet that had arrived three days after I sent it in I was told that I would need to pay an extra $200 to fix the issue. So if you have the extra money to dish out everytime the screen decides to break for absolutY no reason this is the tablet for you! Other than that it works great.

The wi-fi. I got one and the wifi doesnt even work!When I first got it I got on the internet, then a little bit later it kept staying " Website shutdown or permently moved" What the heck?!? Google is not shut down or permenitly moved! So i got verizon , my internet people and i told them to check my wifi and thet tested it and they said "Nope ,nothings wrong . Everythings working just fine." So I did not stend almost $200 dollors on nothing

It all works great! I took a gamble after reading the reviews on this  tablet, but everything works great on the one I got!  Watching large video files and surfing the web is great.  Really nice screen for reading ebooks on too!  With amazon backing returns I would say give it a try.  Runs great..

koby tablet. Awful...did a lot of research on this tablet before purchase. Wish I could just send it back.  Would not recommend to anyone.

Best $150 tablet out there. Just bought my Kindle Fire ($199) at Walmart with a $50 gift card for free.  (Walmart has this special running from 2/5 to 2/14).  I am a big amazon fan, I still owned the 1st gen Kindle.  Essentially I got my Kindle Fire for $150 and is worth every penny.  Sure there are tablets out there that are better, but the price is 3 or 4 times more.  Since I am already a Amazon Prime member, I was able to download kids TV shows for my kids FREE.

Stopped working... I had this tablet for less than a month and it stopped working... Now won't  turn on or take a charge. So dissapointing because I loved the tablet... Compact, beautiful screen, made very well and an amazing price for a 64G device... but it's a mystery to me as to what happened because I know that BlackBerry does not make inferior products.

Stable, Solid, Looks Great. My wife loves this little stand.  It holds the iPad2 perfectly in either portrait or landscape mode, and is incredibly stable - no way it is tipping over unless you give it a good hard flip.  It looks awesome as well.  She uses it in her salon, and several customers have asked her for the brand/model and where she got it.  The viewing angle is pretty ideal, and the desk footprint is modest. I can't think of a better solution for holding your iPad/iPad2 in the realm of a non-portable solution.

Mi Iconia died in one year. One year (more or less) of non intensive use and it's dead. I strongly recomend people not to buy such expensive items just for watchin videos or music on the web. You better use a smartphone or buy an Android cheap tablet.I had high hopes on this item because I also have an Acer PDA and it's still alive, I use it as GPS. The PDA has more than six years and still works.Very, very bad experience with this tablet. Can't understand how such an expensive item can die so fast. Now it's just expensive rubbish.Maybe i can sell it to someone who want to recycle the battery or the screen but probably I wont have success.
18,9434,5,1
Excellent purchase. The iPad was just as described--"like new". I couldn't tell that it had been previously used. I was very pleased with the tablet and the extras that came with it. I presented it as a Christmas present and needless to say, the recipient was very grateful and appreciative.

I wanted to like it... ...I really did want to like this tablet. I was so excited when I read about the Wacom pen with pressure sensitivity, and the fact that it ran on Windows 7 so I could install my Photoshop, Zbrush and other painting software without having to switch to Windows 8. I thought I would be able to sketch, draw and paint anywhere!The truth is, I can... but in all honestly, it's difficult enough on this tablet that I don't really feel like it's worth the frustration. When I was doing my research on the tablet, I didn't take into consideration the fact that there aren't any of the buttons that I am accustomed to on my Intuos 4 drawing tablet. I understand that these types of tablets usually rely on the touch input, or at least a stylus, and have no buttons, and I was prepared to deal with that -- I didn't really consider how difficult this would make it to perform all those countless tasks that I need to in photoshop that I usually use the buttons for. While painting, it's difficult to zoom, pan and rotate the canvas, and though rotation is less necessary (since I can just rotate the tablet itself) I still need to be able to pan and zoom a lot so I can get in there and work all those nitty gritty details. And if I use the bluetooth keyboard that comes with the device to input commands, it goes to sleep way too fast, so every time I need to name a layer, undo a brush stroke, or use transformation tools, I had to wait for it to reconnect to the tablet. On top of that, the Wacom driver seems to be constantly overruled by the Windows "Pen and Touch" program (which is difficult to disable, and if you do your touch screen won't work anymore), and the Wacom drivers that you have to download in order for the pressure sensitivity to work seems to freeze or crash way too often.Bottom line... it is a good idea. I really still can't wait for a portable tablet that gives me even half the amount of functionality that my Intuos 4 does. This Asus tablet is close, but just not close enough. I was so excited and I couldn't wait for the tablet to arrive, but now that I've got it and tested it out for a while, I just feel a little disappointed. I guess I'll just have to wait for Wacom to make a portable Cintiq.
20,12771,2,5
Disappointed. I just got the thrive and already it is hanging up when I use the keyboard.  I couldn't even put my name in to register.  Also I'm not sure about security and you have to sign up for just about everything you use.  Visually it is good but some of the features are confusing.I wouldn't recommend it
21,2967,1,4
Terrible. I bought this tablet twice, what a mistake. The first time it worked for 2 weeks and then I was not able to connect to the internet even though I had excellent signal strength on my home wi-fi. So I returned it for an exchange. The second one I got did not work from the get go. Constant busy signals to tech support did not help. When I finally got through they were no help. "Gee it sounds like it is defective"! Duh! Anyway I sent that one back too. I learned my lesson, you definitely get what you pay for. Cheaper is not better.

not all apps work to full screen. This unit is generally an oversized ipod, I was told by many Mac lovers it does so much more, found out for me it doesn't. I will say it works flawlessly, great picture, not all apps work to full screen on it yet. I also own a Samsung galaxy tab 2, which I feel is way better for the money spent.

At this time, there have been issues relating to the way the tablet fires off the IR codes, this IR driver fix is part of Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) OS update. I wish there was a timeline on when Samsung will release this update but unfortunately there is not, this issue is in Samsung's hands. Again, we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you, we want you up and running with Peel as much as you do. We will let you know as soon as this update becomes available.Thanks for your interest in Peel,ThaddeusPeel Support

It's Good. This tablet is pretty durable. I take it almost everywhere and there is not a scratch on the screen. The UI is very fast compared to older android products. My only complaint is once in a while (usually after charging) the touch screen becomes buggy and will not respond to input. There is a very quick and easy fix to this. Rebooting the tablet by holding the power button. The tablet boots faster than any other product I've ever owned (<20 sec).All in all, this tablet is a good buy.

PROBLEMS, PROBLEMS, PROBLEMS. I received this as a Christmas gift and returned it very quickly.(1) GPS does not work and Asus later removed it from the specification.(2) Wifi is very weak on this product. At locations where I would have full signal strength on two netbooks and laptop, I would have 1 bar of signal strength on the TF201.  Browsing websites with alot of graphics is very slow.(3) I experienced many browser lockups.I contacted Asus support and never received a callback. The only support I could find for this product was at forum.XDA-Developers.com where the Asus product manager is providing support intermittently on a case by case basis.  I strongly encourage anyone considering purchase of this product to check out the Asus Transformer Prime discussion on the forum.  Many are having problems more serious than those I experienced.  Someone made a great analogy, it's like buying a $500 pizza with ham, pepperoni, and onions.  When you receive the pizza, the best case scenario is it doesn't have any ham and only 20% of pepperoni and onions.  Some think it is a great product and are fine with no GPS(which I was OK with) and low WIFI(which I wasn't OK with).  I believe the software lockups will eventually be fixed with a software patch, but the wifi limitation looks to be a hardware issue with the aluminum back and since Asus has pulled GPS from the specification, I don't think that will ever be fixed.
27,11716,5,1
Very Satisfied. I have only had the tablet for a few months, I wish I got it sooner.  The product has excellent battery life, excellent productivity apps, fast processor speed to get things done.This is NOT a tablet for kids or a tablet for fun, this is a tablet for working.

32,3665,2,4
Velocity Micro T301 Disappointment. This product is very limited when it comes to the Android operating system. I purchased this product based on a previous FALSE review which Amazon has since removed.I would not recommend this product unless you are looking for pure book reader with some Android applications.You cannot download and install the Android Market but there are other Android LIKE market applications that you can download and use.The touch screen does have some lag in response time but is acceptable.If you are looking for a more user friendly Android based product then I definitely would not recommend this product.

Hp touchpad yay and nays. The HP Touchpad had me a little scared that I wasnt purchasing a quality tablet but after recieving it and playing around on it I would have to say the price I payed for it ($230) was not enough for it so you will get more than you paid for it. It is very responsive to touch I have had NO delay issues and the OS format is perfect. The only real NAYS I have for this product is that unlike the Droid market the App market for the touchpad is still limited. The apps that are on there are good apps though.My second and last issue is no camera flash (but im sure anyone can live with that). Setup is very simple Ive already downloaded about 15 apps and close to 200 songs on this thing and it still has amazing speed. The visual quality it great not pixelated at all and the sound is very crisp. Video chat with Skype went perfectly. Honestly because of the limited amount of apps I would put this tablet running a very very close second to the ipad. Its safe to say Im a fan. BUY THE HP TOUCHPAD NOW!!!!!

Some Tips if your are new to iPad. Our son gave this iPad to my husband as a gift (a complete surprise since it is a pretty expensive gift!).  My husband had just purchased a computer for me as a birthday gift coincidentally, and it had a hard drive failure the 3rd time it booted up.  So we returned it and bought a second iPad 2 for me.  We are completely addicted.  They are so user friendly, work well, and are instant on and off (instead of waiting forever to boot up and shut down like a computer).  We both absolutely love them.You iPad may not have the latest operating system on it since many have been sitting in stores waiting to be sold.  If it has 4.3.5 or older, then you simply can take it to a Verizon store and have them activate it at no charge.  They are an official Apple Store.If you need to update your iPad 2 to the new IOS 5 that is to be released in October 2011, then I have some tips, to possibly prevent a lot of grief. HOWEVER, you can just skip all the rest of the technical part of my review if you pay a small fee to have operating system IOS 5 downloaded onto your new iPad 2 so that it is completely independent of a regular computer and iTunes. This is a huge step that Apple has been developing for awhile now.  I don't know if Verizon will do it for free, but Best Buy will do it for $29.95.  If you go to Verizon, make sure the employee is quite familiar with activating the iPad, etc.  Our local Verizon person acted like she knew, but when I brought it home, it wasn't activated.  That's why I had to go through all this stuff so I could do it on my own computer.The current operating system as of today requires hook up to a computer that has iTunes on it.  The new "IOS 5" is due to come out in the next 10-15 days, between October 10-15, 2011.  Anyone who buys an iPad 2 that already has IOS 5 loaded and, also, anyone who already owns an ipad 2 who updates to this version; will be able to do everything without being dependent upon a computer and iTunes.  Right now, you upload photos, your own music, and download and install updates via your computer using iTunes on a regular computer. You can load these things by emailing to your iPad from your computer where they are stored, but if you have a lot, it is easier to transfer via iTunes on your computer.My review is long and some is very technical.  You can stop here if I've already given you helpful info you wanted to know.  The very next section is about some apps I recommend and then after that is the very technical part that isn't necessary if you don't have a computer or want to take my suggestion and pay to have IOS 5 installed on your iPad.------Before I get on with the heavy-duty technical part that you may or may not want read, let me recommend a few apps that you can purchased inexpensively.  Part of the fun is customizing your iPad with apps that you enjoy or help you with your tasks:1. A free app for the iPad is "Goodreader."  This is a great app.  You can view about any format of a file in this app, even Excel files.  You can also make annotations with various symbols and highlighting that the program offers.  You can also unzip a zip file in Goodreader.  I've never done it, but you can watch a video in that app as well.  It has a great folder and file management system that is easy.  I believe you can even bring in files to your iPad from your computer via wi-fi or ftp.  You can also save a web page for reading off line when you are not near wi-fi, such as on an airplane.  I really like this program.2.  If you like to use Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, you can get these apps, but they are $20 each.  I have two excel spreadsheets that I like to keep up on a daily or weekly basis.  One, for example, are our household expenditures and deposits.  Since Goodreader doesn't let you actually add to a Word document or Excel file, I found a program called "Office 2 HD."  This one is not free.  It is a $6.99 program plus fee and tax, but that is less than you pay for either Word or Excel.  It's pretty easy.  What I did was email to myself my Excel file from my computer.  I opened the email in iPad 2 and clicked on the attached file.  Then I tapped on the little curved arrow that you would tap if you want to reply to or forward an email and it gave me the option of opening the file in either Goodreader or Office 2 HD.  I selected Office 2 HD.  Then I opened that app, opened that file, and tapped the Save button.  The Save button gives you a choice of Save or Save As.  When you want to be able to type in the file, you choose Save As and rename it.  If you don't want to rename the file, than add a "1" to the file name on your computer before you email it to yourself on iPad; and then when you Save As, just delete the 1.  Easy.  Of course, it works differently inserting rows, etc., than a regular spreadsheet of Excel program, so you really do need to refer to their help menu.  I like the program though, because it is inexpensive and lets me keep up edit my favorite already existing spreadsheets.  You can create new ones also, of course.  I haven't used the word processor yet, but it is probably even easier than a spreadsheet.  Oh, it has a Power Point type program in it also.3.  Right now the default Safari brower on the iPad isn't very good.  I'm very spoiled to using tabs so I can open search listings in a new tab without losing my search page or use the tabs to go back and forth comparing info on two or three different web pages.  The new IOS 5 is giving Safari tabs.  However, I really like "Web Perfect Browser" which is only $3.99 plus fee and tax.  Not only does it provide a tab system for browsing, but will also save web pages for offline reading.  I save a web page in the Browser if it is something I want to read later, but not necessarily save.  I save a web page in Goodreader, if I want to keep it for reference.  I don't know all the changes they are going to make in Safari.  You might go ahead and check it all out before buying Web Perfect Browser in case it is good enough for your purposes.4.  A great picture organizer program is "Photo Mgr Pro."  Once again, the new IOS 5 is making big improvements on the default photo.  Perhaps you won't even need this app.  The current default Photo app is terrible.  You cannot put them in the order you want.  As far as I know, the only way to create Albums (folders) is to arrange the folders you want in a special iPad folder on your computer first and then upload the special folder and its contents to the iPad through iTunes.  You still can't arrange the order, however.  I know they have made improvements in the new operating system; but if you don't like it, try the Photo Mgr Pro.  It's good.By the way, the final price of an app varies because some are Apple apps and some are 3rd-Party developers.  The developers do get a fee from each purchase.  All apps have tax added.  I'm not sure how this works, but I do notice that the difference between the app purchase price and the final price is not always the same percentage.  However, apps are so reasonably priced, it just isn't that important.  Just know that when it says $3.99, it actually will be a little more.---------THE TECHNICAL PART OF MY REVIEW REGARDING PROBLEMS UPDATING OR INSTALLING ITUNES:It isn't a big deal using your computer and iTunes (if you have a computer) unless you have the following problems that I ran into.  Here are a couple of solutions below.DON'T LET MY INSTRUCTIONS SCARE YOU.  REMEMBER, you can just have IOS 5 put on it after its released, and you don't have to deal with any of this. By the way, if you don't have a computer, you can take the iPad to a Verizon store to activate it. They don't charge for it since they are contracted by Apple. Best Buy may also do it for a small fee when you don't buy it there.  Best Buy will also download and install updates for you for $29.95, so wait until the new IOS 5.0 is released and have them put that one on it.  That eliminates the computer and iTunes problem since you will be able update and download from the iPad. (I'm repeating, but knowing how to do this with ease and avoiding the problems is valuable to know.)Now back to the iTunes problem.  NOTE:  My instructions are for a PC with XP. It is possible you won't be able to install the latest version of iTunes.  You need a version later than the 9.0 and above series.  It must start with a 10.0 or later for it to be connected to your ipad.  I use version 10.4.1.  I discovered that since I apparently had some previous version of iTunes and/or Quick Time on my computer, it left behind some kind of language.  Therefore, after I downloaded itunes version 10.4.1 and attempted to install it; it appeared to install, but wouldn't open.  An error message appeared saying there were missing files.  After spending 3 days researching off and on for the solution and trying to reinstall etc., I finally found a document on the Internet stating exactly what to remove and how to do it. INSTRUCTIONS: From the PC via Add and Remove Programs in the Control Panel remove iTunes.  Then you remove Apple Application Support.  You don't have to uninstall Quick Time.  Then you close and reboot.  Don't open any programs, but do shutdown firewall and anti-virus programs and turn off your DSL/broadband.  Now you can go to your iTunes install file you saved and install it. Now it will work, or it may say something about Mobile Device Service not started. If so, open Control Panel again and open Administrative Tools.  Open the "Services" folder. Click ONCE on Apple Mobile Device folder.  To the left of the file, it says "Stop the Service" and "Start the Service."  Click on "Stop the Service" and then click on "Start the Service."  I can't remember if you reboot again, but it will tell you. After this, iTunes, should work just fine unless some other cause is creating your problem.NEXT PROBLEM that many people are having is that iTunes will perform all the functions for your iPad except it won't download an OS (Operating System) Update.  It will act like it's downloading, but eventually times out.  I have a solution, but you can confirm that your problem is the same as mine by doing the following:  Open iTunes and click on Help on the menu.  Select "Run Diagnostics".  Uncheck everything except the first line to do a Connectivity Test. Make sure your DSL or wi-fi is connected. Click Next. Click Next again and it will list test results.  The first two lines will have green dots, meaning ok.  The third line will be red, "Secure Link to iTunes Store Failed."  What is peculiar about this is that I can purchase an app through the store, but can't download an update.  The problem is somewhere in conflicting language or programs.  After 3 more days of trying to fix, it I finally found a webpage that lists direct links to Apple and instructions.  You choose your particular kind of iPad; for example, iPad 2 wi-fi only.  Then you download the file and save it to a folder where you won't forget where it is.  Be aware that is is a 690 MG file!  It takes hours to download.  I have DSL "light" which means it is slower than regular hi-speed, so it took my file 8 hours to download. Make sure your Power settings say never so the computer won't sleep during the download.  It's ok if your monitor sleeps or the desk top activates a screen saver. By the way, I also was not able to download it on my computer than has iTunes.  I had to use my very old computer that has never had iTunes on it.  My itunes computer blocked downloads even directly from Apple!  If you don't have another computer, use someone else's computer that doesn't have iTunes. OR just wait for IOS 5 (release in Oct. 2011) and pay Best Buy $29.95 to download it and install! After downloading it, I put it on a flash drive and transferred it to my other computer that has iTunes.  Next, plug in iPad to your computer via the cable included; do this BEFORE opening iTunes.  If you haven't already activated your new iPad 2, then you will be activating it now through iTunes.  Once it is activated, you are ready to install the update you downloaded, which will IOS 5 after it released. iTunes may pop up a window that asks if you want to download the update.  Press Cancel.  If it is set up to automatically download it, press the X next to the field at the top where it is showing that is is downloading.  That will stop it.  NOW, since your iTunes will not work for downloading if you have the same connectivity issue that I do, you will HOLD DOWN your shift key WHILE you press the UPDATE button.  You will only see the UPDATE button if you plugged in your ipad first to your computer and then open iTunes.  A menu just for your iPad will appear across the middle of the screen and the Update button is on the Summary tab.  After you hold down the shift key while clicking on Update, it will pop up a screen allowing you to find your downloaded file.  If you computer downloaded it as a ZIP file, you'll have to unzip it first and then choose the file.  iTunes will now update your iPad with the new update.  It takes about 10 min or less.  By the way, I have Opera browser on my old computer and discovered that it doesn't force a zip file as some browsers do.  It will download the file as it actually comes with the correct file extension.Hope this review doesn't scare you off.  Remember!  You don't have to deal with any of these problems if you pay a store that is set up for iPads to download the new IOS 5 operating system which makes iPad completely independent of a separate computer and iTunes.  Again, I don't know what Verizon would charge, but $29.95 is pretty good at Best Buy.  Call first to make sure the stores near you will do it.Have fun with Ipad 2.  It's great!  I'm quite advanced on PC's as I used them for the last 15 years for my jobs.  Now I'm retired, and the Ipad 2 is just great fun and new Apps to let you customize it for your own interests are very reasonable.

NOT AS ADVERTISED!!! When I ordered the iPad, it was listed "Brand New." The plastic cover & the iPad logo stickers were all missing! All indicators that this is NOT A BRAND NEW IPAD.

apple iPad. When I purchased my new Apple iPad I was not sure what to expect, the instructions were not easy nor did I find that the iPad worth the $600.00 dollars.  I am still using my labtop which I find to be user freindly. Maybe I am not use to using an Apple product.After a month I am not sure if I made a wise purchase.
39,4530,5,1
Great value. I love it. Great value. Perfect for my family. I am not afraid to let the kids play with it. It was affordable so everyone can enjoy it. I have had no problems with it. I surf the web play games and do my bill pay and banking. lightweight and perfect for travel.

And now for something completely different... It's seldom that I review something that isn't absolutely hassle free and still give the product five stars. The Sony Tablet S is one exception. Let me break by discussing the primary drawback, and then I'll tell you what this tablet does right.The one issue that really bothers me is the lack of an OTG ( on the go)  cable being included with the tablet. Why is this important? For the same reason Sony touts a major feature of the tablet, which is native support for a wireless ps3 dual shock controller. What they don't tell you, and believe me, I had to do a lot of research to uncover this, is that you have to have a micro A USB cable to hook one up for the initial pairing of the controller to the device. No special cable, no controller. Sony  could have easily thrown in the proper cable adapter for this, which would have cost them a couple dollars at most, but they decided to charge extra and make you buy the cable from them. Micro A USB cables are next to impossible to find. Search Amazon and you'll see. You CAN use a standard micro B cable for transferring files between the tablet and PC, but again, no cable is included. Micro b USB cables are easy to find, however. You probably have many around your house if you have cell phones, kindles, etc.Other than that, Sony did a LOT of things right with this. The True Black feature really does make a difference. Pairing this feature with an IPS display gives deep, rich visuals that you simply won't see on other tablets.The wedge design is fabulous. It's brilliant in that it not only looks unique, but is totally  satisfying from an ergonomics standpoint. It feels good to hold, and is much easier to carry around without fearing that the tablet might slip from your grasp.Any problems with wifi, gps, or other issues mentioned have been virtually eliminated with software updates. I'm getting solid performance and reliability all the way round with this tablet.I think the biggest compliment I can give the Sony tablet S is that it has replaced my iPad 2 as my favorite tablet. It does everything the iPad 2 does and more. I couldn't be more pleased. It's sleek, stylish, and is a solid performer.

I like my Ipad. I really like the first generation Ipad but I wished it had a camera. But overall like it and I'm having fun with it,

Okay but not a good computer. I first got this ipad 2 because my computer broke. It functions well and I like it, but not as a computer. If you want a computer, get a computer, not an ipad. If you want to use the ipad for reading or playing apps or even watching movies, then this would work great for you. You can listen to music through it but it is so bulky I don't see how you are supposed to do so in comfort. It would have to be sitting next to you and you can't really carry it around and do stuff. If you want to listen to music get an ipod. The ipad is also very durible. I have dropped it many times and nothing is wrong with it. Thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope it helped you.

Very Handy! I don't need the latest and greatest technological advancements, so I opted to get the first generation Ipad.  I was a little weary of the fact that it didn't have Adobe Flash, because the main reason I got this was to have a lightweight device to surf the web.  But come to find out it wasn't that big of a deal. It's got amazing graphics and a long battery life - so I can surf for quite awhile without worrying about charging it all the time. Nice!
44,15999,2,5
Cute but bulky. It's new, it's cute but it is also bulky and I don't see it replacing the ipad especially not at the price of $600+.

Worst POS ever. Yep I got this thing as my first introduction to tablet computing and it basically sucks. My iPhone is like 1000% FASTER. It is sooo dang slow it's like trying to load the internet on a 486 computer from 1995, over dial up. I'm thinking of lighting it on fire but I don't think that's environmentally responsible to I will probably sell it on ebay for like $1 plus shipping. The only thing this could possibly be good for is maybe book reading from Amazaon. Oh did I mention you can't use the google app down loader? Only the the Amazon one will work and it takes a little effort to get that installed even. If there was a 1/2 star I would pick that this thing is so bad. $109 down the drain and lesson learned I guess. Save up and buy the cheapest iPad don't make the same mistake I made.

Everything I wanted. The Kindle Fire does everything I want it do and everything it is supposed to do as advertised.  I don't qualify my comments with "for the price."  I use it for movies, e-mailing, weather, calendar, and a host of other available apps.  It is the ideal size as I wear cargo pants frequently and it fits directly into a cargo-pant pocket.  The touchscreen works very well, the colors are excellent, the respnses rapid, and the battery last as long as Amazon says it does on and off the web.My wife has an iPadii and I got a better deal "for the price" than she did.I like it a lot.

I love it! Bought this little guy a few weeks ago at a local retailer.  Mainly I bought it to take with me on vacation, but I have found that I am also using it elsewhere on a pretty regular basis.  I take it to the gym to watch videos, I play games and check email at home, I bring it to meetings at work, etc.  I haven't used it as an e-reader yet, or for Skype, but it sounds like it would work for that too.  It's very versatile, and takes up less space than a larger tablet/iPad would (not to mention a lot less expensive).  Side-loading apps, videos, music, ROMS, etc. is easy, just connect to computer and it shows up as 3 USB drives (one for 8GB internal storage, one for the Micro SD card, and another for something else... not sure what).  The screen is great for videos, but for everything else it is just so-so, and it is horrible in direct sunlight.  A Micro SD card is highly recommended for throwing videos on it, and I also recommend side-loading moboplayer to be able to watch .mkv files.Pros: - Bare-bones (vanilla) Android 4 - UI and capacitive touch is fast and fluid - HDMI output works great... very convenient for hotels (need a Mini-HDMI to HDMI cable or adapter) - 2 charging methods (Mini-USB and barrel-type power cable) - convenient for if you want to charge it and use a USB keyboard at the same time - Mail app works great with Yahoo! mail and Microsoft ExchangeCons: - No Google Play - No Bluetooth - Battery life isn't great - Web browser takes a while to load pages... probably because of the CPU - Not really fast enough for console emulators (SNES, N64, PSX)

The product was literally new. I bought several things on the web, things that were considered "NEW" and actually they weren't.This time everything changed, the product was literally new, no use at all and I saved a lot of money.I've been a long term Apple customer and will be forever.

iPad. Well, I just received an iPad as a present. Initially, I wanted to return it for a refund and get the Kindle, but it sounds like my wife may want the iPad. So, I decided to open it up and play with it and possibly get the Kindle for myself. I will have to wait until I get home however, because you cannot use the iPad without first connecting it to a desktop/laptop and going to iTunes. This further reinforces my desire for a Kindle over the iPad. I do not like iTunes and its many restrictions to begin with, and the only reason I wanted something like this was to read books. Something it appears the Kindle excels at.The iPad weighs nearly 1 pound more than the small version of Kindle which I am interested in (this makes a difference when I go backpacking); has a backlit LCD display which will fatigue my eyes (although this would be nice to read in the dark with); needs an available wi-fi to have functionality on the go (which is an additional charge in many places); runs through batteries in a fraction of the time; and basically has a lot of neat features, but features that I will rarely use once I check them out and when I would use them, I am already near a desktop/laptop that has them.On the other hand, Kindle is light, has a long battery life, is easy on the eyes, and connects free to cellular networks when needed. Amazon, you have it right. Keep Kindle a reader and only add features that support and enhance reading, and you will have no worries in "competing" with iPad.This is a bit like comparing a pen and paper to a computer. They are two totally different things that have something in common, but neither is better than the other in general. The Kindle is designed for a specific use and seems to do that well. While the iPad is confused about whether it is a notebook/ereader/desktop. What's funny, while the iPad tries to make itself the everything device, it fails to include a camera. Even my cell phone has that. Oh well, I guess I'll have a small device to take on vacations and road trips with me to watch movies and check the web, but it will not substitute for an ereader.

An awesome gift. First off, the shipping and packaging were hands down amazing. Then once unpacked the Kindle fire was ready to blaze on as the greatest technological gift I have ever given! The lighted full color, full touch screen, burned on into the night. Awesomely fast wifi speeds made me think that it was powered by 1,000,000,000 jiggawatts! Again greatest gift I have ever given, that wasn't built by my own hands.

best windows laptop and slate out there. After long wait, I got this 2 days back. Overall great buy. By the way I have ipad2 too and i love that too.i needed something to replace my laptop but preferrably with touch interface and it does the job. Fast enough to use for micrsoft office, browsing, photo, vidoes etc.microsoft notes is just awsome esp. take notes draw picture etc.  however if you take your laptop to work, buy asus usb docking statioon for lan, vga and other ports.reason i gave 4 and not 5 stars is that for it to work fully well, i have to carry keyboard, mouse, dock which i dont like but not sure either about the alternatives

Great product and GREAT vendor. The iPad is an amazing product. I ordered this iPad 2 from Karen Electronics through Amazon.  I got to use my Amazon gift cards toward my purchase. I ordered around 11:00 am and was notified that the iPad had shipped about 2:00. I received the iPad today. 24 hours after it was shipped. Great service. I also saved $50 on my purchase by getting the white iPad instead of the black one. Very positive experience and I love my iPad,

Great Tablet for the Price. Very fast web browsing. Much better than Kindle Fire. Has real Amazon Kindle Ap. You can't beat it for the price.Don't order The ViewSonic ViewPad 7, 7 Inch Android Tablet Folio Leather Case - Black , it is junk and doesn't fit.

The Most Successful Consumer Product of All-Time---For a Reason! iPad 1 Owners- this is well worth the upgrade. iPad 2 Owners, you can stay the course with what you have. Its not like people were in the streets up in arms about the iPad2 screen quality, its amazing. The iPad1 & 2 are still the 2nd and 3rd best tablets---for performance and value---on the market.My 3 year old jammed the business side of a fork into my iPad2 USB port (effectively ending my relationship with my home button) about 2 months before the 3 was released....so....I knew I'd be getting this.I use the iPad all day. It dies on me everyday. Let's cover just a few items for what and why:1. I use it all day, everyday. If I'm not sending an email, browsing or reading the news (flipboard will change your world) then its in my office on my desk playing a CNBC or Fox News etc. video. This isn't the X brand tablet that will sit and sit like so many others.......2. Yes, its for consuming content. 90% of what I do is consume text/video/game with this device. Its replaced my newspaper and all of mags but I prefer my ol' black and white Kindle for long form reading. This is the greatest screen ever made ---but its bright. And that can be a hinderance for long reading session. And it flat out sucks to use outside i.e. poolside or at the beach etc. If you want a reader, this isn't for you. I would highly recommend the black and white Kindle. Yes, it has the iWork suite and I do use this for work occasionally but I have to be honest and reluctantly admit until Office is available this kind of work will be limited on the tablet.3. 3.4 million pixels. Yes, its the greatest screen ever made. People complained that Apple focused too much on this SUBSTANTIAL improvement and not something else but they are shortsighted. The entire device IS the screen, its the most intimate and prominent  feature. Therefore drastic improvement to this elemental piece means something. Its that good.WhyThis isn't going to replace the laptop or the desktop. Its not an iPhone. In terms of taking away time spent on the desktop and laptop---YES, people will spend less time on those devices then they otherwise would. But, again, for long form spreadsheets, letters or long emails, media editing etc.---the iMac or whatever desktop/laptop you use will still be choice. Tablet computing in this format is a 'new' form factor for most, and its amazing. You are holding the web. Games and magazines are beautiful. The iPad isn't going anywhere. In terms of a tablet purchase no one else is even close.

Nice Little Pad. I purchased this pad on a whim and was pleasently supprised by how well it worked. My only complaint was the 16x9 screen dimensions.  After using it for a week I decided to return it for that reason. I am going to wait for the 8" Coby that has a 4x3 display with 800x600 resolution. Web surfing with less than 800x600 resolution was too much of a compromise in my opinion. I have learned to deal with that on phones, but they have to be small to fit in your pocket.  Otherwise this product was much better than I expected for such an inexpensive product.  I see a lot of tablets for sale with that same screen format, but for me you had to scroll around too much to be able to see a full web page.  I used an Ipad for a day, it was very nice and had the 4x3 screen format but was over the top on price for what really amounts to a toy for most folks.  Hope this helps someone make a decision.

Great potential to be an amazing tablet... I purchased the Blackberry Playbook over Black Friday (2011) weekend after recently returning Amazon's Kindle Fire.  I wanted a device more portable then my iPad that would provide both entertainment and functionality.  After watching/reading several reviews on the Blackberry Playbook, I was super stoked to receive mine!Unfortunately, that enthusiasm didn't last very long.  I quickly discovered how, um, blah the device was.  RIM did an amazing job with the QNX operating system; it's super faster, beautiful, and an absolute pleasure to use.  With that being said, the lack of app. support in the Blackberry community has left this device struggling to find its place among smart phones and the iPad.Without apps., you basically have a device with a camera that can play movies.  Sure, there's the internet and such.  But it's a WiFi only device (unless you have a Blackberry smartphone to bridge).  If you find yourself out of range of a hotspot, there's nothing left to do except watch movies/listen to music.I suppose you could read a book.  But wait!  There's no Kindle app.  Instead, you have a Kodo application in which you're expected to repurchase your library.Sigh.  I'm really disappointed with this device.  It has such great potential if the community would get behind it and support it.  To be honest, I don't see that happening.  With Apple's IOS dominating the majority of the tablet world and Google's Android sucking up what's left over, I don't see much room for a new "competitor".So to break it down, here's my Pros & Cons list.Pros:-Beautiful Design-Portable-Great camera (can record in 1080HD)-Beautiful and fast operating systemCons:-Lack of app. selection-No Netflix app. and the Playbook's browser isn't supported by their online streaming service-No Skype-No Zinio-No "good" eBook reader-No native email or calendar app. on the device (they include web shortcuts to Gmail, Hotmail, etc.)As you can see, the majority of the cons are due to a lack of app. support from developers.  Until there's more support for this device, you're stuck with a 7" internet browsing/movie watching device.  And if that's what you want, just get an iPad; bigger screen, more enjoyable experience.  And as I said earlier, if you're out of range of a WiFi hotspot, you're pretty much SOL.Overall, I rate the device's design, operating system, and smoothness a 5/5.  But with its lack of apps., the functionality and capability of this device is a 2/5.  :(

WIFI Not Quite Up To Speed. I am always looking for a cool, well designed gadget that provides information and entertainment at a low price.This device looked promising when I first spotted it on Amazon, so I ordered it.The good news: It does everything it says but the wifi is so S...L...O...W, trying to load all the freaking advertising and video clips that fills todays web pages. Because of its small size the wifi receiver and processor are not powerful enough to get the job done so that even next to the modem, the loading process often grinds to a halt. I had to repeatedly reboot the unit when it bogged down and stalled on a page that it couldn't finish loading. The load on the battery also tends to drain it quickly in WIFI mode.I loved the look and feel of this little pocket gem but the wifi needs more speed.Good try.

Quality iPad for Business or Personal Use. Got the iPad3 with Retina display and overall, very pleased. I have it linked with Google Drive and now can work on documents while on the go which is great. Also great for watching movies via Netflix or Amazon Instant Video. Also works great using AirPlay for streaming to speakers elsewhere in the house. While it is true that you will find other products for a cheaper price the truth is that the iPad (like most Apple products), just work. I've had various Android Tablets and phones and while I did enjoy them, they really do not compare with the functionality of the Ipad. I got the original iPad and had it for more than 2 years and the only reason I returned it is because I could sell it back to Amazon for a substantially higher price than anyone else would take it for, and it went right to my new purchase, smooth and easy.

Decent tablet for power users or media junkies. I couldn't help but pick up this tablet at that price for a 64GB unit. How could I resist? Well, I went ahead and bought it and I do like and dislike a few things about it.I really love the hardware quality of this tablet. It feels so whole and sturdy. This is the first BlackBerry device I've ever used, and I can see why they have such a loyal fanbase even in this day and age when Google, Apple, and Microsoft are eating away at their market share. I especially love the play/pause button on top of the tablet. That's quite useful. The matte finish on the back of the unit really gets me, because I love matte finishes on high quality devices. It certainly does not feel cheap, either. This is a well-put together tablet, and BlackBerry is even nice enough to include a neoprene sleeve with your PlayBook to give it basic protection.I was a little surprised at the lack of buttons for functions like forward or home, but I got used to the gestures rather quickly. They make a lot of sense, or at least for the most part (swiping from the bottom upward to close the app drawer is the only gesture that makes no sense to me, because swiping from the top down when the app drawer is open only opens the (very useful) settings drawer).The built-in apps are polished and well-made. Browser is very reliable, as well as the onboard camera, file manager, picture browser, video player, and more. It also does a wonderful job with my calendar sync and it syncs my contacts and emails quite well. Standby battery life is also very excellent. I had it sitting in my messenger bag for the past 8 hours and it still has 92% battery left from light use. The built-in keyboard is quite nice and makes a very nice, loud, satisfying tap sound when you press a key. When you type in certain apps or in the browser, the keyboard opens up this prediction system that reminds me of SwiftKey on Android, which is also rather nice.The built-in storage amount is by far the best feature of this tablet to me. So much space for so many videos, songs, and pictures. It's wonderful. You can go crazy with 64GB of storage. I have several videos in the .wmv format inside of it right now, but there's definitely more space available, and other supported formats. You could also use that space for games, which BlackBerry World seems to have no shortage of, as far as I can tell.Now, there are a few things I dislike about the item, but that doesn't necessarily mean I don't like the item as a whole.First of all, the app selection is awful and even non-existent to some degree. A lot of big names are completely absent on this platform for some reason. No official Dropbox, Netflix, Springpad, Kindle, nook, Pandora, Feedly, and a whole lot of other apps are missing. On a platform like Windows 8 or Windows Phone 8, whenever there's no official app, there's at least a very good third party app that is good enough or even better. That is not the case on the BlackBerry Playbook. If there's no app, chances are you have a questionable third-party app that actually costs money and has bad reviews, or nothing at all. You can sideload .bar files, but judging by the ported apps I've tried, they barely work or are poorly optimized for the PlayBook. It makes me wish people other than just game developers had given the PlayBook more of a chance. The hardware is definitely nice, but the software support from third parties was definitely not there.I also own a Nexus 7, and the app selection on the PlayBook (unfortunately) pales in comparison. I think that's a shame as well, because I like the look and feel of the PlayBook's hardware more. I don't play a lot of games, either, but it seems like the apps that are most plentiful on the PlayBook (or just about any tablet) are the games. There's even a few preinstalled on the PlayBook, like Tetris or Need For Speed, in case you want to get used to the UI on it.I'm not a fan of the security on the tablet, either. I'm not talking about stuff like viruses or any of that. No, BlackBerry's very much on the ball when it comes to that kind of security. The security I'm talking about is locking the tablet. If you have a Nexus 7, iPad, or just about any other device, you can set up a convenient and rather easy way to unlock the device so that only the owner or those who know the password/pin/pattern can get access. Well, if you only like password lock screens, then you will have no problem at all with the PlayBook. This is the only way to lock the device, to my knowledge. I looked around in the settings and can't find anything else. Instead of being able to quickly press a few numbers, or draw out a pattern, I have to use the entire keyboard and type something out, and after that, reach for the "OK" or "Enter" key. You can just use a pin for the password, but it's still more effort than it needs to be. I wish this required a bit less effort, although it's not a deal killer for me. It's partly a problem because this is a tablet instead of a smartphone, so the screen is bigger and takes more effort to type a simple password on.Lastly, some of the UI is a bit counter-intuitive to me, or at least at first. This is my first BlackBerry device, and I am willing to admit if I just found it counter-intuitive because I'm unfamiliar with BlackBerry's UI standards. It took me a while to figure out how to set a wallpaper for the tablet. I kept searching the settings thinking it had to be close, until a Google search showed me I had to go to the pictures app and do it from there. Also, it seems like to get settings on any app, you need to swipe from the top down, which isn't too obvious unless you've used the tablet for a long time or just already know what to expect.Although this tablet has shortcomings and is aging a bit, it is still an unbeatable value for its storage and out-of-box media capabilities. Good luck finding a new 64GB tablet at that price. I store tons of video on mine and use it primarily as a dedicated media tablet. For media playback and capabilities, this tablet is more than adequate for the job. Just don't count on using too many apps. If you want to watch videos, play music, or look at pictures on the go, and you want a lot of storage to do so, go for the PlayBook. You won't be disappointed you did.EDIT: I've been using it a bit more lately with sideloaded apps I've put into the tablet myself. Some of these are a bit wonky to get working (older versions, free apps only, etc.), but some of them do work great or good enough. RetroArch works perfectly on the PlayBook (to my knowledge, I haven't actually opened up a ROM in it), and the Dropbox app I sideloaded as a .bar file works fine, too. But the strangest thing is that you probably need to sideload apps to get quality compared to the ported apps on BlackBerry World. For example, I use Electro Droid on my Android devices, and there's an app called Electro Tools in BlackBerry World that looks like a ported app. The ported app in BBW is terrible and barely works at all, but if you sideload Electro Droid as a .bar file, it works perfectly.Sadly, you can't sideload everything on this tablet. I've tried sideloading SpringPad twice already, but it doesn't even show up on my apps list. Still, your results may vary on this, but it's quite capable on running sideload apps. I partly wish that sideloading didn't require setting a password on this tablet (a password is required for using the tablet in development mode, which you need to sideload anything).

Kindle Fire Rules! I gave this five stars, because I have wanted a kindle since the first one came out however I am very happy that I waited for the fire. Here are my evaluations: Setup: I got this as a Christmas gift, and it was very easy to set up, I had to "de" register my mom (She bought it on her profile) which was not hard I signed her out and setup my profile/email. I received an email verifying it. Books/Graphic Novels: I was determined to buy this myself; however I ended up getting surprised with it for Christmas so I had four books in my wish list I wanted on my kindle fire. The first one I got I read straight through. I loved the fact you could make the font bigger or smaller and change the color of the page; I changed it to the manila color. After I sped through the first book I bought, I moved on to a comic book I had bought. I was pleasantly surprised you could zoom in panel to panel to read it. The only thing I have a complaint about is using the dictionary that comes with the kindle you can't search for the word you can type in a word but it won't give you the definition. Here's an example, you type in clock it will bring up wherever the word clock is used in a definition but not the actual definition. The Cloud: I had actually used the cloud before I got the kindle so I knew how it worked and how much space was on it, however I was shocked to see how fast the response time is when you put something on the cloud from your computer (like music) to when you see it on your kindle. Music: Many people have been comparing this to the Ipad? I am not sure if they did this to the new nook tablet or if they are just signaling out the kindle fire. The reason I brought this up is because there have been comments about Amazon wanting you to only use music you buy from them blah blah blah, that's not really the case yes you can't transfer music from iTunes to the cloud however you can transfer music from ITunes to your computers media player and then up load it to the cloud. Issue resolved. Video: I have yet to watch a movie on the kindle fire, but I believe it would be enjoyable. I have watched TV shows on the fire, I had some I had downloaded before I got the fire on my cloud (Missed TV episodes) that I watched on my computer and then on the fire; besides the obvious size issue of computer monitors to the fire I enjoyed watching it. I actually bought a season pass to a TV show so all the episodes go straight into my fire. As far as trying to watch them holding the fire I don't think that would work, I have a case that can be stood up sideways so I can watch my TV shows. Back to the I pad comparison the videos I've bought on ITunes can't be put on the fire, at least I haven't figured out a way, but I don't want to pay $1000 for an  Ipad and Ipad accessories so this is a pleasant alternative. Newsstand: I have yet to buy a newspaper/magazine, I've browsed through the choices and I haven't found any I can't live without. Free Trial Membership to Amazon Prime: The Products I bought from Amazon did not have a faster shipping time it was normal to me. I did however consider renewing the membership because I was able to stream TV shows for free and of course the Lending library where you can "borrow" kindle books. But as I read through the terms and conditions Amazon put in they have the right to take out those services so I couldn't bring myself to pay $75 for a service that "may" be taken away in the future. Apps that come with the kindle: I don't know what a lot of the apps that come with fire are, like Pandora, Pulse, and Audible. I did find the other apps helpful, when I uploaded my email all my contacts got put in the contacts app; I didn't have to do it. The Facebook app is awesome, just an easy way to get on FB. I wish twitter had an app like FB though. Other Apps: Notable apps that I use every day: 1.) PG Calculator: easy to use and it was free. 2.) Roller Lite: Basically its skee ball, so much fun! 3.) Words with friends: I never played this on FB but I love it on the Fire. 4.) Bubble Wrap: I got this because I thought it would get a laugh out of the kids, it's CRAZY how much the kids love this. 5.) Comics App: I wasn't sure I'd like this app only because I prefer normal comics to digital. I was wrong, this app rules! There's an option to either have to go to the full page after you read it or before you read it so you can observe the art. I opted for before but found myself going back after I read it. 6.) Photo Gallery: This is one that came with the fire, but I waited to do it down here, because you don't get a cord to connect to you computer, you have to buy one separately. 7.) Quick office: Right now all I have is the free one, but I am planning on getting the one that costs $14.99. This app is amazing! I'm a writer so to have an app that can read your document to you is very helpful. Docs: This section of the kindle fire is used for reading documents; you can't fix them if there's a mis-spelled word. Amazon gives you a kindle email, usually it's just the first part of your current email, it is a really neat way for Amazon to use the kindle/cloud. The only thing that bugged me was that I used it once and the doc went straight to my kindle. I did not like this option.Overall: I love the kindle fire! I would not trade it for an Ipad. I would and have recommended this many friends and family.  Thanks for reading.

It's as good as having a laptop. I love my little tablet. I use it everyday, at home, at work.  Works great. Best purchase I have made.

I love this tablet! I love this tablet! This was one of the best investments I have ever made. I take it every where, even on my scooter. Though I am not yet using the Verizon connection yet, the WiFi is strong and this tablet finds signals easily. I couldn't ask for more. It is Android based so I can get apps from both the Google play store and from Amazon's site.

My first tablet. I received the basic Nook as a Christmas gift. Never really wanted a reader or tablet. I'm an old-fashioned book kinda gal. But, when my daughter and I decided to make a trip to Spain, I returned the Nook reader and decided to upgrade to the HD so that I could travel with a tablet that would enable me to check email, surf the web, and read books and magazines. I'm just learning to use it but so far I think I'm really going to enjoy having this tablet. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because it didn't come with a manual (I did say I was an old-fashioned book kinda gal). Would highly recommend the Nook HD for your entry into the world of tablets and readers!

Attention 24-bit audiophiles... If you are an audiophile who collects 24-bit music, and are chained to your desktop at home to listen to it on your high-end headphones, this is a great portable solution.  This tablet contains a high-def audio system, so you can set it to 24-bit, 192kHz and enjoy all your studio-quality music with your headphones.  I have this tablet paired with a Headroom Airhead portable amp and my Sennheiser HD 650 headphones (I didn't spring for an 800 model yet) and the setup is great for when you're mobile!  There are very few portable solutions for 24-bit audiophiles, and this is probably the best solution.  You can leave your 24-bit files in its original FLAC format and play it back at full quality.There is 32GB of onboard memory, which a small portion will be used for the Windows 7 that comes installed on it, but the rest is free.  An SD memory card slot, along with 2 USB ports are available.  I have a 32GB SD card, and at this point, if your wallet allows, you can spring for a 128GB card.  With 2 USB ports, you could have a total of 3 SD cards running (with additional SD card readers in those USB ports) or just carry your music on a portable hard drive and plug it in.This is just a heads-up for 24-bit audio enthusiasts.  I'm not too keen on HiFiMan's portable players, as they seem to downsample the music to 16-bit.  I don't like iPods and while the Cypher Labs audio module for the iPod may be great, the module costs more than this tablet.  Aside from this tablet, my only option for high-def audio would be a Sony M10 digital recorder, which has a memory card slot and uses AA (or was it AAA) rechargeable batteries, but all my music would have to be converted to WAV for use on the player.  This tablet forgoes the conversion and allows more memory cards to be used.  It's bigger.  But this shouldn't be a problem if you're a serious, sit-down-and-listen kind of audiophile.a BIG recommendation for audio fanatics!

Amazon and Kindle Fire Exceeds expectations. I have been interested in obtaining a device for some time primarily for reading.  My wife has an IPAD and I have an iPhone, both with Kindle software on them.  The IPAD is a bit heavy, and the iphone's screen is to small. So do I wait for Apple to come out with a smaller version of the IPAD or buy an e-reader?  Sure it would be nice to have one single device to do all the functions I need, but seriously, I like my iPhone for the purposes it services, but it is not a great reader.  I purchased my first Kindle (Keyboard) for my mom this past Christmas.  I liked the functionality, but for me, I did not really like the black and white screen.  I wanted a similar reading device that had color and some multimedia capabilities.I ordered my Kindle online from the Amazon store. I tried Prime a couple or years ago, and decided to sign back up for it last fall, in order to get streaming videos on my DVD Player (after Netflix made some of the stupidest marketing moves I have ever seen).  So when I ordered my KF, I also got free two day shipping.  That was a lie. I had it in my hands 23 hours later. Thanks Amazon.After reading some of the negative reviews, I was concerned about both technical functionality, design and usability. The Fire exceeds my expectations on all three.  I am clearly impressed with Kindle's software, and ease of use.  Could I complain about little things like the on off button location, lack of wireless sync, etc.?  Sure. But I am not going to, for one simple reason.  PRICE.  The IPAD 2 is $200 more expensive.  The IPAD 3 is $300 more.  There are some Android tablets that may have the from factor for a similar cost, but I had an Android phone once and was clearly not impressed.  Understanding that Kindle uses Android, the user interface differences is what clearly sets it apart form Android devices.I consider my self more of a techie than others. I have been a longtime user of Apple products, and appreciate their products and their business.  I have also seen Apple make business decisions that are designed to increase their market share at the expense of end user functionality (e.g. Adobe Flash). Netflix has stymied me on how a great company could become so mediocre.  Amazon has made mistakes as well (i.e I remember first time I tried to cancel my prime trial).  But right now, I am pretty impressed with both my Fire, Amazon Prime and soon hope to do more with their cloud services.Bottom line, Kindle Fire AND AMAZON fits the bill for what I am looking for, and even exceeds it.
68,10325,5
Best investment ever! I haven't put this thing down since I got it. I use it for surfing the web, playing games, reading, watching shows and movies. The list is endless. I am glad I got this instead of an Ipad. I was able to pay this off right away because it was so affordable compared to the Ipad. I highly recommend it for everyone

Not for games.  No Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, Fruit Ninja, etc. It's a little thick and a little heavy but the hardware seems solid.  Performance is a little slow.  I upgraded to Android 2.2, rooted this tablet and installed Android Market and Amazon's market.  The biggest disappointment is that I bought this as a way for my 7 year old to play games and found that many will not run on it.  No Angry Birds, no Cut the Rope, no Fruit Ninja, they all have specific code to only run on ARM processors and this one is a MIPS CPU.Youtube runs fine.  Most non-game apps will probably work great.  In fact everything else works so well we might keep it after all.

Love it!!!! I absolutely love my new Kindle Fire for its small size, ability to hold it one hand, the clairty, & its speed... Remember this is an eReader with a few plusses so don't go expecting an iPad for less money... I actually have an iPad as well and am considering selling it because the Kindle does enough for me to be satisfied with :)

Thrive is the cadillac of the tablets! My review is short and to the point. I have owned the 32GB version for about 4 months and I love it. I have had no issues and it works beautiful for me. In my opinion the Thrive outperforms the others I have tried and has more features that I wanted. I seriously considered the Apple iPad and the Samsung Galaxy but neither measured up to Toshiba Thrive. The only negative I have found is the speakers being somewhat inadequate but that was easily resolved by adding the Logitech stereo speakers for tablets which are built specifically for the tablet and enhance the sound dramatically. I added a 16GB SD Card for extended memory and may upgrade that to 32 or 64GB not that I need it but because more is better - right?The bottom line is after owning it for this time I wouldn't even consider changing for another brand and I am glad I chose it to begin with. I love it!

Very good tablet for my needs. Perfect video player, audio player and e-book reading device...I can even change the orientation of e-books in the menu.I am installing some apps....but for the price, righ now, to me it is PERFECT.

LOVE My Le Pan. I just receive my Le Pan tablet today and I LOVE it!!! I have been envious of my sisters ipad for quite some time but the price is out of my range.  I couldn't be happier if i had the real thing.  Highly recommended!

It does what it's supposed to do! I don't know why so many people try to compare this to an iPad. It's not an iPad folks. It's an Amazon branded tablet that gives you access to the Amazon market. That is its beauty. I pre-ordered 4 of these, one for me, the others for my kids. I installed everything on theirs that they would need, and I turn off wifi so they don't buy everything on Amazon. And they love it. They have all their games and books and if I want to add something else, boom it's on all three. People need to get over this whole iPad vs Everything else mentality. The Fir is great for reading, watching movies, and surfing. It's not a personal computer, it's not a business tablet, it's an entertainment device and if that is what you want, it's 200 dollars well spent. I LOVE MY KINDLE FIRE!

Great Value at 249.00. I didn't want a 10 inch tablet, as my wife has an ipad2, and carrying it around is much like carrying my 14 inch hp laptop, minus the brick charger.  I purchased a 16gb model two weeks ago locally for 349.00, including a prepaid visa card rebate worth 100.00, net price 249.00.  The view is very crisp and clear, it is responsive and easy to learn, and surfs the internet very well.  I found using the docs to go apps very useful, and uploading a doc to the box app was easy to do as well.  I am patiently awaiting the upgrade to the operating system, primarily to use the droid app player.  Overall, it is a great tablet for the price.
77,8181,5
Awesome little device!! I have a love for anything HTC, and this did not disappoint! I take this with me everywhere! It gets used FAR more than my other, larger tablet! Bright screen, minimal buttons to distract from the nice design, not too light or flimsy feeling! Android rocks this device beautifully!

Good product that couldn't survive against the iPad. HP TouchPad is a fantastic product on paper that is only partially realized.  WebOS was never given an adequate chance to mature and compete with the likes of iOS and Android.  It certainly had the potential.  As it stands this product is sluggish and seriously lacking in 3rd party application availability.  It is a shame it didn't survive as it would have been a great competitor and would have driven more innovation in the tablet market.
79,11635,5
EXCELENT. This tablet has met all my expectations, it is ideal To scroll in the web, watch videos, listen to radio via Internet, chat, write emails, perhaps the only thing missing is able to connect to 3G networks, through a mobile internet.
80,9549,5
Perfect! I love my iPad! I've had it for almost two weeks and have used it for multiple things. I also bought myself a Logitech folio with built-in keyboard, so it makes the whole experience all the more productive and fun.The iPad is extremely responsive, it has a beautiful sharp screen that makes movie and picture viewing a delight. The tools that come with the tablet are convenient and easy to use. If you've used Apple products before, familiarizing yourself with the iPad is a breeze. But even my husband, who's not an Apple veteran, could figure it out pretty quickly :)
81,5970,5
WOW....impressed.......... I have had this for 2 night thus far. Being new to Android field, it is alot of fun have set this up for all my emails and games. Started to read a book on it. I fully charged it the first night and Wi-Fi set up was a minute total. Up and running and super fast web browsing. I am have problems loading you tube but I will work on that later on. More on this review as I learn more about this.

Underperforms. The Thrive tablet has many limitations - cannot play Netflix and cannot display pdf based web newspapers.  DOes not stack up to the iPad.  I returned and purchased iPad and am VERY satisfied!

Verizon (and AT&T;)  iPad Buyer Beware. I want to preface my review by stating that the iPad is a remarkable product that is worthy of a five star rating. My one star valuation is specific to the new Verizon iPad which in my opinion contains a major flaw detrimental to all consumers unwary of Verizon's tactics.The Verizon iPad is equipped with a sim card that permits cell data usage by subscription. With my AT&T; iPad 2 I am able to subscribe and unsubscribe at-will one month at a time. This is the way a cell data subscription should work. The Verizon iPad does not permit this type of usage. If you cancel a monthly subscription for cell data with Verizon that cancellation permanently inactivates the Verizon sim card. The only remedy is to go to the Verizon store to obtain a new card. I have had to do that twice since I purchased the Verizon iPad and each time it is a major time consuming inconvenience and problem.My first stop at the Verizon store took an hour while the customer service representative insisted that I could not replace the sim card without signing up then and there for a monthly plan. After some argument and consultation with others he recanted but insisted that he could not install the sim card without obtaining from me full personal identifying information (telephone number, e-mail address, home address).The next time I needed a sim card the Verizon store representative insisted she had to charge $10 for the card. She didn't require any personal information and she didn't make any effort to link the sim card with my iPad. She simply insisted on $10 for the sim card and handed it to me.It seems as if Verizon is using the expense and inconvenience of forced sim card inactivation in order to discourage a la carte usage of cell data and to encourage people to pay $20 or $30 dollars a month whether or not they need data service.Had I know about this policy I would never have purchased the Verizon iPad.  The Apple Store saleswoman who sold me the iPad was not aware of this flaw and did not advise me that it was an issue. Surprisingly, none of the Apple Store sales persons I have spoken to since then were aware of this issue.Unless you enjoy spending time at the Verizon Store or unless you intend to use a cellular data plan without interruption, you should stay away from the Verizon iPad.Update on February 4, 2013: I just left my local AT&T; store after speaking with the AT&T; store manager about this issue. He confirmed that AT&T; has adopted the Verizon policy and their new iPads also discourage a la carte usage by requiring the customer to purchase a new sim card if the customer cancels a la carte cell data service. It is clear that both major companies want to discourage at-will cell data usage and promote the more lucrative monthly subscription. What a shame and what a rip-off.  They will probably continue to do this until the customers rebel and refuse to purchase the higher priced iPad and/or the monthly cell data service plan.

Good deal. I got the product I wanted  think it was good and ok for me will shop more if the time comes
87,464,2
BOOOO. It doesn't come with any "play-stores" and is incredibly hard to get one.  A pointless, pretty uselss item if you want to play games, read a book, or view most web pages. It isn't compatible with simple tings like adobe flash players and other very common place software....
88,4315,5
Great Product for the price! I am typing this right now from my new Le Pan TC, and I have to say it is pretty sweet. At 199 I just couldn't resist buying this tablet because I have been looking for one for quite awhile. So far my experience has been great. It is quick and I haven't found any apps that don't work perfectly. The biggest concern I have is the 30 pin connector. It is physically the same as an apple connector but I don't have an apple connector around to find out if it will charge it. Overall this device is a fantastic value, way better than a lot of cheaper tablets from, looking at you superpad.

Love the ipad mini. I bought this for my 6 year old daughter. She uses it all of the time. I've got a good case on it so that if she drops it, it will be protected well. It runs smoothly. It's easy to navigate. The screen is clear and sharp. She loves it. She plays games, takes pictures, watches TV shows on the Disney Channel. There is so much for her to do. It's definitely user friendly and after I set it up, she navigates it on her own with no help. I think I want one for myself.

Love my Kindle Fire from Amazon! Well I've had my Kindle Fire for a little over 2 weeks now and I couldn't love it more!  It fit my needs perfectly  when I am away from my home computer.  Besides reading, which I do a lot of, I find it very easy to get e books from my local library too.  In addition I can check emails, get on Facebook, play words with friends, watch movies, listen to music.  I haven't  learned all that this wonderful little device can do but I'm learning every day. It's a decent size and the colors are terrific too.  I  had a little difficulty  in the beginning with the size of the keyboard, but I found a stylus here at Amazon and after reading the reviews, got one, and my keyboard issues are gone. This was a mother's day gift to myself and I just love it.  I can't say enough about it.  Even the staff at the library have said that they find the Kindle Fire to be the best. It is well worth the price!

Decent upgrade from iPad 1. I initially didn't upgrade my iPad 1 to the 2nd generation as it was "good enough" for my needs. But as time went by and iOS5 was released I found my iPad 1 a bit lacking... Safari would often crash and more recent games such as Infinite Blade (the first one) wouldn't even load without crashing. It was becoming that I was getting a bit miffed with my iPad so I sold it off recently to wait for the iPad 3. Without an iPad in my life there was a bit of a void and I took advantage of one of the many resllers of the iPad 2 in the Marketplace. I found a great deal for a perfectly mint condition iPad and I have to say I am loving my iPad 2. No more crashing, the iPad 2 is really FAST and I feel it will be a bit more "future proof" for next year's iOS6 and even iOS7.Though it doesn't have the rumored retina display of the iPad 3 I feel that if you can get an iPad 2 for less than retail price right now it is well worth the purchase, even this close to the release of the next incarnation. Not to mention that a retina display for a device this large is less important than on an iPhone where the image size is much smaller. The only thing a Retina display will improve is the reading of ebooks and honestly not by that much. It's not as if it goes from illegible to crystal clear, just slightly more crisp... and for my needs not as necessary since I don't read much on my iPad to begin with. Also remember higher resolution also means more battery usage... so unless they put a bigger battery in the next iPad the battery life will be impacted. If they put a larger battery then the iPad 3 itself will be larger.Which leads to another thing I love about the iPad 2, the size! It is insanely thin compared to the first iPad and quite a bit lighter in hand. Now my left arm will have less of a work out when I'm standing and working on the iPad. :PMirroring with an Apple TV is beyond fun and a great feature for those of you who want a HTPC but don't want to deal with the high prices of Mac Mini or a Windows HTPC. Now I can surf the web on my TV and stream (soon to be) any video found on the internet. As Apple declared Flash video is on the down swing and soon it'll bow out of the way to h.264 as the go to streaming media format.The iPad 3 will no doubt be great... and I'm sure I will upgrade to it too... NEXT winter.I paired my iPad with the perfect;KHOMO DUAL CASE: Grey Polyurethane Smart Cover FRONT + Hard Rubberized Poly-carbonate BACK Protector for Apple iPad 2(I found one "used-like new" from Warehouse deals for $17.99)Originally I had the Incase Magazine Case for my iPad which the Apple Smart Covers and this case mimics. Though there were features on the Magazine case that I will miss (3rd standing option that was between the vertical mode and the keyboard mode) this is by far the best looking feeling and quality full body protection that I have seen for any of the iPads. I loved the idea of the Smart Cover but hated the price and the fact there was no back protection. Also heard that the magnetic connectors end up scratching the iPad and falls off easily, this is not something I wanted.Very happy with my purchase and am glad I got myself this great Xmas gift.

Some problems. I bought this tablet to use mainly as an e-reader because I thought of the portability. I think the 7" screen is too small for me. I wish it was 8 or 9 inches. However in the overall the Nook Tablet seems nice. I am still exploring all its features.  I find there is a total lack of instruction of how to use them. For example photo transfer from phone to Nook or from Mac to Nook.  There are 2 places were to allocated photos: Gallery and Photos.  The Gallery seems linked directly to a google account. I am still struggling to get through this.  I want to customize the tablet better for my personal use, and I am still learning, thus for the time being I will give it 4 stars.Not all screens of the tablet can be zoomed in either and this is very bad. Barnes and Nobles books reviews about e-books is one of them and this is why I wished I had a larger screen.I have NOT used the Barnes & Noble library download feature, I use Kindle app instead.The e-mail set up is also annoying as well. It assumes user has a gmail account and setting up different emails is not easy. I have fixed this by directly using webmail account access.Not all apps are  available for Nook tablet either. Some of them (quite popular ones as well) are only available for iPad or android phone. I do not understand why since this is an android platform they do not work with Nook. This is something hard to determine previous the purchase of the tablet and until in need of a specific app. Perhaps not necessarily the fault of the tablet manufacturer, but still irritating.I will leave a better detailed review when I learn all the features of the tablet.***UPDATE April 22.2014The more I use the Nook the more I dislike this tablet. I originally graded it 4 stars but a series of technical problems is forcing me to give it 3 stars.Kindle app continuously freezes or crashes.  Tablet reading feature lights up  as problem as well: it seems to get stuck on a low light dim mode and needs to be adjusted frequently.  Since Barnes & Noble library availably of selection is much inferior to the Amazon one in many ways including price of ebooks, Kindle is a must for avid readers.WhatsUp app is not compatible for this tablet either.Skype app works with the Nook but it is almost useless since the tablet lacks of camera. This is NOT a feature I was looking for initially, but I am now.I even downloaded a free office/document program called King Office, which isn't that bad.The tablet syncs automatically with the contact list of android phone but doesn't recognize a cable connection for photo transfer between the phone and tablet.  I truly dislike the sync part where my contacts are displayed on the tablet. I had to manually hide and remove that option.Google+ and Google icons along with Gmail icons populate the tablet and this is also very annoying.  I am still trying to figure out how to completely eliminate that.I will continue to update as I use it but my opinion about this tablet is that if you are looking to go beyond the e-reader use you are going to be somewhat disappointed.

Awesome product, so-far. I've had this for 3 days and not played a lot with it so far, but felt like sharing the cost factor for people looking into this kind of a PC laptop.I bought it from Amazon, because Lenovo's site would take upto 5-9 business days to ship and I had to travel with this. It is indeed a better deal for my requirements after all, read on :) .First of all, this is an IdeaPad and not a ThinkPad, hence it is designed for home users and not enterprise.This laptop has >> 166 MHz Atom Processor, 1 GB RAM, 250 GB HDD with 8 Cell Battery > $478 (no tax and free shipping)Lenovo has the following standard packages.A. [2 models different colors] Same Processor, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB HDD with 4 Cell Battery > For around $399 (if you use a eCoupon found on the internet) + Tax and Shipping. Hence around $450To match this deal, you would need :a.1. Replacement 2 GB RAM (since there is only 1 slot), Note: Atom processors support only upto 2GB. Add appx. $50.a.2. Replacement 8 cell battery, appx. $60.Total -> $590B. [1 model ] Better processor 183 GHz, same RAM, same HDD with lesser 4 Cell Battery > + Cost + Tax and Shipping > appx $480To match this deal, you would need :b.2. Replacement 8 cell battery, appx. $60.But since it ships with 2 GB standard, we can take the difference upto $30.Total -> $510I had 2GB RAM from my 17"-HP-paper-weight so worked out best.PROs* Its mostly-exactly what was expected.* I like the touch-pad, I may not care for the multi-touch, but the feel and behavior is good.* The construction material is good, given that I have never used an IdeaPad, my "ThinkPad" expectations were not shattered (yet).* I configured the VeriFace and VeriTouch, they are cool (considering they are slow but they work).CON(ishes)* The wireless connection keeps dropping, this may be an issue with my tablet (I have 4 other computers at home and none have such issues),  hope it gets resolved soon.* "HD ready" is mis-leading, there is no HDMI connectivity.* The bloatware on the first start is annoying.* The McAfee takes up a lot of space, I uninstalled it.* The OS (Windows 7 Starter) is a pain.* If you run on batteries the laptop will run slow because of the power settings.No comments on the touch yet!For the price its awesome, I am beginning with a 4 star, perhaps more to come.

Great buy for the price! I bought this for the few functions that I expected to get out of it - namely photo storage, email and Skype. Unfortunately this version (1) doesn't seem to have a powerful enough processor to handle Skype smoothly but in every other respect it does just fine. It's very handy around the house - light and big enough screen to do the job. Most apps are easily configurable including email and even, get this, RDP! No Skype makes it a 4 out of 5 but reliable and fast RDP connection brings it back to a 5 out of 5. I can log into my work PC and take this light little baby instead of a hefty laptop. Battery life is excellent and so is the screen resolution and image.You can't go wrong at this price.

It's not working, don't buy it. I bought this tablet and when I got it I couldn't open any website or even browser even though it was connected on wireless. I sent it back for repair or replacement but when I received it back (after a month, without any information about it in a mean time, my emails were ignored) it didn't work at all. Now I can't even turn it on. I'm really disappointed in this product. Don't buy it, you'll just waste your money.

Blackberry Playbook 64Gb. I love this device!  The 1080p HD display is stunning!  Other tablets have fancy names for their display, this one delivers true 1080P HD video.  The Operating System is a true multi-tasking OS, so you can run numerous apps simultaneously.  Play music while browsing the Internet, while you have Excel open working on your spreadsheet... just like on a personal desktop computer.  The built-in wireless lets me connect to my home or corporate network with ease, as well as hot-spots, and browse the web with speed.  There's even a Remote Desktop app so you can log on to other computers on your network.Speaking of the web, the BB Playbook has a real web browser with Adobe PDF reader, HTML5, Flash, and everything else you need to browse the web.  This is a true tabbed browser, letting you open multiple pages in tabs, just like on your home PC. The Favorites page has thumbnails/logos of each page.  The built-in speakers have surprisingly good sound, although you probably want bluetooth or wired speakers if you're going to be listening live in your living room, and earphones for personal use.The BB Playbook has USB 2 and HDMI ports, so you can use the Playbook to drive a large screen HDTV by using an HDMI cable.  Even more than that, you can use your Blackberry smart phone as a remote control device/mouse.  Hook the Playbook to your big screen, use you BB smartphone as a mouse, and you have an instant presentation machine, using the built-in Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint or PDF, web browser, e-amil, YouTube or whatever you want.  You can also open files that are on your BB smartphone directly on the Playbook!  Transferring files from my PC to the BB Playbook is a snap, you just use Windows to transfer the files from your local Documents or Library to the Playbook network Public folder - drag and drop, nothing to it.It has a native e-mail app that I use for my Yahoo! and Hotmail accounts, and I use BB Bridge to connect to my corporate Exchange mailbox.  The Playbook also has Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, so you can connect the native e-mail app directly to your corporate mail.After only a week, we have been using it for:-tracking medications-creating spreadsheets (such as home inventory)-email (3 separate accounts) and web browsing-youtube player-online shopping-music player & video player-alarm clock and timer-eBook reader-apps: Resistor color codes, audio sinewave generator, eBook reader (native), piano player, various social games, dictionary, Bible w/ text and text-to-speech.There are also good speech to text and text to speech aps.Unlike some popular tablets, this tablet is not merely a web browser/email reader, Angry Birds player, or some toy to keep your kids or cats occupied, it's a real personal and business productivity machine.

Older but still good. We bought this to use with a sound board and it works very well. To be able to control our sound system from anywhere in the sanctuary is excellent.

Ipad2. Got the ipad very quickly.  It works terrific & I'm very happy.  Only thing is, I wish it had vibrate set-up as I am deaf.  Thank you for being very professional about the sale & delivery.

A Great Start. I absolutely love this tablet. I received it a little over a week ago and have hardly left it alone since. I was a little disappointed when I first got it as the Kindle app was not ready, but as of last night the kindle app was updated, so the disappointment is gone.The tablet is FAST. I can breeze right thru any task I need. Having said that, apps do lag a bit to start up( A couple seconds). That really doesn't matter too much since once I open an app I can just leave it open. I love having everything on and running. I can start a video and minimize the webpage and let it load while I go read an email, then hop back to the video when its downloaded. Video playback is smooth and consistent, even on youtube.The internet, and email apps are great. Full, rich web pages displayed just as they would be on a computer. And the email sorting and blending makes it so easy to see what is going on in all my accounts.Battery life is also excellent and I am constantly using it. At work as my calender, at home on the couch surfing the web or checking email, or (now) reading a book with the kindle app, I am never disappointed by the battery running low.There is of course room for improvement. The screen rotation is overly sensitive, and the rotation lock doesnt seam to work right. Hopefully these and other minor annoyances will be dealt with. I am really glad I went with the touchpad over all the tablets I looked at.
