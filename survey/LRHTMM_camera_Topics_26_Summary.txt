B005IHAIMA,0,0,Using this with Eye-Fi card, battery last about 160-200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,0,1,My Canon batteries charge from empty to full power in under 2 hours.-
B005IHAIMA,0,2,This happens using a (spare) battery used in the NEX-5.
B005IHAIMA,0,3,Battery lasts for a while.
B005IHAIMA,0,4,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,0,5,The flash feeds off the main battery, which can be good and bad.
B005IHAIMA,0,6,few years back I had a bad taste for Sony due to their camera's being battery (AA) for most styles.
B005IHAIMA,0,7,This should be equated into the total cost of ownership if a viewfinder is important to the consumer.The battery life seems good for now.
B005IHAIMA,0,8,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,0,9,I figured the battery was dead, so I threw it on the charger.
B005IHAIMA,0,10,Possibly small ones.Battery life is pretty weak.
B005IHAIMA,0,11,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,0,12,This needs to be corrected!!! Also, Sony's new thing with their cameras is that they will ONLY take a Sony battery.
B005IHAIMA,0,13,Wasabi batteries  that I ordered are working too.
B005IHAIMA,0,14,Not exactly efficient, but at least the menus are not hard to navigate or use.The Bad:Battery life - Perhaps I am spoiled, but when I go out for a whole day of shooting pictures and video, I expect the battery to last the whole day.
B005IHAIMA,0,15,I purchased a 3-d party (Wasabi) battery pack (two NP-FW50 batteries, one Wasabi AC charger, one car charger converter for Wasabi AC charger, European converter) which works well with my NEX-5N.
B005IHAIMA,0,16,I LOVE that you can see what percentage of battery you have remaining.
B005IHAIMA,0,17,I do get significantly more barrel distortion from the SONY 18-55mm lens than from the Canon 17mm-85mm.BATTERYNEX-5N comes with a separate battery recharger, which is handy since the camera drains the battery rather fast it is nice to have a spare battery charging while the camera is being used.
B005IHAIMA,0,18,This can be considered a pro too, as Sony did a great job with the regular controls.Pros:The battery lasts a good long time.
B005IHAIMA,0,19,I can't say enough good thing about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,0,20,But you probably already know that so I thought I'd mention a few of the cons... none of which would make me downgrade my rating, but could be important to you.CONS (The pros would take too long to write):- The battery takes FOREVER to charge, it took an hour on a new and empty batter just to get enough charge to format my SD card, overnight for a full charge.
B005IHAIMA,0,21,No more guessing and losing the perfect shot (happened so many times!) because 1/4 remaining battery equates to 2 percent!This is the first time that the auto modes actually work for me.
B005IHAIMA,0,22,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,0,23,I must have mistaken this feature from some other camera I was researching.At this time, the only real negative I can find is the battery door.
B005IHAIMA,0,24,I carry 3 batteries total so running out of juice has not been an issue.
B005IHAIMA,1,0,I don't like touch screens.
B005IHAIMA,1,1,Overall the screen is quite good and I only miss it in very bright sun.-
B005IHAIMA,1,2,the screen is very clear and bright.
B005IHAIMA,1,3,Try it and you'll see.I also like the articulated LCD on the back, and the touch screen, and the simplicity of the menus.
B005IHAIMA,1,4,It has a great lcd screen and the best of any of the mirrorless cameras I have tried.
B005IHAIMA,1,5,Also, the touch screen is incredible.
B005IHAIMA,1,6,Tap the screen to focus during movie (haven't tried it for photo--haven't tried it because touch screen so new to me on a camera).
B005IHAIMA,1,7,Very stealth with the flipout screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,8,The touch screen is nice that wasn't in NEX-5, and so with NEX-5N you can operate the mode dials or touch the screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,9,Very good camera and a very good image.
B005IHAIMA,1,10,The photos look very sharp and nice.
B005IHAIMA,1,11,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,12,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,1,13,But, the photos it took were okay when small, but not so good on a bigger computer screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,14,Such crisp images and such a great preview screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,15,The LCD screen on the R1 will swivel a full 360 degrees!
B005IHAIMA,1,16,I found this camera very easy to use.
B005IHAIMA,1,17,I like the user interface and the touch screen is a nice addition.
B005IHAIMA,1,18,He loves using it.
B005IHAIMA,1,19,I like that you can adjust the screen for above/below views.
B005IHAIMA,1,20,the screen cover is high quality and I would recommend to anyone with a Nex5 camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,21,With the screen articulated to face up, taking photos is quick and easy.
B005IHAIMA,1,22,The tilting screen is a great thing, but it doesn't flip around (although it does on the NEX F3), so you can't see yourself.-
B005IHAIMA,1,23,:) OH! and picture quality is pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,1,24,I just like to recomand this camera, he is great and a very good price.
B005IHAIMA,2,0,Excellent cameraWas undecided between the Canon T3i and this model but it is very good.
B005IHAIMA,2,1,I have owned Canon 40D, Canon 5D Mark ii, Canon T2i and so on...
B005IHAIMA,2,2,Upgraded the firmware to newest version, Auto focus is fast!
B005IHAIMA,2,3,the t2i was great, and if you have investment of canon lenses this isn't worth the switch, but for me it was otherwise.i
B005IHAIMA,2,4,I have been a Canon and Nikon DSLR owner for a long time.
B005IHAIMA,2,5,It has more dynamic range than a full-frame Canon 5D Mark II, and it has better video quality as well.
B005IHAIMA,2,6,It should be noted that e-mount lenses are very well priced when compared to other systems.
B005IHAIMA,2,7,Keeps up with my Canon 7D.
B005IHAIMA,2,8,Amazing camera at an amazing price - review for Video.
B005IHAIMA,2,9,I would go for a slightly more expensive DSLR for that such as a Canon Ti.
B005IHAIMA,2,10,Plus it does very well with symmetrical lenses compared to the other systems out there.
B005IHAIMA,2,11,mainly got this for video, and for the size, so i will not review picture quality (its been done plenty of times).video is amazing, especially coming from a t2i, and using my gf's t4i. the best part is - true autofocus during video.
B005IHAIMA,2,12,Replaced my DSLR Canon Rebel XS with this Sony.
B005IHAIMA,2,13,It even beats my canon 5D mark ii in  high ISO/low light.
B005IHAIMA,2,14,I was shocked to see that bested my Canon T2i in over all IQ  in different lightings) and beats the Canon T2i in high ISO/low light performance by a wide margin.
B005IHAIMA,2,15,If you buy the viewfinder then you cannot use the enclosed flash while the viewfinder is in use.
B005IHAIMA,2,16,No built in viewfinder - you can buy one for $250 extra but I don't want to spend $250 on a viewfinder - a viewfinder and an extra lens take this camera up to 7N territory in cost which has a lot more than just the viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,2,17,Anyway camera showed up, needed a firmware upgrade which was super easy and I am in love.
B005IHAIMA,2,18,As an owner of Canon 7D and T3i with multiple "L" series lenses, I can honestly say this this little camera's capabilities completely rivals that of my Canon equipment at a fraction of the cost.
B005IHAIMA,2,19,It was time for me to upgrade from my Nikon D50 (a 6.1 megapixel dinosaur I came to find out).
B005IHAIMA,2,20,It works wonders.
B005IHAIMA,2,21,However, this camera shoots DSLR quality photos that are amazing in auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,2,22,As much as I love this camera, I may try the upgrade, but at nearly treble the cost for a 50% increase in image size, that will wait quite a bit.
B005IHAIMA,2,23,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,2,24,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,3,0,I wanted it for the video quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,1,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,2,Good for still photo.
B005IHAIMA,3,3,Photos great, video sucks.
B005IHAIMA,3,4,Everything is good except the annoying click noise in video mode.
B005IHAIMA,3,5,There is an audio clicking problem for this new camera in video mode...
B005IHAIMA,3,6,Audio clicking problem in video mode.
B005IHAIMA,3,7,Still has the click noise when shooting video.
B005IHAIMA,3,8,But it must go back, the sound is uncalled for.
B005IHAIMA,3,9,My quick interview-style video with my wife was broadcast quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,10,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,3,11,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,12,camera also overheats pretty easily when you're recording video.
B005IHAIMA,3,13,The defect does not affect the picture quality of still images or video, but it does make the video recording feature unusable as the clicking noise is very noticeable.
B005IHAIMA,3,14,But my impression is very good.At first, I was very anxious about the clicking sound during video recording and I was glad that it was not present.
B005IHAIMA,3,15,The video recording is excellent and clear.
B005IHAIMA,3,16,The picture quality is just nuts from a camera at this price.
B005IHAIMA,3,17,And the test video also shows the same thing.
B005IHAIMA,3,18,I never expected this camera to record great audio since its a camera not a camcorder.
B005IHAIMA,3,19,The kit zoom is very comendable and the video features are excellent.
B005IHAIMA,3,20,NEX5N click of death.The camera producing background clicking sounds while recording a video.
B005IHAIMA,3,21,It shoots 24p and 60p video at full 1080 resolution.
B005IHAIMA,3,22,Its best feature is the HD video with exceptionally good audio quality, but if your intention is to shoot long videos DON'T, as the camera will OVERHEAT and automatically shut down after about 15 minutes of operation.
B005IHAIMA,3,23,Great value.
B005IHAIMA,3,24,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,0,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,4,1,However, this camera shoots DSLR quality photos that are amazing in auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,2,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,3,Great transition camera from point and shoots, works as well as most DSLR!!!
B005IHAIMA,4,4,great camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,5,This is a great camera!
B005IHAIMA,4,6,Amazing picture quality in auto mode - I gave up on my DSLR largely because I am such an amateur photographer that I could never get the settings right to take a great photo.
B005IHAIMA,4,7,Tried out the manual modes, but mostly just used Auto because that is what I wanted.
B005IHAIMA,4,8,For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,9,As he has been using a DSLR for awhile now, the unclear settings didn't set him back as much as us.
B005IHAIMA,4,10,Only took 250 shots so far.
B005IHAIMA,4,11,This camera puts forth such great, quality photos in auto mode that I usually do not have to do much editing to get a great picture to share.4)
B005IHAIMA,4,12,Panorama feature is amazing.
B005IHAIMA,4,13,Great for point and shoot or more advanced photographers.
B005IHAIMA,4,14,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,4,15,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,4,16,I mostly got the camera for still shots.
B005IHAIMA,4,17,Takes great low light photos- I rarely use the flash with this camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,18,The rest of us are moving up from a point and shoot and are still learning how to use a DSLR.This camera has a few features that could be a little better, but overall it's great.
B005IHAIMA,4,19,I would definitely recommend it for someone looking to get good pictures if you're a point and shoot person like me.
B005IHAIMA,4,20,I use the Auto mode basically all the time.
B005IHAIMA,4,21,For more than 15 years, I've only used point and shoot cameras.
B005IHAIMA,4,22,Shots are brighter and cleaner than any shots I've ever seen from a digital.The fast continuous shooting mode is impressive.
B005IHAIMA,4,23,Instead, it takes amazing low light pictures (even in a mostly dark room) in auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,24,The good thing was, I hardly needed to use it even at night because it was so amazing at adjusting to the setting.
B005IHAIMA,5,0,I also noticed the same exact spots when is happened to use iso 100 and 1 second shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,5,1,The same shot with 800 iso had no trace of the spots.
B005IHAIMA,5,2,In evening events like volleyball and soccer, I used ISO 800 and 1600 to still get fast shutter to stop the action.
B005IHAIMA,5,3,The images are superb, the start up time and shooting speed are fast!
B005IHAIMA,5,4,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,5,5,The first time I noticed it the iso was 3200.
B005IHAIMA,5,6,I've tried adjusting shutter speed, ISO, etc and still didn't have much luck.
B005IHAIMA,5,7,Everyone is in awe when they here the rapid-fire.The shutter also makes a nice "mechanical" sound when you take a shot.
B005IHAIMA,5,8,;)Start-up time is very fast, and shot-to-shot time is even faster.
B005IHAIMA,5,9,I'd wager that a good 20% of shots will be missed by anyone using this camera until they learn how to compensate for this issue by using a higher ISO than should be needed or using the shutter priority setting or whatever else.
B005IHAIMA,5,10,In fact, the shutter speed is so grand I love showing it off to friends and family.I would buy again.
B005IHAIMA,5,11,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,5,12,However, because the camera must apply the correction upon pressing the button to take the photo, trying to do burst shots does no justice.
B005IHAIMA,5,13,I wanted something to take pictures of my fast moving children.
B005IHAIMA,5,14,Great camera!
B005IHAIMA,5,15,Took this ice climbing (with the fixed 1.8/50mm which I love) and portrait-style/climber in action pictures were excellent.
B005IHAIMA,5,16,I love that I can switch from movie to still by using different buttons (movie button starts and stops movie, and stills are initiated through the shutter release).
B005IHAIMA,5,17,Great transition camera from point and shoots, works as well as most DSLR!!!
B005IHAIMA,5,18,There are no visible spots or dust under iso 3200 and faster than 1 second.
B005IHAIMA,5,19,Autofocus is fast and works well for pictures of my kids.
B005IHAIMA,5,20,Love it!!!! Love it love it!!!!
B005IHAIMA,5,21,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,5,22,Loving every single but of it!
B005IHAIMA,5,23,It handles high ISOs nicely.
B005IHAIMA,5,24,The spots appeared several times more at iso 3200 in the exact same location in the frame and changing between 18-55 kit lens and f2.8/16 didn't effect the outcome.
B005IHAIMA,6,0,The include flash...is a flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,1,I got this with my sony card and it was expensive but worth every dime.
B005IHAIMA,6,2,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,6,3,Great cam for taking videos and having always around.
B005IHAIMA,6,4,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,6,5,There are also one or two model camera cases that accommodate the flash when it is mounted.
B005IHAIMA,6,6,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,6,7,I do very little direct flash lighting, so it's not something I would use much.I have ordered the optional flash, which has bounce options.
B005IHAIMA,6,8,Want a shot with flash -- just pop up the attachable flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,9,This camera is quite good.
B005IHAIMA,6,10,The flash feeds off the main battery, which can be good and bad.
B005IHAIMA,6,11,Nice Cam.
B005IHAIMA,6,12,The only thing I did not like about the ordering experience is a representative called shortly after I placed my order online to try and sell an extra off-brand battery and memory card.
B005IHAIMA,6,13,Glad i bought it.I paid $623 on EBAY and mine came with a 18/55MM Lens, flash, a small SONY tote bag, 4GB SD Card, and charger/battery.
B005IHAIMA,6,14,The camera is so good with low light that I almost never use the flash, but because the flash comes with a little plastic case that attaches right to the camera strap, the flash is always handy if needed.The bottom line:  I LOVE this camera, and though the menu is cumbersome I'd still buy it again because the low light capabilities are awesome.
B005IHAIMA,6,15,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,6,16,I HIGHLY recommend this camera, as well as the 18-55 lens, the 16mm and the fisheye adapter and an extra battery, as well as a large fast memory chip (64GB Komputer Bay class 10 works very well); and the extra audio adapter (but only if you plan to take advantage of the excellent 1080p video).
B005IHAIMA,6,17,I highly recommend this camera.One final note, I wound up buying the camera from one of Amazon's recommended external sellers, Cameta Camera.
B005IHAIMA,6,18,I don't find having the flash and viewfinder or mic (both purchased separately) being separate to be an issue.
B005IHAIMA,6,19,Some cameras don't, this Sony works perfectly (no range issues, keeps power to the card till its done uploading)
B005IHAIMA,6,20,I can't say enough good thing about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,6,21,I inserted the memory card into my laptop and was able to confirm that the images turned out good.
B005IHAIMA,6,22,The following items were included along with the camera: warranty card, paper manual for the NEX-3/NEX-3C/NEX-5/NEX-5C, software disk, neck strap, usb cable, battery and charger and flash accessory with its respectable case.FIRST IMPRESSIONSI knew this camera was going to be small and compact, but when I took it out of its protective bag, it was even smaller than I anticipated.
B005IHAIMA,6,23,Possibly small ones.Battery life is pretty weak.
B005IHAIMA,6,24,They fix this in newer models with the universal horseshoe, but as long as you are just an average Joe who will just go with the included flash, it isn't a deal breaker.
B005IHAIMA,7,0,great portability and great image quality.
B005IHAIMA,7,1,Great value.
B005IHAIMA,7,2,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,7,3,I was looking for a camera which was small in size but was great in taking pictures.
B005IHAIMA,7,4,Great pictures from a compact camera.
B005IHAIMA,7,5,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,7,6,If you wnat a small package and great quality this is it.
B005IHAIMA,7,7,great quality in small package.
B005IHAIMA,7,8,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,7,9,Best of the Compact Camera lines.
B005IHAIMA,7,10,It's lightweight, easy to use and I get great photos with it.
B005IHAIMA,7,11,The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.
B005IHAIMA,7,12,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,7,13,Recommended for size, weight, image quality, video quality and reliability.
B005IHAIMA,7,14,:) OH! and picture quality is pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,7,15,It's small and light.
B005IHAIMA,7,16,The compact size of a point-and-shoot camera with the quality of a DSLR one.
B005IHAIMA,7,17,The size is perfect for me.
B005IHAIMA,7,18,camera is light-weight, easy to use, and produces AMAZING quality photos and video.
B005IHAIMA,7,19,I also have a Canon G11 (which I love)This is a great in between a DSLR and a POcket cam.
B005IHAIMA,7,20,I used this for well over year now, a lot, and I think it's great.
B005IHAIMA,7,21,Also, while 55mm doesn't sound like much, with 16 megapixels and the camera's super-easy way of zooming in on the pics you have taken, it is easy to zoom in after the shot is taken and still get excellent resolution.
B005IHAIMA,7,22,Olympus Zoom 70 to 150mm, all with delicious results.
B005IHAIMA,7,23,With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.
B005IHAIMA,7,24,This is the best camera ive ever owned.
B005IHAIMA,8,0,Negatif yani ise lens portfoyunun zayif olmasi.
B005IHAIMA,8,1,I'm okay with the kit lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,2,So far I only have the 16mm and the kit 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,3,Ama Sony Nex-5n tum fikrimi degistirdi.
B005IHAIMA,8,4,Lens for Sony NEX Cameras.
B005IHAIMA,8,5,I cannot say it was outperformed by say, Nikkor's kit lens in any way.
B005IHAIMA,8,6,For a kit lens, I am impressed.
B005IHAIMA,8,7,A great Prime Lens for the Nex e-mount Sony 50mm f/1.8 Mid-Range Lens for Sony E Mount Nex Cameras4.
B005IHAIMA,8,8,Dug up a basket of great legacy lenses to try on the Nex 5n.
B005IHAIMA,8,9,If you buy one, get the kit with the 18-55 lens which represents the best value.
B005IHAIMA,8,10,By the way, the 18-55 len is a little heavy.
B005IHAIMA,8,11,Compared to DSLR, m43, Point/Shoot, NEX 3, NEX C3.
B005IHAIMA,8,12,I'm using 21/4 Skopar, 28/3.5 Skopar, 35/1.7 Ultron, 50/1.5 Ultron with great results.
B005IHAIMA,8,13,With a pancake lens like the Sony 16mm, the weight and size approximates an XZ2 or LX7.Also, when you point this camera and the pancake lens at a person, there is no "DSLR intimidation" and frown....
B005IHAIMA,8,14,I purchased the Nex 5N with the 18-55mm kit lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,15,We were working with the 18-55 lens and also the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,8,16,For this reason, it is inevitable and also advantageous to use one's dSLR lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.I am able to use my Nikon F-mount lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.
B005IHAIMA,8,17,I also bought 16mm lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,18,Try finding an 18mm lens for a dSLR, it'll cost as much as the body itself.
B005IHAIMA,8,19,It's a very solid camera with very good picture quality and the kit lens is quite nice as well.
B005IHAIMA,8,20,So I bought the NEX-5N with the 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,21,Lens are somewhat limited at this point, but with lenses adapters the possibilities are endless.
B005IHAIMA,8,22,After dragging an 18MP dSLR with 18-200 lens to Disneyland and taking only 200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,8,23,I also have the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,8,24,My current lens of choice is a asahi supertak 50mm f1.4 lens, using an m42 adapter.
B005IHAIMA,9,0,It's very strongest plus is the high ISO image quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,1,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,9,2,I always wanted a camera that could take DSLR quality images without the size.
B005IHAIMA,9,3,Low noise at high iso as well.
B005IHAIMA,9,4,The high ISO quality and resolution at most ISO's really amazes me.
B005IHAIMA,9,5,Great image quality but try before you buy.
B005IHAIMA,9,6,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,9,7,Any the photos' quility is high.
B005IHAIMA,9,8,The camera produces really high quality pictures!
B005IHAIMA,9,9,Even video taken in low light can look good.
B005IHAIMA,9,10,Awesome Still Images and Video Quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,11,Picture quality is excellent especially low light pics.
B005IHAIMA,9,12,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,9,13,The image quality of this new sensor put in the 5N is extraordinary.
B005IHAIMA,9,14,I think the image quality surpasses the Canon T3i or even the Nikon D7000 at high ISO setting.
B005IHAIMA,9,15,It was known for its great lens and sensor, but had no image stabilization.
B005IHAIMA,9,16,Nice image quality; poor autofocus.
B005IHAIMA,9,17,The camera has great ISO performance and very good color replication.
B005IHAIMA,9,18,fantastic high ISO performance up to ISO 3200.
B005IHAIMA,9,19,Amazing image quality in compact format.
B005IHAIMA,9,20,In addition, the low light/high ISO image quality is fantastic.
B005IHAIMA,9,21,This will give most people all the image quality they will ever need and then some.
B005IHAIMA,9,22,It seams to have just the right ballance of pixel to sensor size for great performance.
B005IHAIMA,9,23,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,9,24,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.
B005IHAIMA,10,0,I just like to recomand this camera, he is great and a very good price.
B005IHAIMA,10,1,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,10,2,We bought it for our honeymoon this year and it was great!

B005IHAIMA,10,23,Good price, even better delivery time and Awesome Camera.
B005IHAIMA,10,24,definitely a great product.
B005IHAIMA,11,0,Really a good cameraI.
B005IHAIMA,11,1,I have been asked a several times if I am a professional photographer (No! It's just a great camera!).
B005IHAIMA,11,2,I found this camera very easy to use.
B005IHAIMA,11,3,I am not a professional photographer, but this camera is great, the look, easy access, weight and functions...I just love it
B005IHAIMA,11,4,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,11,5,Compact camera with DSLR quality.
B005IHAIMA,11,6,This camera really gives me professional shots without hiring a photographer.
B005IHAIMA,11,7,Good.
B005IHAIMA,11,8,Great pictures from a compact camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,9,Picture shooting effect is good and easy to handle.
B005IHAIMA,11,10,I am most certainly a novice photographer and this camera is a great stepping stone for me.So far I am liking the photo quality I have seen come out of it.
B005IHAIMA,11,11,It's lightweight, easy to use and I get great photos with it.
B005IHAIMA,11,12,The best part is it doesnt weight a million lbs like the other DSLR i looked at.
B005IHAIMA,11,13,Great Fun.
B005IHAIMA,11,14,Picture quality is excellent.
B005IHAIMA,11,15,Excellent features.
B005IHAIMA,11,16,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,11,17,This camera takes great photos.
B005IHAIMA,11,18,There are a myriad of settings to chose from, and the controls seem quite intuitive.The camera body itself is very light weight and feels good in the hand.
B005IHAIMA,11,19,Excellent camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,20,very easy to handle.
B005IHAIMA,11,21,My back says this camera is great!
B005IHAIMA,11,22,A camera that is just easy to use and takes great pics.
B005IHAIMA,11,23,great buy worth every penny
B005IHAIMA,11,24,I am still getting into photography but this is by far the coolest thing I own.
B005IHAIMA,12,0,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,1,Takes great pics.
B005IHAIMA,12,2,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,3,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,4,What surprised me was the quality of HD video.
B005IHAIMA,12,5,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,12,6,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,12,7,Amazing camera at an amazing price - review for Video.
B005IHAIMA,12,8,Now that Sony has fixed it, it's a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,9,A great camera for photographing, but not for video recording.
B005IHAIMA,12,10,Takes outstanding pictures and video.
B005IHAIMA,12,11,If I can use it effectively (and all my pics have come out GREAT I must say) then most anyone could.
B005IHAIMA,12,12,This camera takes great photos.
B005IHAIMA,12,13,I couldn't have taken it with the R1.And the video.
B005IHAIMA,12,14,Great cam for taking videos and having always around.
B005IHAIMA,12,15,Sony does it all.
B005IHAIMA,12,16,Check out video quality of "hungry seagulls" on U-tube.
B005IHAIMA,12,17,The camera is great.
B005IHAIMA,12,18,Have used it for a while and this really makes a difference when you are using a Sony High End Camera with Accessaries from Sony
B005IHAIMA,12,19,I love this camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,20,mainly got this for video, and for the size, so i will not review picture quality (its been done plenty of times).video is amazing, especially coming from a t2i, and using my gf's t4i. the best part is - true autofocus during video.
B005IHAIMA,12,21,I've been reading the reviews so one of the first things I tried was the video!
B005IHAIMA,12,22,will Sony do?
B005IHAIMA,12,23,Great Product.
B005IHAIMA,12,24,Amazing Camera.
B005IHAIMA,13,0,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.
B005IHAIMA,13,1,The camera was fine for two months.
B005IHAIMA,13,2,Used it in a trip to Maui.
B005IHAIMA,13,3,I have gone a week without turning it on and it only dropped from 100% to 99%.
B005IHAIMA,13,4,It is still going strong and we use it all the time without fail it takes the nicest photos with the least amount of out of focus shots I have ever had.
B005IHAIMA,13,5,The day it came in we went out with our 11 month old out for a morning photo shoot in the park.
B005IHAIMA,13,6,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,13,7,I don't care about the video feature, but it works well.
B005IHAIMA,13,8,No problems at 1080p/24fps.Only regret is we didn't buy this a year ago.PROS:Amazing picture and video quality.
B005IHAIMA,13,9,This piece should go with us for a couple of years.
B005IHAIMA,13,10,Still Clickin' I just bought this camera last week (Aug 1).
B005IHAIMA,13,11,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,13,12,It comes with a limited lifetime warranty and is water, temperature, shock and x-ray proof.When the camera was switched on, nothing happened.
B005IHAIMA,13,13,They both involve the screen flickering about 1/2 second after you turn the camera off under different circumstances.
B005IHAIMA,13,14,A camera that is just easy to use and takes great pics.
B005IHAIMA,13,15,I have been using this for nearly three months with more than a thousand pictures taken.
B005IHAIMA,13,16,Video defect is not the only problem.
B005IHAIMA,13,17,I can't say enough good thing about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,13,18,I must have mistaken this feature from some other camera I was researching.At this time, the only real negative I can find is the battery door.
B005IHAIMA,13,19,I do not say this half cocked, either.The proof is in my pudding.
B005IHAIMA,13,20,Great product.
B005IHAIMA,13,21,I have read that if there is no sticker on your LCD, you should be good (apparently they failed to put them on the ones that dont have this problem).
B005IHAIMA,13,22,I've chased my kids around the yard and the park for days with this camera and have yet to get a blurry pic.
B005IHAIMA,13,23,Bought this after reading a couple score reviews on the top entry-level cameras in the genre.
B005IHAIMA,13,24,No more guessing and losing the perfect shot (happened so many times!) because 1/4 remaining battery equates to 2 percent!This is the first time that the auto modes actually work for me.
B005IHAIMA,14,0,Also the screen is susceptible to scratches.
B005IHAIMA,14,1,My only problem is that I have polarized sunglasses, and when I wear them, I can't see the image on the display screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,2,You can customize 3 of the buttons on the back of the camera, and that helps tremendously, but there are still several things I wish were more readily available without fumbling through the menu.There is no viewfinder so you must frame your photos using the LCD screen, which can be difficult in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,14,3,Overall the screen is quite good and I only miss it in very bright sun.-
B005IHAIMA,14,4,The camera does even have a single scratch on the body or the screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,5,the screen is very clear and bright.
B005IHAIMA,14,6,;-)* The screen is very hard to use in direct sunlight.
B005IHAIMA,14,7,If someone is considering both of these cameras let me start with the differences between the two cameras that made me choose NEX-5N.My main issue with C3 was seeing the LCD screen in the sun.
B005IHAIMA,14,8,You MUST buy a the screen protector for this product as it is prone to damage over time.
B005IHAIMA,14,9,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,14,10,I lately tested the Lumix LX7 and this point is more apparent than with the sony(very bright saturated on camera's screen and much less on the computer's screen.4.
B005IHAIMA,14,11,you can resolve this issue by removing the sticker behind the LCD screen and extending out the LCD screen so the camera can cool faster but that will void your warranty.
B005IHAIMA,14,12,If you buy the viewfinder then you cannot use the enclosed flash while the viewfinder is in use.
B005IHAIMA,14,13,The screen almost seems "soft" and easily scratched if you are not really careful.
B005IHAIMA,14,14,the screw that secures the attachment of the flash to the top of the camera battery is inaccessible to those that have big fingers!
B005IHAIMA,14,15,Then one summer day last week, while taking some family photos, I touched the square on the touch screen to fix focus on my kid's face and the screen instantly developed a crack on the inside.Called Sony and explained the issue.
B005IHAIMA,14,16,Feels as if its made out of the same plastic too.
B005IHAIMA,14,17,My second complaint is that my unit has a dead pixel smack dab in the middle of the rear LCD panel.
B005IHAIMA,14,18,Easy control and settings with touch screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,19,Now please Sony, just put a better hinge on the LCD panel and a PC socket, so I can use it with a studio flash, this camera really deserves a five star rating... but the lack of flash connector and the limited hinge on the LCD panel are the big failures of the camera.. ....
B005IHAIMA,14,20,The third way is on a tripod, using its rear LCD screen.Having previously owned several point and shoot cameras (e.g, Panasonic LX-3, Canon S-90, etc.), I am acutely aware of the limitations of the limitations in aiming, composing and focusing while using the camera's rear LCD screen with the arms extended forward.
B005IHAIMA,14,21,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,14,22,I was not able to attach the flash at all and it kept breaking the contact, consequently the flash would not fire.
B005IHAIMA,14,23,Touchscreen cracked just by touching while trying to focus the object.
B005IHAIMA,14,24,It is light and feels very well built.
B005IHAIMA,15,0,I can either have a viewfinder of a flash on, not both.
B005IHAIMA,15,1,It focuses fast enough though there has been a time or two af has failed me.
B005IHAIMA,15,2,My Canon G12 is slow to focus.
B005IHAIMA,15,3,I first purchased Sony NEX-C3 and liked  many things about it, but two problems caused me to trade it in for Sony NEX-5N, which addressed those two problems.
B005IHAIMA,15,4,Video defect is not the only problem.
B005IHAIMA,15,5,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,15,6,I shall post an update when I use the camera for more time to comment on different functions..Update 1: after using the camera for almost a month:1.
B005IHAIMA,15,7,With the latest firmware update, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,15,8,In time its shortcomings (primarily slow repeat shooting and poor autofocus) came to really bug me and I've moved on to better cameras.
B005IHAIMA,15,9,The camera has inconsistent problem of getting locked up when shooting.
B005IHAIMA,15,10,If you shoot fast moving subjects like sports, you'll prefer a DSLR as the autofocus on the NEX just isn't as good.
B005IHAIMA,15,11,However the mount on the OLED electronic viewfinder is only compatible with NEX-5N and is not compatible with NEX-C3.Update: I now own the OLED view finder.
B005IHAIMA,15,12,The latest firmware update allows users to set auto-exposure bracketing to as wide as 3 stops per shot.
B005IHAIMA,15,13,Hopefully, SONY will provide some modifications in firmware upgrades to make the camera a little easier to use.
B005IHAIMA,15,14,Instead, I would just upgrade to the NEX 7 or another Sony NEX model that comes with the electronic viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,15,15,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,15,16,The new firmware upgrade makes the Nex series much easier to navagate.
B005IHAIMA,15,17,The Sony A55 was perhaps good enough, fast auto-focus even in video, good images, but much too big; I wanted a NEX 5 but with the quality of a A580.
B005IHAIMA,15,18,I am writing this review from the point of view of a (Nikon) dSLR user.
B005IHAIMA,15,19,This can be improved by adjusting the brightness setting, or for $300+ you can purchase an add-on electronic viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,15,20,I'm not going to add anything to the other reviews.
B005IHAIMA,15,21,sharply focused), it works really well for most things, it's not quite precise enough to get critical focus on an eye with f/1.4 lens, but for most portraits and video work it does a great job outlining the in focus subject.4)
B005IHAIMA,15,22,I used Custom for Soft Key C and was able to add Metering Mode, AF Mode, Autofocus Area, and AF/MF functions.
B005IHAIMA,15,23,The lack of a viewfinder take some adjusting to, and adding it is half the price of the camera.
B005IHAIMA,15,24,For those times when I do get down on one knee to take a shot, I can take an even lower angle in my shots.Coming immediately from using a dSLR, I do notice a short lag when compared to the optical viewfinder of a dSLR.
B005IHAIMA,16,0,I call back and Im told that I am already in line to get a call from a Tech.
B005IHAIMA,16,1,Who knows, and at this point, who cares.After one more call to Sony, they said they would have a technician call me, but so far, no one has called.
B005IHAIMA,16,2,My next camera will probably be a Nikon or a Canon, from a company that actually takes pride in their cameras.
B005IHAIMA,16,3,FURTHER UPDATE  ***After dodging my calls, I finally gave up on Sony support.
B005IHAIMA,16,4,The representative assured me that I would have to ship the camera at my expense but it would be repaired and send back at no charge.
B005IHAIMA,16,5,Finally I contacted Sony support and they told me that the camera had to be sent in for repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,6,I call Sony Service and reference the email about the expedited return and repair as well as my original repair #.
B005IHAIMA,16,7,My revised rating and review is based off the poor experience with Sony Technical Support and the repair of the issue.I contacted Sony Service using the repair number of my Service Call repair, after receiving my "repaired" 5n and noticing the new sound issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,8,Defective after Sony Repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,9,Unfortunately they require that the camera be shipped to a Sony service center for repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,10,My first was returned before being aware of the Service Call issued by Sony for the clicking issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,11,Again they do call but not when Im available, but do leave a voicemail that I should call back.
B005IHAIMA,16,12,I just called Sony and they confirmed that the issue is still there and that customers need to send their $700 cameras if they find the clicking issue.I asked them whether they can tell me a way to figure out whether the issue is still present but they said they cannot.
B005IHAIMA,16,13,The person again states that the Tech is already set to call me.The next day I get the call.
B005IHAIMA,16,14,TBH, Sony customer service was very good and they paid for shipping.
B005IHAIMA,16,15,I later find out they tried to call but I was not avialable.
B005IHAIMA,16,16,A day later I received an email advising I would receive a response soon.Two days later I receive an email from a Tech stating they would overnight the body and expedite the repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,17,You sure you want to buy something new at a cost of $700 and send it back straight to the service center and wait for 5 days or more and still have that problem there after it comes back?
B005IHAIMA,16,18,I received this camera around 11/10 and called the next day for a replacement.
B005IHAIMA,16,19,Sony is finally acknowledging the problem just not saying what it is and if the fix will completely fix the problem.
B005IHAIMA,16,20,You then have to argue with Sony about replacing the new camera you sent to them for repair - good luck with that.
B005IHAIMA,16,21,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,16,22,If Sony would re-commit to being a consumer-oriented service organization and not only a product manufacturer, it might see a resurgence of consumer loyalty, along with a company turnaround.
B005IHAIMA,16,23,(check on YouTube)Sony not helping with solving the problem, they offer to send the camera back and the process will take around 30 days to get it back fixed.They offered me to buy a new one and return the old one if I don't want to be without a camera for a month.
B005IHAIMA,16,24,Don't know the Sony repair engineers assessed it as physically damaged.Gonna get it back, sell it for whatever I can get and swear never to buy a Sony product again!!!
B005IHAIMA,17,0,The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.
B005IHAIMA,17,1,After it focuses you can also manually fine-tune the focus to your object.
B005IHAIMA,17,2,I use my manual lenses on M or A modes, but have been using several of the scene modes where it will adjust shutter speed and ISO and other parameters to give you their scene shot.
B005IHAIMA,17,3,No auto ISR on Manual mode (some DSLR's will let you do this).Overall,
B005IHAIMA,17,4,The controls are much better, allowing things like manual focus, manual exposure, etc.
B005IHAIMA,17,5,As he has been using a DSLR for awhile now, the unclear settings didn't set him back as much as us.
B005IHAIMA,17,6,Having the two cameras set up differently means not having to fumble around trying to change menu settings btw auto and manual while on a shoot.
B005IHAIMA,17,7,It's simple, just switch to the Menu mode and then select Brightness/Color and ISO setting is right there.
B005IHAIMA,17,8,I then used the Right Key Setting on the rotary dial for White Balance, and the Soft Key B Setting for ISO.
B005IHAIMA,17,9,Tried out the manual modes, but mostly just used Auto because that is what I wanted.
B005IHAIMA,17,10,The touch focusing and focus tracking are wonderful.One other thing that surprised me is how useful the intelligent auto setting has turned out.
B005IHAIMA,17,11,If you shoot manual focus lenses and/or in RAW mode, the C3 probably is sufficient.
B005IHAIMA,17,12,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,17,13,Manual adjustments....don't be scared....no problem.
B005IHAIMA,17,14,On top of that the camera has no AutoISO in full manual mode and AutoISO is limited to 100-3200.On a DSLR this is less of a problem since it's very quick to switch between A/S modes when the lighting changes.
B005IHAIMA,17,15,90% of my photos are in program mode so I don't even really adjust aperture or shutter.
B005IHAIMA,17,16,The camera is very fast to focus and shoot images.
B005IHAIMA,17,17,From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.
B005IHAIMA,17,18,Auto focus is near perfect in good light, and very good in low light.Macro with the kit zoom, using menu setting "Camera - AF/MF - DMF".  can give some pretty nice shots, but you will need to stay 9-10" away with this lens to focus.
B005IHAIMA,17,19,The camera makes using manual focus lenses a breeze using it's manual assist, and focus peaking settings.
B005IHAIMA,17,20,As someone who usually shoots in aperture priority or manual mode, I'm used to making all the exposure decisions for my photos.
B005IHAIMA,17,21,In shutter priority mode, it allows you to select shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,17,22,Auto ISO is available as an option.
B005IHAIMA,17,23,I have the 18-55mm and 55-210mm lenses.PROS* Sony's Focus Peaking feature makes manual focus really easy for manual first-timers like me.
B005IHAIMA,17,24,With the Canon S95 point-and-shoot, I can switch from Auto to Scene mode through the mode dial and then select HDR option (if I left it in HDR mode then I don't even have to scroll and I've switched to HDR mode in the flick of a dial).
B005IHAIMA,18,0,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,18,1,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,18,2,Very small lag on the shutter.
B005IHAIMA,18,3,They both involve the screen flickering about 1/2 second after you turn the camera off under different circumstances.
B005IHAIMA,18,4,(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,5,Simply hold down the button that you push to take pictures and this camera automatically shoots off in rapid fire mode.
B005IHAIMA,18,6,That's too long and really makes it useless when you need to be snapping multiple shots.
B005IHAIMA,18,7,It does take time to figure out the menues, but once you do you will find this camera very responsive with nearly no shutter lag.
B005IHAIMA,18,8,It takes 8 seconds for the camera to process and combine the 3 snaps into one.
B005IHAIMA,18,9,In evening events like volleyball and soccer, I used ISO 800 and 1600 to still get fast shutter to stop the action.
B005IHAIMA,18,10,Turned off face registration and smile shutter (located under "Set Up")Why: these options got in the way of a good photo compositionTRIPODI was able to use the tripod quick release I use for my SLR.
B005IHAIMA,18,11,So we changed it to that setting and spent awhile trying to make faces while partially pressing the shutter.
B005IHAIMA,18,12,Incredibly fast, small and powerful.
B005IHAIMA,18,13,The flash feeds off the main battery, which can be good and bad.
B005IHAIMA,18,14,There is no lag whatsoever from when the shutter is pressed and released!
B005IHAIMA,18,15,90% of my photos are in program mode so I don't even really adjust aperture or shutter.
B005IHAIMA,18,16,My Canon G12 is slow to focus.
B005IHAIMA,18,17,The record button is convenient, but also easy to press accidentally.
B005IHAIMA,18,18,It shoots so fast, just click and try the next setting up or down for aperture, shutter or ISO and then click again to see how it affects the picture (keeping in mind the camera will automatically adjust the other two for the correct amount of light)!
B005IHAIMA,18,19,The manual focus on that is slightly noisier, and it shows up if recording video, but that is literally the only complaint I have for this camera.
B005IHAIMA,18,20,The photos of people in costumes were very natural, without the usual harshness of directly firing at the subject.
B005IHAIMA,18,21,If you are like me and are trying to shoot little kids and pets that are constantly in motion, you may only have a split second to capture a smile or a moment when your kids or pets are actually looking at the camera.
B005IHAIMA,18,22,This is the camera I've been looking for for a long time.My camera does not suffer from the "clicking sound" some have trouble with during video shooting.Due to its very small size, there isn't room for a lot of buttons and dials, so most of the camera's settings have to be reached via a rather cumbersome on screen menu.
B005IHAIMA,18,23,Charging took about 4 hours (which is normal) and then the camera fired right up.You will be prompted to set the date & time right away and then you can start enjoying your new toy.When you turn the camera off, the shutter may operate.
B005IHAIMA,18,24,Note - it's important to take HDR photos when you don't have subjects moving (like people walking everywhere) since it essentially takes 3 snaps and combines it into one.
B005IHAIMA,19,0,Wish I bought the one with built in wifi.
B005IHAIMA,19,1,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,19,2,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,19,3,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,19,4,But, the photos it took were okay when small, but not so good on a bigger computer screen.
B005IHAIMA,19,5,I showed some of my first photos with the camera to a friend and she said that the pictures just "pop."The
B005IHAIMA,19,6,Now that Sony has fixed it, it's a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,19,7,Using this with Eye-Fi card, battery last about 160-200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,19,8,I dont want to play camera roulette when I want to buy a new product and waste my money and time guessing what will work.
B005IHAIMA,19,9,Well, there is, but it's a Sony proprietary slot-thing that is a pain in the neck to work with in the field.
B005IHAIMA,19,10,This camera puts forth such great, quality photos in auto mode that I usually do not have to do much editing to get a great picture to share.4)
B005IHAIMA,19,11,Perfect size, lots of features, takes great pictures, even when it is dark.
B005IHAIMA,19,12,But you probably already know that so I thought I'd mention a few of the cons... none of which would make me downgrade my rating, but could be important to you.CONS (The pros would take too long to write):- The battery takes FOREVER to charge, it took an hour on a new and empty batter just to get enough charge to format my SD card, overnight for a full charge.
B005IHAIMA,19,13,it can't be assessed as a cons but just compare photos few times and you can expect how they will differ on the computer screen.
B005IHAIMA,19,14,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,19,15,The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.
B005IHAIMA,19,16,Neither of these issues are enough for me to dock a star.
B005IHAIMA,19,17,(It should be no surprise that I love the image quality.)
B005IHAIMA,19,18,That is pretty common for digital cameras, but still a little disappointing considering the price of this camera.
B005IHAIMA,19,19,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,19,20,No more guessing and losing the perfect shot (happened so many times!) because 1/4 remaining battery equates to 2 percent!This is the first time that the auto modes actually work for me.
B005IHAIMA,19,21,But now from what i purchased from amazon at the end of 2011, my unit still has the video clicking issue, which means Sony is still pushing the old defective units to the market and you may get it from any dealers, includes Amazon.Mostly I only takes photos with my camera, but I do not wish to spend over 600 bucks for an defective product.
B005IHAIMA,19,22,You can use it for menu options but the font is tiny and its easier for me to click the actual buttons right next to it.Attachable flash - Some love it, some hate it, I don't care.The lens - It is a great kit lens, but pretty standard.
B005IHAIMA,19,23,This Sony is no SD1000 in size, but I got a small Sony case for the Sony NEX-5N and it is never in the way.It works great with my Eye-Fi card.
B005IHAIMA,19,24,good price and item! very good pictures taken by this camera, I'll get other lens to shot special pictures.
B005IHAIMA,20,0,Replaced my DSLR Canon Rebel XS with this Sony.
B005IHAIMA,20,1,I have for the last 10 years just had a canon powershot that I could put in my pocket.
B005IHAIMA,20,2,I upgraded my point and shoot to this Sony and couldn't be more pleased.
B005IHAIMA,20,3,I own the canon elph 300hs and the nikon d3100 and this by far beats both.
B005IHAIMA,20,4,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,20,5,Lets get too the point  !
B005IHAIMA,20,6,For about 10 years I have been using a digital P&S; as a second camera that I carry around.
B005IHAIMA,20,7,This is the camera that replaced my Canon DSLR.I went on a trip to the Canadians Rockies a few months ago.
B005IHAIMA,20,8,It shoots as good as my friends big canon camera and the focus is crispy and sharp.
B005IHAIMA,20,9,Compare it to your best Canon DSLR and see who wins.
B005IHAIMA,20,10,My last camera was a Canon Rebel, and I was ready to upgrade to something smaller.
B005IHAIMA,20,11,I've had a couple of DSLR's in the past 7 years and that is all I've shot with.
B005IHAIMA,20,12,Thanks Sony, you make me look like a better photographer than I am!
B005IHAIMA,20,13,With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.
B005IHAIMA,20,14,I've been a point and shoot girl up til now but I decided to buy the Sony to start getting more into photography.
B005IHAIMA,20,15,This was an upgrade from a Nikon P100 model.
B005IHAIMA,20,16,Although I do have some previous knoweledge and experience with DSLR cameras both digital and film.
B005IHAIMA,20,17,No problems at 1080p/24fps.Only regret is we didn't buy this a year ago.PROS:Amazing picture and video quality.
B005IHAIMA,20,18,have been looking to upgrade my P&S; for about a year now.
B005IHAIMA,20,19,I used this for well over year now, a lot, and I think it's great.
B005IHAIMA,20,20,Recently, I have seen more and more of my friends upgrade to DSLR; but that was not for me.
B005IHAIMA,20,21,Only took 250 shots so far.
B005IHAIMA,20,22,We were working with the 18-55 lens and also the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,20,23,This is my first real venture into something more than a point and shoot (though I did have a very short stint with a Rebel a year or so ago but felt overwhelmed.)
B005IHAIMA,20,24,Much lighter and smaller than a DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,21,0,Not exactly portable/pocket with the kit lens attached--you may have to get the 16mm pancake lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,1,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.
B005IHAIMA,21,2,I cleaned the lens and sensor, but the spots remained.
B005IHAIMA,21,3,A dust cap was placed over the sensor opening for shipment, but otherwise, as far as I can tell nothing was done to it.
B005IHAIMA,21,4,I wish the lens cap had a leash.
B005IHAIMA,21,5,bought UV filter and Len cap string because the cap came without a string.Thanks all reviewers contribution, and thanks dpreview.com
B005IHAIMA,21,6,camera shipped with kit lens attached to the body, so NO rear lens cap and NO body cap are supplied.
B005IHAIMA,21,7,I can't return the camera but I will return the 18-200 lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,8,The lens is a little bulky but hasn't been an issue.
B005IHAIMA,21,9,The screen turns blue and flashes 'camera error'.
B005IHAIMA,21,10,To combat this, you need to hold the adapter or lens with your left hand.
B005IHAIMA,21,11,The clicking problem persists and I'm not sure the camera case was even opened.
B005IHAIMA,21,12,With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,13,The spots were more definite when the lens I was using was stopped down below f10.
B005IHAIMA,21,14,I did not have time to confirm this.FIRST USEOnce the battery was fully charged, I reinstalled it into the camera and attached the 50mm E-Mount lens (SEL50F18).
B005IHAIMA,21,15,I also bought 16mm lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,16,So I bought the NEX-5N with the 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,17,But the camera error message came back on while I was on vacation.
B005IHAIMA,21,18,You should have no problem trying to get "that shot" if this adapter is part of your system.PRACTICALITYI would assume that the average user who purchased this camera with the 18-55mm lens (and possibly the 55-210mm lens) would not be disappointed.
B005IHAIMA,21,19,I purchased the kit with the 18-55m lens and the camera takes flawless shots.
B005IHAIMA,21,20,The only thing is that the lens cap has no string or anything, so I have to be careful where I put it and not leave it on the table or something.
B005IHAIMA,21,21,By the way, the 18-55 len is a little heavy.
B005IHAIMA,21,22,In addition to the kit lens (18-55), which I found satisfactory but sold to make room for the wide angle and super zoom (55-200).
B005IHAIMA,21,23,If you like NEX-5, then... Having used Sony NEX-5 since May (2011), I was turned off by the drawbacks with the 18-55mm kit lens, mainly the barrel distortion and chromatic aberration.
B005IHAIMA,21,24,For a kit lens, I am impressed.
B005IHAIMA,22,0,Very good camera and a very good image.
B005IHAIMA,22,1,Other than that, it is a great camera especially in low light.
B005IHAIMA,22,2,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,22,3,Low light...no problem.
B005IHAIMA,22,4,I can't believe how good this thing is in low light conditions.
B005IHAIMA,22,5,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,22,6,Even video taken in low light can look good.
B005IHAIMA,22,7,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,22,8,Picture quality is excellent especially low light pics.
B005IHAIMA,22,9,Even at night with nothing but moon light.
B005IHAIMA,22,10,Low light shots are amazing so far.
B005IHAIMA,22,11,I just like to recomand this camera, he is great and a very good price.
B005IHAIMA,22,12,Good.
B005IHAIMA,22,13,Good detail.
B005IHAIMA,22,14,Almost Great.
B005IHAIMA,22,15,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,22,16,This sensitivity means you can shoot without flash much of the time, even indoors and in low light.
B005IHAIMA,22,17,The camera is very easy to use and picture quality is very sharp with true color.
B005IHAIMA,22,18,I have been able to take low light shots, indoor, sunny outdoor, nighttime etc. without any issues.
B005IHAIMA,22,19,Also, it is very light in weight which helps.The color accuracy is very good.
B005IHAIMA,22,20,It is still going strong and we use it all the time without fail it takes the nicest photos with the least amount of out of focus shots I have ever had.
B005IHAIMA,22,21,Every photo is so crisp.
B005IHAIMA,22,22,Still, you can get great shots at extremely low light with amazing color that was just not possible at this price range until now.The kit lens is good and much better than I expected based upon some of the reviews I read.
B005IHAIMA,22,23,Takes great low light photos- I rarely use the flash with this camera.
B005IHAIMA,22,24,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.
B005IHAIMA,23,0,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.
B005IHAIMA,23,1,You can bet that when I buy another camera, it will be from Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,2,Too bad I have to return it to Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,3,I have returned the product.
B005IHAIMA,23,4,Why the still sell this camera ???Don't buy it !
B005IHAIMA,23,5,Buy it only if you want jacketable camera.
B005IHAIMA,23,6,Amazon was very good to me when I had to return once before (no strings), but if I had to do this now for clicking or suspicion, I'll have to pay for return shipment to Cameta.
B005IHAIMA,23,7,I bought the Canon T3i and returned, Sony A65 and returned again.
B005IHAIMA,23,8,I'm returning the camera to day to Best Buy.DO THE RIGHT THING SONY, RECALL YOUR DEFECTIVE CAMERA!DO THE RIGHT THING BEST BUY, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!DO THE RIGHT THING AMAZON, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!
B005IHAIMA,23,9,Why Is Amazon still selling defective models of this camera?
B005IHAIMA,23,10,helped me made my final decision.Last year bought Panasonic FZ280 and Nikon 3100 end up returned them all and wait to last Christmas.
B005IHAIMA,23,11,Do NOT BUY - DEFECTIVE.
B005IHAIMA,23,12,I have waited to buy it for a long time.
B005IHAIMA,23,13,UPDATE: 21 FEB 2012: Amazon appears to be looking into this issue now - I believe they are intercepting/checking my return to verify this problem.
B005IHAIMA,23,14,Unfortunately, I also see a lot of people return these cameras because they're too big/complicated/expensive.
B005IHAIMA,23,15,This is REALLY disappointing and as much as I wanted to buy this camera, I will not and do not recommend to do so.
B005IHAIMA,23,16,I purchased the Sony NEX-5N and I am returning it.
B005IHAIMA,23,17,When I got back home, I decided to just get a replacement from Amazon, because I still liked the camera design and was hoping that I just had a lemon.
B005IHAIMA,23,18,You then have to argue with Sony about replacing the new camera you sent to them for repair - good luck with that.
B005IHAIMA,23,19,What's going on with Sony?
B005IHAIMA,23,20,I can't return the camera but I will return the 18-200 lens.
B005IHAIMA,23,21,I bought my NEX-5N from Amazon and it arrived promptly on 10/17/2012.
B005IHAIMA,23,22,I just bought it two days ago and received it today.
B005IHAIMA,23,23,I wasn't going to deal with the NEX-5n any more, so I returned it for a refund.
B005IHAIMA,23,24,(Due to where I live I couldn't buy it on Amazon and get it shipped to me when I needed it by.)I've
B005IHAIMA,24,0,Easy control and settings with touch screen.
B005IHAIMA,24,1,This change has made me more willing to learn and adopt to the different sets of controls in these cameras.
B005IHAIMA,24,2,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,24,3,With that being said, the touchscreen menu is rather fool/idiot-proof because there are instructions on each menu and even helpful tips on how that function would be useful.
B005IHAIMA,24,4,Touchscreen menu is not as confusing as some people said.
B005IHAIMA,24,5,I didnt even get a users manual with mine and it only took me 20minutes to go through all the menus and adjust settings to my liking.
B005IHAIMA,24,6,The help menu does really help with basic use of the camera.
B005IHAIMA,24,7,If you're someone that doesn't care to learn the manual settings of a camera, this camera has a lot of automatic functions to choose from but it has great manual functions as well.
B005IHAIMA,24,8,You can set the controls to hot keys for easy access.
B005IHAIMA,24,9,Under the "Setup" Menu", one can proceed to the Custom Key Settings.
B005IHAIMA,24,10,With a quick button push and Sony's well thought out basic controls, I can quickly get to and change the settings I most often access.
B005IHAIMA,24,11,This wheel delves deeper into the menu option for specific functions.
B005IHAIMA,24,12,My mindset is essentially that of learning and adopting to the different camera controls rather than one wanting to maintain a consistent set of controls among the different cameras.
B005IHAIMA,24,13,It's easy to use and takes beautiful photos, even on the automatic setting.
B005IHAIMA,24,14,It's simple, just switch to the Menu mode and then select Brightness/Color and ISO setting is right there.
B005IHAIMA,24,15,I like that you can set up to 5 menu items under a custom button and switch things fast.
B005IHAIMA,24,16,From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.
B005IHAIMA,24,17,Even though you can access most menu items through the physical dial and buttons, the touch screen works very fast.
B005IHAIMA,24,18,90 degrees up is a godsend for a variety of situations.THE NEUTRAL:The menu system takes a bit of getting used to, but once learned, is fairly easy to navigate.
B005IHAIMA,24,19,Menu is a little confusing for beginner.
B005IHAIMA,24,20,Sony, if you read these Amazon reviews, please add the option to control shooting mode from the bottom-right button on the camera!
B005IHAIMA,24,21,I did setup the custom buttons which make the usage easy.
B005IHAIMA,24,22,Sony has two features in the NEX-5N which makes manual focusing easy.
B005IHAIMA,24,23,I think the camera and lens looks comical.The menus - They make sense, but for the sake of simplicity with the button layout, sometimes you have to go in and out of the menus to get the settings you want.
B005IHAIMA,24,24,I'd love more buttons and dials for quick access.
B005IHAIMA,25,0,Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012.
B005IHAIMA,25,1,Video "clicking" noise issue fixed.
B005IHAIMA,25,2,Don't buy this camera.
B005IHAIMA,25,3,Be aware if you want to use it to make home video.
B005IHAIMA,25,4,I have to explain that the camera has already been sent in for that issue and that the problem is something else.
B005IHAIMA,25,5,DO NOT BUY UNTIL SONY ADDRESSES CLICKING ISSUE.
B005IHAIMA,25,6,Video defect is not the only problem.
B005IHAIMA,25,7,Sony is finally acknowledging the problem just not saying what it is and if the fix will completely fix the problem.
B005IHAIMA,25,8,The key concern is the video "clicking" noise issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,9,M. F. Click issue is a big problem for this product.
B005IHAIMA,25,10,No Sequential Ordering for Video Files!!!
B005IHAIMA,25,11,Sony fails with NEX-5N, video with click out of the box.
B005IHAIMA,25,12,Still Clicking Sound.
B005IHAIMA,25,13,No problems at 1080p/24fps.Only regret is we didn't buy this a year ago.PROS:Amazing picture and video quality.
B005IHAIMA,25,14,I thought SONY has fixed the clicking noise problem in the most recent product.
B005IHAIMA,25,15,Shame on you Sony.
B005IHAIMA,25,16,Sony is aware of the problem and has developed a fix.
B005IHAIMA,25,17,Still has the click noise when shooting video.
B005IHAIMA,25,18,and canon fd 75-200mm lenses.The clicking issue was fixed by Sony in 5 days.
B005IHAIMA,25,19,The clicking is still an issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,20,My next camera will probably be a Nikon or a Canon, from a company that actually takes pride in their cameras.
B005IHAIMA,25,21,I wanted it for the video quality.
B005IHAIMA,25,22,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,25,23,Sony must give all us who face the problem a new camera because how I now can be sure that 1) the camera will be really fixed and 2) the fix is permanent and it does not fail after 2 months again.
B005IHAIMA,25,24,You buy a $600 camera and the stupid developers can't even implement sequential file numbers for video files--only photos.
B002IPHIEG,0,0,battery life5.-touch
B002IPHIEG,0,1,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,0,2,It did this with the battery that came with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,0,3,I used it as soon as I got the battery charged - and that, the battery, is the only thing I can say is a slight negative.
B002IPHIEG,0,4,Battery life could be better.
B002IPHIEG,0,5,It is not unusual to go through two batteries in an hour or two, even when they are fully charged.
B002IPHIEG,0,6,It's also super-portable and has an awesome battery life.
B002IPHIEG,0,7,The battery has a decent life as well.
B002IPHIEG,0,8,As soon as the battery charged, I started using the camera.
B002IPHIEG,0,9,Battery does not last as long as the old Sony I have (T-3 and T-30)2.
B002IPHIEG,0,10,If I had it to do over, I would not buy a camera with a touchscreen.One other thing--this thing eats batteries.
B002IPHIEG,0,11,Battery life seems pretty good.So what's not to like about this camera?1.
B002IPHIEG,0,12,I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.
B002IPHIEG,0,13,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,0,14,Its battery charger requires only two hours.
B002IPHIEG,0,15,Furthermore, surely, SONY could ALSO enable battery charging from the USB.6)
B002IPHIEG,0,16,The battery lasts super long.
B002IPHIEG,0,17,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,0,18,The battery charger is well designed with no cord so it is easy to carry around.
B002IPHIEG,0,19,I used to always buy Casio for my point and shoots, my SLR is also a NIKON but I've only heard great things about Sony from my friends only downside being the battery life so I made sure to buy an extra battery...apparently they've improved on that issue and the battery life has been fine.
B002IPHIEG,0,20,The battery door is flimsy.-Hard
B002IPHIEG,0,21,Long story short, outdoor pics were great, the camera size was excellent, and battery life was out of this world.
B002IPHIEG,0,22,Only downside... battery only lasts about 80 minutes, but generics are cheap.
B002IPHIEG,0,23,We used it on our vacation to Washington DC and it and the battery would last all day.Well worth the investment.
B002IPHIEG,0,24,My only negative is it didn't have a Memory Stick included.The battery doesn't last as long as the T100.
B002IPHIEG,1,0,Love the touch screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,1,It also has a touch screen feature which I'm not so fond of.
B002IPHIEG,1,2,That screen is easy to maneuver around.
B002IPHIEG,1,3,Screen delamination or is it moisture haze?
B002IPHIEG,1,4,The touch screen is so easy to use and the camera fits anywhere.
B002IPHIEG,1,5,The touch screen is very sensitive.
B002IPHIEG,1,6,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.
B002IPHIEG,1,7,Some people might not like the touch screen, but it's actually quite easy to manipulate.
B002IPHIEG,1,8,The screen is about as easy to navigate as you could ask for.
B002IPHIEG,1,9,The screen gets smudged so easily.
B002IPHIEG,1,10,The touch screen is very intuitive and responsive.
B002IPHIEG,1,11,This is my first touch screen camera and I was hesitant.
B002IPHIEG,1,12,Great Little Camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,13,The Large LCD screen is Spectacular as is the color in the photos.
B002IPHIEG,1,14,But, I'm really glad I have both of them because they each have some very positive features.UPDATE 7/20/12: From the beginning, the touch screen had an unusual look as if a screen protector was on it.
B002IPHIEG,1,15,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,1,16,Great camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,17,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,18,The important thing is to not touch the adhesive.
B002IPHIEG,1,19,These images needed to impress on a 67" HD screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,20,Being touch screen, it is a different excitement.
B002IPHIEG,1,21,The Sony "touch screen" only gets a 3 rating.
B002IPHIEG,1,22,When your shots look good on the view screen, they will be even more pleasing on a correctly calibrated HD monitor.2) The white balance options never seem to look right on the view screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,23,Love it.
B002IPHIEG,1,24,But the Touch Screen drove me crazy.
B002IPHIEG,2,0,The Best point and shoot for the technology challenged!
B002IPHIEG,2,1,If you are "technology challenged" then this camera will do all the work for you and make you look like a pro!
B002IPHIEG,2,2,This one, with the exception of a F/3.1 lens (why not 2.8 or better?), seems to answer all my prayers with a price point under $350.SONY.... THEY'RE ALL ABOUT GIMMICKS AND LACK OF TRUE PERFORMANCE.
B002IPHIEG,2,3,Even in auto mode, the Canon took consistently good pictures, important when handing your camera to someone to shoot your picture.
B002IPHIEG,2,4,For people who look for good image quality, stay away from it until the 1st firmware upgrade comes along and see if Sony fixed some issues such as display and image compression.
B002IPHIEG,2,5,Good but poor autofocus.
B002IPHIEG,2,6,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,2,7,About the video be sure and buy a fast chip if you want good video Sony pro duo is a bit to slow for action shots.
B002IPHIEG,2,8,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,2,9,The Canon has faster glass (f/2.0),
B002IPHIEG,2,10,(No kidding) The video feature is really awesome, and I believe it is better than most of the "cheap" video camera out there.
B002IPHIEG,2,11,The images did not have good focus; they just weren't sharp and the color was not nearly as good as other point and shoot camera I have or am very familiar with.
B002IPHIEG,2,12,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,2,13,I loved all of the features of this camera but the first thing that i care about is quality of photos which this camera has lack of it.
B002IPHIEG,2,14,I replaced a Canon SD1400IS with this one, because I have two little kids, and needed a super fast focusing camera to keep from missing shots.
B002IPHIEG,2,15,Takes great (not perfect) pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,2,16,Excellent buy for its price; a really good little camera.
B002IPHIEG,2,17,It is definitely NOT a pro camera, but it out performs most any point and shoot camera on the market currently.
B002IPHIEG,2,18,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,2,19,The picture and video quality is very high in terms of resolution, but this is a digital camera, not a DSLR, so of course you get issues with focusing and lighting and so on, so it's probably a 3/5 in terms of absolute camera quality.
B002IPHIEG,2,20,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,2,21,Just amazing in photo and video quality..
B002IPHIEG,2,22,It does take better photos in low light, but overall picture quality for an amateur user isn't that great.
B002IPHIEG,2,23,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,2,24,Also, I don't like that you have to be in 4:3 mode to get the full 10 mp but I think that's just an area of the picture issue (I love shooting in 16:9 . . .
B002IPHIEG,3,0,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,3,1,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,3,2,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,3,3,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!
B002IPHIEG,3,4,I use it for my blog and the picture quality and audio are great.
B002IPHIEG,3,5,This is not the zooming sound.
B002IPHIEG,3,6,720p video, great audio quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,7,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,8,Oh, and the video quality is awesome as well.
B002IPHIEG,3,9,Better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,10,The mono-microphone is pretty sensitive and provides a good sound quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,11,I didn't see the need for it.VIDEO:
B002IPHIEG,3,12,Recording HD movie were also disappointing, when you are recording you can actually hear sound of zooming and focusing when you play them back.
B002IPHIEG,3,13,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,3,14,Vedio quality is great as well.
B002IPHIEG,3,15,Video is usually okay, but has two major problems... First, the noise of zooming in and out is recorded very loudly.
B002IPHIEG,3,16,Date Stamp is done with the PMB software.HD video quality is actually better than the DMC-ZS3 AVCHD-lite.
B002IPHIEG,3,17,There is static noise when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,3,18,Horrible picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,19,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,3,20,The camera is great for the functionality, clear photos and movies and the price was right.
B002IPHIEG,3,21,With video recording, I was very happy to finally be able to zoom in and out while recording, however, I am not happy that it records in mp4 format.
B002IPHIEG,3,22,The video function works great but I wish I  had  a mike I could plug in for better sound.
B002IPHIEG,3,23,I dont know if its my camera but this camera kinda sucks at recording, becuz whenever i record it makes a sound in the background recording and its really annoying.
B002IPHIEG,3,24,Although the sound is MONO compared to ZS3's Stereo, but the video quality and easy to work with editing software make up the difference!
B002IPHIEG,4,0,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,1,If your looking for a quick easy point and shoot, this camera is for you.
B002IPHIEG,4,2,What shots I took!
B002IPHIEG,4,3,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,4,4,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,4,5,Really good camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,6,This is a great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,7,You need to know what mode to be in to get a good shot and, as an amateur, I am not always sure what to do.
B002IPHIEG,4,8,Best point and shoot available.
B002IPHIEG,4,9,I'm strictly point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,4,10,an excellent point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,4,11,But how often do you spin around in circles taking pano shots?
B002IPHIEG,4,12,Otherwise this is a great little camera with nice features.
B002IPHIEG,4,13,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,14,If you have low light though, it is capable of giving you some great shots.
B002IPHIEG,4,15,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,4,16,I purchased this camera for the Panorama mode, and low light shooting.
B002IPHIEG,4,17,Great low light pictures!
B002IPHIEG,4,18,Such a great camera!
B002IPHIEG,4,19,Great size and lots of features.
B002IPHIEG,4,20,Just shot my first panoramas and have come out excellent.
B002IPHIEG,4,21,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,4,22,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,4,23,It has an anti blur mode meaning that it shoots 5 shots and blends them into one to create one great picture.
B002IPHIEG,4,24,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,5,0,Its shot response more fast than I think.
B002IPHIEG,5,1,Focus is fast.
B002IPHIEG,5,2,The processing time is fast, very fast.
B002IPHIEG,5,3,Maybe I wasn't doing it right but they didn't seem to help much.The best bet for action and fast moving subjects with this camera seems to be the burst mode, which rips off 10 shots one after another when the shutter is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,5,4,With that, I will clear up problems previous owners have had.First, I'm sure all of you want to know how good the new Exmor R sensor is.
B002IPHIEG,5,5,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,5,6,VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE: Great Camera!
B002IPHIEG,5,7,There are some issues with over exposure at times, but in general I love this camera.
B002IPHIEG,5,8,Taking pictures with this camera is so much fun.Because it is so thin and light, pressing the shutter release button without adding shake to the shot takes a very steady hand.
B002IPHIEG,5,9,I love this camera.
B002IPHIEG,5,10,I was so amazed in the difference!!  See my photos above![...]After 3 weeks of waiting for this camera to be released I now have it in my hands and taken over 500 pictures.
B002IPHIEG,5,11,If you could control the shutter (which you can't) you might be able to get this camera to better stop action.
B002IPHIEG,5,12,Great camera.
B002IPHIEG,5,13,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,5,14,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,5,15,On the other hand a recent review of the upcoming S90 indicated that even with a fast lens and manual controls (allowing you to set the shutter) it wasn't fast enough for action, sports and kids.
B002IPHIEG,5,16,See for yourself: [...].What's the point of the best picture quality you missed capturing the moment because of poor shutter lag?2) Excellent battery life.
B002IPHIEG,5,17,I rather prefer to use the 2-second timer, which gives me just enough time after pressing the button to steady up the focus frame on my subject.
B002IPHIEG,5,18,It's pretty good, WITH THE RIGHT SETTINGS.
B002IPHIEG,5,19,If its zoom hadn't given out after many active years, I'd still shoot with it.
B002IPHIEG,5,20,Shots are going to be grainier than when you shoot with your D300 - such is life.No camera's perfect, but when you hold this thing, you can't help but think of what a miracle it would look like to someone from even ten years ago.
B002IPHIEG,5,21,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.
B002IPHIEG,5,22,There are some things I love about this camera--the size (fits in my pocket), the quality of shots when it is working properly, the burst feature.There is one thing that is so frustrating, it knocked off two stars.
B002IPHIEG,5,23,Instead it takes ... 3 to 5 seconds because you have to wait for the current photo to be processed and then wait wait wait to press the review button and if you press it twice ... oops, your still in picture-taking mode.
B002IPHIEG,5,24,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,6,0,With the card (which does not come included) and the camera, it runs up to $450.
B002IPHIEG,6,1,Newer models can use either a Sony card or SD card.
B002IPHIEG,6,2,Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.
B002IPHIEG,6,3,I am also annoyed that you have to purchase Sony's licensed memory card.
B002IPHIEG,6,4,You can upgrade your video card, but that is expensive and doesn't even work that well.
B002IPHIEG,6,5,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.
B002IPHIEG,6,6,No HDMI.Expensive Memory Stick Duo.
B002IPHIEG,6,7,This model has to have Sony card.
B002IPHIEG,6,8,Since my other cameras have been Sony cameras, I have already had memory stick cards and readers, so to me, its not a big deal.
B002IPHIEG,6,9,It's annoying that it only takes the proprietary (and expensive) Sony memory stick instead of the usual SD card that all my other cameras have used, but that's not too big a deal.
B002IPHIEG,6,10,great camera.
B002IPHIEG,6,11,Taking HD Video takes up so much space on the memory card.
B002IPHIEG,6,12,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,6,13,There are some quirks with this camera which I wanted to point out.GOOD- Photo Quality - Others cover this so I wont go into it, but basically the photos are very good.BAD- Sony USB Cable - This is proprietary SONY cable, so you have to carry it around with you if you want to download photos from the directly from the camera without removing the Memory Stick.
B002IPHIEG,6,14,If you have had other cameras that used SD, just think of making a $20 investment into a very reliable, fast card for your camera, and use the SD card in your Wii.The only two complaints I have for this camera are it's low light picture taking, and the format it uses when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,6,15,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,6,16,We do a lot of socializing and it's nice to have something easy to record the memories.
B002IPHIEG,6,17,The only thing is that it is not supplied with a HDMI cable as standard..........
B002IPHIEG,6,18,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,6,19,Incidentally, the newest duo "pro" cards are not compatible with some older readers even if they accommodate Sony cards.... go figure.4)
B002IPHIEG,6,20,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,6,21,I had high hopes for this Sony, and even went to the trouble of buying a 16GB Memory Stick Duo (hate their proprietary attitude) and an extra battery.
B002IPHIEG,6,22,Now the SD cards have finally caught up to the speed of the MS.
B002IPHIEG,6,23,I bought an 8 gig card for it and it seems adequate so far.This is a great product that has really worked well for me.
B002IPHIEG,6,24,Overall: If you are interested in a small, light, good looking and compact point-and-forget camera that makes ok pictures, this camera might work for you.
B002IPHIEG,7,0,Great Little Pocket Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,1,Great little digital.
B002IPHIEG,7,2,Great
B002IPHIEG,7,3,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,4,A great camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,5,Great camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,6,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,7,7,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,8,Very small (fits in a pocket) and very easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,7,9,Great pocket camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,10,I wanted a compact camera to be able to take pictures and then put it in my pocket, and this one is perfect.
B002IPHIEG,7,11,This Sony camera is a great small portable digital camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,12,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,7,13,Overall, best digital camera I have used.
B002IPHIEG,7,14,So far, it is working great for me.
B002IPHIEG,7,15,Great size and lots of features.
B002IPHIEG,7,16,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,7,17,I was looking for better zoom while still maintaining the compact feel.
B002IPHIEG,7,18,Best compact digital camera I've owned so far!
B002IPHIEG,7,19,This is a great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,20,Nice Small Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,21,Great Pocket Camera With A Little Tinkering.
B002IPHIEG,7,22,The camera size is perfect for carrying in your pack or cargo pocket (it's a little large for reg.
B002IPHIEG,7,23,It is very light and easy to carry.
B002IPHIEG,7,24,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,8,0,As a former owner of a Sony A700 with 16-80mm Carl z lenses, plus a whole bag of long range lenses.
B002IPHIEG,8,1,It just is TOO small.
B002IPHIEG,8,2,Former DSLR owner.
B002IPHIEG,8,3,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,8,4,I would like to thank my boss who pushed me to buy this 24mm wide angle lense camera.Panoramic feature is also great.
B002IPHIEG,8,5,I love this camera!GREAT THINGS about this: The slim design with a built-in cover to protect the lens instead of needing a lens cap is great.
B002IPHIEG,8,6,I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon.
B002IPHIEG,8,7,The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90.
B002IPHIEG,8,8,The 24mm f2.4 lens is it's best feature, don't let anyone else fool you.
B002IPHIEG,8,9,The image quality is not going to be as good as a larger camera with a non-folded lens system and a bigger sensor.
B002IPHIEG,8,10,Good Camera- 24mm wide angle is amazing.
B002IPHIEG,8,11,Love the low light feature.
B002IPHIEG,8,12,Lens distortion is amazingly low, even at wide angle.+
B002IPHIEG,8,13,Dealing with toting all that stuff around, cleaning lenses, I finally got sick of it and sold everything on eBay and bought this camera, sure the image quality will never touch the A700 DSLR but I find the joy of photography is having a camera always with you.
B002IPHIEG,8,14,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,8,15,The aesthetics of the camera is not very great, I would love to see some design elements in it for the camera at this price.I would recommend this camera to anyone who can manage to spend little extra money to buy this 24mm wide lense, its worth it.
B002IPHIEG,8,16,You'd expect excellent quality with normal lighting, but it's more like above average for the price range and lens.
B002IPHIEG,8,17,No manual controls.The W300 had full manual controls, and I wonder why Sony couldn't have included them here and really made this a top of the line point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,8,18,I dont think I will get back into DSLR due to the bulky, expensive, complex (think dust on your sensor from lens changing).The price of $259 is mind blowing too given all these features.
B002IPHIEG,8,19,Perhaps we may get to see interchangeable lenses on future compact cameras.
B002IPHIEG,8,20,While the Sony was good, the Canon was the clear winner here.
B002IPHIEG,8,21,Light and small for the lens range.3)
B002IPHIEG,8,22,The quality of photos are exceptional, nice small size, solid build, a great package.
B002IPHIEG,8,23,It is not the same package of everything you have with your DSLR and collection of lenses shrunk down to something the size of a couple of packs of gum.
B002IPHIEG,8,24,back-light Exmor-R CMOS sensor sounds great, but is just does not deliver what Sony promised in terms of noticeably better image quality in low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,0,Image quality was not what I expected.
B002IPHIEG,9,1,Still image and print quality are very important to me.
B002IPHIEG,9,2,Contrary to some reviews, the image quality has been oustanding.
B002IPHIEG,9,3,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,9,4,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,9,5,For me, it was all about picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,6,It can take 6 consecutive pictures at once, and stack them together to get a high detailed picture, without showing the usual grainy high iso result.
B002IPHIEG,9,7,Excellent low lighting performance.
B002IPHIEG,9,8,The low light pictures were much better then any other camera I have owned.
B002IPHIEG,9,9,The low light capability was good, but not that much better than my Sony H20.
B002IPHIEG,9,10,The big disappointmet was the bright light image quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,11,The other disappointment is the low light image quality which is supposed to be much better than average.
B002IPHIEG,9,12,Slightly better at low light but terrible with good light.
B002IPHIEG,9,13,You'd expect excellent quality with normal lighting, but it's more like above average for the price range and lens.
B002IPHIEG,9,14,Disappointing image quality a deal breaker.
B002IPHIEG,9,15,Photo quality under poor light conditions is amazing; photos are better than expected.
B002IPHIEG,9,16,It worked better than I expected!
B002IPHIEG,9,17,Especially impressive was the low light performance.
B002IPHIEG,9,18,I expected a lot more from this camera than it delivers in terms of image quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,19,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,9,20,However, while not a "pixel peeper", I do care about the quality of the image.
B002IPHIEG,9,21,Low light shots were noisier than my Fuji.
B002IPHIEG,9,22,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,9,23,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,9,24,The images did not have good focus; they just weren't sharp and the color was not nearly as good as other point and shoot camera I have or am very familiar with.
B002IPHIEG,10,0,Great Camera for price.
B002IPHIEG,10,1,she loves it.
B002IPHIEG,10,2,Elegant looking camera, love it!
B002IPHIEG,10,3,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,4,Such a great camera!
B002IPHIEG,10,5,For the price the camera is defiantly worth it i recommend it 100%
B002IPHIEG,10,6,good features for the price.
B002IPHIEG,10,7,Excellent buy for its price; a really good little camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,8,great camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,9,Vedio quality is great as well.
B002IPHIEG,10,10,not easy making a 16 year old happy, but this does it.
B002IPHIEG,10,11,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,10,12,Love it.
B002IPHIEG,10,13,I really love this camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,14,I LOVED it!
B002IPHIEG,10,15,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,10,16,Okay, I really loved this camera and the picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,10,17,He loved it!
B002IPHIEG,10,18,Not worth the price.
B002IPHIEG,10,19,I mean NOTHING.CAMERA NOT RECOMMENDED.
B002IPHIEG,10,20,This is a great camera, Ive had it now for over a month andn it's very easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,10,21,What a great camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,22,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,10,23,Great camera only one thing you need to know.
B002IPHIEG,10,24,Highly recommend this product.
B002IPHIEG,11,0,Great Little Camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,1,However, it is very easy to use and the instruction booklet is great.
B002IPHIEG,11,2,Great features, simple and easy to use settings.
B002IPHIEG,11,3,It has great quality picutres, easy to use, fast, etc!
B002IPHIEG,11,4,Wasn't looking for dslr quality, but something that looked  nice would be useful.
B002IPHIEG,11,5,A great camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,6,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,7,The camera is easy to use, not too many buttons that you'll never use.
B002IPHIEG,11,8,So far, it is working great for me.
B002IPHIEG,11,9,The quality of photos are exceptional, nice small size, solid build, a great package.
B002IPHIEG,11,10,I'm not a techno wizard, but this camera is pretty easy to use (I do suggest reading the manual because the camera has lots of cool functions) and the photo quality is great.
B002IPHIEG,11,11,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,11,12,Great size and lots of features.
B002IPHIEG,11,13,I found it amazingly easy to use with just that little bit of reading.
B002IPHIEG,11,14,It is very intuitive, and easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,11,15,Great Camera for price.
B002IPHIEG,11,16,Easy to carry and handle.
B002IPHIEG,11,17,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,11,18,Very easy to use and great options!
B002IPHIEG,11,19,As others have commented, you really do need to read the manual, experiment with the settings, and learn how to get the best results with it.But no one should be buying this camera because they want the best possible picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,11,20,It takes pictures quickly, and the quality of the shots is usually excellent.
B002IPHIEG,11,21,It is very light and easy to carry.
B002IPHIEG,11,22,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,11,23,It's perfect for what I bought it for, and if you read the manual and learn how to use it, you'll get great results.
B002IPHIEG,11,24,The controls are pretty intuitive and easy for an amateur like me to figure out.
B002IPHIEG,12,0,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,12,1,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,12,2,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,12,3,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,12,4,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,12,5,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!
B002IPHIEG,12,6,Just amazing in photo and video quality..
B002IPHIEG,12,7,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,12,8,Another good Sony camera.
B002IPHIEG,12,9,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,12,10,The video quality is exceptional for a camera of this size as well.
B002IPHIEG,12,11,I love it!
B002IPHIEG,12,12,If you're buying it primarily for great pictures you should look at other cameras.
B002IPHIEG,12,13,It's amazing!
B002IPHIEG,12,14,All in all I really love this camera and recommend it for video or stills.
B002IPHIEG,12,15,The video quality is excellent.
B002IPHIEG,12,16,Such a great camera!
B002IPHIEG,12,17,Sorry Sony.
B002IPHIEG,12,18,Sorry Sony!
B002IPHIEG,12,19,Sorry Sony.
B002IPHIEG,12,20,Sorry Sony!
B002IPHIEG,12,21,If you plan on taking any video you will def.
B002IPHIEG,12,22,Certain features of this camera have greatly impressed me.
B002IPHIEG,12,23,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,12,24,The Panorama features, HD video, and other features make this a no brainer.
B002IPHIEG,13,0,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,13,1,Bought the camera and just before one year, the battery cover door broke -not due to mistreating-.
B002IPHIEG,13,2,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,3,battery cover can break in one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,4,It did this with the battery that came with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,13,5,When I got home from my 7 day trip, I realized that the first 5 days of my vacation had been deleted without my even knowing it.
B002IPHIEG,13,6,Its great if you want Non-Flash photos and are frequently turning the camera off/on in between shots.BAD- Battery Cover - The battery cover seems very flimsy and bows a bit if you hold the camera by it.
B002IPHIEG,13,7,I did this at least a couple of times.
B002IPHIEG,13,8,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,13,9,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,13,10,Battery door easily opened.
B002IPHIEG,13,11,With the first 100 pictures of my trip gone I decided I didn't want to be stressed out every time I ask someone to take a picture of us, not to mention the stress of keeping myself from doing it.
B002IPHIEG,13,12,Had this camera for about a month now - its a fine camera and has the usual settings/functions as mentioned by others.
B002IPHIEG,13,13,So far it has worked really well.
B002IPHIEG,13,14,It just works.
B002IPHIEG,13,15,This camera worked beautifully.
B002IPHIEG,13,16,This camera arrived 2 days before I left on vacation.
B002IPHIEG,13,17,Quick and once you get use to the touch screen easy to use! Just took this pocket rocket to San Diego on a trip and it turned out some very good shots in low light and regular day time lighting.
B002IPHIEG,13,18,Just back from Antigua vacation.
B002IPHIEG,13,19,Second, I also had a secondary reason for this camera, for a vacation.
B002IPHIEG,13,20,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,13,21,Now the camera powers on and stays on.Unfortunately, my problems were not over.
B002IPHIEG,13,22,I bought the camera last week and took shots for a few hours and compared against my relatively old Fuji Finepix f40fd.The good:1) Cool features.
B002IPHIEG,13,23,But my camera broke down last summer after years of use on vacations (at beaches and on the run), and I was forced to get a new camera.
B002IPHIEG,13,24,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,14,0,Screen delamination or is it moisture haze?
B002IPHIEG,14,1,The camera is all touch screen and is more of an iPod Touch feel to it.
B002IPHIEG,14,2,The LCD screen is adjustable todeal with the brightness of the environment.
B002IPHIEG,14,3,The only bad point I have found....is sometimes I hit the touch screen when I am taking the picture and this changes my setting.
B002IPHIEG,14,4,No bevel to the LCD frame.
B002IPHIEG,14,5,Most of the time with the WX1 I really can't make out what's on the screen, because to me its all out of focus (the problem is my eyes, not the camera).
B002IPHIEG,14,6,Those can pose some problems when they open when they shouldn't (like in your pocket).The large touch screen makes everything easy.
B002IPHIEG,14,7,It will mar or scratch the film and possibly damage the very screen you are trying to protect!
B002IPHIEG,14,8,Now I notice that my wife's camera is doing the same thing and I don't know what is going on yet but I cannot reccommend this camera now that I have seen both screens go bad in less than two years.
B002IPHIEG,14,9,Translated to small point and shoot cameras, it's almost impossible for an older pair of eyes to clearly see what's on a 2.7 or 3 inch LCD screen on the back of camera, even if bright sun isn't washing out the screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,10,That screen is easy to maneuver around.
B002IPHIEG,14,11,The Sony "touch screen" only gets a 3 rating.
B002IPHIEG,14,12,Remarkable, actually.The touch screen is easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,14,13,There wasn't much to complain about.However I noticed last year that my screen was  getting hazy or splotchy; I don't know what to call it but it looks like a window with condensation all over it and I associated it with moisture or humidity "behine" the glass screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,14,Durability  First day I severely scratched the screen on the metal rivet putting it in or taking it out of my jeans pocket a camera this small should be designed to be put in a pocket.3.
B002IPHIEG,14,15,It should have a viewfinder a bit hard to see in direct sunlight.
B002IPHIEG,14,16,I was able totake pictures with no flash using just the ambient lightand the pictures were beautiful.
B002IPHIEG,14,17,It would come up with a choice of Delete this Picture on the left and Delete all Pictures on the right side of the screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,18,If the camera has trouble focusing you simply touch the screen where you want it to focus and it focuses on that spot.
B002IPHIEG,14,19,I've had a couple cameras like this and the clear plastic gets scratched quickly.
B002IPHIEG,14,20,Display failed after 2 months.
B002IPHIEG,14,21,Works well in most lighting conditions with/without flash.
B002IPHIEG,14,22,When your shots look good on the view screen, they will be even more pleasing on a correctly calibrated HD monitor.2) The white balance options never seem to look right on the view screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,23,The Canon stopped working, suffering from "the black screen of death".
B002IPHIEG,14,24,And then 2-3 weeks ago when I turned it on the display started "going all white" -- first in stripes and then full-screen.
B002IPHIEG,15,0,The Canon has faster glass (f/2.0),
B002IPHIEG,15,1,I hoped I helped you in some way.
B002IPHIEG,15,2,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,15,3,I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon.
B002IPHIEG,15,4,The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90.
B002IPHIEG,15,5,I would say, and this may be a mark against it for many people, that the WX1 is not a "point and shoot" camera unless one is familiar with its workings, but when I read the negative comments I wonder if some of the issues complained of could be addressed through a better understanding of the camera.
B002IPHIEG,15,6,Suppose that can't be helped.
B002IPHIEG,15,7,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,15,8,The only slow operation is changing to View mode just after taking a picture, which takes 1-2s.However, there's a big fat problem with the WX1:  manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,15,9,Someone else said that they had no problem shooting at higher speeds in that setting.
B002IPHIEG,15,10,I needed low light capabilities for indoor and nighttime pictures without a flash and a wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,15,11,The contrast and exposure levels were also inconsistent and usually worse than the Canon, requiring tweaking in Photoshop.
B002IPHIEG,15,12,It's not a HUGE difference, but it was noticeable when shooting.So for whatever reason the video does NOT benefit from the new low light lens system.
B002IPHIEG,15,13,Good but poor autofocus.
B002IPHIEG,15,14,Photos were posted that looked really bad.
B002IPHIEG,15,15,Takes better pictures than any other camera I've owned.
B002IPHIEG,15,16,Second, the autofocus changes haphazardly, switching from foreground to background, sometimes following movement, and preferentially focusing on light sources.
B002IPHIEG,15,17,I haven't used this mode too much yet, hoping to get better at using it.
B002IPHIEG,15,18,I wonder if point and shoot cameras like this one could do better.
B002IPHIEG,15,19,You can also put the camera in High ISO mode, which allows for faster shutter speed.Canon's soon to be released S90 seems to have become the great new hope for shutterbugs longing for a small point and shoot that takes great low light photos instead of the WX1, primarily because it not only also has a fast lens and improved sensor, but also manual controls and raw capabilities.2.
B002IPHIEG,15,20,Sony addressed this in newer cameras, but then you have to tolerate the "upgrades".
B002IPHIEG,15,21,When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked.
B002IPHIEG,15,22,This is the only negative thing I can find.
B002IPHIEG,15,23,Pictures cant beat the best point and shoot cameras out there but no complaints at all - in fact, shoots good low light pictures.
B002IPHIEG,15,24,Controls are laid out sensibly, and it's easy to switch from automated settings to finer image control.One of the coolest new features is Panorama mode, which makes ultra-wide photos quickly and easily.
B002IPHIEG,16,0,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,16,1,Sony repaired the damage under the warranty and not cost at all.
B002IPHIEG,16,2,Great customer service.
B002IPHIEG,16,3,They asked for US$400 to repair a tiny door.I am very disappointed for the customer support from Sony.
B002IPHIEG,16,4,So of course there is no reliable way to take photos and certainly no way to review photos.I called Amazon.com this morning and the customer service representative told me I had to call Sony.I visited the Sony website, entered my information, and was given instructions to ship the camera back to Sony (at my expense) for free warranty repair (luckily it was within the 90 day window).I've owned Canon digital cameras for 7 years and never had a hardware failure in the first three months like this.
B002IPHIEG,16,5,So why am I reviewing a camera that seems like a downgrade?Well Sony is using a new lens system called the "Exmor R".
B002IPHIEG,16,6,And, when directed to the service website to make a repair request, that malfunctioned too.
B002IPHIEG,16,7,Sony said they would repair the camera but that means shipping, waiting, and considerable trouble.
B002IPHIEG,16,8,I was very impressed that I ordered the camera on a Saturday, it was shipped out the same day and at my house on Tuesday...great service...thank you!!!
B002IPHIEG,16,9,Did anyone at Sony even take this camera out for a night before shipping it?-
B002IPHIEG,16,10,I requested for the package to be left at my door with no signature so the shipping company called me within a few minutes to ensure that he would take care of this and gave me his cell phone number in case I needed it.
B002IPHIEG,16,11,I reported the problem 32 days after buying so I was out of luck with the retailer.
B002IPHIEG,16,12,If not, make sure you check it before your 30 day return option expires
B002IPHIEG,16,13,battery cover can break in one year.
B002IPHIEG,16,14,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,16,15,Had High Hopes - Defective Product.
B002IPHIEG,16,16,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.
B002IPHIEG,16,17,I took it to my local camera shop to see if they could fix it, but all they do is send it in to Sony to have them repair it (for $260!).
B002IPHIEG,16,18,So I will wait, and see what happens in the next few months.
B002IPHIEG,16,19,I researched other brands online and in person, but frankly, the color values for Canon, Nikon, Casio,Samsung, and Kodak and the Sony W-series were completely unnatural on the viewing screens.
B002IPHIEG,16,20,You have to package the camera yourself and ship it to Texas for several weeks with no replacement in the interim.
B002IPHIEG,16,21,I sent the camera to Sony covered by warranty and customer service (very kindly I must say) told me that the camera was performing under specifications and even if they replaced it with a new one it will have the same flaw, so my only options were to exchange it for a different model or live with it...I'm amazed that they are still selling this camera (that isn't exactly cheap) with this awful flaw, maybe most people won't notice it if they don't take too much close up pictures but be aware of this problem if you're considering getting this camera.
B002IPHIEG,16,22,I am going to see if Sony wiill repair or replace them but right now it feels that $329 x 2 was too much to spend for less than two years use.
B002IPHIEG,16,23,The other reviews cover that pretty well so I'll keep it brief.After only 1 month the shutter stopped closing completely, and the repair process is no fun at all.It's been LESS THAN 2 MONTHS since I bought this camera and there is already dust trapped INSIDE the lens, so many of my pictures have visible spots all over them.Sony's customer service is far from good compared to other companies I've worked with.
B002IPHIEG,16,24,He's picked it up a couple of times, but hasn't yet figured out how to work it...heaven help he should actually READ the manual (which I suggest).
B002IPHIEG,17,0,They looked better if I manually set the ISO, but if I'm just pulling it out for a quick shot, i don't want to have to remember to go to manual settings all the time.
B002IPHIEG,17,1,settings adjustments for color hues, saturation.-No
B002IPHIEG,17,2,You may need to set the EV to -.3=>-.7 for less contrasty scenes.
B002IPHIEG,17,3,The two florescent settings are just goofy.
B002IPHIEG,17,4,However, did you ever try looking at "no flash" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode?
B002IPHIEG,17,5,I know I can always get into manual modes to compensate for things, but I wanted something I didn't always have to do that with.
B002IPHIEG,17,6,Decrease the EV setting by .07.
B002IPHIEG,17,7,I highly recommend taking picture in the P mode with white balance set to flash.
B002IPHIEG,17,8,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,17,9,If the camera has trouble focusing you simply touch the screen where you want it to focus and it focuses on that spot.
B002IPHIEG,17,10,It's pretty good, WITH THE RIGHT SETTINGS.
B002IPHIEG,17,11,The reason it is not a point and shoot is because auto exposure is just wrong.
B002IPHIEG,17,12,Controls are laid out sensibly, and it's easy to switch from automated settings to finer image control.One of the coolest new features is Panorama mode, which makes ultra-wide photos quickly and easily.
B002IPHIEG,17,13,I sometimes dont even need to use the flash!! yes sometimes you don't need the flash at night! it's perfect for night shootings..I only wish it has a button to switch from picture shooting to video... here you have to do it through the touch screen and it needs 2 clicks to switch..by the way the touch screen works wekk..
B002IPHIEG,17,14,You might also want to try different White Balances,setting correctly results in really nice low light shots.Outdoor shots:This camera in iSCN mode seems to keep the lens all the way open(F2.4)and it adjusts the shutter speed(a big No No)resulting in washed out over exposed photos(yuck).The solution: switch to "P" Mode which closes down the lens to around a nice F5.0 to F7.1(much better) and switch the White Balance to "Flash" .
B002IPHIEG,17,15,Switching to any other mode defaults the settings to the terrible AUTO everything requiring the photographer to reset all those undesirable Sony auto settings.
B002IPHIEG,17,16,Within those photos I have found out the best settings for the right scenes and conditions.
B002IPHIEG,17,17,This one is always blurry, nomatter the mode.
B002IPHIEG,17,18,When setting on "P" mode I found out that switching the White Balance from "Auto" or "Daylight" to "Flash" in improves outdoor photos color, tone, exposure and warmness.
B002IPHIEG,17,19,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,17,20,For correct exposures, use the P setting, meter in the center (not with the spot setting) of the brightest area while slightly depressing the shutter button to hold the averaged metered settings.
B002IPHIEG,17,21,Took shots at the same time from the same distances with the same lighting, both left on automatic.
B002IPHIEG,17,22,Someone else said that they had no problem shooting at higher speeds in that setting.
B002IPHIEG,17,23,Yeah, turning on the FLASH white balance for outdoor photos (which makes no sense by the way) --SOMETIMES-- does make the normally blueish outdoor photos look more pleasingly orangeish if you can remember to make this cryptic change or use P mode for your outdoor photos.
B002IPHIEG,17,24,You have to switch the camera to Handheld Twilight mode and adjust the Exposure Value(EV) from -0.3 to -1.7(this is a very important setting that needs to be set on order to remove the noisyness and grain from the photo, a setting people don't adjust and then complain about how bad the photo looks in low light).
B002IPHIEG,18,0,4) Reviewing photos after a shot ... is too slow.
B002IPHIEG,18,1,Instead it takes ... 3 to 5 seconds because you have to wait for the current photo to be processed and then wait wait wait to press the review button and if you press it twice ... oops, your still in picture-taking mode.
B002IPHIEG,18,2,I want a camera that I don't know is there, that I can whip out in 2 seconds to snap off a shot.
B002IPHIEG,18,3,It's been in a drawer for some time now.
B002IPHIEG,18,4,3) Most importantly for me, the shutter does not click fast enough.
B002IPHIEG,18,5,I know that folks will say that I must have pressed the wrong button, and that might be so at times.
B002IPHIEG,18,6,Being an SLR user, I am used to instant reaction speed between the moment I press the button and the moment the shutter clicks.
B002IPHIEG,18,7,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.
B002IPHIEG,18,8,The only way to stop the camera from zooming in, is to turn it off.
B002IPHIEG,18,9,It's easy to whip out and snap a shot when the moment is right.
B002IPHIEG,18,10,Shutter lag (time from pushing the shutter button until photo taken),is very low for a pocket camera.What's not so good:-Noise reduction smears details at ISO 400 and above.
B002IPHIEG,18,11,The processing time is fast, very fast.
B002IPHIEG,18,12,There is no delay when snapping that pic so you get exactly what you wanted.
B002IPHIEG,18,13,When taking shutter speed it takes a while to recording and process it to save it and show up on camera.
B002IPHIEG,18,14,I would buy it again.I would ask SONY to change a few things: 1) The power and shutter buttons are too flush and difficult to feel in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,18,15,I sometimes dont even need to use the flash!! yes sometimes you don't need the flash at night! it's perfect for night shootings..I only wish it has a button to switch from picture shooting to video... here you have to do it through the touch screen and it needs 2 clicks to switch..by the way the touch screen works wekk..
B002IPHIEG,18,16,It controls everything but the zoom, shutter, and on/off switch, but it's quick enough where I never found myself wishing for more physical buttons.
B002IPHIEG,18,17,Surely, the last photo can be put into a memory buffer to immediately be shown when the review button is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,18,18,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,18,19,So much movement occurs by the subject in the 1 to 4 seconds (depending on lighting) it takes the shutter to click on this Cybershot.
B002IPHIEG,18,20,The zoom is difficult to use it moves to fast.
B002IPHIEG,18,21,The second feature allows this camera to shoot up to 10f/sec.
B002IPHIEG,18,22,You can fix this by using the slow-synchro flash setting and by standing back further from your subject, but it takes some experimentation to learn to use it well.
B002IPHIEG,18,23,The main subject of most of my pictures is my very active toddler, and the Canon's shutter lag time was ridiculous - in some instances it would take a full 2 seconds to take the picture, at which point my kid would no longer be in the room, let alone in the frame.
B002IPHIEG,18,24,It didn't last long.
B002IPHIEG,19,0,I haven't transferred them to the computer, but I don't show my pictures on my computer.
B002IPHIEG,19,1,The only problem with it is you NEED to by a memory card, otherwise you can only store a couple of images on the camera's internal memory.
B002IPHIEG,19,2,The biggest problem I've had is the USB connection - the plug on the camera end has always seemed a little wobbly and unstable, and over time it stopped connecting at all.
B002IPHIEG,19,3,Reformating memory stick is best done on computer.
B002IPHIEG,19,4,(it's really ugly)No USB Charging.
B002IPHIEG,19,5,Internal Memory.
B002IPHIEG,19,6,Battery has to be taken out and charged externally, i prefer the ones which can be charged through usb therefore allowing you to copy photos while also charging the camera.
B002IPHIEG,19,7,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,19,8,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,19,9,I thought before buying that this would just be easier than stiching the photos on my computer.
B002IPHIEG,19,10,It's annoying that it only takes the proprietary (and expensive) Sony memory stick instead of the usual SD card that all my other cameras have used, but that's not too big a deal.
B002IPHIEG,19,11,But, if you take movies you have to locate the subdirectory on the memory card and access that directly.
B002IPHIEG,19,12,Tell me what will you do when you want to move pictures from your camera to your computer on the fly, you will need the 10 meter long 10 plug Sony proprietary cable, how about taking the memory card out, oh, that's another proprietary memory stick duo, now how to charge it?
B002IPHIEG,19,13,Interface to computer - dedicated cable I have to bring with me on vacation, or a usb sd card reader?
B002IPHIEG,19,14,Use MS Windows software for downloading.Overall: I am happy with purchase.
B002IPHIEG,19,15,Taking HD Video takes up so much space on the memory card.
B002IPHIEG,19,16,No standard USB connection.
B002IPHIEG,19,17,There are some quirks with this camera which I wanted to point out.GOOD- Photo Quality - Others cover this so I wont go into it, but basically the photos are very good.BAD- Sony USB Cable - This is proprietary SONY cable, so you have to carry it around with you if you want to download photos from the directly from the camera without removing the Memory Stick.
B002IPHIEG,19,18,I can send it in for repairs, but I'm not prepared to go 4-6 weeks without a camera, so I just bought a USB card reader.
B002IPHIEG,19,19,No HDMI.Expensive Memory Stick Duo.
B002IPHIEG,19,20,4) Reviewing photos after a shot ... is too slow.
B002IPHIEG,19,21,What can't a mini USB connection do?
B002IPHIEG,19,22,The memory stick duo is what Sony uses; save to an external hard drive (you're going to need one either for the quantity of VGA photos or the memory required to store all your 10.2 megapixel treasures) and re-use to bring down your expenses if the price differential with other media is such a big factor.
B002IPHIEG,19,23,Great camera only one thing you need to know.
B002IPHIEG,19,24,Be prepared to download to the computer, or a portable computer drive that stores a lot of gigs.
B002IPHIEG,20,0,The Camera That Stole Me Away From Canon!
B002IPHIEG,20,1,I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon.
B002IPHIEG,20,2,The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90.
B002IPHIEG,20,3,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,20,4,not much better than my seven year old Sony DSC-T30.
B002IPHIEG,20,5,I was in the market for point and shoot digital.
B002IPHIEG,20,6,Our last camera was a canon Powershot S2 IS.
B002IPHIEG,20,7,My last four digital cameras were all Canon, and i was happy with them.
B002IPHIEG,20,8,I purchased this camera because I wanted something to replace my Sony DSC-W300.
B002IPHIEG,20,9,Having faith and loyalty in the Canon brand (this was our 4th Canon Camera purchase, two of which were Canon AE-1s given as gifts) I contacted Canon and was sorely disappointed.
B002IPHIEG,20,10,We have had many Sony cyber shot cameras over the past 3 years.
B002IPHIEG,20,11,It should not be thought of as replacement for a large digital SLR like my $1,800 Nikon without lenses.
B002IPHIEG,20,12,Best Point & Shoot Digital Camera I Ever Got ;) SONY TX1.
B002IPHIEG,20,13,I'm strictly point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,20,14,Our 5 year old camera shoots pictures that are much better and sharp.
B002IPHIEG,20,15,I bought this camera to replace my Sony T90 point and shoot when it finally died.
B002IPHIEG,20,16,I bought the TX1 after using a borrowed one and comparing it to Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, and the newest compact Sonys: TX100, TX7, T110.
B002IPHIEG,20,17,I was looking at this last month when it was announced, and had decided I was going to go with the forthcoming 980 from Canon.
B002IPHIEG,20,18,For a long time I was nervous about leaving canon elphs!
B002IPHIEG,20,19,I am replacing a Cannon with only 3.1 megapixels and this is somuch better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,20,20,I think my next one will be a Casio or Canon.
B002IPHIEG,20,21,I was still shooting film when the digital age rolled around.
B002IPHIEG,20,22,I decided to purchase a new pocket camera to take on a trip to Disney World.
B002IPHIEG,20,23,Of all the point-and-shoot digital cameras I've had, this is the first one I've been very happy with.
B002IPHIEG,20,24,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).
B002IPHIEG,21,0,Many of my pictures have spots in them even though I do clean the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,1,Dust trapped inside lens, again!
B002IPHIEG,21,2,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,3,The ONLY thing that I do not like is having to open the lens cover to take photos...but in the end this will protect the lens, because I dropped two of my Canons and messed up the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,4,The only problem I have had is with dust backscatter.
B002IPHIEG,21,5,There are many problems with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,21,6,There are many problems however:1.
B002IPHIEG,21,7,It is so much better than the cameras that have the protruding lens that extends when open.
B002IPHIEG,21,8,i like how the lens cover slides down and how slim the camera is.
B002IPHIEG,21,9,Only problem that I can see is that the thing has the odd habit of turning on while in your pocket, which opens and expands the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,10,Taking a picture with the camera turned sideways to better frame a specific shot shows a lot of distortion from the wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,11,Great even in low lighted area.The bad side: The rocker/toggle switch used to zooming in and out the lens is fragile!
B002IPHIEG,21,12,The placement of the lens allows for others to touch or cover the lens with their fingers if they are taking a picture for you.
B002IPHIEG,21,13,I was advised that this is a technical problem caused by the flash being to close to the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,14,Another great feature is the lens cover that acts as an on/off switch.
B002IPHIEG,21,15,Then when you receive the camera back from the factory, the spots are gone, but you discover the focus is not as good as it was before you sent the camera for cleaning.... then back to the factory, etc.
B002IPHIEG,21,16,I believe this is due to the flash being close to the lens.In summary, DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA.
B002IPHIEG,21,17,Light and small for the lens range.3)
B002IPHIEG,21,18,There is always a shadow in the lower left corner of the pictures (because of very short distance between flash and lens).2.
B002IPHIEG,21,19,I place my thumb along the bottom edge right where the battery cover it and there is no lip to keep your thumb from sliding the door open.
B002IPHIEG,21,20,The other reviews cover that pretty well so I'll keep it brief.After only 1 month the shutter stopped closing completely, and the repair process is no fun at all.It's been LESS THAN 2 MONTHS since I bought this camera and there is already dust trapped INSIDE the lens, so many of my pictures have visible spots all over them.Sony's customer service is far from good compared to other companies I've worked with.
B002IPHIEG,21,21,Battery door easily opened.
B002IPHIEG,21,22,If you take a picture with flash at 24mm, what is a really common use I have to say, it gets a black spot in the lower left corner.
B002IPHIEG,21,23,Works well in most lighting conditions with/without flash.
B002IPHIEG,21,24,The rear element of the lens mechanism will get dirty.
B002IPHIEG,22,0,Overall is good.
B002IPHIEG,22,1,Vedio quality is great as well.
B002IPHIEG,22,2,Slightly better at low light but terrible with good light.
B002IPHIEG,22,3,It is excellent in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,4,A grainy photo is better than no photo at all.
B002IPHIEG,22,5,Great low light pictures!
B002IPHIEG,22,6,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,22,7,Great indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,8,Took great pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,9,It's better in low light but still very grainy, however it's worse in good bright light.
B002IPHIEG,22,10,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,22,11,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,22,12,It is a lot better with the picture quality especially in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,13,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,22,14,Good night shots.240-degree
B002IPHIEG,22,15,It takes very clear photos in day light and at night time or low light conditions.
B002IPHIEG,22,16,Yes, you are slightly more likely to get a better photo in the dark if you really need to take photos in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,22,17,The colors and lighting in the videos are excellent.
B002IPHIEG,22,18,small but wish it better low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,19,The low light photos (without a flash) are incredible!
B002IPHIEG,22,20,Photo quality under poor light conditions is amazing; photos are better than expected.
B002IPHIEG,22,21,Works well in most lighting conditions with/without flash.
B002IPHIEG,22,22,Low light pictures are blurry and pixelated.
B002IPHIEG,22,23,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,22,24,Besides the obvious use as seen in the ads, it works extraordinarily well in low light, and even outdoors at dusk.
B002IPHIEG,23,0,don't buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,1,No problems encountered so far.
B002IPHIEG,23,2,Do not buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,3,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).
B002IPHIEG,23,4,I returned it in the next day I received.
B002IPHIEG,23,5,I bought two of the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX1/P camera within months of one another the first from Amazon on 12-17-2009.
B002IPHIEG,23,6,I now need to buy a new camera for an upcoming trip, and I can assure you it will not be a Sony.Hope this helps,Damian
B002IPHIEG,23,7,Sony DSC-WX1 , A disappointing Camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,8,I did purchase this camera elsewhere.
B002IPHIEG,23,9,It got me thinking about all of the Sony products we have had in the past.
B002IPHIEG,23,10,Having faith and loyalty in the Canon brand (this was our 4th Canon Camera purchase, two of which were Canon AE-1s given as gifts) I contacted Canon and was sorely disappointed.
B002IPHIEG,23,11,DSC-WX1b - I purchased this camera for 2 reasons.
B002IPHIEG,23,12,I disregarded several of the negative reviews I read on this, trying to be optimistic, but that isn't working out for me.
B002IPHIEG,23,13,Had High Hopes - Defective Product.
B002IPHIEG,23,14,I am going to see if Sony wiill repair or replace them but right now it feels that $329 x 2 was too much to spend for less than two years use.
B002IPHIEG,23,15,I truly believe you'll be very happy if you decide to purchase this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,16,I had a bought a Sony DSC-T3 a few years ago, wanting it so bad I imported one from Japan!
B002IPHIEG,23,17,I did all my research (reading product reviews from Amazon, CNET, BestBuy etc.) and decided to try out the WX1 and I'm glad I did.
B002IPHIEG,23,18,Please save your money and time - look elsewhere.
B002IPHIEG,23,19,While waiting to get the camera, I would check Amazon every day to see if anyone who had actually used the camera had put up any reviews yet.
B002IPHIEG,23,20,You have to package the camera yourself and ship it to Texas for several weeks with no replacement in the interim.
B002IPHIEG,23,21,I bought one about 2 months ago and have been using it a lot.
B002IPHIEG,23,22,They suggested I contact Sony (I didn't buy the camera from them).
B002IPHIEG,23,23,I found this product.
B002IPHIEG,23,24,He got it about 2 years ago for $300+.
B002IPHIEG,24,0,Basically you don't have any manual controls at all.
B002IPHIEG,24,1,It is also intuitive and easy to use the advanced functions without much of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,24,2,I figured out most of the settings without even reading the instructions.
B002IPHIEG,24,3,I looked all over to try to find which settings to change but I never found it.
B002IPHIEG,24,4,That screen is easy to maneuver around.
B002IPHIEG,24,5,Take time to read and understand the instruction manual!Be sure and buy an xtra battery as the camera will gobble up the available "juice" while shooting.
B002IPHIEG,24,6,The controls are pretty intuitive and easy for an amateur like me to figure out.
B002IPHIEG,24,7,The only reason I rated the picture quality 4/5 is because I am still trying to learn and figure out all of the different settings.............I just havn't had the time!
B002IPHIEG,24,8,He's picked it up a couple of times, but hasn't yet figured out how to work it...heaven help he should actually READ the manual (which I suggest).
B002IPHIEG,24,9,(I was up against a new model Nikkon)  The settings all do what they say, but perhaps it's greatest strength would also be it's weakness if any because while the settings are easy to use, and understand with help hints, those little "simple" settings are actually quite complex tools that make all the difference in a photo if you learn the camera and how to use each setting.
B002IPHIEG,24,10,The touch-screen interface is slick, but does have a bit of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,24,11,this is 2010 not 1985.4.  User interface - menu is difficult to navigate and full of gimmicky 'features' as opposed to useful things.
B002IPHIEG,24,12,First, it is all too easy while shooting to accidently change the settings and all too difficult to get back to what I want--after I realize what's happened.
B002IPHIEG,24,13,Great features, simple and easy to use settings.
B002IPHIEG,24,14,Touchscreen makes managing functions fairly easy, and camera's "Easy" mode performs very intelligently in most settings.
B002IPHIEG,24,15,Also, I find it easy to hit the power button when the camera's in a crowded pocket.
B002IPHIEG,24,16,The camera is easy to use, not too many buttons that you'll never use.
B002IPHIEG,24,17,Some people might not like the touch screen, but it's actually quite easy to manipulate.
B002IPHIEG,24,18,This could be my user error, so I take some responsibility, it just seems like this should be easy to accomplish.Overall it's a great point and shoot camera.
B002IPHIEG,24,19,How is that possible?! (for the answer, see the next line item)- No manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,24,20,No manual controls.The W300 had full manual controls, and I wonder why Sony couldn't have included them here and really made this a top of the line point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,24,21,Yes, I carefully read all the other reviews and took great pains to try out all the other settings and options.
B002IPHIEG,24,22,For one thing, it is extremely easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,24,23,I had never done this before, and while it was a HUGE learning curve, I learned what this little stick of dynomite camera can and cannot do.
B002IPHIEG,24,24,I found the menus a bit confusing and not intuitive even though I am an iPhone junkie and very tech savvy.
B002IPHIEG,25,0,It seems all my video files are HUGE.
B002IPHIEG,25,1,I need to educate myself on this...being able to edit and play with the HD video files.
B002IPHIEG,25,2,All I got were very blurry pictures which was a huge disappointment after never having this problem in the past.
B002IPHIEG,25,3,Just for the record, I never experienced such a problem neither with my T100 nor with my Sony HDR-SR7 camcorder.
B002IPHIEG,25,4,At first I looked at the Sony W290.
B002IPHIEG,25,5,I've owned Sony cameras for years and would never look at another brand of camera, until now.
B002IPHIEG,25,6,Huge Disappointed.
B002IPHIEG,25,7,don't buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,8,In the end the video capability might be too advanced for me and I had to return it in lieu of basic video functions.
B002IPHIEG,25,9,I never had a problem with blurriness or noise in my pictures.
B002IPHIEG,25,10,It works, but you need to have nimble fingers and if you've used an iPhone/iPod you'll be disappointed in Sony.
B002IPHIEG,25,11,I researched other brands online and in person, but frankly, the color values for Canon, Nikon, Casio,Samsung, and Kodak and the Sony W-series were completely unnatural on the viewing screens.
B002IPHIEG,25,12,So check, check, and check!
B002IPHIEG,25,13,Sony DSC-TX1/P.
B002IPHIEG,25,14,I've always been a sony camera guy, but this camera has a really big issue that I couldn't believe that it was real when I start testing the camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,15,The color can be adjusted in most video editing programs, so it should not stop you from buying the camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,16,It got me thinking about all of the Sony products we have had in the past.
B002IPHIEG,25,17,Now, I have to convert them to mpg format (which is what the other cameras used to record in).
B002IPHIEG,25,18,And of course it had to be Sony.
B002IPHIEG,25,19,Good camera with an awful flaw in the design that affects some pictures.
B002IPHIEG,25,20,When I body-slammed my camera and myself to the paving stones of Salisbury, England, my Sony DSC-T9 performed like nothing had happened until I returned home, four days later.
B002IPHIEG,25,21,It's an easy fix with any editing software, but most people probably won't even notice it.
B002IPHIEG,25,22,I returned it in the next day I received.
B002IPHIEG,25,23,I now need to buy a new camera for an upcoming trip, and I can assure you it will not be a Sony.Hope this helps,Damian
B002IPHIEG,25,24,That is why for a number of years I had successively Sony DSC-T1, T30, and T100 ultra-compacts.
B00DMS0LCO,0,0,When I get the battery, there is no power in it.
B00DMS0LCO,0,1,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,0,2,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,0,3,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,0,4,I put the dead battery that came with the camera on the charger and left it to charge thinking nothing of it.4
B00DMS0LCO,0,5,But overall, it seemed like a nice lens and shoots nice pictures.BATTERY LIFEWithout WiFi the battery life is quite good.
B00DMS0LCO,0,6,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,0,7,its not charging ?
B00DMS0LCO,0,8,Battery life is great with the wi-fi turned off.
B00DMS0LCO,0,9,break battery.
B00DMS0LCO,0,10,I purchased two off-brand batteries as backups to the Canon battery, and I've never been left stranded yet and I use the WiFi a lot.SUMMARYOverall this is a great camera and I highly recommend it!
B00DMS0LCO,0,11,I've never considered myself a serious videographer, but this camera could change that.Battery Life: Battery life seems very good and I am still working off the same charge from when I pulled the camera out of the box about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,0,12,the battery charger charge TWO batteries fast at the same time?I'd consider a full frame version, if the cons are fix.for
B00DMS0LCO,0,13,wanted to let people know that I am getting about 950 photo's and about 25 minutes of video per battery charge.
B00DMS0LCO,0,14,However, to me this has never been an issue since I ALWAYS carry a spare battery.
B00DMS0LCO,0,15,Battery life is almost twice than the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,0,16,I have never heard of this.why is there a communication problem between a new battery and the battery charger?...following the directions I separated the battery from the charger and put it back on....still blinking rapidly.....repeated this action again and finally the battery started to charge.
B00DMS0LCO,0,17,I may consider a battery grip for this camera and have owned a couple of Canon battery grips with previous Canons.
B00DMS0LCO,0,18,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,0,19,I should be able to charge after market batteries on this charger.sample
B00DMS0LCO,0,20,I added the grip, a couple of batteries and gone to shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,0,21,NOT COOL.I have 2 after market batteries that would no charge on this charger .Bummer I then ordered an aftermarket charger for 5 $ no big deal.
B00DMS0LCO,0,22,I could probably do an entire day of shooting with the WiFi off without changing batteries.
B00DMS0LCO,0,23,I had second thoughts but turns out the Canon charger worked and battery had no issues whatsoever.
B00DMS0LCO,0,24,keep in mind that this battery charger is the same battery charger that comes with the 5dmark ii 7D and a few other models.
B00DMS0LCO,1,0,Oh, and same thing with the touch screen.
B00DMS0LCO,1,1,Nice camera.
B00DMS0LCO,1,2,Love the flip out rear touch screen LCD.
B00DMS0LCO,1,3,The camera also has a good grip and the detachable lcd screen is a nice to have feature
B00DMS0LCO,1,4,I love this camera so much, takes amazing photos, touch screen, Wifi, I love it.
B00DMS0LCO,1,5,Touch flip screen.
B00DMS0LCO,1,6,The 70D is so easy to use and change settings with, thanks to the capacitive touch screen which is just like the touch screen on a nice smartphone.
B00DMS0LCO,1,7,Very good camera.
B00DMS0LCO,1,8,The articulated touch screen makes live view, video and menu settings very convenient.
B00DMS0LCO,1,9,A big plus is that you can touch the LCD to type in passwords, etc.
B00DMS0LCO,1,10,The icing on the cake is the Touch Screen with multi-touch operation, as well as Touch AF! Excellent!
B00DMS0LCO,1,11,Oh, and by the way, the screen is touch controlled.
B00DMS0LCO,1,12,It even implements iPhone-like viewing of images you have taken.
B00DMS0LCO,1,13,The big deal is the addition of touch screen ability.
B00DMS0LCO,1,14,Anyway, the fold-out display is a great feature, and it also folds face-in to protect the display when not in use.The ability to touch various points on the LCD display while in Live View or shooting video, and shift focus while shooting is - to me at least - worth the price of admission.
B00DMS0LCO,1,15,However, I've been surprised to find that the thing I like best about this camera is it's ease of use, particularly Canon's implementation of the LCD monitor touch screen.
B00DMS0LCO,1,16,I am still trying to figure out how to hold the camera so that I can tap on the back viewing screen where I want the focus.
B00DMS0LCO,1,17,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,1,18,I love the new focus system, it gives me nice sharp pic's right where I want them.
B00DMS0LCO,1,19,This is my first experience with a fold-out LCD screen on a DSLR, and I had no idea how the display would deal with flipping around 180 degrees.
B00DMS0LCO,1,20,One very fine feature is the ability to use the LCD screen to provide extra sharp focus.
B00DMS0LCO,1,21,I  am not a big fan of touch screen operation because the screen gets smudged in a hurry, being anal retentive/ a clean freak this gets annoying to me but I will make the best of it.*
B00DMS0LCO,1,22,No LCD tilt or touch.
B00DMS0LCO,1,23,No LCD tilt or touch.
B00DMS0LCO,1,24,Responsiveness is just as good as on my iPod Touch.-
B00DMS0LCO,2,0,I have several Canon Cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,2,1,Upgraded from a Canon Rebel XS.
B00DMS0LCO,2,2,I upgraded from a Canon Rebel to the 70d.
B00DMS0LCO,2,3,This was an upgrade for me.
B00DMS0LCO,2,4,This review is coming from someone upgrading from a Canon Kiss X4 (T2i/550D).
B00DMS0LCO,2,5,What an upgrade...
B00DMS0LCO,2,6,Keep it in context and the 70D is the best all around camera Canon has ever made by far.
B00DMS0LCO,2,7,The Canon EOS 70D borrows many features from the Canon lineup.
B00DMS0LCO,2,8,Best Canon I've Used So Far.
B00DMS0LCO,2,9,Nice upgrade from my Rebel T1i.
B00DMS0LCO,2,10,They were polite and blamed them selves not the canon.
B00DMS0LCO,2,11,Not Canon teleconverters, however.
B00DMS0LCO,2,12,There's nothing from Canon behind it.
B00DMS0LCO,2,13,Canon doesn't often make game-changing cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,2,14,Regardless of what Canon says, pretend it's a sieve if you're in more than a drizzle.
B00DMS0LCO,2,15,This is the best camera except for my Canon Mark5II
B00DMS0LCO,2,16,I had a Canon Rebel T3 and was looking to upgrade my camera.
B00DMS0LCO,2,17,Way to go Canon!
B00DMS0LCO,2,18,I went the Canon DSLR route due to looking at astrophotography.
B00DMS0LCO,2,19,Upgraded from a Rebel T2i to 70D - Very pleased.
B00DMS0LCO,2,20,They all work great on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,2,21,70D What a great camera!
B00DMS0LCO,2,22,I love the new Canon EOS 70D!
B00DMS0LCO,2,23,Previous body was a XSi Rebel and have been looking to upgrade for the past year.
B00DMS0LCO,2,24,I upgraded from a Canon T2i and this camera is awesome.
B00DMS0LCO,3,0,Very good quality pictures
B00DMS0LCO,3,1,I haven't edited any of the video, so I do no know if the lens sounds show up on the video.
B00DMS0LCO,3,2,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,3,3,The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good.
B00DMS0LCO,3,4,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,3,5,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,3,6,Most reviews made it sound like a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,3,7,Videos are excellent.
B00DMS0LCO,3,8,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,3,9,I am not using Wi-Fi right now.3-9-2014went to the NUCLEAR COWBOYZ show and shot over 45 minutes of video and about 150 stills.
B00DMS0LCO,3,10,Great Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,3,11,My non-STM lenses are very very loud when I use them on my 70D to record video - enough to make them nearly unusable for video.
B00DMS0LCO,3,12,Once more I know that I have a very good camera.
B00DMS0LCO,3,13,noise in video.
B00DMS0LCO,3,14,I also was not using one of the new STM lenses and when zooming in and out, there wasn't any noise on the video.
B00DMS0LCO,3,15,The camera was attractive to me because of the revolutionary auto focus (AF) feature (which works great) and the ability to do video recording without have a camcorder.
B00DMS0LCO,3,16,If you're interested in video production, buy a dedicated video camera.
B00DMS0LCO,3,17,While the AF works well in video, unless you have the new STM lens, the focusing makes a lot of clicking noises that are picked up in your video.
B00DMS0LCO,3,18,It also works perfectly while shooting videos where the focus changes during the shot.
B00DMS0LCO,3,19,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,3,20,Every good thing you read regarding this camera's focusing ability, video capabilities, LiveView (LV) shooting is mostly true.
B00DMS0LCO,3,21,The Wi-Fi feature is great for sending photo to your phone or tablet or email or sharing on social media sites but it needs to be disabled manually for movie shooting and USB connection which is very annoying.
B00DMS0LCO,3,22,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,3,23,Finally.STILLS:Image quality is very good.
B00DMS0LCO,3,24,I also thought it would be great to capture video without having to carry around a second camera.
B00DMS0LCO,4,0,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,4,1,I'm just an amature that likes shooting video and pictures.
B00DMS0LCO,4,2,This means continuous shoot is not useable in LV mode!
B00DMS0LCO,4,3,Hence in low light, in LV mode the camera will not focus at all!
B00DMS0LCO,4,4,Excellent Camera with Great Features.
B00DMS0LCO,4,5,Lastly, I think it would be really convenient, if in VF mode, when you are switching shooting modes using mode dial, the LV panel could automatically show the information about that shooting mode.
B00DMS0LCO,4,6,I can shoot pretty much anything I want (i.e.
B00DMS0LCO,4,7,In LV mode, when you are switching between still photo shooting modes using mode dial, LV switches off which is somewhat annoying.8.
B00DMS0LCO,4,8,It has some amazing added features, also.
B00DMS0LCO,4,9,It's a great camera with an outstanding feature set.
B00DMS0LCO,4,10,first camera was set up to shoot RAW.
B00DMS0LCO,4,11,Easy to use, with good image quality and lots of options.
B00DMS0LCO,4,12,I love my set up.
B00DMS0LCO,4,13,The photos came out amazing.
B00DMS0LCO,4,14,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,4,15,I needed a DSLR which can capture videos and take photos in low light.
B00DMS0LCO,4,16,The 19 cross-type AF points is more than what I need but there is no way to select the AF points in Basic modes (A+, No Flash, CA) when using VF.
B00DMS0LCO,4,17,Great Camera!
B00DMS0LCO,4,18,They all work great on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,4,19,Great and fast auto focus.
B00DMS0LCO,4,20,Great exposure bracketing for HDR shooting.
B00DMS0LCO,4,21,The camera is quick to focus, acquires moving subjects and allows for great photo's.
B00DMS0LCO,4,22,Once more I know that I have a very good camera.
B00DMS0LCO,4,23,I ended up with some very nice photos, without even using a tripod.
B00DMS0LCO,4,24,This is an excellent camera and provides all the features I need such as HDR and High Speed shots.
B00DMS0LCO,5,0,For a $1200 camera it should have a full frame senor.Their still not there yet.
B00DMS0LCO,5,1,I love this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,5,2,Extremely fast focusing speed.
B00DMS0LCO,5,3,It has a fast focusing system and the 7fps is great for sports shooting.
B00DMS0LCO,5,4,Over priced not a full frame sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,5,5,Extremely fast shutter action, quiet, 7+ snaps per second.
B00DMS0LCO,5,6,the other feature that is very nice to me is the 7 frames per second, having both cameras that is sometimes the difference between getting and missing a good shot.
B00DMS0LCO,5,7,Great high speed shutter for kids' sports.
B00DMS0LCO,5,8,Great high speed shutter for my kids' sporting events.
B00DMS0LCO,5,9,The range of the ISO and the shutter speed is great and the difference it makes in the picture quality is amazing!
B00DMS0LCO,5,10,I really liked it as there was no shutter lag and burst speeds help get the action.
B00DMS0LCO,5,11,Moving up from my old T1i was the best move for me.
B00DMS0LCO,5,12,I used 3200 ISO with a 60-80 shutter speed to get the exposure right and came away with some great baby shots.
B00DMS0LCO,5,13,They all work great on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,5,14,Looks and feels great.
B00DMS0LCO,5,15,Let me start off by saying I have never used the full frame models.
B00DMS0LCO,5,16,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,5,17,We have to hold off until they produce a camera with a full frame senor for a reasonable price.
B00DMS0LCO,5,18,The shutter speed and FPS work great so that I can freeze the birds midflight and get tack sharp photos too.
B00DMS0LCO,5,19,I like the  focusing and keeping focus on the action, and in my humble opinion it is good or even better than the 7D.-
B00DMS0LCO,5,20,Coming from using Nikons (D7000 and D600), I got tired of terrible back focus issues and oil spots on my sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,5,21,Great burst rate of 7fps and the on board flash works well.
B00DMS0LCO,5,22,The speed of the 70D is also very fast.
B00DMS0LCO,5,23,I take sports and wildlife photos  with a 7D , so I'm comparing Canon 70d camera to the 7d.pros (for sports photographers)- Very good price for this type of camera- 7 frames per second is fast enough for sports.
B00DMS0LCO,5,24,The next best thing to getting a full frame.
B00DMS0LCO,6,0,one card slot.
B00DMS0LCO,6,1,Dual SD cards.
B00DMS0LCO,6,2,the on camera flash.
B00DMS0LCO,6,3,If you can find it, buy it!
B00DMS0LCO,6,4,A 32GB SD card is good for about 45 minutes with ALL-I compression and two hours with IPB.
B00DMS0LCO,6,5,While capturing video if you want to take a still photo, there is quite a few frame drops (about 1 sec as mentioned in the manual) even when using SD card with 95mb/s speed.
B00DMS0LCO,6,6,I used a SanDisk Extreme Pro 64GB SDXC card.
B00DMS0LCO,6,7,And the pop up flash gets a lot of use as a fill in outdoor portraits without having to lug around a separate flash unit.
B00DMS0LCO,6,8,I highly recommend this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,6,9,Same results with bouncing the flash off the ceiling.
B00DMS0LCO,6,10,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,6,11,A flash can provide more even, pleasing pictures, at the expense of a bulkier, attention-attracting rig.*
B00DMS0LCO,6,12,Most of my work is done with a tripod and with a cable release.
B00DMS0LCO,6,13,I'm just an amature that likes shooting video and pictures.
B00DMS0LCO,6,14,I feel I have most shooting situations covered with the on camera flash although it has its drawbacks.
B00DMS0LCO,6,15,I have also used the WiFi to transfer photos to my computer, but its pretty slow, so I usually just use the USB cable instead.-Drive
B00DMS0LCO,6,16,Modes:  The camera has a lot of great drive modes, including a burst-mode of 7 per second.
B00DMS0LCO,6,17,All in all, very satisfied with this purchase thus far, and looking forward to capturing many memories to come with this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,6,18,Pop up flash is always available for portrait fill outdoors (or indoors).
B00DMS0LCO,6,19,I have an external speed light/flash I just really never find myself using it.
B00DMS0LCO,6,20,I guess I'll have to resort to FEL use, but that amount flashes takes a toll on an infant.
B00DMS0LCO,6,21,All photos with and without FEL were properly exposed and looked great.I use bounce flash indoors a lot for our one year old granddaughter.
B00DMS0LCO,6,22,I also purchased the PNY 62GB SXD memory card, I would rather have more than less.
B00DMS0LCO,6,23,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,6,24,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,7,0,This is a great camera for the price.
B00DMS0LCO,7,1,One like this and another small P&S; I can carry in my pocket.
B00DMS0LCO,7,2,very good.
B00DMS0LCO,7,3,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,7,4,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,5,Looks and feels great.
B00DMS0LCO,7,6,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,7,Excellent Camera with Great Features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,8,Easy to use, with good image quality and lots of options.
B00DMS0LCO,7,9,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,7,10,Best AF available at this time in a SLR.
B00DMS0LCO,7,11,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,7,12,But overall, it seemed like a nice lens and shoots nice pictures.BATTERY LIFEWithout WiFi the battery life is quite good.
B00DMS0LCO,7,13,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,7,14,The touch screen is the best feature Canon added to this camera; simply swipe through photos, pinch to zoom... Setting changes are so quick and easy.
B00DMS0LCO,7,15,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,7,16,The camera also has a good grip and the detachable lcd screen is a nice to have feature
B00DMS0LCO,7,17,This camera does everything the more expensive camera does... Great pix... Movies... plus you get 1.6 mag factor which means a lot when you shoot wildlife as I do.
B00DMS0LCO,7,18,I love the fact that its not as heavey and bulky.
B00DMS0LCO,7,19,Very good quality pictures
B00DMS0LCO,7,20,Canon certainly has a high quality lineup, and has gone the distance in putting forth a lower priced high quality camera for the masses.
B00DMS0LCO,7,21,Great deal on a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,7,22,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,7,23,The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good.
B00DMS0LCO,7,24,The camera has a good feel to it and although it is a bit heavier that previous camera I've owned it still feels good in my hands.
B00DMS0LCO,8,0,I have the 18-135 and it is a great lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,1,I have a 50mm lens and will be getting better lenses....
B00DMS0LCO,8,2,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,8,3,I wanted the "body only" and quickly found the price of the body only was still the same.
B00DMS0LCO,8,4,The included 18mm-55mm kit lens is, well, the included kit lens; no frills but sufficient to get you started.
B00DMS0LCO,8,5,This is a great camera and the packaged kit lens is quite good if you get the 18-135mm.
B00DMS0LCO,8,6,I'm not going to restate all the excellent attributes of the camera and lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,7,Good kit lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,8,I usually shoot with a 24-105mm lens, so this lens feels a little cheaper than the L quality I'm accustomed to.
B00DMS0LCO,8,9,Great camera if APS-C-sized sensor is what you're looking for.
B00DMS0LCO,8,10,a sony RX100?
B00DMS0LCO,8,11,The 18-35 mm kit lens gives a lot of range, and I tested the camera out with my other lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,8,12,Pair this camera with an STM lens and you've got camcorder like video on a DSLR.The 18-135mm kit lens gives you a great range as a walk around lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,13,I just purchased this beauty with the 18-55 STM lens and the 55-250 IS lens kit.
B00DMS0LCO,8,14,I have had this camera for a little over a month now and am only working with the kit lens and body right out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,8,15,The lens is relatively sharp, especially for a kit lens.Overall, if you think you might ever want to shoot video then I'd definitely take this over Nikon, Sony, or any other manufacturer's current offerings in the price range.
B00DMS0LCO,8,16,I currently own a Canon Xti + Tamron 17mm-50mm f/2.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,17,If you do not HAVE to have a full frame DSLR, this is the best Canon APS-C DSLR ever.
B00DMS0LCO,8,18,I also bought a camera bag to hold all the stuff, lens filters to protect the lenses, and a 50mm 1.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,19,I have owned Canons for about the past 20 years and have to say this is the best I have owned yet for the price point.The stock lens: Excellent lens for a kit lens and truly responsive in terms of focus vs. stabilization and lighting.
B00DMS0LCO,8,20,Even better, if makes a great second body if you shoot full frame but want to have more options for your existing lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,8,21,IS USM zoom - my heaviest lens at the moment - the camera feels surprisingly balanced.The crop sensor obviously changes the effect of the lenses, but having a full sensor and a crop sensor both, it's like having 2 sets of lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,8,22,Best Canon at this price point yet!
B00DMS0LCO,8,23,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.
B00DMS0LCO,8,24,I went with the 18-135mm lens, as it will give me the best overall range for just about any photos that I will want to take.
B00DMS0LCO,9,0,Images are softer than expected.
B00DMS0LCO,9,1,I am very impressed with the image quality in low or ambient light, where the ISO is under 1000.
B00DMS0LCO,9,2,The image quality is excellent, with good, low ISO noise up to ISO 3200, and, with good noise-reduction software, up to 12,800.Although I bought it for ISO 25,600, where the image quality is adequate with noise reduction, I find its video features very good.
B00DMS0LCO,9,3,Colors are preserved better at high ISOs.
B00DMS0LCO,9,4,The low light performance is fantastic with the noise levels almost unnoticeable even at ISO 6400.
B00DMS0LCO,9,5,Great image quality & amazing autofocus!
B00DMS0LCO,9,6,Easy to use, with good image quality and lots of options.
B00DMS0LCO,9,7,Better than expected.
B00DMS0LCO,9,8,*insane Gollumesque giggling* Canon would like you to know that they can make a 40 megapixel image sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,9,9,Excellent Quality Build and Impressive Photos.
B00DMS0LCO,9,10,They are higher priced and do not have the quality of this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,9,11,Amazing picture quality!
B00DMS0LCO,9,12,The range of the ISO and the shutter speed is great and the difference it makes in the picture quality is amazing!
B00DMS0LCO,9,13,This camera makes taking pictures or video in low light easy, no visible noise at even very high ISO.
B00DMS0LCO,9,14,Canon certainly has a high quality lineup, and has gone the distance in putting forth a lower priced high quality camera for the masses.
B00DMS0LCO,9,15,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,9,16,Being able to produce high quality photos, however, is almost immediate, thanks to the many automated controls built in.
B00DMS0LCO,9,17,Noise levels are low, even when shooting RAW and the video quality is great though not a vast improvement.
B00DMS0LCO,9,18,Those two also have slightly more detail from their 24 MP sensors, similar high-ISO noise, and less shadow noise at low ISO.
B00DMS0LCO,9,19,Coming from a T2i the image quality is excellent (specially in low light).
B00DMS0LCO,9,20,Should be better in 2013.
B00DMS0LCO,9,21,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,9,22,I am coming from a T3I (which I was more than happy with the image quality but needed more features).
B00DMS0LCO,9,23,Video is about average when indoors or in low light, but that's to be expected.
B00DMS0LCO,9,24,I wouldn't say the photo quality is much nicer in my opinion, because I have printed out two 11x14s and I really cannot tell a quality difference from 10 MP to 20.2 MP at that size.
B00DMS0LCO,10,0,Great camera!
B00DMS0LCO,10,1,This camera has won me over and it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,10,2,I bought the right one.
B00DMS0LCO,10,3,This is a great camera for the price.
B00DMS0LCO,10,4,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,5,I ended up putting more money into a camera than I had planed, And my nervous stomach ache is gone.
B00DMS0LCO,10,6,Great deal on a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,7,Great product.
B00DMS0LCO,10,8,Over priced.
B00DMS0LCO,10,9,Buy this camera!!
B00DMS0LCO,10,10,when I bought this camera, I was scared to buy something I thought I was maybe overspending on a product I would not need.
B00DMS0LCO,10,11,I bought this camera for videography and couldn't be more happy with it.
B00DMS0LCO,10,12,great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,13,Highly recommended.
B00DMS0LCO,10,14,Also, the amazon price was $1200 when I bought it - and I am surprised that the price has dropped at all.
B00DMS0LCO,10,15,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,16,I love it !!!
B00DMS0LCO,10,17,I love this  camera !!!
B00DMS0LCO,10,18,Very good quality pictures
B00DMS0LCO,10,19,They are higher priced and do not have the quality of this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,20,Highly recommended!!
B00DMS0LCO,10,21,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,10,22,As Great As Advertised!
B00DMS0LCO,10,23,For the money I think this camera is well worth it.
B00DMS0LCO,10,24,Definitely worth the money
B00DMS0LCO,11,0,Good Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,1,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,2,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,11,3,Excellent Camera with Great Features.
B00DMS0LCO,11,4,Great Camera!
B00DMS0LCO,11,5,very good.
B00DMS0LCO,11,6,Great DSLR !
B00DMS0LCO,11,7,The camera has a good feel to it and although it is a bit heavier that previous camera I've owned it still feels good in my hands.
B00DMS0LCO,11,8,70D What a great camera!
B00DMS0LCO,11,9,Excellent DSLR for beginner and intermediate photographers alike.
B00DMS0LCO,11,10,Helpful, great illustrations.
B00DMS0LCO,11,11,I really like the features of this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,12,Just a really good camera that will take me years to really learn but will provide me with strong photos and videos.
B00DMS0LCO,11,13,I'm a professional photographer and we have ventured into the photo booth business.
B00DMS0LCO,11,14,great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,15,Easy to use, with good image quality and lots of options.
B00DMS0LCO,11,16,Takes excellent pictures, especially for an amateur like me.
B00DMS0LCO,11,17,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,11,18,Excellent camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,19,I am not a professional photographer, but I was looking for good, high quality photos and I knew the 70D would give me all that I was looking for in a camera for many years to come.
B00DMS0LCO,11,20,You do have to know some of the basics of how DSLR cameras work.
B00DMS0LCO,11,21,I def recommend this camera to any amateur photographer like myself.
B00DMS0LCO,11,22,I hope I can learn to use 20% of the features on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,23,Excellant Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,24,In the hands of a pro this would be an even better camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,0,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,1,However, it's still very good.
B00DMS0LCO,12,2,Too good for me.
B00DMS0LCO,12,3,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,12,4,The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good.
B00DMS0LCO,12,5,I love the autofocus on video.
B00DMS0LCO,12,6,I love it !!!
B00DMS0LCO,12,7,I love this  camera !!!
B00DMS0LCO,12,8,It has some amazing added features, also.
B00DMS0LCO,12,9,very good.
B00DMS0LCO,12,10,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,12,11,I was amazed and the people who watched my video's in HD were surprised.
B00DMS0LCO,12,12,The autofocus in video is AMAZING...
B00DMS0LCO,12,13,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,12,14,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,12,15,Great Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,16,This camera/lens produce amazing photos and videos.
B00DMS0LCO,12,17,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,12,18,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,12,19,All the cameras do a great job efficiently.
B00DMS0LCO,12,20,Shoots some great footage.
B00DMS0LCO,12,21,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,12,22,Amazing!
B00DMS0LCO,12,23,Once more I know that I have a very good camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,24,The 70Ds video shooting is SO incredibly good that I am now looking for opportunities to record things!
B00DMS0LCO,13,0,It would still work but it was not tactile.
B00DMS0LCO,13,1,I have been using this camera during a couple of days and i can say only good things about it.
B00DMS0LCO,13,2,I've only had it a few weeks, but so far it has worked very well.
B00DMS0LCO,13,3,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,13,4,Very good quality pictures
B00DMS0LCO,13,5,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,13,6,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,13,7,I have to return my new Tamron 24-75mm lens because of this problem.
B00DMS0LCO,13,8,I've never considered myself a serious videographer, but this camera could change that.Battery Life: Battery life seems very good and I am still working off the same charge from when I pulled the camera out of the box about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,13,9,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,13,10,wanted to let people know that I am getting about 950 photo's and about 25 minutes of video per battery charge.
B00DMS0LCO,13,11,But overall, it seemed like a nice lens and shoots nice pictures.BATTERY LIFEWithout WiFi the battery life is quite good.
B00DMS0LCO,13,12,I took it out of the box and the Live View mode wasn't working reliably: I had to reset the camera twice by pulling the battery out in the first few hours of use.
B00DMS0LCO,13,13,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,13,14,fine camera.
B00DMS0LCO,13,15,It's surprising because I've only had the camera for a few weeks and hadn't really taken it out of the house.
B00DMS0LCO,13,16,I had second thoughts but turns out the Canon charger worked and battery had no issues whatsoever.
B00DMS0LCO,13,17,I have to say that from the little time i've owned it, i can see why.
B00DMS0LCO,13,18,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,13,19,This works well, and the plethora of upgraded features from the previous models is, well "what I expected from these things years ago".
B00DMS0LCO,13,20,It shoots stills just fine, but the moment i try and shoot video, after a very brief period of time (like maybe 30 seconds to a minute) the camera will stop recording and display the dreaded error message "please ensure that lens is properly attached".
B00DMS0LCO,13,21,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,13,22,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,13,23,At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.
B00DMS0LCO,13,24,The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good.
B00DMS0LCO,14,0,I find that getting used to the touch screen may take some time & again I worry a tad about the durability of a screen that can be rotated six ways from Sunday, but the controls are all in the right places & the menus on the touch screen make sense and are easy to get through.
B00DMS0LCO,14,1,I Just have one big observation, CHEAP!!
B00DMS0LCO,14,2,That is why I took one star away.I found the touch LCD and touch control screen on top of the 70D quite useful and adapted to them quickly.
B00DMS0LCO,14,3,Body is not too big and not too small, just right!
B00DMS0LCO,14,4,This was the first thing I tried, and the screen auto-flips when it is rotated.
B00DMS0LCO,14,5,I should note that I used the viewfinder primarily rather than the LCD screen for the pics.I found it very frustrating that the camera does not have a dedicated button for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,14,6,It even implements iPhone-like viewing of images you have taken.
B00DMS0LCO,14,7,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,14,8,The camera is comfortable to hold, and is lite but doesn't feel cheap.
B00DMS0LCO,14,9,On a normal camera this would have been impossible as i couldn't see the screen, but not on the 70D! it was a cinch to simply flip out the screen and rotate it down to easily pull focus and see what i was filming.
B00DMS0LCO,14,10,It is significantly larger than the Rebels and I think that is what I like about it since I always felt the Rebel was a bit small.On-camera Flash: The last thing I'll mention is the on-camera flash.
B00DMS0LCO,14,11,I did not think I would like the touch screen but it turns out I use it most of the time to adjust my settings.
B00DMS0LCO,14,12,I hate the feel!!
B00DMS0LCO,14,13,Simply squeeze two fingers together to display more than a single photo, of drag your fingers apart to return to a single photo.
B00DMS0LCO,14,14,The addition of the touch screen makes it much easier for me to adjust settings.
B00DMS0LCO,14,15,Simply compose a shot, touch the specific point on the Live View screen and the 70d can be set up to quickly focus on that spot and shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,14,16,If you read all the hype, when you get it you will be a little disappointed it doesn't have a scratch your butt button isn't on it.
B00DMS0LCO,14,17,It can also be very useful when you have to be in front of the camera, and are still trying to control what goes on behind it, as you can just rotate the screen all the way forward, and not to have to pester whatever unlucky friend you roped into helping you film your project every five seconds about what the shot looks like, lighting, focus, etc.I have read several reviews making the bold claim that the 70D is in fact the greatest APS-C sensor camera...ever.
B00DMS0LCO,14,18,No LCD tilt or touch.
B00DMS0LCO,14,19,No LCD tilt or touch.
B00DMS0LCO,14,20,The T4i sensor had a couple of phase-detect pixels in the middle to make things less bad.
B00DMS0LCO,14,21,I have to return my new Tamron 24-75mm lens because of this problem.
B00DMS0LCO,14,22,The camera also has a good grip and the detachable lcd screen is a nice to have feature
B00DMS0LCO,14,23,I believe it is still mostly plastic, but is well built.
B00DMS0LCO,14,24,If you want a bigger body then just get a added grip, problem solved.
B00DMS0LCO,15,0,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,15,1,Focus Issue using the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,15,2,I never had this problem, or any other issue, with my T3i.
B00DMS0LCO,15,3,The subject was out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,4,The 19 point autofocus system, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder, consistently miss-focus the pictures, with my Canon 300mm F4 IS L lens.
B00DMS0LCO,15,5,If you want to take video pictures, this is the only SLR available at this time, where your subject will remain in focus as they move.
B00DMS0LCO,15,6,Liking the new features having moved up from a canon t3i.
B00DMS0LCO,15,7,Firmware updates since may have negated that issue; I don't know.
B00DMS0LCO,15,8,But for those who may be considering moving up the Canon line or hopping in for the first time hopefully I can help.
B00DMS0LCO,15,9,I really like the revision to the autofocus point selection options in the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,15,10,Instead, you have to flip the switch and use the live view mode.
B00DMS0LCO,15,11,(The situation is much better when using liveview auto-focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,12,(The situation is much better when using liveview auto-focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,13,With my 60D, I had to focus manually, or use autofocus in still-picture mode before switching to video.
B00DMS0LCO,15,14,Now it's in focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,15,There's no focus-racking when focus stops.
B00DMS0LCO,15,16,I had to switch back and forth and was frustrated as I prefer to use the viewfinder but HAVE to use live view for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,15,17,Or better yet....fix it!Update 3/30/14I am sending the camera in for repairsThe lenses I use on this camera are the:- Sigma 1.8 18-35mm- Canon 1.8 85mm- Canon 3.5-5.6
B00DMS0LCO,15,18,If you're more advanced, it simplifies Live View autofocus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,19,I usually leave it in the Auto-Selection AF mode, and found that the 19 cross-type AF points do a MUCH better job of auto-selecting the focus points.
B00DMS0LCO,15,20,Focussing with live view is no problem but focussing correctly when using fast lenses (Sigma f1.8) through the viewfinder results in many missed shots.
B00DMS0LCO,15,21,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,15,22,While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,15,23,Two caveats: it only works with contrast-detect AF and it can't be enabled while recording is in progress.
B00DMS0LCO,15,24,But for videos with moving subjects, this is the zero square.
B00DMS0LCO,16,0,Said i can send my brand new camera for repair.
B00DMS0LCO,16,1,I gave it a 1 star because of the customer service I received from canon not for the camera itself because i never got see how the camera performs.
B00DMS0LCO,16,2,The pictures were so concerning I called Canon tech support (which was excellent by the way).
B00DMS0LCO,16,3,When i called canon the guy treated me as if I was stupid and was telling me there is no way that there can be a err 30 code because thats a lens error and usually happens after a lot of use.
B00DMS0LCO,16,4,Once you've connected your phone to the camera's hotspot you just launch the Canon app.
B00DMS0LCO,16,5,putting this in 1 star just because of audio.
B00DMS0LCO,16,6,does not have Wi-Fi capability, the opposite of the original product description on the Canon USA website.
B00DMS0LCO,16,7,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,8,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,16,9,My only real disappointment is that it does not have a built-in GPS sensor and I haven't figured out how to make the Canon IOS app work with the GPS.
B00DMS0LCO,16,10,After discussion, Amazon agreed to send a replacement but this did not arrive in time for my flight and was cancelled.I wrote, I called, I suggested that the replacement be delivered directly.
B00DMS0LCO,16,11,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,12,If you agree please sign the petition here and maybe we can get Canon to change this:[...]Update 3/27/14:Check out this video for more info: www dot youtube dot com / watch?v=cA6JnzYSDJEThis is a real problem and if I could still return the camera I would.CANON PLEASE RESPOND.
B00DMS0LCO,16,13,In my case Tamron service was aware of the issue and under warranty upgraded my lenses firmware and now everything works perfectly.
B00DMS0LCO,16,14,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,16,15,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,16,16,Canon will probably respond with an update to resolve the issue as they have in the past.
B00DMS0LCO,16,17,No GPS -- otherwise great.
B00DMS0LCO,16,18,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,16,19,I purchased two off-brand batteries as backups to the Canon battery, and I've never been left stranded yet and I use the WiFi a lot.SUMMARYOverall this is a great camera and I highly recommend it!
B00DMS0LCO,16,20,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,16,21,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,16,22,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,16,23,This works well, and the plethora of upgraded features from the previous models is, well "what I expected from these things years ago".
B00DMS0LCO,16,24,I have been using this camera during a couple of days and i can say only good things about it.
B00DMS0LCO,17,0,Hence in low light, in LV mode the camera will not focus at all!
B00DMS0LCO,17,1,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,17,2,Auto focus is great, manual focus is great.
B00DMS0LCO,17,3,In LV mode, when you are switching between still photo shooting modes using mode dial, LV switches off which is somewhat annoying.8.
B00DMS0LCO,17,4,You can use manual focus if you need more control.
B00DMS0LCO,17,5,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,6,Lastly, I think it would be really convenient, if in VF mode, when you are switching shooting modes using mode dial, the LV panel could automatically show the information about that shooting mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,7,However in AF quick mode you cannot select a region to focus (tap to focus)!4.
B00DMS0LCO,17,8,This means continuous shoot is not useable in LV mode!
B00DMS0LCO,17,9,It also works perfectly while shooting videos where the focus changes during the shot.
B00DMS0LCO,17,10,I have had a DSLR previously, but always kept it in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,11,I only shoot in manual, I don't see an advantage with the other modes.
B00DMS0LCO,17,12,A new button near the shutter changes AF modes.
B00DMS0LCO,17,13,I did not think I would like the touch screen but it turns out I use it most of the time to adjust my settings.
B00DMS0LCO,17,14,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,17,15,Auto White Balance is Almost Perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,17,16,The subject was out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,17,17,The 19 cross-type AF points is more than what I need but there is no way to select the AF points in Basic modes (A+, No Flash, CA) when using VF.
B00DMS0LCO,17,18,all their auto white balance was horrible.
B00DMS0LCO,17,19,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,17,20,With my 60D, I had to focus manually, or use autofocus in still-picture mode before switching to video.
B00DMS0LCO,17,21,This mode allows selection of the exposure range to as much as +- 3 EV.
B00DMS0LCO,17,22,You can either have it auto-focus and track faces (works well if the face isn't moving too fast), AF zone mode (meaning you choose a certain zone of the screen and the camera focuses on whatever moves into that zone), or just touch a point on the screen and the camera will focus to it until you touch somewhere else.-Viewfinder:
B00DMS0LCO,17,23,All 3 that I tried had the same Auto Focus problems that could not be corrected by the AF Micro Adjustment.
B00DMS0LCO,17,24,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,18,0,(Yes that is a must as you tend to press buttons and you can get unexpected results).
B00DMS0LCO,18,1,I wish I can assign the WB to a button, but you can not.
B00DMS0LCO,18,2,It just shows how many "clicks" are on your shutter, in your camera.
B00DMS0LCO,18,3,The live feed doesn't come back until a few seconds after you've released the shutter button.
B00DMS0LCO,18,4,Shutter speed, how long th shutter remains open 1/x is also set automatically, as well as the ISO setting.)
B00DMS0LCO,18,5,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,18,6,The main difference is being able to shoot movies now... flip one switch and press the record button!
B00DMS0LCO,18,7,It keeps subjects that move at one speed in focus instead of repeatedly snapping in and out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,18,8,It does not remember it.And so many cons.7.Focus, for the second time: Only good for stationary subject.
B00DMS0LCO,18,9,A new button near the shutter changes AF modes.
B00DMS0LCO,18,10,There are lots of buttons and dials to press and turn plus the LCD touch screen options, so you have a lot of ground to cover in just knowing what and when to press what.
B00DMS0LCO,18,11,shutter would click when the live view button was pressed, but the LCD screen would stay blank.
B00DMS0LCO,18,12,I wanted more shots per second and this baby flies.
B00DMS0LCO,18,13,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,18,14,Works like a charm (after I got used to the somewhat tinny sound of the shutter).-
B00DMS0LCO,18,15,It also works perfectly while shooting videos where the focus changes during the shot.
B00DMS0LCO,18,16,What you will notice a difference in is the rate at which photos can be shot and processed.
B00DMS0LCO,18,17,Example: you can not assign the buttons you like.
B00DMS0LCO,18,18,In LV mode, when you are switching between still photo shooting modes using mode dial, LV switches off which is somewhat annoying.8.
B00DMS0LCO,18,19,If you want to take video pictures, this is the only SLR available at this time, where your subject will remain in focus as they move.
B00DMS0LCO,18,20,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,18,21,I did not think I would like the touch screen but it turns out I use it most of the time to adjust my settings.
B00DMS0LCO,18,22,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,18,23,I haven't edited any of the video, so I do no know if the lens sounds show up on the video.
B00DMS0LCO,18,24,UpdateSo I have had more time to work with the camera and getting used to its ergonomics.
B00DMS0LCO,19,0,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,19,1,I also purchased the PNY 62GB SXD memory card, I would rather have more than less.
B00DMS0LCO,19,2,I have also used the WiFi to transfer photos to my computer, but its pretty slow, so I usually just use the USB cable instead.-Drive
B00DMS0LCO,19,3,In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card.
B00DMS0LCO,19,4,When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't.
B00DMS0LCO,19,5,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,19,6,I have a NAS, I find it very convenient to transfer my files into it without turning my PC on.
B00DMS0LCO,19,7,Third-party software will do all that, but only with a cable.
B00DMS0LCO,19,8,Amazon sold this 70d to me as new, it came with with a memory card with other peoples pictures on it.Obviously not new.
B00DMS0LCO,19,9,Going from Nikon to Canon is like going from a Microsoft PC to an Apple PC.
B00DMS0LCO,19,10,But overall, it seemed like a nice lens and shoots nice pictures.BATTERY LIFEWithout WiFi the battery life is quite good.
B00DMS0LCO,19,11,It just works.
B00DMS0LCO,19,12,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,19,13,However, if you're downloading pictures to your device, a real internet connection will be faster than using the camera as an access point.
B00DMS0LCO,19,14,Arrived quickly as promised, but would not recognize or format mem card.
B00DMS0LCO,19,15,So when I read about the 70D I decided to go for it with the 18-135 lens and a super fast 80mb/s transfer rate memory card, are real must for high end video.
B00DMS0LCO,19,16,In one-shot mode, this difference is invisible; very fast cards would only make sense if you were time-limited on card-to-computer transfers with a USB 3.0, SATA, or Firewire card reader.IN SUM:This is the most significant DSLR Canon has introduced since the 7D.
B00DMS0LCO,19,17,Shots can be taken in RAW and/or JPEG, saved to the memory card for post processing in your favorite software.
B00DMS0LCO,19,18,She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one.
B00DMS0LCO,19,19,It worked as promised with a solid Wifi connection.
B00DMS0LCO,19,20,It has built in wifi that syncs to your phone, tablet and computer.
B00DMS0LCO,19,21,With WiFi on (especially when the camera is acting as the access point), the battery goes pretty quickly.
B00DMS0LCO,19,22,Built in Wifi allows sharing photos with smartphones and you can also use the smartphone as a remote.
B00DMS0LCO,19,23,I also wish there were more edit options on the camera and an easier path to direct internet upload.
B00DMS0LCO,19,24,But lets me honest, most of us who do photography and cinematography often do all of our editing from computer software outside of the camera ie lightroom/photoshop etc.
B00DMS0LCO,20,0,I've always been a Canon loyalist.
B00DMS0LCO,20,1,I also own a Canon PowerShot s95.
B00DMS0LCO,20,2,I went the Canon DSLR route due to looking at astrophotography.
B00DMS0LCO,20,3,Canon was a no-brainer - I wouldn't buy anything else.
B00DMS0LCO,20,4,They were polite and blamed them selves not the canon.
B00DMS0LCO,20,5,I should've bought a replacement for the Canon PowerShot s95.So I sent the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 back and purchased the Sony RX100 II.
B00DMS0LCO,20,6,Upgraded from a Canon Rebel XS.
B00DMS0LCO,20,7,My first DSLR.
B00DMS0LCO,20,8,My first Canon DSLR was an EOS 40D that I bought in 2007 to photograph my daughter's senior year as a collegiate gymnast.
B00DMS0LCO,20,9,I have purchased a series of Nikon DSLR cameras over the years, but decided to purchase this Canon EOS 70D camera based on the good reviews of its video capability.
B00DMS0LCO,20,10,This is the first SLR I have owned, and it took me a long time to decide what model to purchase.
B00DMS0LCO,20,11,Something like a Canon Rebel T5i + Canon EF 28 mm f/1.8 USM may be just what you need.
B00DMS0LCO,20,12,So apparently Canon is doing something to win over these tourists to Florida.
B00DMS0LCO,20,13,This works well, and the plethora of upgraded features from the previous models is, well "what I expected from these things years ago".
B00DMS0LCO,20,14,I purchased this camera as an upgrade from the Canon EOS Rebel XTi that I've had for the past several years.
B00DMS0LCO,20,15,This is my first DSLR, making the jump from point and shoot zoom camera (Panasonic FZ100).
B00DMS0LCO,20,16,Canon EOS 70D rating.
B00DMS0LCO,20,17,This review is coming from someone upgrading from a Canon Kiss X4 (T2i/550D).
B00DMS0LCO,20,18,After accumulating four lenses, I kicked myself for not waiting to buy a Nikon instead.
B00DMS0LCO,20,19,However, I found a Rebel XS on clearance, and so bought it.
B00DMS0LCO,20,20,Of course it had to be a Canon that could fit my previous four lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,20,21,This is the third Canon DSLR that I have used (20d way back when, 7d more recently, now this), and I think it may well be the best in just about every respect.
B00DMS0LCO,20,22,I had an earlier EOS model that I'd had for several years and was expecting this one to feel about the same.
B00DMS0LCO,20,23,The Canon EOS 70D borrows many features from the Canon lineup.
B00DMS0LCO,20,24,I'd researched it, consider the Nikon, but I still think I've made the right choice for me.
B00DMS0LCO,21,0,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,21,1,This one did not go on if the lens cap was on, nor could you put the lens cap on if the hood was attached.
B00DMS0LCO,21,2,I have had this camera for a little over a month now and am only working with the kit lens and body right out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,21,3,The replacement started charging from 0-49%.-The rear lens cap on the kit lens was marred noticeably.-The
B00DMS0LCO,21,4,I have to return my new Tamron 24-75mm lens because of this problem.
B00DMS0LCO,21,5,The lens hood I received was poor.
B00DMS0LCO,21,6,Good kit lens.
B00DMS0LCO,21,7,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,21,8,The included 18mm-55mm kit lens is, well, the included kit lens; no frills but sufficient to get you started.
B00DMS0LCO,21,9,Be careful and make sure that the hood you get can be applied together with the lens cap!
B00DMS0LCO,21,10,Remember, with a multiplier of 1.6, your 200s are 320s, and your 85 portrait lens becomes a 135 sports lens!
B00DMS0LCO,21,11,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,21,12,I also bought a camera bag to hold all the stuff, lens filters to protect the lenses, and a 50mm 1.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,21,13,I realized I might get better results with a better (prime?) lens but I also realized that the camera was just too big and heavy and that I was probably going to leave it home most of the time.
B00DMS0LCO,21,14,Comes surprisingly close to the 24-105mm L lens, but with a wider range and a lot lower price.
B00DMS0LCO,21,15,To my surprise it was not going to have a mag body just plastic.
B00DMS0LCO,21,16,After using my camera for 10 days the buttons on the back (Menu/Playback/Q) stopped working.
B00DMS0LCO,21,17,I have a 50mm lens and will be getting better lenses....
B00DMS0LCO,21,18,They worked again when I tilted the camera at an angle and this might be because of some loose contact .
B00DMS0LCO,21,19,On my nifty fifty canon 50mm 1.8 i get fantastic image quality, but the lens motor does make a bit of noise, that can sometimes be noticeable.
B00DMS0LCO,21,20,Been using the camera for a month, there are no complaints about it.
B00DMS0LCO,21,21,I may consider a battery grip for this camera and have owned a couple of Canon battery grips with previous Canons.
B00DMS0LCO,21,22,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,21,23,Even better, if makes a great second body if you shoot full frame but want to have more options for your existing lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,21,24,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,22,0,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,22,1,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,22,2,Too good for me.
B00DMS0LCO,22,3,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,22,4,Video is about average when indoors or in low light, but that's to be expected.
B00DMS0LCO,22,5,The video and shooting autofocus work great although I have had a few times where it would not autofocus on something usually in really low light conditions.
B00DMS0LCO,22,6,I do wish at times I could soften the image because the detail can be too telling.
B00DMS0LCO,22,7,(with decent light conditions)Color Saturation and Image quality were good (with decent light)7fps was fast enough for me.Weather resistance was useful.Tilt screen was useful.18-135
B00DMS0LCO,22,8,Half of the still photos were not clearly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,22,9,I am very impressed with the image quality in low or ambient light, where the ISO is under 1000.
B00DMS0LCO,22,10,Auto focus is great, manual focus is great.
B00DMS0LCO,22,11,I did some close ups of outdoor and family indoor shots under varying lighting conditions and in all instance great images.
B00DMS0LCO,22,12,The image quality is excellent, with good, low ISO noise up to ISO 3200, and, with good noise-reduction software, up to 12,800.Although I bought it for ISO 25,600, where the image quality is adequate with noise reduction, I find its video features very good.
B00DMS0LCO,22,13,On general photos, the quality has been excellent.
B00DMS0LCO,22,14,It produces excellent quality stills and videos under a variety of conditions.
B00DMS0LCO,22,15,Very good quality pictures
B00DMS0LCO,22,16,All mirrorless bodies still do this in low light and most in bright light.(+)
B00DMS0LCO,22,17,Face-tracking is effective even with conventional indoor household lighting.(+/-)
B00DMS0LCO,22,18,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,22,19,The color is nice, though I did tweak the vibrancy a bit on most my photos, but they were true to life, I just like my colors bolder.
B00DMS0LCO,22,20,It also works perfectly while shooting videos where the focus changes during the shot.
B00DMS0LCO,22,21,Photo colors were not true unless taken in direct sunlight.
B00DMS0LCO,22,22,I needed a DSLR which can capture videos and take photos in low light.
B00DMS0LCO,22,23,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,22,24,The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good.
B00DMS0LCO,23,0,If you get a camera that is used I would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one.
B00DMS0LCO,23,1,See the Amazon review by Mr. Ralph J. Secoy.
B00DMS0LCO,23,2,Amazon said it was new, it was not.
B00DMS0LCO,23,3,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,4,Returned for replacement - hope it's OK!
B00DMS0LCO,23,5,It will be returned.
B00DMS0LCO,23,6,Got a used camera from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,7,I bought two and both were defective out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,23,8,I purchased this camera about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,23,9,At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,10,After reading everything that was out there about this camera, I decided to buy one.
B00DMS0LCO,23,11,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,23,12,Do not buy a 70D from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,13,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,23,14,I really liked this camera but had to return it for a defect.
B00DMS0LCO,23,15,Read the professional reviews.
B00DMS0LCO,23,16,I researched this camera well online before deciding to purchase.
B00DMS0LCO,23,17,When researching my purchase, I initially thought I would purchase the Canon T5i, but after reading various reviews, I decided to go for the 70D.
B00DMS0LCO,23,18,Amazon is selling used cameras as new!
B00DMS0LCO,23,19,Read their review.
B00DMS0LCO,23,20,Disappointing Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,23,21,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,23,22,OK, this is a first for me when dealing with Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,23,As a result, I've paid full-price for an 'open-box' (being charitable) product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,24,Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.
B00DMS0LCO,24,0,The operations are really easy, and I really like this camera
B00DMS0LCO,24,1,Take the time to carefully read the manual on setting it up.
B00DMS0LCO,24,2,You can also remotely change all the settings of the camera from the phone.
B00DMS0LCO,24,3,operating manual before you buy, IMHO.)
B00DMS0LCO,24,4,Like any new system there is the typical learning curve but very easy to use.
B00DMS0LCO,24,5,You can use manual focus if you need more control.
B00DMS0LCO,24,6,What's better is that almost every control you might ever need to adjust while shooting is accessible through the screen, meaning you don't have to fumble around with buttons, knobs or navigate menus to adjust your shot settings.The 70D has a reasonable HDR shooting mode, which is a function I always want on my cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,24,7,New Canon user!
B00DMS0LCO,24,8,Oh, and by the way, the screen is touch controlled.
B00DMS0LCO,24,9,I am working with the A+  (Automated) basic mode for starters, (which essentially makes the camera a point and shoot) and reading the instruction manual as I go along.
B00DMS0LCO,24,10,Also I didn't find a way to enable/disable flash using the "Quick Control" button in advanced modes such as P. It is however present in basic modes such as A+!6.
B00DMS0LCO,24,11,The physical UI is better, though the menu UI is less polished, as are some software features.
B00DMS0LCO,24,12,Overall, I am very excited about my switch to Canon, I have no complaints thus far and the only thing I need to do now is learn this new button layout which I am not at all used to.
B00DMS0LCO,24,13,In LV mode, when you are switching between still photo shooting modes using mode dial, LV switches off which is somewhat annoying.8.
B00DMS0LCO,24,14,The touch-screen also works very well, with all the familiar gestures from your touch-screen phone (swipe to view next photo, pinch to zoom, etc.).
B00DMS0LCO,24,15,I went through everything without reading the manual, and then hit a snag with video audio levels, so then I went for the manual which was no help, so then to the info Disc that comes with all Canons.
B00DMS0LCO,24,16,You can use it with the Canon apps to take simple shots or the third party DSLR Controller app (Android) and control many if not most of the 70D functions from your droid phone or tablet.
B00DMS0LCO,24,17,I have found the WiFi most useful for using the EOS Remote app on my iPhone to remotely view photos, or control the camera from my iPhone.
B00DMS0LCO,24,18,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,24,19,Lastly, I think it would be really convenient, if in VF mode, when you are switching shooting modes using mode dial, the LV panel could automatically show the information about that shooting mode.
B00DMS0LCO,24,20,Canon engineers put a lot of thought into making thi a powerful "easy to use" camera.
B00DMS0LCO,24,21,The one complaint I have of all Canon cameras is the software... it is lame compared to Nikon Software (they offer priced pro versions, Canon does not) you have to have PhotoShop when you have a Canon, and it makes no sense because I know Canon could easily enhance their editing software (NEEDS TO BE, hello Canon, READ THIS).
B00DMS0LCO,24,22,You do have to know some of the basics of how DSLR cameras work.
B00DMS0LCO,24,23,I'm a beginner to photography, and this camera is extremely user friendly.
B00DMS0LCO,24,24,I expected this to happen but it illustrates photographers need to control the point of focus and shouldn't expect cameras to read their mind.
B00DMS0LCO,25,0,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,25,1,I'm just an amature that likes shooting video and pictures.
B00DMS0LCO,25,2,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,25,3,For what I typical shoot, this hasn't been a problem.
B00DMS0LCO,25,4,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,25,5,I have used many DSLRs including Nikon.
B00DMS0LCO,25,6,The CR2 (camera raw) files are not at all affected by this, it's a factor limited to the HD video.
B00DMS0LCO,25,7,For most people that will buy a camera just to put pictures on the internet, the 20.2 really wont' make much of a difference to them.
B00DMS0LCO,25,8,If you shoot RAW you will need to buy the new Adobe Lightroom 5 and update it to the 5.2 version to even get it to view.
B00DMS0LCO,25,9,I haven't edited any of the video, so I do no know if the lens sounds show up on the video.
B00DMS0LCO,25,10,At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.
B00DMS0LCO,25,11,This is not apparent to the naked eye when viewing the video footage, but it becomes an issue when attempting to work with the footage in a post environment.
B00DMS0LCO,25,12,I find myself constantly looking for things to photograph just because it seems like each photo pleasantly surprises me.
B00DMS0LCO,25,13,I'm kind of sick of putting up with these issues this long, but hey, "finally accomplished" is better than never.
B00DMS0LCO,25,14,I have my fingers crossed this will be dealt with in an update to the firmware.This is not a huge issue unless you intend to do extensive manipulation of your video footage in post production, but it is something to consider with this camera and DSLRs in general.
B00DMS0LCO,25,15,You won't go wrong with the true HD video capabilities either.
B00DMS0LCO,25,16,This works well, and the plethora of upgraded features from the previous models is, well "what I expected from these things years ago".
B00DMS0LCO,25,17,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,25,18,What you will notice a difference in is the rate at which photos can be shot and processed.
B00DMS0LCO,25,19,Just a really good camera that will take me years to really learn but will provide me with strong photos and videos.
B00DMS0LCO,25,20,The plates were shot in the RAW (CR2) format, using the kit lens, and stitched together using PTGui software.After some initial trial runs, where we ironed out the kinks in the whole process, the results were exceptional.
B00DMS0LCO,25,21,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,25,22,To me, this is kind of a bonus, though not in itself a reason to buy the camera.
B00DMS0LCO,25,23,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,25,24,Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.
