B0074FGLUM,6,23,Great picture2.)
B0074FGLUM,6,24,Great tv but the smart part is not for outside the US.
B0074FGLUM,7,0,Good TV but Can't Connect to internet1.
B0074FGLUM,7,1,We use the TV for our cable.
B0074FGLUM,7,2,My internet connection is very good so it is not the connection it's the tv
B0074FGLUM,7,3,It has 3 HDMI inputs.
B0074FGLUM,7,4,Do away with cable!!
B0074FGLUM,7,5,It's not because of internet connection.
B0074FGLUM,7,6,NOT A GOOD TV.
B0074FGLUM,7,7,TV Did not connect to my wireless.
B0074FGLUM,7,8,Great picture, works right out of the box.
B0074FGLUM,7,9,Works great.
B0074FGLUM,7,10,This TV has a good picture and good sound quality.
B0074FGLUM,7,11,It comes with 3 HDMI ports, and a few USB ports.
B0074FGLUM,7,12,It doesn't have an S-VHS port for my old (but cherished) S-VHS video player.
B0074FGLUM,7,13,I use it as a Monitor but wi-fi...
B0074FGLUM,7,14,This can be particularly tricky because the only ports on the TV are HDMI or USB.
B0074FGLUM,7,15,The HDMI connection with only work with Samsung DVD players, Samsung computers, etc. and will not work for devices using the HDMI cable everyone else in the industry uses.
B0074FGLUM,7,16,It includes 3 HDMI ports. 1 HDMI port also has an audio port for using with a computer with DVI to HDMI adapter.
B0074FGLUM,7,17,The setup was easy but the TV could not connect to internet with a direct or a WiFi connection.
B0074FGLUM,7,18,nice picture, not enough ports.
B0074FGLUM,7,19,HD picture doesn't look good,  may be I missed some setup.
B0074FGLUM,7,20,We have it connected via a hard connection and are not using the wireless.
B0074FGLUM,7,21,Instead one can go for a HD tv and all these can be streamed fron DVD players or any other game devices.
B0074FGLUM,7,22,HDMI ports plus a component input.-Price
B0074FGLUM,7,23,Didn't need the cable connection just needed the smart functions like netflix etc.
B0074FGLUM,7,24,Good picture.
B0074FGLUM,8,0,The tv screen is already showing issues.
B0074FGLUM,8,1,Smashed screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,2,The screen was black and red, with white spiderweb-like lines all over the plasma screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,3,I looked at it, and noticed that the screen had been shattered at the top and had spread across half the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,4,Now there is a 1/4 diameter black circle on the bottom edge of the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,5,Sometimes the screen goes completely black.
B0074FGLUM,8,6,3 months later I have dead pixels and dark lines across the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,7,Dead pixel.
B0074FGLUM,8,8,screen dead after one week.
B0074FGLUM,8,9,The TV screen is totally shattered!!!!!
B0074FGLUM,8,10,Damaged Screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,11,I purchased this TV in September of 2013 and last week the screen went black.
B0074FGLUM,8,12,A large circular space of the screen (top left) and corner of the screen (top right) was totally WHITE.
B0074FGLUM,8,13,Also the screen has a 3 inch blotch at the bottom that is visible when viewing dark scenes.
B0074FGLUM,8,14,Another issue is that the TV makes a humming noise, which I've noticed tends to be loudest when a very bright image is on the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,15,The picture is coming in black and white only.
B0074FGLUM,8,16,i got it set up and then started watching tv, then i started to notice something the sound comes and goes.
B0074FGLUM,8,17,I sit down and turn it on and all I see is a white line on top.
B0074FGLUM,8,18,I thought it was the tv protector so I left it up and I notice the screen Is just popped out from the Tv.
B0074FGLUM,8,19,the colors are very poor especially when viewed from one side not front.download
B0074FGLUM,8,20,After 6 months of use I started seeing lots of vertical lines on screen irrespective of what channel, program I was watching.
B0074FGLUM,8,21,Everything was working great until about 4 hours after the first plug-in, then the screen went blank and all we get is the flicker of the red light.
B0074FGLUM,8,22,It's almost imperceptible with a light background, but when the background is dark, it becomes annoyingly prominent.
B0074FGLUM,8,23,tv came with the broken screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,24,I was extremely disappointed when I found out that the TV screen is totally shattered after I turned it on.
B0074FGLUM,9,0,I only used it for 5 months.
B0074FGLUM,9,1,Only works until right after warranty is out... 1 year, 2 months.
B0074FGLUM,9,2,After 6 months of use Samsung UN40EH5300 stopped working!!
B0074FGLUM,9,3,this tv doses not work in Australia.
B0074FGLUM,9,4,My Samsung TV quit working just after 1 year.
B0074FGLUM,9,5,Now, however, nothing seems to work.
B0074FGLUM,9,6,Stopped working.
B0074FGLUM,9,7,I bought this TV last year.
B0074FGLUM,9,8,I purchased this TV and used it for about a month before returning it.
B0074FGLUM,9,9,I purchased this TV just a year and a few months ago and the power is out.
B0074FGLUM,9,10,Samsung UN46E5300.
B0074FGLUM,9,11,Samsung was really nasty to me about it saying it is out of warranty.
B0074FGLUM,9,12,Don't buy.
B0074FGLUM,9,13,Should have gone with my first instinct and purchased a Panasonic which I will know do.
B0074FGLUM,9,14,I had purchased Samsung UN40EH5300 smart TV almost a month ago.
B0074FGLUM,9,15,I will never buy this Samsung TV again all buy anything from themThey didn't tell us it dose not work in AustraliaBefore we got itAll its good for is the rubbish tipYou think they would of told us now I have to buy a new t
B0074FGLUM,9,16,gave out after 1.5 years!
B0074FGLUM,9,17,TV was great up until two months in.
B0074FGLUM,9,18,Don't buy!!!
B0074FGLUM,9,19,DO  NOT BUY.
B0074FGLUM,9,20,Please do not buy this TV if you are looking to buy a smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,9,21,Never again - I will never buy another Samsung product again.
B0074FGLUM,9,22,I will go with the latter, and will never buy a Samsung product again.
B0074FGLUM,9,23,I bought this television because of the brand and the price.
B0074FGLUM,9,24,New Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,10,0,Audio problems.
B0074FGLUM,10,1,It is not reinforced along the backbone with bends to keep it from being susceptible to vibrations from the *speaker ports* and wall mounts caused by the lower mounted speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,2,Problems with Speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,3,Cannot control external speaker volume.
B0074FGLUM,10,4,It is hard to plug in, especially if you have the TV wall mounted.
B0074FGLUM,10,5,The sound is so horrible I am contemplating getting a sound bar.
B0074FGLUM,10,6,The problem is that the volume control of the TV does not control the output of the external speaker.
B0074FGLUM,10,7,Need to add a sound bar if you like fuller sound.
B0074FGLUM,10,8,The TV has an external speaker connection.
B0074FGLUM,10,9,Using add-on speakers means volume control on remote does not work.
B0074FGLUM,10,10,The only way to use a headphone is the Audio out jack on the back of the TV.
B0074FGLUM,10,11,So I have no way of muting my external speakers as they are just speakers, they are not a audio receiver unit with a separate remote control.
B0074FGLUM,10,12,But we have had a problem with the sound on both monitors.
B0074FGLUM,10,13,You have to turn the sound up super-high to hear voices.
B0074FGLUM,10,14,Sometimes, I can route the sound to an outside speaker (via my receiver) and sometimes it decides that no all sound must go through the TV,.
B0074FGLUM,10,15,The sound system on this TV is horrible!
B0074FGLUM,10,16,Granted, I could get a sound bar, but shouldn't have to.[b]non
B0074FGLUM,10,17,HORRIBLE audio quality, regardless of control setting.
B0074FGLUM,10,18,Sound quality is fine.
B0074FGLUM,10,19,40 years owning tv's and I have never had the cable connector snap off of a tv set and yes 3 tv's in my home are on a pivotal wall mount.
B0074FGLUM,10,20,The picture, sound, build quality, and remote are all what I expected.
B0074FGLUM,10,21,It's light, easy to attach the base to the stand (just 8 small screws!), and the picture quality is good.Cons: The stand does not rotate or pivot.
B0074FGLUM,10,22,my only complaint is the sound quality as it sounds like the speakers are in a cardboard box.
B0074FGLUM,10,23,It has 1 set of inputs component/composite video and L/R audio.  1 audio output jack and 1 optical audio output.
B0074FGLUM,10,24,Anyway, because of this problem alone, I wouldn't buy another one.
B0074FGLUM,11,0,Samsung customer service is anything but service.
B0074FGLUM,11,1,KNOWN PROBLEM! (BUT) Samsung fixed it!
B0074FGLUM,11,2,Samsung Customer Service.
B0074FGLUM,11,3,Samsung "Customer Service" is no help, so you are on your own.
B0074FGLUM,11,4,What has happened to SAMSUNG?
B0074FGLUM,11,5,I called Samsung and they outsource their tech support to somewhere in China.
B0074FGLUM,11,6,Samsung was really nasty to me about it saying it is out of warranty.
B0074FGLUM,11,7,Nothing happened so I called again.
B0074FGLUM,11,8,update: Called Samsung service.
B0074FGLUM,11,9,I called Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,11,10,So I called Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,11,11,Samsung customer service could not resolve this.
B0074FGLUM,11,12,But nothing samsung support couldn't fix.
B0074FGLUM,11,13,I went through a month of calls to Samsung, called Netflix, called my ISP.
B0074FGLUM,11,14,Probably they don't all have the problem.
B0074FGLUM,11,15,When I called to have THAT replaced, I was told I had to wait another 2 weeks.
B0074FGLUM,11,16,Well 4 days later I called Samsung customer service and was informed 32 inch t.v.'s must be shipped to be serviced.
B0074FGLUM,11,17,I researched and saw that Samsung was the bomb.com
B0074FGLUM,11,18,Had a couple of problems with this TV and called Samsung for help.
B0074FGLUM,11,19,I waited patiently for 4 days and no calls from them.
B0074FGLUM,11,20,Samsung support is so s***ty to work with, they don't do squat to hep me.
B0074FGLUM,11,21,I've called support many times.
B0074FGLUM,11,22,Problems within a week.
B0074FGLUM,11,23,32" Samsung TV.
B0074FGLUM,11,24,I know the TV needed a hardware fix and Samsung should've sent someone out to service it, but I could not get any help from their Customer Service.
B0074FGLUM,12,0,PICTURE QUALITY.
B0074FGLUM,12,1,The picture and color is not very good though.
B0074FGLUM,12,2,It's great but...

B0074FGLUM,12,4,Changed the picture settings (following the settings another reviewer suggested) and liked the picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,12,5,The picture quality is good, not great.
B0074FGLUM,12,6,not a great image.
B0074FGLUM,12,7,Great picture quality BUT...review from an IT perspective!
B0074FGLUM,12,8,I don't see how people can think the picture quality is good, let alone great.
B0074FGLUM,12,9,The color look good to me.
B0074FGLUM,12,10,Good TV.
B0074FGLUM,12,11,Other than this picture quality and everything is very good.
B0074FGLUM,12,12,This TV was easy to set up and has great picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,12,13,MAYBE IT CAN BE ADJUSTED.....I DON'T KNOW.
B0074FGLUM,12,14,Overall good.
B0074FGLUM,12,15,Good TV at a great price.
B0074FGLUM,12,16,Great TV and picture after you get the settings right.
B0074FGLUM,12,17,Not a great one, but a good one.
B0074FGLUM,12,18,Good quality TV.
B0074FGLUM,12,19,I found there to be enough settings to make the adjustments that were needed.
B0074FGLUM,12,20,Samsung colors are animation bright.
B0074FGLUM,12,21,Nope, I don't like it at all, and really don't have much good to say about this TV!
B0074FGLUM,12,22,My previous Samsung 46" 640 has a much better picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,12,23,Poor Quality.
B0074FGLUM,12,24,Great image and sound.
B0074FGLUM,13,0,No more Samsung products for me.
B0074FGLUM,13,1,I will never buy anothey Samsung product and AMAZON  should have a disclaimer with tis information before anyone buys a Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,13,2,Never again - I will never buy another Samsung product again.
B0074FGLUM,13,3,I will go with the latter, and will never buy a Samsung product again.
B0074FGLUM,13,4,Don't buy any Samsung TV's.
B0074FGLUM,13,5,I will never by by this product again.
B0074FGLUM,13,6,Not a mature product.

B0074FGLUM,13,15,DO NOT BUY.
B0074FGLUM,13,16,Not recommended to purchase this immature product.
B0074FGLUM,13,17,It's much smarter than the samsung smart tv.
B0074FGLUM,13,18,Review for Samsung UN32EH5300 smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,13,19,Dont Buy this Smart Tv!!!!
B0074FGLUM,13,20,I will be returning this and never buying a samsung tv again.
B0074FGLUM,13,21,Please do not buy this TV if you are looking to buy a smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,13,22,My previous Samsung 46" 640 has a much better picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,13,23,I read many other reviews with the same issue.
B0074FGLUM,13,24,NOT ACTUALLY A 120HZ TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,0,Smart TV vs Chromcast.
B0074FGLUM,14,1,Not smart at all.
B0074FGLUM,14,2,smart tv???
B0074FGLUM,14,3,not very smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,4,not so smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,5,not Smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,6,samsung smart tv not so smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,7,For trying to be a smart TV, it's only 3-stars "smart."
B0074FGLUM,14,8,I  still use my chromcast for netflix since its quicker but I use the tv's other apps happily.
B0074FGLUM,14,9,Netflix app works by the way.
B0074FGLUM,14,10,Samsung Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,11,SMART TV is not really SMART.
B0074FGLUM,14,12,We can not say it is a smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,13,It is not smart enough yet.
B0074FGLUM,14,14,Netflix doesn't work TVP-805.
B0074FGLUM,14,15,Smart TV isn't so smart anymore.
B0074FGLUM,14,16,Smart seems to be a misnomer.
B0074FGLUM,14,17,Smart?
B0074FGLUM,14,18,The Netflix App had a picture of HBO2Go instead.
B0074FGLUM,14,19,Dont get a samsung tv !!!
B0074FGLUM,14,20,Not Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,21,Then both of the apps stopped working.
B0074FGLUM,14,22,samsung not so smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,23,But when it came to setting it up for Smart apps (like Netflix), it would not work.
B0074FGLUM,14,24,This is NOT a Smart TV!.
B0074FGLUM,15,0,Remote is still old traditional remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,1,My Cable box also has such a remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,2,The TV comes with a "remote controller or wand".
B0074FGLUM,15,3,This means another remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,4,So all you see after you hook it up are the HDMI cables looping trying to get behind the TV.
B0074FGLUM,15,5,All HDMI ports don't work.
B0074FGLUM,15,6,The HDMI connection with only work with Samsung DVD players, Samsung computers, etc. and will not work for devices using the HDMI cable everyone else in the industry uses.
B0074FGLUM,15,7,No universal remote?????
B0074FGLUM,15,8,I tried all the sound menu settings, but never got it to work the way I needed it to.
B0074FGLUM,15,9,When we first set this TV up, it worked fine.
B0074FGLUM,15,10,Very hard to type using this remote.I like the LG TV remotes.
B0074FGLUM,15,11,It works this time.
B0074FGLUM,15,12,My DVD I connected with an AV cable I had but could not get it to work.
B0074FGLUM,15,13,This set does not have any control buttons on the actual unit.
B0074FGLUM,15,14,I can't believe that this TV doesn't come with a universal remote to control the cable box and other accessories.
B0074FGLUM,15,15,AnyNet+ is nice because I can change the input to my PlayStation 3 with the TV remote, and it will change the input on my Onkyo receiver and turn the PS3 on, and let me control the PS3 with the TV remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,16,It seems every time I turn it on it is updating.
B0074FGLUM,15,17,Turning off and on a few times seemed to get it back to normal.
B0074FGLUM,15,18,Transmitter connects to PC,receiver connects to TV.
B0074FGLUM,15,19,Once in the app I am able to use the remote to change channels up and down and directly via the numberpad.
B0074FGLUM,15,20,Only one button on the TV itself, one button press turns on, but once the unit is on the button brings up a menu and you have to move the button around to navigate this menu.
B0074FGLUM,15,21,As it's a 'smart' TV, why don't you put a small keyboard on remote control?
B0074FGLUM,15,22,When powered on, TV will not start in Smart mode, you always have to push the button on the remote to start.-
B0074FGLUM,15,23,Disappointed in remote control controls could be more intuitive.
B0074FGLUM,15,24,Setup was easy and after plugging in the power and connecting the cable it played just fine.
B00BCGROJG,0,0,This is the brightest and clearest viewing screen that you will ever view.
B00BCGROJG,0,1,It looks great In our conference room.
B00BCGROJG,0,2,I mean if you want a good TV with a nice screen get it!!!
B00BCGROJG,0,3,Great TV for the Living Room.
B00BCGROJG,0,4,The screen size is perfect for someone that likes movies.
B00BCGROJG,0,5,Good picture.
B00BCGROJG,0,6,A great value.
B00BCGROJG,0,7,In our living room there are off angle seats and you can tell the blacks are not as dark off angle.

B00BCGROJG,0,16,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,0,17,Great bright picture, this tv is in our family room and the tv has no problem in a room with light.2.
B00BCGROJG,0,18,This Smart TV is the perfect size for our new studio room.
B00BCGROJG,0,19,The trade off though, is my plasma has burn in, and didn't look as good as this tv in a bright living room.
B00BCGROJG,0,20,I think because it's 3D they gave it a nice strong black light and 10 is about where normal viewing should be.
B00BCGROJG,0,21,Perfect screen with lighting issue gone!
B00BCGROJG,0,22,60" is the right size.
B00BCGROJG,0,23,The picture is still good, just not as great as when you are in front of it.
B00BCGROJG,0,24,Great TV, but be alerted...
B00BCGROJG,1,0,Great tv at a great price.
B00BCGROJG,1,1,Great tv
B00BCGROJG,1,2,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,1,3,Everyone would commend on how great the picture is.
B00BCGROJG,1,4,Great price.
B00BCGROJG,1,5,The best tv for the price.
B00BCGROJG,1,6,But it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,1,7,Samsung TV, so good.
B00BCGROJG,1,8,This is probably the best TV I've bought ever.
B00BCGROJG,1,9,Best tv ever.
B00BCGROJG,1,10,I love my Samsung TV!!
B00BCGROJG,1,11,Great Picture.
B00BCGROJG,1,12,None of the Sonys we liked were available (2012 models); then, we saw this Samsung for a very good price and decided to buy.
B00BCGROJG,1,13,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,14,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,15,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,1,16,Not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,1,17,We've always loved Samsung and love this TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,18,You cant get a better picture at this price.
B00BCGROJG,1,19,I really can not say enough great things about Samsung TVs.
B00BCGROJG,1,20,I wanted an LED TV vs. a Plasma, but in the store they both looked great.I've had this UN55F7100 Samsung model for about a week now.
B00BCGROJG,1,21,Samsung makes the best HD TV at a good price better than Sony and Sharp and all others.
B00BCGROJG,1,22,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,23,I love it.
B00BCGROJG,1,24,As with all Samsung Smart TV,s they are the best.
B00BCGROJG,2,0,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,1,Looks good sounds good all around great set .

B00BCGROJG,2,6,TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,2,7,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,2,8,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,9,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,10,Great picture, sound, etc....HIGHLY recommend!
B00BCGROJG,2,11,But the picture quality is great.
B00BCGROJG,2,12,A great value.
B00BCGROJG,2,13,Awesome... Except sound everything is great.
B00BCGROJG,2,14,The sound is not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,2,15,Before someone tells me that I shouldn't use tv speakers and should instead use a surround sound system, I get that.
B00BCGROJG,2,16,The sound is acceptable, but an external sound system is really necessary for sound immersion.
B00BCGROJG,2,17,This TV is GREAT!
B00BCGROJG,2,18,The sound is good, but I'm going to get some speakers for a better audio experience.
B00BCGROJG,2,19,Everything is good.
B00BCGROJG,2,20,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,21,Very good TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,22,Buy It! Great TV!
B00BCGROJG,2,23,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,2,24,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,3,0,By then I can set up a delivery date that works for me.
B00BCGROJG,3,1,I was very skeptical about ordering a tv through Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,2,There went another $20 on Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,3,it works.
B00BCGROJG,3,4,I have had tremendous success with Samsung and Amazon's service has always been good to me.
B00BCGROJG,3,5,quick delivery.
B00BCGROJG,3,6,I ordered it through Amazon, and had a delivery scheduled.
B00BCGROJG,3,7,Plus, the Amazon service was A+, as usual.
B00BCGROJG,3,8,Tried AMAZON ..4 days later, tv in house lookin' great.
B00BCGROJG,3,9,Amazon was great.
B00BCGROJG,3,10,Thanks Amazon!
B00BCGROJG,3,11,Amazon delivery was on time and TV arrived in PERFECT condition.
B00BCGROJG,3,12,TV great, customer service not so much.
B00BCGROJG,3,13,Samsung is great on all products we have owned.
B00BCGROJG,3,14,I WILL NEVER ORDER A BIG ITEM ON AMAZON AGAIN.
B00BCGROJG,3,15,Delivery went unhitched also - a first!
B00BCGROJG,3,16,The TV shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,17,Received it in two days.
B00BCGROJG,3,18,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,3,19,I've not had a problem with Amazon so I haven't had to test their customer service.
B00BCGROJG,3,20,Best picture I have seen BUT poor customer service.
B00BCGROJG,3,21,This tv is amazing, the delivery was great!!
B00BCGROJG,3,22,Problem with my set.
B00BCGROJG,3,23,Set up and everything turned to show it was in good order.
B00BCGROJG,3,24,Product works great, delivery was on time (I got to specify a 3 hour window), and they even came in and installed the base to the tv and waited for me to make sure everything worked.
B00BCGROJG,4,0,Word cannot say what a great picture this TV has.
B00BCGROJG,4,1,This Tv is a Great value.
B00BCGROJG,4,2,10 is more than enough with this set.
B00BCGROJG,4,3,The truth about this set.
B00BCGROJG,4,4,Great 3D TV.
B00BCGROJG,4,5,Great TV, but be alerted...
B00BCGROJG,4,6,Set up is easy but takes a while.
B00BCGROJG,4,7,I'm old school and this TV is easy to set up and the picture is awesome.
B00BCGROJG,4,8,Very easy to set up.
B00BCGROJG,4,9,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,4,10,Great Picture.
B00BCGROJG,4,11,The set up was easy.
B00BCGROJG,4,12,But once he did get the settings right...the picture is amazing.

B00BCGROJG,4,19,Everyone would commend on how great the picture is.
B00BCGROJG,4,20,The 3D is actually quite good under the right circumstances.
B00BCGROJG,4,21,great for watching sports, movies and gaming
B00BCGROJG,4,22,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,4,23,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,4,24,3D was great.

B00BCGROJG,5,13,This TV is GREAT!
B00BCGROJG,5,14,Great picture.
B00BCGROJG,5,15,Samsung is great on all products we have owned.
B00BCGROJG,5,16,Quality you can expect from a Samsung TV.
B00BCGROJG,5,17,I would not recommend this Samsung nor would I buy another one.
B00BCGROJG,5,18,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,5,19,The excellent reviews were right on target.
B00BCGROJG,5,20,The excellent reviews.
B00BCGROJG,5,21,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,5,22,Definitely a great buy.
B00BCGROJG,5,23,The product is really good I like the Samsung design is nice and good picture qualityAnd then like a good choice in this product
B00BCGROJG,5,24,Sound quality of the LG was great.
B00BCGROJG,6,0,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,6,1,Plus the smart tv with all the apps this tv has it all...
B00BCGROJG,6,2,They work ok, not great, but ok.
B00BCGROJG,6,3,Smart TV...is great.
B00BCGROJG,6,4,Great tv!
B00BCGROJG,6,5,Great Smart TV.
B00BCGROJG,6,6,The smart TV app?
B00BCGROJG,6,7,Previews are available on like 10 different apps.
B00BCGROJG,6,8,Loaded with apps just like your smartphone.
B00BCGROJG,6,9,Great Smart Features, they most likely have any app or service you could want.Cons:1.
B00BCGROJG,6,10,So far so good....
B00BCGROJG,6,11,love this TV perfect picture, watched our first 3d movie it was great!!! everything we have is samsung and they all work together!
B00BCGROJG,6,12,Works great on just WIFI.
B00BCGROJG,6,13,3D does work, watched few 3D movies from Netflix.
B00BCGROJG,6,14,Love my new tv.
B00BCGROJG,6,15,Love this TV and the smart TV.
B00BCGROJG,6,16,Very good TV.
B00BCGROJG,6,17,Great picture.
B00BCGROJG,6,18,The apps are great and works well, only draw back is with remote.
B00BCGROJG,6,19,There does seem to be a "flow" problem with the SMART tv at times.
B00BCGROJG,6,20,Nearly all Apps are free.
B00BCGROJG,6,21,That seems to work.I love to watch my sports, specifically hockey and with the Stanley Cup Playoffs currently playing, to me it is like watching it Live- Awesome picture.
B00BCGROJG,6,22,Micro-dimming feature and smart hub are great features.
B00BCGROJG,6,23,The internet access works very well.
B00BCGROJG,6,24,Great features.
B00BCGROJG,7,0,I've only watched cable tv so far (via the cable box and HDMI), but I've seen the Samsung GUI and it looks amazing, so I'll be trying that as soon as the tv is connected to the internet.
B00BCGROJG,7,1,I connected them with HDMI cables, while hooking sound system with optical cable directly to TV.
B00BCGROJG,7,2,Resolution looks amazing, especially while playing video games and watching HD (I wouldn't buy this TV if I didn't have these two).
B00BCGROJG,7,3,The HDMI to cable box connection assures a great out of the box picture.
B00BCGROJG,7,4,Wifi is very good and able to play many video formats over the network.
B00BCGROJG,7,5,Was plug and play right out of the box.
B00BCGROJG,7,6,SO FAR SO GOOD.
B00BCGROJG,7,7,This smart TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,7,8,It cannot be used to select a channel from the guide--I have to use my cable box remote to select channels.
B00BCGROJG,7,9,Amazing TV!!! I'm still playing with this TV but I can tell you that so far I'm in love with it.
B00BCGROJG,7,10,The TV is hooked up to the internet at first I used the wireless connection to see what the performance was like and it was fine.
B00BCGROJG,7,11,With 4 HDMI inputs and all sorts of USB drive options you can watch an endless stream of video.The sound quality is very good.
B00BCGROJG,7,12,The best Smart HD TV.
B00BCGROJG,7,13,We are able to stream videos and music from the internet.
B00BCGROJG,7,14,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,7,15,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,7,16,Anyway great picture perfect for any type viewing habit whether basic cable, VOD,  blue ray or gaming.There are 4 HDMI connections inputs I do not think most people will be disappointed with this HDTV specs,or features.
B00BCGROJG,7,17,I have my movies converted to MP4 files and they are displayed nicely and show great on the TV.
B00BCGROJG,7,18,This is where some playing with the picture mode and color/tint options may come into play.A glance at the TV's specs will show you that there are plenty of connections available.
B00BCGROJG,7,19,The TV audio is ok, but certainly not as good as my Sony system.3.
B00BCGROJG,7,20,We have a 25 Mbps Internet connection, and only a Wireless G router (54 Mbps) on the LAN side, and we have not had any problems streaming video.
B00BCGROJG,7,21,They programmed the Logitech where I only need 1 remote to work the Directv receiver, the Samsung TV, the Samsung BluRay /audio receiver.
B00BCGROJG,7,22,The resolution is really good and Samsung all share is really easy and comfortable to access my PC without cable.
B00BCGROJG,7,23,Plugged in power and HDMI and it worked.
B00BCGROJG,7,24,Moving on to the TV gadgets, it comes with a bunch of the USB ports and another bunch of HDMI ports as well a 3mm jack port for your sound and a RF so you can interact with your cable or satellite box, and also components RCA ports for your Xbox, PS3 etc.
B00BCGROJG,8,0,3 out of 3 screens had a dead pixel.
B00BCGROJG,8,1,Defective screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,2,Again, 4 red stuck pixels on the screen, and some pinkish hue to only the right side of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,3,When he saw the screen he said they should not be this bad and I got a bad panel.
B00BCGROJG,8,4,This time, I had them set up the TV on the floor and look at both screens side by side.
B00BCGROJG,8,5,Perfect screen with lighting issue gone!
B00BCGROJG,8,6,If you watch a movie with a lot of blacks, dark scenes, you will notice a significant amount of white clouding in the blacked out areas.
B00BCGROJG,8,7,Each screen had exactly one dead pixel.
B00BCGROJG,8,8,It's not the settings themselves that has the issue.
B00BCGROJG,8,9,been watching this tv for several days now.
B00BCGROJG,8,10,Once we got into watching DARK movies in a DARK room, we quickly realized that "CLOUDING" and "FLASH LIGHTING" was going to be an issue.
B00BCGROJG,8,11,Immediately noticed 2 red stuck pixels on the screen and some clouding in upper right and lower left sides of the TV.
B00BCGROJG,8,12,Very noticeable in dark scenes.
B00BCGROJG,8,13,Furthermore, room lighting must be nearly dark to notice this flaw.
B00BCGROJG,8,14,But this panel up close shows what appears to be black pressure point patches on the top left, top center, and top right corner.
B00BCGROJG,8,15,I don't see how anyone could watch a darkish movie like batman or harry potter at night and not be annoyed the whole time.
B00BCGROJG,8,16,As soon as it powered on,  the lower left corner of the TV had an estimated 100+ of black and white pixels going jagged and horizontal across the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,17,After a day, noticed fluorescent green lines at the edge of face or bright objects and more noticeable at the left half of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,18,Great TV in the day, blotchy blacks at night.
B00BCGROJG,8,19,The bottom right corner had a white streak of light like the corner of the panel was pinched by a screw or something.
B00BCGROJG,8,20,white clouding on the lower left hand if the screen, visible only when the image is perfectly black.
B00BCGROJG,8,21,The last tv panel was so bad it looked like I was watching movies through cloud cover....clouds that didn't move!!
B00BCGROJG,8,22,I tried also watching "UnderWorld" which is another movie with a lot of night scenes and the clouding is prevalent.
B00BCGROJG,8,23,This set has a terrible side viewing angle.
B00BCGROJG,8,24,It also had this bouncing white square go across the top of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,9,0,Do not buy Samsung!!
B00BCGROJG,9,1,Last Samsung purchase.
B00BCGROJG,9,2,For 58.00 more you now have a 5 year warranty.
B00BCGROJG,9,3,Buy a set for a 1000.00
B00BCGROJG,9,4,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,9,5,Dont buy Samsung - they don't last.
B00BCGROJG,9,6,Great picture/dead in 3 months.
B00BCGROJG,9,7,This will buy me some time so I can try again when the 2014's come out.
B00BCGROJG,9,8,8 months ago I purchased a 55" Samsung for my bedroom.
B00BCGROJG,9,9,My first 2 Vizio TV's are still working fine and one is over 5 years old.
B00BCGROJG,9,10,I already had a Smart TV however I purchased it a couple of years ago.
B00BCGROJG,9,11,65" Samsung replaces 55" Panasonic VT30.
B00BCGROJG,9,12,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,9,13,Samsung TV.
B00BCGROJG,9,14,I made the mistake of not starting with Samsung when the problems first stared a year ago.Random turning itself off.
B00BCGROJG,9,15,I went to best buy with the intention of buying a five hundred dollar tv and ended up buying this at eleven.
B00BCGROJG,9,16,BUYING A SAMSUNG IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
B00BCGROJG,9,17,BUYING A SAMSUNG IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
B00BCGROJG,9,18,The Samsung picture is impressive yet the problems are significant.I think I will go back to buying Vizio.
B00BCGROJG,9,19,They work ok, not great, but ok.
B00BCGROJG,9,20,I am having issues with a 14 month old Samsung that cost $3000.It is a 65" LCD LED 3 D Samsung.I am in the Costco extended warranty.
B00BCGROJG,9,21,Next time going with a Sony or LG.
B00BCGROJG,9,22,Smart Tv's have evolved over the last couple of years and this is much better than my other TV.
B00BCGROJG,9,23,I paid 2300.00 for my 7100 series Samsung LCD TV thinking I was buying quality.
B00BCGROJG,9,24,Samsung TV's have serious problems.
B00BCGROJG,10,0,Sound is OK and the TV has a few different sound settings but nothing special.
B00BCGROJG,10,1,Sound quality is good too.
B00BCGROJG,10,2,Mounts very close to the wall so the wires do not show.
B00BCGROJG,10,3,Setup is quite easy; you assemble the stand parts (2) with 4 *very tiny* screws, and then attach the stand to the TV with yet another 4 of the same screws.
B00BCGROJG,10,4,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,10,5,The sound is acceptable, but an external sound system is really necessary for sound immersion.
B00BCGROJG,10,6,The sound is good, but I'm going to get some speakers for a better audio experience.
B00BCGROJG,10,7,OTHER REVIEWS COMPLAINED ABOUT THE SOUND NOT BEING LOUD ENOUGH BUT I DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK THAT WAS A PROBLEM.
B00BCGROJG,10,8,every time when i turn on the TV, the sound bar is turned on automatically.
B00BCGROJG,10,9,Sound quality of the LG was great.
B00BCGROJG,10,10,very good TV great picture.
B00BCGROJG,10,11,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,10,12,The built in speakers S. U. C. K.!  But... what do you expect from a TV this thin?!?
B00BCGROJG,10,13,Clear picture, and great sound even without sound system.
B00BCGROJG,10,14,Before someone tells me that I shouldn't use tv speakers and should instead use a surround sound system, I get that.
B00BCGROJG,10,15,If you messed it up and the TV is not working properly, don't work hard and take it of the wall (like I did).
B00BCGROJG,10,16,Here are a few that come with this TV:This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low.
B00BCGROJG,10,17,Here are a few that come with this TV:This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low.
B00BCGROJG,10,18,This then required a separate sound connection since I don't use the TV as a source for the sound.
B00BCGROJG,10,19,I attached it to a wall mount and hooked it to the receiver without difficulty but a smaller person would have needed help.
B00BCGROJG,10,20,This was to allow for a wall installation and cut back on external units (cable box, DVD) showing in the room.
B00BCGROJG,10,21,So far, the quality control of the unit seems very good.
B00BCGROJG,10,22,Be sure to run your TV for 15 hours or so before really messing with the settings - that gives your panel time to "set in".
B00BCGROJG,10,23,The sound quality without any extra help like a Surround system attached to it , was good enough for a room; however, if you would like to experience a full home theater drill, I suggest a Surround System.
B00BCGROJG,10,24,I connected them with HDMI cables, while hooking sound system with optical cable directly to TV.
B00BCGROJG,11,0,I called Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,11,1,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,11,2,Pray that you don't have any problems with it.
B00BCGROJG,11,3,Customer service was no help.
B00BCGROJG,11,4,Having Problems.
B00BCGROJG,11,5,Called Samsung and we had service scheduled.
B00BCGROJG,11,6,Well you betcha I have problems.
B00BCGROJG,11,7,Boo Samsung, boo!
B00BCGROJG,11,8,Samsung customer service wasn't very helpful in acknowledging the problem.
B00BCGROJG,11,9,Samsung was zero help as well.
B00BCGROJG,11,10,Customer support was incompetent.
B00BCGROJG,11,11,TV great, customer service not so much.
B00BCGROJG,11,12,They will not replace them under warranty and say they are normal.
B00BCGROJG,11,13,I have had the TV for a week now and am still waiting on repair.
B00BCGROJG,11,14,I called Samsung to exchange them.
B00BCGROJG,11,15,customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at 20% per year.
B00BCGROJG,11,16,I contacted Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,11,17,After more than 2 hours on the call I got them to assign the ticket to a new customer service center.
B00BCGROJG,11,18,2000.00 to repair.
B00BCGROJG,11,19,I have now downgraded this TV to a "1" since a tv that costs this much should not have this issue, and Samsung knows it.
B00BCGROJG,11,20,I have had tremendous success with Samsung and Amazon's service has always been good to me.
B00BCGROJG,11,21,Dont buy Samsung - they don't last.
B00BCGROJG,11,22,Call Samsung and have them replace the panel or live with it.
B00BCGROJG,11,23,They kept on harping that there is nothing they could do until their so called agencies confirmed that there is a problem.
B00BCGROJG,11,24,Worst when I called support again to record the issue they give me a repair ticket number and a phone number to call.
B00BCGROJG,12,0,Very good Quality Tv.
B00BCGROJG,12,1,very good TV great picture.
B00BCGROJG,12,2,great!
B00BCGROJG,12,3,Good tv.
B00BCGROJG,12,4,I will look into it and I am sure that I can re-adjust a setting to fix this issue.
B00BCGROJG,12,5,There are many, many settings that affect brightness, many settings that affect color balance, etc... so even the last few settings will make a big difference to how the picture looks.
B00BCGROJG,12,6,Picture settings.
B00BCGROJG,12,7,It's not the settings themselves that has the issue.
B00BCGROJG,12,8,I came along at least a very good thing.
B00BCGROJG,12,9,Good things come in without a problem like this.
B00BCGROJG,12,10,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,12,11,I dialed it in while viewing a muppet movie that was on HBO....lots of colors.
B00BCGROJG,12,12,Let me know if anyone wants to compare picture settings.
B00BCGROJG,12,13,Then I went into setting and made set it to default.
B00BCGROJG,12,14,Great Picture But..... Great picture with amazing contrast and color "pop" but.....the viewing angles are not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,12,15,Problem with my set.
B00BCGROJG,12,16,The picture quality was much better though.
B00BCGROJG,12,17,I then cycled through the various settings and things changed for the better.Sound quality, while not great, was still much better than expected.
B00BCGROJG,12,18,This could be okay, if changing the settings was easy, but...- Changing settings is a PAIN IN THE ASS!!
B00BCGROJG,12,19,Its great for outdoor scenery & sports.
B00BCGROJG,12,20,Sound quality of the LG was great.
B00BCGROJG,12,21,But for the price, this set should not have the clouding issues it does.--------I
B00BCGROJG,12,22,I have seen this set hooked up at Best Buy and it was very good so I am thinking it was just this set.
B00BCGROJG,12,23,The blu-ray movie I watched was Despicable me, if you have watched this movie before you would know the cute little minions.
B00BCGROJG,12,24,The picture out of the box with factory settings was terrible.
B00BCGROJG,13,0,Last Samsung I will ever buy.
B00BCGROJG,13,1,Samsung TV purchased.
B00BCGROJG,13,2,I have a few Samsung products including this TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,3,*****W A R N I N G*****Do not buy SAMSUNG Televisions!!!
B00BCGROJG,13,4,I almost did not buy this TV after reading some of the 5-star reviews!
B00BCGROJG,13,5,Boo Samsung, boo!
B00BCGROJG,13,6,I will look into it and I am sure that I can re-adjust a setting to fix this issue.
B00BCGROJG,13,7,If I have any problems I will update this review.
B00BCGROJG,13,8,Samsung also needs to get it's quality control better.
B00BCGROJG,13,9,Samsung phone/tablet division needs to take over it's TV division's software quality control.Don't buy this TV for it's smarts ... it really is NOT smart & very sluggish (slow) if you to do anything of substance on the web.Potentially a great product ... but Samsung TV division needs to fix its software quality control problems.
B00BCGROJG,13,10,Good product - horrid support.
B00BCGROJG,13,11,Beware before buying.
B00BCGROJG,13,12,Samsung LED Products Suffer huge Clouding/Flashlighting Problems.
B00BCGROJG,13,13,Samsung LED Products Suffer huge Clouding/Flashlighting Problems.
B00BCGROJG,13,14,I purchased a large and expensive Samsung LED TV from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,13,15,I researched this TV by looking at all the online reviews for the model ES7100, ES8000 & F8000 Samsung models.
B00BCGROJG,13,16,Review for Samsung UN75F7100  75" LED TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,17,Props to Samsung and their quality control.
B00BCGROJG,13,18,Definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a new TV
B00BCGROJG,13,19,Even I set up the TV, and I definitely am not savvy with technology.
B00BCGROJG,13,20,It's not the settings themselves that has the issue.
B00BCGROJG,13,21,This if forgivable as you DO NOT WANT TO USE THEIR SMART TV anyway if you can.
B00BCGROJG,13,22,Perhaps many of these buyers never had a quality TV before.
B00BCGROJG,13,23,I will update the review after it gets completed.
B00BCGROJG,13,24,Others are a Galaxy tablet and an all in one computer.I gave two stars based only the product itself.One would think or hope, that Samsung's so-called support personnel were trained in their products.
B00BCGROJG,14,0,bottom-line is this smart TV just like a Not-Smart-TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,1,wireless is not work.
B00BCGROJG,14,2,The same problem was found on the Amazon App in the Smart Hub but not as bad.
B00BCGROJG,14,3,This if forgivable as you DO NOT WANT TO USE THEIR SMART TV anyway if you can.
B00BCGROJG,14,4,The is a smart TV. 5 star for the TV part. 1 start for "smart" part.
B00BCGROJG,14,5,Not too smart.
B00BCGROJG,14,6,i couldn't use the Wi-fi to watch the internet TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,7,Getting back to the Smart Hub.
B00BCGROJG,14,8,I also found that every app in the Smart Hub was very fast and did not cause me to become impatient.
B00BCGROJG,14,9,Apps can't be reorganized.
B00BCGROJG,14,10,I think that if I don't want an app, I should be able to de-install it.
B00BCGROJG,14,11,this TV wireless connection is very bad.
B00BCGROJG,14,12,Great Picture, Poor Smarts.
B00BCGROJG,14,13,THE BROWSER WORKS FINE BUT I DON'T USE IT...
B00BCGROJG,14,14,I'm having a slight issue with Netflix and Amazon, during the Streaming Process.
B00BCGROJG,14,15,So my guess is anyone that says their Samsung Smart Hub is slow could be having connect issues?TL-Link  TL-SG1008D Switch  purchased here in Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,14,16,very slow and
B00BCGROJG,14,17,Connected without a problem.
B00BCGROJG,14,18,Since I have to get an Apple TV, why i need a Smart TV?
B00BCGROJG,14,19,I connected this to my internet router and so am also able to stream any of the HUGE Amazon Prime movies that are available.
B00BCGROJG,14,20,Netflix is very fast and Amazon Instant Video is slightly slower but it but not enough to say it's a slug.
B00BCGROJG,14,21,I connected this to my internet router and so am also able to stream any of the HUGE Amazon Prime movies that are available.
B00BCGROJG,14,22,Samsung phone/tablet division needs to take over it's TV division's software quality control.Don't buy this TV for it's smarts ... it really is NOT smart & very sluggish (slow) if you to do anything of substance on the web.Potentially a great product ... but Samsung TV division needs to fix its software quality control problems.
B00BCGROJG,14,23,Nifty.My part of the TV set-up took 15 minutes - including times for a 6 minute software update and establishing my wifi connection.
B00BCGROJG,14,24,Also, in the last 6 months this TV as twice wiped out all "my apps" and "pairing" to Netflix and Amazon Prime.
B00BCGROJG,15,0,I didn't see any.I will say that the remote takes some getting used to.
B00BCGROJG,15,1,would anyone need 4 HDMI inputs?
B00BCGROJG,15,2,The remote, however, is dysfunctional.
B00BCGROJG,15,3,All HDMI ports don't work.
B00BCGROJG,15,4,It cannot be used to select a channel from the guide--I have to use my cable box remote to select channels.
B00BCGROJG,15,5,If there is one thing that I dislike, it is the remote control.
B00BCGROJG,15,6,Only issue is the remote contrôl.
B00BCGROJG,15,7,Plugged in power and HDMI and it worked.
B00BCGROJG,15,8,I like and use the tv remote sometimes paired with the cable remote but my wife is strictly a cable remote user.
B00BCGROJG,15,9,You will need to use a universal remote (making sure you disable the powering on from the remote as the TV will do this on it's own) or the receiver remote to change the receiver input back to the correct device.
B00BCGROJG,15,10,Intuitive.The remote with a touch pad works okay.
B00BCGROJG,15,11,It would be nice, though, to have these buttons on the remote.-
B00BCGROJG,15,12,The only thing that I do not like its the mute button on the remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,13,The remote takes getting use to, but I am learning.
B00BCGROJG,15,14,It is the dumbest remote ever.
B00BCGROJG,15,15,I would rather have a full feature remote with buttons.
B00BCGROJG,15,16,Connected without a problem.
B00BCGROJG,15,17,I can't plug my Direct TV HDMI cable to the Samsung ARC input and maybe someone on here will be able to steer me to the right direction.
B00BCGROJG,15,18,Could Samsung simplify the remote by not using the swype pad?
B00BCGROJG,15,19,Do not like the remote that came with TV so bought another one with actual buttons from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,15,20,I hate the remote control.
B00BCGROJG,15,21,That said, if you hold the channel button down it will move through a hundred channels within seconds.
B00BCGROJG,15,22,Smart Touch remote - ok but a little limited as you may still need to use a second remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,23,The only disappointment is my inability to program the remote to control the other components.
B00BCGROJG,15,24,The track-pad input works but is more of a hinderance than a help.
B00AOA9BL0,0,0,Great.
B00AOA9BL0,0,1,Watching on  such a small screen does.
B00AOA9BL0,0,2,good.

B00AOA9BL0,0,14,I love watching TV while I am using the treadmill but we have no TV in the exercise room.
B00AOA9BL0,0,15,Still has room for improvement.
B00AOA9BL0,0,16,Works great!
B00AOA9BL0,0,17,I do wish you could attach to a tv to watch on bigger screen.
B00AOA9BL0,0,18,That Said...this is a great app.
B00AOA9BL0,0,19,Good but one big flaw.
B00AOA9BL0,0,20,Being able to watch some shows live being away from home is great also.
B00AOA9BL0,0,21,I've watched around 5 movies so far.

B00AOA9BL0,1,10,Awesome!!!

B00AOA9BL0,1,12,Everything was fine love what I pick love it love it love it and the kids are happy thanks you
B00AOA9BL0,1,13,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,1,14,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,1,15,I love watching TV while I am using the treadmill but we have no TV in the exercise room.
B00AOA9BL0,1,16,When I first got it it was awesome an worked great.

B00AOA9BL0,1,18,It's good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,1,19,A Good Player.
B00AOA9BL0,1,20,good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,1,21,So it works great about 90% of the time, and I really like it.
B00AOA9BL0,1,22,Works great most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,1,23,Like others have said...Good but not great!
B00AOA9BL0,1,24,Love love love this app.
B00AOA9BL0,2,0,Otherwise, there is no sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,1,The picture and sound were both great.
B00AOA9BL0,2,2,Not hard when there are no other sounds around though.
B00AOA9BL0,2,3,Great so.
B00AOA9BL0,2,4,Great quality.
B00AOA9BL0,2,5,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,6,Its good, not great.
B00AOA9BL0,2,7,sound is better.
B00AOA9BL0,2,8,great but.
B00AOA9BL0,2,9,Great except.

B00AOA9BL0,2,13,Picture is great  but I cannot hear the audio  very dissappointed .
B00AOA9BL0,2,14,Picture quality is good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,15,And I have good hearing.
B00AOA9BL0,2,16,The last one I had was very low and I never went on it much because of the sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,17,If they could fix the sound, I'd give it 5 stars.
B00AOA9BL0,2,18,Sound issue.
B00AOA9BL0,2,19,Good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,20,Good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,2,21,Overall good value.

B00AOA9BL0,3,0,never worked.
B00AOA9BL0,3,1,Tried this 3 or 4 time over 2 days.
B00AOA9BL0,3,2,Worked great for about a week.
B00AOA9BL0,3,3,Good day, Sir.
B00AOA9BL0,3,4,There's nowhere on Amazon to go to get help.
B00AOA9BL0,3,5,who knows why either, as Amazon.
B00AOA9BL0,3,6,When it works it is good.
B00AOA9BL0,3,7,So far it's really great.
B00AOA9BL0,3,8,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,3,9,how come it doesn't work on.the
B00AOA9BL0,3,10,That's one less homework assignment when you arrive home.
B00AOA9BL0,3,11,Its good, not great.
B00AOA9BL0,3,12,It does not work with all the boxes in the house.
B00AOA9BL0,3,13,Who do I call ?
B00AOA9BL0,3,14,It works great.
B00AOA9BL0,3,15,Good. no problems yet.
B00AOA9BL0,3,16,Yep, days.
B00AOA9BL0,3,17,serviceable.
B00AOA9BL0,3,18,Was aggravated when it didn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,3,19,Didn't know what this was and ordered it.
B00AOA9BL0,3,20,Terrible customer service
B00AOA9BL0,3,21,I love it because I can watch my shows the day after if I miss then... with on-demand I have to wait a week.
B00AOA9BL0,3,22,Though I am satisfied with my services, the customer service would rate at best a D-, and cost for those services about the same.
B00AOA9BL0,3,23,Works perfectly with excellent picture.
B00AOA9BL0,3,24,Maybe one day it will.

B00AOA9BL0,5,8,I rated it why do I need to write a review?
B00AOA9BL0,5,9,good, but long way from great.

B00AOA9BL0,5,11,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.

B00AOA9BL0,5,23,I would recommend it.
B00AOA9BL0,5,24,not recommend it to anyone
B00AOA9BL0,6,0,I like this app!
B00AOA9BL0,6,1,Otherwise, the app is okay.
B00AOA9BL0,6,2,What has happened to this app?
B00AOA9BL0,6,3,Ok. Ok app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,4,Cannot use app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,5,I like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,6,Must have app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,7,I would like to see these incorporated into this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,8,The potential for this app is there.
B00AOA9BL0,6,9,I really like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,10,Using this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,11,gGood app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,12,I like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,13,NEEDS AN UPDATE/NEW APP.
B00AOA9BL0,6,14,NOT A GO APP.
B00AOA9BL0,6,15,This app will not work on my reg.

B00AOA9BL0,6,22,great app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,23,great app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,24,great app.
B00AOA9BL0,7,0,No HDMI out...boo!
B00AOA9BL0,7,1,If I wanted to watch it at home I would use the cable box.
B00AOA9BL0,7,2,Netflix has HDMI out.
B00AOA9BL0,7,3,The quality it'snot hd and mightnot translate well if you connect it to your tv but it did fine on the device.
B00AOA9BL0,7,4,Best to have a good internet connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,5,That is really nice when you do not have a WiFi connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,6,A Good Player.
B00AOA9BL0,7,7,Otherwise, it's a very good player.
B00AOA9BL0,7,8,It only lets you play it on your moble device not from your device to an HD TV .
B00AOA9BL0,7,9,Goes to 5 stars with the HDMI out working.
B00AOA9BL0,7,10,works great.
B00AOA9BL0,7,11,Good.
B00AOA9BL0,7,12,The movies are great.
B00AOA9BL0,7,13,Help, I just bought a new hdtv to connect to my fire hd via hdmi cable, and no shows will play whether connected to the tv or not.
B00AOA9BL0,7,14,Cable went out during a recent ice storm.
B00AOA9BL0,7,15,Also tried them at Starbucks, didn't really work there.
B00AOA9BL0,7,16,You can have TV anywhere you have a connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,17,As if the price of cable wasn't enough.
B00AOA9BL0,7,18,Doesn't always want  to work though.
B00AOA9BL0,7,19,You can watch tv and movies which isn't at all what I wanted.
B00AOA9BL0,7,20,Right now, the only option is to show (or not show) adult movies.
B00AOA9BL0,7,21,It works for what I need it for.
B00AOA9BL0,7,22,Does not allow HDMI output.
B00AOA9BL0,7,23,I was able to watch ONE video and the same thing happened again.
B00AOA9BL0,7,24,It is ok if you have a very strong WI-FI signal.
B00AOA9BL0,8,0,There is a green bar at the top of your screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,1,Gotta get these problems fixed or no one will want it!!
B00AOA9BL0,8,2,First show there were a few times it stopped and then started.
B00AOA9BL0,8,3,I just watched half of an hour long show, and got to see the same ad about 30 times.
B00AOA9BL0,8,4,Really wanted this to work- tried to watch Hollywood Game Night.
B00AOA9BL0,8,5,When you close out and start back up it should bring you to a home screen instead of where you left off..
B00AOA9BL0,8,6,Only works part time.
B00AOA9BL0,8,7,TOO MANY IMAGES OPEN.
B00AOA9BL0,8,8,Have to keep moving slide bar on time left in program.
B00AOA9BL0,8,9,Sometimes it continues playing sound but has a blank screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,10,Out of the 20+ times I've tried this, maybe 3 or 4 times I was actually able to watch something.
B00AOA9BL0,8,11,I have to keep my finger on the screen and use my other hand to immediately tap the nav button I want when I lift my &#34;first&#34; hand.The steady and high quality video makes up for it, mostly!
B00AOA9BL0,8,12,Watching on  such a small screen does.
B00AOA9BL0,8,13,I watched the Dark Shadow movie the other day and it was good.
B00AOA9BL0,8,14,Often the video will stop out of the blue and take you back to the episode detail screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,15,When your show is playing tap the right side of the screen and the volume slider comes up.
B00AOA9BL0,8,16,Started off great, but as weeks went by, there was less & I was able to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,8,17,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,8,18,I great an hour lunch break and I can watch one complete show.
B00AOA9BL0,8,19,I watched a couple of shows with no problems.
B00AOA9BL0,8,20,I was able to watch a couple of shows without a problem.
B00AOA9BL0,8,21,Shows the bitrate on some movies right in the middle of the screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,22,There is also no "back 10 seconds" button, so a few times when i tried to jump back a bit to hear some dialog I missed, I ended up on top of another commercial break.
B00AOA9BL0,8,23,On the Xmas version of Hollywood Game Night ~ it kept starting and stopping and finally stopped completely.
B00AOA9BL0,8,24,Great concept but... Whenever I try to watch something, the program I'm watching will freeze about halfway through the program when it is coming back from a commercial break, and nothing I do to try to get it to let me watch the rest of my program works.
B00AOA9BL0,9,0,This has never worked in the 5 months I have it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,1,Had It 5 Months- Never Worked.
B00AOA9BL0,9,2,I've had this for a few months now and it has never worked once.
B00AOA9BL0,9,3,Buy a nook
B00AOA9BL0,9,4,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,9,5,Did not work with my TV.
B00AOA9BL0,9,6,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,9,7,When it works, I love it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,8,And consider all problems.
B00AOA9BL0,9,9,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,9,10,great when it works, frustrating when it doesn't.
B00AOA9BL0,9,11,I really enjoyed it until a few weeks ago.
B00AOA9BL0,9,12,Other than that I am happy.
B00AOA9BL0,9,13,Works - Most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,14,So it works great about 90% of the time, and I really like it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,15,Works great most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,16,I guess my big TV is too old for this product!
B00AOA9BL0,9,17,For the amount I pay, I expected better service.
B00AOA9BL0,9,18,happy so far!
B00AOA9BL0,9,19,Must need to purchase something from Amazon to enjoy yet another free app.
B00AOA9BL0,9,20,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,9,21,When it works, it works fine.
B00AOA9BL0,9,22,it has tried and failed several times times.
B00AOA9BL0,9,23,I was able to watch a couple of shows without a problem.
B00AOA9BL0,9,24,Worked great for about a week.
B00AOA9BL0,10,0,volume.
B00AOA9BL0,10,1,Volume.
B00AOA9BL0,10,2,various channels have different volume settings and is difficult toadjust sound properly.
B00AOA9BL0,10,3,The volume used to be an issue.
B00AOA9BL0,10,4,The only way to adjust is with the headset volume control.
B00AOA9BL0,10,5,It's always low even though my volume is all the way up.
B00AOA9BL0,10,6,With out headphones it is quite hard to hear.That's the only bad thing.
B00AOA9BL0,10,7,The sound being extremely low has been my only complaint until recently.
B00AOA9BL0,10,8,Can't get volume.
B00AOA9BL0,10,9,The only thing I do not like about this app is there is no volume control.
B00AOA9BL0,10,10,volume too low and needs quick rewind button.
B00AOA9BL0,10,11,Good picture, bad sound, no choices.
B00AOA9BL0,10,12,It's not so bad that the audio & video are out of sync, but almost.
B00AOA9BL0,10,13,This app has no volume control and the audio track volume is so low I can't hear it clearly even with headphones!
B00AOA9BL0,10,14,Needs a volume control on the app itself.
B00AOA9BL0,10,15,For those having problems with the volume being to low I found that if you go to settings in the app, then playback options, then click on volume control you can make it pretty loud.
B00AOA9BL0,10,16,Would be great if it worked.
B00AOA9BL0,10,17,Volume controls are set to low, hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,10,18,Volume is toolow even on highest setting.
B00AOA9BL0,10,19,I found this app very good, but definitely needs build in volume control.
B00AOA9BL0,10,20,When your show is playing tap the right side of the screen and the volume slider comes up.
B00AOA9BL0,10,21,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,10,22,good app.
B00AOA9BL0,10,23,As mentioned by others the volume is very low even with head phones and using external speakers only makes it slightly more of normal  volume level but not really loud so if your hard of hearing or are you are multitasking you may not really hear much.
B00AOA9BL0,10,24,adequate with some issues.
B00AOA9BL0,11,0,I think that's what they called it?
B00AOA9BL0,11,1,Horrible horrible customer service and company.
B00AOA9BL0,11,2,And on the many  phone calls to comcast for tech support, this was never mentioned!
B00AOA9BL0,11,3,Did not work with my TV.
B00AOA9BL0,11,4,Fix or I will get a different cable service all together.
B00AOA9BL0,11,5,Called amazon, Comcast, no help.
B00AOA9BL0,11,6,Now 7 techs later and no one can fix it.
B00AOA9BL0,11,7,Installed three weeks ago, repair men have come to "fix" the problems only to have something else pop up or the repair that was made didn't quite fix it.
B00AOA9BL0,11,8,worked great at first.
B00AOA9BL0,11,9,It didn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,11,10,YOU GUYS NEED TO WORK ON IT.
B00AOA9BL0,11,11,Hopefully I will be able to find the time to decipher what all it does.
B00AOA9BL0,11,12,Would be great if it worked.
B00AOA9BL0,11,13,It tok a day and a few phone calls, but I finally got the app working.
B00AOA9BL0,11,14,Boo to not supporting your existing customer base.
B00AOA9BL0,11,15,I pay $150.00  a month and I should get this option!! Thanks comcast for stopping everything in the world that customers pay for!!!!!!
B00AOA9BL0,11,16,I have the paid service, yet it work intermittly.
B00AOA9BL0,11,17,I even have emailed about this and was told to call and get help that way.
B00AOA9BL0,11,18,I am doing something wrong and you know how to correct it, Please contact me.
B00AOA9BL0,11,19,Waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,20,Dont waste your storage...or your time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,21,I am getting close to changing to another paid service.
B00AOA9BL0,11,22,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,11,23,it has tried and failed several times times.
B00AOA9BL0,11,24,I have a tech come out every other month for 4 years and my garbage signal has yet to be fixed.
B00AOA9BL0,12,0,Screen looks good but stops.
B00AOA9BL0,12,1,not to good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,2,Quality is good and there are a ton of shows to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,12,3,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,12,4,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,12,5,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,12,6,VERY BAD.
B00AOA9BL0,12,7,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,8,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,12,9,It gets very annoying when one is trying to watch a good movie or show.
B00AOA9BL0,12,10,Good appNeeds more movies for basic people with basic cable not many live shows available either other than that it's good food HD videos fast streaming
B00AOA9BL0,12,11,Any time I can take CNN to the bathroom is a good thing.
B00AOA9BL0,12,12,One thing that brothers me, is some of the really good movies are taken off too soon.
B00AOA9BL0,12,13,Been having a lot of issues with tv shows an  movies not playing.
B00AOA9BL0,12,14,No matter what you do to try to lock it into a set orientation, it just switches back and forth with your movement.
B00AOA9BL0,12,15,I watched the Dark Shadow movie the other day and it was good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,16,Good for tv shows if you have cable, terrible for movies if you only have streampix.
B00AOA9BL0,12,17,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,12,18,It allows me to watch anywhere with great quality of video.
B00AOA9BL0,12,19,This app is good for watching older shows but I'd like to be able to watch live tv especially sporting events.
B00AOA9BL0,12,20,Out of the 20+ times I've tried this, maybe 3 or 4 times I was actually able to watch something.
B00AOA9BL0,12,21,All the shows I want to watch are available but don't always play even when i can get them to play on the computer.
B00AOA9BL0,12,22,Will change review when I do
B00AOA9BL0,12,23,Watching movies is great!
B00AOA9BL0,12,24,I thought this would be good.
B00AOA9BL0,13,0,Twp Star Review.
B00AOA9BL0,13,1,Hate this product.
B00AOA9BL0,13,2,Won't work with Google tv so very disappointed.
B00AOA9BL0,13,3,Will change review when I do
B00AOA9BL0,13,4,no google tv so disappointed.
B00AOA9BL0,13,5,Make it the same quality as on my phone an I will give it 5 stars no problem.
B00AOA9BL0,13,6,Disappointed and aggrivated now.
B00AOA9BL0,13,7,I am sure it has something to do with ComCast not putting enough effort/bandwidth into this product...
B00AOA9BL0,13,8,There are no updates that would work.
B00AOA9BL0,13,9,I thought this would be good.
B00AOA9BL0,13,10,Too bad.
B00AOA9BL0,13,11,Gave it a one star because it did not work, don't like the word hate.
B00AOA9BL0,13,12,Hope will get better.
B00AOA9BL0,13,13,Be careful and get it in writing.
B00AOA9BL0,13,14,waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,13,15,You should be able to at least buy the upgrade or get a trade in and not have to buy a whole new device to be up to date.
B00AOA9BL0,13,16,That was disappointing, if only because Comcast advertises about their "amazing" comment to cust svs all the darn time.
B00AOA9BL0,13,17,I have Comcast for TV now but I could not get it set up for some reason.
B00AOA9BL0,13,18,Now IMHO the way the Featured page is set up makes it almost useless.
B00AOA9BL0,13,19,Disappointed.
B00AOA9BL0,13,20,I believe this to be unfair and scam to buyers.
B00AOA9BL0,13,21,BEWARE.
B00AOA9BL0,13,22,Waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,13,23,Dont waste your storage...or your time.
B00AOA9BL0,13,24,Good value, especially if you like binge-watching tv shows.
B00AOA9BL0,14,0,It works, BUT...
B00AOA9BL0,14,1,it actualy works.
B00AOA9BL0,14,2,Does not work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,3,dont work to well.
B00AOA9BL0,14,4,Okay--when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,14,5,Work on it
B00AOA9BL0,14,6,not working.
B00AOA9BL0,14,7,hasn't worked and still trying.
B00AOA9BL0,14,8,This new updated app doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,9,Works - Most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,10,I didn't have any problems with the old app.
B00AOA9BL0,14,11,Did not work for me or many others.
B00AOA9BL0,14,12,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,13,The app itself works just fine.
B00AOA9BL0,14,14,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,15,Good app... when it works!
B00AOA9BL0,14,16,It seems to be working now.
B00AOA9BL0,14,17,It didn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,18,Then it said it needed an update.
B00AOA9BL0,14,19,The app is great when it works, I am connected online yet it tells me to connect.
B00AOA9BL0,14,20,Never have this problem with Netflix app on the same device with the same Wi-Fi connection.
B00AOA9BL0,14,21,I have this app on all my devices and it stops playing after about 30 every time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,22,There are no updates that would work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,23,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,24,Great when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,15,0,Works Okay.
B00AOA9BL0,15,1,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,15,2,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,15,3,Cool app but if you try to connect to your tv via the cable it stops all video and asks you disconnect cable.
B00AOA9BL0,15,4,I have no problem connecting other devices to my Wi-Fi.
B00AOA9BL0,15,5,The kicker is that once it starts this, it keeps doing it until you power off the device, wait 10 seconds or so, and then power it back on.
B00AOA9BL0,15,6,Is it me or has anyone else had this problem.
B00AOA9BL0,15,7,Works well with Comcast although one has to be careful when scrolling thru the channel guide or you will be accidentally changing channels.Great having channel guide, DVR manager, Movies and more on one screen.
B00AOA9BL0,15,8,Often times just plainly won't work, gives a blank screen that completely stops responding.
B00AOA9BL0,15,9,I don't know if it is my Comcast connection of the devise.
B00AOA9BL0,15,10,When it works, it works fine.
B00AOA9BL0,15,11,It comes in handy but when watching a show its not that easy to navigate through the menus to switch shows or to just find a new one.
