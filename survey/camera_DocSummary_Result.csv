HTSM,B00DMS0LCO,1,1,love the flip out rear touch screen lcd
HTMM,B00DMS0LCO,14,0,i find that getting used to the touch screen may take some time  again i worry a tad about the durability of a screen that can be rotated six ways from sunday
HTMM,B00DMS0LCO,14,1,i just have one big observation
HTSM,B00DMS0LCO,14,0,that is why i took one star awayi found the touch lcd and touch control screen on top of the d quite useful and adapted to them quickly
HTSM,B00DMS0LCO,14,1,it even implements iphonelike viewing of images you have taken
ASUM,B00DMS0LCO,14,0,should be better in 
ASUM,B00DMS0LCO,14,1,over priced

HTSM,B00DMS0LCO,10,0,i bought the right one
ASUM,B00DMS0LCO,10,0,ive always been a canon loyalist
ASUM,B00DMS0LCO,10,1,if you get a camera that is used i would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one

ASUM,B00DMS0LCO,12,1,so far
HTMM,B00DMS0LCO,12,1,however
HTSM,B00DMS0LCO,12,1,if you do video then this could be a good option
HTMM,B00DMS0LCO,25,0,research focus problems before you buy it
ASUM,B00DMS0LCO,25,0,did not work
ASUM,B00DMS0LCO,25,1,if you get a camera that is used i would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one
HTMM,B00DMS0LCO,25,1,im just an amature that likes shooting video and pictures
HTSM,B00DMS0LCO,25,0,coming from using nikons d and d
HTSM,B00DMS0LCO,25,1,i was discouraged until someone asked me if i was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice
