B005IHAIMA,0,0,I just like to recomand this camera, he is great and a very good price.
B005IHAIMA,0,1,have a nice day
B005IHAIMA,0,2,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,0,3,Really a good cameraI.
B005IHAIMA,0,4,The flash feeds off the main battery, which can be good and bad.
B005IHAIMA,0,5,This happens using a (spare) battery used in the NEX-5.
B005IHAIMA,0,6,I have waited to buy it for a long time.
B005IHAIMA,0,7,This should be equated into the total cost of ownership if a viewfinder is important to the consumer.The battery life seems good for now.
B005IHAIMA,0,8,few years back I had a bad taste for Sony due to their camera's being battery (AA) for most styles.
B005IHAIMA,0,9,I can't say enough good thing about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,0,10,This can be considered a pro too, as Sony did a great job with the regular controls.Pros:The battery lasts a good long time.
B005IHAIMA,0,11,This needs to be corrected!!! Also, Sony's new thing with their cameras is that they will ONLY take a Sony battery.
B005IHAIMA,0,12,A camera that is just easy to use and takes great pics.
B005IHAIMA,0,13,Finally, I got it at a good price.
B005IHAIMA,0,14,Picture shooting effect is good and easy to handle.
B005IHAIMA,0,15,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,0,16,At the end of the day, does it take amazing quality photos?
B005IHAIMA,0,17,I have read that if there is no sticker on your LCD, you should be good (apparently they failed to put them on the ones that dont have this problem).
B005IHAIMA,0,18,I purchased a 3-d party (Wasabi) battery pack (two NP-FW50 batteries, one Wasabi AC charger, one car charger converter for Wasabi AC charger, European converter) which works well with my NEX-5N.
B005IHAIMA,0,19,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,0,20,No more guessing and losing the perfect shot (happened so many times!) because 1/4 remaining battery equates to 2 percent!This is the first time that the auto modes actually work for me.
B005IHAIMA,0,21,Bought adapter for eight inch scope and took great photos of the moon.
B005IHAIMA,0,22,I do get significantly more barrel distortion from the SONY 18-55mm lens than from the Canon 17mm-85mm.BATTERYNEX-5N comes with a separate battery recharger, which is handy since the camera drains the battery rather fast it is nice to have a spare battery charging while the camera is being used.
B005IHAIMA,0,23,My Canon batteries charge from empty to full power in under 2 hours.-
B005IHAIMA,0,24,I love taking photos of the kiddies/family throughout the year.
B005IHAIMA,1,0,I don't like touch screens.
B005IHAIMA,1,1,Easy control and settings with touch screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,2,Overall the screen is quite good and I only miss it in very bright sun.-
B005IHAIMA,1,3,Very stealth with the flipout screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,4,It has a great lcd screen and the best of any of the mirrorless cameras I have tried.
B005IHAIMA,1,5,This camera is quite good.
B005IHAIMA,1,6,Also the screen is susceptible to scratches.
B005IHAIMA,1,7,Tap the screen to focus during movie (haven't tried it for photo--haven't tried it because touch screen so new to me on a camera).
B005IHAIMA,1,8,Try it and you'll see.I also like the articulated LCD on the back, and the touch screen, and the simplicity of the menus.
B005IHAIMA,1,9,The touch screen is nice that wasn't in NEX-5, and so with NEX-5N you can operate the mode dials or touch the screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,10,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,1,11,Since the screen on this camera is adjustable, can't see a need for it anyway.
B005IHAIMA,1,12,The tilting screen is a great thing, but it doesn't flip around (although it does on the NEX F3), so you can't see yourself.-
B005IHAIMA,1,13,Also, the touch screen is incredible.
B005IHAIMA,1,14,the screen cover is high quality and I would recommend to anyone with a Nex5 camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,15,I recommend getting a screen protector.
B005IHAIMA,1,16,The camera is great.
B005IHAIMA,1,17,Can be scratched easily as with all this new touch screen tech out here.
B005IHAIMA,1,18,The LCD screen on the R1 will swivel a full 360 degrees!
B005IHAIMA,1,19,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,20,only issue I have with it is a lot of features require you to go through the touch screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,21,I love it.
B005IHAIMA,1,22,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,1,23,This camera takes great photos.
B005IHAIMA,1,24,Great Fun.
B005IHAIMA,2,0,Excellent cameraWas undecided between the Canon T3i and this model but it is very good.
B005IHAIMA,2,1,Great upgrade or go-to camera.
B005IHAIMA,2,2,This was an upgrade from a Nikon P100 model.
B005IHAIMA,2,3,Replaced my DSLR Canon Rebel XS with this Sony.
B005IHAIMA,2,4,Keeps up with my Canon 7D.
B005IHAIMA,2,5,I upgraded my point and shoot to this Sony and couldn't be more pleased.
B005IHAIMA,2,6,I have owned Canon 40D, Canon 5D Mark ii, Canon T2i and so on...
B005IHAIMA,2,7,I have been a Canon and Nikon DSLR owner for a long time.
B005IHAIMA,2,8,Now that Sony has fixed it, it's a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,2,9,Fantastic Upgrade from Point & Shoot.
B005IHAIMA,2,10,It was time for me to upgrade from my Nikon D50 (a 6.1 megapixel dinosaur I came to find out).
B005IHAIMA,2,11,This system should be camera of the year.
B005IHAIMA,2,12,My Canon G12 is slow to focus.
B005IHAIMA,2,13,Upgraded the firmware to newest version, Auto focus is fast!
B005IHAIMA,2,14,Instead, I would just upgrade to the NEX 7 or another Sony NEX model that comes with the electronic viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,2,15,However, this camera shoots DSLR quality photos that are amazing in auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,2,16,Plus it does very well with symmetrical lenses compared to the other systems out there.
B005IHAIMA,2,17,the t2i was great, and if you have investment of canon lenses this isn't worth the switch, but for me it was otherwise.i
B005IHAIMA,2,18,My last camera was a Canon Rebel, and I was ready to upgrade to something smaller.
B005IHAIMA,2,19,It shoots 24p and 60p video at full 1080 resolution.
B005IHAIMA,2,20,If you shoot fast moving subjects like sports, you'll prefer a DSLR as the autofocus on the NEX just isn't as good.
B005IHAIMA,2,21,mainly got this for video, and for the size, so i will not review picture quality (its been done plenty of times).video is amazing, especially coming from a t2i, and using my gf's t4i. the best part is - true autofocus during video.
B005IHAIMA,2,22,It's an excellent viewfinder, but it's an extra outlay of cash.
B005IHAIMA,2,23,Amazing picture quality in auto mode - I gave up on my DSLR largely because I am such an amateur photographer that I could never get the settings right to take a great photo.
B005IHAIMA,2,24,With the latest firmware update, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,0,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,1,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,2,Great value.
B005IHAIMA,3,3,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,4,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,5,But it must go back, the sound is uncalled for.
B005IHAIMA,3,6,:) OH! and picture quality is pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,3,7,I don't care about the video feature, but it works well.
B005IHAIMA,3,8,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,3,9,Wish I bought the one with built in wifi.
B005IHAIMA,3,10,I just like to recomand this camera, he is great and a very good price.
B005IHAIMA,3,11,So, I cannot takes photos at weddings with this camera, I cannot take photos at sports events (Golf mainly) with this camera and cannot take photos of my grandchildren with this camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,12,A camera that is just easy to use and takes great pics.
B005IHAIMA,3,13,great portability and great image quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,14,I phoned Sony and they informed me that the shutter sound that the camera makes cannot be turned off!
B005IHAIMA,3,15,I couldn't believe the quality of pics I got.
B005IHAIMA,3,16,Without much experience, I was able to record fantastic pictures.
B005IHAIMA,3,17,Very good camera and a very good image.
B005IHAIMA,3,18,The audio quality is pretty good, but I haven't had a chance to try out the add on microphone.
B005IHAIMA,3,19,This camera puts forth such great, quality photos in auto mode that I usually do not have to do much editing to get a great picture to share.4)
B005IHAIMA,3,20,Its best feature is the HD video with exceptionally good audio quality, but if your intention is to shoot long videos DON'T, as the camera will OVERHEAT and automatically shut down after about 15 minutes of operation.
B005IHAIMA,3,21,Photos great, video sucks.
B005IHAIMA,3,22,I am not a photographer, just a picture taker who appreciates good image quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,23,I did not hear any "clicking" on the videos with this particular unit.The specs say the battery should last for 400+ shots.
B005IHAIMA,3,24,This will give most people all the image quality they will ever need and then some.
B005IHAIMA,4,0,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,1,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,4,2,great camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,3,This is a great camera!
B005IHAIMA,4,4,As he has been using a DSLR for awhile now, the unclear settings didn't set him back as much as us.
B005IHAIMA,4,5,However, this camera shoots DSLR quality photos that are amazing in auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,6,Only took 250 shots so far.
B005IHAIMA,4,7,Great transition camera from point and shoots, works as well as most DSLR!!!
B005IHAIMA,4,8,Tried out the manual modes, but mostly just used Auto because that is what I wanted.
B005IHAIMA,4,9,The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.
B005IHAIMA,4,10,After it focuses you can also manually fine-tune the focus to your object.
B005IHAIMA,4,11,I use my manual lenses on M or A modes, but have been using several of the scene modes where it will adjust shutter speed and ISO and other parameters to give you their scene shot.
B005IHAIMA,4,12,Amazing picture quality in auto mode - I gave up on my DSLR largely because I am such an amateur photographer that I could never get the settings right to take a great photo.
B005IHAIMA,4,13,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,14,I use the Auto mode basically all the time.
B005IHAIMA,4,15,For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,16,This camera puts forth such great, quality photos in auto mode that I usually do not have to do much editing to get a great picture to share.4)
B005IHAIMA,4,17,The good thing was, I hardly needed to use it even at night because it was so amazing at adjusting to the setting.
B005IHAIMA,4,18,Auto focus is near perfect in good light, and very good in low light.Macro with the kit zoom, using menu setting "Camera - AF/MF - DMF".  can give some pretty nice shots, but you will need to stay 9-10" away with this lens to focus.
B005IHAIMA,4,19,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,20,You can put the focus precisely where you want it, which is great when shooting wide-open.
B005IHAIMA,4,21,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,4,22,Instead, it takes amazing low light pictures (even in a mostly dark room) in auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,23,Low light shots are amazing so far.
B005IHAIMA,4,24,Having the two cameras set up differently means not having to fumble around trying to change menu settings btw auto and manual while on a shoot.
B005IHAIMA,5,0,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,5,1,In evening events like volleyball and soccer, I used ISO 800 and 1600 to still get fast shutter to stop the action.
B005IHAIMA,5,2,The images are superb, the start up time and shooting speed are fast!
B005IHAIMA,5,3,So, I cannot takes photos at weddings with this camera, I cannot take photos at sports events (Golf mainly) with this camera and cannot take photos of my grandchildren with this camera.
B005IHAIMA,5,4,It is great taking pictures indoor and outdoor.It looks good and has a good grip to take pictures comfortably.
B005IHAIMA,5,5,(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,5,6,;)Start-up time is very fast, and shot-to-shot time is even faster.
B005IHAIMA,5,7,I've tried adjusting shutter speed, ISO, etc and still didn't have much luck.
B005IHAIMA,5,8,The lens is light, but feels substantial.
B005IHAIMA,5,9,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,5,10,Most cameras have to use slow shutter speeds indoors in ambient light, because they just can't control noise and smear at ISO 800 and above.
B005IHAIMA,5,11,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,5,12,It has made a world of difference in my speed of shooting.
B005IHAIMA,5,13,Autofocus is fast and works well for pictures of my kids.
B005IHAIMA,5,14,Low light shots are amazing so far.
B005IHAIMA,5,15,I can comfortably take indoor shots at iso 3200.Give this camera a try and you will be amazed.
B005IHAIMA,5,16,Yes, beautiful photos, fast continuous shooting.
B005IHAIMA,5,17,:) OH! and picture quality is pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,5,18,The shutter response is nice and fast, and in burst mode can shoot a lot a photos in just a few seconds.I really like how much smaller an lighter this camera is.
B005IHAIMA,5,19,Great For the Moment Camera.
B005IHAIMA,5,20,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,5,21,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,5,22,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.
B005IHAIMA,5,23,The most important for me is that it does not have a mode that in I can shoot in RAW while having a minimum shutter of at least, say, 1/125s for shooting my kids activities.
B005IHAIMA,5,24,Great transition camera from point and shoots, works as well as most DSLR!!!
B005IHAIMA,6,0,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,6,1,I got this with my sony card and it was expensive but worth every dime.
B005IHAIMA,6,2,I can either have a viewfinder of a flash on, not both.
B005IHAIMA,6,3,Now that Sony has fixed it, it's a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,6,4,The only thing I did not like about the ordering experience is a representative called shortly after I placed my order online to try and sell an extra off-brand battery and memory card.
B005IHAIMA,6,5,Awesome Still Images and Video Quality.
B005IHAIMA,6,6,Excellent camera for the price.
B005IHAIMA,6,7,The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,8,Using this with Eye-Fi card, battery last about 160-200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,6,9,I inserted the memory card into my laptop and was able to confirm that the images turned out good.
B005IHAIMA,6,10,Overall I think it is a very nice design.The video appears to be good too.
B005IHAIMA,6,11,I don't find having the flash and viewfinder or mic (both purchased separately) being separate to be an issue.
B005IHAIMA,6,12,The following items were included along with the camera: warranty card, paper manual for the NEX-3/NEX-3C/NEX-5/NEX-5C, software disk, neck strap, usb cable, battery and charger and flash accessory with its respectable case.FIRST IMPRESSIONSI knew this camera was going to be small and compact, but when I took it out of its protective bag, it was even smaller than I anticipated.
B005IHAIMA,6,13,Also, while 55mm doesn't sound like much, with 16 megapixels and the camera's super-easy way of zooming in on the pics you have taken, it is easy to zoom in after the shot is taken and still get excellent resolution.
B005IHAIMA,6,14,We were working with the 18-55 lens and also the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,6,15,Glad i bought it.I paid $623 on EBAY and mine came with a 18/55MM Lens, flash, a small SONY tote bag, 4GB SD Card, and charger/battery.
B005IHAIMA,6,16,It's an excellent viewfinder, but it's an extra outlay of cash.
B005IHAIMA,6,17,So I take a pic, zoom in and see how I will crop it later on the computer.
B005IHAIMA,6,18,Excellent photos...
B005IHAIMA,6,19,Best Value in the space.
B005IHAIMA,6,20,The camera uses a standard memory card.Swapping out lenses is really simple, just a button release and a careful twist.
B005IHAIMA,6,21,A STEAL!!Buy it, get yourself a lens hood, some lens filters, the new holga effect lenses, or the awesome sony lenses, a 4G SD card (takes up to 800 shots all you need trust me), a carrying case for it (recommend Case Logic SLRC-205), the flash, and the viewfinder if you feel you'll need them.Cant be used with photoshop out of the box, but check the web, there are downloads to get around that type of thing.
B005IHAIMA,6,22,I showed some of my first photos with the camera to a friend and she said that the pictures just "pop."The
B005IHAIMA,6,23,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,6,24,This is a great value for the money.
B005IHAIMA,7,0,I'm using 21/4 Skopar, 28/3.5 Skopar, 35/1.7 Ultron, 50/1.5 Ultron with great results.
B005IHAIMA,7,1,I was looking for a camera which was small in size but was great in taking pictures.
B005IHAIMA,7,2,great portability and great image quality.
B005IHAIMA,7,3,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,7,4,If you wnat a small package and great quality this is it.
B005IHAIMA,7,5,great quality in small package.
B005IHAIMA,7,6,Great value.
B005IHAIMA,7,7,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,7,8,Compact camera with DSLR quality.
B005IHAIMA,7,9,I also have a Canon G11 (which I love)This is a great in between a DSLR and a POcket cam.
B005IHAIMA,7,10,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,7,11,The compact size of a point-and-shoot camera with the quality of a DSLR one.
B005IHAIMA,7,12,The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.
B005IHAIMA,7,13,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,7,14,Great camera!
B005IHAIMA,7,15,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,7,16,Both very nice.
B005IHAIMA,7,17,We bought it for our honeymoon this year and it was great!
B005IHAIMA,7,18,I have for the last 10 years just had a canon powershot that I could put in my pocket.
B005IHAIMA,7,19,I used this for well over year now, a lot, and I think it's great.
B005IHAIMA,7,20,With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.
B005IHAIMA,7,21,Best of the Compact Camera lines.
B005IHAIMA,7,22,I own the canon elph 300hs and the nikon d3100 and this by far beats both.
B005IHAIMA,7,23,Great transition camera from point and shoots, works as well as most DSLR!!!
B005IHAIMA,7,24,Olympus Zoom 70 to 150mm, all with delicious results.
B005IHAIMA,8,0,Negatif yani ise lens portfoyunun zayif olmasi.
B005IHAIMA,8,1,I'm okay with the kit lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,2,So far I only have the 16mm and the kit 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,3,By the way, the 18-55 len is a little heavy.
B005IHAIMA,8,4,For a kit lens, I am impressed.
B005IHAIMA,8,5,If you buy one, get the kit with the 18-55 lens which represents the best value.
B005IHAIMA,8,6,It's a very solid camera with very good picture quality and the kit lens is quite nice as well.
B005IHAIMA,8,7,After dragging an 18MP dSLR with 18-200 lens to Disneyland and taking only 200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,8,8,(Other than more lenses)
B005IHAIMA,8,9,Not exactly portable/pocket with the kit lens attached--you may have to get the 16mm pancake lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,10,We were working with the 18-55 lens and also the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,8,11,With the 55-210 mm telephoto zoom lens (or any of the other large superzooms for the E-mount like the Sony Alpha SEL18200 E-mount 18-200mm F3.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,8,12,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,8,13,Try finding an 18mm lens for a dSLR, it'll cost as much as the body itself.
B005IHAIMA,8,14,A great Prime Lens for the Nex e-mount Sony 50mm f/1.8 Mid-Range Lens for Sony E Mount Nex Cameras4.
B005IHAIMA,8,15,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,8,16,The body alone is quite svelte, but the kit 18-55 mm lens adds a lot to its perceived size and weight.
B005IHAIMA,8,17,the kit lens is fine but of course i will be getting better lenses and the fact they have an adapter which will fit almost any lens made is fantastic.
B005IHAIMA,8,18,I currently have the 18-55 mm, kit lens, 16mm pancake, canon fd 50mm f/1.4,
B005IHAIMA,8,19,Lens for Sony NEX Cameras.
B005IHAIMA,8,20,The kit lens is surprisingly awesome.
B005IHAIMA,8,21,Lens are somewhat limited at this point, but with lenses adapters the possibilities are endless.
B005IHAIMA,8,22,So I bought the NEX-5N with the 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,23,I purchased the Nex 5N with the 18-55mm kit lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,24,The photos are so sharp with the kit lens than expected.
B005IHAIMA,9,0,It's very strongest plus is the high ISO image quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,1,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,9,2,Even video taken in low light can look good.
B005IHAIMA,9,3,Great image quality but try before you buy.
B005IHAIMA,9,4,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,9,5,very good camera.
B005IHAIMA,9,6,Low noise at high iso as well.
B005IHAIMA,9,7,It was known for its great lens and sensor, but had no image stabilization.
B005IHAIMA,9,8,I always wanted a camera that could take DSLR quality images without the size.
B005IHAIMA,9,9,Picture quality is excellent especially low light pics.
B005IHAIMA,9,10,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,9,11,The camera produces really high quality pictures!
B005IHAIMA,9,12,The high ISO quality and resolution at most ISO's really amazes me.
B005IHAIMA,9,13,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,9,14,The camera has great ISO performance and very good color replication.
B005IHAIMA,9,15,Low light shots are amazing so far.
B005IHAIMA,9,16,It's small and light.
B005IHAIMA,9,17,Excellent sharpness, color saturation and low light performance.
B005IHAIMA,9,18,Awesome Still Images and Video Quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,19,The image quality of this new sensor put in the 5N is extraordinary.

B005IHAIMA,10,23,I love this camera.
B005IHAIMA,10,24,I cannot begin to say enough good thing about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,0,I found this camera very easy to use.
B005IHAIMA,11,1,It's lightweight, easy to use and I get great photos with it.
B005IHAIMA,11,2,Great pictures from a compact camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,3,This camera takes great photos.
B005IHAIMA,11,4,I am not a professional photographer, but this camera is great, the look, easy access, weight and functions...I just love it
B005IHAIMA,11,5,I have been asked a several times if I am a professional photographer (No! It's just a great camera!).
B005IHAIMA,11,6,A camera that is just easy to use and takes great pics.
B005IHAIMA,11,7,Picture shooting effect is good and easy to handle.
B005IHAIMA,11,8,The quality is good.

B005IHAIMA,11,13,Great for point and shoot or more advanced photographers.
B005IHAIMA,11,14,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,11,15,Great Fun.
B005IHAIMA,11,16,Compact camera with DSLR quality.
B005IHAIMA,11,17,As he has been using a DSLR for awhile now, the unclear settings didn't set him back as much as us.
B005IHAIMA,11,18,Really a good cameraI.
B005IHAIMA,11,19,Amazing picture quality in auto mode - I gave up on my DSLR largely because I am such an amateur photographer that I could never get the settings right to take a great photo.
B005IHAIMA,11,20,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,21,I am most certainly a novice photographer and this camera is a great stepping stone for me.So far I am liking the photo quality I have seen come out of it.
B005IHAIMA,11,22,The size of the camera, its feather weight and easy controls including an excellent LCD screen make this a fun to use camera and easy to carry everywhere.
B005IHAIMA,11,23,Love it!!!! Love it love it!!!!
B005IHAIMA,11,24,All I can say is that if you are pondering whether this can really take great pics, then read the pro reviews.
B005IHAIMA,12,0,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,1,What surprised me was the quality of HD video.
B005IHAIMA,12,2,I couldn't have taken it with the R1.And the video.
B005IHAIMA,12,3,Takes great pics.
B005IHAIMA,12,4,A great camera for photographing, but not for video recording.
B005IHAIMA,12,5,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,12,6,Have used it for a while and this really makes a difference when you are using a Sony High End Camera with Accessaries from Sony
B005IHAIMA,12,7,will Sony do?
B005IHAIMA,12,8,I've been reading the reviews so one of the first things I tried was the video!
B005IHAIMA,12,9,Amazing camera at an amazing price - review for Video.
B005IHAIMA,12,10,Takes outstanding pictures and video.
B005IHAIMA,12,11,This camera takes great photos.
B005IHAIMA,12,12,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,12,13,Check out video quality of "hungry seagulls" on U-tube.
B005IHAIMA,12,14,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,12,15,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,16,Awesome Still Images and Video Quality.
B005IHAIMA,12,17,Sony does it all.
B005IHAIMA,12,18,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,12,19,The best value and quality for $650.
B005IHAIMA,12,20,Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012.
B005IHAIMA,12,21,the video quality is really superb.
B005IHAIMA,12,22,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,12,23,In Sept. 2011, Sony has release an official statement that Sony will provide some video recording improvement for those affected NEX5Ns.(What
B005IHAIMA,12,24,The video recording is excellent and clear.
B005IHAIMA,13,0,My Canon batteries charge from empty to full power in under 2 hours.-
B005IHAIMA,13,1,Using this with Eye-Fi card, battery last about 160-200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,13,2,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,13,3,Wasabi batteries  that I ordered are working too.
B005IHAIMA,13,4,I figured the battery was dead, so I threw it on the charger.
B005IHAIMA,13,5,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.
B005IHAIMA,13,6,Battery lasts for a while.
B005IHAIMA,13,7,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,13,8,Possibly small ones.Battery life is pretty weak.
B005IHAIMA,13,9,Not exactly efficient, but at least the menus are not hard to navigate or use.The Bad:Battery life - Perhaps I am spoiled, but when I go out for a whole day of shooting pictures and video, I expect the battery to last the whole day.
B005IHAIMA,13,10,I did not have time to confirm this.FIRST USEOnce the battery was fully charged, I reinstalled it into the camera and attached the 50mm E-Mount lens (SEL50F18).
B005IHAIMA,13,11,But you probably already know that so I thought I'd mention a few of the cons... none of which would make me downgrade my rating, but could be important to you.CONS (The pros would take too long to write):- The battery takes FOREVER to charge, it took an hour on a new and empty batter just to get enough charge to format my SD card, overnight for a full charge.
B005IHAIMA,13,12,I must have mistaken this feature from some other camera I was researching.At this time, the only real negative I can find is the battery door.
B005IHAIMA,13,13,The screen turns blue and flashes 'camera error'.
B005IHAIMA,13,14,A series of Sony Viao laptops drained their batteries even when the computer was off because there was a design failure and the battery circuit could not be closed.
B005IHAIMA,13,15,It is still going strong and we use it all the time without fail it takes the nicest photos with the least amount of out of focus shots I have ever had.
B005IHAIMA,13,16,Charging took about 4 hours (which is normal) and then the camera fired right up.You will be prompted to set the date & time right away and then you can start enjoying your new toy.When you turn the camera off, the shutter may operate.
B005IHAIMA,13,17,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,13,18,The battery door on the other cameras I've owned never had any sort of movement when closed.INITIAL START UPI slipped the battery and a 16GB SanDisk Extreme memory card into the camera (SDSDX-016G-X46).
B005IHAIMA,13,19,This is REALLY disappointing and as much as I wanted to buy this camera, I will not and do not recommend to do so.
B005IHAIMA,13,20,The camera has inconsistent problem of getting locked up when shooting.
B005IHAIMA,13,21,Luckily, I bought an extra battery as back up and that solves it.
B005IHAIMA,13,22,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.
B005IHAIMA,13,23,Some people have reported that the battery life will drop by 15-20% after this analysis due to the processing of the pixel mapping procedure.
B005IHAIMA,13,24,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,14,0,I don't like touch screens.
B005IHAIMA,14,1,My only problem is that I have polarized sunglasses, and when I wear them, I can't see the image on the display screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,2,You can customize 3 of the buttons on the back of the camera, and that helps tremendously, but there are still several things I wish were more readily available without fumbling through the menu.There is no viewfinder so you must frame your photos using the LCD screen, which can be difficult in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,14,3,the screen is very clear and bright.
B005IHAIMA,14,4,;-)* The screen is very hard to use in direct sunlight.
B005IHAIMA,14,5,I like that you can adjust the screen for above/below views.
B005IHAIMA,14,6,The first way is handheld, and using its rear LCD screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,7,The camera does even have a single scratch on the body or the screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,8,With the screen articulated to face up, taking photos is quick and easy.
B005IHAIMA,14,9,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,14,10,you can resolve this issue by removing the sticker behind the LCD screen and extending out the LCD screen so the camera can cool faster but that will void your warranty.
B005IHAIMA,14,11,Also, the touch screen is incredible.
B005IHAIMA,14,12,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,14,13,The finder is very big and you can change the angle of finder display which allow users to shoot in various ways.
B005IHAIMA,14,14,If someone is considering both of these cameras let me start with the differences between the two cameras that made me choose NEX-5N.My main issue with C3 was seeing the LCD screen in the sun.
B005IHAIMA,14,15,There are always stubborn streaks on the screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,16,I lately tested the Lumix LX7 and this point is more apparent than with the sony(very bright saturated on camera's screen and much less on the computer's screen.4.
B005IHAIMA,14,17,This is an eminently much more stable shooting position than a regular non-articulating LCD screen that requires the user to stretch out his arms, an inherently unstable shooting stance.Finally, using a tripod, the articulating rear LCD screen makes it easy to aim the camera with no need to activate live view button or switch or periodically pressing live view as the camera automatically shut this down sooner than one would want.
B005IHAIMA,14,18,Then one summer day last week, while taking some family photos, I touched the square on the touch screen to fix focus on my kid's face and the screen instantly developed a crack on the inside.Called Sony and explained the issue.
B005IHAIMA,14,19,Touchscreen cracked just by touching while trying to focus the object.
B005IHAIMA,14,20,I've had this camera for a few days now, and have taken probably 45 photos.
B005IHAIMA,14,21,but a factor should be put in mind that the photos may appear less bright on computer's screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,22,However you can always see it enough to frame the image.*
B005IHAIMA,14,23,The third way is on a tripod, using its rear LCD screen.Having previously owned several point and shoot cameras (e.g, Panasonic LX-3, Canon S-90, etc.), I am acutely aware of the limitations of the limitations in aiming, composing and focusing while using the camera's rear LCD screen with the arms extended forward.
B005IHAIMA,14,24,Overall the screen is quite good and I only miss it in very bright sun.-
B005IHAIMA,15,0,Upgraded the firmware to newest version, Auto focus is fast!
B005IHAIMA,15,1,If you buy the viewfinder then you cannot use the enclosed flash while the viewfinder is in use.
B005IHAIMA,15,2,No built in viewfinder - you can buy one for $250 extra but I don't want to spend $250 on a viewfinder - a viewfinder and an extra lens take this camera up to 7N territory in cost which has a lot more than just the viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,15,3,I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2.
B005IHAIMA,15,4,In particular, I'd love to have a wide lens - 11mm or so - for REAL pano shots.
B005IHAIMA,15,5,The lack of a viewfinder take some adjusting to, and adding it is half the price of the camera.
B005IHAIMA,15,6,Waiting for the new firmware to fix it.
B005IHAIMA,15,7,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.
B005IHAIMA,15,8,the lenses make noise, and focus is slow.on the nex, the lenses are silent for focus, and it focuses instantly.
B005IHAIMA,15,9,I first purchased Sony NEX-C3 and liked  many things about it, but two problems caused me to trade it in for Sony NEX-5N, which addressed those two problems.
B005IHAIMA,15,10,I have no idea what they 'upgraded' but so far the problem is gone.
B005IHAIMA,15,11,Live view and manual WB Kelvin adjustment is a wonderful combo which allows finer WB adjustment where a custom WB may not work due to the fast changing light condition.
B005IHAIMA,15,12,The 'upgrade' seems to work, so far I have not had any more issues but I still suspect that it is a software problem since the sound is exactly the same as that produced when you use the control buttons.
B005IHAIMA,15,13,It focuses fast enough though there has been a time or two af has failed me.
B005IHAIMA,15,14,As an owner of Canon 7D and T3i with multiple "L" series lenses, I can honestly say this this little camera's capabilities completely rivals that of my Canon equipment at a fraction of the cost.
B005IHAIMA,15,15,I also wish that the electronic viewfinder option wasn't another 60% of the cost of the camera - seems a little outrageous to me, and I haven't sprung for one yet because of that.Also, after shooting P&S; and DSLRs, it's weird to have to manually zoom a lens while looking at a screen, instead of just pressing a button.
B005IHAIMA,15,16,However the mount on the OLED electronic viewfinder is only compatible with NEX-5N and is not compatible with NEX-C3.Update: I now own the OLED view finder.
B005IHAIMA,15,17,It is still going strong and we use it all the time without fail it takes the nicest photos with the least amount of out of focus shots I have ever had.
B005IHAIMA,15,18,So far this camera delivers.The cons will be that there are not many lenses available and they are steep in price.
B005IHAIMA,15,19,Plus the flange distance of the mount is so short you can put pretty much ANY lens you want on this thing from Leica/Zeiss/Voigtlander M glass to old Nikon & Canon manual focus lenses.
B005IHAIMA,15,20,sharply focused), it works really well for most things, it's not quite precise enough to get critical focus on an eye with f/1.4 lens, but for most portraits and video work it does a great job outlining the in focus subject.4)
B005IHAIMA,15,21,On top of that the camera has no AutoISO in full manual mode and AutoISO is limited to 100-3200.On a DSLR this is less of a problem since it's very quick to switch between A/S modes when the lighting changes.
B005IHAIMA,15,22,With the latest firmware update, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,15,23,I'm an employee in an electronics store and work in the camera department.
B005IHAIMA,15,24,After it focuses you can also manually fine-tune the focus to your object.
B005IHAIMA,16,0,Who knows, and at this point, who cares.After one more call to Sony, they said they would have a technician call me, but so far, no one has called.
B005IHAIMA,16,1,I call back and Im told that I am already in line to get a call from a Tech.
B005IHAIMA,16,2,FURTHER UPDATE  ***After dodging my calls, I finally gave up on Sony support.
B005IHAIMA,16,3,Finally I contacted Sony support and they told me that the camera had to be sent in for repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,4,The representative assured me that I would have to ship the camera at my expense but it would be repaired and send back at no charge.
B005IHAIMA,16,5,My first was returned before being aware of the Service Call issued by Sony for the clicking issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,6,My revised rating and review is based off the poor experience with Sony Technical Support and the repair of the issue.I contacted Sony Service using the repair number of my Service Call repair, after receiving my "repaired" 5n and noticing the new sound issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,7,My next camera will probably be a Nikon or a Canon, from a company that actually takes pride in their cameras.
B005IHAIMA,16,8,I call Sony Service and reference the email about the expedited return and repair as well as my original repair #.
B005IHAIMA,16,9,Unfortunately they require that the camera be shipped to a Sony service center for repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,10,I just called Sony and they confirmed that the issue is still there and that customers need to send their $700 cameras if they find the clicking issue.I asked them whether they can tell me a way to figure out whether the issue is still present but they said they cannot.
B005IHAIMA,16,11,Sony is finally acknowledging the problem just not saying what it is and if the fix will completely fix the problem.
B005IHAIMA,16,12,Defective after Sony Repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,13,The person again states that the Tech is already set to call me.The next day I get the call.
B005IHAIMA,16,14,TBH, Sony customer service was very good and they paid for shipping.
B005IHAIMA,16,15,You sure you want to buy something new at a cost of $700 and send it back straight to the service center and wait for 5 days or more and still have that problem there after it comes back?
B005IHAIMA,16,16,DO NOT BUY UNTIL SONY ADDRESSES CLICKING ISSUE.
B005IHAIMA,16,17,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,16,18,A day later I received an email advising I would receive a response soon.Two days later I receive an email from a Tech stating they would overnight the body and expedite the repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,19,Don't know the Sony repair engineers assessed it as physically damaged.Gonna get it back, sell it for whatever I can get and swear never to buy a Sony product again!!!
B005IHAIMA,16,20,UPDATE: 21 FEB 2012: Amazon appears to be looking into this issue now - I believe they are intercepting/checking my return to verify this problem.
B005IHAIMA,16,21,I received this camera around 11/10 and called the next day for a replacement.
B005IHAIMA,16,22,(check on YouTube)Sony not helping with solving the problem, they offer to send the camera back and the process will take around 30 days to get it back fixed.They offered me to buy a new one and return the old one if I don't want to be without a camera for a month.
B005IHAIMA,16,23,You then have to argue with Sony about replacing the new camera you sent to them for repair - good luck with that.
B005IHAIMA,16,24,But back it goes to Sony for repair, since I'm now out of the return period.
B005IHAIMA,17,0,No auto ISR on Manual mode (some DSLR's will let you do this).Overall,
B005IHAIMA,17,1,Manual adjustments....don't be scared....no problem.
B005IHAIMA,17,2,The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.
B005IHAIMA,17,3,The controls are much better, allowing things like manual focus, manual exposure, etc.
B005IHAIMA,17,4,I then used the Right Key Setting on the rotary dial for White Balance, and the Soft Key B Setting for ISO.
B005IHAIMA,17,5,On top of that the camera has no AutoISO in full manual mode and AutoISO is limited to 100-3200.On a DSLR this is less of a problem since it's very quick to switch between A/S modes when the lighting changes.
B005IHAIMA,17,6,It's simple, just switch to the Menu mode and then select Brightness/Color and ISO setting is right there.
B005IHAIMA,17,7,I tested with kit lens taking the same photos in both auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,17,8,If you shoot manual focus lenses and/or in RAW mode, the C3 probably is sufficient.
B005IHAIMA,17,9,It is still going strong and we use it all the time without fail it takes the nicest photos with the least amount of out of focus shots I have ever had.
B005IHAIMA,17,10,I use my manual lenses on M or A modes, but have been using several of the scene modes where it will adjust shutter speed and ISO and other parameters to give you their scene shot.
B005IHAIMA,17,11,And most of the time, I am just using the intelligent auto feature.
B005IHAIMA,17,12,Low light...no problem.
B005IHAIMA,17,13,Auto ISO is available as an option.
B005IHAIMA,17,14,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,17,15,You will almost never need to use the flash on the NEX, and that alone will make a huge difference versus washed out flash photos from a point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,17,16,From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.
B005IHAIMA,17,17,With the Canon S95 point-and-shoot, I can switch from Auto to Scene mode through the mode dial and then select HDR option (if I left it in HDR mode then I don't even have to scroll and I've switched to HDR mode in the flick of a dial).
B005IHAIMA,17,18,I got better results with iAuto or Scene modes than w PASM.
B005IHAIMA,17,19,Auto focus is near perfect in good light, and very good in low light.Macro with the kit zoom, using menu setting "Camera - AF/MF - DMF".  can give some pretty nice shots, but you will need to stay 9-10" away with this lens to focus.
B005IHAIMA,17,20,After it focuses you can also manually fine-tune the focus to your object.
B005IHAIMA,17,21,Plus, even in the program mode or intelligent auto you can make adjustments to the picture (you can adjust shutter speed by telling the thumb wheel).
B005IHAIMA,17,22,It is obvious that the documentation that Sony provided with the camera was not designed for an experienced dSLR user but once I figured out where the shutter and aperture mode was on manual mode, it was very easy to set and use.On Manual Mode, the rotary dial controls the shutter setting.
B005IHAIMA,17,23,I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2.
B005IHAIMA,17,24,They are used in manual focus mode of course but Sony has included a magical feature - the in-focus points are highlighted in a bright color - which makes this quite easy.
B005IHAIMA,18,0,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,18,1,In shutter priority mode, it allows you to select shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,2,90% of my photos are in program mode so I don't even really adjust aperture or shutter.
B005IHAIMA,18,3,Very small lag on the shutter.
B005IHAIMA,18,4,(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,5,In evening events like volleyball and soccer, I used ISO 800 and 1600 to still get fast shutter to stop the action.
B005IHAIMA,18,6,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,18,7,I also noticed the same exact spots when is happened to use iso 100 and 1 second shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,8,Switching modes is requires several button pressesLowlight auto focusing slow and very unreliableTouchscreen interface nearly useless.
B005IHAIMA,18,9,From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.
B005IHAIMA,18,10,Simply hold down the button that you push to take pictures and this camera automatically shoots off in rapid fire mode.
B005IHAIMA,18,11,Also, I can change a lot of the settings that on regular point and shoots I couldn't change i.e. how long the picture review stays on.
B005IHAIMA,18,12,The touch screen lags a bit while the rotary dial is fast and instantaneous.As someone who shoots primarily on Manual Mode and on Aperture Priority, it was fairly easy to set the camera on this preferred mode.
B005IHAIMA,18,13,ISO performance holds up to 100% on screen inspection up to ISO 6400, though the auto ISO only goes up to ISO 3200.
B005IHAIMA,18,14,The first time I noticed it the iso was 3200.
B005IHAIMA,18,15,Pressing on the "Down" button shifts the rotary dial control to Aperture and turning the rotary button allows the user to change the aperture setting.On Aperture Priority Mode, the rotary dial controls the aperture setting and pressing on the "Down" button allows the user to adjust the exposure compensation function.On both modes, pressing the "Left" button allows the user to change the Shooting Mode (single, continuous, timer, remote, bracketing).The ISO, White Balance and Metering Mode are easily accessed through the more ponderous menu option.
B005IHAIMA,18,16,Then, of course, you would like to change shutter speed, f/stop, and the ISO setting.
B005IHAIMA,18,17,They both involve the screen flickering about 1/2 second after you turn the camera off under different circumstances.
B005IHAIMA,18,18,Occasional flash, reviewed most shots, probably took over 200 shots total.The controls are superb.
B005IHAIMA,18,19,That's too long and really makes it useless when you need to be snapping multiple shots.
B005IHAIMA,18,20,The manual focus on that is slightly noisier, and it shows up if recording video, but that is literally the only complaint I have for this camera.
B005IHAIMA,18,21,My 21YO said "I'm 21, I should be able to find all the settings within 5 seconds - if I can't, there's something wrong."
B005IHAIMA,18,22,It overheats  and turns off after about ten minutes of shooting 1080 video.
B005IHAIMA,18,23,So we changed it to that setting and spent awhile trying to make faces while partially pressing the shutter.
B005IHAIMA,18,24,While shooting I went 114 shots (keepers) over 2 hours and was only down to 60%.
B005IHAIMA,19,0,The include flash...is a flash.
B005IHAIMA,19,1,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,19,2,Using this with Eye-Fi card, battery last about 160-200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,19,3,Attaching/swapping a mic or a flash requires quite long and annoying process.4.
B005IHAIMA,19,4,They fix this in newer models with the universal horseshoe, but as long as you are just an average Joe who will just go with the included flash, it isn't a deal breaker.
B005IHAIMA,19,5,buy it nowww!
B005IHAIMA,19,6,I do very little direct flash lighting, so it's not something I would use much.I have ordered the optional flash, which has bounce options.
B005IHAIMA,19,7,great camera, but it has one problem that is fatal, the flash design is flawed.
B005IHAIMA,19,8,The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.
B005IHAIMA,19,9,Video defect is not the only problem.
B005IHAIMA,19,10,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,19,11,Right now I try to take videos with an external mic so it's less of an issue.
B005IHAIMA,19,12,I was not able to attach the flash at all and it kept breaking the contact, consequently the flash would not fire.
B005IHAIMA,19,13,The only complaint I have about this camera is that the flash was a bit annoying to carry around separately and seemed like it could fall off easily.
B005IHAIMA,19,14,This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings.
B005IHAIMA,19,15,You can buy third-party adapters, but those look a little unstable for mounting a big flash unit to the camera.
B005IHAIMA,19,16,I dont want to play camera roulette when I want to buy a new product and waste my money and time guessing what will work.
B005IHAIMA,19,17,I got this with my sony card and it was expensive but worth every dime.
B005IHAIMA,19,18,the screw that secures the attachment of the flash to the top of the camera battery is inaccessible to those that have big fingers!
B005IHAIMA,19,19,Awesome Still Images and Video Quality.
B005IHAIMA,19,20,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,19,21,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,19,22,My Canon batteries charge from empty to full power in under 2 hours.-
B005IHAIMA,19,23,it can't be assessed as a cons but just compare photos few times and you can expect how they will differ on the computer screen.
B005IHAIMA,19,24,But, the photos it took were okay when small, but not so good on a bigger computer screen.
B005IHAIMA,20,0,Its a sony.
B005IHAIMA,20,1,I bought the Canon T3i and returned, Sony A65 and returned again.
B005IHAIMA,20,2,I own a Canon 5DMKII and this camera produces images that compare with the results I get from the big Canon... highly recommended...
B005IHAIMA,20,3,Lets get too the point  !
B005IHAIMA,20,4,I would go for a slightly more expensive DSLR for that such as a Canon Ti.
B005IHAIMA,20,5,Durability and good looks...its a Sony.
B005IHAIMA,20,6,Although I do have some previous knoweledge and experience with DSLR cameras both digital and film.
B005IHAIMA,20,7,This is the camera that replaced my Canon DSLR.I went on a trip to the Canadians Rockies a few months ago.
B005IHAIMA,20,8,For several years, I've used a pro camera (Canon EOS 5D Mark II 21.1MP Full Frame CMOS Digital SLR Camera with EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens) and when it was too much of a hassle to lug all that gear around an enthusiasts' compact with lots of manual controls (Canon PowerShot S95 10 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD).
B005IHAIMA,20,9,That is pretty common for digital cameras, but still a little disappointing considering the price of this camera.
B005IHAIMA,20,10,Replaced my DSLR Canon Rebel XS with this Sony.
B005IHAIMA,20,11,The lenses are expensive to be sure, the zoom sound is very noticeable during filming (manual zoom with kit lens) and the non-directional mics pic up a lot of wind noise, but the video quality is spectacular.
B005IHAIMA,20,12,I have for the last 10 years just had a canon powershot that I could put in my pocket.
B005IHAIMA,20,13,While it's a lot smaller than DSLR flashes (like Canon Speedlite), it's also much lighter and cheaper.
B005IHAIMA,20,14,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,20,15,Since that camera, I've owned over 35 digital cameras and have witnessed the evolution of digital imaging, with great excitement, to the present day.All the while I've been waiting for the size and weight of digital SLR's to come down.
B005IHAIMA,20,16,I upgraded my point and shoot to this Sony and couldn't be more pleased.
B005IHAIMA,20,17,Great transition camera from point and shoots, works as well as most DSLR!!!
B005IHAIMA,20,18,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.
B005IHAIMA,20,19,Excellent cameraWas undecided between the Canon T3i and this model but it is very good.
B005IHAIMA,20,20,I own the canon elph 300hs and the nikon d3100 and this by far beats both.
B005IHAIMA,20,21,You may like to look for a good used Sony 16mm pancake lens, or a used 16-50 power zoom, as I did.B./
B005IHAIMA,20,22,I used to use a Canon SD1000 for a pocket shooter, but that was limited in usefulness (obviously).
B005IHAIMA,20,23,With the 55-210 mm telephoto zoom lens (or any of the other large superzooms for the E-mount like the Sony Alpha SEL18200 E-mount 18-200mm F3.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,20,24,It has more dynamic range than a full-frame Canon 5D Mark II, and it has better video quality as well.
B005IHAIMA,21,0,I cannot say it was outperformed by say, Nikkor's kit lens in any way.
B005IHAIMA,21,1,I wish the lens cap had a leash.
B005IHAIMA,21,2,Not exactly portable/pocket with the kit lens attached--you may have to get the 16mm pancake lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,3,You may like to look for a good used Sony 16mm pancake lens, or a used 16-50 power zoom, as I did.B./
B005IHAIMA,21,4,I cleaned the lens and sensor, but the spots remained.
B005IHAIMA,21,5,For this reason, it is inevitable and also advantageous to use one's dSLR lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.I am able to use my Nikon F-mount lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.
B005IHAIMA,21,6,To combat this, you need to hold the adapter or lens with your left hand.
B005IHAIMA,21,7,A dust cap was placed over the sensor opening for shipment, but otherwise, as far as I can tell nothing was done to it.
B005IHAIMA,21,8,So I bought the NEX-5N with the 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,9,With a pancake lens like the Sony 16mm, the weight and size approximates an XZ2 or LX7.Also, when you point this camera and the pancake lens at a person, there is no "DSLR intimidation" and frown....
B005IHAIMA,21,10,I also bought 16mm lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,11,For those with large lens investments in other formats, you'll find the lack of e-mount lenses for the NEX-5N disappointing, especially when you see the price of the lens adapters.
B005IHAIMA,21,12,The adapter is almost as large as a Sony 16mm f/2.8 prime lens so using 3rd party lenses on the NEX-5N as I have done with my Nikkor lenses will result in a substantially bigger package than when using Sony's native designed for NEX E-mount lenses.The bigger package aside, I find it easy to manually focus my Nikkor lenses on the NEX-5N.
B005IHAIMA,21,13,bought UV filter and Len cap string because the cap came without a string.Thanks all reviewers contribution, and thanks dpreview.com
B005IHAIMA,21,14,With the 55-210 mm telephoto zoom lens (or any of the other large superzooms for the E-mount like the Sony Alpha SEL18200 E-mount 18-200mm F3.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,21,15,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.
B005IHAIMA,21,16,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.
B005IHAIMA,21,17,Plus the flange distance of the mount is so short you can put pretty much ANY lens you want on this thing from Leica/Zeiss/Voigtlander M glass to old Nikon & Canon manual focus lenses.
B005IHAIMA,21,18,Despite being a pancake lens, this prime lens is big enough that it actually is wider than the NEX-5N both at the top and at the bottom.
B005IHAIMA,21,19,In this manner, I have no problem using my bigger Nikkor F-mount prime and zoom lens with the NEX-5N such as the Nikkor 24-70mm f/2.8, Nikkor 180mm f/2.8 or Zeiss 100mm f/2.0 despite these lenses not having any dedicated lens collar.I have started testing the NEX-5N using my Nikkor lenses and comparing the image I captured using the same lens but mounted on the Nikon D7000.
B005IHAIMA,21,20,With the kit 18-55 mm lens (or smaller) attached, you can slide the NEX-5N into a jacket pocket.
B005IHAIMA,21,21,A great Prime Lens for the Nex e-mount Sony 50mm f/1.8 Mid-Range Lens for Sony E Mount Nex Cameras4.
B005IHAIMA,21,22,Both Tamron lenses cost less than the Sony 16-50mm lens and according to the reviews the difference in IQ, CA, distortion and vignetting was negligible!
B005IHAIMA,21,23,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,21,24,camera shipped with kit lens attached to the body, so NO rear lens cap and NO body cap are supplied.
B005IHAIMA,22,0,Good for still photo.
B005IHAIMA,22,1,Other than that, it is a great camera especially in low light.
B005IHAIMA,22,2,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,22,3,Picture quality is excellent especially low light pics.
B005IHAIMA,22,4,I can't believe how good this thing is in low light conditions.
B005IHAIMA,22,5,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,22,6,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,22,7,Photos great, video sucks.
B005IHAIMA,22,8,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.
B005IHAIMA,22,9,Low light...no problem.
B005IHAIMA,22,10,Even at night with nothing but moon light.
B005IHAIMA,22,11,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,22,12,I have been able to take low light shots, indoor, sunny outdoor, nighttime etc. without any issues.
B005IHAIMA,22,13,This sensitivity means you can shoot without flash much of the time, even indoors and in low light.
B005IHAIMA,22,14,Still, you can get great shots at extremely low light with amazing color that was just not possible at this price range until now.The kit lens is good and much better than I expected based upon some of the reviews I read.
B005IHAIMA,22,15,It takes startlingly great photos even in low light with no flash.Unfortunately mine still has the clicking noise issue when recording video.
B005IHAIMA,22,16,I was very impressed with low light performance.
B005IHAIMA,22,17,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,22,18,Too bad because the camera itself is great.
B005IHAIMA,22,19,Good job at high ISO (low light).Con:
B005IHAIMA,22,20,Very good camera and a very good image.
B005IHAIMA,22,21,It performed much better than my other cameras, but I was not blown away.For standard indoor lighting, the Sony does do pretty well.
B005IHAIMA,22,22,Still, it is a good quality lens that I am happy using, though at a higher price point (5r, natch) I might grumble more about the slowness/sharpness.I found the grip on the camera and the general feel to be good and had no problems in this area.The screen is pretty good in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,22,23,If a family of lenses for every photo situation isn't a problem, there isn't a better camera.
B005IHAIMA,22,24,For instance, a standard outdoor shot will show great color and detail throughout the image, from the pavement to the sky.
B005IHAIMA,23,0,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.
B005IHAIMA,23,1,I have returned the product.
B005IHAIMA,23,2,Too bad I have to return it to Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,3,You can bet that when I buy another camera, it will be from Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,4,Overall, this really is a good product!
B005IHAIMA,23,5,I bought the Canon T3i and returned, Sony A65 and returned again.
B005IHAIMA,23,6,I dont want to play camera roulette when I want to buy a new product and waste my money and time guessing what will work.
B005IHAIMA,23,7,I can't return the camera but I will return the 18-200 lens.
B005IHAIMA,23,8,I'm returning the camera to day to Best Buy.DO THE RIGHT THING SONY, RECALL YOUR DEFECTIVE CAMERA!DO THE RIGHT THING BEST BUY, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!DO THE RIGHT THING AMAZON, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!
B005IHAIMA,23,9,I just bought it two days ago and received it today.
B005IHAIMA,23,10,I bought this camera about a year and a half ago.
B005IHAIMA,23,11,helped me made my final decision.Last year bought Panasonic FZ280 and Nikon 3100 end up returned them all and wait to last Christmas.
B005IHAIMA,23,12,Why the still sell this camera ???Don't buy it !
B005IHAIMA,23,13,You then have to argue with Sony about replacing the new camera you sent to them for repair - good luck with that.
B005IHAIMA,23,14,I bought the first one just before a trip to Japan, and during the first week of the trip it just died for no apparent reason.
B005IHAIMA,23,15,This is REALLY disappointing and as much as I wanted to buy this camera, I will not and do not recommend to do so.
B005IHAIMA,23,16,Why Is Amazon still selling defective models of this camera?
B005IHAIMA,23,17,I purchase this camera, I already tried both T3i and A65 and both of them are returned.
B005IHAIMA,23,18,I am very happy with my purchase and would have given 4.5 stars if possible.
B005IHAIMA,23,19,This puts me just 4 days of my return window with Amazon closing so I am forced to return the defective camera for refund.
B005IHAIMA,23,20,(Due to where I live I couldn't buy it on Amazon and get it shipped to me when I needed it by.)I've
B005IHAIMA,23,21,UPDATE: 21 FEB 2012: Amazon appears to be looking into this issue now - I believe they are intercepting/checking my return to verify this problem.
B005IHAIMA,23,22,When I got back home, I decided to just get a replacement from Amazon, because I still liked the camera design and was hoping that I just had a lemon.
B005IHAIMA,23,23,They went out of their way to discuss this problem with me and immediately refunded my purchase.___________________________________________________________________________________________I
B005IHAIMA,23,24,I didn't pay $700 to get a defective camera that needed to be fixed.
B005IHAIMA,24,0,This change has made me more willing to learn and adopt to the different sets of controls in these cameras.
B005IHAIMA,24,1,I didnt even get a users manual with mine and it only took me 20minutes to go through all the menus and adjust settings to my liking.
B005IHAIMA,24,2,The help menu does really help with basic use of the camera.
B005IHAIMA,24,3,Under the "Setup" Menu", one can proceed to the Custom Key Settings.
B005IHAIMA,24,4,I'm a long time Nikon user, going back over 40 years.
B005IHAIMA,24,5,My mindset is essentially that of learning and adopting to the different camera controls rather than one wanting to maintain a consistent set of controls among the different cameras.
B005IHAIMA,24,6,I like that you can set up to 5 menu items under a custom button and switch things fast.
B005IHAIMA,24,7,Touchscreen menu is not as confusing as some people said.
B005IHAIMA,24,8,Sony has two features in the NEX-5N which makes manual focusing easy.
B005IHAIMA,24,9,From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.
B005IHAIMA,24,10,I thought maybe there was a setting in the menu to switch from PAL to NTSC, so I referenced the manual and to make a long story short, there is not a way to change this.
B005IHAIMA,24,11,It's simple, just switch to the Menu mode and then select Brightness/Color and ISO setting is right there.
B005IHAIMA,24,12,For most of us, there are only a few special settings that we change with any frequency.
B005IHAIMA,24,13,For whatever reason, Sony chose to group these functions under the "Brightness/Color" menu instead of under the "Setup" menu.Under the "Setup" Menu, there were a few goodies that are worth mentioning.
B005IHAIMA,24,14,Sony, if you read these Amazon reviews, please add the option to control shooting mode from the bottom-right button on the camera!
B005IHAIMA,24,15,My basic Canon DSLR offers far superior control.3.
B005IHAIMA,24,16,The result is a "IMPROVEMENT" (read the word).
B005IHAIMA,24,17,The instruction manual details this.
B005IHAIMA,24,18,I prefer to set my WB manually using the Kelvin setting and here, the Sony NEX-5N has smaller increments in its Kelvin setting adjustment than my dSLRs, including the Nikon D7000 and D700.
B005IHAIMA,24,19,I do wish there was a bit more flexibility with setting custom buttons (there are only three physical buttons that you can customize, and it doesn't allow for ALL functions to be used.)
B005IHAIMA,24,20,I only changed a few menu items from what dpreview.com
B005IHAIMA,24,21,The NEX-5N overcomes these problems by including a control wheel and several physical buttons that change function depending on current shooting mode.
B005IHAIMA,24,22,This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings.
B005IHAIMA,24,23,I found this a bit disappointing initially but like my Nikon D3100, I learned to cope with it and it became less of an issue.WHITE BALANCE: What Sony takes in terms of limiting the ISO increment adjustment it gives back in the WB setting.
B005IHAIMA,24,24,That's just a small irk though.Hopefully this helps if you're a photography novice like I am.
B005IHAIMA,25,0,Video "clicking" noise issue fixed.
B005IHAIMA,25,1,Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012.
B005IHAIMA,25,2,The clicking is still an issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,3,Still has the click noise when shooting video.
B005IHAIMA,25,4,There is an audio clicking problem for this new camera in video mode...
B005IHAIMA,25,5,Audio clicking problem in video mode.
B005IHAIMA,25,6,DO NOT BUY UNTIL SONY ADDRESSES CLICKING ISSUE.
B005IHAIMA,25,7,The key concern is the video "clicking" noise issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,8,M. F. Click issue is a big problem for this product.
B005IHAIMA,25,9,No problems at 1080p/24fps.Only regret is we didn't buy this a year ago.PROS:Amazing picture and video quality.
B005IHAIMA,25,10,I wanted it for the video quality.
B005IHAIMA,25,11,No Sequential Ordering for Video Files!!!
B005IHAIMA,25,12,I have to explain that the camera has already been sent in for that issue and that the problem is something else.
B005IHAIMA,25,13,I thought SONY has fixed the clicking noise problem in the most recent product.
B005IHAIMA,25,14,Sony is finally acknowledging the problem just not saying what it is and if the fix will completely fix the problem.
B005IHAIMA,25,15,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,25,16,too bad sony screwed up the video recording.
B005IHAIMA,25,17,The defect does not affect the picture quality of still images or video, but it does make the video recording feature unusable as the clicking noise is very noticeable.
B005IHAIMA,25,18,Everything is good except the annoying click noise in video mode.
B005IHAIMA,25,19,Shame on you Sony.
B005IHAIMA,25,20,Sony fails with NEX-5N, video with click out of the box.
B005IHAIMA,25,21,Thought you can cheat ????For all who are going to buy this product and just bought, make sure you see the "Unboxing videos" in You-tube and check you have similar packings / New product stickers.
B005IHAIMA,25,22,I just called Sony and they confirmed that the issue is still there and that customers need to send their $700 cameras if they find the clicking issue.I asked them whether they can tell me a way to figure out whether the issue is still present but they said they cannot.
B005IHAIMA,25,23,Sony is aware of the problem and has developed a fix.
B005IHAIMA,25,24,My first was returned before being aware of the Service Call issued by Sony for the clicking issue.
B002IPHIEG,0,0,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,0,1,It's also super-portable and has an awesome battery life.
B002IPHIEG,0,2,battery life5.-touch
B002IPHIEG,0,3,The battery has a decent life as well.
B002IPHIEG,0,4,Battery life could be better.
B002IPHIEG,0,5,Battery life seems pretty good.So what's not to like about this camera?1.
B002IPHIEG,0,6,I used it as soon as I got the battery charged - and that, the battery, is the only thing I can say is a slight negative.
B002IPHIEG,0,7,Battery does not last as long as the old Sony I have (T-3 and T-30)2.
B002IPHIEG,0,8,As soon as the battery charged, I started using the camera.
B002IPHIEG,0,9,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,0,10,It is not unusual to go through two batteries in an hour or two, even when they are fully charged.
B002IPHIEG,0,11,Great Little Camera.
B002IPHIEG,0,12,If I had it to do over, I would not buy a camera with a touchscreen.One other thing--this thing eats batteries.
B002IPHIEG,0,13,The battery lasts super long.
B002IPHIEG,0,14,Long story short, outdoor pics were great, the camera size was excellent, and battery life was out of this world.
B002IPHIEG,0,15,We used it on our vacation to Washington DC and it and the battery would last all day.Well worth the investment.
B002IPHIEG,0,16,I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.
B002IPHIEG,0,17,I also bought the underwater case to take pictures under water, both of them combine work perfect.
B002IPHIEG,0,18,It just works.
B002IPHIEG,0,19,Takes good pictures inside or out.
B002IPHIEG,0,20,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,0,21,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,0,22,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,0,23,I LOVED it from day one!
B002IPHIEG,0,24,Great Little Pocket Camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,0,Screen delamination or is it moisture haze?
B002IPHIEG,1,1,It also has a touch screen feature which I'm not so fond of.
B002IPHIEG,1,2,Love the touch screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,3,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.
B002IPHIEG,1,4,The camera is all touch screen and is more of an iPod Touch feel to it.
B002IPHIEG,1,5,The screen gets smudged so easily.
B002IPHIEG,1,6,Some people might not like the touch screen, but it's actually quite easy to manipulate.
B002IPHIEG,1,7,The touch screen is very sensitive.
B002IPHIEG,1,8,The touch screen is so easy to use and the camera fits anywhere.
B002IPHIEG,1,9,That screen is easy to maneuver around.
B002IPHIEG,1,10,The touch screen is very intuitive and responsive.
B002IPHIEG,1,11,I Love this camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,12,This is my first touch screen camera and I was hesitant.
B002IPHIEG,1,13,Remarkable, actually.The touch screen is easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,1,14,Great Little Camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,15,Being touch screen, it is a different excitement.
B002IPHIEG,1,16,The important thing is to not touch the adhesive.
B002IPHIEG,1,17,Love it!
B002IPHIEG,1,18,I love that it doesn't have a touch screen (I don't have the patience for those) which adds to it's ease of use.
B002IPHIEG,1,19,Love it.
B002IPHIEG,1,20,The Large LCD screen is Spectacular as is the color in the photos.
B002IPHIEG,1,21,But, I'm really glad I have both of them because they each have some very positive features.UPDATE 7/20/12: From the beginning, the touch screen had an unusual look as if a screen protector was on it.
B002IPHIEG,1,22,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,1,23,When your shots look good on the view screen, they will be even more pleasing on a correctly calibrated HD monitor.2) The white balance options never seem to look right on the view screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,24,It is an Awesome camera that takes beautiful clear photos!! Great Close up, Great far away!!
B002IPHIEG,2,0,Also, I don't like that you have to be in 4:3 mode to get the full 10 mp but I think that's just an area of the picture issue (I love shooting in 16:9 . . .
B002IPHIEG,2,1,Takes better pictures than any other camera I've owned.
B002IPHIEG,2,2,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,2,3,Even in auto mode, the Canon took consistently good pictures, important when handing your camera to someone to shoot your picture.
B002IPHIEG,2,4,I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon.
B002IPHIEG,2,5,The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90.
B002IPHIEG,2,6,The Canon has faster glass (f/2.0),
B002IPHIEG,2,7,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,2,8,After a LOT of research, I decided to bite the bullet and get this camera.
B002IPHIEG,2,9,While the Sony was good, the Canon was the clear winner here.
B002IPHIEG,2,10,For people who look for good image quality, stay away from it until the 1st firmware upgrade comes along and see if Sony fixed some issues such as display and image compression.
B002IPHIEG,2,11,It just works.
B002IPHIEG,2,12,I really like that.I'm hopeful I'll be able to dial in what I need on this camera and be able to count on awesome shots, but so far, I'm not getting the quality of pictures I'd hoped for with this 10 megapixel camera.
B002IPHIEG,2,13,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,2,14,So why am I reviewing a camera that seems like a downgrade?Well Sony is using a new lens system called the "Exmor R".
B002IPHIEG,2,15,We have had many Sony cyber shot cameras over the past 3 years.
B002IPHIEG,2,16,Recently I upgraded from the Sony dsc w1 to the wx1 (5 years of technology development in between).
B002IPHIEG,2,17,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,2,18,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,2,19,I loved all of the features of this camera but the first thing that i care about is quality of photos which this camera has lack of it.
B002IPHIEG,2,20,I wonder if point and shoot cameras like this one could do better.
B002IPHIEG,2,21,Just amazing in photo and video quality..
B002IPHIEG,2,22,So I will wait, and see what happens in the next few months.
B002IPHIEG,2,23,Best point and shoot available.
B002IPHIEG,2,24,I disregarded several of the negative reviews I read on this, trying to be optimistic, but that isn't working out for me.
B002IPHIEG,3,0,Vedio quality is great as well.
B002IPHIEG,3,1,Overall is good.
B002IPHIEG,3,2,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,3,3,I use it for my blog and the picture quality and audio are great.
B002IPHIEG,3,4,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,3,5,Otherwise this is a great little camera with nice features.
B002IPHIEG,3,6,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,7,The mono-microphone is pretty sensitive and provides a good sound quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,8,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,9,Better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,10,The camera is great for the functionality, clear photos and movies and the price was right.
B002IPHIEG,3,11,The video function works great but I wish I  had  a mike I could plug in for better sound.
B002IPHIEG,3,12,Horrible picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,13,Photos were posted that looked really good.
B002IPHIEG,3,14,We shut like 200 photos with this new camera - most of them are of poor quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,15,Just amazing in photo and video quality..
B002IPHIEG,3,16,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,3,17,Image quality was not what I expected.
B002IPHIEG,3,18,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,3,19,When I first saw this new camera, I thought this could me my next love, but we had a very short honeymoon - about 3 hours - then the ugly separation ensued!I'll be brief and to the point - the video was pretty good, but the pictures were actually horrible.
B002IPHIEG,3,20,When I first saw this new camera, I thought this could me my next love, but we had a very short honeymoon - about 3 hours - then the ugly separation ensued!I'll be brief and to the point - the video was pretty good, but the pictures were actually horrible.
B002IPHIEG,3,21,This little gem is about the size of a cell phone and takes very decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,3,22,Although the sound is MONO compared to ZS3's Stereo, but the video quality and easy to work with editing software make up the difference!
B002IPHIEG,3,23,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,3,24,I didn't realize that the camera recorded video, so I tried it and it was lower quality than a dedicated video camera, but for a backup it is very acceptable.In short, I think this camera would be great for the everyday photographer, and as a backup camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,0,What shots I took!
B002IPHIEG,4,1,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,4,2,One stop shot!
B002IPHIEG,4,3,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,4,4,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,5,It auto adjust to light so you always get great pictures.
B002IPHIEG,4,6,If your looking for a quick easy point and shoot, this camera is for you.
B002IPHIEG,4,7,Vedio quality is great as well.
B002IPHIEG,4,8,Great low light pictures!
B002IPHIEG,4,9,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,4,10,You need to know what mode to be in to get a good shot and, as an amateur, I am not always sure what to do.
B002IPHIEG,4,11,However, did you ever try looking at "no flash" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode?
B002IPHIEG,4,12,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,13,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,4,14,If you have low light though, it is capable of giving you some great shots.
B002IPHIEG,4,15,Overall is good.
B002IPHIEG,4,16,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,4,17,All my shots have turned out great!
B002IPHIEG,4,18,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,4,19,Great size and lots of features.
B002IPHIEG,4,20,Otherwise this is a great little camera with nice features.
B002IPHIEG,4,21,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,4,22,It has an anti blur mode meaning that it shoots 5 shots and blends them into one to create one great picture.
B002IPHIEG,4,23,The auto feature is generally gives good result and if somebody is not satisfied with that it also has some very good scene settings as well.
B002IPHIEG,4,24,Controls are laid out sensibly, and it's easy to switch from automated settings to finer image control.One of the coolest new features is Panorama mode, which makes ultra-wide photos quickly and easily.
B002IPHIEG,5,0,Its shot response more fast than I think.
B002IPHIEG,5,1,Focus is fast.
B002IPHIEG,5,2,The processing time is fast, very fast.
B002IPHIEG,5,3,Great indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,5,4,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,5,5,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,5,6,Maybe I wasn't doing it right but they didn't seem to help much.The best bet for action and fast moving subjects with this camera seems to be the burst mode, which rips off 10 shots one after another when the shutter is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,5,7,It takes pictures quickly, and the quality of the shots is usually excellent.
B002IPHIEG,5,8,It's easy to whip out and snap a shot when the moment is right.
B002IPHIEG,5,9,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,5,10,Great camera.
B002IPHIEG,5,11,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,5,12,I want a camera that I don't know is there, that I can whip out in 2 seconds to snap off a shot.
B002IPHIEG,5,13,Shutter lag (time from pushing the shutter button until photo taken),is very low for a pocket camera.What's not so good:-Noise reduction smears details at ISO 400 and above.
B002IPHIEG,5,14,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,5,15,The second feature allows this camera to shoot up to 10f/sec.
B002IPHIEG,5,16,The Sony Cyber-shot takes wonderful indoor / low light pictures with fast shutter speed.
B002IPHIEG,5,17,About the video be sure and buy a fast chip if you want good video Sony pro duo is a bit to slow for action shots.
B002IPHIEG,5,18,I just returned a different camera because the shutter lag was horrible and so was the indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,5,19,The zoom is difficult to use it moves to fast.
B002IPHIEG,5,20,It has an anti-blur mode which is awesome indoors without a flash.
B002IPHIEG,5,21,It has great quality picutres, easy to use, fast, etc!
B002IPHIEG,5,22,Great Camera for price.
B002IPHIEG,5,23,There is no delay when snapping that pic so you get exactly what you wanted.
B002IPHIEG,5,24,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,6,0,You can upgrade your video card, but that is expensive and doesn't even work that well.
B002IPHIEG,6,1,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,6,2,The only problem with it is you NEED to by a memory card, otherwise you can only store a couple of images on the camera's internal memory.
B002IPHIEG,6,3,Reformating memory stick is best done on computer.
B002IPHIEG,6,4,Taking HD Video takes up so much space on the memory card.
B002IPHIEG,6,5,Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.
B002IPHIEG,6,6,Use MS Windows software for downloading.Overall: I am happy with purchase.
B002IPHIEG,6,7,Great camera only one thing you need to know.
B002IPHIEG,6,8,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,6,9,Since my other cameras have been Sony cameras, I have already had memory stick cards and readers, so to me, its not a big deal.
B002IPHIEG,6,10,No HDMI.Expensive Memory Stick Duo.
B002IPHIEG,6,11,I bought an 8 gig card for it and it seems adequate so far.This is a great product that has really worked well for me.
B002IPHIEG,6,12,I thought before buying that this would just be easier than stiching the photos on my computer.
B002IPHIEG,6,13,Battery has to be taken out and charged externally, i prefer the ones which can be charged through usb therefore allowing you to copy photos while also charging the camera.
B002IPHIEG,6,14,This is a great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,6,15,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,6,16,The indoor shots seem pretty good (I'm still working on this.
B002IPHIEG,6,17,Be prepared to download to the computer, or a portable computer drive that stores a lot of gigs.
B002IPHIEG,6,18,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,6,19,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.
B002IPHIEG,6,20,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,6,21,Still image and print quality are very important to me.
B002IPHIEG,6,22,Newer models can use either a Sony card or SD card.
B002IPHIEG,6,23,(it's really ugly)No USB Charging.
B002IPHIEG,6,24,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,7,0,Great little digital.
B002IPHIEG,7,1,Great Little Pocket Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,2,Great
B002IPHIEG,7,3,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,4,It just is TOO small.
B002IPHIEG,7,5,Great pocket camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,6,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,7,7,Very small (fits in a pocket) and very easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,7,8,This Sony camera is a great small portable digital camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,9,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,7,10,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,7,11,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,7,12,Great camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,13,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,14,Ansel would have had one in his pocket!
B002IPHIEG,7,15,Best compact digital camera I've owned so far!
B002IPHIEG,7,16,Overall, best digital camera I have used.
B002IPHIEG,7,17,I wanted a compact camera to be able to take pictures and then put it in my pocket, and this one is perfect.
B002IPHIEG,7,18,I was looking for better zoom while still maintaining the compact feel.
B002IPHIEG,7,19,This is a great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,20,The camera size is perfect for carrying in your pack or cargo pocket (it's a little large for reg.
B002IPHIEG,7,21,This camera is small enough to go any where you go and take decent quality photos.
B002IPHIEG,7,22,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,23,Great Pocket Camera With A Little Tinkering.
B002IPHIEG,7,24,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,8,0,I would like to thank my boss who pushed me to buy this 24mm wide angle lense camera.Panoramic feature is also great.
B002IPHIEG,8,1,Good Camera- 24mm wide angle is amazing.
B002IPHIEG,8,2,As a former owner of a Sony A700 with 16-80mm Carl z lenses, plus a whole bag of long range lenses.
B002IPHIEG,8,3,Lens distortion is amazingly low, even at wide angle.+
B002IPHIEG,8,4,I love this camera!GREAT THINGS about this: The slim design with a built-in cover to protect the lens instead of needing a lens cap is great.
B002IPHIEG,8,5,Light and small for the lens range.3)
B002IPHIEG,8,6,I was looking for better zoom while still maintaining the compact feel.
B002IPHIEG,8,7,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,8,8,The quality of photos are exceptional, nice small size, solid build, a great package.
B002IPHIEG,8,9,I was surprised at how small the box it came in was, and even more surprised when I found the camera in the small box.
B002IPHIEG,8,10,I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon.
B002IPHIEG,8,11,The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90.
B002IPHIEG,8,12,A nice 24mm wide angle lens, which lets you get very close to things and is also great for cramped indoor settings, buildings and landscapes.
B002IPHIEG,8,13,The aesthetics of the camera is not very great, I would love to see some design elements in it for the camera at this price.I would recommend this camera to anyone who can manage to spend little extra money to buy this 24mm wide lense, its worth it.
B002IPHIEG,8,14,Dealing with toting all that stuff around, cleaning lenses, I finally got sick of it and sold everything on eBay and bought this camera, sure the image quality will never touch the A700 DSLR but I find the joy of photography is having a camera always with you.
B002IPHIEG,8,15,I needed low light capabilities for indoor and nighttime pictures without a flash and a wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,8,16,It was little more than my budget but as I look back now it was worth spending $50 more for this 24mm wide angle feature.
B002IPHIEG,8,17,i like how the lens cover slides down and how slim the camera is.
B002IPHIEG,8,18,The image quality is not going to be as good as a larger camera with a non-folded lens system and a bigger sensor.
B002IPHIEG,8,19,It is not the same package of everything you have with your DSLR and collection of lenses shrunk down to something the size of a couple of packs of gum.
B002IPHIEG,8,20,Taking a picture with the camera turned sideways to better frame a specific shot shows a lot of distortion from the wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,8,21,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,8,22,This is not to say they are DSLR quality, but they don't look bad at all for a point and shoot.Other positives:4.
B002IPHIEG,8,23,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,8,24,I bought this camera because of its 24mm super wide lens and the promise of Sony's new Exmor R chip.
B002IPHIEG,9,0,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,9,1,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,9,2,Great low light pictures!
B002IPHIEG,9,3,For me, it was all about picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,4,small but wish it better low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,5,Contrary to some reviews, the image quality has been oustanding.
B002IPHIEG,9,6,Image quality was not what I expected.
B002IPHIEG,9,7,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,9,8,Photo quality under poor light conditions is amazing; photos are better than expected.
B002IPHIEG,9,9,Excellent low lighting performance.
B002IPHIEG,9,10,If you have low light though, it is capable of giving you some great shots.
B002IPHIEG,9,11,The low light capability was good, but not that much better than my Sony H20.
B002IPHIEG,9,12,Took great pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,13,The big disappointmet was the bright light image quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,14,The low light pictures were much better then any other camera I have owned.
B002IPHIEG,9,15,Excellent pictures with the right lighting.
B002IPHIEG,9,16,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,9,17,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,9,18,It's been said that these new optics have TWICE the low light quality as the previous cameras.
B002IPHIEG,9,19,The colors and lighting in the videos are excellent.
B002IPHIEG,9,20,Love the low light feature.
B002IPHIEG,9,21,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,9,22,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,9,23,The low light photos (without a flash) are incredible!
B002IPHIEG,9,24,It was NOT good at all.
B002IPHIEG,10,0,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,1,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,10,2,Great Camera for price.
B002IPHIEG,10,3,Elegant looking camera, love it!
B002IPHIEG,10,4,she loves it.
B002IPHIEG,10,5,Excellent buy for its price; a really good little camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,6,good features for the price.
B002IPHIEG,10,7,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,10,8,For the price the camera is defiantly worth it i recommend it 100%
B002IPHIEG,10,9,Such a great camera!
B002IPHIEG,10,10,I LOVED it!
B002IPHIEG,10,11,I have had this camera for a little over a year.
B002IPHIEG,10,12,Love it.
B002IPHIEG,10,13,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,14,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,10,15,I mean NOTHING.CAMERA NOT RECOMMENDED.
B002IPHIEG,10,16,Highly recommend this product.
B002IPHIEG,10,17,Not worth the price.
B002IPHIEG,10,18,not easy making a 16 year old happy, but this does it.
B002IPHIEG,10,19,I absolutly love and highly recommend it.
B002IPHIEG,10,20,What a great camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,21,fast prompt service at a good price.
B002IPHIEG,10,22,He loved it!
B002IPHIEG,10,23,I love the camera, unfortunately I returned it, because it had a lot of scratches, next time I'll buy a new one.
B002IPHIEG,10,24,Waited until the price came down a bit and bought it.
B002IPHIEG,11,0,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,1,Great features, simple and easy to use settings.
B002IPHIEG,11,2,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,3,Very easy to use and great options!
B002IPHIEG,11,4,However, it is very easy to use and the instruction booklet is great.
B002IPHIEG,11,5,A great camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,6,Really good camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,7,Such a great camera!
B002IPHIEG,11,8,Great Little Camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,9,It has great quality picutres, easy to use, fast, etc!
B002IPHIEG,11,10,Great size and lots of features.
B002IPHIEG,11,11,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,11,12,This is a great camera, Ive had it now for over a month andn it's very easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,11,13,So far, it is working great for me.
B002IPHIEG,11,14,Wasn't looking for dslr quality, but something that looked  nice would be useful.
B002IPHIEG,11,15,It is very intuitive, and easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,11,16,Great camera only one thing you need to know.
B002IPHIEG,11,17,The camera is easy to use, not too many buttons that you'll never use.
B002IPHIEG,11,18,The screen is about as easy to navigate as you could ask for.
B002IPHIEG,11,19,It is also intuitive and easy to use the advanced functions without much of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,11,20,The controls are pretty intuitive and easy for an amateur like me to figure out.
B002IPHIEG,11,21,Very easy to use once you get into it.-
B002IPHIEG,11,22,It is very light and easy to carry.
B002IPHIEG,11,23,I found it amazingly easy to use with just that little bit of reading.
B002IPHIEG,11,24,Great little digital.
B002IPHIEG,12,0,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,12,1,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,12,2,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!
B002IPHIEG,12,3,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,12,4,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,12,5,Just amazing in photo and video quality..
B002IPHIEG,12,6,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,12,7,I didn't see the need for it.VIDEO:
B002IPHIEG,12,8,Another good Sony camera.
B002IPHIEG,12,9,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,12,10,The video quality is excellent.
B002IPHIEG,12,11,I've owned Sony's DSC-P72, W5, W7 and W300.
B002IPHIEG,12,12,The video quality is exceptional for a camera of this size as well.
B002IPHIEG,12,13,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,12,14,Oh, and the video quality is awesome as well.
B002IPHIEG,12,15,Sorry Sony.
B002IPHIEG,12,16,Sorry Sony!
B002IPHIEG,12,17,Sorry Sony.
B002IPHIEG,12,18,Sorry Sony!
B002IPHIEG,12,19,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,12,20,720p video, great audio quality.
B002IPHIEG,12,21,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,12,22,Date Stamp is done with the PMB software.HD video quality is actually better than the DMC-ZS3 AVCHD-lite.
B002IPHIEG,12,23,If you're buying it primarily for great pictures you should look at other cameras.
B002IPHIEG,12,24,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,13,0,It did this with the battery that came with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,13,1,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,13,2,battery life5.-touch
B002IPHIEG,13,3,It's been in a drawer for some time now.
B002IPHIEG,13,4,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,5,Bought the camera and just before one year, the battery cover door broke -not due to mistreating-.
B002IPHIEG,13,6,battery cover can break in one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,7,The battery door is flimsy.-Hard
B002IPHIEG,13,8,Its great if you want Non-Flash photos and are frequently turning the camera off/on in between shots.BAD- Battery Cover - The battery cover seems very flimsy and bows a bit if you hold the camera by it.
B002IPHIEG,13,9,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,13,10,It is not unusual to go through two batteries in an hour or two, even when they are fully charged.
B002IPHIEG,13,11,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,13,12,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,13,13,I used it as soon as I got the battery charged - and that, the battery, is the only thing I can say is a slight negative.
B002IPHIEG,13,14,Now the camera powers on and stays on.Unfortunately, my problems were not over.
B002IPHIEG,13,15,It didn't last long.
B002IPHIEG,13,16,Manufacturer warranty only good for one year) the camera began failing in multiple ways.I'd power the camera on and immediately a message would pop up indicating that I needed to use a compatible battery, then would power off.
B002IPHIEG,13,17,Had this camera for about a month now - its a fine camera and has the usual settings/functions as mentioned by others.
B002IPHIEG,13,18,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,13,19,Many suggested that buying a cheap knock-off battery would fix the issue, and they were absolutely correct.
B002IPHIEG,13,20,I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.
B002IPHIEG,13,21,If I had it to do over, I would not buy a camera with a touchscreen.One other thing--this thing eats batteries.
B002IPHIEG,13,22,As soon as the battery charged, I started using the camera.
B002IPHIEG,13,23,Once I finally got a battery that functioned again, I found that the shutter would no longer open/close properly.
B002IPHIEG,13,24,The SONY Cable also has Video/Audio connectors, so its a bulky cable.GOOD- Flash Setting - Unlike most Canon's I have had you can turn OFF the flash and it stays off after turning the camera off/on again.
B002IPHIEG,14,0,That screen is easy to maneuver around.
B002IPHIEG,14,1,The LCD screen is adjustable todeal with the brightness of the environment.
B002IPHIEG,14,2,The Sony "touch screen" only gets a 3 rating.
B002IPHIEG,14,3,No bevel to the LCD frame.
B002IPHIEG,14,4,It should have a viewfinder a bit hard to see in direct sunlight.
B002IPHIEG,14,5,Translated to small point and shoot cameras, it's almost impossible for an older pair of eyes to clearly see what's on a 2.7 or 3 inch LCD screen on the back of camera, even if bright sun isn't washing out the screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,6,If the camera has trouble focusing you simply touch the screen where you want it to focus and it focuses on that spot.
B002IPHIEG,14,7,But the Touch Screen drove me crazy.
B002IPHIEG,14,8,Those can pose some problems when they open when they shouldn't (like in your pocket).The large touch screen makes everything easy.
B002IPHIEG,14,9,When your shots look good on the view screen, they will be even more pleasing on a correctly calibrated HD monitor.2) The white balance options never seem to look right on the view screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,10,Quick and once you get use to the touch screen easy to use! Just took this pocket rocket to San Diego on a trip and it turned out some very good shots in low light and regular day time lighting.
B002IPHIEG,14,11,It will mar or scratch the film and possibly damage the very screen you are trying to protect!
B002IPHIEG,14,12,Durability  First day I severely scratched the screen on the metal rivet putting it in or taking it out of my jeans pocket a camera this small should be designed to be put in a pocket.3.
B002IPHIEG,14,13,The camera is all touch screen and is more of an iPod Touch feel to it.
B002IPHIEG,14,14,Most of the time with the WX1 I really can't make out what's on the screen, because to me its all out of focus (the problem is my eyes, not the camera).
B002IPHIEG,14,15,The LCD screen is bright, and high quality.. but its smaller.. and the menu system seems cluttered and annoyingly thought out.
B002IPHIEG,14,16,I sometimes dont even need to use the flash!! yes sometimes you don't need the flash at night! it's perfect for night shootings..I only wish it has a button to switch from picture shooting to video... here you have to do it through the touch screen and it needs 2 clicks to switch..by the way the touch screen works wekk..
B002IPHIEG,14,17,The only bad point I have found....is sometimes I hit the touch screen when I am taking the picture and this changes my setting.
B002IPHIEG,14,18,And then 2-3 weeks ago when I turned it on the display started "going all white" -- first in stripes and then full-screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,19,I've had a couple cameras like this and the clear plastic gets scratched quickly.
B002IPHIEG,14,20,It would come up with a choice of Delete this Picture on the left and Delete all Pictures on the right side of the screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,21,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,14,22,The big disappointmet was the bright light image quality.
B002IPHIEG,14,23,Since they are small, one goes in the left front pocket the other in the right.
B002IPHIEG,14,24,This annoyed me as iAUTO couldn't get it right all the time, and I'd miss shots of a 2yr old trying to change setting on the touch screen, which kinda sucks as it gets so dirty from oily fingers.I'm waiting for the new Canon SX210 IS - much higher zoom, likely HD as-good as SONY, wide angle lens and larger 3" screen.
B002IPHIEG,15,0,No problems encountered so far.
B002IPHIEG,15,1,This camera worked beautifully.
B002IPHIEG,15,2,Even the low light pictures don't seem to have a noise problem.
B002IPHIEG,15,3,Second, the autofocus changes haphazardly, switching from foreground to background, sometimes following movement, and preferentially focusing on light sources.
B002IPHIEG,15,4,Most of the time with the WX1 I really can't make out what's on the screen, because to me its all out of focus (the problem is my eyes, not the camera).
B002IPHIEG,15,5,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,15,6,No complaints at all!
B002IPHIEG,15,7,It also has a pet mode which is suppose to do the same thing for things that move on four legs.
B002IPHIEG,15,8,I would say, and this may be a mark against it for many people, that the WX1 is not a "point and shoot" camera unless one is familiar with its workings, but when I read the negative comments I wonder if some of the issues complained of could be addressed through a better understanding of the camera.
B002IPHIEG,15,9,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,15,10,If they're anything like me, they have a hard time reading a restaurant menu in dim light, or for that matter anything else a few feet from their face without reading glasses.
B002IPHIEG,15,11,No manual controls.The W300 had full manual controls, and I wonder why Sony couldn't have included them here and really made this a top of the line point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,15,12,There's only so much light & clarity a square centimeter of glass is going to allow.So in a nutshell:PROS24mm super wide angle lens.*Optical*
B002IPHIEG,15,13,When taking pictures in Low light without a tripod this camera absolutely kicks the ass of the canon rebel xsi (with stabilised lens).
B002IPHIEG,15,14,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,15,15,The only slow operation is changing to View mode just after taking a picture, which takes 1-2s.However, there's a big fat problem with the WX1:  manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,15,16,Parallax firmware can be utilized to overcome servo focus errors.So why is the TX1 not a 5 star camera?
B002IPHIEG,15,17,Best price for the product and delivered as promised.
B002IPHIEG,15,18,The reason it is not a point and shoot is because auto exposure is just wrong.
B002IPHIEG,15,19,Slightly better at low light but terrible with good light.
B002IPHIEG,15,20,You can also put the camera in High ISO mode, which allows for faster shutter speed.Canon's soon to be released S90 seems to have become the great new hope for shutterbugs longing for a small point and shoot that takes great low light photos instead of the WX1, primarily because it not only also has a fast lens and improved sensor, but also manual controls and raw capabilities.2.
B002IPHIEG,15,21,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,15,22,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,15,23,I replaced a Canon SD1400IS with this one, because I have two little kids, and needed a super fast focusing camera to keep from missing shots.
B002IPHIEG,15,24,Zoom is basically absent here, but I don't have a problem with it (especially for the price).
B002IPHIEG,16,0,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,16,1,Sony repaired the damage under the warranty and not cost at all.
B002IPHIEG,16,2,Great customer service.
B002IPHIEG,16,3,They suggested I contact Sony (I didn't buy the camera from them).
B002IPHIEG,16,4,They asked for US$400 to repair a tiny door.I am very disappointed for the customer support from Sony.
B002IPHIEG,16,5,And, when directed to the service website to make a repair request, that malfunctioned too.
B002IPHIEG,16,6,So of course there is no reliable way to take photos and certainly no way to review photos.I called Amazon.com this morning and the customer service representative told me I had to call Sony.I visited the Sony website, entered my information, and was given instructions to ship the camera back to Sony (at my expense) for free warranty repair (luckily it was within the 90 day window).I've owned Canon digital cameras for 7 years and never had a hardware failure in the first three months like this.
B002IPHIEG,16,7,I found the following message in Sony's online repair area: The cost to repair this unit under our Flat Rate Program is $211.00,
B002IPHIEG,16,8,Sony said they would repair the camera but that means shipping, waiting, and considerable trouble.
B002IPHIEG,16,9,I hoped I helped you in some way.
B002IPHIEG,16,10,I sent the camera to Sony covered by warranty and customer service (very kindly I must say) told me that the camera was performing under specifications and even if they replaced it with a new one it will have the same flaw, so my only options were to exchange it for a different model or live with it...I'm amazed that they are still selling this camera (that isn't exactly cheap) with this awful flaw, maybe most people won't notice it if they don't take too much close up pictures but be aware of this problem if you're considering getting this camera.
B002IPHIEG,16,11,Did anyone at Sony even take this camera out for a night before shipping it?-
B002IPHIEG,16,12,I requested for the package to be left at my door with no signature so the shipping company called me within a few minutes to ensure that he would take care of this and gave me his cell phone number in case I needed it.
B002IPHIEG,16,13,I reported the problem 32 days after buying so I was out of luck with the retailer.
B002IPHIEG,16,14,If not, make sure you check it before your 30 day return option expires
B002IPHIEG,16,15,Had High Hopes - Defective Product.
B002IPHIEG,16,16,Good camera with an awful flaw in the design that affects some pictures.
B002IPHIEG,16,17,He's picked it up a couple of times, but hasn't yet figured out how to work it...heaven help he should actually READ the manual (which I suggest).
B002IPHIEG,16,18,I love the camera, unfortunately I returned it, because it had a lot of scratches, next time I'll buy a new one.
B002IPHIEG,16,19,I was very impressed that I ordered the camera on a Saturday, it was shipped out the same day and at my house on Tuesday...great service...thank you!!!
B002IPHIEG,16,20,The Sony "touch screen" only gets a 3 rating.
B002IPHIEG,16,21,The other reviews cover that pretty well so I'll keep it brief.After only 1 month the shutter stopped closing completely, and the repair process is no fun at all.It's been LESS THAN 2 MONTHS since I bought this camera and there is already dust trapped INSIDE the lens, so many of my pictures have visible spots all over them.Sony's customer service is far from good compared to other companies I've worked with.
B002IPHIEG,16,22,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.
B002IPHIEG,16,23,Google Picasa will import the movies along with the pictures in one seamless transfer.The Sony requires some switching on the touch screen to get to the movie mode.
B002IPHIEG,16,24,So why am I reviewing a camera that seems like a downgrade?Well Sony is using a new lens system called the "Exmor R".
B002IPHIEG,17,0,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,17,1,settings adjustments for color hues, saturation.-No
B002IPHIEG,17,2,This one is always blurry, nomatter the mode.
B002IPHIEG,17,3,They looked better if I manually set the ISO, but if I'm just pulling it out for a quick shot, i don't want to have to remember to go to manual settings all the time.
B002IPHIEG,17,4,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,17,5,I highly recommend taking picture in the P mode with white balance set to flash.
B002IPHIEG,17,6,The reason it is not a point and shoot is because auto exposure is just wrong.
B002IPHIEG,17,7,Switching to any other mode defaults the settings to the terrible AUTO everything requiring the photographer to reset all those undesirable Sony auto settings.
B002IPHIEG,17,8,I know I can always get into manual modes to compensate for things, but I wanted something I didn't always have to do that with.
B002IPHIEG,17,9,You may need to set the EV to -.3=>-.7 for less contrasty scenes.
B002IPHIEG,17,10,When setting on "P" mode I found out that switching the White Balance from "Auto" or "Daylight" to "Flash" in improves outdoor photos color, tone, exposure and warmness.
B002IPHIEG,17,11,Controls are laid out sensibly, and it's easy to switch from automated settings to finer image control.One of the coolest new features is Panorama mode, which makes ultra-wide photos quickly and easily.
B002IPHIEG,17,12,You might also want to try different White Balances,setting correctly results in really nice low light shots.Outdoor shots:This camera in iSCN mode seems to keep the lens all the way open(F2.4)and it adjusts the shutter speed(a big No No)resulting in washed out over exposed photos(yuck).The solution: switch to "P" Mode which closes down the lens to around a nice F5.0 to F7.1(much better) and switch the White Balance to "Flash" .
B002IPHIEG,17,13,However, did you ever try looking at "no flash" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode?
B002IPHIEG,17,14,The two florescent settings are just goofy.
B002IPHIEG,17,15,You have to switch the camera to Handheld Twilight mode and adjust the Exposure Value(EV) from -0.3 to -1.7(this is a very important setting that needs to be set on order to remove the noisyness and grain from the photo, a setting people don't adjust and then complain about how bad the photo looks in low light).
B002IPHIEG,17,16,Macro mode is indescribably bad.
B002IPHIEG,17,17,This camera has the ability to zoom while recording which is something that I have not been able to do in my past Sony point n' shoots.
B002IPHIEG,17,18,Subject was four feet away, but the camera focused almost 6 feet away.
B002IPHIEG,17,19,It's been in a drawer for some time now.
B002IPHIEG,17,20,Beware of moving objects.The low light modes are great for stationary objects, but in some of the shots I took where people were walking they blurred.With the camera set in Program mode I ran after the dogs and couldn't get a single shot that wasn't too blurred to be any good, except when I had it in burst mode.
B002IPHIEG,17,21,I purchased this camera for the Panorama mode, and low light shooting.
B002IPHIEG,17,22,And, that is to say nothing about it being able to capture HD quality video as well and panorama mode for wide still shoots!
B002IPHIEG,17,23,It's pretty good, WITH THE RIGHT SETTINGS.
B002IPHIEG,17,24,Also for better exposure you can again adjust the EV.Panorama Shots: This one's tricky, from where you press the shutter to start the panorama it locks the exposure at that point.
B002IPHIEG,18,0,4) Reviewing photos after a shot ... is too slow.
B002IPHIEG,18,1,Instead it takes ... 3 to 5 seconds because you have to wait for the current photo to be processed and then wait wait wait to press the review button and if you press it twice ... oops, your still in picture-taking mode.
B002IPHIEG,18,2,I want a camera that I don't know is there, that I can whip out in 2 seconds to snap off a shot.
B002IPHIEG,18,3,3) Most importantly for me, the shutter does not click fast enough.
B002IPHIEG,18,4,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.
B002IPHIEG,18,5,I know that folks will say that I must have pressed the wrong button, and that might be so at times.
B002IPHIEG,18,6,Taking pictures with this camera is so much fun.Because it is so thin and light, pressing the shutter release button without adding shake to the shot takes a very steady hand.
B002IPHIEG,18,7,Being an SLR user, I am used to instant reaction speed between the moment I press the button and the moment the shutter clicks.
B002IPHIEG,18,8,I rather prefer to use the 2-second timer, which gives me just enough time after pressing the button to steady up the focus frame on my subject.
B002IPHIEG,18,9,Surely, the last photo can be put into a memory buffer to immediately be shown when the review button is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,18,10,Whenever I took action shots or shots of kids or pets with the W170, the pictures would always come out blurry.
B002IPHIEG,18,11,I sometimes dont even need to use the flash!! yes sometimes you don't need the flash at night! it's perfect for night shootings..I only wish it has a button to switch from picture shooting to video... here you have to do it through the touch screen and it needs 2 clicks to switch..by the way the touch screen works wekk..
B002IPHIEG,18,12,It controls everything but the zoom, shutter, and on/off switch, but it's quick enough where I never found myself wishing for more physical buttons.
B002IPHIEG,18,13,I would buy it again.I would ask SONY to change a few things: 1) The power and shutter buttons are too flush and difficult to feel in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,18,14,Someone else said that they had no problem shooting at higher speeds in that setting.
B002IPHIEG,18,15,When taking shutter speed it takes a while to recording and process it to save it and show up on camera.
B002IPHIEG,18,16,While continuing to hold the desired meter settings with shutter button slightly depressed move (aim) the camera to your subject then shoot.
B002IPHIEG,18,17,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,18,18,On the other hand a recent review of the upcoming S90 indicated that even with a fast lens and manual controls (allowing you to set the shutter) it wasn't fast enough for action, sports and kids.
B002IPHIEG,18,19,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,18,20,For example: FOUR button pushes to delete a shot you just took.Sadly, I won't be keeping this thing.
B002IPHIEG,18,21,Every shot is clear with no blurriness.
B002IPHIEG,18,22,You can fix this by using the slow-synchro flash setting and by standing back further from your subject, but it takes some experimentation to learn to use it well.
B002IPHIEG,18,23,So much movement occurs by the subject in the 1 to 4 seconds (depending on lighting) it takes the shutter to click on this Cybershot.
B002IPHIEG,18,24,I do a lot of shooting under pressure.
B002IPHIEG,19,0,With the card (which does not come included) and the camera, it runs up to $450.
B002IPHIEG,19,1,I haven't transferred them to the computer, but I don't show my pictures on my computer.
B002IPHIEG,19,2,Newer models can use either a Sony card or SD card.
B002IPHIEG,19,3,I am also annoyed that you have to purchase Sony's licensed memory card.
B002IPHIEG,19,4,Since my other cameras have been Sony cameras, I have already had memory stick cards and readers, so to me, its not a big deal.
B002IPHIEG,19,5,This model has to have Sony card.
B002IPHIEG,19,6,It's annoying that it only takes the proprietary (and expensive) Sony memory stick instead of the usual SD card that all my other cameras have used, but that's not too big a deal.
B002IPHIEG,19,7,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,19,8,The only problem with it is you NEED to by a memory card, otherwise you can only store a couple of images on the camera's internal memory.
B002IPHIEG,19,9,Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.
B002IPHIEG,19,10,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.
B002IPHIEG,19,11,There are some quirks with this camera which I wanted to point out.GOOD- Photo Quality - Others cover this so I wont go into it, but basically the photos are very good.BAD- Sony USB Cable - This is proprietary SONY cable, so you have to carry it around with you if you want to download photos from the directly from the camera without removing the Memory Stick.
B002IPHIEG,19,12,The biggest problem I've had is the USB connection - the plug on the camera end has always seemed a little wobbly and unstable, and over time it stopped connecting at all.
B002IPHIEG,19,13,Internal Memory.
B002IPHIEG,19,14,Tell me what will you do when you want to move pictures from your camera to your computer on the fly, you will need the 10 meter long 10 plug Sony proprietary cable, how about taking the memory card out, oh, that's another proprietary memory stick duo, now how to charge it?
B002IPHIEG,19,15,My only negative is it didn't have a Memory Stick included.The battery doesn't last as long as the T100.
B002IPHIEG,19,16,Interface to computer - dedicated cable I have to bring with me on vacation, or a usb sd card reader?
B002IPHIEG,19,17,Incidentally, the newest duo "pro" cards are not compatible with some older readers even if they accommodate Sony cards.... go figure.4)
B002IPHIEG,19,18,But, if you take movies you have to locate the subdirectory on the memory card and access that directly.
B002IPHIEG,19,19,I had high hopes for this Sony, and even went to the trouble of buying a 16GB Memory Stick Duo (hate their proprietary attitude) and an extra battery.
B002IPHIEG,19,20,If you have had other cameras that used SD, just think of making a $20 investment into a very reliable, fast card for your camera, and use the SD card in your Wii.The only two complaints I have for this camera are it's low light picture taking, and the format it uses when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,19,21,The only thing is that it is not supplied with a HDMI cable as standard..........
B002IPHIEG,19,22,The memory stick duo is what Sony uses; save to an external hard drive (you're going to need one either for the quantity of VGA photos or the memory required to store all your 10.2 megapixel treasures) and re-use to bring down your expenses if the price differential with other media is such a big factor.
B002IPHIEG,19,23,The SONY Cable also has Video/Audio connectors, so its a bulky cable.GOOD- Flash Setting - Unlike most Canon's I have had you can turn OFF the flash and it stays off after turning the camera off/on again.
B002IPHIEG,19,24,Its NOT one of those universal mini-USB/USB cables like you can use on Canons.
B002IPHIEG,20,0,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,20,1,My last four digital cameras were all Canon, and i was happy with them.
B002IPHIEG,20,2,The Camera That Stole Me Away From Canon!
B002IPHIEG,20,3,Our last camera was a canon Powershot S2 IS.
B002IPHIEG,20,4,I am replacing a Cannon with only 3.1 megapixels and this is somuch better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,20,5,I purchased this camera because I wanted something to replace my Sony DSC-W300.
B002IPHIEG,20,6,Our 5 year old camera shoots pictures that are much better and sharp.
B002IPHIEG,20,7,Having faith and loyalty in the Canon brand (this was our 4th Canon Camera purchase, two of which were Canon AE-1s given as gifts) I contacted Canon and was sorely disappointed.
B002IPHIEG,20,8,I'm strictly point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,20,9,Sony DSC-WX1 , A disappointing Camera.
B002IPHIEG,20,10,I bought the TX1 after using a borrowed one and comparing it to Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, and the newest compact Sonys: TX100, TX7, T110.
B002IPHIEG,20,11,nothing better.
B002IPHIEG,20,12,I wonder if point and shoot cameras like this one could do better.
B002IPHIEG,20,13,My 5 year old Sony that finally broke was 7 mp and had much better still image quality.
B002IPHIEG,20,14,I bought this camera to replace my Sony T90 point and shoot when it finally died.
B002IPHIEG,20,15,I purchased this camera after trying and returning the Canon PowerShot SD1300IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Blue).
B002IPHIEG,20,16,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).
B002IPHIEG,20,17,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,20,18,That being said, I think the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W290 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization (Dark Blue) would be just fine as well for my needs.If SONY would only stop with the SONY-only cables/cards this would be a much better camera!
B002IPHIEG,20,19,I bought this camera as a replacement for an older version of Sony Cybershot.
B002IPHIEG,20,20,We have had many Sony cyber shot cameras over the past 3 years.
B002IPHIEG,20,21,Better in some aspects than a canon Rebel Xsi.
B002IPHIEG,20,22,not much better than my seven year old Sony DSC-T30.
B002IPHIEG,20,23,I was looking at this last month when it was announced, and had decided I was going to go with the forthcoming 980 from Canon.
B002IPHIEG,20,24,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,21,0,Dust trapped inside lens, again!
B002IPHIEG,21,1,Many of my pictures have spots in them even though I do clean the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,2,The ONLY thing that I do not like is having to open the lens cover to take photos...but in the end this will protect the lens, because I dropped two of my Canons and messed up the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,3,It is so much better than the cameras that have the protruding lens that extends when open.
B002IPHIEG,21,4,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,5,The previous Sony Cybershot I had also had dust trapped inside the lens also, and it gradually kept accumulating over the past year until I had to abandon it and get this one.
B002IPHIEG,21,6,The only problem I have had is with dust backscatter.
B002IPHIEG,21,7,Light and small for the lens range.3)
B002IPHIEG,21,8,Great even in low lighted area.The bad side: The rocker/toggle switch used to zooming in and out the lens is fragile!
B002IPHIEG,21,9,There are many problems with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,21,10,Taking a picture with the camera turned sideways to better frame a specific shot shows a lot of distortion from the wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,11,The placement of the lens allows for others to touch or cover the lens with their fingers if they are taking a picture for you.
B002IPHIEG,21,12,Another great feature is the lens cover that acts as an on/off switch.
B002IPHIEG,21,13,Only problem that I can see is that the thing has the odd habit of turning on while in your pocket, which opens and expands the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,14,As a former owner of a Sony A700 with 16-80mm Carl z lenses, plus a whole bag of long range lenses.
B002IPHIEG,21,15,There is always a shadow in the lower left corner of the pictures (because of very short distance between flash and lens).2.
B002IPHIEG,21,16,I believe this is due to the flash being close to the lens.In summary, DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA.
B002IPHIEG,21,17,There are many problems however:1.
B002IPHIEG,21,18,I was advised that this is a technical problem caused by the flash being to close to the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,19,I place my thumb along the bottom edge right where the battery cover it and there is no lip to keep your thumb from sliding the door open.
B002IPHIEG,21,20,If you take a picture with flash at 24mm, what is a really common use I have to say, it gets a black spot in the lower left corner.
B002IPHIEG,21,21,Flash does not cover the lower left corner when shooting at the widest angle possible, leaving a dark area.--
B002IPHIEG,21,22,Very small (fits in a pocket) and very easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,21,23,Battery door easily opened.
B002IPHIEG,21,24,Only minor complaint is that the lens is located very near where you hold the camera (upper right-hand corner) so you have to be careful not to take a picture of your thumb or finger -- have done that a few times :).
B002IPHIEG,22,0,A grainy photo is better than no photo at all.
B002IPHIEG,22,1,Slightly better at low light but terrible with good light.
B002IPHIEG,22,2,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,22,3,It is a lot better with the picture quality especially in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,4,It's better in low light but still very grainy, however it's worse in good bright light.
B002IPHIEG,22,5,Yes, you are slightly more likely to get a better photo in the dark if you really need to take photos in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,22,6,Better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,7,Good night shots.240-degree
B002IPHIEG,22,8,Also, many of my pictures that I have taken have been blurry, pixelated, and of poor quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,9,It takes very clear photos in day light and at night time or low light conditions.
B002IPHIEG,22,10,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,22,11,It is excellent in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,12,Low light pictures are blurry and pixelated.
B002IPHIEG,22,13,nothing better.
B002IPHIEG,22,14,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,22,15,Works well in most lighting conditions with/without flash.
B002IPHIEG,22,16,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,22,17,Even the low light pictures don't seem to have a noise problem.
B002IPHIEG,22,18,Still image and print quality are very important to me.
B002IPHIEG,22,19,Takes great (not perfect) pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,20,The low light pictures were much better then any other camera I have owned.
B002IPHIEG,22,21,Image quality was not what I expected.
B002IPHIEG,22,22,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,23,Besides the obvious use as seen in the ads, it works extraordinarily well in low light, and even outdoors at dusk.
B002IPHIEG,22,24,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,23,0,don't buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,1,I returned it in the next day I received.
B002IPHIEG,23,2,Purchased in May 2011.
B002IPHIEG,23,3,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).
B002IPHIEG,23,4,Do not buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,5,Having faith and loyalty in the Canon brand (this was our 4th Canon Camera purchase, two of which were Canon AE-1s given as gifts) I contacted Canon and was sorely disappointed.
B002IPHIEG,23,6,DSC-WX1b - I purchased this camera for 2 reasons.
B002IPHIEG,23,7,Please save your money and time - look elsewhere.
B002IPHIEG,23,8,I bought one about 2 months ago and have been using it a lot.
B002IPHIEG,23,9,I am going to see if Sony wiill repair or replace them but right now it feels that $329 x 2 was too much to spend for less than two years use.
B002IPHIEG,23,10,I had a bought a Sony DSC-T3 a few years ago, wanting it so bad I imported one from Japan!
B002IPHIEG,23,11,I now need to buy a new camera for an upcoming trip, and I can assure you it will not be a Sony.Hope this helps,Damian
B002IPHIEG,23,12,I bought two of the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX1/P camera within months of one another the first from Amazon on 12-17-2009.
B002IPHIEG,23,13,While waiting to get the camera, I would check Amazon every day to see if anyone who had actually used the camera had put up any reviews yet.
B002IPHIEG,23,14,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,23,15,I truly believe you'll be very happy if you decide to purchase this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,16,This was my main reason for purchase, and it failed my test.2)
B002IPHIEG,23,17,I've owned Sony cameras for years and would never look at another brand of camera, until now.
B002IPHIEG,23,18,I purchased this camera because I wanted something to replace my Sony DSC-W300.
B002IPHIEG,23,19,You have to package the camera yourself and ship it to Texas for several weeks with no replacement in the interim.
B002IPHIEG,23,20,Sony DSC-WX1 , A disappointing Camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,21,Quick focusThe bad:1) The only reason I returned it was the biggest.
B002IPHIEG,23,22,With the first 100 pictures of my trip gone I decided I didn't want to be stressed out every time I ask someone to take a picture of us, not to mention the stress of keeping myself from doing it.
B002IPHIEG,23,23,I did purchase this camera elsewhere.
B002IPHIEG,23,24,Had High Hopes - Defective Product.
B002IPHIEG,24,0,Basically you don't have any manual controls at all.
B002IPHIEG,24,1,I figured out most of the settings without even reading the instructions.
B002IPHIEG,24,2,He's picked it up a couple of times, but hasn't yet figured out how to work it...heaven help he should actually READ the manual (which I suggest).
B002IPHIEG,24,3,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,24,4,When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked.
B002IPHIEG,24,5,How is that possible?! (for the answer, see the next line item)- No manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,24,6,Most were the work of apparently accomplished photographers.
B002IPHIEG,24,7,Still, this camera seems to me to have a lot of functionality that makes it worth the time learning how to use it properly.
B002IPHIEG,24,8,Take time to read and understand the instruction manual!Be sure and buy an xtra battery as the camera will gobble up the available "juice" while shooting.
B002IPHIEG,24,9,First, it is all too easy while shooting to accidently change the settings and all too difficult to get back to what I want--after I realize what's happened.
B002IPHIEG,24,10,The only slow operation is changing to View mode just after taking a picture, which takes 1-2s.However, there's a big fat problem with the WX1:  manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,24,11,The only reason I rated the picture quality 4/5 is because I am still trying to learn and figure out all of the different settings.............I just havn't had the time!
B002IPHIEG,24,12,Accordingly, before using the WX1, I downloaded and read the manuals in their entirety, trying to familiarize myself with the camera's resources (of which there are quite a few and limits (of which there are also quite a few).
B002IPHIEG,24,13,I'm somewhat puzzled after reading several of the poor reviews for this camera.
B002IPHIEG,24,14,I had never done this before, and while it was a HUGE learning curve, I learned what this little stick of dynomite camera can and cannot do.
B002IPHIEG,24,15,Third, when trying to get back to the settings I want in the middle of a photo opp, it can be confusing trying to find the right screen.Fourth (and worst), the image size seems to change without my actually choosing it.
B002IPHIEG,24,16,It works, but you need to have nimble fingers and if you've used an iPhone/iPod you'll be disappointed in Sony.
B002IPHIEG,24,17,Many serious amateur photographers who would otherwise love this camera won't even consider it because it doesn't allow them the ability to manually control aperture, shutter speed, etc.
B002IPHIEG,24,18,It is also intuitive and easy to use the advanced functions without much of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,24,19,I still haven't figured out how best to use the WX1, but I learned for, example, that turning the DRO on or off made a substantial difference in IQ, as did learning the idiosyncracies of the white balance and the various settings that were automatically set in the various camera modes.
B002IPHIEG,24,20,First, was to help a friend photograph a wedding.
B002IPHIEG,24,21,They looked better if I manually set the ISO, but if I'm just pulling it out for a quick shot, i don't want to have to remember to go to manual settings all the time.
B002IPHIEG,24,22,Someone else said that they had no problem shooting at higher speeds in that setting.
B002IPHIEG,24,23,I'm sure they'll improve this in the future though.To load the Sony "still" pictures into Picasa is an easy process.
B002IPHIEG,24,24,This, along with the lack of RAW capabilities, will probably keep this camera from competing with the Panasonic LX3 and upcoming Canon S90.As note above, there is a limited work around.
B002IPHIEG,25,0,Video is usually okay, but has two major problems... First, the noise of zooming in and out is recorded very loudly.
B002IPHIEG,25,1,With that, I will clear up problems previous owners have had.First, I'm sure all of you want to know how good the new Exmor R sensor is.
B002IPHIEG,25,2,It seems all my video files are HUGE.
B002IPHIEG,25,3,I need to educate myself on this...being able to edit and play with the HD video files.
B002IPHIEG,25,4,don't buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,5,Just for the record, I never experienced such a problem neither with my T100 nor with my Sony HDR-SR7 camcorder.
B002IPHIEG,25,6,I did some research and found that I was FAR from the only one experiencing this issue.
B002IPHIEG,25,7,So check, check, and check!
B002IPHIEG,25,8,I dont know if its my camera but this camera kinda sucks at recording, becuz whenever i record it makes a sound in the background recording and its really annoying.
B002IPHIEG,25,9,In the end the video capability might be too advanced for me and I had to return it in lieu of basic video functions.
B002IPHIEG,25,10,I've always been a sony camera guy, but this camera has a really big issue that I couldn't believe that it was real when I start testing the camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,11,VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE: Great Camera!
B002IPHIEG,25,12,With video recording, I was very happy to finally be able to zoom in and out while recording, however, I am not happy that it records in mp4 format.
B002IPHIEG,25,13,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,25,14,The panoramic pictures were awesome, and the video was very clean (both picture and audio).
B002IPHIEG,25,15,About all it can't do is pinch-zoom, and I'm guessing that's more of a patent issue than anything else.
B002IPHIEG,25,16,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,25,17,Recording HD movie were also disappointing, when you are recording you can actually hear sound of zooming and focusing when you play them back.
B002IPHIEG,25,18,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!
B002IPHIEG,25,19,It can't shoot RAW files, only .jpg and movie files, although I plan to experiment with the DRO mode that might prevent highlights from looking clipped in some cases.
B002IPHIEG,25,20,I now need to buy a new camera for an upcoming trip, and I can assure you it will not be a Sony.Hope this helps,Damian
B002IPHIEG,25,21,I purchased this camera because I wanted something to replace my Sony DSC-W300.
B002IPHIEG,25,22,But once I started taking video I immediately uncovered the first and the major problem, which became a deal-breaker - it's lens produces very loud mechanical noise when you're doing zoom in or out.When you apply zoom it sounds like you're starting an aged truck in cold weather.
B002IPHIEG,25,23,I never had a problem with blurriness or noise in my pictures.
B002IPHIEG,25,24,The zooming noise from ZR1 can hardly be noticed on the footage as well.
B00DMS0LCO,0,0,I have been using this camera during a couple of days and i can say only good things about it.
B00DMS0LCO,0,1,Very good quality pictures
B00DMS0LCO,0,2,But overall, it seemed like a nice lens and shoots nice pictures.BATTERY LIFEWithout WiFi the battery life is quite good.
B00DMS0LCO,0,3,I've never considered myself a serious videographer, but this camera could change that.Battery Life: Battery life seems very good and I am still working off the same charge from when I pulled the camera out of the box about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,0,4,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,0,5,wanted to let people know that I am getting about 950 photo's and about 25 minutes of video per battery charge.
B00DMS0LCO,0,6,The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good.
B00DMS0LCO,0,7,I purchased two off-brand batteries as backups to the Canon battery, and I've never been left stranded yet and I use the WiFi a lot.SUMMARYOverall this is a great camera and I highly recommend it!
B00DMS0LCO,0,8,Battery life is almost twice than the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,0,9,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,0,10,I put the dead battery that came with the camera on the charger and left it to charge thinking nothing of it.4
B00DMS0LCO,0,11,I may consider a battery grip for this camera and have owned a couple of Canon battery grips with previous Canons.
B00DMS0LCO,0,12,However, to me this has never been an issue since I ALWAYS carry a spare battery.
B00DMS0LCO,0,13,Battery life is great with the wi-fi turned off.
B00DMS0LCO,0,14,I added the grip, a couple of batteries and gone to shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,0,15,I could probably do an entire day of shooting with the WiFi off without changing batteries.
B00DMS0LCO,0,16,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,0,17,Once more I know that I have a very good camera.
B00DMS0LCO,0,18,I've spent the last three weeks photographing pretty much everything and all the shots make me look like I'm actually a decent photographer.
B00DMS0LCO,0,19,the battery charger charge TWO batteries fast at the same time?I'd consider a full frame version, if the cons are fix.for
B00DMS0LCO,0,20,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,0,21,I am not using Wi-Fi right now.3-9-2014went to the NUCLEAR COWBOYZ show and shot over 45 minutes of video and about 150 stills.
B00DMS0LCO,0,22,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,0,23,However, as long as you have a backup along, you'll be fine.
B00DMS0LCO,0,24,With WiFi on (especially when the camera is acting as the access point), the battery goes pretty quickly.
B00DMS0LCO,1,0,Oh, and same thing with the touch screen.
B00DMS0LCO,1,1,The camera also has a good grip and the detachable lcd screen is a nice to have feature
B00DMS0LCO,1,2,Love the flip out rear touch screen LCD.
B00DMS0LCO,1,3,I love this camera so much, takes amazing photos, touch screen, Wifi, I love it.
B00DMS0LCO,1,4,Nice camera.
B00DMS0LCO,1,5,Oh, and by the way, the screen is touch controlled.
B00DMS0LCO,1,6,Touch flip screen.
B00DMS0LCO,1,7,The 70D is so easy to use and change settings with, thanks to the capacitive touch screen which is just like the touch screen on a nice smartphone.
B00DMS0LCO,1,8,A big plus is that you can touch the LCD to type in passwords, etc.
B00DMS0LCO,1,9,I find that getting used to the touch screen may take some time & again I worry a tad about the durability of a screen that can be rotated six ways from Sunday, but the controls are all in the right places & the menus on the touch screen make sense and are easy to get through.
B00DMS0LCO,1,10,The icing on the cake is the Touch Screen with multi-touch operation, as well as Touch AF! Excellent!
B00DMS0LCO,1,11,Very good camera.
B00DMS0LCO,1,12,I love the touch screen.Cons:- Plastic body.-
B00DMS0LCO,1,13,The still photos can't be touched.
B00DMS0LCO,1,14,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,1,15,Anyway, the fold-out display is a great feature, and it also folds face-in to protect the display when not in use.The ability to touch various points on the LCD display while in Live View or shooting video, and shift focus while shooting is - to me at least - worth the price of admission.
B00DMS0LCO,1,16,However, I've been surprised to find that the thing I like best about this camera is it's ease of use, particularly Canon's implementation of the LCD monitor touch screen.
B00DMS0LCO,1,17,I  am not a big fan of touch screen operation because the screen gets smudged in a hurry, being anal retentive/ a clean freak this gets annoying to me but I will make the best of it.*
B00DMS0LCO,1,18,They all work great on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,1,19,Also lie the wireless feature and the tilt screen.
B00DMS0LCO,1,20,The big deal is the addition of touch screen ability.
B00DMS0LCO,1,21,The color and gamma are about perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,1,22,Responsiveness is just as good as on my iPod Touch.-
B00DMS0LCO,1,23,Great product.
B00DMS0LCO,1,24,No LCD tilt or touch.
B00DMS0LCO,2,0,I upgraded from a Canon Rebel to the 70d.
B00DMS0LCO,2,1,Upgraded from a Canon Rebel XS.
B00DMS0LCO,2,2,This review is coming from someone upgrading from a Canon Kiss X4 (T2i/550D).
B00DMS0LCO,2,3,I had a Canon Rebel T3 and was looking to upgrade my camera.
B00DMS0LCO,2,4,This is the best camera except for my Canon Mark5II
B00DMS0LCO,2,5,The Canon EOS 70D borrows many features from the Canon lineup.
B00DMS0LCO,2,6,I went the Canon DSLR route due to looking at astrophotography.
B00DMS0LCO,2,7,I have several Canon Cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,2,8,What an upgrade...
B00DMS0LCO,2,9,Keep it in context and the 70D is the best all around camera Canon has ever made by far.
B00DMS0LCO,2,10,Best Canon I've Used So Far.
B00DMS0LCO,2,11,70D What a great camera!
B00DMS0LCO,2,12,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,2,13,I love the new Canon EOS 70D!
B00DMS0LCO,2,14,Nice upgrade from my Rebel T1i.
B00DMS0LCO,2,15,For a $1200 camera it should have a full frame senor.Their still not there yet.
B00DMS0LCO,2,16,Upgraded from a Rebel T2i to 70D - Very pleased.
B00DMS0LCO,2,17,I purchased this camera as an upgrade from the Canon EOS Rebel XTi that I've had for the past several years.
B00DMS0LCO,2,18,Great camera - much better than the rebel series that I have been using for years.
B00DMS0LCO,2,19,Great upgrade!
B00DMS0LCO,2,20,I just upgraded from my Canon EOS 50D to this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,2,21,Previous body was a XSi Rebel and have been looking to upgrade for the past year.
B00DMS0LCO,2,22,If you do not HAVE to have a full frame DSLR, this is the best Canon APS-C DSLR ever.
B00DMS0LCO,2,23,I love the autofocus on video.
B00DMS0LCO,2,24,I'd recommend it to someone who is looking for a nice upgrade, for sure!!
B00DMS0LCO,3,0,Great camera!
B00DMS0LCO,3,1,Very good quality pictures
B00DMS0LCO,3,2,Too good for me.
B00DMS0LCO,3,3,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,3,4,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,3,5,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,3,6,Great Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,3,7,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,3,8,I haven't edited any of the video, so I do no know if the lens sounds show up on the video.
B00DMS0LCO,3,9,No GPS -- otherwise great.
B00DMS0LCO,3,10,This is what i want it's easy to connect to my smartphone.
B00DMS0LCO,3,11,Once you've connected your phone to the camera's hotspot you just launch the Canon app.
B00DMS0LCO,3,12,The Wi-Fi feature is great for sending photo to your phone or tablet or email or sharing on social media sites but it needs to be disabled manually for movie shooting and USB connection which is very annoying.
B00DMS0LCO,3,13,Great Camera!
B00DMS0LCO,3,14,Built in Wifi allows sharing photos with smartphones and you can also use the smartphone as a remote.
B00DMS0LCO,3,15,The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good.
B00DMS0LCO,3,16,It's nice to be able to shoot a photo and transfer it directly to my iPhone to edit and share!
B00DMS0LCO,3,17,I wish I could have taken part in early reviews of this system so I could have been working with these awesome features.
B00DMS0LCO,3,18,This feature is so cool!
B00DMS0LCO,3,19,Battery life is great with the wi-fi turned off.
B00DMS0LCO,3,20,Continuous Focus Video Works Great even with non-STM lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,3,21,This is a great feature because you don't have to buy a dedicated shutter release.Canon was super smart about how they implemented this wireless connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,3,22,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,3,23,The sound was good (though one can purchase a wireless microphone for better sound), and the video quality was out of this world.The only real complaint I have with this camera is that it seems challenged by scenes with highly differing contrasts.
B00DMS0LCO,3,24,The quality and que materials is so good, meets the specifications of the website and sending fulfilled in time.
B00DMS0LCO,4,0,Auto focus is great, manual focus is great.
B00DMS0LCO,4,1,Hence in low light, in LV mode the camera will not focus at all!
B00DMS0LCO,4,2,Excellent Camera with Great Features.
B00DMS0LCO,4,3,In LV mode, when you are switching between still photo shooting modes using mode dial, LV switches off which is somewhat annoying.8.
B00DMS0LCO,4,4,Lastly, I think it would be really convenient, if in VF mode, when you are switching shooting modes using mode dial, the LV panel could automatically show the information about that shooting mode.
B00DMS0LCO,4,5,It also works perfectly while shooting videos where the focus changes during the shot.
B00DMS0LCO,4,6,Continuous Focus Video Works Great even with non-STM lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,4,7,Also, I've had a lot more in focus shots, the focusing system is leaps and bounds what I was used to.
B00DMS0LCO,4,8,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,4,9,I have had a DSLR previously, but always kept it in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,4,10,This means continuous shoot is not useable in LV mode!
B00DMS0LCO,4,11,The video and shooting autofocus work great although I have had a few times where it would not autofocus on something usually in really low light conditions.
B00DMS0LCO,4,12,You can use manual focus if you need more control.
B00DMS0LCO,4,13,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,4,14,However, it's still very good.
B00DMS0LCO,4,15,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,4,16,I did not think I would like the touch screen but it turns out I use it most of the time to adjust my settings.
B00DMS0LCO,4,17,The camera is quick to focus, acquires moving subjects and allows for great photo's.
B00DMS0LCO,4,18,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,4,19,I'm just an amature that likes shooting video and pictures.
B00DMS0LCO,4,20,This is an excellent camera and provides all the features I need such as HDR and High Speed shots.
B00DMS0LCO,4,21,The touch screen is the best feature Canon added to this camera; simply swipe through photos, pinch to zoom... Setting changes are so quick and easy.
B00DMS0LCO,4,22,Great image quality & amazing autofocus!
B00DMS0LCO,4,23,You can either have it auto-focus and track faces (works well if the face isn't moving too fast), AF zone mode (meaning you choose a certain zone of the screen and the camera focuses on whatever moves into that zone), or just touch a point on the screen and the camera will focus to it until you touch somewhere else.-Viewfinder:
B00DMS0LCO,4,24,The 19 cross-type AF points is more than what I need but there is no way to select the AF points in Basic modes (A+, No Flash, CA) when using VF.
B00DMS0LCO,5,0,Great high speed shutter for kids' sports.
B00DMS0LCO,5,1,Great high speed shutter for my kids' sporting events.
B00DMS0LCO,5,2,the other feature that is very nice to me is the 7 frames per second, having both cameras that is sometimes the difference between getting and missing a good shot.
B00DMS0LCO,5,3,Extremely fast focusing speed.
B00DMS0LCO,5,4,The range of the ISO and the shutter speed is great and the difference it makes in the picture quality is amazing!
B00DMS0LCO,5,5,Extremely fast shutter action, quiet, 7+ snaps per second.
B00DMS0LCO,5,6,I used 3200 ISO with a 60-80 shutter speed to get the exposure right and came away with some great baby shots.
B00DMS0LCO,5,7,Most of the stills were at ISO 6400-12800 and shot in sport mode for high speed.
B00DMS0LCO,5,8,I really liked it as there was no shutter lag and burst speeds help get the action.
B00DMS0LCO,5,9,Looks and feels great.
B00DMS0LCO,5,10,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,5,11,Autofocus and a good lens and you're be making amazing movies in no time
B00DMS0LCO,5,12,Excellent Camera with Great Features.
B00DMS0LCO,5,13,The camera has a good feel to it and although it is a bit heavier that previous camera I've owned it still feels good in my hands.
B00DMS0LCO,5,14,Great and fast auto focus.
B00DMS0LCO,5,15,The camera is quick to focus, acquires moving subjects and allows for great photo's.
B00DMS0LCO,5,16,The video and shooting autofocus work great although I have had a few times where it would not autofocus on something usually in really low light conditions.
B00DMS0LCO,5,17,This is an excellent camera and provides all the features I need such as HDR and High Speed shots.
B00DMS0LCO,5,18,All of which I am enjoying every time I use this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,5,19,The shutter speed and FPS work great so that I can freeze the birds midflight and get tack sharp photos too.
B00DMS0LCO,5,20,It makes for a fast AF and cleaner photo's.
B00DMS0LCO,5,21,A nice fast frames per second shooting speed and a large enough buffer make shooting lots of pictures very quickly in RAW a breeze, and thus far the camera has performed very well in low light conditions.
B00DMS0LCO,5,22,The speed of the 70D is also very fast.
B00DMS0LCO,5,23,Moving up from my old T1i was the best move for me.
B00DMS0LCO,5,24,LOVE IT.
B00DMS0LCO,6,0,This camera has won me over and it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,6,1,When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't.
B00DMS0LCO,6,2,In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card.
B00DMS0LCO,6,3,If you can find it, buy it!
B00DMS0LCO,6,4,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,6,5,Dual SD cards.
B00DMS0LCO,6,6,I have also used the WiFi to transfer photos to my computer, but its pretty slow, so I usually just use the USB cable instead.-Drive
B00DMS0LCO,6,7,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,6,8,A 32GB SD card is good for about 45 minutes with ALL-I compression and two hours with IPB.
B00DMS0LCO,6,9,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,6,10,one card slot.
B00DMS0LCO,6,11,when I bought this camera, I was scared to buy something I thought I was maybe overspending on a product I would not need.
B00DMS0LCO,6,12,Modes:  The camera has a lot of great drive modes, including a burst-mode of 7 per second.
B00DMS0LCO,6,13,In one-shot mode, this difference is invisible; very fast cards would only make sense if you were time-limited on card-to-computer transfers with a USB 3.0, SATA, or Firewire card reader.IN SUM:This is the most significant DSLR Canon has introduced since the 7D.
B00DMS0LCO,6,14,All in all, very satisfied with this purchase thus far, and looking forward to capturing many memories to come with this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,6,15,(It also supports EyeFi cards, presumably because Canon already had the drivers in the OS build and didn't see a need to take them out.)
B00DMS0LCO,6,16,I also purchased the PNY 62GB SXD memory card, I would rather have more than less.
B00DMS0LCO,6,17,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,6,18,Third-party software will do all that, but only with a cable.
B00DMS0LCO,6,19,But overall, it seemed like a nice lens and shoots nice pictures.BATTERY LIFEWithout WiFi the battery life is quite good.
B00DMS0LCO,6,20,Also, you can't upload directly to FB or photo sharing sites but, instead, must upload to Canon's awkward cloud based photo service and transfer from there.VIEWFINDER: Optical viewfinder quality is excellent.
B00DMS0LCO,6,21,A best buy by any measure.
B00DMS0LCO,6,22,I bought the right one.
B00DMS0LCO,6,23,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,6,24,The included 18mm-55mm kit lens is, well, the included kit lens; no frills but sufficient to get you started.
B00DMS0LCO,7,0,Best Canon at this price point yet!
B00DMS0LCO,7,1,One like this and another small P&S; I can carry in my pocket.
B00DMS0LCO,7,2,But, I do like the size and feel of this Canon.
B00DMS0LCO,7,3,Looks and feels great.
B00DMS0LCO,7,4,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,7,5,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,6,I went the Canon DSLR route due to looking at astrophotography.
B00DMS0LCO,7,7,I wouldn't say the photo quality is much nicer in my opinion, because I have printed out two 11x14s and I really cannot tell a quality difference from 10 MP to 20.2 MP at that size.
B00DMS0LCO,7,8,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,9,Best AF available at this time in a SLR.
B00DMS0LCO,7,10,Nikon tends to put more features into their cameras at a given price point, where Canon focuses more on the tried-and-true, making the cameras easy to use in favor of throwing every bell and whistle in.
B00DMS0LCO,7,11,I don't care how good it works, give me form and function!!
B00DMS0LCO,7,12,But, this is a nice, solid lens at a good cost.Video: The primary selling point on this is the focus when using video.
B00DMS0LCO,7,13,If I had $700 to buy a movie DSLR that would fit into a small bag, I'd save another $500 and buy a bigger bag rather than take the SL1 over the 70D.vs.
B00DMS0LCO,7,14,Of course it had to be a Canon that could fit my previous four lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,7,15,Great image quality & amazing autofocus!
B00DMS0LCO,7,16,Easy to use, with good image quality and lots of options.
B00DMS0LCO,7,17,It's the best I have used yet.
B00DMS0LCO,7,18,I don't mean the price (that's not cheap)I mean the construction.
B00DMS0LCO,7,19,Strong points include a smooth zoom action, no zoom creep, and nearly inaudible focus and stabilization.
B00DMS0LCO,7,20,Great camera if APS-C-sized sensor is what you're looking for.
B00DMS0LCO,7,21,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,7,22,I love it !!!
B00DMS0LCO,7,23,I love this  camera !!!
B00DMS0LCO,7,24,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,8,0,I have the 18-135 and it is a great lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,1,Good kit lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,2,I'm not going to restate all the excellent attributes of the camera and lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,3,I have a 50mm lens and will be getting better lenses....
B00DMS0LCO,8,4,The included 18mm-55mm kit lens is, well, the included kit lens; no frills but sufficient to get you started.
B00DMS0LCO,8,5,This is a great camera and the packaged kit lens is quite good if you get the 18-135mm.
B00DMS0LCO,8,6,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,8,7,I just purchased this beauty with the 18-55 STM lens and the 55-250 IS lens kit.
B00DMS0LCO,8,8,I usually shoot with a 24-105mm lens, so this lens feels a little cheaper than the L quality I'm accustomed to.
B00DMS0LCO,8,9,The kit lens (18-135) is quiet.
B00DMS0LCO,8,10,I'm using the kit lens (ef-s 18-135 stm).
B00DMS0LCO,8,11,I have had this camera for a little over a month now and am only working with the kit lens and body right out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,8,12,I also bought a camera bag to hold all the stuff, lens filters to protect the lenses, and a 50mm 1.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,13,Pair this camera with an STM lens and you've got camcorder like video on a DSLR.The 18-135mm kit lens gives you a great range as a walk around lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,14,The 18-35 mm kit lens gives a lot of range, and I tested the camera out with my other lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,8,15,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,8,16,This one did not go on if the lens cap was on, nor could you put the lens cap on if the hood was attached.
B00DMS0LCO,8,17,Why I returned 70D+EF 24mm f/1.4 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,18,I bought the 18-135mm STM lens as a package.
B00DMS0LCO,8,19,The autofocus with the STM kit lens is so quiet, you think is must not be working.
B00DMS0LCO,8,20,Great camera if APS-C-sized sensor is what you're looking for.
B00DMS0LCO,8,21,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.
B00DMS0LCO,8,22,I currently own a Canon Xti + Tamron 17mm-50mm f/2.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,23,Great deal on a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,8,24,Canon does not have many STM lenses at the moment, so don't expect to find many alternatives for video other than the kit lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,9,0,I am very impressed with the image quality in low or ambient light, where the ISO is under 1000.
B00DMS0LCO,9,1,Images are softer than expected.
B00DMS0LCO,9,2,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,9,3,The image quality is excellent, with good, low ISO noise up to ISO 3200, and, with good noise-reduction software, up to 12,800.Although I bought it for ISO 25,600, where the image quality is adequate with noise reduction, I find its video features very good.
B00DMS0LCO,9,4,Easy to use, with good image quality and lots of options.
B00DMS0LCO,9,5,Great image quality & amazing autofocus!
B00DMS0LCO,9,6,Colors are preserved better at high ISOs.
B00DMS0LCO,9,7,The low light performance is fantastic with the noise levels almost unnoticeable even at ISO 6400.
B00DMS0LCO,9,8,Coming from a T2i the image quality is excellent (specially in low light).
B00DMS0LCO,9,9,Should be better in 2013.
B00DMS0LCO,9,10,Too good for me.
B00DMS0LCO,9,11,This camera makes taking pictures or video in low light easy, no visible noise at even very high ISO.
B00DMS0LCO,9,12,I do wish at times I could soften the image because the detail can be too telling.
B00DMS0LCO,9,13,Excellent Quality Build and Impressive Photos.
B00DMS0LCO,9,14,*insane Gollumesque giggling* Canon would like you to know that they can make a 40 megapixel image sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,9,15,Canon certainly has a high quality lineup, and has gone the distance in putting forth a lower priced high quality camera for the masses.
B00DMS0LCO,9,16,They are higher priced and do not have the quality of this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,9,17,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,9,18,a leap in continous AF (in good light).
B00DMS0LCO,9,19,Being able to produce high quality photos, however, is almost immediate, thanks to the many automated controls built in.
B00DMS0LCO,9,20,Great camera if APS-C-sized sensor is what you're looking for.
B00DMS0LCO,9,21,Noise levels are low, even when shooting RAW and the video quality is great though not a vast improvement.
B00DMS0LCO,9,22,I am coming from a T3I (which I was more than happy with the image quality but needed more features).
B00DMS0LCO,9,23,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,9,24,The range of the ISO and the shutter speed is great and the difference it makes in the picture quality is amazing!
B00DMS0LCO,10,0,I bought the right one.
B00DMS0LCO,10,1,This camera has won me over and it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,10,2,Buy this camera!!
B00DMS0LCO,10,3,Great deal on a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,4,when I bought this camera, I was scared to buy something I thought I was maybe overspending on a product I would not need.
B00DMS0LCO,10,5,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,6,Love This Camera!
B00DMS0LCO,10,7,This is a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,8,This is a great camera for the price.
B00DMS0LCO,10,9,However, it's still very good.
B00DMS0LCO,10,10,Also, the amazon price was $1200 when I bought it - and I am surprised that the price has dropped at all.
B00DMS0LCO,10,11,great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,12,I bought this camera for videography and couldn't be more happy with it.
B00DMS0LCO,10,13,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,14,And it seems a very good value for the price.
B00DMS0LCO,10,15,Highly recommended.
B00DMS0LCO,10,16,Over priced.
B00DMS0LCO,10,17,Highly recommended!!
B00DMS0LCO,10,18,That is the reason I bought this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,19,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,10,20,I actually purchased a T5i because of an amazing Christmas deal.
B00DMS0LCO,10,21,I highly recommend the product.
B00DMS0LCO,10,22,I ended up putting more money into a camera than I had planed, And my nervous stomach ache is gone.
B00DMS0LCO,10,23,Great product.
B00DMS0LCO,10,24,I've only had it a few weeks, but so far it has worked very well.
B00DMS0LCO,11,0,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,11,1,Good Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,2,The operations are really easy, and I really like this camera
B00DMS0LCO,11,3,Great Camera!
B00DMS0LCO,11,4,great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,5,Great DSLR !
B00DMS0LCO,11,6,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,7,Excellent Camera with Great Features.
B00DMS0LCO,11,8,Helpful, great illustrations.
B00DMS0LCO,11,9,Excellent DSLR for beginner and intermediate photographers alike.
B00DMS0LCO,11,10,70D What a great camera!
B00DMS0LCO,11,11,Just a really good camera that will take me years to really learn but will provide me with strong photos and videos.
B00DMS0LCO,11,12,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,11,13,I'm a professional photographer and we have ventured into the photo booth business.
B00DMS0LCO,11,14,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,11,15,Great Camera for Pro and Novice alike!
B00DMS0LCO,11,16,The touch screen is the best feature Canon added to this camera; simply swipe through photos, pinch to zoom... Setting changes are so quick and easy.
B00DMS0LCO,11,17,There are a lot of auto or semi-auto modes good for the beginner, as well as full manual controls (which is really why you would want to buy a camera like this anyway).
B00DMS0LCO,11,18,You do have to know some of the basics of how DSLR cameras work.
B00DMS0LCO,11,19,I def recommend this camera to any amateur photographer like myself.
B00DMS0LCO,11,20,While it may take a while for a beginning amateur photographer to learn how to use all the numerous features, it is well worth the learning experience.
B00DMS0LCO,11,21,The camera has a good feel to it and although it is a bit heavier that previous camera I've owned it still feels good in my hands.
B00DMS0LCO,11,22,I hope I can learn to use 20% of the features on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,23,I'm a beginner to photography, and this camera is extremely user friendly.
B00DMS0LCO,11,24,I am not a professional photographer, but I was looking for good, high quality photos and I knew the 70D would give me all that I was looking for in a camera for many years to come.
B00DMS0LCO,12,0,very good.
B00DMS0LCO,12,1,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,12,2,The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good.
B00DMS0LCO,12,3,Great Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,4,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,5,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,12,6,I haven't edited any of the video, so I do no know if the lens sounds show up on the video.
B00DMS0LCO,12,7,Once more I know that I have a very good camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,8,Videos are excellent.
B00DMS0LCO,12,9,I was amazed and the people who watched my video's in HD were surprised.
B00DMS0LCO,12,10,Most reviews made it sound like a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,11,The autofocus in video is AMAZING...
B00DMS0LCO,12,12,Too good for me.
B00DMS0LCO,12,13,This camera/lens produce amazing photos and videos.
B00DMS0LCO,12,14,Every good thing you read regarding this camera's focusing ability, video capabilities, LiveView (LV) shooting is mostly true.
B00DMS0LCO,12,15,I love the autofocus on video.
B00DMS0LCO,12,16,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,12,17,I'm just an amature that likes shooting video and pictures.
B00DMS0LCO,12,18,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,12,19,The 70Ds video shooting is SO incredibly good that I am now looking for opportunities to record things!
B00DMS0LCO,12,20,I have a professional Canon video camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,21,Finally a word about Video performance.
B00DMS0LCO,12,22,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,12,23,Shoots some great footage.
B00DMS0LCO,12,24,It also works perfectly while shooting videos where the focus changes during the shot.
B00DMS0LCO,13,0,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,13,1,When I get the battery, there is no power in it.
B00DMS0LCO,13,2,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,13,3,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,13,4,break battery.
B00DMS0LCO,13,5,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,13,6,I put the dead battery that came with the camera on the charger and left it to charge thinking nothing of it.4
B00DMS0LCO,13,7,I had second thoughts but turns out the Canon charger worked and battery had no issues whatsoever.
B00DMS0LCO,13,8,the battery charger charge TWO batteries fast at the same time?I'd consider a full frame version, if the cons are fix.for
B00DMS0LCO,13,9,It would still work but it was not tactile.
B00DMS0LCO,13,10,But overall, it seemed like a nice lens and shoots nice pictures.BATTERY LIFEWithout WiFi the battery life is quite good.
B00DMS0LCO,13,11,I have never heard of this.why is there a communication problem between a new battery and the battery charger?...following the directions I separated the battery from the charger and put it back on....still blinking rapidly.....repeated this action again and finally the battery started to charge.
B00DMS0LCO,13,12,I've never considered myself a serious videographer, but this camera could change that.Battery Life: Battery life seems very good and I am still working off the same charge from when I pulled the camera out of the box about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,13,13,I have to return my new Tamron 24-75mm lens because of this problem.
B00DMS0LCO,13,14,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,13,15,NOT COOL.I have 2 after market batteries that would no charge on this charger .Bummer I then ordered an aftermarket charger for 5 $ no big deal.
B00DMS0LCO,13,16,On my previous cameras the battery meter would show full, then be at low, skipping the midrange all together.
B00DMS0LCO,13,17,wanted to let people know that I am getting about 950 photo's and about 25 minutes of video per battery charge.
B00DMS0LCO,13,18,I chose the Wasabi spare batteries over Canon, always do because they are better than the original Canon Batteries and a lot more affordable, must have spares, and that was it for the purchase.
B00DMS0LCO,13,19,One thing that always drove me crazy was that the battery meter.
B00DMS0LCO,13,20,Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.
B00DMS0LCO,13,21,keep in mind that this battery charger is the same battery charger that comes with the 5dmark ii 7D and a few other models.
B00DMS0LCO,13,22,I have to say that from the little time i've owned it, i can see why.
B00DMS0LCO,13,23,I should be able to charge after market batteries on this charger.sample
B00DMS0LCO,13,24,Battery life is great with the wi-fi turned off.
B00DMS0LCO,14,0,That is why I took one star away.I found the touch LCD and touch control screen on top of the 70D quite useful and adapted to them quickly.
B00DMS0LCO,14,1,It even implements iPhone-like viewing of images you have taken.
B00DMS0LCO,14,2,The articulated touch screen makes live view, video and menu settings very convenient.
B00DMS0LCO,14,3,I should note that I used the viewfinder primarily rather than the LCD screen for the pics.I found it very frustrating that the camera does not have a dedicated button for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,14,4,On a normal camera this would have been impossible as i couldn't see the screen, but not on the 70D! it was a cinch to simply flip out the screen and rotate it down to easily pull focus and see what i was filming.
B00DMS0LCO,14,5,Simply compose a shot, touch the specific point on the Live View screen and the 70d can be set up to quickly focus on that spot and shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,14,6,shutter would click when the live view button was pressed, but the LCD screen would stay blank.
B00DMS0LCO,14,7,I did not think I would like the touch screen but it turns out I use it most of the time to adjust my settings.
B00DMS0LCO,14,8,Body is not too big and not too small, just right!
B00DMS0LCO,14,9,Love the flip out rear touch screen LCD.
B00DMS0LCO,14,10,The swivel screen I thought might be a annoyance but I do not think twice about it.
B00DMS0LCO,14,11,Simply squeeze two fingers together to display more than a single photo, of drag your fingers apart to return to a single photo.
B00DMS0LCO,14,12,I have to return my new Tamron 24-75mm lens because of this problem.
B00DMS0LCO,14,13,There are lots of buttons and dials to press and turn plus the LCD touch screen options, so you have a lot of ground to cover in just knowing what and when to press what.
B00DMS0LCO,14,14,Oh, and same thing with the touch screen.
B00DMS0LCO,14,15,The T4i sensor had a couple of phase-detect pixels in the middle to make things less bad.
B00DMS0LCO,14,16,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,14,17,I also like that in Live-View, I can simply touch the screen on the point I want the camera to focus on, and the camera focuses to that point and releases the shutter.-WiFi:
B00DMS0LCO,14,18,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,14,19,Anyway, the fold-out display is a great feature, and it also folds face-in to protect the display when not in use.The ability to touch various points on the LCD display while in Live View or shooting video, and shift focus while shooting is - to me at least - worth the price of admission.
B00DMS0LCO,14,20,The camera has a good feel to it and although it is a bit heavier that previous camera I've owned it still feels good in my hands.
B00DMS0LCO,14,21,I had to switch back and forth and was frustrated as I prefer to use the viewfinder but HAVE to use live view for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,14,22,I find that getting used to the touch screen may take some time & again I worry a tad about the durability of a screen that can be rotated six ways from Sunday, but the controls are all in the right places & the menus on the touch screen make sense and are easy to get through.
B00DMS0LCO,14,23,The camera also has a good grip and the detachable lcd screen is a nice to have feature
B00DMS0LCO,14,24,All mirrorless bodies still do this in low light and most in bright light.(+)
B00DMS0LCO,15,0,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,15,1,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,15,2,I never had this problem, or any other issue, with my T3i.
B00DMS0LCO,15,3,Hence in low light, in LV mode the camera will not focus at all!
B00DMS0LCO,15,4,Focus Issue using the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,15,5,Instead, you have to flip the switch and use the live view mode.
B00DMS0LCO,15,6,I had to switch back and forth and was frustrated as I prefer to use the viewfinder but HAVE to use live view for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,15,7,Firmware updates since may have negated that issue; I don't know.
B00DMS0LCO,15,8,Focussing with live view is no problem but focussing correctly when using fast lenses (Sigma f1.8) through the viewfinder results in many missed shots.
B00DMS0LCO,15,9,I miss the AF assist light.
B00DMS0LCO,15,10,I am used to the Rebel T series.
B00DMS0LCO,15,11,There are a few shortcomings, most of which I think can be corrected with future firmware updates (if Canon wishes).1.
B00DMS0LCO,15,12,If you're more advanced, it simplifies Live View autofocus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,13,Upgraded from a Canon Rebel XS.
B00DMS0LCO,15,14,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,15,15,Liking the new features having moved up from a canon t3i.
B00DMS0LCO,15,16,The subject was out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,17,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,15,18,While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,15,19,Wonderful camera which suits my needs ... only minor firmware issues.
B00DMS0LCO,15,20,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,21,Now it's in focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,22,There's no focus-racking when focus stops.
B00DMS0LCO,15,23,Auto Focus Problems on 3 Canon 70d's.
B00DMS0LCO,15,24,No real complaints to date.
B00DMS0LCO,16,0,Said i can send my brand new camera for repair.
B00DMS0LCO,16,1,I gave it a 1 star because of the customer service I received from canon not for the camera itself because i never got see how the camera performs.
B00DMS0LCO,16,2,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,3,The pictures were so concerning I called Canon tech support (which was excellent by the way).
B00DMS0LCO,16,4,Poor customer service is beyond doubt.
B00DMS0LCO,16,5,In my case Tamron service was aware of the issue and under warranty upgraded my lenses firmware and now everything works perfectly.
B00DMS0LCO,16,6,When i called canon the guy treated me as if I was stupid and was telling me there is no way that there can be a err 30 code because thats a lens error and usually happens after a lot of use.
B00DMS0LCO,16,7,But for those who may be considering moving up the Canon line or hopping in for the first time hopefully I can help.
B00DMS0LCO,16,8,Once you've connected your phone to the camera's hotspot you just launch the Canon app.
B00DMS0LCO,16,9,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,16,10,I tried 3 cameras and all have the same problem.
B00DMS0LCO,16,11,putting this in 1 star just because of audio.
B00DMS0LCO,16,12,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,16,13,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,16,14,As a result, I've paid full-price for an 'open-box' (being charitable) product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,15,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,16,I bought two and both were defective out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,16,17,Finally a word about Video performance.
B00DMS0LCO,16,18,Finally.STILLS:Image quality is very good.
B00DMS0LCO,16,19,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,16,20,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,16,21,Two Defective Units Before Heading to Best Buy.
B00DMS0LCO,16,22,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,16,23,In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card.
B00DMS0LCO,16,24,I purchased this camera about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,17,0,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,1,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,17,2,In LV mode, when you are switching between still photo shooting modes using mode dial, LV switches off which is somewhat annoying.8.
B00DMS0LCO,17,3,Hence in low light, in LV mode the camera will not focus at all!
B00DMS0LCO,17,4,The subject was out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,17,5,Now it's in focus.
B00DMS0LCO,17,6,There's no focus-racking when focus stops.
B00DMS0LCO,17,7,Lastly, I think it would be really convenient, if in VF mode, when you are switching shooting modes using mode dial, the LV panel could automatically show the information about that shooting mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,8,With my 60D, I had to focus manually, or use autofocus in still-picture mode before switching to video.
B00DMS0LCO,17,9,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,17,10,date was set on the first camera.
B00DMS0LCO,17,11,first camera was set up to shoot RAW.
B00DMS0LCO,17,12,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,17,13,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,17,14,The 19 cross-type AF points is more than what I need but there is no way to select the AF points in Basic modes (A+, No Flash, CA) when using VF.
B00DMS0LCO,17,15,All 3 that I tried had the same Auto Focus problems that could not be corrected by the AF Micro Adjustment.
B00DMS0LCO,17,16,You don't have to place focus points on your subject or pan a focus box with the D-pad.
B00DMS0LCO,17,17,However in AF quick mode you cannot select a region to focus (tap to focus)!4.
B00DMS0LCO,17,18,You can use manual focus if you need more control.
B00DMS0LCO,17,19,Defective in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,20,Uses flash for low-light focus which will blind your subject.-
B00DMS0LCO,17,21,A new button near the shutter changes AF modes.
B00DMS0LCO,17,22,all their auto white balance was horrible.
B00DMS0LCO,17,23,Auto Focus Problems on 3 Canon 70d's.
B00DMS0LCO,17,24,I usually leave it in the Auto-Selection AF mode, and found that the 19 cross-type AF points do a MUCH better job of auto-selecting the focus points.
B00DMS0LCO,18,0,(Yes that is a must as you tend to press buttons and you can get unexpected results).
B00DMS0LCO,18,1,Shutter speed, how long th shutter remains open 1/x is also set automatically, as well as the ISO setting.)
B00DMS0LCO,18,2,It just shows how many "clicks" are on your shutter, in your camera.
B00DMS0LCO,18,3,The main difference is being able to shoot movies now... flip one switch and press the record button!
B00DMS0LCO,18,4,I also like that in Live-View, I can simply touch the screen on the point I want the camera to focus on, and the camera focuses to that point and releases the shutter.-WiFi:
B00DMS0LCO,18,5,I'm just an amature that likes shooting video and pictures.
B00DMS0LCO,18,6,There are lots of buttons and dials to press and turn plus the LCD touch screen options, so you have a lot of ground to cover in just knowing what and when to press what.
B00DMS0LCO,18,7,In LV mode, when you are switching between still photo shooting modes using mode dial, LV switches off which is somewhat annoying.8.
B00DMS0LCO,18,8,I love the ability to switch quickly between the 3 different AF options by hitting the small button next to the shutter release button.
B00DMS0LCO,18,9,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,18,10,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,18,11,The live feed doesn't come back until a few seconds after you've released the shutter button.
B00DMS0LCO,18,12,It keeps subjects that move at one speed in focus instead of repeatedly snapping in and out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,18,13,I did not think I would like the touch screen but it turns out I use it most of the time to adjust my settings.
B00DMS0LCO,18,14,It also works perfectly while shooting videos where the focus changes during the shot.
B00DMS0LCO,18,15,I am still trying to figure out how to hold the camera so that I can tap on the back viewing screen where I want the focus.
B00DMS0LCO,18,16,UpdateSo I have had more time to work with the camera and getting used to its ergonomics.
B00DMS0LCO,18,17,Lastly, I think it would be really convenient, if in VF mode, when you are switching shooting modes using mode dial, the LV panel could automatically show the information about that shooting mode.
B00DMS0LCO,18,18,A new button near the shutter changes AF modes.
B00DMS0LCO,18,19,The 7 frames per second come in VERY handy for bird shots.
B00DMS0LCO,18,20,What you will notice a difference in is the rate at which photos can be shot and processed.
B00DMS0LCO,18,21,I really need to use a mono-pod or tri-pod but this seems a hassle especially for action shots.
B00DMS0LCO,18,22,hand held with the L brackets and stationary shots using he monopod).
B00DMS0LCO,18,23,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,18,24,Most of the stills were at ISO 6400-12800 and shot in sport mode for high speed.
B00DMS0LCO,19,0,I also purchased the PNY 62GB SXD memory card, I would rather have more than less.
B00DMS0LCO,19,1,I have also used the WiFi to transfer photos to my computer, but its pretty slow, so I usually just use the USB cable instead.-Drive
B00DMS0LCO,19,2,Amazon sold this 70d to me as new, it came with with a memory card with other peoples pictures on it.Obviously not new.
B00DMS0LCO,19,3,While capturing video if you want to take a still photo, there is quite a few frame drops (about 1 sec as mentioned in the manual) even when using SD card with 95mb/s speed.
B00DMS0LCO,19,4,one card slot.
B00DMS0LCO,19,5,But overall, it seemed like a nice lens and shoots nice pictures.BATTERY LIFEWithout WiFi the battery life is quite good.
B00DMS0LCO,19,6,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,19,7,However, if you're downloading pictures to your device, a real internet connection will be faster than using the camera as an access point.
B00DMS0LCO,19,8,So when I read about the 70D I decided to go for it with the 18-135 lens and a super fast 80mb/s transfer rate memory card, are real must for high end video.
B00DMS0LCO,19,9,Shots can be taken in RAW and/or JPEG, saved to the memory card for post processing in your favorite software.
B00DMS0LCO,19,10,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,19,11,With WiFi on (especially when the camera is acting as the access point), the battery goes pretty quickly.
B00DMS0LCO,19,12,Most of my work is done with a tripod and with a cable release.
B00DMS0LCO,19,13,operating manual before you buy, IMHO.)
B00DMS0LCO,19,14,It has built in wifi that syncs to your phone, tablet and computer.
B00DMS0LCO,19,15,In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card.
B00DMS0LCO,19,16,Amazon said it was new, it was not.
B00DMS0LCO,19,17,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,19,18,Arrived quickly as promised, but would not recognize or format mem card.
B00DMS0LCO,19,19,BUY THIS CAMERA!
B00DMS0LCO,19,20,I'm just an amature that likes shooting video and pictures.
B00DMS0LCO,19,21,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,19,22,wanted to let people know that I am getting about 950 photo's and about 25 minutes of video per battery charge.
B00DMS0LCO,19,23,Unless they come up with a fix fairly quickly, I'm not sure I'd ever buy another Canon camera after this.
B00DMS0LCO,19,24,I guess I'll have to resort to FEL use, but that amount flashes takes a toll on an infant.
B00DMS0LCO,20,0,I also own a Canon PowerShot s95.
B00DMS0LCO,20,1,I've always been a Canon loyalist.
B00DMS0LCO,20,2,I went the Canon DSLR route due to looking at astrophotography.
B00DMS0LCO,20,3,I have several Canon Cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,20,4,I should've bought a replacement for the Canon PowerShot s95.So I sent the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 back and purchased the Sony RX100 II.
B00DMS0LCO,20,5,Upgraded from a Canon Rebel XS.
B00DMS0LCO,20,6,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,20,7,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,20,8,This works well, and the plethora of upgraded features from the previous models is, well "what I expected from these things years ago".
B00DMS0LCO,20,9,Way to go Canon!
B00DMS0LCO,20,10,Better than expected.
B00DMS0LCO,20,11,I have cheaper canons that do a better job.
B00DMS0LCO,20,12,Easy to use, with good image quality and lots of options.
B00DMS0LCO,20,13,The lens is relatively sharp, especially for a kit lens.Overall, if you think you might ever want to shoot video then I'd definitely take this over Nikon, Sony, or any other manufacturer's current offerings in the price range.
B00DMS0LCO,20,14,Liking the new features having moved up from a canon t3i.
B00DMS0LCO,20,15,I currently own a Canon Xti + Tamron 17mm-50mm f/2.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,20,16,I saw one man with a Canon T3i taking photos with a Class L lens while I tested my 70D at a butterfly exhibit (Florida) and so I believe he was getting better photos with the glass being a lot better.For the Nikon users whom might get on here and say that this particular camera sucks, I've been to three different tourist attractions, and for some reason, I've seen only one or two Nikons in a sea of Canons.
B00DMS0LCO,20,17,Unless they come up with a fix fairly quickly, I'm not sure I'd ever buy another Canon camera after this.
B00DMS0LCO,20,18,I had Canon 20d, 30d & 40d and Pro 1, G6, G9 and G11, Sx50 HS, Pentax ist, Panasonic FZ200, and i.m.h.o.
B00DMS0LCO,20,19,The one complaint I have of all Canon cameras is the software... it is lame compared to Nikon Software (they offer priced pro versions, Canon does not) you have to have PhotoShop when you have a Canon, and it makes no sense because I know Canon could easily enhance their editing software (NEEDS TO BE, hello Canon, READ THIS).
B00DMS0LCO,20,20,I have purchased a series of Nikon DSLR cameras over the years, but decided to purchase this Canon EOS 70D camera based on the good reviews of its video capability.
B00DMS0LCO,20,21,Keep it in context and the 70D is the best all around camera Canon has ever made by far.
B00DMS0LCO,20,22,I purchased this camera as an upgrade from the Canon EOS Rebel XTi that I've had for the past several years.
B00DMS0LCO,20,23,So apparently Canon is doing something to win over these tourists to Florida.
B00DMS0LCO,20,24,Why I returned 70D+EF 24mm f/1.4 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,21,0,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,21,1,I wanted the "body only" and quickly found the price of the body only was still the same.
B00DMS0LCO,21,2,The replacement started charging from 0-49%.-The rear lens cap on the kit lens was marred noticeably.-The
B00DMS0LCO,21,3,The included 18mm-55mm kit lens is, well, the included kit lens; no frills but sufficient to get you started.
B00DMS0LCO,21,4,Body is not too big and not too small, just right!
B00DMS0LCO,21,5,A few lenses don't work with it.
B00DMS0LCO,21,6,An f/2.8 lens on this body is just fast enough for most indoor use without flash.
B00DMS0LCO,21,7,I have a 50mm lens and will be getting better lenses....
B00DMS0LCO,21,8,I have had this camera for a little over a month now and am only working with the kit lens and body right out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,21,9,Saw the reviews of this camera and decided it was a needed upgrade.First off, I watched the price of the body and kit lens go way up AFTER the holiday season.
B00DMS0LCO,21,10,With the kit lenses in good light, it'll hold focus on a subject moving directly at the camera from close range at 7-10 MPH.
B00DMS0LCO,21,11,If you want a bigger body then just get a added grip, problem solved.
B00DMS0LCO,21,12,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,21,13,Less so lenses with older AF mechanisms (e.g., 50/1.8,
B00DMS0LCO,21,14,Take the time to carefully read the manual on setting it up.
B00DMS0LCO,21,15,I usually shoot with a 24-105mm lens, so this lens feels a little cheaper than the L quality I'm accustomed to.
B00DMS0LCO,21,16,I'd run this body to ISO 6400ish for full-res shots.
B00DMS0LCO,21,17,The 18-35 mm kit lens gives a lot of range, and I tested the camera out with my other lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,21,18,With a zoom that has a variable aperture, it's a hit and miss approach and quite cumbersome.Also, I tried the same lenses attached to my Canon T3i taking the same photos as I did with the 70D using the same flash and diffuser without using FEL.
B00DMS0LCO,21,19,Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.
B00DMS0LCO,21,20,The lens is relatively sharp, especially for a kit lens.Overall, if you think you might ever want to shoot video then I'd definitely take this over Nikon, Sony, or any other manufacturer's current offerings in the price range.
B00DMS0LCO,21,21,These lenses - and the kit lens is one of them - will not work on a full frame camera like the Canon 5D mkIII; the rear element extends back into the camera body in a way that makes it impossible to attach lenses of this series to full frame sensor cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,21,22,And they've done it without any obvious effect on image quality, while ditching contrast-detect entirely for most lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,21,23,Better mirrorless bodies show intermediate frames and continue to focus, but that's partly out of necessity.
B00DMS0LCO,21,24,Third-party lenses tend to have less initial cost, better warranties, and more aggressive designs.
B00DMS0LCO,22,0,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,22,1,So Far, So Good.
B00DMS0LCO,22,2,She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one.
B00DMS0LCO,22,3,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,22,4,Video is about average when indoors or in low light, but that's to be expected.
B00DMS0LCO,22,5,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,22,6,I needed a DSLR which can capture videos and take photos in low light.
B00DMS0LCO,22,7,Hence in low light, in LV mode the camera will not focus at all!
B00DMS0LCO,22,8,Half of the still photos were not clearly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,22,9,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,22,10,The image quality is excellent, with good, low ISO noise up to ISO 3200, and, with good noise-reduction software, up to 12,800.Although I bought it for ISO 25,600, where the image quality is adequate with noise reduction, I find its video features very good.
B00DMS0LCO,22,11,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,22,12,I wouldn't say the photo quality is much nicer in my opinion, because I have printed out two 11x14s and I really cannot tell a quality difference from 10 MP to 20.2 MP at that size.
B00DMS0LCO,22,13,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,22,14,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,22,15,And it seems a very good value for the price.
B00DMS0LCO,22,16,I am very impressed with the image quality in low or ambient light, where the ISO is under 1000.
B00DMS0LCO,22,17,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,22,18,The video and shooting autofocus work great although I have had a few times where it would not autofocus on something usually in really low light conditions.
B00DMS0LCO,22,19,Auto focus is great, manual focus is great.
B00DMS0LCO,22,20,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,22,21,The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good.
B00DMS0LCO,22,22,Some photos, like one reviewer said, are indeed soft, and I notice it on the black rectangles/squares when I thought it was in focus in the viewfinder, and the photo simply is not.
B00DMS0LCO,22,23,All photos with and without FEL were properly exposed and looked great.I use bounce flash indoors a lot for our one year old granddaughter.
B00DMS0LCO,22,24,This camera makes taking pictures or video in low light easy, no visible noise at even very high ISO.
B00DMS0LCO,23,0,It will be returned.
B00DMS0LCO,23,1,If you get a camera that is used I would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one.
B00DMS0LCO,23,2,See the Amazon review by Mr. Ralph J. Secoy.
B00DMS0LCO,23,3,Returned for replacement - hope it's OK!
B00DMS0LCO,23,4,I purchased this camera about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,23,5,I really liked this camera but had to return it for a defect.
B00DMS0LCO,23,6,At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,7,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,23,8,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,9,I bought two and both were defective out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,23,10,Got a used camera from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,11,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,23,12,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,23,13,Do not buy a 70D from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,14,I wanted this camera so bad for months and months and finally saved up the cash and went for it.
B00DMS0LCO,23,15,When researching my purchase, I initially thought I would purchase the Canon T5i, but after reading various reviews, I decided to go for the 70D.
B00DMS0LCO,23,16,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,23,17,I'm honestly beginning to wonder if Amazon buys some manufacturer's QC rejects for a discounted price.Triple check everything you buy from Amazon for defects and also verify that you haven't bought a counterfeit item.
B00DMS0LCO,23,18,OK, this is a first for me when dealing with Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,19,Read their review.
B00DMS0LCO,23,20,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,23,21,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,22,I purchased the Canon 70D just before Christmas last year to replace my previous camera that was ten years old.
B00DMS0LCO,23,23,Amazon is selling used cameras as new!
B00DMS0LCO,23,24,I researched this camera well online before deciding to purchase.
B00DMS0LCO,24,0,New Canon user!
B00DMS0LCO,24,1,operating manual before you buy, IMHO.)
B00DMS0LCO,24,2,You can use manual focus if you need more control.
B00DMS0LCO,24,3,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,24,4,Take the time to carefully read the manual on setting it up.
B00DMS0LCO,24,5,Like any new system there is the typical learning curve but very easy to use.
B00DMS0LCO,24,6,Overall, I am very excited about my switch to Canon, I have no complaints thus far and the only thing I need to do now is learn this new button layout which I am not at all used to.
B00DMS0LCO,24,7,Way to go Canon!
B00DMS0LCO,24,8,Five buttons have switched functions relative to the 60D.
B00DMS0LCO,24,9,It just works.
B00DMS0LCO,24,10,The physical UI is better, though the menu UI is less polished, as are some software features.
B00DMS0LCO,24,11,But for those who may be considering moving up the Canon line or hopping in for the first time hopefully I can help.
B00DMS0LCO,24,12,You can also remotely change all the settings of the camera from the phone.
B00DMS0LCO,24,13,The only difference is that you can't (as yet) control the transition pace.
B00DMS0LCO,24,14,A new button near the shutter changes AF modes.
B00DMS0LCO,24,15,I am working with the A+  (Automated) basic mode for starters, (which essentially makes the camera a point and shoot) and reading the instruction manual as I go along.
B00DMS0LCO,24,16,You can use it with the Canon apps to take simple shots or the third party DSLR Controller app (Android) and control many if not most of the 70D functions from your droid phone or tablet.
B00DMS0LCO,24,17,What's better is that almost every control you might ever need to adjust while shooting is accessible through the screen, meaning you don't have to fumble around with buttons, knobs or navigate menus to adjust your shot settings.The 70D has a reasonable HDR shooting mode, which is a function I always want on my cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,24,18,I expected this to happen but it illustrates photographers need to control the point of focus and shouldn't expect cameras to read their mind.
B00DMS0LCO,24,19,The Sony RX10 has 3 custom WB and the 70D has just one.5.WB: if you want to chance the custom WB, you have to go and dig into the main menu.
B00DMS0LCO,24,20,Much improved button layout, too.I haven't used the movie-mode capabilities, but am looking forward to doing so.
B00DMS0LCO,24,21,Finally, the 7D's toggle switch for LiveView and video migrated to the 70D, a big improvement over the 60D's clumsy Mode dial video.AUTOFOCUS: The 70D inherited the 7D's blazing fast 19-point cross type AF array.
B00DMS0LCO,24,22,The dial works, it's just small.
B00DMS0LCO,24,23,UpdateSo I have had more time to work with the camera and getting used to its ergonomics.
B00DMS0LCO,24,24,If you're a novice, it makes things accessible.
B00DMS0LCO,25,0,Coming from using Nikons (D7000 and D600), I got tired of terrible back focus issues and oil spots on my sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,25,1,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,25,2,If you're interested in video production, buy a dedicated video camera.
B00DMS0LCO,25,3,Same issues.
B00DMS0LCO,25,4,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,25,5,Focus issue???? Sign the petition!
B00DMS0LCO,25,6,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,25,7,Most reviews made it sound like a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,25,8,Canon will probably respond with an update to resolve the issue as they have in the past.
B00DMS0LCO,25,9,Note, MFA adjustments only apply to P, Av, Tv and M modes.Search for Youtube video "70D Bad Focus Issues" by CameraRec Toby for more info on the focusing issue.
B00DMS0LCO,25,10,I have a professional Canon video camera.
B00DMS0LCO,25,11,It also works perfectly while shooting videos where the focus changes during the shot.
B00DMS0LCO,25,12,The CR2 (camera raw) files are not at all affected by this, it's a factor limited to the HD video.
B00DMS0LCO,25,13,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,25,14,I had not heard of any focusing issues but a quick internet search on "70D focus issues" yielded a large volume of unhappy customers who have spent a lot of time researching the issue.
B00DMS0LCO,25,15,BUY THIS CAMERA!
B00DMS0LCO,25,16,And I suspect this technical point should not be an issue for most people considering buying the Canon 70D.
B00DMS0LCO,25,17,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,25,18,This camera also has capabilities to take HD movies, although that is not my personal reason for buying this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,25,19,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,25,20,I thought strongly about buying this or the Nikon D7100.
B00DMS0LCO,25,21,The new autofocus system in live view for video and photo is groundbreaking and lightyears ahead of what my D7000 and D600 could do.
B00DMS0LCO,25,22,At first I compared the Canon T5i to the Nikon D3200 and settled on the Nikon, but when I went to hit the order button the price of the Nikon kit had gone up by several hundred dollars so I went the next level up and started over.
B00DMS0LCO,25,23,After much research I settled for the Canon 70D over the Nikon D7100.
B00DMS0LCO,25,24,If you shoot RAW you will need to buy the new Adobe Lightroom 5 and update it to the 5.2 version to even get it to view.
