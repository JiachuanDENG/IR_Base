B008DWG5HE,0,0,Way better then the Kindle!
B008DWG5HE,0,1,Love, love, love this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,0,2,But even though I have both Kindle Fire HDs which I also love, I missed the Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,0,3,LOVE IT!! Love this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,0,4,iPad isn't.
B008DWG5HE,0,5,This tablet makes the iPad obsolete.
B008DWG5HE,0,6,I can now read books again and do so much more.
B008DWG5HE,0,7,For those who wants to use this device to read.
B008DWG5HE,0,8,I'm in love with it.
B008DWG5HE,0,9,I suggest you buy amazon kindle fire HD, although there's no S-pen.
B008DWG5HE,0,10,The SGN 10.1 is my second tablet, the first being the original Kindle Fire.
B008DWG5HE,0,11,Well I really love it.
B008DWG5HE,0,12,I love it.

B008DWG5HE,0,14,Looking for something better than an iPad?
B008DWG5HE,0,15,You will love it!
B008DWG5HE,0,16,It can do everything the ipad can plus much more.
B008DWG5HE,0,17,Yes the Ipad 4 and Infinity both have high resolution screens, but having those screens doesn't make up for the abilities that the Note 10.1 has.
B008DWG5HE,0,18,Love it!
B008DWG5HE,0,19,The only advantage the iPad has over it is the "HD" retina display.
B008DWG5HE,0,20,The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,0,21,The screen is clear with great color.
B008DWG5HE,0,22,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,0,23,I have read other reviews of people complaining about the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,0,24,Late last year I got a Kindle Fire and this spring I went for a smartphone.
B008DWG5HE,1,0,Not sure how games play out on it but videos look great.
B008DWG5HE,1,1,I think this will be a useful app as well.
B008DWG5HE,1,2,You have so many App.s that can be found at the Google Play store, many are free.
B008DWG5HE,1,3,Work great wife love it  only thing I cant play vids from Amazon  dont know where to get the app
B008DWG5HE,1,4,Other apps can give you .psd
B008DWG5HE,1,5,Unless you love downloading lots of apps and downloading movies or something.
B008DWG5HE,1,6,even found some great apps to tutor my kids on it.i'm
B008DWG5HE,1,7,I also watch Netflix movies , read kindle books and Google play magazines on it.
B008DWG5HE,1,8,Kindle app works great and Amazon Prime movies work well in the browser.
B008DWG5HE,1,9,There are thousands of apps on the Google Play Store to choose from.
B008DWG5HE,1,10,The Note works great for all the other things (like music,web, video and books).
B008DWG5HE,1,11,The Note 10.1 may not be everything, but it's enough to be a game changer, for me at least.
B008DWG5HE,1,12,This is a problem right?.... Nope! Download the app camscanner (its free!!)
B008DWG5HE,1,13,One for their store and one for their apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,14,Has a 10.1" screen which makes it easy to see and watch videos or movie.
B008DWG5HE,1,15,really great for reading my books and comics.
B008DWG5HE,1,16,I down loaded the Video player MX-Video there is a free App. and I can view my HD videos on this tablet and they really look great.
B008DWG5HE,1,17,All my favorite Android apps look great on it.
B008DWG5HE,1,18,I use the Kindle app for reading.
B008DWG5HE,1,19,It comes loaded with a lot of great features and programs like the Samsung App store and the Android Play store.
B008DWG5HE,1,20,I can read books using the Kindle app, or using Adobe Reader, or Zinio Reader, Amazon Book reader.
B008DWG5HE,1,21,There's a great selection of apps optimized for tablets from Google Play, Amazon App Store, and Samsung Apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,22,Lots of apps already installed.
B008DWG5HE,1,23,Also, every app I have looked at seems to be 40-50% cheaper on the Amazon app site than on Play Store.
B008DWG5HE,1,24,I had a Hava streaming box for TV - the app on iPad wasn't working, but it's Android app worked perfect...
B008DWG5HE,2,0,Same price as Brandsmart.
B008DWG5HE,2,1,Great Product.
B008DWG5HE,2,2,If you really want to have a product to use it as profesional then get this one is great !!

B008DWG5HE,2,24,Love, love, love this tablet!
B008DWG5HE,3,0,It had ample battery life sufficient for my use.
B008DWG5HE,3,1,Battery life is short.2.
B008DWG5HE,3,2,Long battery life as it lastsall day.
B008DWG5HE,3,3,The battery life is really good too.
B008DWG5HE,3,4,Battery doesn't last long.
B008DWG5HE,3,5,Battery life is great too.
B008DWG5HE,3,6,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,3,7,Battery life is great.
B008DWG5HE,3,8,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,3,9,Battery charge.
B008DWG5HE,3,10,Battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,11,Battery life is about 7 hours...maybe a little more.The resolution of the screen is great.
B008DWG5HE,3,12,My only issue is that it takes a long time to take a full charge and does not charge rapidly enough to use while charging, but the battery life is not bad.
B008DWG5HE,3,13,Always seems like we are charging it.
B008DWG5HE,3,14,See how long the battery lasts.
B008DWG5HE,3,15,Longer battery life than the iPad or GTab.
B008DWG5HE,3,16,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,3,17,I usually have the brightness set to 10-15% or slightly less in classrooms or at home because that's all I really need but also to conserve battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,18,Battery life is very good, it is easily an all day device with wifi on and high brightness while taking notes.
B008DWG5HE,3,19,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B008DWG5HE,3,20,If you are playing a game the battery goes low way to quick.
B008DWG5HE,3,21,Easy to use!  Battery lasts!
B008DWG5HE,3,22,I think I was down to 77% or something so battery life should be fine.
B008DWG5HE,3,23,If you don't use it very much I have gone 5 days on one charge.
B008DWG5HE,3,24,We may need charging every 3 days or so.The unit is blazing fast.
B008DWG5HE,4,0,Good sound, better than any tablet I herd.
B008DWG5HE,4,1,The speakers are of great quality.
B008DWG5HE,4,2,It has great sound.
B008DWG5HE,4,3,Yes it is plastic, but I like it, feels good, doesn't creak.
B008DWG5HE,4,4,As far as quality of picture and sound, I can't really tell the difference.
B008DWG5HE,4,5,Good solid tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,6,Feels solid to me and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,4,7,especially fond of the speakers.
B008DWG5HE,4,8,Sound is great.
B008DWG5HE,4,9,Not as good as the Ipad 3, but great.
B008DWG5HE,4,10,it has pretty good battery life, it also has an excellent quality sounding speakers, which i wasn't expecting on any tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,11,picture great sound!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,4,12,And the sound quality and volume were excellent.
B008DWG5HE,4,13,Loud and decent quality speakers, probably the best on any tablet I've experienced6.
B008DWG5HE,4,14,So far, so good.
B008DWG5HE,4,15,This is as good as it gets.
B008DWG5HE,4,16,The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,4,17,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,4,18,Better than my ol' iPad!
B008DWG5HE,4,19,It is different from the iPad, but that's a good thing, I think.
B008DWG5HE,4,20,I never expected it to be as good as it is.
B008DWG5HE,4,21,Also the build quality could be improved.
B008DWG5HE,4,22,Here is the good and the .. well it is all pretty good.1.
B008DWG5HE,4,23,The tablet itself has a nice feel to it.
B008DWG5HE,4,24,The tablet feel in hand is great and I actually didn't even put a case on it!
B008DWG5HE,5,0,Works great with good picture quality.
B008DWG5HE,5,1,very good.
B008DWG5HE,5,2,Here is the good and the .. well it is all pretty good.1.
B008DWG5HE,5,3,apps are easy to use and the camera front and rear are as good as other in it category.
B008DWG5HE,5,4,It has picture in picture video.
B008DWG5HE,5,5,I wanted front and back cameras.
B008DWG5HE,5,6,screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,5,7,Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great.
B008DWG5HE,5,8,The screen is very bright and clear.
B008DWG5HE,5,9,The touch screen is great.-the
B008DWG5HE,5,10,The rear-facing camera takes really decent images!6)
B008DWG5HE,5,11,Video isn't that great either, but this is a tablet we're talking about here, not a Canon/Nikon/Sony dSLR or video camera.
B008DWG5HE,5,12,thing to note about the screen.
B008DWG5HE,5,13,It has a decent front camera for video chat, and the a decent rear camera with a flash, tablets are not cameras but this one is above average.10)
B008DWG5HE,5,14,I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet.
B008DWG5HE,5,15,OK, let;s get it over with, the screen isn't as high resolution as the Apple, but it;s pretty good.
B008DWG5HE,5,16,The picture and video quality are even better than expected.
B008DWG5HE,5,17,And the picture quality is amazing.
B008DWG5HE,5,18,Nice to have speakers up front, but it would be nice if they were a little louder.4.
B008DWG5HE,5,19,The front and rear camera works very well and the Photoshop Touch app is an excellent complement.
B008DWG5HE,5,20,With Smart Stay, the front facing camera will look at you.
B008DWG5HE,5,21,Speed is great and the screen is great, I take more productivity tools over high resolution screen tablet anyday.
B008DWG5HE,5,22,Words and pictures can look pixel-ee at times.-Another
B008DWG5HE,5,23,The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.
B008DWG5HE,5,24,I find the screen quality just fine for my video needs including netflix, hbogo, and xfinity.
B008DWG5HE,6,0,Fast and responsive.
B008DWG5HE,6,1,fast processor, clear and bright screen.
B008DWG5HE,6,2,It did not disappoint.Firstly, this tablet is fast, really fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,3,Amazingly fast and responsive!
B008DWG5HE,6,4,Quad core is fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,5,quad core processor runs everything quickly and smoothly.
B008DWG5HE,6,6,It's fast as lightingThe s pen is great.
B008DWG5HE,6,7,Perfect power, great value for a quad core.
B008DWG5HE,6,8,The response of both the S-Pen and touch screen are great.
B008DWG5HE,6,9,The touch screen is great.-the
B008DWG5HE,6,10,If Samsung were to upgrade this thing they should put in one of those nice new octa-core processors and a nice AmoLED screen.
B008DWG5HE,6,11,screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,6,12,It is very fast and smooth.
B008DWG5HE,6,13,Note: the iPad 3 is only 1GHz processor, and dual core, not quad.*
B008DWG5HE,6,14,Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.
B008DWG5HE,6,15,The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,6,16,Blazing fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,17,The screen is clear with great color.
B008DWG5HE,6,18,The note 10.1 is blazing fast thanks to its quad core 1.4 ghz exynos processor and its 2gb of ram, lag free and full of features.
B008DWG5HE,6,19,The screen is plenty bright, the tablet is snappy and responsive.
B008DWG5HE,6,20,The quad core is sickly fast.d.
B008DWG5HE,6,21,Fast processor and connections.
B008DWG5HE,6,22,Touchscreen responsiveness is also very good.
B008DWG5HE,6,23,thing to note about the screen.
B008DWG5HE,6,24,This screen is beautiful!
B008DWG5HE,7,0,Make sure to get a 32gig micro SD card, to expand the memory.
B008DWG5HE,7,1,I wanted a SD card slot for additional storage.
B008DWG5HE,7,2,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,3,I purchased a 32GB micro SD card to increase storage space for my videos.
B008DWG5HE,7,4,This is a great tablet and for only $11.00 I added 16 more GB via mini SD.
B008DWG5HE,7,5,The storage capacity is excellent, 16GB, plus an extra 16GB SD card for the full 32GB of storage.
B008DWG5HE,7,6,With the exantion slot my note went from 32gb to 96gb.
B008DWG5HE,7,7,I don't recommend buying the 32gb version because this has a Micro SD slot for extra storage space up to 64gb.
B008DWG5HE,7,8,I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.
B008DWG5HE,7,9,You have the freedom to play with your storage the way you want by buying as many mini cards as you want.
B008DWG5HE,7,10,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,11,Another great feature is that even though this device comes with 32 GB internal memory, I can insert a 64 GB card.
B008DWG5HE,7,12,Expandable Storage.*
B008DWG5HE,7,13,Love the SD card slot option and again... it's great having a dedicated stylus.
B008DWG5HE,7,14,Micro SD support7.
B008DWG5HE,7,15,Ended up buying a 32GB mini SD card for the tablet which does give me 64 GB which helps.
B008DWG5HE,7,16,I love the fact that I can extend memory with an sd card.
B008DWG5HE,7,17,I highly recommend that you buy the Sandisk 32gb Micro Ultra memory card.
B008DWG5HE,7,18,I also love having the micro SD card option as then I don't worry about space.
B008DWG5HE,7,19,Thanks Samsung, you guys made a great tablet with a great idea!I bought 32 gb one, and I am about to use it with my 32 gb SD memory card too.
B008DWG5HE,7,20,While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-
B008DWG5HE,7,21,I can increase my storage with Micro SD cards or use them to access media I don't want to load onto the Note.
B008DWG5HE,7,22,Did I mention it has an option for an external SD card to go along with the 32GB that it already has?
B008DWG5HE,7,23,I chose this over the IPad because apps are not proprietary, you can add extra memory with a micro sd card that you can't do with the IPad and it was a good deal cheaper.
B008DWG5HE,7,24,The amount of storage to me is great.
B008DWG5HE,8,0,For those who wants to use this device to read.
B008DWG5HE,8,1,This device has replaced my laptop as my main computing device.
B008DWG5HE,8,2,A new way of doing computing.
B008DWG5HE,8,3,New computing companion.
B008DWG5HE,8,4,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,8,5,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,8,6,No problems connecting to any bt devices so far.
B008DWG5HE,8,7,Great Tablet!
B008DWG5HE,8,8,I use my computers mostly for email and web searching and shopping.
B008DWG5HE,8,9,I read ebook, surf web, and watch videos.
B008DWG5HE,8,10,Great Product!
B008DWG5HE,8,11,It's basically replaced my laptop.
B008DWG5HE,8,12,it syncs up all of my computer phone and tablet information and makes it really easy to work
B008DWG5HE,8,13,Love the large screen and the web experience.
B008DWG5HE,8,14,I use this device to check Facebook, my e-mail, and do online searches.
B008DWG5HE,8,15,I use the Kindle app for reading.
B008DWG5HE,8,16,I have been using computers since the 1970's, but I am new to tablets and cloud computing.
B008DWG5HE,8,17,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,8,18,If you really want to have a product to use it as profesional then get this one is great !!
B008DWG5HE,8,19,The browser capabilities are very similar to my laptop and I find myself on my wifes Note more than the Ipad (which I we only use for games).I would strongly recommend the Note to anyone looking to get a great tablet that is used to non-Apple mobile and standard computing, i.e.
B008DWG5HE,8,20,Perfect for these WiFi devices.
B008DWG5HE,8,21,Things can be synced between devices quickly and easily.
B008DWG5HE,8,22,Excellent web browsing, syncs with my desktop computer chrome browser.
B008DWG5HE,8,23,from now on it's there in my tablets from school, browsing, social networking, emailing, etc. thank you!
B008DWG5HE,8,24,Web pages loading time is fast but not nearly as fast as my laptop.
B008DWG5HE,9,0,And well, after trying several apps, I must say that best for writing are: Quill, Write and Papyrus.
B008DWG5HE,9,1,I use it more for reading, but I love the pen and being able to write instead of type.
B008DWG5HE,9,2,You can write as though you were using a pen and paper.
B008DWG5HE,9,3,You can write and draw on this tablet asefficiently as you do on paper.
B008DWG5HE,9,4,The handwriting app is good.
B008DWG5HE,9,5,Love all the apps it's got.
B008DWG5HE,9,6,If you want to get this tablet for anything except the pen, don't do it and go for other tablets with better resolution/price/etc.
B008DWG5HE,9,7,The S Pen is so accurate that you can hand write whole sheets of handwritten text with it.
B008DWG5HE,9,8,I don't like software keyboards so I love being able to write everything out.
B008DWG5HE,9,9,The S note app allows you to take notes or even write math equations.
B008DWG5HE,9,10,You can write math equations into the note app and it'll solve them, same with chemistry symbols, and the pen feature works really well.
B008DWG5HE,9,11,I've seen other top-of-the-line tablets used with an after-market stylus where you write really big in 1/2 the screen and what you write is digitized down (sometimes unreadable) into your "notes" in the other half of the screen.Not so with the Samsung Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,9,12,You can use the pen to draw or write with it.
B008DWG5HE,9,13,The S-Pen feels like a real pen when you are writing not like those gummy bear stylus tips that the other tablets use to write with.
B008DWG5HE,9,14,The response of both the S-Pen and touch screen are great.
B008DWG5HE,9,15,S Note and PS Touch are geared to work well with the new Samsung Galaxy S Pen.
B008DWG5HE,9,16,I'm a writer and it's so much easier writing than typing!
B008DWG5HE,9,17,I screengrab my calculator app to capture graphs and get those into my notes.
B008DWG5HE,9,18,Plus you could get a keyboard and use this to make a word document!
B008DWG5HE,9,19,If You Want to Write with a Stylus This is the Tablet to Buy.
B008DWG5HE,9,20,It's also very enjoyable to use the pen instead of the finger on the touch screen and for typing on the touch-screen keyboard.
B008DWG5HE,9,21,Some drawing apps to recommend is Layerpaint and tvpaint.
B008DWG5HE,9,22,You can write notes.
B008DWG5HE,9,23,(Write and Papyrus are free apps).However, for ipad , there are better apps for drawing in general.
B008DWG5HE,9,24,This works so much better than the pens on ipads or other types of android tablets.
B008DWG5HE,10,0,Love, love, love this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,1,Love it!
B008DWG5HE,10,2,Love, love, love this tablet!

B008DWG5HE,10,22,I love it.
B008DWG5HE,10,23,Love my Note.
B008DWG5HE,10,24,love it.
B008DWG5HE,11,0,I also like that I can connect it to my computer's USB port and use it as an external hard drive.
B008DWG5HE,11,1,I purchased a portable folding Bluetooth keyboard that works great and I added a Bluetooth mouse.
B008DWG5HE,11,2,The only thing that I don't like about it is that there is no usb port.
B008DWG5HE,11,3,It will handle HDMI to a big screen and USB keyboards, mice, game controllers, external hard drives, I have have tried a 500GB external hard drive, and it should do even larger, just pickup the adapters.
B008DWG5HE,11,4,Nice Unit.
B008DWG5HE,11,5,Would of preferred a full size hdmi over the micro.
B008DWG5HE,11,6,But samsung does make keyboard dock.
B008DWG5HE,11,7,I bought an SD Card reader for $8 and hdmi adapter for $34 - hooked up a bluetooth mouse and keyboard and I can use my TV like a smart TV now.
B008DWG5HE,11,8,When I plug in a USB external hard drive to the tablet, the tablet tells me that the USB device requires too much power to operate (stick with the thumb drives, or AC adapter powered external HDDs).
B008DWG5HE,11,9,Evernote works nicely on the big screen.9.
B008DWG5HE,11,10,I also purchased a wireless keyboard for it and it works well with it.
B008DWG5HE,11,11,Battery life is great too.
B008DWG5HE,11,12,Other than that the keyboard, mouse, and traveling case were great, works without flaws.
B008DWG5HE,11,13,I love the cardboard thin Bluetooth keyboard that connects magnetically.
B008DWG5HE,11,14,Video files are easy to copy from my computer to the tablet with the provided USB cable.
B008DWG5HE,11,15,Purchased a keyboard and it is now ideal.
B008DWG5HE,11,16,I also recommend that you buy an additional power supply so that you can have a spare is case you misplace or damage the one it comes with also you will need an attachment for reading an external USB device.
B008DWG5HE,11,17,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,11,18,It does read flash drives with the attachment but it wont read my External Passport 2 Terabyte HDD.
B008DWG5HE,11,19,You can work with any bluetooth keyboard as I understand it, though I've not done so yet.
B008DWG5HE,11,20,I've found I don't use the extra ports all that much so it isn't a big deal for me.
B008DWG5HE,11,21,The added on features such as photoshop and snote are nice apps as well as the tablets version of microsoft word.Recently learned that one can connect their USB Drive to the tablet with the proper cable.
B008DWG5HE,11,22,Samsung devices each seem to require their own charger and none of them seem interchangeable at all.
B008DWG5HE,11,23,This kit provides access to many USB devices (including printers, USB sticks, keyboards, mouses and SD cards).
B008DWG5HE,11,24,along with this Tablet and the Samsung to USB interface cable as it is easy to move your movies and pictures also Doc. files to your tablet using this cable.Also I can't say enough good things about Amazons quick quality service, it is just the best.My first thoughts:The Samsung 10.1 note is just a great tablet it has a great screen up front speakers it's easy to get setup and easy to learn to use.
B008DWG5HE,12,0,No Flashplayer operation.....I wanted this instead of the Apple iPad...now its just like the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,12,1,Better than the Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,12,2,Great Product if you want an Android Operating System.
B008DWG5HE,12,3,Nice Android.
B008DWG5HE,12,4,I did not want to get an Ipad because I am not used to using Apple products.
B008DWG5HE,12,5,It is different from the iPad, but that's a good thing, I think.
B008DWG5HE,12,6,You can do much more things than with an ipad.
B008DWG5HE,12,7,As Androids to, this is the best one.
B008DWG5HE,12,8,Better than my ol' iPad!
B008DWG5HE,12,9,Great tablet!
B008DWG5HE,12,10,Looking for something better than an iPad?
B008DWG5HE,12,11,Comparing ipad 3 and this one I would say I like this better, much better!!!
B008DWG5HE,12,12,She LOVES the Android system, and the Galaxy Note 10.1 platform!
B008DWG5HE,12,13,So much better then an iPad!
B008DWG5HE,12,14,Not as good as the Ipad 3, but great.
B008DWG5HE,12,15,Tramples the Ipad (and I own both) I'm a fan of apple, and a fan of android.
B008DWG5HE,12,16,I am new to Android products, but there is no reason to go back to Apple.And it does all the other things tablets/iPads do.
B008DWG5HE,12,17,Best android Tablet I've owned.
B008DWG5HE,12,18,My wife has an ipad and I wanted an android product after reselling by Blackberry playbook, mainly because of the size of its screen.
B008DWG5HE,12,19,Since that has a windows 8 operating system and its not Android.
B008DWG5HE,12,20,I love my Galaxy Note!
B008DWG5HE,12,21,Note 10.1 does not look as nice as iPad.
B008DWG5HE,12,22,I was done with android products.
B008DWG5HE,12,23,No iPad bashing from me.
B008DWG5HE,12,24,Great Android tablet still learning the ins and outs.
B008DWG5HE,13,0,Great Product!
B008DWG5HE,13,1,Fast shipping and Good product.
B008DWG5HE,13,2,I came home and ordered it that day!
B008DWG5HE,13,3,If you are looking for a tablet for work and productivity, this is the one.
B008DWG5HE,13,4,This was my first time shopping with amazon and im really impressed, timely delivery and good customer service.
B008DWG5HE,13,5,Product is fine and I love Samsung products but seller gets 3 stars for product seal broken.
B008DWG5HE,13,6,Excellent product, good quality.
B008DWG5HE,13,7,I can't even help but cap-lock on these things, I love this product so much.
B008DWG5HE,13,8,Also the quick quality service you get from Amazon is a plus.
B008DWG5HE,13,9,I own many Samsung products, and am delighted with all.
B008DWG5HE,13,10,Productivity at home.
B008DWG5HE,13,11,Productivity at work.
B008DWG5HE,13,12,Excellent product, would recommend it to everyone, especially businessmen/women.
B008DWG5HE,13,13,I was hoping to purchase the tablet from Amazon but Costco was offering an unbeatable deal.
B008DWG5HE,13,14,Product is as described by seller.
B008DWG5HE,13,15,Wonderful Product!
B008DWG5HE,13,16,contacted and was told that its new and not refurbished item.
B008DWG5HE,13,17,Great packaging and it is being charged now.
B008DWG5HE,13,18,Delivery was before time too.
B008DWG5HE,13,19,This has to the best product I bought for 2012!!!
B008DWG5HE,13,20,By far this tablet is the best out there for productivity.
B008DWG5HE,13,21,So I didn't send it back.Great device love it my kids love it.great
B008DWG5HE,13,22,Love, love, love this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,13,23,Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs.
B008DWG5HE,13,24,Awesome Productivity Tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,0,just the right size. it does everything i want a touch screen computer to do and more.
B008DWG5HE,14,1,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,2,I have owned 8 Android Tablets and one Windows tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,3,Hasta la vista ipad....
B008DWG5HE,14,4,I find the keyboard designs on the Note 10.1 to be much better than the iPad and Windows 8 tablets.*
B008DWG5HE,14,5,With widgets, you can assign the relative size you want to the different apps you'd like to see on screen.
B008DWG5HE,14,6,this is a great device.
B008DWG5HE,14,7,I love the multi window capability.
B008DWG5HE,14,8,So much better then an iPad!
B008DWG5HE,14,9,I do wish I could use Microsoft Office on it.
B008DWG5HE,14,10,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,14,11,Better then a laptop!
B008DWG5HE,14,12,The touchpen is awesome, and being able to have several windows open at the same time is the best - every tablet should have this.
B008DWG5HE,14,13,Windows 8 Tablets - Since recent IFA Berlin showed several upcoming Windows 8 tablet, I have decided to give a quick comparison to them.3.
B008DWG5HE,14,14,We use this every day and having it compatible with our PC and other devices is great.
B008DWG5HE,14,15,Speed is great and the screen is great, I take more productivity tools over high resolution screen tablet anyday.
B008DWG5HE,14,16,Windows RT edition only runs Metro specific applications.
B008DWG5HE,14,17,It's great.
B008DWG5HE,14,18,was okay but still it could not do many things that I wanted to do.When I was about to purchase Surface Pro, one of my colleagues strongly recommended Note 10.1.He raised several issues with Surface Pro that made me try Note 10.1.1.
B008DWG5HE,14,19,Great Product!
B008DWG5HE,14,20,Awesome! why anyone would buy an iPad over this is beyond me, this thing is great.
B008DWG5HE,14,21,One:  you can only have one window of each of the compatible programs open at a time (so, you can't have two Polaris office items open at once) and there are relatively few programs that are compatible with the multiscreen.
B008DWG5HE,14,22,Great piece of hardware, but lacks software.
B008DWG5HE,14,23,Because I have an Android OS mobile phone, it would only make sense to keep streamlined with an Android OS tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,24,Among these, only Samsung Ativ Smart Pro is the only one has full HD screen that Galaxy Note 10.1 lacks.
B008DWG5HE,15,0,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B008DWG5HE,15,1,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,15,2,Fingerprints do show on the screen but no problem.
B008DWG5HE,15,3,The only thing that i would have wished more is a higher screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,4,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,15,5,The screen is bright and the colors are vibrant.
B008DWG5HE,15,6,I actually found out that it will not only run split screens plus 5 apps like I mentioned but up to 11.The screen resolution is NOT an issue at all.
B008DWG5HE,15,7,iPad 2 screen looks the same to me as Note 10.1.Galaxy
B008DWG5HE,15,8,One complaint is that the screen is VERY bright and I've not found a way to dim it.
B008DWG5HE,15,9,The screen is bright and refreshingly HD quality viewing.
B008DWG5HE,15,10,The screen is very sensitive.
B008DWG5HE,15,11,With the screen facing away from the sun, however, reflections of myself and the scenery behind me dominate the screen and make it difficult to read the text.
B008DWG5HE,15,12,Like read your email and do a web search on two separate screens yet on the same display screen.
B008DWG5HE,15,13,It is punchy with good blacks and looks plenty sharp at the normal viewing distance of a 10" screen.
B008DWG5HE,15,14,The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.
B008DWG5HE,15,15,I do wish it had a higher resolution screen just for the purpose of bragging rights.
B008DWG5HE,15,16,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B008DWG5HE,15,17,Yes, the iPad has a screen that is a bit more vibrant, but unless they are sitting side by side you will NOT notice the difference.
B008DWG5HE,15,18,Screen rotation is a bit too sensitive.
B008DWG5HE,15,19,The screen dimensions are optimal for viewing, reading, and writing--and doing all three on the go.Seriously.
B008DWG5HE,15,20,Thus, unless you are looking directly at a right angle to where the pen is touching the glass, the image on the screen does not appear where you expect it to appear.
B008DWG5HE,15,21,The display is nice and bright and the unit can be used even outside on a sunny day.
B008DWG5HE,15,22,has split screen functions, meaning you can do two things side my side at the same time.
B008DWG5HE,15,23,Also, when  viewing dark  movie scenes, the screen appears washed out around the edges, with the upper left corner appearing orangeish, the lower right corner appearing bluish, and a whitish fringe appearing all around the edges.
B008DWG5HE,15,24,The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,16,0,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,16,1,The problem with all tablets is app support.
B008DWG5HE,16,2,But, the upside is that there is an app and a fix for everything.
B008DWG5HE,16,3,I have more shortcuts to apps than I know what to do with.
B008DWG5HE,16,4,One for their store and one for their apps.
B008DWG5HE,16,5,Therefore, this tablet will not run Flash video.
B008DWG5HE,16,6,One app in particular- ironically- the AMAZON mobile app- was not available for use on the Samsung Tablets.
B008DWG5HE,16,7,There's a great selection of apps optimized for tablets from Google Play, Amazon App Store, and Samsung Apps.
B008DWG5HE,16,8,I also find the Samsungs to be every bit as intuitive as the Ipad was.Apps: There are maybe 2 apps that the Itunes store has that I "need" in the Android app market, but all of the other apps that I already purchased for my Android phone were readily and easily available for download from the Google Apps store ("PLAY").
B008DWG5HE,16,9,You will need how to install apps and visit the app store.
B008DWG5HE,16,10,Flash not supported.
B008DWG5HE,16,11,Going to the app store and loading new apps is totally painless since I never have to login to the store.
B008DWG5HE,16,12,I also didn't like how on ipad you can only line up the Apps in little rows.
B008DWG5HE,16,13,Someone needs to develop an app like Photon the one for Ipad for androids.
B008DWG5HE,16,14,October 19On the FLASH PLAYER:There are several ways to get around not having flash player.
B008DWG5HE,16,15,Great tablet but it does not support flash!
B008DWG5HE,16,16,Does not support Adobe Flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,17,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,16,18,To my dismay Adobe (the company who makes Flash video software) stopped supporting Flash for android.
B008DWG5HE,16,19,I can't get enough play time with it!!
B008DWG5HE,16,20,All the time is spent making good apps for the ibad.
B008DWG5HE,16,21,I was able to install Adobe Flash and now web pages that use Flash works.-
B008DWG5HE,16,22,While downloading apps, the Google Play Store froze on the Asus, never on the Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,16,23,One of the problems- Every time I clicked on any link/button to install flash, the device would take me to the play store and tell me flash wasn't available.I eventually found an application that requires flash, downloaded it, and let it install flash automatically, thus bypassing all automatic links to the google play store.However, once flash player is installed, it still doesn't work as well as a PC with the sites I frequent (rosetta stone, amazon).
B008DWG5HE,16,24,Did not work from google store.
B008DWG5HE,17,0,Why would anyone buy an iPad?
B008DWG5HE,17,1,Bought this over iPad and well worth the money.
B008DWG5HE,17,2,I've refrained from buying a tablet for several years now.
B008DWG5HE,17,3,I bought the Note after reading the many reviews here.
B008DWG5HE,17,4,I have purchased so many things through amazon over the last 7 or so years but this is my first review.
B008DWG5HE,17,5,But I was feeling good with my money so I decided to buy.
B008DWG5HE,17,6,would not have bought knowing this.
B008DWG5HE,17,7,I've had it now for about 3 months and it just gets better and better.
B008DWG5HE,17,8,I was iffy on buying this tablet since reviewers were kind of giving it a hard time.
B008DWG5HE,17,9,To me Apple is a niche product.
B008DWG5HE,17,10,Seven months later, after many problems,  Asus refunded my money.
B008DWG5HE,17,11,I bought my note 10.1 about 2 weeks ago and since then I have been using it all the time.
B008DWG5HE,17,12,Love this product.
B008DWG5HE,17,13,I purchased this Note as 'like new' version from the Amazon warehouse.
B008DWG5HE,17,14,I returned it in 1 month, it had similar problems.
B008DWG5HE,17,15,This device is much better than what all the reviews say.
B008DWG5HE,17,16,I almost did not purchase this device because all the reviews were so negative.
B008DWG5HE,17,17,Please read the reviews (good and bad) on every item in order to make an informed decision.Response to other reviews:Here are some notes I added to address the concerns others had when they reviewed their Notes.-KIES
B008DWG5HE,17,18,I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an android tablet.
B008DWG5HE,17,19,I didn't buy mine from Amazon as I couldn't find it on Amazon.
B008DWG5HE,17,20,I'ld say that if I had to do it again, I would have waited a few more months to see if the price came down.
B008DWG5HE,17,21,So, for my 2012 birthday, my husband "gave" me a tablet.First, I bought the new Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,17,22,I purchased this tablet to replace a IPAD.
B008DWG5HE,17,23,However I had to write this review, even after only spending half a day with it.
B008DWG5HE,17,24,If you don't want to do anything else beside these basic functions I would suggest you save some money and buy a Kindle Fire or a less expensive device.
B008DWG5HE,18,0,I let the battery die out, plugged in the charger, allowed it to fully charge before I turned it on again and then it unfroze.
B008DWG5HE,18,1,My only issue is that it takes a long time to take a full charge and does not charge rapidly enough to use while charging, but the battery life is not bad.
B008DWG5HE,18,2,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,18,3,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,18,4,The first day it died, the next day after updates on the second  day wifi issues.
B008DWG5HE,18,5,I STILL haven't got the opportunity to use it off a full 100% charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,6,It doesn't stop even long enough for me to hold down the power key and turn the device off completely.I have researched everything, and can not find anything on why it is doing this, or how to fix it!
B008DWG5HE,18,7,I can't get enough play time with it!!
B008DWG5HE,18,8,Even with continuous use, I only have to plug my tablet in to charge overnight.
B008DWG5HE,18,9,Charging time is around 3 hours if I let it go down to about 20%~30%.BUILT QUALITY:It could be better.
B008DWG5HE,18,10,Used new cable and old charger and it charged, used old cable and new charger and NO CHARGE.
B008DWG5HE,18,11,I probably use it every night and after about 6 months, I haven't had one problem.
B008DWG5HE,18,12,Long battery life as it lastsall day.
B008DWG5HE,18,13,When in standby after you hit the power button the tablet comes on in a second .
B008DWG5HE,18,14,If you attempt to charge this tablet via your computer, the tablet will show the battery icon as not charging.
B008DWG5HE,18,15,I use this thing off and on all day long and it remains in standby all day long.
B008DWG5HE,18,16,I have to charge pretty much every other day and at times daily if I use it a lot.
B008DWG5HE,18,17,I can play all day long and plug it in overnight so it's ready to go again.
B008DWG5HE,18,18,I have not timed the charging wait time, but itdoesn't seem to take long.
B008DWG5HE,18,19,I returned it in 1 month, it had similar problems.
B008DWG5HE,18,20,It does multitasking well and I can use it for two days without charging it if I don't use it excessively.
B008DWG5HE,18,21,It last about three days on a single charge and does just about everything my laptop does.
B008DWG5HE,18,22,I probably have about 100 hours of use on it so far.
B008DWG5HE,18,23,Battery live lasts for almost two days without a charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,24,It does everything I ask it to do, in a timely manner.
B008DWG5HE,19,0,Videos are full screen with front-facing stereo speakers.
B008DWG5HE,19,1,3.5mm headphone jack is on the top of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,19,2,And the sound quality and volume were excellent.
B008DWG5HE,19,3,The build quality seems fine to me.
B008DWG5HE,19,4,I am not expert on sound system, so all I cared was whether I can hear sound loud enough.
B008DWG5HE,19,5,speakers can get loud which isn't bad but when you turn the tablet from widescreen to tall screen (as I call it) I just think the tablet looks a bit weird especially since the speakers will be top and bottom and slightly to the right or left.
B008DWG5HE,19,6,I did think about getting the Asus Infinity TF700 but was hearing LOTS of flaws and Quality of the design.
B008DWG5HE,19,7,The sound is loud enough and I don't hear any popping or weird echoey noises.
B008DWG5HE,19,8,The side front facing speakers get loud.
B008DWG5HE,19,9,The audio became occasionally inoperative and the headphone jack would crackle when using my ear buds.
B008DWG5HE,19,10,I can get click sound by pressing corner, sticking button (first one was volume, second one was power).
B008DWG5HE,19,11,Some people lie about build quality and they claim it makes squeaky sound when they grap it.
B008DWG5HE,19,12,With infinity, some of my video files were only barely audible even with maximum sound setting if there are any background sounds.
B008DWG5HE,19,13,Again, the back is most likely not an issue but it does kind of feel "cheap".
B008DWG5HE,19,14,Galaxy Note 10.1 is just like others I have no problem hearing sounds.
B008DWG5HE,19,15,I can't tell any difference in quality between it and my laptop when watching the same video on both (the laptop was ~$1700 before a coupon).
B008DWG5HE,19,16,Our 4-year-old watches videos on this and, with the case we have, it's not possible to stand the tablet up for watching while it's plugged in.
B008DWG5HE,19,17,* Sound - Good, loud and scared my cat when I started something on Google Play.
B008DWG5HE,19,18,it has pretty good battery life, it also has an excellent quality sounding speakers, which i wasn't expecting on any tablet.
B008DWG5HE,19,19,Now that it's in a case the build quality doesn't matter any more.
B008DWG5HE,19,20,She looked around like she does when our surround sound is on because she doesn't understand what was making such a noise.
B008DWG5HE,19,21,The device is very well made, and the plastic is not low quality, but it doesn't have the feel and heft of an aluminium device that I prefer.
B008DWG5HE,19,22,I think it will be fine but Samsung always seems to have some quality issues which some of their great products which I just do not understand.
B008DWG5HE,19,23,The only thing that i would have wished more is a higher screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,19,24,I seriously disagree with the reviews about the build quality as I simply find them completely untrue.
B008DWG5HE,20,0,I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet.
B008DWG5HE,20,1,But if you are working with it alone you will see that it is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.The camera is by far one of the weakest things in the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,2,The picture and video quality are even better than expected.
B008DWG5HE,20,3,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,4,I then realized this happens mostly for apps that use the front facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,5,It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something.
B008DWG5HE,20,6,Both the front 1.9MP camera and 5MP camera fully live up to their specs.
B008DWG5HE,20,7,It seems required for any portable device to have a camera nowadays, and both front and back are there, but the photos aren't great.
B008DWG5HE,20,8,The lack of that last star is for slight difference in screen quality.
B008DWG5HE,20,9,* Cameras - Amazon removed the images I posted for some reason so just take my word that the cameras work well.
B008DWG5HE,20,10,Pictures and videos are stunning.
B008DWG5HE,20,11,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,12,NEVER had a laptop that lasted more than 3 hours of heavy useIt also includes Blue Tooth, GPS, in addition to the front facing camera it also sports a 5MP rear facing auto focus camera with a FLASH (sorry Ipad).Audio recording blew me away.
B008DWG5HE,20,13,The camera is very, very mediocre.
B008DWG5HE,20,14,I personally would never use a tablet to take pictures, but if i did, i would be very disappointed.
B008DWG5HE,20,15,The first thing that stuck out to me were the speakers being in the front, rather than the rear.
B008DWG5HE,20,16,apps are easy to use and the camera front and rear are as good as other in it category.
B008DWG5HE,20,17,Kies is great and works just as well with photos.
B008DWG5HE,20,18,I never expected it to be as good as it is.
B008DWG5HE,20,19,I guess it make sense for these apps to not allow you to use the Note upside down, otherwise your camera output to apps such as Skype would result in your face showing upside down to the person you would be chatting with at the time.
B008DWG5HE,20,20,only did 4 stars for two reasons....disappointed that the camera is only 5 mega pixels and now & then when I'm using this I wish it could do something (can't remember what at the moment) that it doesn't do.Over all I'm really happy with this device.
B008DWG5HE,20,21,Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great.
B008DWG5HE,20,22,Video chatting works great as well.
B008DWG5HE,20,23,This tablet was the best rated and it has lived up to its rating.
B008DWG5HE,20,24,Like with anything else not Apple, the people you know will find some reason to think it's not as good as their beloved Apple.
B008DWG5HE,21,0,Even better than expected...
B008DWG5HE,21,1,Slow OS updating.
B008DWG5HE,21,2,It was far faster at running the same software than the Asus TF700T was.-
B008DWG5HE,21,3,These key differentiators plus the power of a 1.4 Ghz Quad Core and 2 GB of RAM deciding to buy this tablet is a no brainer!
B008DWG5HE,21,4,Samsung is also pretty bad at releasing updates to new android firmware, but those things can be worked around.For me it came down to the Asus Transformer Prime, the Note 10.1, and the iPad wasn't really even in the running.
B008DWG5HE,21,5,Let me start by saying I had low expectations for the S Note app.
B008DWG5HE,21,6,That said, the way android performs on this tablet, it's quite capable without x86!
B008DWG5HE,21,7,It was slow, it lagged.
B008DWG5HE,21,8,Comparing the Nexus 7, Asus Infinity TF700T, and Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,21,9,The OS was fast at first but as I added Apps it got slower and choppy.
B008DWG5HE,21,10,I hope my review helps anyone still undecided about purchasing the Samsung Note 10.1.I bought the Google Nexus 7, the Asus Transformer Infinity TF700T, and the Samsung Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,21,11,I did a hard set twice and it came back as fast as new but it would slow again as I added Apps back in.
B008DWG5HE,21,12,You could buy a large version of one of those for the same price as this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,21,13,I'd rather have the dual-core processor crunching my input, than being eaten up just to make the screen resolution "better".
B008DWG5HE,21,14,you could do it, but for having a quad-core processor, the keyboard doesn't respond very quickly and i have had lots of accuracy issues with it.
B008DWG5HE,21,15,What really sold me on the Note was the hardware: 1.4 GHz QUAD-core processor and 2GB of RAM.
B008DWG5HE,21,16,I have had 2 other Android tablets in the past, the Acer Iconia A500 and the Asus Transformer TF101.
B008DWG5HE,21,17,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,21,18,I have bought a number of tablet styli for other tablets but have been generally disappointed with their performance.
B008DWG5HE,21,19,Android OS fragmentation aside, I was eyeballing the Nexus 10 before purchasing the Note because I hate most android mods.
B008DWG5HE,21,20,The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time.
B008DWG5HE,21,21,A seriously overlooked android tablet that regularly outperforms my friends window's 8 machine.It feels like it's from the future six months after I bought it.I bought this tablet for the quad core 1.4 processor and GPU, and the specs altogether, but it was the S Note application together with S Pen that inclined me to the write this glowing review.
B008DWG5HE,21,22,So it is only helpful when opening multiple applications i.e. you may be able to cache more application than before but otherwise, I am not sure if this helps much.Screen: Transformer Infinity - See above.In any event, both hardwares are the best in the market right now.
B008DWG5HE,21,23,The Nexus 10 was next on my list because of the nice screen plus un-modified Android UI/OS/more regular updates.
B008DWG5HE,21,24,Conclusion ==================Update 9/15/2012Galaxy Note 10.1 is phenomenal device with its stability, speed, and extra function of S-pen.Galaxy Note and Transformer Infinity are definitely two of the best Android tablet on the market at this time.
B008DWG5HE,22,0,While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-
B008DWG5HE,22,1,With the app you can see your files and download them into the tablet from the card or drive.
B008DWG5HE,22,2,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,3,Also, with their mini-sd drive (I bought the SD 64 gb card) you can put music on there if you didn't want to use Kies.
B008DWG5HE,22,4,All the free android apps and I was able to install Flash Player!!!!! Its wonderful to be able to have an SD card as well.
B008DWG5HE,22,5,you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory?
B008DWG5HE,22,6,My only complaint is that you can not transfer apps to the SD card, but I am hoping Samsung will fix this in the next update.
B008DWG5HE,22,7,You cannot use Apps2SD, for example, to move apps from the Note's built-in memory to an external SD card without *rooting the device.
B008DWG5HE,22,8,There is an expansion slot (up to 32GB only) and I popped in the Sandisk 32GB card.
B008DWG5HE,22,9,It accessed the SD card witout any issues.
B008DWG5HE,22,10,Make sure to get a 32gig micro SD card, to expand the memory.
B008DWG5HE,22,11,I purchased a 32GB micro SD card to increase storage space for my videos.
B008DWG5HE,22,12,When I downloaded a 3.5gb game, it asked me if I wanted to save to external SD instead of on-board memory (YES!).
B008DWG5HE,22,13,I did purchased an additional 64 sd card for it and it stores so much more now.I strongly recommend the additional 64 Gig memory module, unless your going to get the ATIV which is a whole different concept.
B008DWG5HE,22,14,I wanted a SD card slot for additional storage.
B008DWG5HE,22,15,You CAN use a 64gb card in it (I have the 32gb Galaxy Note 10.1), so I can store twice as many movies and music.
B008DWG5HE,22,16,But if you are just getting your Note, i would suggest waiting until you get the update before using the card so you can just use the exFAT format.My particular card is a Sandisk "MobileUltra" SDXC card with a Class10 rating.
B008DWG5HE,22,17,Another great feature is that even though this device comes with 32 GB internal memory, I can insert a 64 GB card.
B008DWG5HE,22,18,This was a major concern as the tablet could accept a 64gb micro SD card for expansion and would lend itself to installing more apps in the future.
B008DWG5HE,22,19,Apps can only install on default memory*.
B008DWG5HE,22,20,Took a long time researching tablet options...I was looking for more than 16gb and ability to use expanded memory via sd cards.
B008DWG5HE,22,21,I did some reading and decided on the 16GB since the tablet has space for ample expansion, and you can get a far larger micro SD card for the $50 difference- I got the 64GB SanDisk class 10 one.
B008DWG5HE,22,22,as of now (one thing to note is if you get an error - firmware was modified outside and so no updates will be possible, then you need to remove the SD card and retry and it will be fine.
B008DWG5HE,22,23,Expandable Storage.*
B008DWG5HE,22,24,I don't recommend buying the 32gb version because this has a Micro SD slot for extra storage space up to 64gb.
B008DWG5HE,23,0,Connect to the wireless router.
B008DWG5HE,23,1,They are all set up on our wireless network.
B008DWG5HE,23,2,This tablet wastes no time in connecting to any available wireless network and does whatever is asked of it.
B008DWG5HE,23,3,I also connect to multiple WiFi networks at work and other locations and never have an issue trying to connect.-
B008DWG5HE,23,4,It connects quickly and hasn't had any issues.
B008DWG5HE,23,5,My girlfriend has taken video footage with her phone (an Apple phone, that she has never had a problem with she says) of this device freaking out for minutes on end.
B008DWG5HE,23,6,I access the internet via wifi and it has worked flawlessly.
B008DWG5HE,23,7,Has some issues.
B008DWG5HE,23,8,I use to have an IPAD with 3G and found it more expensive than using the WiFi with a hotspot device.
B008DWG5HE,23,9,It connects easily and works just like it should.
B008DWG5HE,23,10,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,23,11,It stays connected well to my wi-fi, which is never more than 50 feet away in any room I choose to be in at home.
B008DWG5HE,23,12,Wi-fi is incredibly strong in areas of my home where other devices have weak signals.
B008DWG5HE,23,13,their is no lag what so ever it long lasting no problems what so ever.
B008DWG5HE,23,14,The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router.
B008DWG5HE,23,15,It connects to any Wi-Fi network almost immediately and the GPS works even inside closed buildings.
B008DWG5HE,23,16,I have NO perfomance issues.... everything works very smooth.... not sure where some of the reviews on the web state that it is slow..... whatever...
B008DWG5HE,23,17,From that outlook, it is better than the Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,23,18,* Wifi - No complaints.
B008DWG5HE,23,19,This device is much better than what all the reviews say.
B008DWG5HE,23,20,It runs smoothly and quickly.It finds and connects to wifi easily.
B008DWG5HE,23,21,Not as good as the Ipad 3, but great.
B008DWG5HE,23,22,This alone makes this device.Performance....
B008DWG5HE,23,23,I have 5 Note 10.1 and 3 IPads.
B008DWG5HE,23,24,The first day it died, the next day after updates on the second  day wifi issues.
B008DWG5HE,24,0,We can't do anything on it, we can't even get to the home screen without it going nuts.
B008DWG5HE,24,1,The touch screen is great.-the
B008DWG5HE,24,2,screen keyboard is customizable.
B008DWG5HE,24,3,I feel like that is space that can be used for placing more icons or something but when you touch the empty space the home screen will go the next screen over.
B008DWG5HE,24,4,I often have to press screen buttons multiple times to get it to register.-
B008DWG5HE,24,5,There are times when you press a button or select something with the pen and it does not register, and you have to press a second time.-
B008DWG5HE,24,6,I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.Bad things (I think)-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful.
B008DWG5HE,24,7,thing to note about the screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,8,It's also very enjoyable to use the pen instead of the finger on the touch screen and for typing on the touch-screen keyboard.
B008DWG5HE,24,9,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,10,iPad 2 screen looks the same to me as Note 10.1.Galaxy
B008DWG5HE,24,11,The touch screen is extremely sensitive and it takes only the slightest of touch to registeryour input.
B008DWG5HE,24,12,If you put a magnet near a spot on the screen (for example: if your tablet case/folio has a magnet for attaching a strap to it, and you then fold the folio so that the magnet is behind your tablet and behind the screen within 1 cm), the S-Pen's position will not match what shows up on the screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,13,I purchased the iPad 2 when it was released and owned that for about 10 months before it fell and the screen cracked.
B008DWG5HE,24,14,The touchscreen keyboard goes nuts with ghost typing; it opens and closes programs, goes from one page to the other, and has acutally changed settings as well.
B008DWG5HE,24,15,When you are at the home screens, there is like a literal inch on both the left and right sides of the screen where you cannot place apps or anything.
B008DWG5HE,24,16,The response of both the S-Pen and touch screen are great.
B008DWG5HE,24,17,Someone would think that a 10 inch wide screen is hard to type on.
B008DWG5HE,24,18,It can be a big keyboard, a small keyboard that you can drag anywhere on the screen, or a split up keyboard that has half of a keyboard on one side of the screen and the other half on the other side.
B008DWG5HE,24,19,Not as good as Alt+Tab, but a close secondBLUETOOTH KEYBOARDI think a bluetooth keyboard is a must.
B008DWG5HE,24,20,I am a avid typer (can you tell by the length of my article?), but for typing I was satisfied with using the touch screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,21,Until I discovered the "Null Keyboard" app, I wasn't happy with the interaction between the two devices because the on-screen keyboard would pop up whenever I tapped a text box.
B008DWG5HE,24,22,Without a case, I feel like I am going to drop it..I would recommend this product to anyone who wants the ability to write instead of type on a keyboard..
B008DWG5HE,24,23,It doesn't stop even long enough for me to hold down the power key and turn the device off completely.I have researched everything, and can not find anything on why it is doing this, or how to fix it!
B008DWG5HE,24,24,The S-Pen works using magnetic inductance, and therefore, magnets that are within 1 or 2 centimeters of the screen can affect the proper functioning of the S-Pen.
B008DWG5HE,25,0,Wish I would have gone with the I-Pad.
B008DWG5HE,25,1,Bye bye Apple Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,2,iPad isn't.
B008DWG5HE,25,3,This tablet makes the iPad obsolete.
B008DWG5HE,25,4,And it has everything that my Ipad has.
B008DWG5HE,25,5,It can do everything the iPad can do, and more.
B008DWG5HE,25,6,I also didn't like how on ipad you can only line up the Apps in little rows.
B008DWG5HE,25,7,iPad 2 screen looks the same to me as Note 10.1.Galaxy
B008DWG5HE,25,8,Not possible with ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,9,Why would anyone buy an iPad?
B008DWG5HE,25,10,I have an Ipad as well as this Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,11,I would rather have all Samsung Note  10.1's then I would Ipads.
B008DWG5HE,25,12,To me Apple is a niche product.
B008DWG5HE,25,13,I have an iPad 2 as well.
B008DWG5HE,25,14,I have an iPad 3 also and it's something it can never do.
B008DWG5HE,25,15,From that outlook, it is better than the Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,16,More so than my iPad in every way.
B008DWG5HE,25,17,I debated for a while between the ipad and the samsung galaxy note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,18,I have 5 Note 10.1 and 3 IPads.
B008DWG5HE,25,19,This device is much better than what all the reviews say.
B008DWG5HE,25,20,Samsung's time has come.
B008DWG5HE,25,21,This device runs Android 2.3.
B008DWG5HE,25,22,So far I think it has everything the ipad had and then some!!
B008DWG5HE,25,23,Even on the iPad 2, I still had at least 1 or 2 freeze/crush every other day or so.
B008DWG5HE,25,24,This device is very similar to the Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,26,0,Used new cable and old charger and it charged, used old cable and new charger and NO CHARGE.
B008DWG5HE,26,1,My Note stopped charging with both AC charger and through USB.
B008DWG5HE,26,2,Mainly, when I try and charge the Note while using it, the charging cable fits into the bottom of the device.
B008DWG5HE,26,3,Wish it used micro usb rather than proprietary data connection.
B008DWG5HE,26,4,I can connect other non-Samsung devices to my tablet so I don't have to buy proprietary adapters.
B008DWG5HE,26,5,When I plug in a USB external hard drive to the tablet, the tablet tells me that the USB device requires too much power to operate (stick with the thumb drives, or AC adapter powered external HDDs).
B008DWG5HE,26,6,The propriety SAMSUNG plug is BS but has faster charging than micro USB.
B008DWG5HE,26,7,Minus another for that port being for a proprietary power plug.
B008DWG5HE,26,8,You can transfer files but the power output from standard USB ports is not strong enough to power the Note.
B008DWG5HE,26,9,I even tried connecting the tablet to the USB adapter to a USB SD card reader and finally to an SD card.
B008DWG5HE,26,10,To plug a flash/thumb drive directly into the Note 10.1 you have to buy a adapter.
B008DWG5HE,26,11,Using both new adapter and cable my Note charged flawlessly.
B008DWG5HE,26,12,Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such.
B008DWG5HE,26,13,Apparently the output from a PC USB port isn't enough to charge the Note (which I can understand).
B008DWG5HE,26,14,I also like that I can connect it to my computer's USB port and use it as an external hard drive.
B008DWG5HE,26,15,Just be aware, you will NOT be able to charge this baby by simply plugging the charging cable into the USB port of your computer.
B008DWG5HE,26,16,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,26,17,The cable gets mashed on the bottom of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,26,18,I will, however, note that the utter lack of external ports is disappointing.
B008DWG5HE,26,19,When I try to charge it from a source that doesn't provide enough power (it needs 5v 2A), the tablet tells me that it is receiving inadequate power.
B008DWG5HE,26,20,I would expect proprietary connectors as part of the draconian iApple ecosystem, but Android devices should all have standard USB ports and separate power sockets.
B008DWG5HE,26,21,The charging cable that comes with the unit is very short and does not let you charge the unit while using it unless you sit next to the wall outlet.
B008DWG5HE,26,22,This kit provides access to many USB devices (including printers, USB sticks, keyboards, mouses and SD cards).
B008DWG5HE,26,23,Female USB OTG adapter) which allows you to hook up a flash card reader or a USB thumb drive to your tablet.
B008DWG5HE,26,24,I ordered several replacement cables (Note to charger/USB) and a new AC adapter.
B008DWG5HE,27,0,Can be frustrating to learn at that time without a "manual" of sorts, to help out in some respects!
B008DWG5HE,27,1,It does seem to be kind of slow at times and it can lock up easily.
B008DWG5HE,27,2,The problems can be fixed.I recommend this tablet if you can take the time to learn it.
B008DWG5HE,27,3,I can't find a decent manual either  the built in help is very weak.
B008DWG5HE,27,4,I don' know how easy it is to delete things I'll never need, if I can delete at all.
B008DWG5HE,27,5,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,27,6,The settings very intuitive, never had to open the manual once.
B008DWG5HE,27,7,It has not slowed down and handles mulitasking extremely well.
B008DWG5HE,27,8,Having to learn all its quirks and options (especially with the stylus) requires a long and steep learning curve, there are absolutely no instructions, so prepare for having to google for just about anything a bit more sophisticated you want to do.
B008DWG5HE,27,9,Again, zero need for a manual.
B008DWG5HE,27,10,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,27,11,Manuals and guides are virtually non-existent for the Note and the built in apps.
B008DWG5HE,27,12,I also upgraded the OS to 4.1.2
B008DWG5HE,27,13,Want to turn off apps?
B008DWG5HE,27,14,So if you tether and drive around, your car icon on the map will not get updated till about every minute or so.
B008DWG5HE,27,15,I find this annoying.
B008DWG5HE,27,16,I couldn't figure out how to delete the accidentally created 7 home screens.
B008DWG5HE,27,17,All the time is spent making good apps for the ibad.
B008DWG5HE,27,18,You have to turn it off a lot to get it to work.
B008DWG5HE,27,19,The problem with all tablets is app support.
B008DWG5HE,27,20,Great Product if you want an Android Operating System.
B008DWG5HE,27,21,Not bad if you know Android, but could be intimidating for novice users.
B008DWG5HE,27,22,The first day it died, the next day after updates on the second  day wifi issues.
B008DWG5HE,27,23,Note 10.1 WiFi model HAS GPS radio hardware.
B008DWG5HE,27,24,Although, this does not seem to affect the productivity of the product, you can still easily switch from one app to another without the tablet getting stuck or becoming slow.
B008DWG5HE,28,0,According to Samsung customer service it wont be unblocked any time soon.
B008DWG5HE,28,1,To me Apple is a niche product.
B008DWG5HE,28,2,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B008DWG5HE,28,3,I hope I don't have any warranty issues...
B008DWG5HE,28,4,Samsung's time has come.
B008DWG5HE,28,5,My girlfriend has taken video footage with her phone (an Apple phone, that she has never had a problem with she says) of this device freaking out for minutes on end.
B008DWG5HE,28,6,Samsung is impossible to contact regarding these issues and when you find a way to contact them you may never get an answer, at least I didn't.
B008DWG5HE,28,7,Note10.1 and Amazon response.
B008DWG5HE,28,8,NOT HAPPY!!!! Got a defective product!
B008DWG5HE,28,9,I used all three of them several times a day for a period of three weeks.
B008DWG5HE,28,10,I rated it 3 stars, because I am sure it's an ok product, but the one we got is a HUGE disappointment, especially coming from Samsung!!!I have already emailed the company that I bought it from, hopefully they step up and help me out, because a lot of money was paid for a dud product!
B008DWG5HE,28,11,It's Samsung time now.
B008DWG5HE,28,12,Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs.
B008DWG5HE,28,13,Way to go Amazon.
B008DWG5HE,28,14,I received a new tablet 24 hours later.
B008DWG5HE,28,15,In the past few years I have purchased washer/dryers, plasma TVs, cell phones, refrigerators, all Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,28,16,I guess I will again have to hunt for myself to see if I can find specs.I don't know whether Samsung is inexperienced in the tablet world and their customer service isn't up to speed, or they are reacting to all the litigation issues with Apple, or both, but I'm disappointed that I'm having to figure things out myself.
B008DWG5HE,28,17,Never a problem with anything and prompt customer support (I needed one time cause I didn't realize I had not removed the hold down drum bolts to my washer when setting it up...stupid me).
B008DWG5HE,28,18,You also cannot customize your screens.
B008DWG5HE,28,19,I ordered this tablet immediately when Amazon posted it with 1-day shipping and as of 7/20/2013 I haven't had any issues as a few users seem to have reported.
B008DWG5HE,28,20,I can't understand why there are so many Apple devotees when Samsung offers a stellar product.
B008DWG5HE,28,21,The first day it died, the next day after updates on the second  day wifi issues.
B008DWG5HE,28,22,Seven months later, after many problems,  Asus refunded my money.
B008DWG5HE,28,23,Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned.
B008DWG5HE,28,24,So, Samsung's Customer Service leaves MUCH to be desired, BUT the Note is a fabulous device that I grow to like more each day.
B008DWG5HE,29,0,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,29,1,Can resize app windows and relocate.5.
B008DWG5HE,29,2,I'm sure time will cure that issue.
B008DWG5HE,29,3,Instead, if you want to make a window disappear from the screen, you have to close the app appearing in the window.
B008DWG5HE,29,4,I'll update my review later after that update to let y'all know what I observe.
B008DWG5HE,29,5,Switching from one window to another merely requires a tap on the window you want to work in.
B008DWG5HE,29,6,And if you can't find your window, just hit the windows icon on the bottom and it shows a list of open windows.
B008DWG5HE,29,7,I am also disappointed that you can't shrink windows down to a single bar at the bottom of the screen like you can in Microsoft Windows for PC.
B008DWG5HE,29,8,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,29,9,I installed it because my Windows 7 PC would not properly identify my Note until KIES was installed.
B008DWG5HE,29,10,It's just little things that I've noticed: the ink having a tad bit of lag as it "flows" onto the screen as you write.
B008DWG5HE,29,11,Lots of apps already installed.
B008DWG5HE,29,12,Weird things like when the screen was locked and I rotated the tablet there would be a flash of the home screen or one of the programs running in the background.
B008DWG5HE,29,13,I will update as I get more with my Note in the future.FYI: I am an expert in windows and linux.
B008DWG5HE,29,14,I did a hard set twice and it came back as fast as new but it would slow again as I added Apps back in.
B008DWG5HE,29,15,For a number of apps, you can use split screen, resize windows, etc.
B008DWG5HE,29,16,Unfortunately, only selected apps will work in the multi-window system.
B008DWG5HE,29,17,It will automatically tile two windows side-by-side, and you can adjust the proportion of the screen that each inhabits.
B008DWG5HE,29,18,The touch screen is extremely sensitive and it takes only the slightest of touch to registeryour input.
B008DWG5HE,29,19,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,29,20,I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.Bad things (I think)-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful.
B008DWG5HE,29,21,has split screen functions, meaning you can do two things side my side at the same time.
B008DWG5HE,29,22,Web pages loading time is fast but not nearly as fast as my laptop.
B008DWG5HE,29,23,There are times when you press a button or select something with the pen and it does not register, and you have to press a second time.-
B008DWG5HE,29,24,Or, you can detach them and move them around, adjust their size, and have a third app running in another window in the background as well.

B00CYQPM42,0,22,love my Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,0,23,Kindle Fire HDX.
B00CYQPM42,0,24,The Kindle HDX Has everything she wanted in a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,1,0,Not enough apps.
B00CYQPM42,1,1,not playing videos.
B00CYQPM42,1,2,There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation.
B00CYQPM42,1,3,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,1,4,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,1,5,They do not play.
B00CYQPM42,1,6,I'm really enjoying all the Apps and playing "Candycrush"!
B00CYQPM42,1,7,They play games on it too.
B00CYQPM42,1,8,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,1,9,Now, whenever possible, I'm going to download the movie to my tablet, and then watch it from the download.
B00CYQPM42,1,10,Now we can both play the games.
B00CYQPM42,1,11,my daughter really wanted the furby boom app for her furby and we found out later it was only available through google play..
B00CYQPM42,1,12,It also have more free games to download.
B00CYQPM42,1,13,The only downfall is no Google play store access.
B00CYQPM42,1,14,I have found many useful lifestyle apps (food diaries, calorie counters, etc).
B00CYQPM42,1,15,Also if i want to install google apps it is possible.
B00CYQPM42,1,16,You know there HAS to be an app for that!
B00CYQPM42,1,17,I watch movies on netflix.
B00CYQPM42,1,18,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,1,19,Kids will love it as they can read books, play games, watch TV and movies, and a whole lot of other things.
B00CYQPM42,1,20,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,1,21,I also love to download Prime videos for later.
B00CYQPM42,1,22,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,1,23,I really like my Kindle, especially I can get books on free to read and play games which I don't have to use really money.
B00CYQPM42,1,24,I bought this kindle so I could watch my movies, read my books.
B00CYQPM42,2,0,Got it at a great price

B00CYQPM42,3,0,Battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,1,battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,2,aweful battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,3,battery doesn't last.
B00CYQPM42,3,4,The battery life is much longer.
B00CYQPM42,3,5,Already went threw the hints on how to save battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,6,The battery life is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,3,7,Battery life is pretty good.
B00CYQPM42,3,8,Everything works great, but the battery life is not nearly as long as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,3,9,Not to happy with the battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,10,Have to charge it almost every day.
B00CYQPM42,3,11,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,12,Battery life is great so far.-
B00CYQPM42,3,13,Battery life is ok - probably need to recharge every other day with normal use.
B00CYQPM42,3,14,Battery life is not as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,3,15,Light weightBattery life is over 10 hours.
B00CYQPM42,3,16,And the battery life is the best I have ever had.
B00CYQPM42,3,17,The lousy battery life is my main complaint, however.
B00CYQPM42,3,18,Seems battery doesn't last as long as first kindle.
B00CYQPM42,3,19,My previous kindle charged quickly even in use and had an amazing battery life!
B00CYQPM42,3,20,I expected the battery to last much longer.
B00CYQPM42,3,21,There are battery savers that shut down what isn’t needed and does make a difference in battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,22,One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge.
B00CYQPM42,3,23,Holds its charge well.
B00CYQPM42,3,24,Does not hold it's charge.
B00CYQPM42,4,0,Sound good.
B00CYQPM42,4,1,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,2,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,4,3,This feels really good in your hand and the screen is BEAUTIFUL.
B00CYQPM42,4,4,I feel like the hd speakers are a little better than this, but not much.
B00CYQPM42,4,5,Sound is really good (not home theater quality or anything) but better than any phone I've heard.
B00CYQPM42,4,6,The HD quality is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,7,Clear picture, quality sound.
B00CYQPM42,4,8,very nice apps, the resolution and sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,9,The sound is also much better and louder.
B00CYQPM42,4,10,The sound while listening to audiobooks and movies is very good.
B00CYQPM42,4,11,found the speakers to have decent sound.
B00CYQPM42,4,12,I have an iPad with one speaker n the Kindle sounds a lot better.
B00CYQPM42,4,13,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,4,14,And the sound!
B00CYQPM42,4,15,Decent sound
B00CYQPM42,4,16,The built in speakers are also better than my iPad 1.
B00CYQPM42,4,17,Really great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,18,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,19,The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.
B00CYQPM42,4,20,better picture and the sound is amazing!
B00CYQPM42,4,21,I would tell anyone that this is a great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,22,The color is amazing and the sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,23,The kindle display is good and the speakers are terrific for such a small device.
B00CYQPM42,4,24,The screen is fantastic and the speakers produce great sound that is fairly loud.
B00CYQPM42,5,0,this is not good because it does not seem you can take a picture of something you are looking at.
B00CYQPM42,5,1,Takes great pictures!
B00CYQPM42,5,2,Very Clear Screen.
B00CYQPM42,5,3,Good size screen and colors.
B00CYQPM42,5,4,I did not like the way the camera was.
B00CYQPM42,5,5,I also don't like the front only camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,6,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,7,The picture quality is absurd.
B00CYQPM42,5,8,Picture is clear, color is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,9,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,10,I don't like just front camera ure feature..rather, I prefer rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,11,The camera on the 7" is fine for Skype, but it is very disconcerting to use it for anything else.
B00CYQPM42,5,12,The only camera is on the front side (screen side), so taking video or a picture with it is difficult because you can't see the screen.
B00CYQPM42,5,13,It could only be more perfect if it had a front facing camera!
B00CYQPM42,5,14,The built in camera is so nice and takes anexcellent picture.
B00CYQPM42,5,15,great.
B00CYQPM42,5,16,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,5,17,she does however have a problem with the camera part, apparently you can only take pictures that are facing the front of the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,5,18,The camera is awesome...
B00CYQPM42,5,19,My only love about it is the camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,20,The camera could be a little better, but very nice to be able to Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,21,Love the clear, crisp picture.
B00CYQPM42,5,22,Very easy to use and the picture quality is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,5,23,The screen displays are crisp and easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,5,24,Image is very good.
B00CYQPM42,6,0,The processor is fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,1,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,6,2,A great tablet at a great price.
B00CYQPM42,6,3,Great tablet at a great price...
B00CYQPM42,6,4,Awesome screen.
B00CYQPM42,6,5,Fast, very fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,6,Great value!
B00CYQPM42,6,7,The screen is beautiful and it is incredibly fast!
B00CYQPM42,6,8,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,6,9,Amazing, Fast, Beautiful display.
B00CYQPM42,6,10,Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.
B00CYQPM42,6,11,Very nice display
B00CYQPM42,6,12,The improved 'carousel' and apps screen is also a nice improvement.
B00CYQPM42,6,13,like he says, it does it all, and the graphics are great and so easy to take along wherever you go.
B00CYQPM42,6,14,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,6,15,The screen is just beautiful.
B00CYQPM42,6,16,Display is amazingly sharp, and the android OS is very fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,17,This is a great device at an exceptional price.
B00CYQPM42,6,18,The graphics are great.
B00CYQPM42,6,19,This thing is great!
B00CYQPM42,6,20,The unit has a lovely display, it's responsive and a great overall tablet.
B00CYQPM42,6,21,The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD.
B00CYQPM42,6,22,Great Value for Optimal Performance.
B00CYQPM42,6,23,First things first; the screen!
B00CYQPM42,6,24,It's extremely faster now, light weight, the screen is amazingly clear.
B00CYQPM42,7,0,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,7,1,She has so much more storage space.
B00CYQPM42,7,2,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,7,3,However, this tablet is so much faster and with the 64 GB of storage I can do so much more.
B00CYQPM42,7,4,The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB.
B00CYQPM42,7,5,MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229.
B00CYQPM42,7,6,Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover.
B00CYQPM42,7,7,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,7,8,64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB.
B00CYQPM42,7,9,In this day and age, a table ought to have a Micro SD memory card slot for expansion, and an HDMI connector - ESPECIALLY a media tablet like these!
B00CYQPM42,7,10,too many slot pop ups.
B00CYQPM42,7,11,vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video.
B00CYQPM42,7,12,Then the iPad Mini came out and I really wanted one!
B00CYQPM42,7,13,Bought this for my spouse and he loves it.
B00CYQPM42,7,14,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,7,15,Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality.
B00CYQPM42,7,16,I don't think its a great buy for the price, yes the specs are great however the new Google nexus tablet is the same price for 32gb a frontal and back camera along with HD viewing capabilities.
B00CYQPM42,7,17,To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80.
B00CYQPM42,7,18,If you're not sold on the reigning king of the tablet space, this is a good option for most users.
B00CYQPM42,7,19,This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size.
B00CYQPM42,7,20,GB) of storage per hour.
B00CYQPM42,7,21,I got the 32 GB version, so there is plenty of room for games and other apps.
B00CYQPM42,7,22,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,7,23,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,7,24,The fact that the device does not support storage expansion.
B00CYQPM42,8,0,Good device.
B00CYQPM42,8,1,Love It!! What a great device!!
B00CYQPM42,8,2,Great for watching movies and surfing the web.
B00CYQPM42,8,3,I have an iPad 2 and really don't like it for reading.
B00CYQPM42,8,4,It's easy to use and provides a high-quality experience for reading e-Books, browsing the Internet and watching video.
B00CYQPM42,8,5,Also love Fashioning and web surfing on it.
B00CYQPM42,8,6,I use it for not only reading but gaming, email, and surfing the net.
B00CYQPM42,8,7,It works very well for music, reading docucuments and general web page browsing mhm habit video watching I is quite unreliable.
B00CYQPM42,8,8,I'm sure that there are many more things I can do with it besides read books, but need to take the time to work with it.
B00CYQPM42,8,9,I did have a problem with it not reading books I had already purchased (DRM problem).
B00CYQPM42,8,10,Is an easy way to surf trough internet.
B00CYQPM42,8,11,Good browser.
B00CYQPM42,8,12,Great Tablet.
B00CYQPM42,8,13,I read and write email, surf the web, read and listen to books and watch videos.
B00CYQPM42,8,14,I bought the tablet so I could watch my television shows while I eat without having to hall around my laptop around.
B00CYQPM42,8,15,It's very easy to use, and I like being able to read books and the Bible on it.
B00CYQPM42,8,16,This is a great device at an exceptional price.
B00CYQPM42,8,17,Regardless if your looking for something to watch Netflix on, read books, and surf the web it's excellent.
B00CYQPM42,8,18,It's all new to us  not like our laptop but good for reading The mayday button is the best thing I ever seem in any device I have used can't believe it's so easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,8,19,Had no issues with replacing the previous kindle.It is a great entertainment device.
B00CYQPM42,8,20,Great for reading books and the w-fi feature makes it very handy.
B00CYQPM42,8,21,Nice device.
B00CYQPM42,8,22,I bought this kindle so I could watch my movies, read my books.
B00CYQPM42,8,23,I use my Kindle for web surfing, reading, watching an occasional movie.
B00CYQPM42,8,24,I can check my email and go to Facebook instead of always going to my computer.
B00CYQPM42,9,0,I am using it to write this review, actually.
B00CYQPM42,9,1,The notepad app. is a nice feature.
B00CYQPM42,9,2,The touch sceen on the iPad also works a lot smoother and is more accurate.
B00CYQPM42,9,3,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,9,4,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,9,5,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,9,6,Did not realize all the Apps available for this tablet and functionality this tablet provides.
B00CYQPM42,9,7,I normally don't write reviews, even when I like something.
B00CYQPM42,9,8,I keep finding things that  I didn't know were there.
B00CYQPM42,9,9,It also feels better in the hand then other tablets.As with all non-iOS products, it doesn't have all of the apps or usability that I'd like, but that will come with time.
B00CYQPM42,9,10,It's ways to buy apps.
B00CYQPM42,9,11,So far I like it very much but find that it does not give great directions for how to use some of its features.
B00CYQPM42,9,12,files, you may not find all the apps you want or need - at this time.
B00CYQPM42,9,13,I love the ability to highlight, write notes, etc. on books and PDF files.
B00CYQPM42,9,14,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,9,15,I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).
B00CYQPM42,9,16,I love the predictive keyboard, which to me is similar to my iPad minis, because I can make a lot of mistakes typing quickly.
B00CYQPM42,9,17,But I LOVE THIS THING!
B00CYQPM42,9,18,The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen.
B00CYQPM42,9,19,Otherwise this product is great!
B00CYQPM42,9,20,What I do like is when it does work it's pretty accurate as far as words.
B00CYQPM42,9,21,They are small and fit comfortable in your hands, easy set up, easy screens to screens, everything is at your finger tips.
B00CYQPM42,9,22,The reason I only gave it  4 stars is some of the features that come with it don't work as they should.
B00CYQPM42,9,23,Big plus is that I can view my school power points and pdf files !
B00CYQPM42,9,24,There's Candy Crush, which is important, of course :) I own an iPad, too; but it's too big and heavy for me to read and use for school work.
B00CYQPM42,10,0,love love love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,1,love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,2,I love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,3,love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,4,Love, love, love.
B00CYQPM42,10,5,Love Love Love.
B00CYQPM42,10,6,And the possibilities are endless!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!
B00CYQPM42,10,7,I love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,8,love, love, love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,9,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,10,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,10,11,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,12,love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,13,LOVE, LOVE!!!
B00CYQPM42,10,14,Great Tablet, Love It !
B00CYQPM42,10,15,i love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,16,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,17,I love it!
B00CYQPM42,10,18,Love it!!!
B00CYQPM42,10,19,Love this tablet!
B00CYQPM42,10,20,Love it, love it!!
B00CYQPM42,10,21,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,22,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,23,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,24,I Love it.
B00CYQPM42,11,0,Only thing that is really lacking is a USB port otherwise it is a great little product.
B00CYQPM42,11,1,Nice unit.
B00CYQPM42,11,2,It's got Miracast but unfortunately my tv doesn't support it so I can't make it mirror the screen on to the tv.
B00CYQPM42,11,3,Then they took away the HDMI port which I use often to play a movies on my TV.
B00CYQPM42,11,4,I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.
B00CYQPM42,11,5,Definitely buy a sturdy case for little ones.
B00CYQPM42,11,6,When I realized too late that it had no HDMI out, I bought a Tronsmart miracast device.
B00CYQPM42,11,7,With the wifi off…battery life is very good.
B00CYQPM42,11,8,My phone did and our laptop did but mind showed me a keyboard and asked for a pin????
B00CYQPM42,11,9,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,11,10,Great tablet, but again the 7" screen doesn't cut it.
B00CYQPM42,11,11,Was so impressed I bought another one for my son.Ted A
B00CYQPM42,11,12,Something to keep in mind if youre shopping around for a tablet.Also I guess the HD models could hook up to a TV with a HDMI cable.
B00CYQPM42,11,13,You can no longer use a HDMI device to stream to your TV.
B00CYQPM42,11,14,It's like a mini laptop to go!
B00CYQPM42,11,15,Movies look great, games look great, photos and games look great.
B00CYQPM42,11,16,Easy to use, lots of apps, light weight, and the screen is very clear.
B00CYQPM42,11,17,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,11,18,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,11,19,For an extra $150 and you get a much bigger screen.
B00CYQPM42,11,20,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,11,21,The display quality is truly awesome, the screen size is perfect for games and reading.
B00CYQPM42,11,22,And the possibilities are endless!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!
B00CYQPM42,11,23,The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3.
B00CYQPM42,11,24,Difficult to read on a sunny beach but great everywhere else.
B00CYQPM42,12,0,Just as good or even better than the Apple ipad.
B00CYQPM42,12,1,Better than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,12,2,Better than my ipad.
B00CYQPM42,12,3,Good tablet overall but the thing is the appstore its has about 10x less than the apple apps in the appstore
B00CYQPM42,12,4,I'm an avid Apple product user and not a fan of Android phone OS.
B00CYQPM42,12,5,They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.
B00CYQPM42,12,6,This tablet also doesn't have flash along with all modern Android and Apple products.
B00CYQPM42,12,7,It would not operate.
B00CYQPM42,12,8,Good Product, Missing Key Features.
B00CYQPM42,12,9,The only thing is that the HDX has a different look for the Android Operating System which is actually very nice.
B00CYQPM42,12,10,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,12,11,Excellent Device but very resiticted operationg system.
B00CYQPM42,12,12,Easy to navigate.love
B00CYQPM42,12,13,;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.
B00CYQPM42,12,14,While I love the kindle, I am used to Apple products.
B00CYQPM42,12,15,I will be going back to Apple when I need a new one.
B00CYQPM42,12,16,Im not really sure how amazon even makes money off these things when you compare it too comparable apple of android products.
B00CYQPM42,12,17,It's easy to use and offers many apps.
B00CYQPM42,12,18,Great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,12,19,Much better than an iPad.3)
B00CYQPM42,12,20,it..love it.
B00CYQPM42,12,21,love it.
B00CYQPM42,12,22,Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.
B00CYQPM42,12,23,But I LOVE THIS THING!
B00CYQPM42,12,24,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,13,0,Great product!
B00CYQPM42,13,1,I returned this product.
B00CYQPM42,13,2,Congratulations to Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,13,3,If I had known I wouldn't have purchased this product.
B00CYQPM42,13,4,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,13,5,Great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,6,Great customer service!!
B00CYQPM42,13,7,Thank you amazon....
B00CYQPM42,13,8,Keep up the great work Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,13,9,fast shipping.
B00CYQPM42,13,10,GREAT PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,13,11,I used this product for 20+ days or so and I'm getting one for Christmas.
B00CYQPM42,13,12,Plus great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,13,Keep up the good work Amazon!
B00CYQPM42,13,14,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,13,15,I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one.
B00CYQPM42,13,16,This product will replace iPads in no time.My Dad loves the MayDay.
B00CYQPM42,13,17,I'm pretty aggravated any time I have to deal with Amazon Customer Service.
B00CYQPM42,13,18,You now must purchase an additional product from amazon at a cost of around $100.
B00CYQPM42,13,19,I even called customer service and they said there's was a problem with it.
B00CYQPM42,13,20,Great!
B00CYQPM42,13,21,Thank you Amazon for making such a wonderful product and for having such wonderful customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,22,Thank you, Amazon!
B00CYQPM42,13,23,So I contacted Amazon customer service and let me just say they really are as amazing as everyone says!
B00CYQPM42,13,24,I think they are a great value and being backed by amazon means they will be supported for a long time.
B00CYQPM42,14,0,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,14,1,My next was an iPad 2 and then a Microsoft Surface Pro.
B00CYQPM42,14,2,Great tablet, but again the 7" screen doesn't cut it.
B00CYQPM42,14,3,For an extra $150 and you get a much bigger screen.
B00CYQPM42,14,4,Otherwise this product is great!
B00CYQPM42,14,5,There are a few financial apps that are not compatible with the tablet that are compatible with my other smart phones.
B00CYQPM42,14,6,I also own a Samsung Note 8, several iPads and have several other tablets as well.
B00CYQPM42,14,7,Cheaper than an ipad mini with a better screen, this device is a no brainer.
B00CYQPM42,14,8,I first mis-read this for using Microsoft office.
B00CYQPM42,14,9,First things first; the screen!
B00CYQPM42,14,10,Good Product!
B00CYQPM42,14,11,The hardware in this is powerful and easily high up comparative to other tablet-like device of this size.-
B00CYQPM42,14,12,Makes up for the great screen, great hardware, but these few details if fixed would definitely help capture the crown.
B00CYQPM42,14,13,This is a good product that was I expected to be because it has a better screen and more features than any other tablet.
B00CYQPM42,14,14,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,14,15,My first was a Samsung Galaxy 7.5.
B00CYQPM42,14,16,Great features but small screen - git the 8.9" instead... Short and sweet: I returned this for the 8.9" and am MUCH happier.
B00CYQPM42,14,17,I got this because my Android phone's screen was too small for reading and some gaming and note taking.
B00CYQPM42,14,18,Google you can't exactly use Microsoft office but does have word processing capabilities for all of us "on-the-go" and who can't afford the beautiful new window tablets.
B00CYQPM42,14,19,Lastly I bought this to use almost as a portable laptop because I read you can VIEW Microsoft office documents.
B00CYQPM42,14,20,Love it!
B00CYQPM42,14,21,This device is the best digital do hicky I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,14,22,It does everything my laptop does, only smaller..Which is exactly what I wanted!
B00CYQPM42,14,23,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,14,24,this 57 year old is not pc smart.
B00CYQPM42,15,0,It is just a slight blue haze at the borders--when displaying white--of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,1,The only other problem I have noticed is with the screen resolution.
B00CYQPM42,15,2,Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.
B00CYQPM42,15,3,Not sure if you can change the screen rotation.
B00CYQPM42,15,4,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,15,5,As for the rest, the screen is very sharp, and colors are great.
B00CYQPM42,15,6,The reflections are the worst when the screen is mainly black, which happens often because the main screen of the tablet is black.
B00CYQPM42,15,7,I have noticed my screen flickers when I am using an app that has color (basically everything except reading).
B00CYQPM42,15,8,screen is sharp.
B00CYQPM42,15,9,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,15,10,So I turned it back down to a brightness of about 75% which is bright enough without being too bright.The only problem I have with the screen is that it is very reflective, easily the most reflective tablet I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,15,11,I can't believe that it is so light!!!!!!
B00CYQPM42,15,12,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,15,13,The color screen is crisp and, as a color screen, is more suitable for technical volumes than the B&W; Kindles.
B00CYQPM42,15,14,I did use the May day button to remove a popup screen I kept getting.
B00CYQPM42,15,15,As soon as you go to the next screen, there are no more ads.
B00CYQPM42,15,16,I did not noticed until I started reading about it.
B00CYQPM42,15,17,I don't think its so horrible that you won't be able to read on the white screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,18,The interface is polished, the screen is bright and sharp.
B00CYQPM42,15,19,The is some glare in bright light but that is the trade-off for color.The included apps are good enough.
B00CYQPM42,15,20,The screen is very clear and the options for use are almost endless.
B00CYQPM42,15,21,I can read in the dark with out a flash light.
B00CYQPM42,15,22,I do not like the blue lighting around the edges, it something resets and even with a black background (to avoid the blue lighting) it has a light flicker.
B00CYQPM42,15,23,The fact that you can't change the background of the screens home to anything you want.
B00CYQPM42,15,24,The difference was so small that it didn't really matter to me.The Kindle HDX screen (1920 x 1200) has a higher resolution than the Kindle HD screen (1280 x 800).
B00CYQPM42,16,0,To few apps.
B00CYQPM42,16,1,Does not do Google plus and most apps...
B00CYQPM42,16,2,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,16,3,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,16,4,All it needs is a suitable app store.
B00CYQPM42,16,5,App store is awful!!!!!!!!!!
B00CYQPM42,16,6,Amazon you need to fix your App store
B00CYQPM42,16,7,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,16,8,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,16,9,Why is there no app for an update for Flash Player?
B00CYQPM42,16,10,No podcast player app.
B00CYQPM42,16,11,With an Android device, you can access the Amazon Android store, but with a Kindle Fire, you cannot access the Google Play store.
B00CYQPM42,16,12,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,16,13,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,16,14,No YouTube app.
B00CYQPM42,16,15,There are more apps being added constantly and so far I've found everything I've needed in the app store.
B00CYQPM42,16,16,By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.
B00CYQPM42,16,17,I can't download any videos as I get an error that it is already downloaded to another one of my devices!!
B00CYQPM42,16,18,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,16,19,I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.
B00CYQPM42,16,20,Runs on a android system but does not allow google play.
B00CYQPM42,16,21,The child or toddler apps I did download would freeze, not only the app but also the tablet!
B00CYQPM42,16,22,If Amazon would just switch to Google Play for the app store, then there is nothing that would stop them from ruling the world!
B00CYQPM42,16,23,I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet.
B00CYQPM42,16,24,I was disappointed to find that the system on my kindle fire, will not do google plus store or other android apps!
B00CYQPM42,17,0,I wish I never bought it!
B00CYQPM42,17,1,I FOUND THAT THE PRICE WAS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,17,2,Much better than an Apple I-Pad!
B00CYQPM42,17,3,This is the most expensive waste of money!
B00CYQPM42,17,4,I am really disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,5,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,6,This was a Christmas gift for our son.
B00CYQPM42,17,7,Christmas Gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,8,I bought two of these for Christmas, one for me one and one as a gift, at $179.
B00CYQPM42,17,9,It was a Christmas present.
B00CYQPM42,17,10,I guess I'm going to pay $200 more for and Ipad which I didn't want to do in the first place.
B00CYQPM42,17,11,Disappointing after owning an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,12,The same thing happened when I bought the Kindle Paperwhite a  year ago.
B00CYQPM42,17,13,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,14,I know that you get what you pay for, so I guess I should have gotten an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,15,Overal disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,16,This device is so bad that amazon should be paying the customers to use this piece of junk!I am still having so many problems with my kindle.
B00CYQPM42,17,17,This is my first time with a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,17,18,Disappointing.
B00CYQPM42,17,19,I bought this, as a gift for my 72 year old mother.
B00CYQPM42,17,20,I am just very disappointed in it for what I paid for.
B00CYQPM42,17,21,The iPad is great!
B00CYQPM42,17,22,The way the Kindle Fire is now, I would not recommend a purchase.
B00CYQPM42,17,23,The year before we had given a Kindle to our grandson (his 14 yr son) and the four of our children had gotten together and given me a Kindle for Christmas.
B00CYQPM42,17,24,wait before you buy.
B00CYQPM42,18,0,The battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,18,1,Battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,18,2,Cannot turn it off.
B00CYQPM42,18,3,The first one after less than a week woudn't charge.. Sent it back and they sent us a new one.
B00CYQPM42,18,4,Low battery life.
B00CYQPM42,18,5,I have to hold the power button down for 15 seconds or more for it to shut off.
B00CYQPM42,18,6,One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,7,Battery life is great so far.-
B00CYQPM42,18,8,Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours.
B00CYQPM42,18,9,The kindle came to me holding a charge so I could instantaneously turn it on and play with it.
B00CYQPM42,18,10,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,18,11,I have this unit for several weeks now and since then I have experienced a couple of slow down response and three "blue screens" although the unit is 40%, 80 % and 55 % charged, the first time it came back after 4 hours, the second and third time after several minutes.
B00CYQPM42,18,12,Every time I turn the tablet on I get  advertising.
B00CYQPM42,18,13,I use it every day.
B00CYQPM42,18,14,Battery - I get a couple days of heavy usage (8 hours) out of it.
B00CYQPM42,18,15,I did use the May day button to remove a popup screen I kept getting.
B00CYQPM42,18,16,My only complaint is that it takes a very long time to recharge the battery so you don't want to forget to plug it in overnight.
B00CYQPM42,18,17,Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%.
B00CYQPM42,18,18,(Yes, there are ways to extend battery life, such as turning off wifi when not using it.
B00CYQPM42,18,19,I bought this for my 7 year old and it worked fine at first but now it keeps freezing up and we can't turn it off or anything it just freezes on whatever she was doing playing the music on and on can't even power it down until the battery dies wouldn't recommend this product.
B00CYQPM42,18,20,If the cord is propped up I can leave it plugged in all night and it won't charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,21,It took a minute but I caught on to it.
B00CYQPM42,18,22,This is the second one that the freezing happens so I'm not sure if it's something mechanical or what the reason is for it freezing.
B00CYQPM42,18,23,Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.
B00CYQPM42,18,24,Then I recharged it, and again tested that same 2.5 hour previously downloaded movie -- with wifi turned off, "airplane mode" turned on, and brightness set at about 70%, the battery drained from fully charged to 65%.
B00CYQPM42,19,0,In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough.
B00CYQPM42,19,1,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,19,2,I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones.
B00CYQPM42,19,3,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,19,4,The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.
B00CYQPM42,19,5,found the speakers to have decent sound.
B00CYQPM42,19,6,If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side.
B00CYQPM42,19,7,Sound, power, silly-pretty display, feel...and did I mention power???
B00CYQPM42,19,8,The power button and volume control have been moved.
B00CYQPM42,19,9,With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste.
B00CYQPM42,19,10,Love the easier-to-locate design of the on/off button and external volume control button too.
B00CYQPM42,19,11,IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side.
B00CYQPM42,19,12,I wish the on/off button was located on the top or side in stead  of the bottom.
B00CYQPM42,19,13,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,19,14,It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers.
B00CYQPM42,19,15,With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD
B00CYQPM42,19,16,Ever heard of quality control?
B00CYQPM42,19,17,Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me.
B00CYQPM42,19,18,Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side.
B00CYQPM42,19,19,Users can get confused with volume buttons on the other side.
B00CYQPM42,19,20,Even with my Kindle, the top pantel where the speakers are started to peel off a bit (amazon used glue to assemble the speaker grille top panel).
B00CYQPM42,19,21,I bought this for my father who has low vision.
B00CYQPM42,19,22,If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder.
B00CYQPM42,19,23,Hit the On/Off button accidentally for even a tenth of a second and it turns off.The volume button is also on the back, on the right side.
B00CYQPM42,19,24,That gives this device a much better surround sound then previous generation's.Build (8/10):This HDX is more "angular" than last year's device.
B00CYQPM42,20,0,that isn't really a camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,1,It also doesn't have a rear facing camera, it only has a front facing one, like for apps such as Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,2,The HDX has a front facing camera, but lacks a rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,3,The poor quality front facing only camera on it.
B00CYQPM42,20,4,The 7” version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.
B00CYQPM42,20,5,#1 the camera on this model is only front facing but it seems that on all of the other HDX models that are larger they have a front AND rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,6,Also the camera is the worst part, the camera is only on the front of the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,7,The rear facing camera would make my 32BG purchase choice more useful.
B00CYQPM42,20,8,You need a camera for Skype or other video app.-
B00CYQPM42,20,9,If you take the time to put a camera, why not make give it a front and rear with more megapixels to really compete with other tablets?
B00CYQPM42,20,10,The only pictures you can take of are yourself because if you turn it around you can't see what you are taking a picture of.
B00CYQPM42,20,11,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,12,she does however have a problem with the camera part, apparently you can only take pictures that are facing the front of the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,13,don't need a picture of my ugly mug looking at my kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,14,I perhaps would have liked the buy the double camera better but I didn't realize the camera only shoots forward at yourself rather than a normal pic (unless I'm missing something).
B00CYQPM42,20,15,It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,16,Very good better than what a t I expected.The only thing is the camera it only have front and not back.But I guess that's why it have the kindle hdx8.9 cause that have both.
B00CYQPM42,20,17,Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it.
B00CYQPM42,20,18,I would give this a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the problems I have had with getting Skype to work.
B00CYQPM42,20,19,I also thought he camera would be usy to use.
B00CYQPM42,20,20,Like last year's model, there is no rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,21,I can now take pics and store/edit/save them - I didn't realize how much of a difference that makes to me (even if I can only take the pics from the front of the Kindle with this model).
B00CYQPM42,20,22,Not what I expected, camera is not adjustable and you have to play with it.
B00CYQPM42,20,23,I ONLY WISH THE CAMERA WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
B00CYQPM42,20,24,aren't you suppose to be able to take pictures of OTHER people?
B00CYQPM42,21,0,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,21,1,Compared to a nexus 7 which is the same price, the HDX seems to have a slower processor.
B00CYQPM42,21,2,It is so FAST…compared to my android ASUS transformer tablet.
B00CYQPM42,21,3,Having a lot of issues with this!!!
B00CYQPM42,21,4,This is a good product that was I expected to be because it has a better screen and more features than any other tablet.
B00CYQPM42,21,5,I've got better things to do with my time that hack a product right out of the box.
B00CYQPM42,21,6,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,21,7,Otherwise it's a great little machine!
B00CYQPM42,21,8,All in all it's okay, but I feel I could have done better with my 200 bucks by getting a nexus 7.
B00CYQPM42,21,9,I bought it as a upgrade from a 2012 Google Nexus 7.
B00CYQPM42,21,10,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,21,11,Everything I expected and more.
B00CYQPM42,21,12,Great Device, Better than expected.
B00CYQPM42,21,13,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,21,14,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,21,15,It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.
B00CYQPM42,21,16,All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3" x 5.0" x 0.35" and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9" x 4.5" x 0.34" and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87" x 5.3" x 0.29" and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here.
B00CYQPM42,21,17,The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade.
B00CYQPM42,21,18,The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi.
B00CYQPM42,21,19,I hope some software upgrade or battery pack can make this the ultimate road warrior!****************************Dec 23th 2013 - 2 months  update *********************************So I have been using between this HDX 7" and the 8.9" HDX.
B00CYQPM42,21,20,There is supposed to be a fix being worked on here in the near future and released for wide distribution.
B00CYQPM42,21,21,A great tablet at a great price.
B00CYQPM42,21,22,Great tablet at a great price...
B00CYQPM42,21,23,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,21,24,Update on Dec 23 2013 - Please scroll to the very end of this review for 2 month use update.
B00CYQPM42,22,0,I also like that there is a "on device" and "cloud" app storage so I can move apps to the Cloud when I don't want them for a time.
B00CYQPM42,22,1,It is REALLY hard to quit apps.
B00CYQPM42,22,2,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,3,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,22,4,For one, getting music to it (except music purchased through Amazon) is a pain, requiring a file transfer app to copy from my iTunes library.
B00CYQPM42,22,5,32GB will provide you more memory space for pics, hd movies, etc. Apps eat up a lot of memory quickly.I recommend that Amazon provide the approx number of movies etc can be stored on each kindle model with its specs.
B00CYQPM42,22,6,But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing.
B00CYQPM42,22,7,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,22,8,If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.
B00CYQPM42,22,9,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,22,10,Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage.
B00CYQPM42,22,11,Movies, books, audio, and apps all run in superior order, with the only down side, is memory expandability (an extra slot for loading more solid state memory as a card).
B00CYQPM42,22,12,Still having a few problems finding things on this one, after I got used to the last model.
B00CYQPM42,22,13,The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!
B00CYQPM42,22,14,But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased.
B00CYQPM42,22,15,The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB.
B00CYQPM42,22,16,Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge.
B00CYQPM42,22,17,64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB.
B00CYQPM42,22,18,It's ways to buy apps.
B00CYQPM42,22,19,My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats.
B00CYQPM42,22,20,It has plenrty of memory to keep everything you've ever opened up and running, but dang what A pain to quit.
B00CYQPM42,22,21,It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2.
B00CYQPM42,22,22,I highly recommend purchasing 32 GB .
B00CYQPM42,22,23,I was disappointed to find that the system on my kindle fire, will not do google plus store or other android apps!
B00CYQPM42,22,24,Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app.
B00CYQPM42,23,0,WIFI Connectivity.
B00CYQPM42,23,1,Won't Connect to my Wireless Router.
B00CYQPM42,23,2,wi-fi drops constantly.
B00CYQPM42,23,3,My other devices have never had an issue.
B00CYQPM42,23,4,The wi-fi connection drops constantly for no apparent reason.
B00CYQPM42,23,5,It is hard and slow to connect to WiFI unlike my other Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,6,Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems.
B00CYQPM42,23,7,Next time i will take the ipad.
B00CYQPM42,23,8,Thus, I ran into the very same connectivity issues that I had with my old Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,9,i got this particular model so i could have internet/ wifi anywhere.
B00CYQPM42,23,10,I found it very easy to connect to the Wi-Fi in each hotel we stayed at.
B00CYQPM42,23,11,It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day.
B00CYQPM42,23,12,Today, I was at Starbucks, where I tried connecting to the internet through their free WIFI service, but failed to connect.
B00CYQPM42,23,13,it constantly loses my wi-fi singnal (at least 2-3 times per day).
B00CYQPM42,23,14,Whenever I would connect to Wifi the Kindle would shut down and reboot.
B00CYQPM42,23,15,I have a slow internet connection, and only one option for a service provider.
B00CYQPM42,23,16,If the connection issues were resolved, I would give this 5 stars.
B00CYQPM42,23,17,Some days it works fine but once it starts acting up, it will continuously drop connection every 2 - 10 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,23,18,At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem.
B00CYQPM42,23,19,I spend a lot of time in places where I cannot get phone or wifi signals.
B00CYQPM42,23,20,(You must have an active internet connection to do this.)
B00CYQPM42,23,21,Crashed constantly.
B00CYQPM42,23,22,I continuously have problems with my Kindle not hooking up to my wireless, which in turn makes it a pretty useless device.
B00CYQPM42,23,23,The only time I noticed the difference was browsing the internet.
B00CYQPM42,23,24,For this reason, I made the decision not to order the 4G internet (Verizon) with it and ordered solely the WIFI connection for it.
B00CYQPM42,24,0,Like HDX very much and wish a touch cover like keyboard case to make it more productive.
B00CYQPM42,24,1,For example, something like Surface touch cover.
B00CYQPM42,24,2,Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,24,3,I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times.
B00CYQPM42,24,4,Now I just have to find a pretty case for it!!
B00CYQPM42,24,5,There are 4 obvious shadows at the bottom of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,6,The new screen is sweet too.
B00CYQPM42,24,7,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,24,8,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,9,I wish Amazon could come out some keyboard case for HDX.
B00CYQPM42,24,10,My only complaint about this product is that it's way too sensitive to touch.
B00CYQPM42,24,11,This one just irked me one too many times with the return-replace-defective cycle.
B00CYQPM42,24,12,Now that I can actually use the screen I can see that the device isn't worth it.
B00CYQPM42,24,13,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,24,14,So, I sent it back and got a replacement from Amazon.And then that replacement's display started flickering randomly.
B00CYQPM42,24,15,Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app.
B00CYQPM42,24,16,whilst in the states as I spend a lot of time there.
B00CYQPM42,24,17,Which they sent quickly....and that one had more screen issues.I don't know if I just had bad luck, but that's the point when I gave up.
B00CYQPM42,24,18,The only thing I don't like is the keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,24,19,I did use the May day button to remove a popup screen I kept getting.
B00CYQPM42,24,20,The opening screen has ads, which I discovered I can pay to remove.
B00CYQPM42,24,21,But I cannot help feeling that the HDX should never have been subjected to that type of interference.So on that basis I have only given it three stars.
B00CYQPM42,24,22,Unbeknowing to me at the time the cover had the ability to shut down the HDX when either folded back or closed.
B00CYQPM42,24,23,The screen is very clear and the options for use are almost endless.
B00CYQPM42,24,24,I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).
B00CYQPM42,25,0,So it would have been obvious to just get the iPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,1,Much better than an Apple I-Pad!
B00CYQPM42,25,2,Next time I'm buying an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,3,It is REALLY hard to quit apps.
B00CYQPM42,25,4,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,25,5,This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.
B00CYQPM42,25,6,I got this because my Android phone's screen was too small for reading and some gaming and note taking.
B00CYQPM42,25,7,I have used, recently, a Nexus 7 (2013) and an iPad Air.
B00CYQPM42,25,8,I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.
B00CYQPM42,25,9,Disappointing after owning an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,10,If you are not, then buy it anyway as you will save at least $100 over the nearest priced iPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,11,My first was a Samsung Galaxy 7.5.
B00CYQPM42,25,12,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,25,13,Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them.
B00CYQPM42,25,14,This thing is great!
B00CYQPM42,25,15,I will immediately get rid of the device when I am back in the states and buy an IPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,16,If that's important to you, consider the iPad Mini.
B00CYQPM42,25,17,It is kind of counter intuitive if one is familiar with iPads and Galaxy devices to buy apps.
B00CYQPM42,25,18,Although it's old tech now, one thing I love about Samsung products is they LAST.
B00CYQPM42,25,19,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,25,20,Just as good or even better than the Apple ipad.
B00CYQPM42,25,21,It is so FAST…compared to my android ASUS transformer tablet.
B00CYQPM42,25,22,Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app.
B00CYQPM42,25,23,I haven't gotten to use a 3G feature yet, but this tablet finds a WiFi connection where my Surface Pro, other tablets and even my powerful laptops can't get it.It's got great apps, the screen is stunning (looks better than the last iPad Air or Surface Pro 2), and its drop test rating is one of the better ones.
B00CYQPM42,25,24,Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.
B00CYQPM42,26,0,The Lack of even a mini USB port.
B00CYQPM42,26,1,Micro USB Connector - Bite it Apple!
B00CYQPM42,26,2,For the first time ever - a plug adapter is included!
B00CYQPM42,26,3,The USB port sticks out at an odd angle, making it difficult to plug in.
B00CYQPM42,26,4,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,26,5,Amazon is including a plug adapter so you can actually charge the device through a regular electrical outlet.
B00CYQPM42,26,6,The placement of the USB port for charger is a great improvement.
B00CYQPM42,26,7,It's just very odd and makes charging annoying.2)
B00CYQPM42,26,8,Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away.
B00CYQPM42,26,9,The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3.
B00CYQPM42,26,10,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,26,11,Only thing that is really lacking is a USB port otherwise it is a great little product.
B00CYQPM42,26,12,One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge.
B00CYQPM42,26,13,The bottom line is that this is not a repairable device.
B00CYQPM42,26,14,Instead of placing the USB port on the bottom of the HDX (like it is on the HD) it is placed at the top left side which helps when using the carrying case.
B00CYQPM42,26,15,You have to connect it at an angle on the device (around 30 degrees).
B00CYQPM42,26,16,6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit.
B00CYQPM42,26,17,have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle.
B00CYQPM42,26,18,If you have a cord sitting around, it most likely works for charging or connecting the Kindle Fire HDX.
B00CYQPM42,26,19,I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.
B00CYQPM42,26,20,You will not regret it since this device is designed to be taken everywhere.
B00CYQPM42,26,21,The Kindle recently died, the battery cannot be charged, even when using a different charger.
B00CYQPM42,26,22,It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device.
B00CYQPM42,26,23,I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.
B00CYQPM42,26,24,Much better than an iPad.3)
B00CYQPM42,27,0,Thus, it is most difficult to learn how to use the device when I have to switch back and forth from directions to the actual Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,27,1,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,27,2,I wish you had included a brief pamphlet of instructions.
B00CYQPM42,27,3,I am especially disappointed that my problems have now been written off.
B00CYQPM42,27,4,This is my first time with a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,27,5,It will help take the guess work for the user.
B00CYQPM42,27,6,useless outside of the united states.
B00CYQPM42,27,7,Have a lot to learn but I'm getting the hang of it.
B00CYQPM42,27,8,The user directions which I also bought were available only as a kindle book.
B00CYQPM42,27,9,It really would have been very considerate of you to have included some simple written directions on how to get started and learn the basic functions.
B00CYQPM42,27,10,It's hard for me to get the hang of some of the basic functions.
B00CYQPM42,27,11,Fourth, it's not easy to switch between apps.
B00CYQPM42,27,12,The lag could be a result of several things, including the hardware or system resources provided on this device.
B00CYQPM42,27,13,No instruction manual, none needed really.
B00CYQPM42,27,14,I have seen Prime lock up and lag on all the devices I own, but none of the others have the severity or frequency of problems the Kindle has.
B00CYQPM42,27,15,You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on.
B00CYQPM42,27,16,I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently.
B00CYQPM42,27,17,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,27,18,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,27,19,She couldn't comprehend that I could not complete her troubleshooting checklist because the device was not working!
B00CYQPM42,27,20,Again I would guess it's a lack system resources or possibly a hardware issue.The Flexibility of the Kindle:In terms of flexibility I guess this could be seen as subjective.
B00CYQPM42,27,21,I was disappointed to find that the system on my kindle fire, will not do google plus store or other android apps!
B00CYQPM42,27,22,The other issue I am having is random shutdowns of my kindle for no reason.
B00CYQPM42,27,23,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,27,24,Here's what I've found to be the problem with the Kindles Flexibility and one of the outstanding issues I've found with it.Amazon had set up packet blocking and redirect on their devices.
B00CYQPM42,28,0,I have contacted support about these problems.
B00CYQPM42,28,1,I am going to contact support again to see if they can help.
B00CYQPM42,28,2,I called customer service AGAIN and asked if I was eligible for a refund and they told me that because this was a replacement device I could not have a refund.
B00CYQPM42,28,3,Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept.
B00CYQPM42,28,4,It took a few days for a very supportive customer service chap from Ireland to sort out the problem.
B00CYQPM42,28,5,The device is 5 months old...After contacting Amazon Kindle support a fourth time, someone finally helped me.
B00CYQPM42,28,6,Its a poorly developed product with poor customer service.
B00CYQPM42,28,7,When I called customer service they were great (the reason that this go any stars) I received a replacement and I am having the same issues.
B00CYQPM42,28,8,Therefore, I am no longer receiving any more emails about this issue which means the problems are not fixed and now I don't know what to do about it.
B00CYQPM42,28,9,poor support.
B00CYQPM42,28,10,Next time i will take the ipad.
B00CYQPM42,28,11,I want to return it.
B00CYQPM42,28,12,If I had to do it again, I would not buy it and I want to send it back
B00CYQPM42,28,13,i contacted customer service and it took them a week to send a canned email with instructions on how to load an email.
B00CYQPM42,28,14,I called customer care, they helped me quickly reset the device to factory settings and it seemed to have fixed it.
B00CYQPM42,28,15,Sorry, Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,28,16,I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support.
B00CYQPM42,28,17,I explained this to the tech advisors and they told me to send it back.
B00CYQPM42,28,18,I will be sending it back for a refund.
B00CYQPM42,28,19,He sent a few emails telling me he was working on the problem and the last email I received stated his superiors said I should update my kindle with the new update because it would fix my problems..
B00CYQPM42,28,20,Do not purchase as a gift or you will have a hard time getting warranty replacement.
B00CYQPM42,28,21,This one just irked me one too many times with the return-replace-defective cycle.
B00CYQPM42,28,22,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,28,23,I understood every word that they said (it wasn't outsourced) and it was by far the best tech-issue customer service contact I've ever had.
B00CYQPM42,28,24,I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call.
B00CYQPM42,29,0,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,29,1,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,29,2,The only thing I don't like is the keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,29,3,I miss being able to click on the top of the screen to get to settings.
B00CYQPM42,29,4,It's hard to scroll through screens without opening something about which you have no interest.
B00CYQPM42,29,5,I would have given it 5 stars but some of the apps will flip upside down when I have the screen locked in one place.
B00CYQPM42,29,6,Just hanged up with the CS and they assure that is a software feature, and that can be fixed with a software update.
B00CYQPM42,29,7,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,29,8,But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,29,9,If the app doesn't allow you to exit that way, then the developers never developed an exit button for their app.
B00CYQPM42,29,10,It’s a circle of icons in which the last thing you opened goes up there.
B00CYQPM42,29,11,My only complaint about this product is that it's way too sensitive to touch.
B00CYQPM42,29,12,When using it, the screen will all of a sudden disappear.
B00CYQPM42,29,13,Next time I'm buying an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,29,14,I have to hold the power button down for 15 seconds or more for it to shut off.
B00CYQPM42,29,15,I could move the little window wherever I wanted.
B00CYQPM42,29,16,This is the second one that the freezing happens so I'm not sure if it's something mechanical or what the reason is for it freezing.
B00CYQPM42,29,17,It is okay, not as good as hyped.Pros:ResponsiveGreat pictureCons:FreezesCan't completely close applicationsSpeakers point backwards which is annoying since they are great, but you can't hear them and watch something at the same time.Overall:I am sending it back and getting a Windows Surface since there is more you can do with it.
B00CYQPM42,29,18,Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime.
B00CYQPM42,29,19,The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!
B00CYQPM42,29,20,Smooth operation of software and other functions.
B00CYQPM42,29,21,I did not noticed until I started reading about it.
B00CYQPM42,29,22,It works extremely well but it does not have a "select all" option when you need to move or delete e-mail, you have to select each one individually.
B00CYQPM42,29,23,Will need to find a way to change the keyboard layout.
B00CYQPM42,29,24,It's not a big deal, just annoying.
B007P4YAPK,0,0,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,0,1,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,0,2,Back when I had the Kindle Fire, I'd have the brightness all the way down and it would STILL be too bright.-
B007P4YAPK,0,3,Love the crisp display and the vibrant colors.
B007P4YAPK,0,4,AND the screen is slightly larger than on an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,0,5,What a pity, this could have been a great tablet
B007P4YAPK,0,6,I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire.
B007P4YAPK,0,7,Once again... yes the screen on this tablet is great, but yes there is a VISIBLE improvement on the New iPad.
B007P4YAPK,0,8,I purchased the Asus tablet as a reasonable-priced iPad.
B007P4YAPK,0,9,My sister has the New iPad and yes I can tell the difference in the screen.
B007P4YAPK,0,10,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,0,11,At first I was thinking I wouldn't be able to tell the difference... but I was wrong.This does not make me want to get the New iPad however, because I don't like the "Apple" way of doing things.
B007P4YAPK,0,12,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,0,13,But comparing this to the iPad 2, why should I put up with this behavior?
B007P4YAPK,0,14,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,0,15,i also love that i can alter the size of the font and the color background of my pages.
B007P4YAPK,0,16,TF-300 Display Downgrade.
B007P4YAPK,0,17,I've watched movies while traveling on both this tablet and the iPad and notice very little difference.
B007P4YAPK,0,18,i had balked at getting a tablet for a very long time as i love the feeling of having a real book, so the size matters to me.
B007P4YAPK,0,19,My friend has a first generation I-Pad and even that screen is noticeably brighter than the ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,0,20,The screen resolution isn't as good, but unless you're super picky there's not enough difference for it to matter.
B007P4YAPK,0,21,The iPad is a superior device in every single way, from the screen, to performance to apps to battery life.Here's my review.I had the retina iPad for a while before I picked up this tablet, I knew it wasn't a high resolution screen going in so it wasn't a shock but I was still surprised at how quickly I got use to the iPad screen, the Transformer screen doesn't compare at all.
B007P4YAPK,0,22,Needless to say the GPS was better as well.You can definitely notice a difference in the screen resolution, the TF300 is not as sharp on the colors.
B007P4YAPK,0,23,The Amazon ads for the white one also show black.
B007P4YAPK,0,24,It was not a significant difference, but it is becoming hard to read under the sun vs. tf201 is nice and clear.
B007P4YAPK,1,0,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,1,1,Cannot play Netflix movies on the tablet even though before I bought it I made sure everything said we could.2)
B007P4YAPK,1,2,So far mostly he has just used free games.
B007P4YAPK,1,3,For streaming videos from Youtube or Netflix it's not so good.
B007P4YAPK,1,4,My son likes to play games, that is his main use of the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,5,The apps loads fast.
B007P4YAPK,1,6,It happened when the wife or kids were playing Mahjong, Smarf or fish tank games.
B007P4YAPK,1,7,Another problem is app to app integration.
B007P4YAPK,1,8,I use it to read books, watch movies, listen to music, catch up on the news, play educational games, etc....
B007P4YAPK,1,9,Apparently, you need to have an 'app' in order to do most everything, and apparently they think everyone uses google mail and has a google acccount.
B007P4YAPK,1,10,I was used to my husband's iPad but once I set up my home screen and downloaded some apps, I was good to go.
B007P4YAPK,1,11,Adobe flash player and shockwave not available so some movies, etc don't play.
B007P4YAPK,1,12,it won`t download Adobe media player and some things need that to play on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,13,But it works great with netflix, crunchyroll, xfinity, brighthousetv etc. so its nice for watching stuff while working out.
B007P4YAPK,1,14,Netflix plays beautifully.
B007P4YAPK,1,15,But if one is not in to gaming or if games you play does not require too much.
B007P4YAPK,1,16,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,1,17,Good .
B007P4YAPK,1,18,The only thing that I was disappointed about was the inability to stream videos except youtube.
B007P4YAPK,1,19,But as it is, I still have the opportunity to create a new gmail account to use exclusively with google play.
B007P4YAPK,1,20,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,21,I purchased it brandnew since the product first available on Amazone 8 months ago, it looks good ( not as good as Ipad) the touch screen sensitive is good and smooth , the quality so far so good... my kids use it to play games and watch youtube videos alot .
B007P4YAPK,1,22,And I've had no problem finding apps on Google Play to fill all of my needs.
B007P4YAPK,1,23,Great tablet  - but has problems.
B007P4YAPK,1,24,Netflix and the music players work well, but what I really use it is for the following:1.
B007P4YAPK,2,0,Great tablet for the price.
B007P4YAPK,2,1,Great! Great product.
B007P4YAPK,2,2,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,2,3,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,2,4,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,2,5,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,2,6,Good Product.
B007P4YAPK,2,7,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,8,If you're looking for something comprehensive like the iPad I would recommend this.
B007P4YAPK,2,9,Worth buying.
B007P4YAPK,2,10,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,2,11,This is a good tablet for the price I paid for it.
B007P4YAPK,2,12,Overall, I love this product.
B007P4YAPK,2,13,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,14,Good price.
B007P4YAPK,2,15,Bought this for the wife and she really likes it.
B007P4YAPK,2,16,Very good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,17,My friend recommended it and I went along with the recommendation.
B007P4YAPK,2,18,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,19,I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B007P4YAPK,2,20,Overall, for the price of this tablet, I don't think you can get any better!
B007P4YAPK,2,21,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,2,22,The price was good at the time but now it is even better of course.
B007P4YAPK,2,23,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,2,24,I would recommend this to anyone who wants a pretty high spec tablet but without the high end price.
B007P4YAPK,3,0,The battery lasts about 7 hours.
B007P4YAPK,3,1,Great battery life too.
B007P4YAPK,3,2,Great battery life also
B007P4YAPK,3,3,Very good battery life; especially using the dock.5.
B007P4YAPK,3,4,Battery life is around 7 hours for almost constant use.
B007P4YAPK,3,5,Had it for 3 days and could not charge it.
B007P4YAPK,3,6,See how long the battery lasts.
B007P4YAPK,3,7,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B007P4YAPK,3,8,nice for it's time.
B007P4YAPK,3,9,Good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,3,10,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,3,11,It does seem to charge fast though and hold a charge very well while the display is off.
B007P4YAPK,3,12,Powerful and has a good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,3,13,Color reproduction is excellent though.Battery life has generally been very good for me though it will not hold up great under gaming.
B007P4YAPK,3,14,It is a good qualify tablet.
B007P4YAPK,3,15,Good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,3,16,But like I said before, that is not needed because the battery is amply sufficient.
B007P4YAPK,3,17,The unit seemed very nice with a lot of good features until 3 days went by and it would not take a charge.
B007P4YAPK,3,18,Battery lasts a pretty long time, especially when fitted with keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,3,19,The battery life is very impressive also.My only gripe with this is the screen.
B007P4YAPK,3,20,Battery life is above average, usually lasting a day and a half with moderate use.
B007P4YAPK,3,21,They are a photo junkie and just cannot get enough battery life.2.
B007P4YAPK,3,22,On the down side the battery life isn't as good as the iPad's and requires more frequent charging.
B007P4YAPK,3,23,Being able to use the keyboard was great, and the amount of extended battery life you get from it was amazing.
B007P4YAPK,3,24,The SL101 screen has a more heavy-duty feel, but doesn't have a second battery.
B007P4YAPK,4,0,Very Poor Screen Quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,1,The build quality was much better, everything aligned and in place.
B007P4YAPK,4,2,Good tablet with sound issue.
B007P4YAPK,4,3,Good enough but could be better!
B007P4YAPK,4,4,The design is good and simplistic.
B007P4YAPK,4,5,Good but...
B007P4YAPK,4,6,The design and build are both very good.
B007P4YAPK,4,7,Bad video recording sound.
B007P4YAPK,4,8,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,4,9,Apart from needing more sound from the speakers, its a very good product.
B007P4YAPK,4,10,The product build quality is not good as well.
B007P4YAPK,4,11,Decent product performance, shoddy build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,12,Good Product.
B007P4YAPK,4,13,I like the build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,14,It feels good, is easy to hold, and the screen is very nice, if not as bright as the Prime.
B007P4YAPK,4,15,The display was crisp and the sound was surprisingly loud with only 1 speaker.
B007P4YAPK,4,16,All in all, I THOUGHT this was going to be a solid product but in the end, the price of the tablet ended up being too good to be true because of the build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,17,I am impressed with the look, feel and 'heft' of the tablet - good quality of fit and finish.
B007P4YAPK,4,18,A surprisingly good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,4,19,Sound isn't the best (only one speaker), but it does get surprisingly loud for a little thing.Overall, so far I like the TF300 a LOT.
B007P4YAPK,4,20,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,4,21,So far, so good.
B007P4YAPK,4,22,Best Android tablet, but quality issues.
B007P4YAPK,4,23,But on the other hand, it feels cheap.
B007P4YAPK,4,24,The design is nice and it feels pretty sturdy.
B007P4YAPK,5,0,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,1,I usually have the screen at 80-100%- I really like that the screen can actually get pretty dark.
B007P4YAPK,5,2,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,5,3,camera is really sluggish but the quality is good in good light.
B007P4YAPK,5,4,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,5,5,The screen sensitivity is very good though.
B007P4YAPK,5,6,Very Poor Screen Quality.
B007P4YAPK,5,7,The screen is not as bright or brilliant as the TF700 or the iPad3, but to my 74 y/o eyes it looks pretty good until I go outside.
B007P4YAPK,5,8,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,5,9,I prefer warmer colors, but honestly, I can't really tell unless I had something to compare it to.CAMERA: 3.5/5- I haven't put the front-facing camera through its paces- The rear-facing camera is good for a tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,10,The screen resolution is very crisp indoors.
B007P4YAPK,5,11,The screen resolution isn't as good, but unless you're super picky there's not enough difference for it to matter.
B007P4YAPK,5,12,Best tablet with one exception - SKYPE.
B007P4YAPK,5,13,There is something about the camera in the TF201 with indoor light.
B007P4YAPK,5,14,I can't say how much I love this tablet it's fast quality device with one exception in that Skype video is the very bad!This is a software problem and so I am hopefull that it will be fixed.
B007P4YAPK,5,15,The camera is decent quality, the image is grainy and when zoomed in the image is very jagged/razor-like.
B007P4YAPK,5,16,Very good if you get good one.
B007P4YAPK,5,17,Very  good camera.Cons:1.
B007P4YAPK,5,18,But all and all I like it its a good price.
B007P4YAPK,5,19,It's not a super high resolution display, so the individual pixels are pretty good sized, and this was pretty noticeable.
B007P4YAPK,5,20,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,5,21,Some quick touch ups in an app, and the photo was pretty acceptable.-
B007P4YAPK,5,22,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,5,23,The front facing camera is clearly designed to be used in landscape mode.
B007P4YAPK,5,24,I have richer colors and much better picture quality on my cell phone.
B007P4YAPK,6,0,What a great tablet for the $$$ Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,1,Very nice for the price.
B007P4YAPK,6,2,What a pity, this could have been a great tablet
B007P4YAPK,6,3,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,6,4,Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,5,It fast, good for gamings and browsing.
B007P4YAPK,6,6,It's fast, smooth and very responsive, to my touch.
B007P4YAPK,6,7,5ghz dual band would be nice.
B007P4YAPK,6,8,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,6,9,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,6,10,It is fast and the touch screen is accurate.
B007P4YAPK,6,11,Nice tablet, though
B007P4YAPK,6,12,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,6,13,It out performs most everything out there, has great graphics, and is well made.
B007P4YAPK,6,14,Not the best, but fast enough to be relevant in 2014 and with a decent display and great expandability.
B007P4YAPK,6,15,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,6,16,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,6,17,Snappy responses and Tegra 3 video a plus.
B007P4YAPK,6,18,Good tablet for the time.
B007P4YAPK,6,19,The tablet looked great, was responsive, and relatively easy to navigate.
B007P4YAPK,6,20,I have found that the touchscreen is not very responsive at times.
B007P4YAPK,6,21,Great Android ICS Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,22,It has a quad core and 32Gig of storage.
B007P4YAPK,6,23,The best processor, decent memory, expandability, and at a price point that doesn't make my checkbook cry.Update for the new (4.3)
B007P4YAPK,6,24,But all and all I like it its a good price.
B007P4YAPK,7,0,I added a 32 Gig micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,7,1,HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6.
B007P4YAPK,7,2,Bought this tablet because the specs looked good and it had a micro SD card slot.
B007P4YAPK,7,3,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,7,4,The included SD slot makes it very expandable and is something that Nexus devices will never have.
B007P4YAPK,7,5,Plenty of storage space.
B007P4YAPK,7,6,I also love the fact that I can add memory to it although I still have a lot of memory left on the pre-installed memory card.
B007P4YAPK,7,7,RAM is expandable via a microSD card which is also a big plus.
B007P4YAPK,7,8,Still has full size  SDHC card slot on keyboard (yeah) and a Micro SDHC slot on the tablet  (big time yeah).
B007P4YAPK,7,9,Secondly the keyboard has an sd slot which lets you add an additional 32 gb of memory thereby making it a 96 gb tablet beating out both the ipad and the toshibas.
B007P4YAPK,7,10,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,7,11,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,7,12,The memory is 32gb, which is more then enough for most people.
B007P4YAPK,7,13,AND the screen is slightly larger than on an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,7,14,Not the best, but fast enough to be relevant in 2014 and with a decent display and great expandability.
B007P4YAPK,7,15,good product, but this model does not have sim card slot... builtin appliction for microsoft word editing is not impressive.
B007P4YAPK,7,16,I am ordering the micro SD card to boost additionally the speed and, of course, get more memory.
B007P4YAPK,7,17,I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts.
B007P4YAPK,7,18,For a tablet with the highest GB storage and the most recent android operating system these products are garbage and I would not recommend that anyone purchase them.
B007P4YAPK,7,19,The touch screen works great for the access.I had looked at tablets last year and tried a 7 inch one.
B007P4YAPK,7,20,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,7,21,The prime does come in a 64 gig model but, i find that a 32 works just fine for me especially if you dont mind taking the time to swap out micro sd cards thus making the memory a moot point and i didnt feel like waiting on the toshiba(i like instant gratification).
B007P4YAPK,7,22,Because you cant beat the price of 96GB pad (32 miniSD + 32gb SD in the Dock + 32 gb internal pad = 96GB), and the Ice Scream Sandwhich OS, and the "Netbook-Like" functionality, I have to give this atleast 4+ stars.Buy this, you will love it.
B007P4YAPK,7,23,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,7,24,I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable!
B007P4YAPK,8,0,Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,8,1,Her first computer.
B007P4YAPK,8,2,I like how easy it is to use.I use it more then my laptop.
B007P4YAPK,8,3,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,8,4,Great Tablet, Iffy browser.
B007P4YAPK,8,5,Its good for some things but not others.
B007P4YAPK,8,6,This tablet is my first foray into mobile devices smaller than a laptop computer.
B007P4YAPK,8,7,it's faster then my laptop.
B007P4YAPK,8,8,I can do just about all things I usually do on my computer but most important of all I can travel anywhere and have access to most of the apps that I used.
B007P4YAPK,8,9,Very good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,8,10,I have several desktop, laptop and netbook computers but this is my first tablet.
B007P4YAPK,8,11,When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.
B007P4YAPK,8,12,Web browsing is quite fast (I use Dolphin browser), and once I updated Adobe Flash, flash within web pages works great.
B007P4YAPK,8,13,The one thing I have an issue with is the browser.
B007P4YAPK,8,14,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,8,15,I like the size and use it instead of my laptop.
B007P4YAPK,8,16,Really love it for this, so I can take it anywhere, and connect to the internet.
B007P4YAPK,8,17,I just wanted it to do email and browse the internet while on the road, and for that, this should do the trick.
B007P4YAPK,8,18,But it works great with netflix, crunchyroll, xfinity, brighthousetv etc. so its nice for watching stuff while working out.
B007P4YAPK,8,19,If you're looking for something comprehensive like the iPad I would recommend this.
B007P4YAPK,8,20,It is a small thing but it played a big part of my choice to look beyond the iPad.If you're looking for a device for reading only, this is waaaaaaaay more than you need.
B007P4YAPK,8,21,good product.
B007P4YAPK,8,22,I wished that it worked better with all the Facebook games!
B007P4YAPK,8,23,Though the tablet is a great product.
B007P4YAPK,8,24,I prefer to just go back to my desktop if I really want to do some serious web browsing.
B007P4YAPK,9,0,Something that I can use for leisure but then I can use it for school note taking or paper writing as well with the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,9,1,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,9,2,Now, the SL101's keyboard is OK.
B007P4YAPK,9,3,I do have a few art/photo editing apps.
B007P4YAPK,9,4,It does better with touch.
B007P4YAPK,9,5,Great little touch pad.
B007P4YAPK,9,6,It always feels like I am trying to contort my hand to touch it, reaching over the keyboard, especially when it comes to touching the lower part of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,7,The keyboard also adds quite a few other features which i find i like.
B007P4YAPK,9,8,Also, when you have the screen at the best angle it can get (pretty much all the way back), when you touch the screen it has a tendency to tilt back because of the very fine balance the keyboard and the screen have.
B007P4YAPK,9,9,It feels very natural to reach from the keyboard to touching the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,10,I downloaded a swype like keyboard, like what my phone has, to make typing quicker.
B007P4YAPK,9,11,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,9,12,I love the android slide touch keyboard that comes with it.
B007P4YAPK,9,13,One thing I find somewhat funny/quirky, is the facial recognition.
B007P4YAPK,9,14,Great for reading without the keyboard, and perfect for email and editing with the keyboard.Highly recommended.
B007P4YAPK,9,15,I love the keyboard dock.
B007P4YAPK,9,16,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,17,Google apps works well, and it is easy with the keyboard to deal with email.8.
B007P4YAPK,9,18,It makes writing with the tablet so much easier.
B007P4YAPK,9,19,I originally got it without the keyboard, but then got the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,9,20,And with my big fingers, I finally figured out that by using a stylus, things happen much faster and more accurate.
B007P4YAPK,9,21,Another problem is app to app integration.
B007P4YAPK,9,22,The angle and position is perfect for promoting the use of your finger to touch the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,23,Touching the screen tips the balance.
B007P4YAPK,9,24,If you change windows when you are typing, you lose your document, no autosave or save functions on their document software.
B007P4YAPK,10,0,Otherwise I love it
B007P4YAPK,10,1,I love my tablet, once I got one that worked.
B007P4YAPK,10,2,Overall, I love this product.
B007P4YAPK,10,3,The size is perfect and it is easy to use and fast.
B007P4YAPK,10,4,tablet is good.
B007P4YAPK,10,5,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,6,Like somone said: wanted to love it but I just coul not.
B007P4YAPK,10,7,Love it!
B007P4YAPK,10,8,I do love the size of it and it is easy to use, just too slow.
B007P4YAPK,10,9,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,10,10,Great.
B007P4YAPK,10,11,I loved this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,10,12,I absolutely love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,10,13,I absolutely love this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,14,Very easy to use, lightweight, and perfectly customizable.
B007P4YAPK,10,15,And I love it even more.
B007P4YAPK,10,16,It is easy to learn, but there are problems.
B007P4YAPK,10,17,It's light, and very easy to tote around.Excellent product.
B007P4YAPK,10,18,I will take a nice fast PClaptop anyday over this.
B007P4YAPK,10,19,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,10,20,Good Product.
B007P4YAPK,10,21,Love it!
B007P4YAPK,10,22,nice tablet! the tablet is nice, it works fine, it is fast and versatile.the
B007P4YAPK,10,23,it's a pretty good product.
B007P4YAPK,10,24,Nice tablet.
B007P4YAPK,11,0,It also gives me usb ports.
B007P4YAPK,11,1,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,11,2,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,11,3,I would have liked to be able to use the keyboard from a distance, without it being connected to the tablet, which would have been nice considering the HDMI port.
B007P4YAPK,11,4,So i had to buy another cable.
B007P4YAPK,11,5,Nice.
B007P4YAPK,11,6,Came with keyboard that includes extra battery.
B007P4YAPK,11,7,Not necessary if you get the keyboard, however, as the keyboard has a full sized usb port built in.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Just found out that standard USB chargers (of any amperage) do not charge this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,11,8,I use it mostly with the keyboard and portfolio stand case to give me keyboard capability, to extend the battery life.
B007P4YAPK,11,9,I never tried to see if the old keyboard would work on the new one...the new one is a bit different...has one USB port instead of two (negative).
B007P4YAPK,11,10,I still prefer to be able to have additional power instead, but it would have been a nice feature to have bluetooth on the keyboard too.
B007P4YAPK,11,11,I purchased the keyboard dock and a bluetooth mouse to accompany the TF300.
B007P4YAPK,11,12,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,11,13,Now, the SL101's keyboard is OK.
B007P4YAPK,11,14,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,11,15,Nice tablet.
B007P4YAPK,11,16,Big, heavy, and likely to tip over if docking station attached.
B007P4YAPK,11,17,Yes, for the Asus you can buy the keyboard and attach it to the tablet, but then I might have well just bought a laptop (which is what I'm looking for now).I tried a couple of games on it.
B007P4YAPK,11,18,Having said that, I added a Poetic Hardback case which added a lot of stiffness/rigidity to the tablet.I'm very happy with the TF300, screen quality is good, has hdmi out, expandable storage via micro sd card slot, and you can add a USB adapter (which I bought) for external storage.
B007P4YAPK,11,19,The USB connection to my PC allows me to read this tablet like a hard drive.
B007P4YAPK,11,20,computer USB port or standard usb charger will not charge it.as
B007P4YAPK,11,21,Coupled with the keyboard dock it makes a pretty good laptop replacement.
B007P4YAPK,11,22,I still like it but not enough to warrant the $750 I now have invested in it and the docking keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,11,23,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,11,24,Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.
B007P4YAPK,12,0,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,12,1,This is a really nice tablet with the up to date Android operating system and is easy to navigate.
B007P4YAPK,12,2,It poops on the ipad.
B007P4YAPK,12,3,Great Android ICS Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,12,4,I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire.
B007P4YAPK,12,5,Interfaces just like my android phone.
B007P4YAPK,12,6,Android tablets can't use all software.
B007P4YAPK,12,7,This product may be right for someone, but not me since the Android phone I currently have has the same features as this and I really do not need two devices so similar.
B007P4YAPK,12,8,At first I was thinking I wouldn't be able to tell the difference... but I was wrong.This does not make me want to get the New iPad however, because I don't like the "Apple" way of doing things.
B007P4YAPK,12,9,My phone is an android so I understood the basics of how to operate.
B007P4YAPK,12,10,It was great until the last OS upgrade.
B007P4YAPK,12,11,better not to try this product right now.
B007P4YAPK,12,12,The only bad thing is android does not support flash anymore, other than that (which is not the product itself) it is perfect!
B007P4YAPK,12,13,You get a fast system, nice screen, the Ice Cream Sandwich with it.
B007P4YAPK,12,14,Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) is excellent.
B007P4YAPK,12,15,I know this review is about the Asus, but I want to say that I own 4 android tablet devices using various Android operating systems and user interfaces, and of those the best, easiest to use, most enjoyable combination is the one on the Amazon Fire.
B007P4YAPK,12,16,However, one of the main reasons I got this tablet was its upgrade to the Ice Cream Sandwich OS, and with the exception of the ability to make folders and thereby only needing one screen for all of my apps (I always have many more than I need), I'm NOT impressed with that new operating system.
B007P4YAPK,12,17,Many of the features are linked in to the operating system, Android 4.0 or "ice cream sandwich" ICS, and is finally up to par with Apple OS.
B007P4YAPK,12,18,And I love it even more.
B007P4YAPK,12,19,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,12,20,ICS is a very solid OS and has much good to offer.
B007P4YAPK,12,21,The whole operation is much faster.
B007P4YAPK,12,22,An I-Pad Competer.
B007P4YAPK,12,23,The first thing this tablet does when you connect it to WIFI is upgrade itself to Android Ice cream Sandwich (ICS).
B007P4YAPK,12,24,If you have an android phone, this is the way to go - all my phone apps were added automatically to tablet.4.
B007P4YAPK,13,0,The tablet was shipped USPS and was shipped on Tuesday.
B007P4YAPK,13,1,Product that i ordered is not the same i have.
B007P4YAPK,13,2,This is the first time I've had to return a product to Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,13,3,A++++++ for amazon customer service!!
B007P4YAPK,13,4,I waitied until the end of the day, and called Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,13,5,Good product, had shipping issues.
B007P4YAPK,13,6,The tablet is great and the service was great.
B007P4YAPK,13,7,I just want to commend Amazon on their amazing customer service.
B007P4YAPK,13,8,Product needs work.
B007P4YAPK,13,9,I also paid for expedited 2 day shipping.I did NOT get 2 day expedited shipping.
B007P4YAPK,13,10,overall i am happy with my purchase, and with the costumer service from amazon.
B007P4YAPK,13,11,She called me back the next afternoon to see if I had received it yet.
B007P4YAPK,13,12,I purchased this tablet along wit 3 other items.
B007P4YAPK,13,13,It took a few days for processing before items were shipped.
B007P4YAPK,13,14,Great product; even better customer service.
B007P4YAPK,13,15,Great.
B007P4YAPK,13,16,RETURNED
B007P4YAPK,13,17,Good price, great seller, good shipping, the cover that it came with smelled of smoke, but it was used after all, and in good condition over all.
B007P4YAPK,13,18,New Product Ordered but refurb received.
B007P4YAPK,13,19,Great Right?
B007P4YAPK,13,20,Everything was great, but....
B007P4YAPK,13,21,am giving a 2 star only for the tablet being good (but it had scratches behind).Hopefully i will never buy from the amazon warehouse deals.
B007P4YAPK,13,22,I ordered this tablet because of the price and the company reviews.
B007P4YAPK,13,23,It is for reasons like this that I will always support and buy my things through Amazon!!
B007P4YAPK,13,24,first one i got from amazon was defective, but i called amazon and they sent me a new one real fast with no hold ups.
B007P4YAPK,14,0,Screen seems pretty robust.
B007P4YAPK,14,1,Its good for some things but not others.
B007P4YAPK,14,2,Some of the problem is probably Windows stuff but the Windows machines don't even see the tablet but the tablet sees the Windows machines.
B007P4YAPK,14,3,I am impressed with the features, the graphics of the screen and the allaround design of the Asus Transformer.
B007P4YAPK,14,4,Think I'll wait for the iPad 3. Nice try ASUS, but you've have GOT to perfect this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,14,5,As much as I prefer Android, this experience has made me lean towards an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,14,6,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,14,7,Love the small size...easy to carry around instead of my big  laptop.
B007P4YAPK,14,8,This tablet is my first foray into mobile devices smaller than a laptop computer.
B007P4YAPK,14,9,For what the tablet is designed for, it excels.The tablet even functions very well as a laptop replacement.
B007P4YAPK,14,10,The Android OS is not quite up with the user interfaces we would expect with Microsoft Office or Apple products.
B007P4YAPK,14,11,Unfortunately, the two main business software applications I planned to use require a Windows OS.
B007P4YAPK,14,12,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,14,13,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,14,14,I used it extensively as it is a great tablet PC with fantastic functionality, speed, software, etc.
B007P4YAPK,14,15,it does have some apps that you can BUY extra but even then there limited and smaller programs from the originals.
B007P4YAPK,14,16,It's really too bad, Asus does a good job on the software end, and it screamed in the short time I had it.
B007P4YAPK,14,17,The screen format is wide screen so a better match to modern TVs and monitors than the Apple 4x5 format.
B007P4YAPK,14,18,While it is not a perfect laptop replacement (scrolling using the mouse or mousepad in particular takes a bit of getting used to and is subpar compared to a laptop), using the keyboard and mouse with the pre-installed office suite is simple, easy, and impressively powerful too.
B007P4YAPK,14,19,The physical design is pretty nice.
B007P4YAPK,14,20,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,14,21,is Android 4.0 stable at all? was looking at ASUS TRansformer and Samsung Galaxy android 4 devices.
B007P4YAPK,14,22,The screen is beautiful and I love the expandable memory capability.
B007P4YAPK,14,23,It's ok but... Replaced my Acer Iconia A500 with this.
B007P4YAPK,14,24,That being said, the Pad's screen is a bit underwhelming.
B007P4YAPK,15,0,You can tell the difference between the screen switched off and the black color in the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,1,I can see the black color all over the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,2,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,15,3,When my screen is black, I notice some light bleed in a few of the corners, but it's nothing major and becomes unnoticeable when the screen is displaying colors other than black.
B007P4YAPK,15,4,There was also some light bleed on the edges of the screen, noticeable only when viewing dark images/video.
B007P4YAPK,15,5,Screen tearing issues.
B007P4YAPK,15,6,The screen sensitivity is very good though.
B007P4YAPK,15,7,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,8,But about a month ago, I noticed small little blotches in my screen that are white to greyish in color, but are only visible when the screen is displaying deep blacks.
B007P4YAPK,15,9,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,15,10,Tablet two appeared to have a foreign object stuck under the glass of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,11,drops, excessive pressure, something being dropped on to the screen, misuse, etc.).
B007P4YAPK,15,12,The screen was okay other than some backlight bleeding along the edges.
B007P4YAPK,15,13,This is actually my second TF300 that has had issues with the display as the first tablet I bought had really bad problems with what looks like bad contrasts that caused my screen to make very distinct graduations between colors when they were gradually going from a black to white like a fading sensation.
B007P4YAPK,15,14,I would have been fine if the color was washed out like the bottom or bright white like the top, but the gradient just annoyed me.
B007P4YAPK,15,15,Bad Pixel.
B007P4YAPK,15,16,Tablet one had a stuck-on pixel close to the center of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,17,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B007P4YAPK,15,18,My screen is horrible i cannot use it in a dark room at all it looks horrible.
B007P4YAPK,15,19,Very good except for the screen scratch protection surface.
B007P4YAPK,15,20,Good visibility and good view angles.
B007P4YAPK,15,21,Where ever I was, when set on auto, the tablet screen always adjusted to the most dim.
B007P4YAPK,15,22,They were about the size of a pea and appeared in two different areas of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,23,They were noticeably brighter than the rest of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,24,It's really pretty minor, but I notice when holding it at the corners that the screen edge can be squeezed into the case a fraction of a millimeter.
B007P4YAPK,16,0,When I end-task on some Apps, they relaunch at same state.
B007P4YAPK,16,1,There are many ugly Apps that do not work well.
B007P4YAPK,16,2,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,16,3,(Other android devices do with no problem).
B007P4YAPK,16,4,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,16,5,In Apple world we have millions of apps to choose from the App Store and those are mostly high quality apps.
B007P4YAPK,16,6,The app store for Apple is way better.
B007P4YAPK,16,7,And there really is no dearth of tablet specific apps on Android, that's just a myth now.I have returned my device as of now but will be ordering another soon.
B007P4YAPK,16,8,NO MORE ANDROID TABLET FOR ME.
B007P4YAPK,16,9,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,16,10,The Google Play lets anyone upload an app and thus even though there are seems to be plenty to choose from, the tablet version of the apps are really stretched out phone apps.
B007P4YAPK,16,11,Great product only one issue, Adobe Flash says it is not supporting this version of android OS which makes viewing certain web pages not possible.
B007P4YAPK,16,12,Once an app is running and in-focus, it runs fine.
B007P4YAPK,16,13,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,16,14,(too late for the apps that are already installed on it by Asus).
B007P4YAPK,16,15,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,16,16,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,16,17,Even YouTube videos.
B007P4YAPK,16,18,Another Android Rubbish.
B007P4YAPK,16,19,I still have complaints with some apps not optimized though, but this I think is the same with all android devices.
B007P4YAPK,16,20,My only disappointment is that there isn't a version of Adobe Flash player for this OS yet!
B007P4YAPK,16,21,If the user does not accept the permission the apps is not installed.
B007P4YAPK,16,22,The only other small problem I've had is when maximizing Youtube videos to full-screen - sometimes it doesn't play correctly, (EDIT 070612 -- the Youtube App automatically updated recently and I no longer sometimes have a problem with maximizing video - it works perfectly now every time.)I've
B007P4YAPK,16,23,The Android OS isn't polished either.
B007P4YAPK,16,24,Still waiting for the games to start showing up for it in the play storeAnother plus is the support and following this tablet is seeing at Xda forums already.
B007P4YAPK,17,0,It is a waste of money
B007P4YAPK,17,1,ok for the money.
B007P4YAPK,17,2,Not good product.
B007P4YAPK,17,3,What a waste of money, I could Just Puke!!!
B007P4YAPK,17,4,I bought this in May and I waited until now to review this product so I know I have tried everything there is to it.
B007P4YAPK,17,5,Guess I should have bought an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,17,6,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,17,7,Defective product - would not buy again.
B007P4YAPK,17,8,Not worth your money, time, or anything really.
B007P4YAPK,17,9,not as good as the reviews.
B007P4YAPK,17,10,Don't buy.
B007P4YAPK,17,11,I don't know if this usually happens with other tablets but i will never buy another asus
B007P4YAPK,17,12,Don't buy anything from Asus.
B007P4YAPK,17,13,I will never buy ASUS again.
B007P4YAPK,17,14,Save your money and sanity.
B007P4YAPK,17,15,they doesn't return full money.
B007P4YAPK,17,16,I'm 62 years old and have dealt with quite a few.I will NEVER, EVER, buy any ASUS product again and will never recommend that company.
B007P4YAPK,17,17,I used to buy Asus productsd all the time.
B007P4YAPK,17,18,I'm not wasting my time on them.
B007P4YAPK,17,19,Don't buy this junk!
B007P4YAPK,17,20,My first tablet, my last ASUS product.
B007P4YAPK,17,21,Very good if you get good one.
B007P4YAPK,17,22,I bought my Asus 6 months ago.
B007P4YAPK,17,23,Evidently I bought the tablet from "Amazon Wharehouse" which can not be returned after 30 days.
B007P4YAPK,17,24,It's very prominent, and it's a brand new product.
B007P4YAPK,18,0,It would charge then stop charging in a contual cycle.
B007P4YAPK,18,1,I tried some temp fixes to try and get it charged again.
B007P4YAPK,18,2,WON'T CHARGE.
B007P4YAPK,18,3,Now I can't turn it on.
B007P4YAPK,18,4,Had it for 3 days and could not charge it.
B007P4YAPK,18,5,It worked for 4 days before it would not turn on.
B007P4YAPK,18,6,My tablet would not charge from either charger, but both chargers work with her tablet.
B007P4YAPK,18,7,The pluses were battery and dolby.
B007P4YAPK,18,8,Sometimes the system says there is no battery after it was charging for several times.
B007P4YAPK,18,9,I plugged it in and did not get the battery symbol.
B007P4YAPK,18,10,"52seconds on 100% battery charge.." really?
B007P4YAPK,18,11,If you see the battery symbol is low charge for 8 hours.
B007P4YAPK,18,12,This time i couldn't turn it back on.
B007P4YAPK,18,13,does not turn on.
B007P4YAPK,18,14,Powerful and has a good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,18,15,Now the power doesn't seem to work.
B007P4YAPK,18,16,Power doesn't work...
B007P4YAPK,18,17,Bad charger-seems to be a problem.... Tablet worked well until I tried to charge it after its first battery drain the first day of use.
B007P4YAPK,18,18,I usually get 2 days out of it before I charge it.
B007P4YAPK,18,19,It keeps turning off.
B007P4YAPK,18,20,I have had this unit for a month plus 4 days and it will no longer charge.
B007P4YAPK,18,21,When it plugged in, power button blinked twice.
B007P4YAPK,18,22,Though I returned it 4 days later.Reason: after a couple days of use and letting the battery die, the device would not charge.
B007P4YAPK,18,23,When the battery is very low, even if it's plugged in, you cannot turn it on for 5 minutes or so until it charges up a little (not sure this is specific to only this tablet).5.
B007P4YAPK,18,24,Plugged into the wall and let it charge few hours.
B007P4YAPK,19,0,Quality control issue.
B007P4YAPK,19,1,Really bad build quality.
B007P4YAPK,19,2,But I noticed the replacement has a different issue: a gap along the bezzel on the left side of the screen near the volume button.
B007P4YAPK,19,3,As for speakers, it only has one, on the right (or bottom) side.
B007P4YAPK,19,4,(You can get a $100 tablet from Pandigital, etc. that will stream video and audio at the same pace quality.)Also,
B007P4YAPK,19,5,Feels cheap.
B007P4YAPK,19,6,The build quality of the unit is an issue and should be recalled.
B007P4YAPK,19,7,Cannot believe the lack of quality!
B007P4YAPK,19,8,It has surprisingly loud audio, but it lacks stereo output (either because there's just one speaker, or, if there are two speakers, they're too close together).
B007P4YAPK,19,9,The plastic back cover is of poor quality.
B007P4YAPK,19,10,It's a little top heavy and having the speakers on the side is a little annoying but worth the price!
B007P4YAPK,19,11,I bought this tablet in February of 2013 and it stopped working (no video, no audio) in June, 2014.
B007P4YAPK,19,12,ASUS definitely needs better quality control.
B007P4YAPK,19,13,ASUS quality obviously has gone way down.
B007P4YAPK,19,14,The Tablet itself is of poor quality.
B007P4YAPK,19,15,Will never buy Asus again, seems like their quality control is horrible.
B007P4YAPK,19,16,What kind of quality is that?
B007P4YAPK,19,17,I like the build quality.
B007P4YAPK,19,18,The speakers are OK, but don't get very loud but they're acceptable.
B007P4YAPK,19,19,The applications all downloaded easily and work well, I bought an external speaker to listen through the speakers on the tablet are fine.
B007P4YAPK,19,20,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,19,21,That being said, the Pad's screen is a bit underwhelming.
B007P4YAPK,19,22,It has cheap plastic feel to it because it has a cheap plastic screen instead of the glass like on iPad.
B007P4YAPK,19,23,Power and volume buttons are slightly raised allowing you to easily access them even when it's a in case.9.
B007P4YAPK,19,24,The power button is poorly constructed, kept getting stuck, and so the tablet kept thinking it needed to restart constantly.
B007P4YAPK,20,0,Especially near the forward facing camera.
B007P4YAPK,20,1,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B007P4YAPK,20,2,i have not had occasion to use the camera other than to check out how it works.
B007P4YAPK,20,3,A one star rating is even too good.
B007P4YAPK,20,4,Then I tried camera, wouldn't switch from  photo to video, error message " unfortunately camera stopped working" .....really?
B007P4YAPK,20,5,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,20,6,The camera has become completely useless.
B007P4YAPK,20,7,Maybe is my bad luck.
B007P4YAPK,20,8,My first unit had a defective camera with auto focusing problem.
B007P4YAPK,20,9,The TF201 model, which has a well-known problem with WiFi and GPS signals, has a better working camera (8MP back camera), but the GPS signal on TF300 is still very poor compared to other tablets such as Samsung Galaxy 2 7.0in.
B007P4YAPK,20,10,Just bad luck on my part I guess.
B007P4YAPK,20,11,not good.
B007P4YAPK,20,12,My screen is horrible i cannot use it in a dark room at all it looks horrible.
B007P4YAPK,20,13,The screen sensitivity is very good though.
B007P4YAPK,20,14,the only thing wrong so far is that i expected the back of the tablet to be "blue".
B007P4YAPK,20,15,Slow to load apps.
B007P4YAPK,20,16,Certain apps don't work on the tab and alot of apps seem like they are still in the beta phase.
B007P4YAPK,20,17,bad digitizer and no manufacturer suppor.
B007P4YAPK,20,18,I usually have the screen at 80-100%- I really like that the screen can actually get pretty dark.
B007P4YAPK,20,19,Used to be good stuff; now it's cheap junky construction that has to be handled like eggshells, and even then, the screen will crack.
B007P4YAPK,20,20,Only time I have ever seen that is when I intentionally push hard on the front or back.
B007P4YAPK,20,21,only 1 thing wrong.
B007P4YAPK,20,22,Overall, for the price of this tablet, I don't think you can get any better!
B007P4YAPK,20,23,Maybe its just bad luck for me but I won't recommend this buggy product to anyone.
B007P4YAPK,20,24,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,21,0,That is the same performance I expect from a tablet and this ASUS never has, not even when new.
B007P4YAPK,21,1,The speed of the processor was a let down.
B007P4YAPK,21,2,Slow to load apps.
B007P4YAPK,21,3,My nexus is a better performer.
B007P4YAPK,21,4,Besides quad core the tablet is very slow in response.
B007P4YAPK,21,5,While I was not expecting the same performance of the more expensive ipad, I never expected such a poor performing tablet as the asus 300tf.
B007P4YAPK,21,6,I've always gathered that Asus was among the leaders in the Android tablet game, so I'm rather disappointed.
B007P4YAPK,21,7,Asus, you've gotta get all that quad core processing to work with android better!
B007P4YAPK,21,8,I expected much more from Asus.
B007P4YAPK,21,9,Too slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,10,Was hoping it was a little bit better.
B007P4YAPK,21,11,Overall, for the price of this tablet, I don't think you can get any better!
B007P4YAPK,21,12,asus tf300.
B007P4YAPK,21,13,I would expect it to do a lot and very fast but it hangs and is very slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,14,regarding asus tf300 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,21,15,disappointed in the performance.
B007P4YAPK,21,16,ASUS TF300 Software.
B007P4YAPK,21,17,ASUS Transformer TF300.
B007P4YAPK,21,18,Is it too much to ask to be able to load pages at a speed greater than dialup?
B007P4YAPK,21,19,Transformer TF300 is Great.
B007P4YAPK,21,20,Tegra-3 processor, 4 core.1G
B007P4YAPK,21,21,My unit always has the latest android available from ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,21,22,Its ok if you use it just for that but dont expect this to do anything more.
B007P4YAPK,21,23,But its really good for the price!
B007P4YAPK,21,24,Performs well normally.
B007P4YAPK,22,0,I have no SD card installed.
B007P4YAPK,22,1,Thus SD storage is not available during debugging.
B007P4YAPK,22,2,I am ordering the micro SD card to boost additionally the speed and, of course, get more memory.
B007P4YAPK,22,3,I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts.
B007P4YAPK,22,4,transferring larger files or folders from the micro sd card will fail a lot of times it just sits there with its little window open with nothing happening.
B007P4YAPK,22,5,Also, while I was trying to copy me music file to the tablet, several times, It shows a copy window but not copying.
B007P4YAPK,22,6,It has a socket and service for an LTE sim card.
B007P4YAPK,22,7,In Apple world we have millions of apps to choose from the App Store and those are mostly high quality apps.
B007P4YAPK,22,8,The tablet has difficulty recognizing a microSD card when it is plugged in.
B007P4YAPK,22,9,first wifi direct connects but that is it, its not in the menu to transfer files and it does not accept incoming files this is a pain because wifi direct can transfer large files (music video) in seconds sometime quicker than USB.
B007P4YAPK,22,10,The only issue I have is that the unit was an AT&T; device previously.
B007P4YAPK,22,11,file system?
B007P4YAPK,22,12,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,22,13,If the user does not accept the permission the apps is not installed.
B007P4YAPK,22,14,I aim to leave the internal memory primarily for apps and app data - I'm sure it will take many years for me to even approach filling it up.Android 4 (ICS) is an absolute joy to use, much better than I anticipated.
B007P4YAPK,22,15,It treats SD cards like you're only swapping a bit of data and taking it out.
B007P4YAPK,22,16,(Other android devices do with no problem).
B007P4YAPK,22,17,It is our choice what we install and what we do not install on our units.
B007P4YAPK,22,18,I added a 32 Gig micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,22,19,Ram(some said it is 2G), 32G storage.
B007P4YAPK,22,20,I have been told that there is a better key board app that can be down loaded.
B007P4YAPK,22,21,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,22,22,The system still running, and I can still retrieve my file using the USB.
B007P4YAPK,22,23,In Apple world the app asks the operating system to use something that requires permission and the operating system asks user to grant that permission.
B007P4YAPK,22,24,The included SD slot makes it very expandable and is something that Nexus devices will never have.
B007P4YAPK,23,0,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,23,1,It would not connect to the internet despite having a router connection.
B007P4YAPK,23,2,The noted internet work around is to go in to settings > wifi > forget the network, the reenter the network password - volia 52 mbs (unfortunately you need to do this each time you suspend the device).
B007P4YAPK,23,3,Browsing the Internet crashes.
B007P4YAPK,23,4,I haven't had any problems with it.
B007P4YAPK,23,5,My only complaint with it is that its wireless doesn't seem to make as good of a connection as it should.
B007P4YAPK,23,6,The WiFi is slow, even though I have a high speed N network using a top-notch wireless router.
B007P4YAPK,23,7,Now, mind you that I have a wifi router 2 feet from me and a perfect wifi connection.
B007P4YAPK,23,8,(Other android devices do with no problem).
B007P4YAPK,23,9,Too slow.
B007P4YAPK,23,10,I have a pretty strong wireless signal in my bedroom but this tablet seems to often drop the signal.
B007P4YAPK,23,11,He does state that if it connects to wifi there they would just send it back.
B007P4YAPK,23,12,Except perhaps the toaster.This tablet crashes constantly.
B007P4YAPK,23,13,constant crashing.
B007P4YAPK,23,14,Bad Wi-Fi Antenna.
B007P4YAPK,23,15,The one thing I have an issue with is the browser.
B007P4YAPK,23,16,Annoying problems.
B007P4YAPK,23,17,from day one I have had trouble with the device being a little slow and if I let things get backed up it'll crash.
B007P4YAPK,23,18,Generally the ASUS is ok, but it had a hard time picking up a strong wi-fi signal at home so the download was too slow and sometimes it would time out, while the i-pad had a full signal strength.
B007P4YAPK,23,19,Touchsreen problems within 10 days.
B007P4YAPK,23,20,Also when the tablet wakes up from suspend mode, the wifi connection speed is significantly less.
B007P4YAPK,23,21,Apps, browser and native email program freeze up all the time, probably about 10-20% of the time.3.
B007P4YAPK,23,22,After restarting the unit, telling it to forget the router then resetting the password, and even rebooting the router it still would not connect.
B007P4YAPK,23,23,Accessing my network drive crashes.
B007P4YAPK,23,24,My wifi connection rarely registers a full signal even though I use the tablet in the same room as the router most of the time.7.
B007P4YAPK,24,0,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,24,1,Touch screen didn't work!
B007P4YAPK,24,2,The screen immediately stopped reacting to touch.
B007P4YAPK,24,3,Cracked Screen.
B007P4YAPK,24,4,The on screen keyboard takes some getting used to.
B007P4YAPK,24,5,Screen Cracked while in Dock.
B007P4YAPK,24,6,There was also a dot on screen that followed were you'd touch., which I thought wasn't normal.
B007P4YAPK,24,7,I did what they said and it worked, but then only two weeks later the screen stopped responding again.
B007P4YAPK,24,8,There are several others who have had the cracked screen problem.
B007P4YAPK,24,9,ASUS TF 300 touch screen quit after 5 weeks.
B007P4YAPK,24,10,Back in mid-July I was on the couch using the tablet (without the keyboard) when the touch screen just stopped responding.
B007P4YAPK,24,11,Constantly Freezes, touch screen stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,24,12,And it wasn't touch responsive.
B007P4YAPK,24,13,Then touch screen started behaving crazy.
B007P4YAPK,24,14,The touch screen stopped responding but for awhile I could dock it to the keyboard and it would respond.
B007P4YAPK,24,15,Now the touch screen is useless.....useless.
B007P4YAPK,24,16,Then touch screen started behaving crazy.
B007P4YAPK,24,17,This tablet was great ... for a month, then the touch screen became unresponsive for no apparent reason.
B007P4YAPK,24,18,Add me to the group of cracked screen.
B007P4YAPK,24,19,The touch screen does not work correctly.
B007P4YAPK,24,20,Kept getting touches not registering, and phantom touches registering where I wasn't touching.They sent the same unit back with the same problems.
B007P4YAPK,24,21,When we received the tablet back the touch screen worked perfectly.
B007P4YAPK,24,22,Although during the second day I did have a screen glitch where the screen would gitter up and down.
B007P4YAPK,24,23,I returned that one the next day because it was so slow and the touch screen was random.
B007P4YAPK,24,24,My tablet have an screen failure.
B007P4YAPK,25,0,I don't want a $600 device.
B007P4YAPK,25,1,I didn't want to go the ipad route.
B007P4YAPK,25,2,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,25,3,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,25,4,Give me the simplicity and functionality of an Android device like this any day.
B007P4YAPK,25,5,I sent it back and got the Samsung Galaxy tab2.
B007P4YAPK,25,6,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,25,7,(Other android devices do with no problem).
B007P4YAPK,25,8,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,25,9,But people buy this rubbish and leave good reviews because they have not had an iPad in their hands.If you want a tablet get an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,25,10,I've purchased five iPads over the years, starting with the very first generation and none had screen issues; neither did my Samsung Galaxy Tab.
B007P4YAPK,25,11,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,25,12,But comparing this to the iPad 2, why should I put up with this behavior?
B007P4YAPK,25,13,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,25,14,Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,25,15,is Android 4.0 stable at all? was looking at ASUS TRansformer and Samsung Galaxy android 4 devices.
B007P4YAPK,25,16,My 2 year old Samsung Galaxy S I now feels like a Ferrari compared to this product.
B007P4YAPK,25,17,Hopefully this will change since there are so many great Android products out now.
B007P4YAPK,25,18,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,25,19,I would not buy this for a personal everyday use, because this is an Android device, which is an inferior product to the Apple iPad.
B007P4YAPK,25,20,Might not have noticed but I also have access to Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 devices.
B007P4YAPK,25,21,In Apple world we have millions of apps to choose from the App Store and those are mostly high quality apps.
B007P4YAPK,25,22,I've used an iPad before and have owned an iPhone since it was released.
B007P4YAPK,25,23,I'm a big fan of android, and I own an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,25,24,Android should not feel this "beta" given this is a 2nd generation Android tablet and Android itself has been around for years now.
B007P4YAPK,26,0,It would charge then stop charging in a contual cycle.
B007P4YAPK,26,1,computer USB port or standard usb charger will not charge it.as
B007P4YAPK,26,2,I tried some temp fixes to try and get it charged again.
B007P4YAPK,26,3,I don't like the propriety plug, and the no USB port.
B007P4YAPK,26,4,Another charger is $30--will I have the same problen with that one?
B007P4YAPK,26,5,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,26,6,The tablet did not have POWER and so put the charger cable on.The table did not charge.
B007P4YAPK,26,7,Not necessary if you get the keyboard, however, as the keyboard has a full sized usb port built in.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Just found out that standard USB chargers (of any amperage) do not charge this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,26,8,Plugging in a micro hdmi cord was a little difficult due to this, and I am sure the port would break off if i did it often.
B007P4YAPK,26,9,Issues with charger cable - loose fit.
B007P4YAPK,26,10,That cable that comes with it can get power from an ordinary USB port, but the amount of power would be so low it would take the whole day to recharge from a standard USB.
B007P4YAPK,26,11,Then my HDMI port got a short.
B007P4YAPK,26,12,Also, you pretty much have to use the tablet upside-down when the adapter or the power cord is connected.
B007P4YAPK,26,13,This tablet requires the ASUS-only 15 volt adapter in the wall to charge.
B007P4YAPK,26,14,Almost all other chargers use the USB standard 5 volts (including iPad or Nexus 7).
B007P4YAPK,26,15,I have the USB adapter but its not great.
B007P4YAPK,26,16,I had to separately order a power supply chord because without the chord I can only use it until it ran out of power.
B007P4YAPK,26,17,Do micro-USBs not provide enough power?
B007P4YAPK,26,18,Only problem was the micro chip port.
B007P4YAPK,26,19,I would have liked to be able to use the keyboard from a distance, without it being connected to the tablet, which would have been nice considering the HDMI port.
B007P4YAPK,26,20,Put the charger in the freezer to reset the thermal breaker--yes it worked, so far..... Currently it is charging.
B007P4YAPK,26,21,Using the provided transformer, the tablet and keyboard are recharged within a few hours.The keyboard has support for 1 USB port, which I did not try yet except to recharge my phone.
B007P4YAPK,26,22,I flipped it upside down to find the charging port broken, I presume from detaching from the keyboard dock the previous night.
B007P4YAPK,26,23,I bought my 1st TF300t through TigerDirect.Com only to return it after 2 days of use.Reason: would not recognize the device via the usb cable connected to a computer (I tried 4 computers I happen to have an extra usb cable which wasn't the problem)I bought my 2nd TF300t through Amazon.Com.
B007P4YAPK,26,24,In the end, I decided that the USB adapter and this tablet would suffice.
B007P4YAPK,27,0,In Apple world the app asks the operating system to use something that requires permission and the operating system asks user to grant that permission.
B007P4YAPK,27,1,Am just getting into the modern world and this is something I have to learn.. perhaps the things I dislike are fixable when I find out how to do it.
B007P4YAPK,27,2,I had to go on line and find out how to operate it for the most part.
B007P4YAPK,27,3,IWOULD LIKE TO HAVE HAD A USER MANUAL WITH IT.
B007P4YAPK,27,4,Without even installing any apps the system started constantly freezing.
B007P4YAPK,27,5,The tablet hangs a lot, even after all kinds of reset, restarts problem still persists.
B007P4YAPK,27,6,GPS locking is OK.
B007P4YAPK,27,7,Restarting the device fixed the problem temporarily.
B007P4YAPK,27,8,Cannot be reset  or fixed.
B007P4YAPK,27,9,Once I turned it back on, it was fine and it never happened again.It had a GPS, but the only time it would show me my location was when I would connected to a Wifi signal.
B007P4YAPK,27,10,did not see issues related to bleeding screen, system resets, etc.However, occasionally, sound will be muted/gone.
B007P4YAPK,27,11,The manual that it comes with is mostly safety and cert pages.
B007P4YAPK,27,12,Reboot by itself and doesn't want to turn on again.
B007P4YAPK,27,13,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,27,14,Asus just downloaded a firmware update tonight so lets see if that fixes anything.7/7/12:
B007P4YAPK,27,15,Sometimes takes about 4-5min to lock down the location.-
B007P4YAPK,27,16,I tried ASUS support and that is next to useless.
B007P4YAPK,27,17,It took about 3 weeks until the tablet returned and about one week later the problem returned.I sent it to ASUS repair again, and it was returned about 3 weeks later.
B007P4YAPK,27,18,I certainly learned a few things and found it useful.Overall, I'm overjoyed with the unit.
B007P4YAPK,27,19,The whole system became unstable, switching screens randomly etc. sent it to Asus they charged me and said they fixed it, but the problem persists and Asus is nowhere to be seen.Very disappointed in the customer service, and in the resilience of the Transformer.
B007P4YAPK,27,20,However, after the OS get updated by JellyBean, my tablet starts to shut down (reboot) by itself.
B007P4YAPK,27,21,This time i couldn't turn it back on.
B007P4YAPK,27,22,But this week it started turning off randomly.
B007P4YAPK,27,23,My one year with the TF300T has been a very disappointing one.
B007P4YAPK,27,24,Sometime was slow and would occasionally hang up.
B007P4YAPK,28,0,I contacted ASUS customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,1,Asus Tf 300.
B007P4YAPK,28,2,It took about 3 weeks until the tablet returned and about one week later the problem returned.I sent it to ASUS repair again, and it was returned about 3 weeks later.
B007P4YAPK,28,3,Incomplete product without a chord.
B007P4YAPK,28,4,I was assured that my tablet was still under warranty and that I could send it in for assessment and possible repair.
B007P4YAPK,28,5,They have no incentive to provide any actual customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,6,It was returned to ASUS under warranty.
B007P4YAPK,28,7,I called customer support and they were no help.
B007P4YAPK,28,8,so I called ASUS support by phone.
B007P4YAPK,28,9,This is the first time I've had to return a product to Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,28,10,No warranty or support.
B007P4YAPK,28,11,That is a problem Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,28,12,6 weeks later, the product was returned and it works for 1 month.
B007P4YAPK,28,13,While ASUS is willing to make the repairs, I have to pay the shipping to their repair facility.
B007P4YAPK,28,14,They don't have the replacement number for their own product?
B007P4YAPK,28,15,Touchsreen problems within 10 days.
B007P4YAPK,28,16,Asus TF201.
B007P4YAPK,28,17,SO I contacted ASUS Support and got it repaired, but the the problems were not completely fixed.
B007P4YAPK,28,18,ASUS contracts out to some company in Jamaica for its support.
B007P4YAPK,28,19,They told me it was at the repair facility but had not been received.
B007P4YAPK,28,20,Horrible customer support from ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,28,21,I have owned the Asus TF300T 32G for 10 months.
B007P4YAPK,28,22,I have not called customer service yet as I keep hoping they will fix these issues with another update.
B007P4YAPK,28,23,they told me I needed to send it in--at my cost--they would evaluate it and send me a quote.
B007P4YAPK,28,24,He said tech support was very backlogged.
B007P4YAPK,29,0,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,29,1,Some of the problem is probably Windows stuff but the Windows machines don't even see the tablet but the tablet sees the Windows machines.
B007P4YAPK,29,2,Other times, I need to click, click, click click click.
B007P4YAPK,29,3,A few other times the screen wouldn't turn back on even though I'm pushing the power button multiple times.
B007P4YAPK,29,4,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,29,5,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,29,6,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,29,7,(too late for the apps that are already installed on it by Asus).
B007P4YAPK,29,8,Tab screen keep clicking and moving by itself.
B007P4YAPK,29,9,You have to hunt the settings to find that you can switch to the default android keyboard that works properly.Looser Experience:The first thing the tablet did after booting up it found it's firmware update, it updated itself.
B007P4YAPK,29,10,While I was online with him, my tablet suddenly started selecting multiple apps and opening and shutting them, without my finger anywhere near the screen.
B007P4YAPK,29,11,I like all capacity this tablet gives me, the only thing i don't like very much is the presicion for pointing places on the screen.
B007P4YAPK,29,12,The machine runs things pretty well...once they get going.
B007P4YAPK,29,13,I've also seen it scroll across 2 or more screens when I only want to scroll across 1, or just completely drop scrolling actions.
B007P4YAPK,29,14,This thing gets laggy and misses touch presses too much.
B007P4YAPK,29,15,It would finally come on but it would show the welcome screen and boot up as if I did a restart, but obviously I didn't.
B007P4YAPK,29,16,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,29,17,It looked OK when I started the device, but even before I installed my applications the screen started flickering again, and a lot worse that before.
B007P4YAPK,29,18,Sometimes i'm forced to use my little finger.
B007P4YAPK,29,19,A re-installation of the app usually fixes this problem.
B007P4YAPK,29,20,If anyone knows how to put this tablet into diagnostic mode let me know so I can figure out if this is a hardware or software issue.I'll try to update this review as I log more time with the unit.
B007P4YAPK,29,21,Although during the second day I did have a screen glitch where the screen would gitter up and down.
B007P4YAPK,29,22,Also,  some Tegra 3 optimized games crash from time to time.
B007P4YAPK,29,23,They give you a screen cleaner and you will use it quite a bit, every few days the screen needs a good wipe as the finger prints start to become very visible.
B007P4YAPK,29,24,i know that is a very minor thing to be concerned about, however it is (so far) the ONLY thing i don't like about my new asus.
