B008DWG5HE,0,0,Way better then the Kindle!
B008DWG5HE,0,1,I love my new tablet.
B008DWG5HE,0,2,Love it!!!!
B008DWG5HE,0,3,Better than the Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,0,4,Love this, way better than an ipad.
B008DWG5HE,0,5,Love, love, love this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,0,6,But even though I have both Kindle Fire HDs which I also love, I missed the Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,0,7,Comparing ipad 3 and this one I would say I like this better, much better!!!
B008DWG5HE,0,8,I can now read books again and do so much more.
B008DWG5HE,0,9,For those who wants to use this device to read.
B008DWG5HE,0,10,Well I really love it.
B008DWG5HE,0,11,I love it.
B008DWG5HE,0,12,I suggest you buy amazon kindle fire HD, although there's no S-pen.
B008DWG5HE,0,13,The SGN 10.1 is my second tablet, the first being the original Kindle Fire.
B008DWG5HE,0,14,Late last year I got a Kindle Fire and this spring I went for a smartphone.
B008DWG5HE,0,15,Looking for something better than an iPad?
B008DWG5HE,0,16,And I confess, I bought one of the first iPads when they came out, have upgraded every time since so am pretty much married to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,0,17,Better Than the IPad!
B008DWG5HE,0,18,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,0,19,I own an original ipad, a Sony xperia, a Kindle 7" and a Kindle 8.9" and now the Galaxy note.
B008DWG5HE,0,20,My wife has an ipad and I wanted an android product after reselling by Blackberry playbook, mainly because of the size of its screen.
B008DWG5HE,0,21,I think it's superior to the iPad in so many ways.
B008DWG5HE,0,22,The only advantage the iPad has over it is the "HD" retina display.
B008DWG5HE,0,23,If you're debating between this and an iPad, I think this is a clear winner unless you have a specific need for the iPad's breathtaking Retina display.
B008DWG5HE,0,24,iPad isn't.
B008DWG5HE,1,0,Not sure how games play out on it but videos look great.
B008DWG5HE,1,1,You have so many App.s that can be found at the Google Play store, many are free.
B008DWG5HE,1,2,One for their store and one for their apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,3,I think this will be a useful app as well.
B008DWG5HE,1,4,I use the Kindle app for reading.
B008DWG5HE,1,5,I also watch Netflix movies , read kindle books and Google play magazines on it.
B008DWG5HE,1,6,Also, every app I have looked at seems to be 40-50% cheaper on the Amazon app site than on Play Store.
B008DWG5HE,1,7,I down loaded the Video player MX-Video there is a free App. and I can view my HD videos on this tablet and they really look great.
B008DWG5HE,1,8,even found some great apps to tutor my kids on it.i'm
B008DWG5HE,1,9,Unless you love downloading lots of apps and downloading movies or something.
B008DWG5HE,1,10,Kindle app works great and Amazon Prime movies work well in the browser.
B008DWG5HE,1,11,There are thousands of apps on the Google Play Store to choose from.
B008DWG5HE,1,12,I also find the Samsungs to be every bit as intuitive as the Ipad was.Apps: There are maybe 2 apps that the Itunes store has that I "need" in the Android app market, but all of the other apps that I already purchased for my Android phone were readily and easily available for download from the Google Apps store ("PLAY").
B008DWG5HE,1,13,really great for reading my books and comics.
B008DWG5HE,1,14,Has a 10.1" screen which makes it easy to see and watch videos or movie.
B008DWG5HE,1,15,I also didn't like how on ipad you can only line up the Apps in little rows.
B008DWG5HE,1,16,There also is not a Japanese option available for download unless I go to the Play Store.
B008DWG5HE,1,17,My favorite apps (that apple doesn't offer) are floating apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,18,Can watch Amazon Prime videos (after loading flash),8.
B008DWG5HE,1,19,I had a Hava streaming box for TV - the app on iPad wasn't working, but it's Android app worked perfect...
B008DWG5HE,1,20,Other apps can give you .psd
B008DWG5HE,1,21,One app in particular- ironically- the AMAZON mobile app- was not available for use on the Samsung Tablets.
B008DWG5HE,1,22,I would like to watch amazon prime videos like I do with my phone.
B008DWG5HE,1,23,It comes loaded with a lot of great features and programs like the Samsung App store and the Android Play store.
B008DWG5HE,1,24,The Note works great for all the other things (like music,web, video and books).
B008DWG5HE,2,0,The price almost made me have to buy it especially after seeing the 10.1 in BestBuy.
B008DWG5HE,2,1,A very good product.
B008DWG5HE,2,2,Good product.
B008DWG5HE,2,3,Same price as Brandsmart.
B008DWG5HE,2,4,This tablet is Honkin Good.
B008DWG5HE,2,5,Why would anyone buy an iPad?
B008DWG5HE,2,6,For that, I think the price is right on this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,2,7,Would recommend the purchase.
B008DWG5HE,2,8,I highly recommend this product to anyone.
B008DWG5HE,2,9,Worth the money.
B008DWG5HE,2,10,I am so happy with this purchase well worth the money.
B008DWG5HE,2,11,Could not get a better product !!!
B008DWG5HE,2,12,best buy.
B008DWG5HE,2,13,If you really want to have a product to use it as profesional then get this one is great !!
B008DWG5HE,2,14,Great Product.
B008DWG5HE,2,15,Best tablet you can buy.
B008DWG5HE,2,16,I hardly recommend.
B008DWG5HE,2,17,Definitely would recommend this to anyone and the price is great compared to an iPad.
B008DWG5HE,2,18,I review the ipad before decide for it.
B008DWG5HE,2,19,Great value for the money.
B008DWG5HE,2,20,But I was feeling good with my money so I decided to buy.
B008DWG5HE,2,21,I highly recommend it.
B008DWG5HE,2,22,Great Product.
B008DWG5HE,2,23,For the price and ease of use I would definately recommend the Samsung Note 10.1 over more highly priced tablets.
B008DWG5HE,2,24,I've wanted a tablet since the first ipad came out, but couldn't justify the price.
B008DWG5HE,3,0,It had ample battery life sufficient for my use.
B008DWG5HE,3,1,Battery life is short.2.
B008DWG5HE,3,2,Battery doesn't last long.
B008DWG5HE,3,3,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,3,4,Long battery life as it lastsall day.
B008DWG5HE,3,5,The battery life is really good too.
B008DWG5HE,3,6,Battery life is great.
B008DWG5HE,3,7,Battery life is great too.
B008DWG5HE,3,8,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,3,9,Battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,10,Battery life is about 7 hours...maybe a little more.The resolution of the screen is great.
B008DWG5HE,3,11,My only issue is that it takes a long time to take a full charge and does not charge rapidly enough to use while charging, but the battery life is not bad.
B008DWG5HE,3,12,Always seems like we are charging it.
B008DWG5HE,3,13,Battery charge.
B008DWG5HE,3,14,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,3,15,Longer battery life than the iPad or GTab.
B008DWG5HE,3,16,If you are playing a game the battery goes low way to quick.
B008DWG5HE,3,17,I usually have the brightness set to 10-15% or slightly less in classrooms or at home because that's all I really need but also to conserve battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,18,See how long the battery lasts.
B008DWG5HE,3,19,So the battery life is more than adequate.
B008DWG5HE,3,20,I have not timed the charging wait time, but itdoesn't seem to take long.
B008DWG5HE,3,21,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B008DWG5HE,3,22,Battery live lasts for almost two days without a charge.
B008DWG5HE,3,23,I probably have about 100 hours of use on it so far.
B008DWG5HE,3,24,Battery life is very good, it is easily an all day device with wifi on and high brightness while taking notes.
B008DWG5HE,4,0,This is as good as it gets.
B008DWG5HE,4,1,Yes it is plastic, but I like it, feels good, doesn't creak.
B008DWG5HE,4,2,Here is the good and the .. well it is all pretty good.1.
B008DWG5HE,4,3,Feels solid to me and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,4,4,Good sound, better than any tablet I herd.
B008DWG5HE,4,5,As far as quality of picture and sound, I can't really tell the difference.
B008DWG5HE,4,6,Excellent product, good quality.
B008DWG5HE,4,7,solid build.
B008DWG5HE,4,8,Good solid tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,9,The speakers are of great quality.
B008DWG5HE,4,10,It has great sound.
B008DWG5HE,4,11,it has pretty good battery life, it also has an excellent quality sounding speakers, which i wasn't expecting on any tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,12,I never expected it to be as good as it is.
B008DWG5HE,4,13,Not as good as the Ipad 3, but great.
B008DWG5HE,4,14,And the sound quality and volume were excellent.
B008DWG5HE,4,15,Loud and decent quality speakers, probably the best on any tablet I've experienced6.
B008DWG5HE,4,16,picture great sound!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,4,17,This synergy is shown in the design and quality of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,18,It is different from the iPad, but that's a good thing, I think.
B008DWG5HE,4,19,The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,4,20,Sound is great.
B008DWG5HE,4,21,So far, so good.
B008DWG5HE,4,22,It's very thin, very light, but also very solid feeling.
B008DWG5HE,4,23,The build quality seems fine to me.
B008DWG5HE,4,24,Nice to have speakers up front, but it would be nice if they were a little louder.4.
B008DWG5HE,5,0,Works great with good picture quality.
B008DWG5HE,5,1,very good.
B008DWG5HE,5,2,apps are easy to use and the camera front and rear are as good as other in it category.
B008DWG5HE,5,3,The picture and video quality are even better than expected.
B008DWG5HE,5,4,It has picture in picture video.
B008DWG5HE,5,5,Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great.
B008DWG5HE,5,6,Video isn't that great either, but this is a tablet we're talking about here, not a Canon/Nikon/Sony dSLR or video camera.
B008DWG5HE,5,7,I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet.
B008DWG5HE,5,8,Pictures and videos are stunning.
B008DWG5HE,5,9,And the picture quality is amazing.
B008DWG5HE,5,10,The rear-facing camera takes really decent images!6)
B008DWG5HE,5,11,It has a decent front camera for video chat, and the a decent rear camera with a flash, tablets are not cameras but this one is above average.10)
B008DWG5HE,5,12,Good Job.
B008DWG5HE,5,13,OK, let;s get it over with, the screen isn't as high resolution as the Apple, but it;s pretty good.
B008DWG5HE,5,14,I could go on and on about it but you get the picture.
B008DWG5HE,5,15,this is a great device.
B008DWG5HE,5,16,I find the screen easy to read.
B008DWG5HE,5,17,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,5,18,It seems required for any portable device to have a camera nowadays, and both front and back are there, but the photos aren't great.
B008DWG5HE,5,19,I do like working with photos and the note functions are good as well.
B008DWG5HE,5,20,The front and rear camera works very well and the Photoshop Touch app is an excellent complement.
B008DWG5HE,5,21,With Smart Stay, the front facing camera will look at you.
B008DWG5HE,5,22,It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something.
B008DWG5HE,5,23,Video playback is awesome, 720p is good enough for me on a 10 inch screen, colors look great and picture isn't blurry or jagged.
B008DWG5HE,5,24,Kies is great and works just as well with photos.
B008DWG5HE,6,0,Fast and responsive.
B008DWG5HE,6,1,Good size screen!
B008DWG5HE,6,2,It did not disappoint.Firstly, this tablet is fast, really fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,3,fast processor, clear and bright screen.
B008DWG5HE,6,4,Quad core is fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,5,Amazingly fast and responsive!
B008DWG5HE,6,6,Note: the iPad 3 is only 1GHz processor, and dual core, not quad.*
B008DWG5HE,6,7,The response of both the S-Pen and touch screen are great.
B008DWG5HE,6,8,Perfect power, great value for a quad core.
B008DWG5HE,6,9,Price.
B008DWG5HE,6,10,The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,6,11,Resolution looks great.
B008DWG5HE,6,12,quad core processor runs everything quickly and smoothly.
B008DWG5HE,6,13,Blazing fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,14,Speed is great and the screen is great, I take more productivity tools over high resolution screen tablet anyday.
B008DWG5HE,6,15,Fast processor and connections.
B008DWG5HE,6,16,If Samsung were to upgrade this thing they should put in one of those nice new octa-core processors and a nice AmoLED screen.
B008DWG5HE,6,17,Very nice.
B008DWG5HE,6,18,It is very fast and smooth.
B008DWG5HE,6,19,The screen is clear with great color.
B008DWG5HE,6,20,The note 10.1 is blazing fast thanks to its quad core 1.4 ghz exynos processor and its 2gb of ram, lag free and full of features.
B008DWG5HE,6,21,The screen is very responsive.
B008DWG5HE,6,22,screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,6,23,Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.
B008DWG5HE,6,24,Excellent battery, performance, stability, quality and also quantity.
B008DWG5HE,7,0,I wanted a SD card slot for additional storage.
B008DWG5HE,7,1,The storage capacity is excellent, 16GB, plus an extra 16GB SD card for the full 32GB of storage.
B008DWG5HE,7,2,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,3,Expandable Storage.*
B008DWG5HE,7,4,Ended up buying a 32GB mini SD card for the tablet which does give me 64 GB which helps.
B008DWG5HE,7,5,I don't recommend buying the 32gb version because this has a Micro SD slot for extra storage space up to 64gb.
B008DWG5HE,7,6,This is a great tablet and for only $11.00 I added 16 more GB via mini SD.
B008DWG5HE,7,7,You have the freedom to play with your storage the way you want by buying as many mini cards as you want.
B008DWG5HE,7,8,Love the SD card slot option and again... it's great having a dedicated stylus.
B008DWG5HE,7,9,Make sure to get a 32gig micro SD card, to expand the memory.
B008DWG5HE,7,10,With the app you can see your files and download them into the tablet from the card or drive.
B008DWG5HE,7,11,I chose this over the IPad because apps are not proprietary, you can add extra memory with a micro sd card that you can't do with the IPad and it was a good deal cheaper.
B008DWG5HE,7,12,With the exantion slot my note went from 32gb to 96gb.
B008DWG5HE,7,13,While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-
B008DWG5HE,7,14,I also love having the micro SD card option as then I don't worry about space.
B008DWG5HE,7,15,The amount of storage to me is great.
B008DWG5HE,7,16,I love the fact that I can extend memory with an sd card.
B008DWG5HE,7,17,Did I mention it has an option for an external SD card to go along with the 32GB that it already has?
B008DWG5HE,7,18,you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory?
B008DWG5HE,7,19,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,20,The only disadvantage of this type is its memory; namely it should be 16 GB but practically it is less than even 12 GB.
B008DWG5HE,7,21,Thank you so much for adding the card slot, Samsung!The audio quality is very good.
B008DWG5HE,7,22,Seems quite sturdy and mine doesnt creak in my hands.I got the 16gb version as it was readily available, and i added a 64gb card to the slot, for less than the $50 extra for the 32g model.
B008DWG5HE,7,23,At 32 gigs I have plenty of space for books, music, and movies---which I might add look great on the HD screen.
B008DWG5HE,7,24,Also, with their mini-sd drive (I bought the SD 64 gb card) you can put music on there if you didn't want to use Kies.
B008DWG5HE,8,0,Not as good as the Ipad 3, but great.
B008DWG5HE,8,1,This device has replaced my laptop as my main computing device.
B008DWG5HE,8,2,A new way of doing computing.
B008DWG5HE,8,3,I can play a youtube or any other type of video and have float around the screen while I surf the web or check e-mail.
B008DWG5HE,8,4,The Note works great for all the other things (like music,web, video and books).
B008DWG5HE,8,5,I use my computers mostly for email and web searching and shopping.
B008DWG5HE,8,6,I find my self using iPad for Web only, even before I bought the Note 10.1.-
B008DWG5HE,8,7,I use this device to check Facebook, my e-mail, and do online searches.
B008DWG5HE,8,8,If you're a student wanting more from a tablet than surfing the internet and playing games, THIS is the tablet for you!
B008DWG5HE,8,9,I read ebook, surf web, and watch videos.
B008DWG5HE,8,10,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,8,11,This tablet is the best one I have owned so far... iPad, Nexus 7... they may be good but this thing does so much more.
B008DWG5HE,8,12,Wifi signal is as strong as our laptop around the house.
B008DWG5HE,8,13,A lot more?- iPad does indeed look nice, I give it that.
B008DWG5HE,8,14,I bought it to keep my books and to be able to check email easily while I travel.
B008DWG5HE,8,15,it syncs up all of my computer phone and tablet information and makes it really easy to work
B008DWG5HE,8,16,iPad 2 screen looks the same to me as Note 10.1.Galaxy
B008DWG5HE,8,17,Fluid in everything that you do (browsing, web video).
B008DWG5HE,8,18,I use it as a book reader, to watch videos while I workout at the gym, to check email and facebook, to check the weather.
B008DWG5HE,8,19,The browser capabilities are very similar to my laptop and I find myself on my wifes Note more than the Ipad (which I we only use for games).I would strongly recommend the Note to anyone looking to get a great tablet that is used to non-Apple mobile and standard computing, i.e.
B008DWG5HE,8,20,Great with any game I play and it's an excellent e-book reader.
B008DWG5HE,8,21,Note 10.1 does not look as nice as iPad.
B008DWG5HE,8,22,It's basically replaced my laptop.
B008DWG5HE,8,23,Performance is excellent and the wi-fi connects instantaneously with quite a large distance from the transmitter.
B008DWG5HE,8,24,Love the large screen and the web experience.
B008DWG5HE,9,0,And well, after trying several apps, I must say that best for writing are: Quill, Write and Papyrus.
B008DWG5HE,9,1,You can write as though you were using a pen and paper.
B008DWG5HE,9,2,You can write and draw on this tablet asefficiently as you do on paper.
B008DWG5HE,9,3,I screengrab my calculator app to capture graphs and get those into my notes.
B008DWG5HE,9,4,I use it more for reading, but I love the pen and being able to write instead of type.
B008DWG5HE,9,5,The S Pen is so accurate that you can hand write whole sheets of handwritten text with it.
B008DWG5HE,9,6,If you want to get this tablet for anything except the pen, don't do it and go for other tablets with better resolution/price/etc.
B008DWG5HE,9,7,The S note app allows you to take notes or even write math equations.
B008DWG5HE,9,8,If You Want to Write with a Stylus This is the Tablet to Buy.
B008DWG5HE,9,9,I don't like software keyboards so I love being able to write everything out.
B008DWG5HE,9,10,I've seen other top-of-the-line tablets used with an after-market stylus where you write really big in 1/2 the screen and what you write is digitized down (sometimes unreadable) into your "notes" in the other half of the screen.Not so with the Samsung Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,9,11,The S-Pen feels like a real pen when you are writing not like those gummy bear stylus tips that the other tablets use to write with.
B008DWG5HE,9,12,I'm a writer and it's so much easier writing than typing!
B008DWG5HE,9,13,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,9,14,You can write math equations into the note app and it'll solve them, same with chemistry symbols, and the pen feature works really well.
B008DWG5HE,9,15,Love all the apps it's got.
B008DWG5HE,9,16,The Note software with the S pen make handwriting a pleasure.
B008DWG5HE,9,17,I also didn't like how on ipad you can only line up the Apps in little rows.
B008DWG5HE,9,18,The conversion from Windows XP to touch screen and stylus was much easier than I had envisioned.
B008DWG5HE,9,19,(Write and Papyrus are free apps).However, for ipad , there are better apps for drawing in general.
B008DWG5HE,9,20,Some drawing apps to recommend is Layerpaint and tvpaint.
B008DWG5HE,9,21,You can do much more things than with an ipad.
B008DWG5HE,9,22,The handwriting app is good.
B008DWG5HE,9,23,Plus you could get a keyboard and use this to make a word document!
B008DWG5HE,9,24,I can't read my own writing, but it can.
B008DWG5HE,10,0,Love it!
B008DWG5HE,10,1,Love it.!
B008DWG5HE,10,2,Love, love, love this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,3,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,4,love it.
B008DWG5HE,10,5,love it.
B008DWG5HE,10,6,This is Great.
B008DWG5HE,10,7,Great Tablet!
B008DWG5HE,10,8,Love, love, love this tablet!
B008DWG5HE,10,9,I love it!
B008DWG5HE,10,10,Love it!!
B008DWG5HE,10,11,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,12,LOVE IT.
B008DWG5HE,10,13,Love this tablet!
B008DWG5HE,10,14,love, love, love this!
B008DWG5HE,10,15,I love this product.
B008DWG5HE,10,16,I love this product...
B008DWG5HE,10,17,I love my Note!
B008DWG5HE,10,18,love it!
B008DWG5HE,10,19,LOVE IT!! Love this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,20,Just got it and loving it!!!!
B008DWG5HE,10,21,Love my tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,22,I love this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,23,Love it love it love it.Only had it for a day but its great.i
B008DWG5HE,10,24,I love my tablet.
B008DWG5HE,11,0,I purchased a portable folding Bluetooth keyboard that works great and I added a Bluetooth mouse.
B008DWG5HE,11,1,Very nice tablet.
B008DWG5HE,11,2,Very nice Tablet.
B008DWG5HE,11,3,Nice Unit.
B008DWG5HE,11,4,Would of preferred a full size hdmi over the micro.
B008DWG5HE,11,5,The only thing that I don't like about it is that there is no usb port.
B008DWG5HE,11,6,I bought an SD Card reader for $8 and hdmi adapter for $34 - hooked up a bluetooth mouse and keyboard and I can use my TV like a smart TV now.
B008DWG5HE,11,7,I like that some of the cases offer folding options to function as a stand for your tablet, so I think a case is a good addition if you can find one you like.
B008DWG5HE,11,8,I also purchased a wireless keyboard for it and it works well with it.
B008DWG5HE,11,9,Evernote works nicely on the big screen.9.
B008DWG5HE,11,10,Love that the stylus is built into the case.
B008DWG5HE,11,11,I love the cardboard thin Bluetooth keyboard that connects magnetically.
B008DWG5HE,11,12,Other than that the keyboard, mouse, and traveling case were great, works without flaws.
B008DWG5HE,11,13,I also like that I can connect it to my computer's USB port and use it as an external hard drive.
B008DWG5HE,11,14,When I plug in a USB external hard drive to the tablet, the tablet tells me that the USB device requires too much power to operate (stick with the thumb drives, or AC adapter powered external HDDs).
B008DWG5HE,11,15,You can transfer files but the power output from standard USB ports is not strong enough to power the Note.
B008DWG5HE,11,16,Purchased a keyboard and it is now ideal.
B008DWG5HE,11,17,I also recommend that you buy an additional power supply so that you can have a spare is case you misplace or damage the one it comes with also you will need an attachment for reading an external USB device.
B008DWG5HE,11,18,isn't a solid-quality keyboard case yet.
B008DWG5HE,11,19,I purchased a nice portfolio case for mine that opens up and fold back.
B008DWG5HE,11,20,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,11,21,It also supports Bluetooth.I was very impressed with the battery life.
B008DWG5HE,11,22,You can work with any bluetooth keyboard as I understand it, though I've not done so yet.
B008DWG5HE,11,23,With the stylus and my logitech wireless keyboard, I no longer take my laptop with me between home and the office.
B008DWG5HE,11,24,Battery life is great too.
B008DWG5HE,12,0,Great Product if you want an Android Operating System.
B008DWG5HE,12,1,Nice Android.
B008DWG5HE,12,2,As Androids to, this is the best one.
B008DWG5HE,12,3,Best android Tablet I've owned.
B008DWG5HE,12,4,The best device I've ever seen.
B008DWG5HE,12,5,The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1  is the best yet.
B008DWG5HE,12,6,Since that has a windows 8 operating system and its not Android.
B008DWG5HE,12,7,She LOVES the Android system, and the Galaxy Note 10.1 platform!
B008DWG5HE,12,8,I am a diehard android fan.
B008DWG5HE,12,9,I am new to Android products, but there is no reason to go back to Apple.And it does all the other things tablets/iPads do.
B008DWG5HE,12,10,Otherwise it's an excellent Android device.
B008DWG5HE,12,11,It helped being a Samsung Galaxy III user since this tablet operates very similarly.
B008DWG5HE,12,12,I was done with android products.
B008DWG5HE,12,13,If you are an Android fan this is a great Tab.
B008DWG5HE,12,14,No Flashplayer operation.....I wanted this instead of the Apple iPad...now its just like the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,12,15,It is very easy to use.
B008DWG5HE,12,16,Tramples the Ipad (and I own both) I'm a fan of apple, and a fan of android.
B008DWG5HE,12,17,Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,12,18,I love it firstly for Android operating system and lots of existing apps.
B008DWG5HE,12,19,It's fast as lightingThe s pen is great.
B008DWG5HE,12,20,Samsung Galaxy Note.. Hooray!!
B008DWG5HE,12,21,So far I am very happy with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10
B008DWG5HE,12,22,I am quite anxious though to see this S pen at work and all the nifty features with the Samsung Galaxy Note.
B008DWG5HE,12,23,Having stable Android system is just an amazing.Winner: Galaxy Note 10.12.
B008DWG5HE,12,24,The screen is good, but with sunlight is hard to see. 2. There are not  exclusives apps for android tablets, like apple have for the Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,13,0,I did not want to get an Ipad because I am not used to using Apple products.
B008DWG5HE,13,1,To me Apple is a niche product.
B008DWG5HE,13,2,Great Product!
B008DWG5HE,13,3,Fast shipping and Good product.
B008DWG5HE,13,4,If you are looking for a tablet for work and productivity, this is the one.
B008DWG5HE,13,5,I purchased this tablet to replace a IPAD.
B008DWG5HE,13,6,Way to go Amazon.
B008DWG5HE,13,7,I came home and ordered it that day!
B008DWG5HE,13,8,Product is fine and I love Samsung products but seller gets 3 stars for product seal broken.
B008DWG5HE,13,9,I gave a few days for myself before put a purchase order.
B008DWG5HE,13,10,This has to the best product I bought for 2012!!!
B008DWG5HE,13,11,I tell everyone to buy this!
B008DWG5HE,13,12,NOT HAPPY!!!! Got a defective product!
B008DWG5HE,13,13,Product is as described by seller.
B008DWG5HE,13,14,contacted and was told that its new and not refurbished item.
B008DWG5HE,13,15,Excellent product, good quality.
B008DWG5HE,13,16,This was my first time shopping with amazon and im really impressed, timely delivery and good customer service.
B008DWG5HE,13,17,As far as the product goes I am very pleased with it, and prefer this tablet over an Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,13,18,I've had experiences with Ipads and other tablets in the past but never purchased one because they have little to no value for productivity.
B008DWG5HE,13,19,Came sealed and in the box.
B008DWG5HE,13,20,I purchased this Note as 'like new' version from the Amazon warehouse.
B008DWG5HE,13,21,Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs.
B008DWG5HE,13,22,Brand new with no problems at all!
B008DWG5HE,13,23,I could not imagine one day i buy something not apple, but when i saw this tablet i believed the same thing!
B008DWG5HE,13,24,I was hoping to purchase the tablet from Amazon but Costco was offering an unbeatable deal.
B008DWG5HE,14,0,Can resize app windows and relocate.5.
B008DWG5HE,14,1,I love the multi window capability.
B008DWG5HE,14,2,Great Android tablet still learning the ins and outs.
B008DWG5HE,14,3,Here is the good and the .. well it is all pretty good.1.
B008DWG5HE,14,4,I do wish I could use Microsoft Office on it.
B008DWG5HE,14,5,Evernote works nicely on the big screen.9.
B008DWG5HE,14,6,was okay but still it could not do many things that I wanted to do.When I was about to purchase Surface Pro, one of my colleagues strongly recommended Note 10.1.He raised several issues with Surface Pro that made me try Note 10.1.1.
B008DWG5HE,14,7,The touchpen is awesome, and being able to have several windows open at the same time is the best - every tablet should have this.
B008DWG5HE,14,8,Love it!
B008DWG5HE,14,9,S Planner, S Note, a plethora of other apps that come with make the tablet experience full.
B008DWG5HE,14,10,Very clear screen for most purposes and I love the s pen.
B008DWG5HE,14,11,I find the keyboard designs on the Note 10.1 to be much better than the iPad and Windows 8 tablets.*
B008DWG5HE,14,12,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,13,It functions great with ezpdf and evernote and skitch and sketchbook pro .And now you know
B008DWG5HE,14,14,Also, I'm not certain if it's the app I'm using (LectureNotes--very good) or the device, but occasionally the accuracy of the pen can be quirky.
B008DWG5HE,14,15,I have owned 8 Android Tablets and one Windows tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,16,The dual window function is the best.
B008DWG5HE,14,17,Overall, it's pretty decent for drawing, but the apps are a bit limited.
B008DWG5HE,14,18,An all around nice tablet, with some minor uh-ohs!
B008DWG5HE,14,19,Excellent Tablet and Perfect for Students.
B008DWG5HE,14,20,Awesome device, only 1 con.
B008DWG5HE,14,21,The S-Pen works using magnetic inductance, and therefore, magnets that are within 1 or 2 centimeters of the screen can affect the proper functioning of the S-Pen.
B008DWG5HE,14,22,I love different things about all of these and believe they all have a place.
B008DWG5HE,14,23,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,14,24,Because I have an Android OS mobile phone, it would only make sense to keep streamlined with an Android OS tablet.
B008DWG5HE,15,0,The screen is very bright and clear.
B008DWG5HE,15,1,screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,2,The screen is clear with great color.
B008DWG5HE,15,3,The screen is bright and the colors are vibrant.
B008DWG5HE,15,4,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B008DWG5HE,15,5,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,15,6,thing to note about the screen.
B008DWG5HE,15,7,The only thing that i would have wished more is a higher screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,8,The screen resolution has not been a problem.
B008DWG5HE,15,9,With the screen facing away from the sun, however, reflections of myself and the scenery behind me dominate the screen and make it difficult to read the text.
B008DWG5HE,15,10,The display is so clear.
B008DWG5HE,15,11,The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,15,12,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,15,13,It is punchy with good blacks and looks plenty sharp at the normal viewing distance of a 10" screen.
B008DWG5HE,15,14,It is bright and colors are vibrant.
B008DWG5HE,15,15,One complaint is that the screen is VERY bright and I've not found a way to dim it.
B008DWG5HE,15,16,I actually found out that it will not only run split screens plus 5 apps like I mentioned but up to 11.The screen resolution is NOT an issue at all.
B008DWG5HE,15,17,The touch screen is great.-the
B008DWG5HE,15,18,The screen is bright and refreshingly HD quality viewing.
B008DWG5HE,15,19,I have read other reviews of people complaining about the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,20,Yes, the iPad has a screen that is a bit more vibrant, but unless they are sitting side by side you will NOT notice the difference.
B008DWG5HE,15,21,Yes the Ipad 4 and Infinity both have high resolution screens, but having those screens doesn't make up for the abilities that the Note 10.1 has.
B008DWG5HE,15,22,Besides maybe a super cool high resolution screen there's really nothing other tablets can do that this one cannot.
B008DWG5HE,15,23,The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.
B008DWG5HE,15,24,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B008DWG5HE,16,0,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,16,1,The problem with all tablets is app support.
B008DWG5HE,16,2,One for their store and one for their apps.
B008DWG5HE,16,3,Lots of apps already installed.
B008DWG5HE,16,4,October 19On the FLASH PLAYER:There are several ways to get around not having flash player.
B008DWG5HE,16,5,no flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,6,You will need how to install apps and visit the app store.
B008DWG5HE,16,7,Therefore, this tablet will not run Flash video.
B008DWG5HE,16,8,Did not work from google store.
B008DWG5HE,16,9,No Adobe flash!
B008DWG5HE,16,10,I was able to install Adobe Flash and now web pages that use Flash works.-
B008DWG5HE,16,11,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,16,12,Great tablet but it does not support flash!
B008DWG5HE,16,13,This is a problem right?.... Nope! Download the app camscanner (its free!!)
B008DWG5HE,16,14,Flash not supported.
B008DWG5HE,16,15,There's a great selection of apps optimized for tablets from Google Play, Amazon App Store, and Samsung Apps.
B008DWG5HE,16,16,To my dismay Adobe (the company who makes Flash video software) stopped supporting Flash for android.
B008DWG5HE,16,17,One of the problems- Every time I clicked on any link/button to install flash, the device would take me to the play store and tell me flash wasn't available.I eventually found an application that requires flash, downloaded it, and let it install flash automatically, thus bypassing all automatic links to the google play store.However, once flash player is installed, it still doesn't work as well as a PC with the sites I frequent (rosetta stone, amazon).
B008DWG5HE,16,18,All the time is spent making good apps for the ibad.
B008DWG5HE,16,19,Going to the app store and loading new apps is totally painless since I never have to login to the store.
B008DWG5HE,16,20,Someone needs to develop an app like Photon the one for Ipad for androids.
B008DWG5HE,16,21,has their own app market and they pre-install some apps on your tablet.
B008DWG5HE,16,22,It's got PhotoShop preinstalled.The flash player has to be downloaded manually by going to app store and search for adobe flash player installer.
B008DWG5HE,16,23,There are thousands of apps on the Google Play Store to choose from.
B008DWG5HE,16,24,So no websites which use Java can work....and I believe this is on all Android devices.
B008DWG5HE,17,0,Bought this as a Christmas present.
B008DWG5HE,17,1,Great gift.
B008DWG5HE,17,2,I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.
B008DWG5HE,17,3,would not have bought knowing this.
B008DWG5HE,17,4,I shoulda bought one sooner.
B008DWG5HE,17,5,Christmas Present for the Wife.
B008DWG5HE,17,6,I should have bought an Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,17,7,I received this tablet as a gift (not purchased through Amazon.com)
B008DWG5HE,17,8,I bought my note 10.1 about 2 weeks ago and since then I have been using it all the time.
B008DWG5HE,17,9,I've refrained from buying a tablet for several years now.
B008DWG5HE,17,10,love it!!! GREAT, so much better than an IPad.
B008DWG5HE,17,11,Have not had any problems, purchased one for me and another for my wife.
B008DWG5HE,17,12,So, for my 2012 birthday, my husband "gave" me a tablet.First, I bought the new Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,17,13,I received this thing two days ago and have not hardly put it down.Did I tell you thatb I love it.
B008DWG5HE,17,14,Great value for the money.
B008DWG5HE,17,15,I have purchased so many things through amazon over the last 7 or so years but this is my first review.
B008DWG5HE,17,16,Then the 10.1 Note came out and not only did I buy this I also bought my wife the tab 2 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,17,17,After months of research and comparisons... Bought it and haven't regretted it!!It has exceeded my expectations...
B008DWG5HE,17,18,Tablet was all I expected and more.
B008DWG5HE,17,19,Insurance bought me another.
B008DWG5HE,17,20,I bought the original 10.1 and loved that.
B008DWG5HE,17,21,Great buy.
B008DWG5HE,17,22,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,17,23,I bought the Note after reading the many reviews here.
B008DWG5HE,17,24,Love it love it love it.Only had it for a day but its great.i
B008DWG5HE,18,0,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,18,1,I let the battery die out, plugged in the charger, allowed it to fully charge before I turned it on again and then it unfroze.
B008DWG5HE,18,2,turn it on and go.
B008DWG5HE,18,3,If you don't use it very much I have gone 5 days on one charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,4,The unit came charged thankfully.
B008DWG5HE,18,5,My only issue is that it takes a long time to take a full charge and does not charge rapidly enough to use while charging, but the battery life is not bad.
B008DWG5HE,18,6,I STILL haven't got the opportunity to use it off a full 100% charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,7,The first day it died, the next day after updates on the second  day wifi issues.
B008DWG5HE,18,8,It doesn't stop even long enough for me to hold down the power key and turn the device off completely.I have researched everything, and can not find anything on why it is doing this, or how to fix it!
B008DWG5HE,18,9,We may need charging every 3 days or so.The unit is blazing fast.
B008DWG5HE,18,10,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,18,11,It is powerful.
B008DWG5HE,18,12,Even with continuous use, I only have to plug my tablet in to charge overnight.
B008DWG5HE,18,13,When I try to charge it from a source that doesn't provide enough power (it needs 5v 2A), the tablet tells me that it is receiving inadequate power.
B008DWG5HE,18,14,When in standby after you hit the power button the tablet comes on in a second .
B008DWG5HE,18,15,I probably use it every night and after about 6 months, I haven't had one problem.
B008DWG5HE,18,16,I can't get enough play time with it!!
B008DWG5HE,18,17,Fixed them all up in less than 2 hours.
B008DWG5HE,18,18,Wanted it to read with, but it's turned into so much more.
B008DWG5HE,18,19,Used new cable and old charger and it charged, used old cable and new charger and NO CHARGE.
B008DWG5HE,18,20,I have not timed the charging wait time, but itdoesn't seem to take long.
B008DWG5HE,18,21,The charging cable that comes with the unit is very short and does not let you charge the unit while using it unless you sit next to the wall outlet.
B008DWG5HE,18,22,I use this thing off and on all day long and it remains in standby all day long.
B008DWG5HE,18,23,*SMALL UPDATE*So for the past few days I've noticed my tablet hasn't been charging correctly.
B008DWG5HE,18,24,I returned it in 1 month, it had similar problems.
B008DWG5HE,19,0,especially fond of the speakers.
B008DWG5HE,19,1,speakers can get loud which isn't bad but when you turn the tablet from widescreen to tall screen (as I call it) I just think the tablet looks a bit weird especially since the speakers will be top and bottom and slightly to the right or left.
B008DWG5HE,19,2,Videos are full screen with front-facing stereo speakers.
B008DWG5HE,19,3,3.5mm headphone jack is on the top of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,19,4,I sometimes remedy this with headphones or cupping my hands over the speakers to feed the sound towards the front.
B008DWG5HE,19,5,I am not expert on sound system, so all I cared was whether I can hear sound loud enough.
B008DWG5HE,19,6,The side front facing speakers get loud.
B008DWG5HE,19,7,Even then, the sound from the speakers appears to be detached and low-fi.
B008DWG5HE,19,8,The sound is loud enough and I don't hear any popping or weird echoey noises.
B008DWG5HE,19,9,I find myself having to use headphones when watching videos.
B008DWG5HE,19,10,However, I keep mine in the Samsung case (sold separately), so the build deficits aren't noticeable.Speakers:Placing stereo speakers at opposite edges of the screen facing forward is a great idea, except the speakers aren't loud enough and have a tinny sound.
B008DWG5HE,19,11,Our 4-year-old watches videos on this and, with the case we have, it's not possible to stand the tablet up for watching while it's plugged in.
B008DWG5HE,19,12,The audio became occasionally inoperative and the headphone jack would crackle when using my ear buds.
B008DWG5HE,19,13,I sometimes plug in some computer speakers and listen to music at work through it.
B008DWG5HE,19,14,I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.Bad things (I think)-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful.
B008DWG5HE,19,15,It's only about 2 feet long.The front of the tablet has two speakers, so no having to lay it down to hear sounds.
B008DWG5HE,19,16,good for  watching movies and listening to music.i'm
B008DWG5HE,19,17,With the Xoom, watching a video requires the volume to be turned up quite loud.
B008DWG5HE,19,18,I can get click sound by pressing corner, sticking button (first one was volume, second one was power).
B008DWG5HE,19,19,It's so easy to watch videos and movies and shows on it in landscape with those speakers when you're with company.
B008DWG5HE,19,20,I can now hear creaking when I move the device around a bit or pick it up from this side, but it isn't anything I'm concerned about.
B008DWG5HE,19,21,thing to note about the screen.
B008DWG5HE,19,22,The screen resolution has not been a problem.
B008DWG5HE,19,23,I didn't really find the plastic backing cheap looking like others have mentioned but that's just my opinion.
B008DWG5HE,19,24,When you are at the home screens, there is like a literal inch on both the left and right sides of the screen where you cannot place apps or anything.
B008DWG5HE,20,0,I wanted front and back cameras.
B008DWG5HE,20,1,It has a decent front camera for video chat, and the a decent rear camera with a flash, tablets are not cameras but this one is above average.10)
B008DWG5HE,20,2,Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great.
B008DWG5HE,20,3,I then realized this happens mostly for apps that use the front facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,4,It has picture in picture video.
B008DWG5HE,20,5,You wont ge disappointed
B008DWG5HE,20,6,The camera is very, very mediocre.
B008DWG5HE,20,7,It has front facing speakers like all tablets should have.16)
B008DWG5HE,20,8,But if you are working with it alone you will see that it is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.The camera is by far one of the weakest things in the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,9,Both the front 1.9MP camera and 5MP camera fully live up to their specs.
B008DWG5HE,20,10,I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet.
B008DWG5HE,20,11,NEVER had a laptop that lasted more than 3 hours of heavy useIt also includes Blue Tooth, GPS, in addition to the front facing camera it also sports a 5MP rear facing auto focus camera with a FLASH (sorry Ipad).Audio recording blew me away.
B008DWG5HE,20,12,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,13,I personally would never use a tablet to take pictures, but if i did, i would be very disappointed.
B008DWG5HE,20,14,I don't know if other tablets have the remote feature, but if they don't, this feature alone is worth getting the galaxy for.The back camera is 5MP, has a flash, and can auto focus.
B008DWG5HE,20,15,* Cameras - Amazon removed the images I posted for some reason so just take my word that the cameras work well.
B008DWG5HE,20,16,It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something.
B008DWG5HE,20,17,The first thing that stuck out to me were the speakers being in the front, rather than the rear.
B008DWG5HE,20,18,I guess it make sense for these apps to not allow you to use the Note upside down, otherwise your camera output to apps such as Skype would result in your face showing upside down to the person you would be chatting with at the time.
B008DWG5HE,20,19,The screen was not very sensitive (compared to iPad and Asus brands), it was laggy, crashed several times, and the camera was laughable at best with no auto focus.
B008DWG5HE,20,20,great¡ This tablet has lived up to all my expectations.
B008DWG5HE,20,21,Video isn't that great either, but this is a tablet we're talking about here, not a Canon/Nikon/Sony dSLR or video camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,22,I mainly use the rear camera with the CamScanner HD application and the front one for Skype.On the negative side, I must mention the proprietary USB/Charging connector.
B008DWG5HE,20,23,Cameras are not the best you will see out there but both work nice.
B008DWG5HE,20,24,Skype I use mainly to call overseas and to have my mom do video chatting with her grandkids up in Ohio.
B008DWG5HE,21,0,It was slow, it lagged.
B008DWG5HE,21,1,I did a hard set twice and it came back as fast as new but it would slow again as I added Apps back in.
B008DWG5HE,21,2,It is fast and loaded with apps and features I need.
B008DWG5HE,21,3,(Except as a babysitter-no wait, there are apps for that).
B008DWG5HE,21,4,The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time.
B008DWG5HE,21,5,Quad core is fast.
B008DWG5HE,21,6,Web pages loading time is fast but not nearly as fast as my laptop.
B008DWG5HE,21,7,The OS was fast at first but as I added Apps it got slower and choppy.
B008DWG5HE,21,8,Samsung's time has come.
B008DWG5HE,21,9,No Hiccups.-The 2 Gb of RAM lets you multitask very well and you will never feel like the tablet is slowing down.-Samsung
B008DWG5HE,21,10,It does seem to be kind of slow at times and it can lock up easily.
B008DWG5HE,21,11,their is no lag what so ever it long lasting no problems what so ever.
B008DWG5HE,21,12,I opened everything I could open to test it and it still ran fast (that ran obviously a little slower than usually but still everything was so fast it surprised me I expected it to crash).
B008DWG5HE,21,13,I screengrab my calculator app to capture graphs and get those into my notes.
B008DWG5HE,21,14,There was a noticeable improvement in responsiveness and speed.
B008DWG5HE,21,15,Let me start by saying I had low expectations for the S Note app.
B008DWG5HE,21,16,That said, the way android performs on this tablet, it's quite capable without x86!
B008DWG5HE,21,17,I was set to keep the tablet but it started to have performance issues.
B008DWG5HE,21,18,At the time the stuff was...well....cheap looking.
B008DWG5HE,21,19,you could do it, but for having a quad-core processor, the keyboard doesn't respond very quickly and i have had lots of accuracy issues with it.
B008DWG5HE,21,20,love it!!! GREAT, so much better than an IPad.
B008DWG5HE,21,21,I expected a half-assed branded app, put out to brag about as a feature.
B008DWG5HE,21,22,There are now 18 multitasking apps and lots of other things you will be supprised at.
B008DWG5HE,21,23,I used the multi screen for up to 4 things and it still ran fast.
B008DWG5HE,21,24,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,22,0,Make sure to get a 32gig micro SD card, to expand the memory.
B008DWG5HE,22,1,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,2,I purchased a 32GB micro SD card to increase storage space for my videos.
B008DWG5HE,22,3,Also, with their mini-sd drive (I bought the SD 64 gb card) you can put music on there if you didn't want to use Kies.
B008DWG5HE,22,4,While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-
B008DWG5HE,22,5,you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory?
B008DWG5HE,22,6,Another great feature is that even though this device comes with 32 GB internal memory, I can insert a 64 GB card.
B008DWG5HE,22,7,There is an expansion slot (up to 32GB only) and I popped in the Sandisk 32GB card.
B008DWG5HE,22,8,It accessed the SD card witout any issues.
B008DWG5HE,22,9,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,10,I can increase my storage with Micro SD cards or use them to access media I don't want to load onto the Note.
B008DWG5HE,22,11,I wanted a SD card slot for additional storage.
B008DWG5HE,22,12,With the app you can see your files and download them into the tablet from the card or drive.
B008DWG5HE,22,13,I highly recommend that you buy the Sandisk 32gb Micro Ultra memory card.
B008DWG5HE,22,14,I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.
B008DWG5HE,22,15,Took a long time researching tablet options...I was looking for more than 16gb and ability to use expanded memory via sd cards.
B008DWG5HE,22,16,Micro SD support7.
B008DWG5HE,22,17,You CAN use a 64gb card in it (I have the 32gb Galaxy Note 10.1), so I can store twice as many movies and music.
B008DWG5HE,22,18,My only complaint is that you can not transfer apps to the SD card, but I am hoping Samsung will fix this in the next update.
B008DWG5HE,22,19,If there are some files on my computer I need on my tablet I get my mini sd card to transfer the files and upload them on my tablet.
B008DWG5HE,22,20,You cannot use Apps2SD, for example, to move apps from the Note's built-in memory to an external SD card without *rooting the device.
B008DWG5HE,22,21,Thanks Samsung, you guys made a great tablet with a great idea!I bought 32 gb one, and I am about to use it with my 32 gb SD memory card too.
B008DWG5HE,22,22,All the free android apps and I was able to install Flash Player!!!!! Its wonderful to be able to have an SD card as well.
B008DWG5HE,22,23,It comes with 16 Gb of native storage, but Can be expanded by 64GB with a micro Sd card.One thing that I love about Android devices is you're not stuck with one music or movie player.
B008DWG5HE,22,24,I did purchased an additional 64 sd card for it and it stores so much more now.I strongly recommend the additional 64 Gig memory module, unless your going to get the ATIV which is a whole different concept.
B008DWG5HE,23,0,No problems connecting to any bt devices so far.
B008DWG5HE,23,1,Connect to the wireless router.
B008DWG5HE,23,2,This tablet wastes no time in connecting to any available wireless network and does whatever is asked of it.
B008DWG5HE,23,3,I also connect to multiple WiFi networks at work and other locations and never have an issue trying to connect.-
B008DWG5HE,23,4,It connects easily and works just like it should.
B008DWG5HE,23,5,Has some issues.
B008DWG5HE,23,6,They are all set up on our wireless network.
B008DWG5HE,23,7,Connects to the internet almost instantly!
B008DWG5HE,23,8,Perfect for these WiFi devices.
B008DWG5HE,23,9,It connects quickly and hasn't had any issues.
B008DWG5HE,23,10,I use to have an IPAD with 3G and found it more expensive than using the WiFi with a hotspot device.
B008DWG5HE,23,11,On top of that I can just use it to connect to the internet, etc.
B008DWG5HE,23,12,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,23,13,It connects to any Wi-Fi network almost immediately and the GPS works even inside closed buildings.
B008DWG5HE,23,14,Wi-fi is incredibly strong in areas of my home where other devices have weak signals.
B008DWG5HE,23,15,It stays connected well to my wi-fi, which is never more than 50 feet away in any room I choose to be in at home.
B008DWG5HE,23,16,I access the internet via wifi and it has worked flawlessly.
B008DWG5HE,23,17,Out of those tablets I've used in the past, the iPad came close to being my main device to manage an infrastructure when I'm away but still wasn't a true "multi-tasking" device.And then I saw this device and heard and seen the capabilities and I can see myself connected to my email and having my browser up and running on the other end and managing my servers through the browser.
B008DWG5HE,23,18,Performance is excellent and the wi-fi connects instantaneously with quite a large distance from the transmitter.
B008DWG5HE,23,19,The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router.
B008DWG5HE,23,20,The first day it died, the next day after updates on the second  day wifi issues.
B008DWG5HE,23,21,So I gave up using the Chrome browser, and not a problem one since then.
B008DWG5HE,23,22,I have not timed the charging wait time, but itdoesn't seem to take long.
B008DWG5HE,23,23,Problem:  Ipad  or  Samsung Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,23,24,* Wifi - No complaints.
B008DWG5HE,24,0,The touch screen is great.-the
B008DWG5HE,24,1,screen keyboard is customizable.
B008DWG5HE,24,2,We can't do anything on it, we can't even get to the home screen without it going nuts.
B008DWG5HE,24,3,It touch screen system is perfact.
B008DWG5HE,24,4,The touch screen is extremely sensitive and it takes only the slightest of touch to registeryour input.
B008DWG5HE,24,5,Fingerprints do show on the screen but no problem.
B008DWG5HE,24,6,I feel like that is space that can be used for placing more icons or something but when you touch the empty space the home screen will go the next screen over.
B008DWG5HE,24,7,thing to note about the screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,8,I often have to press screen buttons multiple times to get it to register.-
B008DWG5HE,24,9,Someone would think that a 10 inch wide screen is hard to type on.
B008DWG5HE,24,10,There are times when you press a button or select something with the pen and it does not register, and you have to press a second time.-
B008DWG5HE,24,11,The touch keyboard works pretty well.
B008DWG5HE,24,12,The screen is very sensitive.
B008DWG5HE,24,13,It will recognize when you are looking at the screen or when you are not looking at it.
B008DWG5HE,24,14,My First Pad.
B008DWG5HE,24,15,I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.Bad things (I think)-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful.
B008DWG5HE,24,16,When you are at the home screens, there is like a literal inch on both the left and right sides of the screen where you cannot place apps or anything.
B008DWG5HE,24,17,The touchscreen keyboard goes nuts with ghost typing; it opens and closes programs, goes from one page to the other, and has acutally changed settings as well.
B008DWG5HE,24,18,The response of both the S-Pen and touch screen are great.
B008DWG5HE,24,19,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,20,screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,24,21,If you are looking at the screen the device will remain on and you don't have to do those occasional touches to reassure your tablet that you are still using it and make sure it doesn't automatically turn off.-on
B008DWG5HE,24,22,I don't have anything negative to say about the tablet except that I keep taking screenshots by mistake but then again I am still getting used to the touch screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,23,To do this, instead of starting a new note (by touching the plus sign), you touch the menu and then choose import.
B008DWG5HE,24,24,Even when you are doing the multiscreen, there is no lag at all (except that it takes 0.5 seconds to move to another screen).
B008DWG5HE,25,0,Wish I would have gone with the I-Pad.
B008DWG5HE,25,1,iPad isn't.
B008DWG5HE,25,2,This tablet makes the iPad obsolete.
B008DWG5HE,25,3,Bye bye Apple Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,4,I also didn't like how on ipad you can only line up the Apps in little rows.
B008DWG5HE,25,5,So much better then an iPad!
B008DWG5HE,25,6,I have an Ipad as well as this Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,7,And it has everything that my Ipad has.
B008DWG5HE,25,8,It can do everything the ipad can plus much more.
B008DWG5HE,25,9,I debated for a while between the ipad and the samsung galaxy note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,10,And then I gave my iPad to my cousin..
B008DWG5HE,25,11,iPad bites the dust.
B008DWG5HE,25,12,I would rather have all Samsung Note  10.1's then I would Ipads.
B008DWG5HE,25,13,Problem:  Ipad  or  Samsung Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,14,Hasta la vista ipad....
B008DWG5HE,25,15,From that outlook, it is better than the Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,16,So much better than Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,17,This device is much better than what all the reviews say.
B008DWG5HE,25,18,It's Samsung time now.
B008DWG5HE,25,19,Why would anyone buy an iPad?
B008DWG5HE,25,20,Even on the iPad 2, I still had at least 1 or 2 freeze/crush every other day or so.
B008DWG5HE,25,21,I have 5 Note 10.1 and 3 IPads.
B008DWG5HE,25,22,To me Apple is a niche product.
B008DWG5HE,25,23,Just Great compared to new IPAD.
B008DWG5HE,25,24,This device is very similar to the Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,26,0,Used new cable and old charger and it charged, used old cable and new charger and NO CHARGE.
B008DWG5HE,26,1,My Note stopped charging with both AC charger and through USB.
B008DWG5HE,26,2,I also like that I can connect it to my computer's USB port and use it as an external hard drive.
B008DWG5HE,26,3,The propriety SAMSUNG plug is BS but has faster charging than micro USB.
B008DWG5HE,26,4,Wish it used micro usb rather than proprietary data connection.
B008DWG5HE,26,5,Mainly, when I try and charge the Note while using it, the charging cable fits into the bottom of the device.
B008DWG5HE,26,6,I can connect other non-Samsung devices to my tablet so I don't have to buy proprietary adapters.
B008DWG5HE,26,7,Minus another for that port being for a proprietary power plug.
B008DWG5HE,26,8,To plug a flash/thumb drive directly into the Note 10.1 you have to buy a adapter.
B008DWG5HE,26,9,When I plug in a USB external hard drive to the tablet, the tablet tells me that the USB device requires too much power to operate (stick with the thumb drives, or AC adapter powered external HDDs).
B008DWG5HE,26,10,You can transfer files but the power output from standard USB ports is not strong enough to power the Note.
B008DWG5HE,26,11,The charge cord is a little short.
B008DWG5HE,26,12,I even tried connecting the tablet to the USB adapter to a USB SD card reader and finally to an SD card.
B008DWG5HE,26,13,Using both new adapter and cable my Note charged flawlessly.
B008DWG5HE,26,14,Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such.
B008DWG5HE,26,15,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,26,16,I will, however, note that the utter lack of external ports is disappointing.
B008DWG5HE,26,17,Just be aware, you will NOT be able to charge this baby by simply plugging the charging cable into the USB port of your computer.
B008DWG5HE,26,18,The cables are the problem.
B008DWG5HE,26,19,The charging cable that comes with the unit is very short and does not let you charge the unit while using it unless you sit next to the wall outlet.
B008DWG5HE,26,20,I ordered several replacement cables (Note to charger/USB) and a new AC adapter.
B008DWG5HE,26,21,It is used for charging as well as a connector for Memory cards, USB's or anything else you might need to link to the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,26,22,Female USB OTG adapter) which allows you to hook up a flash card reader or a USB thumb drive to your tablet.
B008DWG5HE,26,23,Apparently the output from a PC USB port isn't enough to charge the Note (which I can understand).
B008DWG5HE,26,24,The only thing that I don't like about it is that there is no usb port.
B008DWG5HE,27,0,The device must be reset.
B008DWG5HE,27,1,We can't do anything on it, we can't even get to the home screen without it going nuts.
B008DWG5HE,27,2,The things that I cannot do on this device are few, and most are because I haven't dedicated enough time to learning all the tricks that can be done with this.
B008DWG5HE,27,3,iPad 2 screen looks the same to me as Note 10.1.Galaxy
B008DWG5HE,27,4,As I was setting it up, I started to become very jealous.
B008DWG5HE,27,5,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,27,6,There is practically no learning curve, although in three days, I haven't explored everything it can do.One caution:  When setting it up, it will ask for your location.
B008DWG5HE,27,7,The top of the box had a "Quality Control" check-off sheet stating that the data had been wiped, factory reset was completed, and everything was inspected.
B008DWG5HE,27,8,I was set to keep the tablet but it started to have performance issues.
B008DWG5HE,27,9,Want to turn off apps?
B008DWG5HE,27,10,Having to learn all its quirks and options (especially with the stylus) requires a long and steep learning curve, there are absolutely no instructions, so prepare for having to google for just about anything a bit more sophisticated you want to do.
B008DWG5HE,27,11,I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.Bad things (I think)-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful.
B008DWG5HE,27,12,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,27,13,Likewise, it would not have been beneficial to anyone if I had just blasted the device without spending any time using it.
B008DWG5HE,27,14,The Note has its button conveniently located on the top edge of the device.
B008DWG5HE,27,15,I ended up buying an iPad 4 and my complaint is the same for Apple.
B008DWG5HE,27,16,I also connect to multiple WiFi networks at work and other locations and never have an issue trying to connect.-
B008DWG5HE,27,17,They look pretty horrible and are pretty useless.
B008DWG5HE,27,18,even found some great apps to tutor my kids on it.i'm
B008DWG5HE,27,19,And I confess, I bought one of the first iPads when they came out, have upgraded every time since so am pretty much married to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,27,20,The first day it died, the next day after updates on the second  day wifi issues.
B008DWG5HE,27,21,After about two months of owning this thing, it's basically taken over my life...in a good way!
B008DWG5HE,27,22,There is a steep learning curve and the manuals/tutorials included from Samsung are terribly bare.
B008DWG5HE,27,23,All the time is spent making good apps for the ibad.
B008DWG5HE,27,24,Great time saver.Notes: Some observations I have made.-
B008DWG5HE,28,0,According to Samsung customer service it wont be unblocked any time soon.
B008DWG5HE,28,1,I hope I don't have any warranty issues...
B008DWG5HE,28,2,I returned it in 1 month, it had similar problems.
B008DWG5HE,28,3,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B008DWG5HE,28,4,I have had it now for 4 months and have had very few issue's.
B008DWG5HE,28,5,Samsung is impossible to contact regarding these issues and when you find a way to contact them you may never get an answer, at least I didn't.
B008DWG5HE,28,6,Seven months later, after many problems,  Asus refunded my money.
B008DWG5HE,28,7,My girlfriend has taken video footage with her phone (an Apple phone, that she has never had a problem with she says) of this device freaking out for minutes on end.
B008DWG5HE,28,8,I rated it 3 stars, because I am sure it's an ok product, but the one we got is a HUGE disappointment, especially coming from Samsung!!!I have already emailed the company that I bought it from, hopefully they step up and help me out, because a lot of money was paid for a dud product!
B008DWG5HE,28,9,Samsung's time has come.
B008DWG5HE,28,10,Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned.
B008DWG5HE,28,11,I hope you find this review helpful.
B008DWG5HE,28,12,I guess I will again have to hunt for myself to see if I can find specs.I don't know whether Samsung is inexperienced in the tablet world and their customer service isn't up to speed, or they are reacting to all the litigation issues with Apple, or both, but I'm disappointed that I'm having to figure things out myself.
B008DWG5HE,28,13,This review details my experience since I could find zero reviews or help (including going to the Samsung store) to find out.
B008DWG5HE,28,14,Probably a good learning experience for me, but be forewarned if you're not really tech-savvy and wanting to venture into the tablet world....you won't get much help from Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,28,15,I have purchased so many things through amazon over the last 7 or so years but this is my first review.
B008DWG5HE,28,16,I've had the tablet for a week now and mostly like it a lot.
B008DWG5HE,28,17,Never a problem with anything and prompt customer support (I needed one time cause I didn't realize I had not removed the hold down drum bolts to my washer when setting it up...stupid me).
B008DWG5HE,28,18,A phone call to Samsung tech support, and YES - Samsung BELIEVES in customer support at no extra charge, confirmed the absence of autofocus in the rear facing camera!
B008DWG5HE,28,19,NOT HAPPY!!!! Got a defective product!
B008DWG5HE,28,20,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,28,21,Hopefully the more people email them, they'll get it out soon.
B008DWG5HE,28,22,I ordered this tablet immediately when Amazon posted it with 1-day shipping and as of 7/20/2013 I haven't had any issues as a few users seem to have reported.
B008DWG5HE,28,23,In the past few years I have purchased washer/dryers, plasma TVs, cell phones, refrigerators, all Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,28,24,Way to go, Samsung... and THANK YOU for making me one very happy customer!
B008DWG5HE,29,0,I installed it because my Windows 7 PC would not properly identify my Note until KIES was installed.
B008DWG5HE,29,1,And if you can't find your window, just hit the windows icon on the bottom and it shows a list of open windows.
B008DWG5HE,29,2,I am also disappointed that you can't shrink windows down to a single bar at the bottom of the screen like you can in Microsoft Windows for PC.
B008DWG5HE,29,3,I will update as I get more with my Note in the future.FYI: I am an expert in windows and linux.
B008DWG5HE,29,4,Instead, if you want to make a window disappear from the screen, you have to close the app appearing in the window.
B008DWG5HE,29,5,Instead of upgrading my old desktop computer, I decided to give a tablet a try.
B008DWG5HE,29,6,Switching from one window to another merely requires a tap on the window you want to work in.
B008DWG5HE,29,7,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,29,8,I tried a Windows tablet last year and they were not ready for my needs at that time.
B008DWG5HE,29,9,No reboots, complex downloads or installs etc.then cam iMacs and time machines and MacBooks.I found that I spent way less time fixing computers and instead was using them.
B008DWG5HE,29,10,You can also resize the windows and move them around.Touch Wiz is on top of Android and Works Seamlessly with it.
B008DWG5HE,29,11,I have had several windows open at one time and noticed no visible lag.
B008DWG5HE,29,12,But when you update your software to the Jellybean version (4.1,
B008DWG5HE,29,13,At least my Windows 7 PC has Gadgets... Right???- iPad makes me look hip.
B008DWG5HE,29,14,The 10.1" also has the same software update as the 8", so it's essentially the same thing, only bigger.
B008DWG5HE,29,15,I'll update my review later after that update to let y'all know what I observe.
B008DWG5HE,29,16,I have owned 8 Android Tablets and one Windows tablet.
B008DWG5HE,29,17,It is another thing that I like the most.The only downside is that you need enough time to get used to the software.
B008DWG5HE,29,18,Also all the screens and bar at the bottom are Very busy.
B008DWG5HE,29,19,Unless you are needing a gaming PC, desktops will be filed with the Edsel.
B008DWG5HE,29,20,Windows 8 Tablets - Since recent IFA Berlin showed several upcoming Windows 8 tablet, I have decided to give a quick comparison to them.3.
B008DWG5HE,29,21,is slow to push updates.
B008DWG5HE,29,22,Make sure you force your Note browser into 'desktop view' and you will be able to view the full site and use all features on it just fine.-
B008DWG5HE,29,23,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,29,24,When I learned that PS Touch was pre installed in the Note, I decided to try it.

B00CYQPM42,1,0,Not enough apps.
B00CYQPM42,1,1,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,1,2,I have found many useful lifestyle apps (food diaries, calorie counters, etc).
B00CYQPM42,1,3,There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation.
B00CYQPM42,1,4,Does not do Google plus and most apps...
B00CYQPM42,1,5,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,1,6,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,1,7,app.
B00CYQPM42,1,8,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,1,9,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,1,10,not playing videos.
B00CYQPM42,1,11,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,1,12,I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet.
B00CYQPM42,1,13,The only downfall is no Google play store access.
B00CYQPM42,1,14,Now, whenever possible, I'm going to download the movie to my tablet, and then watch it from the download.
B00CYQPM42,1,15,Amazon you need to fix your App store
B00CYQPM42,1,16,But if you want a tablet that has unrestricted access to every app out there, you'll have to look elsewhere.
B00CYQPM42,1,17,With an Android device, you can access the Amazon Android store, but with a Kindle Fire, you cannot access the Google Play store.
B00CYQPM42,1,18,my daughter really wanted the furby boom app for her furby and we found out later it was only available through google play..
B00CYQPM42,1,19,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,1,20,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,1,21,My favorite game app doesn't make them for the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,1,22,But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased.
B00CYQPM42,1,23,If Amazon would just switch to Google Play for the app store, then there is nothing that would stop them from ruling the world!
B00CYQPM42,1,24,I'm really enjoying all the Apps and playing "Candycrush"!
B00CYQPM42,2,0,I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BUY!

B00CYQPM42,2,9,Pleased with purchase.
B00CYQPM42,2,10,I would highly recommend this tablet.
B00CYQPM42,2,11,But it probably wouldn't been worth the money.
B00CYQPM42,2,12,I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,2,13,If you are not, then buy it anyway as you will save at least $100 over the nearest priced iPad.
B00CYQPM42,2,14,Good Enough.
B00CYQPM42,2,15,Good purchase.
B00CYQPM42,2,16,But overall I would recommend this product.

B00CYQPM42,2,23,I would highly recommend this device to anyone.
B00CYQPM42,2,24,I recommend it Highly

B00CYQPM42,3,16,Battery life is great so far.-
B00CYQPM42,3,17,The lousy battery life is my main complaint, however.
B00CYQPM42,3,18,And the battery life is the best I have ever had.
B00CYQPM42,3,19,Battery life is ok - probably need to recharge every other day with normal use.
B00CYQPM42,3,20,Light weightBattery life is over 10 hours.
B00CYQPM42,3,21,Battery life is solid.
B00CYQPM42,3,22,Battery only last for two to three  hours.
B00CYQPM42,3,23,(Yes, there are ways to extend battery life, such as turning off wifi when not using it.
B00CYQPM42,3,24,With the wifi off…battery life is very good.
B00CYQPM42,4,0,Sound good.
B00CYQPM42,4,1,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,2,This feels really good in your hand and the screen is BEAUTIFUL.
B00CYQPM42,4,3,The HD quality is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,4,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,4,5,Sound is really good (not home theater quality or anything) but better than any phone I've heard.
B00CYQPM42,4,6,I feel like the hd speakers are a little better than this, but not much.
B00CYQPM42,4,7,I can not believe how good even the speakers are given the size of this device.
B00CYQPM42,4,8,The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.
B00CYQPM42,4,9,Decent sound
B00CYQPM42,4,10,The screen is fantastic and the speakers produce great sound that is fairly loud.
B00CYQPM42,4,11,Clear picture, quality sound.
B00CYQPM42,4,12,The sound while listening to audiobooks and movies is very good.
B00CYQPM42,4,13,Really good.
B00CYQPM42,4,14,found the speakers to have decent sound.
B00CYQPM42,4,15,A great tablet at a great price.
B00CYQPM42,4,16,Great tablet at a great price...
B00CYQPM42,4,17,sound is phenomenal, especially for such a little device.
B00CYQPM42,4,18,Everything I expected and more.
B00CYQPM42,4,19,The built in speakers are also better than my iPad 1.
B00CYQPM42,4,20,better picture and the sound is amazing!
B00CYQPM42,4,21,The kindle display is good and the speakers are terrific for such a small device.
B00CYQPM42,4,22,the audio books sound very good
B00CYQPM42,4,23,The color is amazing and the sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,24,The colors are richer and sound is much better.
B00CYQPM42,5,0,that isn't really a camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,1,this is not good because it does not seem you can take a picture of something you are looking at.
B00CYQPM42,5,2,Takes great pictures!
B00CYQPM42,5,3,The picture quality is absurd.
B00CYQPM42,5,4,The poor quality front facing only camera on it.
B00CYQPM42,5,5,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,6,It could only be more perfect if it had a front facing camera!
B00CYQPM42,5,7,I also don't like the front only camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,8,Picture is clear, color is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,9,The camera could be a little better, but very nice to be able to Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,10,Image is very good.
B00CYQPM42,5,11,The built in camera is so nice and takes anexcellent picture.
B00CYQPM42,5,12,The only pictures you can take of are yourself because if you turn it around you can't see what you are taking a picture of.
B00CYQPM42,5,13,Good tablet overall but the thing is the appstore its has about 10x less than the apple apps in the appstore
B00CYQPM42,5,14,Very easy to use and the picture quality is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,5,15,The camera is awesome...
B00CYQPM42,5,16,The only draw back is that the camera lens is on the front (facing you) so the only thing you can really do is take selfies, which I DON'T do.
B00CYQPM42,5,17,The good and the bad.
B00CYQPM42,5,18,The 7” version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.
B00CYQPM42,5,19,she does however have a problem with the camera part, apparently you can only take pictures that are facing the front of the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,5,20,Decent tablet.
B00CYQPM42,5,21,Very good better than what a t I expected.The only thing is the camera it only have front and not back.But I guess that's why it have the kindle hdx8.9 cause that have both.
B00CYQPM42,5,22,I don't like just front camera ure feature..rather, I prefer rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,23,VERY GOOD! Love this thing...........except the camera is on the WRONG side.
B00CYQPM42,5,24,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,6,0,A great tablet at a great price.
B00CYQPM42,6,1,Great tablet at a great price...
B00CYQPM42,6,2,The processor is fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,3,Great value!
B00CYQPM42,6,4,Fast, very fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,5,The screen is just beautiful.
B00CYQPM42,6,6,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,6,7,Amazing, Fast, Beautiful display.
B00CYQPM42,6,8,Very nice display
B00CYQPM42,6,9,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,6,10,The graphics are great.
B00CYQPM42,6,11,This is a great device at an exceptional price.
B00CYQPM42,6,12,like he says, it does it all, and the graphics are great and so easy to take along wherever you go.
B00CYQPM42,6,13,The screen is beautiful and it is incredibly fast!
B00CYQPM42,6,14,It has a great screen, it's lightweight, and the price is right.
B00CYQPM42,6,15,very nice apps, the resolution and sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,6,16,Really great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,6,17,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,6,18,Awesome screen.
B00CYQPM42,6,19,Great resolution.
B00CYQPM42,6,20,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,6,21,Easy to use, lots of apps, light weight, and the screen is very clear.
B00CYQPM42,6,22,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,6,23,Display is amazingly sharp, and the android OS is very fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,24,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,7,0,She has so much more storage space.
B00CYQPM42,7,1,However, this tablet is so much faster and with the 64 GB of storage I can do so much more.
B00CYQPM42,7,2,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,7,3,Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover.
B00CYQPM42,7,4,MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229.
B00CYQPM42,7,5,The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB.
B00CYQPM42,7,6,64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB.
B00CYQPM42,7,7,Movies, books, audio, and apps all run in superior order, with the only down side, is memory expandability (an extra slot for loading more solid state memory as a card).
B00CYQPM42,7,8,If you're not sold on the reigning king of the tablet space, this is a good option for most users.
B00CYQPM42,7,9,32GB will provide you more memory space for pics, hd movies, etc. Apps eat up a lot of memory quickly.I recommend that Amazon provide the approx number of movies etc can be stored on each kindle model with its specs.
B00CYQPM42,7,10,This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size.
B00CYQPM42,7,11,vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video.
B00CYQPM42,7,12,GB) of storage per hour.
B00CYQPM42,7,13,Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB
B00CYQPM42,7,14,too many slot pop ups.
B00CYQPM42,7,15,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,7,16,Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality.
B00CYQPM42,7,17,An HDMI output would have been good for the HDX also.
B00CYQPM42,7,18,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,7,19,I got the 32 GB version, so there is plenty of room for games and other apps.
B00CYQPM42,7,20,To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80.
B00CYQPM42,7,21,I highly recommend purchasing 32 GB .
B00CYQPM42,7,22,Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at $229 for the 16GB of memory model ($309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature.
B00CYQPM42,7,23,The 16 GB isn't really 16 GB, which is par for the course.
B00CYQPM42,7,24,It loads much faster, is more clear and has more GBs than the older model.
B00CYQPM42,8,0,Great for watching movies and surfing the web.
B00CYQPM42,8,1,I use it for not only reading but gaming, email, and surfing the net.
B00CYQPM42,8,2,Movies look great, games look great, photos and games look great.
B00CYQPM42,8,3,It works very well for music, reading docucuments and general web page browsing mhm habit video watching I is quite unreliable.
B00CYQPM42,8,4,I can check e-mails, facebook, read, play games.
B00CYQPM42,8,5,It's easy to use and provides a high-quality experience for reading e-Books, browsing the Internet and watching video.
B00CYQPM42,8,6,They play games on it too.
B00CYQPM42,8,7,Love It!! What a great device!!
B00CYQPM42,8,8,I have an iPad 2 and really don't like it for reading.
B00CYQPM42,8,9,I do however have problems reading and watching movies while out in the sun.
B00CYQPM42,8,10,I read and write email, surf the web, read and listen to books and watch videos.
B00CYQPM42,8,11,Regardless if your looking for something to watch Netflix on, read books, and surf the web it's excellent.
B00CYQPM42,8,12,Is an easy way to surf trough internet.
B00CYQPM42,8,13,I haven't found it to be annoying at all and shouldn't be a deal-breaker.I use the device for reading of books and magazines, watching movies and television shows, playing games, e-mail and light surfing of the web.
B00CYQPM42,8,14,Great traveling companion.
B00CYQPM42,8,15,I don't use my laptop nearly as much.
B00CYQPM42,8,16,Great job, AmazonDownloads of movies and games are quick.
B00CYQPM42,8,17,Also love Fashioning and web surfing on it.
B00CYQPM42,8,18,It's very easy to use, and I like being able to read books and the Bible on it.
B00CYQPM42,8,19,I love being able to check e-mail on it also.
B00CYQPM42,8,20,Works great.
B00CYQPM42,8,21,So if your looking for a tablet that you are going to use to play media from Amazon and to surf the web and play games.
B00CYQPM42,8,22,I use my Kindle for web surfing, reading, watching an occasional movie.
B00CYQPM42,8,23,Good device.
B00CYQPM42,8,24,Great for reading books and listening to music.
B00CYQPM42,9,0,As great as the ads said it would be!
B00CYQPM42,9,1,The only thing I don't like is the keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,9,2,They are small and fit comfortable in your hands, easy set up, easy screens to screens, everything is at your finger tips.
B00CYQPM42,9,3,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,9,4,The touch sceen on the iPad also works a lot smoother and is more accurate.
B00CYQPM42,9,5,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,9,6,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,9,7,I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).
B00CYQPM42,9,8,The notepad app. is a nice feature.
B00CYQPM42,9,9,It's ways to buy apps.
B00CYQPM42,9,10,The only way that my dad could use this would be if I opened the device, selected the book that he wanted, set up the text for him and then handed it to him.
B00CYQPM42,9,11,best multipurpose tablet in medium size.
B00CYQPM42,9,12,I used to think that I preferred to read books on paper, but with this it is far easier.
B00CYQPM42,9,13,It also feels better in the hand then other tablets.As with all non-iOS products, it doesn't have all of the apps or usability that I'd like, but that will come with time.
B00CYQPM42,9,14,I love the ability to highlight, write notes, etc. on books and PDF files.
B00CYQPM42,9,15,I am using it to write this review, actually.
B00CYQPM42,9,16,I normally don't write reviews, even when I like something.
B00CYQPM42,9,17,Love Love Love.
B00CYQPM42,9,18,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,9,19,Not only does its features allow for a comfortable read, I can carry all my books with me!
B00CYQPM42,9,20,I keep finding things that  I didn't know were there.
B00CYQPM42,9,21,The device itself is light, easy to use, and pretty to look at.
B00CYQPM42,9,22,I love the predictive keyboard, which to me is similar to my iPad minis, because I can make a lot of mistakes typing quickly.
B00CYQPM42,9,23,Nice tablet, but... Great little tablet.
B00CYQPM42,9,24,This is easy to use and syncs with all my apps easily.
B00CYQPM42,10,0,love love love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,1,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,2,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,3,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,4,i love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,5,I love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,6,love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,7,It's Great.
B00CYQPM42,10,8,Love, love, love.
B00CYQPM42,10,9,Love Love Love.
B00CYQPM42,10,10,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,10,11,And the possibilities are endless!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!
B00CYQPM42,10,12,Love it!!
B00CYQPM42,10,13,Really great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,14,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,15,It looks great too.
B00CYQPM42,10,16,Great.
B00CYQPM42,10,17,love, love, love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,18,Great Tablet, Love It !
B00CYQPM42,10,19,LOVE, LOVE!!!
B00CYQPM42,10,20,love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,21,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,22,it..love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,23,love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,24,Great Tablet.
B00CYQPM42,11,0,Only thing that is really lacking is a USB port otherwise it is a great little product.
B00CYQPM42,11,1,Nice unit.
B00CYQPM42,11,2,Now I just have to find a pretty case for it!!
B00CYQPM42,11,3,The Lack of even a mini USB port.
B00CYQPM42,11,4,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,11,5,I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.
B00CYQPM42,11,6,Then they took away the HDMI port which I use often to play a movies on my TV.
B00CYQPM42,11,7,The placement of the USB port for charger is a great improvement.
B00CYQPM42,11,8,My phone did and our laptop did but mind showed me a keyboard and asked for a pin????
B00CYQPM42,11,9,You should really get a case for it because it is really thin.
B00CYQPM42,11,10,The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3.
B00CYQPM42,11,11,Except....when I took it to the beach and opened the cover, I didn't see a way to connect to the hotel's wi fi.
B00CYQPM42,11,12,When I realized too late that it had no HDMI out, I bought a Tronsmart miracast device.
B00CYQPM42,11,13,Again my old Droid telephone provides a USB port and offers a charging device with a built in USB hub that allows me to connect to any number of external attachments, and this tablet does not.Regretfully the impact of these limitations did not come to mind when I bought the Kindle, but would have if I knew the fully understood the tablets limitations.Would I recommend this tablet to friends or family?
B00CYQPM42,11,14,Was so impressed I bought another one for my son.Ted A
B00CYQPM42,11,15,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,11,16,With the wifi off…battery life is very good.
B00CYQPM42,11,17,Would recommend buying a case for this and all kindles since they can be slippery at times.
B00CYQPM42,11,18,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,11,19,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,11,20,Easy to use, lots of apps, light weight, and the screen is very clear.
B00CYQPM42,11,21,Great features but if you are not near an outlet you are out of luck.
B00CYQPM42,11,22,The display is very nice and video and video games look great, but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device.The not so great things about the Kindle HDX 16 GB.1.
B00CYQPM42,11,23,Checking the accessory list, they don't even offer a wireless Miracast to HDMI receiver!
B00CYQPM42,11,24,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,12,0,I'm an avid Apple product user and not a fan of Android phone OS.
B00CYQPM42,12,1,They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.
B00CYQPM42,12,2,Excellent Device but very resiticted operationg system.
B00CYQPM42,12,3,The only thing is that the HDX has a different look for the Android Operating System which is actually very nice.
B00CYQPM42,12,4,There is VERY little customization, my android phone is much more user interface friendly, this, this is just messy.If you can manage through the funky menu system it's a good device, good reader, good gamer, good surfer, just lousy interface, not overly user friendly at all.
B00CYQPM42,12,5,Android based little powerhouse.
B00CYQPM42,12,6,This is by far my best experience with a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,12,7,Not the best tablet, but perhaps the best value.
B00CYQPM42,12,8,The reason I only gave it  4 stars is some of the features that come with it don't work as they should.
B00CYQPM42,12,9,This tablet also doesn't have flash along with all modern Android and Apple products.
B00CYQPM42,12,10,Operates fast and smooth.
B00CYQPM42,12,11,Otherwise this product is great!
B00CYQPM42,12,12,Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.
B00CYQPM42,12,13,5 star hardware, 3 star software.
B00CYQPM42,12,14,Very user friendly.
B00CYQPM42,12,15,It would not operate.
B00CYQPM42,12,16,The hardware is excellent, and the user interface is pretty good as well.
B00CYQPM42,12,17,Very user friendly.
B00CYQPM42,12,18,While I'm not familiar with other operating systems, I will say that Fire OS is very smooth.
B00CYQPM42,12,19,The horsepower running this modified Android tablet makes all of the applications hum along.
B00CYQPM42,12,20,Easy to operate and easy to carry with her wherever she goes
B00CYQPM42,12,21,So far it is user friendly.
B00CYQPM42,12,22,She had me "update" the system.
B00CYQPM42,12,23,I am very happy with easy ability to operate.
B00CYQPM42,12,24,Good tablet overall but the thing is the appstore its has about 10x less than the apple apps in the appstore
B00CYQPM42,13,0,If I had known I wouldn't have purchased this product.
B00CYQPM42,13,1,I returned this product.
B00CYQPM42,13,2,You now must purchase an additional product from amazon at a cost of around $100.
B00CYQPM42,13,3,fast shipping.
B00CYQPM42,13,4,Great product!
B00CYQPM42,13,5,Received it and for a few days tried to come up with a reason why I should not like it and send it back and order an iPad mini2.
B00CYQPM42,13,6,It’s not like it used to be, buy our product and use it as you wish.
B00CYQPM42,13,7,So, in the end, this device has been boxed back up and will be going back to Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,13,8,Well I have to tell ya that this little device is as good as Amazon says!
B00CYQPM42,13,9,I'm pretty aggravated any time I have to deal with Amazon Customer Service.
B00CYQPM42,13,10,I want to return it.
B00CYQPM42,13,11,I called customer service AGAIN and asked if I was eligible for a refund and they told me that because this was a replacement device I could not have a refund.
B00CYQPM42,13,12,Do not purchase as a gift or you will have a hard time getting warranty replacement.
B00CYQPM42,13,13,everything amazon claims it to be.great purchase.
B00CYQPM42,13,14,I was able to purchase this product during Amazon's wonderful Cyber Monday sale.
B00CYQPM42,13,15,Amazon service is great and the Prime has paid for its self.
B00CYQPM42,13,16,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,13,17,Great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,18,However, I am largely happy with my purchase, and am definitely happy with Amazon's customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,19,I'm always gun shy to exchange things quickly because OEMs tend to send you a refurb for your new device.These two items make the device a neutral buy rating for me.
B00CYQPM42,13,20,Thank you Amazon for making such a wonderful product and for having such wonderful customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,21,I think they are a great value and being backed by amazon means they will be supported for a long time.
B00CYQPM42,13,22,Now I can't wait to see what else Amazon has in store for us.
B00CYQPM42,13,23,Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If
B00CYQPM42,13,24,You will love this device and you can get free two day shipping with this offer.
B00CYQPM42,14,0,Nice.
B00CYQPM42,14,1,Mostly excellent device.
B00CYQPM42,14,2,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,14,3,This device is the best digital do hicky I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,14,4,My next was an iPad 2 and then a Microsoft Surface Pro.
B00CYQPM42,14,5,Did not realize all the Apps available for this tablet and functionality this tablet provides.
B00CYQPM42,14,6,Spearkers, one of the best in relation to same size tabsSmooth software.
B00CYQPM42,14,7,Beautiful and functional!
B00CYQPM42,14,8,It excels at this in almost every way, from hardware to software.
B00CYQPM42,14,9,Smooth operation of software and other functions.
B00CYQPM42,14,10,The first thing they'll be shocked by is the beautiful screen.They've done everything right with the hardware.
B00CYQPM42,14,11,It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade.
B00CYQPM42,14,12,First things first; the screen!
B00CYQPM42,14,13,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,14,14,For simply an entertainment device this is fantastic.
B00CYQPM42,14,15,pro and con.
B00CYQPM42,14,16,While it's not perfect, it still provides the same functions you would find in other tablets (some of which are better).
B00CYQPM42,14,17,It was right there for free in the app store and works beautifully on this device.
B00CYQPM42,14,18,I could move the little window wherever I wanted.
B00CYQPM42,14,19,Still learning some of the less used features as I go.
B00CYQPM42,14,20,This is a good product that was I expected to be because it has a better screen and more features than any other tablet.
B00CYQPM42,14,21,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,14,22,I ended up returning but if you're looking for simply an entertainment device this is fantastic.
B00CYQPM42,14,23,Google you can't exactly use Microsoft office but does have word processing capabilities for all of us "on-the-go" and who can't afford the beautiful new window tablets.
B00CYQPM42,14,24,Good Product!
B00CYQPM42,15,0,Very Clear Screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,1,Great Screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,2,Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.
B00CYQPM42,15,3,It is just a slight blue haze at the borders--when displaying white--of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,4,Beautiful display screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,5,The only other problem I have noticed is with the screen resolution.
B00CYQPM42,15,6,And it just looks sharp with the black screen and backing.
B00CYQPM42,15,7,This screen issue not so much.
B00CYQPM42,15,8,the screen is clear.
B00CYQPM42,15,9,Good size screen and colors.
B00CYQPM42,15,10,The screen resolution is perfect.
B00CYQPM42,15,11,I see zero blue hue with a black screen as well.
B00CYQPM42,15,12,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,15,13,Great tablet, but again the 7" screen doesn't cut it.
B00CYQPM42,15,14,As for the rest, the screen is very sharp, and colors are great.
B00CYQPM42,15,15,I even showed my grown daughter the "offending" screen (saying nothing of the complaints) asking her if she saw anything, anything at all unusual or bothersome about the reading screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,16,There are 4 obvious shadows at the bottom of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,17,I don't think its so horrible that you won't be able to read on the white screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,18,I have noticed my screen flickers when I am using an app that has color (basically everything except reading).
B00CYQPM42,15,19,screen is sharp.
B00CYQPM42,15,20,The screen displays are crisp and easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,15,21,The reflections are the worst when the screen is mainly black, which happens often because the main screen of the tablet is black.
B00CYQPM42,15,22,First things first; the screen!
B00CYQPM42,15,23,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,15,24,Awesome screen.
B00CYQPM42,16,0,To few apps.
B00CYQPM42,16,1,All it needs is a suitable app store.
B00CYQPM42,16,2,App store is awful!!!!!!!!!!
B00CYQPM42,16,3,Why is there no app for an update for Flash Player?
B00CYQPM42,16,4,By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.
B00CYQPM42,16,5,Amazon you need to fix your App store
B00CYQPM42,16,6,There are more apps being added constantly and so far I've found everything I've needed in the app store.
B00CYQPM42,16,7,Runs on a android system but does not allow google play.
B00CYQPM42,16,8,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,16,9,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,16,10,I was also able to install a flash player and can now run any flash web apps through the Dolphin web browser.
B00CYQPM42,16,11,No podcast player app.
B00CYQPM42,16,12,The child or toddler apps I did download would freeze, not only the app but also the tablet!
B00CYQPM42,16,13,Not enough apps.
B00CYQPM42,16,14,Also if i want to install google apps it is possible.
B00CYQPM42,16,15,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,16,16,files, you may not find all the apps you want or need - at this time.
B00CYQPM42,16,17,No Google Chromecast.
B00CYQPM42,16,18,Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more.
B00CYQPM42,16,19,So some websites with videos cant play the videos.
B00CYQPM42,16,20,If you want a legitimate version of any Google product, or many other Google play apps, you cannot install it without a side-load situation.
B00CYQPM42,16,21,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,16,22,No YouTube app.
B00CYQPM42,16,23,The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!
B00CYQPM42,16,24,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,17,0,Purchased 3 of the these for Christmas.
B00CYQPM42,17,1,I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter.
B00CYQPM42,17,2,I bought two of these for Christmas, one for me one and one as a gift, at $179.
B00CYQPM42,17,3,Great gift and she cant put it down..nope, she is 43...LOL
B00CYQPM42,17,4,Bought this for my spouse and he loves it.
B00CYQPM42,17,5,Great gifts.
B00CYQPM42,17,6,I bought one for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.
B00CYQPM42,17,7,My son (8) bought this with his own money.
B00CYQPM42,17,8,I wish I never bought it!
B00CYQPM42,17,9,This was a Christmas gift for our son.
B00CYQPM42,17,10,Christmas Gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,11,Great Christmas gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,12,It was a Christmas present.
B00CYQPM42,17,13,Great gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,14,Wish I had purchased something else.
B00CYQPM42,17,15,great gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,16,My 8 year old has a hard time putting it down.
B00CYQPM42,17,17,I bought two - one for each daughter - and they love them.
B00CYQPM42,17,18,I bought this as a gift for my husband.
B00CYQPM42,17,19,Great Gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,20,Great Christmas gift for my kids which are 6 and 9.
B00CYQPM42,17,21,Great Gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,22,This was a gift not sure I would purchase.
B00CYQPM42,17,23,We gave this to my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.
B00CYQPM42,17,24,(My daughter's christmas gift)
B00CYQPM42,18,0,The first one after less than a week woudn't charge.. Sent it back and they sent us a new one.
B00CYQPM42,18,1,Does not hold it's charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,2,Holds its charge well.
B00CYQPM42,18,3,I have to hold the power button down for 15 seconds or more for it to shut off.
B00CYQPM42,18,4,One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,5,I had no problems with the battery.
B00CYQPM42,18,6,Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours.
B00CYQPM42,18,7,The Kindle recently died, the battery cannot be charged, even when using a different charger.
B00CYQPM42,18,8,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,9,Really like this tablet, use it every day.
B00CYQPM42,18,10,The kindle came to me holding a charge so I could instantaneously turn it on and play with it.
B00CYQPM42,18,11,There is no time zone for EST.
B00CYQPM42,18,12,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,18,13,The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger.
B00CYQPM42,18,14,I have this unit for several weeks now and since then I have experienced a couple of slow down response and three "blue screens" although the unit is 40%, 80 % and 55 % charged, the first time it came back after 4 hours, the second and third time after several minutes.
B00CYQPM42,18,15,Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%.
B00CYQPM42,18,16,Fully charged at 100% and left over night will find the device down to 88% without use.
B00CYQPM42,18,17,I just can't have a device that I am constantly worried about keeping charged all the time.
B00CYQPM42,18,18,I did use the May day button to remove a popup screen I kept getting.
B00CYQPM42,18,19,Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.
B00CYQPM42,18,20,I tried with all my power to like the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,18,21,It continuously rebooted all day long.
B00CYQPM42,18,22,If the cord is propped up I can leave it plugged in all night and it won't charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,23,The battery charger is faulty and the only way I can charge the kindle is to prop up the cord.
B00CYQPM42,18,24,This is the second one that the freezing happens so I'm not sure if it's something mechanical or what the reason is for it freezing.
B00CYQPM42,19,0,In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough.
B00CYQPM42,19,1,I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones.
B00CYQPM42,19,2,Battery holds up well..speakers could have more volume.
B00CYQPM42,19,3,If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side.
B00CYQPM42,19,4,The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.
B00CYQPM42,19,5,The sound quality is also top notch.
B00CYQPM42,19,6,I also wished the speakers were in the front, but I am not complaining too much on that one.
B00CYQPM42,19,7,I wish the on/off button was located on the top or side in stead  of the bottom.
B00CYQPM42,19,8,If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder.
B00CYQPM42,19,9,Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me.
B00CYQPM42,19,10,IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side.
B00CYQPM42,19,11,Sound, power, silly-pretty display, feel...and did I mention power???
B00CYQPM42,19,12,The power button and volume control have been moved.
B00CYQPM42,19,13,The screen resolution is top notch, stereo speakers are loud and easy to adjust.
B00CYQPM42,19,14,- I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers.
B00CYQPM42,19,15,The speakers are located in the top, when in landscape mode, which is somewhat different from many other tablets, and adds to the usefulness of the tablet for watching videos.
B00CYQPM42,19,16,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,19,17,A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find!
B00CYQPM42,19,18,With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste.
B00CYQPM42,19,19,some people say that the speakers are not that loud.
B00CYQPM42,19,20,I miss being able to click on the top of the screen to get to settings.
B00CYQPM42,19,21,Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side.
B00CYQPM42,19,22,Hit the On/Off button accidentally for even a tenth of a second and it turns off.The volume button is also on the back, on the right side.
B00CYQPM42,19,23,The volume is a bit louder (when NOT using earphones) on the HD.
B00CYQPM42,19,24,When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic.
B00CYQPM42,20,0,that isn't really a camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,1,I did not like the way the camera was.
B00CYQPM42,20,2,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,3,The HDX has a front facing camera, but lacks a rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,4,It also doesn't have a rear facing camera, it only has a front facing one, like for apps such as Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,5,I don't like just front camera ure feature..rather, I prefer rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,6,she does however have a problem with the camera part, apparently you can only take pictures that are facing the front of the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,7,Also the camera is the worst part, the camera is only on the front of the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,8,#1 the camera on this model is only front facing but it seems that on all of the other HDX models that are larger they have a front AND rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,9,Very disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,20,10,I bought the unit over the nook because it stated that the unit had a camera, but did not specify that it was only and front facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,11,The Nexus 7 has both a rear and a front camera, while the Fire HDX only has a front camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,12,I ONLY WISH THE CAMERA WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
B00CYQPM42,20,13,The camera on the 7" is fine for Skype, but it is very disconcerting to use it for anything else.
B00CYQPM42,20,14,I also don't like the front only camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,15,The poor quality front facing only camera on it.
B00CYQPM42,20,16,You need a camera for Skype or other video app.-
B00CYQPM42,20,17,It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,18,The only camera is on the front side (screen side), so taking video or a picture with it is difficult because you can't see the screen.
B00CYQPM42,20,19,Disappointing.
B00CYQPM42,20,20,The rear facing camera would make my 32BG purchase choice more useful.
B00CYQPM42,20,21,Soo disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,20,22,If you want to take pics with your Kindle, get the one with camera on both sides.
B00CYQPM42,20,23,don't need a picture of my ugly mug looking at my kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,24,I had hoped I would be able to use it to take pictures and video as well as use it for video chat.
B00CYQPM42,21,0,it beyond our expectations.
B00CYQPM42,21,1,I still have to use my slow old computer.
B00CYQPM42,21,2,I have an iPad 1 and  wanted to upgrade due to slow speed and the inability to upgrade iOS/ app incompatibility.
B00CYQPM42,21,3,It is super fast, and my computer is old and slow.
B00CYQPM42,21,4,Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.
B00CYQPM42,21,5,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,21,6,Great Device, Better than expected.
B00CYQPM42,21,7,It comes with a 2.2GHz quad-core processor, which is the standard in the latest tablets.
B00CYQPM42,21,8,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,21,9,Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One.
B00CYQPM42,21,10,I didn't need a high end laptop or a desktop with an i7 processor or any kind of powerhouse.
B00CYQPM42,21,11,It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.
B00CYQPM42,21,12,There are more apps being added constantly and so far I've found everything I've needed in the app store.
B00CYQPM42,21,13,only two things i dislike: The Boot up time after you turn it off is slow, and the fact that i can't use Google Play.
B00CYQPM42,21,14,This is a good product that was I expected to be because it has a better screen and more features than any other tablet.
B00CYQPM42,21,15,I don't feel like I should have side load.
B00CYQPM42,21,16,I couldn't do this on my iPad.The touchscreen is very snappy with no lag at all.
B00CYQPM42,21,17,Much faster loading pages than my older tablet.
B00CYQPM42,21,18,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,21,19,No issues with games hanging (and they look beautiful).
B00CYQPM42,21,20,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,21,21,All in all it's okay, but I feel I could have done better with my 200 bucks by getting a nexus 7.
B00CYQPM42,21,22,The OS moves along with speed and I never notice a stutter.
B00CYQPM42,21,23,Good tablet overall but the thing is the appstore its has about 10x less than the apple apps in the appstore
B00CYQPM42,21,24,It delivered improved performance as advertised.I gave it to my wife for Christmas.
B00CYQPM42,22,0,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,1,For one, getting music to it (except music purchased through Amazon) is a pain, requiring a file transfer app to copy from my iTunes library.
B00CYQPM42,22,2,It is REALLY hard to quit apps.
B00CYQPM42,22,3,In this day and age, a table ought to have a Micro SD memory card slot for expansion, and an HDMI connector - ESPECIALLY a media tablet like these!
B00CYQPM42,22,4,But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing.
B00CYQPM42,22,5,My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats.
B00CYQPM42,22,6,Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage.
B00CYQPM42,22,7,Still having a few problems finding things on this one, after I got used to the last model.
B00CYQPM42,22,8,If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.
B00CYQPM42,22,9,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,22,10,But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased.
B00CYQPM42,22,11,The fact that the device does not support storage expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,12,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,22,13,She recognized right away that there was a problem since there was no video feed.
B00CYQPM42,22,14,It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2.
B00CYQPM42,22,15,The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB.
B00CYQPM42,22,16,Disappointing after owning an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,22,17,But I really could not have paid the price and I would have had to get a 16GB or a 32 GB.
B00CYQPM42,22,18,I play music and a game at the same time or music and read, music and read.
B00CYQPM42,22,19,Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge.
B00CYQPM42,22,20,16 gigs is just too little to carry much media with you, with the device using a large part of that 16 gigs, for it's UI and OS you are not even getting a full 16 gigs (more like 10).
B00CYQPM42,22,21,The lack of onboard storage (which was promoted earlier on as a none issue for modern users) has turned a real problem and the 16GB version actually leaves the user with closer to 8 or 9GB than the 16GB advertised.
B00CYQPM42,22,22,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,22,23,I purchased the 32gb.
B00CYQPM42,22,24,The original Fire did not have a MicroSD slot either, and I was hoping Amazon would add one, but they did not.
B00CYQPM42,23,0,WIFI Connectivity.
B00CYQPM42,23,1,Won't Connect to my Wireless Router.
B00CYQPM42,23,2,I am having problems with the WiFi hookup on occasion, but I'm sure there is an explanation for it.
B00CYQPM42,23,3,My other devices have never had an issue.
B00CYQPM42,23,4,wi-fi drops constantly.
B00CYQPM42,23,5,It is hard and slow to connect to WiFI unlike my other Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,6,The wi-fi connection drops constantly for no apparent reason.
B00CYQPM42,23,7,Thus, I ran into the very same connectivity issues that I had with my old Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,8,Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems.
B00CYQPM42,23,9,Wi-Fi quick.
B00CYQPM42,23,10,i got this particular model so i could have internet/ wifi anywhere.
B00CYQPM42,23,11,I found it very easy to connect to the Wi-Fi in each hotel we stayed at.
B00CYQPM42,23,12,It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day.
B00CYQPM42,23,13,Next time i will take the ipad.
B00CYQPM42,23,14,it constantly loses my wi-fi singnal (at least 2-3 times per day).
B00CYQPM42,23,15,Whenever I would connect to Wifi the Kindle would shut down and reboot.
B00CYQPM42,23,16,it would not connect to my account, among other things.
B00CYQPM42,23,17,If the connection issues were resolved, I would give this 5 stars.
B00CYQPM42,23,18,Today, I was at Starbucks, where I tried connecting to the internet through their free WIFI service, but failed to connect.
B00CYQPM42,23,19,Some days it works fine but once it starts acting up, it will continuously drop connection every 2 - 10 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,23,20,Maybe next time.
B00CYQPM42,23,21,No problems with it at all!!!
B00CYQPM42,23,22,At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem.
B00CYQPM42,23,23,I continuously have problems with my Kindle not hooking up to my wireless, which in turn makes it a pretty useless device.
B00CYQPM42,23,24,I have a slow internet connection, and only one option for a service provider.
B00CYQPM42,24,0,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,24,1,Very sensitive to the touch.
B00CYQPM42,24,2,The only thing I don't like is the keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,24,3,Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,24,4,Like HDX very much and wish a touch cover like keyboard case to make it more productive.
B00CYQPM42,24,5,I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times.
B00CYQPM42,24,6,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,24,7,My only complaint about this product is that it's way too sensitive to touch.
B00CYQPM42,24,8,The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,9,I would have given it 5 stars but some of the apps will flip upside down when I have the screen locked in one place.
B00CYQPM42,24,10,The tablet responds to touch the way an apple product would.
B00CYQPM42,24,11,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,12,For example, something like Surface touch cover.
B00CYQPM42,24,13,I have this unit for several weeks now and since then I have experienced a couple of slow down response and three "blue screens" although the unit is 40%, 80 % and 55 % charged, the first time it came back after 4 hours, the second and third time after several minutes.
B00CYQPM42,24,14,This is the second one that the freezing happens so I'm not sure if it's something mechanical or what the reason is for it freezing.
B00CYQPM42,24,15,Will need to find a way to change the keyboard layout.
B00CYQPM42,24,16,When using it, the screen will all of a sudden disappear.
B00CYQPM42,24,17,I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).
B00CYQPM42,24,18,Have origami case, works well, no issues.
B00CYQPM42,24,19,It's really frustrating.
B00CYQPM42,24,20,Got blue screen & lost data.
B00CYQPM42,24,21,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,24,22,It's more of an annoyance than a problem.
B00CYQPM42,24,23,Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app.
B00CYQPM42,24,24,I wish Amazon could come out some keyboard case for HDX.
B00CYQPM42,25,0,So it would have been obvious to just get the iPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,1,Much better than an Apple I-Pad!
B00CYQPM42,25,2,I also own a Samsung Note 8, several iPads and have several other tablets as well.
B00CYQPM42,25,3,Galaxy tab, Nexus, iPad, iPad mini).
B00CYQPM42,25,4,Much better than an iPad.3)
B00CYQPM42,25,5,My first was a Samsung Galaxy 7.5.
B00CYQPM42,25,6,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,25,7,Cheaper than an ipad mini with a better screen, this device is a no brainer.
B00CYQPM42,25,8,This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.
B00CYQPM42,25,9,I was looking at the Nexus 7 which is a little bit more in cost and also the iPad Air, and Samsung Galaxy Note.
B00CYQPM42,25,10,Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.
B00CYQPM42,25,11,I have used, recently, a Nexus 7 (2013) and an iPad Air.
B00CYQPM42,25,12,This thing is great!
B00CYQPM42,25,13,Automatic App Updates - This was recently something added to iPads as well, but it's a great feature.
B00CYQPM42,25,14,It took some time getting used to from android and ipad but I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested.
B00CYQPM42,25,15,It's not like comparing apples to oranges.
B00CYQPM42,25,16,Great Device, Better than expected.
B00CYQPM42,25,17,It also feels better in the hand then other tablets.As with all non-iOS products, it doesn't have all of the apps or usability that I'd like, but that will come with time.
B00CYQPM42,25,18,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,25,19,Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them.
B00CYQPM42,25,20,It is so FAST…compared to my android ASUS transformer tablet.
B00CYQPM42,25,21,;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.
B00CYQPM42,25,22,Although it's old tech now, one thing I love about Samsung products is they LAST.
B00CYQPM42,25,23,Just as good or even better than the Apple ipad.
B00CYQPM42,25,24,Both are priced at $229 vs. $399 for the new iPad Mini.
B00CYQPM42,26,0,Micro USB Connector - Bite it Apple!
B00CYQPM42,26,1,For the first time ever - a plug adapter is included!
B00CYQPM42,26,2,The USB port sticks out at an odd angle, making it difficult to plug in.
B00CYQPM42,26,3,Amazon is including a plug adapter so you can actually charge the device through a regular electrical outlet.
B00CYQPM42,26,4,I am able to use 3rd-party app stores to upload missing apps and outdated ones on the Amazon App Store, but still!2) USB Connection Port - The connection port on the device can be a bit of a nuisance.
B00CYQPM42,26,5,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,26,6,It's just very odd and makes charging annoying.2)
B00CYQPM42,26,7,My only complaint is the power/USB port is angled so when the cable is plugged in and the tablet is on the table, the cord does not lay flat.
B00CYQPM42,26,8,The product came with the standard usb/wall charger and nothing more, but you don't need anything else.
B00CYQPM42,26,9,Only thing that is really lacking is a USB port otherwise it is a great little product.
B00CYQPM42,26,10,You have to connect it at an angle on the device (around 30 degrees).
B00CYQPM42,26,11,I don't like that the charger is plugged in at an angle instead of straight on.
B00CYQPM42,26,12,Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away.
B00CYQPM42,26,13,I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.
B00CYQPM42,26,14,Each of my devices seems to fit a particular niche and I very much like them as well.
B00CYQPM42,26,15,For the same amount of use, I'm used to charging every 2 weeks or so instead of every 3-4 days.-
B00CYQPM42,26,16,The Lack of even a mini USB port.
B00CYQPM42,26,17,I also own a Samsung Note 8, several iPads and have several other tablets as well.
B00CYQPM42,26,18,Much better than an iPad.3)
B00CYQPM42,26,19,I think they are a great value and being backed by amazon means they will be supported for a long time.
B00CYQPM42,26,20,6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit.
B00CYQPM42,26,21,have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle.
B00CYQPM42,26,22,So much better, better than an Ipad....the only thing is, I would like if there was a light to let you know if it's fully charged, I miss that on it!
B00CYQPM42,26,23,I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.
B00CYQPM42,26,24,The battery life is ok, but not as good as my larger iPad by far.
B00CYQPM42,27,0,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,27,1,I bought this for my wife and have had it maybe month and everything stopped working can not even unlock screen when you reset it.
B00CYQPM42,27,2,You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on.
B00CYQPM42,27,3,I seem to learn something new each time I use it.
B00CYQPM42,27,4,I know in time I'll learn all about it.
B00CYQPM42,27,5,The only thing that takes some getting used to is the buttons and their location.
B00CYQPM42,27,6,But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,27,7,Maybe it is worse on some devices, but I had to really look to see it on mine.
B00CYQPM42,27,8,While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me.
B00CYQPM42,27,9,The device kept freezing.
B00CYQPM42,27,10,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,27,11,One of the first things I did in my settings was turn off letting things automatically detect where I am located.
B00CYQPM42,27,12,I got my wife a two year-old USED iPad, and it has worked flawlessly for a year in our possession, never freezing or requiring a hard reboot.
B00CYQPM42,27,13,The fact that you cannot customize anything is annoying beyond belief and there's and advertisement every time you turn it on or in lock it is ridiculous no I don't want to buy a dirt devil thank you.
B00CYQPM42,27,14,And when I say froze, i mean it became completely non-responsive for over an hour until i finally gave up and performed a hard reboot.
B00CYQPM42,27,15,He can manage to get around it just fine and we have the parental settings etc.  so it's good for the parents..
B00CYQPM42,27,16,Still learning all the tricks.
B00CYQPM42,27,17,She couldn't comprehend that I could not complete her troubleshooting checklist because the device was not working!
B00CYQPM42,27,18,Not sure still how to use everything yet, but I'll learn.
B00CYQPM42,27,19,So, I sent it back and got a replacement from Amazon.And then that replacement's display started flickering randomly.
B00CYQPM42,27,20,I eventually downloaded another calender system which , while not able to synch at least I was able to input data.
B00CYQPM42,27,21,This one just irked me one too many times with the return-replace-defective cycle.
B00CYQPM42,27,22,Once I learn all the tricks I  anticipate maximum use.
B00CYQPM42,27,23,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,27,24,There's still no GPS in the Wi-Fi HDX, although unless you have the 4G model (which includes GPS), it doesn't matter so much.
B00CYQPM42,28,0,poor support.
B00CYQPM42,28,1,I have contacted support about these problems.
B00CYQPM42,28,2,I even called customer service and they said there's was a problem with it.
B00CYQPM42,28,3,I am going to contact support again to see if they can help.
B00CYQPM42,28,4,Great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,28,5,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,28,6,I have never had a problem with Amazon in all the years that I have been their customer.
B00CYQPM42,28,7,The device is 5 months old...After contacting Amazon Kindle support a fourth time, someone finally helped me.
B00CYQPM42,28,8,I did have ro send for a repalcement because I had a problem with the firsrt one.
B00CYQPM42,28,9,It took a few days for a very supportive customer service chap from Ireland to sort out the problem.
B00CYQPM42,28,10,I called customer service AGAIN and asked if I was eligible for a refund and they told me that because this was a replacement device I could not have a refund.
B00CYQPM42,28,11,Great customer service!!
B00CYQPM42,28,12,Haven't needed help or support yet.
B00CYQPM42,28,13,Its a poorly developed product with poor customer service.
B00CYQPM42,28,14,I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support.
B00CYQPM42,28,15,Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept.
B00CYQPM42,28,16,Plus great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,28,17,Therefore, I am no longer receiving any more emails about this issue which means the problems are not fixed and now I don't know what to do about it.
B00CYQPM42,28,18,When I called customer service they were great (the reason that this go any stars) I received a replacement and I am having the same issues.
B00CYQPM42,28,19,i contacted customer service and it took them a week to send a canned email with instructions on how to load an email.
B00CYQPM42,28,20,I explained this to the tech advisors and they told me to send it back.
B00CYQPM42,28,21,This is something i also asked about when in called customer service and was told it was the kindle and my internet.
B00CYQPM42,28,22,So I contacted Amazon customer service and let me just say they really are as amazing as everyone says!
B00CYQPM42,28,23,I gave it one star because of the charging problems that Amazon wouldn't fix.
B00CYQPM42,28,24,Thanks for being there when I call!
B00CYQPM42,29,0,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,29,1,Just hanged up with the CS and they assure that is a software feature, and that can be fixed with a software update.
B00CYQPM42,29,2,However its overall usefulness overrides this annoying tendency.
B00CYQPM42,29,3,I first mis-read this for using Microsoft office.
B00CYQPM42,29,4,Why not just have it vertical or horizontal?
B00CYQPM42,29,5,It is okay, not as good as hyped.Pros:ResponsiveGreat pictureCons:FreezesCan't completely close applicationsSpeakers point backwards which is annoying since they are great, but you can't hear them and watch something at the same time.Overall:I am sending it back and getting a Windows Surface since there is more you can do with it.
B00CYQPM42,29,6,It's not a big deal, just annoying.
B00CYQPM42,29,7,If the app doesn't allow you to exit that way, then the developers never developed an exit button for their app.
B00CYQPM42,29,8,I would have given it 5 stars but some of the apps will flip upside down when I have the screen locked in one place.
B00CYQPM42,29,9,Big plus is that I can view my school power points and pdf files !
B00CYQPM42,29,10,It is REALLY hard to quit apps.
B00CYQPM42,29,11,Lastly I bought this to use almost as a portable laptop because I read you can VIEW Microsoft office documents.
B00CYQPM42,29,12,Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,29,13,Who pulls out a plug "diagonally" from a device, we usually pull vertically down, maybe side, maybe vertically up.
B00CYQPM42,29,14,I don't have any complaints or suggestions for future changes so far (except maybe to quit tempting me with new models for a while!).
B00CYQPM42,29,15,I am still trying to discover HOW to sync documents, if I finally get it done I would give this item 5 stars.
B00CYQPM42,29,16,I have also run into situations where I've had to reinstall apps for them to work properly again.
B00CYQPM42,29,17,Occasionally shuts off when I am in the middle of something.
B00CYQPM42,29,18,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,29,19,We decided to update the device and keep some background apps closed and see how it goes.
B00CYQPM42,29,20,For instance, I have run into a few occasions where it has crashed and restarted.
B00CYQPM42,29,21,Something's amiss here.What is going on with this, TILTED power plug/charger?
B00CYQPM42,29,22,My computer can only wish!
B00CYQPM42,29,23,Automatic App Updates - This was recently something added to iPads as well, but it's a great feature.
B00CYQPM42,29,24,Occasionally, rebooting got the browser back on track, but it was frustrating.
B007P4YAPK,0,0,I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire.
B007P4YAPK,0,1,Love the crisp display and the vibrant colors.
B007P4YAPK,0,2,had the same NEW model one and loved it tho.
B007P4YAPK,0,3,Back when I had the Kindle Fire, I'd have the brightness all the way down and it would STILL be too bright.-
B007P4YAPK,0,4,I bought this for my wife as an update from a first gen IPAD.
B007P4YAPK,0,5,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,0,6,I know someone that has one, and they LOVE it!
B007P4YAPK,0,7,i also love that i can alter the size of the font and the color background of my pages.
B007P4YAPK,0,8,i had balked at getting a tablet for a very long time as i love the feeling of having a real book, so the size matters to me.
B007P4YAPK,0,9,I've purchased five iPads over the years, starting with the very first generation and none had screen issues; neither did my Samsung Galaxy Tab.
B007P4YAPK,0,10,My sister has the New iPad and yes I can tell the difference in the screen.
B007P4YAPK,0,11,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,0,12,At first I was thinking I wouldn't be able to tell the difference... but I was wrong.This does not make me want to get the New iPad however, because I don't like the "Apple" way of doing things.
B007P4YAPK,0,13,Once again... yes the screen on this tablet is great, but yes there is a VISIBLE improvement on the New iPad.
B007P4YAPK,0,14,the size was a major factor for me - i wanted something that would rival the size of a "real" book and this is perfect.
B007P4YAPK,0,15,But comparing this to the iPad 2, why should I put up with this behavior?
B007P4YAPK,0,16,Honestly Android is just not there yet, but I see why people love it.So for me this didn't work out.
B007P4YAPK,0,17,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,0,18,Much better.
B007P4YAPK,0,19,The next best was the "blue" so I ordered it.
B007P4YAPK,0,20,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,0,21,I could not even finish reading a book with it.
B007P4YAPK,0,22,But people buy this rubbish and leave good reviews because they have not had an iPad in their hands.If you want a tablet get an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,0,23,Fast forward to three nights ago and now the small blotches in my screen are now very prominent throughout the display.
B007P4YAPK,0,24,Great battery life also
B007P4YAPK,1,0,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,1,1,For streaming videos from Youtube or Netflix it's not so good.
B007P4YAPK,1,2,So far mostly he has just used free games.
B007P4YAPK,1,3,I didn't have an opportunity to use it for the Amazon Prime Instant Videos before it stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,1,4,Cannot play Netflix movies on the tablet even though before I bought it I made sure everything said we could.2)
B007P4YAPK,1,5,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,1,6,The app store for Apple is way better.
B007P4YAPK,1,7,I bought this to stream Netflix and Amazon movies.
B007P4YAPK,1,8,The Google Play lets anyone upload an app and thus even though there are seems to be plenty to choose from, the tablet version of the apps are really stretched out phone apps.
B007P4YAPK,1,9,Another problem is app to app integration.
B007P4YAPK,1,10,My son likes to play games, that is his main use of the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,11,The apps loads fast.
B007P4YAPK,1,12,But if one is not in to gaming or if games you play does not require too much.
B007P4YAPK,1,13,I was used to my husband's iPad but once I set up my home screen and downloaded some apps, I was good to go.
B007P4YAPK,1,14,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B007P4YAPK,1,15,In Apple world we have millions of apps to choose from the App Store and those are mostly high quality apps.
B007P4YAPK,1,16,Once an app is running and in-focus, it runs fine.
B007P4YAPK,1,17,The only thing that I was disappointed about was the inability to stream videos except youtube.
B007P4YAPK,1,18,Netflix plays beautifully.
B007P4YAPK,1,19,I use it to read books, watch movies, listen to music, catch up on the news, play educational games, etc....
B007P4YAPK,1,20,Adobe flash player and shockwave not available so some movies, etc don't play.
B007P4YAPK,1,21,Even YouTube videos.
B007P4YAPK,1,22,It happened when the wife or kids were playing Mahjong, Smarf or fish tank games.
B007P4YAPK,1,23,I purchased it brandnew since the product first available on Amazone 8 months ago, it looks good ( not as good as Ipad) the touch screen sensitive is good and smooth , the quality so far so good... my kids use it to play games and watch youtube videos alot .
B007P4YAPK,1,24,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,2,0,Not good product.
B007P4YAPK,2,1,Worth buying.
B007P4YAPK,2,2,Good Product.
B007P4YAPK,2,3,ok for the money.
B007P4YAPK,2,4,Great tablet for the price.
B007P4YAPK,2,5,If you're looking for something comprehensive like the iPad I would recommend this.
B007P4YAPK,2,6,Good price.
B007P4YAPK,2,7,good product.
B007P4YAPK,2,8,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,2,9,not as good as the reviews.
B007P4YAPK,2,10,But its really good for the price!
B007P4YAPK,2,11,This is a good tablet for the price I paid for it.
B007P4YAPK,2,12,Not worth your money, time, or anything really.
B007P4YAPK,2,13,I would highly recommend not buying an Asus product.
B007P4YAPK,2,14,I would recommend buying something else.
B007P4YAPK,2,15,I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B007P4YAPK,2,16,My friend recommended it and I went along with the recommendation.
B007P4YAPK,2,17,It is a waste of money
B007P4YAPK,2,18,I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
B007P4YAPK,2,19,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,2,20,Product needs work.
B007P4YAPK,2,21,Do not purchase this product you may regret it in the end and could end up spending more then you think for this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,22,It was very, VERY much worth the money.
B007P4YAPK,2,23,I bought this in May and I waited until now to review this product so I know I have tried everything there is to it.
B007P4YAPK,2,24,Very good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,3,0,The battery lasts about 7 hours.
B007P4YAPK,3,1,Great battery life too.
B007P4YAPK,3,2,Great battery life also
B007P4YAPK,3,3,Powerful and has a good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,3,4,Battery life is around 7 hours for almost constant use.
B007P4YAPK,3,5,Battery life is poor - I have to recharge it all the time.
B007P4YAPK,3,6,If you see the battery symbol is low charge for 8 hours.
B007P4YAPK,3,7,Very good battery life; especially using the dock.5.
B007P4YAPK,3,8,This makes the battery last a maximum of an hour when you are trying to use the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,3,9,This tablet was used no more than two hours a day.
B007P4YAPK,3,10,See how long the battery lasts.
B007P4YAPK,3,11,The battery life is about average for a tablet.
B007P4YAPK,3,12,Good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,3,13,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,3,14,nice for it's time.
B007P4YAPK,3,15,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B007P4YAPK,3,16,I last about 2 days of heavy use.
B007P4YAPK,3,17,It does seem to charge fast though and hold a charge very well while the display is off.
B007P4YAPK,3,18,But like I said before, that is not needed because the battery is amply sufficient.
B007P4YAPK,3,19,Had it for 3 days and could not charge it.
B007P4YAPK,3,20,Color reproduction is excellent though.Battery life has generally been very good for me though it will not hold up great under gaming.
B007P4YAPK,3,21,The battery life is very impressive also.My only gripe with this is the screen.
B007P4YAPK,3,22,Battery life is above average, usually lasting a day and a half with moderate use.
B007P4YAPK,3,23,They are a photo junkie and just cannot get enough battery life.2.
B007P4YAPK,3,24,I usually get 2 days out of it before I charge it.
B007P4YAPK,4,0,Very good if you get good one.
B007P4YAPK,4,1,not good.
B007P4YAPK,4,2,Good tablet with sound issue.
B007P4YAPK,4,3,The tablet feels good itself.
B007P4YAPK,4,4,The build quality was much better, everything aligned and in place.
B007P4YAPK,4,5,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,4,6,The design is good and simplistic.
B007P4YAPK,4,7,Good enough but could be better!
B007P4YAPK,4,8,I like the build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,9,The design and build are both very good.
B007P4YAPK,4,10,The product build quality is not good as well.
B007P4YAPK,4,11,But on the other hand, it feels cheap.
B007P4YAPK,4,12,It is a good qualify tablet.
B007P4YAPK,4,13,Good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,4,14,But its really good for the price!
B007P4YAPK,4,15,Feels cheap.
B007P4YAPK,4,16,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,4,17,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,4,18,The design is nice and it feels pretty sturdy.
B007P4YAPK,4,19,Clearly there are quality issues with it!
B007P4YAPK,4,20,Very thin, and has a good grip feeling thanks to the textured back.
B007P4YAPK,4,21,On this, it's a hard plastic, and it creaks.
B007P4YAPK,4,22,Apart from needing more sound from the speakers, its a very good product.
B007P4YAPK,4,23,Good Product.
B007P4YAPK,4,24,It has cheap plastic feel to it because it has a cheap plastic screen instead of the glass like on iPad.
B007P4YAPK,5,0,Very Poor Screen Quality.
B007P4YAPK,5,1,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,2,camera is really sluggish but the quality is good in good light.
B007P4YAPK,5,3,I usually have the screen at 80-100%- I really like that the screen can actually get pretty dark.
B007P4YAPK,5,4,I have richer colors and much better picture quality on my cell phone.
B007P4YAPK,5,5,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B007P4YAPK,5,6,The screen is not as bright or brilliant as the TF700 or the iPad3, but to my 74 y/o eyes it looks pretty good until I go outside.
B007P4YAPK,5,7,I can't say how much I love this tablet it's fast quality device with one exception in that Skype video is the very bad!This is a software problem and so I am hopefull that it will be fixed.
B007P4YAPK,5,8,this tablet is great.
B007P4YAPK,5,9,Best tablet with one exception - SKYPE.
B007P4YAPK,5,10,I prefer warmer colors, but honestly, I can't really tell unless I had something to compare it to.CAMERA: 3.5/5- I haven't put the front-facing camera through its paces- The rear-facing camera is good for a tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,11,Some quick touch ups in an app, and the photo was pretty acceptable.-
B007P4YAPK,5,12,Was good until the touchscreen went bad.
B007P4YAPK,5,13,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,5,14,The front facing camera is clearly designed to be used in landscape mode.
B007P4YAPK,5,15,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,5,16,great but a some things wrong.
B007P4YAPK,5,17,I have got this tablet for a month and is happy about its versatility and performance except its camera.I brought it with me to Rome and used it to take photos and video.The pictures are bright and focused but the colors seem dull when compare with those taken from my Samsung galaxy smartphone.
B007P4YAPK,5,18,The only thing keeping me from rating the tablet 5 stars is the screen brightness.
B007P4YAPK,5,19,All in all it is a decent tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,20,Decent.
B007P4YAPK,5,21,I was very shocked with the poor screen quality and color depth.
B007P4YAPK,5,22,is great is the video rendering and playback.
B007P4YAPK,5,23,We found a really nice app that would do a fairly good job replacing Quicken, but we didn't want to have to start all over from scratch.
B007P4YAPK,5,24,it takes excellent pictures: beach wise, whc is very sunny or even in dark places like a church and sunset pix are pretty good,even the rainbow and the clouds  look amazing; i have no problems w/ all my Kindle books....i just love it
B007P4YAPK,6,0,Very nice for the price.
B007P4YAPK,6,1,What a great tablet for the $$$ Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,2,Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,3,I will take a nice fast PClaptop anyday over this.
B007P4YAPK,6,4,No touch screen, but with the speed diff, I will use it from now on.
B007P4YAPK,6,5,Not the best, but fast enough to be relevant in 2014 and with a decent display and great expandability.
B007P4YAPK,6,6,It's fast, smooth and very responsive, to my touch.
B007P4YAPK,6,7,5ghz dual band would be nice.
B007P4YAPK,6,8,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,6,9,It out performs most everything out there, has great graphics, and is well made.
B007P4YAPK,6,10,My iPad 2 is fast, reliable, great looking Apps, and very responsive to EVERYTHING.
B007P4YAPK,6,11,It is fast and the touch screen is accurate.
B007P4YAPK,6,12,Good but...
B007P4YAPK,6,13,I wanted one with quad core processor.
B007P4YAPK,6,14,Tegra-3 processor, 4 core.1G
B007P4YAPK,6,15,First off, this is a fast tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,16,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,6,17,Awesome Tablet for the price!
B007P4YAPK,6,18,Not good when one of the touted features is the display.
B007P4YAPK,6,19,Overall, for the price of this tablet, I don't think you can get any better!
B007P4YAPK,6,20,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,6,21,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,6,22,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,6,23,The tablet looked great, was responsive, and relatively easy to navigate.
B007P4YAPK,6,24,Especially if you are going to use their feature to have multiple accounts.The display is good but does not do gradients well.
B007P4YAPK,7,0,I added a 32 Gig micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,7,1,Plenty of storage space.
B007P4YAPK,7,2,HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6.
B007P4YAPK,7,3,Bought this tablet because the specs looked good and it had a micro SD card slot.
B007P4YAPK,7,4,I am ordering the micro SD card to boost additionally the speed and, of course, get more memory.
B007P4YAPK,7,5,Thus SD storage is not available during debugging.
B007P4YAPK,7,6,I also love the fact that I can add memory to it although I still have a lot of memory left on the pre-installed memory card.
B007P4YAPK,7,7,RAM is expandable via a microSD card which is also a big plus.
B007P4YAPK,7,8,Having said that, I added a Poetic Hardback case which added a lot of stiffness/rigidity to the tablet.I'm very happy with the TF300, screen quality is good, has hdmi out, expandable storage via micro sd card slot, and you can add a USB adapter (which I bought) for external storage.
B007P4YAPK,7,9,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,7,10,Still has full size  SDHC card slot on keyboard (yeah) and a Micro SDHC slot on the tablet  (big time yeah).
B007P4YAPK,7,11,The memory is 32gb, which is more then enough for most people.
B007P4YAPK,7,12,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,7,13,good product, but this model does not have sim card slot... builtin appliction for microsoft word editing is not impressive.
B007P4YAPK,7,14,I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts.
B007P4YAPK,7,15,For a tablet with the highest GB storage and the most recent android operating system these products are garbage and I would not recommend that anyone purchase them.
B007P4YAPK,7,16,The screen is beautiful and I love the expandable memory capability.
B007P4YAPK,7,17,Good value, better options available though.
B007P4YAPK,7,18,The product that i ordered was 32GB, but mine is 16GB.
B007P4YAPK,7,19,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,7,20,The included SD slot makes it very expandable and is something that Nexus devices will never have.
B007P4YAPK,7,21,My brother asked me to check how many GB my tablet is, and then i noticed that mine is 16GB not 32GB.
B007P4YAPK,7,22,The expandable memory on the ASUS is also very convenient.
B007P4YAPK,7,23,good product.
B007P4YAPK,7,24,In Apple world we have millions of apps to choose from the App Store and those are mostly high quality apps.
B007P4YAPK,8,0,Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,8,1,I like how easy it is to use.I use it more then my laptop.
B007P4YAPK,8,2,It fast, good for gamings and browsing.
B007P4YAPK,8,3,Its good for some things but not others.
B007P4YAPK,8,4,I wished that it worked better with all the Facebook games!
B007P4YAPK,8,5,This tablet is my first foray into mobile devices smaller than a laptop computer.
B007P4YAPK,8,6,it's faster then my laptop.
B007P4YAPK,8,7,I can do just about all things I usually do on my computer but most important of all I can travel anywhere and have access to most of the apps that I used.
B007P4YAPK,8,8,I like the size and use it instead of my laptop.
B007P4YAPK,8,9,When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.
B007P4YAPK,8,10,I'm not a big gamer just want to do basic email, web, and the occasional game or video.
B007P4YAPK,8,11,I have several desktop, laptop and netbook computers but this is my first tablet.
B007P4YAPK,8,12,But it works great with netflix, crunchyroll, xfinity, brighthousetv etc. so its nice for watching stuff while working out.
B007P4YAPK,8,13,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,8,14,If you are planning on using this tablet for games and other non work/school related things you dont have to search any farther.
B007P4YAPK,8,15,Great Tablet, Iffy browser.
B007P4YAPK,8,16,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,8,17,Very good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,8,18,I've watched movies while traveling on both this tablet and the iPad and notice very little difference.
B007P4YAPK,8,19,Her first computer.
B007P4YAPK,8,20,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,8,21,Great computer, until the power socket went bad.
B007P4YAPK,8,22,It is a small thing but it played a big part of my choice to look beyond the iPad.If you're looking for a device for reading only, this is waaaaaaaay more than you need.
B007P4YAPK,8,23,I prefer to just go back to my desktop if I really want to do some serious web browsing.
B007P4YAPK,8,24,I just wanted it to do email and browse the internet while on the road, and for that, this should do the trick.
B007P4YAPK,9,0,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,9,1,Something that I can use for leisure but then I can use it for school note taking or paper writing as well with the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,9,2,I do have a few art/photo editing apps.
B007P4YAPK,9,3,It makes writing with the tablet so much easier.
B007P4YAPK,9,4,It does better with touch.
B007P4YAPK,9,5,It always feels like I am trying to contort my hand to touch it, reaching over the keyboard, especially when it comes to touching the lower part of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,6,This is the best tablet hands down.
B007P4YAPK,9,7,Now, the SL101's keyboard is OK.
B007P4YAPK,9,8,Great for reading without the keyboard, and perfect for email and editing with the keyboard.Highly recommended.
B007P4YAPK,9,9,It feels very natural to reach from the keyboard to touching the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,10,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,11,Also, when you have the screen at the best angle it can get (pretty much all the way back), when you touch the screen it has a tendency to tilt back because of the very fine balance the keyboard and the screen have.
B007P4YAPK,9,12,I originally got it without the keyboard, but then got the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,9,13,You can maintain email access but be able to type much better than you would just off the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,14,Touching the screen tips the balance.
B007P4YAPK,9,15,I love the android slide touch keyboard that comes with it.
B007P4YAPK,9,16,It poops on the ipad.
B007P4YAPK,9,17,Google apps works well, and it is easy with the keyboard to deal with email.8.
B007P4YAPK,9,18,Screen seems pretty robust.
B007P4YAPK,9,19,I downloaded a swype like keyboard, like what my phone has, to make typing quicker.
B007P4YAPK,9,20,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,9,21,The angle and position is perfect for promoting the use of your finger to touch the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,22,Typing is a bit difficult while holding the TF300; I recommend downloading "Perfect Keyboard (Free)" because it comes with a "thumb" keyboard that splits the keyboard in half.PERFORMANCE 3/5:- Moving between homescreens is snappy, apps open quickly, and switching between open apps is pretty quick too- Polaris Office sometimes tells me that there isn't enough memory to run the application when it's the only app that's open.
B007P4YAPK,9,23,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,9,24,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,10,0,Otherwise I love it
B007P4YAPK,10,1,I love my tablet, once I got one that worked.
B007P4YAPK,10,2,Great.
B007P4YAPK,10,3,Great! Great product.
B007P4YAPK,10,4,Love it!
B007P4YAPK,10,5,What a great tablet for the $$$ Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,6,Great Right?
B007P4YAPK,10,7,Everything was great, but....
B007P4YAPK,10,8,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,10,9,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,10,10,Overall, I love this product.
B007P4YAPK,10,11,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,12,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,10,13,and was not even that great
B007P4YAPK,10,14,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,10,15,I absolutely love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,10,16,Though the tablet is a great product.
B007P4YAPK,10,17,I absolutely love this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,18,I just love my Asus!
B007P4YAPK,10,19,i love it.
B007P4YAPK,10,20,The tablet is great and the service was great.
B007P4YAPK,10,21,great tablet with some large setbacks.
B007P4YAPK,10,22,this tablet is great.
B007P4YAPK,10,23,Love it!
B007P4YAPK,10,24,Great, but... Asus TF300 is a great product, works perfect.
B007P4YAPK,11,0,It also gives me usb ports.
B007P4YAPK,11,1,Nice tablet.
B007P4YAPK,11,2,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,11,3,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,11,4,Not necessary if you get the keyboard, however, as the keyboard has a full sized usb port built in.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Just found out that standard USB chargers (of any amperage) do not charge this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,11,5,I would have liked to be able to use the keyboard from a distance, without it being connected to the tablet, which would have been nice considering the HDMI port.
B007P4YAPK,11,6,I use it mostly with the keyboard and portfolio stand case to give me keyboard capability, to extend the battery life.
B007P4YAPK,11,7,Came with keyboard that includes extra battery.
B007P4YAPK,11,8,Bought the Keyboard that only works on this asus product, bought a nice case, and bought a screen protector.
B007P4YAPK,11,9,Nice.
B007P4YAPK,11,10,I still prefer to be able to have additional power instead, but it would have been a nice feature to have bluetooth on the keyboard too.
B007P4YAPK,11,11,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,11,12,Using the provided transformer, the tablet and keyboard are recharged within a few hours.The keyboard has support for 1 USB port, which I did not try yet except to recharge my phone.
B007P4YAPK,11,13,I purchased the keyboard dock and a bluetooth mouse to accompany the TF300.
B007P4YAPK,11,14,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,11,15,Tablet felt nice and responsive; keyboard dock, unfortunately, broke the charging port.
B007P4YAPK,11,16,If you do get this make sure you get the dock and the case for it.
B007P4YAPK,11,17,If fitted with keyboard docking station, be careful not to let it tip over.
B007P4YAPK,11,18,great tablet with some large setbacks.
B007P4YAPK,11,19,Big, heavy, and likely to tip over if docking station attached.
B007P4YAPK,11,20,Now, the SL101's keyboard is OK.
B007P4YAPK,11,21,I am planning to get the optional keyboard dock, because the unit can function as a small laptop.
B007P4YAPK,11,22,Coupled with the keyboard dock it makes a pretty good laptop replacement.
B007P4YAPK,11,23,computer USB port or standard usb charger will not charge it.as
B007P4YAPK,11,24,The dock was a nice option.
B007P4YAPK,12,0,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,12,1,NO MORE ANDROID TABLET FOR ME.
B007P4YAPK,12,2,is Android 4.0 stable at all? was looking at ASUS TRansformer and Samsung Galaxy android 4 devices.
B007P4YAPK,12,3,Good .
B007P4YAPK,12,4,This is a really nice tablet with the up to date Android operating system and is easy to navigate.
B007P4YAPK,12,5,Interfaces just like my android phone.
B007P4YAPK,12,6,Great Android ICS Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,12,7,In Apple world the app asks the operating system to use something that requires permission and the operating system asks user to grant that permission.
B007P4YAPK,12,8,This product may be right for someone, but not me since the Android phone I currently have has the same features as this and I really do not need two devices so similar.
B007P4YAPK,12,9,I sent it back and got the Samsung Galaxy tab2.
B007P4YAPK,12,10,The Android OS isn't polished either.
B007P4YAPK,12,11,I know this review is about the Asus, but I want to say that I own 4 android tablet devices using various Android operating systems and user interfaces, and of those the best, easiest to use, most enjoyable combination is the one on the Amazon Fire.
B007P4YAPK,12,12,My phone is an android so I understood the basics of how to operate.
B007P4YAPK,12,13,Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) is excellent.
B007P4YAPK,12,14,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,12,15,When compared to other Android tablets, this one was supposed to be the best.
B007P4YAPK,12,16,I'm a big fan of android, and I own an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,12,17,when you have so many crash among different devices using same OS, it points to stability of OS.  is android 4.0 stable at all???  sorta makes me afraid to touch android device now...
B007P4YAPK,12,18,I ROMed this tablet with a Kitkat (android 4.4) ROM and it runs very very well now.
B007P4YAPK,12,19,You get a fast system, nice screen, the Ice Cream Sandwich with it.
B007P4YAPK,12,20,I'm a big Android fan.
B007P4YAPK,12,21,I would have liked to root the tablet, but a root exploit is only available for ICS on this device.
B007P4YAPK,12,22,Another Android Rubbish.
B007P4YAPK,12,23,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,12,24,3/4/2013:  Just installed the Android 4.2 update to this thing and it rocks!
B007P4YAPK,13,0,Incomplete product without a chord.
B007P4YAPK,13,1,The tablet was shipped USPS and was shipped on Tuesday.
B007P4YAPK,13,2,This is the first time I've had to return a product to Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,13,3,Product that i ordered is not the same i have.
B007P4YAPK,13,4,I will be returning this.
B007P4YAPK,13,5,I also paid for expedited 2 day shipping.I did NOT get 2 day expedited shipping.
B007P4YAPK,13,6,I didn't want to go the ipad route.
B007P4YAPK,13,7,Good product, had shipping issues.
B007P4YAPK,13,8,Though the tablet is a great product.
B007P4YAPK,13,9,Evidently I bought the tablet from "Amazon Wharehouse" which can not be returned after 30 days.
B007P4YAPK,13,10,I purchased this tablet along wit 3 other items.
B007P4YAPK,13,11,Defective product - would not buy again.
B007P4YAPK,13,12,Returned - Defective.
B007P4YAPK,13,13,A++++++ for amazon customer service!!
B007P4YAPK,13,14,I waitied until the end of the day, and called Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,13,15,Product needs work.
B007P4YAPK,13,16,Full Disclosure: I did not buy this product from Amazon, but from Staples.
B007P4YAPK,13,17,overall i am happy with my purchase, and with the costumer service from amazon.
B007P4YAPK,13,18,It was returned to ASUS under warranty.
B007P4YAPK,13,19,It took a few days for processing before items were shipped.
B007P4YAPK,13,20,So finally put it in the box it came and returned to Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,13,21,6 weeks later, the product was returned and it works for 1 month.
B007P4YAPK,13,22,This product worked just fine, for two days.
B007P4YAPK,13,23,It's very prominent, and it's a brand new product.
B007P4YAPK,13,24,New Product Ordered but refurb received.
B007P4YAPK,14,0,Some of the problem is probably Windows stuff but the Windows machines don't even see the tablet but the tablet sees the Windows machines.
B007P4YAPK,14,1,Very nice for the price.
B007P4YAPK,14,2,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,14,3,Very nice.
B007P4YAPK,14,4,It is easy to learn, but there are problems.
B007P4YAPK,14,5,Very good except for the screen scratch protection surface.
B007P4YAPK,14,6,Good hardware, shady software.
B007P4YAPK,14,7,good product.
B007P4YAPK,14,8,For what the tablet is designed for, it excels.The tablet even functions very well as a laptop replacement.
B007P4YAPK,14,9,The screen is beautiful.
B007P4YAPK,14,10,can not use this for office purposes.
B007P4YAPK,14,11,it's a pretty good product.
B007P4YAPK,14,12,Great hardware, buggy software.
B007P4YAPK,14,13,They give you a screen cleaner and you will use it quite a bit, every few days the screen needs a good wipe as the finger prints start to become very visible.
B007P4YAPK,14,14,While it is not a perfect laptop replacement (scrolling using the mouse or mousepad in particular takes a bit of getting used to and is subpar compared to a laptop), using the keyboard and mouse with the pre-installed office suite is simple, easy, and impressively powerful too.
B007P4YAPK,14,15,The machine runs things pretty well...once they get going.
B007P4YAPK,14,16,Problems, but nice overall.
B007P4YAPK,14,17,Whether this is a fault of the machine or the apps themselves, I cannot say.
B007P4YAPK,14,18,Unfortunately the screen tends to scratch in the way which is IMHO unacceptable as for mobile device!
B007P4YAPK,14,19,I love the android slide touch keyboard that comes with it.
B007P4YAPK,14,20,I do wish there were a more full-featured office program, as even the one I paid for-- Office Suite Pro-- still leaves a lot to be desired.
B007P4YAPK,14,21,This product may be right for someone, but not me since the Android phone I currently have has the same features as this and I really do not need two devices so similar.
B007P4YAPK,14,22,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,14,23,I prefer the flexibility of Android and I already have an Android phone so I decided to give this one a try.
B007P4YAPK,14,24,Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.
B007P4YAPK,15,0,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,15,1,The screen sensitivity is very good though.
B007P4YAPK,15,2,I can see the black color all over the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,3,You can tell the difference between the screen switched off and the black color in the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,4,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,15,5,When my screen is black, I notice some light bleed in a few of the corners, but it's nothing major and becomes unnoticeable when the screen is displaying colors other than black.
B007P4YAPK,15,6,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,15,7,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,8,There was also some light bleed on the edges of the screen, noticeable only when viewing dark images/video.
B007P4YAPK,15,9,Very Poor Screen Quality.
B007P4YAPK,15,10,I usually have the screen at 80-100%- I really like that the screen can actually get pretty dark.
B007P4YAPK,15,11,What a great tablet for the $$$ Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,15,12,The screen resolution isn't as good, but unless you're super picky there's not enough difference for it to matter.
B007P4YAPK,15,13,But about a month ago, I noticed small little blotches in my screen that are white to greyish in color, but are only visible when the screen is displaying deep blacks.
B007P4YAPK,15,14,The resolution is beautiful and the brightness is remarkable.
B007P4YAPK,15,15,Not noticeable when it's on, but unmistakable when the screen is dark.Otherwise, it's beautiful, light, functional and zippy.
B007P4YAPK,15,16,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,15,17,The screen resolution is very crisp indoors.
B007P4YAPK,15,18,Good visibility and good view angles.
B007P4YAPK,15,19,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,15,20,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,15,21,This is actually my second TF300 that has had issues with the display as the first tablet I bought had really bad problems with what looks like bad contrasts that caused my screen to make very distinct graduations between colors when they were gradually going from a black to white like a fading sensation.
B007P4YAPK,15,22,It was not a significant difference, but it is becoming hard to read under the sun vs. tf201 is nice and clear.
B007P4YAPK,15,23,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B007P4YAPK,15,24,The ASUS screen brightness was also a weak point, I had to take it out of the auto brightness mode and crank it up to get a decent brightness level even indoors, when placed next to the i-pad, the sharpness and the brightness weakness of the ASUS really stood out.
B007P4YAPK,16,0,When I end-task on some Apps, they relaunch at same state.
B007P4YAPK,16,1,There are many ugly Apps that do not work well.
B007P4YAPK,16,2,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,16,3,(Other android devices do with no problem).
B007P4YAPK,16,4,Another Android Rubbish.
B007P4YAPK,16,5,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,16,6,Apps open and closed themselves.
B007P4YAPK,16,7,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,16,8,(too late for the apps that are already installed on it by Asus).
B007P4YAPK,16,9,Adobe flash player and shockwave not available so some movies, etc don't play.
B007P4YAPK,16,10,Another problem is app to app integration.
B007P4YAPK,16,11,Certain apps don't work on the tab and alot of apps seem like they are still in the beta phase.
B007P4YAPK,16,12,Android tablets can't use all software.
B007P4YAPK,16,13,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,16,14,And I've had no problem finding apps on Google Play to fill all of my needs.
B007P4YAPK,16,15,it won`t download Adobe media player and some things need that to play on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,16,16,Apps, browser and native email program freeze up all the time, probably about 10-20% of the time.3.
B007P4YAPK,16,17,And there really is no dearth of tablet specific apps on Android, that's just a myth now.I have returned my device as of now but will be ordering another soon.
B007P4YAPK,16,18,Especially if you needed something that supports Flash.
B007P4YAPK,16,19,Apparently, you need to have an 'app' in order to do most everything, and apparently they think everyone uses google mail and has a google acccount.
B007P4YAPK,16,20,Great product only one issue, Adobe Flash says it is not supporting this version of android OS which makes viewing certain web pages not possible.
B007P4YAPK,16,21,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,16,22,However, the same problem happens with the default browser and Google Chrome.
B007P4YAPK,16,23,Then crash, and so I uninstall the app.
B007P4YAPK,16,24,In Apple world we have millions of apps to choose from the App Store and those are mostly high quality apps.
B007P4YAPK,17,0,What a waste of money, I could Just Puke!!!
B007P4YAPK,17,1,I bought this for my wife last week.
B007P4YAPK,17,2,I bought my Asus 6 months ago.
B007P4YAPK,17,3,Bought this for the wife and she really likes it.
B007P4YAPK,17,4,Please DO NOT waste your $.
B007P4YAPK,17,5,I wasted so much $ on this.
B007P4YAPK,17,6,My one year with the TF300T has been a very disappointing one.
B007P4YAPK,17,7,I bought this tablet for my son for his birthday and for the first 2 weeks it was perfect!
B007P4YAPK,17,8,Don't buy this junk!
B007P4YAPK,17,9,Evidently I bought the tablet from "Amazon Wharehouse" which can not be returned after 30 days.
B007P4YAPK,17,10,Great tablet for the first two months.
B007P4YAPK,17,11,I purchased this for my son's birthday 3 weeks ago.
B007P4YAPK,17,12,It died only 6 months after purchase KEEP AWAY FROM ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,17,13,I bought that tablet for my 8 years old son  to play games,  it freezes very often, my son has been keeping told me the "Tablet needs to see the doctor".
B007P4YAPK,17,14,I bought one of these on sale last week.
B007P4YAPK,17,15,Guess I should have bought an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,17,16,I bought this in May and I waited until now to review this product so I know I have tried everything there is to it.
B007P4YAPK,17,17,Bought this tablet in February.
B007P4YAPK,17,18,they doesn't return full money.
B007P4YAPK,17,19,I'm so, so disappointed.
B007P4YAPK,17,20,Defective product - would not buy again.
B007P4YAPK,17,21,He has been living there for few months and will only return to US in about a year from now.
B007P4YAPK,17,22,I bought this tablet in best buy and paid the full price for it when it first came out.
B007P4YAPK,17,23,I bought a ASUS t101 and loved it for the three weeks I had it.
B007P4YAPK,17,24,As this was a new model I waited to review - the tablet was great for the first two months - LOVED it!
B007P4YAPK,18,0,It would charge then stop charging in a contual cycle.
B007P4YAPK,18,1,I tried some temp fixes to try and get it charged again.
B007P4YAPK,18,2,WON'T CHARGE.
B007P4YAPK,18,3,Now I can't turn it on.
B007P4YAPK,18,4,Now the power doesn't seem to work.
B007P4YAPK,18,5,Power doesn't work...
B007P4YAPK,18,6,It worked for 4 days before it would not turn on.
B007P4YAPK,18,7,does not turn on.
B007P4YAPK,18,8,This time i couldn't turn it back on.
B007P4YAPK,18,9,My tablet would not charge from either charger, but both chargers work with her tablet.
B007P4YAPK,18,10,Had it for 3 days and could not charge it.
B007P4YAPK,18,11,Another charger is $30--will I have the same problen with that one?
B007P4YAPK,18,12,"52seconds on 100% battery charge.." really?
B007P4YAPK,18,13,I plugged it in and did not get the battery symbol.
B007P4YAPK,18,14,Sometimes the system says there is no battery after it was charging for several times.
B007P4YAPK,18,15,Only problems I have had with it is that it would not always turn on.
B007P4YAPK,18,16,It keeps turning off.
B007P4YAPK,18,17,Bad charger-seems to be a problem.... Tablet worked well until I tried to charge it after its first battery drain the first day of use.
B007P4YAPK,18,18,Though I returned it 4 days later.Reason: after a couple days of use and letting the battery die, the device would not charge.
B007P4YAPK,18,19,I have had this unit for a month plus 4 days and it will no longer charge.
B007P4YAPK,18,20,I usually get 2 days out of it before I charge it.
B007P4YAPK,18,21,Plugged into the wall and let it charge few hours.
B007P4YAPK,18,22,However, within about a month, it started turning itself completely off, and It started to get cumbersome turning it back on.
B007P4YAPK,18,23,If you see the battery symbol is low charge for 8 hours.
B007P4YAPK,18,24,When it plugged in, power button blinked twice.
B007P4YAPK,19,0,As for speakers, it only has one, on the right (or bottom) side.
B007P4YAPK,19,1,It should have a headphone jack.
B007P4YAPK,19,2,But I noticed the replacement has a different issue: a gap along the bezzel on the left side of the screen near the volume button.
B007P4YAPK,19,3,This means that watching a movie or playing a game in landscape (as they should be watched/played) meant that you only got sound out of one side, which doesn't sound like a big problem but it actually is really annoying really quickly considering that tablet speakers tend to be tinny sounding and aurally grating.
B007P4YAPK,19,4,It has surprisingly loud audio, but it lacks stereo output (either because there's just one speaker, or, if there are two speakers, they're too close together).
B007P4YAPK,19,5,The applications all downloaded easily and work well, I bought an external speaker to listen through the speakers on the tablet are fine.
B007P4YAPK,19,6,Quality control issue.
B007P4YAPK,19,7,When it plugged in, power button blinked twice.
B007P4YAPK,19,8,Somewhat related to the keys on the left side bottom.
B007P4YAPK,19,9,It's a little top heavy and having the speakers on the side is a little annoying but worth the price!
B007P4YAPK,19,10,Great! Great product.
B007P4YAPK,19,11,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,19,12,Imagine someone talking loudly into one ear, and you'll know what it was like to listen to this speaker at any useable volume.
B007P4YAPK,19,13,However, the TF300t speaker was particularly irritating because it was on the side of the tablet when held in landscape.
B007P4YAPK,19,14,What kind of quality is that?
B007P4YAPK,19,15,Its located on the top if your holding it in landscape mode.
B007P4YAPK,19,16,I bought this tablet in February of 2013 and it stopped working (no video, no audio) in June, 2014.
B007P4YAPK,19,17,Screen tearing issues.
B007P4YAPK,19,18,If I want louder I plug in headphones or connect some via bluetooth.Now on to the bad.
B007P4YAPK,19,19,Will never buy Asus again, seems like their quality control is horrible.
B007P4YAPK,19,20,The speakers are OK, but don't get very loud but they're acceptable.
B007P4YAPK,19,21,Bad video recording sound.
B007P4YAPK,19,22,When listening to audio/video in landscape mode it feels awkward because my right ear gets a higher volume than my left, but it isn't that big of a problem when in portrait mode.
B007P4YAPK,19,23,Another awkward thing they did with the build was put the mono speaker to the right when tablet is positioned in landscape mode.
B007P4YAPK,19,24,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,20,0,I have not tried the camera yet.
B007P4YAPK,20,1,Especially near the forward facing camera.
B007P4YAPK,20,2,This includes the front-facing camera as well.
B007P4YAPK,20,3,There is something about the camera in the TF201 with indoor light.
B007P4YAPK,20,4,My first unit had a defective camera with auto focusing problem.
B007P4YAPK,20,5,I'm so, so disappointed.
B007P4YAPK,20,6,The TF201 model, which has a well-known problem with WiFi and GPS signals, has a better working camera (8MP back camera), but the GPS signal on TF300 is still very poor compared to other tablets such as Samsung Galaxy 2 7.0in.
B007P4YAPK,20,7,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,20,8,Then I tried camera, wouldn't switch from  photo to video, error message " unfortunately camera stopped working" .....really?
B007P4YAPK,20,9,Cannot believe the lack of quality!
B007P4YAPK,20,10,The camera is decent quality, the image is grainy and when zoomed in the image is very jagged/razor-like.
B007P4YAPK,20,11,I was very disappointed.
B007P4YAPK,20,12,The camera has become completely useless.
B007P4YAPK,20,13,Very Poor Screen Quality.
B007P4YAPK,20,14,This was a big disappointment.
B007P4YAPK,20,15,i have not had occasion to use the camera other than to check out how it works.
B007P4YAPK,20,16,I am extremely disappointed.
B007P4YAPK,20,17,Best tablet with one exception - SKYPE.
B007P4YAPK,20,18,I have richer colors and much better picture quality on my cell phone.
B007P4YAPK,20,19,Not just because of Megapixels, but the image is less grainy.
B007P4YAPK,20,20,If it ever freezes which is usually caused by an app I just wait a few seconds and everything goes back to normal.Camera/Webcam- Both the camera and webcam are decent for this tablet; I was not expecting them to be head turning so no complaints here.-
B007P4YAPK,20,21,It was a toss-up between this and the ASUS Prime, with the metal case, but the Prime seems to have problems with the GPS and WiFi signal.
B007P4YAPK,20,22,The tablet is reasonably functional, but quality of construction is very poor, on top of spotty manufacturing process and failed quality control.
B007P4YAPK,20,23,I really can't point out the pros and cons at this point.
B007P4YAPK,20,24,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,21,0,Slow to load apps.
B007P4YAPK,21,1,The speed of the processor was a let down.
B007P4YAPK,21,2,Its ok if you use it just for that but dont expect this to do anything more.
B007P4YAPK,21,3,However, it is still slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,4,Just slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,5,I would expect it to do a lot and very fast but it hangs and is very slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,6,Too slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,7,Besides quad core the tablet is very slow in response.
B007P4YAPK,21,8,That is the same performance I expect from a tablet and this ASUS never has, not even when new.
B007P4YAPK,21,9,The apps loads fast.
B007P4YAPK,21,10,Is it too much to ask to be able to load pages at a speed greater than dialup?
B007P4YAPK,21,11,disappointed in the performance.
B007P4YAPK,21,12,While I was not expecting the same performance of the more expensive ipad, I never expected such a poor performing tablet as the asus 300tf.
B007P4YAPK,21,13,I have found that the touchscreen is not very responsive at times.
B007P4YAPK,21,14,Again, my hypothesis is slow read speeds.-
B007P4YAPK,21,15,tablet lags a lot.
B007P4YAPK,21,16,Asus, you've gotta get all that quad core processing to work with android better!
B007P4YAPK,21,17,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,21,18,It single handedly promotes slow boot up as well as weak app performance and slow sync.
B007P4YAPK,21,19,It does not shutdown like others have put it but I would not call it a highend quad core processor.
B007P4YAPK,21,20,I've always gathered that Asus was among the leaders in the Android tablet game, so I'm rather disappointed.
B007P4YAPK,21,21,update:  I find the speed of this product to be too slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,22,It's a little slow compared to my Samsung tab 2 7.0 and my Nexus 4 but I probably should have read up on the processor more.
B007P4YAPK,21,23,Has quad core processor, 1 GB RAM, and cannot handle any process intensive tasks.
B007P4YAPK,21,24,Really fast responses, a couple of app crashed here and there.
B007P4YAPK,22,0,I have no SD card installed.
B007P4YAPK,22,1,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,22,2,The included SD slot makes it very expandable and is something that Nexus devices will never have.
B007P4YAPK,22,3,I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts.
B007P4YAPK,22,4,I added a 32 Gig micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,22,5,Secondly the keyboard has an sd slot which lets you add an additional 32 gb of memory thereby making it a 96 gb tablet beating out both the ipad and the toshibas.
B007P4YAPK,22,6,first wifi direct connects but that is it, its not in the menu to transfer files and it does not accept incoming files this is a pain because wifi direct can transfer large files (music video) in seconds sometime quicker than USB.
B007P4YAPK,22,7,transferring larger files or folders from the micro sd card will fail a lot of times it just sits there with its little window open with nothing happening.
B007P4YAPK,22,8,Also, while I was trying to copy me music file to the tablet, several times, It shows a copy window but not copying.
B007P4YAPK,22,9,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,22,10,It treats SD cards like you're only swapping a bit of data and taking it out.
B007P4YAPK,22,11,The tablet has difficulty recognizing a microSD card when it is plugged in.
B007P4YAPK,22,12,And I've had no problem finding apps on Google Play to fill all of my needs.
B007P4YAPK,22,13,The prime does come in a 64 gig model but, i find that a 32 works just fine for me especially if you dont mind taking the time to swap out micro sd cards thus making the memory a moot point and i didnt feel like waiting on the toshiba(i like instant gratification).
B007P4YAPK,22,14,file system?
B007P4YAPK,22,15,I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable!
B007P4YAPK,22,16,Ram(some said it is 2G), 32G storage.
B007P4YAPK,22,17,I aim to leave the internal memory primarily for apps and app data - I'm sure it will take many years for me to even approach filling it up.Android 4 (ICS) is an absolute joy to use, much better than I anticipated.
B007P4YAPK,22,18,The tablet, itself, performed well but I prefer an OS that allows direct folder and file access.Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet first generation.
B007P4YAPK,22,19,In Apple world we have millions of apps to choose from the App Store and those are mostly high quality apps.
B007P4YAPK,22,20,Sometimes the tablet has to be booted multiple times to see the card, then can't see it after the tablet crashes.
B007P4YAPK,22,21,(not so sure, may due for my wrong operation)In it's file, there are some sample pictures and musics.
B007P4YAPK,22,22,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,22,23,RAM is expandable via a microSD card which is also a big plus.
B007P4YAPK,22,24,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B007P4YAPK,23,0,I haven't had any problems with it.
B007P4YAPK,23,1,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,23,2,He does state that if it connects to wifi there they would just send it back.
B007P4YAPK,23,3,The noted internet work around is to go in to settings > wifi > forget the network, the reenter the network password - volia 52 mbs (unfortunately you need to do this each time you suspend the device).
B007P4YAPK,23,4,It would not connect to the internet despite having a router connection.
B007P4YAPK,23,5,My only complaint with it is that its wireless doesn't seem to make as good of a connection as it should.
B007P4YAPK,23,6,Now, mind you that I have a wifi router 2 feet from me and a perfect wifi connection.
B007P4YAPK,23,7,The WiFi is slow, even though I have a high speed N network using a top-notch wireless router.
B007P4YAPK,23,8,I have a pretty strong wireless signal in my bedroom but this tablet seems to often drop the signal.
B007P4YAPK,23,9,Browsing the Internet crashes.
B007P4YAPK,23,10,Restarting the device fixed the problem temporarily.
B007P4YAPK,23,11,Too slow.
B007P4YAPK,23,12,Also when the tablet wakes up from suspend mode, the wifi connection speed is significantly less.
B007P4YAPK,23,13,Annoying problems.
B007P4YAPK,23,14,Except perhaps the toaster.This tablet crashes constantly.
B007P4YAPK,23,15,constant crashing.
B007P4YAPK,23,16,from day one I have had trouble with the device being a little slow and if I let things get backed up it'll crash.
B007P4YAPK,23,17,Generally the ASUS is ok, but it had a hard time picking up a strong wi-fi signal at home so the download was too slow and sometimes it would time out, while the i-pad had a full signal strength.
B007P4YAPK,23,18,After restarting the unit, telling it to forget the router then resetting the password, and even rebooting the router it still would not connect.
B007P4YAPK,23,19,Bad Wi-Fi Antenna.
B007P4YAPK,23,20,The one thing I have an issue with is the browser.
B007P4YAPK,23,21,(Other android devices do with no problem).
B007P4YAPK,23,22,And 2- even though the network is connected while sleeping (there's actually a setting for this), upon waking you have to wait for any updates to install before you can really use it for anything.Update 12\19 2013; I'm downgrading the network performance to poor/unacceptable.
B007P4YAPK,23,23,Searched internet and found out this is a major problem with other users.
B007P4YAPK,23,24,But you will still receive notifications and stay connected to wifi once screen is off.
B007P4YAPK,24,0,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,24,1,The screen immediately stopped reacting to touch.
B007P4YAPK,24,2,Cracked Screen.
B007P4YAPK,24,3,Touch screen didn't work!
B007P4YAPK,24,4,The on screen keyboard takes some getting used to.
B007P4YAPK,24,5,Screen Cracked while in Dock.
B007P4YAPK,24,6,And it wasn't touch responsive.
B007P4YAPK,24,7,There are several others who have had the cracked screen problem.
B007P4YAPK,24,8,The touch screen does not work correctly.
B007P4YAPK,24,9,Then touch screen started behaving crazy.
B007P4YAPK,24,10,Then touch screen started behaving crazy.
B007P4YAPK,24,11,There was also a dot on screen that followed were you'd touch., which I thought wasn't normal.
B007P4YAPK,24,12,Constantly Freezes, touch screen stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,24,13,The machine screen shakes for over 30 seconds at times.
B007P4YAPK,24,14,Kept getting touches not registering, and phantom touches registering where I wasn't touching.They sent the same unit back with the same problems.
B007P4YAPK,24,15,I did what they said and it worked, but then only two weeks later the screen stopped responding again.
B007P4YAPK,24,16,The touch screen stopped responding but for awhile I could dock it to the keyboard and it would respond.
B007P4YAPK,24,17,Now the touch screen is useless.....useless.
B007P4YAPK,24,18,ASUS TF 300 touch screen quit after 5 weeks.
B007P4YAPK,24,19,This tablet was great ... for a month, then the touch screen became unresponsive for no apparent reason.
B007P4YAPK,24,20,Issue with Touchscreen.
B007P4YAPK,24,21,Back in mid-July I was on the couch using the tablet (without the keyboard) when the touch screen just stopped responding.
B007P4YAPK,24,22,Problem is....even if I am not even touching that area it is now doing it.
B007P4YAPK,24,23,My tablet have an screen failure.
B007P4YAPK,24,24,Screen Failure.
B007P4YAPK,25,0,At first I was thinking I wouldn't be able to tell the difference... but I was wrong.This does not make me want to get the New iPad however, because I don't like the "Apple" way of doing things.
B007P4YAPK,25,1,I don't want a $600 device.
B007P4YAPK,25,2,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,25,3,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,25,4,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,25,5,But comparing this to the iPad 2, why should I put up with this behavior?
B007P4YAPK,25,6,This one is apples to oranges.
B007P4YAPK,25,7,Give me the simplicity and functionality of an Android device like this any day.
B007P4YAPK,25,8,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,25,9,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,25,10,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,25,11,(Other android devices do with no problem).
B007P4YAPK,25,12,Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,25,13,I purchased the Asus tablet as a reasonable-priced iPad.
B007P4YAPK,25,14,But people buy this rubbish and leave good reviews because they have not had an iPad in their hands.If you want a tablet get an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,25,15,AND the screen is slightly larger than on an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,25,16,Good enough but could be better!
B007P4YAPK,25,17,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,25,18,My 2 year old Samsung Galaxy S I now feels like a Ferrari compared to this product.
B007P4YAPK,25,19,I've purchased five iPads over the years, starting with the very first generation and none had screen issues; neither did my Samsung Galaxy Tab.
B007P4YAPK,25,20,Hopefully this will change since there are so many great Android products out now.
B007P4YAPK,25,21,I've used an iPad before and have owned an iPhone since it was released.
B007P4YAPK,25,22,In Apple world we have millions of apps to choose from the App Store and those are mostly high quality apps.
B007P4YAPK,25,23,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,25,24,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,26,0,It also gives me usb ports.
B007P4YAPK,26,1,computer USB port or standard usb charger will not charge it.as
B007P4YAPK,26,2,I don't like the propriety plug, and the no USB port.
B007P4YAPK,26,3,The tablet did not have POWER and so put the charger cable on.The table did not charge.
B007P4YAPK,26,4,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,26,5,So i had to buy another cable.
B007P4YAPK,26,6,That cable that comes with it can get power from an ordinary USB port, but the amount of power would be so low it would take the whole day to recharge from a standard USB.
B007P4YAPK,26,7,This tablet requires the ASUS-only 15 volt adapter in the wall to charge.
B007P4YAPK,26,8,I never tried to see if the old keyboard would work on the new one...the new one is a bit different...has one USB port instead of two (negative).
B007P4YAPK,26,9,Plugging in a micro hdmi cord was a little difficult due to this, and I am sure the port would break off if i did it often.
B007P4YAPK,26,10,Also, you pretty much have to use the tablet upside-down when the adapter or the power cord is connected.
B007P4YAPK,26,11,Be aware that when you are charging the keyboard, the tablet won't always charge to 100%.
B007P4YAPK,26,12,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,26,13,I have the USB adapter but its not great.
B007P4YAPK,26,14,In the end, I decided that the USB adapter and this tablet would suffice.
B007P4YAPK,26,15,Then my HDMI port got a short.
B007P4YAPK,26,16,You may want to charge them separately.
B007P4YAPK,26,17,This means that you cannot effectively charge this tablet via any method except the wall wart, and I imagine you shouldn't use the wall wart with any other device.
B007P4YAPK,26,18,Issues with charger cable - loose fit.
B007P4YAPK,26,19,Using the provided transformer, the tablet and keyboard are recharged within a few hours.The keyboard has support for 1 USB port, which I did not try yet except to recharge my phone.
B007P4YAPK,26,20,I bought my 1st TF300t through TigerDirect.Com only to return it after 2 days of use.Reason: would not recognize the device via the usb cable connected to a computer (I tried 4 computers I happen to have an extra usb cable which wasn't the problem)I bought my 2nd TF300t through Amazon.Com.
B007P4YAPK,26,21,However, if you feel you have to do it, that cable plugs into the tablet, to recharge as you use it.
B007P4YAPK,26,22,Almost all other chargers use the USB standard 5 volts (including iPad or Nexus 7).
B007P4YAPK,26,23,I had to separately order a power supply chord because without the chord I can only use it until it ran out of power.
B007P4YAPK,26,24,The USB connection to my PC allows me to read this tablet like a hard drive.
B007P4YAPK,27,0,That's only 16 months of use.
B007P4YAPK,27,1,Am just getting into the modern world and this is something I have to learn.. perhaps the things I dislike are fixable when I find out how to do it.
B007P4YAPK,27,2,Don't Buy - screen cracked while "swiping" to unlock screen.
B007P4YAPK,27,3,Once I turned it back on, it was fine and it never happened again.It had a GPS, but the only time it would show me my location was when I would connected to a Wifi signal.
B007P4YAPK,27,4,Cannot be reset  or fixed.
B007P4YAPK,27,5,I wiped the tablet and reset it to factory settings.
B007P4YAPK,27,6,I had to go on line and find out how to operate it for the most part.
B007P4YAPK,27,7,DOA  the screen never work.
B007P4YAPK,27,8,It gets stuck in a permanent "starting wifi" state.
B007P4YAPK,27,9,did not see issues related to bleeding screen, system resets, etc.However, occasionally, sound will be muted/gone.
B007P4YAPK,27,10,Not long after I got it, it started to give me problems.
B007P4YAPK,27,11,defective screen on mine.
B007P4YAPK,27,12,I tried to "factory reset" and "cool boot" it and it is still has the same issue.
B007P4YAPK,27,13,Sometimes when the device has been asleep, or freshly booted wifi refuses to turn on.
B007P4YAPK,27,14,It would finally come on but it would show the welcome screen and boot up as if I did a restart, but obviously I didn't.
B007P4YAPK,27,15,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,27,16,During that time she complained it did not register her screen touches in the right location.
B007P4YAPK,27,17,Without even installing any apps the system started constantly freezing.
B007P4YAPK,27,18,GPS locking is OK.
B007P4YAPK,27,19,I liked it and bought another only to have it start doing the same thing on and off and no I was not Hacked.
B007P4YAPK,27,20,Reboot by itself and doesn't want to turn on again.
B007P4YAPK,27,21,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,27,22,However, within about a month, it started turning itself completely off, and It started to get cumbersome turning it back on.
B007P4YAPK,27,23,Sometimes takes about 4-5min to lock down the location.-
B007P4YAPK,27,24,Pros: Average tablet - similar to most android tablets.Cons: Wow, when swiping the screen to unlock the device, the screen cracked!
B007P4YAPK,28,0,I contacted ASUS customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,1,No warranty or support.
B007P4YAPK,28,2,Got it back, but had other problems.
B007P4YAPK,28,3,They have no incentive to provide any actual customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,4,He said tech support was very backlogged.
B007P4YAPK,28,5,Asus Tf 300.
B007P4YAPK,28,6,ASUS contracts out to some company in Jamaica for its support.
B007P4YAPK,28,7,so I called ASUS support by phone.
B007P4YAPK,28,8,I called customer support and they were no help.
B007P4YAPK,28,9,I was assured that my tablet was still under warranty and that I could send it in for assessment and possible repair.
B007P4YAPK,28,10,It took about 3 weeks until the tablet returned and about one week later the problem returned.I sent it to ASUS repair again, and it was returned about 3 weeks later.
B007P4YAPK,28,11,A++++++ for amazon customer service!!
B007P4YAPK,28,12,This is the first time I've had to return a product to Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,28,13,Poor customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,14,I received the tablet and a few days later had problems with it.
B007P4YAPK,28,15,Touchsreen problems within 10 days.
B007P4YAPK,28,16,That's Asus!
B007P4YAPK,28,17,But this one, no, no, no!UPDATE: I got back from Asus.
B007P4YAPK,28,18,Asus does not repair them.
B007P4YAPK,28,19,Disappointing Customer Service.
B007P4YAPK,28,20,I have not called customer service yet as I keep hoping they will fix these issues with another update.
B007P4YAPK,28,21,According to them ASUS is not doing anything to fix the problem.
B007P4YAPK,28,22,Asus TF201.
B007P4YAPK,28,23,Sent them an email regarding the issue.
B007P4YAPK,28,24,I had problems with the tablet freezing and I called tech support several times.
B007P4YAPK,29,0,Unfortunately, the two main business software applications I planned to use require a Windows OS.
B007P4YAPK,29,1,You'd think it was a Microsoft OS the way it crashes so much.
B007P4YAPK,29,2,Other times, I need to click, click, click click click.
B007P4YAPK,29,3,However, after the OS get updated by JellyBean, my tablet starts to shut down (reboot) by itself.
B007P4YAPK,29,4,Some of the problem is probably Windows stuff but the Windows machines don't even see the tablet but the tablet sees the Windows machines.
B007P4YAPK,29,5,I've also seen it scroll across 2 or more screens when I only want to scroll across 1, or just completely drop scrolling actions.
B007P4YAPK,29,6,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,29,7,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,29,8,Cold reboot is the only way to close all the Apps completely.
B007P4YAPK,29,9,After ANOTHER update the tablet started skipping...it would pull up random games even though you didn't even click on that game!!I have tried numerous things to fix it and NOTHING works.
B007P4YAPK,29,10,Sometimes i'm forced to use my little finger.
B007P4YAPK,29,11,In order to click the view all apps button I have to flip the screen because horizontally with the "ASUS" logo right side up it will not respond to me pressing it.
B007P4YAPK,29,12,Asus just downloaded a firmware update tonight so lets see if that fixes anything.7/7/12:
B007P4YAPK,29,13,I am not too sure if it is a problem on the design or due from the software, since I upgrade my tablets once it come to me.
B007P4YAPK,29,14,You have to hunt the settings to find that you can switch to the default android keyboard that works properly.Looser Experience:The first thing the tablet did after booting up it found it's firmware update, it updated itself.
B007P4YAPK,29,15,Time to wait for the Surface to release.
B007P4YAPK,29,16,A few other times the screen wouldn't turn back on even though I'm pushing the power button multiple times.
B007P4YAPK,29,17,Upgrading android helped, as now android pop-us a zoomed window when clicking on buttons and links in the web browsers.However, after the upgrade we have a new problem.
B007P4YAPK,29,18,This time i couldn't turn it back on.
B007P4YAPK,29,19,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,29,20,The Android OS is not quite up with the user interfaces we would expect with Microsoft Office or Apple products.
B007P4YAPK,29,21,After 3 weeks, several crashes, random shut downs & reboots, coupled with several reviews about how delicate the screen is, I decided to return it.
B007P4YAPK,29,22,However the lag and app failures were too much for me.
B007P4YAPK,29,23,They do not immediately start scrolling when touched like on safari, there is a slight annoying delay, and when you zoom in and out, there is rendering lag.
B007P4YAPK,29,24,For example, I have had many problems with it having programs and applications stop working, or I have had times where I am unable to select things on it.
