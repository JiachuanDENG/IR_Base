B0074FGLUM,0,10,It would also be a good TV for a bedroom.
B0074FGLUM,0,11,Good, but not great.
B0074FGLUM,0,12,Also with the weaker off angle on this set it is needed to direct to the screen to the viewing area.
B0074FGLUM,0,13,I wish the screen swiveled for perfect viewing from any point in the room.
B0074FGLUM,0,14,the colors are very poor especially when viewed from one side not front.download

B0074FGLUM,1,23,A great TV.
B0074FGLUM,1,24,I researched and saw that Samsung was the bomb.com
B0074FGLUM,2,0,The sound on this TV was unbearable!
B0074FGLUM,2,1,And the sound.
B0074FGLUM,2,2,Sound quality.
B0074FGLUM,2,3,This TV has a good picture and good sound quality.

B0074FGLUM,2,14,Great sound quality3.)
B0074FGLUM,2,15,Sound quality is poor.
B0074FGLUM,2,16,If you have a sound system or are in the midst of getting one, do so.
B0074FGLUM,2,17,Aside from that It's got great sound and picture quality!
B0074FGLUM,2,18,I have tried all the various sound settings to now avail.
B0074FGLUM,2,19,Need to add a sound bar if you like fuller sound.
B0074FGLUM,2,20,The picture quality is great and sound is better than I expected.However
B0074FGLUM,2,21,The speakers on this tv aren't good at all.
B0074FGLUM,2,22,Great picture, terrible sound quality.
B0074FGLUM,2,23,The picture quality is good, not great.
B0074FGLUM,2,24,Horrible Sound.
B0074FGLUM,3,0,This is being going around since past 15 days.
B0074FGLUM,3,1,Arrived Smashed.
B0074FGLUM,3,2,This after waiting 3 days after order date.
B0074FGLUM,3,3,But we will think twice before buying anything from amazon.
B0074FGLUM,3,4,Will never buy a TV from Amazon.
B0074FGLUM,3,5,no amazon still.
B0074FGLUM,3,6,Received SHATTERED.
B0074FGLUM,3,7,I received this TV well within time of delivery.
B0074FGLUM,3,8,I'm going to give it a few more days, but I may end up returning it.
B0074FGLUM,3,9,Ordered twice - both damaged.
B0074FGLUM,3,10,Package arrive undamaged.
B0074FGLUM,3,11,Late shipping delivery for a broken tv that I must now ship back and the deal for the tv is now over.
B0074FGLUM,3,12,before I ordered and received the goods at the time and was pleased.
B0074FGLUM,3,13,TV RETURNED.
B0074FGLUM,3,14,This Item was not available for free pick up service or return shipping.
B0074FGLUM,3,15,So I returned it to Amazon.
B0074FGLUM,3,16,I had been waiting 4 days for a call I was never going to receive.
B0074FGLUM,3,17,Now i have to wait another week for someone to come out and service it.
B0074FGLUM,3,18,The TV may be a good TV - I don't know but Amazon service is TERRIBLE!
B0074FGLUM,3,19,I requested a return via Amazon and they complied.
B0074FGLUM,3,20,NEVER ORDER TV'S FROM AMAZON ONLINE!!
B0074FGLUM,3,21,As the box and TV came damaged.
B0074FGLUM,3,22,Box and TV came damaged.
B0074FGLUM,3,23,Product arrived damaged.
B0074FGLUM,3,24,u shud give it a try and buy it off amazon if u dnt like it just return it.
B0074FGLUM,4,0,It's great but...
B0074FGLUM,4,1,And I like the color and its features.
B0074FGLUM,4,2,It's like watching a bright animation.
B0074FGLUM,4,3,Overall, the contrast is mess-ed up and even in its best movie mode, it is still over enhanced.The only good thing about this TV is its black level.
B0074FGLUM,4,4,Samsung colors are animation bright.
B0074FGLUM,4,5,After receiving the set and setting it up, I quickly noticed that the motion wasn't as smooth as my Vizio 120Hz set.
B0074FGLUM,4,6,The definition of the screen is great along with bright colors.
B0074FGLUM,4,7,Also this is a 60Hz set with 1080p.
B0074FGLUM,4,8,I found there to be enough settings to make the adjustments that were needed.
B0074FGLUM,4,9,This TV is great at displaying TV shows, movies, and all that.
B0074FGLUM,4,10,The "dynamic" picture mode is over-enhanced.
B0074FGLUM,4,11,Movies look great as well as fast paced football.
B0074FGLUM,4,12,It had perfect synergy with our Samsung Blu-Ray player where all the settings we automatically set and the picture was perfect when watching Blu-Rays.
B0074FGLUM,4,13,Out 32 Samsung did and we need this feature so everyone can see the set.
B0074FGLUM,4,14,The Picture Quality is below my expectation.
B0074FGLUM,4,15,The same for "natural" mode.
B0074FGLUM,4,16,Not the best for sports.
B0074FGLUM,4,17,Great picture, great sound, great value.
B0074FGLUM,4,18,The refresh rate for this TV is 60hz I was told by a crutchfield salesman that a 120hz rate is better so I sent this TV back and am trying a 120hz refresh rated TV.
B0074FGLUM,4,19,The picture on this set is really good as long as you turn the sharpness setting to 0. I use this mostly for games and watching Netflix and for those purposes it is awesome and has a good response time.
B0074FGLUM,4,20,After doing some research, we ended up with this model because we read that a 120Hz+ refresh rate doesn't add value unless you're using the TV to play video games.
B0074FGLUM,4,21,I am not so sure if it is the 60 Hz refreshing speed (the standard nowadays seem to be 120 HZ) that is not fast enough to watch sports, high speed chases, people getting hurt in senseless action movies etc  but this TV does not seem to refresh as fast as you needed.
B0074FGLUM,4,22,May not work as well as a PC monitor for Mac as you would expect!
B0074FGLUM,4,23,Colors and settings are a personal choice and some might light the all the settings on and the picture really bright.
B0074FGLUM,4,24,Even with the AVSforum picture settings, the color is off and objects appear blurred around the edges.
B0074FGLUM,5,0,Good tv.
B0074FGLUM,5,1,far no it's all good.
B0074FGLUM,5,2,Great for tje price.
B0074FGLUM,5,3,Price is good.
B0074FGLUM,5,4,Not great, but good
B0074FGLUM,5,5,The picture quality is good, not great.
B0074FGLUM,5,6,It's a good TV, but the picture quality is not a good as my other Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,5,7,pictures good... Its a Samsung so good picture quality as usual.
B0074FGLUM,5,8,Picture quality is good.
B0074FGLUM,5,9,This was a great buy!!
B0074FGLUM,5,10,Not a great one, but a good one.
B0074FGLUM,5,11,Great TV Good Price.
B0074FGLUM,5,12,like this - good price.
B0074FGLUM,5,13,It was and is great.
B0074FGLUM,5,14,Good but not great.
B0074FGLUM,5,15,Poor quality.
B0074FGLUM,5,16,Good TV.
B0074FGLUM,5,17,Good TV for the price.
B0074FGLUM,5,18,Very good for the price.
B0074FGLUM,5,19,The TV is great for a low-priced smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,5,20,Picture quality is good though.
B0074FGLUM,5,21,Picture quality is very good.
B0074FGLUM,5,22,For a TV I always praise Samsung for the picture quality and this is the same!
B0074FGLUM,5,23,good product, but possibly not new.
B0074FGLUM,5,24,Not so great picture quality, though.
B0074FGLUM,6,0,Please fix the apps!
B0074FGLUM,6,1,Then both of the apps stopped working.
B0074FGLUM,6,2,And the apps work very well.
B0074FGLUM,6,3,Amazon app for my video's is not working well.
B0074FGLUM,6,4,Great tv.
B0074FGLUM,6,5,Work.
B0074FGLUM,6,6,great picture and tv works well
B0074FGLUM,6,7,The TV works and looks great.
B0074FGLUM,6,8,It already has all the most popular apps embedded in it (i.e.
B0074FGLUM,6,9,You can watch movies with netflix without any prob.
B0074FGLUM,6,10,All the APPS work as expected and the picture is very good.
B0074FGLUM,6,11,Some of the Apps cannot be uninstalled, as they are part of# the Apps lineup.##
B0074FGLUM,6,12,really good, not quite great.
B0074FGLUM,6,13,works with amazon prime - great picture - limited apps.
B0074FGLUM,6,14,He loves to watch games out there while he works out.
B0074FGLUM,6,15,Great picture, the apps are slow.
B0074FGLUM,6,16,Works like a charm.-
B0074FGLUM,6,17,Smart tv apps and Internet work great.
B0074FGLUM,6,18,Works great.
B0074FGLUM,6,19,We are also pleased with the apps that came with it.
B0074FGLUM,6,20,Otherwise great TV and just what i needed.
B0074FGLUM,6,21,It works great as a tv.
B0074FGLUM,6,22,Half the apps I've tried so far don't work very well.
B0074FGLUM,6,23,The apps were good.
B0074FGLUM,6,24,WATCH OUT FOR MISSING PARTS.
B0074FGLUM,7,0,Do away with cable!!
B0074FGLUM,7,1,We use the TV for our cable.
B0074FGLUM,7,2,The HDMI connection with only work with Samsung DVD players, Samsung computers, etc. and will not work for devices using the HDMI cable everyone else in the industry uses.
B0074FGLUM,7,3,Great picture, works right out of the box.
B0074FGLUM,7,4,So all you see after you hook it up are the HDMI cables looping trying to get behind the TV.
B0074FGLUM,7,5,My DVD I connected with an AV cable I had but could not get it to work.
B0074FGLUM,7,6,I use it as a Monitor but wi-fi...
B0074FGLUM,7,7,The sound is not the best but connected to sound on computer it works just fine.
B0074FGLUM,7,8,This TV has a good picture and good sound quality.
B0074FGLUM,7,9,Transmitter connects to PC,receiver connects to TV.
B0074FGLUM,7,10,I have a wii and an old dvd player so I can only hook up one.
B0074FGLUM,7,11,Overall good.
B0074FGLUM,7,12,Nice HDTV but out of the box it needs work.
B0074FGLUM,7,13,When we first set this TV up, it worked fine.
B0074FGLUM,7,14,HD picture doesn't look good,  may be I missed some setup.
B0074FGLUM,7,15,This one only has hdmi and 1 a/v.
B0074FGLUM,7,16,The HD is good on this tv.
B0074FGLUM,7,17,Haven't tried yet.As a regular TV itself works good.
B0074FGLUM,7,18,Great picture, great sound, great value.
B0074FGLUM,7,19,It's not because of internet connection.
B0074FGLUM,7,20,TV Did not connect to my wireless.
B0074FGLUM,7,21,The WI-FI also works great.
B0074FGLUM,7,22,I like the picture quality and the remote features, but after setting it up and connecting it to our antenna the reception has been poor, especially on local channels.
B0074FGLUM,7,23,Instead one can go for a HD tv and all these can be streamed fron DVD players or any other game devices.
B0074FGLUM,7,24,My Cable box also has such a remote.
B0074FGLUM,8,0,The tv screen is already showing issues.
B0074FGLUM,8,1,The screen was black and red, with white spiderweb-like lines all over the plasma screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,2,Now there is a 1/4 diameter black circle on the bottom edge of the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,3,Light in image goes dark and light sometimes.
B0074FGLUM,8,4,Dead pixel.
B0074FGLUM,8,5,I looked at it, and noticed that the screen had been shattered at the top and had spread across half the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,6,went black on the 29th day.
B0074FGLUM,8,7,Smashed screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,8,Sometimes the screen goes completely black.
B0074FGLUM,8,9,The Samsung screen is just "glossier".
B0074FGLUM,8,10,3 months later I have dead pixels and dark lines across the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,11,I purchased this TV in September of 2013 and last week the screen went black.
B0074FGLUM,8,12,The lighting is mostly even, but there is noticeably dimming in the corners of the set.
B0074FGLUM,8,13,screen dead after one week.
B0074FGLUM,8,14,Also the screen has a 3 inch blotch at the bottom that is visible when viewing dark scenes.
B0074FGLUM,8,15,A large circular space of the screen (top left) and corner of the screen (top right) was totally WHITE.
B0074FGLUM,8,16,The Sony screen seemed to absorb light instead of reflecting it.
B0074FGLUM,8,17,The TV screen is totally shattered!!!!!
B0074FGLUM,8,18,The lights are directly behind the screen (i.e.
B0074FGLUM,8,19,Another issue is that the TV makes a humming noise, which I've noticed tends to be loudest when a very bright image is on the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,20,i got it set up and then started watching tv, then i started to notice something the sound comes and goes.
B0074FGLUM,8,21,Damaged Screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,22,But a few days later, it just wouldn't quit power recyling itself -- screen goes blank, power light goes off, then it tries to power on again, you see the splash screen but never get a picture, shuts off and tries to power on again with no success.
B0074FGLUM,8,23,had to return it because dead pictel in center of screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,24,The picture is coming in black and white only.
B0074FGLUM,9,0,I only used it for 5 months.
B0074FGLUM,9,1,DO  NOT BUY.
B0074FGLUM,9,2,Don't buy.
B0074FGLUM,9,3,Only works until right after warranty is out... 1 year, 2 months.
B0074FGLUM,9,4,I purchased this TV just a year and a few months ago and the power is out.
B0074FGLUM,9,5,My Samsung TV quit working just after 1 year.
B0074FGLUM,9,6,After 6 months of use Samsung UN40EH5300 stopped working!!
B0074FGLUM,9,7,ONLY A MONTH AND HAVING PROBLEMS.
B0074FGLUM,9,8,Now 2 years later - same problem.
B0074FGLUM,9,9,$1200 and it will not last 2 years.
B0074FGLUM,9,10,Now, however, nothing seems to work.
B0074FGLUM,9,11,Stopped working.
B0074FGLUM,9,12,Don't buy- turns off & on.
B0074FGLUM,9,13,After a month or so, the TV went into a power recycling loop.
B0074FGLUM,9,14,After 6 months the TV malfunction, started to turn on and off by it self.
B0074FGLUM,9,15,this tv doses not work in Australia.
B0074FGLUM,9,16,Should have gone with my first instinct and purchased a Panasonic which I will know do.
B0074FGLUM,9,17,I purchased this TV and used it for about a month before returning it.
B0074FGLUM,9,18,TV was great up until two months in.
B0074FGLUM,9,19,No problems with this tv after having it near a month.
B0074FGLUM,9,20,Samsung was really nasty to me about it saying it is out of warranty.
B0074FGLUM,9,21,This is the second Samsung TV to fail within a year of purchase.
B0074FGLUM,9,22,I will never buy this Samsung TV again all buy anything from themThey didn't tell us it dose not work in AustraliaBefore we got itAll its good for is the rubbish tipYou think they would of told us now I have to buy a new t
B0074FGLUM,9,23,Failed after 1 month.
B0074FGLUM,9,24,I won't be buying Samsung again any time soon.**UpdateTV
B0074FGLUM,10,0,Audio problems.
B0074FGLUM,10,1,Cannot control external speaker volume.
B0074FGLUM,10,2,The only problem is the speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,3,The TV has an external speaker connection.
B0074FGLUM,10,4,The problem is that the volume control of the TV does not control the output of the external speaker.
B0074FGLUM,10,5,Problems with Speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,6,It is hard to plug in, especially if you have the TV wall mounted.
B0074FGLUM,10,7,It is not reinforced along the backbone with bends to keep it from being susceptible to vibrations from the *speaker ports* and wall mounts caused by the lower mounted speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,8,The only way to use a headphone is the Audio out jack on the back of the TV.
B0074FGLUM,10,9,The volume variation is one issue.
B0074FGLUM,10,10,That's a bug.Another issue is connections to an external speaker.
B0074FGLUM,10,11,It has 1 set of inputs component/composite video and L/R audio.  1 audio output jack and 1 optical audio output.
B0074FGLUM,10,12,I purchased external speakers and connected them to the analog speaker output on the back of the TV.
B0074FGLUM,10,13,So I have no way of muting my external speakers as they are just speakers, they are not a audio receiver unit with a separate remote control.
B0074FGLUM,10,14,Using add-on speakers means volume control on remote does not work.
B0074FGLUM,10,15,Sound is an issue.
B0074FGLUM,10,16,This TV does not have a headphone jack on the television.Major deficiency.
B0074FGLUM,10,17,I have it mounted on the wall in my bedroom and it was a snap to set it up out of the box.
B0074FGLUM,10,18,You have to turn the sound up super-high to hear voices.
B0074FGLUM,10,19,40 years owning tv's and I have never had the cable connector snap off of a tv set and yes 3 tv's in my home are on a pivotal wall mount.
B0074FGLUM,10,20,Perhaps get some extra speakers if audio is important for you.
B0074FGLUM,10,21,This improved the sound quality greatly, but I discovered that the volume can't be controlled from the TV when using the external speaker jack.
B0074FGLUM,10,22,Anyway, because of this problem alone, I wouldn't buy another one.
B0074FGLUM,10,23,But we have had a problem with the sound on both monitors.
B0074FGLUM,10,24,This TV does not have a headphone jack on the television.
B0074FGLUM,11,0,What has happened to SAMSUNG?
B0074FGLUM,11,1,Samsung Customer Service.
B0074FGLUM,11,2,Samsung customer service is anything but service.
B0074FGLUM,11,3,Nothing happened so I called again.
B0074FGLUM,11,4,KNOWN PROBLEM! (BUT) Samsung fixed it!
B0074FGLUM,11,5,I called Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,11,6,Samsung "Customer Service" is no help, so you are on your own.
B0074FGLUM,11,7,I called Samsung and they outsource their tech support to somewhere in China.
B0074FGLUM,11,8,update: Called Samsung service.
B0074FGLUM,11,9,I researched and saw that Samsung was the bomb.com
B0074FGLUM,11,10,But nothing samsung support couldn't fix.
B0074FGLUM,11,11,Dont get a samsung tv !!!
B0074FGLUM,11,12,Very poor customer support lines.
B0074FGLUM,11,13,32" Samsung TV.
B0074FGLUM,11,14,I went through a month of calls to Samsung, called Netflix, called my ISP.
B0074FGLUM,11,15,Samsung customer tech said they don't have such a tv.
B0074FGLUM,11,16,Samsung support is so s***ty to work with, they don't do squat to hep me.
B0074FGLUM,11,17,I've called support many times.

B0074FGLUM,11,19,Well you betcha I have problems.
B0074FGLUM,11,20,Had a couple of problems with this TV and called Samsung for help.
B0074FGLUM,11,21,Samsung was really nasty to me about it saying it is out of warranty.
B0074FGLUM,11,22,I know the TV needed a hardware fix and Samsung should've sent someone out to service it, but I could not get any help from their Customer Service.
B0074FGLUM,11,23,Samsung customer service could not resolve this.
B0074FGLUM,11,24,So I called Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,12,0,Was easy to set up.
B0074FGLUM,12,1,Once I used these settings picture was great.
B0074FGLUM,12,2,So far so good.
B0074FGLUM,12,3,So Far so good.
B0074FGLUM,12,4,Good TV.

B0074FGLUM,12,12,I have yet to really adjust the picture settings to my liking but so far, the picture quality and even the sound is great.
B0074FGLUM,12,13,Set up was easy.
B0074FGLUM,12,14,Nope, I don't like it at all, and really don't have much good to say about this TV!
B0074FGLUM,12,15,Overall it is good for the price.
B0074FGLUM,12,16,Good TV at a great price.
B0074FGLUM,12,17,not a great image.
B0074FGLUM,12,18,Great TV and picture after you get the settings right.
B0074FGLUM,12,19,great picture sound not great.

B0074FGLUM,13,0,review.
B0074FGLUM,13,1,Review of this TV.
B0074FGLUM,13,2,I will never buy anothey Samsung product and AMAZON  should have a disclaimer with tis information before anyone buys a Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,13,3,I read many other reviews with the same issue.
B0074FGLUM,13,4,New Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,13,5,I purchased this TV because of other peoples reviews.
B0074FGLUM,13,6,yes read the bad reviews it really helps.
B0074FGLUM,13,7,Don't think I will ever buy another Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,13,8,Review for Samsung UN32EH5300 smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,13,9,I read the reviews of this T.V. and also did some research out of Amazon before I made a buying decision.
B0074FGLUM,13,10,I read other reviews about this model but was hoping I wouldn't experience the same issue.
B0074FGLUM,13,11,I just don't get it... Well i just don't get it..I have got to stop buying tv's based on reviews.
B0074FGLUM,13,12,Update to previous review.
B0074FGLUM,13,13,But Samsung skimped on the remote so it's getting 3 stars.
B0074FGLUM,13,14,Don't buy any Samsung TV's.
B0074FGLUM,13,15,Amazon listed the actual dimensions but I didn't read them.
B0074FGLUM,13,16,I didn't want to try another Samsung, after reading the reviews on this website, I saw that many others have had the same complaint.
B0074FGLUM,13,17,I own 3 other Samsung TVs with no issues.
B0074FGLUM,13,18,Previous Samsung TVs I have owned have had much heavier stands.
B0074FGLUM,13,19,DO NOT BUY THIS TV; BUYER BEWARE.
B0074FGLUM,13,20,After this beyond irritating product I will no longer buy any Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,13,21,I should have read product description carefully.
B0074FGLUM,13,22,I recently purchased this TV based on the reviews it got on Amazons site.
B0074FGLUM,13,23,I tend to trust amazon reviews, The reviews of this TV  are so great &  almost all reviewers thank Gordon (a gentle user with a magic potion that helped us to set the T.V right) so  I was inclined to buy it.
B0074FGLUM,13,24,If and when Sling does make their product work with the smart TVs I will certainly purchase again.
B0074FGLUM,14,0,not Smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,1,Not smart at all.
B0074FGLUM,14,2,smart tv???
B0074FGLUM,14,3,not very smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,4,not so smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,5,Not Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,6,Smart TV vs Chromcast.
B0074FGLUM,14,7,It is not smart at all.
B0074FGLUM,14,8,SMART TV is not really SMART.
B0074FGLUM,14,9,For trying to be a smart TV, it's only 3-stars "smart."
B0074FGLUM,14,10,But the "smart" part is really a toy.
B0074FGLUM,14,11,It is not smart enough yet.
B0074FGLUM,14,12,Smart TV isn't.
B0074FGLUM,14,13,Not very smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,14,Go back to the Smart TV menu.7.
B0074FGLUM,14,15,samsung smart tv not so smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,16,We can not say it is a smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,17,I  still use my chromcast for netflix since its quicker but I use the tv's other apps happily.
B0074FGLUM,14,18,I've tried using the Smart apps and what not.
B0074FGLUM,14,19,Smart seems to be a misnomer.
B0074FGLUM,14,20,Smart?
B0074FGLUM,14,21,Smart TV my ass!
B0074FGLUM,14,22,I am only using the Netflix app with this TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,23,Netflix app works by the way.
B0074FGLUM,14,24,The Netflix App had a picture of HBO2Go instead.
B0074FGLUM,15,0,Remote is still old traditional remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,1,The TV comes with a "remote controller or wand".
B0074FGLUM,15,2,My Cable box also has such a remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,3,All HDMI ports don't work.
B0074FGLUM,15,4,No universal remote?????
B0074FGLUM,15,5,So all you see after you hook it up are the HDMI cables looping trying to get behind the TV.
B0074FGLUM,15,6,This set does not have any control buttons on the actual unit.
B0074FGLUM,15,7,This means another remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,8,Very hard to type using this remote.I like the LG TV remotes.
B0074FGLUM,15,9,It also only has 1 set of component in port.
B0074FGLUM,15,10,It comes with 3 HDMI ports, and a few USB ports.
B0074FGLUM,15,11,HDMI ports plus a component input.-Price
B0074FGLUM,15,12,It has 3 HDMI inputs.
B0074FGLUM,15,13,The HDMI connection with only work with Samsung DVD players, Samsung computers, etc. and will not work for devices using the HDMI cable everyone else in the industry uses.
B0074FGLUM,15,14,It includes 3 HDMI ports. 1 HDMI port also has an audio port for using with a computer with DVI to HDMI adapter.
B0074FGLUM,15,15,AnyNet+ is nice because I can change the input to my PlayStation 3 with the TV remote, and it will change the input on my Onkyo receiver and turn the PS3 on, and let me control the PS3 with the TV remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,16,I can't believe that this TV doesn't come with a universal remote to control the cable box and other accessories.
B0074FGLUM,15,17,Disappointed in remote control controls could be more intuitive.
B0074FGLUM,15,18,Only one button on the TV itself, one button press turns on, but once the unit is on the button brings up a menu and you have to move the button around to navigate this menu.
B0074FGLUM,15,19,Once in the app I am able to use the remote to change channels up and down and directly via the numberpad.
B0074FGLUM,15,20,AT TIMES DOES NOT POWER ONI really like this TV.
B0074FGLUM,15,21,AT TIMES DOES NOT POWER ON.
B0074FGLUM,15,22,As it's a 'smart' TV, why don't you put a small keyboard on remote control?
B0074FGLUM,15,23,It doesn't have an S-VHS port for my old (but cherished) S-VHS video player.
B0074FGLUM,15,24,There are three HDMI ports, although there is no S-Video port.
B00BCGROJG,0,0,This is the brightest and clearest viewing screen that you will ever view.
B00BCGROJG,0,1,A great value.
B00BCGROJG,0,2,Great TV for the Living Room.
B00BCGROJG,0,3,It looks great In our conference room.
B00BCGROJG,0,4,I mean if you want a good TV with a nice screen get it!!!
B00BCGROJG,0,5,In our living room there are off angle seats and you can tell the blacks are not as dark off angle.
B00BCGROJG,0,6,This set fits exactly—and I mean, to the millimeter exactly—in our viewing space.
B00BCGROJG,0,7,Perfect for our needs.
B00BCGROJG,0,8,Brightness is better and washed when viewing at an angle.Other than the viewing angle, the TV is a good buy at $2K.
B00BCGROJG,0,9,Perfect TV.
B00BCGROJG,0,10,The picture is still good, just not as great as when you are in front of it.
B00BCGROJG,0,11,This Smart TV is the perfect size for our new studio room.
B00BCGROJG,0,12,The trade off though, is my plasma has burn in, and didn't look as good as this tv in a bright living room.
B00BCGROJG,0,13,Great picture when viewing from straight on.
B00BCGROJG,0,14,The screen size is perfect for someone that likes movies.
B00BCGROJG,0,15,Love the Big Screen!
B00BCGROJG,0,16,The viewing area is very large and looks like it almost runs off onto the wall.
B00BCGROJG,0,17,But if you sit about 45 degrees, the color setting is out of wack.
B00BCGROJG,0,18,Perfect size, great picture and a smart TV too.
B00BCGROJG,0,19,Great smart TV IN BRIGHT room .
B00BCGROJG,0,20,I think because it's 3D they gave it a nice strong black light and 10 is about where normal viewing should be.
B00BCGROJG,0,21,Great Picture But..... Great picture with amazing contrast and color "pop" but.....the viewing angles are not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,0,22,I must say I love this TV, we have never watched so much TV in our living room.
B00BCGROJG,0,23,Great bright picture, this tv is in our family room and the tv has no problem in a room with light.2.
B00BCGROJG,0,24,Great but LED wash out from side.
B00BCGROJG,1,0,Great tv
B00BCGROJG,1,1,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,2,Great tv at a great price.
B00BCGROJG,1,3,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,4,Word cannot say what a great picture this TV has.
B00BCGROJG,1,5,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,6,The best tv for the price.
B00BCGROJG,1,7,3D TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,8,Last Samsung purchase.
B00BCGROJG,1,9,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,1,10,Love this tv.
B00BCGROJG,1,11,Overall, we love it.
B00BCGROJG,1,12,love it!
B00BCGROJG,1,13,love it!
B00BCGROJG,1,14,Samsung TV purchased.
B00BCGROJG,1,15,We've always loved Samsung and love this TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,16,I love it.
B00BCGROJG,1,17,Love the tv.
B00BCGROJG,1,18,But it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,1,19,We tried the 3D, but never really got too into it, but it does come with 4 Samsung 3D glasses.
B00BCGROJG,1,20,None of the Sonys we liked were available (2012 models); then, we saw this Samsung for a very good price and decided to buy.
B00BCGROJG,1,21,Samsung TV, so good.
B00BCGROJG,1,22,Everyone would commend on how great the picture is.
B00BCGROJG,1,23,This is probably the best TV I've bought ever.
B00BCGROJG,1,24,Best tv ever.
B00BCGROJG,2,0,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,1,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,2,2,The sound is not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,2,3,Clear picture, and great sound even without sound system.
B00BCGROJG,2,4,Sound quality is good too.
B00BCGROJG,2,5,Before someone tells me that I shouldn't use tv speakers and should instead use a surround sound system, I get that.
B00BCGROJG,2,6,TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,2,7,Overall picture quality is very good.
B00BCGROJG,2,8,The sound is good, but I'm going to get some speakers for a better audio experience.
B00BCGROJG,2,9,The sound is acceptable, but an external sound system is really necessary for sound immersion.
B00BCGROJG,2,10,Awesome... Except sound everything is great.
B00BCGROJG,2,11,Great picture, sound, etc....HIGHLY recommend!
B00BCGROJG,2,12,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,2,13,This is a great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,14,I mean really, how great do you think the sound would be on a TV this slim.
B00BCGROJG,2,15,Picture quality is excellent.
B00BCGROJG,2,16,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,2,17,Sound is OK and the TV has a few different sound settings but nothing special.
B00BCGROJG,2,18,Sound seems comparable to others but who doesn't expect to have a sound system of comparable value connected eventually?
B00BCGROJG,2,19,The sound is MUCH better than I expected for a flat screen.
B00BCGROJG,2,20,Everything is good.
B00BCGROJG,2,21,The sound quality without any extra help like a Surround system attached to it , was good enough for a room; however, if you would like to experience a full home theater drill, I suggest a Surround System.
B00BCGROJG,2,22,The picture is still good, just not as great as when you are in front of it.
B00BCGROJG,2,23,Amazing picture quality, 3d picture is better than going to a movie theatre.Great TV for the price.
B00BCGROJG,2,24,Buy It! Great TV!
B00BCGROJG,3,0,There went another $20 on Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,1,quick delivery.
B00BCGROJG,3,2,By then I can set up a delivery date that works for me.
B00BCGROJG,3,3,I was very skeptical about ordering a tv through Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,4,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,3,5,Tried AMAZON ..4 days later, tv in house lookin' great.
B00BCGROJG,3,6,I have had tremendous success with Samsung and Amazon's service has always been good to me.
B00BCGROJG,3,7,Plus, the Amazon service was A+, as usual.
B00BCGROJG,3,8,It doesn't necessarily need to be returned in the same package it was delivered in.
B00BCGROJG,3,9,Received it in two days.
B00BCGROJG,3,10,The TV shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,11,I ordered it through Amazon, and had a delivery scheduled.
B00BCGROJG,3,12,I WILL NEVER ORDER A BIG ITEM ON AMAZON AGAIN.
B00BCGROJG,3,13,Amazon delivery was on time and TV arrived in PERFECT condition.
B00BCGROJG,3,14,No damage to the outside box and no damage to the actual TV box.
B00BCGROJG,3,15,I received my TV in 2 days with free shipping.
B00BCGROJG,3,16,My first big Amazon purchase and it was a success!
B00BCGROJG,3,17,TV great, customer service not so much.
B00BCGROJG,3,18,Delivery went unhitched also - a first!
B00BCGROJG,3,19,Thanks Amazon!
B00BCGROJG,3,20,Order this tv thru Amazon warehouse for $400 off the price because the original box was damaged.
B00BCGROJG,3,21,it works.
B00BCGROJG,3,22,This tv is amazing, the delivery was great!!
B00BCGROJG,3,23,A few days went by but no email arrived.
B00BCGROJG,3,24,This is the e-mail i received from Amazon with NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER!Because the TV was defective, we'll pay for the return shipping costs.
B00BCGROJG,4,0,10 is more than enough with this set.
B00BCGROJG,4,1,The truth about this set.
B00BCGROJG,4,2,Great TV, but be alerted...
B00BCGROJG,4,3,It was like a whole new movie!
B00BCGROJG,4,4,great for watching sports, movies and gaming
B00BCGROJG,4,5,The blu-ray movie I watched was Despicable me, if you have watched this movie before you would know the cute little minions.
B00BCGROJG,4,6,All I want to do now is watch something on this TV!
B00BCGROJG,4,7,But once he did get the settings right...the picture is amazing.
B00BCGROJG,4,8,Amazing tv, especially for video games!
B00BCGROJG,4,9,Great picture quality... leakage of blacks.. First of all.
B00BCGROJG,4,10,Great 3D TV.
B00BCGROJG,4,11,I will look into it and I am sure that I can re-adjust a setting to fix this issue.
B00BCGROJG,4,12,The picture is great and the 3D worked fine with my one 3D Bluray movie Gravity.
B00BCGROJG,4,13,Resolution looks amazing, especially while playing video games and watching HD (I wouldn't buy this TV if I didn't have these two).
B00BCGROJG,4,14,This thing is great so far, excellent picture in both 2D and 3D although I have only use the 3D to watch Dredd(2013) I do not own a lot of 3D films.
B00BCGROJG,4,15,Great for watching sports can't believe the clarity.
B00BCGROJG,4,16,I haven't played much with color, saturation and other settings but Blu-ray movies look awesome in the 'Natural' setting.
B00BCGROJG,4,17,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,4,18,The 3d is amazing and glorious at the same time.
B00BCGROJG,4,19,3D was great.
B00BCGROJG,4,20,There are many, many settings that affect brightness, many settings that affect color balance, etc... so even the last few settings will make a big difference to how the picture looks.
B00BCGROJG,4,21,there seem to be many options for tweaking the setting for actual picture quality but only few for refresh rates and the like.
B00BCGROJG,4,22,It will turn anything your watching be it a movie or live tv into 3d!
B00BCGROJG,4,23,Kind of like "colorizing" old B&W; classic movies on TNT.
B00BCGROJG,4,24,Great TVs make everything you watch look better.
B00BCGROJG,5,0,Very Good TV.
B00BCGROJG,5,1,Great picture.

B00BCGROJG,6,7,Works great on just WIFI.
B00BCGROJG,6,8,3D does work, watched few 3D movies from Netflix.
B00BCGROJG,6,9,Great picture.
B00BCGROJG,6,10,I came along at least a very good thing.
B00BCGROJG,6,11,That seems to work.I love to watch my sports, specifically hockey and with the Stanley Cup Playoffs currently playing, to me it is like watching it Live- Awesome picture.
B00BCGROJG,6,12,So far so good....
B00BCGROJG,6,13,Love it!
B00BCGROJG,6,14,Great Smart TV.
B00BCGROJG,6,15,Good things come in without a problem like this.

B00BCGROJG,6,17,Have been enjoying watching TV.
B00BCGROJG,6,18,Can't wait to watch a 3D movie.
B00BCGROJG,6,19,Can watch all my favorite movies with Netflix and show all our pictures on the big screen.
B00BCGROJG,6,20,The apps are great and works well, only draw back is with remote.
B00BCGROJG,6,21,Nearly all Apps are free.
B00BCGROJG,6,22,Smart TV...is great.
B00BCGROJG,6,23,Love my new tv, the resolution is great and the sound is also great, the only thing would be that i wish i could use google play
B00BCGROJG,6,24,Great picture.
B00BCGROJG,7,0,Great Picture on HD Channels.
B00BCGROJG,7,1,I've only watched cable tv so far (via the cable box and HDMI), but I've seen the Samsung GUI and it looks amazing, so I'll be trying that as soon as the tv is connected to the internet.
B00BCGROJG,7,2,very good TV great picture.
B00BCGROJG,7,3,I connected them with HDMI cables, while hooking sound system with optical cable directly to TV.
B00BCGROJG,7,4,The HDMI to cable box connection assures a great out of the box picture.
B00BCGROJG,7,5,This Tv is a Great value.
B00BCGROJG,7,6,Works great on just WIFI.
B00BCGROJG,7,7,TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,7,8,Overall picture quality is very good.
B00BCGROJG,7,9,Sound quality is good too.
B00BCGROJG,7,10,Was plug and play right out of the box.
B00BCGROJG,7,11,By 9:20 the TV was set up and on the first of its set-up screens.
B00BCGROJG,7,12,The picture is amazingly clear and perfect on the HD channels.
B00BCGROJG,7,13,I have home theater system, cable box and DVD and BRay.
B00BCGROJG,7,14,A Samsung salesperson sold us on this TV claiming that it will substituting for operating the cable box as long as it is connected to the cable box.
B00BCGROJG,7,15,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,7,16,The sound is not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,7,17,I would rate it between 4 to 5 stars and here's why.After a few hours of playing with the picture settings and advanced settings, using a Time Warner cable box with HDMI connection, the picture is spectacular for 95% of the HD content.
B00BCGROJG,7,18,Amazing... Amazing, 3D images are excellent.Integration with Samsung sound bar and blue ray player effortless.
B00BCGROJG,7,19,Anyway great picture perfect for any type viewing habit whether basic cable, VOD,  blue ray or gaming.There are 4 HDMI connections inputs I do not think most people will be disappointed with this HDTV specs,or features.
B00BCGROJG,7,20,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,7,21,Looking to play 3D Blu-ray on my new OPPO Player I purchased from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,7,22,Great price.
B00BCGROJG,7,23,Beautiful picture and we have connected it to our surround sound system and Samsung Blu Ray player!
B00BCGROJG,7,24,SO FAR SO GOOD.
B00BCGROJG,8,0,3 out of 3 screens had a dead pixel.
B00BCGROJG,8,1,When he saw the screen he said they should not be this bad and I got a bad panel.
B00BCGROJG,8,2,Again, 4 red stuck pixels on the screen, and some pinkish hue to only the right side of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,3,The only issue I am having, however, are the blacks.
B00BCGROJG,8,4,Defective screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,5,This time, I had them set up the TV on the floor and look at both screens side by side.
B00BCGROJG,8,6,Perfect screen with lighting issue gone!
B00BCGROJG,8,7,My 40in Samsung had some light in the corners when black bars were present for movies.
B00BCGROJG,8,8,If you watch a movie with a lot of blacks, dark scenes, you will notice a significant amount of white clouding in the blacked out areas.
B00BCGROJG,8,9,Once we got into watching DARK movies in a DARK room, we quickly realized that "CLOUDING" and "FLASH LIGHTING" was going to be an issue.
B00BCGROJG,8,10,It's dark down there.
B00BCGROJG,8,11,Great brights but the darks are not all that :o( I love this TV BUT my only problem is with dark scenes.
B00BCGROJG,8,12,Very noticeable in dark scenes.
B00BCGROJG,8,13,I don't see how anyone could watch a darkish movie like batman or harry potter at night and not be annoyed the whole time.
B00BCGROJG,8,14,Great TV in the day, blotchy blacks at night.
B00BCGROJG,8,15,Furthermore, room lighting must be nearly dark to notice this flaw.
B00BCGROJG,8,16,But I just can't get past the leakage of the blacks.
B00BCGROJG,8,17,Watching it is a pleasure.
B00BCGROJG,8,18,Immediately noticed 2 red stuck pixels on the screen and some clouding in upper right and lower left sides of the TV.
B00BCGROJG,8,19,No pixelation issues.
B00BCGROJG,8,20,It's not the settings themselves that has the issue.
B00BCGROJG,8,21,been watching this tv for several days now.
B00BCGROJG,8,22,Turned the lights back on in the room to the ;level they usually are at when we watch TV.
B00BCGROJG,8,23,The bottom right corner had a white streak of light like the corner of the panel was pinched by a screw or something.
B00BCGROJG,8,24,As soon as it powered on,  the lower left corner of the TV had an estimated 100+ of black and white pixels going jagged and horizontal across the screen.
B00BCGROJG,9,0,Do not buy Samsung!!
B00BCGROJG,9,1,Now 2 years later - same problem.
B00BCGROJG,9,2,For 58.00 more you now have a 5 year warranty.
B00BCGROJG,9,3,Having Problems.
B00BCGROJG,9,4,This will buy me some time so I can try again when the 2014's come out.
B00BCGROJG,9,5,My previous 40" TV was a Samsung, about four years old, and this TV continues to reinforce my belief that Samsung is the only TV to buy!
B00BCGROJG,9,6,We purchased a new TV on an impulse to replace a 40 inch 2 year old Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,9,7,I made the mistake of not starting with Samsung when the problems first stared a year ago.Random turning itself off.
B00BCGROJG,9,8,8 months ago I purchased a 55" Samsung for my bedroom.
B00BCGROJG,9,9,Great picture/dead in 3 months.
B00BCGROJG,9,10,I went to best buy with the intention of buying a five hundred dollar tv and ended up buying this at eleven.
B00BCGROJG,9,11,They will not replace them under warranty and say they are normal.
B00BCGROJG,9,12,Buy a set for a 1000.00
B00BCGROJG,9,13,Last Samsung purchase.
B00BCGROJG,9,14,I purchased this to replace a five year old TV which had already began to fail.
B00BCGROJG,9,15,65" Samsung replaces 55" Panasonic VT30.
B00BCGROJG,9,16,My first 2 Vizio TV's are still working fine and one is over 5 years old.
B00BCGROJG,9,17,I am having issues with a 14 month old Samsung that cost $3000.It is a 65" LCD LED 3 D Samsung.I am in the Costco extended warranty.
B00BCGROJG,9,18,I got a replacement and that unit had the same issue on the same day!
B00BCGROJG,9,19,Samsung TV's have serious problems.
B00BCGROJG,9,20,After 3 weeks the LCD started power cycling.
B00BCGROJG,9,21,I bought and returned two Samsung UN65F7100 tvs recently from a store.
B00BCGROJG,9,22,I didn't have any problems with TV.
B00BCGROJG,9,23,The Samsung picture is impressive yet the problems are significant.I think I will go back to buying Vizio.
B00BCGROJG,9,24,None of the Sonys we liked were available (2012 models); then, we saw this Samsung for a very good price and decided to buy.
B00BCGROJG,10,0,Before someone tells me that I shouldn't use tv speakers and should instead use a surround sound system, I get that.
B00BCGROJG,10,1,Beyond that, the unit is ascetically pleasing and looks great mounted on the wall.
B00BCGROJG,10,2,pedestal mount is solid , connections are well laid out .Wall mount application may have issue with some connections i.e.
B00BCGROJG,10,3,annoying was the TV speakers rattle sometimes, at low volume, when on surround sound mode.
B00BCGROJG,10,4,Unit can be hung using the Samsung cable system mount without any issues.
B00BCGROJG,10,5,Mounts very close to the wall so the wires do not show.
B00BCGROJG,10,6,Exactly what I wanted and I have both of them mounted on the wall.
B00BCGROJG,10,7,OTHER REVIEWS COMPLAINED ABOUT THE SOUND NOT BEING LOUD ENOUGH BUT I DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK THAT WAS A PROBLEM.
B00BCGROJG,10,8,Setup is quite easy; you assemble the stand parts (2) with 4 *very tiny* screws, and then attach the stand to the TV with yet another 4 of the same screws.
B00BCGROJG,10,9,The problem is our baby is in the living room with us a lot, falls asleep, and the real surround sound system will wake him.
B00BCGROJG,10,10,The sound is acceptable, but an external sound system is really necessary for sound immersion.
B00BCGROJG,10,11,This then required a separate sound connection since I don't use the TV as a source for the sound.
B00BCGROJG,10,12,I love this TV because I could mount it on my wall, hide one power cord and I was finished.
B00BCGROJG,10,13,This was to allow for a wall installation and cut back on external units (cable box, DVD) showing in the room.
B00BCGROJG,10,14,I connected them with HDMI cables, while hooking sound system with optical cable directly to TV.
B00BCGROJG,10,15,Hooked up headphones so it doesn't have to be real loud for everyone.
B00BCGROJG,10,16,The audio power is insufficient to support a low frequency (bass) and the speakers will audibly clatter (clip) indicating the system is failing.
B00BCGROJG,10,17,The smart features are so wonderful, down to the smart remote.If you wall mount this unit, you will be better served by ordering the VideoSecu Articulating Full Motion TV Wall Mount for 32"-65" LED LCD Plasma Mount.
B00BCGROJG,10,18,If you messed it up and the TV is not working properly, don't work hard and take it of the wall (like I did).
B00BCGROJG,10,19,However, that was a quick test as we normally use an external amplifier and speakers.Overall, it hard to believe that this is one or two models below the top of the line.
B00BCGROJG,10,20,I attached it to a wall mount and hooked it to the receiver without difficulty but a smaller person would have needed help.
B00BCGROJG,10,21,The sound on this set is good enough in a medium sized living room that I don't feel the need for a home theater or additional speakers.So to recap.
B00BCGROJG,10,22,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,10,23,The built in speakers S. U. C. K.!  But... what do you expect from a TV this thin?!?
B00BCGROJG,10,24,(Not a huge issue since you're probably well served to just use the soundbar sound via optical anyway)Given how great everything else is, these negatives are hardly an issue.
B00BCGROJG,11,0,I called Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,11,1,Boo Samsung, boo!
B00BCGROJG,11,2,Pray that you don't have any problems with it.
B00BCGROJG,11,3,The Samsung 7100 was in a league of it's own.
B00BCGROJG,11,4,Well you betcha I have problems.
B00BCGROJG,11,5,I contacted Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,11,6,Customer service was no help.
B00BCGROJG,11,7,Customer support was incompetent.
B00BCGROJG,11,8,Called Samsung and we had service scheduled.
B00BCGROJG,11,9,Dont buy Samsung - they don't last.
B00BCGROJG,11,10,Samsung customer service wasn't very helpful in acknowledging the problem.
B00BCGROJG,11,11,TV great, customer service not so much.
B00BCGROJG,11,12,I have had tremendous success with Samsung and Amazon's service has always been good to me.
B00BCGROJG,11,13,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,11,14,I called Samsung to exchange them.
B00BCGROJG,11,15,After more than 2 hours on the call I got them to assign the ticket to a new customer service center.
B00BCGROJG,11,16,Last Samsung I will ever buy.
B00BCGROJG,11,17,Worst when I called support again to record the issue they give me a repair ticket number and a phone number to call.
B00BCGROJG,11,18,They kept on harping that there is nothing they could do until their so called agencies confirmed that there is a problem.
B00BCGROJG,11,19,Tv 5 stars samsung service 1 star.
B00BCGROJG,11,20,And I called Samsung support who told me all of my problems were thanks to my wireless router.
B00BCGROJG,11,21,Good product - horrid support.
B00BCGROJG,11,22,She finally concluded that I need to have the set serviced.
B00BCGROJG,11,23,Best picture I have seen BUT poor customer service.
B00BCGROJG,11,24,Problem with my set.
B00BCGROJG,12,0,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,12,1,Very easy to set up.
B00BCGROJG,12,2,Good picture.
B00BCGROJG,12,3,The set up was easy.
B00BCGROJG,12,4,Great Picture.
B00BCGROJG,12,5,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,12,6,very good TV great picture.
B00BCGROJG,12,7,I'm old school and this TV is easy to set up and the picture is awesome.
B00BCGROJG,12,8,This Tv is a Great value.
B00BCGROJG,12,9,But the picture quality is great.
B00BCGROJG,12,10,Easy to set up and control.
B00BCGROJG,12,11,great!
B00BCGROJG,12,12,Set up is easy but takes a while.
B00BCGROJG,12,13,great TV.
B00BCGROJG,12,14,Quality Picture.
B00BCGROJG,12,15,It was also light and easy to get up and running.
B00BCGROJG,12,16,Very good TV.
B00BCGROJG,12,17,Great tv!
B00BCGROJG,12,18,There are many, many settings that affect brightness, many settings that affect color balance, etc... so even the last few settings will make a big difference to how the picture looks.
B00BCGROJG,12,19,Picture settings.
B00BCGROJG,12,20,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,12,21,The picture quality is great.
B00BCGROJG,12,22,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,12,23,The picture is very good and clear as well and the colors are very prominent and clean.
B00BCGROJG,12,24,Easy to setup, great features, intuitive remote, and great picture.
B00BCGROJG,13,0,I almost did not buy this TV after reading some of the 5-star reviews!
B00BCGROJG,13,1,Samsung UN65F7100 review.
B00BCGROJG,13,2,Got caught into the reviews hype.
B00BCGROJG,13,3,If I have any problems I will update this review.
B00BCGROJG,13,4,Beware before buying.
B00BCGROJG,13,5,This is my first ever Samsung product.
B00BCGROJG,13,6,And I had to write a review!The picture quality on this tv is unsurpassed!
B00BCGROJG,13,7,For the product a 5 stars.
B00BCGROJG,13,8,Thank you for all who take the time to write a review.
B00BCGROJG,13,9,Besides that I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a new TV
B00BCGROJG,13,10,Overall I would highly suggest this tv based on my own experience and will alter this review if anything comes up.
B00BCGROJG,13,11,After reading many reviews and forums, and going on prior experience with my older LG,  I had purchased the LG 55" LA7400 first.
B00BCGROJG,13,12,Boo Samsung, boo!
B00BCGROJG,13,13,Buyer beware.
B00BCGROJG,13,14,Samsung also needs to get it's quality control better.
B00BCGROJG,13,15,LG was also on the table but I just couldn't find a model with great overall reviews.
B00BCGROJG,13,16,If you have been reading the reviews here and thinking, "OMG I will never be able to adjust this picture" then read on.At issue here are the complex advanced settings as well as a lot of the reviewer-recommended settings have the contrast at or near 100.
B00BCGROJG,13,17,There is online help from Samsung where they can actually control your TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,18,OK, I am not writing about the specifics of this TV, I am just trying to help people who are thinking or planning to buy it.I like to add, that prior to my purchase, I did my research and read reviews for months too, until I get it and here my review :This TV is very beautiful and easy to set up.
B00BCGROJG,13,19,Hope this helps potential buyers.
B00BCGROJG,13,20,I am astounded that Samsung has a product out with a known glitch that it has still not resolved.
B00BCGROJG,13,21,*****W A R N I N G*****Do not buy SAMSUNG Televisions!!!
B00BCGROJG,13,22,I will update the review after it gets completed.
B00BCGROJG,13,23,I read several different reviews on this product before purchasing so I was aware of difficulty of using before receiving.
B00BCGROJG,13,24,I've done my research and read all the reviews and I'm here to say if you buy this tv you will not regret it!Out of the box its super easy to set up!
B00BCGROJG,14,0,bottom-line is this smart TV just like a Not-Smart-TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,1,The smart TV app?
B00BCGROJG,14,2,This if forgivable as you DO NOT WANT TO USE THEIR SMART TV anyway if you can.
B00BCGROJG,14,3,Plus the smart tv with all the apps this tv has it all...
B00BCGROJG,14,4,wireless is not work.
B00BCGROJG,14,5,Getting back to the Smart Hub.
B00BCGROJG,14,6,There does seem to be a "flow" problem with the SMART tv at times.
B00BCGROJG,14,7,Previews are available on like 10 different apps.
B00BCGROJG,14,8,Apps can't be reorganized.
B00BCGROJG,14,9,I think that if I don't want an app, I should be able to de-install it.
B00BCGROJG,14,10,The same problem was found on the Amazon App in the Smart Hub but not as bad.
B00BCGROJG,14,11,Micro-dimming feature and smart hub are great features.
B00BCGROJG,14,12,I also found that every app in the Smart Hub was very fast and did not cause me to become impatient.
B00BCGROJG,14,13,i couldn't use the Wi-fi to watch the internet TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,14,This smart TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,14,15,The is a smart TV. 5 star for the TV part. 1 start for "smart" part.
B00BCGROJG,14,16,Not too smart.
B00BCGROJG,14,17,Unlike some smart TV's it has a browser that you can go anywhere on the internet that you can like a smart phone.
B00BCGROJG,14,18,Connected without a problem.
B00BCGROJG,14,19,Since I have to get an Apple TV, why i need a Smart TV?
B00BCGROJG,14,20,Great Picture, Poor Smarts.
B00BCGROJG,14,21,this TV wireless connection is very bad.
B00BCGROJG,14,22,Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter.
B00BCGROJG,14,23,Great Smart Features, they most likely have any app or service you could want.Cons:1.
B00BCGROJG,14,24,Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter.
B00BCGROJG,15,0,The remote, however, is dysfunctional.
B00BCGROJG,15,1,I didn't see any.I will say that the remote takes some getting used to.
B00BCGROJG,15,2,would anyone need 4 HDMI inputs?
B00BCGROJG,15,3,Only issue is the remote contrôl.
B00BCGROJG,15,4,If there is one thing that I dislike, it is the remote control.
B00BCGROJG,15,5,All HDMI ports don't work.
B00BCGROJG,15,6,It is the dumbest remote ever.
B00BCGROJG,15,7,Plugged in power and HDMI and it worked.
B00BCGROJG,15,8,It would be nice, though, to have these buttons on the remote.-
B00BCGROJG,15,9,It cannot be used to select a channel from the guide--I have to use my cable box remote to select channels.
B00BCGROJG,15,10,You will need to use a universal remote (making sure you disable the powering on from the remote as the TV will do this on it's own) or the receiver remote to change the receiver input back to the correct device.
B00BCGROJG,15,11,Smart Touch remote - ok but a little limited as you may still need to use a second remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,12,I like and use the tv remote sometimes paired with the cable remote but my wife is strictly a cable remote user.
B00BCGROJG,15,13,Intuitive.The remote with a touch pad works okay.
B00BCGROJG,15,14,Could Samsung simplify the remote by not using the swype pad?
B00BCGROJG,15,15,The remote is ok but we have a universal remote for all the components, so no big deal.
B00BCGROJG,15,16,The ONLY complaint is with the remote control unit itself.
B00BCGROJG,15,17,The only thing that I do not like its the mute button on the remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,18,I wish you could reprogram the guide button.
B00BCGROJG,15,19,The remote that comes with it is one of those remotes you can talk into for different functions.
B00BCGROJG,15,20,I would rather have a full feature remote with buttons.
B00BCGROJG,15,21,I can access all the 'Guide,' 'DVR,' and rewind/forwarding features on the smart remote, just as I could with my set-top remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,22,The only disappointment is my inability to program the remote to control the other components.
B00BCGROJG,15,23,The track-pad input works but is more of a hinderance than a help.
B00BCGROJG,15,24,The HDMI inputs are on one side of the TV and power cord on the other side.
B00AOA9BL0,0,0,Great.
B00AOA9BL0,0,1,Screen looks good but stops.
B00AOA9BL0,0,2,Watching on  such a small screen does.
B00AOA9BL0,0,3,Sitting on my back porch watching missed TV shows its nice.
B00AOA9BL0,0,4,Works Great on My Ipod.
B00AOA9BL0,0,5,Any time I can take CNN to the bathroom is a good thing.
B00AOA9BL0,0,6,Pretty Good.
B00AOA9BL0,0,7,I do wish you could attach to a tv to watch on bigger screen.
B00AOA9BL0,0,8,It allows me to watch anywhere with great quality of video.
B00AOA9BL0,0,9,almost perfect.
B00AOA9BL0,0,10,AwesomeSauce!!! GREAT for entertainment! abcfamily should be made available though along with more recent movies.
B00AOA9BL0,0,11,Not recommended unless you live in Philadelphia or some other area they cover.
B00AOA9BL0,0,12,Works perfectly with excellent picture.
B00AOA9BL0,0,13,Good but one big flaw.
B00AOA9BL0,0,14,Almost perfected....
B00AOA9BL0,0,15,Live TV is great, but a little awkward.
B00AOA9BL0,0,16,It took me a while to figure out how to get back out of live TV view to the main menu.
B00AOA9BL0,0,17,The live TV feature is very useful, but a bit hard to control.
B00AOA9BL0,0,18,I wanted this so I could watch tv while I am in the kitchen.
B00AOA9BL0,0,19,Still has room for improvement.
B00AOA9BL0,0,20,I'm on the go.Now i can watch TV on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,0,21,Good but definitely needs more live tv.
B00AOA9BL0,0,22,no live tv.
B00AOA9BL0,0,23,Usually happens when I'm watching Modern Family or Sirens.
B00AOA9BL0,0,24,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,1,0,great.
B00AOA9BL0,1,1,I love to bookmark my faves and just veg out and get caught up on my shows.

B00AOA9BL0,1,5,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,1,6,That Said...this is a great app.
B00AOA9BL0,1,7,family loves it now has CC so i can use it too.
B00AOA9BL0,1,8,Awesome!!!
B00AOA9BL0,1,9,Love love love this app.
B00AOA9BL0,1,10,They love this app!
B00AOA9BL0,1,11,My family has been using it for years.
B00AOA9BL0,1,12,It's a big deal for me.
B00AOA9BL0,1,13,Great App.
B00AOA9BL0,1,14,Overall I am happy with it.
B00AOA9BL0,1,15,There are fewer newer showS however there are  more more older series.
B00AOA9BL0,1,16,If it isn't a big deal for you, you'll probably like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,1,17,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,1,18,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,1,19,It's free is the only good thing that I didn't buy it.
B00AOA9BL0,1,20,Not a fan of the ads during shows and movies but hey that is why I killed my television 15 years ago.
B00AOA9BL0,1,21,I love it too when I have a chance to use it!
B00AOA9BL0,1,22,Love the fact I can watch what I want when other family members are watching something on the television .
B00AOA9BL0,1,23,Great quality.
B00AOA9BL0,1,24,Other than that it's got good shows and I love it
B00AOA9BL0,2,0,Otherwise, there is no sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,1,The picture and sound were both great.
B00AOA9BL0,2,2,Great quality.
B00AOA9BL0,2,3,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,4,Not hard when there are no other sounds around though.
B00AOA9BL0,2,5,Picture is great  but I cannot hear the audio  very dissappointed .
B00AOA9BL0,2,6,And I have good hearing.
B00AOA9BL0,2,7,sound is better.
B00AOA9BL0,2,8,Sound issue.
B00AOA9BL0,2,9,The sound is good with headphones.
B00AOA9BL0,2,10,If they could fix the sound, I'd give it 5 stars.
B00AOA9BL0,2,11,The last one I had was very low and I never went on it much because of the sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,12,Good App, Horrible Sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,13,Good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,2,14,I can't hear anything and my volume is all the way up.
B00AOA9BL0,2,15,It's a good way to watch when there is no tv around.
B00AOA9BL0,2,16,Video quality is acceptable though not great.
B00AOA9BL0,2,17,Clear picture and sound, awesome to be able to watch shows on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,2,18,Overall good value.
B00AOA9BL0,2,19,can't hear anything!
B00AOA9BL0,2,20,It is not my device  because sound  is  great for all other applications
B00AOA9BL0,2,21,This is the only way I can hear anything.
B00AOA9BL0,2,22,Good experience.
B00AOA9BL0,2,23,Sound more than occasionally would be good too.
B00AOA9BL0,2,24,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,3,0,It does not work with all the boxes in the house.
B00AOA9BL0,3,1,So far it's really great.
B00AOA9BL0,3,2,There's nowhere on Amazon to go to get help.
B00AOA9BL0,3,3,I love it because I can watch my shows the day after if I miss then... with on-demand I have to wait a week.
B00AOA9BL0,3,4,YOU GUYS NEED TO WORK ON IT.
B00AOA9BL0,3,5,That's one less homework assignment when you arrive home.
B00AOA9BL0,3,6,Though I am satisfied with my services, the customer service would rate at best a D-, and cost for those services about the same.
B00AOA9BL0,3,7,who knows why either, as Amazon.
B00AOA9BL0,3,8,Was aggravated when it didn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,3,9,Didn't know what this was and ordered it.
B00AOA9BL0,3,10,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,3,11,Okay product.
B00AOA9BL0,3,12,Can't wait to check out everything that is offered.
B00AOA9BL0,3,13,If you claim it, it should work as promised.
B00AOA9BL0,3,14,great for watching shows on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,3,15,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,3,16,This is very unprofessional and is one more reason to cancel this service.
B00AOA9BL0,3,17,It's not perfect but it's doing the job I need for.
B00AOA9BL0,3,18,Worked great for about a week.
B00AOA9BL0,3,19,So many shows that can be watched at lunch, waiting for an appointment and more/
B00AOA9BL0,3,20,Maybe one day it will.
B00AOA9BL0,3,21,So it works great about 90% of the time, and I really like it.
B00AOA9BL0,3,22,Works great most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,3,23,Works perfectly with excellent picture.
B00AOA9BL0,3,24,Good day, Sir.
B00AOA9BL0,4,0,I can't watch any movie without a subscription.You know what we have so that's what should pop up only
B00AOA9BL0,4,1,Amazing amazing amazing
B00AOA9BL0,4,2,Ok but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,4,3,I love it it's amazing.
B00AOA9BL0,4,4,Watching movies is great!
B00AOA9BL0,4,5,great app.
B00AOA9BL0,4,6,Good appNeeds more movies for basic people with basic cable not many live shows available either other than that it's good food HD videos fast streaming
B00AOA9BL0,4,7,All the shows I want to watch are available but don't always play even when i can get them to play on the computer.
B00AOA9BL0,4,8,It allows me to watch anywhere with great quality of video.
B00AOA9BL0,4,9,Been having a lot of issues with tv shows an  movies not playing.
B00AOA9BL0,4,10,Works fine and I like how it saved my place as I had to stop several times during my movie.
B00AOA9BL0,4,11,It gets very annoying when one is trying to watch a good movie or show.
B00AOA9BL0,4,12,I watched the Dark Shadow movie the other day and it was good.
B00AOA9BL0,4,13,Crystal clear and very fast.
B00AOA9BL0,4,14,It's very annoying especially when there's important dialog or fast action sequences.
B00AOA9BL0,4,15,Clear picture and sound, awesome to be able to watch shows on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,4,16,The addition of live programming has made this a lot better for me to watch sports!
B00AOA9BL0,4,17,You can watch some stuff, don't expect to be able to watch all on-demand shows like on TV if it was so it would be good.
B00AOA9BL0,4,18,nice.
B00AOA9BL0,4,19,One thing that brothers me, is some of the really good movies are taken off too soon.
B00AOA9BL0,4,20,Lots of shows & movies to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,4,21,The quality of the video is also really good making it my new favorite app it cemented that place when our ondemand recently was inaccessible for like a week I could still watch all the shows and movies in my package.
B00AOA9BL0,4,22,The app works well on my Galaxy 3. I love being able to watch my programs when I have downtime at work.
B00AOA9BL0,4,23,I watch a lot of TV shows and movies with this app.
B00AOA9BL0,4,24,If it actually ran properly it would be amazing!!!
B00AOA9BL0,5,0,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,5,1,Like others have said...Good but not great!
B00AOA9BL0,5,2,Has some good features.
B00AOA9BL0,5,3,Good!
B00AOA9BL0,5,4,good.
B00AOA9BL0,5,5,good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,5,6,I'm sure this is a great product.
B00AOA9BL0,5,7,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,5,8,Good value, especially if you like binge-watching tv shows.
B00AOA9BL0,5,9,Pretty good.
B00AOA9BL0,5,10,It's good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,5,11,It's really good and I like it a lot.
B00AOA9BL0,5,12,pretty good.
B00AOA9BL0,5,13,good, but long way from great.
B00AOA9BL0,5,14,not what I wantednot how I wanted itI wouldnt recommend it to everyoneit cost too much money
B00AOA9BL0,5,15,I like it...I use it...I'm happy!
B00AOA9BL0,5,16,good.
B00AOA9BL0,5,17,It's free is the only good thing that I didn't buy it.
B00AOA9BL0,5,18,Disappointing.
B00AOA9BL0,5,19,That would be even better.
B00AOA9BL0,5,20,would recommend
B00AOA9BL0,5,21,Good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,5,22,Waste of time it is no good should be taken off so no one else wastes their time What a shame
B00AOA9BL0,5,23,If I had to pay for it, I would rate it a 1/5 and not purchase it.
B00AOA9BL0,5,24,I wish the controls were a bit better.
B00AOA9BL0,6,0,I like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,1,I really like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,2,The potential for this app is there.
B00AOA9BL0,6,3,Otherwise, the app is okay.
B00AOA9BL0,6,4,What has happened to this app?
B00AOA9BL0,6,5,I like this app!
B00AOA9BL0,6,6,Must have app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,7,Ok. Ok app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,8,Don't like the shortage of apps available.
B00AOA9BL0,6,9,Cannot use app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,10,Well keep using this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,11,So far I really dig this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,12,gGood app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,13,I like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,14,This app works very well.
B00AOA9BL0,6,15,This app will not work on my reg.
B00AOA9BL0,6,16,NEEDS AN UPDATE/NEW APP.
B00AOA9BL0,6,17,I haven't used this app much.
B00AOA9BL0,6,18,I would like to see these incorporated into this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,19,This app doesn't work at all!
B00AOA9BL0,6,20,You also need an ID to get into the app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,21,I wasn't able to get into this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,22,NOT A GO APP.
B00AOA9BL0,6,23,Please fix this app!!!
B00AOA9BL0,6,24,Using this app.
B00AOA9BL0,7,0,No HDMI out...boo!
B00AOA9BL0,7,1,If I wanted to watch it at home I would use the cable box.
B00AOA9BL0,7,2,The quality it'snot hd and mightnot translate well if you connect it to your tv but it did fine on the device.
B00AOA9BL0,7,3,works great.
B00AOA9BL0,7,4,Netflix has HDMI out.
B00AOA9BL0,7,5,Goes to 5 stars with the HDMI out working.
B00AOA9BL0,7,6,Help, I just bought a new hdtv to connect to my fire hd via hdmi cable, and no shows will play whether connected to the tv or not.
B00AOA9BL0,7,7,Good but needs more channels.
B00AOA9BL0,7,8,As if the price of cable wasn't enough.
B00AOA9BL0,7,9,You can have TV anywhere you have a connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,10,Best to have a good internet connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,11,Huh? I thought that this is cable TV to go.
B00AOA9BL0,7,12,That is really nice when you do not have a WiFi connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,13,Doesn't always want  to work though.
B00AOA9BL0,7,14,It only lets you play it on your moble device not from your device to an HD TV .
B00AOA9BL0,7,15,Must have Comcast as a cable or high speed internet connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,16,Cable went out during a recent ice storm.
B00AOA9BL0,7,17,Good.
B00AOA9BL0,7,18,Of course, it would be nice if Viacom network shows were available or if cable wasn't so absurdly overpriced, but you can't have everything.
B00AOA9BL0,7,19,Satellite or cable required.
B00AOA9BL0,7,20,It is ok if you have a very strong WI-FI signal.
B00AOA9BL0,7,21,It works for what I need it for.
B00AOA9BL0,7,22,The HD quality is superb.
B00AOA9BL0,7,23,On the house Internet it works better.
B00AOA9BL0,7,24,3 stars for neutral rating as you must have Comcast as a cable or high speed internet connection
B00AOA9BL0,8,0,Shows the bitrate on some movies right in the middle of the screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,1,There is a green bar at the top of your screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,2,First show there were a few times it stopped and then started.
B00AOA9BL0,8,3,I watched the Dark Shadow movie the other day and it was good.
B00AOA9BL0,8,4,Gotta get these problems fixed or no one will want it!!
B00AOA9BL0,8,5,When your show is playing tap the right side of the screen and the volume slider comes up.
B00AOA9BL0,8,6,TOO MANY IMAGES OPEN.
B00AOA9BL0,8,7,Sometimes it continues playing sound but has a blank screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,8,When you close out and start back up it should bring you to a home screen instead of where you left off..
B00AOA9BL0,8,9,not bad.
B00AOA9BL0,8,10,Really wanted this to work- tried to watch Hollywood Game Night.
B00AOA9BL0,8,11,The screen freezes and the program quits playing or the sound advances and the screen is still frozen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,12,Have to keep moving slide bar on time left in program.
B00AOA9BL0,8,13,i want watch walking dead while eating corn on the cob at the inlaws in Londrina Brasil.
B00AOA9BL0,8,14,It will freeze a screen for days.
B00AOA9BL0,8,15,Watching on  such a small screen does.
B00AOA9BL0,8,16,Only works part time.
B00AOA9BL0,8,17,Runs ib the background al the time.
B00AOA9BL0,8,18,Not so bad.
B00AOA9BL0,8,19,Often the video will stop out of the blue and take you back to the episode detail screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,20,A lot worse.
B00AOA9BL0,8,21,On the Xmas version of Hollywood Game Night ~ it kept starting and stopping and finally stopped completely.
B00AOA9BL0,8,22,I have to keep my finger on the screen and use my other hand to immediately tap the nav button I want when I lift my &#34;first&#34; hand.The steady and high quality video makes up for it, mostly!
B00AOA9BL0,8,23,Too bad.
B00AOA9BL0,8,24,I constantly get a pop up message telling me too many images open.
B00AOA9BL0,9,0,Been trying for months and no success.
B00AOA9BL0,9,1,This has never worked in the 5 months I have it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,2,Had It 5 Months- Never Worked.
B00AOA9BL0,9,3,Buy a nook
B00AOA9BL0,9,4,good when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,9,5,I've had this for a few months now and it has never worked once.
B00AOA9BL0,9,6,Thankfully, after almost a year they FINALLY fixed that problem!More.recently,
B00AOA9BL0,9,7,it has tried and failed several times times.
B00AOA9BL0,9,8,Works well for what it is.
B00AOA9BL0,9,9,I tried a couple of times.
B00AOA9BL0,9,10,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,9,11,Stops and starts randomly.
B00AOA9BL0,9,12,First show there were a few times it stopped and then started.
B00AOA9BL0,9,13,Maybe It will be OK once I have time to spend on it to learn it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,14,I was able to watch a couple of shows without a problem.
B00AOA9BL0,9,15,And consider all problems.
B00AOA9BL0,9,16,hasn't worked and still trying.
B00AOA9BL0,9,17,I so wished I knew about this trouble before my purchase.
B00AOA9BL0,9,18,When it works, I love it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,19,I really enjoyed it until a few weeks ago.
B00AOA9BL0,9,20,Waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,21,Dont waste your storage...or your time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,22,I have a tech come out every other month for 4 years and my garbage signal has yet to be fixed.
B00AOA9BL0,9,23,WHEN it works it is great but it very rarely works on my Fire HD 8.9.
B00AOA9BL0,9,24,It would start to but just stop cold after the 7 second  mark.
B00AOA9BL0,10,0,volume.
B00AOA9BL0,10,1,Volume controls are set to low, hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,10,2,The volume used to be an issue.
B00AOA9BL0,10,3,No Volume Control.
B00AOA9BL0,10,4,volume is awful!
B00AOA9BL0,10,5,Volume.
B00AOA9BL0,10,6,i wish it had it's own audio control.
B00AOA9BL0,10,7,With out headphones it is quite hard to hear.That's the only bad thing.
B00AOA9BL0,10,8,It's always low even though my volume is all the way up.
B00AOA9BL0,10,9,its okay, but sometimes hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,10,10,The volume doesn't get very loud, so I have to hook up speakers to hear shows on xfinity.
B00AOA9BL0,10,11,As mentioned by others the volume is very low even with head phones and using external speakers only makes it slightly more of normal  volume level but not really loud so if your hard of hearing or are you are multitasking you may not really hear much.
B00AOA9BL0,10,12,volume too low and needs quick rewind button.
B00AOA9BL0,10,13,The only way to adjust is with the headset volume control.
B00AOA9BL0,10,14,Even when set to the highest level you can barely hear the sound.
B00AOA9BL0,10,15,Can't get volume.
B00AOA9BL0,10,16,various channels have different volume settings and is difficult toadjust sound properly.
B00AOA9BL0,10,17,Otherwise you can't hear it.
B00AOA9BL0,10,18,I have a Bluetooth speaker for my kindle, so sound isn't a problem.
B00AOA9BL0,10,19,Overrides my kindle' s volume controls.
B00AOA9BL0,10,20,Also, there are no volume controls on the player and with the volume turned all the way up on the Kindle you can still barely hear anything.
B00AOA9BL0,10,21,For those having problems with the volume being to low I found that if you go to settings in the app, then playback options, then click on volume control you can make it pretty loud.
B00AOA9BL0,10,22,My only issue is sometimes the sound cuts out for a second or two.
B00AOA9BL0,10,23,Also the volume control on this app is quite low and have to have headphones on in order to hear it clearly.
B00AOA9BL0,10,24,Even with Blue Tooth headphones, the volume is just too low.
B00AOA9BL0,11,0,I think that's what they called it?
B00AOA9BL0,11,1,Who do I call ?
B00AOA9BL0,11,2,I even have emailed about this and was told to call and get help that way.
B00AOA9BL0,11,3,Terrible customer service
B00AOA9BL0,11,4,Tried this 3 or 4 time over 2 days.
B00AOA9BL0,11,5,It tok a day and a few phone calls, but I finally got the app working.
B00AOA9BL0,11,6,And on the many  phone calls to comcast for tech support, this was never mentioned!
B00AOA9BL0,11,7,Fix or I will get a different cable service all together.
B00AOA9BL0,11,8,Now 7 techs later and no one can fix it.
B00AOA9BL0,11,9,serviceable.
B00AOA9BL0,11,10,Called amazon, Comcast, no help.
B00AOA9BL0,11,11,Horrible horrible customer service and company.
B00AOA9BL0,11,12,If anyone can help me figure out the problem please let me know.
B00AOA9BL0,11,13,Worked great for about a week.
B00AOA9BL0,11,14,(Netflix works fine)  Amazon tech help tells me to contact Xfinity tech for help.
B00AOA9BL0,11,15,This has never worked in the 5 months I have it.
B00AOA9BL0,11,16,Had It 5 Months- Never Worked.
B00AOA9BL0,11,17,FIX THIS ISSUE AND FIX IT NOW!!!
B00AOA9BL0,11,18,Installed three weeks ago, repair men have come to "fix" the problems only to have something else pop up or the repair that was made didn't quite fix it.
B00AOA9BL0,11,19,This information should be made available to the customer upfront so that they do not waste time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,20,Good. no problems yet.
B00AOA9BL0,11,21,Did not work with my TV.
B00AOA9BL0,11,22,horrible level service.
B00AOA9BL0,11,23,Boo to not supporting your existing customer base.
B00AOA9BL0,11,24,worked great at first.
B00AOA9BL0,12,0,Easy to use
B00AOA9BL0,12,1,Not Easy.
B00AOA9BL0,12,2,Great so.
B00AOA9BL0,12,3,easy as pie.
B00AOA9BL0,12,4,good but not excellent.
B00AOA9BL0,12,5,Easy to use.
B00AOA9BL0,12,6,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,12,7,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,12,8,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,12,9,It's pretty good, easy to use.
B00AOA9BL0,12,10,very nice.
B00AOA9BL0,12,11,Easy to use.
B00AOA9BL0,12,12,Easy to use too.
B00AOA9BL0,12,13,Neither good nor bad.
B00AOA9BL0,12,14,Easy to use.
B00AOA9BL0,12,15,You need to go to settings menu and monkey around and then it will work.
B00AOA9BL0,12,16,nice layout and easy to use.
B00AOA9BL0,12,17,Not bad, not great.
B00AOA9BL0,12,18,Screen looks good but stops.
B00AOA9BL0,12,19,When it works it is great to have these shows/movies available at my fingertips.
B00AOA9BL0,12,20,Simple to set-up and easy to use.
B00AOA9BL0,12,21,This app is very easy to use and works great.
B00AOA9BL0,12,22,Worked great!
B00AOA9BL0,12,23,Easy navigation.
B00AOA9BL0,12,24,It is easy to use.
B00AOA9BL0,13,0,Review.
B00AOA9BL0,13,1,Twp Star Review.
B00AOA9BL0,13,2,I rated it why do I need to write a review?
B00AOA9BL0,13,3,I rated it why do I need to write a review?
B00AOA9BL0,13,4,Will change review when I do
B00AOA9BL0,13,5,There's nowhere on Amazon to go to get help.
B00AOA9BL0,13,6,The only reason I gave it one star is because I could not  give it a no star rating.
B00AOA9BL0,13,7,Four stars.
B00AOA9BL0,13,8,Hope will get better.
B00AOA9BL0,13,9,I cannot review a product that I cannot access.
B00AOA9BL0,13,10,It was a bit hard to get set up and I had to enlist a younger person to help.
B00AOA9BL0,13,11,Amazon needs to highlight this in the description.
B00AOA9BL0,13,12,Make it the same quality as on my phone an I will give it 5 stars no problem.
B00AOA9BL0,13,13,Be careful and get it in writing.
B00AOA9BL0,13,14,I guess my big TV is too old for this product!
B00AOA9BL0,13,15,Hate this product.
B00AOA9BL0,13,16,Once updated I will change my rating.
B00AOA9BL0,13,17,There are no updates that would work.
B00AOA9BL0,13,18,I thought this would be good.
B00AOA9BL0,13,19,If I get the service I've always  had in thepast, I will post to a more positive and detailed update.
B00AOA9BL0,13,20,Did not work with my TV.
B00AOA9BL0,13,21,Why isn't this fixed yet after so many reviewers have pointed this out?
B00AOA9BL0,13,22,You should be able to at least buy the upgrade or get a trade in and not have to buy a whole new device to be up to date.
B00AOA9BL0,13,23,Hope they change soon to make it more user friendly .
B00AOA9BL0,13,24,Works perfect, but Amazon needs to update when this app updates nationally.
B00AOA9BL0,14,0,Like Netflix, I've yet to use it.
B00AOA9BL0,14,1,dont work to well.
B00AOA9BL0,14,2,Even with a 105MB connection, the app was very slow.
B00AOA9BL0,14,3,it actualy works.
B00AOA9BL0,14,4,I didn't have any problems with the old app.
B00AOA9BL0,14,5,Never have this problem with Netflix app on the same device with the same Wi-Fi connection.
B00AOA9BL0,14,6,The app is great when it works, I am connected online yet it tells me to connect.
B00AOA9BL0,14,7,There are no updates that would work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,8,It worked and then they did something so it will not let me connect to the internet through my router.
B00AOA9BL0,14,9,I wish they'd get a ROKU app too, so I can use it on a Roku projector.The app has worked very well for me with no problems at all.
B00AOA9BL0,14,10,Works - Most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,11,Great app.
B00AOA9BL0,14,12,Does not work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,13,I have this app on all my devices and it stops playing after about 30 every time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,14,The app itself is great.
B00AOA9BL0,14,15,Amazon app store, any suggestions or workarounds?
B00AOA9BL0,14,16,Great when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,14,17,I don't have this trouble with Netflix or other video streaming, so I know it's not my wireless connection.
B00AOA9BL0,14,18,Has anyone else had this problem?
B00AOA9BL0,14,19,Maybe it's error but I have issues with this app.
B00AOA9BL0,14,20,This app is very easy to use and works great.
B00AOA9BL0,14,21,Works well by trial and error.
B00AOA9BL0,14,22,The App itself works great.
B00AOA9BL0,14,23,IT'S NOT MY SYSTEM AS IT WORKS GREAT STREAMING ON THE INTERNET, OTHERWISE.
B00AOA9BL0,14,24,Works perfect, but Amazon needs to update when this app updates nationally.
B00AOA9BL0,15,0,It works, BUT...
B00AOA9BL0,15,1,If you fix this problem and the app still isn't working, then press the power button on your kindle for 30 seconds and after that turn the device back on.
B00AOA9BL0,15,2,Cool app but if you try to connect to your tv via the cable it stops all video and asks you disconnect cable.
B00AOA9BL0,15,3,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,15,4,Is it me or has anyone else had this problem.
B00AOA9BL0,15,5,BUT desperately need volume button.
B00AOA9BL0,15,6,needs volume button.
B00AOA9BL0,15,7,Needs easier playback controls such as a 10 second rewind button.
B00AOA9BL0,15,8,Who is controlling the shows and networks that are on this?
B00AOA9BL0,15,9,The kicker is that once it starts this, it keeps doing it until you power off the device, wait 10 seconds or so, and then power it back on.
B00AOA9BL0,15,10,When your show is playing tap the right side of the screen and the volume slider comes up.
B00AOA9BL0,15,11,works well even with a less than ideal network connection.
B00AOA9BL0,15,12,I wish the controls were a bit better.
B00AOA9BL0,15,13,Even with a 105MB connection, the app was very slow.
B00AOA9BL0,15,14,Hope it would have the same features as on the PC such as viewing videos but alas no.
B00AOA9BL0,15,15,Once the audio kept going but the picture froze (Bones) and the second  time (Castle) it  froze completely.
B00AOA9BL0,15,16,It comes in handy but when watching a show its not that easy to navigate through the menus to switch shows or to just find a new one.
B00AOA9BL0,15,17,volume too low and needs quick rewind button.
B00AOA9BL0,15,18,This app shuts off the HDMI output.
B00AOA9BL0,15,19,Works well with Comcast although one has to be careful when scrolling thru the channel guide or you will be accidentally changing channels.Great having channel guide, DVR manager, Movies and more on one screen.
B00AOA9BL0,15,20,I'd like to hit play and the tv show runs until it is over.
B00AOA9BL0,15,21,I have this app on all my devices and it stops playing after about 30 every time.
B00AOA9BL0,15,22,Locking up playing audio with no picture ,saying "seeking".
B00AOA9BL0,15,23,This app works, but only for watching available shows directly on our Fire HD 8.9.
B00AOA9BL0,15,24,This app works fine except for a major bug.
