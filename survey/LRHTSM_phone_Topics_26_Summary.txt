B00COYOAYW,1,0,But, there are not many apps available...
B00COYOAYW,1,1,However, there are far more Android apps than Windows Phone apps.
B00COYOAYW,1,2,Now know this, Android has over 895,000 apps, while Windows 8 has around 170,000 apps.
B00COYOAYW,1,3,no windows phone!
B00COYOAYW,1,4,its not android!
B00COYOAYW,1,5,There are no apps.
B00COYOAYW,1,6,More apps!
B00COYOAYW,1,7,Doesn't have all of the same apps available as I had with the Android.
B00COYOAYW,1,8,Ya I can't get all the farting apps that android has.
B00COYOAYW,1,9,I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.
B00COYOAYW,1,10,If APPS are important to you, do not get this phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,11,Can't use Google or IPhone Apps but Windows 8 have their own apps to make up for it.
B00COYOAYW,1,12,Android has over 800 thousand apps and games while Windows 8 only about 185 thousand.
B00COYOAYW,1,13,Windows 8 phones are terrific.
B00COYOAYW,1,14,Slowly getting used to the Windows phone being very different from the Androids that I've always used.
B00COYOAYW,1,15,windows 8 phones works really well.
B00COYOAYW,1,16,Windows apps are different from those the Android market.
B00COYOAYW,1,17,Having had only Android phones before, I didn't know if I'd like a Windows phone, but I do.
B00COYOAYW,1,18,If you're an app addict, this may not be the phone for you - just yet.
B00COYOAYW,1,19,Phone does all I need and has enough apps for anything I need as well.
B00COYOAYW,1,20,This is my first windows phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,21,I think windows phone is a better phone  than android phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,22,From Android to Windows.
B00COYOAYW,1,23,They made the OS into an app.
B00COYOAYW,1,24,Enterprise apps that work.
B00COYOAYW,2,0,Dont let the price deceive you.
B00COYOAYW,2,1,killer price.
B00COYOAYW,2,2,Great Phone at an unbelievable price.

B00COYOAYW,3,13,good battery, with all needed apps.
B00COYOAYW,3,14,Seems to have better battery life (2x charge a week vs 1.5x a day).
B00COYOAYW,3,15,battery life great - approx day and a half without using battery saver.
B00COYOAYW,3,16,I charge it every other day.
B00COYOAYW,3,17,I keep my phone on "Battery Saver", and I can go 24+ hours and still have about 30% battery life by the end of that cycle.
B00COYOAYW,3,18,Battery life got better as it was used.
B00COYOAYW,3,19,battery wont charge sometimes so i have to jiggle it until its in the right position.
B00COYOAYW,3,20,battery issue.
B00COYOAYW,3,21,Very good phone.
B00COYOAYW,3,22,good phone.
B00COYOAYW,3,23,It has really long battery life so you don't have to charge every few hours and recharges quickly too so that is good.
B00COYOAYW,3,24,Battery life is good for two solid days -  Though this may be because I stopped using my phone when it stopped informing me of... anything.*
B00COYOAYW,4,0,It was in a very good quality.
B00COYOAYW,4,1,Good quality.
B00COYOAYW,4,2,no quality.

B00COYOAYW,4,19,great phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,20,The sound and the videos from you tube are loud and clear so if they fix that adobe it will make it a great phone but no adobe not so great.
B00COYOAYW,4,21,Good phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,22,Good.
B00COYOAYW,4,23,works great have had no problems with it.sound
B00COYOAYW,4,24,With this price, it is a very good quality phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,0,Great Camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,1,The camera doesn't seem terrific, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.
B00COYOAYW,5,2,If you want a professional camera on a phone, this isn't for you.
B00COYOAYW,5,3,No camera flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,4,Although I wish it had flash for the camera, however the phone works great.
B00COYOAYW,5,5,Camera not too great and im use to a front facing camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,6,Wish it had a front camera!
B00COYOAYW,5,7,Great Camera For The Price.
B00COYOAYW,5,8,The camera is decent (as phone cameras go), There is no flash though.
B00COYOAYW,5,9,But the camera is very good, but no flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,10,I wish it had a front facing camera!
B00COYOAYW,5,11,Has a great look, and camera results are awesome.
B00COYOAYW,5,12,great apps & camera & screen.
B00COYOAYW,5,13,There is also no flash on the camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,14,no front facing camera if you are a skyper
B00COYOAYW,5,15,Lastly the camera works very well even though the phone does not have flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,16,Great phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,17,The camera and pictures--I know there is no flash however low light pictures look great for a low end phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,18,I only wish it had a better camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,19,Great phone and great apps.
B00COYOAYW,5,20,Great phone, great price.
B00COYOAYW,5,21,The only thing is that there isn't a front facing camera but still great!
B00COYOAYW,5,22,I don't think a camera should be added if it had no flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,23,The phone does not have a flash, but even if you take pictures in low light the camera will lighten the photo to make a great picture.
B00COYOAYW,5,24,One more thing, even without the flash on the camera, it takes VERY good photos.
B00COYOAYW,6,0,Nice phone but when I couldn't get the SIM cards to activate with MetroPCS, I took the phones to them.They tried with their SIM cards and couldn't get the phone going.
B00COYOAYW,6,1,Phone didn't work with MetroPCS.
B00COYOAYW,6,2,You have to install the micro sim card unless you already have one.
B00COYOAYW,6,3,Well how come it is not working?I put the SIM card in, turn it on and the Maps app is empty.
B00COYOAYW,6,4,It won't import from the sd card.
B00COYOAYW,6,5,Would be nice to be able to install apps on SD card.8.
B00COYOAYW,6,6,Enterprise apps that work.
B00COYOAYW,6,7,I have a 32GB SD card in it with over 15GB free but I can't get the maps to go to the SD card, they are stuck in internal phone memory.
B00COYOAYW,6,8,storage options â€“ 8GB internal memory and an expandable micro SD card.
B00COYOAYW,6,9,Micro SD card for storage expansion, nice camera and good set of apps from Nokia.
B00COYOAYW,6,10,We have had them since December and they work great!
B00COYOAYW,6,11,I love the SD card expansion for video and music, only wish I could save apps to the SD card.Now how to unlock this thing to take out of the country
B00COYOAYW,6,12,There's 8GB internal memory as well as microSD slot expanded memory.
B00COYOAYW,6,13,very good phone for the money its t-mobile but i used 2 different pre-paid sim cards in it just to see if it would worked and it did.
B00COYOAYW,6,14,Has an MicroSD card slot.9.
B00COYOAYW,6,15,Only has about 7GB storage so you need at least a 16 GB SD card for phone updates, photos, videos etc.
B00COYOAYW,6,16,I expected to be able to have massive storage on my micro-sd card, but the phone doesn't let you easily move/transfer/find/play music etc ... from the micro sd card.
B00COYOAYW,6,17,Although it has a microsd expansion slot, you cannot move apps to the the sdcard.
B00COYOAYW,6,18,FYI it uses a micro sim.
B00COYOAYW,6,19,It seems to want everything stored on internal storage (apps especially) which takes up most of the internal memory.4.
B00COYOAYW,6,20,It came in a sealed box with a SIM card and activation instructions.I used my existing T-Mobile SIM card and it worked right out of the box.
B00COYOAYW,6,21,Yes, similarly, you can't readily load the update to the SD card and run it from there.
B00COYOAYW,6,22,The phone came and I converted my SIM card and it has been great ever since.
B00COYOAYW,6,23,You can put in a 64GB micro SD card and have a backup battery, those are the 2 important options not on a 925.
B00COYOAYW,6,24,* While adding an SD card will let you load tons of music, video, etc - there is limited memory space for apps.
B00COYOAYW,7,0,I like it more than my Samsung Galaxy.
B00COYOAYW,7,1,Nor is it a Samsung.
B00COYOAYW,7,2,It has been working great!
B00COYOAYW,7,3,Received the phone on time and in working order.

B00COYOAYW,7,11,great.
B00COYOAYW,7,12,So far, this phone has worked very well for me.
B00COYOAYW,7,13,This phone is great and it is also $600 less than the iPhone 5s.
B00COYOAYW,7,14,I considered a no-contract Samsung Galaxy, no-contract iPhone, etc.
B00COYOAYW,7,15,I have an iphone for my work phone and this phone does everything the iPhone does.
B00COYOAYW,7,16,For people looking to buy this phone should also look into galaxy from samsung
B00COYOAYW,7,17,Phone works well.
B00COYOAYW,7,18,Ordered it for a friend and she loves it works great and no problems works with my service provider and im in The Bahamas.
B00COYOAYW,7,19,Great first phone.

B00COYOAYW,8,0,Works great as a work phone.
B00COYOAYW,8,1,Good phone but wont work with service.
B00COYOAYW,8,2,Phone didn't work with MetroPCS.
B00COYOAYW,8,3,The phone we kept works good.
B00COYOAYW,8,4,The phone is great.
B00COYOAYW,8,5,T-mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,8,6,this is a great phone and work great.
B00COYOAYW,8,7,I'm keeping the phone but switching service to AT&T.;
B00COYOAYW,8,8,Once I got all these ducks in a row, the phone works like a charm!!
B00COYOAYW,8,9,I went to the T-Mobile store to try it and it did not work, but works well with the 925.
B00COYOAYW,8,10,required phone services to work.
B00COYOAYW,8,11,This is a great way to have a home phone and cell service on demand.
B00COYOAYW,8,12,WiFi works great.
B00COYOAYW,8,13,My goal was to get it unlocked for use on AT&T.;
B00COYOAYW,8,14,Let me state that I primarily use this phone with the Wi-Fi calling feature, as I do not have cell service at home.
B00COYOAYW,8,15,WiFi works great.
B00COYOAYW,8,16,Works great, but if you have a Contract already make sure you call your provider.
B00COYOAYW,8,17,But I know it's coming!Great customer service Amazon!!
B00COYOAYW,8,18,It only does it while I'm at work.
B00COYOAYW,8,19,unlock code.
B00COYOAYW,8,20,T-mobile wifi calling.*
B00COYOAYW,8,21,Bought it for college and work.
B00COYOAYW,8,22,As t mobile has poor coverage at our home, wifi calling was crucial for this phone to work.
B00COYOAYW,8,23,Good phone but.
B00COYOAYW,8,24,The T-Mobile service is ok, but it's hard for me to comment because since I've gotten this phone I've mostly been on an island off the coast of NC and there is not good service here anyway.
B00COYOAYW,9,0,It also has a fast processor.
B00COYOAYW,9,1,great phone.
B00COYOAYW,9,2,Great Phone.
B00COYOAYW,9,3,Great phone, great price.

B00COYOAYW,11,0,Good so far.
B00COYOAYW,11,1,Good phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,2,Good for what it is.
B00COYOAYW,11,3,It is a good phone for an average user.
B00COYOAYW,11,4,Overall good and easy phone to work with.
B00COYOAYW,11,5,This is a good set.
B00COYOAYW,11,6,Hubby has customized his ringtones, lock screen, and the windows screen colors.
B00COYOAYW,11,7,It is very user friendly and has functioned superbly.
B00COYOAYW,11,8,All though it has very good features, It turns itself on and off without even being touched.
B00COYOAYW,11,9,It has all the apps we need now, probably because we aren't power users, and more are being added all the time.Give this phone a try, it is really nice and easy to use.
B00COYOAYW,11,10,Some function is not very good, and the bottom is not very connect to the phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,11,I wish the plastic back had different covers I could change it to, though.
B00COYOAYW,11,12,Pretty minor issue for a good phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,13,Love all the features and the large variety of ring tones and setting options.
B00COYOAYW,11,14,however, my GF seems to think this an old phone just b/c of the design, but its not.
B00COYOAYW,11,15,If you're a phone power user, I couldn't suggest this.
B00COYOAYW,11,16,Not good.
B00COYOAYW,11,17,Plus it does not let you change the background color.
B00COYOAYW,11,18,Even if you lock the screen while on a call it unlocks after a bit and happens all over again.Otherwise, no complaints.
B00COYOAYW,11,19,I like having the "back" button below the screen as it's always easy to find.
B00COYOAYW,11,20,Voice quality and volume are quite good.
B00COYOAYW,11,21,Power button: It's on the side.
B00COYOAYW,11,22,I gave the wrong review on the illumishield plastic covers.
B00COYOAYW,11,23,You can hold down the "back" button and see all the apps running in the background.
B00COYOAYW,11,24,Good Phone and Great price.
B00COYOAYW,12,0,good for calling and texting.
B00COYOAYW,12,1,Value for money.
B00COYOAYW,12,2,Good phone if you just talk and text.
B00COYOAYW,12,3,Talk text and web.
B00COYOAYW,12,4,Easy to use, WiFi calling works and is a great feature.
B00COYOAYW,12,5,This girl sends something like 5,000 text messages a month.
B00COYOAYW,12,6,It tries to send text and email messages ONCE and that's it.
B00COYOAYW,12,7,Great phone for the money.
B00COYOAYW,12,8,Overall good and easy phone to work with.
B00COYOAYW,12,9,I use it with the T-mobile pay as go plan, with no data plan (so I just use wifi).
B00COYOAYW,12,10,I'm not using a data plan, so it's good to know that you can use this phone like any other cheap phone.
B00COYOAYW,12,11,Thankfully, unlimited text messaging was cheap.
B00COYOAYW,12,12,I will recommend this phone because is a great machine.
B00COYOAYW,12,13,Same with text (unless you use say the Facebook messaging app).
B00COYOAYW,12,14,A great phone.
B00COYOAYW,12,15,buy it, if you really need a phone(to call or text someone), not recommended for DATA users.
B00COYOAYW,12,16,Great phone, does just what it says,I have never had a phone with internet before.
B00COYOAYW,12,17,Seemed to work okay as long as you have added extra money to the account for the 10 cent calls and 20 cent texts.
B00COYOAYW,12,18,It got here fast and I think this is a great value for the money.
B00COYOAYW,12,19,For calling and texting is very cheap.
B00COYOAYW,12,20,and chose their 30/mo unlimited web and text, 100min talk plan.
B00COYOAYW,12,21,Oh yeah, it also makes good phone calls and texts.
B00COYOAYW,12,22,For the money, this is more than a good phone.
B00COYOAYW,12,23,The 521 comes with wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,12,24,unless wifi calling (wifi calling is free).
B00COYOAYW,13,0,touch screen, i think $125 is satisfactory.
B00COYOAYW,13,1,Phone case.
B00COYOAYW,13,2,The only problem i had was having to go from my usual big screen 4.7 screens to an actual 4.0 one.
B00COYOAYW,13,3,When I recently put a screen protector on I couldn't find any scratches on the screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,4,The screen is super sens, so much that you can hover your finger over the screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,5,wrong screen protector.
B00COYOAYW,13,6,The screen smudges pretty easily, but that can be fixed with a screen protector.
B00COYOAYW,13,7,The screen is quite nice, way better than the screens you get on similarly priced Android phones.
B00COYOAYW,13,8,Because the case didn't fit my phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,9,There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time.
B00COYOAYW,13,10,The Lumia is the first touch screen phone I have used.
B00COYOAYW,13,11,Phone is nice - did not come with screen protector or car charger.
B00COYOAYW,13,12,I bought screen protector and phone back cover as suggested by Amazaon.
B00COYOAYW,13,13,Got to find a better case for it though.
B00COYOAYW,13,14,Nokia or the windowsphone store looking for these accessories such as the screen protectors and cases.
B00COYOAYW,13,15,I have a TECH21 case and it's perfect.
B00COYOAYW,13,16,I didn't have a case or screen protector yet so I was really worried about my new phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,17,Each time the battery cover, case, and battery flew off.
B00COYOAYW,13,18,Ability to have a high contrast screen (for those with poor eyesight or someone who wants a cool looking screen)7.
B00COYOAYW,13,19,I have not tried a non-glare screen protector.2.
B00COYOAYW,13,20,The phone was nice for a little while and even the case I bought with it was nice but less than the month the phone stop turning on.
B00COYOAYW,13,21,I had the phone for about a month before I bought a screen protector.
B00COYOAYW,13,22,Once I got a good case for it the problems with it leaping from my pocket were fixed.
B00COYOAYW,13,23,nice phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,24,Nice case...fit correctly on my nokia lumina 521however the screen protector was for model nokia 520and did not fit my 521
B00COYOAYW,14,0,As for the apps I don't use that many apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,1,Now know this, Android has over 895,000 apps, while Windows 8 has around 170,000 apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,2,I could refill my prescriptions with an app on my phone which I cannot do since there isn't an app for it on Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,3,Ya I can't get all the farting apps that android has.
B00COYOAYW,14,4,yea youll miss some apps the i phone has but not many.
B00COYOAYW,14,5,This is a WINDOWS phone not an Android Phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,6,Windows is.* Apps?
B00COYOAYW,14,7,Windows Phone!
B00COYOAYW,14,8,Are there less app's for Windows Phone?
B00COYOAYW,14,9,apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,10,The apps seems limited compared to apps you can get for iphone/droid.
B00COYOAYW,14,11,The app store is a FAR cry from the playstore, let me tell you.
B00COYOAYW,14,12,From Android to Windows.
B00COYOAYW,14,13,For now, quite a few of the iphone apps I used do not have a windows version yet.
B00COYOAYW,14,14,Some key apps I would like to have are only on the iPhone and Android.-
B00COYOAYW,14,15,I don't like the way the tiles are laid out for apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,16,Nothing I can really do about that.The apple app store has by far the largest selection of apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,17,But think about all the useless apps that people have polluted Google play with, the apps that aren't really apps, and the apps that aren't  free.
B00COYOAYW,14,18,No cohesion between WP's app store and the Win8 store.
B00COYOAYW,14,19,Get me back to Android please!
B00COYOAYW,14,20,Either it is the windows OS or one of the other apps on the phone so I can't say if the windows OS is slow.
B00COYOAYW,14,21,Because of this, I downloaded the MapQuest app which seems to work much better.
B00COYOAYW,14,22,You can download an autoshoot app and there you have it.
B00COYOAYW,14,23,You would need a window 8 machine if you are able to develop some apps for yourself.
B00COYOAYW,14,24,Windows apps are different from those the Android market.
B00COYOAYW,15,0,Bought it for my 13 year old she loves it Great buy love it I would recommend  Nokia Lumia 521
B00COYOAYW,15,1,I bought this phone for myself a few months ago.
B00COYOAYW,15,2,4 months later, I am still using this phone, and my motivation to purchase another has been dwindled to nothing by this phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,3,Nokia Lumia 521 Phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,4,Nokia phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,5,Nokia.
B00COYOAYW,15,6,It's been about six months and still going.
B00COYOAYW,15,7,Great buy love it I would recommend  it.
B00COYOAYW,15,8,I just bought this phone 2 months ago.
B00COYOAYW,15,9,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,10,I should 've bought it there: less stress and efforts...
B00COYOAYW,15,11,Never buying a Nokia again.
B00COYOAYW,15,12,I bought this phone because I had previously liked other Nokia phones I had purchased.
B00COYOAYW,15,13,I would love to buy the newest nokia lumia soon
B00COYOAYW,15,14,Great phone, great price!
B00COYOAYW,15,15,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,16,Nokia lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,17,Bought this for my 13 year old niece.
B00COYOAYW,15,18,Which replaced the Nokia n8 phone I just bought her 6 months ago.
B00COYOAYW,15,19,Love My Nokia Lumia!!
B00COYOAYW,15,20,I will never buy another Nokia product again.
B00COYOAYW,15,21,Nokia Lumia 521 (T.
B00COYOAYW,15,22,i dont recommend to anyone to buy stuf from them
B00COYOAYW,15,23,Nokia lumia.
B00COYOAYW,15,24,NOKIA LUMIA 521.
B00COYOAYW,16,0,Very Poor Battery Life.
B00COYOAYW,16,1,Battery Life.
B00COYOAYW,16,2,So it blinks (charging) all never charges.
B00COYOAYW,16,3,The charging ion would come up when I would charge but it just wouldn't power up.
B00COYOAYW,16,4,I powered the phone off (it had about 80% battery charge).
B00COYOAYW,16,5,Problems with battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,6,Even when the phone did work the battery life was terrible.
B00COYOAYW,16,7,I charge my phone usually every other day.
B00COYOAYW,16,8,The battery would not hold a charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,9,I tried everything, if i plug it in (tried for about 17hr charge) it will not keep the charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,10,Drains the battery within 4 hours.
B00COYOAYW,16,11,Now it will not even charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,12,Battery life is great.
B00COYOAYW,16,13,The battery life.
B00COYOAYW,16,14,It wasn't until a few days later that my phone started turning off on it's own even though the battery was fully charged.
B00COYOAYW,16,15,One issue with this phone, is the battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,16,Battery life is terrible unless you have the battery saver on.
B00COYOAYW,16,17,Battery life was a godsend as she can use it all day without it dying by 3-4pm.
B00COYOAYW,16,18,For the first month I kept it in battery-saving mode and one overnight charge would  last 3 days.
B00COYOAYW,16,19,Phone keeps shutting off, even after battery is fully charged.
B00COYOAYW,16,20,Apparently all it needed was a little charging.
B00COYOAYW,16,21,I was a little concerned with battery life, but it goes days between charges, which is partially a reflection on how little I use the phone each day.
B00COYOAYW,16,22,The battery is just over 1/2 charged now.-
B00COYOAYW,16,23,When I plug it in, it says its charging so I've been charging it for a couple of hours but the phone still won't turn on.
B00COYOAYW,16,24,I had no issues, battery lasts long enough.
B00COYOAYW,17,0,Calls drop sporadically.
B00COYOAYW,17,1,i couldn't use my headphone to listen to music because the sound was really bad, so that I had to buy a new headphone.
B00COYOAYW,17,2,When on speaker it's not clear at all.
B00COYOAYW,17,3,The only bad thing about it is that every time I drop it it turns of immediately.overall
B00COYOAYW,17,4,My calls drop and my bluetooth keeps getting disconnected.
B00COYOAYW,17,5,Most of the time when I receive calls I never even get them mainly because the phone has turned off.
B00COYOAYW,17,6,I've tried with turning off the screen while on the call - the same issue.
B00COYOAYW,17,7,By the time I turn on the car engine and back out my driveway, it is always connected.
B00COYOAYW,17,8,no problems with poor connections or dropped calls after 3-4 weeks.2.
B00COYOAYW,17,9,Others sometimes have a hard time hearing me.
B00COYOAYW,17,10,The most important feature for me is that I can hear people clearly without static or disturbance through the connection.
B00COYOAYW,17,11,They didn't fix the problem!
B00COYOAYW,17,12,Listen up people!!!
B00COYOAYW,17,13,Web worked well, calls came in clear and I could hear what the other person was saying, it had some okay apps...not really an app person.
B00COYOAYW,17,14,Always getting cut off....dropping calls.
B00COYOAYW,17,15,have had this phone since November and the audio or speakers are horrible.
B00COYOAYW,17,16,The headphone jack!
B00COYOAYW,17,17,But then a couple of weeks ago I started noticing dropped calls and bad call quality; calls would break up or become full of static.
B00COYOAYW,17,18,The speaker is also loud as others have mentioned.
B00COYOAYW,17,19,I would have to turn the Samsung Bluetooth on and off to get it connected.
B00COYOAYW,17,20,Loud Speaker.
B00COYOAYW,17,21,A piece of crap.
B00COYOAYW,17,22,Using it for a month now, and people tell me it sounds like cell quality.
B00COYOAYW,17,23,He would go to call someone and the phone would just not do the call.
B00COYOAYW,17,24,It even supports HD Voice calls because my mother is using it and when she calls (I have a Nexus 5) the call has SKYPE quality sound!
B00COYOAYW,18,0,Overall ,good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,1,The camera is not that good.
B00COYOAYW,18,2,GOOD.
B00COYOAYW,18,3,I do not have nothing good to say about this phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,4,Camera is too bad.
B00COYOAYW,18,5,its a good phone when it comes to being a phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,6,Good Phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,7,It Be Good.
B00COYOAYW,18,8,good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,9,Very good camera too.
B00COYOAYW,18,10,so far so good.
B00COYOAYW,18,11,As for the good, the camera is ....ok.
B00COYOAYW,18,12,The camera doesn't even have a flash.
B00COYOAYW,18,13,No Good Nokia!
B00COYOAYW,18,14,Good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,15,So far, so good!
B00COYOAYW,18,16,good otherwise
B00COYOAYW,18,17,better than expected.
B00COYOAYW,18,18,Good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,19,good phonr.
B00COYOAYW,18,20,Camera takes good pictures as long as there is light.-There
B00COYOAYW,18,21,This phone is pretty good.
B00COYOAYW,18,22,Good value for the price, thank you very much
B00COYOAYW,18,23,pretty good:-)
B00COYOAYW,18,24,this phone executes that really well. it doesn't have a front camera.
B00COYOAYW,19,0,SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,1,Sim Card is used.
B00COYOAYW,19,2,They both come with sim cards and you should be able to do it yourself.
B00COYOAYW,19,3,Comes with SIM card (fyi).
B00COYOAYW,19,4,It came with a sim card, but I took my old T-Mobile sim card, and cut it to fit.
B00COYOAYW,19,5,So, don't through away the sim that comes with the lumia 521; you might need it if your old phone doesn't have a micro sim card.
B00COYOAYW,19,6,You have to install the micro sim card unless you already have one.
B00COYOAYW,19,7,Otherwise, you would need to activate the new SIM card which comes with the phone and that renders the old SIM card worthless.Contacts Import:Another fail.
B00COYOAYW,19,8,They mentioned that they don't cut sim cards, but they could transfer my information to a micro sim card.
B00COYOAYW,19,9,Bought two different sim cards through t mobile still didn't work.
B00COYOAYW,19,10,SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,19,11,SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,19,12,We just swapped out the SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,13,I went to Tmobile and they activated the new SIM card and transferred all data from the old SIM card and turned on my new phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,14,The sim card that came with this new phone could not load my old account onto it when I got the new phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,15,i would have kept it if my sim card was compatible...
B00COYOAYW,19,16,Could not use my current SIM card in the device because it takes a mini sim and I have a regular size sim card
B00COYOAYW,19,17,Sim Card Sucks.
B00COYOAYW,19,18,Buy a sim card from t mobile any3.activate it online not from a phone use your phone lMElNumber,sim card number,activation code4.pick
B00COYOAYW,19,19,We ahd to purchase another sim card from T Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,19,20,The back plate is removable to access the micro-SD card, sim card and battery.
B00COYOAYW,19,21,No memory.
B00COYOAYW,19,22,I am very disappointed with this purchase and found that the sim card was already used.
B00COYOAYW,19,23,After charging it, I needed to insert my SIM card from my old phone.The SIM Card:The SIM card slot is underneath the battery and smaller than the one I was using from a phone about 3 years old.
B00COYOAYW,19,24,I only need to buy prepaid cards from T-mobile.
B00COYOAYW,20,0,How do i return it?
B00COYOAYW,20,1,So I returned it.
B00COYOAYW,20,2,Quit working, no return to Amazon.
B00COYOAYW,20,3,After I received and used it, this item works like a champ.
B00COYOAYW,20,4,I returned it and got my money back.
B00COYOAYW,20,5,The phone stopped working less than 2 weeks after I received it.
B00COYOAYW,20,6,I tried to return it to Amazon but they said I had missed the return date and would not take it back, so much for Amazon's return policy.
B00COYOAYW,20,7,stop working within a month.
B00COYOAYW,20,8,Received the phone on time and in working order.
B00COYOAYW,20,9,to purchase another phone since could not get this phone to work.
B00COYOAYW,20,10,Works like a champ.
B00COYOAYW,20,11,When asked to return or try and replace it I was told no and it was one day after the 30 day warranty this happened.
B00COYOAYW,20,12,Ordered two and neither of them worked.
B00COYOAYW,20,13,There is no warranty for this item.
B00COYOAYW,20,14,I am really disappointed with this phone purchase.
B00COYOAYW,20,15,It took them a whole 6 days after I ordered to even ship the item.
B00COYOAYW,20,16,Got it just in time for Valentines day ï¿½ it was also brand new in the box
B00COYOAYW,20,17,No time to wait!
B00COYOAYW,20,18,Would've returned it if I still have box it came in.
B00COYOAYW,20,19,It is a waste of money.
B00COYOAYW,20,20,We returned.
B00COYOAYW,20,21,I am thinking the seller sent me a refurbished one.
B00COYOAYW,20,22,Be careful when you purchase this product.
B00COYOAYW,20,23,Btw one came that would not charge and I returned it no problem to amazon and got a replacement phone even before I had shipped the broken one ...kudos amazon !
B00COYOAYW,20,24,I returned the phone to Amazon and got a replacement.
B00COYOAYW,21,0,Then I called T-mobile customer support and they found that the settings was the problem.
B00COYOAYW,21,1,It was not the phone, it was the service provider.
B00COYOAYW,21,2,I contacted Nokia customer service.
B00COYOAYW,21,3,No service even though it showed service in my area online at T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,21,4,Not sure if it's the device or T-Mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,21,5,T-mobile stores said it is the problem with the phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,6,to purchase another phone since could not get this phone to work.
B00COYOAYW,21,7,I got the same problem in the replacement and T-mobile stores could not fix the problem.
B00COYOAYW,21,8,This is the worst customer service I have ever had regrading a cell phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,9,It took some talking to customer service to get it working correctly, but once they got it fixed, it worked well for about a month or two.
B00COYOAYW,21,10,To start with, I had problems with the phone as it would come-up with T-mobile and then no service.
B00COYOAYW,21,11,so i bought it and added TMOBILE  to it,  prepaid service.
B00COYOAYW,21,12,Nothing has worked.
B00COYOAYW,21,13,dont buy.
B00COYOAYW,21,14,T-Mobile also, provides code to unlock the phone after 40 days of services.
B00COYOAYW,21,15,It did show service when I checked online before I purchased the phone but upon receiving the phone I found we had zero service.
B00COYOAYW,21,16,It turns out there is a problem with the phone.I went to T-Mobile in February and they took $20 from me and arranged to have a new phone sent to me.
B00COYOAYW,21,17,Contact your customer service center for the unlock code.
B00COYOAYW,21,18,Quit working, no return to Amazon.
B00COYOAYW,21,19,The customer service representative said he the problem would be escalated and I would be contacted later in the day.Despite being told I would be contacted again, I was not contacted.April 28, 2014, today, I called Nokia customer care.
B00COYOAYW,21,20,Tech support ultimately suggested that the problem might be the phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,21,phone not unlocked.
B00COYOAYW,21,22,I was told that I would be receiving a t-mobile phone and I received a Metro-PCS phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,23,Poor product quality and poor customer service.
B00COYOAYW,21,24,Had some issues setting up internet when I transferred sims on tmobile, still trying to work it out after a couple calls to t-mobile customer care.
B00COYOAYW,22,0,Major upgrade from my HTC MyTouch 4G.
B00COYOAYW,22,1,The device can be used.
B00COYOAYW,22,2,What an upgrade from Android!
B00COYOAYW,22,3,I think its better, and faster than an android phone, no it is faster.
B00COYOAYW,22,4,I had purchase others devices and the experiences have been better than this one.
B00COYOAYW,22,5,I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.
B00COYOAYW,22,6,And Android... don't even get me started.
B00COYOAYW,22,7,The only problem i had was having to go from my usual big screen 4.7 screens to an actual 4.0 one.
B00COYOAYW,22,8,There is no front-facing camera (don't care), 8 gb internal storage, 512 Ram, and a 1 ghz dual-core snapdragon processor.
B00COYOAYW,22,9,Since purchasing this phone, I've also picked up a Samsung Galaxy S4 & an HTC One.
B00COYOAYW,22,10,I though I was upgrading to a better phone, I had a galaxy s android.
B00COYOAYW,22,11,I still own the original Samsung Galaxy S. It has never given me any upsetting issues comparing with the new Window Nokia Lumia.
B00COYOAYW,22,12,If your are looking for a phone with all the apps, purchase an Android or Apple phone.
B00COYOAYW,22,13,It is more fluid than the nexus 4 and just as smooth as the iPhone 5S; it just goes to show how amazing the software is optimized.
B00COYOAYW,22,14,After buying this phone, I used it less than a week before switching back to my Android.
B00COYOAYW,22,15,Great phone at an even better price.
B00COYOAYW,22,16,I've been wondering if there are any impending updates to fix these annoying issues.
B00COYOAYW,22,17,OK, so I know this is supposed to be a review of the phone; it's hardware and software.
B00COYOAYW,22,18,I could've bought an obsolete version of an IOS or Android device for more money than this.
B00COYOAYW,22,19,We have since upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy Light, and guess what?
B00COYOAYW,22,20,I use wi-fi when possible and it stays at 4G...I wanted to get the new IPhone 5...
B00COYOAYW,22,21,GREAT value for a phone as smooth as an iPhone.
B00COYOAYW,22,22,The battery life is better than my old Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
B00COYOAYW,22,23,Contrary to what I read online, I don't see the storage or RAM limitations as a major issue - 1 gb is the upper-limit for Nokia's phones at this time, and I do not tend to heavily multi-task.
B00COYOAYW,22,24,Win8 is much faster than I expected with no lag.Also runs all of the new Windows apps, unlike the no contract Androids that are running 2 year old "Honeycomb" that cannot run new Android software.Overall, great hardware for the price.
B00COYOAYW,23,0,For the non-technical type, like myself, the instructions were impossible to follow.
B00COYOAYW,23,1,This phone was impossible to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,2,Impossible to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,3,I have nothing bad to say about the phone, it does every thing i need it to do.
B00COYOAYW,23,4,but i read reviews before buying it and i did not read any type saying that they had the type of problems I'm having.
B00COYOAYW,23,5,It has a tendency to change settings inexplicably.
B00COYOAYW,23,6,The manual instruction does not give good explanation on how use different things on the phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,7,It works almost fine now I still have a few more things left to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,8,2 small things wrong..
B00COYOAYW,23,9,new to this type of phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,10,It's intuitive to set up and easy to use.
B00COYOAYW,23,11,Easy to use phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,12,I ordered 2 of these phones and so far the other phone is working just fine.
B00COYOAYW,23,13,Our (very cynical) conclusion is Microsoft is doing their Microsoft thing... hoping that their customers will figure out what the problem is.
B00COYOAYW,23,14,I haven't figured out most of the features yet, and probably never will.
B00COYOAYW,23,15,The real thing.
B00COYOAYW,23,16,When I type "scrip" it anticipates that "envelopes" will follow.
B00COYOAYW,23,17,its real easy to use
B00COYOAYW,23,18,then the exact same thing happend.
B00COYOAYW,23,19,Find it difficult to understand how people take their phones wherever they go as though they might miss something important.
B00COYOAYW,23,20,took long time to get it to work had to call several people to figure out what was wrong finally called people made the phone and they fixed it
B00COYOAYW,23,21,the keyboard does not react sometimes
B00COYOAYW,23,22,I like having the "back" button below the screen as it's always easy to find.
B00COYOAYW,23,23,The interface is easy to use and only takes a few minutes to figure out how to find things and customize the display.
B00COYOAYW,23,24,I think it is an ego thing where people feel they are very important.
B00COYOAYW,24,0,After i press the power button, it shows "goodbye", then screen turn black.
B00COYOAYW,24,1,First, there're bubbles and lines under the screen film.
B00COYOAYW,24,2,I've tried with turning off the screen while on the call - the same issue.
B00COYOAYW,24,3,I wish they'd put that bing button on the left tho.
B00COYOAYW,24,4,There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time.
B00COYOAYW,24,5,However, you cannot open 2 apps at the same time, so every time you change to another application you have to start all over.
B00COYOAYW,24,6,Just flicking the screen sometmes will take you to a fb page that you havent seen before!
B00COYOAYW,24,7,The power button is accidently pressed all the time.
B00COYOAYW,24,8,It did come in a timely manner.
B00COYOAYW,24,9,Maybe the screen lock can be worked around.
B00COYOAYW,24,10,Only locked up once but was able to hold power/lock button down and restart it.
B00COYOAYW,24,11,Power button: It's on the side.
B00COYOAYW,24,12,I don't like the way the phone calls are set up, I am use to missed, placed, dial, etc.
B00COYOAYW,24,13,I hit the power button on the side, and I got the screen that said slide down to power off - hurray for physical buttons - but touching the screen still produced no results.
B00COYOAYW,24,14,The the screen would turn off even when  I am trying to call out and then the power/screen  button is intermitent working 3. the Speaker is really muffled and has a high tone level4.
B00COYOAYW,24,15,And a few times, the touch screen has become unresponsive.
B00COYOAYW,24,16,I have had this phone for almost a month now and I really like it; however, sometime it freezes and when you try to click on any of the apps , it does not open which causes me to turn it off and on again so....
B00COYOAYW,24,17,The delete call option is actually easier and quicker to use than the options menu and buttons on the X2.
B00COYOAYW,24,18,The screen just goes black and I have to wait for some time for it to react.
B00COYOAYW,24,19,everything is OK, but sometime the screen turn off automatically.
B00COYOAYW,24,20,If you miss the vibration or ring, then you don't know you got a text/call until the next time you turn the phone on.Sigh.
B00COYOAYW,24,21,The power button does not respond when it freezes.
B00COYOAYW,24,22,watch the buttons on the side.
B00COYOAYW,24,23,volume buttons suck.
B00COYOAYW,24,24,Even the buttons come off with the cover!
B00COYOAYW,25,0,The phone is just used to call and text.
B00COYOAYW,25,1,I use my phone, well, to make phone call and send text messages.
B00COYOAYW,25,2,I can make calls get texts and pictures text.
B00COYOAYW,25,3,It tries to send text and email messages ONCE and that's it.
B00COYOAYW,25,4,I had set wi-fi calling as wi-fi only.
B00COYOAYW,25,5,Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.
B00COYOAYW,25,6,I wanted a phone for wi-fi calling and no data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,7,They need a phone for calls, texts, and checking their email.
B00COYOAYW,25,8,It ok if you don't like picture messages.
B00COYOAYW,25,9,So, wherever there is no wifi, I can only talk and text.
B00COYOAYW,25,10,I call that INVASION OF PRIVACY!
B00COYOAYW,25,11,The only problem that we have found is that it will not send picture texts (maybe because we are not paying for data, we only use the wifi).
B00COYOAYW,25,12,However this phone did make wi-fi calls and allow internet access without a data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,13,can't get on internet,can't access facebook,can't send pictures just not satified with it.
B00COYOAYW,25,14,unless wifi calling (wifi calling is free).
B00COYOAYW,25,15,It will use Wi-Fi seamlessly to make phone calls - when my gf calls me over the Wi-Fi it still shows as her phone number calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,16,It makes phone calls, allows me to send texts and so much more.
B00COYOAYW,25,17,Then use Wi-Fi for data where available.
B00COYOAYW,25,18,T-mobile wifi calling.*
B00COYOAYW,25,19,The phone goes two days or more for me, but I only make calls and texts.
B00COYOAYW,25,20,I pay $50 a mo for unltd text, data, calls...
B00COYOAYW,25,21,Each time I made one call and sent once text, then put his SIM back into his phone.
B00COYOAYW,25,22,Phone calls are clear and the phone also comes with Wi-Fi calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,23,It has wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,24,wifi calling keeps taking over at home and prevents multimedia messaging.other
B004T36GCU,0,0,The size and the screen is good.
B004T36GCU,0,1,may be good.
B004T36GCU,0,2,Even with a 780p display, the colors are vivid with the S-LCD screen.*Conclusion*A

B004T36GCU,0,7,Beautiful screen - 4.3" is a perfect size, clear and sharp2.
B004T36GCU,0,8,Great Screen, Fast Processor, Awful Battery.
B004T36GCU,0,9,the battery is not good.
B004T36GCU,0,10,The phone feels solid.
B004T36GCU,0,11,THE PHONE IS NICE.
B004T36GCU,0,12,Brightness of the screen is an issue in sunlight.
B004T36GCU,0,13,Nice.
B004T36GCU,0,14,Very Good phone for the price.
B004T36GCU,0,15,The display is large yet the phone is small and thin enough to fit into a pocket.
B004T36GCU,0,16,The display is amazing, the touch screen is flawless.
B004T36GCU,0,17,Small and easy to carry with one hand.
B004T36GCU,0,18,It's pretty fast.
B004T36GCU,0,19,Picture quality is also good.
B004T36GCU,0,20,For most of the HTCs, their big screen is the only attractive thing about it.
B004T36GCU,0,21,Camera is awesome, and the size is great.
B004T36GCU,0,22,After doing this the battery seems to do pretty good.
B004T36GCU,0,23,I then got the Ultimate Juice Defender app, and so far, sooooo good!
B004T36GCU,0,24,This is a nice device.
B004T36GCU,1,0,Great Phone.
B004T36GCU,1,1,But, unbeknownst to me, some apps can cause blockers.
B004T36GCU,1,2,I love this phone, is the best phone i ever had, only the android os version is old, need an actualization
B004T36GCU,1,3,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,1,4,Love the the phone, my only issue is, i am still trying to download the BB app, other than that the phone is great!
B004T36GCU,1,5,The Google Play market is perfection, the speed of downloading apps is pretty remarkable, too.
B004T36GCU,1,6,Love it.
B004T36GCU,1,7,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,1,8,It's also my first smart phone I've owned, and I'm pretty biased towards the Android market; I have no plans of ever owning an iPhone.
B004T36GCU,1,9,Wifi and Android performs identically to a Samsung tablet with the same 2.3 operating system.
B004T36GCU,1,10,This phone will not download google apps.
B004T36GCU,1,11,Does not download google apps!!
B004T36GCU,1,12,Easy to use, many features, many pre-down loaded apps, great price, highly suggest.
B004T36GCU,1,13,there are many fantastic apps you can get for these phones and it's far less restricted from apple's market from what I understand.
B004T36GCU,1,14,I am with T-Mobile and could not have all the apps.
B004T36GCU,1,15,I wish I knew which apps caused it.
B004T36GCU,1,16,The online features allow for four windows to be opened at once, and it's easy to navigate and use the finger-pinch movement to zoom in or out of a page.
B004T36GCU,1,17,The phone works and I can run apps on it.
B004T36GCU,1,18,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,1,19,It drops service when I am googling or doing something else,  i.e. using navigation or other application.
B004T36GCU,1,20,The layout is user-friendly--it's easy to get from the main menu to apps to the phone features, and it allows you to pick your favorite apps for the main menu.
B004T36GCU,1,21,I am somewhat of a rookie when it comes to smartphones so am not the best critic, but there is a lot with this phone that I'm not happy with.
B004T36GCU,1,22,It's a good phone with a lot of features and some flaws.
B004T36GCU,1,23,The best phone in the world has a great screen and downloads so fast and takes great pictures but battery doesnt last no time and i guess thats the down side to having a great phone theres always going to be cons.
B004T36GCU,1,24,It vanishes when you use gps or wi-fi.
B004T36GCU,2,0,great phone.
B004T36GCU,2,1,So overall I'd say this is a great product for a great price.
B004T36GCU,2,2,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,2,3,Very good phone for the price!
B004T36GCU,2,4,Good smart phone for a little price!
B004T36GCU,2,5,Great price.
B004T36GCU,2,6,Good phone at a cheap price.
B004T36GCU,2,7,Very Good phone for the price.
B004T36GCU,2,8,Good phone for cheap price.
B004T36GCU,2,9,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,2,10,not such a great smartphone.
B004T36GCU,2,11,The phone is just great.
B004T36GCU,2,12,Good Product.
B004T36GCU,2,13,so far so good.
B004T36GCU,2,14,Good Product.
B004T36GCU,2,15,Not all that great!
B004T36GCU,2,16,I think i got it for a good deal.
B004T36GCU,2,17,This is a cool samrt phone and the price is just as great.
B004T36GCU,2,18,NOT VERY GOOD PRODUCT.
B004T36GCU,2,19,So far so good.
B004T36GCU,2,20,GREAT DEAL.
B004T36GCU,2,21,a great phone so far...
B004T36GCU,2,22,Good quality phone, do not regret purchase.
B004T36GCU,2,23,I am somewhat of a rookie when it comes to smartphones so am not the best critic, but there is a lot with this phone that I'm not happy with.
B004T36GCU,2,24,pretty good.
B004T36GCU,3,0,Other phones that I have owned, the battery life had lasted me 3 or 4 days.
B004T36GCU,3,1,Great phone, but no battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,2,the battery is not good.
B004T36GCU,3,3,I have to charge it atleast once a day.
B004T36GCU,3,4,Good! i really like this phone except its batery life.
B004T36GCU,3,5,Great Phone but bad battery.
B004T36GCU,3,6,Great for about 30 days.
B004T36GCU,3,7,Very good smart phone.Everything is good, except that the battery is not strong enough, and could just last for one day long...
B004T36GCU,3,8,battery wasn't good and got replaced.
B004T36GCU,3,9,it lasts 2-3 days most for me.
B004T36GCU,3,10,The battery is so-so--you have to charge it every night but sometimes the battery will last great all day and then others, it's down to yellow before dinner, and there are no more programs running on it than any other day.
B004T36GCU,3,11,I run CyanogenMod 7.2.0 on this device with the TalonACE CFS kernel which results in good battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,12,I did not rate battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,13,The only bad thing about it is the battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,14,so far so good.
B004T36GCU,3,15,Because others said their phone was good.
B004T36GCU,3,16,Still discovering features.Battery life is only good for a day.
B004T36GCU,3,17,Didnt like the way screen felt ... Phone didnt last a day with out giving me problems.. Wasnt charging right and battery just didnt seem any good...
B004T36GCU,3,18,The phone is pretty good in all aspects except battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,19,The phone freezes all the time so i have to take the battery out to unfreeze it.
B004T36GCU,3,20,it won't charge anymore unless i put something between the battery and battery door to make the battery go all the way in and seat better.
B004T36GCU,3,21,Great Phone but Batt Life sucks.
B004T36GCU,3,22,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,3,23,So it gets pretty heavy use, and two charges a day when I am in my vehicle or at my desk seems to work out well.
B004T36GCU,3,24,The phone is good.
B004T36GCU,4,0,Not good for anything else.
B004T36GCU,4,1,I am sure it was probably a good phone.
B004T36GCU,4,2,The phone is good.
B004T36GCU,4,3,Really good.
B004T36GCU,4,4,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,4,5,Picture quality is also good.
B004T36GCU,4,6,Everything works great.
B004T36GCU,4,7,It works great!
B004T36GCU,4,8,The call sound is pretty good and the speaker phone works well.
B004T36GCU,4,9,Excellent so far.
B004T36GCU,4,10,Phone reception and sound quality are an issue.
B004T36GCU,4,11,Sound in speaker very bad, internet hoop up, is good, screen was good also.
B004T36GCU,4,12,when listening to music with headset quality is really good, maybe even better than other phones (using quality headset).
B004T36GCU,4,13,Again, ok for just making calls.
B004T36GCU,4,14,Ok for just a phone to make and take calls.
B004T36GCU,4,15,pretty good.
B004T36GCU,4,16,Features , reception.
B004T36GCU,4,17,It had good audio quality when playing or streaming music.
B004T36GCU,4,18,Great phone...with a few flaws.
B004T36GCU,4,19,Picture messages not working, there is no reception at some places and some calls are drope out, the battery runs out fast but the video recording is clear and great
B004T36GCU,4,20,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,4,21,The phone look nice, some features are ok, but it has a grand problem with the signal reception.
B004T36GCU,4,22,It is a great phone, very functional, easy to handle.Great pictures and videos.I recommend it.
B004T36GCU,4,23,It's a good phone with a lot of features and some flaws.
B004T36GCU,4,24,After doing this the battery seems to do pretty good.
B004T36GCU,5,0,The picture is great and the camera is great.
B004T36GCU,5,1,Great camera
B004T36GCU,5,2,I would give it five star but no front camera will only get it four.
B004T36GCU,5,3,The only thing I am missing is a front camera for video calls.
B004T36GCU,5,4,Camera 8MP is good, but some pictures once token can not be stored if you use flash.
B004T36GCU,5,5,a great phone so far...
B004T36GCU,5,6,Other than that is pretty good phone.
B004T36GCU,5,7,The 8Mp camera is like cell phone camera, not like any kind of 8Mp camera.
B004T36GCU,5,8,It's a really great smart phone for a little price!The only thing that needs it's a back camera for video calls!But all the rest it's a great phone I'm very pleased!
B004T36GCU,5,9,Good smart phone for a little price!
B004T36GCU,5,10,Lacks of a front camera and rear camera below average.
B004T36GCU,5,11,This is a great phone, it is fast, the display is awesome, touch is great, camera is great and it has everything you would expect from an advanced first line smart phone.
B004T36GCU,5,12,It has good picture quality for a phone it is sensitive to movement when taking the pictures.
B004T36GCU,5,13,Plus, as it's supposed to be a 4G phone,  there is no front camera.
B004T36GCU,5,14,This is a cool samrt phone and the price is just as great.
B004T36GCU,5,15,Because it has 8 megapixels I was expected the camera to be sharp with great resolution.
B004T36GCU,5,16,the battery is not good.
B004T36GCU,5,17,Camera - 8MP is amazing and very high quality3.
B004T36GCU,5,18,The camera is decent, but the flash is a true champion, with two LEDs that are visible from at least half a mile away.
B004T36GCU,5,19,Because others said their phone was good.
B004T36GCU,5,20,The call sound is pretty good and the speaker phone works well.
B004T36GCU,5,21,i like it and it has no problems but the problem is it does not have a front facing camera so i cant skype my family anymore but i love htc its the best.
B004T36GCU,5,22,I then got the Ultimate Juice Defender app, and so far, sooooo good!
B004T36GCU,5,23,It has a dual flash which also works great for the built in flashlight app.
B004T36GCU,5,24,Very good cell phone.
B004T36GCU,6,0,Not working.
B004T36GCU,6,1,The 8gig SD card is missing, but I had another one to use.
B004T36GCU,6,2,No micro sd card.
B004T36GCU,6,3,Even adding an SD card, that's still not valid.
B004T36GCU,6,4,The phone works and I can run apps on it.
B004T36GCU,6,5,The phone works well.
B004T36GCU,6,6,Just insert your sim card n use.
B004T36GCU,6,7,this phone has only one sim card and a SD card which is not a sim card so make sure it has what the description says.
B004T36GCU,6,8,SD Card issues.
B004T36GCU,6,9,And cant seem to read the sim card at times.
B004T36GCU,6,10,First off the phone came without the 8g sd card that it said it came with, Thank goodness I bought a 32g card when i bought the phone.
B004T36GCU,6,11,the order should have sd ram memory with it, but their was no sd memory, I need my 8GB memory please
B004T36GCU,6,12,The phone works fine but i can see the guts of the phone while am using it.
B004T36GCU,6,13,It works just fine.
B004T36GCU,6,14,Also suggest you have a microSD with a lot of memory cause the phone memory is not sufficient.
B004T36GCU,6,15,I don't like this phone because it wouldn't ready my memory card.
B004T36GCU,6,16,I put my SIM card in it and it kept saying "No SIM card in phone".
B004T36GCU,6,17,given all the fingerprints e tc this phone was not n.ew. the phone could not read my sim card and could n ot read my SD card T Mobile
B004T36GCU,6,18,An other thing that I don't like is that when I download applications some of them won't go on the SD card and can only be in the phone memory.
B004T36GCU,6,19,Works fine.
B004T36GCU,6,20,Doesn't have enough memory space.
B004T36GCU,6,21,It is fast and the memory is good.I would buy another one.
B004T36GCU,6,22,It didn't work for me so I don't recommend it.
B004T36GCU,6,23,Not a good buy.
B004T36GCU,6,24,The phone comes with an 8gb sd card for storage of photos, games, music, ect.
B004T36GCU,7,0,i want to order one but i'm not sure if it will work good there.
B004T36GCU,7,1,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,7,2,great phone.
B004T36GCU,7,3,other than that my phone works perfectly.
B004T36GCU,7,4,Great phone ,fast arrival, working good and everything but not new.
B004T36GCU,7,5,The phone works well.
B004T36GCU,7,6,Also all I received is the phone and charger, so this phone looks like it was re-packaged.Apart from that the phone works and seems in good condition but definately not new.
B004T36GCU,7,7,It was not good.
B004T36GCU,7,8,However I would recommend that you purchase it works well.
B004T36GCU,7,9,Great while it lasts.
B004T36GCU,7,10,Received Unlocked phone ... but doesn't seem new.
B004T36GCU,7,11,The Phone I received was not new.
B004T36GCU,7,12,Also I have interruption while talking, and this is all the time.
B004T36GCU,7,13,The phone didn't work at all because there was previous water damage.
B004T36GCU,7,14,The phone was damaged and did not work.
B004T36GCU,7,15,I received an item as expected, new and unlocked.
B004T36GCU,7,16,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,7,17,I ordered this phone because I already had one before and loved it.
B004T36GCU,7,18,Took in to my phone carrier--they said it had water damage before I received it.
B004T36GCU,7,19,i received item and the battery was not working i sent an email to the buyer, he right away sent me another one, even though its not working properly but i think its good for the price
B004T36GCU,7,20,Not all that great!
B004T36GCU,7,21,LOVED THIS PHONE.
B004T36GCU,7,22,Item not it A-1 condition.
B004T36GCU,7,23,the item i received.
B004T36GCU,7,24,When i purchased this phone i didnt expect it to be like this.
B004T36GCU,8,0,wasnt working.
B004T36GCU,8,1,Did not work right on T-Mobile.
B004T36GCU,8,2,Service at Home.

B004T36GCU,9,6,Very Good phone for the price.
B004T36GCU,9,7,Not the latest, but works great.
B004T36GCU,9,8,I run CyanogenMod 7.2.0 on this device with the TalonACE CFS kernel which results in good battery life.

B004T36GCU,9,16,It has lots of RAM, a fast processor, and a great camera in good lighting.I've owned three HTC Inspires in less than 9 months.
B004T36GCU,9,17,I had never had HTC mobile, It works very well, no black out, battery ok, great sound, good processing speed.
B004T36GCU,9,18,Htc inspire.
B004T36GCU,9,19,I like HTC inspire.
B004T36GCU,9,20,first off i must say the htc inspire 4g is an awesome phone .
B004T36GCU,9,21,This phone has great specs for most users who do not need the latest, fastest, dual-core hype.
B004T36GCU,9,22,I was an ATT customer when I bought this phone and the 4g was really fast, faster than my ATT DSL.
B004T36GCU,9,23,Everything works perfectly and smoothly.
B004T36GCU,9,24,HTC A9192 Inspire.
B004T36GCU,10,0,I did love it so much.

B004T36GCU,10,5,I love it.
B004T36GCU,10,6,I love to have that phone.
B004T36GCU,10,7,Love this phone as it has so many funcitons and features I can use.
B004T36GCU,10,8,I love this phone, everything about it is awesome.
B004T36GCU,10,9,I love this phone.
B004T36GCU,10,10,working good, fast,easy to use.
B004T36GCU,10,11,Excelente equipo y fÃ¡cil de utilizar el unico punto negativo es que la bateria no dura mucho y el telefono es un poco pesado
B004T36GCU,10,12,Love it.
B004T36GCU,10,13,I would recommend the phone for anyone from casual user up to those that love their gadgets.
B004T36GCU,10,14,My kids love it for the easy to manouvre
B004T36GCU,10,15,It is easy to operate.I recommend it.
B004T36GCU,10,16,I have already recommended it to my friends, I phone has everything that I needed.
B004T36GCU,10,17,Yo realicÃ© esta queja al recibir el producto, peero lo hice por un canal equivocado,
B004T36GCU,10,18,NOT ALL FEATURES WORK.
B004T36GCU,10,19,Mi queja es la siguiente, llegÃ³ la caja conteniendo el celular solicitado con dos cuestiones, primero faltaba la memory card que se especifica en el contenido de la caja y segundo es evidente que en la malla que cubre lo que seria el auriular, que es la vista del equipo, estÃ¡ como torcida, eso debe ser defecto de fabrica.
B004T36GCU,10,20,Although, I haven't found a way to update the software but its nice i love it.
B004T36GCU,10,21,All other features work well and the phone has a nice layout.
B004T36GCU,10,22,I love HTC. this phone was so good.
B004T36GCU,10,23,I will recommend it.!
B004T36GCU,10,24,Extremely well packaged!! Absolutely love it!UPDATE: I loved this phone for the first 2-3 months.
B004T36GCU,11,0,It was not good.
B004T36GCU,11,1,when I would lay it down it would turn off and the volume button was broke off... but other than that phone looked new
B004T36GCU,11,2,worked great but kept shutting off and volume button was broke.
B004T36GCU,11,3,Not good for anything else.
B004T36GCU,11,4,The phone is good.
B004T36GCU,11,5,Really good.
B004T36GCU,11,6,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,11,7,as long as I was using it it was good but.
B004T36GCU,11,8,A very good phone, but it comes locked...
B004T36GCU,11,9,Generally good transition for this ex-Apple-phone user.
B004T36GCU,11,10,A good phone with low ringing tone.
B004T36GCU,11,11,fits my need very well, but i have to say, the volume button on the left actually doesn't work very well.
B004T36GCU,11,12,Great camera
B004T36GCU,11,13,other than that my phone works perfectly.
B004T36GCU,11,14,This phone was  locked and was not new and did not have a manual.
B004T36GCU,11,15,Annoying.
B004T36GCU,11,16,Phone is too square for me, I prefer taller and skinny easier to hold.
B004T36GCU,11,17,At first I thought it was the server and changed to 3 different server but nothing worked.
B004T36GCU,11,18,I run CyanogenMod 7.2.0 on this device with the TalonACE CFS kernel which results in good battery life.
B004T36GCU,11,19,phone looks new, but came with something off volume button to work properly detached hope I will be in contact after trying all functions as it supposed to be a new phone.!
B004T36GCU,11,20,Just an average design.
B004T36GCU,11,21,great phone.
B004T36GCU,11,22,i gotta push it so HARD to turn the volume down, it's the only flaw.
B004T36GCU,11,23,If you are in an area with spotty service this phone doesnt work for some reason.
B004T36GCU,11,24,just kept shutting off.
B004T36GCU,12,0,Great while it lasts.
B004T36GCU,12,1,It's a waste of money.
B004T36GCU,12,2,It's a waste of money.
B004T36GCU,12,3,Would probably look for something else next time
B004T36GCU,12,4,why cant i browse using my mobile network data?
B004T36GCU,12,5,I should say I have not taken it to my plan carriers to check out yet.
B004T36GCU,12,6,well at least with the features I can access . . .
B004T36GCU,12,7,i want to order one but i'm not sure if it will work good there.
B004T36GCU,12,8,Great for about 30 days.
B004T36GCU,12,9,After changing all of the presets I still was not able to connect to the internet with my data plan or home wifi.
B004T36GCU,12,10,I wouldn't recommend it for any serious photography, but it works good for taking pictures of my family, pets, ect.
B004T36GCU,12,11,Hard to read, text and mail not organized very well.
B004T36GCU,12,12,This phone has one of the biggest screens on the market right now, which is great if you surf the web mainly on your phone.
B004T36GCU,12,13,I would NOT recommend this phone, any positive reviews you have read have been written by people who had not had their phone for very long and want to brag it up (because like I said when it was new it was a very nice phone).
B004T36GCU,12,14,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,12,15,Great phone from a good company.
B004T36GCU,12,16,The touchscreen is about as good as you can expect for a phone; there's only so much room you have to hit each key, and there are arrow keys that allow you to weave through emails or text messages.
B004T36GCU,12,17,Not the best.
B004T36GCU,12,18,working good, fast,easy to use.
B004T36GCU,12,19,Don't buy it worked nice for about a week but now it's really slow and doesn't well.
B004T36GCU,12,20,Voice quality of this product is not at all good, I bought it with out reading the reviews.If you are looking for a good phone with all basic features, its better not to buy this one
B004T36GCU,12,21,apart from that it is really worth that money.
B004T36GCU,12,22,dont buy this phone u will be wasting ur money had mine litteraly a month and it already stopped working
B004T36GCU,12,23,After charging, I was able to make call and send & receive messages but could not get on the network for internet services.
B004T36GCU,12,24,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,13,0,It seemed like the phone had been thrown in there, with a slightly off-set screen protector, slightly dusty too.Was it new?
B004T36GCU,13,1,However, there are many cases, where this does not work.
B004T36GCU,13,2,It has scratches on the screen and on the camera.
B004T36GCU,13,3,The phone works perfectly, with a big screen yet still a reasonable size, it's all it needs to be.
B004T36GCU,13,4,Phone was never dropped, in a hard protective case from day 1, screen protector from day 1 and now less than 6 months later the phone itself will not charge the battery.
B004T36GCU,13,5,Oh and one more thing, after a while if you are clumsy like me, the touch screen doesn't respond very well to large fingers, I have small fine fingers and I can use it with no problem.
B004T36GCU,13,6,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,13,7,A very nice HTC phone with a beautiful screen that, unfortunately, didn't work for me.
B004T36GCU,13,8,The phone has problems.
B004T36GCU,13,9,Unfortunately, the phone did not come with a battery, so I had to buy one before I could find out if it worked.
B004T36GCU,13,10,No scratches, screen was nice and came in the original box.
B004T36GCU,13,11,Disappointed big time
B004T36GCU,13,12,Nice Phone.
B004T36GCU,13,13,It was sopoussed to be phones working perfectly
B004T36GCU,13,14,In some cases, the phone will start up once you remove the battery and put it back in.
B004T36GCU,13,15,i switched back to my cracked screen phone!
B004T36GCU,13,16,This could cause it to get scratched easily, but with a case on the problem is easily solved.Overview: So really, the only con is battery life.
B004T36GCU,13,17,The phone works fine but i can see the guts of the phone while am using it.
B004T36GCU,13,18,This was not a big deal and after I put my protective case on, I can't even see them...  not that they were that bad to begin with.
B004T36GCU,13,19,The screen response is good and the screen size is big enough to watch movies.
B004T36GCU,13,20,I have problems with this phone.
B004T36GCU,13,21,It did not work for me.
B004T36GCU,13,22,I have problems with this phone I bought on February 15.
B004T36GCU,13,23,Revised review - Nice phone.
B004T36GCU,13,24,Beautiful screen - 4.3" is a perfect size, clear and sharp2.
B004T36GCU,14,0,Don't get if you need to download apps.
B004T36GCU,14,1,This phone will not download google apps.
B004T36GCU,14,2,Does not download google apps!!
B004T36GCU,14,3,My first android.
B004T36GCU,14,4,This is why you can not buy anything on line but apps.
B004T36GCU,14,5,Every time I open it, I find the phone is running about 15 apps in the background, most of them apps that came pre-loaded on the phone, apps that I NEVER use and that I can't get rid of.
B004T36GCU,14,6,Android app store is superb.
B004T36GCU,14,7,The updates.
B004T36GCU,14,8,GPS doesn't work.
B004T36GCU,14,9,this phone is unable to download certain apps in the play store.
B004T36GCU,14,10,Also, after that reset, I never was able to load Google Play again, leaving me with the old android market app.
B004T36GCU,14,11,second the phone can not handle more then 1 or 2 apps installed from the play store.
B004T36GCU,14,12,Once certain apps get downloaded the phone starts to freeze like it has too many cookies or a small virus on it.
B004T36GCU,14,13,It updates to Android 2.3, may eventually update to 4.0, unknown so farCons:1.
B004T36GCU,14,14,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,14,15,That it is to say it wasnt working at all.
B004T36GCU,14,16,Had android 2.3(gingerbread on it) so thats a big plus.
B004T36GCU,14,17,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,14,18,window was really great.
B004T36GCU,14,19,Updates majorly slow this phone down.
B004T36GCU,14,20,Too many software issues.
B004T36GCU,14,21,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,14,22,I like the customization capability of android over the iOS.
B004T36GCU,14,23,some games freeze it up, but some do not, just have to mess around with that and figure out which games work.
B004T36GCU,14,24,I can not download games that i would like to play, such as plants vs zombies 2 and it losses the signal very easy
B004T36GCU,15,0,I bought this phone about a year ago.
B004T36GCU,15,1,I bought this phone because it was a great deal.
B004T36GCU,15,2,Bought for only 2 months and now the phone can't power-on.
B004T36GCU,15,3,I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE!!!
B004T36GCU,15,4,Bad Purchase.
B004T36GCU,15,5,I like it but it'll only last two years...
B004T36GCU,15,6,When I purchased this phone.
B004T36GCU,15,7,When I bought this phone it was good, now it has problems and I can't get a replacement because of the time that I had the phone.
B004T36GCU,15,8,I've had the phone for about 2 months now.
B004T36GCU,15,9,It's been over a month since I bought them so I can't return them.
B004T36GCU,15,10,I would not recommend anyone to buy this
B004T36GCU,15,11,I would NOT recommend buying this phone.
B004T36GCU,15,12,Dropped it once 3 months ago and nothing was wrong.When buying your phone think about how it'll work out 6 months from now before you get into a 2 year contract you can't get out of.
B004T36GCU,15,13,It is a great phone.The First one I purchased did not come unlock and it cost me $40 to get unlock.My second purchase was ok
B004T36GCU,15,14,DONT BUY TO USE OUTSIDE OF THE US.
B004T36GCU,15,15,dont buy.
B004T36GCU,15,16,I wish I have never purchased it and would not recommend it.
B004T36GCU,15,17,Good product.
B004T36GCU,15,18,the product after using it a month has started giving me problems.
B004T36GCU,15,19,Great price.
B004T36GCU,15,20,this month i am due for an upgrade and its been the worst 2 years having this phone bye bye htc not going to be buying another
B004T36GCU,15,21,My husband has this same phone and it works great.
B004T36GCU,15,22,I am not happy with this product.
B004T36GCU,15,23,DON'T BUY IT.
B004T36GCU,15,24,Then I upgraded to this phone and few months later nothing.
B004T36GCU,16,0,Missing Battery.
B004T36GCU,16,1,I tried to take the battery out and try again.
B004T36GCU,16,2,Poor battery life.
B004T36GCU,16,3,Battery issue.
B004T36GCU,16,4,Battery issues.
B004T36GCU,16,5,The battery lasts for 4 hours...
B004T36GCU,16,6,Battery Problems.
B004T36GCU,16,7,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,16,8,it won't charge anymore unless i put something between the battery and battery door to make the battery go all the way in and seat better.
B004T36GCU,16,9,Battery wasn't working.
B004T36GCU,16,10,Got to go back to Mexico with new battery next week.
B004T36GCU,16,11,Battery life is about 3/4 of a day with normal use.
B004T36GCU,16,12,Would not turn back on when i got home from work, letting it charge.
B004T36GCU,16,13,BATTERY ISSUES.
B004T36GCU,16,14,Phone would not charge after first day of use.
B004T36GCU,16,15,The battery life is just pathetic.
B004T36GCU,16,16,Glitchy and no battery life.
B004T36GCU,16,17,The phone didn't even charge.
B004T36GCU,16,18,the phone works well however the battery last very little i keep turning off the apps and remove them and same issue battery does not last ((
B004T36GCU,16,19,Am having battery problem. the battery does not last not even 3 hours straight i have to be keep charging the phone
B004T36GCU,16,20,Phone does not hold charge.
B004T36GCU,16,21,I placed in the battery and put the phone to charge, but it then shut off and would not come on at all.
B004T36GCU,16,22,FULLY CHARGED BATTERY DOES NOT LAST UP TO 24H RS, EXCEPT IF YOU DO NOT USE THE PHONE AT ALL.2.
B004T36GCU,16,23,At first, the battery takes a long time to charge and last for only few hours and now the phone is dead.
B004T36GCU,16,24,it didn't work.
B004T36GCU,17,0,when people would call they wouldnt be able to get through most of the time.
B004T36GCU,17,1,it would disconnect calls while in a call.
B004T36GCU,17,2,problem on phone.
B004T36GCU,17,3,As if that isn't bad enough, the call quality is terrible!!!
B004T36GCU,17,4,thank you for getting my phone on time,but the one thing it doesn't work very good.If u put the phone on speaker people can't hear you. is very bad that u cannot put your phone on speaker.Last buy from this seller.
B004T36GCU,17,5,I have problem with drop calls, it might be a network problem I don't know!
B004T36GCU,17,6,phone stopped working deffective phone.
B004T36GCU,17,7,I however have some issues.The maximum ring volume is not loud.
B004T36GCU,17,8,I get a lot of dropped calls also.
B004T36GCU,17,9,but it just does not work.what
B004T36GCU,17,10,Anyhow, the phone works fine.
B004T36GCU,17,11,Now my mobile's speaker is not working.
B004T36GCU,17,12,The call sound is pretty good and the speaker phone works well.
B004T36GCU,17,13,The Volume button don't work, I have audio problem.
B004T36GCU,17,14,I've tried many ways to fix it, from restart it, to call somebody and unplug headphone while talking and put it on speaker (which fixed the problem at first but that trick doesn't work now), I even tried to do factory reset way but none of these tricks work.
B004T36GCU,17,15,Phone reception and sound quality are an issue.
B004T36GCU,17,16,It has a fm radio tuner built in but it uses the ear buds as a antenna so you can't listen to the radio with bluetooth headphones.
B004T36GCU,17,17,Over all I like the phone but every once in a while the sound will go out.
B004T36GCU,17,18,While in speaker, people complain of it being too noisy.
B004T36GCU,17,19,Had some problem with the 'speaker' - hence a problem with the basic functionality.
B004T36GCU,17,20,I am used to hearing my previous phone ring wherever I am in the house, but this one I dont.
B004T36GCU,17,21,thought was great at first but two weeks later phone started giving me problems kept rebooting on its own would allow me to make calls phone was giving me lots of problems
B004T36GCU,17,22,So I got this phone a few months ago, and since the beginning it's been giving me problems when I make calls.
B004T36GCU,17,23,I can't play any music or videos unless I plug in my headphone.
B004T36GCU,17,24,But finally after 6 months of struggle with the speaker and the sound quality, the phone is dead.
B004T36GCU,18,0,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,18,1,Good phone.
B004T36GCU,18,2,Good phone.
B004T36GCU,18,3,Really Good!
B004T36GCU,18,4,not good.!!!
B004T36GCU,18,5,good.
B004T36GCU,18,6,Not good.
B004T36GCU,18,7,It isn't even really a good paperweight!!!
B004T36GCU,18,8,good phone.
B004T36GCU,18,9,Not bad.
B004T36GCU,18,10,NOt good.
B004T36GCU,18,11,This phone was no good.
B004T36GCU,18,12,So far so good.
B004T36GCU,18,13,My expectation about the phone was bad.
B004T36GCU,18,14,Everything but the camera.
B004T36GCU,18,15,Not a good choice.
B004T36GCU,18,16,VERY GOOD CONDITIONS.
B004T36GCU,18,17,It's so bad.
B004T36GCU,18,18,Better than I had expected.
B004T36GCU,18,19,bad phone.
B004T36GCU,18,20,not a bad phone.expect
B004T36GCU,18,21,bad phone.
B004T36GCU,18,22,Voice quality of this product is not at all good, I bought it with out reading the reviews.If you are looking for a good phone with all basic features, its better not to buy this one
B004T36GCU,18,23,too bad.
B004T36GCU,18,24,The camera is also very blurry, unlike the one I had before.
B004T36GCU,19,0,I put my SIM card in it and it kept saying "No SIM card in phone".
B004T36GCU,19,1,this phone has only one sim card and a SD card which is not a sim card so make sure it has what the description says.
B004T36GCU,19,2,When the phone card was placed in it, it just would not work.
B004T36GCU,19,3,This says it is an unlocked phone...yet it did not work for our t-mobile SIM card.
B004T36GCU,19,4,Put the At&t; SIM card in and was on my way!
B004T36GCU,19,5,Not possible if they don't come with an SD Card.
B004T36GCU,19,6,It does not have the SD card, I'm not sure it might be that way.
B004T36GCU,19,7,Once I put in the old sim card the phone seems to be fine.
B004T36GCU,19,8,The phone didnt came with Memory Card.
B004T36GCU,19,9,Missing MicroSD card.
B004T36GCU,19,10,not working, would not recognize the att sim card.
B004T36GCU,19,11,This device didn't work at all couldn't read any of the SIM cards.
B004T36GCU,19,12,Everything works just fine for my tmobile sim i already have.
B004T36GCU,19,13,It tells me that their is no sim in the phone.
B004T36GCU,19,14,Works well.
B004T36GCU,19,15,The SIM card did work so we could not use the apps, even if it did work we probably would have sent it back because it was not user friendly.
B004T36GCU,19,16,This phone labeled as ATT and unlocked phone, but we took it to the att to have the sim card installed,  after serveral places, the, phone never recognized the sim card.
B004T36GCU,19,17,I just placed a local store bought Sim card.Steve
B004T36GCU,19,18,Other than that phone works fine.
B004T36GCU,19,19,I ended up taking this second phone to AT&T; and having them set me up again with a new SIM card.
B004T36GCU,19,20,I indicate it because my service provider is not using micro sim cards and told me the phone uses the micro so I bought a cutter and ruined one sim card when it was not necessary to cut it.
B004T36GCU,19,21,I have T-Mobile and I was really scared that it wouldn't work because this phone got so many bad reviews on how it wouldn't read their sim cards.
B004T36GCU,19,22,I have some problems with the product.First i didn't receive the sd card and the charger is not working properly
B004T36GCU,19,23,Also the 8G MicroSD card was missing.
B004T36GCU,19,24,No Micro SD CardM.
B004T36GCU,20,0,return my money.
B004T36GCU,20,1,the phone does not work do not.
B004T36GCU,20,2,Phone works, seller doesn't.
B004T36GCU,20,3,Will be returning it.
B004T36GCU,20,4,I want to return it.
B004T36GCU,20,5,I have to work on it before it will come back on.
B004T36GCU,20,6,Had to be returned.
B004T36GCU,20,7,It hardly works.
B004T36GCU,20,8,I bought the phone and by the time i was out of the states it stopped working.
B004T36GCU,20,9,The phone didn't work at all.
B004T36GCU,20,10,Phone didn't work.
B004T36GCU,20,11,I've returned this phone probably 4-5 times and they've sent me back the same phone.. Same problems occur.
B004T36GCU,20,12,Only to keep it or return it for my money back.
B004T36GCU,20,13,It never worked!
B004T36GCU,20,14,The company has approved the return, but I am liable for return postage as well.
B004T36GCU,20,15,it does not work at all.
B004T36GCU,20,16,DOPif, if at the time of the purchase was to be of RD $ 6,386.00
B004T36GCU,20,17,I will be returning this item because I paid to much for a used phone.
B004T36GCU,20,18,Phone has no resepition, I am not using the phone at this time.
B004T36GCU,20,19,I do not know whether it had to do with just that one phone - may be defective but I had to return it to the seller.
B004T36GCU,20,20,never got this order.
B004T36GCU,20,21,Which means I have to buy that from the amazon marketplace or run after the seller to send me one.
B004T36GCU,20,22,They tried to get me a new phone but then said they didn't have one,so I returned it and still waiting for my refund.
B004T36GCU,20,23,I would be careful when buy a phone from this seller.
B004T36GCU,20,24,I must do to return the  damage phone?
B004T36GCU,21,0,it's an at&t; phone , and it's says that works on T-mobile carrier too.but,
B004T36GCU,21,1,I even went to T-mobile store, they told me they had tried it before for some other customers and it did not work well with their network.
B004T36GCU,21,2,I was told this my a customer service rep through AT&T; i am now about to receive my fourth one of these..
B004T36GCU,21,3,Neither ATT nor another one:((( what should i do?????
B004T36GCU,21,4,I called my company (T-mobile) and they helped me with that.
B004T36GCU,21,5,This may be because i am using it with T-Mobile, while it is AT&T; phone.
B004T36GCU,21,6,What a pathetic service?
B004T36GCU,21,7,DON'T BUY IT.
B004T36GCU,21,8,Had to buy another phone and get a new plan with my old company.
B004T36GCU,21,9,once I received the phone I found out I could transfer my service to the phone .sorry
B004T36GCU,21,10,Within 3 weeks it stopped working.
B004T36GCU,21,11,Some network issues are there not sure if its phone issue or network issue
B004T36GCU,21,12,Cannot get on T-Mobile data network.
B004T36GCU,21,13,Finally we decided to buy another one from T-mobile and that one is working well.
B004T36GCU,21,14,problems with this product.
B004T36GCU,21,15,buy this phoneever
B004T36GCU,21,16,If they did, I would not buy it since I don't want a ATT phone.
B004T36GCU,21,17,It locks up every other day it seems, but other than that it works ok.
B004T36GCU,21,18,cant find network!!!! Can u help me??
B004T36GCU,21,19,Numerous of their CSRs have told me this is a very common problem they get phone calls about every day.
B004T36GCU,21,20,Many of the reviews have similar complaints - the phone was defective, never worked, terrible customer service.
B004T36GCU,21,21,They are now sending me a fourth one...i wish i had never had this phone ever....the phone is great...when it actually works...I also know that this phone was recalled from walmart because i work with the cell phones there

B004T36GCU,22,23,THIS PHONE IS THE STEP-DOWN FOR ALL HTC MODELS.
B004T36GCU,22,24,htc.
B004T36GCU,23,0,haven't figured how to work it yet.
B004T36GCU,23,1,Only thing missing would have been instructions for set up.
B004T36GCU,23,2,IS THAT ABOUT I HAVE TO USE COMMONSENSE TO SET UP THE PHONE DOT KNOW IF I WILL KEEP THIS PHONE BI NEED A ENGLISH LAUNGUAGE BOOKLET.
B004T36GCU,23,3,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,23,4,They couldn't figure out what the problem was either.
B004T36GCU,23,5,I can't even use this app on this phone I just purchased because I can't change the language settings to english (us) or (uk).
B004T36GCU,23,6,Making it nearly impossible to download anything or make calls or text.
B004T36GCU,23,7,After doing some research, I had to set the wallpaper and settings to "default" which helped this problem.
B004T36GCU,23,8,then the phone wouldnt let me text certain users on my contact list.
B004T36GCU,23,9,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,23,10,I've returned this phone probably 4-5 times and they've sent me back the same phone.. Same problems occur.
B004T36GCU,23,11,doesnot contain arabic languesh and cant read arabic .
B004T36GCU,23,12,The phone was missing thing that was suppose to be included, this is the second time this happened .
B004T36GCU,23,13,It was a neat phone when it was working.
B004T36GCU,23,14,Neat phone but didn't work right.
B004T36GCU,23,15,The SIM card did work so we could not use the apps, even if it did work we probably would have sent it back because it was not user friendly.
B004T36GCU,23,16,I got this phone about a year ago and returned it for a full refund.. it worked pretty well, I remember having a few small issues with it but not what they were exactly.. one problem was the button to turn the screen off and on was so small, you had to press it extremely hard until it hurt your finger.
B004T36GCU,23,17,I think the team is good, have not much experience in this world of the smart phone, but it is well fluid've seen from HTC.The only thing I dislike about this is the time duration of the battery is exhausted soon.Another thing I do not like is that the screen is very dirty .....I give it three stars ......regards....
B004T36GCU,23,18,I reset it to factory settings and tried several other options to reclaim the voice but nothing worked.I have to return it because without voice it's not a phone, and without apps it's not a smart phone.I'm not sure what the issue is, but I did some google research and other people replaced the microphone and it worked fine.
B004T36GCU,23,19,It gets the job done and easy to figure out.
B004T36GCU,23,20,Most things are done simply, but if they not simple than they're practically hidden or can't be done, like when I was trying to get rid of the excess pages on the phone, which I still haven't been able to do.
B004T36GCU,23,21,so bad.
B004T36GCU,23,22,As if that isn't bad enough, the call quality is terrible!!!
B004T36GCU,23,23,I bought this phone with the understanding that T-Mobile would work just fine on it.
B004T36GCU,23,24,And sometimes when typing online, the keyboard will pop up and the online screem will move in such a position that I can't see what I'm typing (this is especially bad with email).
B004T36GCU,24,0,button is not working.
B004T36GCU,24,1,The phone locks up all of the time.
B004T36GCU,24,2,My complaints are that at times it shuts down without any cause and I couldn't get it to turn back on.
B004T36GCU,24,3,Granted, I have not tried anything drastic to reboot the phone, but thusfar, the power button is not restarting the phone.
B004T36GCU,24,4,the phone is unlocked, the button on the side is not working, the screen is blocked by personal password and i got the battery after aweek of waiting.
B004T36GCU,24,5,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,24,6,When I turned it on first it came on then in a few minutes a red signal came on after that I couldn't get it off the power button did not respond.
B004T36GCU,24,7,It just randomly turned back on.
B004T36GCU,24,8,The phone is slow and some times the plastic cover at the back side of bottom cames out when you try to take out from your pocket.
B004T36GCU,24,9,It kept freezing at least 3 to 4 times a day.
B004T36GCU,24,10,It locks up every other day it seems, but other than that it works ok.
B004T36GCU,24,11,The phone works ok but after half hr to an hr it shuts off an im unable to power it on back using the power button therefore I have take out the battery to power it on .
B004T36GCU,24,12,Still missed about 50% of the calls.
B004T36GCU,24,13,Sometimes it just misses a call.
B004T36GCU,24,14,It is locked phone.
B004T36GCU,24,15,Once it started up, I noticed that the left side of the phone did not work.
B004T36GCU,24,16,It will continue to do this until the user powers the screen on and off.
B004T36GCU,24,17,the phone doesnt ring or vibrate when i get a incoming call or text i've reset the phone 3 -4 times and it happens everytime.
B004T36GCU,24,18,Inherent screen freeze with this phone.
B004T36GCU,24,19,This is after shutting down Wi-Fi, changing the connection settings to preserve battery life, and keeping the screen dimmer than I prefer.
B004T36GCU,24,20,Every time I open it, I find the phone is running about 15 apps in the background, most of them apps that came pre-loaded on the phone, apps that I NEVER use and that I can't get rid of.
B004T36GCU,24,21,Hardly ideal for something you will be pressing all the time..
B004T36GCU,24,22,The phone freezes and resets its self.
B004T36GCU,24,23,It hardly works.
B004T36GCU,24,24,The phone freezes and shut down when I attempt to delete items on screen.
B004T36GCU,25,0,When I frist got the phone, it was working fine, I could send picture texts.
B004T36GCU,25,1,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,25,2,It would give me error messages when I tried to send a text message too when i did have signal.
B004T36GCU,25,3,The only way to get the phone on the internet is with wifi.
B004T36GCU,25,4,After charging, I was able to make call and send & receive messages but could not get on the network for internet services.
B004T36GCU,25,5,After changing all of the presets I still was not able to connect to the internet with my data plan or home wifi.
B004T36GCU,25,6,I have to send it back.
B004T36GCU,25,7,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,25,8,EVEN AT THAT, IT DOES NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH WI-FI SERVICE, EVEN THOUGH THE WI-FI IS VERY STRONG AND OTHER PHONES CONNECT PERFECTLY.
B004T36GCU,25,9,Still missed about 50% of the calls.
B004T36GCU,25,10,Sometimes it just misses a call.
B004T36GCU,25,11,Then after about 2 wks. it would no longer let me send picture text.
B004T36GCU,25,12,Cannot get on T-Mobile data network.
B004T36GCU,25,13,The only problem is my phones 3g wont work so I always have to look for open wi-fi.
B004T36GCU,25,14,This phone will not allow me to access the T-Mobile data network.
B004T36GCU,25,15,but i can send regular text.
B004T36GCU,25,16,Had to send it back.
B004T36GCU,25,17,When I started using the phone, a lot of things weren't functioning like picture text, no internet connection even when there is a wifi service to connect to, sometimes the phone will automatically cancel my calls & voicemails, very  very slow internet service, social networks wont log in and host of other problems.
B004T36GCU,25,18,You can use it to call and tx msg.
B004T36GCU,25,19,Features  were fine but was unable to send or receive calls so I had to return it.
B004T36GCU,25,20,Forget connecting to Wi-Fi, as you'll get about 5 minutes with that.
B004T36GCU,25,21,I get a lot of dropped calls also.
B004T36GCU,25,22,I only sometimes receive MMS messages and I can NEVER send them.I rue spending the money on this phone.
B004T36GCU,25,23,This phone is set up to be used in Canada.
B004T36GCU,25,24,I liked the phone until the wifi stopped working after 3 months for no reason.
B008HTJLF6,0,0,If you have little hands it might be a little too big.
B008HTJLF6,0,1,Great display.
B008HTJLF6,0,2,I love it's many features but mostly the screen size and quality is fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,0,3,The screen is AMAZING.
B008HTJLF6,0,4,If you're looking for a good phone with a decent screen size i would recommend the s3.
B008HTJLF6,0,5,The phone is great it is bright clear and easy to see.
B008HTJLF6,0,6,GREAT PHONE!
B008HTJLF6,0,7,The panel used to make the screen is beautifully fabricated.
B008HTJLF6,0,8,I went with the GS3, b/c I liked the bigger screen.
B008HTJLF6,0,9,Some say it feels cheap, but I don't get that at all.
B008HTJLF6,0,10,The phone itself is awesome, great camera, screen.
B008HTJLF6,0,11,the features are awesome and the size of the screen is perfect all in all its a great phone and if i had to do it over i would still make the same choice.
B008HTJLF6,0,12,Surprisingly even with the larger screen this isn't a heavy phone and feels quite comfortable in my shirt pocket.The screen is bright and clear.
B008HTJLF6,0,13,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,0,14,If you aren't used to a large screen, the S3 will take a little getting used to.
B008HTJLF6,0,15,Good phone.
B008HTJLF6,0,16,Battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,0,17,It's easy to read even in bright sunlight.Voice quality is great.
B008HTJLF6,0,18,It's very light and easy to hold for its size.
B008HTJLF6,0,19,Too Thin and too big...
B008HTJLF6,0,20,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,0,21,Hands down.
B008HTJLF6,0,22,I have small hands, and yeah, it does get a bit difficult to use the big screen sometimes, but I'm certainly not going back to a screen any smaller than this.
B008HTJLF6,0,23,Personally, I feel that the size of the phone and the slim feel are great attributes but others may find it a tad too large for their hands.
B008HTJLF6,0,24,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,1,0,Better than Iphone5 or any other Android phone out there.
B008HTJLF6,1,1,I like the android system and haven't used an iphone to compare it to.
B008HTJLF6,1,2,I have a LOT of apps.
B008HTJLF6,1,3,if you were an iphone user it will take few days to get used to android os. after that you won't look back.
B008HTJLF6,1,4,Also, although the market is catching up, there are still some apps available on the apple market that are not available on the Google play store.
B008HTJLF6,1,5,It is way much more better than iPhone4S.
B008HTJLF6,1,6,Love it more than my old iPhone.
B008HTJLF6,1,7,Great phone!
B008HTJLF6,1,8,Don't get me wrong i'm an android lover and really support all the great opportunities with android phones but compared to the newest Iphone 5 this phone does lack a little.
B008HTJLF6,1,9,Much better and faster than an Iphone!! I'M NEVER GOING BACK TO APPLE!! THIS IS THE BEST PHONE I'VE EVER HAD.
B008HTJLF6,1,10,If the iPhone was Android, I love that size.2.
B008HTJLF6,1,11,best smartphone so far - ex iphone user.
B008HTJLF6,1,12,More than iPhone.
B008HTJLF6,1,13,VERY GOOD HARDWARE--NO DATA SYNC.
B008HTJLF6,1,14,Much better than most of the phones I've had over the past 13 or so years.I really like Android 4.3.
B008HTJLF6,1,15,I would recommend this phone to any android lover or someone in search of a smartphone cheaper than an IPhone 5. Its great for apps and everyday use and is very sturdy compared to many iPhones i have seen.
B008HTJLF6,1,16,It runs all of todays apps with no problems.Cameras:
B008HTJLF6,1,17,Best phone on the market right now.
B008HTJLF6,1,18,Best phone on the market right now.
B008HTJLF6,1,19,I love the large screen!
B008HTJLF6,1,20,Tap into the Google Play store to load your favorite apps, and the SIII feels and functions as good as or better than any desktop or laptop I have ever had.
B008HTJLF6,1,21,Since I have a Samsung tablet all my apps and pictures from my tablet automatically came up on my phone!
B008HTJLF6,1,22,LOVE IT!!
B008HTJLF6,1,23,great picture, easy to use and automatically downloaded the aps i had on my other phone!
B008HTJLF6,1,24,This is his first smartphone and he has not stopped watching videos or loading music.

B008HTJLF6,2,7,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,2,8,The price was the main feature of this purchase.
B008HTJLF6,2,9,Excellent phone for the price.
B008HTJLF6,2,10,So a great value for money.
B008HTJLF6,2,11,This is a Nice smart phone.
B008HTJLF6,2,12,Best "VZ"upgrade.
B008HTJLF6,2,13,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,2,14,Overall great experience and the phone is just amazing.
B008HTJLF6,2,15,This is IMO the best android phone to date.
B008HTJLF6,2,16,Best Android Phone To Date.
B008HTJLF6,2,17,And this was a very good choice for me.
B008HTJLF6,2,18,Really, for what you get for the price, Android offers more options.
B008HTJLF6,2,19,Yes, this is my first smartphone.
B008HTJLF6,2,20,My first smartphone.
B008HTJLF6,2,21,Definitely not worth the price tag.
B008HTJLF6,2,22,Excellent, feature-rich smartphone.
B008HTJLF6,2,23,simply the best smartphone on the market.
B008HTJLF6,2,24,At only $25 with 2-year contract extension on Verizon, this is a fantastic phone for the price; it was twice the money at the Verizon store when I was shopping around.
B008HTJLF6,3,0,It has a great battery life for my uses.
B008HTJLF6,3,1,Great battery life.
B008HTJLF6,3,2,Respectable battery life.
B008HTJLF6,3,3,It usually takes all day for my battery to go down.
B008HTJLF6,3,4,Battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,3,5,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,3,6,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,3,7,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,3,8,Understand the Battery Life isn't great, but neither is my present cell phone life great.
B008HTJLF6,3,9,Battery life is just so so, to me it's over hyped, although i'm on it alot, probally 3.5-4.5 hours of On Screen time a day.
B008HTJLF6,3,10,Battery life isn't great but that is to expected since it is a smart phone and used a lot during the day.
B008HTJLF6,3,11,Wondering about the Extended Battery life when in use and when not in use, like how long does it "stay" charged before used, as well as how long is it's life.
B008HTJLF6,3,12,I need a good battery life (and a replaceable battery)  The battery life (even with Samsung 'profiles' turned on to help control battery life) did not get me through an entire day.
B008HTJLF6,3,13,It takes roughly 2-3 full hours to charge the battery from 5% to full charge.
B008HTJLF6,3,14,It was GREAT... for three days.
B008HTJLF6,3,15,Great phone for everything!
B008HTJLF6,3,16,I couldn't make it more than 8 hours without charging it.
B008HTJLF6,3,17,I do miss my slide-out keyboard.Did I mention the much improved battery life?
B008HTJLF6,3,18,If the battery life was better this would be an app users go to phone.*Side
B008HTJLF6,3,19,It lasts all day for me after one week of use.
B008HTJLF6,3,20,And the battery life last past a day.
B008HTJLF6,3,21,I've always been rather impressed with the battery for the most part, as it lasts a full day easily.
B008HTJLF6,3,22,With light use it lasts more than 24 hours, and with heavy use, like taking pictures all day long it dies in about 8 hours.the
B008HTJLF6,3,23,I bought the extended battery, now it's great.
B008HTJLF6,3,24,The biggest issue is the very poor battery life.
B008HTJLF6,4,0,Great music and sound quality.8.
B008HTJLF6,4,1,Call quality is excellent.
B008HTJLF6,4,2,Voice call quality is excellent.
B008HTJLF6,4,3,People say my voice has a mechanical muffled quality, and their voices to me have a fuzzy, rasping quality.
B008HTJLF6,4,4,The people I called say that I sound like I am on a landline--and they sound just as clear to me.
B008HTJLF6,4,5,Poor Call Quality of Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,4,6,Audio quality on the camera is also quite good.Call Quality and ReceptionI have had no problems with reception at all.
B008HTJLF6,4,7,Yet, I was getting very decent quality calls (clear, but a bit tinny sounding).
B008HTJLF6,4,8,About 40% of the calls can not be heard by people who I call or who call me.
B008HTJLF6,4,9,I'm really surprised as to how good they are.
B008HTJLF6,4,10,The voice quality could be better, the phone often distorting the audio when its loud enough to hear the other party.
B008HTJLF6,4,11,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,4,12,The camera takes great pictures and video, and streaming video on the phone's screen looks excellent.
B008HTJLF6,4,13,Great battery life.
B008HTJLF6,4,14,Voice Calls Inferior - Beautiful Display at Price of Battery Life.
B008HTJLF6,4,15,It never lags or makes me wait for anything.Call quality- I am shocked that some have complained about the call quality because I have experienced very good call quality.
B008HTJLF6,4,16,Great Phone with one glitch.
B008HTJLF6,4,17,Great, right?
B008HTJLF6,4,18,What most customer reviews fail to mention is the quality of the voice calls.
B008HTJLF6,4,19,However, its camera ability is great and there's no better display out there.
B008HTJLF6,4,20,I get more dropped calls.
B008HTJLF6,4,21,The quality of the pictures is also fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,4,22,If I disconnect the audio connection, the phone call comes through the car phone speaker.
B008HTJLF6,4,23,Yes, it does everything it is advertised to do, except one little thing...it can't make a quality phone call.
B008HTJLF6,4,24,This phone works fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,5,0,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,5,1,GREAT PHONE!
B008HTJLF6,5,2,Great camera and camera options.
B008HTJLF6,5,3,Other than that this is a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,5,4,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,5,5,The phone itself is awesome, great camera, screen.
B008HTJLF6,5,6,Great phone.
B008HTJLF6,5,7,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,5,8,The camera works well.
B008HTJLF6,5,9,It has a great camera front and rear and great sound ,this phone is on the front line of technology!
B008HTJLF6,5,10,The pictures look great.
B008HTJLF6,5,11,Great phone, terrible camera.
B008HTJLF6,5,12,Good phone.
B008HTJLF6,5,13,The camera takes great pictures and video, and streaming video on the phone's screen looks excellent.
B008HTJLF6,5,14,Light weight- Great screen- Nice large bright display- Good camera for stills- Great camera for video- Bright LED flash for the camera and flashlight use- Good speaker sound and volume- No lack of features including NFC, Bluetooth, WiFi 2.4 and 5GHZ, GPS, and more.-
B008HTJLF6,5,15,But besides that tweak, the hardware is solid and the camera is great.
B008HTJLF6,5,16,However, its camera ability is great and there's no better display out there.
B008HTJLF6,5,17,The phone is great it is bright clear and easy to see.
B008HTJLF6,5,18,Color is good and the video quality is genuine HD quality for most shots.
B008HTJLF6,5,19,I'm not needing this for gaming.But the phone's upsides intrigued me as well as a great price through Staples of $99.
B008HTJLF6,5,20,Best phone out there!
B008HTJLF6,5,21,Great phone at a great price.
B008HTJLF6,5,22,In fact it seems well built, but like most phones I would not want to drop it without a case.The 1080p video camera is a nice feature too, and the videos looks great!
B008HTJLF6,5,23,So I can definitely say that this phone is a great phone for anyone.
B008HTJLF6,5,24,The screen is AMAZING.
B008HTJLF6,6,0,This was a steal.Cons - can be a little glitchy at times, apps stopping, having to reformat my sd card, etc.
B008HTJLF6,6,1,I got it so that I could use the credit card app and it works great.
B008HTJLF6,6,2,SD Card expandable.
B008HTJLF6,6,3,microSD card slot + 16GB of internal storage.
B008HTJLF6,6,4,I have 80GB of memory.
B008HTJLF6,6,5,16 GB + a 32 GB sd card gives me plenty of storage.
B008HTJLF6,6,6,It also has a decent amount of memory, and it even offers a memory card slot if you don't have enough.
B008HTJLF6,6,7,With the 4.3 update, you can move some apps to SD cards- without, you can only put pictures and media.The software is what kills this phone.
B008HTJLF6,6,8,Android allows must apps to be saved and launched from the micro SD cards.
B008HTJLF6,6,9,I have changed SIM cards once, but the problem recurred.3.
B008HTJLF6,6,10,v4.1)Memory card issues - I purchased a few 3rd party memory card chips ranging in size from 16GB to 32GB while I had this phone, and had data corruption issues with each of them (3 in all).
B008HTJLF6,6,11,GREAT PHONE.
B008HTJLF6,6,12,I had my SIM card swapped out, thinking it could possibly be a bad SIM card, but still, no cigar.
B008HTJLF6,6,13,This feature allows low and mid-range phones to be made with limited internal storage because users can add their own cards.Sammy, however, wants power users to buy the bigger capacity 32gig phones for an extra $50.
B008HTJLF6,6,14,I am not sure of the size of the app partition in the phone, but I hope Sammy didn't put too big of a restriction on internal storage or that could be a problem for some people down the road.
B008HTJLF6,6,15,Had battery checked & sim card.
B008HTJLF6,6,16,Great design and portability, high price, occasional memory card issues.
B008HTJLF6,6,17,To force us to buy the step up model, Samsung disable the ability to move apps from internal storage to the micro SD card.
B008HTJLF6,6,18,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,6,19,Some nice new features (Smart Stay - works about 75% of time but is still pretty nifty).
B008HTJLF6,6,20,CNET and Phonedog have done excellent video reviews on the GS3's user interface and software features and highly recommend that  you check them out (Amazon won't allow links to outside sites--so you'll have to google them).I do have a few software gripes, one of which could effect some peoples' buying decision.One of the purported advantages of the GS3 over its top competitors from the HTC One line of phones is the fact that the GS3's has a micro SD card slot and accepts up to 64gb cards.
B008HTJLF6,6,21,It has one- one!- good feature that's making my N7 jealous.
B008HTJLF6,6,22,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,6,23,Amazing features, not sure I'll use them all but nice that they are there.
B008HTJLF6,6,24,T9 trace/swype works well.Cons1.
B008HTJLF6,7,0,I may look for another Samsung, a Galaxy 4 for my next one.
B008HTJLF6,7,1,Love my Samsung Galaxy SIII.
B008HTJLF6,7,2,The Samsung Galaxy S3 is a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,7,3,I was able to get the Galaxy S3 for $29.99.
B008HTJLF6,7,4,Upgraded to Samsung Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,7,5,Samsung Galaxy S III paring with Nissan Altima 2007 & 2008 will not happen if the phone is a Ver.
B008HTJLF6,7,6,Samsung Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,7,7,Samsung III is great.
B008HTJLF6,7,8,love my s3!!! i ordered the samsung galaxy s 3 and i love it, it far exceeded my expectations.
B008HTJLF6,7,9,My other phones worked great there.
B008HTJLF6,7,10,I have owned the Samsung Galaxy S3 for about six months now.
B008HTJLF6,7,11,Here's why:My needs for a phone (these may not be yours, and that's ok)along with how the Samsung stacks up:1.
B008HTJLF6,7,12,Really like this phone.Samsung made a really good job by making this phone!
B008HTJLF6,7,13,Other than that this is a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,7,14,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,7,15,Love the Verizon Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,7,16,Just ordered the S3 for my nephew.
B008HTJLF6,7,17,Galaxy S III.
B008HTJLF6,7,18,I wish it worked!
B008HTJLF6,7,19,note - I do love a phone that takes good pictures and Samsung S3 does this really well and fast.
B008HTJLF6,7,20,a great purchase for me.not
B008HTJLF6,7,21,When it arrived it looked great.
B008HTJLF6,7,22,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone when it is working properly.
B008HTJLF6,7,23,I have very mixed feelings about the galaxy sIII but have found that most of the time this phone works great for me.
B008HTJLF6,7,24,The Samsung Galaxy S3 is without a doubt the best phone for ME.
B008HTJLF6,8,0,Its a great phone on every other carrier except Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,8,1,My other phones worked great there.
B008HTJLF6,8,2,My phone works now in this area, but the verizon threads show there are many people for whom it didn't work.
B008HTJLF6,8,3,Give us freedom Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,8,4,Verizon SIII.
B008HTJLF6,8,5,Other Verizon phones work perfectly here and never drop out of service.
B008HTJLF6,8,6,Hard to like a phone that can't make a phone call.
B008HTJLF6,8,7,If you want a phone for wifi connection and making calls, get something else.
B008HTJLF6,8,8,Verizon version is no good, Verizon will not fix.
B008HTJLF6,8,9,If you like this phone, you will be better off getting it on AT&T; or T-Mobile's network, because they have not crippled the software.
B008HTJLF6,8,10,In many areas where my previous phone had a good signal, this phone had none.
B008HTJLF6,8,11,Customer support for activation was also very good.
B008HTJLF6,8,12,Do not buy this phone if you want to use it as a phone!Update:  Tried new sim card, got new phone, many service calls, verizon just keeps putting me off each time.
B008HTJLF6,8,13,At the same time and place, I had no problem placing and receiving calls on two inexpensive Verizon cell phones.
B008HTJLF6,8,14,Verizon what the heck.
B008HTJLF6,8,15,LOLThis the same phone as Sprint AT&T; and T Mobile but Verizon changed the software crippling it's potential and ruining an otherwise good phone.
B008HTJLF6,8,16,The S3 is a great phone for people on other carriers.
B008HTJLF6,8,17,Showed weak cell reception in areas of weak signal.
B008HTJLF6,8,18,I wish it worked!
B008HTJLF6,8,19,I have excellent signal strength on Verizon's network.
B008HTJLF6,8,20,I was not under contract so I just returned it cancelled my  service with Verizon.Why Verizon???  Fire whoever is in charge over there.
B008HTJLF6,8,21,Call quality on Verizon in Southern California has been very good (the only reason I have stuck with them as a carrier is because of the reliability of their network).
B008HTJLF6,8,22,Verizon has crippled the software and will not provide any valid reason or a way to unlock the full potential of this device.
B008HTJLF6,8,23,This has been the worst phone I have had with Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,8,24,It will have three bars and won't even let you send a text (No Network Avab)I have several other phones and they work great in the same area so what gives.I will never buy a samsung phone again.
B008HTJLF6,9,0,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,9,1,Great phone.
B008HTJLF6,9,2,Great phone at a great price.
B008HTJLF6,9,3,Lightning fast 4G LTE.
B008HTJLF6,9,4,Great Android Device.
B008HTJLF6,9,5,Lightning fast browser...Awesome!
B008HTJLF6,9,6,Good Smartphone for a Good Price.
B008HTJLF6,9,7,Great phone with great functionality.
B008HTJLF6,9,8,Data speeds are fast both with WiFi and 4G.
B008HTJLF6,9,9,However, I have no issues with the speed of my S3.
B008HTJLF6,9,10,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,9,11,It's also capable of 4G LTE speeds so the internet is blazing fast as well.Most of my friends have iphones, and they were envious of the looks/screen on this phone.
B008HTJLF6,9,12,Overall great experience and the phone is just amazing.
B008HTJLF6,9,13,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,9,14,The processor on the US version of this phone is the dual core Qualcomm Krait 1.5ghz and it's excellent for running just about anything you need it to with top notch speed!
B008HTJLF6,9,15,Great phone for everything!
B008HTJLF6,9,16,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,9,17,I know the S4 has been out for a little while now, but this is still an excellent device with tons of features and great overall performance.
B008HTJLF6,9,18,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,9,19,From what can be gathered on the internet, the S3 will still be supported with software updates at least through the next Android version 4.2.2 (and maybe further).
B008HTJLF6,9,20,I'm not needing this for gaming.But the phone's upsides intrigued me as well as a great price through Staples of $99.
B008HTJLF6,9,21,The speed on the S3 camera is stellar.
B008HTJLF6,9,22,Crystal clear screen, fast speeds, great operating system, and no complaints at all.
B008HTJLF6,9,23,Let me first tell you what is good :- Very fast processor- Display is amazing quality, but not very bright.
B008HTJLF6,9,24,I still keep a few on cuz they come in handy.The device is also incredible fast and smooth, and the screen looks perfect.
B008HTJLF6,10,0,I love this phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,1,I love my new phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,2,LOVE IT!!
B008HTJLF6,10,3,Love my phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,4,GREAT phone, love using it, easy to use.
B008HTJLF6,10,5,I loved that!!
B008HTJLF6,10,6,Love it!
B008HTJLF6,10,7,got it and LOVED IT!!!
B008HTJLF6,10,8,Love my new phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,9,With a little explanation I think it would be easy enough for newbies also.
B008HTJLF6,10,10,Love this phone!
B008HTJLF6,10,11,i love this phone!
B008HTJLF6,10,12,I love it!
B008HTJLF6,10,13,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,14,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone when it is working properly.
B008HTJLF6,10,15,Loved it.
B008HTJLF6,10,16,GREAT PHONE.
B008HTJLF6,10,17,There are some cool features, but I don't love this phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,18,I love my phone and only have 2 gripes:1.
B008HTJLF6,10,19,Love it Hate it!
B008HTJLF6,10,20,Love this phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,21,GREAT PHONE.
B008HTJLF6,10,22,Great phone!
B008HTJLF6,10,23,I love the large screen!
B008HTJLF6,10,24,I would recommend
B008HTJLF6,11,0,Wish the power button was on the top, it would make it easier.
B008HTJLF6,11,1,The power button is located on the right side of the phone near the top, and a volume rocker is located on the left side near the top.
B008HTJLF6,11,2,Don't bother being particular about the color.
B008HTJLF6,11,3,It has one- one!- good feature that's making my N7 jealous.
B008HTJLF6,11,4,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,11,5,The power and volume buttons are cheap feeling, yes, but solid and easy to find.
B008HTJLF6,11,6,GREAT phone, love using it, easy to use.
B008HTJLF6,11,7,Takes me a bit to find where everything is and how it works but things are coming together.
B008HTJLF6,11,8,I'm hitting the volume keys on the left far too often when turning on/off the phone.
B008HTJLF6,11,9,I love the large screen!
B008HTJLF6,11,10,Great camera and camera options.
B008HTJLF6,11,11,The design and features of this phone gives the user everything they could need in a device that still fits in your pocket.
B008HTJLF6,11,12,The GS2 had a settings menu that allowed users to tweak brightness, contrast, tint and saturation.
B008HTJLF6,11,13,Really, it's the MSC & power button that might tempt me to leave the G3 a 4* review, but honestly, I just love the phone to death right now, which is kind of the bottom line.
B008HTJLF6,11,14,I am not crazy about Android based sofware, but it is OK.I do love the phone, can't really say I have any complaints about it at all excpet for accidentally hitting the volume key when I turn the power off.
B008HTJLF6,11,15,I like having a dedicated menu button and the lack of such hardware-based menu button on the iPhone made it a frustrating experience for me.
B008HTJLF6,11,16,While the phone had come out like gangbusters with great reviews when it was first released the middle of last year, users have had some issues with it, along with less than responsive Samsung customer service, giving me pause.Two of the issues were the GPS not locking in well, and phone call quality.
B008HTJLF6,11,17,While the contrast and color saturation are strong points for the phone, if you like natural color tones, the pumped up saturation levels may bother you.
B008HTJLF6,11,18,Notwithstanding other reviews here, I found the actual design and form factor of the phone to be a positive.As for the software, I have no complaints.
B008HTJLF6,11,19,How embarrassing.The call quality is very nice.
B008HTJLF6,11,20,And this was a very good choice for me.
B008HTJLF6,11,21,Great Android Device.
B008HTJLF6,11,22,I also like the blue color.
B008HTJLF6,11,23,Now for the list of things that make this phone the best android phone to date.The S4 processor with two gigs of ram.The Large 4.8 inch screen, which more than holds it own against all comers.The Camera is the best camera you can get on a phone right now bar none.The Battery life is the best on a smartphone outside of the Maxx, one suggestion would be to limit your background processes by going into developer options and change how many background processes your phone will allow.The Gesture controls are a very nice touch.The form factor is very sleek and sexy.Now for a list of things I don't like quite as much.The power button seems a bit flimsy to me, makes me wonder how it will hold up for two years.The signal is not quite as good as it should be for a phone made in 2012, but it is still very solid nonetheless.
B008HTJLF6,11,24,This is IMO the best android phone to date.
B008HTJLF6,12,0,good for first time smart phone user.
B008HTJLF6,12,1,My first smartphone, so I may be naive, but everything has been very easy to use and to access.
B008HTJLF6,12,2,Great phone for everything!
B008HTJLF6,12,3,That's going easy on texts, emails, browsing the web and Bluetooth usage.
B008HTJLF6,12,4,for first time smart phone user this is easy to useand enough screen size for manipulate apps and internet.
B008HTJLF6,12,5,I've gotten quite good at typing on this phone and enjoy using it for internet browsing and the like.
B008HTJLF6,12,6,Updated another phone on my VZ plan.
B008HTJLF6,12,7,My other phones worked great there.
B008HTJLF6,12,8,Easy to add apps or contacts.
B008HTJLF6,12,9,Voice call quality is excellent.
B008HTJLF6,12,10,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,12,11,Great Deal.
B008HTJLF6,12,12,Also it's hard to enjoy the 4g speed because it eats data like CRAZY and verizon just took away the unlimited data plans unlike Sprint.
B008HTJLF6,12,13,Also, after 12 years with unlimited data, Verizon now insists on charging for  data usage.
B008HTJLF6,12,14,Don't get me wrong, it'll last you a whole day of playing a few games, browsing the web and updating your Facebook or sending emails.
B008HTJLF6,12,15,Im really not one to write reviews.
B008HTJLF6,12,16,The phone itself is awesome, great camera, screen.
B008HTJLF6,12,17,Unfortunately, it's just not reliable for voice calls or text messaging, especially during peak times of the day.
B008HTJLF6,12,18,Ability to Google by voice is fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,12,19,A heavier user might want to move up to the IV, but for my level (primarily calls, calendar, email, searching internet on a basic level) this is perfect.
B008HTJLF6,12,20,Camera is perfect and it has quite a powerful flash.If you are an android lover as I am you'll love this phone.I have had it overheat a time or 2 while taking lots and lots of pictures for a long time.
B008HTJLF6,12,21,VZ wanted twice as much and would have required a plan change.
B008HTJLF6,12,22,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,12,23,I simply love it.
B008HTJLF6,12,24,As soon as I hit "send" on a text message, or "CALL" to place a call, the phone drops out of service.
B008HTJLF6,13,0,My screen stills goes dark unless I touch the screen to keep it.
B008HTJLF6,13,1,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,13,2,Glass cracks very easily.
B008HTJLF6,13,3,Horrible, cheap Plastic casing & a screen that cracks if you sneeze too hard!
B008HTJLF6,13,4,But one day my screen turned off and it never came back.
B008HTJLF6,13,5,Since its so thin, its susceptable to cracked screens and broken corners when dropped.
B008HTJLF6,13,6,If you must have this phone, take along a silicone or heavy duty case because one tiny drop can mean a disaster.
B008HTJLF6,13,7,Entire screen shattered, despite the fact it was in an Incipio case.
B008HTJLF6,13,8,I have small hands, and yeah, it does get a bit difficult to use the big screen sometimes, but I'm certainly not going back to a screen any smaller than this.
B008HTJLF6,13,9,For the price, provide a better product!!! GOOD RIDDANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008HTJLF6,13,10,Otherwise, the phone is shiny, pretty & has a beautiful screen.
B008HTJLF6,13,11,99% of the time it doesn't and I have tried it in all kinds of light, both with and without glasses.
B008HTJLF6,13,12,If the iPhone works better for you, go get one and stop the bias commentary.
B008HTJLF6,13,13,I did eventually get a screen protector after about 6 weeks.
B008HTJLF6,13,14,The camera is really nice!
B008HTJLF6,13,15,I'm going to tell you my specific reasons for giving this phone 2 stars after having it for 2 months.I can boil it down to one thing then list specifics - the one thing is certain things stop working and can only be fixed by a reboot of the device.
B008HTJLF6,13,16,;)Maybe next year they will let people have a four and a half inch screen!!!  Dare to dream
B008HTJLF6,13,17,A good case might alleviate this.Semi-con - This is 100% on me, but don't get too cocky about the Gorilla Glass 2.  I managed to scratch it a tiny bit in the 2 weeks thinking it was invincible, and it's not.
B008HTJLF6,13,18,I have yet to have a real problem, even tethering works smoothly with multiple devices.I have dropped this phone one time and although it did get some scratches it still looks good and works, no cracked screen or any nonsense.The battery life blows, but I use this thing constantly; movies, internet, reddit, I'm always on it so I just charge it everywhere.
B008HTJLF6,13,19,So much for gorilla glass.I think the basic problem is that the glass is compressed in the frame and that it sticks out from it.
B008HTJLF6,13,20,I bought this phone 5 days ago and already the glass over the camera has shattered.
B008HTJLF6,13,21,Camera is better than my other phone.
B008HTJLF6,13,22,Well read other reviews for the pros but heres the short consCONS:Too big for most of my pockets.
B008HTJLF6,13,23,She easily slips into my pocket, even with a back case on.FOUR: Surprisingly good battery life.
B008HTJLF6,13,24,not impressed at all!! gorilla glass??? i think not!!with the amount of complaints about the screen shattering so easily, one would think that Samsung would offer a resolution, instead they want an additional fortune to fix this mess!!! I've had many cell phones, have dropped them many times & have never seen anything like this.....Could care less about this Samsung device or any other they make.
B008HTJLF6,14,0,I had an iPhone before so getting used to the Android apps was the biggest thing.
B008HTJLF6,14,1,I have a LOT of apps.
B008HTJLF6,14,2,update:  I upped this to zero stars from -1 stars since they updated the software.
B008HTJLF6,14,3,enough where you have to wait a few seconds before the next app can do what it needs to.
B008HTJLF6,14,4,This maybe an OS issue, Youtube app is missing the record button!7)
B008HTJLF6,14,5,im constantly opening task manager and shutting down apps so i can use other apps.
B008HTJLF6,14,6,Wicked.Fully customizable....for sure.Open android market  with lots of free apps that are not garbage.
B008HTJLF6,14,7,Great Android Device.
B008HTJLF6,14,8,So I tried to get the phone to freeze, I simultaneously started updating and downloading my apps from my old phone, started opening apps, played YouTube video's, sending and receiving text messages, played with the camera, streamed movies from Netflix.
B008HTJLF6,14,9,Fanboys or apple employees maybe.
B008HTJLF6,14,10,No ring/vibrate switch from the lockscreen either.Anyway, plenty of software nits that can be fixed by downloading replacement apps or rooting.
B008HTJLF6,14,11,If the iPhone works better for you, go get one and stop the bias commentary.
B008HTJLF6,14,12,I wish the icons were nicer, but I'm finding out "there's an app for that" so at least I know I can change them if I'd like.
B008HTJLF6,14,13,I was even able to take play back the file with the video in screen, while I did a couple of google searches.
B008HTJLF6,14,14,The iPhone is, well, an iPhone.
B008HTJLF6,14,15,When using GPS, MP3 player and phone at the same time the device does not properly recover.4)
B008HTJLF6,14,16,Until Sammy sends out a software update to fix the problem, I have disabled the auto-brightness feature.Software ImplementationThe user interface for this latest version of touchwiz is really very nice.
B008HTJLF6,14,17,I run a lot of apps and didn't notice any difference in performance.
B008HTJLF6,14,18,If games are your objective, it's great.
B008HTJLF6,14,19,Apps like Google Music and Twitter that normally work smoother on my S3 than N7 will trip up and force close far more often on the S3.Software updates.
B008HTJLF6,14,20,Buying this phone was a switch away from Apple and iOS.
B008HTJLF6,14,21,i have disabled a number of apps that may be running in the background, but that doesn't seem to make any difference.
B008HTJLF6,14,22,Apps (particulary heavy duty games like GTA III) launch quickly and are game play is flawless.
B008HTJLF6,14,23,This phone is a dream.FIVE: Sometimes the OS (Android ICS) freezes.
B008HTJLF6,14,24,My other phones worked great there.
B008HTJLF6,15,0,Still a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,15,1,I will probably buy the docking station.
B008HTJLF6,15,2,I bought this phone about a month or so ago and have a very different perspective.
B008HTJLF6,15,3,It was a very good buy.
B008HTJLF6,15,4,I bought this phone for my son.
B008HTJLF6,15,5,GREAT PHONE.
B008HTJLF6,15,6,I Love It.
B008HTJLF6,15,7,I've had this phone for over a month now.. month and few weeks maybe.
B008HTJLF6,15,8,After 4 months the phone stopped charging and Amazon won't even take it back after one month.
B008HTJLF6,15,9,got it and LOVED IT!!!
B008HTJLF6,15,10,This was about a year ago.
B008HTJLF6,15,11,Overall, I expect to be very satisfied with this phone for the next 2 years.
B008HTJLF6,15,12,very happy.
B008HTJLF6,15,13,Great Phone, just not what was advertised by Amazon.
B008HTJLF6,15,14,My son ordered his first, and it worked  out for him, i was due for an upgrade as well,  so I decided lemme try it out.i
B008HTJLF6,15,15,Very satisfied and happy.
B008HTJLF6,15,16,The product arrived on-time and works mostly as advertised.But it's the dealing with Verizon that always sours an experience.
B008HTJLF6,15,17,Good phone for me.
B008HTJLF6,15,18,Less than two years after purchasing an HTC Incredible, which was a state of the art phone at the time, I decided to upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy SIII a few weeks ago.
B008HTJLF6,15,19,Lovely phone, But Verizon should keeps its butt out of my phone, and stick with just providing me cell service.
B008HTJLF6,15,20,I chose the GS3 over the GS4 because the price has dropped so much and I am trying to save money.
B008HTJLF6,15,21,Recently I got the Samsung and he bought a new moto Droid.
B008HTJLF6,15,22,Potentially bad experience turned great.
B008HTJLF6,15,23,What a great phone!
B008HTJLF6,15,24,Renewed my contract with Verizon and only paid $20 for it!
B008HTJLF6,16,0,First off the phone has ultra poor battery life.
B008HTJLF6,16,1,And the battery life last past a day.
B008HTJLF6,16,2,3 months after we got the phone it stopped charging.
B008HTJLF6,16,3,When I don't use it that much, the battery will last about a day and a half.
B008HTJLF6,16,4,Also bought a new battery to see if that was the issue....nope.
B008HTJLF6,16,5,After a couple more calls a new charger and battery was sent to us.
B008HTJLF6,16,6,Within forty-eight hours, however, the phone had turned itself off and would not turn back on again.
B008HTJLF6,16,7,But one day my screen turned off and it never came back.
B008HTJLF6,16,8,If I charge the phone over night and don't use it at all I will be at 78% by 11am.
B008HTJLF6,16,9,The new one worked for 2-3 days and it is once again having the same issues.
B008HTJLF6,16,10,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,16,11,The biggest issue is the very poor battery life.
B008HTJLF6,16,12,With the new battery it started charging, but would drop phone calls a few minutes into a phone call.
B008HTJLF6,16,13,I had my first one replaced in less than a week because it wasn't updating and locking up 3-4 times a day and I had to remove the battery to get it to restart.
B008HTJLF6,16,14,When the phone was returned it still wouldn't charge.
B008HTJLF6,16,15,I have no issues yet, 3 months usage.
B008HTJLF6,16,16,Battery life is just so so, to me it's over hyped, although i'm on it alot, probally 3.5-4.5 hours of On Screen time a day.
B008HTJLF6,16,17,Seems it's on the charger more than anything else.
B008HTJLF6,16,18,Also the battery has a lot of juice and may last you up to a day , maybe more depending on your usage.
B008HTJLF6,16,19,Thankfully my replacement doesn't lock up but the battery life and inability to make outgoing calls make this phone completely useless.
B008HTJLF6,16,20,The display really sucks up the battery.
B008HTJLF6,16,21,Wondering about the Extended Battery life when in use and when not in use, like how long does it "stay" charged before used, as well as how long is it's life.
B008HTJLF6,16,22,When the battery begins to fade and won't hold a charge as long as it once did I'll be able to purchase a new battery for a few dollars and pop it in.
B008HTJLF6,16,23,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,16,24,It has a great battery life for my uses.
B008HTJLF6,17,0,Hard to like a phone that can't make a phone call.
B008HTJLF6,17,1,Poor call quality!
B008HTJLF6,17,2,I get more dropped calls.
B008HTJLF6,17,3,With the phone synced to the car via bluetooth, when the phone rings, I hear the ring through the car speaker assigned by the car bluetooth for the phone.
B008HTJLF6,17,4,If I disconnect the audio connection, the phone call comes through the car phone speaker.
B008HTJLF6,17,5,The people I called say that I sound like I am on a landline--and they sound just as clear to me.
B008HTJLF6,17,6,About 40% of the calls can not be heard by people who I call or who call me.
B008HTJLF6,17,7,I have very few times where I've dropped a call but that very well could be because of the area I was in and not the actual phone itself.
B008HTJLF6,17,8,Yet, I was getting very decent quality calls (clear, but a bit tinny sounding).
B008HTJLF6,17,9,You can hear your callers clearly and loudly.
B008HTJLF6,17,10,The standard bluetooth is able to determine if the connection is for phone only or phone and audio.
B008HTJLF6,17,11,I could hear the person on the other end, but they couldn't hear me (dead silence).I hadn't muted the microphone, I hadn't covered it with my hand, I had the volume advanced, I called several different phones and I tried the speaker phone all to no avail.
B008HTJLF6,17,12,When I press the answer button the call connects but the phone sound does not come through the car phone speaker.
B008HTJLF6,17,13,Audio quality on the camera is also quite good.Call Quality and ReceptionI have had no problems with reception at all.
B008HTJLF6,17,14,When I want to listen to music on my phone, I connect the audio plug to the car stereo aux plug.
B008HTJLF6,17,15,Yes, it does everything it is advertised to do, except one little thing...it can't make a quality phone call.
B008HTJLF6,17,16,How embarrassing.The call quality is very nice.
B008HTJLF6,17,17,This phone doesn't even let me make calls.
B008HTJLF6,17,18,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,17,19,Bluetooth music to my car stereo stutters.
B008HTJLF6,17,20,People say my voice has a mechanical muffled quality, and their voices to me have a fuzzy, rasping quality.
B008HTJLF6,17,21,A call to Samsung tech support revealed that the bluetooth phone audio will not work when the audio plug is accessed for the aux stereo.
B008HTJLF6,17,22,When connected to car stereo and getting a phone call, there is no sound played on the stereo; dead air.
B008HTJLF6,17,23,You may have turned off the volume of the phone unknowingly so that you may not hear a phone call coming in.The other thing is the built-in Samsung Swype-like keyboard.
B008HTJLF6,17,24,It's VERY frustrating because normally I cannot go back and do anything with the call until they hang up and end the call.
B008HTJLF6,18,0,Camera is better than my other phone.
B008HTJLF6,18,1,It was a very good buy.
B008HTJLF6,18,2,Great phone, terrible camera.
B008HTJLF6,18,3,If you actually expect your phone to function well as a phone, this isn't for you.
B008HTJLF6,18,4,Unfortunately, I take a lot of pictures, and wish I had realized this before buying this phone.
B008HTJLF6,18,5,If the iPhone works better for you, go get one and stop the bias commentary.
B008HTJLF6,18,6,no review should be below 3 stars for this phone.
B008HTJLF6,18,7,This phone is horrible at it's most basic function!
B008HTJLF6,18,8,Easy to use.Downside is the camera, it takes terrible quality, out of focus pictures.
B008HTJLF6,18,9,Good Smartphone for a Good Price.
B008HTJLF6,18,10,Good Phone - Misleading Description.
B008HTJLF6,18,11,The camera is really nice!
B008HTJLF6,18,12,The camera takes wonderful shots and the sound if your listening to music isn't bad either.
B008HTJLF6,18,13,For the price, provide a better product!!! GOOD RIDDANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008HTJLF6,18,14,Yes, it does everything it is advertised to do, except one little thing...it can't make a quality phone call.
B008HTJLF6,18,15,The bad part is that there are no built-in features for editing your photos save an option to crop.
B008HTJLF6,18,16,good for first time smart phone user.
B008HTJLF6,18,17,Tests show the Iphone 5 to be the fastest on the market right now, but I honestly don't see any difference in performance between my wife's Iphone 5 and either the Sammy or the RAZR M.At 960x540, the screen resolution on the RAZR M isn't as good as the Sammy's 1280 x 720 or the Iphone's 1136 x 640, but I don't watch videos on my phone and didn't really notice the difference.
B008HTJLF6,18,18,It truly blows me away every time I look at a picture or video.I've had the SGIII for one week and had zero issues with it.
B008HTJLF6,18,19,Camera is perfect and it has quite a powerful flash.If you are an android lover as I am you'll love this phone.I have had it overheat a time or 2 while taking lots and lots of pictures for a long time.
B008HTJLF6,18,20,I have a LOT of apps.
B008HTJLF6,18,21,I run a lot of apps and didn't notice any difference in performance.
B008HTJLF6,18,22,Great camera and camera options.
B008HTJLF6,18,23,Depending on the shot, the camera on the GS3 (and photo quality in general) is very comparable to photo quality on the Nokia 808  and iPhone 4S.Video quality is on par with the photo quality.
B008HTJLF6,18,24,If you want to crop or edit your photos you will need to download a different app though because nothing comes with the phone to do this.The battery life is decent.
B008HTJLF6,19,0,No Sim Card Error.
B008HTJLF6,19,1,I am two phones and two SIM cards later, and the problem persists.
B008HTJLF6,19,2,I had my SIM card swapped out, thinking it could possibly be a bad SIM card, but still, no cigar.
B008HTJLF6,19,3,Had battery checked & sim card.
B008HTJLF6,19,4,Nowhere in the description does it indicate this does NOT come with the SIM card.
B008HTJLF6,19,5,internal storage of the RAZR M might be a problem...especially since, as with the Sammy, you can't offload apps to the microSD card.
B008HTJLF6,19,6,You can't download/install/move applications to your SD card.
B008HTJLF6,19,7,I have changed SIM cards once, but the problem recurred.3.
B008HTJLF6,19,8,Default your music and photos to be stored on the SD card and you're golden.
B008HTJLF6,19,9,I bought two of these on a family plan and we both have problems with the phone giving an error "No SIM Card" which renders the phone useless.
B008HTJLF6,19,10,If I have an application on my phone and it goes bad, I want to be assured that the data is still retrievable on the SD card.
B008HTJLF6,19,11,"NO SIM" error, all the time.
B008HTJLF6,19,12,Even the fixes out there for the dropped service and no sim error stuff don't seem to always work.
B008HTJLF6,19,13,SD Card expandable.
B008HTJLF6,19,14,The new one worked for 2-3 days and it is once again having the same issues.
B008HTJLF6,19,15,If the iPhone works better for you, go get one and stop the bias commentary.
B008HTJLF6,19,16,We received the phone this morning and it is missing the SIM card and the back cover.
B008HTJLF6,19,17,This was a steal.Cons - can be a little glitchy at times, apps stopping, having to reformat my sd card, etc.
B008HTJLF6,19,18,Do not buy this phone if you want to use it as a phone!Update:  Tried new sim card, got new phone, many service calls, verizon just keeps putting me off each time.
B008HTJLF6,19,19,microSD card slot + 16GB of internal storage.
B008HTJLF6,19,20,Now the second phone on the plan is having the same problem.
B008HTJLF6,19,21,No Verizon SIM card, which is basically the personality chip that makes the device a Verizon phone (as advertised by Amazon) as opposed to a vanilla device.
B008HTJLF6,19,22,Phone does not work properly on Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,19,23,We have already received a replacement phone from Verizon but the problem persists.
B008HTJLF6,19,24,I told my Indian friend that indeed the phone has a built in 16GB RAM and what I was inquiring about the non-present SIM card.
B008HTJLF6,20,0,I had one of these phones for a few days before I returned it.
B008HTJLF6,20,1,Can't even return it.
B008HTJLF6,20,2,I returned it after 3 days.
B008HTJLF6,20,3,So now they are sending me a return shipping lable and I have to wait to get a replacement by UPS...
B008HTJLF6,20,4,It's been over a month and I still don't have a working phone--and all this time I've been paying for service.
B008HTJLF6,20,5,When the phone was returned it still wouldn't charge.
B008HTJLF6,20,6,Both phones I purchased from here were water damaged in box when received and on one, the GPS did not even work.
B008HTJLF6,20,7,I did not receive a new product when it did not state I was getting a refurbed phone, very disappointed I will never buy from Amazon wireless again.
B008HTJLF6,20,8,I like the phone when it works, but the Samsung support model is such a disaster that I will never purchase a Samsung product again.
B008HTJLF6,20,9,We waited for more than 2 weeks while it was "repaired" in Texas.
B008HTJLF6,20,10,Once again we had to send it to Texas for repair.
B008HTJLF6,20,11,2-3 weeks.
B008HTJLF6,20,12,After 4 months the phone stopped charging and Amazon won't even take it back after one month.
B008HTJLF6,20,13,price if I wanted to have them send me the phone before they received the dud phone.
B008HTJLF6,20,14,I have to send phone back first but would have to pay the "full" $600.
B008HTJLF6,20,15,I didn't move from a 2 year old HTC product to the flagship Samsung product in order to have to reboot my device 3 to 5 times a day just to make basic functions work.1.
B008HTJLF6,20,16,With the new battery it started charging, but would drop phone calls a few minutes into a phone call.
B008HTJLF6,20,17,Phones came water damaged and GPS did not work.
B008HTJLF6,20,18,I am totally upset this phone died within 9mths & not elgible for return or refund.
B008HTJLF6,20,19,3 months after we got the phone it stopped charging.
B008HTJLF6,20,20,BUY ONE TODAY, YOU WILL NOT REGRET PURCHASING IT.
B008HTJLF6,20,21,Had the phone for about two months when for the very first time, I dropped it while sitting down.
B008HTJLF6,20,22,Exchange is terrible... Purchased two of these phones.
B008HTJLF6,20,23,The person I spoke with at amazon was very helpful but couldn't do anything else.
B008HTJLF6,20,24,I wish it worked!
B008HTJLF6,21,0,It's been over a month and I still don't have a working phone--and all this time I've been paying for service.
B008HTJLF6,21,1,Do not buy this phone if you want to use it as a phone!Update:  Tried new sim card, got new phone, many service calls, verizon just keeps putting me off each time.
B008HTJLF6,21,2,My phone works now in this area, but the verizon threads show there are many people for whom it didn't work.
B008HTJLF6,21,3,Verizon bent over backwards trying to help.
B008HTJLF6,21,4,The new one worked for 2-3 days and it is once again having the same issues.
B008HTJLF6,21,5,Verizon would not let me e-mail customer service about it from their website.
B008HTJLF6,21,6,I like the phone when it works, but the Samsung support model is such a disaster that I will never purchase a Samsung product again.
B008HTJLF6,21,7,We have already received a replacement phone from Verizon but the problem persists.
B008HTJLF6,21,8,On top of that Verizon customer service has been steadily deteriorating over the years.
B008HTJLF6,21,9,Amazon would not work out anything with Verizon to get a phone from their store at this price so will not have phone for approx.
B008HTJLF6,21,10,It took countless hours on the Verizon store and on the phone with Verizon to get the phone replaced.
B008HTJLF6,21,11,About 40% of the calls can not be heard by people who I call or who call me.
B008HTJLF6,21,12,Phone does not work properly on Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,21,13,After hours on the tech support line with Verizon they told me just to go back to the store and get a replacement.
B008HTJLF6,21,14,I've owned several Samsung phones of the past several years and have always been very pleased.I purchased this phone for use on Verizon's network.
B008HTJLF6,21,15,All previous Samsung products have been on T-mobile.
B008HTJLF6,21,16,I was not under contract so I just returned it cancelled my  service with Verizon.Why Verizon???  Fire whoever is in charge over there.
B008HTJLF6,21,17,I am two phones and two SIM cards later, and the problem persists.
B008HTJLF6,21,18,One phone would not activate...after 5 hours total time on phone with verizon wireless trying to get it to work it was determined that the phone was bad.
B008HTJLF6,21,19,Samsung Support is a Disaster.
B008HTJLF6,21,20,Other Verizon phones work perfectly here and never drop out of service.
B008HTJLF6,21,21,They told me to go to Verizon as it was past 30 days.
B008HTJLF6,21,22,I don't know who the problem lies with, Verizon or Samsung, but it needs to be fixed!
B008HTJLF6,21,23,Sure, buy the phone, just don't get the verizon version.
B008HTJLF6,21,24,Verizon what the heck.
B008HTJLF6,22,0,Just give me android.
B008HTJLF6,22,1,The phone comes pre-loaded with Android 4.0.4
B008HTJLF6,22,2,The DNA coming out soon is better, there's a new Nexus device (but it isnt 4g), and the Note 2 is out.
B008HTJLF6,22,3,This is my first Samsung phone and my first Android phone.
B008HTJLF6,22,4,My only complaint is that Samsung should not deviate too much from google android.
B008HTJLF6,22,5,And whats better is that the new 4.1 software is soon to be releasedfor this phone on Verizon, making it even greater than before.
B008HTJLF6,22,6,Any high end Android device would be so much better with pure vanilla Android.But all in all, it's a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,22,7,This is IMO the best android phone to date.
B008HTJLF6,22,8,Best Android Phone To Date.
B008HTJLF6,22,9,I went through troubleshooting with both Samsung and Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,22,10,Still in order to differentiate its products from other Android device makers; Samsung is skinning it's products with Touchwiz UI.
B008HTJLF6,22,11,It uses a dual core processor in the US version while offering a quad core everywhere else in the world.
B008HTJLF6,22,12,I'm not sure I like samsung UI on top of android.
B008HTJLF6,22,13,I hated that I've had to go back to my HTC droid incredible 2.
B008HTJLF6,22,14,A better phone than the Droid.
B008HTJLF6,22,15,I had come to expect this from almost all Android devices, until I installed pure vanilla android with a custom ROM.
B008HTJLF6,22,16,The Samsung Galaxy S3 is a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,22,17,Verizon version is no good, Verizon will not fix.
B008HTJLF6,22,18,I also have issues with poor 3g and 4g signals much worse than my old Samsung Charge.
B008HTJLF6,22,19,Coming from Sprint I thought I was going to have a better experience with Verizon!
B008HTJLF6,22,20,Until Verizon upgrades the software to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, this app cannot be downloaded or used.
B008HTJLF6,22,21,You cannot judge a phone on hardware or software alone but how the two work together and the experience this Synergy provides.
B008HTJLF6,22,22,Weaker Reception - When on 3G, data speed is slower than my 3G - HTC .
B008HTJLF6,22,23,Verizon is being ridiculously negligent in upgrading the world's best selling phone to Android Jelly Bean and insults it's customers by not even hinting when the upgrade might be available.2.
B008HTJLF6,22,24,It was in reference to a review that chastised other reviewers for giving bad reviews to the phone because of Verizons modifications."In
B008HTJLF6,23,0,I am still figuring things out about the phone but overall I really do like it.
B008HTJLF6,23,1,I like when I am using text, you can swipe your fingers to the letters and it figures the word you want.
B008HTJLF6,23,2,I wish the icons were nicer, but I'm finding out "there's an app for that" so at least I know I can change them if I'd like.
B008HTJLF6,23,3,Read that some people had some "No-Sim Card" error.
B008HTJLF6,23,4,Easy to find replacement/extended batteries.9.
B008HTJLF6,23,5,I have changed SIM cards once, but the problem recurred.3.
B008HTJLF6,23,6,Some nice new features (Smart Stay - works about 75% of time but is still pretty nifty).
B008HTJLF6,23,7,I had to reset it once since I got it, and some of the upgrades for software confused me, but I took the time to figure them out.
B008HTJLF6,23,8,It is a setting easy to change, but illustrates that usability wasnt always thought through in designing the interface.
B008HTJLF6,23,9,I will suggest one thing to do to make this phone run to its fullest potential, get rid of touchwiz by using either the Apex Launcher, or NovaLauncher.
B008HTJLF6,23,10,for first time smart phone user this is easy to useand enough screen size for manipulate apps and internet.
B008HTJLF6,23,11,Good phone for me.
B008HTJLF6,23,12,It was very easy, I brought the phone to my local Verizon store and they got me all set up.
B008HTJLF6,23,13,lastly there is no mini hdmi port......hope this review helps some of you.
B008HTJLF6,23,14,I'm going to tell you my specific reasons for giving this phone 2 stars after having it for 2 months.I can boil it down to one thing then list specifics - the one thing is certain things stop working and can only be fixed by a reboot of the device.
B008HTJLF6,23,15,Takes me a bit to find where everything is and how it works but things are coming together.
B008HTJLF6,23,16,I reset the phone and started over; same problem.
B008HTJLF6,23,17,Google account will hold all in the information about all the apps you download, your number, and much more.If you set up Facebook to your phone it will give you the option to sync your friends list with your contact list.
B008HTJLF6,23,18,It was in reference to a review that chastised other reviewers for giving bad reviews to the phone because of Verizons modifications."In
B008HTJLF6,23,19,There's a much better cut/copy/paste ability by simply holding down your finger over text.
B008HTJLF6,23,20,I think the stylus was a waste of money, though.
B008HTJLF6,23,21,Dont know how much of this is a Verizon issue.
B008HTJLF6,23,22,Only had this issue once, when i accidentally hit the sim card when I was changing the SD card out.Just recently Samsung came out with an update that "fixed" this problem.The cons that I have with this phone is that VERIZON got rid of the 50 GB dropbox offer for this phone, AND that Google wallet app is blocked by VERIZON.I have to note that Verizon is coming out with a phone payment system of their own, so I guess that's understandable for them to block competition.Another con is that the notification light for text messages stays lit a solid white/blue color till you acknowledge the new message.Other than those cons, I have to say that this phone is the best I have ever had.ONE RECOMMENDATION/COOL FEATURE: Is that using a cheap accessory (Micro USB Host *female*) you can attach a :Keyboard, mouse, even attach a thumb drive to your phone.The accessory I found to work for me is called "eForCity Micro USB OTG to USB 2.0 Adapter" It's $0.82 with free shipping, sold on amazon from Generic.
B008HTJLF6,23,23,good for first time smart phone user.
B008HTJLF6,23,24,Dont know how much of this is a Verizon model specific issue.Pros1.
B008HTJLF6,24,0,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,24,1,Do all phones with non-replaceable batteries have a hard reboot option, and do they always work?Two niggling things -- The placement of the on/off button and volume up/down buttons are about on opposite sides about 2/3rds way up the sides of the phone.
B008HTJLF6,24,2,Many times, when I click on the on button, nothing happens, had to do multiple times or take out the battery.6)
B008HTJLF6,24,3,The power button is located on the right side of the phone near the top, and a volume rocker is located on the left side near the top.
B008HTJLF6,24,4,I wish the power button wasn't directly across from the volume rocker.
B008HTJLF6,24,5,Screen on time is about 2:53 minutes.
B008HTJLF6,24,6,The only compliant I had was the lag when pressing the main home button.
B008HTJLF6,24,7,I've turned the phone off or on many times when all I wanted to do was adjust the volume.-
B008HTJLF6,24,8,I'm hitting the volume keys on the left far too often when turning on/off the phone.
B008HTJLF6,24,9,Every time my finger gets to the top bar it turns off, when i lift my finger away from the phone it turns back on.
B008HTJLF6,24,10,For some reason I can't seem to figure out how to customize the phone screen so that when I choose the phone button it just goes to RECENT CALLS first.
B008HTJLF6,24,11,Apps stop responding - freeze up - screen sticks for 15-20 seconds sometimes.
B008HTJLF6,24,12,The only downside is that the lock button is on the right side of the phone directly across from the volume toggle button that also controls the ringer volume/vibrate/silent status and not on the top of the phone.
B008HTJLF6,24,13,And on my Palm Pre Plus, to delete things, you dragged them to the side of the screen.
B008HTJLF6,24,14,Lots of times, just mashing the back button is easier than pushing the home button.On a positive side, the screen is gorgeous.
B008HTJLF6,24,15,There is a home button on the front of the screen near the bottom on the center.
B008HTJLF6,24,16,There is an option to have 'noise reduction' turned on/off and there is also an option for extra volume turned on/off while on a call.Another complaint I have is when I am on the phone and need to do something like text message I will hit the 'home' key located in the middle of phone on the bottom.
B008HTJLF6,24,17,Reboot of phone fixes it every time.7.
B008HTJLF6,24,18,On this phone, if you do that in the call list, you call the person (or text them if you drag left).
B008HTJLF6,24,19,My only complaint is when I turn my phone on silent or vibrate it does NOT silent the alarms set.
B008HTJLF6,24,20,I reset the phone and started over; same problem.
B008HTJLF6,24,21,It's VERY frustrating because normally I cannot go back and do anything with the call until they hang up and end the call.
B008HTJLF6,24,22,In fact, one night I forgot to plug it in to recharge and there was still battery the next morning - 20%.I too was not liking the power switch on the right until I got a case, so holding the case I no longer press and hold the volume button, turning the volume all the way down.I too was not liking the power connector at the bottom, but have gotten used to it.
B008HTJLF6,24,23,Their was a second or so delay when pressing the button, so I found out if you take the S-voice shortcut off this button the delay disappears.
B008HTJLF6,24,24,When I press the answer button the call connects but the phone sound does not come through the car phone speaker.
B008HTJLF6,25,0,We cannot text or call.
B008HTJLF6,25,1,If you want a phone for wifi connection and making calls, get something else.
B008HTJLF6,25,2,As soon as I hit "send" on a text message, or "CALL" to place a call, the phone drops out of service.
B008HTJLF6,25,3,At least it was useful with WiFi when that was available.
B008HTJLF6,25,4,The issue only happens when you attempt to send a text or call, making it especially frustrating, as it interrupts whatever you are doing.
B008HTJLF6,25,5,What's the point of having a phone if you can't place calls or send SMS messages?
B008HTJLF6,25,6,Unfortunately, it's just not reliable for voice calls or text messaging, especially during peak times of the day.
B008HTJLF6,25,7,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,25,8,It's VERY frustrating because normally I cannot go back and do anything with the call until they hang up and end the call.
B008HTJLF6,25,9,This would cause the current text I was attempting to send, or the phone call I was trying to make, to fail.
B008HTJLF6,25,10,Now, we can sit next to each other on the couch and he has 3g and I can't even send a normal text message.
B008HTJLF6,25,11,When I attempt to make a voice call or text message, a good percentage of the time all 5 of my bars of service drop off, my 4gLTE symbol goes away and I get a "No Sim" message at the top of the screen.
B008HTJLF6,25,12,The new one worked for 2-3 days and it is once again having the same issues.
B008HTJLF6,25,13,I can work this phone hard, I mean constant youtube videos, some games, taking pictures, making some phone calls and stuff, and doing some e-mails (4 email accounts).. even though I don't sync but 6 minutes on every hour.
B008HTJLF6,25,14,I read emails throughout the day, calls, texts, occasional game, just everyday use.
B008HTJLF6,25,15,I rarely dropped calls and had service everywhere.
B008HTJLF6,25,16,When it comes to email and texting this phone will drive you crazy.
B008HTJLF6,25,17,After several attempts you can eventually get your call or text to go out, but it sometimes takes a while.For a while I assumed this error only occurred when I was attempting to dial our or send a text, then I started getting voice mails out of the blue where people had called and it sent them straight to my voice mail.
B008HTJLF6,25,18,Now the second phone on the plan is having the same problem.
B008HTJLF6,25,19,About 40% of the calls can not be heard by people who I call or who call me.
B008HTJLF6,25,20,Poor call quality!
B008HTJLF6,25,21,Plus u can only send 2 pics at a time through text very disappointed at this phone I've had it one month and already went back to my iPhone 4.
B008HTJLF6,25,22,Google account will hold all in the information about all the apps you download, your number, and much more.If you set up Facebook to your phone it will give you the option to sync your friends list with your contact list.
B008HTJLF6,25,23,Straight out of the box it's easily accessible.You need a google account to set up your phone when you first turn it on.
B008HTJLF6,25,24,"NO SIM" error, all the time.
