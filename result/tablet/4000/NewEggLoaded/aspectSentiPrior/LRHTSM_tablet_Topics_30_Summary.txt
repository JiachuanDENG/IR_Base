B008DWG5HE,0,0,Way better then the Kindle!
B008DWG5HE,0,1,Love, love, love this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,0,2,But even though I have both Kindle Fire HDs which I also love, I missed the Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,0,3,Love this tablet way better than an ipad!
B008DWG5HE,0,4,is really good the read books.
B008DWG5HE,0,5,For those who wants to use this device to read.
B008DWG5HE,0,6,I'm in love with it.
B008DWG5HE,0,7,I can now read books again and do so much more.
B008DWG5HE,0,8,I suggest you buy amazon kindle fire HD, although there's no S-pen.
B008DWG5HE,0,9,The SGN 10.1 is my second tablet, the first being the original Kindle Fire.
B008DWG5HE,0,10,iPad isn't.
B008DWG5HE,0,11,This tablet makes the iPad obsolete.
B008DWG5HE,0,12,Resolution looks great.
B008DWG5HE,0,13,If you're debating between this and an iPad, I think this is a clear winner unless you have a specific need for the iPad's breathtaking Retina display.
B008DWG5HE,0,14,i like the multi screen and  the resolution es good my be in mucho better iPad screen  but is  more productive that other tablet
B008DWG5HE,0,15,love it!
B008DWG5HE,0,16,I love the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,0,17,You don;'t need to read big reviews  to know that this tablet is better than apple !but can be better !
B008DWG5HE,0,18,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,0,19,You'll see.The resolution of the screen is not as nice as the iPad of the same generation as this 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,0,20,I have read other reviews of people complaining about the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,0,21,Display:  yes many say it is not HD or up to ipad standards but it is a beautiful display and I honestly when looking at pictures and movies do not need anything better.
B008DWG5HE,0,22,Late last year I got a Kindle Fire and this spring I went for a smartphone.
B008DWG5HE,0,23,The only advantage the iPad has over it is the "HD" retina display.
B008DWG5HE,0,24,I have read reviews talking about the screen resolution in comparison with the Ipads Retina and other tablets with higher resolutions.
B008DWG5HE,1,0,I think this will be a useful app as well.
B008DWG5HE,1,1,You have so many App.s that can be found at the Google Play store, many are free.
B008DWG5HE,1,2,I use the Kindle app for reading.
B008DWG5HE,1,3,Other apps can give you .psd
B008DWG5HE,1,4,You will need how to install apps and visit the app store.
B008DWG5HE,1,5,Kindle app works great and Amazon Prime movies work well in the browser.
B008DWG5HE,1,6,even found some great apps to tutor my kids on it.i'm
B008DWG5HE,1,7,it great.
B008DWG5HE,1,8,really great for reading my books and comics.
B008DWG5HE,1,9,One for their store and one for their apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,10,There's a great selection of apps optimized for tablets from Google Play, Amazon App Store, and Samsung Apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,11,There are thousands of apps on the Google Play Store to choose from.
B008DWG5HE,1,12,I also watch Netflix movies , read kindle books and Google play magazines on it.
B008DWG5HE,1,13,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,1,14,Unless you love downloading lots of apps and downloading movies or something.
B008DWG5HE,1,15,Although 16:9 is great for video and gaming.
B008DWG5HE,1,16,I also didn't like how on ipad you can only line up the Apps in little rows.
B008DWG5HE,1,17,It has run every android app I've thrown at it.
B008DWG5HE,1,18,One app in particular- ironically- the AMAZON mobile app- was not available for use on the Samsung Tablets.
B008DWG5HE,1,19,I can read books using the Kindle app, or using Adobe Reader, or Zinio Reader, Amazon Book reader.
B008DWG5HE,1,20,Also, every app I have looked at seems to be 40-50% cheaper on the Amazon app site than on Play Store.
B008DWG5HE,1,21,I had a Hava streaming box for TV - the app on iPad wasn't working, but it's Android app worked perfect...
B008DWG5HE,1,22,I down loaded the Video player MX-Video there is a free App. and I can view my HD videos on this tablet and they really look great.
B008DWG5HE,1,23,I also find the Samsungs to be every bit as intuitive as the Ipad was.Apps: There are maybe 2 apps that the Itunes store has that I "need" in the Android app market, but all of the other apps that I already purchased for my Android phone were readily and easily available for download from the Google Apps store ("PLAY").
B008DWG5HE,1,24,You'll also get some tips on the various app's that support it.
B008DWG5HE,2,0,Same price as Brandsmart.
B008DWG5HE,2,1,Great purchase!
B008DWG5HE,2,2,Great Product.
B008DWG5HE,2,3,If you really want to have a product to use it as profesional then get this one is great !!
B008DWG5HE,2,4,For that, I think the price is right on this tablet.

B008DWG5HE,2,7,Good product.
B008DWG5HE,2,8,Great gift.

B008DWG5HE,2,14,Love this tablet way better than an ipad!
B008DWG5HE,2,15,Great Tablet.
B008DWG5HE,2,16,I highly recommend this product to anyone.
B008DWG5HE,2,17,Great tablet but do your research before buying.
B008DWG5HE,2,18,Great Tablet, Very Happy!
B008DWG5HE,2,19,This has to the best product I bought for 2012!!!
B008DWG5HE,2,20,You will love it!
B008DWG5HE,2,21,love it!
B008DWG5HE,2,22,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,2,23,The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.0 is great.
B008DWG5HE,2,24,This tablet is Honkin Good.
B008DWG5HE,3,0,Battery life is short.2.
B008DWG5HE,3,1,It had ample battery life sufficient for my use.
B008DWG5HE,3,2,The battery life is really good too.
B008DWG5HE,3,3,So battery life here is a winner!
B008DWG5HE,3,4,Long battery life as it lastsall day.
B008DWG5HE,3,5,Battery doesn't last long.
B008DWG5HE,3,6,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,3,7,Long battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,8,Battery life is great too.
B008DWG5HE,3,9,Battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,10,Battery life excellent.
B008DWG5HE,3,11,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,3,12,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,3,13,Battery life is about 7 hours...maybe a little more.The resolution of the screen is great.
B008DWG5HE,3,14,Always seems like we are charging it.
B008DWG5HE,3,15,The battery is still at 75% when I get home after a whole day in the field..
B008DWG5HE,3,16,Battery seems to last pretty long.
B008DWG5HE,3,17,I usually have the brightness set to 10-15% or slightly less in classrooms or at home because that's all I really need but also to conserve battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,18,See how long the battery lasts.
B008DWG5HE,3,19,Battery charge.
B008DWG5HE,3,20,Longer battery life than the iPad or GTab.
B008DWG5HE,3,21,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,3,22,If you don't use it very much I have gone 5 days on one charge.
B008DWG5HE,3,23,I think I was down to 77% or something so battery life should be fine.
B008DWG5HE,3,24,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B008DWG5HE,4,0,Yes it is plastic, but I like it, feels good, doesn't creak.
B008DWG5HE,4,1,Good solid tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,2,It has great sound.
B008DWG5HE,4,3,The speakers are of great quality.
B008DWG5HE,4,4,Feels solid to me and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,4,5,As far as quality of picture and sound, I can't really tell the difference.
B008DWG5HE,4,6,Here is the good and the .. well it is all pretty good.1.
B008DWG5HE,4,7,Nice to have speakers up front, but it would be nice if they were a little louder.4.
B008DWG5HE,4,8,Excellent product, good quality.
B008DWG5HE,4,9,This is as good as it gets.
B008DWG5HE,4,10,it has pretty good battery life, it also has an excellent quality sounding speakers, which i wasn't expecting on any tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,11,The tablet itself has a nice feel to it.
B008DWG5HE,4,12,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,4,13,Loud and decent quality speakers, probably the best on any tablet I've experienced6.
B008DWG5HE,4,14,This synergy is shown in the design and quality of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,15,The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,4,16,solid build.
B008DWG5HE,4,17,It is different from the iPad, but that's a good thing, I think.
B008DWG5HE,4,18,Excellent battery, performance, stability, quality and also quantity.
B008DWG5HE,4,19,Better than my ol' iPad!
B008DWG5HE,4,20,So far, so good.
B008DWG5HE,4,21,Amazing screen colors and quality as usual from Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,4,22,You should have not issues covering the speakers with your hands.Build Quality - GOOD - Nice fit and finish, no loose parts, no surprises.
B008DWG5HE,4,23,Great tablet, but would be better if it was cheaper.
B008DWG5HE,4,24,I sincerely believe they could have built a better tablet than this (at the price they are asking for it).
B008DWG5HE,5,0,Great camera for video and still shooting.
B008DWG5HE,5,1,apps are easy to use and the camera front and rear are as good as other in it category.
B008DWG5HE,5,2,It has picture in picture video.
B008DWG5HE,5,3,very good.
B008DWG5HE,5,4,Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great.
B008DWG5HE,5,5,Video isn't that great either, but this is a tablet we're talking about here, not a Canon/Nikon/Sony dSLR or video camera.
B008DWG5HE,5,6,I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet.
B008DWG5HE,5,7,It has a decent front camera for video chat, and the a decent rear camera with a flash, tablets are not cameras but this one is above average.10)
B008DWG5HE,5,8,Pictures and videos are stunning.
B008DWG5HE,5,9,picture great sound!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,5,10,The rear-facing camera takes really decent images!6)
B008DWG5HE,5,11,Cameras are not the best you will see out there but both work nice.
B008DWG5HE,5,12,It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something.
B008DWG5HE,5,13,Video chatting works great as well.
B008DWG5HE,5,14,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,5,15,The front and rear camera works very well and the Photoshop Touch app is an excellent complement.
B008DWG5HE,5,16,With Smart Stay, the front facing camera will look at you.
B008DWG5HE,5,17,- Camera is awesome under normal light.
B008DWG5HE,5,18,I then realized this happens mostly for apps that use the front facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,5,19,It seems required for any portable device to have a camera nowadays, and both front and back are there, but the photos aren't great.
B008DWG5HE,5,20,this is a great device.
B008DWG5HE,5,21,Because of the many features it has also almost replaced my digital camera.
B008DWG5HE,5,22,Many good points and one problem.
B008DWG5HE,5,23,It is easy to use, and the screen/display is great!
B008DWG5HE,5,24,It has front facing speakers like all tablets should have.16)
B008DWG5HE,6,0,This tablet has a fast processor.
B008DWG5HE,6,1,fast processor, clear and bright screen.
B008DWG5HE,6,2,It did not disappoint.Firstly, this tablet is fast, really fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,3,Amazingly fast and responsive!
B008DWG5HE,6,4,quad core processor runs everything quickly and smoothly.
B008DWG5HE,6,5,Not quite as responsive as I would like.
B008DWG5HE,6,6,It's very responsive and sublime to touch.
B008DWG5HE,6,7,Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.
B008DWG5HE,6,8,Note: the iPad 3 is only 1GHz processor, and dual core, not quad.*
B008DWG5HE,6,9,Perfect power, great value for a quad core.
B008DWG5HE,6,10,screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,6,11,The touch screen is great.-the
B008DWG5HE,6,12,It is very fast and smooth.
B008DWG5HE,6,13,The quad core is sickly fast.d.
B008DWG5HE,6,14,Fast processor and connections.
B008DWG5HE,6,15,If Samsung were to upgrade this thing they should put in one of those nice new octa-core processors and a nice AmoLED screen.
B008DWG5HE,6,16,The processor is very fast and opening multible apps on one screen is smooth and convenient.
B008DWG5HE,6,17,This tablet gets the basics right: a high quality, bright screen, and fast processor.
B008DWG5HE,6,18,The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,6,19,The screen is plenty bright, the tablet is snappy and responsive.
B008DWG5HE,6,20,The note 10.1 is blazing fast thanks to its quad core 1.4 ghz exynos processor and its 2gb of ram, lag free and full of features.
B008DWG5HE,6,21,The quad core really shows here.
B008DWG5HE,6,22,This screen is beautiful!
B008DWG5HE,6,23,Awesome screen allows for great graphics.
B008DWG5HE,6,24,Well done Samsung!The Note is quite responsive, having a quad-core processor and 2Gb RAM.
B008DWG5HE,7,0,Make sure to get a 32gig micro SD card, to expand the memory.
B008DWG5HE,7,1,I purchased a 32GB micro SD card to increase storage space for my videos.
B008DWG5HE,7,2,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,3,Expandable Storage.*
B008DWG5HE,7,4,The storage capacity is excellent, 16GB, plus an extra 16GB SD card for the full 32GB of storage.
B008DWG5HE,7,5,I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.
B008DWG5HE,7,6,Another great feature is that even though this device comes with 32 GB internal memory, I can insert a 64 GB card.
B008DWG5HE,7,7,I don't recommend buying the 32gb version because this has a Micro SD slot for extra storage space up to 64gb.
B008DWG5HE,7,8,Micro SD support7.
B008DWG5HE,7,9,I highly recommend that you buy the Sandisk 32gb Micro Ultra memory card.
B008DWG5HE,7,10,I wanted a SD card slot for additional storage.
B008DWG5HE,7,11,I also love having the micro SD card option as then I don't worry about space.
B008DWG5HE,7,12,Did I mention it has an option for an external SD card to go along with the 32GB that it already has?
B008DWG5HE,7,13,It will handle up to a Micro 64GB SDXC storage card which writes up to 30mbps, really adding lots of extra storage since most tablets only support 32GB.
B008DWG5HE,7,14,I purchased the 16 gig version of the tablet along with a 32 gig SD card for just that purpose, only to find out that I can't do that.
B008DWG5HE,7,15,I am running a 64GB card and it works great.
B008DWG5HE,7,16,With the app you can see your files and download them into the tablet from the card or drive.
B008DWG5HE,7,17,Bought the 32GB model AND popped in a 32 GB sdhc for tons of storage (not possible to do in either of the other two devices.
B008DWG5HE,7,18,The only disadvantage of this type is its memory; namely it should be 16 GB but practically it is less than even 12 GB.
B008DWG5HE,7,19,The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,20,You CAN use a 64gb card in it (I have the 32gb Galaxy Note 10.1), so I can store twice as many movies and music.
B008DWG5HE,7,21,It comes with 16 Gb of native storage, but Can be expanded by 64GB with a micro Sd card.One thing that I love about Android devices is you're not stuck with one music or movie player.
B008DWG5HE,7,22,I bought the 16-gs, because it was cheap, now 32 gs is cheaper, if you want it buy this tablet,  buy the  32gs,,,, because the aps can not be moved to sd memory ,, I have the 16gs, and I have little memory and it sucks,but the tablet works good
B008DWG5HE,7,23,I chose this over the IPad because apps are not proprietary, you can add extra memory with a micro sd card that you can't do with the IPad and it was a good deal cheaper.
B008DWG5HE,7,24,you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory?
B008DWG5HE,8,0,Good Device.
B008DWG5HE,8,1,I really liked note 10.1 until I connected to wifi.
B008DWG5HE,8,2,A new way of doing computing.
B008DWG5HE,8,3,This device has replaced my laptop as my main computing device.
B008DWG5HE,8,4,Now I can use this at work as well sit at home, working and enjoing this new world.
B008DWG5HE,8,5,Perfect for these WiFi devices.
B008DWG5HE,8,6,It works great.
B008DWG5HE,8,7,What it has works great!
B008DWG5HE,8,8,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,8,9,I still like it and will make some time to work with it more.
B008DWG5HE,8,10,This is a great device and very useful for teaching and other such tasks.
B008DWG5HE,8,11,No problems connecting to any bt devices so far.
B008DWG5HE,8,12,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,8,13,Not as good as the Ipad 3, but great.
B008DWG5HE,8,14,I like this device a lot.
B008DWG5HE,8,15,This device works perfectly for these tasks.
B008DWG5HE,8,16,It was run over and still looked good but just didn't work.
B008DWG5HE,8,17,They love it and it works great.
B008DWG5HE,8,18,Its great being able to see what's on my other devices and use them as I need from one tablet.
B008DWG5HE,8,19,I do like working with photos and the note functions are good as well.
B008DWG5HE,8,20,I access the internet via wifi and it has worked flawlessly.
B008DWG5HE,8,21,iPad is a much better device.
B008DWG5HE,8,22,I have been using computers since the 1970's, but I am new to tablets and cloud computing.
B008DWG5HE,8,23,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,8,24,Web pages loading time is fast but not nearly as fast as my laptop.
B008DWG5HE,9,0,And well, after trying several apps, I must say that best for writing are: Quill, Write and Papyrus.
B008DWG5HE,9,1,You can write as though you were using a pen and paper.
B008DWG5HE,9,2,You resume writing, "accuracy".
B008DWG5HE,9,3,I was stumped about the "pen".
B008DWG5HE,9,4,The response of both the S-Pen and touch screen are great.
B008DWG5HE,9,5,The handwriting app is good.
B008DWG5HE,9,6,I've seen other top-of-the-line tablets used with an after-market stylus where you write really big in 1/2 the screen and what you write is digitized down (sometimes unreadable) into your "notes" in the other half of the screen.Not so with the Samsung Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,9,7,You have the best features on the go and the stylus works so well with it.
B008DWG5HE,9,8,The S-Pen feels like a real pen when you are writing not like those gummy bear stylus tips that the other tablets use to write with.
B008DWG5HE,9,9,S Note and PS Touch are geared to work well with the new Samsung Galaxy S Pen.
B008DWG5HE,9,10,The handwriting recognition seems to work well, although I haven't used it much yet.As far as the tablet overall, the responsiveness is great, and the screen is perfect.
B008DWG5HE,9,11,If you hand write a few words and then pause, the handwriting is converted to text.
B008DWG5HE,9,12,Love all the apps it's got.
B008DWG5HE,9,13,This tablet is great for handwriting and art.Pros:* Handwriting recognition.
B008DWG5HE,9,14,The S note app allows you to take notes or even write math equations.
B008DWG5HE,9,15,The Note software with the S pen make handwriting a pleasure.
B008DWG5HE,9,16,You can use the pen to draw or write with it.
B008DWG5HE,9,17,The handwriting feature takes some getting used to but it works great, especially combined with the auto-correct feature.
B008DWG5HE,9,18,The S Pen is so accurate that you can hand write whole sheets of handwritten text with it.
B008DWG5HE,9,19,This works so much better than the pens on ipads or other types of android tablets.
B008DWG5HE,9,20,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,9,21,The stylus is great and I use it all the time now.
B008DWG5HE,9,22,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,9,23,Evernote works nicely on the big screen.9.
B008DWG5HE,9,24,Some times you can press the button on the S Pen to erase instead of write and some times you can just use your finger to erase while using the S Pen to write.
B008DWG5HE,10,0,Love, love, love this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,1,Love, love, love this tablet!
B008DWG5HE,10,2,Love it!

B008DWG5HE,10,17,Work and Home Companion.
B008DWG5HE,10,18,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,19,I absolutely love my Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,10,20,It is great to:1.
B008DWG5HE,10,21,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,10,22,I love this product...
B008DWG5HE,10,23,loved it.
B008DWG5HE,10,24,Absolutely Love this Tablet.
B008DWG5HE,11,0,The keyboard does not work well.
B008DWG5HE,11,1,Also, the Note 10.1 has no built in full size or mini USB or HDMI ports.
B008DWG5HE,11,2,I also like that I can connect it to my computer's USB port and use it as an external hard drive.
B008DWG5HE,11,3,I purchased a portable folding Bluetooth keyboard that works great and I added a Bluetooth mouse.
B008DWG5HE,11,4,The propriety SAMSUNG plug is BS but has faster charging than micro USB.
B008DWG5HE,11,5,The only thing that I don't like about it is that there is no usb port.
B008DWG5HE,11,6,I even tried connecting the tablet to the USB adapter to a USB SD card reader and finally to an SD card.
B008DWG5HE,11,7,When I plug in a USB external hard drive to the tablet, the tablet tells me that the USB device requires too much power to operate (stick with the thumb drives, or AC adapter powered external HDDs).
B008DWG5HE,11,8,Female USB OTG adapter) which allows you to hook up a flash card reader or a USB thumb drive to your tablet.
B008DWG5HE,11,9,I bought an SD Card reader for $8 and hdmi adapter for $34 - hooked up a bluetooth mouse and keyboard and I can use my TV like a smart TV now.
B008DWG5HE,11,10,It will handle HDMI to a big screen and USB keyboards, mice, game controllers, external hard drives, I have have tried a 500GB external hard drive, and it should do even larger, just pickup the adapters.
B008DWG5HE,11,11,You can transfer files but the power output from standard USB ports is not strong enough to power the Note.
B008DWG5HE,11,12,Evernote works nicely on the big screen.9.
B008DWG5HE,11,13,HDMI out works nice.
B008DWG5HE,11,14,You need multiple expensive accessories just to hook up USB host, SD cards, and HDMI.
B008DWG5HE,11,15,Battery life is great too.
B008DWG5HE,11,16,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,11,17,isn't a solid-quality keyboard case yet.
B008DWG5HE,11,18,"NexusMediaImporter" is a great app for dowloading raw files into your Note.You will need this or similar adapter, which works quite well for the cheap price:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YWIRBS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00(Sanoxy
B008DWG5HE,11,19,This kit provides access to many USB devices (including printers, USB sticks, keyboards, mouses and SD cards).
B008DWG5HE,11,20,It's not always easy to get wireless - especially if driving.
B008DWG5HE,11,21,I love the cardboard thin Bluetooth keyboard that connects magnetically.
B008DWG5HE,11,22,I still like it and will make some time to work with it more.
B008DWG5HE,11,23,You actually have to plug your wall charger into it then then to the TV and once that is done it works great!
B008DWG5HE,11,24,No problems connecting to any bt devices so far.
B008DWG5HE,12,0,Great Tablet.
B008DWG5HE,12,1,The screen is good, but with sunlight is hard to see. 2. There are not  exclusives apps for android tablets, like apple have for the Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,12,2,Great Android tablet still learning the ins and outs.
B008DWG5HE,12,3,Not as good as the Ipad 3, but great.
B008DWG5HE,12,4,Great Product if you want an Android Operating System.
B008DWG5HE,12,5,No Flashplayer operation.....I wanted this instead of the Apple iPad...now its just like the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,12,6,Great Hardware.
B008DWG5HE,12,7,It was run over and still looked good but just didn't work.
B008DWG5HE,12,8,I love this thing.
B008DWG5HE,12,9,If you are an Android fan this is a great Tab.
B008DWG5HE,12,10,She LOVES the Android system, and the Galaxy Note 10.1 platform!
B008DWG5HE,12,11,would like more smooth and good resolution.
B008DWG5HE,12,12,Best android Tablet I've owned.
B008DWG5HE,12,13,This tablet works very well and has many nice features.
B008DWG5HE,12,14,What it has works great!
B008DWG5HE,12,15,This is  the only good thing about it.
B008DWG5HE,12,16,I love it firstly for Android operating system and lots of existing apps.
B008DWG5HE,12,17,It is different from the iPad, but that's a good thing, I think.
B008DWG5HE,12,18,A lot more?- iPad does indeed look nice, I give it that.
B008DWG5HE,12,19,I like spen functionality ... and would like more smooth and good resolution.
B008DWG5HE,12,20,Best tablet.
B008DWG5HE,12,21,It is smooth, fast, nice looking, and has the S-Pen.
B008DWG5HE,12,22,Note 10.1 does not look as nice as iPad.
B008DWG5HE,12,23,Its great being able to see what's on my other devices and use them as I need from one tablet.
B008DWG5HE,12,24,This is the best tablet out there.There are so many great things about the Galaxy Note as other have said.I want to emphasize the great feature of multi-task ability and nifty S-pen.
B008DWG5HE,13,0,Great Product!
B008DWG5HE,13,1,Way to go Amazon.
B008DWG5HE,13,2,Samsung was on the path to great product until they started to make it exclusive to thier products!!
B008DWG5HE,13,3,Fast shipping and Good product.
B008DWG5HE,13,4,I did not want to get an Ipad because I am not used to using Apple products.
B008DWG5HE,13,5,I returned this item.
B008DWG5HE,13,6,This was my first time shopping with amazon and im really impressed, timely delivery and good customer service.
B008DWG5HE,13,7,Product is fine and I love Samsung products but seller gets 3 stars for product seal broken.
B008DWG5HE,13,8,First of all, this item has shipped 3 days after I actually placed order.Second, the item was defective!!!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,13,9,I can't even help but cap-lock on these things, I love this product so much.
B008DWG5HE,13,10,Productivity at work.
B008DWG5HE,13,11,Also the quick quality service you get from Amazon is a plus.
B008DWG5HE,13,12,Satisfied customer that I am with this purchase than BestBuy.
B008DWG5HE,13,13,I own many Samsung products, and am delighted with all.
B008DWG5HE,13,14,Love this product.
B008DWG5HE,13,15,I purchased this tablet to replace a IPAD.
B008DWG5HE,13,16,Excellent product, good quality.
B008DWG5HE,13,17,NOT HAPPY!!!! Got a defective product!
B008DWG5HE,13,18,Don't Buy Refurbished from this company.
B008DWG5HE,13,19,Tablet came on time but in a rather large box.
B008DWG5HE,13,20,I was hoping to purchase the tablet from Amazon but Costco was offering an unbeatable deal.
B008DWG5HE,13,21,Excellent product, would recommend it to everyone, especially businessmen/women.
B008DWG5HE,13,22,All the other features are great but what good are they if you can't print your reciept after purchasing your item  from Amazon?
B008DWG5HE,13,23,I have purchased so many things through amazon over the last 7 or so years but this is my first review.
B008DWG5HE,13,24,bad service so far I have not received the goods since being purchased from the 15th of January  nnnn n.
B008DWG5HE,14,0,good produict and works very well.
B008DWG5HE,14,1,Great tablet!
B008DWG5HE,14,2,In few works !
B008DWG5HE,14,3,Can resize app windows and relocate.5.
B008DWG5HE,14,4,I have owned 2 other android tablets before this and this 1 is by far the best.
B008DWG5HE,14,5,Best Android tablet I have owned.
B008DWG5HE,14,6,Not as good as the Ipad 3, but great.
B008DWG5HE,14,7,Good Device.
B008DWG5HE,14,8,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,14,9,This tablet is the best one I have owned so far... iPad, Nexus 7... they may be good but this thing does so much more.
B008DWG5HE,14,10,This is Great.
B008DWG5HE,14,11,I have owned 8 Android Tablets and one Windows tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,12,It has run every android app I've thrown at it.
B008DWG5HE,14,13,Great.
B008DWG5HE,14,14,this is a great device.
B008DWG5HE,14,15,Here is the good and the .. well it is all pretty good.1.
B008DWG5HE,14,16,It even has Microsoft Office for Android on it!
B008DWG5HE,14,17,I find the keyboard designs on the Note 10.1 to be much better than the iPad and Windows 8 tablets.*
B008DWG5HE,14,18,Evernote works nicely on the big screen.9.
B008DWG5HE,14,19,Great Product!
B008DWG5HE,14,20,The touchpen is awesome, and being able to have several windows open at the same time is the best - every tablet should have this.
B008DWG5HE,14,21,Awesome! why anyone would buy an iPad over this is beyond me, this thing is great.
B008DWG5HE,14,22,No iPad bashing from me.
B008DWG5HE,14,23,I am new to Android products, but there is no reason to go back to Apple.And it does all the other things tablets/iPads do.
B008DWG5HE,14,24,One of the best TABLETs in ANDROID market.
B008DWG5HE,15,0,screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,1,The screen is fine.2.5.
B008DWG5HE,15,2,The only thing that i would have wished more is a higher screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,3,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,15,4,With the sun shining directly on the screen, I can read it fine.
B008DWG5HE,15,5,The screen is very sensitive.
B008DWG5HE,15,6,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,15,7,One complaint is that the screen is VERY bright and I've not found a way to dim it.
B008DWG5HE,15,8,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B008DWG5HE,15,9,Screen rotation is a bit too sensitive.
B008DWG5HE,15,10,With the screen facing away from the sun, however, reflections of myself and the scenery behind me dominate the screen and make it difficult to read the text.
B008DWG5HE,15,11,Yes, the iPad has a screen that is a bit more vibrant, but unless they are sitting side by side you will NOT notice the difference.
B008DWG5HE,15,12,thing to note about the screen.
B008DWG5HE,15,13,The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.
B008DWG5HE,15,14,I actually found out that it will not only run split screens plus 5 apps like I mentioned but up to 11.The screen resolution is NOT an issue at all.
B008DWG5HE,15,15,I do wish it had a higher resolution screen just for the purpose of bragging rights.
B008DWG5HE,15,16,The screen was also great looking I didn't even notice that it wasn't 1080p or a retina display.
B008DWG5HE,15,17,Unfortunately, the screen has amazingly terrible backlight bleeding.This seems to stem from a multicolored spot on the screen that is visible at an angle.
B008DWG5HE,15,18,I really believe this tablet wont last at $500 for too long.The second big problem is the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,19,When using the tablet outdoors in bright sunlight, I find that the screen is bright enough to read text comfortably providing it is positioned properly with respect to the sun.
B008DWG5HE,15,20,Speed is great and the screen is great, I take more productivity tools over high resolution screen tablet anyday.
B008DWG5HE,15,21,Basically, every second that I look at screen for these tasks I noticed the difference in screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,22,It is punchy with good blacks and looks plenty sharp at the normal viewing distance of a 10" screen.
B008DWG5HE,15,23,The touch screen is great.-the
B008DWG5HE,15,24,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B008DWG5HE,16,0,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,16,1,You will need how to install apps and visit the app store.
B008DWG5HE,16,2,It does NOT have flash player nor can you download it from the app store.
B008DWG5HE,16,3,The problem with all tablets is app support.
B008DWG5HE,16,4,One for their store and one for their apps.
B008DWG5HE,16,5,Therefore, this tablet will not run Flash video.
B008DWG5HE,16,6,Did not work from google store.
B008DWG5HE,16,7,October 19On the FLASH PLAYER:There are several ways to get around not having flash player.
B008DWG5HE,16,8,Flash not supported.
B008DWG5HE,16,9,Very inconvenient location.Apps:Here are some the of the apps I use.
B008DWG5HE,16,10,It's asking I download Adobe flash player.
B008DWG5HE,16,11,Flash does not work on this version.
B008DWG5HE,16,12,No flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,13,I was able to install Adobe Flash and now web pages that use Flash works.-
B008DWG5HE,16,14,I was very disapointed when I found out I can'get on Amazon Video, etc.
B008DWG5HE,16,15,Does not support Adobe Flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,16,no flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,17,Also, every app I have looked at seems to be 40-50% cheaper on the Amazon app site than on Play Store.
B008DWG5HE,16,18,To my dismay Adobe (the company who makes Flash video software) stopped supporting Flash for android.
B008DWG5HE,16,19,Great tablet but it does not support flash!
B008DWG5HE,16,20,No Adobe flash!
B008DWG5HE,16,21,Kindle app works great and Amazon Prime movies work well in the browser.
B008DWG5HE,16,22,It's got PhotoShop preinstalled.The flash player has to be downloaded manually by going to app store and search for adobe flash player installer.
B008DWG5HE,16,23,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,16,24,No Adobe Flash, so most web sites right now, don't work!
B008DWG5HE,17,0,if you purchase their products you are on your own after they get your money.
B008DWG5HE,17,1,Bought this over iPad and well worth the money.
B008DWG5HE,17,2,If you are looking for a tablet for work and productivity, this is the one.
B008DWG5HE,17,3,Why would anyone buy an iPad?
B008DWG5HE,17,4,would not have bought knowing this.
B008DWG5HE,17,5,I have purchased so many things through amazon over the last 7 or so years but this is my first review.
B008DWG5HE,17,6,I bought first one, during the trial, it freezes soon, So, I returned it and excanged with new one.
B008DWG5HE,17,7,But I was feeling good with my money so I decided to buy.
B008DWG5HE,17,8,Otherwise it is thus far working well and as expected.
B008DWG5HE,17,9,BUT... the price was not cheap either.
B008DWG5HE,17,10,I was iffy on buying this tablet since reviewers were kind of giving it a hard time.
B008DWG5HE,17,11,I bought the Note after reading the many reviews here.
B008DWG5HE,17,12,I expected this product to last for at least a couple of years.
B008DWG5HE,17,13,I bought this tablet in Nov 2012 and decided to wait a while before doing a review on it.
B008DWG5HE,17,14,Made my purchase in February and have had nothing but problems.
B008DWG5HE,17,15,I've had it now for about 3 months and it just gets better and better.
B008DWG5HE,17,16,My company spends 1000s of dollar in amazon purchasing.
B008DWG5HE,17,17,Seven months later, after many problems,  Asus refunded my money.
B008DWG5HE,17,18,I returned it in 1 month, it had similar problems.
B008DWG5HE,17,19,This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device.
B008DWG5HE,17,20,Please read the reviews (good and bad) on every item in order to make an informed decision.Response to other reviews:Here are some notes I added to address the concerns others had when they reviewed their Notes.-KIES
B008DWG5HE,17,21,Verry disappointed!!
B008DWG5HE,17,22,From a $$$ standpoint, this tablet still does everything I need it to do without me spending more money right now.
B008DWG5HE,17,23,I didn't buy this from Amazon, but feel I should make a coment.
B008DWG5HE,17,24,everything I expected it to be.
B008DWG5HE,18,0,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,18,1,charging cord.
B008DWG5HE,18,2,I was able assemble the adopter /battery charger.
B008DWG5HE,18,3,But, Alas! after plugging the charger in for a couple of hours and seeing a battery charge symbol on the screen I elected to turn in on and________---------________ Nothing!
B008DWG5HE,18,4,Battery charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,5,I'm having battery charging issues though!
B008DWG5HE,18,6,Had one before and the battery died.
B008DWG5HE,18,7,The battery is still at 75% when I get home after a whole day in the field..
B008DWG5HE,18,8,The first one wouldn't even turn on!
B008DWG5HE,18,9,Unit takes a long time to charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,10,As of now I must Hard shut down to get to full charge and sometimes that doesn't even do it.
B008DWG5HE,18,11,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,18,12,It doesn't stop even long enough for me to hold down the power key and turn the device off completely.I have researched everything, and can not find anything on why it is doing this, or how to fix it!
B008DWG5HE,18,13,What a bummer on Christmas to open a gift that isn't charged and can't charge because it has the wrong charger.
B008DWG5HE,18,14,Even with continuous use, I only have to plug my tablet in to charge overnight.
B008DWG5HE,18,15,The first day it died, the next day after updates on the second  day wifi issues.
B008DWG5HE,18,16,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,18,17,I STILL haven't got the opportunity to use it off a full 100% charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,18,The charging cable that comes with the unit is very short and does not let you charge the unit while using it unless you sit next to the wall outlet.
B008DWG5HE,18,19,Fixed them all up in less than 2 hours.
B008DWG5HE,18,20,So yes, you can fully charge it while using it.
B008DWG5HE,18,21,I can't get enough play time with it!!
B008DWG5HE,18,22,I held-in the start button for 10, 20, 30 seconds up to a couple of minutes and one time the screen came alive with some inverted yellow triangle flashing.
B008DWG5HE,18,23,Mainly, when I try and charge the Note while using it, the charging cable fits into the bottom of the device.
B008DWG5HE,18,24,Bummed to have to buy a charger now when this one should be came with the correct charger.
B008DWG5HE,19,0,And the sound quality and volume were excellent.
B008DWG5HE,19,1,Videos are full screen with front-facing stereo speakers.
B008DWG5HE,19,2,3.5mm headphone jack is on the top of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,19,3,I am not expert on sound system, so all I cared was whether I can hear sound loud enough.
B008DWG5HE,19,4,Speakers stereo separation is very good but the lower frequency sound is poor.6.
B008DWG5HE,19,5,Sound is great.
B008DWG5HE,19,6,The build quality is fine.
B008DWG5HE,19,7,The build quality seems fine to me.
B008DWG5HE,19,8,speakers can get loud which isn't bad but when you turn the tablet from widescreen to tall screen (as I call it) I just think the tablet looks a bit weird especially since the speakers will be top and bottom and slightly to the right or left.
B008DWG5HE,19,9,The speakers are loud and front facing, woo-hoo!
B008DWG5HE,19,10,The side front facing speakers get loud.
B008DWG5HE,19,11,However, I keep mine in the Samsung case (sold separately), so the build deficits aren't noticeable.Speakers:Placing stereo speakers at opposite edges of the screen facing forward is a great idea, except the speakers aren't loud enough and have a tinny sound.
B008DWG5HE,19,12,I find myself having to use headphones when watching videos.
B008DWG5HE,19,13,I really loved the sound on it with its stereo front facing speakers.
B008DWG5HE,19,14,Now that it's in a case the build quality doesn't matter any more.
B008DWG5HE,19,15,I did think about getting the Asus Infinity TF700 but was hearing LOTS of flaws and Quality of the design.
B008DWG5HE,19,16,* Build Quality - Standard Samsung quality.
B008DWG5HE,19,17,I can't tell any difference in quality between it and my laptop when watching the same video on both (the laptop was ~$1700 before a coupon).
B008DWG5HE,19,18,She looked around like she does when our surround sound is on because she doesn't understand what was making such a noise.
B008DWG5HE,19,19,it has pretty good battery life, it also has an excellent quality sounding speakers, which i wasn't expecting on any tablet.
B008DWG5HE,19,20,Our 4-year-old watches videos on this and, with the case we have, it's not possible to stand the tablet up for watching while it's plugged in.
B008DWG5HE,19,21,Galaxy Note 10.1 is just like others I have no problem hearing sounds.
B008DWG5HE,19,22,I can get click sound by pressing corner, sticking button (first one was volume, second one was power).
B008DWG5HE,19,23,The audio became occasionally inoperative and the headphone jack would crackle when using my ear buds.
B008DWG5HE,19,24,With infinity, some of my video files were only barely audible even with maximum sound setting if there are any background sounds.
B008DWG5HE,20,0,I wanted front and back cameras.
B008DWG5HE,20,1,I gave this a 4 star rating only bc I don't know how to work everything yet.
B008DWG5HE,20,2,The picture and video quality are even better than expected.
B008DWG5HE,20,3,Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great.
B008DWG5HE,20,4,But if you are working with it alone you will see that it is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.The camera is by far one of the weakest things in the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,5,It has a decent front camera for video chat, and the a decent rear camera with a flash, tablets are not cameras but this one is above average.10)
B008DWG5HE,20,6,The lack of that last star is for slight difference in screen quality.
B008DWG5HE,20,7,I then realized this happens mostly for apps that use the front facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,8,The only reason I have this four stars was that the camera sometimes does not focus well if you are taking a photo of a room.
B008DWG5HE,20,9,Give it 4.75 stars!!!
B008DWG5HE,20,10,I would have rated this 5 stars if it wasn't slow.
B008DWG5HE,20,11,The video quality, at least through Skype, is much better  than the iPad 3 for some reason.
B008DWG5HE,20,12,The only issue I could see was no HD display and the rear camera could have been a little better.
B008DWG5HE,20,13,The camera takes nice pictures.
B008DWG5HE,20,14,* Cameras - Amazon removed the images I posted for some reason so just take my word that the cameras work well.
B008DWG5HE,20,15,Kies is great and works just as well with photos.
B008DWG5HE,20,16,It has picture in picture video.
B008DWG5HE,20,17,I am very happy w all the camera options that are also offered on the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,18,Actually it was supposed to be a FOUR star rating not 3.
B008DWG5HE,20,19,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,20,What it has works great!
B008DWG5HE,20,21,Both the front 1.9MP camera and 5MP camera fully live up to their specs.
B008DWG5HE,20,22,The first thing that stuck out to me were the speakers being in the front, rather than the rear.
B008DWG5HE,20,23,I never expected it to be as good as it is.
B008DWG5HE,20,24,Because of these shortcomings I rate the Note 4 stars (and all other tablets without stylus, 3 star and lower.)
B008DWG5HE,21,0,I did a hard set twice and it came back as fast as new but it would slow again as I added Apps back in.
B008DWG5HE,21,1,I found the s3 to be slow considering it has 2gb of ram.
B008DWG5HE,21,2,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,21,3,When it is at maximum speed, infinity and galaxy browser loaded pages in equal speed.
B008DWG5HE,21,4,The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time.
B008DWG5HE,21,5,No Hiccups.-The 2 Gb of RAM lets you multitask very well and you will never feel like the tablet is slowing down.-Samsung
B008DWG5HE,21,6,The old tablet had its issues with freezing up after the last update along with not enough ram.
B008DWG5HE,21,7,What really sold me on the Note was the hardware: 1.4 GHz QUAD-core processor and 2GB of RAM.
B008DWG5HE,21,8,These key differentiators plus the power of a 1.4 Ghz Quad Core and 2 GB of RAM deciding to buy this tablet is a no brainer!
B008DWG5HE,21,9,The OS was fast at first but as I added Apps it got slower and choppy.
B008DWG5HE,21,10,The UI seems okay and pretty responsive so no complaints there.
B008DWG5HE,21,11,But after couple hours of use, infinity browser always seemed to slow down or crush.
B008DWG5HE,21,12,you could do it, but for having a quad-core processor, the keyboard doesn't respond very quickly and i have had lots of accuracy issues with it.
B008DWG5HE,21,13,I'm a spec stickler when it comes to the internal components of computers and stuff but I think this has all the right specs with its quad core processor and 2gb ram.
B008DWG5HE,21,14,But once experiencing the stability & speed of Galaxy Note 10.1, I don't think I can go back to infinity or any other android tablet that gives us freeze or crush every hour.=============
B008DWG5HE,21,15,Great size, high internet speed, and you can multitask with different applications at the same time.
B008DWG5HE,21,16,Sunspider benchmark of infinity was decently fast so browser should be fast, which again it was when working.
B008DWG5HE,21,17,Using this heavy load I was able to run the battery down in about 8 hours.
B008DWG5HE,21,18,Well done Samsung!The Note is quite responsive, having a quad-core processor and 2Gb RAM.
B008DWG5HE,21,19,I also tried using other launchers asi know touch wiz tends to slow down the device down like it has on my s3.
B008DWG5HE,21,20,I was set to keep the tablet but it started to have performance issues.
B008DWG5HE,21,21,The dual view is wonderful to watch and take notes or run two programs at one it doesn't slow the tablet down at all.
B008DWG5HE,21,22,Battery life is about 7 hours...maybe a little more.The resolution of the screen is great.
B008DWG5HE,21,23,If Samsung were to upgrade this thing they should put in one of those nice new octa-core processors and a nice AmoLED screen.
B008DWG5HE,21,24,This will undoubtedly gives me 10+ hours of browsing time.
B008DWG5HE,22,0,SD card slot usles.
B008DWG5HE,22,1,I bought this 16G tablet and installed a 16G SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,2,I wanted a SD card slot for additional storage.
B008DWG5HE,22,3,I bought this partly because of the sd card slot.According to Samsung you can't run apps from it and they can't store their data there.
B008DWG5HE,22,4,The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,5,SD card not properly used.
B008DWG5HE,22,6,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,7,While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-
B008DWG5HE,22,8,Also, with their mini-sd drive (I bought the SD 64 gb card) you can put music on there if you didn't want to use Kies.
B008DWG5HE,22,9,With the app you can see your files and download them into the tablet from the card or drive.
B008DWG5HE,22,10,There is an expansion slot (up to 32GB only) and I popped in the Sandisk 32GB card.
B008DWG5HE,22,11,updates not in the cards.
B008DWG5HE,22,12,I bought one and discover it wired without data SIM , I never saw even a note about that no sim card this really wired
B008DWG5HE,22,13,Warning... Samsung tablets and phones do not allow you to store apps in the SD memory.
B008DWG5HE,22,14,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,15,Make sure to get a 32gig micro SD card, to expand the memory.
B008DWG5HE,22,16,You cannot use Apps2SD, for example, to move apps from the Note's built-in memory to an external SD card without *rooting the device.
B008DWG5HE,22,17,This is a great tablet and for only $11.00 I added 16 more GB via mini SD.
B008DWG5HE,22,18,you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory?
B008DWG5HE,22,19,Thanks Samsung, you guys made a great tablet with a great idea!I bought 32 gb one, and I am about to use it with my 32 gb SD memory card too.
B008DWG5HE,22,20,not really 32 GB.
B008DWG5HE,22,21,My only complaint is that you can not transfer apps to the SD card, but I am hoping Samsung will fix this in the next update.
B008DWG5HE,22,22,When I downloaded a 3.5gb game, it asked me if I wanted to save to external SD instead of on-board memory (YES!).
B008DWG5HE,22,23,It accessed the SD card witout any issues.
B008DWG5HE,22,24,The ONLY use they giveis for backing up data.
B008DWG5HE,23,0,I don't really need wifi that much and use the note to take notes, and would rather not have to back everything up again, so I'm going without the wifi.
B008DWG5HE,23,1,I really liked note 10.1 until I connected to wifi.
B008DWG5HE,23,2,WIFI ONLY.
B008DWG5HE,23,3,slow wifi on the note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,23,4,I also connect to multiple WiFi networks at work and other locations and never have an issue trying to connect.-
B008DWG5HE,23,5,It says in the settings that it's connected to the school network, but when I try to access the internet, it doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,23,6,Works without WiFi.
B008DWG5HE,23,7,Connect to the wireless router.
B008DWG5HE,23,8,Pleade do a google search for slow wifi on the note 10.1.Tim
B008DWG5HE,23,9,It is useful but for those problems.
B008DWG5HE,23,10,WiFi suddenly doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,23,11,It connects quickly and hasn't had any issues.
B008DWG5HE,23,12,Same problem still.
B008DWG5HE,23,13,It connects to any Wi-Fi network almost immediately and the GPS works even inside closed buildings.
B008DWG5HE,23,14,My girlfriend has taken video footage with her phone (an Apple phone, that she has never had a problem with she says) of this device freaking out for minutes on end.
B008DWG5HE,23,15,Lots and lots of problems !!!!
B008DWG5HE,23,16,WiFi works fine.
B008DWG5HE,23,17,They are all set up on our wireless network.
B008DWG5HE,23,18,I don't know if the problem is with the device, android OS, the school network or any combination of the three but the problem is that since this device isn't as popular as the iPad, the problem isn't going to be solved anytime soon.So if you need reliable access to wifi, this device may not be for you.
B008DWG5HE,23,19,I have NO perfomance issues.... everything works very smooth.... not sure where some of the reviews on the web state that it is slow..... whatever...
B008DWG5HE,23,20,So no websites which use Java can work....and I believe this is on all Android devices.
B008DWG5HE,23,21,MAJOR peeve:  This is a mobile device which most people are going to use as a web device.
B008DWG5HE,23,22,Sync Problems.
B008DWG5HE,23,23,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,23,24,No issues with Wi-Fi like some people have reported.13.
B008DWG5HE,24,0,The touch screen is great.-the
B008DWG5HE,24,1,screen keyboard is customizable.
B008DWG5HE,24,2,We can't do anything on it, we can't even get to the home screen without it going nuts.
B008DWG5HE,24,3,The touch screen is extremely sensitive and it takes only the slightest of touch to registeryour input.
B008DWG5HE,24,4,isn't a solid-quality keyboard case yet.
B008DWG5HE,24,5,And touching the wrong part of the screen will send you to some unexpected places.
B008DWG5HE,24,6,The continual problems I have had with the note is that the left side of the touch screen lacks sensitivity when using the virtual keyboard.
B008DWG5HE,24,7,However, the potentiometer was very sensitive and at first I over adjusted so that the pen was writing on the screen when it wasn't even touching the glass.
B008DWG5HE,24,8,Everything on screen is still visible, just no touch function at all with either finger or pen.
B008DWG5HE,24,9,I didn't want Ipad like the majority but I haven't found anything lacking, I also bought the kingston bluetooth keyboard case as well and these two things work very well together.
B008DWG5HE,24,10,I often have to press screen buttons multiple times to get it to register.-
B008DWG5HE,24,11,It's just little things that I've noticed: the ink having a tad bit of lag as it "flows" onto the screen as you write.
B008DWG5HE,24,12,The plastic screeches and groans.One of previous actual "exceptional" devices  I owned was the touch pad, which had a plastic back.
B008DWG5HE,24,13,Be careful about screen protectors: most are "squishy" and so don't really work with the stylus.
B008DWG5HE,24,14,I am a avid typer (can you tell by the length of my article?), but for typing I was satisfied with using the touch screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,15,Without a case, I feel like I am going to drop it..I would recommend this product to anyone who wants the ability to write instead of type on a keyboard..
B008DWG5HE,24,16,I hate virtual keyboards.
B008DWG5HE,24,17,There are times when you press a button or select something with the pen and it does not register, and you have to press a second time.-
B008DWG5HE,24,18,The tablet feel in hand is great and I actually didn't even put a case on it!
B008DWG5HE,24,19,To get it to work you have to detach the tablet from the cover then move it.
B008DWG5HE,24,20,thing to note about the screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,21,You can work with any bluetooth keyboard as I understand it, though I've not done so yet.
B008DWG5HE,24,22,I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.Bad things (I think)-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful.
B008DWG5HE,24,23,It works well if you are holding it widescreen so you can type with just your thumbs and still maintain a good hold on the tablet.Something to note is that this tablet can do certain apps side by side on the screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,24,It comes with a pen, and it works pretty well.
B008DWG5HE,25,0,Wish I would have gone with the I-Pad.
B008DWG5HE,25,1,iPad isn't.
B008DWG5HE,25,2,This tablet makes the iPad obsolete.
B008DWG5HE,25,3,So much better then an iPad!
B008DWG5HE,25,4,And it has everything that my Ipad has.
B008DWG5HE,25,5,I have an Ipad as well as this Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,6,I would rather have all Samsung Note  10.1's then I would Ipads.
B008DWG5HE,25,7,This device runs Android 2.3.
B008DWG5HE,25,8,Samsung's time has come.
B008DWG5HE,25,9,Why would anyone buy an iPad?
B008DWG5HE,25,10,This device is much better than what all the reviews say.
B008DWG5HE,25,11,No iPad bashing from me.
B008DWG5HE,25,12,Problem:  Ipad  or  Samsung Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,13,To me Apple is a niche product.
B008DWG5HE,25,14,I got the Samsung because I am not happy with the iPhone4s and Apple....so I didn't want to get an iPad.
B008DWG5HE,25,15,It can do everything the ipad can plus much more.
B008DWG5HE,25,16,Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,17,This device is very similar to the Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,18,Someone needs to develop an app like Photon the one for Ipad for androids.
B008DWG5HE,25,19,I have owned the original iPad, The iPad 2, The New iPad, HTC Flyer 7" with scribe, original Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and now the Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,20,From that outlook, it is better than the Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,21,I found another app that works better for me.
B008DWG5HE,25,22,Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,25,23,Samsung Galazy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,24,I also didn't like how on ipad you can only line up the Apps in little rows.
B008DWG5HE,26,0,Minus another for that port being for a proprietary power plug.
B008DWG5HE,26,1,However the lack of a HDMI or USB port hampers its versatility.
B008DWG5HE,26,2,Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such.
B008DWG5HE,26,3,You can transfer files but the power output from standard USB ports is not strong enough to power the Note.
B008DWG5HE,26,4,Apparently the output from a PC USB port isn't enough to charge the Note (which I can understand).
B008DWG5HE,26,5,I will, however, note that the utter lack of external ports is disappointing.
B008DWG5HE,26,6,I like the Lightning port better than the old 30 pin connector but still, proprietary?
B008DWG5HE,26,7,I also like that I can connect it to my computer's USB port and use it as an external hard drive.
B008DWG5HE,26,8,Mainly, when I try and charge the Note while using it, the charging cable fits into the bottom of the device.
B008DWG5HE,26,9,I would expect proprietary connectors as part of the draconian iApple ecosystem, but Android devices should all have standard USB ports and separate power sockets.
B008DWG5HE,26,10,This kit provides access to many USB devices (including printers, USB sticks, keyboards, mouses and SD cards).
B008DWG5HE,26,11,It takes less than a minute to recognize the USB Drive, the same time it takes for a laptop to recognize a new USB Drive.
B008DWG5HE,26,12,To plug a flash/thumb drive directly into the Note 10.1 you have to buy a adapter.
B008DWG5HE,26,13,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,26,14,Just be aware, you will NOT be able to charge this baby by simply plugging the charging cable into the USB port of your computer.
B008DWG5HE,26,15,But unless Samsung starts making more pragmatic devices, I'm going to look somewhere else.In short - minus one star for only one port.
B008DWG5HE,26,16,New computing companion.
B008DWG5HE,26,17,The problem from my point of view is that samsung removed the hdmi port and usb port in order to sell accessories.
B008DWG5HE,26,18,Flash not supported.
B008DWG5HE,26,19,Very nice performance, disappointed by the lack of ports.
B008DWG5HE,26,20,I gave this tablet four stars for the Flash reason and that isn't Samsung's doing--it's Adobes!The only other issue I would point out is that this tablet does not have a ready to use USB port like a computer does.
B008DWG5HE,26,21,The cable gets mashed on the bottom of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,26,22,When I plug in a USB external hard drive to the tablet, the tablet tells me that the USB device requires too much power to operate (stick with the thumb drives, or AC adapter powered external HDDs).
B008DWG5HE,26,23,The charging cable that comes with the unit is very short and does not let you charge the unit while using it unless you sit next to the wall outlet.
B008DWG5HE,26,24,The computing power is strong and I can easily multi-task.
B008DWG5HE,27,0,It freezes too often.
B008DWG5HE,27,1,It freezes too often.
B008DWG5HE,27,2,The Android system permits it.
B008DWG5HE,27,3,Keeps freezing and then randomly rebooting.
B008DWG5HE,27,4,Has some issues.
B008DWG5HE,27,5,If you are looking for a tablet that you can actually work from home on get a real tablet with a windows operating system.
B008DWG5HE,27,6,For a while it would freeze up a lot while using the note app.
B008DWG5HE,27,7,Slow, locks up and doesn't do much.
B008DWG5HE,27,8,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,27,9,I'm sure time will cure that issue.
B008DWG5HE,27,10,The device must be reset.
B008DWG5HE,27,11,But as soon as we/she learns the operating system I'm sure it will be just fine.
B008DWG5HE,27,12,Last week it went into a reboot mode and I could not get it to turn off.
B008DWG5HE,27,13,Works perfectly had mine for a few months already.
B008DWG5HE,27,14,I bought first one, during the trial, it freezes soon, So, I returned it and excanged with new one.
B008DWG5HE,27,15,Not only would it freeze up it would lose what I was working on.
B008DWG5HE,27,16,You have to turn it off a lot to get it to work.
B008DWG5HE,27,17,I have yet to see it freeze or get into a state that requires a reboot.
B008DWG5HE,27,18,When I bought this tablet I did a lot of research and I really liked the fact that you can have multiple applications running in the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,27,19,I was set to keep the tablet but it started to have performance issues.
B008DWG5HE,27,20,Weird things like when the screen was locked and I rotated the tablet there would be a flash of the home screen or one of the programs running in the background.
B008DWG5HE,27,21,If you already have the browser in split screen mode, it doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,27,22,I found another app that works better for me.
B008DWG5HE,27,23,But the technology is not there yet.I use chrome browser on this and it seems to freeze a lot on it.May25th- Updated to 3 star after using it some more.
B008DWG5HE,27,24,Unfortunately, only selected apps will work in the multi-window system.
B008DWG5HE,28,0,It took 2 weeks for repairs.
B008DWG5HE,28,1,The shipment received on time.
B008DWG5HE,28,2,According to Samsung customer service it wont be unblocked any time soon.
B008DWG5HE,28,3,Poor Inspection process and Bypassing Customer Service responsbility.
B008DWG5HE,28,4,They said to return it back to sam's club, sam's club says to contact Samsung instead.
B008DWG5HE,28,5,Samsung's customer service experience.
B008DWG5HE,28,6,Samsung customer service is horrible.
B008DWG5HE,28,7,If I bought the product from Amazon, why do I have to contact the maufacturer's Website.
B008DWG5HE,28,8,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,28,9,Made my purchase in February and have had nothing but problems.
B008DWG5HE,28,10,Called customer support and they had me reset it to factory settings.
B008DWG5HE,28,11,I tried a "do it yourself repair that did not work and order a new device.
B008DWG5HE,28,12,People talk about having to call into Samsung support over and over and over again, the flippant attitudes of the support people, and the unwillingness for Samsung to stand behind their product and provide a new unit when it's obvious a unit is defective.For the complete lack of customer support and poor quality/design, I will not be buying ANY Samsung tablet.
B008DWG5HE,28,13,If Amazon is selling a product, I expect Amazon customer service to provide the required service.
B008DWG5HE,28,14,if you purchase their products you are on your own after they get your money.
B008DWG5HE,28,15,This would be ok if it fixed the problem but it didn't.
B008DWG5HE,28,16,I came home and ordered it that day!
B008DWG5HE,28,17,Amazon responded promptly to contact Samsung Website.
B008DWG5HE,28,18,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B008DWG5HE,28,19,I wanted to send this unit back to Amazon.com but Samsung has held up the progress because of the adapter and my 30 days  return warranty has expired with Amazon.I would have never had this problem with Apple.
B008DWG5HE,28,20,Immediately notified Amazon.
B008DWG5HE,28,21,I know little about Apple products.
B008DWG5HE,28,22,I guess I'll have to send it in for service.
B008DWG5HE,28,23,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,28,24,Tried discussing with Samsung support and they were no help.
B008DWG5HE,29,0,However lately when he moves it a certain way the screen gets lines across it and is unreadable.
B008DWG5HE,29,1,If he moves it when that happens, the screen will straighten out for a bit and then go back to lines.
B008DWG5HE,29,2,We can't do anything on it, we can't even get to the home screen without it going nuts.
B008DWG5HE,29,3,The touch screen is great.-the
B008DWG5HE,29,4,Instead, if you want to make a window disappear from the screen, you have to close the app appearing in the window.
B008DWG5HE,29,5,And if you can't find your window, just hit the windows icon on the bottom and it shows a list of open windows.
B008DWG5HE,29,6,You can also resize the windows and move them around.Touch Wiz is on top of Android and Works Seamlessly with it.
B008DWG5HE,29,7,I feel like that is space that can be used for placing more icons or something but when you touch the empty space the home screen will go the next screen over.
B008DWG5HE,29,8,Across several apps functions like zoom cause temporay blackout on screen during active scaling.
B008DWG5HE,29,9,When you are at the home screens, there is like a literal inch on both the left and right sides of the screen where you cannot place apps or anything.
B008DWG5HE,29,10,I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.Bad things (I think)-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful.
B008DWG5HE,29,11,There are times when you press a button or select something with the pen and it does not register, and you have to press a second time.-
B008DWG5HE,29,12,thing to note about the screen.
B008DWG5HE,29,13,I don't have time for that and want it out of the way.I believe that many of the inadvertent activations of these various screens could have been prevented by putting this bottom Home/MiniApps/Notifications bar at the top of the screen like on many phones.
B008DWG5HE,29,14,Switching from one window to another merely requires a tap on the window you want to work in.
B008DWG5HE,29,15,Be careful about screen protectors: most are "squishy" and so don't really work with the stylus.
B008DWG5HE,29,16,I am also disappointed that you can't shrink windows down to a single bar at the bottom of the screen like you can in Microsoft Windows for PC.
B008DWG5HE,29,17,The S-Pen works using magnetic inductance, and therefore, magnets that are within 1 or 2 centimeters of the screen can affect the proper functioning of the S-Pen.
B008DWG5HE,29,18,I need a few apps that work, not 20 where half of them are crap and the other half half work with one or two stand outs.
B008DWG5HE,29,19,Some of the time it will select the link you are trying to open in a web browser and the other times it will select another link close to the tip because it's not tracking correctly.
B008DWG5HE,29,20,If you put a magnet near a spot on the screen (for example: if your tablet case/folio has a magnet for attaching a strap to it, and you then fold the folio so that the magnet is behind your tablet and behind the screen within 1 cm), the S-Pen's position will not match what shows up on the screen.
B008DWG5HE,29,21,Also all the screens and bar at the bottom are Very busy.
B008DWG5HE,29,22,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,29,23,I have had several windows open at one time and noticed no visible lag.
B008DWG5HE,29,24,Lastly, even with touch input turned off, so only the pen will write on the page, the motion of the side of your hand on the screen will occasionally cause the page to move around or inadvertently zoom in or out.These problems were enough to cause me to consider returning the tablet when I first tried it.

B00CYQPM42,0,24,My Kindle Fire.
B00CYQPM42,1,0,Not enough apps.
B00CYQPM42,1,1,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,1,2,There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation.
B00CYQPM42,1,3,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,1,4,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,1,5,not playing videos.
B00CYQPM42,1,6,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,1,7,You know there HAS to be an app for that!
B00CYQPM42,1,8,I have found many useful lifestyle apps (food diaries, calorie counters, etc).
B00CYQPM42,1,9,app.
B00CYQPM42,1,10,Also if i want to install google apps it is possible.
B00CYQPM42,1,11,I'm really enjoying all the Apps and playing "Candycrush"!
B00CYQPM42,1,12,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,1,13,The only downfall is no Google play store access.
B00CYQPM42,1,14,Amazon you need to fix your App store
B00CYQPM42,1,15,They do not play.
B00CYQPM42,1,16,Keep up the good work Amazon!
B00CYQPM42,1,17,I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet.
B00CYQPM42,1,18,my daughter really wanted the furby boom app for her furby and we found out later it was only available through google play..
B00CYQPM42,1,19,LOVE MY KINDLE FIRE. it works great and my faimly can use for various different sites, apps and books on it,
B00CYQPM42,1,20,If Amazon would just switch to Google Play for the app store, then there is nothing that would stop them from ruling the world!
B00CYQPM42,1,21,I watched movies, streamed music, watched video, surfed, read articles and books, used the alarm and calender, used yahoo weather app, played games.
B00CYQPM42,1,22,It also have more free games to download.
B00CYQPM42,1,23,Now, whenever possible, I'm going to download the movie to my tablet, and then watch it from the download.
B00CYQPM42,1,24,But if you want a tablet that has unrestricted access to every app out there, you'll have to look elsewhere.
B00CYQPM42,2,0,Got it at a great price
B00CYQPM42,2,1,Great for the price.
B00CYQPM42,2,2,A great tablet at a great price.

B00CYQPM42,3,15,Light weightBattery life is over 10 hours.

B00CYQPM42,3,17,And the battery life is the best I have ever had.
B00CYQPM42,3,18,Seems battery doesn't last as long as first kindle.
B00CYQPM42,3,19,With the wifi off…battery life is very good.
B00CYQPM42,3,20,There are battery savers that shut down what isn’t needed and does make a difference in battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,21,My previous kindle charged quickly even in use and had an amazing battery life!
B00CYQPM42,3,22,Holds its charge well.
B00CYQPM42,3,23,I expected the battery to last much longer.
B00CYQPM42,3,24,Really good.
B00CYQPM42,4,0,Sound good.
B00CYQPM42,4,1,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,2,This feels really good in your hand and the screen is BEAUTIFUL.
B00CYQPM42,4,3,Very nice display
B00CYQPM42,4,4,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,4,5,very nice apps, the resolution and sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,6,Clear picture, quality sound.
B00CYQPM42,4,7,Sound is really good (not home theater quality or anything) but better than any phone I've heard.
B00CYQPM42,4,8,Really great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,9,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,10,Decent sound
B00CYQPM42,4,11,The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.
B00CYQPM42,4,12,Very nice tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,13,I feel like the hd speakers are a little better than this, but not much.
B00CYQPM42,4,14,The HD quality is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,15,This is a good product that was I expected to be because it has a better screen and more features than any other tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,16,found the speakers to have decent sound.
B00CYQPM42,4,17,The screen is fantastic and the speakers produce great sound that is fairly loud.
B00CYQPM42,4,18,And the sound!
B00CYQPM42,4,19,I would tell anyone that this is a great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,20,Very nice display and a high quality tablet in general.
B00CYQPM42,4,21,Just as good or even better than the Apple ipad.
B00CYQPM42,4,22,The built in speakers are also better than my iPad 1.
B00CYQPM42,4,23,The sound is also much better and louder.
B00CYQPM42,4,24,the audio books sound very good
B00CYQPM42,5,0,that isn't really a camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,1,this is not good because it does not seem you can take a picture of something you are looking at.
B00CYQPM42,5,2,I did not like the way the camera was.
B00CYQPM42,5,3,Takes great pictures!
B00CYQPM42,5,4,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,5,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,6,It could only be more perfect if it had a front facing camera!
B00CYQPM42,5,7,she does however have a problem with the camera part, apparently you can only take pictures that are facing the front of the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,5,8,I also don't like the front only camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,9,I don't like just front camera ure feature..rather, I prefer rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,10,Works great.
B00CYQPM42,5,11,The picture quality is absurd.
B00CYQPM42,5,12,As great as the ads said it would be!
B00CYQPM42,5,13,The built in camera is so nice and takes anexcellent picture.
B00CYQPM42,5,14,I ONLY WISH THE CAMERA WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
B00CYQPM42,5,15,The camera is awesome...
B00CYQPM42,5,16,Picture is clear, color is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,17,The camera could be a little better, but very nice to be able to Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,18,VERY GOOD! Love this thing...........except the camera is on the WRONG side.
B00CYQPM42,5,19,My only love about it is the camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,20,don't need a picture of my ugly mug looking at my kindle.
B00CYQPM42,5,21,#1 the camera on this model is only front facing but it seems that on all of the other HDX models that are larger they have a front AND rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,22,You need a camera for Skype or other video app.-
B00CYQPM42,5,23,The only draw back is that the camera lens is on the front (facing you) so the only thing you can really do is take selfies, which I DON'T do.
B00CYQPM42,5,24,Very easy to use and the picture quality is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,6,0,The processor is fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,1,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,6,2,A great tablet at a great price.
B00CYQPM42,6,3,Great tablet at a great price...
B00CYQPM42,6,4,Fast, very fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,5,The screen is beautiful and it is incredibly fast!
B00CYQPM42,6,6,Awesome screen.
B00CYQPM42,6,7,Amazing, Fast, Beautiful display.
B00CYQPM42,6,8,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,6,9,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,6,10,The improved 'carousel' and apps screen is also a nice improvement.
B00CYQPM42,6,11,The screen resolution is perfect.
B00CYQPM42,6,12,Display is amazingly sharp, and the android OS is very fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,13,The unit has a lovely display, it's responsive and a great overall tablet.
B00CYQPM42,6,14,like he says, it does it all, and the graphics are great and so easy to take along wherever you go.
B00CYQPM42,6,15,the quad core processing unit makes gaming easy and reading smooth.
B00CYQPM42,6,16,The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD.
B00CYQPM42,6,17,Great Value for Optimal Performance.
B00CYQPM42,6,18,Great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,6,19,It's extremely faster now, light weight, the screen is amazingly clear.
B00CYQPM42,6,20,The graphics are great.
B00CYQPM42,6,21,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,6,22,This thing is great!
B00CYQPM42,6,23,Display and refresh are great!
B00CYQPM42,6,24,Screen is gorgeous and so clear it's like 3D at times.
B00CYQPM42,7,0,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,7,1,She has so much more storage space.
B00CYQPM42,7,2,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,7,3,The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB.
B00CYQPM42,7,4,However, this tablet is so much faster and with the 64 GB of storage I can do so much more.
B00CYQPM42,7,5,MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229.
B00CYQPM42,7,6,vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video.
B00CYQPM42,7,7,Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover.
B00CYQPM42,7,8,64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB.
B00CYQPM42,7,9,Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality.
B00CYQPM42,7,10,Very good device otherwise,but unfortunately they don't tell you that 16 g (really 12gig due to internal system requirements) is not enough to download a movie in hd.
B00CYQPM42,7,11,16g not enough to download hd movies!
B00CYQPM42,7,12,In this day and age, a table ought to have a Micro SD memory card slot for expansion, and an HDMI connector - ESPECIALLY a media tablet like these!
B00CYQPM42,7,13,32GB will provide you more memory space for pics, hd movies, etc. Apps eat up a lot of memory quickly.I recommend that Amazon provide the approx number of movies etc can be stored on each kindle model with its specs.
B00CYQPM42,7,14,This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size.
B00CYQPM42,7,15,For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL
B00CYQPM42,7,16,too many slot pop ups.
B00CYQPM42,7,17,About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download.
B00CYQPM42,7,18,Love the cloud for storage for my pictures so I can show off my grandkids any time.
B00CYQPM42,7,19,GB) of storage per hour.
B00CYQPM42,7,20,Movies, books, audio, and apps all run in superior order, with the only down side, is memory expandability (an extra slot for loading more solid state memory as a card).
B00CYQPM42,7,21,But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased.
B00CYQPM42,7,22,If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.
B00CYQPM42,7,23,This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,7,24,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,8,0,I know they are working on it , but not fixed yet.
B00CYQPM42,8,1,Love It!! What a great device!!
B00CYQPM42,8,2,Good device.
B00CYQPM42,8,3,Web cripple.
B00CYQPM42,8,4,I am having problems with the WiFi hookup on occasion, but I'm sure there is an explanation for it.
B00CYQPM42,8,5,Also love Fashioning and web surfing on it.
B00CYQPM42,8,6,Great for watching movies and surfing the web.
B00CYQPM42,8,7,The 7" is working great.
B00CYQPM42,8,8,Good browser.
B00CYQPM42,8,9,It works very well for music, reading docucuments and general web page browsing mhm habit video watching I is quite unreliable.
B00CYQPM42,8,10,I love this device!
B00CYQPM42,8,11,This is a great device at an exceptional price.
B00CYQPM42,8,12,Is an easy way to surf trough internet.
B00CYQPM42,8,13,Otherwise a v good device for a commuter who likes to watch a movie while traveling to and fro work each day,display is exceptional.
B00CYQPM42,8,14,Great traveling companion.
B00CYQPM42,8,15,I found it very easy to connect to the Wi-Fi in each hotel we stayed at.
B00CYQPM42,8,16,Fast, very fast.
B00CYQPM42,8,17,The wifi is fast.
B00CYQPM42,8,18,It's all new to us  not like our laptop but good for reading The mayday button is the best thing I ever seem in any device I have used can't believe it's so easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,8,19,I wish I had the money to have several of these devices....sometimes i don't need the full pc desktop but have a certain need and this device makes it possible and does so smoothly very good device very good tool.
B00CYQPM42,8,20,I can check my email and go to Facebook instead of always going to my computer.
B00CYQPM42,8,21,I love being able to check e-mail on it also.
B00CYQPM42,8,22,I use it for not only reading but gaming, email, and surfing the net.
B00CYQPM42,8,23,It is so easy to run and does so many things.'
B00CYQPM42,8,24,It's easy to use and provides a high-quality experience for reading e-Books, browsing the Internet and watching video.
B00CYQPM42,9,0,I am enjoying it so far other than that screen being a little small for me I think it has terrific features.
B00CYQPM42,9,1,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,9,2,The notepad app. is a nice feature.
B00CYQPM42,9,3,The touch sceen on the iPad also works a lot smoother and is more accurate.
B00CYQPM42,9,4,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,9,5,I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).
B00CYQPM42,9,6,I love the ability to highlight, write notes, etc. on books and PDF files.
B00CYQPM42,9,7,Very sensitive to the touch.
B00CYQPM42,9,8,I love this because it substitutes for my laptop and is easier to carry with me in my purse.
B00CYQPM42,9,9,What I do like is when it does work it's pretty accurate as far as words.
B00CYQPM42,9,10,The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen.
B00CYQPM42,9,11,Otherwise this product is great!
B00CYQPM42,9,12,Got a Poetic magnetic cover and it works great!
B00CYQPM42,9,13,I am using it to write this review, actually.
B00CYQPM42,9,14,The reason I only gave it  4 stars is some of the features that come with it don't work as they should.
B00CYQPM42,9,15,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,9,16,I'm glad it has the swype to text feature big plus over the Apple keyboard(4S).Reading is easy on the eyes the glare sometimes fools you though.Id like to have a home button to use because the side bar feature sometimes gets in the way of using an app.
B00CYQPM42,9,17,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,9,18,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,9,19,pretty AWESOME.
B00CYQPM42,9,20,Excellence in the palm of my hand.
B00CYQPM42,9,21,This is a good product that was I expected to be because it has a better screen and more features than any other tablet.
B00CYQPM42,9,22,Easy to use, lots of apps, light weight, and the screen is very clear.
B00CYQPM42,9,23,It was right there for free in the app store and works beautifully on this device.
B00CYQPM42,9,24,It also has a great functional cover.
B00CYQPM42,10,0,love love love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,1,I love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,2,love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,3,And the possibilities are endless!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!

B00CYQPM42,10,15,LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new Kindle!!
B00CYQPM42,10,16,I Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,17,Love this tablet!
B00CYQPM42,10,18,Love it!!
B00CYQPM42,10,19,Love it, love it!!
B00CYQPM42,10,20,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,21,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,22,love it!
B00CYQPM42,10,23,I love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,24,LOVE IT
B00CYQPM42,11,0,Only thing that is really lacking is a USB port otherwise it is a great little product.
B00CYQPM42,11,1,But charging is very fast using the included charger.
B00CYQPM42,11,2,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,11,3,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,11,4,Can convert to work as a stand or handheld with attached elastic strap to use on the go.
B00CYQPM42,11,5,Everything works great, but the battery life is not nearly as long as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,11,6,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,11,7,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,11,8,(Yes, there are ways to extend battery life, such as turning off wifi when not using it.
B00CYQPM42,11,9,Movies look great, games look great, photos and games look great.
B00CYQPM42,11,10,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,11,11,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,11,12,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,11,13,Was so impressed I bought another one for my son.Ted A
B00CYQPM42,11,14,Then they took away the HDMI port which I use often to play a movies on my TV.
B00CYQPM42,11,15,Otherwise a v good device for a commuter who likes to watch a movie while traveling to and fro work each day,display is exceptional.
B00CYQPM42,11,16,Great Small Tablet; Love It!
B00CYQPM42,11,17,The Lack of even a mini USB port.
B00CYQPM42,11,18,Easy to use, lots of apps, light weight, and the screen is very clear.
B00CYQPM42,11,19,The display quality is truly awesome, the screen size is perfect for games and reading.
B00CYQPM42,11,20,Watching movies works for me - the 7" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.
B00CYQPM42,11,21,It is very easy to use, has great battery life, and is light in your hands.
B00CYQPM42,11,22,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,11,23,And, I got Temple Run Oz (finally) which was not compatible with the original Fire.There are some design features I don't like, such as the way the charger sticks in at an angle.
B00CYQPM42,11,24,Amazon is including a plug adapter so you can actually charge the device through a regular electrical outlet.
B00CYQPM42,12,0,Great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,12,1,Good tablet overall but the thing is the appstore its has about 10x less than the apple apps in the appstore
B00CYQPM42,12,2,Love Love Love.
B00CYQPM42,12,3,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,12,4,They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.
B00CYQPM42,12,5,So far this thing is GREAT.
B00CYQPM42,12,6,The only thing is that the HDX has a different look for the Android Operating System which is actually very nice.
B00CYQPM42,12,7,Easy to navigate.love
B00CYQPM42,12,8,Good Enough.
B00CYQPM42,12,9,I love it so far.
B00CYQPM42,12,10,It is so easy to run and does so many things.'
B00CYQPM42,12,11,Operates fast and smooth.
B00CYQPM42,12,12,There is VERY little customization, my android phone is much more user interface friendly, this, this is just messy.If you can manage through the funky menu system it's a good device, good reader, good gamer, good surfer, just lousy interface, not overly user friendly at all.
B00CYQPM42,12,13,Great picture, sound, operating system, Freetime is perfect, and miracast is SO cool!
B00CYQPM42,12,14,The hardware is excellent, and the user interface is pretty good as well.
B00CYQPM42,12,15,This thing is great!
B00CYQPM42,12,16,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,12,17,easy to navigate.can
B00CYQPM42,12,18,The good and the bad.
B00CYQPM42,12,19,I love it!
B00CYQPM42,12,20,Love it!!!
B00CYQPM42,12,21,Great display, very good sound, extremely easy to navigate.
B00CYQPM42,12,22,It would not operate.
B00CYQPM42,12,23,Android based little powerhouse.
B00CYQPM42,12,24,The touch sceen on the iPad also works a lot smoother and is more accurate.
B00CYQPM42,13,0,Great product!
B00CYQPM42,13,1,Congratulations to Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,13,2,If I had known I wouldn't have purchased this product.
B00CYQPM42,13,3,I returned this product.
B00CYQPM42,13,4,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,13,5,Great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,6,Great customer service!!
B00CYQPM42,13,7,Keep up the great work Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,13,8,Thank you amazon....
B00CYQPM42,13,9,Thank you Amazon for making such a wonderful product and for having such wonderful customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,10,Plus great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,11,Great for Grandpa!
B00CYQPM42,13,12,Thank you, Amazon!
B00CYQPM42,13,13,This product will replace iPads in no time.My Dad loves the MayDay.
B00CYQPM42,13,14,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,13,15,You now must purchase an additional product from amazon at a cost of around $100.
B00CYQPM42,13,16,I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one.
B00CYQPM42,13,17,fast shipping.
B00CYQPM42,13,18,So I contacted Amazon customer service and let me just say they really are as amazing as everyone says!
B00CYQPM42,13,19,Thank you, Amazon, for creating such a great product.
B00CYQPM42,13,20,I was able to purchase this product during Amazon's wonderful Cyber Monday sale.
B00CYQPM42,13,21,It’s not like it used to be, buy our product and use it as you wish.
B00CYQPM42,13,22,Great!
B00CYQPM42,13,23,Thank you Amazon!
B00CYQPM42,13,24,I think they are a great value and being backed by amazon means they will be supported for a long time.
B00CYQPM42,14,0,It works very sporadic.
B00CYQPM42,14,1,I also own a Samsung Note 8, several iPads and have several other tablets as well.
B00CYQPM42,14,2,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,14,3,Good Product!
B00CYQPM42,14,4,My next was an iPad 2 and then a Microsoft Surface Pro.
B00CYQPM42,14,5,Otherwise this product is great!
B00CYQPM42,14,6,They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.
B00CYQPM42,14,7,Not the best tablet, but perhaps the best value.
B00CYQPM42,14,8,It still has a lot of kinks to be worked out.
B00CYQPM42,14,9,One in three times it will work.
B00CYQPM42,14,10,The reason I only gave it  4 stars is some of the features that come with it don't work as they should.
B00CYQPM42,14,11,If you can afford it the iPad is two times the machine.
B00CYQPM42,14,12,While it's not perfect, it still provides the same functions you would find in other tablets (some of which are better).
B00CYQPM42,14,13,Thirdly, everything seems to work nicely.
B00CYQPM42,14,14,This device is the best digital do hicky I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,14,15,Although it's old tech now, one thing I love about Samsung products is they LAST.
B00CYQPM42,14,16,There are a few financial apps that are not compatible with the tablet that are compatible with my other smart phones.
B00CYQPM42,14,17,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,14,18,Just as good or even better than the Apple ipad.
B00CYQPM42,14,19,Good tablet overall but the thing is the appstore its has about 10x less than the apple apps in the appstore
B00CYQPM42,14,20,This tablet also doesn't have flash along with all modern Android and Apple products.
B00CYQPM42,14,21,best !!!!!!!!!!!
B00CYQPM42,14,22,I wish I had the money to have several of these devices....sometimes i don't need the full pc desktop but have a certain need and this device makes it possible and does so smoothly very good device very good tool.
B00CYQPM42,14,23,size wise, it's the best.
B00CYQPM42,14,24,Love it!
B00CYQPM42,15,0,Very Clear Screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,1,The only other problem I have noticed is with the screen resolution.
B00CYQPM42,15,2,It is just a slight blue haze at the borders--when displaying white--of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,3,Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.
B00CYQPM42,15,4,The screen is very clear and the options for use are almost endless.
B00CYQPM42,15,5,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,15,6,I have noticed my screen flickers when I am using an app that has color (basically everything except reading).
B00CYQPM42,15,7,As for the rest, the screen is very sharp, and colors are great.
B00CYQPM42,15,8,Not sure if you can change the screen rotation.
B00CYQPM42,15,9,The screen resolution, colors, and brightness as well as the sound quality cannot be matched by the other tablets out there.
B00CYQPM42,15,10,screen is sharp.
B00CYQPM42,15,11,The interface is polished, the screen is bright and sharp.
B00CYQPM42,15,12,I'd prefer a cream color (the stark white is a bit too bright for me) with dark black text.
B00CYQPM42,15,13,Side by side the 7's reading screen on white looked "dirty" compared to the 8.9's crisp whiteness (same purple haze on both sadly).
B00CYQPM42,15,14,The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.
B00CYQPM42,15,15,Watching movies works for me - the 7" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.
B00CYQPM42,15,16,The screen is sharp as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,15,17,I did not noticed until I started reading about it.
B00CYQPM42,15,18,I do not like the blue lighting around the edges, it something resets and even with a black background (to avoid the blue lighting) it has a light flicker.
B00CYQPM42,15,19,The fact that you can't change the background of the screens home to anything you want.
B00CYQPM42,15,20,The only drawback is the light blue border when the screen is white.
B00CYQPM42,15,21,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,15,22,Reading, movies, games, etc are shown in perfect HD resolution.NOTE - The blue pixel edge issue is there, but it is not distracting to me.
B00CYQPM42,15,23,The "Recommended for you" display on the home screen is now smaller and much less obtrusive (and it can be turned off in the settings).
B00CYQPM42,15,24,The display is very nice and video and video games look great, but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device.The not so great things about the Kindle HDX 16 GB.1.
B00CYQPM42,16,0,Does not do Google plus and most apps...
B00CYQPM42,16,1,To few apps.
B00CYQPM42,16,2,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,16,3,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,16,4,All it needs is a suitable app store.
B00CYQPM42,16,5,App store is awful!!!!!!!!!!
B00CYQPM42,16,6,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,16,7,Amazon you need to fix your App store
B00CYQPM42,16,8,Why is there no app for an update for Flash Player?
B00CYQPM42,16,9,There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation.
B00CYQPM42,16,10,No podcast player app.
B00CYQPM42,16,11,With an Android device, you can access the Amazon Android store, but with a Kindle Fire, you cannot access the Google Play store.
B00CYQPM42,16,12,No YouTube app.
B00CYQPM42,16,13,Runs on a android system but does not allow google play.
B00CYQPM42,16,14,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,16,15,So some websites with videos cant play the videos.
B00CYQPM42,16,16,Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more.
B00CYQPM42,16,17,By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.
B00CYQPM42,16,18,I can't download any videos as I get an error that it is already downloaded to another one of my devices!!
B00CYQPM42,16,19,Now we can both play the games.
B00CYQPM42,16,20,It's quite obvious if any Amazon App store guys have even tried to install this Magic 2014 game that it just won't install.
B00CYQPM42,16,21,I was disappointed to find that the system on my kindle fire, will not do google plus store or other android apps!
B00CYQPM42,16,22,The child or toddler apps I did download would freeze, not only the app but also the tablet!
B00CYQPM42,16,23,No Google Chromecast.
B00CYQPM42,16,24,If you want a legitimate version of any Google product, or many other Google play apps, you cannot install it without a side-load situation.
B00CYQPM42,17,0,My son (8) bought this with his own money.
B00CYQPM42,17,1,I wish I never bought it!
B00CYQPM42,17,2,I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter.
B00CYQPM42,17,3,I bought two of these for Christmas, one for me one and one as a gift, at $179.
B00CYQPM42,17,4,It was a Christmas present.
B00CYQPM42,17,5,This was a Christmas gift for our son.
B00CYQPM42,17,6,This is the most expensive waste of money!
B00CYQPM42,17,7,I am really disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,8,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,9,I purchased this as a gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,10,Christmas Gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,11,Wish I had purchased something else.
B00CYQPM42,17,12,Save your money and purchase Google/Android.
B00CYQPM42,17,13,The same thing happened when I bought the Kindle Paperwhite a  year ago.
B00CYQPM42,17,14,OfficeSuite is read only, must purchase for $4.99, price is not bad.
B00CYQPM42,17,15,If I had to do it again, I would not buy it and I want to send it back
B00CYQPM42,17,16,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,17,They will not provide me with a replacement since I gave the Kindle as a Christmas gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,18,Great Christmas gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,19,Disappointing.
B00CYQPM42,17,20,This is my first time with a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,17,21,Do not purchase as a gift or you will have a hard time getting warranty replacement.
B00CYQPM42,17,22,It's frustrating, but nothing to keep you from buying this Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,17,23,I guess I'm going to pay $200 more for and Ipad which I didn't want to do in the first place.
B00CYQPM42,17,24,wait before you buy.
B00CYQPM42,18,0,The battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,18,1,Battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,18,2,Cannot turn it off.
B00CYQPM42,18,3,The first one after less than a week woudn't charge.. Sent it back and they sent us a new one.
B00CYQPM42,18,4,I don't want to have to turn on Quiet Time all the time just to get this to stop.
B00CYQPM42,18,5,One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,6,The Kindle recently died, the battery cannot be charged, even when using a different charger.
B00CYQPM42,18,7,Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours.
B00CYQPM42,18,8,I have to hold the power button down for 15 seconds or more for it to shut off.
B00CYQPM42,18,9,Low battery life.
B00CYQPM42,18,10,If the cord is propped up I can leave it plugged in all night and it won't charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,11,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,12,The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger.
B00CYQPM42,18,13,The battery charger is faulty and the only way I can charge the kindle is to prop up the cord.
B00CYQPM42,18,14,Battery life is great so far.-
B00CYQPM42,18,15,Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%.
B00CYQPM42,18,16,The kindle came to me holding a charge so I could instantaneously turn it on and play with it.
B00CYQPM42,18,17,Every time I turn the tablet on I get  advertising.
B00CYQPM42,18,18,Something's amiss here.What is going on with this, TILTED power plug/charger?
B00CYQPM42,18,19,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,18,20,Fully charged at 100% and left over night will find the device down to 88% without use.
B00CYQPM42,18,21,I bought this for my 7 year old and it worked fine at first but now it keeps freezing up and we can't turn it off or anything it just freezes on whatever she was doing playing the music on and on can't even power it down until the battery dies wouldn't recommend this product.
B00CYQPM42,18,22,I just can't have a device that I am constantly worried about keeping charged all the time.
B00CYQPM42,18,23,Battery - I get a couple days of heavy usage (8 hours) out of it.
B00CYQPM42,18,24,I have this unit for several weeks now and since then I have experienced a couple of slow down response and three "blue screens" although the unit is 40%, 80 % and 55 % charged, the first time it came back after 4 hours, the second and third time after several minutes.
B00CYQPM42,19,0,In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough.
B00CYQPM42,19,1,I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones.
B00CYQPM42,19,2,If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side.
B00CYQPM42,19,3,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,19,4,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,19,5,Sound, power, silly-pretty display, feel...and did I mention power???
B00CYQPM42,19,6,The volume is a bit louder (when NOT using earphones) on the HD.
B00CYQPM42,19,7,The power button and volume control have been moved.
B00CYQPM42,19,8,I bought headphones so that I can hear all video-play clearly and well.
B00CYQPM42,19,9,A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find!
B00CYQPM42,19,10,Love the easier-to-locate design of the on/off button and external volume control button too.
B00CYQPM42,19,11,It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers.
B00CYQPM42,19,12,I wish the on/off button was located on the top or side in stead  of the bottom.
B00CYQPM42,19,13,With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste.
B00CYQPM42,19,14,The speakers are located in the top, when in landscape mode, which is somewhat different from many other tablets, and adds to the usefulness of the tablet for watching videos.
B00CYQPM42,19,15,Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me.
B00CYQPM42,19,16,IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side.
B00CYQPM42,19,17,It sounds like I am sitting in a surround sound movie theater.
B00CYQPM42,19,18,I also wished the speakers were in the front, but I am not complaining too much on that one.
B00CYQPM42,19,19,Even with my Kindle, the top pantel where the speakers are started to peel off a bit (amazon used glue to assemble the speaker grille top panel).
B00CYQPM42,19,20,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,19,21,found the speakers to have decent sound.
B00CYQPM42,19,22,The quality of videos (TV and movies) are HD magnificent.
B00CYQPM42,19,23,Great, but needs a couple small tweeks.
B00CYQPM42,19,24,Users can get confused with volume buttons on the other side.
B00CYQPM42,20,0,The poor quality front facing only camera on it.
B00CYQPM42,20,1,The HDX has a front facing camera, but lacks a rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,2,It also doesn't have a rear facing camera, it only has a front facing one, like for apps such as Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,3,The 7” version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.
B00CYQPM42,20,4,Also the camera is the worst part, the camera is only on the front of the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,5,Very good better than what a t I expected.The only thing is the camera it only have front and not back.But I guess that's why it have the kindle hdx8.9 cause that have both.
B00CYQPM42,20,6,The only camera is on the front side (screen side), so taking video or a picture with it is difficult because you can't see the screen.
B00CYQPM42,20,7,I would give this a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the problems I have had with getting Skype to work.
B00CYQPM42,20,8,I bought the unit over the nook because it stated that the unit had a camera, but did not specify that it was only and front facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,9,I had hoped I would be able to use it to take pictures and video as well as use it for video chat.
B00CYQPM42,20,10,If you take the time to put a camera, why not make give it a front and rear with more megapixels to really compete with other tablets?
B00CYQPM42,20,11,Other than that it's pretty decent could have a better camera and a back facing one ...I did return it for a galaxy tablet that I am much more happy with.
B00CYQPM42,20,12,The only pictures you can take of are yourself because if you turn it around you can't see what you are taking a picture of.
B00CYQPM42,20,13,You need a camera for Skype or other video app.-
B00CYQPM42,20,14,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,15,Only thing I'd change is the camera on the outside for pics not of myself
B00CYQPM42,20,16,she does however have a problem with the camera part, apparently you can only take pictures that are facing the front of the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,17,I can now take pics and store/edit/save them - I didn't realize how much of a difference that makes to me (even if I can only take the pics from the front of the Kindle with this model).
B00CYQPM42,20,18,It looked like a regular camera picture.
B00CYQPM42,20,19,It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,20,Very disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,20,21,I perhaps would have liked the buy the double camera better but I didn't realize the camera only shoots forward at yourself rather than a normal pic (unless I'm missing something).
B00CYQPM42,20,22,Like last year's model, there is no rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,23,The Nexus 7 has both a rear and a front camera, while the Fire HDX only has a front camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,24,Not what I expected, camera is not adjustable and you have to play with it.
B00CYQPM42,21,0,Compared to a nexus 7 which is the same price, the HDX seems to have a slower processor.
B00CYQPM42,21,1,For the price it has its drawbacks such as often freezing when the battery gets low.
B00CYQPM42,21,2,All in all it's okay, but I feel I could have done better with my 200 bucks by getting a nexus 7.
B00CYQPM42,21,3,Does not do Google plus and most apps...
B00CYQPM42,21,4,The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory.
B00CYQPM42,21,5,All things being equal, I would expect the Nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance, particularly in areas where the connection is spotty.Size and Weight:HDX: 7.3" x 5.0" x 0.35" and 10.7 oz.Nexus: 7.9" x 4.5" x 0.34" and 10.24 oz.iPad Mini: 7.87" x 5.3" x 0.29" and 11.68 oz.There's really nothing to choose from here.
B00CYQPM42,21,6,The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi.
B00CYQPM42,21,7,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,21,8,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,21,9,I don't feel like I should have side load.
B00CYQPM42,21,10,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,21,11,Everything works great, but the battery life is not nearly as long as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,21,12,The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna.
B00CYQPM42,21,13,Battery life isn't great compared to the iPad.
B00CYQPM42,21,14,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,21,15,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,21,16,Great Device, Better than expected.
B00CYQPM42,21,17,Both are priced at $229 vs. $399 for the new iPad Mini.
B00CYQPM42,21,18,After all, words or graphic don't appear on the edges of the screen.Battery life - Still needs work onAfter the OS update, there seems to be a slight improvement with the battery life.
B00CYQPM42,21,19,Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app.
B00CYQPM42,21,20,I like how several of the apps respond better on the HDX.
B00CYQPM42,21,21,However its overall usefulness overrides this annoying tendency.
B00CYQPM42,21,22,Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.
B00CYQPM42,21,23,I assessed several different tablets, making charts on hardware, performance' pros & con's etc.
B00CYQPM42,21,24,The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD.
B00CYQPM42,22,0,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,1,It is REALLY hard to quit apps.
B00CYQPM42,22,2,Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage.
B00CYQPM42,22,3,I also like that there is a "on device" and "cloud" app storage so I can move apps to the Cloud when I don't want them for a time.
B00CYQPM42,22,4,But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing.
B00CYQPM42,22,5,It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2.
B00CYQPM42,22,6,Still having a few problems finding things on this one, after I got used to the last model.
B00CYQPM42,22,7,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,22,8,Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge.
B00CYQPM42,22,9,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,22,10,The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!
B00CYQPM42,22,11,The lack of onboard storage (which was promoted earlier on as a none issue for modern users) has turned a real problem and the 16GB version actually leaves the user with closer to 8 or 9GB than the 16GB advertised.
B00CYQPM42,22,12,The fact that the device does not support storage expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,13,So now I'm forced to either purchase additional space or be satisfied with what's there.
B00CYQPM42,22,14,Downloading and Installing problem occursThe app store after 2 month is still a bit lacking.
B00CYQPM42,22,15,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,22,16,I don't have any complaints or suggestions for future changes so far (except maybe to quit tempting me with new models for a while!).
B00CYQPM42,22,17,The app store remains a problem if you depend on apps for games.
B00CYQPM42,22,18,My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats.
B00CYQPM42,22,19,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,22,20,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,22,21,files, you may not find all the apps you want or need - at this time.
B00CYQPM42,22,22,It has plenrty of memory to keep everything you've ever opened up and running, but dang what A pain to quit.
B00CYQPM42,22,23,32GB will provide you more memory space for pics, hd movies, etc. Apps eat up a lot of memory quickly.I recommend that Amazon provide the approx number of movies etc can be stored on each kindle model with its specs.
B00CYQPM42,22,24,By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.
B00CYQPM42,23,0,WIFI Connectivity.
B00CYQPM42,23,1,Won't Connect to my Wireless Router.
B00CYQPM42,23,2,My other devices have never had an issue.
B00CYQPM42,23,3,wi-fi drops constantly.
B00CYQPM42,23,4,even that would not work.
B00CYQPM42,23,5,i got this particular model so i could have internet/ wifi anywhere.
B00CYQPM42,23,6,The wi-fi connection drops constantly for no apparent reason.
B00CYQPM42,23,7,It is hard and slow to connect to WiFI unlike my other Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,8,Next time i will take the ipad.
B00CYQPM42,23,9,Thus, I ran into the very same connectivity issues that I had with my old Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,10,It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day.
B00CYQPM42,23,11,Today, I was at Starbucks, where I tried connecting to the internet through their free WIFI service, but failed to connect.
B00CYQPM42,23,12,Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems.
B00CYQPM42,23,13,Whenever I would connect to Wifi the Kindle would shut down and reboot.
B00CYQPM42,23,14,If the connection issues were resolved, I would give this 5 stars.
B00CYQPM42,23,15,I have a slow internet connection, and only one option for a service provider.
B00CYQPM42,23,16,it constantly loses my wi-fi singnal (at least 2-3 times per day).
B00CYQPM42,23,17,Some days it works fine but once it starts acting up, it will continuously drop connection every 2 - 10 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,23,18,I don't want to have to turn on Quiet Time all the time just to get this to stop.
B00CYQPM42,23,19,I find this rather funny as I mentioned this is a software specific problem with the installation and has nothing to do with my modem or Internet connection.
B00CYQPM42,23,20,I spend a lot of time in places where I cannot get phone or wifi signals.
B00CYQPM42,23,21,but when i watch them on my HDX they time out whenever the commercial break happens, I have to actually exit the app ,go into my wifi , turn it off, and then back on again to get it to work!
B00CYQPM42,23,22,The HDX apparently only works wireless.
B00CYQPM42,23,23,At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem.
B00CYQPM42,23,24,I've even been to places that only use one device in there home and have way better internet than me and my kindle still does this !
B00CYQPM42,24,0,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,24,1,Like HDX very much and wish a touch cover like keyboard case to make it more productive.
B00CYQPM42,24,2,The only thing I don't like is the keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,24,3,For example, something like Surface touch cover.
B00CYQPM42,24,4,Now I just have to find a pretty case for it!!
B00CYQPM42,24,5,I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times.
B00CYQPM42,24,6,My only complaint about this product is that it's way too sensitive to touch.
B00CYQPM42,24,7,I wish Amazon could come out some keyboard case for HDX.
B00CYQPM42,24,8,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,9,The back is a hard rubber, which is rubbery enough not to be slippery, but not so rubbery that it's mushy.SCREEN - The HDX has a 1920 x 1200 screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,10,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,24,11,I'm not too fond of the cover I ordered because it doesn't hold the stylus - bet that stylus will be lost in a day..lol
B00CYQPM42,24,12,Will need to find a way to change the keyboard layout.
B00CYQPM42,24,13,I bought this for my wife and have had it maybe month and everything stopped working can not even unlock screen when you reset it.
B00CYQPM42,24,14,Unbeknowing to me at the time the cover had the ability to shut down the HDX when either folded back or closed.
B00CYQPM42,24,15,I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).
B00CYQPM42,24,16,For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit.
B00CYQPM42,24,17,I did not noticed until I started reading about it.
B00CYQPM42,24,18,whilst in the states as I spend a lot of time there.
B00CYQPM42,24,19,The first problem was that even though I marked it as a "gift" it was registered in my name.
B00CYQPM42,24,20,You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on.
B00CYQPM42,24,21,It's more of an annoyance than a problem.
B00CYQPM42,24,22,I even showed my grown daughter the "offending" screen (saying nothing of the complaints) asking her if she saw anything, anything at all unusual or bothersome about the reading screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,23,I'm sure that there are many more things I can do with it besides read books, but need to take the time to work with it.
B00CYQPM42,24,24,I am going to hold on to my device until mid November and see what happens
B00CYQPM42,25,0,So it would have been obvious to just get the iPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,1,Galaxy tab, Nexus, iPad, iPad mini).
B00CYQPM42,25,2,Next time I'm buying an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,3,Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.
B00CYQPM42,25,4,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,25,5,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,25,6,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,25,7,Disappointing after owning an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,8,;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.
B00CYQPM42,25,9,I got this because my Android phone's screen was too small for reading and some gaming and note taking.
B00CYQPM42,25,10,This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.
B00CYQPM42,25,11,Cheaper than an ipad mini with a better screen, this device is a no brainer.
B00CYQPM42,25,12,It took some time getting used to from android and ipad but I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested.
B00CYQPM42,25,13,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,25,14,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,25,15,Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them.
B00CYQPM42,25,16,First things first; the screen!
B00CYQPM42,25,17,It's not like comparing apples to oranges.
B00CYQPM42,25,18,It also feels better in the hand then other tablets.As with all non-iOS products, it doesn't have all of the apps or usability that I'd like, but that will come with time.
B00CYQPM42,25,19,Now that I can actually use the screen I can see that the device isn't worth it.
B00CYQPM42,25,20,I have used, recently, a Nexus 7 (2013) and an iPad Air.
B00CYQPM42,25,21,Great tablet, but again the 7" screen doesn't cut it.
B00CYQPM42,25,22,Although it should be mentioned that this may be partially be design, since there are many apps that do not work (yet) on this kindle's version of android.
B00CYQPM42,25,23,This thing is great!
B00CYQPM42,25,24,You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.
B00CYQPM42,26,0,The Lack of even a mini USB port.
B00CYQPM42,26,1,Micro USB Connector - Bite it Apple!
B00CYQPM42,26,2,For the first time ever - a plug adapter is included!
B00CYQPM42,26,3,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,26,4,The USB port sticks out at an odd angle, making it difficult to plug in.
B00CYQPM42,26,5,I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.
B00CYQPM42,26,6,Amazon is including a plug adapter so you can actually charge the device through a regular electrical outlet.
B00CYQPM42,26,7,Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away.
B00CYQPM42,26,8,The placement of the USB port for charger is a great improvement.
B00CYQPM42,26,9,The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3.
B00CYQPM42,26,10,Cheaper than an ipad mini with a better screen, this device is a no brainer.
B00CYQPM42,26,11,Except....when I took it to the beach and opened the cover, I didn't see a way to connect to the hotel's wi fi.
B00CYQPM42,26,12,It's just very odd and makes charging annoying.2)
B00CYQPM42,26,13,Only thing that is really lacking is a USB port otherwise it is a great little product.
B00CYQPM42,26,14,My phone did and our laptop did but mind showed me a keyboard and asked for a pin????
B00CYQPM42,26,15,You have to connect it at an angle on the device (around 30 degrees).
B00CYQPM42,26,16,When I realized too late that it had no HDMI out, I bought a Tronsmart miracast device.
B00CYQPM42,26,17,You will not regret it since this device is designed to be taken everywhere.
B00CYQPM42,26,18,6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit.
B00CYQPM42,26,19,The bottom line is that this is not a repairable device.
B00CYQPM42,26,20,have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle.
B00CYQPM42,26,21,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,26,22,It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device.
B00CYQPM42,26,23,I do not mind the small 7" format because, in return, I have a small unit that fits in my purse.
B00CYQPM42,26,24,My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats.
B00CYQPM42,27,0,She had me "update" the system.
B00CYQPM42,27,1,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,27,2,I bought this for my wife and have had it maybe month and everything stopped working can not even unlock screen when you reset it.
B00CYQPM42,27,3,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,27,4,This is my first time with a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,27,5,only two things i dislike: The Boot up time after you turn it off is slow, and the fact that i can't use Google Play.
B00CYQPM42,27,6,Having a lot of issues with this!!!
B00CYQPM42,27,7,The browser often hangs for no reason, even when my broadband is working fine.More rrestarting.
B00CYQPM42,27,8,This one just irked me one too many times with the return-replace-defective cycle.
B00CYQPM42,27,9,I would have given it 5 stars but some of the apps will flip upside down when I have the screen locked in one place.
B00CYQPM42,27,10,Lots of freezing and unexpected hangs.
B00CYQPM42,27,11,I got my wife a two year-old USED iPad, and it has worked flawlessly for a year in our possession, never freezing or requiring a hard reboot.
B00CYQPM42,27,12,And the update fixed all the problems I had encountered.
B00CYQPM42,27,13,This is the second one that the freezing happens so I'm not sure if it's something mechanical or what the reason is for it freezing.
B00CYQPM42,27,14,Crashed constantly.
B00CYQPM42,27,15,I have to take it out of the case  to start and to shut it down.
B00CYQPM42,27,16,So, I sent it back and got a replacement from Amazon.And then that replacement's display started flickering randomly.
B00CYQPM42,27,17,Just hanged up with the CS and they assure that is a software feature, and that can be fixed with a software update.
B00CYQPM42,27,18,Turns out a different launcher (Apex or Nova) and a few side loaded apps from 1Mobile were all that was required.
B00CYQPM42,27,19,While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me.
B00CYQPM42,27,20,And when I say froze, i mean it became completely non-responsive for over an hour until i finally gave up and performed a hard reboot.
B00CYQPM42,27,21,Which they sent quickly....and that one had more screen issues.I don't know if I just had bad luck, but that's the point when I gave up.
B00CYQPM42,27,22,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,27,23,She couldn't comprehend that I could not complete her troubleshooting checklist because the device was not working!
B00CYQPM42,27,24,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,28,0,I even called customer service and they said there's was a problem with it.
B00CYQPM42,28,1,I have contacted support about these problems.
B00CYQPM42,28,2,I am going to contact support again to see if they can help.
B00CYQPM42,28,3,I called customer service AGAIN and asked if I was eligible for a refund and they told me that because this was a replacement device I could not have a refund.
B00CYQPM42,28,4,I want to return it.
B00CYQPM42,28,5,I did have ro send for a repalcement because I had a problem with the firsrt one.
B00CYQPM42,28,6,Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept.
B00CYQPM42,28,7,The device is 5 months old...After contacting Amazon Kindle support a fourth time, someone finally helped me.
B00CYQPM42,28,8,It took a few days for a very supportive customer service chap from Ireland to sort out the problem.
B00CYQPM42,28,9,poor support.
B00CYQPM42,28,10,i contacted customer service and it took them a week to send a canned email with instructions on how to load an email.
B00CYQPM42,28,11,When I called customer service they were great (the reason that this go any stars) I received a replacement and I am having the same issues.
B00CYQPM42,28,12,I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support.
B00CYQPM42,28,13,I'm pretty aggravated any time I have to deal with Amazon Customer Service.
B00CYQPM42,28,14,Therefore, I am no longer receiving any more emails about this issue which means the problems are not fixed and now I don't know what to do about it.
B00CYQPM42,28,15,This is something i also asked about when in called customer service and was told it was the kindle and my internet.
B00CYQPM42,28,16,Very happy customer.
B00CYQPM42,28,17,So far I've had no problems with my Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,28,18,He sent a few emails telling me he was working on the problem and the last email I received stated his superiors said I should update my kindle with the new update because it would fix my problems..
B00CYQPM42,28,19,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,28,20,I explained this to the tech advisors and they told me to send it back.
B00CYQPM42,28,21,He did everything he could to help and then said he would have to contact the managers and he would keep me posted by email.
B00CYQPM42,28,22,So after contacting Amazon three times for this issue to get a replacement Kindle, I am still stuck with an unusable Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,28,23,I called customer care, they helped me quickly reset the device to factory settings and it seemed to have fixed it.
B00CYQPM42,28,24,Its a poorly developed product with poor customer service.
B00CYQPM42,29,0,There are 4 obvious shadows at the bottom of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,29,1,I miss being able to click on the top of the screen to get to settings.
B00CYQPM42,29,2,Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,29,3,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,29,4,It's hard to scroll through screens without opening something about which you have no interest.
B00CYQPM42,29,5,This is the second one that the freezing happens so I'm not sure if it's something mechanical or what the reason is for it freezing.
B00CYQPM42,29,6,But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,29,7,Have origami case, works well, no issues.
B00CYQPM42,29,8,I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently.
B00CYQPM42,29,9,Next time I'm buying an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,29,10,I have to hold the power button down for 15 seconds or more for it to shut off.
B00CYQPM42,29,11,I could move the little window wherever I wanted.
B00CYQPM42,29,12,When using it, the screen will all of a sudden disappear.
B00CYQPM42,29,13,Occasionally shuts off when I am in the middle of something.
B00CYQPM42,29,14,The browser often hangs for no reason, even when my broadband is working fine.More rrestarting.
B00CYQPM42,29,15,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,29,16,I would have given it 5 stars but some of the apps will flip upside down when I have the screen locked in one place.
B00CYQPM42,29,17,The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!
B00CYQPM42,29,18,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,29,19,IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side.
B00CYQPM42,29,20,It's no small deal that the top of the line hardware can be had for bargain hunter prices.----------TURN
B00CYQPM42,29,21,And there's a very tiny window underneath the carousel that suggests content similar to what you're reading/doing/watching already.
B00CYQPM42,29,22,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,29,23,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,29,24,Amazon has also added multi-tasking of a sort, where swiping up from the bottom of the screen while you're in an app shows you the 20 most-recently-used items from your home screen, so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen.There is also a left panel available on most screens (but not the home screen) and in some of the apps, with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app.
B007P4YAPK,0,0,Love the crisp display and the vibrant colors.
B007P4YAPK,0,1,I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire.
B007P4YAPK,0,2,The screen resolution is very crisp indoors.
B007P4YAPK,0,3,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,0,4,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,0,5,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,0,6,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,0,7,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,0,8,The blue color is a really nice dark blue, you won't be disappointed, many features and very good speed.
B007P4YAPK,0,9,The resolution is beautiful and the brightness is remarkable.
B007P4YAPK,0,10,As far as the display is concerned it is crisp, clear and the colors are beautiful.
B007P4YAPK,0,11,If you don't already have a mobile device with amazingly high resolution and vivid colors, then you probably won't have any problems with the Pad's screen at all.
B007P4YAPK,0,12,HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.
B007P4YAPK,0,13,Great battery life also
B007P4YAPK,0,14,I purchased it brandnew since the product first available on Amazone 8 months ago, it looks good ( not as good as Ipad) the touch screen sensitive is good and smooth , the quality so far so good... my kids use it to play games and watch youtube videos alot .
B007P4YAPK,0,15,Needless to say the GPS was better as well.You can definitely notice a difference in the screen resolution, the TF300 is not as sharp on the colors.
B007P4YAPK,0,16,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,0,17,Although I won't complain too much about it because the speaker is better than that of the prime and is very clear even at the highest level.Display Quality- video quality seems fine,  I watched a lot of YouTube trailers in HD and even watched Sherlock Holmes games of shadows in 720p and Avatar in 1080p and so far video quality seems fine to me and the tablet did not even hiccup.
B007P4YAPK,0,18,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,0,19,Very easy to use, lightweight, and perfectly customizable.
B007P4YAPK,0,20,Good price.
B007P4YAPK,0,21,I've compared my tablet directly to a coworker's iPad 3, and actually prefer the black contrast better on the TF300.
B007P4YAPK,0,22,It took me a while to adjust to the lower resolution and more subdued colors.
B007P4YAPK,0,23,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,0,24,Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as "floaters" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,0,Another problem is app to app integration.
B007P4YAPK,1,1,But it works great with netflix, crunchyroll, xfinity, brighthousetv etc. so its nice for watching stuff while working out.
B007P4YAPK,1,2,The apps loads fast.
B007P4YAPK,1,3,Netflix and the music players work well, but what I really use it is for the following:1.
B007P4YAPK,1,4,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,1,5,I went straight for swiftkey3 and works great with the TF300T.Native browser works great.Very little bloatware, thank you ASUS.If your looking for your first tablet you should know: Apps in the android line are NOT up to par with Apple apps, simple truth.
B007P4YAPK,1,6,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B007P4YAPK,1,7,Google apps works well, and it is easy with the keyboard to deal with email.8.
B007P4YAPK,1,8,Good .
B007P4YAPK,1,9,I purchased it brandnew since the product first available on Amazone 8 months ago, it looks good ( not as good as Ipad) the touch screen sensitive is good and smooth , the quality so far so good... my kids use it to play games and watch youtube videos alot .
B007P4YAPK,1,10,If you have an android phone, this is the way to go - all my phone apps were added automatically to tablet.4.
B007P4YAPK,1,11,While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps.
B007P4YAPK,1,12,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,1,13,The only thing that I was disappointed about was the inability to stream videos except youtube.
B007P4YAPK,1,14,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,15,So far mostly he has just used free games.
B007P4YAPK,1,16,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,17,HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.
B007P4YAPK,1,18,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,1,19,I also do not want to install iTunes on any of my PCs.I decided to purchase a tablet because I do not like having to boot up or keep a PC running just to check my email, surf the web, watch a video, or read an ebook.
B007P4YAPK,1,20,It does a great job at everything it does - the only time I ever see lag is multitasking between applications which heavily use the internet - such as a p2p application and netflix at the same time... doesn't work well.
B007P4YAPK,1,21,When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.
B007P4YAPK,1,22,it won`t download Adobe media player and some things need that to play on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,23,My son likes to play games, that is his main use of the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,24,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,2,0,Good Product.
B007P4YAPK,2,1,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,2,2,Good price.
B007P4YAPK,2,3,Good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,4,This is a good tablet for the price I paid for it.
B007P4YAPK,2,5,Worth buying.
B007P4YAPK,2,6,Overall, I love this product.
B007P4YAPK,2,7,Very nice for the price.
B007P4YAPK,2,8,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,9,The price was good at the time but now it is even better of course.
B007P4YAPK,2,10,I would recommend this to anyone who wants a pretty high spec tablet but without the high end price.
B007P4YAPK,2,11,I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B007P4YAPK,2,12,My friend recommended it and I went along with the recommendation.
B007P4YAPK,2,13,Overall, for the price of this tablet, I don't think you can get any better!
B007P4YAPK,2,14,Very good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,15,Good price, great seller, good shipping, the cover that it came with smelled of smoke, but it was used after all, and in good condition over all.
B007P4YAPK,2,16,You can't beat the performance of this tablet for the price.
B007P4YAPK,2,17,Awesome Tablet for the price!
B007P4YAPK,2,18,Very  good camera.Cons:1.
B007P4YAPK,2,19,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,2,20,I would highly recommend if your going to game, get an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,2,21,good product.
B007P4YAPK,2,22,Buy it now.UpdateI originally bought this for my wife, after spending some time using the tablet, I've decided to purchase another one for myself.
B007P4YAPK,2,23,Love the ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,2,24,Good tablet for the time.
B007P4YAPK,3,0,Great battery life also
B007P4YAPK,3,1,The battery lasts about 7 hours.
B007P4YAPK,3,2,Great battery life too.
B007P4YAPK,3,3,Very good battery life; especially using the dock.5.
B007P4YAPK,3,4,Battery life is around 7 hours for almost constant use.
B007P4YAPK,3,5,See how long the battery lasts.
B007P4YAPK,3,6,Had it for 3 days and could not charge it.
B007P4YAPK,3,7,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B007P4YAPK,3,8,The battery life is about average for a tablet.
B007P4YAPK,3,9,nice for it's time.
B007P4YAPK,3,10,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,3,11,It does seem to charge fast though and hold a charge very well while the display is off.
B007P4YAPK,3,12,Good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,3,13,I usually get 2 days out of it before I charge it.
B007P4YAPK,3,14,Color reproduction is excellent though.Battery life has generally been very good for me though it will not hold up great under gaming.
B007P4YAPK,3,15,The unit seemed very nice with a lot of good features until 3 days went by and it would not take a charge.
B007P4YAPK,3,16,Battery life is above average, usually lasting a day and a half with moderate use.
B007P4YAPK,3,17,The battery life is very impressive also.My only gripe with this is the screen.
B007P4YAPK,3,18,It is a good qualify tablet.
B007P4YAPK,3,19,Good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,3,20,Screen seems pretty robust.
B007P4YAPK,3,21,toshiba tablets have swappable batteries thereby doubling there usage time with one xtra battery.
B007P4YAPK,3,22,Even just the additional battery life is a thing of beauty alone, as I now always run the device in performance mode (which helps to cut down on lagginess), and still get good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,3,23,I doubt I ever get advertised battery life but it last a lot longer than a laptop so I am pleased.
B007P4YAPK,3,24,If you see the battery symbol is low charge for 8 hours.
B007P4YAPK,4,0,Good enough but could be better!
B007P4YAPK,4,1,The design and build are both very good.
B007P4YAPK,4,2,Apart from needing more sound from the speakers, its a very good product.
B007P4YAPK,4,3,It feels good, is easy to hold, and the screen is very nice, if not as bright as the Prime.
B007P4YAPK,4,4,Good Product.
B007P4YAPK,4,5,The design is nice and it feels pretty sturdy.
B007P4YAPK,4,6,Very thin, and has a good grip feeling thanks to the textured back.
B007P4YAPK,4,7,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,4,8,The display was crisp and the sound was surprisingly loud with only 1 speaker.
B007P4YAPK,4,9,The design is also great.
B007P4YAPK,4,10,It feels light and thin for its size.
B007P4YAPK,4,11,It is a good qualify tablet.
B007P4YAPK,4,12,Good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,4,13,Nice 10" Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,4,14,A surprisingly good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,4,15,Overall, for the price of this tablet, I don't think you can get any better!
B007P4YAPK,4,16,But all and all I like it its a good price.
B007P4YAPK,4,17,Sound isn't the best (only one speaker), but it does get surprisingly loud for a little thing.Overall, so far I like the TF300 a LOT.
B007P4YAPK,4,18,it is great better than i expected i like that i can play the keyboard on it and that i can add more memory.Great product.
B007P4YAPK,4,19,Asus makes great products for their price point, and this one qualifies, with the exception of the join of the back and front.
B007P4YAPK,4,20,Nice.
B007P4YAPK,4,21,Even though it appears they refined some aspects of the device ( better, louder speakers, clearer sound, button placement and layout, and more storage), they have skimped on the screen slightly.
B007P4YAPK,4,22,So far, so good.
B007P4YAPK,4,23,If anyone can actually tell the difference in speed, they are pretty good, because it is only 0.1MHz difference.
B007P4YAPK,4,24,To be honest the speaker sounds amazing but, having sound come from only one side kind of puts it out of balance for me.
B007P4YAPK,5,0,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B007P4YAPK,5,1,Best tablet with one exception - SKYPE.
B007P4YAPK,5,2,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,5,3,I can't say how much I love this tablet it's fast quality device with one exception in that Skype video is the very bad!This is a software problem and so I am hopefull that it will be fixed.
B007P4YAPK,5,4,But it works great with netflix, crunchyroll, xfinity, brighthousetv etc. so its nice for watching stuff while working out.
B007P4YAPK,5,5,The front facing camera is clearly designed to be used in landscape mode.
B007P4YAPK,5,6,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,5,7,But all and all I like it its a good price.
B007P4YAPK,5,8,While the screen is not super IPS and thus is a little bit hard to use in direct sunlight, the screen is more than bright enough for easy use in every other situation.
B007P4YAPK,5,9,Pretty darn decent for the price.
B007P4YAPK,5,10,HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.
B007P4YAPK,5,11,it takes excellent pictures: beach wise, whc is very sunny or even in dark places like a church and sunset pix are pretty good,even the rainbow and the clouds  look amazing; i have no problems w/ all my Kindle books....i just love it
B007P4YAPK,5,12,All in all it is a decent tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,13,Decent.
B007P4YAPK,5,14,I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.
B007P4YAPK,5,15,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,16,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,5,17,Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as "floaters" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,18,Not the best, but fast enough to be relevant in 2014 and with a decent display and great expandability.
B007P4YAPK,5,19,The camera is decent quality, the image is grainy and when zoomed in the image is very jagged/razor-like.
B007P4YAPK,5,20,But this ones great.
B007P4YAPK,5,21,Its Nice but with some drawbacks.
B007P4YAPK,5,22,Never experienced any lag that other users "seem" to experience.The screen size is huge, 10.1 inches compared to the 9.6 of an ipad, people notice it.The cpu as I have already addressed, very fast, I have also owned a tf700, and the tf300 is not a dinosaur in any means of comparison.The cameras focus faster than my camcorder,(and seem to take better photos, though, for the videos, I resort to my camcorder).As for all you "customizers", I found it very easy too root.
B007P4YAPK,5,23,What a great tablet for the $$$ Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,24,Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.
B007P4YAPK,6,0,What a great tablet for the $$$ Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,1,It's fast, smooth and very responsive, to my touch.
B007P4YAPK,6,2,Very nice for the price.
B007P4YAPK,6,3,5ghz dual band would be nice.
B007P4YAPK,6,4,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,6,5,It out performs most everything out there, has great graphics, and is well made.
B007P4YAPK,6,6,Not the best, but fast enough to be relevant in 2014 and with a decent display and great expandability.
B007P4YAPK,6,7,It has a quad core and 32Gig of storage.
B007P4YAPK,6,8,Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,9,Snappy responses and Tegra 3 video a plus.
B007P4YAPK,6,10,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,6,11,The best processor, decent memory, expandability, and at a price point that doesn't make my checkbook cry.Update for the new (4.3)
B007P4YAPK,6,12,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,6,13,The browser speed seemed a little slow and the touch screen response is sometimes delayed but I love it so far.
B007P4YAPK,6,14,Good tablet for the time.
B007P4YAPK,6,15,It has all of the speed that I need.
B007P4YAPK,6,16,watsapp is not compatable with this tab :(... Overall its a good tab whithdecent performance and bright ui
B007P4YAPK,6,17,Especially if you are going to use their feature to have multiple accounts.The display is good but does not do gradients well.
B007P4YAPK,6,18,The screen is beautiful.
B007P4YAPK,6,19,The screen is beautiful and I love the expandable memory capability.
B007P4YAPK,6,20,Also you can now upgrade Android to Jelly Bean.
B007P4YAPK,6,21,Great Android ICS Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,22,I have multiple apps active at the same time with no speed penalty.
B007P4YAPK,6,23,Devices began coming out shortly after this tablet that had 1.5GB and 2GB of RAM, and the extra memory makes a huge difference in Android, probably more so than a faster processor would.All in all, it was a good tablet at the time it came out, and is still a decent tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,24,HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.
B007P4YAPK,7,0,I added a 32 Gig micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,7,1,The included SD slot makes it very expandable and is something that Nexus devices will never have.
B007P4YAPK,7,2,RAM is expandable via a microSD card which is also a big plus.
B007P4YAPK,7,3,Still has full size  SDHC card slot on keyboard (yeah) and a Micro SDHC slot on the tablet  (big time yeah).
B007P4YAPK,7,4,The memory is 32gb, which is more then enough for most people.
B007P4YAPK,7,5,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,7,6,Not the best, but fast enough to be relevant in 2014 and with a decent display and great expandability.
B007P4YAPK,7,7,The expandable memory on the ASUS is also very convenient.
B007P4YAPK,7,8,The touch screen works great for the access.I had looked at tablets last year and tried a 7 inch one.
B007P4YAPK,7,9,good product, but this model does not have sim card slot... builtin appliction for microsoft word editing is not impressive.
B007P4YAPK,7,10,The screen is beautiful and I love the expandable memory capability.
B007P4YAPK,7,11,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,7,12,Some minor downsides include no flash on the back camera (taking pictures can become difficult because of this), a battery life that only lasted between 6-8 hrs, a badly placed speaker that gets muffled if the table is on its back, and no expandable memory.
B007P4YAPK,7,13,The best processor, decent memory, expandability, and at a price point that doesn't make my checkbook cry.Update for the new (4.3)
B007P4YAPK,7,14,it is great better than i expected i like that i can play the keyboard on it and that i can add more memory.Great product.
B007P4YAPK,7,15,It does seem to charge fast though and hold a charge very well while the display is off.
B007P4YAPK,7,16,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,7,17,I love it, but there is room for improvement.
B007P4YAPK,7,18,Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,7,19,Pros- Affordable Android tablet- Good overall performanceCons- Unique/proprietary charging requirements- Possible issues with screen popping outJust wanted to share my findings briefly.
B007P4YAPK,7,20,First off, this is a fast tablet.
B007P4YAPK,7,21,good product.
B007P4YAPK,7,22,The unit seemed very nice with a lot of good features until 3 days went by and it would not take a charge.
B007P4YAPK,7,23,Good but...
B007P4YAPK,7,24,As non-Nexus tablets go, Asus tends to have great specs.
B007P4YAPK,8,0,It is easy to learn, but there are problems.
B007P4YAPK,8,1,Very good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,8,2,I have to learn how to download some of the things that make it work.It charges fast and I love the portability of it.
B007P4YAPK,8,3,I can do just about all things I usually do on my computer but most important of all I can travel anywhere and have access to most of the apps that I used.
B007P4YAPK,8,4,The wifi works very well, a little better than my laptop (my laptop is a few years old) in fact.
B007P4YAPK,8,5,When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.
B007P4YAPK,8,6,Really love it for this, so I can take it anywhere, and connect to the internet.
B007P4YAPK,8,7,I like the size and use it instead of my laptop.
B007P4YAPK,8,8,I have to do work on a linux server - very easy to ssh to servers at work, and run serious programs there.
B007P4YAPK,8,9,Adding notes is easy.
B007P4YAPK,8,10,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,8,11,I have several desktop, laptop and netbook computers but this is my first tablet.
B007P4YAPK,8,12,Web browsing is quite fast (I use Dolphin browser), and once I updated Adobe Flash, flash within web pages works great.
B007P4YAPK,8,13,Great for reading without the keyboard, and perfect for email and editing with the keyboard.Highly recommended.
B007P4YAPK,8,14,It just isn't working for my intended use - to read articles, browse and shop.
B007P4YAPK,8,15,Very  good camera.Cons:1.
B007P4YAPK,8,16,With the exception of one application, this is a fantastic device to bring while traveling, and for most things more useful than a laptop.
B007P4YAPK,8,17,The wifi is very strong, and the thing is really a joy to use in general.
B007P4YAPK,8,18,Wi-Fi has been great and it tethers absolutely great from my phone when I am not in Wi-Fi reach.
B007P4YAPK,8,19,Netflix and the music players work well, but what I really use it is for the following:1.
B007P4YAPK,8,20,But it works great with netflix, crunchyroll, xfinity, brighthousetv etc. so its nice for watching stuff while working out.
B007P4YAPK,8,21,If you have an android phone, this is the way to go - all my phone apps were added automatically to tablet.4.
B007P4YAPK,8,22,The browser speed seemed a little slow and the touch screen response is sometimes delayed but I love it so far.
B007P4YAPK,8,23,Wifi reception is so good, it found more servers around my house than any other device I own and has had full strength connected to mine since I fired it up, regardless of where I use it in the house.I was able to easily conect to my main computer via DLNA and stream the music and videos I have stored there.
B007P4YAPK,8,24,A super useful device.
B007P4YAPK,9,0,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,9,1,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,9,2,Also, when you have the screen at the best angle it can get (pretty much all the way back), when you touch the screen it has a tendency to tilt back because of the very fine balance the keyboard and the screen have.
B007P4YAPK,9,3,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,9,4,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,5,It does better with touch.
B007P4YAPK,9,6,It always feels like I am trying to contort my hand to touch it, reaching over the keyboard, especially when it comes to touching the lower part of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,7,It feels very natural to reach from the keyboard to touching the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,8,Touching the screen tips the balance.
B007P4YAPK,9,9,Also, the on screen ASUS keyboard is very glitchy.
B007P4YAPK,9,10,Coupled with the keyboard dock it makes a pretty good laptop replacement.
B007P4YAPK,9,11,Love the small size...easy to carry around instead of my big  laptop.
B007P4YAPK,9,12,You can maintain email access but be able to type much better than you would just off the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,13,Fortunately, I have the docking keyboard and the mouse worked so I retained some function.But a tablet isn't worth much without touchscreen capability -- docking keyboard or no.
B007P4YAPK,9,14,Great little touch pad.
B007P4YAPK,9,15,Bought the Keyboard that only works on this asus product, bought a nice case, and bought a screen protector.
B007P4YAPK,9,16,The angle and position is perfect for promoting the use of your finger to touch the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,17,I am planning to get the optional keyboard dock, because the unit can function as a small laptop.
B007P4YAPK,9,18,The screen format is wide screen so a better match to modern TVs and monitors than the Apple 4x5 format.
B007P4YAPK,9,19,Good tablet for the time.
B007P4YAPK,9,20,The button to turn off the mouse pad is your best friend, because the mouse is very easy to touch with your thumb while you type and in turn moves focus on your screen to something else.
B007P4YAPK,9,21,Personally, the mouse to me is not a desirable feature for a device based on touching.Screen:  SL101 wins.
B007P4YAPK,9,22,Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.
B007P4YAPK,9,23,Now, the SL101's keyboard is OK.
B007P4YAPK,9,24,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,10,0,Otherwise I love it
B007P4YAPK,10,1,I love my tablet, once I got one that worked.
B007P4YAPK,10,2,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,3,Overall, I love this product.
B007P4YAPK,10,4,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,10,5,Great.
B007P4YAPK,10,6,The size is perfect and it is easy to use and fast.
B007P4YAPK,10,7,I absolutely love this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,8,Nice tablet, though
B007P4YAPK,10,9,I absolutely love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,10,10,Love the small size...easy to carry around instead of my big  laptop.
B007P4YAPK,10,11,What a great tablet for the $$$ Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,12,Nice tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,13,tablet is good.
B007P4YAPK,10,14,Just got it last week - love it!
B007P4YAPK,10,15,Very easy to use, lightweight, and perfectly customizable.
B007P4YAPK,10,16,And I love it even more.
B007P4YAPK,10,17,Good Product.
B007P4YAPK,10,18,Handy and Fast Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,19,I bought a ASUS t101 and loved it for the three weeks I had it.
B007P4YAPK,10,20,Love it!
B007P4YAPK,10,21,I have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it.
B007P4YAPK,10,22,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,10,23,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,10,24,I enjoy the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,11,0,It also gives me usb ports.
B007P4YAPK,11,1,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,11,2,Not necessary if you get the keyboard, however, as the keyboard has a full sized usb port built in.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Just found out that standard USB chargers (of any amperage) do not charge this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,11,3,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,11,4,I don't like the propriety plug, and the no USB port.
B007P4YAPK,11,5,I would have liked to be able to use the keyboard from a distance, without it being connected to the tablet, which would have been nice considering the HDMI port.
B007P4YAPK,11,6,I have the USB adapter but its not great.
B007P4YAPK,11,7,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,11,8,I never tried to see if the old keyboard would work on the new one...the new one is a bit different...has one USB port instead of two (negative).
B007P4YAPK,11,9,Came with keyboard that includes extra battery.
B007P4YAPK,11,10,I use it mostly with the keyboard and portfolio stand case to give me keyboard capability, to extend the battery life.
B007P4YAPK,11,11,I originally got it without the keyboard, but then got the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,11,12,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,11,13,I purchased the keyboard dock and a bluetooth mouse to accompany the TF300.
B007P4YAPK,11,14,I still prefer to be able to have additional power instead, but it would have been a nice feature to have bluetooth on the keyboard too.
B007P4YAPK,11,15,Great battery life too.
B007P4YAPK,11,16,The USB connection to my PC allows me to read this tablet like a hard drive.
B007P4YAPK,11,17,I love the keyboard dock.
B007P4YAPK,11,18,ASUS TF300T Tablet wit Keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,11,19,Also, the keyboards don't appear to be getting stocked anymore, so, if you're going to get one, get one soon.Also, if you get this tablet, this is a handy addition: ASUS USB Kit for Eee Pad Transformer TF101, TF101G, TF201 & TF300 Tablets  This is a dongle that plugs into the charging port and allows you to use USB devices (Hard Drive, thumb drive, keyboard, mouse, gaming pad) with the pad.
B007P4YAPK,11,20,My friend prefers a standard mouse and can use his USB mouse no problem.
B007P4YAPK,11,21,Having said that, I added a Poetic Hardback case which added a lot of stiffness/rigidity to the tablet.I'm very happy with the TF300, screen quality is good, has hdmi out, expandable storage via micro sd card slot, and you can add a USB adapter (which I bought) for external storage.
B007P4YAPK,11,22,Nice tablet.
B007P4YAPK,11,23,Battery life is still around 10 hours tablet and 15 hours with keyboard attached (battery in each) running 740p HD movies with wifi and blue tooth off.
B007P4YAPK,11,24,Be aware that when you are charging the keyboard, the tablet won't always charge to 100%.
B007P4YAPK,12,0,Interfaces just like my android phone.
B007P4YAPK,12,1,My phone is an android so I understood the basics of how to operate.
B007P4YAPK,12,2,Very good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,12,3,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,12,4,Screen seems pretty robust.
B007P4YAPK,12,5,Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.
B007P4YAPK,12,6,Great little touch pad.
B007P4YAPK,12,7,And I love it even more.
B007P4YAPK,12,8,I love the weight, the dimensions, the hardware specs!Asus also just pushed Android 4.1.1
B007P4YAPK,12,9,The physical design is pretty nice.
B007P4YAPK,12,10,First off: I love it.
B007P4YAPK,12,11,Love it!
B007P4YAPK,12,12,It mostly worked, but not always, and not as fast as I'd have preferred, and it took a lot of tweaking.
B007P4YAPK,12,13,The whole operation is much faster.
B007P4YAPK,12,14,The TF300 has great hardware.
B007P4YAPK,12,15,Having read many reviews of this and other tablets and having used the TF201 and Ipads, I thought this would be a safe middle ground, not too expensive but with very good hardware and software.I have the tablet for a 2 weeks now and have found nothing wrong with the operation of the tablet, very smooth with none of the issues others seem to have had.
B007P4YAPK,12,16,Good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,12,17,Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) is excellent.
B007P4YAPK,12,18,However, with as flimsy as the TF300 feels, I don't feel like its a smart move to use this tablet without a good hardback case.Done with the bad.
B007P4YAPK,12,19,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,12,20,The size is perfect and it is easy to use and fast.
B007P4YAPK,12,21,Might not have noticed but I also have access to Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 devices.
B007P4YAPK,12,22,What a great tablet for the $$$ Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,12,23,The TF300 actually makes a pretty good little word processor.
B007P4YAPK,12,24,Just got it last week - love it!
B007P4YAPK,13,0,The tablet is great and the service was great.
B007P4YAPK,13,1,Great product; even better customer service.
B007P4YAPK,13,2,Great.
B007P4YAPK,13,3,I am satisfied with this product, it is just what I needed.
B007P4YAPK,13,4,I want to thank Amazon for having reviews.
B007P4YAPK,13,5,I love my tablet, once I got one that worked.
B007P4YAPK,13,6,I purchased this on the reviews on Amazon and from Cnet, and other sites that I have visited.
B007P4YAPK,13,7,I'll give the tablet another chance and it's been shipped back to Amazon for a replacement.UPDATE: First of all the Amazon replacement program is AMAZING.
B007P4YAPK,13,8,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B007P4YAPK,13,9,Raised the review stars, because of my satified experience with the product.
B007P4YAPK,13,10,The first one delivered didn't work right but the company sent me a new one and I am really enjoying it.
B007P4YAPK,13,11,It took about 3 weeks until the tablet returned and about one week later the problem returned.I sent it to ASUS repair again, and it was returned about 3 weeks later.
B007P4YAPK,13,12,Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs.
B007P4YAPK,13,13,Gave them 1 star hoping others looking for help would find this review.
B007P4YAPK,13,14,Great Right?
B007P4YAPK,13,15,Everything was great, but....
B007P4YAPK,13,16,Good .
B007P4YAPK,13,17,Just the experience of dealing with something that doesn't work the first time is very disappointing.
B007P4YAPK,13,18,Good price, great seller, good shipping, the cover that it came with smelled of smoke, but it was used after all, and in good condition over all.
B007P4YAPK,13,19,I read all the reviews of other customers, and seen that some are having the same concens, if not more.
B007P4YAPK,13,20,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,13,21,Will give another update when I get the new one.Hope the new one is better, if not I will not be buying Asus anymore, even if the ratings are great.
B007P4YAPK,13,22,Unlike Amazon return process, I ended up paying for the return postage :-( Waiting for the return reach them and hopefully I will get the replacement quickly and it works well...
B007P4YAPK,13,23,Fast delivery.
B007P4YAPK,13,24,Amazon's customer support, in my opinion, is absolutely amazing.
B007P4YAPK,14,0,It poops on the ipad.
B007P4YAPK,14,1,good product.
B007P4YAPK,14,2,This is a great tablet!
B007P4YAPK,14,3,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,14,4,Best tablet.
B007P4YAPK,14,5,This is the best tablet hands down.
B007P4YAPK,14,6,I prefer the flexibility of Android and I already have an Android phone so I decided to give this one a try.
B007P4YAPK,14,7,Google apps works well, and it is easy with the keyboard to deal with email.8.
B007P4YAPK,14,8,We bought the keyboard to get the extra battery life, and it is good for that, but the keyboard itself does not work well unless it is on a perfectly flat, stable surface.
B007P4YAPK,14,9,We found a really nice app that would do a fairly good job replacing Quicken, but we didn't want to have to start all over from scratch.
B007P4YAPK,14,10,Unfortunately, the two main business software applications I planned to use require a Windows OS.
B007P4YAPK,14,11,Not the best, but fast enough to be relevant in 2014 and with a decent display and great expandability.
B007P4YAPK,14,12,While it is not a perfect laptop replacement (scrolling using the mouse or mousepad in particular takes a bit of getting used to and is subpar compared to a laptop), using the keyboard and mouse with the pre-installed office suite is simple, easy, and impressively powerful too.
B007P4YAPK,14,13,The Android OS isn't polished either.
B007P4YAPK,14,14,For what the tablet is designed for, it excels.The tablet even functions very well as a laptop replacement.
B007P4YAPK,14,15,Good but...
B007P4YAPK,14,16,There was a time when all ASUS computers were made in Taiwan...
B007P4YAPK,14,17,The wifi works very well, a little better than my laptop (my laptop is a few years old) in fact.
B007P4YAPK,14,18,Certain apps don't work on the tab and alot of apps seem like they are still in the beta phase.
B007P4YAPK,14,19,The upgrade took it to 4.1.1...UPDATE:  Now updated to 4.2.2 in the US).The tablet is pretty nice and comes with some nice additions, most notably, a well integrated version of Splashtop Remote 2.0 which controls my PC perfectly!.
B007P4YAPK,14,20,The apk is supposedly meant only for ics, used it in Jelly bean, worked perfectly fine.
B007P4YAPK,14,21,can not use this for office purposes.
B007P4YAPK,14,22,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,14,23,I still have complaints with some apps not optimized though, but this I think is the same with all android devices.
B007P4YAPK,14,24,If you have an android phone, this is the way to go - all my phone apps were added automatically to tablet.4.
B007P4YAPK,15,0,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,15,1,When my screen is black, I notice some light bleed in a few of the corners, but it's nothing major and becomes unnoticeable when the screen is displaying colors other than black.
B007P4YAPK,15,2,There was also some light bleed on the edges of the screen, noticeable only when viewing dark images/video.
B007P4YAPK,15,3,I have poor eyesight, but I can clearly read the screen even with full sun shining on it.
B007P4YAPK,15,4,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,15,5,Tablet two appeared to have a foreign object stuck under the glass of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,6,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,15,7,What a great tablet for the $$$ Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,15,8,Where ever I was, when set on auto, the tablet screen always adjusted to the most dim.
B007P4YAPK,15,9,Good visibility and good view angles.
B007P4YAPK,15,10,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,15,11,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B007P4YAPK,15,12,Tablet one had a stuck-on pixel close to the center of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,13,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,15,14,Not noticeable when it's on, but unmistakable when the screen is dark.Otherwise, it's beautiful, light, functional and zippy.
B007P4YAPK,15,15,It is a little slow on refresh, but the resolution is good.
B007P4YAPK,15,16,For normal use this is fine because the screen flips automatically but some programs, mainly games, insist on displaying in only in native orientation.The screen is more than bright enough for indoor use but not enough for daylight outdoors.
B007P4YAPK,15,17,The screen does have some minor light bleed that is noticeable when the background is black but nothing that I consider overly objectionable.
B007P4YAPK,15,18,The only things I have a small gripe about are, there is a little light leakage at the corners of the screen when the background is black, and the WiFi could be better.
B007P4YAPK,15,19,Some reviewers have commented on the slight lack of color depth in the screen, but I was able to adjust it to my complete satisfaction.
B007P4YAPK,15,20,Not good when one of the touted features is the display.
B007P4YAPK,15,21,Tablet three had a dead pixel near the center of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,22,I would set it aside and when I come back to it, I'd notice the tablet had shut down.
B007P4YAPK,15,23,For a 10" tablet, this is adequate, but pixels are noticeable when you're doing up-close reading or surfing.
B007P4YAPK,15,24,It took me a while to adjust to the lower resolution and more subdued colors.
B007P4YAPK,16,0,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,16,1,it won`t download Adobe media player and some things need that to play on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,16,2,And I've had no problem finding apps on Google Play to fill all of my needs.
B007P4YAPK,16,3,Great product only one issue, Adobe Flash says it is not supporting this version of android OS which makes viewing certain web pages not possible.
B007P4YAPK,16,4,My only disappointment is that there isn't a version of Adobe Flash player for this OS yet!
B007P4YAPK,16,5,I still have complaints with some apps not optimized though, but this I think is the same with all android devices.
B007P4YAPK,16,6,So far mostly he has just used free games.
B007P4YAPK,16,7,However, the same problem happens with the default browser and Google Chrome.
B007P4YAPK,16,8,Still waiting for the games to start showing up for it in the play storeAnother plus is the support and following this tablet is seeing at Xda forums already.
B007P4YAPK,16,9,Certain apps don't work on the tab and alot of apps seem like they are still in the beta phase.
B007P4YAPK,16,10,But as it is, I still have the opportunity to create a new gmail account to use exclusively with google play.
B007P4YAPK,16,11,My son likes to play games, that is his main use of the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,16,12,However, he did try to buy a couple of games on the android market.
B007P4YAPK,16,13,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,16,14,Adobe reader was laggy, and google chrome as well (without flash support???).
B007P4YAPK,16,15,Asus has just added some widgets and apps.
B007P4YAPK,16,16,Each time while downloading, I read the reviews of the game and found that they consistently crashed on this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,16,17,Setting flash to not load by default seems to help.
B007P4YAPK,16,18,Seems it may work a little too well.
B007P4YAPK,16,19,The Android OS isn't polished either.
B007P4YAPK,16,20,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,16,21,Web browsing is quite fast (I use Dolphin browser), and once I updated Adobe Flash, flash within web pages works great.
B007P4YAPK,16,22,Super cool, my only complaint is android not supporting flash, which of course has nothing to do with ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,16,23,For the browser, I switched to Chrome and have had no issues, just have to go to the stock browser for flash related content.
B007P4YAPK,16,24,With the exception of the browsers, I've never had problems with any of the apps that were actually optimized or specifically designed for tablets.
B007P4YAPK,17,0,It was very, VERY much worth the money.
B007P4YAPK,17,1,Please DO NOT waste your $.
B007P4YAPK,17,2,I wasted so much $ on this.
B007P4YAPK,17,3,I'm 62 years old and have dealt with quite a few.I will NEVER, EVER, buy any ASUS product again and will never recommend that company.
B007P4YAPK,17,4,If you want a 7" tablet that is the tablet to buy.
B007P4YAPK,17,5,Bought this tablet in February.
B007P4YAPK,17,6,Just the experience of dealing with something that doesn't work the first time is very disappointing.
B007P4YAPK,17,7,So, like the title of my review says, this will be my last Asus purchase.
B007P4YAPK,17,8,Raised the review stars, because of my satified experience with the product.
B007P4YAPK,17,9,Bought the Keyboard that only works on this asus product, bought a nice case, and bought a screen protector.
B007P4YAPK,17,10,I purchased the Asus tablet as a reasonable-priced iPad.
B007P4YAPK,17,11,I spent a lot of time researching before buying this tablet, and it was very nearly exactly what I needed.
B007P4YAPK,17,12,I want to thank Amazon for having reviews.
B007P4YAPK,17,13,Gave it a last run for the money but will exchange for a new one.
B007P4YAPK,17,14,ASUS review.
B007P4YAPK,17,15,I am very disappointed and feel like I deserved a lot better for having spent $400 on it.
B007P4YAPK,17,16,I liked the tablet since day one, but just got a bad one.
B007P4YAPK,17,17,That, however, is not a knock on this tablet, and for the money, I think this Asus is the 10" Android tablet to buy.
B007P4YAPK,17,18,Many people like your product and the price range.
B007P4YAPK,17,19,Before this I would have given it 3 to 4 stars overall but I cannot advise spending that kind of money on a tablet that I got less than two years use from.
B007P4YAPK,17,20,I bought a protection plan on it, so I hope to get my money back if it does not turn on.
B007P4YAPK,17,21,Especially since there are better options out right now for the same price.
B007P4YAPK,17,22,My first tablet, my last ASUS product.
B007P4YAPK,17,23,Overall a purchase that should last me a few years.
B007P4YAPK,17,24,It took about 3 weeks until the tablet returned and about one week later the problem returned.I sent it to ASUS repair again, and it was returned about 3 weeks later.
B007P4YAPK,18,0,My tablet would not charge from either charger, but both chargers work with her tablet.
B007P4YAPK,18,1,Had it for 3 days and could not charge it.
B007P4YAPK,18,2,I plugged it in and did not get the battery symbol.
B007P4YAPK,18,3,If you see the battery symbol is low charge for 8 hours.
B007P4YAPK,18,4,"52seconds on 100% battery charge.." really?
B007P4YAPK,18,5,However, within about a month, it started turning itself completely off, and It started to get cumbersome turning it back on.
B007P4YAPK,18,6,My battery can be charging or fully charged and the unit would give me the most random battery status.
B007P4YAPK,18,7,Only problems I have had with it is that it would not always turn on.
B007P4YAPK,18,8,A few other times the screen wouldn't turn back on even though I'm pushing the power button multiple times.
B007P4YAPK,18,9,Power button problem.
B007P4YAPK,18,10,Battery life is around 7 hours for almost constant use.
B007P4YAPK,18,11,( I am hoping that I left it on and the battery went dead) If it does not turn on after 8 hours call them again.
B007P4YAPK,18,12,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,18,13,Even though we thought it was just a problem with the power cord, we could not get a replacement cord to make sure.
B007P4YAPK,18,14,I like the product but the recharging time is very long and the sync cable that it was sent with only works every now and then.
B007P4YAPK,18,15,I am in the process of 8 hour charging.
B007P4YAPK,18,16,Turned on the Asus this weeked and came on real slow, then when everything came up, I seen that it stated that I was charging at 82%.
B007P4YAPK,18,17,I know this because my wife has the same tablet and I tried using her charging cable.
B007P4YAPK,18,18,and about another week later, my tablet showed up on my doorstep.
B007P4YAPK,18,19,Then matters got worse.One day, I noticed it wasn't charging.
B007P4YAPK,18,20,But like I said before, that is not needed because the battery is amply sufficient.
B007P4YAPK,18,21,It won't work for power or data with any cable extention.
B007P4YAPK,18,22,Also using the keyboard allows me to leave it plugged in and charging while i am using it without worrying about crimping the power cord or yanking it out of the wall socket.
B007P4YAPK,18,23,That is a flaw as far as I am concerned, because if the tablet screen times out and turns off, you lose USB power.
B007P4YAPK,18,24,The unit seemed very nice with a lot of good features until 3 days went by and it would not take a charge.
B007P4YAPK,19,0,It has surprisingly loud audio, but it lacks stereo output (either because there's just one speaker, or, if there are two speakers, they're too close together).
B007P4YAPK,19,1,As for speakers, it only has one, on the right (or bottom) side.
B007P4YAPK,19,2,This means that watching a movie or playing a game in landscape (as they should be watched/played) meant that you only got sound out of one side, which doesn't sound like a big problem but it actually is really annoying really quickly considering that tablet speakers tend to be tinny sounding and aurally grating.
B007P4YAPK,19,3,I wish there were speakers on both, or even three sides like some competitors have, but they sound clear and are loud enough for me.
B007P4YAPK,19,4,However, the TF300t speaker was particularly irritating because it was on the side of the tablet when held in landscape.
B007P4YAPK,19,5,Awesome tablet, plagued by quality control issues.
B007P4YAPK,19,6,The display was crisp and the sound was surprisingly loud with only 1 speaker.
B007P4YAPK,19,7,Imagine someone talking loudly into one ear, and you'll know what it was like to listen to this speaker at any useable volume.
B007P4YAPK,19,8,That being said, the Pad's screen is a bit underwhelming.
B007P4YAPK,19,9,The build quality (or maybe the internal design) is not what I would call "bulletproof".
B007P4YAPK,19,10,Another awkward thing they did with the build was put the mono speaker to the right when tablet is positioned in landscape mode.
B007P4YAPK,19,11,If I want louder I plug in headphones or connect some via bluetooth.Now on to the bad.
B007P4YAPK,19,12,I hear it is pretty good with Skype too, but I did not try that.
B007P4YAPK,19,13,It is a little slow on refresh, but the resolution is good.
B007P4YAPK,19,14,I am extremely disappointed.
B007P4YAPK,19,15,That's always  good thing!
B007P4YAPK,19,16,So when both screens are turned on the graphics power is pretty much the same.
B007P4YAPK,19,17,Even if there were 2, there is no way you could get stereo sound with speakers so close together, so one is enough.I decided to buy the matching keyboard for it, and now when I show friends my purchase they say "Oh!
B007P4YAPK,19,18,When listening to audio/video in landscape mode it feels awkward because my right ear gets a higher volume than my left, but it isn't that big of a problem when in portrait mode.
B007P4YAPK,19,19,It works extremely well....  Until you shave.
B007P4YAPK,19,20,It still retained that swirled finish, which looked very nice and was practical too, since it provided a better grip.The single external speaker was pitiful as most tablet speakers are.
B007P4YAPK,19,21,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,19,22,It works fine outside a building and inside a car (we have a mini-van so lots of metal around).
B007P4YAPK,19,23,The keyboard has keys that make it possible to use the tablet entirely without touching it, but unfortunately, the bluetooth button is only used to activate/deactivate the tablet's bluetooth.
B007P4YAPK,19,24,So Far So Good.
B007P4YAPK,20,0,I have not tried the camera yet.
B007P4YAPK,20,1,A one star rating is even too good.
B007P4YAPK,20,2,There is something about the camera in the TF201 with indoor light.
B007P4YAPK,20,3,The camera is decent quality, the image is grainy and when zoomed in the image is very jagged/razor-like.
B007P4YAPK,20,4,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,20,5,Now the reason I took a star away.
B007P4YAPK,20,6,This includes the front-facing camera as well.
B007P4YAPK,20,7,While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.
B007P4YAPK,20,8,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,20,9,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,20,10,Then 5 stars absolutely.
B007P4YAPK,20,11,This unit works perfectly, no more shut downs for no reason.
B007P4YAPK,20,12,If it ever freezes which is usually caused by an app I just wait a few seconds and everything goes back to normal.Camera/Webcam- Both the camera and webcam are decent for this tablet; I was not expecting them to be head turning so no complaints here.-
B007P4YAPK,20,13,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,20,14,But all and all I like it its a good price.
B007P4YAPK,20,15,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B007P4YAPK,20,16,It just didn't work.
B007P4YAPK,20,17,I restarted it and once again it worked for 2 to 3 weeks until the screen stopped working again...When I called asus this time they said there is nothing they can do because it is out of warranty!
B007P4YAPK,20,18,The SL101 screen has a more heavy-duty feel, but doesn't have a second battery.
B007P4YAPK,20,19,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,20,20,I asked why I needed to do this when they asked for a picture.
B007P4YAPK,20,21,It is a little slow on refresh, but the resolution is good.
B007P4YAPK,20,22,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,20,23,In my personal opinion I like this tablet and the only thing that is wrong with it is that there are not many apps that are made for android tablets yet.
B007P4YAPK,20,24,Feature set for the price is great.. Asus seems to be the top as far as updates go.
B007P4YAPK,21,0,Is it too much to ask to be able to load pages at a speed greater than dialup?
B007P4YAPK,21,1,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,21,2,Reloading and reconfiguring a bit of a pain but download speeds now as I would wish them to be.
B007P4YAPK,21,3,Apps, graphics, so what?
B007P4YAPK,21,4,This thing is fast, enough ram, do not have to constantly kill background apps.
B007P4YAPK,21,5,I hate its speed.
B007P4YAPK,21,6,If you are not going to ROM it you might be disappointed with the speed of the device using the stock ROM it comes with.
B007P4YAPK,21,7,Also,  some Tegra 3 optimized games crash from time to time.
B007P4YAPK,21,8,As a result, they ate up a non-trivial amount of processing power and memory.
B007P4YAPK,21,9,These apps generally ran in the background and could not be killed/uninstalled.
B007P4YAPK,21,10,It wasn't the hardware but the software that was disappointing.
B007P4YAPK,21,11,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,21,12,Good tablet for the time.
B007P4YAPK,21,13,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,21,14,Although during the second day I did have a screen glitch where the screen would gitter up and down.
B007P4YAPK,21,15,No, I take it back, my T300 loads even more slowly than dialup.
B007P4YAPK,21,16,The apps loads fast.
B007P4YAPK,21,17,Apps that are optimized for tablets really shine on this device thanks to ICS and the quad-core processor.
B007P4YAPK,21,18,So far, there's nothing I've tried to do with it that's slowed it down.I did notice two glitches; the browser shut down a couple of times for no reason and had a hard time coming back up.
B007P4YAPK,21,19,That's always  good thing!
B007P4YAPK,21,20,Unfortunately, in the real world, things tend to work differently.
B007P4YAPK,21,21,The price was good at the time but now it is even better of course.
B007P4YAPK,21,22,Good hardware, shady software.
B007P4YAPK,21,23,Great battery life also
B007P4YAPK,21,24,I have multiple apps active at the same time with no speed penalty.
B007P4YAPK,22,0,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,22,1,It treats SD cards like you're only swapping a bit of data and taking it out.
B007P4YAPK,22,2,Secondly the keyboard has an sd slot which lets you add an additional 32 gb of memory thereby making it a 96 gb tablet beating out both the ipad and the toshibas.
B007P4YAPK,22,3,I added a 32 Gig micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,22,4,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,22,5,It has a socket and service for an LTE sim card.
B007P4YAPK,22,6,The prime does come in a 64 gig model but, i find that a 32 works just fine for me especially if you dont mind taking the time to swap out micro sd cards thus making the memory a moot point and i didnt feel like waiting on the toshiba(i like instant gratification).
B007P4YAPK,22,7,And I've had no problem finding apps on Google Play to fill all of my needs.
B007P4YAPK,22,8,The only issue I have is that the unit was an AT&T; device previously.
B007P4YAPK,22,9,The included SD slot makes it very expandable and is something that Nexus devices will never have.
B007P4YAPK,22,10,I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable!
B007P4YAPK,22,11,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,22,12,One annoyance: plugging in a SD card, and having it treat it like a forever-external drive that it's compelled to constantly have a notification of it's foreign-ness.
B007P4YAPK,22,13,I can't tell you how annoying lack of updates was with my phone.
B007P4YAPK,22,14,It doesn't care that you put it in there because you wanted more space for the tablet alone!
B007P4YAPK,22,15,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,22,16,Another problem is app to app integration.
B007P4YAPK,22,17,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,22,18,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B007P4YAPK,22,19,RAM is expandable via a microSD card which is also a big plus.
B007P4YAPK,22,20,Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you.
B007P4YAPK,22,21,Seems it may work a little too well.
B007P4YAPK,22,22,It works extremely well....  Until you shave.
B007P4YAPK,22,23,The tablet is great and the service was great.
B007P4YAPK,22,24,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,23,0,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,23,1,My only complaint with it is that its wireless doesn't seem to make as good of a connection as it should.
B007P4YAPK,23,2,I have a pretty strong wireless signal in my bedroom but this tablet seems to often drop the signal.
B007P4YAPK,23,3,I don't want a $600 device.
B007P4YAPK,23,4,Both Wifi and GPS work great.
B007P4YAPK,23,5,Give me the simplicity and functionality of an Android device like this any day.
B007P4YAPK,23,6,Sometimes when the device has been asleep, or freshly booted wifi refuses to turn on.
B007P4YAPK,23,7,And 2- even though the network is connected while sleeping (there's actually a setting for this), upon waking you have to wait for any updates to install before you can really use it for anything.Update 12\19 2013; I'm downgrading the network performance to poor/unacceptable.
B007P4YAPK,23,8,However, the same problem happens with the default browser and Google Chrome.
B007P4YAPK,23,9,Now, I've used Swiftkey on three other phones AND the Nexus 7, and had no problems with it.
B007P4YAPK,23,10,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,23,11,The problem he says is the videos regularly timeout on the pad, indicating the wifi network connection is slower.
B007P4YAPK,23,12,But you will still receive notifications and stay connected to wifi once screen is off.
B007P4YAPK,23,13,Right now I am having problems with my tablet staying on, and the browser closing on me, and when I shut it down it seem to be back on.
B007P4YAPK,23,14,Great tablet  - but has problems.
B007P4YAPK,23,15,It gets stuck in a permanent "starting wifi" state.
B007P4YAPK,23,16,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,23,17,The wifi works very well, a little better than my laptop (my laptop is a few years old) in fact.
B007P4YAPK,23,18,I waited a few days to update this review, to see if any problems cropped up.
B007P4YAPK,23,19,The auto-brightness control also appeared not to work or not to work properly.
B007P4YAPK,23,20,And I'm sure they'll address the web browser in the next update.
B007P4YAPK,23,21,A re-installation of the app usually fixes this problem.
B007P4YAPK,23,22,hummm!!  Changed the setting for timing out but it still just does what it wants.
B007P4YAPK,23,23,Using netTalk, I have been able to make phone calls from the tablet, over wi-fi of course.
B007P4YAPK,23,24,It was a toss-up between this and the ASUS Prime, with the metal case, but the Prime seems to have problems with the GPS and WiFi signal.
B007P4YAPK,24,0,Bought the Keyboard that only works on this asus product, bought a nice case, and bought a screen protector.
B007P4YAPK,24,1,This tablet was great ... for a month, then the touch screen became unresponsive for no apparent reason.
B007P4YAPK,24,2,It does better with touch.
B007P4YAPK,24,3,Now, the SL101's keyboard is OK.
B007P4YAPK,24,4,Kinda wierd when you want to go and touch the screen and it just closes before you get there.
B007P4YAPK,24,5,I returned that one the next day because it was so slow and the touch screen was random.
B007P4YAPK,24,6,The responsiveness of the touch screen is not consistent.
B007P4YAPK,24,7,This unit worked fine until the screen spontaneously cracked on its own after simply being shut with its docking station which should protect it and was then opened.
B007P4YAPK,24,8,Because i use the screen and don't intend on buying the dock so this problem is irrelevant to me.
B007P4YAPK,24,9,That being said, the Pad's screen is a bit underwhelming.
B007P4YAPK,24,10,If you do get this make sure you get the dock and the case for it.
B007P4YAPK,24,11,It's really pretty minor, but I notice when holding it at the corners that the screen edge can be squeezed into the case a fraction of a millimeter.
B007P4YAPK,24,12,Either way the problems stated above for me don't mean too much to me because I always buy screen protectors.-
B007P4YAPK,24,13,The touch screen works great for the access.I had looked at tablets last year and tried a 7 inch one.
B007P4YAPK,24,14,The SL101 screen has a more heavy-duty feel, but doesn't have a second battery.
B007P4YAPK,24,15,Although during the second day I did have a screen glitch where the screen would gitter up and down.
B007P4YAPK,24,16,During that time she complained it did not register her screen touches in the right location.
B007P4YAPK,24,17,It is fast and the touch screen is accurate.
B007P4YAPK,24,18,It really detracts from the experience (but it also registers when your hand is close, even when you don't touch it).
B007P4YAPK,24,19,Because the screen is either too sensitive or not sensitive enough, playing games or typing very frustrating at times.Overall, I am having fun with my tablet.
B007P4YAPK,24,20,This thing gets laggy and misses touch presses too much.
B007P4YAPK,24,21,Now a month later, I'm left with a dead tablet, unless (of course) I want to buy the $150 keyboard attachment, to which I say "no thanks, I already have a laptop."
B007P4YAPK,24,22,I have fairly large hands for a man, but I still find the keyboard dock adequate, just make sure you turn off the hyper-sensitive track pad while you're typing.
B007P4YAPK,24,23,I purchased the keyboard dock and a bluetooth mouse to accompany the TF300.
B007P4YAPK,24,24,This should have been a no-brainer, especially when one considers that Asus made such a functional keyboard dock in the first place.
B007P4YAPK,25,0,At first I was thinking I wouldn't be able to tell the difference... but I was wrong.This does not make me want to get the New iPad however, because I don't like the "Apple" way of doing things.
B007P4YAPK,25,1,I don't want a $600 device.
B007P4YAPK,25,2,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,25,3,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,25,4,I purchased the Asus tablet as a reasonable-priced iPad.
B007P4YAPK,25,5,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,25,6,Give me the simplicity and functionality of an Android device like this any day.
B007P4YAPK,25,7,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,25,8,Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,25,9,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,25,10,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,25,11,I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire.
B007P4YAPK,25,12,Also, the on screen ASUS keyboard is very glitchy.
B007P4YAPK,25,13,Good tablet for the time.
B007P4YAPK,25,14,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,25,15,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,25,16,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,25,17,Good enough but could be better!
B007P4YAPK,25,18,Hopefully this will change since there are so many great Android products out now.
B007P4YAPK,25,19,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,25,20,Might not have noticed but I also have access to Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 devices.
B007P4YAPK,25,21,Not good when one of the touted features is the display.
B007P4YAPK,25,22,I've always gathered that Asus was among the leaders in the Android tablet game, so I'm rather disappointed.
B007P4YAPK,25,23,Will give another update when I get the new one.Hope the new one is better, if not I will not be buying Asus anymore, even if the ratings are great.
B007P4YAPK,25,24,One last note,  a lot of the reviewers seem to not like the plastic case or at least have some issue with it.
B007P4YAPK,26,0,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,26,1,That cable that comes with it can get power from an ordinary USB port, but the amount of power would be so low it would take the whole day to recharge from a standard USB.
B007P4YAPK,26,2,Using the provided transformer, the tablet and keyboard are recharged within a few hours.The keyboard has support for 1 USB port, which I did not try yet except to recharge my phone.
B007P4YAPK,26,3,I would have liked to be able to use the keyboard from a distance, without it being connected to the tablet, which would have been nice considering the HDMI port.
B007P4YAPK,26,4,So i had to buy another cable.
B007P4YAPK,26,5,I don't like the propriety plug, and the no USB port.
B007P4YAPK,26,6,In the end, I decided that the USB adapter and this tablet would suffice.
B007P4YAPK,26,7,Do micro-USBs not provide enough power?
B007P4YAPK,26,8,However, if you feel you have to do it, that cable plugs into the tablet, to recharge as you use it.
B007P4YAPK,26,9,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,26,10,It also gives me usb ports.
B007P4YAPK,26,11,I transfer pictures from my camera by removing the micro SD card, copying from my PC and re-inserting it in the tablet.There are several drawbacks and that is why I give only four stars.It requires a special cable to charge that does come with it.There are no USB connections, unless you purchase the docking station.
B007P4YAPK,26,12,Also, you pretty much have to use the tablet upside-down when the adapter or the power cord is connected.
B007P4YAPK,26,13,I never tried to see if the old keyboard would work on the new one...the new one is a bit different...has one USB port instead of two (negative).
B007P4YAPK,26,14,It also plugs into the keyboard to recharge it independently, or to recharge both it and the tablet when they are assembled together, all the while still using the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,26,15,My tablet would not charge from either charger, but both chargers work with her tablet.
B007P4YAPK,26,16,I'd ordered an ACER 700 but returned it because of heat issues and the fact the HDMI port didn't work.
B007P4YAPK,26,17,Not necessary if you get the keyboard, however, as the keyboard has a full sized usb port built in.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Just found out that standard USB chargers (of any amperage) do not charge this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,26,18,I really wanted a tablet with a USB port so I could transfer photos in the field but no models so equipped were/are available at the time with an IPS screen (another one of my requirements).
B007P4YAPK,26,19,And since one end of the cable is a true USB connector (the end that goes in the transformer) you could buy a USB extension cable (male/female) if 6 feet is not enough for you, and you don't want to bring an electrical extension cord closer to you.
B007P4YAPK,26,20,I still prefer to be able to have additional power instead, but it would have been a nice feature to have bluetooth on the keyboard too.
B007P4YAPK,26,21,Be aware that when you are charging the keyboard, the tablet won't always charge to 100%.
B007P4YAPK,26,22,The only other connectors it has on the tablet are the proprietary power/keyboard connector, the micro-HDMI (which I have not tried yet) and the headset, which accepts and uses the model with integrated microphone (or without).
B007P4YAPK,26,23,Almost all other chargers use the USB standard 5 volts (including iPad or Nexus 7).
B007P4YAPK,26,24,If I look into the microSD port I can see the opening change shape when it's flexing.
B007P4YAPK,27,0,Everything worked for nearly 9 days.
B007P4YAPK,27,1,Several times per days like lugs or something.
B007P4YAPK,27,2,They kept telling me to do a factory reset (among other suggestions).
B007P4YAPK,27,3,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,27,4,Unfortunately, in the real world, things tend to work differently.
B007P4YAPK,27,5,It looked OK when I started the device, but even before I installed my applications the screen started flickering again, and a lot worse that before.
B007P4YAPK,27,6,It would finally come on but it would show the welcome screen and boot up as if I did a restart, but obviously I didn't.
B007P4YAPK,27,7,It just didn't work.
B007P4YAPK,27,8,This unit works perfectly, no more shut downs for no reason.
B007P4YAPK,27,9,A re-installation of the app usually fixes this problem.
B007P4YAPK,27,10,I do wish there was a deep sleep mode, so that when the screen is turned off it would shut the system down.
B007P4YAPK,27,11,Booted perfectly, did a firmware update, and I was off.
B007P4YAPK,27,12,If your tablet didn't update automatically (mine didn't) do so manually under Settings/About Tablet/System Firmware Update.
B007P4YAPK,27,13,Cold boot, reset to factory default setting didn't help.
B007P4YAPK,27,14,I had to go on line and find out how to operate it for the most part.
B007P4YAPK,27,15,So far, there's nothing I've tried to do with it that's slowed it down.I did notice two glitches; the browser shut down a couple of times for no reason and had a hard time coming back up.
B007P4YAPK,27,16,They recommended a factory reset followed by a cold boot.
B007P4YAPK,27,17,I was using the tablet a week ago and it randomly rebooted and throws an error every time it tries to boot now.
B007P4YAPK,27,18,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,27,19,I experienced these problems in different applications even on the main screen.After doing the reset option and a hard restart I was getting annoyed with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,27,20,Am just getting into the modern world and this is something I have to learn.. perhaps the things I dislike are fixable when I find out how to do it.
B007P4YAPK,27,21,These are the 2 main issues I've had in the past week.Otherwise, I'm happy with this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,27,22,Certain apps don't work on the tab and alot of apps seem like they are still in the beta phase.
B007P4YAPK,27,23,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,27,24,First of all, I would like to mention that this firmware update fixes the FLICKER issue that some of us have experienced.
B007P4YAPK,28,0,They have no incentive to provide any actual customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,1,It took about 3 weeks until the tablet returned and about one week later the problem returned.I sent it to ASUS repair again, and it was returned about 3 weeks later.
B007P4YAPK,28,2,so I called ASUS support by phone.
B007P4YAPK,28,3,Horrible customer support from ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,28,4,They don't have the replacement number for their own product?
B007P4YAPK,28,5,My first tablet, my last ASUS product.
B007P4YAPK,28,6,they told me I needed to send it in--at my cost--they would evaluate it and send me a quote.
B007P4YAPK,28,7,So we came back to Amazon to get a replacement and were told that they would not replace the item.
B007P4YAPK,28,8,I then said to tell me what the replacement part number was if I wanted to repair it myself.
B007P4YAPK,28,9,They told me it was at the repair facility but had not been received.
B007P4YAPK,28,10,He said tech support was very backlogged.
B007P4YAPK,28,11,I had problems with the tablet freezing and I called tech support several times.
B007P4YAPK,28,12,Asus said they only repair and we would have to pay to send the item to them.
B007P4YAPK,28,13,I restarted it and once again it worked for 2 to 3 weeks until the screen stopped working again...When I called asus this time they said there is nothing they can do because it is out of warranty!
B007P4YAPK,28,14,To add insult to injury, when we called Asus service they strongly encouraged us to return the unit to Amazon for replacement.
B007P4YAPK,28,15,That call had great, helpful service.
B007P4YAPK,28,16,He couldn't help either but gave me the info on how to contact (by email) someone who might be able to help.
B007P4YAPK,28,17,I have owned the Asus TF300T 32G for 10 months.
B007P4YAPK,28,18,Unlike Amazon return process, I ended up paying for the return postage :-( Waiting for the return reach them and hopefully I will get the replacement quickly and it works well...
B007P4YAPK,28,19,Gee, how do you know what it costs if you don't have the number Asus?
B007P4YAPK,28,20,They just want to obviously overcharge you for their ridiculous repair cost for their defective product they don't want to repair themselves under the warranty.3.
B007P4YAPK,28,21,It was out of warranty by only 10 days and they said it didn't matter that I had called with the same problem with the tablet multiple times when it was under warranty.
B007P4YAPK,28,22,Will update my review after I get my return done.Update 10/8/2012:I got the return authorized by the seller quickly.
B007P4YAPK,28,23,I'm 62 years old and have dealt with quite a few.I will NEVER, EVER, buy any ASUS product again and will never recommend that company.
B007P4YAPK,28,24,Contacted Asus customer care and after troubleshooting they said I'd have to send it in for an estimated 80 dollar repair.
B007P4YAPK,29,0,I did what they said and it worked, but then only two weeks later the screen stopped responding again.
B007P4YAPK,29,1,Touchscreen stopped working...
B007P4YAPK,29,2,Then touch screen started behaving crazy.
B007P4YAPK,29,3,Sometimes i'm forced to use my little finger.
B007P4YAPK,29,4,Tablet looks very good until I have a problems with touch screen.After about 4 weeks of using screen at top right part become occasionally unresponsive.
B007P4YAPK,29,5,Although during the second day I did have a screen glitch where the screen would gitter up and down.
B007P4YAPK,29,6,Everything worked for nearly 9 days.
B007P4YAPK,29,7,Several times per days like lugs or something.
B007P4YAPK,29,8,I like all capacity this tablet gives me, the only thing i don't like very much is the presicion for pointing places on the screen.
B007P4YAPK,29,9,Issue with Touchscreen.
B007P4YAPK,29,10,Either way the problems stated above for me don't mean too much to me because I always buy screen protectors.-
B007P4YAPK,29,11,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,29,12,At first it would fix itself if I restarted it, but not anymore.
B007P4YAPK,29,13,Upgrading android helped, as now android pop-us a zoomed window when clicking on buttons and links in the web browsers.However, after the upgrade we have a new problem.
B007P4YAPK,29,14,They give you a screen cleaner and you will use it quite a bit, every few days the screen needs a good wipe as the finger prints start to become very visible.
B007P4YAPK,29,15,Sometimes it just won't respond.
B007P4YAPK,29,16,Touchscreen behaving crazy within 10 days.
B007P4YAPK,29,17,It is a finger print magnet.
B007P4YAPK,29,18,Sometimes it will behave crazy - automatically zoom in, close programs, open new programs, etc! When I did a search in web, I found many others have had similar problems.
B007P4YAPK,29,19,I restarted it and once again it worked for 2 to 3 weeks until the screen stopped working again...When I called asus this time they said there is nothing they can do because it is out of warranty!
B007P4YAPK,29,20,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,29,21,Almost tickles when you move your fingers across it.
B007P4YAPK,29,22,Non responsive, random clicking... just after 30 days... so I can not return it to amazon.
B007P4YAPK,29,23,A few other times the screen wouldn't turn back on even though I'm pushing the power button multiple times.
B007P4YAPK,29,24,I returned that one the next day because it was so slow and the touch screen was random.
