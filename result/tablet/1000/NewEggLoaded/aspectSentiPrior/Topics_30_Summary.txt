Speakers stereo separation is very good but the lower frequency sound is poor.6.	-4.784
And the sound quality and volume were excellent.	-4.803
However, I keep mine in the Samsung case (sold separately), so the build deficits aren't noticeable.Speakers:Placing stereo speakers at opposite edges of the screen facing forward is a great idea, except the speakers aren't loud enough and have a tinny sound.	-4.896

According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.	-4.624
It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something.	-5.007
The only reason I have this four stars was that the camera sometimes does not focus well if you are taking a photo of a room.	-5.083

The keyboard does not work well.	-4.057
Everything on screen is still visible, just no touch function at all with either finger or pen.	-4.754

Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such.	-4.568

However lately when he moves it a certain way the screen gets lines across it and is unreadable.	-4.321
If he moves it when that happens, the screen will straighten out for a bit and then go back to lines.	-4.684
I am also disappointed that you can't shrink windows down to a single bar at the bottom of the screen like you can in Microsoft Windows for PC.	-4.868
