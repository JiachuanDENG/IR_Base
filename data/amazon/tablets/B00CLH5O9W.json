Used it and loved it, great little machine!  I waited for a major upgrade and finally the 8.9 HDX arrived.  I have mine and it is everything I expected.  I have every app on this machine, including Google earth, maps search (incl voice),drive, Gmail, adobe flash on dolphin browser and Opera is also installed, Many of these apps were put on thru 1mobile or mobogenie. There are a few little hiccups but nothing that causes me any concern.  There are workarounds for installing most of the apps that are not in the Amazon app store. Look on the internet to find these.This tablet's screen is outstanding, the colors are bright, beautiful. The sound is wonderful, the only thing that bugs me is the lack of a good case, I saw the Origami case at Best Buy, not to my liking. I am sure a better, cheaper case is coming.  The screen needs a good easy screen protector that is easy to install with no bubbles, I will wait for that also.

I loved my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" and now I just can't believe how much faster, lighter and more intuitive the HDX is.  In reviews I've seen in online magazines and such almost always have the Kindle HDX come out on top of the competition ... Apple's IPad Air is trounced in nearly every aspect.  With the $79/year Prime membership, you can watch great movies and TV shows, with a huge selection being free (included in the Prime membership.)  Now you can actually download select videos to watch when out of WiFi range.  As always, the new Fire HDX includes the Amazon Lending Library which lets you borrow certain Kindle e-books for a month.

First the very cool product presentation box and then I opened it to find an adapter included with my treasure. I did a little dance of joy and then unwrapped my treasure. The setup was seamless and it was as easy to get around as my Fire HD. First order of the day was to enlarge the font and set all of my preferences. I admit I did get distracted playing Hearts and seeing new avatars. Back to the serious business and the keyboard which is easy to use and comfortable with my HDX sitting on my lap with my feet up on the ottoman. The response time is awesome! I used the camera to take a pic of me and my new toy and one of my computer monitor. I was curious if the color would be right and if light would be an issue with the photo. Both pictures turned out well but I went to edit to see all the cool things one can do if your want to edit your picture. The sound is clear with and without earphones. I also read part of a magazine to check on the print and color. Both are visually better than the Fire HD and my iPad with Retina. I am thrilled with my purchase except my Scrabble game from the HD is not available on the HDX. When I used Mayday, Steve dressed in a smile, shirt and tie was able to help me and offer hope.

Great to bring with you on the go and simply holding in your hand.Easy set up.  A few quick prompts and it was ready to go.  If you are getting this as a gift make sure you note that when you order it, otherwise it will automatically set up to your account.Things I didn't like:Amazon app store is lagging compared to Google's Play.  I previously had an Autocad WS app that I used on my phone, when I tried it on the Kindle Fire I was told I had to update it.  Unfortunately Amazon does not have the update on it's app store and it would not let me go elsewhere.  There is a way to get the apps as a quick search will tell you but I don't really want to pay this price and then have to do some work around.If all you want is something to keep you entertained then I highly recommend the Kindle Fire HDX especially if you are a Prime member.  It is very much improved over the original Kindle Fire that I got my wife when they first come out.If, like me, you want to use it for other things then I would keep on looking or at least make sure the apps you need are on Amazon.  I would up returning mine after a few days use, for me it simply was not worth the cost.  So if I returned it, why the five stars?  Well, I believe Amazon built this for entertainment, be it reading books or watching movies.  And in these areas it excels.  If Amazon ever gets their app store to be on par with Google's then I will definitely be looking at this again.

The UPS man delivered it today and it came beautifully wrapped.  When I opened the box, I was very happy to find that this version included the powerfast charger block unlike it's predecessor.  The HDX 8.9 is sleek, shiny and amazingly light!  The resolution and graphics are phenomenal.  The sound is fine for me for movies, videos and games.  In previous versions of the Kindle Fire, Silk has always been sluggish and froze a lot.  I have not had that problem at all, even when having 4 or more tabs open!  YAY!I have downloaded several of my books and the reading and coloration is fine just like previous versions.  Videos play nice, they are not choppy at all.  Downloads are still amazingly quick and the resolution and sound are awesome.  The App store seems to have picked up a bunch of new apps for this Kindle as well.  I am happy to report that Candy Crush works like a charm on my HDX 8.9 :DI was able to set up my social media sights quickly and easily along with several email accounts.  This was very easy to work through and no hassle at all.  The battery on it seems to be holding out fine with me playing around with it for the last 5 hours.Overall, I love the 8.9 HDX.  It does take a little getting used to though because the carousel is a bit different and the power and volume button are in odd places (on the back of the Kindle).

Usually a one star product is clearly junk, but that is not the case here.If I were to rate the hardware only (I bought the HDX 8.9 w/o special offers), I would say it's a five star product. But we can't just rate this on hardware alone, we have to look at both the software and Amazon's walled garden policies.I read all the reviews from the gadget sites about how this was somewhat crippled by lack of access to google play, but that you could sideload apps, and that if you wanted to consume Amazon content that it was a good choice. As all I wanted it for was to read ebooks, I thought it would be perfect. It has probably the best screen I've seen on a tablet (compared to my new Galaxy Note 2014 and my wife's Ipad Retina, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is the better screen). The problem was I have a lot of technical ebooks (I'm a software developer) from Oreilly press, and I prefer PDF format for these. I also have a few ePub books. I did some research and found moon+ reader pro in the Amazon store. I figured I was good to go, I could buy Moon Reader + pro and have a device that could read all my kindle books, watch amazon prime, and read my ePubs and PDFs. Then the tablet came and I logged in to the store, and Moon Reader + Pro was not listed. I followed a link from the web and lo-and-behold it says \"Not compatible with your device\"..which was interesting because the free version worked just fine. I wanted the pro because It supports PDFs and the ads are annoying. I then looked for other readers in the Amazon store that would support ePub or PDF and work on my device and guess what...there weren't any. Interestingly enough, there are other readers in the Amazon store such as Aldiko..they just say they aren't compatible with the HDX 8.9.. if you sideload them from the web they work fine though so it's not a compatibility issue. It's Amazon putting artificial limits on what content you can easily view on a kindle device. I don't mind the lack of Google Play because I can understand Amazon not wanting to pay to license from Google or follow Google's policies. But when they have apps that work for what I want in their App store but they intentionally limit access to them to Kindle Devices because they allow ePub and PDF content I have a problem with that.In closing, I would say that if you want to consume Amazon content, an Apple Ipad is currently the best choice. You have full access to a huge selection of apps, and you get the ability to view Amazon Instant Video and you get Text To Speech in the kindle reader. I absolutely despise Apple products so it pains me to recommend them, but for Amazon content the Ipad is the best choice. Android is purposefully crippled by Amazon. They do not have an Instant Video app for Android (other than for the Kindle Fire) and they don't support Text To Speech for Android (again other than the Kindle Fire). As for me I returned the Kindle and bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition. I don't get prime videos, but I do get Netflix if I want and I've started looking elsewhere for books and movies.I originally started buying from Amazon because I liked the choice, I liked the customer service, and they made things easy. With this tablet, they have taken away the choice of content and nothing was easy. Customer service is the only thing left. I'll still shop at Amazon for almost everything else I buy, but my great opinion of them was tarnished by the whole experience and I probably won't buy another Kindle device. At least they made it very easy to return the Kindle Fire.", "Title": "It pains me to have to give this one star....", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Author": "Annie \"Annie\"", "ReviewID": "RUUH8XI4ZDS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love the new front and rear cameras and all the new improvements.  I have a Kindle Fire HD, that I was very happy with, but with all the new improvements on the HDX, I just had to order it.  The processing speed is lightening fast, the picture and video quality is the best, and this almost replaces my laptop for functionality.  I purchased the MS Office app, and it allows me to view, edit, and print any of my office documents.  I also love that all my apps, books, music, etc can be downloaded onto any of my three Kindles.

I highly recommend the Kindle over any other brand.", "Title": "Wonderful New Improvements", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Author": "L.L.", "ReviewID": "R3326NLXIZ0FFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really wanted the 8.9 fire last year but it lacked certain features that I really wanted so I purchased the cheapest 7\" instead and decided to hold out until the 2013 version of the 8.9 with confidence that Amazon would have it right by then. I'm glad I did!First, delivery time was amazing. I ordered Friday night and to my surprise, it was delivered Saturday afternoon. This was my big gift to myself for this holiday season and I was expecting it to take a couple of weeks to get here like my previous Kindle orders. I'm still waiting on the cover as I decided not to go with the origami case after reading reviews of it being very heavy.As soon as I opened the box and had my precious in my hands, I knew I was right to wait for this version. It's exactly what I wanted. The weight is perfect, the rubber backing and beveling make it easy to hold at any angle.Turning it on with the new button in the back is a breeze. Once it was booted up I was ready to go. All of my apps were waiting to be downloaded from the cloud as well as all of my books and magazines. It took about 10 minutes to download all of them. Some apps aren't available yet for this model, like Draw Something but that's a developer issue, not a Kindle issue. The display is beautiful and crisp and the volume buttons are great. No more swiping down to adjust the volume while watching a video!I've synched two gmail accounts, one for work and one for personal use. I'm able to get notifications for both at the same time which is much easier than logging in and out or having to use two devices to get notifications for each. I've tested Picasso for drawing and the response to the stylus is incredible.I'm loving the side-bar swipe to access other apps while in use of another app instead of having to close out the current app to use another. If I'm watching a video on netflix or reading a book, I can quickly swipe to the side bar, check my email or look something up in wikipedia and then get back to my content.I love the rear camera, which was a big reason for holding out for this version. I've taken a few pictures, edited them on the tablet and shared with facebook from the editor with great ease. Videos are very nice and clear in HD and also very easily uploaded to facebook from the kindle. I would like to see some better video editors in the kindle apps but for now this is good.The processor is super fast, even with several apps open I've had no freeze ups or delays getting to content. Mostly, this is used for entertainment but now and then I need to do some work related stuff while I'm using it for entertainment. No problems at all with pausing a game, retrieving an email with a document, editing the doc, sending out and getting right back to my game.Lastly, battery life. I've been running Swagbucks videos on both the old Kindle Fire and the new one for the last 2.5 hours starting both with a full charge. The old Fire is at 70% now and the new one is at 80%. With the new one I've had it in constant use with games, videos and reading for more than 4 hours at a time without it getting below 56% charge. Including the PowerFast Charger with this Kindle was the cherry on top, it really does charge it fast!I have a lot of faith in Amazon as a company and was certain if I just waited it out another year they would have the tablet I wanted and I was right. Apple quality has been slipping in recent years as they seem more focused on new gimmicks to keep people lined up at their stores every year than quality. I think this tablet will hold it's value for a couple of years at least without feeling like I'm missing out if I don't upgrade it with each new version and that is also important to me.

Not for \"us\", of course.  See the details below for the details. - There are (really useful) apps which you cannot get on an iPad - Price :)Cons: - Not an iPadQuick Bottom Line:  If you want a great, versatile tablet then get this and save some money.  If you need an iPad then get that.Now some details; let's start with a comparison...Size (and weight) (different and may now) matter - This larger version of the Kindle Fire is much smaller, a tiny bit thicker, and a tad lighter than the iPad 5 Air. Of course that means the screen is a bit smaller too, about an inch.  Frankly, from using the previous versions of both  devices, which had similar physical dimensions, everything is close enough to not really matter a lot.Speed - About the same when doing similar activities side-by-side.  Same for wireless down/upload speeds.Available apps.  There are a lot more apps available of the iPad.  Again from personal experience, there are enough of any type available for the Kindle Fire that I can always find one (or more) that I like.  After that, how many note taking apps (for example) do I need?THERE ARE SOME apps available for the Kindle (and android in general) that are not available for the iPad.  One that I use, which for some IS REASON ENOUGH to choose a Kindle, is \"WiFi Analyzer\".Price - Another tiny difference is that the Fire costs hundreds of dollars less than a similarly configured iPad.  This can matter a lot if none of the other differences do.The May Day Feature - I have friends who bought iPads for their technically challenged, typically older, relativeness.  The intent was to provide a foolproof platform for access to email and those internets.  Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't.  When it didn't getting problems resolved could be difficult since Grandma wasn't always willing to head out to the local Genus bar.  With this feature, the bar come to her.  Kidding aside, it positions this as the gift device of choice for anyone who might feel threatened with alternative tablets.Now for some specifics about this device: - The Ads supported version - They never get in the way.  As with previous versions, for me it is worth saving some money. - Display:  The display is outstanding!  Even better than the previous version, clear and bright without making everything look like a comic book and shows up well in sunlight without having to turn the display way up (which means the battery won't drain quickly). - Usability:  I've grown to prefer the Kindle interface, compared to the iPad or \"Native\" android tablets. The Kindle prominently displays apps used most recently and the ones I just installed in a side scrolling \"Carousel\". Other apps are just a few taps away. That's great for me and greater still for my young daughter ssince there's no hunting for the things I'm likely to want the most. The iPhone and other Androids I've seen do it the other way around. - First use: First use was very straightforward. I liked that it knew my name without me having to tell it. First thing it did, after greeting me (by name) was ask for my WiFi password. Once I logged it, it already knew about the apps, music, books, and videos I am using on my other Kindle devices.  I realize iPad does something similar. However, having used both, I feel the Kindle is easier. -On the business side, the built-in office software is handy and saves me from having to buy it outright.  I can access my email accounts, including those in an Exchange server, with no problems. Attachments, including .PDF files, Word documents, and Excel spreadsheets can all be read with no problems. - Back to the fun stuff, YouTube, Netflix, and SmugMug videos stream flawlessly. Pandora provides music without a hitch. It connects to Bluetooth devices quickly and easily. - The Camera:  The front facing camera, designed for video conferencing, provides a clear image while the screen provides a vivid image of the person at the other end. We ran some side-by-side tests with our iPad 3 and the Fire always performed better. They've added a rear-facing camera which I probably won't use for taking snapshots (that's what an iPhone is for) and will for Skype sessions where I want to show my surrounds. - The Missing Charger: Isn't missing this time.  In the past Amazon didn't include on, probably figuring by this time most people already had *something* capable of charging their latest device and would prefer to save a couple bucks.  This time they tossed one in.  Still, if you haven't sprung for a Bolse\u00ae 4 Port High Output Charger buy now, you're missing out.", "Title": "A huge improvement over the previous, outstanding version and (please don't hate me) preferred to our iPad5", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Author": "Nigel", "ReviewID": "R2I2B6FNW7KXT1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best Kindle ever.

Precourt", "ReviewID": "R26X2B56V34235", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I recommended the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 to my uncle who wanted a tablet just for basic stuff like e-mail, web browsing, Skype, etc.  I thought this one may be the best fit for him because he is not very tech savy and always asking me for help with his computer.  The 'Mayday' feature was the tipping point over other tablets as he could get assistance right on the device.I ordered the device for him and had it shipped to myself for setup and planned to ship it out to him, along with a wi-fi router already configured to it.  While performing the initial setup I quickly realized that this was not going to be a good fit at all, dispite the Mayday feature.  Here are my observations.The first problem I ran into was that the Kindle OS is VERY limited on settings compared to any other Android device that I've used (and I've used many over many years.)  The first thing I wanted to change was font size as he is older and would have difficulty reading the extremely small print size and found that there are only two settings for font size (normal and large, which isn't much larger than normal.)  On some screens it's acceptable, but on others it's still SO small, like the registration page for example.  It does have a 'magnifier' setting, but that is a pain to use as you have to pan around the screen to see everything with two figner swipes.  All my other Android devices have five (5) different font size choices, allowing easy reading of the entire screen at one time.  I found the limitation of settings options to be the case throughout the device menus - very few customization settings options.The second big problem which was the deal breaker is that you MUST provide credit card information, address, etc in order to download FREE apps.  I confirmed this with a rep over the Mayday feature, which I must say does work flawlessly.  My uncle did not want to provide this information as he never plans on downloading anything that would cost him, as he will only be using this for basic things.No flash support at all, at least out of the box.  I know this can be an issue on other tablets, like iPad especially, however, I could not get any videos to play on the Kindle Fire at all, not even YouTube, which generally will work on any other tablet I've owned.  Couldn't try downloading any other browsers or apps due to the need for a credit card to download free apps.At this point I gave up and decided to return it and get him the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 instead, as it is a full featured Android tablet and won't require him to provide credit card information to download free apps from the Google play store.In all fairness, I realize this device might not be designed to be a full featured tablet, but I was hoping for more and did not expect it to be locked down so much.There are good things about it though, if you can deal with the other shortcomings.  The screen is amazing!  The sound quality is also very good.  It's lightweight and seems to run pretty fast (although I really couldn't do much with it to explore that.)  The Mayday feature is great also!  The camera takes good pictures, although it seems to take a long time to focus.If you are a Kindle user and want a device for that purpose this is a great product that goes beyond the basic Kindle experience.  If you're looking for a more robust Android tablet you may want to look at some of the other choices out there.", "Title": "Not an Android tablet - very limited", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Author": "Rosalie Buck \"CHESSNUT\"", "ReviewID": "R292JAY86V1CII", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The device I purchased in January would not connect to wireless or update my email unless I powered down 2 to 3 times a day.

Finally I was told that Amazon was aware of this particular problem with other devices and a software update would fix the problem. It was not fixed. I was told a replacement would likely have the same problem, so I decided to return the Kindle as well as the case (which will only fit the Kindle).I paid $523.99 for the Kindle and case.

Nothing too in depth just some basic office apps. I also would like to have a tablet that I could sync with my Android phone but that wasn't a deal breaker, I could live without that option.I was contemplating this tablet or the Nexus 7, Asus Memo FHD 10\" tablet, or a Samsung one. Well the Nexus 7 screen was too small for me especially when watching Netflix or movies but was awesome for gaming. The Samsung tablets were surprisingly expensive when compared to other tablets that offered more in terms of screen display, speed, and functionality (I think my biggest dismay with Samsung is their Touchwhiz overlay. I mean it's good when it works but it sucks when it doesn't, I have a Galaxy S4.) I didn't like the size of the 10\" tablets, so I thought an 8-9\" tablet would be a good compromise and it turned out to be the perfect size range for me.Now I knew that the Kindles come with an Amazon skin, Mojito 3.0 OS as they like to call it, on all their hdx tablets and this works well....for the most part, depending on what type of person you are with a tablet. Now onto the positives and negatives.I'll touch first on the positives, IMHO.-The screen is fantastic. The colors \"pop\" out and really are vibrant. What's even better is the battery life paired with this is phenomenal, at least in my usage. (I'll touch on this a little later.) You can really tell that they had put some time and effort into making the screen one of the best. I think it really shows the ingenuity of how well they were able to push a wonderfully looking screen. The PPI is almost absurd, 339, with a resolution of 2560 x 1600. Incredible, especially when Apple's own Ipad Air has this; 2048 x 1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch (ppi). Kudos to you Amazon for making such a wonderful and beautiful display. Oh, and having 100% sRGB color accuracy helps with making all the images and colors shine and pop out. All my movies and shows really looked astounding in low or high lighting. Touch reaction was spot on, no lag. Everything was very responsive and concise. Very impressive screen.-The speakers.....oh my the speakers. They too are awesome. When I had first turned on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\", my gf almost didn't believe the sound was coming from a tablet! The sound is fantastic, not the absolute best, but close to it. You can really hear the Dolby Digital from within these speakers. The highs and mids are great while the lows are discernable enough to make them sound as they should, given what speakers they're coming from. Even on the highest volume setting, the sound was still clear and crisp. It didn't sound muffled or reduced as you would hear in some speakers. TBH, I never tried the listening through the headphones so I can't comment on that, sorry.-The battery. Very impressive, imo. I had used my tablet for an avg. day, 4-6 hrs with mostly gaming and watching videos, some light reading (Had the Amazon Prime Free trial membership while had my Kindle Fire hdx.) The brightness was always set to auto. I didn't have any email setup so never had to push notify there. So specifically speaking, I used this tablet strictly for watching videos and playing games, while doing some light reading. I would charge my tablet about once every 3-4 days. The charge time was always brief, never going over a few hours, charged just as fast if not faster than my Galaxy s4. Battery was impressive with my usage.-Speed. Not much to comment here other than it was super fast! It's the only tablet I've seen so far that changes orientation from landscape to portrait INSTANTLY. I mean instantly, no lag whatsoever. It was nice. With a quad core Snapdragon 800 on 2.2 GHz Krait 400, it flies. Add to boot it has an Andreno 330 GPU and 2gb of ram, it has the latest and greatest processing power at this time. It definitely showed when playing games or multitasking. Apps loaded with ease, everything was super responsive, no lag whatsoever that I had encountered.-Cameras. I opted for the 32g version as I wasn't sure how much of personal content I was going to add on here. I never used the camera other than for a test. I like the fact that the HDX 8.9\" version has a LED back flash and an overall better camera on it than the HDX 7\" but it's really not needed but nice to have, for me it wasn't necessary. To note, the HDX 8.9\" has both a front and rear facing camera with a LED flash on the back. I add this to my positives b.c even though it's not really necessary to have a camera on a tablet it's nice to have \"just in case\".-Size. The overall dimensions of this tablet are great. It's actually pretty light and not at all bulky or thick. The dimensions are what is expected in this day and age for top end tablets. Unless you tack on the Amazon made and endorsed Origami case onto it which adds almost double the weight. It surely protects but it adds a considerable amount of bulk.-Having Amazon Prime. If you're already a member or thinking of becoming one then an Amazon Kindle is the way to go if you want a tablet. It offers a bundle of advantages to Kindle Fire owners when they also have Prime, it's a great service. However, in recent days I've read and heard they are looking to increase the price of Amazon Prime because of shipping costs (2 day free shipping is included in Prime.) and the like but I guess that's still in the talks and perhaps their may not be a price hike after all? Hope not. :)  You get to borrow one book/mo from their extensive library, you have access to their Prime video library (I honestly think Netflix is better but to each their own.), and other nice features as well.Negatives-Tied exclusively to Amazon...Now before I say anything else, some people may view this as a positive but again, I said these were IMHO. I know you could root and flash to another ROM but outside the box you're stuck with just Amazon and their regulated ecosystem. (Some people don't want to take the risk of voiding their warranty or bricking their devices just to get it to run an Android rom or the like. I understand that it can be a simple process but sometimes the risk doesn't negate the end result for some.) I didn't think much of it initially but as the days went by I was becoming more envious of not having the Play store. I bought this tablet mainly for media consumption so I had hoped I would be set on what Amazon provided...I was. For a bit. I liked the idea that Amazon has \"coins\" you can purchase for a discounted price in which you can use anywhere in their mobile store. The Amazon store is good but if you're looking for game or other entertainment apps then the Play or App store is the way to go.-No external sd card port. I know that with the newer versions of Android most apps and games you can't transfer to the sd card but knowing it's there in case you want to save personal music, vids, or pics, is nice to know. I will say in the Kindle Fire HDX's defense it has a nice cloud based server to \"drop\" things into but at this moment I'm not completely sold on the \"cloud\" universe yet. Time will tell.-Read up on some current Fire HDX owners complaining about their power adapter plug-in port becoming loose or outright breaking. I don't want to scare anyone but please be forewarned that this is an issue, how big or small Idk but it was one of the top complaints when I did my research. I was leery myself b.c the way the charger adapter plugs in is very odd and can easily seeing it being broken or malfunctioning in the future and the incidents where people had notified Amazon about it, well that's another story. It plugs in at an angle slighted towards up. It's kind of odd that it would plug in at an angle and not level with the tablet. It looks very wonky, imo. With my luck, the charging port would break a day after the warranty, lol.OVERALLIf you shop Amazon frequently, or have Amazon Prime, plan on getting it, or want a tablet that's easy to use comparatively (Mayday button is a great feature for noobies and the like.) then this tablet is for you. If this tablet had the option to either have the Amazon store or the Play store downloaded right out of the box then I would've downloaded the Play Store and would have kept my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\"  I honestly couldn't take having a \"locked\" down app store but again to each their own. I like having Google Voice, Maps, Gmail, etc right out the box. So instead of keeping my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\", I had replaced it with the LG G pad 8.3\" tablet and my the differences. It's almost night and day even though they are both running Android technically. I will be writing a review for that tablet once I get to know all the nuances with that one.But overall the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" is an AWESOME tablet. It's just I, myself, didn't like having just the Amazon store and no direct access to the Play store especially when I had purchased some apps from there on my Galaxy s4. I would highly recommend this tablet it you're looking to use it to read, watch movies, and some other light entertainment activities.For gaming and productivity I would undoubtedly recommend an Android, Windows, or Apple tablet.Happy shopping and thanks for reading my take on the Amazon Kindle Fired HDX 8.(\"", "Title": "Awesome tablet if you're ok with having JUST Amazon right out of the box....", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Author": "Iris McElroy", "ReviewID": "R3AGVZ498GCL2V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reviews from many sources, I choose to purchase another Kindle Fire HDX.

Some of them can have features you don't understand and sometimes they just all seem to be the same thing at different prices, so you don't know which one to pick. As someone who has had personal experience with several different tablets (and a couple e-readers), I would recommend this one. It comes with so many features and options that it may seem overwhelming at first, but it's definitely worth sifting through it all.The Kindle Fire HDX is designed with the user in mind and is built to help you do everything you would want to on a tablet. The Kindle has always had a pretty good display, but this one truly takes it to the next level. The images and colors pop out at you just as well as any good computer, and possibly better than some. They also gave us improved brightness settings and reduced the glare so you can use the tablet in bright lights or outside without blinding yourself or having to deal with those annoying bright spots.The performance is better than any Kindle before. In layman's terms, it works faster and better than ever before. Even so, it's very thin for easy holding and storage, but very durable, so it takes more to break it. It claims to have a 12 hour battery life, or 18 if you're just reading, but in my experience it can often stretch to around 20, depending on what you're doing.The two cameras, one on the front and one on the back, are excellent. The front camera offers a pretty clear picture. It's perfect for taking selfies or things like video calls with your friends or your boss. The read end camera takes amazing quality pictures and comes with a flash option so you can even use the camera in dark environment. The rear end camera also comes with several features and options which improve picture taking.The Kindle Fire HDX also has a new feature which they call the MayDay button. It's basically a help button that you can push at any time. It connects you to a live representative who can help you with any problem you're having with the Kindle. They're available at any time, for free. I've used the service a couple of times when I was confused about how to do something and they were great. They helped me fix my issue quickly and they were super polite. This feature may seem unnecessary but you won't think that when you end up needing it. You'll be glad that it's there and that you can use it for free!It comes with Prime Instant Video downloads. You have to already be an Amazon Prime member to use it, but once you are, this feature means that you can download any video from Amazon Prime to your tablet. Then you can watch it wherever you are, even if you don't have an internet connection. I use this to watch movies on long flights. It keeps me entertained and even helps me a bit with the sick feeling I usually get on planes.The tablet comes with a lot of new apps that can help you do the stuff that's important to you, like accessing your email and calender, plus a lot of other new apps to help your productivity. Of course, you can still install all the other apps that you might want to, just like with any other tablet.They've also added a new and improved operating system for this version, which they call Mojito. It starts with an Android base, but Amazon has added on a lot of their own stuff to make it more personal and easier to use for their customers. Mojito is completely customer oriented, so you're sure to love how convenient it is and what it can do for you.This tablet comes with a huge amount of other features that I can't possibly discuss here as thoroughly as they deserve to be. Beyond that, it has some options that are personalize at the time of purchase. They give you three options for the amount of storage you want - 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB. I personally am using the 64 GB version, but if you're usually the tablet casually or just for reading, you can probably get away with a smaller amount of storage.They let you choose whether or not you want to see advertisements on your table (what they call special offers), and it's not that much more, so I would recommend getting the ad free version, but it's not that big of a deal if you don't want to pay extra for it.They also give you options about your internet connection. You can choose to get just Wi-fi, or you can get 4G LTE from either Verizon or AT&T.; I go through AT&T; and it's always worked perfectly for me. Pages load great and load time is nearly non-existent.You can also buy a 2 year warranty which includes accident protection. This isn't necessary, but I would recommend it, just in case something happens. Paying a little more to get the warranty is a lot cheaper than if the tablet breaks for whatever reason and you don't have any way to replace it. After all, buying a replacement tablet will cost far more than what you would pay for the warranty. It just makes sense when you do the math. You might also want to consider buying a case for it. I have one, and it helps me to keep it safe, plus it looks pretty cool.Overall, I would definitely recommend the Kindle Fire HDX, whether you're looking for a new tablet or just a simple e-reader. It has the features to be great for everybody.

I've used the iPad, iPad mini and Blackberry Playbook, so I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted in a tablet. In the end, I narrowed it down to the Kindle Fire and iPad because I'm a member of Prime and I wanted to view Amazon streaming video on on a mobile device. Also, my favorite apps are not available for Android devices. I chose the Kindle Fire because of price and I know I will still one day get an iPad. So, the Fire is my iPad Mini. In terms of functionality, and I'll discuss this more below, the Fire is more reader and less tablet.With all that said, here's what I do love about the device -- it's a great value. The size is perfect for reading and I do love to hold it portrait style and read it like a book. If I feel really daring, I do so without the origami case so that I can appreciate how lightweight it is. The Amazon leather origami case is a really cool idea, but not great protection. Took me a day or so to get used to it. I do wish is was lighter and I wish I could get it in pink.I like the organization of my stuff -- carousel, home page/favorites and collections. I do have suggestions for improvements:1. I wish you could add web pages to the carousel2.  I wish the tablet would learn that just because I used something recently, I don't want it in the carousel.3.  I wish the collections could be for more than apps. For example, for my morning devotion time, I would love a collection that contained my gospel playlist, Bible reading apps and certain Kindle books.4.  There's no way to organize picturesMayday is so sweet. Although, I've realized that the help is really about technical issues, not bigger questions like why can't the device run Google apps. Still, this is an awesome feature if you a gifting the Fire to someone who is not tech savvy.As expected, the Amazon apps work great. I would like more visual notification to indicate which movies and TV shows that can be downloaded to the device. It should be just as easy to spot as the Prime indicator.The biggest disappointment with the Fire is no Google apps (as of January 1, 2014). This is why I consider the Fire more of a reader and less of a tablet. Without Google apps like Drive, Google Maps; YouTube and the full cadre of Android apps (like Instagram), this device fails to be a really serious workhorse. For those who use Chrome, you never realize how much you depend on it until it's gone. Don't be confused by the Google apps you see in the Amazon Appstore. These are workarounds developed by others; there are no Google apps, developed by Google, in the Appstore. You can sideload some Anddroid apps onto the Kindle (and I have done so for Instagram and PocketBible), but my point is that I shouldn't have to.If Google and Apple can find common ground, I simply don't understand why Amazon has to be so territorial with the Kindle. I'm wondering if this is the same marketing mistake Blackberry made with the Playbook; the marketplace has pretty much decided that we need two mobile operating systems, iOS and Android. I'm sure Amazon will say that developers have the option of putting versions of their apps in the Amazon App Store, but the fact that many haven't says something.Being forced to live without Google apps has forced me to discover a new favorite app -- Feedly, for blog reading. I've downloaded it to my Android and Apple devices.My next biggest issue with the Fire is the Special Offers. (I know I have the option of removing them for $15.) I'm complaining not because they are there, but because they are so 'untargeted' to me. Amazon has more than a decade of my purchasing history, wish lists, web data and tons of my reviews. Serve me ads for stuff you'd think I'd buy. I was expecting Special Offers to be so much better -- as good as recommendations on my Amazon.com homepage. The Special Offers are generally crappy because I have no interest in the products.Update 2/17/14: I have found a bug in the music playlists. I create my playlists on the cloud using my Kindle. I then dowload them to the device. All of the songs are already saved to the device before I download the playlist. However, songs will be missing from the downloaded playlist. The cloud version has 117 songs, the on-device version has three. Mayday and customer support gave me a solution. So, I uninstalled all music from the device and downloaded it all again from the cloud. I then downloaded the cloud playlists and the problem was solved -- for a few hours. Later, when I updated and created new cloud playlists; uninstalled the device playlists; and downloaded the cloud playlists again, songs were missing.Update 3/15,14: After weeks of back and forth, the issue above was resolved with a replacement Kindle. My cloud playlists loaded onto the device without a hitch. I haven't revised the cloud versions and tried to reload onto the device yet; no new songs have caught my ear. I have to say the getting the issue resolved left me very frustrated. Amazon's usually stellar customer service just didn't bring its A-game. I was so relieved when the rep I spoke with a week ago agreed to ship me another device. It took way too long to get to that solution.I find the speed to be slower than my iPhone and Galaxy phone.  I used all three while playing my favorite mobile game via Wi-Fi. When response time matters, I go for the iPhone instead of the Fire.My Fire has a problem connecting to free Wi-Fi. I haven't hit the Mayday button yet to figure out if it's something I'm doing wrong. The device will connect, but it takes a long while for it to tell you that you need to go to the provider's web page to agree to the terms and conditions. Opening the Silk browser yourself to get to the permissions page doesn't always work.I ordered the 16GB version based on other reviewers' comments regarding Prime movie and TV downloads. If I had it to do over again, I would have given more thought to the 32 GB because I have the Wi-Fi version. If I had gotten Wi-Fi+4G, 16 GB would have been just fine because I would have always had the connectivity to stream what I wanted to watch.All in all, the Fire isn't a bad purchase. I think how much you like it depends on what you're used to from other tablets and even your smartphone. It's a good value, but Amazon needs to rethink the relationship with Google. My user experience isn't as rich as it could be without more Android apps.", "Title": "Not Bad, but I Miss Google", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Author": "Hal in Howell", "ReviewID": "R2NDI6FL9MORTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 last Thursday and I am very pleased.  It is SO fast compared to the Kindle Fire HD and lighter, too.  The HDX has a much more responsive touch screen and unmatched screen resolution.  WiFi set up was effortless. I was able to easily set up my various email accounts and download all the apps I used on the old KFHD including Netflix for video streaming (I also have Amazon Prime).  I side-loaded the Dolphin browser in order to view Flash videos (just like on my old HD).  Battery endurance seems very good and have run the HDX several hours at a time (I've not run the battery flat yet and recharge every morning).My only criticism of the HDX is the lack of the HDMI plug (I know, wireless is the future and all that, but I did like having it for travel where wireless video connection is just not available).  I'm holding on to my HD solely for the HDMI functionality.  This complaint is certainly not a deal killer.I've barely used the rear-facing camera (took just one photo to see if it worked and it does and the photo looked very good and I will be using it in the future). The rear-facing camera is a great addition and remedies my major complaint about the KFHD.The only real problem I've encountered with the HDX is that I'm unable to delete photos I downloaded from the Cloud (see updates below).  Enter the Mayday button.  I've got to say that Amazon's customer service is second to none (I guess it's part of their on-going plan for World Domination).  I pressed the Mayday button and I had a live CS person on-line within 15 seconds.  She attempted to fix the photo deletion problem without success.  However, she escalated the issue to a tech support person who, after going through several diagnostic procedures, wrote up a trouble ticket to pass on to the developers; all this taking place on-line (the problem is apparently unique).  A callback is scheduled for later this week.  The whole point of this story is to show how responsive Amazon is to customer problems.  BTW, the photo deletion issue in no way affects the functionality of my Kindle.I read just about all the 1-star reviews before purchasing and found few complaints that were credible (it seems that most of the negative reviews were by iPad fanboys or by those who just didn't know what they were talking about.  I invite you to read those reviews and see for yourself; they are quite entertaining in a perverse sort of way). The Kindle Fire HDX that I own is not the same HDX the 1-star reviewers were talking about.At the end of the day, the KFHDX is a superb device.  It is definitely not just an e-book reader.  I'm still discovering all that it can do.  I highly recommend it.I will update this review with the results of the Kindle problem mentioned above.*********Update January 3, 2014**********Received a callback from Amazon (on-time as promised) regarding the photo deletion problem.  The developers are stumped, but are still working on it.  There is supposed to be a new software update release in the next couple of weeks that may resolve the issue.  If that fails, we may try a factory reset (not my favorite solution as I'll have to reenter all my email settings, etc.).  If the reset fails Amazon will just send me a new device and I'll just start over.  I'm pleased with Amazon's efforts, though disappointed it may require a reset or de-registration or replacement of the Kindle.  At least the problem doesn't affect the Kindle's functionality in any way.  High marks to Amazon CS.  I still love the Kindle.  Further updates will be forthcoming.*********Update January 11, 2014*********I solved the photo deletion issue!  The problem was I was unable to delete photos.  The Kindle kept asking if I wanted to delete the photos from the Cloud (there were no photos on the Cloud).  I solved the problem by asking the Kindle to download the undeleteable (that's not a word, is it) photos from the Cloud even though there were no photos on the Cloud).  I could then delete them.  Apparently the Kindle got locked in some sort of loop and attempting to download non-existent photos broke the loop.  It took me awhile to figure it out, but it worked.  I'll have to let Kindle CS know about this.", "Title": "Definitely A Keeper!", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Author": "KG62", "ReviewID": "R25ZBU5V21KSHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my Christmas present, I love it!

I have had a few stops and starts trying to figure out how to use a full touch screen electronic component. Also navigating the store and my library. Not all my kindle games are compatable with the fire. My review is less from a tech head perspective and more of just a user.I got it and it was automatically registered to my account since I bought it through Amazon. I was thrilled to see I was given some free tokens for audio books and games which I used. (I had a driving trip coming up the following week) The audio book played well through the aux outlet to the car stereo. I could see my pre-exisiting library on the cloud and select the items to download to my fire device. I got a little stuck 2 weeks into ownership trying to access netflix. It doesn't run on the silk browser. So I tried to download firefox which isn't available for Kindle although the app is in the Amazon store. This  ended up with a mayday call by accident (I was just trying to email customer service) and the rep was on video chat in less than a minute and helped me find the netflix app as well as answer another question about my Amazon watchlist navigation. That mayday app is worth the whole cost of the Kindle in my opinion. I have watched a number of videos, the streaming is great, the download aspect worked well. I could hear well, I didn't even feel the need to use headphones. I have shopped through the audio books, bookstore and videos. It has worked well, no complaints.A word of advice. I wavered between getting the 4G Verizon option or just wifi. At home I have wireless for my internet so it would be no issue for the Kindle. But I do travel occaisonally so I was concerned about that. Then I did the math If I bought 4G it is roughly an additional 80.00 on the cost and then I have to add it to my cell phone plan which runs an additional 20-25.00 a month. The I remembered virtually all 3G 4G smartphones have the hotspot capability. This includes mine and was something  I just discovered this year. So I skipped getting 4G. In the 3 weeks I have been out and about I have had to activate the hotspot option on my phone to allow my kindle to hook up and download a paper. It has worked great. It certainly beats the extra cost of getting 4G capable and the monthly plan addition. So think about it when you are buying. I also bought the 89.00 accidental coverage plan. I couldn't find a cover I like right off the bat and I had the previous misfortune with my other Kindle. I recommend buying the insurance. I did find a good cover for a great price if you are not a hardcore road warrior extreme athlete.

It's a great size; thin, light.  The screen is crystal clear and vibrant.  The processor is quick, and everything is snappy.  All that being said, there are two (kind of three) reasons I ended up returning it.1) For me, the biggest thing is the lack of the standard Android play app store.  I know a bunch of other reviews have pointed this out, but I thought I could deal with it.  Honestly, I couldn't.  I use a lot of Google services (gmail, drive, maps, etc.), and none of these are available in the Amazon app store.  Some of it you can do web based, but some of it won't work correctly.  I really wanted to learn to love the Amazon store, but I just couldn't.  Some of my favorite games are not available either.2) I purchased the 'no ad' version, but there are still ads on the tablet.  They are not on the lock screen, but they are under the 'frequently used' app section.  It is SUPER annoying.  \"Oh, we see you like Facebook, but have not downloaded Pinterest.  Click here and download it.\"  No, I don't want to see ads for other apps on my tablet.  It's incredibly obtrusive.  You can click and hold, and then select 'remove ad', but it will come back within 24 hours.  There is no way to get rid of these things.2.5) When using the tablet, every once and a while, the screen would go black while I was actively touching the display.  I hit the mayday button once (awesome service by the way), and they told me to do a hard restart.  That would fix the problem for a good while, but every once and a while, it would need a hard restart again (kind of like a computer).  I wouldn't return the tablet just for this, but it's worth noting.All in all, if you are not a heavy Google user, and don't have favorite apps in your current app store, you would love this tablet.  For me, it just wasn't a great fit.

My screen started to show purple and blue streaks, and after calling support, they agreed to replace it without hesitation (they send a new one and you have 30 days to return the problem unit)-4G performance is very good; pages load almost as fast as with WiFi-Integration with Amazon cloud is well done.  Most of your Amazon music purchases are available, and if you use the Amazon Cloud Player, you can download music from iTunes or most other formatsNeeds improvement:-While Mayday response is very fast, I found there is still a lack of knowledge.  For example, I asked why my magazine subscriptions could not be viewed any longer in text format, and the representative just said they would note that for future reference.  However, purely by accident, I found that all you have to do is double click on the article in the native format and it switches to text.-I find that WiFi needs to be stopped and started occasionally.-There still appears to be a lot of apps that are very buggy.  Read reviews before you download, even if free.-Note that some videos are not downloadable.  I don't find this an issue as the selection is expanding, and I doubt I will ever even scratch the surface of the Prime video library.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet and would recommend it to those that are looking for a media tablet.

I have a Kindle HD 7 inch.  I've not really had complaint with it except occasionally slow/sticking browser etc.  But for watching movies and t.v shows, no problem whatsoever.

Now I realize the 8.9 is larger of course, but the picture is absolutely better on the HDX 8.9,  More light, the colors more bright, crystal clear, awesome!The Silk browser on the HDX is much faster than on the HD.  When I compare the two on the same page of a site, definitely the HDX looks better.  I wasn't expecting such a change with the HDX since I hadn't been unhappy with my HD.I had attached tape along the speakers of the HD to help point the sound toward me. (Don't laugh, they make tapes in lovely colors now!) With the Origami cover on the HDX, it directs the sound from the top, straight to you.  There is a difference without the origami case.....( better sound- with the case.)The sound is loud enough for me, without using an add on speaker.I like the touch buttons on the HDX using the origami case.  You don't have to look, you can tell by feel which is round and which is a rocker type button in case you forget which button is which. So of course, you can also without the origami case.I hope next year Amazon comes out with a 12 inch Kindle Fire HDX with as good of specs and hardware as the HDX.I love, love, love that all I have to do with a Kindle device is- turn it on.  I don't have to register, fill out forms, emails etc.  It's automatically done for you.  I love convenience.  Don't have to remember different passwords or log ons etc.I have  watched and read reviews comparing an Apple device to this Amazon/Android device.  The HDX beats those Apples in almost every way.  Yeah maybe Amazon doesn't have one million apps.  I'm never in my lifetime going to use one million apps, so that 'point' is senseless.I love that I can go camping without internet access available, no 3 or 4 G around, and still watch movies on the KindleHD/HDX!  And now we can download prime movies and shows too!I don't have use for an 'office' type device and am not a big gamer.

So I got  the Kindle HDX- no logging on, no passwords to put in, open the cover swipe and go.Sure laptops have their use, and I still have an older windows version......but that's going to be changing with these tablet computers that are easy to use...Yes we have apple devices.  They are declining in specs but leaving prices high and high for accessories.Don't regret one bit buying the Kindle HDX 8.9 over an apple device.I use a tablet to check weather, surf the internet  and watch movies and t.v.  And the Kindle Fire HDX is excellent for doing all those things.Spouse says- \"it's Awesome, neatest thing since sliced bread\"UPDATE:I did order another 8.9! The picture on this Fire HDX 8.9 is better than on my huge smart tv on some of the shows I watch.  The color and disctinction is better on the HDX. Movies are actually awesome on the Fire HDX and our smart t.v.  But some shows are better on the 8.9.The HDX is so lightweight! Easy to hold with one hand. I use it with and without the origami cover. A pure pleasure. The best picture I've seen on a device and yes I have Fire HD, Apple devices and now HDX (2 of them).  I didn't choose another apple, but I did get another HDX 8.9!I did also upgrade the router to an Asus ac router as well since the HDX has the new 802.11 ac /b/g/n , although I had a good router, we have so many devices we were losing connection on different devices, at different times.  Added more bandwith from the ISP as well.All is smooth now!Also added the origami cover and once again, the sound is better with the origami cover on it as it sends the sound forward to you, instead of up and out...Easy to get the HDX in and out of.  Does add some weight, but it's worth it.Those who try to compare an Apple to an HDX are deceiving people.  the HDX doesn't 'stretch' the screen to make it appear bigger and apple devices do...the old 4.3 instead of the 16.9 format.  HDX is absolutely the better more vibrant, accurate color, better camera by far etc.The old Fire HD still works fine, it's in the laundry room now so I can continue watching while hanging/folding laundry, without having to carry the HDX with me.Is that the sound of someone being spoiled?If your looking for a device for watching and consuming content you can't do better than the HDX.", "Title": "Bought for Spouse", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Author": "J.

The flaw:  Text scaling on websites is terrible....everything is TINY, with lots of white space usually left on the sides.  On some sites this is easily fixed by zooming.  Other sites do not allow zooming and you can't do anything about it.  This is not a function of the screen size...my 2nd generation Nexus 7 and my wifes iPad Mini w/Retina display do not have this issue.  I can't find any way to increase the default scaling.  Sometimes a green \"Reading View\" button pops up on the browser, which opens the page full screen (and scaled properly) and works great.  Unfortunately this option is only available on some pages.The annoyances:  The Silk browser is frustrating.  Some sites behave very strangely, like zillow.com.  The keyboard is terrible compared to the Asus keyboard on my Asus memo pad FHD.  (to be fair this was an issue on the Fire HD 8.9 from last year as well).

Wow!", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Author": "Allan C.", "ReviewID": "R1URUPC7CYUK7B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have noted negative reviews because of certain perceived shortcomings.  The latest selection of available apps in the Kindle App Store more than met my needs.  I was able to find and download every \"Essential\" app I wanted that was recommended on multiple web sites.  I understand that there is a \"middle-man\" web site to get to Google Play apps that have been previously purchased.  Whether all those apps will be HDX compatible is unknown but at least you can get to them.  HDMI out?  Right now there's no adapter cable solution as the HDX just doesn't provide native HDMI streaming but there is Miracast (available here on Amazon and HDX certified) that user reviews when using with the HDX are very positive.  Some issues with using Miracast with other devices but we're talking HDX here.  External storage/PC connectivity?  A microUSB to USB adapter cable works just fine with Windows 7 and I'm sure it would work equally well with an external USB drive or even a USB hub. Don't want to be tethered to a cable?  The are a couple of decent WiFi apps in the App Store that work to provide PC connectivity.  Keyboard too small?  I'm using a Logitech Bluetooth model that hooked up right away.  Charging issue?  Not on mine plus keep in mind that to extend battery life, remember to turn off your WiFi and 4G when you're done using it.  Had to do that with my old original 3G WiFi Kindle too.  I have the AT&T; 4G and really enjoy the abundant and free AT@T hotspots (at least here in the Southeast anyway).  There's a decent Outlook/Hotmail app that I use and although I wasn't happy with the Maps in the Google+ app, when I browse to Google maps via the Silk browser, everything works as I am used to including directions.  Speaking of Silk, I have no issues with it, including speed.  Skype? No problems.  YouTube? Haven't run across any clips that won't play.  I am completely pleased with my HDX and definitely recommend it.  Too bad you can't get the 64GB model if you want the AT&T; 4G LTE but considering that I can have external storage, the tradeoff for the free hotspots balances things out for me. Works great with my Epson WF-3540 wireless printer after getting a printer app from the App Store then downloading a couple of small drivers during setup (just follow the prompts). Final plus for me is that I can read in bed without a light on!  Yes a paperwhite would have been lots cheaper but the HDX has tons of extra capability.Update: Tried to connect to an external USB Hard Drive and that didn't work. That's fair I guess as Windows always installs drivers for whatever I connect via USB (including my HDX which then had full drag and drop capability). The tablet OS doesn't do that so I guess we'll have to wait till Seagate or some other manufacturer comes up with an app to support USB external drives. Until then, I am looking at wireless external drive solutions and have seen several HDX compatible ones on Amazon that I am considering.", "Title": "Very pleased!", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Author": "Snapdragon", "ReviewID": "R2O323U6OFZ2C0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love..Love..my new Kindle fire HDX 8.9.

I was very excited about this purchase and was so much looking forward to this kindle.  One of the main reasons for my purchase was the text to speech and also that the kindle has a camera (where as my apple ipad does not have the text to read, read to me option).The text to speech worked perfectly and i was impressed, as this was better then my earlier kindle from two years ago. However my thrill for the kindle soon disappeared when i tried to make a 30 second \"happy birthday\" message and send this to a relative.  It seems that this is not possible with the kindle (where as the apple ipod, i have made hundreds of 40 to 50 second video messages and sent them to relatives and friends).I figured that i must be doing something wrong. So i used the instant help \"mayday\" (which is nice), once the technician help came on, he told me that the video can not be longer then 30 seconds and this should work fine.  So i made another video that was about 27 seconds, however this did not work.  So i used mayday day, this time the technician told me that it must be less then 25 seconds long.  So again i made another short happy birthday message that was 22 seconds long.  Once again, this video would not send and i used mayday and spoke with a third technician. This technician told me that the video must be less then 20 seconds.  So once again, i made a very short 15 second happy birthday message, and once again, it would not send.  So once again, i used mayday and spoke with a forth technician and i was told to purchase a special app that would allow me to send a video.  So i purchased this app, and once again. It did not work and the app crashed.  So i called amazon and spoke with a supervisor who informed me that he believed that the kindle COULD NOT make any videos longer then 2 or 3 seconds that i would be able to send by email. This supervisor was very kind and informed me that i might be better off returning my kindle fire hdx and just purchasing a kindle fire hd (just for the \"read to me\" option).  So this is what i did (however i really did not want to as i was bored and i wanted to spend the money on a new toy for fun, and i was just looking for any reason to keep the kindle fire hdx and did my best to try to make a video using the camera and send this in a email, like i can do with my apple ipad).I was hoping the kindle fire hdx would be user friendly as much as my apple ipad, however for myself, this was not to be!", "Title": "Tried my best to like the kindle fire hdx", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Author": "Kristina2011", "ReviewID": "R12EIROD0VI18", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I currently own a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2013 edition) and have owned an iPad (2nd gen), Nook Tablet, and Nook Simple Touch in the past. I love my new Kindle Fire HDX because it is remarkably fast. I purchase/rent kindle editions of my textbooks and I noticed a lag when reading them on my other tablets with the Kindle app. This isn\u2019t a problem with the Kindle Fire HDX, thank you quad-core processor! Another reason I wanted a Kindle was for the Immersion reading experience. I use this feature almost everyday. I originally thought I could save some money on audiobooks and just use Read-To-Me but the voice is too robotic and mispronounces words like \u201cisn\u2019t\u201d. The last main reason I wanted to try a Kindle was for the ability to mirror the tablet to a TV screen.It isn\u2019t the best reading experience outside when it is bright but I think it is better than most. It is really lightweight and I never know when it\u2019s in my purse or backpack and the battery life is excellent.I really like Kindle books but unfortunately when I started purchasing e-books I had a Nook so I had a lot of books in the B&N; store that I did not want to repurchase from Amazon. I don\u2019t have that kind of money. I was going to return the Kindle Fire HDX but changed my mind when I found a way to get the Nook app on my Kindle. I am still disappointed in Amazon because they made it challenging. You can\u2019t personalize the background on the lock screen and that is also something I really don\u2019t like. I originally saved $15 by purchasing the Kindle with special offers but the ads were too annoying so I decided to pay the extra money to get rid of them. Unfortunately the default backgrounds are not a lot better to look at.I would suggest doing research before deciding to purchase a Kindle Fire. If you want a tablet and don\u2019t already have one, the Kindle Fire will probably not be good enough for you. If you have a lot of digital purchases from amazon (books, audiobooks, video) and want a simple tablet/e-reader, this will probably be a good investment for you.

This is unacceptable and bad business.  Don't let the scripted customer service rep read you some spiel about your ISP and WIFI to try and pass the buck.  I build computers and am very tech savvy.  I am also street smart and know when someone is trying to hustle me.  The good part is i paid for this lemon with the Amazon store card.  That means that Amazon is going to have to keep sending me a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 whether its refurbished or out of a trash bin at their warehouse for as long as i have a balance on their card.Rest assured that in the end i will get my moneys worth one way or the other as i am in no hurry to pay off this card.  When the 1 year warranty expires and you are still sending me refurbished junk, make sure that you keep doing it without charging me because at this point it will be YOU/AMAZON that ends up getting screwed, not this consumer.", "Title": "Buyer Beware", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Author": "Russell D.

So, this device support translate books as well as read those books to us. One the other, hand the price much cheaper as we getting a huge benefit from it. Yesterday I did a test for this device on it battery. Then, I got this results ,, I got 40 percent to charge the battery on 78 minutes = 100 percent on 3 hours and 25 minutes. In addition, it stay work not less then 11 hours reading with leasing. This device support education much and much, so I recommend for those who intereste to get the education in an advance way. Very good idea when you get a kindle fire which a large company like Amazon stand behind it. Amazon much familiar with online bookstore as the first in this field in the world,, . In this time Amazon represents a biggest market in the world which you can access on it in your small device like kindle. Finally, kindle fire HDX more greater then I thought about it before I bought it.

Also the slide the tablet out of the Origami case to expose the camera thing is more cute than usefull.Second screen, only for Samsung tvs and PS/3s Not exactly a wide market.Miracast: The device they recommend for the kindle  has only a 3 out of 5 star rating and costs $59, and then you still have to have an hdmi cable from it to the TV. I haven't got up the guts to risk it yet. I would've rather they kept the hardware port.Display: Gorgeous.Processor: Fast.

It sits at a kind of cock-eyed angle, sort of pointed up. I feel like I'm breaking it every time I plug it in to charge. Not a big deal at all! Just be kind of careful.ALSO! I'd recommend getting rid of the special offers. (which you can do at anytime, for $15 plus tax) I felt like it really drained my battery very quickly. Again, just a personal opinion. My original opinion stands, that this is the best tablet you can get for the money, and really is the best tablet I have ever used.----------UPDATE #2----------Finally having issues at a little under three months, I knew such an amazing device has to have a flaw.

It freaked out while scrolling, arbitrarily zooming in an out of pictures on twitter and Facebook. While reading, it would highlight words and navigate me all through the reading menus and stuff. It was exhausting. I did a factory reset last night, thinking it was something I downloaded. This did not resolve the issue. So I called Amazon Customer Service today for help. Within 5 minutes, after explaining my problem, they offered to replace my device, which will be here by Saturday, 03/15. I am docking one star, because Customer Service does not attest to the quality of the device. I haven't dropped my Kindle a single time in 3 months, it's barely even been out of my house. These issues were just out of the blue and random.Other than this issue, the device was great and I'm really looking forward to my replacement and jumping back into my books and tv shows :D", "Title": "Wonderful, with one tiny issue.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "Shorian \"gadget guru\"", "ReviewID": "R23PPSPT8GGAUN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kudos to Amazon for quarterly installment payments on the Kindle.

The HDX is a tremendous improvement over the older model in nearly every aspect. The display is brighter and clearer. Performance is very snappy. Setup was easy. I use MS Outlook for my email and all I had to do was provide my password. The Kindle app handled all the server setup automatically.I love the dual cameras, especially the new rear facing one. It has an LED flash and image stabilization, a great improvement. I also love the new voice recognition feature. I use this feature all the time on my Nexus 7 to dictate email and do searches. This helps someone like myself who has arthritis. For me, this was the main selling point.I haven't needed the new live help yet, but I am curious how well it works. I know I will eventually try it to satisfy my curiosity.Games and video play very smoothly, unlike the previous model that tended to freeze up at times.

Prior to that I didn't have much use for tablets but this one has changed my mind and become part of my daily routine.First, the audio/visual side of it works very well for me. Obviously the HD display creates very sharp images and video playback runs smoothly, looks excellent (with a high-quality source), and I have had no complaints about the sound. I added the origami case and while some people say the design doesn't really affect the sound, I do think it improves it slightly by helping redirect it back toward you just a bit. Even without it, you can hear everything just fine.I can't really get into all the deeper details about how the tablet itself works except to say navigation is simple and easy for me. The carousel is a snap to customize as far as showing what you want on it with the rest of your apps elsewhere.I mostly use the tablet for e-books, some games, and Amazon Prime videos. I've also propped the tablet up in the kitchen to follow a recipe without having to print something out or go back to the CPU to double-check something.  I have always been a traditionalist when it comes to reading, preferring the physical feel of a book in my hands, but having it on a tablet compared to a smaller device has made me change my mind.  It's probably a standard option, but I also prefer being able to set it as white text on a black background since my eyes are a little more sensitive to bright things than usual.  It just helps keep them from getting strained.A major selling point of the device is the ability to watch video through Amazon Prime.  The simple fact of the matter is you aren't going to maximize the potential of the Kindle Fire without it, because it opens up a ton of viewing options when it comes to movies and TV shows.Not everything is free through the instant video service, of course, but there's still a whole lot of stuff you can access that way.  You just have to see what the options are for each film or show.  Some allow you to download directly to the device while others don't.This should be showing up in the right place, but I bought the 64 GB version, wifi only, because for the most part it's an at-home device.  When I thought about what I pay for home internet vs. what I'd probably be paying to stream or download over a 4G connection, it made more sense for me to get the wifi-only version and live with knowing that if I'm going to take a vacation or otherwise be out of town, I'd have to either download stuff directly to the tablet before I go or hope to have a wifi signal somewhere.As an example, I took an overnight trip out of town and even though I stayed at a place with wifi, I didn't bother getting it.  I just downloaded a few episodes of a TV show to watch and that was that.  I also took a two-day train ride that did not have wifi, and I was able to watch an entire season of a TV show during the trip.  The HD episodes took up about 3 GB each so I came pretty close to maxing out the storage capacity, but as soon as I finished watching an episode I just deleted it.Be aware that once you start watching a show or movie you've downloaded, if you're not connected you have 48 hours to \"verify\" things again or you won't be able to watch that particular download until you do.  This is really a great feature of the device, since you can actually watch downloaded stuff while being completely offline for a bit.  It made the train trip extremely convenient, and I also got through most of two e-books by the end of it as well.I find the battery life to be pretty much as advertised.  It holds up well even when watching a few videos in succession, though I often charge it when I'm not using it.The camera gives a good enough image, but the examples I've taken with it seemed to have a bit of a contrast issue compared to my smartphone or the actual camera I have.  I'm not the kind of person to go around taking pictures or video with a tablet anyway, so it's not a big deal to me.  The camera itself was hardly a factor in what I decided to get.One small criticism I have is probably not a device-specific thing, but it does bear mentioning.  I have it set to automatically update my apps, though from time to time an app will prompt me to update and send me to the appstore only for there to be no \"update\" option.  On a few occasions, I've had to uninstall then reinstall the app in order for the update to register.  The last couple weeks, at least, apps I had that problem with seem to have auto-updated fine, so this may be fixed.By the way, if you're concerned about the \"special offers\" being intrusive or anything like that, they're not. When you access the device, they're no more than a displayed ad that goes away when you unlock the device, and you're on to what you want to do.  there's a tab at the top of the home screen to view all offers if you want to.  You can also spend $15 (I think) if you want to have them removed, so you're not stuck with them if you originally buy a device that comes with them.Overall, for what I got the tablet for, it meets or exceeds my needs.

I let them know my need and they said they were working on it, but it was never available for anything I wanted to watch, so I cancelled. It has been hard for me to use the Amazon Prime Movie downloads on my TV. I have to run it through my laptop into my TV and Prime downloads didn't show closed captioning.

My grandson is in the Marines and stationed back in Missouri, and we play Subway surfer together.A little bit about 4G LTE, mine is through Verizon, and it was suppose to be $30.00 a month rather you use it or not. I got signed up with them and they pulled the 30.00 out of my account, 2 weeks later I received a bill from them for a whopping $175.00, with no mention of the 30.00 I already paid, with a bunch of BOGUS TRUMPED UP FEES, so be Leary.Most of the games are about extracting money out of your bank account, but there are some good ones you can play without having to pay more money.If you are a previous Kindle owner, all your games and information is transferred to your new Kindle, and you will find them on the cloud. You will just have to click on the cloud, and then click on what you want and it will download it right onto your new Kindle. It downloaded all my games, apps, and my book purchases, so you don't have to re-purchase them. I use my pinterest a lot on my new Kindle. I have 5 different emails, for various reasons, and thru the Kindle I have all of my email accounts at my fingertips.I forked out over a thousand dollars for the Ipad, and I was not impressed, and it is not ADHD FRIENDLY.

My complaint is that the calendar app that is included can't be even used if you have your email account with AOL. That, it appears, is due to the fact that it is not written in a way to allow the calendar app to sync with AOL. I learned this by using the Mayday button and going through about three reps before one that understood the problem could explain it. He stated that you had to have certain email accounts (ie. Gmail, yahoo etc in order for the app to sync.) Why in the world would you write an app like that? He further stated that there were many other calendar apps availabe that did not need to sync with your email. Supposedly that's a satisfactory answer. I think not as it eludes the question of why did you write the software that way? Dumb!By the way, some have written this is an iPad killer.

But a friend of mine got one and really liked it, and he owns about 15 tablets as well as develops roms for many of them.  So along with the offer to pay in installments, I decided to give it a try.First thing is the amazing light weight, and thinness.  It almost feels like it's going to break, it's so thin.  But it hasn't(yet :) ).  The power and volume buttons being on the rear take a little getting used to, but it feels pretty good once you use it a while.The screen, of course, is tremendous, with the high resolution.  And colors are very bright, as well.  In operation, the speed of the UI is quite good, I haven't really noticed any lag.  Apps load quickly, and games like Asphalt 8 and Modern Combat 4 play effortlessly.Not everything is perfect, of course.  Three things in particular i wish were different.  First, lack of an sd card slot is a con, although with the 32gb version I have, storage isn't a problem so far.  But if you had a lot of movies, normally you could play them off an sd card.  Of course Amazon wants you to use the cloud, but what about if you can't connect to wifi?  For me it's not a big deal but I can see it being so for some users.The second item is no HDMI out port.  Sure, it can use Miracast, but if you don't have a Miracast enabled tv, then you have to get an adapter, and they're not cheap.  This bothers me more than no sd card slot, but again, i have a couple other tablets with HDMI out, so not a deal breaker.Lastly, no Google Play store.  While I thought this would be really bad, the Amazon app store isn't totally lacking in good apps.  Also, you can enable adb, and sideload apps easily enough.  Unless an app needs to download additional content, everything pretty much will work.Overall I find myself satisfied with the device, it's super-fast, the screen is brilliant, and the UI is actually pretty good, with the carousel.  If you're already in the Amazon ecosystem, it's much easier to get more out of the tablet.

I only wish more of the books I like were available in Kindle format.I purchased a cover/stand from another manufacturer at a computer store. So far I'm happy with it and I got what I paid for. My Kindle is well protected and I can prop it in a comfortable position horizontally for reading and viewing.The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" also comes complete with TWO cameras.

With the help of some Christmas money from parents and grandparents she was able to get this nice 8.9\" Kindle Fire HDX. She struggled with the decision, however, and did a lot of comparison shopping. She looked at reviews of both the iPad Mini (comparable in price to this device) and this Kindle Fire. She had to get the 8.9 to get the camera on both sides, which she wanted and the iPad mini has. The iPad mini was winning in her estimation and research, but what made her choose the Kindle was that she'd already spent so much time and energy over the many years of owning the Kindle Fire, advancing in her games and purchasing coins. I asked Help if everything from her Kindle Fire would transfer to the new Kindle Fire HDX and they said yes and failed to note exceptions to this. After getting the new device there ARE exceptions to this and they include your standings in Apps you already own and your coins. What? The whole reason she chose the Kindle Fire over the iPad mini. Two things happened to help her NOT return the Kindle, the help desk was helpful and worked hard to make things \"right\" for her on the new Kindle and she really does like the \"feel\" of this new Kindle. The HDX is light, easy to hold and does not \"accidentally\" touch the screen when you are playing games, which is something she notices a lot on her friends iPad Mini. We have had one situation of a frozen screen and we will keep an eye on this over the next couple of weeks to see if it happens again. Hopefully, no. The Help desk is easily accessible, however, and responsive so if the screen freezes again we will hopefully get some help and be able to fix it rather than have to exchange the Kindle.

I did a bit of research on the different kinds of tablets available and most guides I read suggested considering a variation of this question.  I use my tablet primarily for media consumption.  My primary concern was picking a tablet that streamed videos through my Amazon Prime account. This left me with two choices: the Kindle Fire HDX or an iPad.  I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 over the iPad Air because I could get the 64 GB Kindle for less than a 16 GB iPad Air.  I was also disappointed with the letter boxing on the iPad Air when it played HD movies.  While the Kindle has a smaller screen than the iPad Air, it has a bigger picture when watching movies than the iPad.  Perhaps the iPad uses more of the screen when playing TV shows and older movies, I don't know, but it only uses a portion of the screen when playing newer movies in HD.  The Kindle Fire HDX uses the entire screen when playing HD movies.  I regularly use Netflix, Amazon streaming, and Hulu Plus and have no complaints with the HDX's performance on this front.  The speakers are more than adequate for watching movies and listening to music.  I have no experience with other tablet speakers so I can't make a comparison, but the HDX speakers are well placed, clear, loud, and don't sound tinny.  Reading on the HDX is very easy.  I have the Nook, Aldiko, Moon+ Reader, and Comixology apps, and of course the Kindle App is pre-loaded on the HDX.  The HDX is quite light and easy to hold, in either portrait or landscape mode, for extended periods of time.  I'm very happy with the battery life as well.  I get 13 hours on a full charge.  On weekdays, after work, I can use the HDX for two days in a row before I have to think about plugging it in.  On weekends the tablet will last an entire day of almost constant use before needing to be charged.  I've only ran the battery down to 0% once, and I think it took a little over six hours to reach 100%.The biggest problem with the Kindle Fire HDX is the app store.  Since the Kindle Fires are closed off from the Google Play store I thought Amazon would focus on quality over quantity with regards to apps offered, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  There seems to be an abundance of cheap, poorly designed apps and a noticeable absence of certain popular apps.  The 1Mobile Market rectifies this a bit, but I still find the absence of some popular apps in the Amazon app store curious.  I would like a Google Drive app, but have to settle with accessing it through the browser.  With a little bit of research, I've found workarounds for most problems, but it's annoying to not have simple, direct access to apps other tablets have.  I'm also not a big fan of the carousel on the home screen, but I suppose some people may prefer it.The Kindle Fire HDX has some real limitations, but on the whole I am happy with my purchase.  If you want to use your tablet for work, you may want to do some more research to make sure the Kindle Fire will do want you need.

The carousel interface is kind of neat, but more often gets in the way of finding the content you want to use at than assists in it.  That it tries very hard to direct you into purchasing new things rather than letting you get to things you have already bought and now want to use just makes it worse.  While some of the features can't be had anywhere else due to Amazon licensing terms (and the only reason this isn't getting 1 star) you know who you are if you want these.While I'll agree that a media player needs a nice screen, and this certainly has it, the problem is that the rest of its' technical specs are complete overkill for the job at hand.  You simply don't need quad-core, dedicated graphics, or massive internal storage if all you're going to be doing is reading books offline and streaming movies.  And boy, do they want you to stream over downloading.This is even further hampered by several bizarre decisions in the design.  Rear-facing speakers make it difficult to hear the thing even in relatively quiet environments without turning it up to the point where you will bother other people.  The keyboard and dictionary features are weak compared to Google's and Apple's offerings, making the touchscreen keyboard a pain to use effectively.  And the internal power management means that it often can't take advantage of the increased battery life - playing an HD movie drains the battery FASTER than a power cable can supply it.The Amazon app store is a complete joke.  My last tablet was an HP Touchpad, and before I installed Cyanogenmod the app store for THAT had easier, cheaper access to needed features.  When compared to Google Play and iTunes you just have to laugh.If all you're looking for is a cheap way to get access to Amazon content, consider the Kindle Fire HD - at over 200 bucks cheaper the minimal loss of resolution is probably justified, and you can actually connect that directly to an HDTV instead of needing an expensive new wireless setup of questionable utility (another strike against the HDX).  If you want a full-featured tablet, look at the iPad Air or one of the new KitKat-based Android tablets that should be coming out soon.Only buy the HDX if you seriously can't live without the ability to download a small subset of Prime-access videos.", "Title": "Enthusiasts AVOID!", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Author": "Don Weber", "ReviewID": "RXFMR02FA0L9V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very nicely done product, but not quite as intuitive as the iPad.

First of all, for a premium tablet, the Kindle Fire doesn't have GPS.  Secondly, you are SEVERELY limited in what you can do with this tablet.  Amazon really only wants you to use for reading their books and watching their movies.  They realized that they couldn't sell a tablet without games, so have a limited set of games available.  This is NOT an Android tablet.  Amazon took the Android operating system and seriously customized it, removing the ability to use any browser other than the one they wrote (at least one if not ore generations behind current Chrome, Firefox, or Opera), you can't use the Google Play Store, you have to use Amazon's store, which doesn't have near the variety of apps.All in all, it is disappointing that Amazon advertises this as an iPad competitor, when it is so ridiculously limited.**Update** based on a comment, I will be more accurate and say that you can't run a browser other than Silk without sideloading it...in other words, you cannot download another browser from the Amazon App Store, you have to change a setting to allow loading apps from unknown sources, then load the browser apk file from another website or device...something that many folks that aren't tech-savvy will not want to do.My assessment still stands as-is...great hw (except missing GPS) but overly restrictive, modified OS.**Update** after using it for several months now, I bumped it up to 4 stars because I find that I do very little with it outside of reading and watching videos of my granddaughter.  For that, it is performing admirably.

As when PPI gets above what Apple calls a retina screen, my peepers cannot tell the difference).  So don't worry about the screen, either tablet presents what is being displayed in a gloriously bright and clear manner.One item that I do wish Apple had included (In an aesthetically pleasant way, of course) is a microSD slot which would allow quick transfers of data without an additional dongle that plugs into the Lightning port.  The kindle provides this out of the box.The OS that is installed on the Kindle is what is irks me the most of all and is the reason I wouldn't suggest the purchase over an iPad Air.  The kindle has an obvious purpose here and it has become overtly advertised with the discounted kindles like the Fire HDX that ruins the feel that you are getting a premium product; \"Special Offers!\" Once you realize what Amazon's true goal of the Kindle Fire is; to try to sell you more products from Amazon based upon what you do with your tablet, or should I call it their tablet as you are losing your privacy from where you are when you do whatever it is that you do with that* kindle.This is a deal breaker to me as I know how iOS on the iPad Air was designed and who it was designed for; the business sector and Apple users that think like the designers.  The iOS operating system is very detailed about when it is going to provide personally identifiable information to an application regardless of developer (Apple or any other).  Apple also does not let out any applications that attempt to gain user information without absolute transparency and asking first.  This walled garden is something that cannot have a price attached to it.With the Kindle HDX, you are paying for a device that is letting a company know what you are doing with their tablet at all times. When you consider this factor in the pricing hype over the Kindle HDX you would not be alone to wonder what they are paying you to use their tablet over a protected Apple iPad Air. (I cannot stop thinking of this tablet like those free* internet providers that  were around a few years back as well as those companies that used to give you a free computer that used these same targeted advertising techniques Amazon has rediscovered and deployed with the Kindle HDX).I expect Amazon to keep information on what I search their site for and what I purchase from them.  But this is where I feel our relationship should stop.  If you are comfortable with this information keeping aspect of the Kindle Fire and the absence of a large, tested and safe marketplace of applications and add-ons from tripod mounts to microphones to lens attachments and more.  The Kindle Fire HDX might be good for you. Be sure to try one out first at a Best Buy where you can compare it to the iPad Air.I will continue to use my regular Paperwhite Kindle, to read eBooks.  This is one thing the Kindle Fire can't do, surprisingly.  But to get that paper-like look you need an eINK display not a high resolution one like the Kindle Fire HDX and the iPad Air have.For my peace of mind, I am going to return the one I purchased to the store and stomach the slightly higher price of the iPad Air.

Uncertain as to why as my other wireless devices were working just fine from the same location and only a few feet from the wireless router. I've read other reviews where this was a problem.

Nope. None of these are easily available on the Kindle Fire.I will give the Fire high marks as a playback device. If you download content in its highest resolution, it looks and sounds fantastic.

The IPad was okay, and it did the job, but it had its issues; kind of iffy WiFi reception (even in my house), problems playing certain types of videos that required flash player, etc.  I did a fair amount of research, for a layperson, read lots of reviews, and decided to purchase this tablet instead of going for a laptop.  My main reason for doing so was portability; so much easier transporting a tablet.  I really needed something to access work sites from home, do professional reading, casual reading, watch a movie here and there, play a game.The first thing that I noticed was that the graphics were amazing. Crisp, clear pictures; clean lines, really gorgeous.  WiFi reception was much improved within my house, pages loaded faster than the IPad, so far so good.  Then I began running into some snags.  Amazon doesn't have the app we use for our company email (First Class), which was available on the IPad.  I am able to enter using a browser, but the site does not function as well.  I tried to access another company website and was met with \"Error 500\" codes when trying to login; again, not a problem I had on the IPad.  This one hurt, because I actually had to get in to do some work, so I had to kick my 15 year old off of his desktop to get into our company website (that was enjoyable for both of us).I did play one puzzle game and it was great-no hangups or lags; same with watching a movie.  I wish I could say that everything went well in this area, but I also ran into some snags.  Some games aren't available for the HDX, only the non-HDX versions of the Kindle, but are advertised by Amazon as \"Available for Kindle\".  It gets frustrating when you think you've found something, only to find its a non-compatible version.  If you go looking for games on popular sites like Big Fish or Google Play, you notice how far behind in the market Android is compared to IPad (I was schooled by a 7-year old in a rather know-it-all tone).So, is the Kindle the end-all-be-all?

However, most apps were available through the Amazon App store.  Other things, like Google Maps, was available in it's full version using the Silk browser, which is really fast as well.

Connecting to my WiFi was simple and without problems.  Adding the device to my existing Verizon account did require my calling Verizon's tech support, but that's probably because I live out from town and wasn't getting a strong enough signal.  However, Verizon tech support was very helpful and quickly resolved the problem.  There was also a glitch connecting to my email account on my ISP, but that seems to have been a problem at their end, and has been resolved.  Connecting to my Gmail account was seamless.I've found the frequent complaint of not enough apps (compared to as standard Android) to be a non issue for me.  I've had no problem finding the apps I need and want, or acceptable replacements in cases where the ones I'm use to aren't available.It would be nice if the HDX came with Google maps/navigator installed, but I have that on my phone, so it's not a big issue.  Besides Map Quest maps/navigation is free at the Kindle app store.  It may not be quite up to Google maps, but then again, maybe it is.  I really haven't an opportunity to try it yet.All in all, I'm pleased with my device, and I'm giving it 4 stars only because I've only had it for one day.=======================  Comments added on 2/27/2014 ==================================================I'm now two weeks into owning my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 (Verizon), and I've added another star to my rating to make it a 5-star rating.  I stand by all my comments above, and would like to add that I find the management and use of my Kindle library so much easier with this tablet than with my old (Gen. 3, I think) Kindle.  With this device I get to see the cover of the book I'm reading each time I open it on the carrousel, so I can remember the name of the book I'm reading.  On my old Kindle, I usually only saw the title and author when I first started reading and quickly forgot both (hey, I'm 70 years old).I've installed Waze navigation app, and it works very well - not that I will use my tablet often for navigation, but it's nice to have.Like most, if not all, Android based tablets, it doesn't get as strong a 4G or 3G signal as my Android phone, but I'm usually connected to WiFi, so that's not particularly important to me, which I'm sure begs the question of why did I buy a 4G model to begin with.  The answer is simple - I wanted to.All in all I find the Kindle Fire HDX far superior to my wife's Android tablet, and I'm very pleased with it.
