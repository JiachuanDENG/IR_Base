I removed most apps and re-installed them selectively and now have much improved battery life.  I can easily get through two to three days of moderate usage.--------------------I've tried many Android tablets, but I think this is the best yet!  The Thrive 10 doesn't boast any features that aren't found in other tablets, but it's well designed.  The software isn't intrusive and hardware seems solid.  Fortunately, I haven't had any light leak problems others have stated.  I've watched dark movies and shows (Game of Thrones) and couldn't find anything that bugged me.One of the best features for me is the full sized SD card slot.  I honestly wasn't expecting to use it as much as I did, but it's easily my favorite feature. Full sized cards are readily available and extremely cheap nowadays,  bought a cheapo 16gb class 10 card for ten bucks.  Stick card in computer, drag n' drop video files, stick card in tablet.  Boom.  So much better than fiddling with cables in my opinion.I'll skip reviewing most the hardware components since others have adequately covered that.  But I must say, the battery life is not stellar.  From less than an hour of browsing and writing this review, I'm down to 80% battery life.  There is an option in the settings window, \"Enable balanced power\".  I'll enable that on a full charge tomorrow and see if it fares any better.If you're an Android guy/gal, this is probably the best tablet you'll find right now.Have used:Asus Transformer OGSony Tablet SAcer ...uh.. forgot model #.

Torres PR \"drew torres\"", "ReviewID": "R6PGP39NFD6AL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Product is a cream of the crop in Tablet products in My opinion. I am an extreme fanatic of Android but I give honest reviews in regards to its hardware and the softwares limitation if its crappy or Good. Had to replace my Toshiba Thrive at Bestbuy and they gave me this in return.Hardware: Beautiful metal finish in the back. Its so damn sleek its crazy. Its lighter then the Toshiba Thrive and that was a beastly tablet but with tons of grip. The Excite on the other hand is a tablet at risk of breaking badly. Be sure to protect any tablet or keep them away from children if you value the iPads and Android's you use. Thinness is the number one thing you notice, and the box itself, it comes in, says your in for sight to behold. Next issue...Light Leaks, on my model I have not experienced that and is well built. Light leaks are issues that vary from tablet to tablet and smartphone to smartphone. Mostly an issue with production down the manufacturing line. Camera is better then thrive for sure but nothing like the Camera's on the latest phones. I dont find it convenient to take pictures in public with tablet cameras in the first place. Front camera is ten times clearer then my Evo 4G, but the smartphone & tab industry has a way to go before those front facers are good. Its charging connector is the most akward decision I've ever seen for charging. It is, in my opinion, extremely slow at charging. Hardware holds a long Charge if not in heavy use. I have not thoroughly tested or created any metric on how to test and give a good review. Its hardware buttons are nearly flush with the device so you will get confused at first on which side you need to activate the screen. Running at Tegra 3 Processor is a god send and here is why:Software: The tegra 3 is Invidia's newest baby unveiled to the world this year. This thing is Fast and Pushes Android 4.0 to Lagless limits. Swiping on Homescreens is effortless and smooth. You can tell the software was well built around the hardware. Gaming on this is incredible and handles the new \"Dead Trigger\" game and its graphics extremely well. Im sure \"Shadowgun\" and other High res games would work exceptionally well. It is a tablet loaded with minimal bloatware, and is as clean a build of ICS this is gonna be. Any cleaner requires the Device to be rooted. Those who are experiencing lag on software and transitions obviously have a device with a combo of software and hardware issues. Suggest that you return immediately. Now those experiencing software issues and hoping to root or knowledgeable in Rooting are in for a dead stop. We can not do JACK! A look thru some online forums show that Toshiba has heavily locked down this tablet. A rom developer ive been following has been unable to root this thing or do custom roms. This is going to be a deal breaker for our more developer heavy consumers.Warning: Now if you do recieve this device and are looking to break into it with a temporary root method then it is possible, as long as you DO NOT DOWNLOAD the OTA update available for download. Search on google and type \"Thrive forums\"...developer name is Dalep.Netflix'n, Youtube'n, and all your favorite stuff are there for you to use. So no video limitations at this time. We will see as future versions of Android try and find a way to get flash content to work considering Adobe has stopped support.Conclusion: In my run through of this tablet I can say the average tablet user is going to enjoy this device. It runs smooth, fast, and lots of space depending on the GB model you buy. Android 4.0 blows Honeycomb 3.1 & 3.2 out the water. Will they support this product with future versions of android? I dont know. At this point Toshiba has been unable to provide a android 4.0 to the toshiba thrives and Custom Rom development seems locked down heavily. I wouldnt bank on toshiba providing a timely update to this device. Its specs more then deserve an upgrade to Android 4.1 but we can only hope. For the heavy modders STAY AWAY...Average consumer GO FOR IT.", "Title": "One of the Great Tablets out.

Yeah, YouTube didn't work at all. not on the app that came preloaded on the tab, not through any of the 3 web browsers that I tried, and not the app downloaded from the Play Store. Sorry folks, if you like YouTube this won't work for you. Some other programs had minor problems with randomly crashing. couldn't figure out why. Maybe ICS isn't ready yet, and maybe it's Toshiba's fault.Build quality:Has a nice balanced feel to it, it seems a little heavy when compared to an iPad. I especially liked the textured back, which gives a good grip when holding it one-handed. Both cameras are well placed. The chassis has a lot more flex in it than I was expecting, but no creaky crunchy sounds, so it really does seem to be substantial.Screen:I had light bleed like a lot of others, but only noticed it when starting apps, and wasn't really noticeable any other times. Yeah, the screen is really bright, probably twice as bright as my laptop screen. The auto brightness was terrible when viewing in the dark, as it would detect the light changes from whatever the screen is displaying, and would pulse from light to dark. It has good resolution, and while not as amazing as Apple's retina display, it was pretty close.Camera:The camera had quite a lot of graininess when taking pictures in low light (pretty much like the iPad), but took really good pictures in higher light (much better than the iPad).OS:I really like the layout of Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, but some of the programs that I thought would be a sure thing (like YouTube) just didn't work. don't know if that is ICS or Toshiba.Battery life:a lot worse than I expected. I fully charged it, used it for about 3-4 hours changing settings, downloading/installing programs, and some light web browsing. Battery was down to 42%. Put it in stand-by and went to bed. 7 hours later when I woke up, I tried to check the weather for the day, and the battery was dead, so I charged it while at work, same thing next day.Overall:The problems with the light bleed, YouTube plain not working, and programs crashing lead me to return it. Sorry Toshiba, but for a full price device you only provided a half-baked experience. I'll probably be buying a Samsung or Motorola when they finally have a quad-core tablet.", "Title": "It didn't work like a $450 device should", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Author": "T2000KW", "ReviewID": "R12QI3WDQ0JSUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet from Eritech International Inc., who was very responsive to a couple of questions I had. The tablet is great. It has the Nvidia Tegra 4-core processor with a 5th core for battery-saving low-power operation (probably during standby mode).It has the same processor speed as the Samsung Galaxy tab 10 but double the number of cores (actually 2.5 x). The 32 GB or internal data storage means that I probably won't run out of room on the internal SD card like I did with the 8 GB internal storage on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.This has all the outputs that I'll likely need, including a mini-HDMI output. Yes, you can hook this up to a TV through it's HDMI port connection.I purchased a factory refurbished model and saved about $130 over a new one and it arrived in like-new condition. I can't tell that it had ever been used before. The nice thing about a refurbished product is that whatever went wrong has been fixed and the unit is more thoroughly tested than on a regular assembly line during initial production. Sometimes a refurbished product will have better components to address a weakness in the original design. Whatever the case was with this Excite model, it works fine now and has not given me an ounce of trouble.At this time, I don't think you can beat the value of this model in  refurbished condition. Eritech International Inc. actually opens the factory sealed box and re-tests these units once more before sending them to their customers, an added bonus to me since i had purchased a used one of these through Amazon Warehouse Deals and got a bad one (remember, it wasn't refurbished, just used). I returned it for a refund and ordered this one right away.The only downside (and it's a minor one that's not a showstopper) is that the docking/charging cradle is hard to find and those that you can find are not cheap. While there are plenty of those for the previous model, the Toshiba Thrive (which we also have and love), and at a very low price ($10 to $15 with the power supply and dock and sometimes with other accessories also), this is not the case for the Excite. My guess is that Toshiba overestimated the demand for these when they made the Thrive and that's why there are so many available on the deal-a-day web sites and the big online auction site. Then, they decides to make very few for the Excite so as to not waste money producing something that there was little market demand for.While I do have a couple of docking cradles for the Thrive we have, we haven't used either of them, so it's not an important item to me. However, if they suddenly showed up on those sites at a low price I would probably buy one or two.In my opinion, I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for an Android tablet. It comes with Android 4.0 (or will update to it for free if it comes with the previous version) and is fairly fast at doing what it needs to do for you. If you see Eritech International Inc. selling one here, grab it. They don't sell these here continuously, so if it's here, it likely won't be tomorrow. If another vendor sells a refurbished Thrive, just check the vendor reviews before you decide. With a refurbished model, you get a 90 day warranty through Toshiba and likely have a 30 day return option through Amazon or the vendor.", "Title": "Great tablet, great vendor", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "E.

I didn't want to go down to a 7\" tablet so wanted a 10\". Since ratings of this and the similarly priced Asus and Acer were similar, the $50 difference on Amazon edged me to the Excite. I have had it bout 3 weeks now and feel I know enough about it to write this recommendation.I found it easy to use right out of the box and had my favorite apps loaded in no time. I'm pleased with the speed chairlift of the display. The only time I ever see the light bleed on the edges is when the tablet a booting up, so that has been a non-issue for me.I actually don't mind the larger charger connection as this is what caused my vtab to be replaced - the mini USB charger wouldn't make a good connection anymore. This feels very solid.My only issue has been the battery draining overnight as the user manual recommends just putting the tablet to sleep and not powering down to extend battery life. I have found the solution to be putting the tablet in airplane mode.  No more drained battery!For me, the battery life in between charges has been good - probably averaging around 9 hours depending on what I'm doing that day. I'm not a heavy gamer or video watcher, mostly internet and some \" light\" games like words with friends.I really like the notification bar. The notifications are large enough and last long enough to see what they are and then the icon stays in the notification bar so I always know what apps need attention without opening them to see if I have a new message or whatever.Another thing that has worked way better than my last tablet is watching the HD video I took on vacation this summer. On the vtab I could only watch bits and pieces with no audio at all. On the Excite they play perfectly beginning to end.The preloaded apps are kind of annoying as I don't use most of them and they can't deleted,but since there is no limitation on the space you have for apps, this isn't really a big issue. That was a nice surprise on this tablet as I had very limited space for apps on the old tablet and was always deleting to make more room for new apps.Once I solved the overnight battery drain problem, I am 100% happy with the Excite.

It won't take the very first update from back in June, let alone the new Jelly Bean. I got my wife a Nexus 7 for Christmas, and that operating system is beautiful. ICS is nice, but I have done a factory reset, as well as reset from recovery mode, about 5 to 7 times. Each time I went straight to the upgrade screen (Toshiba's fairly useless and ill-named \"service station\"), and each time the very first minor download will install (I assume they have to be done in order), so my system doesn't \"see\" the Jelly Bean update.Toshiba customer support is non-existent. I've been on the forums, and what I've learned is that (1) Toshiba tech support (a telemarketer in India) will tell you to do all the things I've done (if s/he even knows that much); (2) you'll have to return the tablet at your own cost--around $25--just so Toshiba can get right what it should have done the first time. Before you buy this tablet, search for \"Toshiba Excite won't upgrade\" or \"trouble upgrading Toshiba Excite,\" and you'll see a fairly large amount of hits for a not-very-widespread tablet. NONE tell you what to do--apparently most believe the update image is corrupt, but there is no site where you can download the update to a PC and sideload it (which won't work on Toshiba anyway).This thing is past its warranty period, but it's simply unacceptable that so many people have so much trouble upgrading, so I'll be returning it to Amazon and taking the 20% out-of-warranty hit on what I paid. I bought it early because I've had good luck with Toshiba laptops and with the Thrive, and the price must have dropped at least 25% since then (by June or July, actually). Now there's a new 16GB version of this that ships with Jelly Bean installed, but if you'll holding out hope to get the next upgrade coming along, I know I would avoid Toshiba tablets until they get their act together: techs who know what they're doing, forum support people who know a little more than to tell you to do a factory reset, and a policy that doesn't charge the customer extra to get a product that works as it should. In one story on the forums, someone who sent an Excite back for an update was told that \"this was a problem they had never seen before\"--but it seems to be pretty common if you look at Toshiba forums or the internet for 5 or 10 minutes. No answers; lots o' problems.One thing I believe strongly about products like this: they should simply work. When they don't work, there should be solutions other than sending it back to Toshiba for 2 to 4 weeks at my expense. Toshiba, make your mirror images available on your site, because your OTA updates just are not working for a LOT of people.I'm docking my review 2 stars down to 3 stars: it's still a nice thin tablet, has nice colors, and decent battery life, with a full SD card slot and a lot of outputs. It's really too bad, because I like this tablet, but not taking an update, with no resources available from the manufacturer to fix it, is simply unacceptable.__________________________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW (before I realized that I would never, ever be able to update this tablet):Before this, I had the Toshiba Thrive, which I really liked a lot. It was rugged, served as a great eReader, and gave me access to work and personal email. I have to read a lot of pdfs for work, and I don't want to be glued to a computer--or even laptop--to do it.When the Excite 10, a thinner tablet with the Tegra 3 quad-core came out, I was, well, excited. I sold my Thrive (which held its value remarkably well), because it was just a little heavy for long bouts of reading. I LOVE this tablet. It is fast, responsive, starts up quickly, takes a 32GB full-size SD card (more for \"sneaker net\" porting than true storage, depending on your application--but same as the Thrive), and has excellent wifi reception throughout my house (n connection).Netflix movies look great, with NO lag at all. In fact, the ONLY glitch I have found is that the gmail application sometimes will not sync without uninstalling all updates, syncing to the present, and then trying to reinstall updates again. My Exchange email syncs perfectly, as does my calendar. I like the features of Ice Cream Sandwich such as app grouping and the ability to bring up (and shut down) running apps. The file management system is vastly improved.For reading pdfs and other books, I choose between Acrobat (which has come a long way and is now excellent), ezPDF (which is a very nice app), and Kindle for Android, which has very good pdf support--not to mention the fact that I like to read my large Kindle collection on a larger screen, with backlighting. (NOTE to Amazon: I just wish that some of the .azw4 textbooks were available for reading on the Kindle app for Android, and not just on PC or the Kindle Fire. The Kindle Fire is a wonderful device, but I wanted a little more AND the ability to use the Kindle app. The 10\" screen would be a great place for all of the wonderful advantages of .azw4 books, including dictionary lookup and cross-links. Just sayin'...)I have not noticed the bleeding issue others have seen--and which has been a dealbreaker for many. The ONLY time I notice any bleeding is during startup, when you have a completely black screen with a very bright multi-colored \"horizon\"-type effect in the middle. I do see side bleed then, but no more than my Sharp Quattron TV with a very dark screen on which there are bright elements. Otherwise, I honestly don't see it--not during reading, Netflix viewing, web surfing, checking emails, going through work materials, or playing games. And the screen colors and warmth are near-perfect.CONS: The price drop since I bought it. I got it soon after it came out, but the price drop since then is kind of disheartening.  The lack of aftermarket support. There does not seem to be a dock for this model. Toshiba had them for about $50, but while waiting for the price to come down (as with Thrive accessories), they seem to have been discontinued. I hate to see Toshiba giving up on such an excellent device.  The confusion with the Toshiba Excite 10 LE. When searching for accessories, you have to be VERY careful that they are for this series (the AT305, NOT for the lower-spec'd but thinner and somewhat sexier Toshiba LE series). I don't know what Toshiba was thinking there; that was bound to cause confusion.All in all--ESPECIALLY at the current prices--this is a tablet you have to consider. If you get a bleed issue, send it back. But you might get lucky--and without the bleed issue, you'll have a very fine, thin, responsive, good-lucking tablet more likely than others to cause envy among your iPod-toting friends and coworkers.", "Title": "Update after 7 months; not so great", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Author": "Zac", "ReviewID": "R3SIY1GODYID28", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to get either a netbook or tablet for school.

I read somewhere that this tablet will accept a 128GB SD card, so I bought a 64GB SD card and installed it in the SD card slot (with no problems).  I had to remove the plastic cover that WAS filling the SD card slot.  Once I installed the SD card, the plastic SD card slot cover no longer fits.  The SD card fits all of the way down into the slot, but you can still see the back end of the SD card.  It's not a physical problem, just a visual one (since the card is not hidden behind a silvery cover.  I don't think it's a real problem, especially after I bought a leather cover for the tablet.

Although other people wrote that the micro USB port can be used to charge the tablet, I couldn't get it to charge my tablet. I plugged the micro USB cable into my computer, but the tablet never gave any indication that it was charging.  I think that the micro USB port is only for connecting to a computer to TRANSFER DATA. As for the light bleeding (on the screen) that some people have mentioned (as a defect), I have no idea what they are talking about.  This may be my first tablet, but the screen looks just fine to me.  Eventually, I'll figure out what to do with all of the apps, but I'm learning more each day.  By the way, you will really need to have a Google account.  Until I created a Google account and logged on, it seemed like every app that I tried to open wouldn't work, because I kept getting a stupid Google Account Log On screen.

I was not happy.Lucky I know about electronics and how to fix annoyance that occurs. but for most, you would have had to order another $50-$60 charger. or return the entire tablet and wait for a new one to be shipped out. if it was still in the 30 day purchased limit. then have to wait another 2-3 weeks for a new one to be shipped out. maybe even longer wait for it to come.its not the companys fault that has them in stock, its Toshibas Company with there faulty charger. no excuse on there part.another thing im dissappointed is that you cant charge it with a micro usb.so thats why you get 3 stars", "Title": "charger", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "GMan", "ReviewID": "R122M5RCBPP1NQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read the reviews of the excite,and have had no troulbe at all.

One of (if not) the nicest Tegra 3 tablets I have seen, spec wise and sheer cosmetics of the unit are excellent. I love the design of the casing and screen, claiming thinnest tablet of it's class in the world is a nice notch in your belt Toshiba especially with whats included.I know the previous model the AT200 series people were somewhat unhappy with the sharp edges on the back of the unit when holding the tablet. Seems this has been addressed with the new body design. As well, there were talks of issues with the screen flexing from the rear when pressed, this is not the case with the AT305. I feel the gorilla glass thats on this will be more than tough enough for what I would consider an \"Acceptable\" amount of force. I pushed it with enough force to where I cautioned myself to stop and there is no felx on the front side.The tablet is quite lite to hold and does not seem to fatigue me with an hour or so of use. Response of the hardware coupled with ICS is virtually instantaneous and then fluid from that point forward. Threw a couple HD videos on and watched them for testing, and display was very sharp and clean (No stuttering or anything like that). Depending on how you encode the audio in your movies seems to reflect the output volume wise. Some movies were quieter than others, but I fault that on the encoding processed used when making the movie.Can't comment on the speed of the SD Slot, however I have a class 10 32GB on the way and expect to maximize the bus without issue.Things I am waiting for:- Rooting method so I can use some of my favorite apps (Root Explorer, Titanium Backup, AdFree, Cache Cleaner, Terminal Emulator etc...)- A nice hardshell/softshell case that will protect well but also not add too much bulk to the device as I LOVE how thin it is.Will update with other thoughts the more I use it.Hans", "Title": "Style and performace , 5 star for me.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Author": "Cesar", "ReviewID": "R1K9EYNMSTAHI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet has some great features.

Due to its design, I wanted to replace my current Samsung Tab 2 10.1\" with the Toshiba Excite 16GB 10.1\". The price has been declining since its release, which might be an indication of poor sales, due to higher price of Excite compared to other Android tablets that offer the same -or more- for less.I was well aware of the light bleed issue prior to ordering and hoped that the unit I'll receive will have bearable levels of light bleed. I was not that lucky! The one I have is terrible. Needless to say, any dark screen shows the numerous bleed spots along all edges of the screen clearly. In addition, there's one spot that's very strong and it even shows up during regular use without any dark background. I just can't stand it! Furthermore, compared to Samsung's screen, Excite has washed out colors and more limited viewing angles.Lastly, I'm having some performance issues, too. Both the Excite and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 are running the same version of Android with the exact same set of apps, but the built in browser keeps crashing on Excite, and number of apps (e.g., Moxier Mail) that work perfectly fine on Galaxy Tab is having issues on Excite.In terms of design, this is an excellent tablet (hence the 2 stars); however, the most important component of a tablet (the screen) ruins the experience. I hope that Toshiba fixes the problem in a later release of this tablet.UPDATE: This has been the worst Android tablet I've used so far. The web browsing is very problematic, both with the built in browser, as well as with Google Chrome. Pages go blank for no reason while scrolling, typing a message in a box on forums make everything else around the text box disappear, etc. Once it stops, refreshing the page doesn't reload it; you have to quit the browser and start all over. Very annoying! More seriously, it randomly restarted itself 3 times so far. Whether it was a random restart or a restart initiated by me, once it fires up, none of the preferences in the apps are preserved. For instance, I can enter username/password to the Dropbox app, or setup an Exchange mail account with Moxier Mail, and they work fine. After a restart, Dropbox comes with the login screen again, and Moxier shows a setup screen, which means you lose the settings of apps after a restart. I'm giving these 2 apps as an example; the same happens with others. Needless to say, I'll be staying away from any future Toshiba tablets.

Had I paid the full amount out of pocket I would have returned the tablet for a full refund and looked else where. I really like this tablet overall...the specs are pretty decent and it runs well but the light bleed is pretty significant. Come on Toshiba, how could you let something like this out the door? Almost all tablets are going to have a bit of backlight bleed (except my wife's iPad) but there's enough light coming through around all 4 sides to power a light house. I brought the first one back for an exchange and decided to keep this second one. The first one had bleed just in the upper right corner and along the entire right side but the light was much brighter. This one has bleed evenly spaced on all four sides but is much dimmer. When it's fully powered up the back light issue is not noticeable with normal usage. More noticeable on dark movie scenes / pictures. I can live with this one for what I paid.

So far, so good! Fast, light and the screen seems bright enough for me, though I'm not too picky about screen brightness issues other than \"bleeding.\" Yes, I want a bright screen that displays colors impressively, but I don't need iPad quality. I would, however, take issue if I had problems with the wifi or touch screen (which I did not). I'm happy to report that I was able to connect with my network with NO disconnect/reconnect issues (which I had with another tablet). A few lag issues and one or two force closes with apps, but I think that's because a few apps may not yet be compatible with this tablet. (Also, I have a tendency to try and switch tabs, screens and programs too quickly)! Music and videos play with no stuttering, and I haven't had any sound issues (no echoes or distortion with my headphones). Sound without the headphones is fairly loud, but why have the speakers on the bottom? Go figure!One more thing, if you were wondering if the processor is 1.5 vs. 1.2 GHz, I think it's actually 1.4 GHz.

I had no idea it was even on sale yet and decided to give it a try considering I really wanted a Tegra 3 Tablet.SCREEN The Excite 10 screen is getting a lot of press lately for light bleeding around the edges.  Honestly, the bleed was present in both of the Excite 10s that I tried but, it only showed up when the device was booting up and I could never see it during normal operation at all.  In fact, the screen during everyday use is actually brilliant and sharp.I honestly have no complaints about the screen whatsoever, it is bright, has good contrast, and the viewing angles are excellent.I would rate this a 4 out of 5 because there are better displays out there but it is certainly a big reason to buy this tablet.BUILDThe body is made of a light weight aluminum with matte finish and the screen uses Gorilla glass.  This seems like a fairly solid device thanks to the build materials but, the first Excite 10 I used, began to separate at the corner above the power button and the aluminum pulled away from the plastic bezel.basically, I would rate this a 3 out of 5 as it seemed a little fragile for the materials used.PORTSStandard ports for the Excite 10 are 1 HDMI, 1 MicroUSB, an oversized proprietary charging port, and one Full Sized SDXC Card Slot.The biggest benefit to this tablet is the SDXC Card Slot in that it allows you to use 128 Gig Cards and this should be a major win but, Toshiba decided to mount the card in such a way that you cannot move apps to the card and you pretty much have to use their file manager to move any files onto the card.CAMERASA Tablet to me isn't really a good device for taking pictures with and I don't know why anyone would want it for that. Honestly, I think tablets should save people money and just put the front facing camera on them.Either way, both cameras in this tablet are horrible and even though the front facing camera is 2 MP, it is about the same quality as the .3 MP front facing camera in the iPad 2 and 3.SPEAKERSSpeakers have decent sound and way more options than any other on the market.  However, they simply aren't loud enough if you have any background noise at all and if you have a stand, you will muffle the sound as the speakers are locate on the bottom of the tablet in landscape mode.Overall, they're nice but nothing special, I give this a 3 out of 5.FEATURES There are few defining features to this Tablet and that isn't cool because there are enough points that detract from the tablet.I guess I would say, the best point about the tablet is that the GPU simply is the fastest running of all the Tegra 3 devices.  Also, there are very few mods to the ICS implementation and, the SDXC support is nice to have for storing movies, music and the like.AESTHETICS & FINISHFor the most part, the Excite 10 is really pleasant to use and it is a very stylish Tablet.  ICS is pretty much stock with a few exceptions and there is never a hint of slowdown on day to day use, even with Multiple Apps running in the background.SOFTWAREThe tablet has a very nice multimedia center which allows the device to act as a DLNA Receiver or Server.  Also, log me in ignition is one of the most expensive apps in the play store and Toshiba bundles it for free.CONCLUSIONI really wanted to Love the Toshiba and it was a tablet that I would have kept and been very happy with, if not for the fact, that the second one I received locked up sometimes as many as 2 to 3 times a day.  Ultimately, what appears to be QC issues has me returning the Toshiba and trying out other devices...  I can not honestly recommend this tablet based on these issues.", "Title": "I really loved it at first!", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Author": "A.

At first I thought I got a defictive product, so I returned it for an exchange but the exchange had the same problem.

I did not pay for an iPad 3rd generation because it was a lot more expensive excluding taxes. I didn't listen to my parents, and I opted for the 16GB version of this for $450. When I took it home, I was trying to make my mother feel like crap and told her how cool mine was and how it could do so many things her iPad 2 couldn't. But then things got complicated.It has a horribly huge charger which I couldn't stand for a minute! It was as thick as a typical USB cable and was huge on both ends. The screen was horrible. It has a lot of bleed, and to people who think it doesn't matter, the screen bleed is VERY annoying and distracting. I am not usually picky with screens but this one really looked like a photo of a black wall with spotlights coming from every edge. It was also not very bright. The display also felt like it was cheaply made with a thin piece of glass, and the back felt more like plastic though I think it's aluminum. It's also hard to find accessories for it. The battery life was mediocre, lasted around 6-7 hours and I don't even do video playback, music or anything that is power consuming. I used it to browse the web at about 20% brightness and the battery bar at the bottom dropped really quick.The positives: Android OS is very nice and customizable, it runs rather fast, the design is very thin and it's very light. I like the fact that you can use an SD card and it also has a cool file system (editing folders, etc) that iOS doesn't offer. I like the fact you can download apps from a browser and install it too, that is my favorite feature of Android.Extended negative experience: This product acted up exactly 2 weeks after I bought it, where the store I bought it from was already closed that night. The home screens were switching around, it was clicking on things on its own, it was closing apps; proved that the one I got was defective. Yeah I get that a lot of products come defective, but acting up after two weeks when I can't return it, I had to call Toshiba up and they had my case pending for TWO MONTHS before they finally sent me this 32GB model as an apology for my long wait.Okay, I should've learned my lesson from Toshiba electronics, considering I owned two external hard drives from them and they both failed in less than a year. Not only did I have to wait two months to get my replacement, but after I did, the retail value of this item went way down at electronic stores and even HERE on Amazon! I sold the device brand new, never opened to a buyer who demanded a refund and returned this item; value is now even lower. After getting the item back in mid-August and just sold it again a week ago, I now get another return request, and to keep my feedback at a good score, I accepted the return request. The retail value of this item got lower and lower the past months and I have been stuck trying to sell it; getting ripped off from classified ad responders who only want to give me $250-280 for this device. It's like it holds no value at all in the tablet marketplace.Point is: This would've been a great device had it not broke on me, and then make me come to a realization and then suffer months trying to get rid of it. It's a good tablet in terms of hardware specifications, it really is. But the form and build of it is weak, the screen is weak, and the customer service was terrible. I'm telling you, I am desperately trying to get rid of this item, and people deserve to know to stay away from Toshiba products. If you want to get rid of it, it will be difficult.I don't dislike Android, I just dislike Toshiba's products. If you are going to buy an Android tablet especially one that was as pricey as this, get one that is KNOWN for quality (Nexus 7, I guess Amazon Kindle counts too, and from what I know, Asus stuff are nice too).

Crudup", "ReviewID": "R35REKMJZJF8XZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I BOUGHT THE FLOOR MODEL FROM OFFICEDEPOT!First off, I only made this a 1 star review since when I look at reviews I start from the bottom up.Its not the people who think its great I want to hear from. Its the ones with the problems and what kind of problems I want to know about.To me the product is 4 1/2 stars. More on that later.What made me chose this tab? Reading 1 star reviews on Acer A510, Asus Transformer TF300 and Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.If I got any one of those for a gift I would say they are all fine products, but I did not so this how I make my choice.I take all reviews with a grain of salt since its human nature for us to not see our own shortcomings.When many people can get something to work, say sync the device to a computer, and one person cannot, they blame the device and not themselves.We also praise our own decisions. \"Like writing positive reviews ;) \"Go look at a review of something you have owned for a while and love. Look at the negative reviews for that product. Do the same for something you hated and look a positive reviews.So I look at problems more related to things outside of skill levels.Acer A510 - Gets hot, reports of numerous crashes, sudden reboots, reports of not powering on, failures vary over time. Reports of \"grid pattern\". Seems the same over similar products. A200. I could ignore all that with a Square Trade warranty.Did a hands on of the A200 at Best Buy and Staples. Saw the \"grid pattern if you look for it off angle. If you press your fingers in the back of the device it will cause the circular screen swirls on the front. Noticed that not even trying to do that.No hands on on the A510. Liked the feel of the A200, A510 will feel the same. Considered the A200 since the price is really good now. Dont play many games so the Tegra 2 is no biggie for me.Can be rooted easily I believe, good hacker and XDA support. Custom ROMS I think now or soon. NTFS support. 32GB Memory.Asus TF300 - Quality issues the same with A510 except for the heat issue. Also considered the TF200 with its metal case and the Tegra 2 not being an issue. It would have been refurbished but I just have to remember everyone who hated it with problems, when they send them back, where do the tablets go!? No \"back finger screen rings\" problem.Samsung Tab 2 - No usb, no Tegra 3, no hdmi, Touch Wiz. no price discount.Good hacker support. Good accessory support. \"Less\" problems with the product itself. No \"back finger screen rings\" problem.HANDS ON TESTING.Had the Samsung, Toshiba and Asus side by side in Officedepot.They all were good and nothing was that much different as far as speed, screen and build.I preferred the \"feel\" of the Toshiba over the Asus. The plastic back was ok, but the metal and plastic of the Toshiba and Samsung I preferred.The screens where all good but the Toshiba was slightly more clear to me. The best way to see is to use the same image on all three tablets. You cant tell using different images on different tablets.Since they all have Google maps I used the same image and looked at color and text clarity. There was no \"drastic\" winner. I set all the screens to full brightness and turned off auto brightness.Asus hinted more blue, Samsung hinted more red. Toshiba hinted neutral and a little less \"vibrant\". They should have color adjustments for these things just like monitors do.The best answer for the screen is the best answer for your own spouse. Dont compare it to another one and you will be happy.If I let 500 people adjust my TVs picture, I would have 500 different settings. You have to choose what is best for \"you\".LIGHT BLEED TESTI turned all 3 tablets to full brightness and powered the units off. Turned them on one by one and checked for light bleed on each cupping my face to the screen to get it as dark as possible.Under those conditions the light bleed was little to none for all three tablets.I also did the same look at them from normal view in the store. Remember the stores lights are bright so you should not see any light bleed.I saw no light bleed from the Toshiba and it stood well with the other two.When over to Best Buy. Did a light bleed test under full light and could see the light bleed on the startup screen on the Toshiba, Asus TF300 and Acer A200.The Asus and Acer had more of a soft even bleed because you where looking for it. The Toshibas was brighter and uneven make it say look at me.I had returned one prior that had a different bleed pattern. But less noticeable.On all tablets it disappears after startup.So I went back to Officedepot to buy one. I figured these things are made in lots so they may have gotten a got \"lot\" of tablets.Before I left the store I told them I want to test it. I went to the other tablets and performed the cupping light bleed test. It was almost perfect except for a small bit bleed in one corner.The floor model was \"perfect\" and had no light bleed.I ASKED THEM CAN I HAVE THE ONE FROM THE FLOOR AND THEY AGREED.No discounts, since they still had new stock. The only reason I did this was because the tablets had just come out. Before I wiped the tablet some people had taken pictures and the date was May 5 on. This was less than a month old.BUT I HAVE NO LIGHT BLEED.Am I crazy or what? Not really a question but I can say I am satisfied.I COUPLE OF THINGS I NOTICED.The Officedepot tablet when opened was wrapped up like the IPad. Full cellophane wrapping the unit and had no screen protector. The serial number started out 4C383XXXR.The one I got from Best Buy Mobile had no wrapping but a screen protector with a tab. The serial started out 4C4XXXXXX. It seems that maybe the first produced units had better screens that later ones.Or they came from different factories. Just a thought. Maybe the people with good screens should give the first few digits of the serial to see if there is a pattern.A WORD ON LIGHT BLEED.WARNING - IF YOU READ THE NEXT PARAGRAPH YOU MAY NEVER BE HAPPY WITH YOUR MONITOR AGAIN.You are concerned about it right? Chances are you a using a flat panel right now. Have you ever complained about the light bleed on it before?Try this test. Turn off every light in the room. Its better if the is at night. Reboot you computer and look at your screen in complete darkness until it reboots.Chances are you will not see a perfectly black screen when your computer start booting. You have had light bleed and never notices it or cared.I have a Samsung 27 and it has light bleed issues. When I am talking about light bleed its the quantity, evenness and severity of it. It is hard to find a screen without \"some\" light bleed.THE TABLET.I have had it for a week and love it blah, blah, blah. Its stable and fast and well built. I think they will fix the light bleed issue for all.It cost about $50 too much but you have to weigh that with the Gorilla Glass, but that more for phones in peoples pockets or purses.Full size SD card. Depends on you. But for me I have to say do I feel its worth the extra in stability and build quality.I have a feeling it will be going down it price soon. Already at Officedepot the week of June 3, 2012 the tablet comes with a $50 Officedepot gift card.THE LITTLE EXTRASSome have said that the cannot find the cable to allow them to use the USB host. Well you are already at the right place of Amazon.com search for micro USB OTG cable.Many will show up saying it is for this tablet/phone or that but they all work with any device. Just find the cheapest or the one you like best. Some are straight and some have right angles.They dont cost more that a couple of bucks and I bought three from different places saying they are for different phone/tablets but they all have worked on the Toshiba.I also ordered the micro HDMI to HDMI cable 6 feet for ~$3 and it works great. Solid build too. It said it was for the blackberry tablet but it will work on any micro hdmi device unless you know the manufactures change it from the standard.I also have the Toshiba case for this tablet which I like the best for these reasons. I protects the corners of the tablet and is custom made to fix like a glove. It looks and feels like leather. Very good quality and good padding.Its adjustable. Some minor dislikes are no strap or velcro to keep it closed. Sort of like carrying a book. Have to open the case to charge the device. It doesnt have to be removed, I just fold the from cover over the back.You could or they could cut a slot for the charge port. But they may have considered that and decided against that on looks or durability.The case part number is PA1511U-1TPDBAD REVIEWERSFor all of you that rate products one star and complain about minor things. GOOD. You should.Manufactures will know consumers can be P.I.As and will hopefully think twice before releasing substandard products that will cost them more money to take back and discount, but instead get it right the first time without crappy cutbacks.Demand better and as consumers we will get it.FINAL WORD.They are all nice tablets. I compromised and got what I felt will work best for me for what I need it to do and will put up with.I say compromise since they all have their pluses and minuses.The post says I bought the 32GB version but it should have been posted on the 16GB version which is the one I have.", "Title": "AM I CRAZY OR WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Author": "CLS", "ReviewID": "R1N19TAESWC29C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have received my Toshiba Excite 10 and was suspicious the moment I unpacked the Amazon box.
