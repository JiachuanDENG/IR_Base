{"Reviews": [{"Author": "B. Price", "ReviewID": "R64CIHTVR0QD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Review updated 2/5/2013.  I ordered this tablet immediately when Amazon posted it with 1-day shipping and as of 7/20/2013 I haven't had any issues as a few users seem to have reported.  Don't get discouraged if you get a lemon; just return it for another - Amazon has free returns/replacements in such cases. * Hand Written Notes - S Notes - Exports to PDF and also JPG.  It has templates for various types of productivity.  My favorites are the ruled paper, the meeting template (date, time, attendees, meeting notes) and the recipe template (I can imagine this being very useful for the kitchen, propped up in a case). - Papyrus Beta - This free application is very nice and similar to S Note but has normal paper templates such as College Ruled, Wide Ruled, Narrow Ruled, Blank and 4 different Graph Paper types. - ezPDF - Costs $3 and is what you'll probably want to make annotations on lecture slides and whatnot. - MOST applications allow you to rest your palm on the tablet while writing, others are not as well written.  This all depends on the author of a specific app. - SOME applications have nice erasers.  Some times you can press the button on the S Pen to erase instead of write and some times you can just use your finger to erase while using the S Pen to write.  This all depends on the author of a specific application. * Hand Writing Instead of Typing - The default keyboard has an option that lets you hand write in any input field instead of typing.  Long-press the settings (gear) button on the keyboard to select the T button which enables hand writing.  Please see the User Images of this product for a good example of this. * Multitasking (updated 2/5/2013) - Within the past week I've noticed a number of apps I use get multi-screen support so it's much less limited and a gimmick, now.  I can easily be taking notes on one half of the screen while browsing or chatting or whatever on the other half.  With more apps supporting the feature now it's a much larger factor in whether or not to buy. * GPS - Fast and accurate.  I am currently on the first floor of a two-story apartment building about ten feet away from the outer wall (sliding glass door) and Google Maps had my position within 40 meters almost instantly after turning on the GPS receiver.  Within 35ish seconds it had my position accurate to 10 meters. * S Pen - Comfortable to hold (I'm a 5'10\" tall guy and have normal sized hands).  There's an odd button on the side which adds extra functionality with certain gestures.  I have no idea how it works because I'm pretty sure the S Pen isn't powered in any way, but it's more than just a stylus. * Screen - Very sensitive.  I've been taking notes for half of my classes on my tablet and it works well.  I usually have the brightness set to 10-15% or slightly less in classrooms or at home because that's all I really need but also to conserve battery life. * Battery - While leaving it on all the time, wifi off when not using it, I manage to only charge my Note 10.1 once a week.  Standard usage includes notes during seven hours of lecture each week and using it periodically throughout the day or in the evening. - To really stretch your battery life you'll need to disable some apps.  I disabled Google+ and some of the default/Samsung apps that come with the device in Settings->Application Manager.  As of 2/5/2013 I'm still getting ~7 days out of one charge with moderate usage. * Build Quality - Standard Samsung quality.  The case has a lot of plastic and the back gives a little if you push on it but it definitely feels solid.  Now that it's in a case the build quality doesn't matter any more. * Speed - Very smooth.  I updated about 10 apps at the same time in the market, an operation which would nearly cripple my Galaxy S until it was done, and I couldn't tell any difference in the smoothness of the Note 10.1.  While I was exploring I ended up having 15-20 applications open at the same time but again I couldn't tell any difference. - Coming from a Galaxy S phone and hardly ever using a tablet before, I'm amazed by how fast this thing boots/restarts. * Wifi - No complaints.  It connects quickly and hasn't had any issues. * Sound - Good, loud and scared my cat when I started something on Google Play.  She looked around like she does when our surround sound is on because she doesn't understand what was making such a noise.  I can't tell any difference in quality between it and my laptop when watching the same video on both (the laptop was ~$1700 before a coupon). * Rooting Friendly - Check out the forum for this tablet on xda developers for info.  This device already has developers that say they'll work on it and I'm sure more will sign up because the Note 10.1 stands out among the crowd. * Universal Remote / IR Blaster - Works well enough.  I'm going to sell my Logitech Harmony One universal remote because the Peel application works but could be nicer.  With my Harmony One I could set up custom activities like Listen to Radio on my Onkyo receiver but the Peel application only has standard actions like Watch Bluray.  I can still set it to play the radio but it's buried in the menus. - Great cable TV interface.  We don't watch/have cable, but if you tell it what service you have it'll tell you what is currently playing, what will be playing and provides customized content based on the preferences you specify.  It works with DVRs so I imagine you can manage all of that from the Peel application as well. * Cameras - Amazon removed the images I posted for some reason so just take my word that the cameras work well.  Both the front 1.9MP camera and 5MP camera fully live up to their specs. * The Wife - Now that I've set it up the way I like it she won't put it down.  You may not want your not-so-techie spouse to love it, but at least my wife won't be complaining that I spent $550 on it and then another nearly $100 on accessories =) * SwitchMe App - When set up properly, if your tablet is rooted, this free application will give your Android device multiple profiles.  Normally an Android device can only have one primary Google account to use with Google specific applications and whatnot, but this allows you to have separate profiles with separate accounts and separate applications.Note:  If you're going to use the SwitchMe app, DO NOT clone one profile to create another.  Just set up a completely new profile.", "Title": "THE Tablet for Students, but Great for All", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Author": "Alex Alexzander", "ReviewID": "R1S7WZM8L3L8Q1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't buy mine from Amazon as I couldn't find it on Amazon. I ended up going to my local BestBuy to pick it up. The reviews online were mostly okay except for The Verge which said it was sluggish and basically was down beat on it.I decided to buy it and if I didn't like it I would be returning it. I picked it up around 5:30PM on the 16th of August which is the release date. The first thing I did was get rid of all the widgets that are on the home screens. I suspect those might slow it down. I kept only one widget which is the clock / weather widget. I then downloaded all my favorite apps and began to arrange and configure it the way I wanted it.It comes with Polaris Office, which is better than QuickOffice if you plan to create and edit word docs, Polaris is easier. To view documents and complex excel sheets I find QuickOffice often does the better job. I ed up keep both installed just in case.I installed 14 games on it. All of which perform very well. There are my favorites, like FieldRunners, and newer ones like Final Fantasy, Ski Safari, Nova 3, Osmos HD, Amazing Alex and Zynga poker that I also really like. This quad core eats through anything with ease.Got the latest Google Maps, which is so fantastic on this. You can save a Map so it's available without a data connection. Perfect for these WiFi devices. I'm a fan of the new Google Play movies, music, books and Magazines too. But if you prefer Amazon or Nook, those are available as always. It comes with the B&N; Nook Reader by default.There are Galaxy Note 10.1 specific apps like Adobe's PS Touch. I've been using Photoshop since 1996 so I am going to carefully review the built in lessons for PS Touch, a mobile version of Photoshop and see how far I can take that. If you are a subscriber to Adobe's Cloud services you're supposed to be able to edit a PSD with PS Touch, save it to the cloud, and then continue to edit it with Photoshop the desktop app.There is also S Note. S Note and PS Touch are geared to work well with the new Samsung Galaxy S Pen. This was a primary reason for me to be interested in this particular tablet. The S Pen is so accurate that you can hand write whole sheets of handwritten text with it. I didn't try to have it translated into actual text like type written text. I just left it as my handwriting. Really like it.Now this new Note 10.1 also has a new Muli-tasking feature. I should say that it doesn't multitask any app combo you want. Just a few apps blessed by Samsung which are: The base browser, not Chrome, their video player, Polaris Office, the picture gallery and their email app, not the GMail email app. Their email app can be used with POP, IMAP and Microsoft's Exchange via the built in Active Sync. So I tend to use that email client for work email and I use GMail as my personal email client.Now, according to The Verge, multitasking was horrible. Not so fast Verge. I don't know what you guys are doing but I multitask'd just about every way you can on this and it works surprising well. I wrote notes while playing video. I played video while scrolling up and down on a web page. I copied text from an email to S Note, which both apps loaded in the side by side both on the screen simultaneously method. I had no trouble at all.I bought Autodesk's Sketchpad Pro and can draw with that just fine. I also bought Adobe Ideas, but haven't yet played with that at all. Samsung also has their own kind of store and I am going to see if they have more S Pen specific apps. Really like the S Pen a lot. It's exactly like a typical Wacom Stylus. It's sharp, not that horrible eraser head large stylus you get stuck with if you want to use a stylus on the iPad. Although the iPad has Paper by 53, which I wish I had on here.I'm really just getting started. I'll have to update this review over the weekend. Only played with this new tab for about 4 to 6 hours now.Check out Google's Currents for news, and Pocket for saving articles for future reading. Both are great on this tablet. I think all the bases are covered with this tablet. Movies, games, magazines, office and productivity, art creation and editing. It does everything. And since it is Android, you have a real file system which makes email a breeze. Love this thing so far.", "Title": "Really like it", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Author": "Jini Jazz", "ReviewID": "R20VE2KIIS83RU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a long time Apple guy who currently owns 2012 Retina Macbook Pro, 27 inch iMac, iPad3, & iPhone 4S. I stay with Apple products mainly because Mac does the best for what I do. However, I never have been 100% satisfied with iPhone & iPad due to their unnecessary restrictions and limitations. I just couldn't find alternatives - I love Android in terms of features and potential, but the execution(overall user experience) has been lagging.I guess that the time has come. Galaxy Note 10.1 made big step forward and turned the potential into reality. Just after 48 hours learning and playing around, I am convinced this is the device I want to use everyday. It is the first tablet that actually helps my productivity, no more frustration with restricted toy. So iPad goes to my mom now.I won't relist pros and cons, since all reviewers already listed them. But I just want to correct a few misconceptions that some biased online reviewers manufactured.1. Some people lie about build quality and they claim it makes squeaky sound when they grap it. Either they got the defect or it is downright lie. It feels solid and much better material for everyday use. Aluminum on my iPad may \"look\" better, but not practical without cover or case. I always had to use cover for my iPad to prevent scratches. But if you have to use case to cover, what's the point? It covers \"beautiful\" aluminum anyway. I don't even use cover/case for Galaxy Note and it feels just right in many hours use. Again, this two tone design(mine is white-silver) looks beautiful, very comfortable for many hours. This tablet is designed to work, not just look.2. Screen - screen resolution is one of the reasons I was hesitant to try Galaxy Note. All I can say is just go try it yourself. This screen is beautiful! Yes you heard this from the owner who use Retina Macbbok Pro and 27 iMac everyday. Do not fall into john doe's resolution comparison, just go check it yourself! Sure 1920 would be nice, but I'd take  Galaxy's 1280 with S-Pen any day.3. Some say it's expensive. Do you know how much it cost to buy wacom device with this size and feature alone?Most importantly, this tablet is so fast and responsive and delivers many things in my wish list \"today\". No more compromising and stuck with iPad. S-Pen, true multitasking (yes limited as of now, but it's already very powerful and useful), and microSD support (I feel like a prisoner who just escaped from Alcatraz!).  I suggest you to check this device yourself and never fall into some online reviews.Don't get me wrong. I still love Apple products and I will stay with Mac unless I see something better for my life and work. I just wanted to share my experience with Galaxy Note 10.1 because there are so many false reviews from Apple or Android fan boys and girls.*** I strongly recommend you to watch all SAMSUNGmobile's YouTube videos to utilize Galaxy to its full potential. You will see why I think no other tablets can even compete with Galaxy Note. ***One more thing...I know my next phone will be Samsung Galaxy Note II.", "Title": "It's Samsung time now", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Author": "Arthur K. Yellin \"dinosaurus13\"", "ReviewID": "R2O1SZ3MIKIGXW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. I am placing the same review under each model I tried.Background - I am now 65 - NOT a member of the electronic generation! I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general. I know very little about smart phones or tablets.  I firmly believe that a company OWES SUPPORT to their consumers and NOT at additional cost! Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned. I am simply a consumer relating my personal experiences!iPad - first generation - EVERYTHING you do with it is tied to iTunes.  When I tried it, there was absolutely NO manual or documentation available for iTunes.  Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.  I found iTunes and the Apple OS to be confusing and difficult to use.  The tablet, itself, performed well but I prefer an OS that allows direct folder and file access.Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet first generation. This device runs Android 2.3. It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly. The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage. I have never found an app that is \"incompatible\" with this model. This is an important point in the reviews that follow. I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.  Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as \"floaters\" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet. It is HEAVY. While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps. Furthermore, the screen seems to get greasy very quickly!Asus TF300 Transformer 10.1 inch tablet.  While the construction of mine was solid, all the other negative observations of other reviewers were immediately apparent. The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router. The Asus TF300 was also incompatible with many of my favorite apps. Finally, the Asus TF300 (and TF700 mentioned below) has a strange auto-spelling correct system that FREQUENTLY screwed up my typing. To their credit, Asus did answer my question with instructions on how to turn the spelling correction off, but only via email. They have NO telephone tech support.Samsung Galaxy NOTE 10.1 inch tablet. While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.  At roughly $200 more than the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet, although it performed well, I did not feel it was worth the difference in price.Asus TF700 Transformer Infinity -  suffers many of the same problems as the less expensive TF300 model. SPASTIC OS, intermittent wi-fi disconnection. The auto-brightness control also appeared not to work or not to work properly. Perhaps worst of all, possibly because of the increased resolution (the improved resolution was NOT apparent to MY eyes - it appeared to me about the same as all the other tablets) the device is incompatible with MANY apps!(added 12/7/2012) Pursuant to a few comments, I AGAIN tried an Asus TF700 and compared it SIDE BY SIDE with my Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet.  With the better processor, higher memory capacity and increased resolution, I GENUINELY hoped that the ASUS TF700 was worth the difference in price.  I was hoping that the first one I tried was an outlier.  SADLY, it was NOT.  For some unknown reason, the Asus TF700 is NOT compatible with Scrabble, a major reason for my tablet use (to keep in frequent touch with my daughter).  That, however, is minor and will probably be addressed in the future.  Again, side by side, the Samsung Galaxy 2 tablet reported a STRONG wi-fi signal, the Asus TF700 reported only a GOOD signal.  While downloading apps, the Google Play Store froze on the Asus, never on the Samsung.  I opened several apps, one at a time, simultaneously on BOTH tablets and examined them under exactly the same lighting and circumstances.  I WAS better able to read very fine print on the Asus (probably 4 point type, white against a dark background), otherwise, for all other apps, I saw NO significant difference between the two.  My opinion remains unchanged, SAVE your money and buy the Samsung Galaxy 2 tablet unless you will use the stylus and autofocus rear camera of the Samsung Galaxy NOTE.  I believe that Asus must work out a lot of bugs in their infinity before it is worthwhile!Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.  It performed as well as my first generation Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet until I tried to download the QuickMark app to scan bar and QR codes. According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an \"autofocus\" rear facing camera.  A phone call to Samsung tech support, and YES - Samsung BELIEVES in customer support at no extra charge, confirmed the absence of autofocus in the rear facing camera!  Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera.  However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.  I have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it. SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark. I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb. I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app. The Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet maintains strong wi-fi connection both anywhere in my home and at the school where I attend classes. Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card. I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable! I think there are also cell phone service compatible models at additional cost.Advice to tablet shoppers:1 - Buy from a source that allows easy returns without restocking fees. Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs. Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you. Try each one at least briefly.  NOTE any apps that are not compatible with the tablet you are testing. How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting. How do YOU find the brightness (usually adjustable, if auto-brightness does not work well for you), the contrast, the sharpness?4 - Log into your email account and/or create a Gmail account. Type an email to someone. Does the auto spelling correct work well for you? Is the virtual keyboard suited to your style and needs?5 - Play with the tablet for a whole day, if you can afford the luxury of sitting with it on. See how long the battery lasts.", "Title": "In MY opinion, not worth the price over the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 Tablet", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Author": "Leonaitis", "ReviewID": "R2IQ2G580J1RI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Brief intro:Here goes nothing. I took a while to publish this review because I wanted to try and experiment with my Note and to address all the pros and cons of the device that others have posted about. It would have been unfair if I had posted a glowing 5 star review after only owning it for one day. Likewise, it would not have been beneficial to anyone if I had just blasted the device without spending any time using it. I went ahead and tried to learn as much as I could about the Note once I got it. I tried every app, every function, every setting and accessory I could get my hands on. I tried to make notes of what others have said that they did not like about it. I wanted to see for myself if the problems they pointed out applied to me. I won't go into details about specs, or compare my Note to other devices. Sufficed to say, more than enough other people have posted such reviews. All I can say is that I have tried other tablets such as the iPad and even the Nexus 10 and I do not regret my purchase of my Note 10.1.Before you read any further, you should be aware of the learning curves of tablets in general and the Note 10.1 in particular.Learning Curves:Beginner - If you have never used a tablet device you will have a learning curve. You will need to learn how to maximize and minimize apps. You will need how to install apps and visit the app store. You will also have to realize that just because an app is bad, that does not mean the Note itself is at fault. Not every app maker takes the time to customize their products for every device and you need to be aware going in to this purchase that many apps are not maximized to work and be viewed perfectly on a tablet device. If you can handle the beginner learning curve, and teach yourself how to view Netflix and listen to music and play Angry Birds and you feel like your brain will explode from all the new things you had to learn, then you probably don't need a Note. If you don't want to do anything else beside these basic functions I would suggest you save some money and buy a Kindle Fire or a less expensive device. They will be more than powerful enough for what you need them to do. Don't get a Note and then complain it is over priced simply because you do not use it to its full potential.Advanced - If you learned all the basics about the Note, or have mastered these type of devices and are hungry for more, then get a Note. Keep in mind you will then have to spend more of your own precious free time to learn all the extra things this device can do. It will not magically do everything for you. Just because you get a Note does not mean you will magically be able to edit pictures in Photoshop or master handwriting tools and use the stylus by simply turning the device on. There is a steep learning curve and the manuals/tutorials included from Samsung are terribly bare. You will be left to your own to discover resources that help you take full advantage of your new device. Luckily for you, you can find tons of these resources out on the web!Here are a few of the pros and cons folks have posted about and what I found out.Pros (and some small concerns):-Auto rotate for most programs , Netflix, Internet, Facebook. Most apps will auto rotate for you. Great for when you want to view some websites or larger files in portrait mode. I noticed that some of the older apps do not auto rotate. Since I started using this a few have updated themselves and fixed the problem, but it varies by the app maker. I also noticed that a few of the newer apps that should rotate, did not. I then realized this happens mostly for apps that use the front facing camera. I guess it make sense for these apps to not allow you to use the Note upside down, otherwise your camera output to apps such as Skype would result in your face showing upside down to the person you would be chatting with at the time. For the most part this only caused one minor annoyance since I have been using the Note. Mainly, when I try and charge the Note while using it, the charging cable fits into the bottom of the device. I can't then go ahead and place the device on my lap because I will pinch the charging cable. So I just have to make sure not to charge the device while I am using a few camera specific apps. Not really a big bother though.- Store maps for offline use! Great app feature, specially since you don't have to find WiFi signal or use your phone's hotspot to update the map on long trips.- Streams from my home media server and allows me to access all my movies and music from anywhere in the house. Even the backyard.- WiFi works fine. I have no problems logging into both 2.4 and 5 networks. Even at the slower speed I am able to stream videos from my media server and apps such as Netflix with no lag whatsoever. I also connect to multiple WiFi networks at work and other locations and never have an issue trying to connect.- Cameras are not the best you will see out there but both work nice. Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great. I know folks always want the greatest and latest but the cameras are more than ample enough for everyday use. The stock app is ok but I prefer to use one I got from the app store. More about this later.- TV remote works great. I am able to control not only my home TV and cable but also my folks TV and their satellite service from my tablet. Needless to say it took them a few visits until they realized I was the one messing with their channels and they were indeed not going crazy!- HDMI output works great but no subtitles! The HDMI out adapter is a bit confusing. You actually have to plug your wall charger into it then then to the TV and once that is done it works great! I am able to save some of my movie files on my Note for offline viewing on long trips and can then output the movie to an HDMI input on any TV. Works great. There is one drawback though and this seems to be universal across most tablet makers. If you are viewing a website and decide to export it to the TV for better viewing, the Note will not export any subtitles. You can see them just fine on the Note, but not on the TV. I have asked Samsung about this but not have had a definite reply yet. It should not matter if you don't use subtitles though.- Overall performace is great. I can open multiple apps, multi task items and even have a pop up video playing at the same time and have no performance issues. I did test out one of these Notes at an electronics retailer that had the old Android OS and it was not as fast as the one I got. The latest upgrade really helped performance. I have no complaints in this department.Cons:-Not all programs can be multitasked. Samsung is bringing out new software patch for phones that will allow multi task on all apps for their newer phones, maybe it will trickle down to the Note. However, I like the real estate on my Note. I am not sure how many items I would like opened at once.-If charging while using an app that doesn't auto rotate, charging cable sticks out the bottom. Very inconvenient location.Apps:Here are some the of the apps I use. Most are free, some are not.- S Note exports to jpg and PDF file formats. However, the handwriting takes time to learn. I was having a rough time of it at first but then messed around with the stylus settings and sensitivity and can whip out notes of all kinds with no troubles. I also adore the S Note feature that ignores your hand if it accidentally touches the tablet surface when using the S pen. Otherwise, I would have smudges on every document I have writen so far. There is a small learning curve for this app. Do not despair.- PS Touch is awesome! Takes a larger than normal learning curve though. I found 2 great channels on Youtube where the users teach you various functions of this app step by step. It is great to sit in front of the TV and watch someone use the features of this app in real life while you practice on your Note and master them. If you use Photoshop on your PC then you will be glad to know the menus and options for this app are very similar to the PC versions so you are already ahead of the game. It is not a full blown version but pretty good nonetheless.- Dropbox is great for multiple devices. I have my phone, computers and Note linked to the same account. I like being able to take pictures on my phone and then being able to pull them up and edit them on my tablet. Once done I can toss them back and have access to them from any of my devices or PC's. Also great for moving files back and forth without having to plug my Note into my PC.- Amazon has two apps. One for their store and one for their apps. The regular Amazon app tracks your Amazon purchases and tracks packages, pretty neat if you use Amazon a lot. However,the Amazon App store offers free apps everyday. I have snagged several apps from this site for free and saved a few bucks from having to get them off the Google Play store. It uses your Amazon credentials so I like the fact that you don't have to enter additional financial info in order to pay for items from the Google Play Store. Also, every app I have looked at seems to be 40-50% cheaper on the Amazon app site than on Play Store. I have this app and log into it every day to see what goodies they are giving away. I don't like the fact it is not part of the main Amazon app but it is still great for getting free stuff!- Kindle book reader. Great for reading books, I love the settings and while I would not get a Note just for reading books, it is a great addition for an item I was already getting regardless.- Netflix works flawless. Also, if you have Netflix on an external device such as PS3, you can bring that up and log into Netflix on your Note and you can acutally use it as a remote and control your Netflix through your Note. Handy little trick that was added to android devices recently.- Pocket Cloud is used for VPN connections. I am not sure if most folks would use the VPN feature on the Note but I use it to connect to my work on the weekends sometimes. I then fire up Pocket Cloud and bam! I am logged into my workstation back at my work desk and can access and run everything just as if I was sitting at my desk.- SuperGNES. Yea, what can I say. A free SNES player that allows me to download free ROMS and play some Zelda to unwind once in a while. Purely for nostalgia purposes though.- Skype I use mainly to call overseas and to have my mom do video chatting with her grandkids up in Ohio. They love it and it works great. Even better since it is free.- Video Player that comes with it by default is pretty nice. Plays multiple video formats and is able to pick up my home media servers and stream from them.- Youtube is a great tool to use. I love to have it up and running and be able to control it from my couch. Yes, like the Netflix app, android users can log into youtube from your device and control playback as well as manage lists and favorites and other preferences. I love it because when you have to search for items it is way easier to type into the Note than trying to navigate through the bulky and not very user friendly text input of my media devices.- ezPDF Reader is better than just about every other PDF app I tested. Amazon has given this one away for free before on their APP store so keep an eye out. It lets you add notes and tons of other features to your PDF files. Works with the S Pen.- Camera Zoom FX is a step up from the built in camera app included with your Note. It has some handy camera features and filters that are not included natively on your Note and too much of a pain to apply to your pictures once they have been taken. This app does it while taking the shots. Great time saver.Notes: Some observations I have made.- Some apps dont work as well as the full website, it is best to just go to the full website instead. This is for android apps in general, not just on the Note.  However, some sites force you into a 'mobile view'. They look pretty horrible and are pretty useless. Make sure you force your Note browser into 'desktop view' and you will be able to view the full site and use all features on it just fine.- Battery charge. I used it regularly to access web, Skype, few apps and some note writing using the S pen as well as messing around with some videos and pictures. I could go about 3 days or so before I realized I needed to charge the unit. Overall not too bad for what I was making it do. I went ahead and tested it over a few weekends of heavy use to see how it handled the load. I opened videos, web, several apps I did not need and multi tasked to my hearts content. Using this heavy load I was able to run the battery down in about 8 hours. Your charges may vary, but I was overdoing it to test it for myself. As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging. So yes, you can fully charge it while using it. Just be aware, you will NOT be able to charge this baby by simply plugging the charging cable into the USB port of your computer. You can transfer files but the power output from standard USB ports is not strong enough to power the Note. You will need a direct connection to a wall outlet.Accessories:- Screen protector and a tablet leather case are a must. You need to keep this baby safe. I tried many cases and screen protectors before I settled on mine. HDMI out works nice. Just make sure you plug it in properly. Car adapter can come in handy. However, I had a bit of misfortune on the first one I purchased. Aside from that it works well.  The charging cable that comes with the unit is very short and does not let you charge the unit while using it unless you sit next to the wall outlet. Get a larger one for charging and use the small one for Note to PC transfers.*** Special Note***SD cards! I was at the Samsung site yesterday and someone asked the maximum size of the SD cards that can be used with the Note 10.1. The Samsung rep answered \"32GB\". This is wrong. I am running a 64GB card and it works great. I have more than one and have the extra ones filled with movies for long boring trips. Since the latest Android update these cards are automatically found by your Note 10.1. Prior to this update you had to go through a painful process of formatting 32Gb and 64GB cards to get them to properly show up. I think that is why Samsung kept folks from trying out the 64GB cards. They work fine! Make sure you get the right ones though and be careful with the hassle free packaging ones offered by Amazon. Buy the retails ones instead.I have written reviews on the types of accessories I ended up purchasing. I did much research on all of them. One thing I suggest you do is to be careful about your vendor. I had no problems with any of my accessories except one. The rest work great and are Samsung brand items. If you are worried about getting some of the accessories here, go to the Samsung site and register your product. After a few days they will send you a complimentary loyalty coupon that gives you 50% any and every accessory for your Note. (At least they did for me) It is a one time deal though. This makes the prices much more compatible with Amazon and takes the worry out of getting the right item that will work. I have only had one small problem with an Amazon item and I have been shopping from this site for many years. I find Amazon to be very dependable. Please read the reviews (good and bad) on every item in order to make an informed decision.Response to other reviews:Here are some notes I added to address the concerns others had when they reviewed their Notes.-KIES - I am not sure what to make of this. Folks complain about this sayging it doesn't work, while others say it works fine. I use it on my S III, a few PC's and my Note and have no issues. I installed it because my Windows 7 PC would not properly identify my Note until KIES was installed. I have no issues.-Saumsung is slow to push updates. I have heard this complaint many times. I would have to say I agree with this comment. Samsung is one of the slowest companies when it comes to pushing updates. They could easily just push out the latest Android builds after a few tweaks but noooooooo, not Samsung. They take forever to push these out. However, once they do push them out they add so many extra features than just the stock Android builds! My last phone update took a bit to get here but it improved battery life immensely and added a few tweaks that made the phone even better. The last update for the Note improved performance all around, as well as battery life and many added new features for free. Also improved SD card compatibility. I can hardly wait for their next update which has even more features in store! Oh wait, I can wait, because I have no other choice. They are are slow...- It is hard to bring up apps from background? Tap the app button and the list comes up much like task manager. You can then bring up any previously opened app. It is located right next to the home button. What is so hard about that? Want to turn off apps? Open the App widget and tap away at what you want to turn off. I run my Note with tons of items running all over the place nad it doesn't affect battery life much. I am not sure why some folks are bothered by this but in my extensive testing I didnt find any unused open apps affected my battery life or charge times.- S Note has a small space to write in. You can't fit that much on a page? Some have said this, but it  scrolls down fine for me. I am able to use all the functions. It did take me a while to practice and get used to how it works though. It works fine for me now that I practiced. However, I had no idea what I was doing the first time. It is a learning curve and I think folks expect it to work like other programs they have tried before?- Folks have said their passwords are saved in the browser. Once I changed the settings it never saved them for me. So I was unable to replicate this issue.- The learning curve can be steep for some items. Hard to find tutorials or guides. I have to agree with this comment. Manuals and guides are virtually non-existent for the Note and the built in apps. However, with a little bit of searching you can find them online. The best so far have been the dozens of you tube channels on every app that I have looked for. It takes some effort to get started though. They will not be hand delivered to you.-Flash upgrade! Many folks complain about the lack of Flash on your Note. This was a decision made by Adobe. They are getting away from all Flash development for mobile devices. Flash was too buggy and caused performance issues so Adobe just decided to stop supporting it and move on to HTML5. It pains me to see how many people post and blast Samsung for this. It was not a Samsung decision. With that said, if you go to the Adobe site and look up the archived Adobe files section, you will be able to download and install Flash 4.x for your Note that works just fine with every website I have been to so far.I love my Note. I would not get one for my mom. It is more than she needs. I would get her a Kindle. It doesn't mean I don't love her.:)Make sure you do your research!If you have any questions about anything leave a comment and I will try to answer if I can.", "Title": "My Note 10.1 Compendium", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Author": "Carol A. Anderson", "ReviewID": "R3N98LP74WTNLB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update after 2 months:UPDATE after 4 months:Samsung is releasing whole new software suite, see comments for link,10 minute video of all the new stuff.I have mostly positive things to say. I actually found out that it will not only run split screens plus 5 apps like I mentioned but up to 11.The screen resolution is NOT an issue at all. Only with the poorest of feeds will the display show up as fuzzy. The speaker stereo separation is fantastic. I didn't really notice until I played an audio book and heard how noticeable the separation actually was. I added while docked, each of my 5 different portable speakers to the back of the dock and the tablet speakers sounded better.Cons: I noticed that when using the Chrome browser, that with too many tabs open, like over 12, the cut and paste quite working and the browser froze. This forced a total reset. I finally exchanged the tablet. Same problem again. So I gave up using the Chrome browser, and not a problem one since then. So not the tablet per say, but it and chrome just don't play nice when used so heavily. With the included tablet browser, after too many open tabs, a warning notice comes up and instructs to close a tab before opening another. That's it. Love Love Love this tablet, a lot to learn but worth the price of admission imho.I have been addicted to tablets for a couple of years now. I have stayed away from Apple products for personal reasons. So Android at this time is the best bet for me. I tried a Windows tablet last year and they were not ready for my needs at that time. The ones that might, cost over $1200 or more. I spend at least 6 hours a day on a tablet. I have owned 8 Android Tablets and one Windows tablet. I still have 4 Androids.I started with a $149 K-Mart tablet and went all the way to the $600 Asus Infinity TF700T.Asus TF700T, I know the Asus TF700 is a great tablet. I bought the only one on Amazon that was defective.No choice but to return. I just have bad luck sometimes. But it turned out OK in the end. I was able to wait for this one.I have a Galaxy Note i717 5.3\" cell phone and I love it, they call it the \"phablet \"but really it is too small for a tablet and more a supersized phone. But I love the display and the S Pen. So after watching MobileTechReviews, You Tube, of Lisa showing all the features of this tablet and her doing a smack down, with this tablet and the Asus TF700 Infinity, I made the decision to buy this one.I am very happy I did.***Full Samsung video review, live links are not permitted in reviews. So to see them, click on add comments below.The first one shows the videos.Pros: 1) It shares speed honors for all Android tablet with the Asus TF700 they are too close to call. Each winning battles back and forth for sheer power and speed.2)It has split screen functions, meaning you can do two things side my side at the same time. Like read your email and do a web search on two separate screens yet on the same display screen. No other tablet can do that.3)It has a very strong WiFi modem, it pulls in signal my other tablets don't.Nice Nice Nice.4)It is one of the few tablets that pulls Wifi from both the 2.4 and the 5 bands. Exceptional.5) The touch screen is extremely sensitive and it takes only the slightest of touch to registeryour input. I think because of the S Pen's needs for sensitive touch of over 1,000 ranges. I mean this touchscreen is the best I have ever used or touched.It tracks you finger movement extremely tightly.No noticeably lag, it is like the item you are moving is stuck to your finger. Most if not all Android tablets have some lag. So good job Samsung on that.6) It has picture in picture video. You can run a movie on any screen and your can move the movie box around any where on your display surface. You can re-size it if it gets in the way. The display has settings like a TV or monitor, you adjust the color and tone.7) It has a feature called Smart Stay, which is basicly a little eye that watches your eye. If you fall asleep watching a video, it shuts off. In the morning it has your place saved in the video where it shut off at. Nice feature for me.8) It will handle up to a Micro 64GB SDXC storage card which writes up to 30mbps, really adding lots of extra storage since most tablets only support 32GB. Ipad and Nexus 7 don't support any on board.9) It has a decent front camera for video chat, and the a decent rear camera with a flash, tablets are not cameras but this one is above average.10) It has the S Pen, meaning your can write, draw and lots lots lots more.11) The software is unique to this tablet only, meaning you can do things on this tablet no other tablet can do. There are some others, older, that have some features similar but not close to this guy.12) It will convert your printing or hand writing into text. It plots and solves equations.13) It will convert your hand drawn circles and squares to proper ones, making your look good. It just has too many features to list with the S Pen.14) It comes with PhotoShop software and the only limit is your imagination.15) It has front facing speakers like all tablets should have.16) It comes in White and it is lite and attractive and with 2GBs of Ram and a 1.4 Samsung Quad Core, it is one of the fastest tablets on the market and only $499..Compare to the Excite 7.7 and it is easy to see the value.17) It will handle HDMI to a big screen and USB keyboards, mice, game controllers, external hard drives, I have have tried a 500GB external hard drive, and it should do even larger, just pickup the adapters. Not expensive at all.18) It has a real GPS. Works without WiFi. Blue Tooth and so much more...19) It has too many Pros to list, really, I only scratched the surface. Oh, it is also an IR remote control for you home TV system, even controls cable or Direct TV, it learns your favorite shows and suggests them to you. Too much, for sure...love it...Oh, and if you have other Samsung products, like a Galaxy S 3, it talks to them as well with All Share...neat...it also has a very deluxe battery monitor system that has 4 sections with lots of graphs and setting and over heat warnings to get extra months of battery life.I later watched a Samsung 10 minute and he showed multi-tasking up to 5 functions at once. Email and Polaris on the 2 split screens,then adding picture in picture video on top of those two adding the calculator and another pop up screen, over the 4 programs already opens. 5 open screens at once on and Android SupervTablet.VersusCons: 1) It gets a knock for only having a 1280x800 resolution display screen, but, really it has adjustments like a TV has and your can set picture settings. So no, it doesn't have Retina, but it does just fine without it. Since not many apps support those hi resolution displays anyway. It could not be priced at $499 if it had all it has, plus the over the top display. This one is just fine, and I am fussy. Speaking of fussy, since I do go back and forth with multiple tablets, the two things that keep this tablet from being 100% perfect for me are simple. The blacks are fine but could be deeper. The whites are fine but could be whiter. While using this tablet I don't notice this. When I switch back to another of my tablets, I am reminded of this fact.However,once I pick up this tablet, I forget all about it and just enjoy it for all it's features.2) This is not an iPad, so it takes some effort to get the most out of it, so expect a learning curve for the S Pen, but it can be used as a basic Android tablet if you want to GROW into it. If you are a person with no computer skills, it may be a bit much for you. Then again, you can just use what you understand. Emails, videos, Facebook, Web Browsing, and you can have a lot of fun playing with the pen3) Double edge sword, the good it will fully charge on a 5v source like a USB port or 5v power block, the bad is it takes up to 5 hours to charge. So best to charge at night. In contrast my Asus charges in 2 hour 15 minutes but on 5v and turned off, it will only charge 50% all night because it's wall charger is 12-15v.4) The biggest CON is it took so long to get here.....Signed Happy New Owner...Cheers", "Title": "My 8th Tablet and My Favorite by Far", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Author": "DaveC2000 \"davec2000\"", "ReviewID": "R1MMH3VSUXV7N9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Some quick first impressions of the Note 10.1 - This tablet is what the Transformer Prime should have been. I really don't see a ton of value in the S-Pen YET, but hopefully this feature will evolve and become a key strength.General touch responsiveness - GOOD - scrolling home screens is much more responsive than the Galaxy Tab 2, very close to the responsiveness of the Transformer Prime.Web Surfing - VERY GOOD - Page loads are very fast, much faster than the Galaxy Tab 2, very similar to ipad2 speeds. Scrolling is fast.Screen - FAIRLY GOOD - Same screen as Galaxy Tab 2. Similar to ipad 2. Not as nice as the new higher resolution tablets.I/O Performance - GREAT - RL Benchmark of 21 seconds... blows the doors off of ASUS & Nexus 7.The Pen - UNDECIDED - For taking notes with OCR the S Note app does not seem like it will be able to keep up with a keyboard and Evernote. The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time. Included S Pen does not have the eraser side seen in some online videos.Gaming - VERY GOOD - Frame rates are fantastic, touch and accelerometer responsiveness seem great. HUGE improvement over G Tab 2.Compass - Worked great. Seems very accurate.WiFi - Seems to have strong reception and fast throughput throughout the house.GPS - Strong reception, quickly got accuracy to 20 feet indoors.Sound Quality - VERY GOOD - The front speakers are really nice for a tablet. You should have not issues covering the speakers with your hands.Build Quality - GOOD - Nice fit and finish, no loose parts, no surprises. Still feels a bit plasticy, not as nice as ipad.Software - Everything seems to run without any hiccups, more polished and less buggy than what I've seen on Asus tablets.Let me know if there are any other aspects you'd like to get feedback on to help you make your decision on this tablet.", "Title": "Initial Impressions", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Author": "HoushaSen", "ReviewID": "RKIOCBP4HWGMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "============= Updates ================9/15/2012Final Decision - I ended up choosing Infinity.  Please see updated conclusion section. Also updated Battery section to Tie because I finally got transformer dock and had to change my mind of what I said before.9/3/2012Week 2 update1. S-pen - So I still don't use this feature, but just for fun I tried.  Quickly, this is the closest to paper as it can get.  See the updated section of \"handwriting\".2. Windows 8 Tablets - Since recent IFA Berlin showed several upcoming Windows 8 tablet, I have decided to give a quick comparison to them.3. Future Potential - During IFA Berlin, Samsung announced the Jellybean update on the Galaxy Note 10.1 is coming \"very soon (changed from this year).\" & showed many cool features of upcoming Galaxy Note 2 (handheld) device features, which most likely be included in the Galaxy Note 10.1 as well.  See Future potential section for detail.8/24/2012After one full week of use, here is quick update.1. Stability - The stability of this system is amazing.  I had only a single crush of stock browser, which at this point could even be my error of clicking pushing button by accident.  Even on the iPad 2, I still had at least 1 or 2 freeze/crush every other day or so.  So this is actually the most stable tablet/system I have ever used.2. Lack of HD Screen - After 1 week of use, I had hoped that I would forget about my experience with HD Screen on Transformer Infinity.  Unfortunately this isn't the case. Whenever I browse and open a web page, I simply have to zoom in to be able really read things, which again wasn't the case with HD screen.  So yes. it is really noticeable.At this point, I can say basically Galaxy Note 10.1 is pretty much superior to transformer infinity in every aspect except HD screen.  However, the screen is one of the major point so the choice still remains to be a bit hard.  But once experiencing the stability & speed of Galaxy Note 10.1, I don't think I can go back to infinity or any other android tablet that gives us freeze or crush every hour.============= Vs. Upcoming Windows 8 Tablets ============I was actually hoping with IFA, at least one of windows 8 tablet announced be my dream system i.e. customizability & flexibility of android, solid 8+ hours battery life, portability, stability, speed and full HD screen.In short, no system met this criteria.  The major systems are ASUS Vivo series and Samsung ativ series.  Among these, only Samsung Ativ Smart Pro is the only one has full HD screen that Galaxy Note 10.1 lacks. However, this system like other full Windows 8 edition tablets are much heavier, battery life is mere 5 hours DVD play time, and price is over $1100.Other tablets that are portable, and has good battery life are usually Windows RT versions.  Given how stable Android OS on Galaxy Note 10.1, stability is no longer comparison point.  Just like iOS vs. Android, it becomes applications.  Windows RT edition only runs Metro specific applications.  Though they will certainly grow, it will likely to take sometime.  Given the rapid change in the technology, if you decide to buy a system with a hope that the application will come, you may end up not enjoying your system as by the time applications flourish on the metro market, there may be better spec systems with cheaper price.  Furthermore, it appears no Windows RT based system have stylus support.So in conclusion, though windows 8 tablet are not inferior by any means, there is no upcoming windows 8 tablet at this point can say \"absolutely better\" than the Galaxy Note 10.1 or even Transformer Infinity.  Both tablet have still their own places and target audiences.============= Original Review Below =====================Quick background of myself, I had recently purchased transformer infinity as upgrade from my ipad 2, and Samsung galaxy 10.1 4G.  It was a great tablet of its own, but had couple major negatives for the purpose of my use.  So I had to seek for alternative.  Given my relative unhappiness with Galaxy 10.1 original and 4G, I was a bit skeptical about Galaxy Note 10.1 but decided to give a chance.  The result after 3 days of use is \"amazing.\"  This should be the flagship/standard of Android tablet.In the review of Transformer infinity, I have discussed about iOS ecosystem vs. Android ecosystem.  In here, I am actually going to focus on comparing to the transformer infinity, which is by many major review sites rated as the best android tablet.  And I see several people are considering this vs. the infinity.WARNING: Do not trust some reviews you read on the websites.  I just do not experience/see the issues what some reviewers are saying.============  Summary ===============Compared to transformer infinityStrength+Stability+Speed+Audio/SpeakerWeakness-No HD screen-Samsung's very slow software update-UITie*Battery Life*Build Quality*Overall hardware spec*Future potentialNote: I did not mention S-pen nor multitasking here because I personally don't use S-pen, and multitasking is good but you can do pretty much the same with applications on the market on any android device.Conclusion:Do you want android tablet?Are you ok with not having HD display?Can you afford the price?If yes to all three, then this is the tablet to get.===========  Detail Review ================1. StabilityThis is in fact the biggest selling point of this tablet.  I was always under the impression that by choosing Android ecosystem over the iOS, one thing we have to give up is the stability.  So when I initially got the infinity, I had a hope but the hope of stability quickly went away.  Browser crushed/froze every hour or so.  Other applications also froze and crushed.  In android world, I guess it's called application not responding (ANR) error.  I don't think infinity had any more of ANR than the my old Galaxy 10.1 but definitely did not seem less.To my surprise, Galaxy Note 10.1 is actually extremely stable.  In fact, I have used so far approximately 20-30 hours and have not encountered a single ANR nor crush.  Having stable Android system is just an amazing.Winner: Galaxy Note 10.12. ScreenIf you have never used HD display tablet such as New Ipad, transformer Infinity or ACER Iconia A700, you would probably not notice.  But after using them for awhile, the sharpness of text produced by these high definition screen are certainly noticeable.  With infinity, i can load a page and without zooming in, I can basically read entire page because resolution is so good.  But with Galaxy Note, everything look somewhat blurry so I have to zoom in to really read.This is a huge disadvantage of Galaxy Note. And perhaps, the reason why every other aspect on Galaxy Note is better than Infinity because it does not have to drive HD.  If you need HD screen android tablet, you have to go with transformer infinity.  Even there is not much HD specific applications right now, you will notice the difference on every day use.Winner: Transformer Infinity3. SpeedAfter doing some custom tweek on my infinity, browsing on infinity became much faster (at least so it seemed).  When it is at maximum speed, infinity and galaxy browser loaded pages in equal speed.  I tested this by simply going to the same site at same time for couple pages.  But after couple hours of use, infinity browser always seemed to slow down or crush.  This does not depend on which browser I used stock, chrome, opera, firefox beta, dolphin beta etc.  The benchmark sort of show this.  Sunspider benchmark of infinity was decently fast so browser should be fast, which again it was when working.  But Galaxy Note 10.1's sunspider result is simply in another dimension.  It's even faster than new iPad.  Since stock is so well on the Galaxy Note, I have not really tried much else on galaxy note.Another example is I use Mantano Reader for my ebook reading. With infinity, I could not open couple files.  One was 50MB, the other was 400MB.  It simply took forever and gave me ANR.  If lucky and got it working after awhile, it only showed couple pages and then crush.  I sent email to Mantano asking for fix as I could not believe with such high spec on the Infinity can be an issue.  In fact, some files larger than 50MB opened fine on the Mantano.  Furthermore, other PDF applications such as Repligo, Adobe Reader opened these files fine as well.  So I had good reasons to blame on application itself.  But the same file opens instantaneously on Galaxy Note  and obviously no crush or ANR.So despite infinity being fast system on its own, I have to give this one also to Galaxy Note.Winner: Galaxy Note 10.14. Audio/SpeakerSpeaker on the infinity was simply a weakness.  So any system can win over this.  I am not expert on sound system, so all I cared was whether I can hear sound loud enough.  With infinity, some of my video files were only barely audible even with maximum sound setting if there are any background sounds.  This was different from any other tablet I owned.  Galaxy Note 10.1 is just like others I have no problem hearing sounds.  It is what I expected.With infinity I had issue on listening to video file that was on the microsd using headset.  Every minute or two, I hear small but definitely noticeable \"beep beep.\" This was fixed by copying files locally to the device. But this sort of defeats the purpose of microsd...  This issue is not there with Galaxy Note.  So I can keep video files on microsd.Winner: Galaxy Note 10.15. Software UpdateNo one can beat ASUS.  Their reputation on the software update is the best of all android tablet maker.  In fact, they have already released jelly bean on one of transformer line.  So it probably won't be too long for infinity either.  This will for surely be true for OS after jellybean as well.  In addition, Nexus 7 is made by ASUS and has very similar specification to transformer prime, so future proof in terms of software update on infinity is the best on the market.In comparison, Samsung is one of the worst in terms of software update.  One main reason is that they make their own touch wiz customization.  The original samsung galaxy 10.1 just recently got ice cream sandwich.  Samsung announced that Galaxy Note will be getting Jellybean by end of the year, so we will get it but I don't count on the time.  As far as the OS after Jellybean, who knows we may get it but that would be even further down the road and it may even become irrelevant at the point.Winner: Transformer InfinityHowever, there is a catch on this.  If the actual software is working perfectly, do we really need/care newer OS?  I was looking forward to Jellybean when I had infinity because I thought it would make the system faster, and possibly more stable.  However, Galaxy Note is already extremely fast, and perfect stability.  So I am not sure if I am much to look forward to in Jellybean.6. User InterfaceTransformer Infinity uses near stock interface.  Their widgets are very clean.  I loved their transparent weather, and date widget.  Touch Wiz on the other hand, I don't think as pretty.  Samsung Weather widget just don't fit well. This may be personal preference though.Winner: Transformer Infinity7. Build QualityThe actual external appearance of the tablet goes to infinity.  The metallic Zen design is really great.  It does look like expensive tablet.  On the other hand, Samsung has plastic and I even had my port plastic broken one time on my Galaxy 10.1 4G. Clearly, it is not common place for accidental damage as it is simply so hard to break the piece by intention.  But Samsung totally refused to fix it and asked for $100 to fix this even though I only had the tablet for 5 months.  So I am skeptical for the durability of plastic tablet.However, quality assurance seems better on Samsung. I had to try two Infinity.  Both had light bleed, one had loose screen i.e. I can get click sound by pressing corner, sticking button (first one was volume, second one was power).  According to XDA forum, this was very prevalent issue and pretty much most people had one or other.  Galaxy Note I have none of these, and seemed like forum is also pointing to the same direction with very minimal complain on these matters.Winner: Tie8. Battery LifeThis is one feature I could not tolerate initially with infinity.  It lasted 5 hours if I use browser.  If I play game, it lasted only 3 hours.  Watching video or reading ebook without any browsing is the only way to get close to 9.5 hours documented on the specification.  But in reality, I always surf net, so generally I could never get more than 6 hours from 100% full charge.  Galaxy Note's battery life is amazing.  Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.  Second time 9 hours of screen time including 2 hours of gaming, 3 hours of constant almost pure browsing, 2+ hours of local video, and rest are ebook reading, I still have 30% battery left.  This will undoubtedly gives me 10+ hours of browsing time.  In fact, I am guessing this can even give 12+ hours easily unless I play game.  Even with gaming probably 8-9 hours.Some review claims battery hours on this much shorter, or even compatible to infinity.  My guess on this is they only either compared video play not included browsing but even then the number won't much.  So most likely explanation is they used 3G version of Galaxy Note 10.1.In any event, battery life on Galaxy Note is simply amazing.  When comparing tablet to tablet, without a question Galaxy Note is better.  However, this becomes a bit more complicated with Infinity's selling feature which is extra battery containing docking station.  I did not realize the power of docking station until I actually purchased one.  But if I do not want to carry around extra-weight, I can simply think the docking station as a battery charger.  I can do something like use as tablet at work, then connect to dock when get a chance/want to use as laptop/watch video.  Even while I use the tablet recharges from the dock's battery.  As I drive back, the tablet continues recharge from the dock.  So by the time I go back home, I am ready to use the tablet for night time reading.  All I need is recharge the dock and essentially I can completely eliminate the time to wait for tablet getting charged though with Galaxy Note's extra long battery life, this may not be frequent issue.Winner: Tie9. Overall Hardware SpecificationThis is technical aspect.  No matter what the specification is, in the end user experience is everything; however, hardware spec can definitely affect the experience.  Generally speaking two are similar with one better on one regard but other on the other.CPU: Tie - Atuntu scores are basically the same.GPU: Samsung Galaxy Note - Galaxy Note has the best GPU in any of Android tablet on the market right now.  Still not up to the level of the new Ipad.  Given it has to push less pixels compared to infinity, stronger GPU further makes difference.  Having said this, I don't think there is any application on android market currently that pushes to their graphical limit.  So not sure if extra GPU power make much difference.I/O: Samsung Galaxy Note - Supposedly I/O issue has been discussed on transformer series before infinity.  But infinity still has it. It had improved with the latest firmware, but not solved.  There is speculation that this is indeed hardware level of issue i.e. can go only so much.  The speculation is coming from XDA developer who tested running things off of highspeed SD card gave much boost in the function when compared to local storage i.e. Flash storage is the conundrum.  This is reflected on the benchmark.  The infinity had RL benchmark score of 80-90's with the latest firmware (originally like 120's).  Galaxy Note has 20's. This actually does affect daily use as you save file, access file all requires reading and writing from flash drive.  Obviously, infinity is not 4 times slower than Galaxy Note but this may be reason why my PDF file opened fine on Mantano with Galaxy Note but not on Infinity.Memory: Samsung Galaxy Note - 2GB.  Since most tablet still has 1GB memory, we won't likely to see anything that require 2GB memory for awhile.  So it is only helpful when opening multiple applications i.e. you may be able to cache more application than before but otherwise, I am not sure if this helps much.Screen: Transformer Infinity - See above.In any event, both hardwares are the best in the market right now.  If these two system cannot handle any more update, application etc. then pretty much nothing else on the market can handle them any more either.  So as far as hardware goes, both are relatively future proof.10. Future PotentialASUS, the maker of Infinity, makes Nexus 7 and again it has similar spec as the infinity's ancestor transformer prime.  So it should have good support from Google as well as future application makers. Furthermore, recently ASUS became of the playstation partner.  So you will likely to see playstation games on it.Galaxy Note 10.1 on the other hand is made by Samsung, who makes one of the most popular smartphone Samsung Galaxy Series.  Since Galaxy Note and SIII etc. uses Exynos CPU design and the number of unit sold are so high, android software developers will/should continue support them and hence, also supporting Galaxy Note 10.1.Update (9/3):  Samsung just recently announced it is bringing Jellybean to Galaxy Note 10.1 \"very soon.\"  No solid time here, but compared to \"this year\", this sounds much more imminent.  Only the time will tell, but it would be interesting how quickly Samsung can make the update to change its reputation here.More interestingly, Galaxy Note 2 (handheld) device was just recently officially announced by Samsung.  This device is very similar to the Galaxy Note 10.1.  So new features coming to the Galaxy Note 2 is highly likely to be added to Galaxy Note 10.1 as well.  If you are interested in seeing what these features are, search for [GALAXY Note II] First Hands-on Video by Samsung on Youtube.  These features appear very unique (at least to me).Winner: Tie11. HandwritingFor those of you who thinks S-pen is just another stylus, it is not.  You can never write as small on iPad, or Infinity because simply technology is different.  So those who wants to have closest to the real pen and paper experience, you need inductive pen device like Galaxy Note.Updated 9/3/2012Coming from the background of looking into tablet PC when still relatively new (back windows XP era), one thing I can say to test whether stylus/pen on screen truly work or not is write as small as you can and see if the tablet can recognize your writing.  The conventional touch screen tablet like iPad, most of android tablet including transformer infinity, you will quickly notice the smallest you can write is not so small.  You have some applications to convert your bigger drawn handwriting into smaller text, but it certainly is not same experience as you were to write on the paper.Since I had time with this tablet, I had a chance to try this.  Well, the smallest the tablet recognizes is the smallest I can write.  So in this sense, Samsung did phenomenal job.  Perhaps, this may be the reason why they could not include full HD screen.Winner: Galaxy Note==============  Other less important features =================Other things that I personally don't think much important are followings:1. Split ScreenThere are many applications on the Google Play that already allows you to watch video, browse web, take note etc. while opening other window.  So it is nice to include as a free feature and emphasize such feature exist, but Galaxy Note's built in applications are limited to certain applications.  For instance, I cannot use built in browser to watch flash movie while I read ebook.  However, if I buy overskreen I can do that.  And overskreen is supported on transformer infinity as well.  So I don't think split screen should be decision maker for anyone.2. Keyboard dockThis is mainly the feature of transformer series.  But samsung does make keyboard dock.  Galaxy Note 10.1 version is not out yet, but it is in process.  The difference is that Galaxy Note one (probably) won't have extra battery.  But I don't think it needs that as by tablet alone it can last so long and probably even longer than Infinity with dock.  Form factor goes to the transformer as it attaches and closes like laptop.  My personal opinion about this is, it doesn't really make difference.  If I need keyboard I can still carry it.  The total weight is the same. So another factor, I don't think should be decision maker.=============== Conclusion ==================Update 9/15/2012Galaxy Note 10.1 is phenomenal device with its stability, speed, and extra function of S-pen.Galaxy Note and Transformer Infinity are definitely two of the best Android tablet on the market at this time.  Though all the major reviews only giving credit to Infinity, if you use Galaxy Note 10.1 you will know its power, speed and stability, which are even better than that of Infinity.  However, I have ended up choosing transformer infinity.  Because even when Galaxy Note is superior in pretty much every other aspect to Infinity except the screen, the full HD screen turned out to be such an major feature that infinity has(=note lacks).  I read ebook, surf web, and watch videos.  Basically, every second that I look at screen for these tasks I noticed the difference in screen resolution.  Though not to the level of the Note, with tweaks I got my infinity browsing speed faster, and system more stable. After these tweaks, these difference are only wastes several minutes a day of my time in the end i.e. accumulation of 10 seconds difference in loading flash heavy site, system force close/ANR 2-3 times more than Galaxy Note add up extra time of waiting for page to load and relaunching applications.It is not easy decision to make. You just need to weight what is important to you.", "Title": "The best tablet not because of S-pen nor multitask (compared to transformer infinity)", "Date": "August 19, 2012"}, {"Author": "syngeek \"pixel385\"", "ReviewID": "R1UBWS805U1INN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my very first tablet and I love it so much!!I visited this tablet at my local electronics shop many times, read reviews, looked at available software, and even the reviews for the software prior to deciding to buy my Note. I've had it for about a month now and I thought I should share my experience so far for anyone else who's doing their homework before buying.I am a grad student. I've been carrying a laptop and tons of papers around for some time now. I had notebooks for random notes from meetings, TODO lists, and ideas. Notes from my classes, handouts, papers which I printed just so I could mark them up. Oh, can't forget the assortment of pens and pencils for that marking up. I also had all of my meetings and schedule info set up in my phone's calendar so I could have something beep at me with a reminder no matter what... with my schedule, forgetting things is very easy.The Samsung Note changed everything.I was initially excited about this product because of the Wacom stylus. I used to do professional graphic art and I loved my Wacom digitizer tablet. Anything less than that level of quality just won't cut it once you've experienced their tablets. I was tempted to try an iPad when I saw another student was able to take notes with that marker thing, but I'm so glad I waited and looked at the Note. Wacom really dominates and the quality just can't be beat.The pre-installed apps are pretty good, though I can see ways to make them better. I love S Note and use it for all of my note taking needs. The way it integrates with the calendar/todo list app is particularly nice. I can take meeting notes where I'm given some task to do, then click to \"Create Event\" which will let me attach the note to a new event on my calendar or todo list, complete with reminders, groups, prioritization, etc.. S Note with Calendar is so useful, it alone nearly made the purchase worthwhile.Another great feature of S Note (though the interface could seriously be improved) is the ability to recognize handwritten math functions, then look them up on Wolfram Alpha. I'm a CS student and I find that pretty useful and cool. The only trick to it is that it wants to open the browser in split screen mode. If you already have the browser in split screen mode, it doesn't work. Just close the split screen, then try it and it's fine. Like I said, interface could seriously be improved.I also needed a good app for marking up all those PDFs. I wanted to stop printing papers just to mark them up, discuss them, and set them aside, hoping I'd remember when needed. My solution was ezPDF which takes a PDF, makes a copy for annotating, then lets me draw all over it. I hear there are others that might be better, but so far this has been wonderful. My printer is loving the break. (I literally have reams of printed papers I've read or written...it was crazy!)There's also a nice deal Samsung has with Dropbox. I hadn't used this service prior to getting the tablet, but if you do a few trivial things like add another computer and watch a tutorial, the free Dropbox account is increased in size from 2 to 48 gigs. I added my laptop and desktop, then merged every paper I had plus class notes and more into the service so my resources are all pretty seamless between machines. Granted, you could use a cloud service like Dropbox with any device, so it's not really a selling point... still very nice though. I'm glad it was there in my face so I'd go try it. :) The interface with Google Drive is also really tight so you can easily sync apps like S Note with your Google Drive account. I was very concerned about how things would be backed up when I got the tablet - loss of data is a very scary prospect when getting away from paper.I feel like I've had a definite quality of life improvement with this device, but I'm still just scratching the surface of what it's capable of.Oh, I suppose I should address screen resolution, battery life, and all that.The battery lasts for a really really long time. I'm not sure just how many hours. I suspect I could use it for maybe two days without charging, assuming I don't watch any TV shows on it or anything. I went on a Dr. Who marathon a couple of weekends ago and it ran low after several episodes, starting from less than full charge. Even when it says it's critically low, it keeps going for quite awhile.The screen resolution is ok. It is not as high as the iPad's, but then, as I understand it, that sacrifice was necessary to support the Wacom tech in this form factor (low power processor, etc)- a worthy sacrifice. In any case, I can't say I've complained about the visible size of pixels in at least a decade so I'm not all that upset about it. I guess if I bought it just to consume media, I'd be upset, but for me, this is a tool first, toy second.So, to wrap it up:Pros:- Great for class notes! (Also, no more smudging if you're left handed like me!)- Mark up PDF presentations if your prof puts them up for download- Create and mark up PDF slides while teaching or tutoring, then give them to your students afterwards.- Like a brain extension when it comes to organizing.- Save paper and toner!- Stylus tech by Wacom - you just have to try it if you haven't before. It's really sweet, I swear.- Fun for doodling, if you like that.- You're free from Apple's walled garden, if you care about such things.- Speakers are on the front. Nice when you want to curl up in your blankets and watch some TV. (Audio isn't terrible either, given the form factor)Cons:- Screen resolution not amazing, but really not terrible either- S apps could use some UI improvements. Loads of potential, just not quite to the point of being stellar apps yet. I'm optimistic for them still and use them anyways.", "Title": "A Student's Dream Tablet", "Date": "October 23, 2012"}, {"Author": "H.

And I was debating between ipad and galaxy note 10.1 and I decided to go for the Note. I am really happy that I chose this tablet.First of all, the S note app is amazing. It is very responsive and accurate. And it's really fun as well! When I am bored, I just take the Note and write random things. Somebody below complained about the auto handwriting conversion to text. But I think it is almost impossible to convert the handwriting to text in a blink although I think it's still fast enough. And I could figure out the most of the problems that he had..And because I'm studying in engineering, I need to draw a lot of graphs , shapes, and formulas. And the auto shape match feature is the best part. I can draw anything very fast and it just makes them in the exact way that i want.Unfortunately, S-note is not pdf file friendly. Even though you can import pdf files into S-note, there are not many useful feataures for S-note. But of course you can download any pdf annotation app from the market. I found this app, EZpdf, and they optimized the app for galaxy note so that when the stylus pen is near the screen, your palm is not recognized like S-note so the annotation is perfect. Also, you can organize your files and you can search the meaning of words that you select in either dictionary or wikipedia right away.So trust me. If you are a student, I don't think there is any other tablet that can satisfy you than this one. I know that ipad has many good note apps but what is the point of using them if there is no palm rejection feature?Other than taking notes, the performance is also blazing fast. I always complained that even screen scrolling is not smooth for androids compared to ipad but I think Samsung optimized this tablet very well. Even when you are doing the multiscreen, there is no lag at all (except that it takes 0.5 seconds to move to another screen). With the 2gb rams, you can open unlimited number of tabs in your web browser.About the resolution.. If you are not going to read the Bible which is full of very tiny letters, i don't think you will have any problem to read articles or papers. And this resolution doesn't make any difference for vidoes since 1080x720 is a standard resolution for tablet. Correct me if i'm wrong.For watching videos or netflix, I really like that they put a dual speakers in front of the screen. It's very loud and clear. In my opinion, it's a huge difference from other tablets in terms of watching movies or listening to musics.I am not an art person but I take pictures a lot. And the phothoshop touch that comes with this is amazing. There are a lot of tutorials inside and it's easy to learn. With the s-pen, it is very fun to edit pictures. It is another thing that I like the most.The only downside is that you need enough time to get used to the software. Since there are a lot of features, you have to play around with it for a while. For me, it took about 2 hours to be friendly with the interface. But it's like when you are new to android and have to spend some times to get used to the interface.Summary. If you are a student who needs to take notes and annotate pdf or slides, you SHOULD get the Note 10.1. With this, I am not going to bring any backpack and notes.

It's everything I was hoping it would be, and more.  I was holding off buying a tablet because ever since iPADs and Android tablets came out, I wondered why no one made one to be written on... like you do a TABLET or a PAD?!  I used to have a tablet PC and I really missed that funtionality.  I bought this tablet the first day it came out, and I was a little nervous about that, but it's been a dream so far.The pen is especially awesome for taking notes in meetings. It's also great to be able to scribble or draw. You need a pen for so many things in life, people! Sometimes I just get tired of typing and I want to write.  It's a different experience.  And this tablet was created to be used with a pen, it's not a third-party add-on. It also comes with plenty of pen related templates to get you started. The handwriting recognition seems to work well, although I haven't used it much yet.As far as the tablet overall, the responsiveness is great, and the screen is perfect.  All my favorite Android apps look great on it.  I also love having the micro SD card option as then I don't worry about space.  I can go crazy downloading apps or even buy an extra sd card to load up with movies when I travel.

I have used Tablet PC's since 2003 and have been searching for an affordable slate that works well for note taking (I am a lawyer), email and general web use.  I do not care about multimedia as I use it for work.  I also have a Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet 16b wifi version and three Fujitsu Tablet PC's (T4215, T4020 and T5032). I also had the Fujitsu Q550 but sold it.  My wife has an Ipad and I also have a Nexus 7.The Wacom  stylus makes a huge difference compared to the N-trig on the Lenovo.  Speed, accuracy and feel are much better with the Wacom.  The ease of writing is on par with the Fuji's which are the gold standard in my opinion.  Battery life is very good, it is easily an all day device with wifi on and high brightness while taking notes.  If you invoke the power saving mode the usage is even longer.The software is pretty much standard Samsung fare but the S-Note is a nice program but rather simplistic.  If you buy this you should immediately go the Play Market and buy Lecture Notes, Lecture Notes Recorder and install the pdf plugin.  You can sync audio and written notes and replicate about 50% of the functionality of OneNote.  No other program comes close to offering the features of OneNote except Lecture Notes.  As an example, yesterday I took 5 hours of notes with audio and never had a problem.  I reviewed the synced audio and it is useful (you really need an external microphone but it is usable).All in all, it is a great tablet at a reasonable price for business use with handwriting.

That purchase was the 7.0 plus.. Now that tab is my carry around one and I still love it and use it everyday. Then the 10.1 Note came out and not only did I buy this I also bought my wife the tab 2 10.1. She uses hers every day too. I am a photographer and use Photoshop  a lot. When I played with this tab in the store and found Photoshop Touch on it along with a quad core and 2 gig of ram, I had to have it. Can you tell I like Samsung? I've tried everything else and they all fell short of what I expected. I love the Touch Wiz that others complain about because it offers what I need. I've tried the other apps that are similar to the Touch Wiz but they fall way short. Launchers to replace it don't hold a candle to it. From icons being too small to spacing between them too far apart. Touch Wiz works well and on this tab, its perfect. My wife just bought the S3 phone and when she walks into the house with pictures she took of the grand kids, the automatically go to my Note. To browse or to edit in Photoshop Touch. Taking notes for me right now is just a gimmick but when I get it figured out I can see where it will come in handy.

Not only it is stereo, it is facing you, and it has plenty of volume to enjoy.The thing that bothered me the most about the iPad2's speaker was that, not only is it mono, it is located on the back.It bothered me to the point of searching and backing some \"Kickstarter\" project, so that I could redirect the sound from back to front.I was that desperate..S-PEN:S-Pen and PS Touch experience has been just amazing.It is not perfect, but it made it possible where it was impossible before.I could actual do semi-serious photoshopping with it.The S-Pen is pin-point accurate and the PS touch provided good set of tools, complete with good tutorials to acquaint myself.I hope one day, that I can work with RAW image files on this combo.MINI APPS:Some people think there aren't enough mini apps available. True, but I like to think in reverse.Having them and not having them make a quite the difference in my opinion.They are very handy, because they are popup apps that hovers over other app and can be moved around.It is nice to clip things and take notes on them, without needing to hop and switch from one app to the other.The whole process flows very well and naturally.PERFORMANCE (GAME):I think you will find plenty of youtube videos, demonstrating how well it can run some of the most heavy (CPU)hitting titles.My gaming experience has been the same. This tablet will chew up those games like it was designed to be a gaming machine, and it can be and it is.As of 8/30/2012, this tablet is the only tablet that I know that sports 2GB of memory.Along with 1.4Ghz quad core Exynos processor, it packs some serious performance.PERFORMANCE (MULTITASK):This is where that 2GB of memory shines.If the internal storage space and micro SD card are the filing cabinets, the system memory is the desk.Bigger the memory, bigger the surface area of the desk, where you can open more documents and lay them down, side by side.Since it has such a spacious(2GB) desk, it does not need to close already open documents to make room for new document to open.Every time your device closes the document or app just to reopen them again later from scratch, it occupies that much more processor time and eats that much more battery power processing it.Along with split-screen capability and pop up mini apps, multitasking on this tablet is A+.BATTERY LIFE:I do not always play games, or watch videos, but I do fair amount of them, and I am comfortable to say that I get 10+ hours, which is healthy amount. Charging time is around 3 hours if I let it go down to about 20%~30%.BUILT QUALITY:It could be better. So does the iPad in difference aspects.However, it will get the job done of protecting it.Just don't drop it, hard.Then again, it is a fair game for other tablets too.If you drop them hard, most of them will break just the same.REMINDER:I have couple of reminders.1st one is about the hidden goodies in Galaxy Note 10.1.There are many small details and features that you probably do not know about.While they are not a game changer, they certainly make the tablet experience that much richer.Some of the things you want to look into are.. Display Screen modes (Dynamic, Standard & Movie), Motion features (Tilt to zoom, Pan to move icon & Pan to browse images), two fingers pinch in sweep over your on screen keyboard to change mode (Qwerty keyboard, Floating & Split), in Floating keyboard mode, if you touch the keyboard with two fingers for about 2 secs, you can relocate the keyboard to any area on the screen. There are many other hidden goodies, so google for tips and tricks.2nd one is about Jelly Bean update.Samsung is preparing for the Jelly Bean update.When that happens, you will get the latest Android OS, BUT you will lose the Adobe Flash Player.Adobe Dev. no longer supports Adobe Flash player for mobile version, so if you value your flash capability.. then ***DO NOT*** upgrade it to JB.Remain on ICS until HTML5 becomes majority.

I am posting it since I hope it will help others with my particular focus.  The only reason I purchased this tablet was to be able to use it to digitally draw and paint.  If you think about it, spending 550 dollars on something that is really nothing more than a digital sketchbook is nuts considering a regular paper sketchbook works just as well.  However, I do not need to carry markers, paint or other crap with me to draw and I can use this in the dark sitting outside by a fire or whatever.  Originally, I was going to plunk down 1300 dollars for the Samsung Series 7 slate which is absolutely awesome (there is NOTHING better for the digital artist currently)but I just could not justify the cost.On to the review.  Since I was focused strictly on digital drawing and painting, the stylus use and sensitivity were important.  I currently own a Cintiq 21UX and a Wacum Intuos 4 wireless tablet and I love the Cintiq with how sensitive it is and how it responds with digital painting.  I held off buying any slates up to this point since other artist told me that I would be disappointed in the sensitivity and ability for detail using an apple or other droid devise with a capacitive stylus.  Of course, I know some nice stuff has been created using these tablets, even with fingers, but I was not at all interested in that effort.I received the tablet and and immediately purchased and downloaded Sketchbook Pro, one of my favorite apps.  I checked all of the settings to make sure the pen was set up and then I started to draw.  I would love to say it was love at first site but I was a bit disappointed.  The stylus does respond pretty good and the painting experience is good but it seems to falter a bit with detail or smaller lines.  It will skip sometimes and you have to go back and redo the stroke or brush mark.  Sketchbook pro does work well on this tablet and the program has a lot of nice features but this review is not about Sketchbook.Other things I noticed is that it does not have an eraser ( I knew this when I bought it)which could be pretty handy but it is not necessary.  I do like how the stylus fits into a dedicated hole on the slate.  The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.  I have read about the plastic back and although it does not really bother me, I do find myself handling this thing cautiously.  I think it will be fine but Samsung always seems to have some quality issues which some of their great products which I just do not understand.  Again, the back is most likely not an issue but it does kind of feel \"cheap\".  The UI seems okay and pretty responsive so no complaints there.  As for a programs, I do not have much to say there since my focus is really on using this as a drawing tool.  However, I did try to set up the TV remote feature and for some reason it partly worked and then did not work at all.  I will try setting it up again since I think this would be a pretty cool feature. The battery does seem to do well and I had the screen pretty bright and working on a digital sketch for about 2 hours.  I think I was down to 77% or something so battery life should be fine.  It does seem to take a bit of time to charge fully.Is the tablet worth the money?  I don't know...I guess so but I am rarely excited about spending 500 dollars or more on anything really.  I think 375 or 400 dollars for this sort of tablet would be justifiable but what do I know.  I do think if you are considering any slate at all, I would look at this one seriously since it can do everything an Apple or other Droid can do PLUS it has the stylus for note taking and drawing.  I gave it 4 stars because I can draw pretty well with it.  I would give it 5 stars if the stylus worked a bit better with light touches on smaller brush sizes.  I do think this trend of using a stylus will hit it big with artists and students so I am sure something better may come along for the same price in a year or two.  As I mentioned previously, if you want that better slate now, look at the Samsung Series 7 Slate.  Truly an amazing tool if you are okay spending that kind of money.  If you want some of that experience but on a smaller budget, then this is probably the way to go.  I will used this slate I have for awhile and then try to update this review.", "Title": "Purchased Just for Drawing/ Sketching", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Author": "Bryan Williams", "ReviewID": "R165ZDW4R7A6F0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After using a note 10.1 for 10 days now for college, I personally don't get it. The multitasking is little more than samsung showing you 2 apps at once; you still can only really do one useful thing at once. If you have a browser open and are downloading something, and have sNotes next to it, when you tap over to sNotes, the browser stops downloading. Why you may ask? Because in reality you just closed your browser, you just don't know it. Then, for the classes I'm taking the apps that do offer the multi-tasking are useless. I need to use the apps for my particular set of classes: Wolfram alpha, real calculator, greys anatomy for example(bioengineering/premed), as well as browsers like firefox, or chrome. Too bad they don't work in multiscreen because this is a samsung hack. It's gonna be a while before they do I suspect.The mini apps at the bottom are also useless in quality and content to me and they are one more thing that gets pressed and opens when I hand my tablet to someone else. If I could put my apps (realcalc or some other graphing calculator) down there then maybe, but really, if I could turn off the mini app option I would. I hate it. Its almost as bad as taking notes and having your ability to write all of a sudden stop because you've activated either the notifications window or the mini apps by accident.Personally, the customization of minute things in the OS are just not interesting to me and I've noticed that many of the settings that my HTC phone offers are just missing all together. However, androids always felt almost done, but not quite done to me any way. However, samsung then come along and really don't help the cause at all.Can any one tell me why I need multiple clocks or weather widgets all telling me the same thing over and over in multiple screens? Apparently, android developers see the need to offer me the ability to tinker with my OS settings multiple times a day. I don't have time for that and want it out of the way.I believe that many of the inadvertent activations of these various screens could have been prevented by putting this bottom Home/MiniApps/Notifications bar at the top of the screen like on many phones. Why put soft buttons where we hold the tablet or rest our palms?I've tried implementing the stylus pen into my math and science class note taking, but really, it just costs me time. if I need to grab a graph of some sort that I've drawn to move in my notes, forget it, it's only grabbing pieces of the drawing at a time. Every time you lift the pen, the tablet considers it a new drawing, instead of letting you choose an area of lines and deciding that everything in such area is your drawing in its entirety. I don't understand why it allows me to type right over the top of annotations I've made, and the write to text is just (for me) unreliable. The terminology is just not in the data base and my corrections would not stick.The hardware sounded great on paper, and for the most part I've had no issues with lag or connections. In walking around in Bestbuy I see more responsive tablets. In the end, I think it was samsung that ruined it for me and I just feel this tablet is a little gimmicky.For the money I expected a better app experience from samsung. I need a few apps that work, not 20 where half of them are crap and the other half half work with one or two stand outs. 18 credit hours this semester and this tablets cost me so much in wasted time I feel like billing samsung. I pull out the ultrabook and blaze through note taking, look up things like graphs and insert them into my notes infinitely better. I save and annotate pdf's just fine and all my school books are through kno.com. Personally, I just think tablets are for light stuff. I need to do more than a few things at once and I need all of my features at the same time.", "Title": "As a student, I don't get whats so great", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Author": "Imaginary Fox \"Kitsune\"", "ReviewID": "R2GA6ZEOUZH32J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My background is I'm on my desktop PC running WinXP and had a old low-end laptop which I no longer have, but had enjoyed the portability with. I got this tablet because I'm an amateur artist and I wanted to get a device that was good to draw on as well as had basic laptop functionality to replace my old one so I'm not as tied to my PC. I do not own any Apple or Android products, so I wasn't tied to either company. This made me favor the Android system, because it was more open.I did a LOT of research on tablets to see what fit my needs best, and I know there are even others that are more like a laptop, with a detachable keyboard, like the Transformer series. This one was as much as I wanted to spend, most of the others that were attractive were also higher-priced (for good reason). Ones like the Surface Pro, while really cool, were out of my price range. The other one I was more seriously looking at was the Nexus 10, but I wanted the better pen experience over the better resolution.One thing I want to make clear about the S-pen is this is the ONLY tablet that currently uses Wacom technology, which is the best for artistic work. Other tablets support a stylus, but they all have a rounded rubber end or a clear plastic disc around the point if it is fine, because the touch technology works differently for those tablets. No other tablet has ACTUAL pressure sensitivity and a normal style of pen.However, the unfortunate drawback of it being an Android tablet is that iPad actually has a couple superb art apps that are not available for Android, which I find ironic :( But that doesn't mean we don't get good apps. The tablet comes with Adobe Touch, but frankly I don't think its the best one, even though its the most expensive on the app store normally. Adobe has sadly pretty much pulled out of the Android market altogether save for this app, and I wouldn't be surprised if it never sees a real update of new features. I feel a lot of bitterness towards Adobe for this. I was going to pick up Ideas even though I knew it was really limited, but it got pulled from the market before I got my tablet. The main reasons I don't recommend Touch are severe limitations in file saving and opening. Other apps can give you .psd support, layers, and S-pen support without as much hassle. Adobe only lets you save files on their Cloud.The most recommended art apps are Sketchbook Pro and Layer Paint which I think weren't more than $3 each. They both seem solid and highly-reviewed but I havn't used them enough to offer a real opinion yet. There are of course a bunch of others, I grabbed ZenBrush to try it out since it was free. I was looking for something that supported layers and I could export to continue to work with in Photoshop CS on my desktop and those two seem to fit the bill.Now that I've got that out of the way, I have to say I love this tablet. I feel like every day it blows my mind how cool it is :D It has replaced everything I can do on my desktop PC save for extensive programs like full Photoshop or large games like Guild Wars 2. Web browsing, art files, documents, light games, music, videos, it does it all. This tablet is great on its own for regular functions, but having the S-pen makes it amazing.I'm looking forward to the Jelly Bean update, because I think this tablet will keep getting better. (The reason Jelly Bean takes longer for this than a Nexus is Samsung does tweaking for support of the S-pen and some other modifications, but it should be hitting really soon.)I honestly hope Samsung keeps this line of tablets going in the future, and while I am happy with how this tablet is, I see some ways they could continue to improve. I look forward to a Note 2 when the time comes, though I don't think it will be soon. I also hope more apps will continue to appear to support the S-pen.So, here's a rundown of some features:I love that it had a micro SD expansion slot. The main thing I didn't like about the Nexus was the lack of memory expansion. This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card. I plugged the tablet into the computer and was able to move my files onto the tablet card as easy as moving them to a flash drive. It just can take a while for a large volume of files. I was able to move over my music, video files, and other docs I wanted access to and still have a good amount of space left.I also already use Dropbox and love it. I already had some extra space unlocked, but getting the huge chunk of free space for 2 years is awesome. This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are. I can make whatever mix of widgets and app icons wherever I want (you have 6 full screens you can lay out and swipe between, so I made themed ones- email, news, calendar, games, internet apps, and music/videos). I trashed most of the default layout pretty quickly. Some of the side bars from Samsung aren't that useful, but I just tweak or ignore them and they don't get in my way.So far I've had no problems with the tablet's performance- no crashing or hanging or anything. It runs smoothly and quickly.It finds and connects to wifi easily. Most settings are very quick to access and modify. It also supports Bluetooth.I was very impressed with the battery life. It generally lasts 2 days of pretty heavy use- I've never run out so far. I generally charge it every other day, though other electronics (like my phone) I charge every night.The resolution may not be top of the line, but it looks great to me. I enjoy watching video files (which is supports a god range of) as well as apps like Netflix and Crunchy Roll.Polaris Office comes included and can handle Microsoft documents, so I was able to open whatever I needed! It also supports Adobe Reader for .pdfs.The speakers are good, but I also love that it has a headphone port. I sometimes plug in some computer speakers and listen to music at work through it. The music stays on in the background if you're doing something else with the tablet.I figured out most stuff with the tablet quickly just by poking around, although Samsung for the most part tells you very little other than a brief feature overview booklet. But hey that's what Google is for. I generally just looked up any questions I had. I'd say only folks who aren't comfortable on computers may have some trouble diving in. I found it logical for the most part.The app selection seems very good. You can always browse the Google Play store before buying the tablet to see if what you want is there (although not all apps are supported by all devices- I learned sadly the Popcap games there are not supported for this tablet). It also supports Nook and Kindle (and I'm sure others) so you can shop at other app stores too for your games, music, movies, books, etc, you are not tied just to Google.I think this tablet is a great size for reading, I generally tilt it sideways for browsing the web or reading. It just takes the tablet a second to orient in any direction.I've seen some people complain that the side-by-side feature for running a few select programs is kind of lackluster, and they have a valid point, but I didn't really mind. I read how the feature worked, but it wasn't something I really planning on using much. If this is a reason you're buying this tablet, keep in mind its limited to a handful of programs, and it does take a moment when switching for that program to activate. Its still a good feature if you don't have super high expectations.The camera is adequate, but unimpressive. It seems required for any portable device to have a camera nowadays, and both front and back are there, but the photos aren't great. If I'm taking serious pictures, I'll stick to the digital camera I got. Its about equally as good as a normal cell phone for just taking a quick pic you want to post to Twitter. It has the weaknesses of most regular range digital cameras with low light, indoors, and motion. It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something. It gets the job done, its just not going to make amazing vacation photos.I believe you can get a Samsung or bluetooth keyboard for this separately, so you can get more of a laptop feel. I am a avid typer (can you tell by the length of my article?), but for typing I was satisfied with using the touch screen. I'd say you probably only need a keyboard attachment if you plan on typing a LOT, for instance writing a book or something and don't want to use the pen.One thing that's been a concern with tablets is the lack of support for Flash. With the number of websites and such that use Flash, I thought it'd be a problem, but so far I havn't even noticed. Most extensive Flash or video sites (like Youtube) have an app to use instead.I'm currently waiting on a case to come- I'd like to keep it in my purse/bag, and while it seems solidly built, I don't want to worry about it rubbing against other things like my keys and getting scratched. I had a hard time deciding on a case, hopefully I picked a good one. I like that some of the cases offer folding options to function as a stand for your tablet, so I think a case is a good addition if you can find one you like. Be aware some do not have a slot cut for the pen!My nitpicks about the tablet would be that its a little heavy to hold freehand over a period of time to read, watch video, or whatnot, but I don't have a problem resting it on my legs or something else. It doesn't get hot like a laptop at all.I also don't feel like the charger fits in the bottom well- it doesn't really click in, you just kinda wiggle and push it in and out. Over time I'm afraid it may have a tendency to get loose.Would I recommend this tablet for everyone? Not universally. You are paying extra for the Wacom screen technology and also sacrificing some resolution, so if you're not in love with the S-pen, then I'd look at other tablets. I don't think this tablet is for your average person who mostly wants some media and internet consumption- there are better tablets if the pen doesn't matter to you.For a purchase like this, I recommend you do what I did- find a local store that has one on display to try. I went to Best Buy several times to poke at this tablet before deciding to buy. I also went to several office stores to try out other tablets. Poke around in S-note, see how you like the feel of the pen (though be aware it may have been abused and not work as well as it should.)Should you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory? I did some reading and decided on the 16GB since the tablet has space for ample expansion, and you can get a far larger micro SD card for the $50 difference- I got the 64GB SanDisk class 10 one. I popped it in the small port not long after I got the tablet going for the first time and it recognized it no problem. 16+64= 80GB which is likely far more than I'll ever need. The only thing to be aware of is some things will only work or want to go on the internal memory, and like any storage drive, the number is a lie. You actually start with more like 11.6GB free space after the OS and whatnot, and 59.5GB on the card (I'm not sure why about that, I think it may have come with stuff on it). After getting any app that sounded interesting and filling up a chunk of my card with a large part of my music collection and videos, I'm at 9.3GB free on the system, and 30.2GB on my card, so I don't feel like I'm in any danger of running out of either.I've had it a couple weeks at this point so not really had time to test out all the details extensively, so I'll update this review later on.", "Title": "Fantastic tablet that serves many functions PLUS the S-pen", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Author": "Miriam", "ReviewID": "REBPK101QYWG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this model because for just $50 more, it doubled the storage from 16gb to 32gb (yes, white is pretty, but it doesn't come in 32gb).Pros:* Multitasking.

Some reviews I read (or watched) complained that the fact that the back is plastic made the Note 10.1 feel cheap to them. Maybe I'm not as discerning, but I'm thrilled with the build quality of the Note 10.1. It's very thin, very light, but also very solid feeling. It doesn't look or feel at all \"cheap\" to me.Other reviewers (users and \"experts\") also talked about the screen and the fact that it's only HD (720p) not Full HD (1080p). Regardless, the screen of the Note 10.1 is gorgeous to my eyes with excellent viewing angles, vivid colors, and fantastic contrast. You'll only notice the 720p resolution when reading books or text--and then only if you look closely. It's still totally satisfactory and not at all annoying to me. One thing about the 720p: the lower resolution is probably at least in part intentional because it requires less power to push the reduced number of pixels, and therefore the device can run more smoothly for longer than it would if it had the higher resolution screen.In any case, the Note 10.1 runs very fluidly with gorgeous graphic transitions between screen, loading everything with aplomb and speed. This is one very fast machine. On that note, make sure that you delete the built-in Samsung widgets which are installed on most of the screens initially. Doing so dramatically speeds up the interface, and you won't miss Samsung's *other* products (i.e., everything but S Note).My personal concern was as a student I worried about the stylus functionality. I worried that perhaps hand writing would lag too much--i.e., show up on the screen after I'd already finished drawing a character of a word. I haven't been able to find many videos showing how well the handwriting works. And no the videos on youtube showing the handwriting recognition don't help me because I don't every use handwriting recognition. I just want a tablet that keeps up with my handwriting and renders it well on the virtual page. The Note 10.1 does so. It captures my handwriting in exactly the way I want it captured--it looks, in other words, similar to how it looks on paper. It's chicken-scratch on a paper page, and it's still chicken-scratch on the virtual page in the Note 10.1, but that's what I want. And yes, it totally keeps up with my rapid writing and drawing. In every way the note taking experience on this machine is totally satisfactory. I'm also looking forward to reading and annotating pdfs on this device. The screen dimensions are optimal for viewing, reading, and writing--and doing all three on the go.Seriously. If you're on the fence as I was, get off! This *is* the device you want. It can do everything the iPad can do, and more. Not only can you consume all the media and play all the games that you can on the iPad, on this device you can also create media (i.e., take notes, annotate documents, etc.). While the Microsoft Surface isn't out yet, as I hear it the Surface RT (the entry-level model) fails to offer palm-rejection. This is a major oversight as you pretty much need solid palm rejection to support using a tablet for notetaking and writing. The Note 10.1 is excellent in this category as well. I was able to rest my palm on it and scrawl away without issue. Awesome.Samsung really hit it out of the park on this one. I highly recommend the Note 10.1.[UPDATE 12/1/12]I've been using the Note 10.1 for over a month now and have more to add to my initial review. I still really like the Note 10.1 but as the newness wears off, so does some of the infatuation. It is still the best device in its class (tablet with a stylus for a relatively affordable price), but it's not perfect. The back of the case wears a little quicker than I'd like and the inking experience, while good, could be just a tad bit better. I hear the inking experience is supposed to be improved by the upcoming Jelly Bean update which I hear will arrive in the next month. We'll see. I'll update my review later after that update to let y'all know what I observe. The inking is certainly good enough to be effective for notetaking in class or meetings or using as an infinite notepad on your desk at work. It's just little things that I've noticed: the ink having a tad bit of lag as it \"flows\" onto the screen as you write. The device will be just the slightest millisecond behind your movements...not really enough to matter, but just enough to notice it. Also, I'm not certain if it's the app I'm using (LectureNotes--very good) or the device, but occasionally the accuracy of the pen can be quirky. A letter I've just written might have a random artifact jutting from it. Not a big deal and easily remedied by the eraser tool and rewriting the character, but a slight annoyance. I do suspect that that specific behavior is probably a LectureNotes idiosyncrasy though perhaps caused by my attempts to write as I'm lowering my hand to the screen or lifting it, triggering both inking and palm-rejection behavior at the same time with the occasional artifact resulting. Again, these are small niggles. I'm still glad I bought the device as it is the best tablet with a stylus within several hundred dollars or the price-point.The back of the device is plastic and it picks up fingerprints like nobodies business. You'll get used to wiping your device down every day just to keep it from looking all ghetto from all the fingerprint smudges. Also the back wears (scratches) easier than I'd like from resting on flat surfaces. Simply putting it on my desk at work, and tables and counters at home, has caused certain raised spots (I'm guessing) where the electronics press up against the plastic back to wear: loose the new plastic shine, and have lots of tiny scratches. They're not SUPER apparent (especially when covered by fingerprints), but when you wipe the device down you'll see them in the glare of overhead lights. It's just a small annoyance that I feel could have been easily rectified had Samsung selected an equally lightweight but better wearing material for the back: like maybe some soft-rubberish coated plastic? I do like that the plastic probably helps a lot in keeping the device at its lightweight--which is partly what makes it so imminently useful and usable. It just needs to be more durable.In any case, after a month of using the Note 10.1 I am still glad I bought it. And I should say that once you remove the widgets that come on the main screens of the device it really flies. I'm thrilled with its performance, but I hope it's sturdier than it seems like it *might* be. Keep in mind for my review of the Note 10.1 that I (and my wife, who somehow wears devices down a bit more rapidly than I do) use the Note 10.1 very heavily at work, school, and home--so my/our satisfaction is as power users of the device.", "Title": "Blown away -- everything I hoped for!", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Author": "GoTheDistance", "ReviewID": "RPE2CO9GX1QRB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally, a professional level tablet that I've been waiting for.

It came with Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box. I used it for a couple of hours before noticing that the Jelly Bean update was available. There was a noticeable improvement in responsiveness and speed. Jelly Bean Rocks!!! :)The tablet looks and feels very nice. It is considerably lighter than the Ipad 3. I honestly prefer reading books on a 7 inch tablet because they are lighter but when looking at pdf documents this tablet is much better. I decided to put a case on the tablet and it the weight went up quite a bit thought :(As far as using the S-Pen and S-Note i can't really complain much. The S-Pen feels like a real pen when you are writing not like those gummy bear stylus tips that the other tablets use to write with. S-Note works pretty well for the most part. The shape match and formula match features are fantastic although they could use a little more refinement. As an engineer student i like the formula match feature a lot since i often have to write down a lot of long formulas. There are times when the program seems to get confused with some of the Greek letters used on the formulas and it can get a bit annoying at times. Like i said, it needs refinement.The battery life is one of the first things i look at when buying a portable electronic device. Very pleased so far with its performance. Easily gets me through the day even after taking notes through out the day. I use the brightness at about a quarter and it is enough for me. Don't expect the battery to last the entire day if you have the brightness all the way up while playing HD movies all day. It is just not realistic. If you are indoor web browsing, taking notes, checking e-mail and watching a few videos it should last the entire days with no problems.The tablet takes at least 4 hours to charge fully which is a bummer. The cable that comes with the tablet is pathetically short. I don't get why all of the manufacturers insist on giving us this 1 foot long cables to charge the electronics. I guess they don't want to spend a extra 10 cents on a another couple feet of wire. I ended buying a longer cable from Amazon.I have no problems with the display at all. It is more than adequate for reading and watching movies. The display on the Ipad 3 is better and you can certainly notice the difference when you look at them side buy side. But if you are working with it alone you will see that it is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.The camera is by far one of the weakest things in the tablet. I personally would never use a tablet to take pictures, but if i did, i would be very disappointed. The camera is very, very mediocre. My Samsung Galaxy S3 came out 6 months before and takes much better pictures.The speaker's sound quality and the sd card slot for extra storage are big plus.with this i want to wrap up my review. If you are a student and are thinking about purchasing a tablet then look no further. This is the ONE. Even if you are not a student i would recommend it. The tablet is not perfect, but then again, nothing in life is.", "Title": "For students it is by far the best tablet out there.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Author": "Nicholas Jarak", "ReviewID": "R28GDC2BS5W2IQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet has met and exceeded most of my expectations. I bought it mainly for use in my university classes and for drawing. I haven't used it much for drawing yet, but it has been excellent for my university classes. The S-Pen works very well and is quite accurate.The only word of warning with this is that you should AVOID any tablet cases that have magnets in them. The S-Pen works using magnetic inductance, and therefore, magnets that are within 1 or 2 centimeters of the screen can affect the proper functioning of the S-Pen. If you put a magnet near a spot on the screen (for example: if your tablet case/folio has a magnet for attaching a strap to it, and you then fold the folio so that the magnet is behind your tablet and behind the screen within 1 cm), the S-Pen's position will not match what shows up on the screen. The floating pen position indicator will move in a direction that is away from the magnet. This means that if within one centimeter of a magnet the digital pen tip will deviate from the real pen tip by 1-3 millimeters, which makes writing quite difficult. For some reason, a lot of the cases that are indicated as being for this tablet have magnets in them. Whoever designed these cases obviously had very little knowledge of how the S-Pen works because these magnets really mess with the pen accuracy on the screen if they get too close. Although, it's important to note that this isn't permanent, it only happens when a magnet is currently near the screen.Other than that frustration (that took about a week to figure out), this tablet has worked excellently. In regard to the tablet's other functions, they also work very well (probably better than most tablets because of the larger processor and large amount of RAM). The multi-tasking works pretty well, and it can be quite useful at times such as when your in class writing notes and your professor recommends a website for some useful information. I often use it when doing homework on my tablet. Where I'll be reading my homework (a word document or PDF), and then doing it in an app like S-Note. In regard to the other aspects of the tablet, it's pretty much the same as most other android tablets that you'll find except that this tablet might run a little faster than the average tablet. The main advantage of this tablet over other tablets is the S-Pen. If your buying this tablet, it should be for the S-Pen. If you don't care for the S-Pen, the you should buy a different tablet because you could get more for you money if your willing to give up the S-Pen functionality. I think this tablet is well worth the price, but it's because I'm making great use of the pen, and this tablet is exactly what I was looking for.I'll probably update this review as to whether or not this tablet is good for drawing once I get a chance to really draw something with it.Update (Drawing):I recently tested out this tablet's drawing capabilities, and I would say that it's pretty good. It's not nearly as good as my laptop and Intuos 5 drawing pad, but honestly, the main limitation seems to be the software available. I'm using Sketchbook Pro for tablets, and it works quite well. It's pretty smooth, and it's interface has been optimized rather well for tablets. I didn't experience any slow downs while using it, so the Galaxy Note 10.1 handled the program quite well. In all honesty, the main difference between doing digital art on my Galaxy note 10.1 and my laptop with Wacom drawing pad was the lack of features available in the Sketchbook Pro app. The research I've done seems to indicate that Sketchbook Pro is one of the best apps out there for drawing on android tablets, and while it's quite good, it simply can't compete with the range of features available on a computer based program such as GIMP. It felt like the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 could have handled more, but it seems that the program wasn't really built with this in mind since it's missing features that could have been easily included. Nevertheless, even with these limitations, it still works quite well because these limitations can't change the fact that the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 has decent pen accuracy, which allows you to work with a decent amount of comfort when drawing. It's a little trickier to do some of the fancier things, but the basics are there, and you can do quite a bit with the basics. I did a little bit of concept art with it, and I was pretty happy with the results. It's not high detail art, but the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is definitely viable for rough concept art work. The only gripe with the hardware that I'll mention is that there are a few spots on the screen where the pen location detection is off by 1 or 1.5 mm they are mostly near the edges of the screen. Sounds small, but it can be annoying when drawing a small detail, but it's not a big deal since you can simply move the canvas with a quick two-fingered swipe. There's not much else to say about this tablet. Overall, it's pretty decent for drawing, but the apps are a bit limited. Hopefully, the available apps gain more features in the future as people realize the potential of android pen tablets like this.If you want to see what I was able to do with it then you can check it out at my DeviantArt account, which can be found by simply googling my name.

I am very impressed with the Note, but there's not enough difference to replace my Tab 2 yet. Other reviewers have made oodles of useful comments (that influenced our Samsung purchase), so I will keep this short.The Note seems a bit faster than the Tab 2 at loading websites, the speakers are somewhat better, and a few apps work a little differently. The weight and size of the two tablets is about the same. The Note's Samsung keyboard is improved compared to the Tab's, and I think Mom (who is used to a typewriter) will prefer this keyboard to the predictive text one I installed on mine.The stylus is great fun to play with, but I haven't found a practical use for it.

The ipad is boring to use, the xperia is a little bit better and the kindles are excellent for Amazon consumption and not alot more. The note can do so much more then all these products put together, and it's going to only get alot better once the jellybean operating system is released for the U.S.. Alot has been made about the screen not being a retina display, however the display pops with color and contrast that it looks better then the kindles higher rated resoloutions. The Galaxy has three viewing options, dynamic, normal, and movie, I prefer the dynamic but all 3 look excellent. Again I was at first very inpressed with the Kindles speakers, very loud and clear, however the Galaxy note has excellent speakers that deliver clear stereo or even virtual 7.1 surround sound from front firing speakers. The internet is very fast to load, the multiscreen function is excellent as is the use of the stylus with note,polaris, or photoshop preloaded are all plusses, especially since I am a teacher who needs a tablet for more than just fun.

Let me mostly concentrate on the pen/stylus feature. This is a wonderful addition and one that I yearned for for many years. It is the killer feature of Galaxy Note and qualitatively sets it apart from other Android/iPad tablets (I go so far as to say that I believe it was Steve Jobs's biggest miss to not include a pen in the iPad.) As a college professor and a parent with a son in high school, it pains me to see students carry a ton of heavy books, binders, and notebooks. A tablet, storing all their textbooks, and allowing them to take notes in class, and do their homewrok by writing (not just typing) on the screen will hopefully liberate them from carrying those horrendous ten pound backpacks.However, as good as the Note is hardware-wise, the software provided, and the software available in the Google Play Store--as of this writing--is unfortunately lacking. It pains me very much to say anything positive about Microsoft, but their bundled handwriting and journaling software with their old laptop tablets were far superior to what Samsung/Android provide. For example in MS Journal, you can select a piece of what you have already written and on the fly move, rotate, expand or shrink , make the lines/writing ticker or thiner, change color etc.), you can easily insert pages, or even space within a page between your lines. The MS Journal takes full advantage of the hardware capabilities, and makes your writing/drawing thicker/thinner based on the pressure you exert. It is as close as you can get to actual writing and drawing on a piece of paper, but with many additional features that you do not have in the traditional writing on a paper. Also there is a pretty decent handwriting recognition software (the stellar Ink program) which does a good job of \"learning\" your handwriting over time and recognizing it and turning it into typewritten text (personally, I hardly ever use this feature though).Almost none of this is available on the bundled S-Note software, nor anything else I could find in Google Play. In S-Note you can do free handwriting, and you can set colors and thickness. In fact you can choose to simulate pen, pencil, paint brush and other common kinds of drawing pens, but you cannot change what you have drawn/written after the fact. If you need to change, you must erase and start over. No selection or any kind of editing of what you already have drawn, no inserting space between your lines, no pressure sensitivity (even though the hardware allows this), none of this is provided.Speaking of erasers, the Samsung Note's pen does not have an eraser at the bottom of the stylus, like the Windows laptop tablets have. However, if you happen to have a Windows tablet (like Lenovo X200) you can use their stylus, and, long and behold, the eraser at the bottom of the stylus will indeed work as an eraser when used in S-Note!Another issue is lack of integration of the stylus and handwriting features with other applications. You cannot for instance  scribble your appointments in the calendar app, or bring up a Polaris office document and annotate on it by handwriting (there is a free draw feature in Polaris Office that can be used with the Stylus though). You can annotate a pdf file if you use Adobe Acrobat Reader for Android, but like its Windows counterpart, it is clumsy and lacks smoothness.  So basically it is up to the app developers to integrate stylus/handwriting into their apps. This shortcoming is more an issue with Android. Google needs to overhaul the Android OS to make pen/drawing/handwriting recognition integrated seamless throughout the ANdroid operating ssystem.Another quibble is the way the stylus is designed in the Galaxy Note. It is too thin and short (I understand this design choice since they want to keep the tablet as thin and light as possible, but it makes the stylus less natural as a pen). The bottom of the stylus does not act as an eraser (I do not understand this omission) and worse yet, the cross section of the stylus is rectangular, rather than circular. This means that you must insert the stylus into its place in a certain way otherwise it won't go in properly.Overall I am hopeful that the software will be upgraded and we will have better journaling apps in near future.

Screw James Franco and his multi-tasking.Anyway, I was really excited for 3 main features: Kno (the textbook app), handwritten notes (S Note) and illustrating (Photoshop Touch).After using the tablet all day, I have discovered the following:1) Handwritten notes work pretty well, but S Note is not the best program. Samsung could have done better. The pages for handwritten notes are tiny, and you have to add new pages to write more. I find this annoying. BONUS: You can add photos and voice recordings into the notes, which is awesome, especially for students (which I am).2) Photoshop Touch is disappointing. An actual graphic designer/illustrator probably wouldn't find much use for the program. Also, the S Pen is a disappointing size and would be better if larger. I think Samsung is lying about the 1024 pressure sensitivity of the S Pen, also - at least when using Photoshop Touch. Maybe I was using it wrong, but holy crap did I have to press hard to get the pressure sensitivity to register correctly.3) Kno is a really awesome program, and I like it that I can load PDF files from DropBox and write little notes on them and stuff. I don't have any complaints about this program.Other things I have noticed:1) The tablet comes with a bunch of pre-loaded crap that I can't uninstall. I HATE THIS. I'm annoyed that in order to uninstall it, I'd have to root the phone, which screws up the warranty and future Android OS updates.2) Sometimes it's slow in registering screen touch. This is pretty universal, so I'm not going to be pissy about it.3) The tablet has FANTASTIC speakers (loud and clear).4) Skype app for Android works really well!5) The rear-facing camera takes really decent images!6) The customization and many screens/widgets/apps is really phenomenal. You can download from Android Market (Play Store) and the Samsung Store, which is really neat. I also love the Media Hub where I can buy movies. :)7) The Smart Remote (for use with Cable and TV) was SUPER EASY to set up and worked immediately with my TV (a Samsung, go figure). However, I had to mess around with the channel line up because for some reason, the Smart Remote gave me channels I didn't have. Overall awesome though.8) The internet browser is fast and full screen. Using this tablet is very similar to using a laptop, which I really love. It is extremely portable.

Every time I plug it in to a PC or a USB wall converter, it has a red 'X' over the battery bar.  Come to find out that though I have a million of these wall connectors, none of them are strong enough to charge my tablet efficiently.  The connector that came with it in the box produces more juice and therefore, DO NOT LOSE IT, or you will spend easily 8-16 hours charging this to full capacity rather than the 4-6 or so with the out of box charger.*END UPDATE*Did I mention I loved it?  Love.  LOVE.I got this as a gift with some strong hints on my part that I really wanted one.  Got all the accessories as soon as I was told it was ordered for me.  The accessories arrived before this so I was tortured in waiting.  As soon as I got it, I started to tinker.  Since its landed on my doorstep on Feb 6th 2013, I have not put it down.The screen is incredibly clear.  I find that I'm just looking for excuses to pull it out even if a laptop is already open in front of me.  The apps are simple to use.  The settings very intuitive, never had to open the manual once.  As a developer, and avid web surfer, I have a tendency to open a bajillion tabs in my browsers.  This browser has a limitation on the number of tabs you can open, so that stumped me for a while, but I've adjusted and its still smooth sailing.I traded the built in pen for the Accessorise Slim Capacitive Stylus (I made a review there too about it) and don't mind a little lost functionality.  The new stylus for me is much more comfortable and safe.I've synced my gmail accounts and my work accounts with no hassle.  Again, zero need for a manual.  Fixed them all up in less than 2 hours.

Castledine", "ReviewID": "R3MW0C9HS0HV2N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having owned an original Motorola Xoom for the past twelve months or so, I am not new to Android tablets. Therefore, this review focuses on the improvements that I feel the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 brings to this type of device.Despite the Xoom doing most of the things I expect and want from a tablet, the Note includes certain compelling new features and improved capabilities that motivated me to upgrade.The main justification for my buying the Note is the S-Pen. This is because I find it easier to handwrite and illustrate my meeting notes than to type them. I tried many tablet styluses on the Xoom because I actually prefer using a stylus over using my fingers (and leaving fingerprints). I soon discovered that none of the third party styluses offered any degree of precision. In fact, they are useless for handwriting and drawing! Therefore, an accurate stylus was something I really wanted in a tablet and the pressure sensitivity of the S-Pen is a bonus.It's important to mention that in the show-case application (S-Note), you have an option to set the tablet to respond only to the stylus input. This means that you can rest your hand on the screen, like on a real notepad, to write and draw. This is definitely something unique to the Samsung Glaxy Note range and makes for much more natural input.Something else I was interested in was the inclusion of phone functionality. With the Xoom, I used to receive SMS messages intended for the previous owner of the phone number associated with my SIM. The messages showed up in the notification area on the Xoom and I could open them in a window. However, I couldn't reply to them (or save them to reply some other way). With the Note, I now have access to SMS and MMS, as well as calls (although, they cost me extra on my data plan).The clincher was when I found out the Galaxy range of tablets (and phones) have a useful host USB Connection Kit as a reasonably priced option. This kit provides access to many USB devices (including printers, USB sticks, keyboards, mouses and SD cards). In my experience, the Xoom can only manage hard-to-find, third-party host adaptors which were flaky at best.Despite the Note being about a centimetre wider and longer than the Xoom, it is much thinner and lighter. The extra bezel width makes holding the Note easier, without accidentally touching the screen area. Obviously, holding the Note for extended periods is much less fatiguing than with the much heavier Xoom.One physical issue with the Xoom that annoys me is the location of the on-off button (on the back). This location has two disadvantages; it is difficult to get to when the tablet is lying on a desk and I often accidentally turn the Xoom on or off when grasping it (mainly when picking it up). The Note has its button conveniently located on the top edge of the device. So far, I have had far fewer accidents with it.The screen on the Note is bright and clear and suits my needs, as is the case for the Xoom. I believe that neither of these tablets needs a higher resolution. I guess that cramming in more pixels for future tablets is inevitable, mainly due to the misguided quest to \"match\" the iSlab.Being able to take screenshots (by pressing the button on the S-Pen and tapping and holding on the screen) is great. But when the image loads into an app that allows you to crop and annotate it, you have a whole new range of powerful and convenient productivity capabilities. Well done Samsung!The Note is quite responsive, having a quad-core processor and 2Gb RAM. From the myriad reviews containing benchmarking, the Note seems to be one of the fastest tablets currently available. This translates into a more responsive experience. The extra RAM is also necessary as the Note can perform some \"multitasking\" by way of a number of apps that have been designed to run alongside each other. Additionally, there are some apps that are designed to run in a subset configuration as floating windows (on top of anything else), or be expanded out to offer full functionality. I find it handy to access a pop-up calculator or the quick Note applet without disturbing my main task/s. My favourite is the Task Manager, which also manages RAM.The front-facing speakers on the Note make for much better sound than the rear-facing speakers on the Xoom. With the Xoom, watching a video requires the volume to be turned up quite loud. Even then, the sound from the speakers appears to be detached and low-fi. I sometimes remedy this with headphones or cupping my hands over the speakers to feed the sound towards the front. Neither \"solution\" is as good as having front-mounted speakers.The inclusion of an IR emitter is a nice feature, but a bit of a gimmick (for me, at least). Coupled with the Peel Smart Remote application, you can supposedly turn your tablet into a smart remote. Although I haven't thoroughly tested this feature, it appears to be reasonably functional. Nevertheless, it seems limited to just one system. So I can't set it up to control both the home theatre as well as the TV in my office.Because I would never use a tablet (nor a phone) camera for photography, if I can help it, I won't go into too much detail about the cameras in the Note. Except to say they are \"adequate\". I mainly use the rear camera with the CamScanner HD application and the front one for Skype.On the negative side, I must mention the proprietary USB/Charging connector. Apparently the output from a PC USB port isn't enough to charge the Note (which I can understand). So, when you have it connected to a PC for extended data transfer periods, you can't charge it at the same time. At least I can do this with the Xoom, as it has a separate charging socket. I would expect proprietary connectors as part of the draconian iApple ecosystem, but Android devices should all have standard USB ports and separate power sockets. As a workaround, I use the brilliant Airdroid application while the tablet sits in its charging cradle.Another negative is the lack of accessories currently available (early October 2012). Because the Note has slightly different dimensions to the Tab 2 10.1, most of the clip-on cases and the keyboard dock do not fit. I guess this will change over time.Despite the slow appearance of accessories for the Note, many of the apps that are suited to a stylus have already been updated to take advantage of the S-Pen's precision. These include Quill and Autodesk Sketchbook Pro, but not Skitch (but who uses that, anyway?). In addition, the excellent Photoshop Touch supports the S-Pen and comes preloaded (with a licence) and really does showcase the benefits of a decent stylus.In conclusion, the Note has features that considerably increase the usefulness of a tablet for me. This is mainly because the extra features are actually what I wanted; NONE of which are available on any comparable device.", "Title": "The features I really wanted in a tablet", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Author": "Miriel", "ReviewID": "R3M6OLCZMMIXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to give the opportunity to samsung instead of apple, and the truth is that I have not disappointed. What is certain is that for the ipad, there is a greater variety of applications for both writing and drawing, and taking notes. But I buy this tablet basically for the application of SNOTE. And well, after trying several apps, I must say that best for writing are: Quill, Write and Papyrus. (Write and Papyrus are free apps).However, for ipad , there are better apps for drawing in general. In my case, I stick with LayerPaintHD, and Sketchbook, that both works with layers, \"most important function\", if you are an artist or are looking for a tablet to draw. Well, if that's the case, I must say that this tablet, works great for painting and sketching, is excellent in these two applications. The sensitivity of the pencil in Sketchbook is instantaneous , almost like a normal tablet PC. In other applications, there is a delay too minimal to perceive during writing. For Quill, there is no delay in writing, the response is immediate. Quill is just like inking in OneNote, almost the same feeling. In the case of Snote, there is a minimum delay, but does not affect the sensitivity of the writing; feels quite natural and fluid stroke.I use Snote just for everything, but for the most, for sketch; It feels like a real writing paper. Also, you can change the background of the paper, for grid paper, school notebook paper etc.In general, the tablet is fast. Navigation on internet is fast. Videos on youtube are just in amazing HD. The battery life is long if you adjust (power save on) and disables screen rotation, vibration, gps, bluetooth and wifi. Screen colors feels vivid and beautiful. You can change the screen mood to: dynamic, standard and movie. Also, you can change the screen to negative colors which i like a lot by the way.The only thing I consider negative, it's the size and shape of the pen. If you're an artist, you will notice this, and later you will want to buy another larger stylus. The size of the spen it's about 4.6 inches, in comparison of a regular wacom tablet pen, of 6 inches. For me, the size is too short for my big hand, and sometimes, at several minutes of drawing, it may feels unconfortable, but it's not a big deal, it's just because i'm a maniac in this type of stuff. Also, the shape of the pen (isn't round) like the regular pens, it's an square shape.Finally, i recommend this tablet for any artist or hobbyist, that looks for a drawing tablet, or for school stuff, mathematics, just for everything you can imagine.

I had told him I wanted it since we both have the Note 2 phones.  I love the S pen feature because I take a lot of notes for work and it's easier than using my finger tip and a lot cleaner.  I also tend to send a lot of letters to Taiwan, so using the S Note, I can easily write a note and pass email it.  Rather than taking days to get there, it only takes minutes.I like the wide range of keyboard options.  Using the English keyboard, Spanish words also pop up. It makes it easier rather than swapping between English and Spanish even though they both use a Romantic alphabet.  My biggest gripe with the language inputs are the Chinese pops up first the simplified characters.  I have to dig through characters to find the traditional characters.  There also is not a Japanese option available for download unless I go to the Play Store.  Of course, I can always use the S pen to write in the characters if I want to take a quick note, however if i wish to type, it's a little harder.The camera is pretty good, both front and back.  My three year old loves to take pictures, so it's fun for him as well.Unlike the Note 2, the bottom of the screen has a little box to take a screen shot. It's easy, especially if you need to send someone instructions or an example.It comes with Polaris Office downloaded, so if you do a lot with word documents, excel, or powerpoint, you can email them to yourself and edit from home or on the go.The USB adapter for the wall is nice as it can easily separate.  The only thing I don't like is how short the cord is.  It's only about 2 feet long.The front of the tablet has two speakers, so no having to lay it down to hear sounds.  If you're watching Youtube, you can hear it better than using your smartphone since the speakers are towards you.  The screen is also big, so you can see the videos better.  It's much easier to gather a crowd around this than your iPhone (if that's your style).

Here are a few things about why I enjoy it so much. Light weight, thin body. The plastic in the back doesn't bother me at all. I've read some reviews and watched probably the same videos as you talking about how the plastic bends and makes noises, well I guess I'm not trying to break my tablet with my steel fingers or something because it hasn't been an issue. Video playback is awesome, 720p is good enough for me on a 10 inch screen, colors look great and picture isn't blurry or jagged. The audio is pretty nice for a tablet, easy to hear since the speakers are up front facing you, but you kind of have to watch out for the levels if you like to use your tablet in bed with your significant other, they might get up and give you the death stare. The S-Pen is what I got this bad boy for, and I don't find myself using it all THAT often, but when I do, it's for art work, jotting down notes, doodling and ideas. The thing is darn handy when I don't want to break out the thumb typing on a larger screen.Things that I find lacking are the shutter speed of the camera, just because you can get high resolution 5mp images does NOT mean you can capture anything moving. Most things that move while you shoot or if you have unsteady hands like I do will mean blurry photos. Video isn't that great either, but this is a tablet we're talking about here, not a Canon/Nikon/Sony dSLR or video camera. If there is nothing else to take a photo with, a quick family snapshot in a well lit area this does fine. Aesthetically there is a bit of plastic on the sides were the speakers are, I don't much like the look of it, if it were a bit smaller I'd enjoy the look of it more, but honestly when I'm using it I don't notice it. So far my biggest gripe is that there isn't a keyboard case/cover for it like the Tab 10.1 2. The logitech case is awesome, but doesn't fit the slightly larger Note (thanks extra plastic that I don't know what you're for) and I've been waiting on a Samsung variant, but nothing has come along yet. Samsung is also pretty bad at releasing updates to new android firmware, but those things can be worked around.For me it came down to the Asus Transformer Prime, the Note 10.1, and the iPad wasn't really even in the running.

No iPad bashing from me.  I've also been spending a bit of time on an Asus Vivo Tab RT, which is really a terrific tablet as well.  And I've been playing a bit with a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.0 7\" and a Kindle Fire HD 7\".  I love different things about all of these and believe they all have a place.  However, the device I am most likely to pick up first is the Samsung Note 10.1.  There is no doubt that lower resolution on this tablet is a slight disappointment, but this is really only an issue if you are heavily accustomed to working on a full HD+ tablet (iPad with Retina display, Nexus 10, etc.).Pros:* Light (feels much lighter than my iPad 2), making it much more enjoyable to use* Gorgeous screen - bright with vivid colors* microSD card slot - a huge advantage over the iPad or Nexus 7* Fast - great quad-core processor offering speedy performance* Multitasking - this is limited, but is an awesome feature that no other Android tablets, or iPads, offer (Win 8 RT tablets like my Asus Vivo Tab RT offer very, very limited multitasking)* Speakers - clear, reasonably strong, and very well placed* Buttons - easy to use, very responsive (would be nice if the volume & power buttons were further separated, but this is similar to most other tablets, and you get used to it.* Keyboard - There are few keyboard configurations. I'm currently using the split keyboard which makes for quick & easy 2-handed typing.  I find the keyboard designs on the Note 10.1 to be much better than the iPad and Windows 8 tablets.* IR-blaster with Smart Remote app - not a critical feature, but the ability to use the tablet as a remote makes it all the more useful* S Pen - this, of course, is the most distinctive feature of the Note 10.1.  Sure you can use a stylus on other tablets, but this pen/tablet combo is pressure-sensitive and takes the tablet computing experience to a new level. For business/productivity as well as art & photography, this is a fantastic feature.Cons:* Price - there is a huge jump in price from the 10\" Tab to the 10\" Note 10.1.  You are paying a premium for a better processor and the S Pen.  These features justify the higher price, but if you don't need them, look at the 10\" Tab.* Low-res screen - given the cost, it is definitely disappointing that Samsung didn't offer a better screen on the Note 10.1.* No Jelly Bean upgrade as of Dec 30, 2012 (released in Germany on Dec 12, so there is hope, but it is disappointing that the upgrades don't come faster - though this is true of other Android tablets).This is not a perfect tablet, but then again, one doesn't exist yet.  A full HD screen would make this pretty close. If you're debating between this and an iPad, I think this is a clear winner unless you have a specific need for the iPad's breathtaking Retina display.  The S Pen makes it much more usable, the microSD slot allows you to expand the storage, and the price (currently as low as $399) are all benefits over the iPad.If you can afford the added expense of the Note 10.1 over the 10\" Tab, then this is a fantastic deal.  I give it 5 starts not b/c it is perfect, but because it is a solid tablet that works well and offers an unbeatable combination of features.  Having said all of this, think about your needs.  Note that if you are considering a 7\" form factor, the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 is clearly the best tablet of its size on the market (hard to find, but Verizon is offering it for just $399 right now with 4G/LTE (no contract needed).  Or wait a little while longer as there are credible rumors that a 7\" Note is in the works.  That will presumably offer a display comparable to the Galaxy 7.7 but with the benefits of the Note line.

I can't get her away from it. She LOVES the Android system, and the Galaxy Note 10.1 platform! She loves all of the app's that you can't get on the iOS. She also loves that it doesn't get hot, like her iPad, when reading.This machine is awesome. Make sure to get a 32gig micro SD card, to expand the memory.

Every time you pause, and start writing again, it starts a new text box. So in the end you're left with fragments of sentences which just looks messy. So I just stick to jotting stuff down.-had some problems with charging the battery, don't know if it will work better after a few charge cycles tho.-the screen keeps dimming and brightening almost at random(even when it's not set to power saving mode)***hopefully Samsung will release some updates to make adjustments to the above concerns, but overall the tablet is great!What I liked:-the pen works great! It's an indispensable part of this tablet! Now that i've become so accustomed to it, I'll never go back to using tabs without pens(that are actually optimized for the tab! not just stylus pens that are mere extensions of our fingers!)-the multiscreen works great, and hopefully Samsung will add more apps that are compatible with it.Personally, I think this is the best tablet on the market today especially for students who love to multitask & save time doing homework and assignments!

I was hoping to purchase the tablet from Amazon but Costco was offering an unbeatable deal. Plus, their return policy is 90 days no questions asked whereas Amazon is 30 days unopened.Initially, I was interested in a 7\" tablet, because I thought it would be more convenient to carry around than a 10\" tablet. I bought the Samsung Galaxy 7\" Tab 2. It is a good quality product that can easily fit into a backpack or purse. However, a month later I tested the Note 10.1 and especially liked the S Pen, which is the stylus. Having been a long time Palm Pilot and Treo fan, the S Pen resurrected a familiar friend. By the way, Palm was ahead of its time. If only they had been on top of their strategic planning, Apple and Samsung would be playing catch up today. Anyway, before deciding on the Note10.1, I returned the 7\" Tab 2 and tested the iPad and Surface tablets. The iPad Retina display is a beauty and iOS is user-friendly. However, the iPad feels heavy and is over priced. Because I have an Android OS mobile phone, it would only make sense to keep streamlined with an Android OS tablet. The Surface is sweet. I love the cardboard thin Bluetooth keyboard that connects magnetically. However, the Surface is a bit pricey and I've learned the hard way not to buy any first generation Microsoft product. Although it was tempting especially with the new Nokia Lumia 920 as a pair, I was sold on Samsung's S Pen.If you are seeking in depth research on specs and features, there are many great Amazon reviews with such details. I am a casual user and tech/gadget enthusiast. I will probably never tap into the deep potential of the Note 10.1, but that's okay. After several weeks exploring and loving the S Pen, the Samsung Galaxy  Note 10.1 is a definite keeper. I recently purchased an excellent MoKo Slim-Fit Folio Cover Case from Amazon for just $20. I'm glad I didn't buy one for $50 at BestBuy. If you are a student, the Note 10.1 is an excellent tool. I wish this product existed when I was in college. I just bought my wife the Samsung Galaxy Note II phablet. It is like a 5.5\" version of the 10.1 tablet. We are both very satisfied owners of the Samsung Galaxy Note family of products.

It was heavy and starting to show it age, but in general, it was a great device.  I spilled juice on my Xoom, which killed it, and so looked for a new device.  The Galaxy Note had some of the best and most consistently good reviews on the Internet, and given how much I loved and used my previous tablet, I decided to upgrade to the Galaxy.Good:- Lightweight- Good screen- Good sound- The S-Pen is nice, though I use it mostly in games and programs when the touch zones are too small for my fingers.  There are times when you press a button or select something with the pen and it does not register, and you have to press a second time.- Fast, however, while faster than my old Xoom I have to say the difference is not all that noticeable.  It does switch between applications quickly, and when running two applications in split screen, seems to handle them both well.- Connects easily to my PC- Relatively stable.  I have yet to see it freeze or get into a state that requires a reboot.  (But, see my note below)Not so good:- I can feel the body flex when I hold it and I am not confident it would survive a serious fall (I once dropped my Xoom on concrete and it survived).  Also, the body is smooth and slick, and until I had a case I found it hard to keep a firm hold on the device.- The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.  When I got the device I expected to be able to have any 2 apps running at the same time, so I could watch Netflix while using IMDB, etc.  Thus far, I have only found one or two apps from the market that support the split screen function.- I have encountered a number of minor Interface problems, none of them are fatal, but they are annoying.  For example, it will mute itself and it is very hard to unmute, or the settings menu on the taskbar won't open, etc.  These are hard to track down as bugs, but a Google search shows I am not the only one to see these problems.- The amount of bloatware on the device is terrible.  And, you are constantly getting reminders from Google Play to update all of those pre-installed apps that you never use.

I played it at best buy for a while and I was drooling. I gave a few days for myself before put a purchase order. Why? It is pricey, isn't it? I did not want to regret for my decision.I take my Note with me to meetings. I jot down all the discussions during meetings, highlight with digital markers for certain things, add signatures, save my writings as pdf files, and send them to people. I just hate using laptop during meetings - the clicking sound from keyboard just distracts everyone and sometimes it can be quite annoying. Physical papers, nice but archiving it is just pain in the butt. Finally, I am using a digital paper!Also, some apps allow me to take advantage of s-pen's pressure sensitive input. I occasionally sketch things, s-pen is quite responsive and its behavior is predictable although not perfect. Most of the issues arise from apps not the Note/s-pen.My major gripe is lack of specially designed apps. There are just a few of them, mostly included with the Note. Adobe, are you guys working for illustrator for android? Please tell me you are working hard... Photoshop touch is nice but it ain't illustrator.I use Note pretty much indoors, so I am not in the position to tell people whether the screen is bright outside. But I feel it is quite bright, usually I put 30-40 % of maximum brightness.What was the reason to use 30 pin adapter instead of using microUSB? Anyone please explain me the real benefits of using proprietary interface? I am not an electronic engineer so please tell me, is it necessary to do that? I have about dozen microUSB cables in my house and my office, I could just use any of these as I do for my phone. There are only 2 small electronics using proprietary interface in my possession - Cowon J3 and Note 10.1. It is seriously not cool!Well, in my defense I simply could not ignore the quality of sound from J3 and decided to buy it. No regrets, but I hate it whenever I have to find the specific cable. Note 10.1, I got an additional cable... still not cool.Okay, I don't have to charge the Note that often so it is not too bad. But I am hoping the battery has long life.These are my opinions about the Note 10.1 from about a few week long usage. I will update as I get more with my Note in the future.FYI: I am an expert in windows and linux. I do not care for mac and i things, do not agree with the rotten fruit company's policy (I am also fluent in mac os 7, 8, 9, and OSX). Just let you know about my background.Bottom line: the ability of Note to let me write with s-pen and being android are great. Proprietary interface to charge, seriously not cool. Last thing, it is not the Note's fault. Adobe/Google what in the name of Gxx did you guys stop supporting flash in the browser? You guys don't even have backup yet. Can you bring that back?

In calc III and physics III, with SNote I can photograph the whiteboards directly into my notes. I screengrab my calculator app to capture graphs and get those into my notes. It's crazy good at handling this kind of note taking, but I have to say the formula match can get hairy if you're doing advanced maths. It works, but it is particular. I'm still awed by this tablet's power when I'm multitasking. It's become my cookbook, browser, and music in the kitchen many times.I recommend purchasing Samsung Electronics Book Cover for Galaxy Note 10.1-Inch, White  (EFC-1G2NWECXAR) (most protection at thinnest profile), the pen-length stylus with eraser (eraser!!!!) Original Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 & Galaxy Note Genuine Wacom Touch Pen 8pi Stylus (ET-S200EBEG) - Black, and the Microsoft Wedge Mobile Keyboard  bluetooth keyboard to accompany your note 10.1. In class, I prop up the note with the wedge's cover, and with the keyboard I can normally catch most of what the professor says as he says it.I'd give this thing six stars if I could. A seriously overlooked android tablet that regularly outperforms my friends window's 8 machine.It feels like it's from the future six months after I bought it.I bought this tablet for the quad core 1.4 processor and GPU, and the specs altogether, but it was the S Note application together with S Pen that inclined me to the write this glowing review.  Let me start by saying I had low expectations for the S Note app.  I expected a half-assed branded app, put out to brag about as a feature.  What Samsung has delivered here is instead something that can rival LaTex in final product: Neat, orderly notes.  Never mind the smooth, accurate, and responsive pen input, this tablet comes loaded with a pretty accurate function input tool, a shapes tool, and a writing-to-type input feature in it's productivity tools.  Hand write and equation as the professor spews his dirty intellectual filth on his white board, and I jot it down, poorly, and Samsung picks up the slack by turning into a neat formula. I hit \"insert\", size the object down a la MS word, and move it with a drag gesture to place it where I wish.  The take away here is this: If you're a student, don't buy and iPad, buy one of these.  If you're a writer or an engineer or anyone who actually wants neat documents made on the fly WITH YOUR HAND, pick one of these up.  The iPad just can't compete for productivity.  And if you're on the Microsoft side of things with your tablet preference, good news: Samsung owns the stylus tech, the algorithms, and the app, so expect to see a Win RT S Note released on their Win 8 surface products.  That said, the way android performs on this tablet, it's quite capable without x86! I have to mention that this machine is pretty powerful...

It's a better value than iPad2 with more features and functionality. Of special note is the ability to add external storage using MicroSD.I'm a novice to Android, being a Microsoft and Apple user until I bought the Note 10.1, so I can't address this issue. I'll address unit's features that are appealing to me.1. The S-pen is very good, much like the Surface Pro's pen, except it's at half the price.2. Handwriting recognition is restricted to S Note and other Samsung apps. In order to use handwriting recognition in editing a Word document using other apps, say, TextMaker, I have to download another handwriting recognition app such as 7notes with Mazec, which has its own issues.3. The display is nice and bright and the unit can be used even outside on a sunny day. However, the glossy display reflects badly. Applying a matt screen protector affects the S-pen's functionality somewhat, making it less sensitive and creating a drag. It'd be great have a glass anti-glare display finish that does not affect the S-pen's functionality.4. Battery drain seems faster than iPad. I have to charge pretty much every other day and at times daily if I use it a lot. I don't remember having to recharge the iPad the same day regardless of usage.5. Speakers stereo separation is very good but the lower frequency sound is poor.6. Screen rotation is a bit too sensitive. I found I had to switch it off more frequently than I had to with the iPad.7. S Note is the highlight of the unit and the reason I bought the tablet. It's very good and enables tracking pen strokes in a video mode and voice narration. They are *not* automatically synchronized--you have to do it yourself when you play back pen strokes and the narration. Nonetheless, it impressed the audience.8. The many S Note templates are a bit gimmicky. After trying a few, I found myself just starting new notes on a normal sheet.9. The S Note has a feature that gives you straight lines and geometrical shapes. Very useful in making simply drawings.Over all, I'm pleased with the unit and would recommend others to take a closer look before paying double for a Surface Pro or an iPad2, both of which I had used and returned, but I'm keeping this baby.", "Title": "A Very Good Tablet with a Few Flaws", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Author": "Steve Hehl", "ReviewID": "RGPKC8X1USPJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've played around with Apple products, both the iPhone & the iPad, and have found more freedom & capbility to do the my routine tasks and more with the Note 10.1.

The S- Pen is great for writing , drawing , photo editing and such Ive used stylii since the old palm pilot days and I have a wacom capture tablet connected to my computer already so I am totally at home with it .It comes preloaded with photoshop for android which I had already tried out on my Note 2 cell phone and Im quite happy with it .The speakers face you and give good sound and Ive been able to use hbo go ,netflix , crunchy roll and youtube with great results .the optimum app will not work on the the note as of yet but thats no fault of the tablet , thats optimums fault for not updating the app for use on more android tablets .blue tooth headphones as well as regular headphones work fine , of course that also depends on your sound taste .As for connectivity I was able to use the allshare program to connect to my note 2 cell phone as well as my computer and send files back and forth no problem . You can also connect directly to your omputer using the included usb cable and transfer files either using the Kies software or windows media player .Storage is 32 gb but you dont want to use that for saving files and media , the tablet will hold up to a 64 gb card and thats where you should save all of your pics and vids and music to I am using a sanddisk ultra 64 very zippy and smooth .i did purchase the Aduro Samsung Galaxy tab extra long usb charge and sync cable thank god because the one that comes with it is like 5 inches I have no idea what they where thinking when they came up with that one . SO if you just want a Tablet to have one there are alot of cheaper ones out there that are just fine , But if you are artistic or a student or need to be able to wite down things then this is a must have .

Also, I use both google calendar and Lotus Notes to schedule meetings and possible work at the clients' facilities and email messaging, both these services sync seamlessly with my smartphone (a samsung Galaxy Note 1) .Since I tend to write down a lot of notes during meetings, the stylus was a feature I was pumped for in this tablet, and I have to say it is the closest you can get to pen and paper without having to invest in more expensive wacom digitizers. Another great feature on this tablet is the fact that I can sync the notes I take using the S Note app with my smartphone instantly, so even if I leave the tablet at home I still carry all my meeting data with me.As a media consumption/entertainment device the Note 10.1 is very good but not the greatest.On the plus side, the Note10.1 comes with the PEEL remote app which lets you sync the tablet with your TV and DVR and it works as an universal remote. It has access to both google play video, google play music and samsung media hub right out of the box; it also supports DLNA.A great hardware feature found on this and all 10 inch samsung tablets is the placement of stereo speakers on both sides of the tablet facing the user, and not on the back like most vendors tend to place them, this makes harder for the user to block them while holding the device and projects the sound better.The tablet also comes with a microSD expansion slot up to 32GB so you have a generous amount of space for music and HD video.What hampers this tablet media capabilities however: it's screen resolution (a weak 1280x800 versus the 1920x1200 of the Asus Transformer Prime, which also offers microSD expansion capabilities).So, if you are looking for a solid 10 inch productivity tablet with a solid performance and good media consumption capabilities, this is a great choice, if you are, however, in the market for an entertainment tablet then the choice should go to either the Asus Transformer Prime or Nexus 10 on the Android side of things or the iPad Retina on the iOS side.", "Title": "Great productivity tablet, specially if you are invested deeply into the google ecosystem", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Author": "graphics gal \"Lynne\u00e1\"", "ReviewID": "R1J9XLDO18XH9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Note Tablet is worth the extra cash if you are an artist or aspire to be.

Our 4-year-old watches videos on this and, with the case we have, it's not possible to stand the tablet up for watching while it's plugged in. The cable gets mashed on the bottom of the tablet.

It is beautiful as well as easy to use. I love how clean and crisp the screen is.  Video viewing is clear and there is hardly any lag when watching videos online.  The sound is loud enough and I don't hear any popping or weird echoey noises.  The stylus is a nice added bonus.  Wasn't thrilled with the idea of having a stylus when I purchased the tablet but is does come in handy when wanting to add those extra writing touches or on drawing apps.  Plus it has a home built right into the side of the tablet where it clicks into place. Haven't played too much with Photoshop touch but it does come with the tablet which is a nice bonus for those who like to play with images.The battery life is not bad..I use the tablet about 4 hours a day and I usually charge it after two days of use...by then it is down to 25% range.  You could probably use it for a full day without having to charge.I do not have a keyboard.  Haven't felt like I needed to spend the extra money on one yet.  The touch keyboard works pretty well.  Spacing isn't too far off a normal keyboard but smaller of course.A few negatives:  Not enough GB space.  I take a lot of videos and pics of my family and of course those take up a lot of space.  Ended up buying a 32GB mini SD card for the tablet which does give me 64 GB which helps.  (I know about the cloud and drop box options but not a fan yet of putting my personal stuff out there.)  Also was upset that it came with no USB adapter. There is only one slot on the tablet. It is used for charging as well as a connector for Memory cards, USB's or anything else you might need to link to the tablet. You cannot charge while you add files!  Do price shop for a USB adaptor! They are way cheaper online than in stores.  The charge cord is a little short.  Maybe 3 feet which isn't much if you want to plug in the wall and sit down on the couch with it.  I tend to charge overnight.Overall a very easy tablet to work with and it feels good in your hands. The Android system is a pleasant alternative to Windows 8 which is a little businessey for me.  I tend to use the tablet more for play than work (games, videos, pics, doodling, web surfing). Plus if you have an Android phone once you log into Google the tablet adds all your phone apps to your tablet. Made life so much easier to not have to re-download all my favorite apps again.

As soon as I heard about the Note I knew it was the one for me.Now I write, I write a lot. I've got notepads all over. I prefer writing to typing, it feels more creative...Then I've got to put those notepads into a computer so that I can edit, and maybe just plain read them in a document program.I've always found it very annoying, boring, and full of effort, to have to type up what I've already written.The S Pen is a Godsend for me; Handwriting recognition is amazing, and you can use it anywhere (Any app, and browser, even for URLs. The one thing it doesn't work for is passwords).I've barely used the keyboard since I got the tablet.You can choose the default thickness and color of the Pen, not that exciting but some buyers might like that.I mostly write in Google Drive and I only tried the S Pen programs when I first turned the device on (I don't feel that I need those programs when I can write straight to my document).A couple things to keep in mind, since perfect is too good to be true:It's not as easy to select links in web browsers with the Pen as it is with a finger, sometimes I find myself trying 3 or so times before it selects.Certain things are hard for the tablet to recognize (and it probably depends on your handwriting), I have a less than easy time with quotations, commas, and the occasional letter (it does not like my g's). Most of that is likely because I have atrocious handwriting.It is more accurate with letters and symbols if you're writing a sentence than if you go back to add (it gets my quotation marks usually on the first try when I'm composing a whole sentence)--although it is very easy to edit previous words you've written.Another thing to keep in mind is that when the S Pen is near the screen, it activates (which means that it won't detect touch). I sometimes combine Pen and hand, and don't realize right away that touch isn't working because the Pen in my other hand, which rests against the case, is too close to the tablet.Multi App:Not that much to say about it as I can't test it on many apps. Seems like it works great.The problem that most people complain about -- lack of apps that work with it -- isn't on Samsung's end; developers have to make their apps compatible with the multi app feature in order to use them.There's no telling how many developers will decide to do that, maybe if more tablets are made with that feature?If there's any questions about my review I'd be happy to try and answer them.", "Title": "If You Want to Write with a Stylus This is the Tablet to Buy", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Author": "adunbar", "ReviewID": "R3VG1DU0NVCEEB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great device and very useful for teaching and other such tasks.

I began realizing my iPad was just not very flexible when it came to more than pixels per square inch or how many apps are in the store. It became a huge hassle navigating between 2 apps that I needed open at the same time. It was a pain trying to write with a stylus with a tip as large as my little finger. It took up valuable time having to sign in to the iTunes store every time I wanted a new app or wanted to look at app inventory.The Galaxy Note 10.1 does away with all of that. I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen. May not sound like much but wait until you try it, you will wonder how you ever did without it. The stylus for the Note is one of the main reasons for getting the Note (along with the multitasking). I am \"middle aged\" but in college and I take LOTS of notes. Trying to take notes with an iPad stylus was so frustrating that I gave up after several tries and money wasted on styluses with huge tips and writing that looked like it was done with a giant Sharpie that has a smushed tip. It was typical to get about 8 lines of text on a page before having to open a new blank page in my notebook.The Note's thin tip and adjustable text size really makes taking notes on a tablet truly useful. Going to the app store and loading new apps is totally painless since I never have to login to the store. Also there is the Samsung App Store and Google Play to choose from when looking for safe and supported apps. I can connect other non-Samsung devices to my tablet so I don't have to buy proprietary adapters. I can increase my storage with Micro SD cards or use them to access media I don't want to load onto the Note. The display is fabulous, clear, clean and crisp. Once you reach a certain amount of pixels it doesn't matter anymore. The human eye can only detect so much resolution before improvement stops. I don't know if the Note has a \"retina\" display and I don't care because I don't see how it could get any better. The Note is lightning quick. More so than my iPad in every way. Apps load quicker, apps open quicker, pages switch quicker and on and on.Bottom line is that the Galaxy Note, in my opinion, out does the iPad in just about every arena. The iPad now seems a little childish with it's \"one-thing-at-a-time\" limitations. I have always been irked by Apple's attitude towards the rest of the tech world. They use connectors no one else uses, they don't let the user make any adjustments to anything (especially storage, I hate that), iTunes is such a pain to use with its proprietary format and focus on the app store instead of the user.The Note has really made it useful to have a tablet. The interface and features are geared towards the user, not the company. I can do such much more with my tablet now and I don't get frustrated every day because of what my tablet can't do. The Note does everything and does it all well. I cannot see ever going backwards by getting another iPad.EDIT: It has been a couple of months and I still love the Note 10.1. HOWEVER, there is some sort of ongoing issue with Samsung's cables. My Note stopped charging with both AC charger and through USB. Looking through the Internet I see I am not alone, a long way from it. Many, many users have reported the same issue. I ordered several replacement cables (Note to charger/USB) and a new AC adapter. Using both new adapter and cable my Note charged flawlessly. Used new cable and old charger and it charged, used old cable and new charger and NO CHARGE. The cables are the problem. In fact one of my new cables came with the tablet plug 30 degrees tilted in its casing! Defective before it left the warehouse! Samsung is impossible to contact regarding these issues and when you find a way to contact them you may never get an answer, at least I didn't. So, Samsung's Customer Service leaves MUCH to be desired, BUT the Note is a fabulous device that I grow to like more each day. Be prepared to spend a few extra dollars on replacement cables (order extras when you order your Note) but the device is worth the added expense.", "Title": "Samsung Wins Hands Down", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3TUTD6YEY4OLA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've wanted a tablet since the first ipad came out, but couldn't justify the price.

(I prefer reading than being stuck watching a 5 minute video instead of spending 15 seconds reading how to find a function.)There is one drawback which, to me is quite problematic and could become huge over time.  I'll update this review if it does.The power cord attachment is at the bottom of the tablet rather than the side.  So if you want to put it in a case that allows you to position it in an upright  or easel position  while charging, the Power attachment is scrunched against the desk or bottom surface, with the cord bent over.  I hope it won't ruin the connection over time and keep it from charging.The case I bought has an opening for the charger, so that you can put it in easel position.  But if you try to just open the case, and go directly to easel position you risk bending the power attachment. To get it to work you have to detach the tablet from the cover then move it.

It feels quite solid, similar to the one that I messed around with at Best Buy.  The S Pen is a bit smaller than expected, but I have tiny hands. So far so good.It runs smoother than my two year old smart phone, and is quicker than my Asus EP121. That is all I wanted. I do not think the pen actually has 1024 levels of pressure, having used Wacom tablets for 10 years, but it works well  despite this.My arm tends to bump the menu at the bottom when I am writing notes, but this is a minor annoyance. Also the tablet is only available right now in black at 32gb storage. Oh well. No accessories yet either, at least nothing official from  samsung.I would reccomend this. I think there may be a number of bad units floating around though based on some of the reviews. My experience so far has been great!  I will update this if that changes.EDIT: So after owning this for a couple months now, I'd like to update.1. On the cracking/squeaking: It appears that this comes from the hollow zone where the S-pen inserts. I can now hear creaking when I move the device around a bit or pick it up from this side, but it isn't anything I'm concerned about. It's more noticeable when the S-pen is out but I don't really think it is a problem.2. This thing is great for taking class notes! I love it for my coursework. The software it is shipped with is not so good for writing on PDFs (it's super annoying to import them into S-Note) so I ended up purchasing a 3rd party app that works pretty well. Also the fact that you can't change the default backgrounds easily in S-Note is annoying. But I find myself using S-Note more than the 3rd party app I purchased for notetaking (Quill).3. The screen resolution has not been a problem. Everything looks crisp and nice.4. Battery life is great. I can watch Netflix for around 5-6 hours before I need to plug in. I took it with me to the airport and was able to watch 3 2-hour movies on a single charge. Granted my screen was not on full brightness and I turned off all the extras (wifi, etc). In normal note-taking mode where I am using it for class etc I can get a full class day out of it (at least 8 hours), even with web browsing etc, and still have juice left over to do stuff when I get home without charging!

I debated between an Ipad and the Note, and the features of the Note wowed me!  The Ipad seemed to me to be rather limited in its capabilities, simplistic, really.I did worry, however, about the comments I had read about the Note's screen resolution, that it didn't measure up to the Ipad's.  Well, I've got to say, that on a 10\" screen, I'm not sure how OBVIOUS a difference there is between the two.  Blow up the screen to a 13\" + size, and, then the difference would be clear.So, the s-pen is fabulous.  Feel it skim across the screen.  A delight!  Still haven't figured out the programs included, but I'm new to the tablet world, so the learning process is a positive challenge for me!I ordered a gel cover for the back of the Note.  From what I read, the glass is quite resistant to scratches.  Will see how the gel works when it arrives.Also, just read yesterday (Oct. 8, 2012), that Consumer Reports gave the Note 10.1 a RAVE review.  That's a comforting sign.So, with that comment, I'll say, do your homework about the Note 10.1.  Go to a store (Best Buy) and play with it.  Compare it to the Ipad.  Which one FEELS right for you?  And if you purchase the Note 10.1, make SURE that the two seals on the box are intact.  (My first purchase had been opened, repacked and sold as a new device!

The Galaxy Note 10.1 has the potential of being the best of both worlds. I can still write my notes with a pen and have them stored forevermore in the Note, unlike all those little slips of paper that tend to get misplaced.The S-Note app, however, is rather rudimentary and buggy. Today, while using the app to make some notes, my handwriting was converted to text but that text immediately disappeared from the page. Also, the app froze the screen a couple of times, requiring a restart of the tablet.As others have mentioned, text formatting options are very limited for text that has been converted from handwriting. If you hand write a few words and then pause, the handwriting is converted to text. You then have to tap the space button. Otherwise, the next word converted will be joined to the previous word. EXAMPLE: You write, \"This is a test of handwriting\" You pause and the handwriting is converted. You resume writing, \"accuracy\". What you get is: \"This is a test of handwritingaccuracy\" I HOPE the next version of the S-Note software will have an \"Auto Space After Last Word\" option. I have to say though that I am impressed with it's ability to interpret my rather poor penmanship.Another feature that I would like is the ability to convert handwriting after the fact rather than on the fly. For example, I would like to hand write a whole page and then let the app convert the whole page to text at once. And I would like to be able to select a portion of a handwritten page and convert just that portion to text.Samsung, are you listening?!?", "Title": "Great Hardware.

Nice product.", "Title": "Good Device", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R307FWS0HKQQAO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a tablet to use for college as several of my classes either required or highly recommended a tablet over a laptop for note taking during clinical. My first thought was, as it is for most people, to look into the iPad. Since I have a galaxy phone, I figured it would probably be easier to stick with the same OS so as not to have to buy new apps and start all over. I was glad I did because I came across the Galaxy Note and couldn't be happier with it.Why I love it:-The price: I got it during a lightning deal and paid WAY less than I thought I would for a tablet of this size and specs. As any college student will tell you, saving money wherever you can is a huge plus-The size: I love the 10.1\" display, the resolution is great and while it may not be quite as nice as the iPad Retina display, it looks great for movies, games, and of course school work. The tablet itself is pretty thin and easy to hold for extended use.-S Pen: My main use for this tablet is for taking notes and studying, and the S Pen makes this tablet perfect for that. Normal tablets use stylus that make your handwriting illegible because of the big eraser like tip, but the S Pen allows for fine, pressure sensitive writing that looks and feels just like writing on paper. It also works great for drawing/photo editing if you're into that.-Front Facing Speakers- Im not sure why, but a lot of tablet manufacturers **cough cough-Apple-cough cough** have really neglected peoples desire for front facing speakers. To me it just makes sense that when ever you listen to music or watch videos your looking at the screen so dual front facing speakers like the Galaxy Note's just seem to make sense.-The OS/Apps: Coming from a Galaxy phone I like the set up, but I also want to give a shout out to two included free apps, S Note and Photoshop Touch. S Note is great for taking notes and comes with tons of great features (really good for students) and Photoshop is a whole lot of fun to play around with, even is you have no experience with PS. Google Play has tons of apps to download or sideload so you'll be set with tons of optionsThe One (and only) Thing I Do Not like about it:-The charging cord: This version of the Note uses a proprietary  charging/data cord (included), but it would be nice if it used the standard micro usb as the galaxy phones and many other smart phones. On that note, I believe the 2014 version uses the micro usb cord.Bottom word: Get this tablet! I use it everyday and have never regretted purchasing it. Its a great tablet for the price, a lot of fun, and great for school work, business use or just for fun. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.", "Title": "Awesome Device!

Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R2BBCF6XHBSOUN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's get the cons out of the way b/c I'm sure that's #1 priorityCons1) Icon text and system text are not clear. Also small text looks like they suffer massive pixel shortage (which is not true).BUT texts are incredibly clear and legible when reading books or watching caption on video, or viewing normal/large/larger text on the website. If you compare those activities with one of those $500 tablets like Ipad Air, Note 2014 or Lumia 2025, they all look the same.2) Awkward positions for control buttons.For example, if you use a tablet case and lay your tablet horizontally, the volume, headphone input, and power buttons will be on the bottom. In other words, you can't use your headphone (unless u flip it the other way), adjust your volume, or turn off/on the screen unless you have to lift up your tablet.3) Proprietary charging/data sync cable. It is not the standard USB micro. It is the Samsung 30 pin or something cable.Pros1) Battery life is longer than the Note 8. I was able to watch movies for more than 4 hours straight.2) Not heavy at all considering it weighs 650 grams.3) Responsive and fast for an old processor. I did not notice any lag when switching between apps or playing game, movies.4) S-Pen is great (don't use the S-pen apps, they are ineffective and inefficient at best). You have to buy the 8 PI S pen to truly appreciate the accuracy of the pen though. The included S-pen is only 6 pi.5) No real buttons. You navigate the tablet using the on-screen buttons. This is incredibly helpful when using with the S-pen and everything else. It really helps you when you are holding the tablet too.Conclusion- I feel that this tablet has so much potential if it wasn't for Samsung failed on the S-pen app and the awkward positions of the volume, power, microphone input buttons. In addition, for some reason the text clarity of the system icon and small texts are garbled. This does not make a good impression on first time buyer especially when they they think a tablet is an Ipad.", "Title": "awkward positions for control buttons but overal 4.5 out of 5 rating tablet - must buy", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Author": "Allin2max", "ReviewID": "R35LF8F1DDSEEL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung had already come out with a 2nd generation Note when I purchased this device, but the quad core processor clearly beats most of the other tablets including the newer Apple device.", "Title": "Quad Core punch !", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "Stephen J.

After a few months of having the Asus Infinity in my shopping cart, I finally decided on the Note.  And I  am very happy I did.  It is everything I've read about and then some.I will spare the reader from what has already been said.  I will however echo one point I feel is important.  I took some other owner's advice from the reviews and went with a refurb Note.  Saved around $120 which I put into the various items for my Note.  It arrived from the outlet in immaculate condition with all its items, and with all updates installed.  No issues at all.  So, something to maybe consider.I'll also take a second to comment on a case.  I decided to stay with what I know and dropped $90 on the Otterbox Defender case for it also (available on their website).  I have had an OB for all my phones and didn't want to scrimp on this tablet.  Typical OB, it does add girth to the tablet, but I love it.  Two issues though.  One, items like the SD/USB reader don't fit because the case is thick and the reader's connector is not long enough to engage.  Second, the formidable built-in screen protector of the OB drastically cuts down on the S-Pen's sensitivity.  I ended up removing it (easy enough) and going with the normal screen protectors offered on Amazon.  Again, no issue with that. But again, I'm a fan of Otterbox, and this case is no different.So, all in all, I love my Note and am enjoying the daylights out of it.  Can't wait for school to start so I can use it in class.  I highly recommend this product.

So assuming that this is better than any other tablet out there for the desired application, I will address some of the drawbacks (which are present in many devices).Although multiple applications can be opened (which isn't even supported on many tablets), more than one instance of the same application cannot run at any time.  I was trying to view a pdf and have a word document concurrently open to take notes.  This does not work directly as you have to open/close each to switch back and forth.  In this instance I got around it by importing the pdf into the notes application.  Then I could view the pdf through the notes application and the word document through to document application.Samsung is not playing nice with Adobe and so it does not have flash player.  I have amazon prime and was hoping to view videos through my subscription.  Not so, because no flash player.  There is apparently a way around this also by downloading a legacy version of flash player, but haven't tried this out yet.The stylus does take some getting use to, but it is easy and responsive.If you intend to take notes, use written comments, annotations, etc. then this is what you need.

The pen is enormously useful for annotating PDFs and image editing.  The included pen applications are very good, and there are some more pen applications in the market.There are some niggling problems.  In many apps, the pen is difficult to use because palm rejection doesn't work or doesn't work well; it would be great if one could disable touch altogether when using the pen.  The plastic case is a fingerprint magnet and feels cheap; you probably want to put it into a case.The Samsung accessory plug is a major nuisance.  You need multiple expensive accessories just to hook up USB host, SD cards, and HDMI.  The plug sticks out the bottom and interferes with cases and stands (you can turn the tablet upside down to avoid that, but then the cameras don't work properly).  You can't just hook up a micro-USB cable for charging, so if you didn't bring your Samsung charger, you're out of luck.  Trying to do multiple things at once (like, oh, viewing camera images on a TV) becomes an exercise in frustration.The HDMI output in particular is nearly useless: it requires an external power source, the HDMI output is in an odd format (a black bar at the bottom) and doesn't work with some HDMI displays at all.  This means the Galaxy Note 10.1 is not a solution for business or academic presentations, since you have to set it up with a rat's nest of cables and then still aren't guaranteed that it will even work.  This really bothers me, because it means I have to take the Galaxy tablet and then another device for giving a presentation; more often than not, I just leave the Galaxy tablet at home because of it.I'm also not particular fond of Samsung's modifications to the Android UI.  If they stuck with standard Android, they'd have a better product.  Unfortunately, Samsung spoils all their tablets with these little problems; they seem to try to imitate Apple and don't realize that many people buy Android tablets because they want standard, open UIs and connectors.  If I wanted to have a completely proprietary \"ecosystem\" and spend hundreds of dollars on accessories, I might as well get an iPad.In the end, if you need a tablet with a pen, this is the tablet to get because the pen is really good.  If you just want a 10\" Android tablet and don't really need the pen, this is still a good tablet, but frankly, you can get better tablets without Samsung's little annoyances from other vendors and pay a little less for the tablet, and a lot less for accessories.", "Title": "great tablet with some flaws", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RWGM75SUJRN3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife.

I was hoping to replace my aging iPad 2. My iPad 2 was experiencing memory issues and couldn't handle running more than one app or browser tab at the same time. I figured the note 10 would be great since it has 2gb of ram, offers real multitasking and the multi apps feature. I had read about people experiencing clicking and creaking with their note 10. I tried 2 of them out and both had this issue. The first was really bad it creaked and clicked all over the place. The second one mostly creaked and clicked around the s pen area and then began doing it on the left bottom corner. I also experienced the wifi dropping on the second note I tried. Then I also found considerable backlight bleeding on the second note. Besides the the defect issues I experienced I found the note 10 a pleasure to use. The note 10 is the lightest and thinnest tablet on the market. I really loved the sound on it with its stereo front facing speakers. The screen was also great looking I didn't even notice that it wasn't 1080p or a retina display. I did find the note to be on the slow side at times I did experience lag. I had about 100 apps installed and 2 widgets on the home screen. I also tried using other launchers asi know touch wiz tends to slow down the device down like it has on my s3. I found the s3 to be slow considering it has 2gb of ram. I didn't like the stock email app which is also on my s3. In order to view an email in HTML format you must first scroll to the bottom of the email then click on load more. I knew that the note had a 16:9 format and thought I would be ok with it, but I didn't like reading or viewing web pages in portrait mode as it was to narrow for me. I much prefer the 4:3 for reading. Although 16:9 is great for video and gaming. I also knew that android has much fewer tablet apps than apple and thought I would just get by without them and use the websites. In the end I missed a bunch of tablet apps I use a lot on my iPad 2. I really missed the flipboard, Facebook, twitter, imdb and pocket apps. The s pen is really cool especially for some one who draws or takes notes. I note much of a stylus person, but I do read that the stylus on the note is the best from any tablet. I also liked the idea of the multi apps feature. It's main downfall is you can't use it with any app you choose. Only selected Samsung apps work in multi app mode. Would be nice if you could use any browser you choose or YouTube or other apps. The peel universal remote was also really cool. It worked with all my devices (2 Samsung tvs, apple tv 2, Sony blu ray). I did experience some issues with the remote but for the most part it worked. One main draw back with the remote is that it wouldn't let control every function of a device. There was also a lack of customization with the controls.  I was also surprised to see there was no s voice on the note tablet. There was the google voice actions which had very limited functionality. Besides the quality control issues I may have actually replaced my iPad 2  completely with the note 10. When comparing this tablet with the Asus tf201 I tried early this year. Samsung has come a long way. This note 10 is much better than the asus tablets on the market now.  This tablet is also a huge improvement over previous Samsung tablets. I ended up buying the iPad 3. It doesn't have as many features as the note 10, but it's easy to use, it's reliable and it just works. I did spend a few hundred dollars more on the iPad 3 than the note 10 but I am happy. I get to use my favorite apps and a higher resolution screen. I may revisit the note 10 gets the jellybean update. I may end up waiting for the nexus 10 tablet to finally get what I want.

It's easy to be swayed by the Note, but other than showing off and being happy about its entertainment value and beauty, it's a bit unnerving. Having to learn all its quirks and options (especially with the stylus) requires a long and steep learning curve, there are absolutely no instructions, so prepare for having to google for just about anything a bit more sophisticated you want to do. I had intended to use the Note for my office, to show movie clips to clients and to type notes. That's when things got complicated. While the calendar syncs with my Galaxy S3, Notes do not. And the pre-installed office app does not print to my Epson Workforce printer (it insists it can only print to a Samsung printer), requiring awkward work-arounds that got me really irritated. So, after I bought a 64 gig sd card and a Logitech bluetooth keyboard and a cover for the whole thing (we are now at almost $700), I suddenly realized that this is a lot of money for checking emails, watching Netflix and browsing the Internet. I returned the Note and all its accessories - for that kind of money, it needs to do more: offer a keyboard, a cover or sleeve, and allow to print to any printer (I believe since addressed with Android Kitkat). If you have money to spend and want a great looking toy with a brilliant screen and value entertainment over productivity, I say go for it. All others are better off with something else.PROS: Beautiful, brilliant screen, great sound, lots of features, long battery life, plain fun to useCONS: Hampered productivity, questionable usefulness of stylus, no instructions or manual, very expensiveRECOMMEND: For entertainment purposes absolutely, anything else is a more of an expensive joke really.", "Title": "An expensive toy with little productivity", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "Keely", "ReviewID": "R2815YKRMNILN8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Got this tablet for my husband as a gift and for 6 months it was great and he was extremely happy with it.

On paper and specification details it sounds like it should be great. It was actually just OK for me. The pen was cool but didn't really use it as much as I thought I would after the new wore off. The display is OK. It wasn't horrible and it wasn't fantastic. I liked having the expansion capabilities with micro SD card slot but the proprietary dock/USB port was a pain. I was set to keep the tablet but it started to have performance issues. Weird things like when the screen was locked and I rotated the tablet there would be a flash of the home screen or one of the programs running in the background. The audio became occasionally inoperative and the headphone jack would crackle when using my ear buds. I tried other buds thinking there might be an issue with them but it was a consistent result, especially when turning the jack in the port. The OS was fast at first but as I added Apps it got slower and choppy. I did a hard set twice and it came back as fast as new but it would slow again as I added Apps back in. This was a major concern as the tablet could accept a 64gb micro SD card for expansion and would lend itself to installing more apps in the future. I do think Samsung has the right idea about the speakers in the front, genius really! And the sound quality and volume were excellent. At this stage in the game I don't see the need for proprietary connectors. I ended up buying an iPad 4 and my complaint is the same for Apple. I like the Lightning port better than the old 30 pin connector but still, proprietary? Why? Maybe I got one with some manufacturing issues and maybe some of the issues are Ice Cream Sandwich issues that will be resolved with Jelly Bean when it lands for the Galaxy. So, while I returned my Galaxy Note 10.1, I can't say it isn't a great tablet for others. It just didn't suit my likes and desire for a \"Whole package\". Maybe I just bought before it was out long enough to shake out the bugs! I have had 2 other Android tablets in the past, the Acer Iconia A500 and the Asus Transformer TF101.

It seems that everytime a new tablet comes out like this, set at this price point, people ask \"is this the ipad killer\"? Well no, this one ISNT. Im not an apple fanboy, in fact, I dont own a single apple product, I do own a bunch of android devices though and I have to say from experience, this one isnt too hot. This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device. Its an android with a few modifications, such as the stylus input interface and the multi tasking ability. That is, you can have multiple apps running at the same time on screen but at this point, the number apps that are compatible is VERY limited.Second, the advert reads \"Exceptional Performance with Quad Core Processor\". Saying its \"Exceptional\" is a very strong statement. It performs at or near the same level as my Nexus 7. The ads also seems to boast note taking ability on ebooks, but I found that reading pdf still is still shaky as pages take a second or two to render.Third, the bad. As you have probably read from other reviews, this feels like a cheap McDonalds toy. The plastic is a joke. The tablet actually gives a little when hold it. The plastic screeches and groans.One of previous actual \"exceptional\" devices  I owned was the touch pad, which had a plastic back. That is how youre supposed to do it, it was hard plastic that didn't give or make noise when you held it.Unless you can get this in some kind of sale, for like $200, it is not worth it. I actually use my nexus 7 way more than this piece of garbage. If you want 10.1 tablet, wait for the Nexus 10. The nexus 7 is actually an exceptional device and at $200. it would nt surprise me if the N10 was around 300-350. Or get the amazon tablet. All of these awesome devices are coming out at actual competitive prices, who the heck can justify paying 550 for THIS?!", "Title": "Meh, I have to agree with others on the quaility", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Author": "ElliotR.R", "ReviewID": "R5BT95X7DXD0C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is a pretty descent tablet, I will say that. I saw the James Franco commercial and immediately decided to buy it. I cant say I want to keep it though because of a couple of problems that make this tablet a joke.The most significant is the quality of materials. Go online, and look at pictures or videos of the material up close and you will see that it looks soooo cheap. For a $500 tablet, this is inexcusable. The plastic actually bends and creaks when you press it down. I guess that isn't too bad, so long as it works. But at $500, that is a slap in the face. I really believe this tablet wont last at $500 for too long.The second big problem is the screen resolution. It is horrible for this generation of tablets, specially from a flagship product from a company that manufactures the iPad screens. It not aweful screen but its not what you pay for at $500. trust me,DO NOT BUY THIS.*Extra info: I bought this device at a local ELECTRONICS store because I was on the fence about buying it. I wasnt satisfied after using it for a couple of days so I had to return it. Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine. But the two things that are holding it back, in my opinion is the cheap build quality and screen res. If you bought and are saying those are somethings you can overlook or live with, more power to you. But to those people I also ask, wouldnt it be much better, or wouldnt you feel like you got your money's worth more if it had a solid metal backing, or maybe even a better screen res? You cant tell me that the metal would have made it way heavier because I was upgrading from my asus transformer prime, which had an aluminum back and was super light. Also, if you never went a store, just saw the pictures online, you would think that it actually was made of some solid metal. The back has that brushed metal texture look, so you could tell that the designers were going for that, deceptive as it might be. Now you can tell me that its not cheap plastic, that it might even be some super polymer or what ever but to me it felt cheap. And even if higher res screens are overrated, I dont see why a $500 device wouldnt have one.And all of this would be fine if it werent for the ridiculous price tag. My point is just this, for $500, which what HIGH END tablets are going for, I would expect a little better. I had a xoom first, then I upgraded to a transformer primer. But since I am a college student, I really wanted a stylus capable device. That is something this tablet does well, I will admit. My argument is that people shouldnt buy this because I believe that doing so would show Samsung they cant pull this kind of move.
