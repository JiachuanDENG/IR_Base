You get what you paid for. My son has a Galaxy that's great. But he paid a lot more.

I charged it, the green light is on, full charge but will not turn on or light up, nothing! I dislike like it because even with my pen or finger the touch screen wont let my click on small items. I recommend this to no one untill I hear a response back from the seller.", "Title": "did love it", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Author": "yaya", "ReviewID": "R1DC6NA3EZO70R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i dont recommend it felt so cheap for the price, go to wal mart and buy one for $50 bucks its better quality", "Title": "bad", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "ProductID": "B00E9TMZL0", "Features": null, "ImgURL": null, "Name": null}}
