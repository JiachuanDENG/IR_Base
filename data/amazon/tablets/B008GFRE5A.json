{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Trent", "ReviewID": "R3LDEQ74UDEZYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the Kindle Fire 1st gen, and decided to go with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" since it solved some of the issues I had with the first one.  There are plenty of reviews about what the tablet functionality includes, so I'll only cover some basic things about how it compares to the first gen Kindle Fire and some notable items about how to improve the HD with better apps. Toward the bottom of this review I provide instructions to installing the Dolphin Web Browser, which is the single best thing you can do to improve the Kindle Fire HD.A few notable improvements from the Kindle Fire 1st Generation:* Volume buttons: this is huge! Big improvement. Although I think the buttons should be separated a little to tell them apart, or be physical different somehow to tell which one is increase or decrease.* Freetime: huge improvement. I don't worry about giving it to my kids any more, and my kids love it!* Generally it's more responsive, the screen is better quality, and I like the size much more. As far as the screen goes my 7\" Kindle Fire was good for reading books, but not so much for browsing the internet. If I needed/wanted to browse for something I'd usually fire up my laptop for a full browser.  The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" larger screen and resolution makes a huge difference. I'm no longer using my laptop as much and able to more quickly look up things I need on the Kindle. It's a full tablet! Of course, this is also a slight negative--I could fit my old Kindle in some pant and coat pockets so it was easier to take around with me. I can't do that, and I'm taking it with me more. I'm a little more afraid of losing it.Now a few things about the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" specifically:* Overall I like much of it. The UI is great for novice and intermediate users. I'm an advanced user, and I still think it works pretty well for my purposes with a few simple enhancements I'll mention below.  If you like Amazon's platform and have Prime, it's a no-brainer. Free books via the Lending Library or just free titles is great!* Video is a real standout with this: I'm going to cancel my subscription to Netflix now! Netflix's catalog is going downhill quick, and is still terribly difficult to search for good content. On the flipside, Amazon's Instant Video on the Fire is now much better! I love how the free Instant Video is the 1st option when opening the video tab, and how they have shortcuts immediately to Editors Pick and Just for kids. Makes it simple to find good video, and it looks great output to my TV in HD.  I've also installed the HBO To Go app and found it's awesome as well. HBO directly on it! I've also found myself just watching video on the Fire instead of plugging it up to my TV or turning on my TiVo for the same content--just easier.* Integration with Audible is awesome! I used Audible several years ago and found when I logged in dozens of old Audio books I can download in a moment, with great quality.  It almost makes me want to go back to Audible. I use Overdrive now and borrow from my local public library to my iPod, so probably will still do that.* Books:  it's a great ebook reader. I hate to say it but I prefer most books to be on my Kindle now. Don't forget you can get them from your public library as well (search for Overdrive!). One negative is that I can't put books into folders and I have a lot of books. Oh well...* Integration with Amazon's cloud drive for music and files works great as well. Not much to say but it works flawlessly.The device is great but does have some flaws:* Most notably, Silk is a terrible web browser. Mine crashes continually and is very slow. Even after turning off \"acceleration\" it's slow.  See a fix below for this.* The battery life is so-so. I'm getting around 6-7 hours of use before the battery is dead.* It really should have a forward looking camera.* It would be very nice if Amazon allowed more advanced control over the settings of the device.  There are tons of things I'd like to customize, but since this is a more controlled environment than other Android tablets, I just can't. One example:  I get lots of email for work and personal use, and as a result I don't like audible email notifications. However, when I turn those off I lose all notifications. There isn't an ability to still show the new mail icon unless you have audio notifications!Overall, I love my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". I have had some frustrations so I'll share how I've fixed those below:* Web browser: GET THE DOLPHIN WEB BROWSER. Most people don't know this, but you can get a different web browser. You can also get plenty of other apps than what is available in the app store. Here's how: o Set your Kindle to allow installing unknown applications: Settings > Device > Allow Installation of Applications = On. o Install the One Mobile Market (independent market place). Amazon won't let me give a URL for this, so just Google \"1 Mobile Market\" or go to 1Market d o t com. This gives you the ability to install pretty much ANY Android application (with some functional limitations). o Once installing One Mobile Market launch it and search for the Dolphin Browser. This browser works great and is much faster than Silk. It has more options to control privacy and other features. The only negative is that you can't change the Kindle's default \"Web\" menu item to open Dolphin--you'll just need to add it to your Favorite's menu.* One you install the One Mobile Market and Dolphin also install: o Youtube. Must have. o OneNote (great notetaking product from Microsoft that allows you to sync notes to the cloud) o Anything else you want--just remember that anything that relies on Google's framework functionality won't work without rooting your device. Generally, if an app is already in Amazon's store, get it there so you ensure it works with the Kindle. o AirDroid: This is an amazing tool that allows you to access your Kindle from any web browser to copy files between your computer and Kindle--pictures, etc, and do other advanced tasks. o Flash: While in Dolphin, find a Flash APK file to download. I had a link here but Amazon removed it. Instead, just BING for \"flash_player_ics.apk\". Currently the top link at Bing is the file you need directly from Macromedia's servers.* In the Amazon App Store make sure you download these key must-haves: o Slacker Radio--Spotify and Pandora have better PR, but Slacker is better IMO. Radio + choose your own music, and if you pay $10 a month you can listen to anything you want, any time. o NetFlix o GSam Battery Monitor o MapQuest--It's surprisingly good. You can also download Google Maps from 1 Mobile Market, but it doesn't work great due to bugs running on the Kindle.UPDATE 12/3/12:Two additional items I realized I should mention:* I didn't mind the Fire didn't come with a charger. I bought this instead: PowerGen Dual Port USB 2.1A 10W AC Travel Wall Charger for Apple iPad 2, New iPad 3, Amazon Kindle, Kindle DX, Kindle Fire / Noble Nook Color / HTC Flyer / Samsung Galaxy Tab Series (USB Cable not included) - White. This has 2 USB ports and works at a high-enough amperage to charge the Fire quickly.* I bought the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Standing Leather Case, Ink Blue (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 8.9\"). I gave that 4 stars in my review there. It's really great as well but just a little overpriced.UPDATE 1/7/13:I still love my Fire, but wanted to write a quick update about Kindle FreeTime. The Kindle FreeTime function is great -- it helps kids have their own area on the device that is locked down to the items you let them have, so they don't accidentally start buying stuff on Amazon or send emails on your behalf.The key thing though is Kindle FreeTime \"Unlimited\". This is the monthly subscription service that gives your kids immediate access to hundreds of books, apps, and videos. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId;=1000863021). I used this for the 30 day trial for my two kids, and it is a huge benefit. My kids love my Kindle now because there is so much to do on it--and it's not just Angry Birds. They watch movies--even educational videos like Reading Rainbow, read books, and play apps that are educational. Last night I watched my 8 year old son help my 5 year old daughter play a learning game for 45 minutes--what is this animal, what sound does it make, etc. For $6.99 per month it's a huge value--worth every penny!", "Title": "Excellent Tablet with some Tweaks/get Dolphin Web Browser", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Author": "Book Fanatic", "ReviewID": "R3PGT8A3O26AWC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, people who give a product a 1 or 2 star review because of one issue don't get the point of reviews.  They should reflect the overall experience so people can get a fair idea of what they might be buying. Secondly many people are dinging this product because of a lack of flash.  Get over it people!  It's not Amazon's fault.  Adobe doesn't support flash on ANY new Android device.The Good:The display is outstanding.  I cannot see any pixelation in text and even the tiniest fonts are clear and sharp.  The HD video is outstanding.The reading experience on books is far superior to the original Fire with a much more pleasing to the eye experience.The size is perfect.  10 inch tablets are too big and 7 inch (including the original Fire) are too small.  I love this 8.9 inch device.I am not experiencing the slowness in browsing some are reporting.  I have an excellent connection on wifi and maybe that is why.  I would note however that I bought the original Kindle Fire and after a few updates to the firmware Amazon fixed many of the problems with browsing.  The speed on this device is far superior to the original fire and it does have a better wifi signal sitting side by side in my home.The bluetooth is a huge plus over the original Kindle.  I'm typing this with a bluetooth keyboard and I love it!  I have a quality logitech keyboard.  Don't cheap out on your keyboard.  I haven't tried a mouse.  I also have connected to external bluetooth speakers and it works great.  Love that sound!Everyone and their Grandmother is complaining about the fact you can't install non-Amazon apps.  OK, that is NOT true.  You can and I side-loaded multiple apps that work beautifully on this device and some that looked awful.  There are massive amounts of Android apps not available on the Amazon app store that work perfect if side-loaded.  Side-loading does NOT invalidate your warranty.  Just don't root it unless you know what you are doing.  Side-loading means changing your default setting to allow unknown apps to install (See Amazon allows this!).  Then get the apk file on your device and tap it.  The Kindle will install it.  You can do this in many ways, to me the easiest is to simply download them from dropbox or something like that.The Not So Good:If it wasn't for the hype the speakers on this device would be in the good.  I was extremely disappointed with the sound quality after Amazon's \"Booming Dolby\" hype.  As I've listened to it subsequently I like it better.  For a tablet it is actually quite good, but frankly listening to music or a movie on this thing can't even begin to compare to what you get even with fairly cheap external speakers.  The good thing is I can pipe it to speakers via bluetooth.  Don't get me wrong, the speakers are tablet good but do not live up to the advertisement.I have never liked Amazon's user interface.  I much prefer a native Android interface.  On my original Kindle Fire I installed GO Launcher but I've read it doesn't work on this device.  Apparently there are some that do and I assume more will as time passes.  Come on Amazon you can do better than this and STILL push people towards your content.  There is very little difference in the interface over the original fire.  Yes there are some improvements but they are incremental and the UI remains much the same.The build quality seems to be good overall but the power and volume buttons are very hard to feel and figure out which is up or down.  That's a mistake.  You get used to it but that is going to bother a lot of people.There is no charging light and that irked me because I like to walk by and see the green light on my original Fire and know it is charged.  With this one you have to hit the power button and unlock the screen.  A light would have cost more but it probably would be worth it.The app market on Amazon is limited even compared to the original Fire.  I assume that is because the apps aren't ready and that is not Amazon's fault.  For example I side-loaded an app I have on my original Fire that I got from the store that is not available on this one.  It looked horrible.  We have to wait for the developers to update apps.  This is to be expected and I don't blame Amazon, but you need to be aware of this.Summary:This is a darn good device.  The reason it is inexpensive compared to similar devices is because Amazon sells at cost and they left a few features out.  You get what you pay for but with this device you are getting more than you pay for because Amazon hopes to make money off of your content purchases, but you don't have to buy a thing.  People need to quit complaining about stupid stuff like chargers.  OMG, I have numerous charges that work with this device.  Pay 10 bucks if you want a fast one.It would be an even better buy if it had a rear-facing camera.  Well gee it would cost more too so I'm glad it doesn't.  Yes I would use it some but I can click a photo with my cell phone too.For the money this is great hardware and a good experience.  If you want a pure Android experience DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE AND THEN COMPLAIN.  Do a little research first.", "Title": "If You Really Want to Know the Truth", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Author": "Granddaddy", "ReviewID": "R3A1F4FY18DQ1S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Posted on 1/7/2013, this is an update to my comments about the Kindle's weight that I posted on 12/12/2012. I've now had my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" WiFi 32GB with Special Offers tablet for one month. My experiences might help others assess their \"need\" for this tablet.Many of the 1-star reviews of the KFHD8.9 remind me of the time some decades ago when a famous consumer reporting magazine gave a poor rating to America's favorite sports car because \"it still only seats two.\"When buying a product, I want to know what that product claims to be, what it really is, and whether any of it is of any use to me at all.In December I thought I might \"need\" a tablet device. This despite the fact that I've never used a smart phone and I hate laptop computers. I figured that poking a screen with a finger is crude at best when compared to the precision, flexibility, and speed of a touch typist using a keyboard/mouse combination. Giving up a multi-tasking windowed environment seemed like stepping backwards a few decades.I chose the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 32 GB WiFi with Special Offers based on Amazon's description and on user comments and reviews that persuaded me it could do the several media viewing tasks that I had in mind.My biggest surprise was that Amazon seems not to realize that a 32 GB tablet is far more than a media display device. It is in fact an information and entertainment system. As such it requires tools to manage large quantities of information stored in thousands of files. Not acting on this fact is the same mistake made by so many when hard disks first appeared and transformed desktop computers from simple data manipulation devices to systems that required management.Developing and refining management tools for the desktop has taken 30 years and is continuing. Hopefully Amazon will learn more quickly what it is selling. For now, the KFHD8.9 lacks the most basic organizational tools. Fortunately, independent software developers are working on apps that enable us to make the Kindle useful.Here are the 6 things I wanted to do with a tablet, along with a brief summary of how I made the KFHD8.9 useful for each task.SIX TASKS FOR MY KINDLE1.) Play home videos for my elderly mother so she can see her great granddaughters on her big screen TV.  This finally succeeded just yesterday when another Kindle owner recommended the free app BSPlayer Lite. I had produced some mp4 videos of dance and piano recitals from my AVCHD files. These mp4's played flawlessly on my desktop PC using several mp4 players. I then copied the files to my Kindle using the USB cable. I then connected the Kindle to my mother's TV using an HDMI cable.  The Kindle Personal Videos app and two other video player apps stumbled where the videos included crossfades between scenes or where there were scrolling credits over a still image. The sound continued but the progress of the video display halted for a few seconds and then jumped ahead. ES File Explorer crashed completely when I tried to use it's built-in player to open an mp4 file. I assume there is a bug in these apps or in the codecs included with the Kindle that will eventually be fixed. Meanwhile, BSPlayer Lite is the only app I've found that plays my mp4 files smoothly.2.) Streaming HiDef Netflix video to a big screen TV  This works well with no additional software. I previously used a Wii game machine (which is not HiDef) to stream Netflix. I connected my Kindle to the TV with a 15' HDMI cable that allows me to sit in my recliner with the Kindle and watch streaming video on my HiDef TV. This saved me the cost of buying some other network HiDef video streaming device.3.) Replace old iPod Nano 2nd generation for listening to podcasts.  I listen to podcasts several hours each week with my iPod always connected to one of my stereo systems. Using the Kindle for podcast listening almost didn't work in any useful way. The iPod is well integrated with iTunes self-organizing playlist system based on attributes of each mp3 file. In contrast, the Kindle has only rudimentary tools for organizing podcasts and music.  Fortunately, Amazon had a 99 cent offer that called my attention to iSyncr and the free Rocket Music Player. These can be synced to my iTunes playlists on my PC. I am now well on the way to making the Kindle into a useful podcast organizing and listening device. This saves me the cost of buying a new iPod or other mp3 player.  The rave reviews about the Kindle speakers imply to me that most small devices have really terrible speakers or that no one knows any more what high fidelity sound is meant to be. These tiny speakers have minimal usefulness, though they do beat listening through iPod earbuds.4.) Browsing the web when away from desktop  This works pretty well. The Silk browser has never crashed since I started using it. I have no more trouble with it than I do with Internet Explorer on my desktop PC. Silk is fine for casual surfing and quick lookups. It is utterly inadequate for serious research and writing. Especially it lacks a robust method of managing a lot of bookmarks or of keeping multiple tabs open for instantaneous switching among pages. (On my desktop PC I have some 2,500 bookmarks organized into 140 folders.) Clicking links with a finger can be trying on some web pages. A stylus was less helpful than I had expected. A severe fault is that you have no control over where Silk puts downloaded files. They all go to the Downloads folder and you need another app to find them and move them where you want them.5.) Reading books and technical papers in many formats, especially PDF  I have never liked reading books on my computer and I doubted I would like it on the Kindle. My opinion is slowly changing now that I have loaded dozens of PDF files and Mobi files (all free) from various web sites and from my public library. The free Adobe reader has basic markup capabilities, though it's far less capable than what I am accustomed to with FoxIt Reader on my PC. With the Kindle I can read longer documents in a comfortable chair instead of at my desktop.  A major deficiency is that bookseller Amazon provides almost no means for organizing books and documents. Fortunately, on my first day with the Kindle I found the free ES File Explorer that enables me to work with documents much as I do using Windows Explorer on my desktop PC.  Some publishers do not allow network transfer of library electronic books directly to the Kindle. The file must first be downloaded to your PC and then copied to the Kindle over a USB connection. Connecting a networked device through a USB cable seems slightly ridiculous. WiFi File Explorer Pro costs only 99 cents. It lets you copy files to and from the Kindle over WiFi.6.) Playing games  I am not a computer gamer, but I thought my granddaughters would enjoy playing games when they visit a few times each week. Having had to step up to their challenges, I am now addicted to several puzzle games, including Flow Free: Bridges, that can be played by 5-year-olds and by their granddaddy. I've also found that Bubbles is not so mindless as I first thought. It does require some strategy. With Go Free I'm recovering my old love of Go from several decades ago.OTHER CONSIDERATIONSGetting started  Had it running in a few minutes, partly because I had read a lot in advance. The Quick Start card packaged with the Kindle was not much use as it was glued into its slot in the top of the box.On/Off button  A truly terrible button. Some report the Kindle can be accidentally turned off when you brush the on/off button. In contrast, I find it very difficult to turn it on or off when I deliberately press the on/off button. Using a cover with the auto-on feature eliminates most of this annoyance.Weight  Some reviewers think the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is too heavy. With my kitchen/garden scale I determined that the KFHD8.9 with the Marware Revolve case weighs less than most hardbound books I own. Without the case it weighs less than many of my paperbound trade books, and it weighs less than my daughter's iPad. Weight is just not an issue.Weight details added 3/2/2013:Kindle Fire HD 8.9\": 19 oz. (Amazon says 20 on their specs, perhaps my scale is underweighing by 1 oz, doesn't matter)Marware Revolve Case: 13 oz.Combined weight of Kindle + Case: 32 oz.Hardbound books:Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows: 40 oz.Bennet's The Book of Virtues: 42 oz.Michener's Hawaii: 39 oz.Paperbound trade books:Mutual Funds for Dummies: 29 oz.Gleick's Chaos: 20 oz.Crockett's Victory Garden: 34 oz.Apple iPad (my daughter weighed hers on her electronic kitchen scale): 23 oz.iPad with cover + integral keyboard: 43 oz.Conclusion: Kindle with Revolve case weighs less than many hardbound books. Kindle alone weighs less than many trade paperbacks. Kindle alone weighs less than iPad. Kindle with case weighs much less than iPad with keyboard case.I'm finding the trick is learning how to hold the Kindle since it is denser and has a different leverage than a printed book. It all depends on what you want to do.Router  My old Netgear WNR2000 N300 router is perfectly adequate for streaming video. I did not have to upgrade to a dual-band router as some have claimed is necessary. CNet describes my router as a no-frills, budget, wireless-N router. I used the free Wifi Analyzer to measure signal strength and channel interference from neighbors houses. I was surprised how strong the signals were from some of my neighbors 50' to 150' away. I have been streaming HiDef video to a room 50' from the router without problems.Battery life  The Kindle runs all day for my purposes of reading, light web browsing, and video watching, along with games with my grandchildren.Charger  I paid attention to the advertising and decided to order the $10 charger. I don't have many portable devices so I don't have spare chargers lying around.Recharging Time (added 3/2/2013)Recharging time for the KFHD8.9 using the Kindle Power Fast charger depends on how low the charge is when you begin charging. Here's some recharging times I observed for overnight charging with WiFi turned off. I read the numbers from the excellent chart made by Battery HD:Starting from 9% charged:to 80% took 2-1/2 hoursto 90% took 3 hoursto 100% took 4 hoursStarting from 28% charged:to 80% took 2 hoursto 90% took 3 hoursto 100% took 3-1/2 hoursFrom 33% charged:to 80% took 1-3/4 hoursto 90% to 2 hours 10 minutesto 100 took 3 hoursFrom a low starting point to about 90% charge is almost a straight line charge. After that the charging rate slows as it approaches 100% charge.Protective cover  A case is an absolutely necessity for me. My one day out with the Kindle in the car (I only used it when I was parked) and at friends' homes was a bit terrifying.Carousel  This is almost useless with its huge icons and incredibly clunky appearance. It's not even a carousel as it does not wrap around. It is simply a linear icon array with no management capabilities except using a long tap to delete a particular item.File Transfer  Transferring files to a networked device over a USB connection is tedious. Amazon provides the Send to Kindle for PC software, but it has bizarre behavior, and I used it only once. The two PDF files I sent using Send to Kindle were first sent to Amazon after which they were sent by Amazon to my Kindle. Perversely, Amazon added nearly 3 dozen random alphabetic characters to the beginning of the filenames. Fortunately, WiFi File Explorer Pro is available for only 99 cents and it does a good job of moving files between your desktop PC and the Kindle without using a USB cable.Lack of significant free apps  The Kindle world has some good free games, but other free apps can be more annoying than useful to the point that they discourage me from upgrading to the supposedly more powerful paid versions. Compared to the Windows world, the Kindle world has a shortage of powerful and useful free apps. Perhaps this will change as the tablet market expands. I have mentioned in this review a few good free to low-priced apps that were vital in making the Kindle a useful device for me.Kindle is boring say some  Not for me. I've been thoroughly engrossed in the details of my Kindle for almost a month. I've had similar learning experiences with unfamiliar technologies over the 30 years I worked with mainframe, DOS, Windows, and Mac computers. It's never boring. (Then I just might be a geek, though a late adopter.)Locked into Amazon say some  Hardly. I've loaded my Kindle with home videos, home photos, and podcasts, and I've been browsing all over the web. I've downloaded books in various formats from a variety of web sites including my public library and Project Gutenberg. I do appreciate that it is very easy to access Amazon when I want to buy something (though I prefer using my desktop PC). You can easily ignore the Amazon tools, though I recommend checking the free app of the day every day. The free trial of Amazon Prime was a revelation to me. I've never paid Amazon shipping charges, having always used the free shipping option that causes slower delivery. With Prime I no longer have to accumulate $25 worth of orders to get free shipping. Even the least expensive items are now just two days away with free shipping. (Yeah, there's an annual membership charge. I'm betting I'll come out ahead.)Special Offers and Other Ads  These ads that appear on the opening splash screen are hardly noticeable, though some have displayed images that are mildly offensive. If some company wants to share sponsorship of my Kindle with other advertisers, good for them. People who walk around with advertising on their sweat shirts, shoes, and pants should hardly be complaining. I have not seen ads popping up randomly, though there are tiny ads in some of the ad-supported free games. Some free games do display full-screen ads. Turning off the WiFi has served to remove them during game play. With Special Offers on the opening splash page I've been surprised at the lack of variety. After the 20th display of the same car at startup I knew that advertisers don't realize that I only buy a car every 15 years or so. Perhaps the lack of variety means few advertisers are buying space on the Kindle.Flash doesn't work  An endless stream of Kindle detractors keep reporting this obvious fact. Adobe discontinued mobile Flash some months before the KFHD8.9 was released. Many imply that the iPad comes with Flash support, which it never did. Steve Jobs published his reasons for not allowing Flash on the iPad nearly 3 years ago. Some credit him for killing Flash, though Flash's many problems, not the least being security and the cookies you may not realize it puts on your device, would have killed it eventually. Not having Flash is less of a problem every day as HTML5 is replacing it (now with support from Adobe). Others have documented the workarounds for those who must have it.GOOD CHOICE AFTER USING ONE MONTH  So far I think the Kindle is proving to be the right choice for a portable device for my specific purposes. If I am still using it after 6 months I'll know I made the right choice.", "Title": "Why I bought a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" and how I made it useful", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Author": "B. Kerr", "ReviewID": "R160RO2SI5VF4N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Wow, I don't quite know where to start! This is probably the most \"mixed\" review I'm going to write.First off, I had no preconceptions if I was going to like this or not. This is my first tablet, so I have no pre-conceived notions on that front. In fact, I was quite determined to like the Kindle Fire HD, but after 2 weeks of one problem after another, my resolve is wearing down.Please note that this review will also largely revolve around several Kindle Fire HD specific customer service/tech support experiences. I realize that they are not the actual device, but they have a HUGE influence on your experience with the device when something comes up, so I feel that needs to be taken into account too.So, let's start at the beginning. My kindle arrived, and earlier than expected. It was great out of the box, until I tried to register it and it just wouldn't.It seemed straightforward enough, and I'm reasonably tech-savy, but it wouldn't work. Off to tech support. Longish story short, they couldn't register it either, and an hour and two supervisor tech guys later, they managed to register my kindle to my account. In order to do it, they had to create another kindle listing, but oh well. They got it done - great!Next, once I got into the kindle, now that I could use it, I noticed that it was showing the \"offers\" even though I had ordered and paid for without offers. Back to CS to have them turn it off. Should have been quick enough, but oh no.Because there were now 2 Kindle Fire HDs showing, there was confusion. Then because for some reason my order status hadn't updated and my Kindle was still showing as not even having shipped, she kept on telling me that this kindle can't be it, because it hadn't shipped. Again, long story short, I eventually convinced her that I did indeed have the Amazon Kindle in my hand and that it was indeed that order - she set it to no offers and we were good.I then spent a fair bit of time moving my files and stuff to the kindle, uploading and downloading from the cloud, inputting passwords, setting up apps, etc.All that went well and I have to say, I'm loving the screen and the sound on this Kindle. The speed is great too and once I figured out some of the inner workings, I got it nicely customized!That evening, in the middle of a movie, the kindle did a spontanous factory reset and erased everything back to square one! I have NO idea why - it just did.So, I put everything back on. I lost a couple of hours, but at least it was at the very beginning of things - nothing I couldn't put right back in. Ok.A couple more minor malfunctions came up in the following days, one of which led to yet another factory reset as \"the only solution.\"Since this is also a 4G device, I signed up for the AT&T; offer. All went well, I got the confirmations etc.By all rights, the thing should have just been working now, but I kept on getting an error message, saying the SIM card could not be located and to remove it and reinsert it.Since there was no easy way to do this, I called AT&T; customer service in the hopes that they would know what to do. They didn't. In fact, had very little documentation about the Kindle Fire HD 4G yet, and she couldn't even tell me how to remove the SIM card (it's not immediately obvious like it is on a phone btw)Anyway, at their recommendation back to Kindle tech support to find out where the SIM card was for sure and how to open the slot.I spent 20 minutes with somebody that kept on telling me that my device didn't have a SIM card! I kept on telling her that yes indeed it did, I even gave her the SIM card number that the kindle was displaying, and told her that all I needed to know where the card was located, so I could remove it and replace it as instructed, but all I got was repetitive copy and pastes from some manual she must have been consulting.After she finally got that I did have a SIM card, she kept on copying and pasting instructions on how I can purchase the data plan, which I had previously already given all the information of, as well as the information that I bought it, etc.It went on for a while, which led me to believe that she had NO idea what she was talking about, as everything was copy and paste and quite basic manual stuff and only vaguely related to my actual problem. And totally ignoring what I told her I had already tried.Then we did the reset dance again.Reset. Didn't help. Hard reset. Didn't help. And then she got to factory reset. Again.This time I had enough. She kept on saying it was the only way and I'm sorry but my trust in that wasn't that great. This is the person who insisted my Kindle didn't even have a SIM card and now she was insisting that I trust her in believing yet another reset was the only way.Again, long story short, I declined further help on yet another factory reset, as I just wanted to have some time for another solution.Anyway, hopefully this may help somebody else!Turns out that when the Kindle is connected to WIFI, it will say that the SIM card can't be found or may not be present. It gives the standard blurb about removing it, etc. That is a tad misleading. Basically, when it's connected to WIFI it feels no need to be \"seeing\" the SIM card. Once you get out of the WIFI range it sees the card and connects.That I didn't know that is maybe not surprising due to my inexperience, that the error message wording is misleading is unfortunate, but that Kindle Fire Tech Support didn't know that is just tragic. This could have been a one sentence tech support consult! There wasn't even a problem!I am so glad I didn't actually factory reset the kindle - again!So I'm sailing along quite nicely for a few days and I'm loving it! This tablet is really awesome by itself and when it works correctly, all I had hoped for and then some!I have now downloaded what I need for the most part, I have my work documents on it and ordered as I need them. I totally love Kindle Free Time!! There's no fighting about time limits, it says it's all done for today, the kids accept it and happily skip off to do other things! I don't have to worry about my son buying stuff because he can't get out of his area, nobody fights over who's turn it is - it's great!Until last night, when all of a sudden a grey square appeared in the carousel.It's a random grey square that is there instead of the icon for any given app or book. But it's not always the same app. It's truly random. So it's anybody's guess what it might be hiding.I went through the usual reset, hard reset and all that. I deleted the kindle library book that I had gotten last, thinking that maybe it messed things up. Did the resetting game again. The grey square remains. Since I haven't installed anything that wasn't from the kindle store and approved for my device, I'm not sure why it would do it.So back to Tech support I went.And yes,  you guessed it. After repeating all I had done already, the only answer they said they had was: Factory reset! It seems indeed a favorite of the support people. But it's all in the cloud he says, you can download everything again.Yeah, in a few hours! And that's not even counting having to input everything again (passwords etc)I can't keep on doing this!So, for now I'm living with an annoying grey square and having to find my books/apps by guessing, but I've had it with the factory reset and wasting hours putting everything back! It seems something always goes wrong with this device.Never enough to really render the device useless but enough for stuff not to run smoothly. And yes, it is entirely possible/likely that this came from some book or app and has nothing to do with the device, but since the Kindle is so tied in with Amazon and their apps and books, as well as their customer support, this is relevant to the whole package!What's worse, I have no real trust in Amazon tech support right now and don't know if they just say factory reset because it's a catch all and they don't have to deal with anything else, or if it really does require a factory reset! I have no way of telling if it's a big or a small issue!I would hope that on these more sophisticated devices with a large storage capacity, a factory reset is more of a last resort than the first solution to jump to!So in summary:- This tablet, when it works, is awesome!- Seems to have a fair amount of little issues that keep on popping up.- Amazon Customer/Tech support really needs to have a LOT more training on this to be effective with these new devices!- My experience surrounding my ownership of the new Kindle Fire HD 4G has been very mixed due to all the above!", "Title": "Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 64GB 4G - Very Mixed Experience", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Author": "missa lou", "ReviewID": "RFKB62ZQSG739", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" WiFi only yesterday and I am loving it.Pro's:-battery life is about 10 hours as is stated.-charging with the power adapter is fast and easy, the USB is great to power it off a computer if I need to.-The speaker system is so much better than it was on the first Kindle Fire, I don't need to use headphones or strain to hear at times.-HD quality is nice and the images are clear and sharp.-X Ray feature is great watching a movie and wanting to learn more.-It has a camera that works with some free apps-Free time will be great when my nieces and nephews come for a visit.-Ad's are built in to the opening screen, so they disappear when I swipe the Kindle Fire open.

I have an iPad and love it. However when I travel the iPad is a little larger then I want to carry on the plane. The kd fire hd 7 was just prefect. Then I thought about the hdmi out. I totally hate that apple makes you buy numerous hdmi adapters for iPod classic, and iPad and I just refuse to buy another one. The kd fire hd 7 again was beautiful. The hdmi out was outstanding, or at least I thought. It puts out a 720p. The kindle fire hd 8.9 puts out 1080p. I have a 60inch tv and it makes for a big difference. That fact sold me into buying the 8.9. I'm so glad I went to the 8.9, yes sold my 7 on amazon and took a $49 loss.  Just love the picture resolution. Books, magazines, tv/movies just look better. Don't think you can go wrong with this unless you're looking for a notebook. Great job amazon. Too, like most people I was surprised and extremely happy to get the kindle 8.9 prior to the Thanksgiving vacation trip.  One last note, the kindle deluxe is also a wonderful ereader for those looking for a larger screen, however, pretty costly but worth it. Update- about to get the otterbox. Not happy with the price but otterbox usually have the best covers period!  update- 1-17-13 I have had the opportunity to download videos and the standard video's look horrible on here while they look like High Def on the iPad.  this made me take away two stars. when I say iPad,I mean the 1st edition not the retina version.

Had thought about writing the entire review with this device, but the more I get into it, don't think that I can do it justice this way, so I'll just make my notes here as I go, then save them to the Amazon Cloud.Of the four different Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" models available at the time of this review, I picked the one that would best fit my personal needs. The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB was chosen based on prior experience with the first generation Kindle Fire, as I had found no problems whatsoever with Wi-Fi in my area, either in the home or within the establishments that I visit. Picked the model that includes special offers, as personally they don't bother me a bit.Breaking this down into sections, I'll offer a subjective overview of what's good and not so good, followed by more details.Likes:+ Excellent display; very easy on the eyes, good access to Amazon and to the `Net+ High resolution; 1920x1200 HD display, rich color from all viewing angles+ Strong Wi-Fi connectivity; dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi, fast downloads & video streaming+ Exceptional sound quality; offers true Dolby Surround Sound+ Long battery life; over 10 hours average, measured and confirmed+ No setup needed; ready to go and runs right out of the box+ Built-in micro HDMI port; allows for 1080P to be streamed to the TV+ Prime Instant Videos; unlimited, and so many from which to pick+ Excellent product feel; very solid and comfortable to the hand+ 16GB storage; about 12.7GB available to the user, more on the Cloud+ Good clean styling; minimalist, yet highly functionalDislikes:- No charging indicator light/LED as on 1st generation Kindle Fire- No charger; it could have been factored into the base priceFirst Impressions:Amazon isn't kidding when they offer fast delivery on the new Kindle Fire models. Mine was received within 36 hours from time of ordering, and the minimalist packaging is quite good, with the USB cable stowed in the box lid. Ordered it with the charger, though I already had one from earlier, and immediately charged it even though it comes partially charged. Setup is minimal, making it all so easy. Once it was fully charged, took it online and immediately installed the Battery HD Pro app and ran the full calibration routine as suggested, just as I had done last summer with the original Kindle Fire; this one is highly recommended.The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" came preloaded with content already purchased before. The Home screen offers a search bar at the top, with additional groupings below: Shop, Games, Apps, Books, Music, Videos, Newsstand, etc. Additional groupings will show up when it's held in landscape mode. Below these there's a carousel of recently viewed material, be it a book, app, web page, movie, etc.Exploring the new Kindle Fire HD for a few hours, it was apparent that this unit is no simple upgrade over the original. The larger 1920x1200 HD display is clearly sharper, compared to 1024 x 600 on my original 7-inch Kindle Fire, and the reduced screen glare is immediately apparent, probably due to its built-in polarizing filter. The colors were deeper and more intense, with darker blacks and even at varied viewing angles. The 1920\u00d71200 HD also helps make text crisp and sharp, and reading books and magazines is a pleasure.The real test came when I tried uploading some ultra-sharp high resolution JPG photos, and was quite pleased at how well they were rendered on the screen. The display on this Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is rated at a very dense 254 pixels per inch (ppi), making it excellent with the 300 & 600 ppi photos that I had uploaded. Tried a few HD videos as well, and the more vivid colors and deeper blacks were apparent, again even at different viewing angles, a step up from my original Kindle Fire.Hardware:The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" has a good look and feel. It's actually quite a minimalist device, and is easy to hold even without a case. Measuring slightly less than 9\u00bd x 6\u00bd inches and only 0.35 inch thick, it has beveled edges, which make it feel even thinner. Weighing in at 20 ounces, it has a solid feel, and the screen surface feels quite robust. Some sources have noted that the screen is made from Gorilla Glass, which may account for the solid feel, but that remains to be verified. The power button is a simple pushbutton, which is nearly flush with the device; no snags here.Wi-Fi Connectivity:As noted earlier, I chose the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" that is equipped with dual-band Wi-Fi connectivity because of earlier experiences with the original Kindle Fire. What I found with this new one was surprising. The product description claims that it offers \"over 40% faster speeds\" due to the dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi. Where I live there's plenty of connectivity, but it can dip or stutter now and then. This newer Kindle Fire HD is said to be able to switch automatically between the more congested 2.4 GHz and less congested 5 GHz Wi-Fi frequencies, and I've experienced a longer range and faster overall speed, so it works.Processor & Storage:I never had issues with the performance of the original, but this Kindle Fire HD really does perform faster.  It's probably the combination between its newer dual-core 1.5 GHz TI OMAP4 4470 processor and the improved Imagination SGX544 3D graphics core, but there's a noticeable difference, both in speed and graphics rendering. Videos are smoother and far snappier. As far as storage goes, I picked the 16 GB version as I do not accumulate as much as others. Most of the items stored here are books, magazines, photos, some videos and MP3 music files. The Amazon Cloud is where much of my content is kept, and after a book is read, it goes back there for storage so that it can be pulled when need. Keeps things simple and accessible over multiple devices.Web Browsing:The newest version of Amazon Silk works well on this device and offers faster page loads than previous versions. But one of the first things that I did was to switch the default search to Google. It's a personal thing, easy to do, and it allows me to search just as I would on my Windows PCs and on my MacBook Pro. It's fast, easy, familiar and far less hassle that way. Luckily this Kindle Fire HD makes it easy to do in the settings, and it just takes a few seconds of exploring to do it.There is Facebook integration as well, and you can import your photos from Facebook to your Amazon Cloud Drive and view them there, along with any other photos you may already have placed in your Cloud Drive. But a word of caution here: if importing your images directly from Facebook, you're cannot specify which photos you want to import; you'll end up importing them all. Just be aware of this before you start.Email & Address Book:Email setup was a breeze. I use Gmail as my primary, and it was set up and configured within seconds. Once that was setup, the Gmail address book was simple and smooth, and no problems encountered. The larger screen on this device makes it a breeze to access Gmail, read messages and to reply to them.Accessing Apps:There are a number of apps that I use from Amazon's Appstore for Android, and was most curious to see how these would function on the new device. There's a \"Compatibility with your devices\" checkbox in the upper right of each app, and if it's designed to function on the Kindle Fire HD, there's a green checkbox. Most of the apps that I use have to do with news, travel, photo imaging, word processing, music and utilities. There are a few that won't work on the new device, yet with all of the choices in the Appstore, have yet to find a number of apps to fit my needs. Many of them offer a test drive so that you can decide if it works for you.I'm the wrong one to comment on game performance, as there are very few that I've even tried. The few that I've installed to see what the experience was like seemed to perform well, but not being a gamer, my opinions would be almost worthless.In the Clouds:I've found the Amazon Cloud Drive to be invaluable for storage, and quite easy to use as my freebie backup for books, magazines and apps. But it can also be used to back up documents, photos, videos and other digital files. This review was initially stored on the Amazon Cloud when it was being written, and from there downloaded to my PC for final edits. There's a free desktop app that one can download for access and connection to the Amazon Cloud that makes life easy, and it works well.But my main cloud storage for general use on my PCs and MacBook Pro is the Google Drive, and I looked for an app to install it, but it didn't exist in the Amazon Appstore. There are workarounds, but I hate wasting time hacking apps and interfaces, so I dug deeper... and it was there, in my Gmail settings, along with my address book and the Google+ access. Simple, no hassles, and it works.Sound Quality:Didn't know how well the tiny stereo speakers would work on this version of the Kindle Fire HD would work, but it's said to offer Dolby Digital Plus, and that they were tuned to better reproduce low, bass notes, and without distortion. So I tested it using a particular track that I've used before: Strauss: Introduction to Also Sprach Zarathustra, also known as the Theme from 2001, A Space Odyssey. This particular pure digital (DDD) track has the full dynamics that can bring your speakers to their knees. Without getting too deep here, the opening ultra low notes could be heard, and the kittle drums were surprisingly clear.This also held up quite well with a couple more music tracks, some films and videos that I watched. Distortion is truly minimal, and there is a slightly different though quite good sound when headphones or external speakers are plugged in. Over it's quite better with stereo sound than anticipated.Bluetooth:Setting up Bluetooth was very easy. I paired it with the Plantronics Voyager Legend headset as an audio alternative and tested it with Skype for future use. No problems encountered, and the audio quality was quite good.Reading Books & Magazines:There's no doubt that the 1920x1200 HD display adds to the enjoyment of reading books and magazines, and the sharper text is very easy on the eyes, especially late at night when one is tired. With the X-Ray for Books feature, you can easily get more info about characters, locations, terms, and historical figures mentioned in a Kindle book, and it also highlights exactly where in the book those details are mentioned, allowing you the ability to jump right to the appropriate page. It also allows you to get biographies and more from Wikipedia and Shelfari.Gripes/Complaints:There's no such thing as a perfect product, and in that this Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" isn't alone. My older 1st generation Kindle Fire has a charging indicator LED built into the power button, and I was surprised to see the lack of the same on this newer product. Let's just call it an irritant. The other gripe is that there was no charger included as there was with the original Kindle Fire, and a decent charger is essential for this device. As of this writing you can get the Amazon Kindle PowerFast charger for about half price, but only if it's ordered at the same time as the Kindle Fire HD, so if you're considering one of these, be sure to order it at the same time.Accessories & Cases:Though the device offers a 10-point multi-touch interface, which is quite good and far superior to the earlier interface from the original Kindle Fire, I've reverted to old habits and use a amPen New Hybrid Stylus for most applications. This one is quite responsive on the screen, and for some of us it's a faster way of working.Also picked up the Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" based on past experience with a smaller one for the original Kindle Fire. This is a solid 4-star product, but the more costly Marware Revolve Portrait and Landscape Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", which is made from genuine leather lined with soft microfiber interior, may be a better and more functional choice for many. These are just two among the many to be found here; the choices are yours.Summary:The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GB is a solid product, easily worthy of a +4.5 star rating, considering the minor complaints that I've noted above. It has proven to be subjectively the perfect choice for my needs, though yours may vary, and the 4G versions may better suit your needs. The Wi-Fi performance has showed itself to be better than expected, the navigation is quicker than earlier versions, and the higher-resolution screen does a better job displaying menu options. To date I've had no crashed or lockups. It's currently largest tablet Amazon makes at the moment, and it gives you access to all of your Amazon content in high definition. As a multimedia device it has proven to be quite good, and considering how vast Amazon's content offerings are, especially if you're a Prime member, this is probably one of the best media consumption tablets on the market today, and certainly one of the most affordable in its class.12/23/2012", "Title": "Solid, First-Rate Performance, and an Excellent Value", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Author": "R. Angeloni \"slicktiger28\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZZ1BGWMISB7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the owner of a first generation Kindle Fire, I was looking forward to a new version of the Fire and preordered the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".  I have been using the device for close to a week and so far have been very pleased. This version of the Fire is a big step up over the first generation 7\" Fire, and with key improvements in screen resolution, Bluetooth, sound and even user interface.Screen ResolutionThe HD display is super sharp and vibrant, and this version of the Fire has a polarizing filter and anti-glare technology, to help improve readability at any angle and in direct light situations. E-ink technology (the technology used in the Kindle and other e-readers) will remain the ultimate when it comes to reading outdoors, but the screen resolution of the HD 8.9\" for reading is leaps and bounds better than the first generation Fire, and HD movies and television shows are super clear and vibrant.BluetoothBluetooth is important to me, as I have a number of Bluetooth speakers and like good sound for my movies and music. Setup takes a few seconds. The HD 8.9\" also has Dolby audio and dual stereo speakers if you do not have Bluetooth speakers. While not exactly booming, the sound these speakers produce is much deeper, clearer, and louder than the two speakers included in the first gen Fire.User InterfaceLike the first generation Fire, the HD 8.9\" has a customized Android operating system. For the new Fire, Amazon used Ice Cream Sandwich, Android 4.0. Set-up is extremely easy. The Fire arrives personalized and pre-registered, so as soon as you turn on the device, it immediately walks you through set-up, finds your router/WiFi, and downloads your books and apps.  The most time-consuming part of set-up was downloading the latest software. The user interface also includes a recommendation engine on the home screen, to find similar material. You can also turn this feature off. My device has offers on it, and I don't really find it obtrusive, as they only appear on the lock screen.  The user interface is very intuitive.  Web browsing is fast, and I like the \"Reading View\" feature, which removes unnecessary images or information on a Web site and lets you read or see what you want to see. I also like the \"Trending Now\" feature, which alerts you to Web sites that have a high amount of traffic. X-Ray technology also allows you to do a \"deeper dive\" and to find out more about actors, a scene in a movie or book, etc.SizeContrary to what they say, size is important, especially for tablets. The HD 8.9\" is light and thin, so I am able to hold it and use it with one hand. Swiping makes it easy to move from one page or Web site to another.Other Things to ConsiderIf you like or are connected to the Amazon ecosystem, and have Amazon Prime membership, then the HD 8.9\" is a perfectly designed media consumption device. With access to literally thousands of free movies, television shows, and even books, the Kindle works hard at keeping you easily connected to all of Amazon's content. Of course, if you want to buy something, the Kindle also works hard at making it easy for you to make purchases. The Amazon app store offers thousands of apps, but not as many as the Google Play store or iTunes.Also, text inputting is fine for e-mail or other simple Web applications, but until Amazon or some third party developers come out with a free-standing keyboard, I wouldn't attempt to write a doctoral dissertation or the Great American Novel on this device. E-mail set up for numerous accounts is easy, and this version of the Fire also integrates with Microsoft Outlook Exchange.Overall, I am very pleased with the Kindle HD 8.9\". If you don't mind the fact that the Kindle is totally tied to the Amazon ecosystem, it is a fun and easy-to-use personal entertainment device that is priced considerably less than the competition.", "Title": "A Big Improvement Over the First Generation Fire", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Author": "Xurumela", "ReviewID": "R3QU51NE3O98P8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Kindle Fire HD with the expectation it would be just a barebones tablet that I could carry anywhere and also eventually replace my notebook at home for day to day web surfing.  Heck, for 299 and a 8.9\" screen it was a no brainer to me.  I initially looked at the very same 7\" model and Nexus tablet, but the screen was just too small and it did not feel \"right\" on the hands.  Being the past owner of an iPad 2 that got destroyed by my kids I went back shopping for a replacement.  The iPad 3 was just too heavy and wayyy too expensive for the kind of use it will have.  Plus, add the kids to the picture, I was not planning on spending over 500 bucks on something that would end up rolling around the house and taking the risk of being destroyed...again...So I took the gamble and went with the 8.9\" HD.  And after only a few days, how surprised I am...Now, I was always a big fan of Amazon, customer service is something I'd pay for and when you get the best price and great customer service all I can tell you is you got my business forever.  With PRIME, this device is a full entertainment powerhouse, I have movies and games for the kids, music on the cloud, books for the wife, a great browser and an unexpected amazing screen.  Watching movies on it is just great, listening to music another big surprise: the speakers are just fantastic...I did not get into the 'dolby' thing, as I thought it would just not make a difference on a small device, but the sound in LOUD and clear.  As for the camera, I understand other reviews mentioning the lack of rear facing camera as a problem...but honestly, I had an iPad for 2 years and NEVER used the rear facing camera.  You simply will not...I do Skype and that is the only need for a camera in a tablet in my opinion (again, different users might disagree).  As for the charger (or lack of), I have at least 5 in my house (cell phones, iPad, iPod, etc, etc).  I just plug my cell phone one on it and done, not a big deal.  And if you are a PRIME subscriber, this device is a NO BRAINER.  Get one !  If not, it is still a great take-along carry-around-the-house gadget, very well built, slim and light.  Screen is very responsive, haven't seen any lag in the Amazon ecosystem Android wrap and the browser is faster than I remember my iPad being.  Maybe I am just overjoyed with the fact I spent so little with no great expectations and got this pleasant surprise.  I do have one complaint (so far): the power and volume buttons are hard to find and to a certain point frustrating...I saw that in the 7\" and was hoping it would be better in the larger form factor but it is still something that needs improvement (Amazon, are you listening ?).  About the ads...really ? I just skip them, so no problem for me.  They are not intrusive as you my think, not at all.

First is the web browser.  It crashed so much, I downloaded an other one (opera - and you'll have to allow non-amazon store apps in the Kindle settings to get any other browser - had to do that for dropbox and some other apps amazon doesn't like...).Email is a disaster.  After setting up about 10 accounts, they worked only for one day (sends but does not receive...).  This has been a known issue for several months but amazon has done nothing to address it.  Your only option is to get another app (K9 - free - is what I got).  There's no problem with \"canned\" email settings - but all mine were \"other providers\" (godaddy and other POP accounts including my business email!).Another issue is the battery life. You  must have to turn it off to conserve power as standby  still eats up the battery life (and this is with no automatic email downloads...).On the plus side, the integration with amazon cloud services (storage and music) is very good and was one of the reasons I gave up my iPad for a Kindle.  Just a note on opening docs - best to have a document app installed as the native doc viewer is really slow for some types.All in all, after spending way too long setting things up, I'm okay with it.

Akers", "ReviewID": "R2VVKZH7I129KA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I absolutely love my Kindle Fire HD. For $299, it is by far the best value tablet on the market, and the quality matches or EXCEEDS the apple iPads (we have an iPad 2 and 3) in many categories, which is a product costing nearly twice as much. The Fire HD is not perfect however, and has a lot of room for improvement, not so much in the great hardware, but in the software and OS.Key points:Screen quality - HANDS DOWN, the BEST screen on any tablet I have ever seen. The picture quality is just stunning, and the colors are extremely rich and vibrant. I can't speak well enough about the screen. 10/10Build Quality - It feels solid and the soft-touch back feels great in hand. Most cases simply take away from the beauty of the tablet. 10/10Sound - The Dolby speaker sound system was hyped up A LOT. While I agree that the speakers are great for a tablet, my iPhone 4s has the same depth, and is actually quite a bit louder than the Fire HD's speakers. That being said, they are still great speakers, and are plenty loud enough to fill a room. 8/10OS and CPU \"Speed\" - The OS is something that, if you are coming from an iPad or stock android UI, will not quite grasp at first. It's very snappy, and after playing with it for a few hours, I love come to really like it. You have one-tap access to your favorite apps, a top bar with one-tap access to every category of app/content you could need, and the Carousel serves as a app-switcher. It still isn't as smooth as iOS however. I would like more customization options, but that could be implemented later.  8/10Front facing camera - GREAT. Maybe not as \"HD\" as I would have hoped, but it is extremely responsive and has a very clear picture nonetheless. 10/10App Store - This is why I gave the Fire HD a 4/5. The Amazon app store, while growing, is missing A LOT of android apps that most people have come to expect. Notably, DropBox, Youtube, Astro File manager, Gmail, Chrome, and Google Maps. Games missing include Dead Trigger and Arcane Legends. However, the most disappointing part is that Amazon charges a higher price for their apps compared to the same app on iOS or android. There are numerous apps which are free on Android that cost $0.99 or more on Amazon. It's good, but not great. 7/10Thanks for reading. I would highly recommend the Kindle Fire HD to anyone!

I have been browsing through the 1 and 2 star reviews lately and found them to be false and misleading.  Contrary to popular belief, the Kindle Fire HD is not made up of cheap plastic and it is very sturdy and well-built.  Upon starting, it will lead you through multiple steps to set up your Kindle and it will take a few minutes of your time.  After set-up, I proceeded to turn on the WiFi and it worked very well.  I must note that it also depends on the router and connection.  If your WiFi has a problem, so will your Kindle Fire.  It isn't the tablet's fault.  I then realized that the Fire was low on battery and used my Kindle Keyboard adapter to charge.  It took only 4 hours to charge fully.  The absence of a charger isn't noticeable because of the fact you can even use your phone charger adapter to charge the Kindle.  It worked for me.During reviewing 1 star reviews, I noticed a lot of complaints about advertisements.  It isn't a big deal and you can simply swipe the lock screen with your finger or stylus and it will all be over in .5 seconds.  I even got a good deal out of one advertisement.  If you want to spend $15 bucks to disable the advertisements, that's fine but I'd use it for apps, games, or books you want to buy for your Kindle.  Recommendations?  They are especially helpful to have as they open more options for you to buy stuff you like.  I don't see the big deal about this.As for the limitation of apps in the app store stated by 1 star reviews, oh please.  If you are able to download 15,000 apps onto your tablet, then you can talk.  I found a lot of useful apps and games for the Kindle.I bought the Kindle Fire because of its functionality.  It is a great tablet.  You can read books, play games, skype (camera works great by the way), and shop directly from the app store as well as Amazon's site.  The web browser is great and I have no navigation problems like many 1 star reviews state.  The keyboard functions well and the email system is great.Really, it depends on what you're looking for.  For me, this is a great, cheap (expense-wise), and functional tablet.By the way, there IS an instruction manual on and for the Kindle Fire.  All you have to do is click on \"Help\" on settings.My only gripe is that the battery life goes pretty quickly.  I realize that if you turn off the WiFi and turn on automatic screen brightness, it can help.  Another reason may be that it is new and I am playing with it all the time.  As soon as the \"newness\" wears down and I am back to my regular usage then the battery life should last a while.  It lasts about 8 to 10 hours.I would recommend the Kindle Fire HDto anyone looking to buy a tablet.Have a great day!", "Title": "A-W-E-S-O-M-E", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Author": "Rave", "ReviewID": "R7T0Z56Y3GI4Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SOME BACKGROUND:----------------------------------------------------------------------Let me first start by saying that I am not a very pro-tablet person. I have at several times tried to join the craze and have always been disappointed by the limited functionality of tablets. I ended up returning iPad 3, Samsung galaxy note 10.1 and Asus vivo, all after about 2-3 weeks of use. The reason was pretty simple - lack of content (except iPad but more on that later). By the time I got the galaxy note 10.1 and used it for a week, I had given up any hopes of serious productivity from any tablet. I thought the stylus (s-pen) might help but I was wrong. It does make surfing a little more interesting and easier at times but there's isn't substantial difference to sway towards the note as opposed to any other tablet.Tablets are entertainment centric devices. You can read, watch videos, shop, listen to radio/podcast, but don't expect to edit a paper, write long emails or write code using a tablet. Of course, you can do all this but not efficiently. And yes, you can buy a Bluetooth keyboard, a mouse and all kinds of accessories but at that point you just have to ask yourself - why not just get a portable laptop? I am also a frequent traveller and already own a thin and light laptop so to justify buying a tablet, it had to offer something more. Then I saw kindle 8.9 had just launched and the specs seemed terrific for the price. I thought well, let's give this a try too. Again by this time, my expectation for tablets were as a media consumption device. I don't want to be able to change the background to 20 different types or run the absolute latest android version because that accomplishes nothing and I simply don't have time for such things anymore. Anyway, I decided to give kindle a try and here is my opinion.REVIEW STARTS HERE:------------------------------------------------------------------------SCREEN:This is most important feature of any tablet as 100% of your interaction with the tablet is through the screen. This doesn't mean you should always go for the best screen but a bad one can really get on your nerves pretty quickly. Things most people deal with on a daily basis are resolution, how reflective the screen is and finger marks. Kindle boasts an amazing resolution and both videos and text are very sharp. The screen seems to have slight yellow saturation but it actually seems to aid in reading and I think is easy on the eyes as far as text is concerned. For videos, it's like movie mode for many laptops/TVs. In terms of reflection, the Kindle's anti-glare screen is better than all the other tablets I have used. Although it's not 100% anti-glare, you can still see reflections. Finger prints can be left on the device but clear away easily, I can just wipe it with the side of my palm. All in all, one of the best screens I have used. I will give it 5/5.DESIGN/PORTABILITY/SIZE:Kindle Fire HD 8.9 has a sturdy, good looking design. The tablet doesn't have a plastic feel. It feels solid and has a good weight. The Asus vivo and galaxy note were both lighter than Fire HD but this feels like a better built/more expensive device. The thickness is on par with other tablets out there. There is noticeable bezel on the side but I think it's a good thing as that area is usually covered with my fingers when I'm holding the device. Most people would find this pretty easy to carry. It is slightly smaller than the iPad and also lighter. I don't need to zoom in to read most of the PDFs but I can just about comfortably read it (I don't wear glasses). Anything smaller and I think it wouldn't be so comfortable (if you are planning on getting a 7\" tab). For design I will again give it a 5/5BATTERY LIFE:I have never really measured but I have used it for 2-3 hours for 3 days and it still had some left. Battery life is rated at 9 hours and I think it comes close to that. However, I have noticed that on standby it drains battery sooner than other devices. Even after a full charge, if I don't/barely use it for 4-5 days, the battery is down to 10%. I will give the battery 4/5.CONTENT & SOFTWARE:This is the main reason I decided to keep this tablet. I already have Amazon prime and have some music and books that I purchased here. Also being an android based device, it is very easy to side load movies, music, PDFs and other documents. I got the 32GB WiFi version so that I could carry a few movies with me on flights. But so far I haven't needed to use those movies as this tablet supports Amazon VOD. This is also the ONLY tablet that supports Amazon VOD. If you are unfamiliar with Amazon prime, I seriously recommend you at least try it. Apart from free shipping on most items, you get access to tons of movies and TV shows (like Netflix) for $79 per year. I unsubscribed from Netflix which saves me about $8 per month and am thoroughly enjoying Amazon prime videos. This is where Kindle triumphed iPad for me. Yes, you can get movies for iPad and you can get Netflix but you will also end up spending more money. Add to that that Kindle is $200 cheaper than iPad and this seems like a no-brainer. Then there are books and Kindle lending library which allows you to borrow one book per month free (limited choices though). Content wise this is perhaps the best tablet out there for what it offers and at the price point it does. Android seems to lack behind iOS in content, especially for tablets, but Amazon more than makes up for it. Again, if you are willing to shed money you can get Netflix for any Android device, buy movies from Google play but you end up paying much more. That doesn't mean that Kindle doesn't have shortcomings. Some widely used apps like Youtube and Google music are missing from the Amazon app store. No big deal. You can still go to Youtube website from the built in browser but some other apps are still missing. Also, I have never found any android app that has the Podcast collection and ease of browsing that iTunes does. I am an avid podcast listener and the only thing that bugs me about using android is that even after all these years they haven't been able to find  a real substitute for iTunes. For phones, android seems to be almost on par with iOS in terms of apps now but for tablet, there is no comparison. To that note, I really recommend not buying a stock Android tablet. It would be like buying an expensive plate with no food to eat.Kindle also has something called free-time which lets you chose what your kids can view. I haven't used it and probably won't be using it for another 9 years.Overall, for contents, due to the lack of some widely used apps but keeping in mind that it offers full use of Amazon ecosystem, I give Kindle a 4/5.DOWNSIDES:Lack of some popular apps, lack of microSD card slot.I don't want to spend too much time talking about downsides as I think they are common for most tablets out there. Again, to me no tablet is perfect. A lot remains to be done before these can replace laptops or can be used as serious productivity devices. Windows tablet is hands down best for productivity but since I already own a windows laptop, it was hard for me to justify $300 more than Kindle to keep the vivo RT tab.Overall, my rating for Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is 4/5.I hope this review helped you in deciding whether a Kindle is right for you.EDIT: I initially wrote that Netflix app is not available on Fire but it is.

After powering it on, the unit will ask for a WiFi connection, then download and install a software update, which takes a few minutes.  It asks for access to twitter and facebook, which you can skip if you want.  It suggests connecting to a power source during the update (just in case the battery is low), so you should have a micro-USB power source available just in case.The screen is amazing... very \"Retina\" like with pixels too small to see.  The reading application has been updated to include much smaller text sizes, and they are quite easy to read.The unit is very responsive, scrolls icons quickly.  And the picture viewer is very fast and even makes nice arrangements of your uploaded pictures.Videos start playing very quickly.  Quality is outstanding, as is the sound. The sound is true stereo, clear and can be loud.  Much louder than the sound I have heard from an iPad, old Kindle 7 inch or Nexus 7.You can easily turn off the bottom of the screen recommendations via the swipe down, More, Applications, Amazon Home Recommendations.Video playback is fast.  The MIMO technology really seems to help web browsing and video playback. A quick visit to bandwidthplace.com showed the unit was downloading at the maximum speed of my internet connect (18 Mbps).  I am sure it would go faster though if I had a faster internet connection.  I saw no disconnects over the last few hours I have played with it.There are some slight pauses in the software at times, especially noticeable when starting the Silk web browser.

Geoffroy", "ReviewID": "R171O0FVEUKC8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can you afford an Aston Martin? If so and you're in the market for a tablet and require the ultimate in beauty, sophistication and over-engineered build quality then head over to your Apple store and pick up the new iPad.OK, so I'm taking an odd angle with this review (and it is of course just my opinion) but hear me out. So I can't afford an Aston Martin but I can afford and do own an iPad. It's lovely in design, build quality and functionality. There's almost nothing it doesn't do well and even after two years is still beautiful to behold. In the same vein that not everyone can afford or wants to spend the money an Aston Martin, the same holds true for the iPad. That's where the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 comes in and in my opinion it's the Toyota Camry of tablets.ComfortStrapping myself into the new Kindle it felt a little less refined at first but actually quite comfortable to hold in my hands. Much like the Camry is likely more comfortable on a long trip as compared to an Aston (I haven't confirmed this personally) the Kindle feels lighter than my iPad and smoother around the edges and it's easier to hold for long periods of time. It's built well but not over-engineered like the iPad. I personally love an over-engineered product but for most it's an unnecessary luxury.Exterior AppearanceNo comparison here, the iPad/Aston looks better and sleeker from every angle but when it isn't parked next to the iPad the Camry/Kindle ain't bad to look at in its own right.SwitchgearAgain, no comparison. The iPad's external buttons are well placed and feel nice to operate. The Kindle's are adequate and do the job as designed but are nothing special.PerformanceHere's where things get interesting. This Camry of tablets has an ace up it's sleeve, almost as if some insane person at TRD (Toyota Racing Division) got hold of it and bolted on a supercharger while also fitting it with nitrous. When it comes to watching video, listening to music, reading books, using apps and web browsing the Kindle is on par and in some cases better performing than the iPad.Web browsingiPad is better and smoother to react to user input via the touch screen but the Kindle is almost as good and very much improved over the original 7\" Kindle Fire.AppsNo doubt about it, the Camry is a much cheaper to run compared to the Aston. One of the big advantages over Apple as it comes to apps, Amazon gives one away for free in it's App Store everyday and on some apps lets you try them for a period of time under the aptly named \"Test Drive\". They aren't just cheap apps no one wants or \"scam apps\" that give you little content and expect you to spend extra $ on \"in app\" purchases. This is great if you have kids or like to play games on your tablet as many of the free apps are games and they are usually quite entertaining.Video/ScreenMuch like the Camry might have a better nav system than the Aston, the Kindle is an awesome device for streaming video, especially through Amazon Video on Demand. A big bonus is that if you're a \"Prime\" member there's a decent amount of TV shows and movies that you can stream for free. I was one of the early Prime members who loved it just for the free two-day shipping, so the streaming video was like icing on the cake. Netflix is here as well and is great. I see apps for Hulu and some others but haven't tried them. Between Netflix and Amazon VOD your video needs will be well covered IMO. The screen is sharp, bright and the interface is quite engaging and attractive to look at.Music/SoundThis Camry has had some serious upgrades at the local car audio store. The sound is spectacular, rich and loud. Flat out blows away the iPad and any other portable device I have ever used. I now officially favor Amazon's MP3 store over iTunes and buy all my music from it. The songs are stored free on the cloud and easily import into iTunes as an MP3 file so I can add them to my iPod and iPhone as needed.Magazines/NewsstandOn par with the iPad and a thousand times better than the old 7\" Kindle (which was horrible for magazines due to its screen size). I find the Amazon magazine store much easier to use than Apple's.BooksAmazon's the king here, both in shopping for books and in reading them on the device.4G and Skype/Video Chat - Haven't tried these options yet.If the difference of a few hundred dollars isn't important and the need to have a sexy looking tablet is then check out the iPad. As I can imagine if you owned an Aston for some time but could no longer afford it, it would likely dampen and otherwise dull your driving experience in a Camry. In that respect in some ways I wish I could go back in time and never even have purchased the iPad. If I could and the Kindle was the only tablet I had ever used I would think it the most brilliant device ever invented. But personally I am a sucker for a stunning exterior design and \"teutonic-like\" build quality and in many respects have to give the iPad the advantage over the Kindle.However a good lot of us can't afford the iPad or simply don't want to spend the extra $ and for those folks the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is a brilliant companion packed with value. This holds true both in terms of the purchase price of the device and the \"extras\" Amazon gives you in terms of free apps and video streaming (if you're a Prime member). Oh, and don't let the \"special offers\" version of the tablet scare you off. I have no idea why this bothers people, all it involves is when you put the Kindle in \"sleep\" mode an ad appears on the screen. There's no annoying pop-ups or anything like what you would experience browsing the web on a computer, it's simply an ad that appears when the device is locked or woken-up. In fact it's just like driving by a billboard in your Camry, sometimes it might catch your eye and you'll take notice but in most instances you'll just look away and keep driving. :)", "Title": "The 2013 Toyota Camry of Tablets", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Author": "Jraptor", "ReviewID": "R3AOJZJSVM5AQM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my last edit of this review. I put the current event at the top of this review, Jan 20th, 2013. Read the entries below the first one, if you wish, for more information.I am returning my Kindle 8.9 Fire. I do not really want to, because I wanted this device to work, but it is just too terribly flawed not to return. My first 8.9 had broken speakers. Amazon kindly replaced it, but the replacement was even worse. If you use the browser and try to access more than 3 sites in a row, it hard crashes and restarts. It is extremely slow..the videos tear and stutter (not just internet activities, it does it on the fully downloaded movies and books too). It randomly shuts off and restarts itself. Maybe it is because I bought the expensive one and it exceeds the $299 design, but I have lost my faith in the device. I have used it for about 2 weeks, trying to make it work, and it finally became so frustrating that I asked for a refund. I am very sad about this. I have 3 other kindles including two of the first gen Fires and I loved them. Something has changed in Amazons business strategy or another factor, I think, with this device. It simply does not measure up to the previous versions of the Kindles.++ The 8.9 has some small annoyances, such as no on/charger light, hard to find recessed buttons, and the charger input being on the longer side of the display, so plugging it in and watching a movie is impossible. One week into ownership, the speakers on one side of my kindle stopped working. I tried a factory reset, and tested different media, all to no effect. I was going to ask for a refund, but the Amazon people were so nice to me I decided to get a replacement instead. They are getting it to me quickly and at no extra charge. I will continue to document on this device and let you know the results. I have gotten such excellent service and my other Kindles are great and I am still satisfied if the replacement takes care of the problem. I am sure out of the thousands of reviews, this will be the important one! :)  (JK)+++The new device is working well. I bought the expensive one, with 64mb storage and WiFi. I think it may have been a mistake. Apple designs their pad to be a expensive device. Kindle is designed to be a cheap device. When you add allot of things into something designed to be the low end, it increases the likely hood something will go wrong.++++The 4G provider, AT&T;, is the anti-christ of companies. I really hate that amazon has a business deal with them, and that their demonic logo appears on the kindle. If you aren't familiar with AT&T;, check out their history.

My older Kindle DX has 3G service, and had NO Wi-Fi capability.  The new Kindle Fire HD depends on and requires Wi-Fi usage alongside 4G.

Not newspapers or blogs!And the $49 offer for AT&T; 4G service advertised, depends upon which of the two billing arrangements you make on Kindle setup.  AT&T; is going to bill me $216/year instead, and it is NOT clearly indicated before you make the choice.Even worse, the AT&T; 4G service is of limited function. !!!  This afternoon I found out that in order to watch a movie, or even download a magazine,  I had to reconnect my \"Wi Fi\" connection, and use that instead of the AT&T; 4G.  So I do not understand what the premium of the 4G service is good for.After reconnecting the Wi Fi, the one movie I tried to watch kept stopping. Why? Because my Wi Fi connection is not strong, and the Kindle was \"hunting for Wi-Fi signal\" which was the purpose I intended in paying more for the 4G service!.Speaking of blogs . . .THERE ARE NO BLOGS!  I subscribe to The Huffington Post and New York Times Latest News \"blogs\",  which provide updates throughout the day.  The Kindle Fire HD does not support these.The other major complaint I have is about the TTS \"Text to Speech\" feature.  Amazon and other forum reps represented that the TTS feature would be installed on the Fire HD models, subject to publisher support, but that is NOT completely true.  The TTS feature was an important function to me, as I have used my older Kindle DX model. On the Kindle DX, the TTS works with most books, AND with newspaper/blog downloads as well.  I have discovered that with the Fire HD TTS does NOT work with any newspaper/blogs --- only with books.  So not a publisher decision.  A design difference.Why was that important to me as a loyal Kindle customer??  Because like many,  I have a long commute,  and I was using the Kindle DX with TTS to read me the headlines and in depth stories from the New York Times, or Washington Post,  or other periodicals,  during my commute.  Along with the books.  The loss of the TTS feature on periodicals was NOT disclosed in the advertising on the Kindle Fire.  For those of us that used TTS on prior models,  reading that the new model supported TTS as well,  it certainly implied that the feature was not being diminished ---- ie by the loss of all newspaper and blog support.  Indeed,  that is why I bought the 4G version,  because that was a great feature of my 3G equipped Kindle DX.Back to my Kindle DX.  Who needs to see fancy book covers in color instead?  They have the right to change features.  But the loss of functionality is a big step back and NOT YET PROPERLY DISCLOSED.", "Title": "The 4G model depends on Wi-Fi to stream movies!

I called Amazon and they are sending me out a replacement right away. If the replacement doesn't have any issues, I will keep the 5 stars and assume i got one with a glitch. It happens. If there are still issues, then it will be an overall problem and my ratings will drop. There was a person on the forum page that also had this problem. Most others are reporting no issues with the battery. So for now, I will gave Amazon the benefit of the doubt.I have only had this for a day so I have not explored everything. This is my first tablet so I have little to compare it to, but I have a Kindle e-reader which I love. I found this to be pretty user friendly considering I don't even have a smartphone so apps and touchscreens are new to me. I found the user's guide to me helpful as well as the Kindle forum to answer questions I didn't feel like looking for answers to. I had no problem uploading my favorite sites. Some said they couldn't watch movies but I have been able to with both Netflix and Amazon on demand.Also, I guess there were some issues with the sound in the first generation Fire. I didn't have any problems, I didn't even need to use full volume when watching shows.I downloaded a few free apps to play around with. And of course my books. I like that I can download some to the Fire but if there is one I want to read that I already own, I can download it from kindle Cloud. I can read books without downloading them via the Cloud but that means keeping the wireless on. Same with music.I'm not to great with touchscreens and I loathe fingerprints so I prefer to use the stylus that I got separately. I didn't get a charger (it comes with USB cord only but charging through the computer won't really work), the one for my Kindle fits but doesn't charge as fast. So I ended up ordering the fast charger as the Fire isn't meant to last as many hours as the Kindle e-reader. But I still think the battery life is pretty good.I like reading on this, I thought the back-light would bother me, but I can adjust the brightness. I actually prefer reading in the portrait mode as it shows two pages and looks like a book page would.So far I am very happy with this, my third Kindle device.

Prior to this, I use Kindle apps on my other three tablets, a Viewsonic gTablet (10\" screen), a Lenovo A1 (7\" screen), and a Nexus 7 (7\" screen), and my cell phone, a Samsung Galaxy S3, and Roku for the movie streaming.  Since I am a Prime user, getting a Kindle device should provide an even better user experience for Prime Instant Videos, and I am not disappointed.  All Amazon contents displayed very well with this device, especially HD movies.  The sound is amazing but does appear less direct as the speakers are facing backward.  A few times, I found my hands holding the device were covering the speaker ports and muting the sound but I realized that immediately and changed my holding position.  All Amazon contents are well integrated with the Fire HD so I do not need to start an app for book reading and another app to watch movies.  Just click on the content, which lives on a carousel at the home screen, and the Fire HD will start the appropriate app.  The Fire HD supports the 5 GHz band of 802.11n and works with hidden SSID and MAC address access control.  My connection speed is at 130Mbps when connected to a Netgear router.  During the playback of a HD movie, however, my video player abruptly ended three times with network connection errors, even though the network connection icon was still showing on the notification bar.  Only a shut-down and a restart would fix the interruptions.  Except for that movie, I did not experience any interruptions when I watched two more movies in HD.  The viewing experience was excellent and the best among all my portable devices.  The resolution of the screen is just amazing.  I did see some backlight breeding from the top left corner of the screen when held in landscape mode, as I was turning on the device.  I have yet to contact Amazon to see if this is considered a defect.  Other feature that I did not test but intend to is to borrow a book.Overall, I give this unit four stars.  I took half a star off because of the lack of apps.  Since Fire HD requires the use of the Amazon app store, it is not as comprehensive as the Google Play store.  Not all Android apps will work.  In particular, most Google apps will not.  I have always used Google Currents to provide news feeds on my other Android devices but when I side-loaded Google Currents, the app would not start.  The best way to test side-loading apps is to load TapPouch Lite on the Fire HD if you have another Android device.  Then you can use TapPouch Lite on the other Android device to share the apps.  I used TapPouch Lite to share Mobo player and MyBackup Pro.  Interestingly, I purchased MyBackup Pro from the Amazon app store, but somehow it was deemed not compatible with the Fire HD 8.9.  It actually works, albeit some part of the app displays with a smaller screen.I took another half star off because the default input method cannot be changed or supplemented.  The default keyboard misses key presses from time to time and it is not very smart in making predictions.  Unlike other Android devices, however, the input method on Fire HD is deeply integrated and I cannot install other input method editors (IME) such as Chinese or other keyboards such as Swiftkey.  Immediately this limited the use of Kindle HD for someone like me who uses more than the default languages that the tablet will support.  I will not be able to input in another language such as Chinese to search or communicate through email.In summary, it is an awesome device for viewing Amazon contents.  It falls a little short as an all-purpose tablet and I hope Amazon will be able to remedy some of its shortcomings through future updates.Update (11/29/2012)I contacted Amazon customer service regarding the backlight breeding from one of the corners of the tablet and Amazon shipped me a brand new replacement, which I received two days ago.  I am happy to report that the new tablet is perfect without the backlight bleeding issue.  In addition, I found that it stayed connected to my 802.11n access point throughout an entire movie, something that my original tablet struggled to do and had been disconnecting multiple times during movie playing.  Way to go, Amazon.  This is really excellent customer service and the replacement process was absolutely painless.", "Title": "Fire HD 8.9 32GB: An awesome device for viewing Amazon contents", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Author": "Travel mavn \"luvsbooks\"", "ReviewID": "RVCLLHF6QGXFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a couple of days to work with the kindle fire and I have to say I'm delighted. Maybe reading all the reviews lowered all my expectations but I absolutely love it. I realize some may have real mechanical issues but mine has worked flawlessly.I have a smart phone so was already familiar with using the touch screen, which at least on my Fire is very responsive (as much as my 4g phone is or better; especially with internet pages).I tend to obsessively read reviews on Amazon and googled using the Kindle fire review search term so no surprises about no charger (which I had already bought discounted when I bought the fire, and I thought they made fairly clear that it was not included) and I did cave and buy the seriously overpriced cover. I don't hate the cover but definitely not a $55 dollar item; works as described and looks ok and it saved me any issues with the on and off button people seem to be having since the open/on shut/off works great. I had also purchased a stylus that is great; only thing I need to figure out is how to find a way to keep the stylus attached to the case so I don't keep misplacing it.I also did search around and borrowed the Kindle fire users guide by Shelby Johnson which saved me alot of the frustration I have been hearing in the reviews. I would never have figured out how to get Google Chrome working and picked up a few of the recommended app's which I love (HD battery one especially nice as far as splitting out how much time available depending on what you are using the tablet for ie internet search, movie etc)and knew basically how to navigate; although I thought it was fairly simple as far as the carousel/top terms that take me to the different areas (video/apps/music) I rather like the whole setup actually and like the look so setting my own backdrop isn't important to me and I actually don't find the ad's intrusive.So, my basic needs for the tablet were for magazines as I was getting tired of bulky paper, movies downloaded so when I travel I can watch without lugging out the laptop or needing wireless, netflix and Hulu plus along with Amazon prime are my standard television watching even at home (no cable) so wanted to be sure these worked well and internet - usually I just use for searches, facebook.I bought the 32gb since I knew I was going to have movies downloaded.  So far internet working great, there are alot of tabs but nothing too annoying and still getting a feel for searches but no problems.Movies- bought and downloaded off amazon prime effortlessly using the black friday deals to pick up some I don't own yet; I'll try the downloading of some I own when I have more time.My music (limited amount on Amazon cloud since most on itunes; we'll have to see about transferring some of those) downloaded easily so I have music at any time and the sound is great.Netflix and Hulu plus (apps) worked great and seem pretty seamless; I do have high speed at home since I work online and my primary television is all streaming so that may effect them but they work as well on tablet as TV.Downloaded a couple of simple games since it isn't something I do alot of and they run fast and look beautiful (star wars angry birds, temple, Mah Jongg they look fantastic.Magazines I am very pleased with. I decided to try Oprah, More, Smithsonian and Natl Geographic and they all are working perfectly.  Still need to play with them to decide which I need to keep but they turn like a magazine using swipe then with a double tap expand to read in text, another tap and back to small so pictures and ad's can be viewed like thumbing through a magazine.  Nat'l geographic links directly to video's which is fun.  So far still only a basic use of them but no glitches so far.I didn't try the facebook app after reading reviews but it pulls up perfectly on the internet. The only thing to play with is to try again to download dolphin and flash (the kindle book does give links to do this but it was the only one I couldn't pull up immediately; or at least I don't think they downloaded)So still a learning curve but in the two days I've had the fire I've loved it. I was afraid since I had a 4g phone it would be a waste but the size is perfect for magazines and movies (a bit too heavy to use as a daily reading device, so keeping the paperwhite also for nighttime reading) but it is something I will definitely use every day.It would be perfect if I could download the pictures off my camera on vacation and manipulate directly. I wouldn't even bring the laptop in that case, I think that is the only thing for my basic needs that requires anything above the Kindle Fire.May have received a lucky Kindle with no mechanical issues but loving it. Looks like it will be worth every penny.  I do use Ipod and alot of my music is on that but I am heavily into kindle books and amazon content so this tablet works great for me; glad I got it and not a ipad. I also realize I have already been trained by my previous devices so the learning curve wasn't too great as far as navigating touch screen.

Very straightforward process of just turning it on and letting the tablet register and update itself. It took about 10 minutes (with the majority of the time waiting for an update to download) and it was ready to go. It picked up all my original Fire music and books from the cloud and most of my Fire apps. I was disappointed to see that a couple of my favorite apps (TED Talks and Play Music Videos Free) were judged not compatible with my new Fire. Hopefully updates will be coming soon.The screen is delightful! Crisp and clear, and a marked increase in resolution versus the original Fire. Videos on the HD Fire are simply amazing.The sound quality is also a marked improvement. While it was pretty much mandatory to hook up an external speaker for the original Fire, the new Fire puts out pretty decent sound quality all on its own. I still hook it up to external speakers (I'm partial to the Bose Companion 20) for movies and music when I'm at my desk, but it puts out more than adequate sound all on its own.Response time is more snappy than the original Fire, and the carousel is easier to navigate (smoother scrolling). Picking up a WiFi signal seems to be better with the new fire - I'm getting all signal strength bars displayed in areas of the house where I could only get 2 or 3 bars with the original Fire.The form factor is great for video watching. The extra screen size makes a big difference. The other huge advantage to the size is typing. It's MUCH easier to see and use the onscreen keyboard than on the original Fire. I had no problems typing without a stylus; on the original Fire a stylus is a must.So far I don't see many misses other than a hard-to-find power button. The casing and build quality is not at the same level as an iPad, but neither is the price. I'm very pleased with the price-performance level of the HD Fire.This is not replacing my original Fire - I'll continue to use that for most of my book reading and when I need portability. For everything else, the larger screen is well worth the additional cost.I have a Nexus 7, the iPad 2 and an HP Touchpad and the Fire is my favorite by far. Not because either the original or this new Fire are the best in terms of build quality or speed or tech specs, but for one simple reason: the Fire makes it so incredibly easy to avail myself of entertainment and content. The tight link to the Amazon ecosystem is, for me, a huge plus - it keeps my entertainment pipeline full of things I want to read, listen to or watch with little or no effort on my part. And, best of all, a lot of that content is free through Prime.Love it, and highly recommend.", "Title": "A real big fork for the content buffet!", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Author": "Frances M. Tuttle", "ReviewID": "RGMITUGKKF7SY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I don't understand reviews/reviewers who waste time criticizing what isn't there - what is the point of that?  Read the product specifications and you won't be disappointed.  It is no secret that the Fires were created for the Amazon eco-system.Second, Amazon has always said that the Kindle Fires were all about consumption of Amazon products - in fact, that's why I bought the original Kindle e-reader, Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD 7\" (which I only used for a month and half before I knew I would want an 8.9) and now Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" - I am a mass consumer of Kindle books and now videos with my Amazon Prime membership.Third, my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" is not an iPad replacement - nor was it created to be one.  I watch videos, play games (and yes, there are a few games that do not play on the HD 8.9 - but that happens with computers - get over it)and read books and magazines - that's what it was created for.  My magazines are incredible on the 8.9 - a great leap over the 7.  Stop comparing it to an iPad, please! And I hate to break it to you iPad fans out there - but you do realize that an iPad is in no way a laptop replacement, don't you?  Don't try to compare apples to oranges.  And no, the camera was not meant to take pictures - isn't it meant to be a Skype thing?Fourth, shut the wifi off when you are not using it - it helps with the battery life.  I have to charge my iPhone (yes, I have an iPhone) at least once a day because I use it so much, so having to recharge my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is no big deal for me - it comes with the territory.  My original Kindle e-reader did, indeed, last for weeks on one charge, but it wasn't a computer being used for many things - so if anyone buys a tablet with the expectation of long battery life, you are, indeed, going to be disappointed.Fifth, for the money I think the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is an excellent product.  The display is gorgeous, the sound is excellent with the new external speakers (on my original Fire I had to download an app to pump up the volume because I could hardly hear it without headphones) and the wifi connection is much quicker than on previous versions.  The Silk browser - well I find most tablet browsers to be kind of sucky compared to my laptop - so that is a non-issue for me.In summary, if you are looking for a device to watch videos (both Amazon Prime and Netflix in my case), read your Kindle books (and no, you won't be able to read your books on a bright, sunny day on this device - but I would hope you would realize that before you buy), read mazagines and play games, this is a device for you.  Would it be nice if it came with a charger?  Sure, and maybe Amazon will begin to include them in future versions, but for now, this is exactly the device I wanted and it is exactly what I expected.P.S.  I have originall purchased one of the really expensive cases to use with my 8.9, but I returned it and ordered a Fintie slim-fit case and find it to be absolutely perfect.Enjoy your 8.9 - I know I am!", "Title": "LOVE IT ... KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9 DOES EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Author": "Bill Hansen \"Bill Hansen\"", "ReviewID": "R3D1B174FE06SK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was originally written for another forum, in response to a person who worried that the Kindle would be too difficult to use, and too strictly limited to the Kindle environment. As a much older person and a technophobe, I worried about those things too - but the Kindle Fire and its siblings are far easier to use, for more powerful and flexible, than I had imagined. Users are not limited to Amazon content at all.In the 36 hours I've had my 8.9 I've subscribed to the National Geographic magazine (gorgeous!!), read the New York Times in a format which looks indentical to the one I'd buy at a newstand, watched a few short instructional videos, read a short e-book, checked our local weather using the very detailed Weather Channel app which comes with the Kindle, perused the CNN news site, checked my Gmail account several times and have written a few emails on the Kindle, discovered that my Google Calendar and all my Gmail contacts were automatically downloaded to the Kindle, purchased several small items - you get the idea. I could have bought movies, shopped for trousers, cameras, sticky buns, software (almost any sort of software)...... You get the idea. I'm a very non-technical person, 78 years old*, using my very first tablet for just 36 hours. I didn't sweat one drop doing all that. The Kindle is set up so beautifully that it almost does it all for you.Sideloading (this was a question someone had asked) - That's a process whereby a Kindle user can download apps which the Kindle app store doesn't offer. It involves getting the \"apk file\" for the app (similar to the \".exe\" file for any other computer application) from a site which lists them, saving the apk file to the computer, moving it to the Kindle, and installing it. You do have to have another Android device available, one time only, to begin the process - so if you don't have an Android cell phone, for example, borrow one for an hour or so, from a friend or acquaintance (or ask locally on Craigslist, your health club or church, etc).Yes, there are several steps involved in sideloading. But you can't possibly damage your Kindle, and you don't void your warranty. I've had a an android cell phone for over two years, and there are a few things - a little thing called Weather Bug, a hiking app called My Tracks, a wonderful MP3 player called Power Amp, and Google Maps - all of which are available in the main Google Play Store, but none of which are available in the Android version of the Play Store. One by one, I'll go through that \"sideloading\" procedure to get them on the Kindle 8.9. I have the 4G version of the 8.9, so the hiking and mapping apps might be available. If not, I'll just have to continue using them on my cell phone.Applications like Google Maps, GPS, and the hiking app won't work unless you have the $G version of the Kindle, but many other applications will work just fine. Some games are not yet optimized for the HD screen.Portability - if you're using the tablet almost exclusively in your home, get one with a 10 inch screen. Google makes one, but there are better 10 inchers out there - iPad (boooo!!!) and Asus Transformer 700 have the best screens, and the Asus has a micro SD card slot which is a very nice thing to have. The Samsung Galaxy 10.1 comes very close behind. Any one of those - and also the 8.9 - can be paired with a very light \"blue tooth\" keyboard, or docked to the keyboard, for those times when you're going to do extensive writing. For short notes and emails, the \"virtual keyboard\" of the 8.9 is perfectly fine, but the virtual keyboard on a 10 inch tablet would be better. The 10 inch screen would be better for watching videos or movies, or for reading photo-heavy magazines like the National Geographic - but lots of people are delighted with video, photos, and graphics on the 7 and 9 inch screens.However, if you think you'd like to take the tablet along on trips or carry it around town, the more compact 8.9 inch size is much better. It's also better for reading books, because it's easy to hold in your hand. Don't let anyone tell you the 8.9 is too big or too heavy to hold. It's not.Portability - I already covered that. I got my 8.9 because it will be primarily a reading tool for books, newspapers, and magazines - but the darn thing is so adaptable that it can do just about anything I'd want.\"Toooo much information\" as folks say. Hope it helps.Bill Hansen*did I mention how wonderful it is, for these old eyes, to be able to change the size of text as you read?", "Title": "Amazingly adaptable and easy to use", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Author": "shelly", "ReviewID": "R2UNNRRKZVCWGC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So let me start off by saying that Amazon has done it again,I just don't get all the negative reviews about the charger not coming with it, well Amazon has always been up front about that.I am not going to go into the techincal side of that because there are many great reviews that cover this. This is my 3rd Kindle, I have the Kindle keyboard which I really love for reading and using my Audible books on and very lightweight to carry around. I have the original Kindle fire which fell in love with but did run out of space very quickly, my grandaughter is getting this one for Christmas. So before purchasing the Kindle fire Hd 8.9\" with 64gb, I did do many searches and reviews to try and determine which tablet was going to be right for me. I did choose this one because of the service that Amazon does provide, which is top notch, I am a prime member and Amazon does its best to provide great service.I was surprised that most all the Apps that I had on the original fire were able to be downloaded to the new one. I haven't had a chance to use the mobile plan yet because of the wireless so far. The people who have complained about the adds, well what can I say, it is really not a big deal, you see them on any smartphone now adays, I personally would not pay the extra to have them removed as they don't bother the way the tablet works. The only thing that I have noticed so far is the on/off button, it is hard to find but I have an Otterbox for a case and this does help to find it better, by the way Otterbox is the only protection to use for your smartphones or Kindles but that is another review.

I bought a 7\" Kindle Fire HD first and a week later I purchased the 8.9\".  This is not an all inclusive review but I wanted to share my perspective.Positives:1.) I am impressed!  I love the quality of sound that comes from the 2 Dolby speakers.  I think this is one aspect that the iPad does not have for me.2.) The quality of the display is very good.  I compared it to the iPad and I did not see any difference in my opinion.3.) Another selling point is the speed of the WIFI which makes streaming videos fast and enjoyable.4.) Lighter than the iPad and I liked the ability to easily hold on to the Kindle Fire (both 7\" and 8.9\") when compared to the iPads.  I like the ability to hold on to the Kindle Fires and not having them slip out of my hands (like the iPad did).5.) Lower price than the iPad. I could afford both of my Kindles for slightly more than the cost of one iPad.Negatives:1.) Lack of camera on the back. But this is not a huge issue for me.2.) The ads that come on the screens and that you have to pay to have them removed.3.) PowerFast charger was not included in the purchase.  I purchased my Kindle Fires at a local store and because I did so...I did not receive any discount for purchasing the PowerFast Charger.  I think Amazon should provide you with a discount even if you purchase from a local store.  This discount could even be provided to you online that can be used for credit for apps, music or books.  Just an idea.Conclusion:I have been enjoying my Kindle Fires!  The Kindle Fire receives 5 stars from me because I was totally impressed by the quality of Dolby Speakers and the quality of display. The negatives would not prevent me from purchasing another Kindle but I would like Amazon to know how cheesy those ads are.  I am impressed with the speed of how the PowerFast charger works!  My Kindle Fires are thin, easy to hold and provide a positive experience reading books as well as watching videos.  The cost made a big difference to me as well.  Quality for a lower price is important in today's economy!  I hope that Amazon reads these reviews and takes note of the negative aspects (followed by improvements).

I'm not worried about the flash no longer being used for newer android devices. If it's that big of a deal, then just side load Flash,anyone can do it.Some complained about dropbox not being in the apps. Again just side load it and it works fine.

Crisp picture and surprisingly good (almost) surround sound. Watching movies from Amazon is outstanding.Love reading my books on it. Some books should be paper but for most books the Kindle gives more features than paper ever can. It is nice to be able to get word definitions while still on the page you're reading.

The size is good for holding to read or watching shows. It is not so heavy that one tires of holding it too soon.However, not all the features of the fire are equally a success.The Silk browser is poor in features,functionality and performance. Silk tends to crash at least hourly (frequently more often). It's constantly saying whatever page I'm on has stopped responding and would I like the page restored. How could the developers have missed that? Why is there no word about an intent to remedy this constant failure of a basic web browser. Since I bought this for entertainment, I'm feeling less entertained and more annoyed.The typing feature is glitchy.  It frequently misses the first letter typed while compensating you for this problem by giving you double of the next letter you type. Space bar is inexplicably flaky.Some of the applications I've purchased though they were listed as compatible, crash.For this being their flagship Kindle product they should be ashamed to have let this be distributed with flaws that could have been fixed. Now that it is out I'm afraid they will not feel an obligation to improve the interface and functionality but instead will play hot potato, with the consumers holding their potato Kindles. Perhaps they should have named it the Kindle Crash.But possibly I am wrong and Amazon is working to improve it's product. I do have to say I have always received excellent service from Amazon and perhaps it will carry over to the Kindle Fire as well.Update May 29,2013No significant updates to resolve issues.

The light is there when you need/want it and it is a joy to read on, no eye fatigue (at least no more than reading a paper book).  Reading on the Kindle Fire is nice though, the dictionary is exceptionally quick and the responsiveness of the Fire will always be quicker than that of its e-ink siblings, but that's just the nature of the involved technology, not a knock to e-ink, just a kudos to the Fire for being a fast device.  It is definitely nice to read on and I have, all I'm saying is that for lengthy periods of reading I prefer the e-ink, but there's nothing wrong with the experience on a Fire.And just to quickly address the griping about a charger not being included with the device: Amazon is leading the way with this.  How many devices do you own that use a micro-USB charger?  Quite a few I'd imagine.  Why on earth should Amazon add to the per-unit cost by including something that isn't 'truly' necessary nowadays?  I'm very happy to pay a little bit less for something than to have yet another charger laying around.  Yes, it does charge faster with a somewhat non-traditional charging rate of 1.8A, but still, I am all for overall reduced costs and a 'greener' product.  And I think that they make it quite clear that the charger is not included, so for those that complain about it, well, they probably complain about a lot of stuff in life if they pay that little attention to things - everything is everyone else's fault, not theirs, lol.Good luck and please, if you're thinking about it, take the plunge, you'll love your device.", "Title": "Excellent tablet!!

The only way to get these options is to email the file to an Amazon email that they create for you. It will convert the file to the Kindle format for an outrageous fee per Megabit (~$.99) if it is under 50MB. If its more than 50MB you're shit out of luck.I have literally spent the whole day and night, researching this and talking to customer service by email and on the phone just to end up feeling frustrated and disappointed. I had to explain the same thing 3-5 times over to the customer service rep, there was some kind of language barrier with this foreign based help I received.I've wasted my time and money on this device for the purpose I bought it for. The whole thing is set up to keep pumping money into Amazon by forcing you to pay money for every little thing.They want you to buy a yearly subscription to Amazon Prime and then they say you get to watch free movies, get to share books, and get free two day shipping...how is it free if you're paying a yearly subscription???Also, I initially had problems with the Netflix and Pandora apps. It said they were downloaded but they didn't show up in my Apps folder. So I tried re-downloading them and it wouldn't let me because it said they were already downloaded. I emailed customer service multiple times giving them the specifics of my problem and they kept sending me the same generic email that didn't help at all.This device would be nice if you were only planning and buying everything you downloaded through Amazon.

There are just no breaks or pauses.Another thing I've noticed is that this FHD model doesn't 'hang' like the older Fire did between tasks or websites. The new processor must have fixed these bugs.The interface is only slightly different from the original Fire and probably won't take me more than a couple hours to get used to. The scrolling images seem to have a bit more flare on the larger screen, but I've always prefered them over other interfaces like my daughters Nook.  I've noticed a star for accessing favorites in the lower right hand corner of the screen which I find very handy.  And the device tools are now a pull down....ok, that works.  Please Note!  If you buy this with 'Special Offers', you are forced to endure advertisements when you first turn it on, but it's $15 lower in price over a similar unit without 'Special Offers'.  Wow did I get tired of those ads real quick.  Not to worry....I was able to turn them off.....by paying the extra $15 difference in price! (you can do this after registration).I have played around a little with the built in camera, but from what I've seen, the resolution is low.  Skype is a nice feature but I haven't had an opportunity to try it out.So in short, they seem to have fixed all the shortcomings I found in the first standard Fire, improved the useability alot, and added some interesting features. I find this pad much more pleasurable to use and a worthy upgrade. I've handed my Fire over to someone non-techy but very near and dear and she is very happy...I'm mean, she got it for free so why wouldn't she be?

It fulfills ALL the needs I had for a tablet device - by which I am saying, make sure you KNOW what you need!I purchased the Gen1 Fire last year about a day after it was released.  I have used that one for a multitude of tasks - reading, watching video content, staying connected to email (and replying, but not generating new emails), and most of all as a \"replacement\" for paper documents I generated for use in teaching and preaching.  This was the MAIN use of my Gen1 Fire...but the screen was just too small.Thus - when the 8.9\" was released, I ordered within 5 minutes of it posting on Amazon!  Wasn't going to wait this time - went with one day shipping too!  Then the wait...and the early receipt - that rocked!  I received my new Fire (hence named Dad's Bonfire to differentiate from the Gen1) about a week earlier than I anticipated, and immediately put it to work!  It was exactly as I expected - no disappointments.- Large, clear screen - allows me to create documents on desktop in 12point type, on a modified page (9.5\" x 5.5\" custom page size) that fits the width of the screen perfectly.  I save these documents in PDF format to \"fix\" the pages and limit reformatting.  At 12point, with this size screen, my lessons and sermons are perfectly sized to see from a lecturn or pulpit as I teach.- Apps - as I am not into a lot of games (ok...Angry Birds...who isn't) - the apps I already had for the Gen1 also worked on my Bonfire.  The \"paid\" apps (those I didn't grab for free in the past year) all transported as well - Calengoo, Evernote, Whiteboard, EasyPrint, Pulse, K-9 Mail, OfficesuitePro, Sketchbook Mobile, Proclaim Remote, Logos - all worked with no modifications on the new Bonfire.  Because the 8.9\" uses a modified Android 4.1, most open even more functionality.- Carousel - still not a fan...I actually liked the \"Favorites Bookshelf\" from the Gen 1 better.  However, the carousel is smoother now, and more reactive than on the Gen1.  I have not had the problem of earlier reviewers of the carousel \"populating\" with everything.  I am not really a fan of how Favorites are now handled on the 8.9\" - it is as if they are pushing you to use the carousel...it is a neat idea, but not really for me.- Sound - have to say...wow!  Compared to other \"fruit\" models - the dual speaker setup on the Fire is much superior.- HDMI out - I have streamed Amazon content from the Fire to my big screen tv...very nice.- Web - one area that still needs work.  I am not a fan of the Silk browser...am looking at moving to a side-loaded app...no matter what they say, it is slower than others, and seems to push you towards what THEY want...limited ability to customize the \"starter\" page - you get your most visited, then two rows - trending now, and selected sites - both selected, apparently, by Amazon...not for me.- Books - there are some really cool options now - like 2 column reading, x-ray, so on.  The pages are not as \"bright\" white as the Gen1 - which at first I didn't like, but now realize it is actually easier to read on!  There is even a \"shadow\" where the crease of the book pages would be - it looks like a \"real\" book!- Auto-Brightness - is outstanding.  I no longer find myself adjusting for reading in bed vs. reading at office vs. using outdoors.  Used for first time yesterday outside (not in direct sunlight, of courst) - and found I had no problem seeing the document I was speaking from.  Outstanding...- Dual-channel - very nice, as I am now using the 5G side of my router, slowing the demand on the 2.4 side for all the other devices at home!- Colors, Resolution, Screen - absolutely beautiful!  What more to say!Folks - for this price - there is nothing out there that does what I WANT to do.  I looked at the fruit - too expensive, especially when you consider the apps I would need.  Nexus - didn't handle documents with the ease that Amazon/Send to Kindle/Fire does!  I have installed the free app from Amazon on all my desktops, which gives you the \"Send to Kindle\" option...sure makes it easy to get a document to my Bonfire!  Two clicks on the document, and zap - there it is on the carousel!  I do not \"create\" much on my Fire - that is what desktops and laptops are for...this is my \"consumption\" device...teaching, preaching, reading, studying, checking email, so on - which is what I would use any tablet for...and the larger format of this Fire is OUTSTANDING for this.  For the money saved vs. other tablets - I have purchased a 7\" Fire for my daughter for Christmas...tell me another place you can get the large size and the mini size for these prices!!!Back to beginning - make sure you know what YOU WANT to do with a tablet - and let that drive your decision.

I finally went with the Fire based mainly on what appeared to be some impressive features for the price as well as the ability to utilize my Amazon Prime membership with the device (The Galaxy Tabs are not supported for some odd reason, yet the Ipads are?).Since there are thousands of reviews, I'm just going to give my TOP 5 pros and cons.The pros so far:1) Setup couldn't have been easier! I love how they had much of the tablet configured with my Prime movies and all my purchased music available, etc. Really well done!2) The tablet feels good in my hand and I love the \"in between\" size of 8.9\" vs. the 10\" I was used to and the 7\" which I tried and was way too small for me.3) The screen is very nice and it has a surprisingly good resolution for watching movies. I will say it's great to finally have a tablet where I can utilize my prime membership.4) The app store has a good selection and downloading is even easier than the Google Play store. Also, it's nice to be able to make a subtle adjustment to the settings on the device so I can still download apps not available on the Amazon store. Amazon does need to beef up their selection of apps though.5) I think the speakers are pretty darn impressive! You can hear the difference between other tablets, it's that striking!The cons so far:1) I know others have said this ad nauseum, but paying extra for a charger that EVERY OTHER manufacturer includes just left a very bad taste in my mouth. I would have preferred they increased the price of the tablet by $10 or $15 bucks if they really couldn't afford to include it for the price they charge.2) Although I'm starting to get used to it (out of necessity), I'm not a fan of the carousel at all. I guess I understand why Amazon decided on a modified Android OS, but it would be nice if there was an option to revert back to the traditional Android look as it is far more user friendly than what Amazon has created. Frankly, it's making me question whether I made the right decision to purchase the Fire.2) Maybe it's just me, but the Amazon web browser is terrible! I don't know if I've seen pages load so slowly since I had an old 486 computer in the 90's! And I have a terrific internet connection at home with a blazing fast router, so I'm pretty sure it's not me. But the Amazon browser showed choppy displays, etc. On some pages, I couldn't even scroll down for 30 seconds to a minute until it loaded. Navigation wasn't good and it's not nearly as customizable as other browsers. Thank goodness I was able to add a third party browser which is working very well (fast and clear, etc.). I know I won't ever use the Amazon browser again unless they have a significant update which corrects all the performance issues.3) As has been stated by most, the power and volume buttons on the side are so flush to the device that they're extremely hard to access. Raising them just a hair would have made a big difference.4) The lack of a micro SD slot is a big miss and again makes me wonder if I made the right decision. I guess I was more than a little surprised at how much space Amazon's OS took up out of the 16GB. I would have gone for the 32GB but for some reason it was not eligible for the student discount, which didn't make much sense to me. On the plus side, I do like that all my Amazon media is stored on the cloud and easily accessible and I have a dropbox account for the rest, but there are times you want to store more on the actual device. And the way the Fire is setup, 16GB doesn't provide much flexibility at all.5) I was very surprised at how poorly downloaded magazines looked on this device. I have a PC World subscription and since they went all digital this past month, the only way for me to read the magazine is by downloading. I would have expected the Fire to be extremely adept at this, but it was quite the contrary. My old Galaxy Tab 2.0 had more clarity and smoother action from page to page. The Fire was extremely choppy and did not display the sharpest picture. In fact, when turning pages the images would distort for at least 5 to 10 seconds on the Fire where that never happened on my other tablets.In conclusion, I really WANT to like the Fire more than I do. Without an Android based option to view Amazon Prime content and all the options which should make this a \"best in class\" device, the execution of several key tablet essentials is inconsistent at best. Maybe there are explanations to the issues I've discovered that Amazon could answer but as of now, I'm not sure as to whether I'll keep this after the 30 day return option period.", "Title": "Expected More...", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "Robin C.

There are things it does extremely well, but there were enough negatives about it that I ended up deciding to return it.The Good:- The screen is beautiful. It looks awesome on games, videos, books...everything, really. The size and orientation of the screen is also ideal for watching movies in a widescreen type format.- The speakers sound excellent. I had not imagined that I would ever enjoy watching a movie on a tablet versus on my TV, but the speakers on the Kindle Fire are very immersive and clear.- The size is comfortable. I had not wanted a full iPad because I've always thought my wife's is a bit bulky. Amazon has really nailed it in terms of a comfortable size and weight.- Integration with the Amazon store is excellent. For Prime videos, Kindle books, etc, the operating system is really well oriented to Amazon's content. The best software on the tablet is what is used for accessing Amazon content.The Bad:- All of my problems with the Kindle Fire are software oriented. The built in e-mail client synced for me the first time, then when I tried checking my e-mail again later, it just gave me the spinning icon and never refreshed. Not even after a reboot. The video camera worked, but when I tried getting Skype to work (which had been a selling point for me), the audio would work, but video would never turn on with Skype. It would try, then just give up. I tried to like the Silk browser, but I got tired of how every time you open it, it has to reload all tabs from scratch. It's time consuming, and also a bit buggy. The Facebook app on Kindle is just awful. If you were to look at a picture, you would have to hit the tab on the right, then find the back button just to get out of viewing the picture. I kept noticing that whenever I needed to check e-mail or Facebook, it was more convenient to put away the Kindle and to get out my iPhone than it was to deal with the Kindle apps.I think I was most disappointed to learn that the Kindle Fire cannot play digital copies of movies that I've purchased on Blu-Ray. I had bought extra storage in the Amazon Cloud, expecting to upload several of my movies to access whenever I desired to. But despite trying a variety of video player apps, I had to give up. Frankly, as you cannot play the common types of movie files that would necessitate larger cloud storage, despite a great job of integrating Kindle Fire with the Amazon Cloud, this renders the service much less useful than it would be otherwise.To summarize:Amazon has done an outstanding job on the Kindle Fire HD in terms of its hardware, its physical design, and its integration with Amazon. If what you are wanting is a device specifically for viewing Amazon video content, Kindle books, and playing games, this is an awesome purchase.I wanted a device for those reasons, but I also really wanted it for a bit of other productivity purposes, such as e-mail, internet, Facebook, etc. Unfortunately, as of the time of my review, the software for other basic uses is just too buggy. I was disappointed to see just how low of a priority it is for many developers to make apps for Android type devices. It wasn't that I couldn't get most of the types of apps I wanted; it was that the quality of apps developed is just so far lagging behind what I can get on my Apple devices.So in the end, I sincerely hope that in the upcoming months, Amazon will be successful in getting the bugs out of a lot of the software for the Kindle Fire HD. But for now, I just couldn't justify spending close to $500 for a device (after purchasing the 32GB 8.9\" with extended warranty) that was so unreliable for e-mail, Facebook, Skype, and other apps. If you already have a tablet for productivity, and just need another tablet to keep you and your family from fighting over who gets to play a game or watch a movie, this makes a great second tablet.Incidentally, I did NOT go out and buy an iPad, and am planning to hold out for a few more months to see how things progress. Amazon has an amazing piece of hardware, but the software leaves a lot to be desired. I'll continue to root for them.

It was just last fall, after all, that I bought my first Kindle Fire (that's when it was launched after all). I've been addicted to it ever since, and it goes wherever I do. Or at least it did. That's because Amazon announced a refreshed line of Kindle Fires for 2012, and I knew that I had to have one.Not so much because of the fact that there was anything wrong with my trusty Kindle Fire, mind you. It was just that the new ones packed some amazing features that I knew would enhance my Kindle experience with books, videos, music, audiobooks, games, and apps.New Kindle ModelsThe classic Kindle Fire would be dropped to $159, and is a great value at that price if you are looking for a solid, entry level device. It has even been slightly improved since 2011. The new Kindle Fire HD would boast even better screen resolution and a faster processor, more memory, and better Wi-Fi for $199. It was released shortly after being introduced in late September.I, however, was holding out for the larger, 8.9\" Kindle Fire that was set to be released on November 20th. This was a trade-off to be sure, as my old Kindle, at 7 inches, was not much larger than a paperback book and immensely portable for that very reason. Still, I decided that I wanted the larger model at 8.9 inch screen size.The 8.9 inch kindle Fire HD comes in several flavors. I opted for the basic model that runs $299 and has 16 GB of internal storage. The next model up will run you $70 more at $369, with the only difference being 32 GB of onboard memory. Both of these kindles are Wi-Fi only.If you want a 4G LTE model, those are available starting at $499 for a 32 GB model and $599 for a 64 GB version. Monthly data plans are available, as well. For occasional use beyond the reach of a Wi-Fi network, you can pay $49 and get 250 MB of data a month for a year. This also includes an extra 20GB of free cloud storage and a $10 credit towards the Amazon app store.It should be noted that all of the Kindle Fire models will display ads when you start up the device. This is no big deal for me, but if you want to remove that feature it will cost you another $15.Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch vs. ipad MiniAs I said, I had opted for the $299 Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch model. But a funny thing happened on the way to the tablet. Apple, sensing that other makers were eating its lunch with smaller, cheaper tablets than the ipad, launched the ipad Mini before I received my new Kindle.That, I think, makes an excellent segue into an ipad Mini to Kindle Fire comparison. Obviously, at $299, the Kindle HD 8.9 inch will save you a few hundred over the ipad 3. But what about a comparison to the new ipad mini? I had a decision to make when the ipad mini was announced, especially since most of my family is already hooked on Apple and has been bugging me to convert. I had a considerable amount invested in Amazon content, though, which was a consideration. Most of it would be portable to an ipad, but the easy interface to your content that the Fire features would not be the same.For starters, the ipad Mini would cost me $30 more for a similar 16GB, Wi-Fi only model. Not so much as to make a difference, but then I started to look at the specs. First off was the display, and the Kindle clearly had the advantage over the ipad Mini. The 1920 by 1200 anti-glare display was clearly superior to the ipad's 1024 by 768 display, and of course the Kindle's screen is an inch larger. The Kindle HD also boasts a faster processor and Wi-Fi, and better speakers. The ipad mini seems to have the edge with it's camera.I decided to stick with my order for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch model.The Kindle HD ArrivesEarlier I mentioned that my new kindle HD was to ship on November 20th. But as I was checking my Amazon account on the preceding Friday, I noticed that the $299 for the device had already been charged to my account. Sure enough, a quick hop over to Amazon.com indicated that the Kinddle HD had shipped the day before, and was on the UPS truck for delivery.Initial ImpressionsI was happy to get my kindle HD early, and popped it out of the box posthaste. I was immediately impressed by the larger display and new design. The device did not have the same heft as my own kindle in proportion to its size, and as a result felt less sturdy. Still, it's clear Amazon has learned from some of the mistakes they made with the original Kindle Fire.First off is the power button, which has been moved from the bottom to the top of the device. This was a major annoyance on my old Kindle Fire, as it had an alarming habit of being depressed when the tablet was held upright and trying to shut the power off.A volume control button is another welcome change; the first Kindle Fire did not have one at all. There's a new front facing camera and improved speakers on the sides of the device as well. The micro USB connection is joined by a micro HDMI output, too.One pet peeve that I have is that there is no power adapter included. While you do get a micro USB cable, this is really for connection purposes to a PC; same will not effectively charge your tablet. Actually, it's not really the omission of the power adapter that bugs me. Let's be fair, the kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch is a steal at $299, and you can get an Amazon \"Powerfast\" adapter for $19.99. It's just the plug really, and connects to the device via the included cable.My peeve, then, is that I would have liked to have known ahead of time that I needed to buy the power feed. Luckily, my old Kindle charger is compatible, but won't charge the device as quickly as the new one will. Annoyingly, Amazon changed the price to $9.99 on the adapter, but then when I went to buy one the price had changed again to $19.99 again with a $3 MP3 credit. I will hold off, I think, to see if it goes back down.My Kindle HD arrived fully charged and already configured to my Amazon account. I did need to download a software update which took about 30 minutes to fully configure and delayed my ability to start playing.Incompatible AppsWhile the power adapter omission was mildly irritating, the inability to use a number of the apps I had purchased for my Fire was downright infuriating, such to the point that I called Amazon and obtained an RMA. To be fair, most of my apps work on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet. One in particular, though, that I use almost daily was incompatible when I received my tablet.The app in question is Comics by Comixology. I use this app almost daily, and have spent a considerable amount on digital comics that I and my sons read. To be unable to access these was intolerable, and I called Amazon Tech Support and e-mailed Comixology about the problem.I wasn't alone in my dismay; a number of new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet owners also posted their displeasure on Amazon and the Comixology Facebook page. It seemed amazing to me that Amazon would not correct this, since they get a cut of every comic sold through the tablet app.Fortunately, Amazon and Comixology worked to resolve the incompatibility issues and I was able to download the app the following day. Of course, you may not find my tale of woe all that disheartening, especially if you don't read comics. You should, though, be concerned about the incompatibility of apps, and I should further advise that I do have a number still that won't work. This is  not a problem that Apple has had from ipad model to ipad model.NavigationAs with the original Fire, you will find navigation is fairly intuitive, and not much has changed in the department. The home screen is where the action is at, and you can always navigate to it from any book, video, or app by tapping the screen at the bottom to retrieve the menu; then hit the home icon. It's that easy. Once there, you will notice key information displayed at the top of the screen: \"alerts\" about software updates, new e-mail, and even a friend's latest move in \"Words With friends\"; the time; Wi Fi status; and battery strength.Gone, though, is the \"Gear\" icon that brught you to your settings menu in the past. Instead, you need to swipe down from the top center of the screen to get to some options: you can lock and unlock your device, adjust volume, screen brightness, see and choose wireless networks, sync with Amazon, see device information, and much more.You have several ways to access your content. The home screen is presented as a row of your most recently used books, apps, videos, and websites. This is called the \"carousel\", and you can scroll through it with the touch of a finger. Any time you access anything in the carousel, it gets bumped to the front of the line. Again, this is much the same as the first Kindle Fire.Holding your finger on a content pane in the carousel allows you to delete it from rotation, delete it from the device, or add it to your favorites. Favorites, however, are no longer displayed on a lower \"shelf\" on the home screen. Instead, there's now a favorites icon in the shape of a star beneath the carousel (it's also accessible from most other areas in the device). Tapping it at any time will bring up all the content in your favorites menu.You can also access content directly by category from a menu above the carousel.  In addition to the original Kindle Fire Options of Newsstand, Books, Music, Video, Docs, Apps, and Web, you can also choose from Shop, Games, Audiobooks, Photos, and Offers. From each of these categories, you can see content on the device and in the \"cloud\", and also access the Amazon store to purchase more. As with the first Fire, there is a search box on the home page and for each content category.How Much Storage Do I Need?The amount of storage that's right for you is entirely dependent upon the way you use your Kindle. At 16 GB of memory internally (only 12.8 GB of which is user accessible), I have roughly twice the storage that I had with my old Kindle Fire. Truth be told, I never used all of that, though I came close. Mostly that is because I generally access my content from the cloud. If you are not often in range of Wi-Fi and store more content locally, you may choose to opt for more storage.Managing your content and the amount of memory it consumes is simpler with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet. From the settings menu, simply choose \"Device\" and \"Storage\" and you'll get a detailed analysis of your usage by content type. Tapping any of these categories will bring you to a list of that content; you can delete what you no longer want locally to increase available memory.The CloudThe Cloud allows you to store content on Amazon's servers for access through a Wi-Fi or cellular connection with compatible models of the Fire HD. The Fire HD has excellent Wi Fi detection and transfer speed capabilities, indeed even better than the ipad 3 offers thanks to the dual Wi-Fi antennas. This allows you to transfer files to your device in no time.Amazon gives anyone with an Amazon account 5 GB of storage space for free. You can use it to store documents, videos, and music for your Fire. Any music, magazines, books, and videos you purchase through Amazon do not count towards your limit. Need more space for your stuff? Amazon offers the option to buy more, the cheapest plan being $20 for an upgrade to 20 GB. Best of all, this option includes unlimited music storage. Amazon recently copied Apple's \"matching\" option; if they have the same music in their library that you are uploading they will automatically upgrade your tracks to 256K or better quality. There is no charge for this with one of the paid cloud plans.Available ContentAmazon has the drop on anybody else in the content category. Not even Apple comes close, except perhaps in music, but Amazon offers reduced price songs and albums that I have rarely seen on itunes. In addition, many purchases on Amazon come with promotional MP3 credits, so you can download songs as a bonus. While it's true that you can access this content through other devices, for me the integrated interface with the Kindle Fire makes them much easier to get to.While it is true that the content is not unique to this device and may seem a curious component of a review of the Kindle Fire HD, I truly believe that it is a very important factor in your decision on whether or not to buy this device or an ipad, Surface, or Nexus tablet.NewsstandAmazon offers a number of magazines and newspapers by single issue or by subscription. You can find such favorites as Time, The Economist, Forbes, Us, Popular Science, and much more.BooksAmazon has a massive library of books to choose from, most of the latest titles and lots of classics, too. Many books are free. I had a large library already from Amazon, so I was good to go with my new Fire HD. I generally keep a few on my device and store the rest in the cloud for later retrieval. As with all e-readers, I love the convenience of being able to download a book the day it is released. No trip to the store required.Also par for the course is the ability to adjust display (meaning font and print size) to your liking, though sadly the text-to-speech option that was present on the very first Kindle is still not available. Here's hoping Amazon brings it back someday.MusicThe Fire is a surprisingly good music player. Although it will never replace my Zune as my preferred music device, I do enjoy streaming music from the cloud while web surfing or playing games. As with the Kindle Fire, the Fire HD boasts an impressive little music player that streams high-quality audio to your headphones from the cloud or local storage.There are a number of apps available for music lovers as well, most of them free. Pandora, Spotify, and Iheart Radio are all available for the Fire HD.VideoStill annoying is the inability to play digital copy from my blu ray purchases. That said, there are plenty of options for video with the Fire. The Amazon video store offers a large library to select from, with much content available for rental or purchase. Any purchased content can be accessed from the cloud or the device.When renting a title, Amazon offers the convenient option of downloading to the device so that it can be accessed when Wi Fi is not available. You have 30 days to start watching; once you do the content will be deleted after a 48-hour window.DocumentsDocuments can be accessed from the cloud or the device for access as well. Quickoffice is included at no charge with your Fire HD. This comes in handy, though the files are locked for read access (though different apps allow you to alter them).You can upgrade to the full version of Quickoffice for just $15. I in fact did this shortly after purchasing my first Kindle Fire. This allows easy editing and creation of documents.AppsAmazon is not even close to offering the app content that Apple does, and likely never will. While the library of Android apps available for the Kindle has grown, it is still only a subset of those available on most dedicated Android devices (such as my cell phone). Bottom line for me, though, is that the apps catalog on Amazon suits my needs, and while I may not always be able to get an app I want, I can usually find the app I need.AudiobooksA large library of audiobooks is available through Audible.com, an Amazon company. These are my constant companions on the way to and from work, and help me to endure the traffic.WebThe Fire HD uses the Amazon Silk browser. It's intuitive, learns from the sites you visit most frequently, and starts loading them in advance on its servers when you start surfing (you can shut this off if you prefer). You can bookmark favorites, and websites look good when displayed in either mobile or normal formats. Overall, though, it's not all that different than most of the popular browsers out there.PerformanceAs with the Kindle Fire, Performance of the Kindle Fire HD has pleased me overall. Using the performance of my old Kindle Fire as a baseline, it's easy to see the improved performance on this model.Wi-FiWeb pages load more quickly than in the past with the improved Wi-Fi connectivity. Video and music stream flawlessly with a strong source as well. All the better to access your content from the cloud.Video DisplayThe display is perhaps the most impressive new aspect of the Kindle Fire HD. Video is crisp and clear, and HD movies look better than ever. Apps and games are most impressive, with some HD Apps like \"Angry Birds Star Wars\" appearing in glorious, sharp detail and amazingly rich, vibrant colors. Digital comics from the Comixology app truly dazzle.Books, also, are easier to read, at least for me. One of the disadvantages of the Fire line is that it lacks the e-ink of the original Kindle. That device was much like reading a conventional book with e-ink. The Fire's display was prone to impart eye fatigue for this reviewer much more quickly. Happily, with the higher resolution and improved display, this does not seem so much a problem with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet.On Screen KeyboardCertainly, the larger display of the Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet allows facilitates the use of the keyboard for e-mail and word processing much more easily. Quite simply, it's much easier to type on the screen keys with the larger display. Often, I found myself making numerous typos on my old Kindle Fire because the keys were just too small; tilting is sideways to increase size reduced my content space. Not as much of an issue with the larger Fire HD.ProcessorSo far, I haven't noticed any benefit from the faster processor. All my games and apps run pretty much as smoothly as they did on the original Kindle Fire. Perhaps that's a compliment to that device.SpeakersAnother of the features that Amazon touts as much improved are the speakers. \"Exclusive Dolby audio and dual stereo speakers for crisp, booming sound without distortion\"  are promised. From my standpoint? Not so much. While it's true they are slightly louder, a welcome improvement, and have a marked increase in stereo separation, they have little bass at all. I'm not really disappointed about this in such a small chassis to be fair, just don't expect to replace your boom box with the Kindle Fire HD for audio playback.Battery Life and ChargingBattery life has averaged about ten hours of assorted use (apps, books, music, videos) from a full charge. Your mileage may vary with your usage mix; apps and games devour power the most quickly. The device does take a long time to charge with my old Kindle Fire adapter (similar AC adapters can also be used).An hour's charge brought me from 5% to 40% charged; it took another two hours to fully charge my tablet.A Few New FeaturesBluetoothWorth mentioning is Bluetooth capability, not present on the original Kindle Fire. So far, I have been unable use it to play audiobooks and music through my car's speakers, though I was able to successfully pair my new Kindle to the car.CameraA front-facing HD camera is another new feature on the Kindle HD. While there is no native app for it, it does work with Skype for video calls. You can also use it with facebook to record photos and videos; there are several apps for the camera available for purchase. Picture quality and sound recording are very good, indeed, though I find that the front-facing aspect makes it difficult to take photos of things other than yourself.Amazon PrimeIn addition to the second-day shipping upgrades Amazon prime offers, you can also access a large library of movies and TV shows with your Kindle Fire HD as a member. In addition, there is a large library of books that are not otherwise free available for borrowing, one per month. Prime is, it should be noted, an additional $79 a year, and you are under no obligation to purchase it.Overall ImpressionsAlthough I still have major concerns about the incompatibility of apps, I am nonetheless very happy with my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch tablet. Concerns remain that content I purchase now may not be available for future models. Amazon uses the perpetual access of your purchased content from the cloud as a selling point, so I would expect to be able to use it in the future.Still, the Kindle Fire HD shines in so many other areas that I can overlook this. The brilliant display, increased size, faster Wi-Fi, camera, Bluetooth, slightly better sound, all make this a truly useful one-stop entertainment device. The $299 price seals the deal.The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch device truly completes the evolution of the Kindle from dedicated e-reader to multi-purpose tablet.", "Title": "Excellent Buy Dispute a Few Problems", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3U72XAVCSTIQV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not going to write a book here.

Just long enough to not be able to return it and buy the  32 gig 4G version at near the  same price I paid for my 32 gig non-4G version. It really sticks in my craw as it were, but that's the way the technology ball crumbles. Its irritating but no reflection on the device. As for the device, I Love It! I use it every day, often and with much glee and happiness.  I own an original Kindle e-reader, a first generation Kindle Fire, and now the HD. My wife has an IPAD and when I got the first gen  Kindle Fire, I liked it. I really did. However I still looked longingly and with much envy at her Ipad.  For good reason.  No longer my friends, no longer.  My new  8.9\" Fire HD is wonderful. It has plenty of storage for video, books and apps when I am out of Wi Fi range and when using wi-fi it is very quick on loading web pages, downloads of various media, and I can watch Hulu, Netflix, etc with impunity. Also, I have downloaded some very graphic/ram intensive games and the action is smooth and the video amazing. It really is a fantastic experience. I also like the feature wherein I can plug the unit into my television (HDMI) and watch movies or play games on a big screen. Is it an Ipad? No. In some ways it is better, in some ways not so much.  Is it a laptop?  No.  But that is not what it is meant to be. It is a great media device at a fantastic price.  It is not a portable work computer. You will not crunch numbers or create elaborate spreadsheets though they do have some office type apps available. Its a media device and I believe it does that job very well at a great price point. Do your research, know what you are buying and if it meets your needs go for it.

I have a Kindle touch that has been my constant companion for since they were released. I had and earlier kindle reader, and my wife has the original Kindle Fire.I can say that overall, I have been very impressed! Since I travel extensively for work, most out of the country, i was concerned that the HD would be basically a brick outside the USA. Not so. I was able to use FEAT VPN app, then a VPN service. I was able to stream video with no issues.Picture quality was outstanding! IF streaming speed slowed down, I would see some pixelation, but this is streaming speed not the device. Hd movie I downloaded to the device had extremely good detail. WAY better than my laptop!Sound quality was surprisingly good. No, you are not going to get big booming bass on movies and music. But the sound quality was better than any tablet I have had a chance to play with, including the almighty iPad. In fact, the sound had nearly a surround sound quality. I found that in my hotel I preferred to listen through the device speakers and not my headphones. The surround effect was that good!Apps. People make a big deal about this. I borrowed a friends ipad, and yes there are more apps. More worthless apps! Seriously, just because there are a gazzilion apps doesn't make anything better. Are there apps that do what you need? That is what you need to find out. For me, I have found everything I need without an issue, and quite a few more i don't need! I'm not a big game player, so maybe that's why I haven't had an issue.Navigation. I actually find the navigation pretty intuitive, but then again, I have an Android phone. I find it easier to use than the phone, and easier than my wife's original fire. Maybe it's just the bigger screen size. Also, I did not not notice the \"lag\" that many people mention, except once. Something must have been going wrong because the response was getting slower, then, the Kindle re-booted itself. after that, it was back to normal. I'll keep an I on this to see if it happens again.Browsing. Pretty good. From a user standpoint, I don't see where Silk is either faster or slower for most browsing activities. The recent tabs gets a bit full, but that's easy to clear. Overall, I pretty pleased, but I do miss flash on occasion. I found that the Kindle stayed connected much better than my laptop, and picked up a lot more wifi networks as well. On my n-network at home, it is killer fast! The only issue i had was at the Inchon airport Asiana lounge. I could not get the kindle to connect to their wifi service. My phone had trouble as well, but not my laptop. I noticed other people with different devices not having issues, so there was some sort of compatibility issue.Reading. Ok. I much prefer reading on my kindle touch. It's just much easier on the eyes, and superior in daylight. This is true on with comparing to anything that's not e-ink. Not to mention that the battery on my touch will last for a month with wireless off. The touch will NOT be leaving by bag of toys no matter what other device i have.Music--pretty much a player. Good sound from speakers but way better with headphones.Overall, I am very pleased. I found i used my Kindle far more than my laptop on this trip, including checking and responding to emails with the built in exchange client.

I opened the box, and it exceeded my expectations in size.  It's heavier than the original Fire, but thinner.  I booted it up, and to my surprise, all the books I had purchased over the past year were already downloaded on it (a fact that I had overlooked when ordering).  You do have to tap on them to download, but it takes maybe 2 seconds.  There are more options for the font size, and moving from page to page is just as smooth as the original.The screen is beautiful, and crystal clear.  Scrolling through the books and apps is very easy.  I'm not big on the games, except for Angry Birds, and it plays just fine.  I'm more into the news apps, as well as Facebook and Twitter, and the HD screen makes the pictures and text crisp and clear.  The speakers sound better than on the original, however as other people have said, their position on the back sometimes makes it hard to hear, especially if you're holding it to where they're covered.  But, connect it to a set of speakers or earphones, and there's no problem. I haven't tried the Bluetooth option yet, but do have Bluetooth enabled speakers.I would highly recommend this.

I have an ipod and was used to how the apps and the layout were.  So when I began using the Kindle all I did was kept comparing it to Apple.  Well this is NOT an Apple product.  This is such an amazing device by an amazing company.  One of our main reasons for buying the Kindle was b/c we love to watch movies.  We are able to watch all of our movies that we have bought from Amazon right on the Kindle.  The picture is so clear and the sound quality is wonderful even with headphones on.  We were able to download all of our movies and still have plenty of room.  The other thing that has really impressed me is the Kindle FreeTime app for kids.  I have a 4 year old son who knows how to navigate the Kindle already.  We set up his profile on the FreeTime app and now I do not have to worry about him clicking on something he should not.  Now we have the Kindle locked down pretty good so that so get to anything you have to put in your pin, but with this App I do not have to worry at all.  We have put his games, movies and books in this spot and let him at it.  He will ask us in the morning can he play his Kindle.  I will say I wish you were able to download apps from the Google sight instead of thru Amazon but one thing I have noticed is they are always adding apps so I know the ones I would like will be there sometime in the future.  The screen is big enough so that if I need to enter in information on a website my fingers are not fumbling around.  We have even gotten rid of Netflix and began using the Amazon Prime feature.

If you do have trouble, there is a help section that is clearly marked.LOVE how the \"back\" button is on the of the screen, IMHO, much smarter.

Internet speed is great, able to play videos on youtube for my son.  Volume sounds great. I very easily found the settings features and played around with all the options. Obviously there will be a little exploring time to find where stuff is located, this is expected and part of the fun.This is really a very easy to use tablet. I don't want to say it is only for \"beginners\" because it has a lot of great features if you want to delve into it, but it is easy to use and doesn't take a lot of figuring out. If you have a smart phone, this is easier to use.  If you are familiar with a touch screen, it is a snap.  If you know how to surf the internet, you are golden.  If you are not familiar with the above, it is not the tablet it is the learning curve - don't rate the tablet low because you don't know how to use it. If you WANT to learn how to use it, it is very simple. Some of the negatives are coming from people who expect to know how to use something they have never used before and aren't interested in learning.It come with a USB charging cord, not an issue to me as this standard. It doesn't have a huge users manual but again, standard and there is a help section on the kindle that walks you through things in exact detail.I love this, it does what I expect it to do.

The larger size and the the sleeker case design help it fit into one's hands a lot better than the first edition. The 8.9 inch screen with a resolution of 1920x1200 makes for beautiful viewing experience. It's my home PC resolution squeezed into a display 1/3 the size. The Dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi (MIMO) is also a welcome addition. Finally I can use the 5 GHz frequency on my router. (As a side note; if you're looking to upgrade make sure you get one that can transmit in both frequencies at the same time)The new UI runs a lot smoother than the last edition and looks nicer. The black background just works much better. Please note the UI runs though runs on top of a newer version of Android than the last revision so some thing have changed slightly. But it's nothing that one won't pick up in 15 minutes or less. Haven't had a chance to test out many games that would actually stress the tablet out yet. My favorite pinball game does run smoother and just look beautiful under the new higher resolution.She isn't just a pretty face; my baby also knows how to sing! While I haven't tested it out with any movies yet; the new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is also much improved in the sound department over the first version.It's not all perfect though. My only real issue is with the removable of the power/charge light. Not really sure why this was removed as it was helpful. having said that though there is (as other have probably mentioned) a program called Battery HD that you can download/buy. I purchased the Pro version and one of the things it allows is to set alerts for battery level. It's the perfect way for your Fire to tell you when it's all charged up or when it gets to a level you wished to be warned about. Still wish that the light hadn't been removed though. Hopefully Amazon will add a software method that will make it easier to see/hear charge status.And yes, unfortunately it doesn't come with a charger. I would think in this day and age people already have chargers but that seems to be a major complaint. My suggestion is get Amazon's high powered charger if you don't have one. You're going to need one for other devices in your life anyway and a high powered one is the way to go. This one will charge your Kindle and probably every other device without a charger you'll get in the future.So finally, should you upgrade from the first edition Kindle Fire? YES without a doubt. You already know what you're getting into with Amazon's device and the market place, so that won't be an issue. And you'll be getting something that is much improved. As for new users, as long as you know what you'll be getting in advance I say go for it!

I call it the \"fun pad\" because that is exactly what it is, FUN.  Let us not diminish the work abilities and multi tasking.  The size is more comfortable without making it bulky and difficult to hold (for those midnight oil reading sessions).  Set up was a couple of minutes.  What a knock out picture.

Im no computer expert, so I guess this review is for the everyday person like me that knows enough about computers to use them effectively but doesnt really get into all of the technicalities. I got my kindlefire hd 8.9 about a week ago and I havent been able to put it down. A few months ago I ordered the Ipad but I returned it right away after having buyers remorse about the price tag of almost $1000.  Im so happy that I decided to go with the kindle. I think it is definitely worth the price. A lot of people have complained about the ads but I only see an ad when I turn on the kindle or when I wake it up, other than that, I havent seen any ads. If you're a bargain shopper like me, you wont mind the ads one bit for the lower price.I love that it seems that attention was given to the details like a rubber back, light weight, the size is perfect to fit in my purse, and the ability to hold it in any position and type. Ive read a lot of reviews about how great the speakers are but since this is my first tablet I really dont have anything to compare them to but I can say that they are clear at the maximum volume.Im thinking about getting one for my 22 year old daughter. Her first question was does it have instagram. Unless I need to do more searching, no there is no instagram app which is disappointing.  I even went directly to the instagram site and my pics wouldnt load.  Im also disappointed with the facebook app that does not allow me to scroll down my wall as far as I want. I can only go partly down the page then it stops scrolling. Another problem that Ive had is that the internet browser keeps crashing, very irritating. Ive gone to websites that require flash to open content but the kindle says that its not supported, again irritating.  I dont know if this is the norm for certain content not to be able to open on tablets but if it is then this is a major drawback of tablets for me.  The point of having a tablet is so that I dont have to pull my laptop out just to browse the web. I also have to add that the volume and power buttons are hard to find since they are sort of hidden around the edge. It would be helpful if these buttons stood out more maybe by being a different color or even making the power button a switch that slides up and down vs a push button which is what it is now. Finally amazon NEEDS to include the charger. It was very inconvenient to get the kindle then realize that I could only charge it on a pc so I had to go back, buy the charger, and wait for UPS to deliver it.So far the kindle fire hd 8.9 has been fun to play around with and learn but if the concerns that I expressed were fixed, it would be perfect.UPDATE for new users like me:Check out The Android Guy on youtube. He has great tips on downloading other apps and browsers that arent usually available on the kindle. I was even able to get Instagram!

I pre-ordered this Kindle the day it was announced in September. I was pleased to receive my new Kindle at least two weeks earlier than advertised.The Kindle arrived in the same black packaging as the Kindle Fire. Easy to open with the side zip. Once out of it's box, the Kindle is sleek, thinner than the i-Pad. It is the same height. Simple directions are found in a side pocket of the inner packaging.The buttons are placed along the upper right side, horizontally. They are flush to the tablet, and for some these buttons seem to be more difficult to find.  Turn the Fire on, swipe the lock key, the tablet asks for your Wi-Fi password, you select your time zone and confirm your account. Very easy compared to many other tablets. Now, the real experience begins. Your apps have been automatically configured from other kindles. There is an amazing array of other apps to choose from. The Kindle brings you through the entire process. You click on next to go from one page to the next in the setup process.One of the best improvements, among many is email. Very easy to set up, the email is crisp and clear.  The Fire HD 8.9 is the version to get. Its larger, higher-resolution screen better facilitates Amazon's still-new Kindle Fire interface, and its faster processor makes for a much smoother and zippier experience.. The tablet's availability in a Wi-Fi-only version ($299 for 16GB, $369 for 32GB) and a 4G LTE Wireless version $499 for 32GB, $599 for 64GB, is superb. Speakers are mounted on either side and the sound is so much better.Streaming films from Netflix or Amazon Prime is the way to go. Crisp, clear vision and the HD sound!  Moving from one app to another is very fast. I purchased 'Best 100 Kindle Fire HD Apps' as suggested by another reviewer, and it is an excellent source. For $.99, a great deal of information is available.So far, I have been disappointed with the selection of Kindle Fire HD covers, expensive. I will do more research to find one that is perfect for me.I am extremely pleased with this Kindle Fire HD 8.9 tablet. It has everything I have wanted in a tablet with faster service and Amazon's experience. The lack of a specific charger is not a problem, I have several I can use.

I have the original Kindle Fire and have been happy with it, but the new version addresses most of my gripes with the previous version.  First and foremost, storage; I purchased the 32 Gb version and it was well worth the extra money.  I have download a couple audio books, a music playlist with about 50 songs, all of my magazines, a few books and most of my apps and have about 23 Gb left.  Doesn't sound like a lot, but I was constantly managing the space on my original Kindle Fire and would have never downloaded music or audiobooks, it just took too much space.  The gmail integration is much improved.  I can move e-mails to my gmail folders with the native app and it also syncs to my contacts and gmail calendar.  Ahh, so much nicer.  There is more customization available such as the ability to set the brightness to auto, turn off the last web page showing on the carousel, turn on notifications for applications, and turn off Amazon Home recommendations.  Amazon has learned there lesson well.  Give us an interface that is easy to use, but give us some customization to make it pretty.  The HD screen is very nice.  I plugged the device into my flat screen and the picture and sound were good.  Bluetooth was easy to use and worked with my bluetooth headphones, including forwarding through songs.In fact, I would have rated this five stars if not for the Silk browser.  Don't get me wrong, it gets the job done, but it crashes on the more intesive websites (esp. Adobe).  Also, if Amazon is driving us to the cloud, why can I not store my bookmarks there?

I've had it for about 2 months now and the only way to describe my feeling toward it at this point is buyer's remorse.  I had bought this as a replacement for my original iPad which is no longer supported and it has gotten quite sluggish at pretty much everything.  Initial impressions were good--but it is no iPad--it was also half the cost.  There were annoyances like it just freezing up completely for 30 seconds at a time before resuming what it was doing like nothing happened, but I figured I could live with it for at least a year despite those and it wouldn't have cost me any more than my iPad cost me since I got less than three years worth of useful life out of it.  BUT, two months in I am now getting about 10 minutes worth of use out of a complete charge!  Let me say that again in case you weren't paying attention...10 MINUTES USE FROM A COMPLETE CHARGE!!!  With a full charge I play about 10-20 minutes of Simpsons Tapped out on it (which doesn't take the battery meter down very much) and then leave it until the next day when I get home from work and it ALWAYS says that the battery is dead.  I don't have any notifications turned on so I don't know what it is doing all day that drains the battery--but at this point it is nothing more than a $400 paperweight--yes, I bought the ridiculously expensive cover too.I will unequivocally state that I'd pay twice as much for an iPad.EDIT:So after letting this sit for a day I realized that it wasn't much more than venting and didn't really provide much useful information.  So, here is something a little more useful to add.The display is excellent, though the touch sensor is not the greatest--does not seem to be very accurate or sensitive and suffers from the general lag of the system.  The system is a bit slow to respond to input, but seems to run most things pretty quickly.  I'm not sure what might cause this other than the overhead of Android.Many complain about the lack of the Google Play store, but I don't really see this as that big an issue.  You can side load anything that you download from Google Play on another Android device--it is just not nearly as convenient.The placement of the power button is annoying--I'm constantly accidentally turning it on or turning it off.  (Or at least I did when I was using it more.)Web browsing is one of the major things I had planned on using it for.  Web browsing is not a joy.  I don't remember specifics but after about a week I gave up on it for that purpose and went back to my iPad.One thing that I found extremely annoying is when I had the notifications turned on it would take me to the Amazon App Store when I told it to clear the notifications.  I'd think that would only happen if I tapped on a specific notification that was an advertisement.I also purchased the HDMI cable for it and was disappointed in the output of it.  It wasn't horrible, but not something I would use without a specific need to.The micro-USB charging port is HORRIBLE!  If you don't get the cable plugged in just right it will not charge at all--and it makes the device extremely hot to boot.  Always check to make sure you have a charging indicator when you plug in the cable.The extremely expensive case also disappointed me.  It does not fit tight enough and I've accidentally pulled it off several times when I've picked it up by the corner.  It also exacerbates the issue with the placement of the power button.I don't use my tablets to watch movies but when I tried that it seemed to work without problems.  I also don't use them to listen to music and I'm pretty sure I didn't even try that so while the sound is pretty good on the things I've used it for I can't really say how it might be for things that are more sound demanding.  Another thing I don't use it for is reading books--I have an e-Ink Kindle for that.  And I've never used the camera on it.One thing that I find annoying about Android in general is the lack of quality apps available.  Sure, the big name apps from the big companies all work well and I don't have complaints about them, but for some things it is really hard finding a decent app.  Luckily the Kindle Fire versions of apps are usually well done so given the choice I select those.Still, the negatives outweigh the positives and I would still be willing to pay twice as much for an iPad.

The speakers are really incredible for such a small gadget.  Easy to set up and I find the keyboard just fine and no inconvenience to check for battery.

Why did I settle on this one over all the rest?  Because during my research I kept coming back to one fundamental question...what will I use the tablet for?  I'm already an Amazon Prime member and ultimately I decided I wasn\u2019t looking for a work horse tablet to run productivity software; I wanted a right sized media device that also lets me surf the web, check e-mail, run apps and watch YouTube videos.  And I didn\u2019t want to pay a fortune for it.  The HD 8.9 fits that bill nicely.  I travel a lot so I sprung for the 32 Gb version which I highly recommend.A lot has been commented on about the location of the power plug port and design of the power and volume buttons but I found once I got used to the buttons it was pretty easy to find them.  Even though the volume buttons don\u2019t show which increases or lowers the sound it\u2019s actually easy to figure out; up is for louder and down is for lower. But I think the power port would have been better placed at the opposite end of the on/off switch because as it is now you can\u2019t use the case as a stand unless you do what I did and turn the kindle upside down in the case.  That way the power can be plugged into the top allowing use of the case as a stand.As for web browsing I am very satisfied in how the browser works for me.  It\u2019s not the smoothest and fastest browser but it works well enough.  Overall I really like the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 because it fits what I want to use it for.  I use my laptop and desktop for productivity\u2026I use my Kindle for entertainment (video, books, games, surfing the Web).", "Title": "Does everything I want it to do!!", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1EDEE2L256YO1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only owned two tablets The fire 1st gen and now this. I use Amazon alot for shopping as well as my media needs. So when looking into a tablet (and I did compare alot of them) I found that I just wanted to stick with Amazon.My take on the fire HD....The ADS. for me not a problem its only on screen saver(at this time no plans to remove them)Recommendations that appear. Not a problem I happen to like them there. I use on Amazon when looking for new items anyway so them being on home screen to me seems a plus.Silk. It has no adobe flash plug-in. Not a problem with as yet was able to watch youtube mobile and visit all my normal web sites.Reading. I have to say I find reading on it as easy as first Fire even better, It has text-to-speech, and some books can be read by a real person if you also have the audible book. Which is actual kinda of cool. Gave it a try with Acheron by Kenyon which I happen to own in both formats (kindle and audible). It adds a new depth to the story. The x-ray for books is nice as well, was able to get info on the characters on the page and thier role in book.Video. Nice picture and sound has happy with it.Apps. Now apps are a problem seems alot of apps that work on Fire 1st gen do not work on HD. Don't know if its Amazon or developer issue (hope fix is just an update away). That being said there are apps I wanted on Fire 1st gen that do work for the HD which is a plus.Over all Im happy to have updated to the new HD model of the fire (which I owned for a year and was very happy with).Difference I like the bigger screen, more memory, and speakers and the bluetooth is nice. Paired with my Jabbra Steet 2 I was able to leave fire in room and go next door. FYI the control buttons on the Jabbra do work to control music on fire was able to skip song and replay remotly. For me this will allow me to use the music player on Fire more easly while walking vs the 1st gen where I had to do all from screen in bright sun light (not fun). In closing I love my Fire it was great buy if you use Amazon alot for media even if you dont at price and with Amazon's nice customer service give it try, I think you will be happy.

(More on Binocular Vision at the bottom) I read about a book a month, I write essays for a blog twice a month, and as a student, I found the amazing advantage of having a kindle as an even more portable option to my old, heavy laptop. I could get to my google docs, surf the web, listen to my music, watch media and pretty much satiate all my needs for my laptop save actually typing things out. With the addition of blutooth, I can now do that very easily with a bluetooth keyboard. I like to do alot of casual dining, and I usually read while I'm out and about, so it's great that I can work away at my essays as well. The screen size is apt for long documents, and media consumption without being excessive. With the Marware Vibe case it still just fits in my jacket or cargo pocket and follows me everywhere I go. It's got the right power behind it this time to cut down on the sytem lag present in the old fire.TEXT TO SPEECH: One AWESOME feature I didn't know the Fire had was Text to Speech. It's hidden under the settings while in the reader, under more options. I highly suggest it for the non-fiction reader. This way I can listen to my books at work when I can't be reading them, as well as in my car on the go. Saves a ton on audio books. It does a surprisingly good job with pronunciation and sentence structure, though it's still far from perfect. The lady's voice ends up sounding like British NPR, in that, she sometimes says things a little funny and she reads like it's the news, so it's probably not the best for fiction, but on the whole I know alot of real people that are more difficult to understand.MY ONE CON: The lack of google apps. Particularly Google+ and Hangouts. I was hoping to use the webcam for that...ON THE TOPIC OF BINOCULAR VISION: I can't focus on physical books, I apparently have a problem with my binocular near vision I've only recently found out about where my eyes struggle to focus properly on things up close. Having a kindle on a stand, has allowed me to move books further away, reducing the strain, and unlocked this voracious appetite for books I never knew I had. I always liked the idea of books, people always mistook me for a bookish person, but they couldn't keep my attention, often making me quite tired. Depending on the study you read, up to 7% of the population is affected by this. If you have trouble reading, focusing, or staying awake while reading books, you should ask you optometrist about it, and if so, the Kindle might be just the answer you've been looking for.

Personally, I don't want to be driving over a bridge calculated by an Engineer reading an incorrectly displayed formula, you know?We're developers and work on this problem for all e-readers, and I was more than pleased to see that both the HD and larger screen REALLY helps eliminate this problem, both for texts and journals.

This means that you probably already have a format that will translate your LaTEX, diagrams, chemical formulas, etc. nicely for this device.

My kindle 8.9 experience however has since changed my opinion of the kindle format and of Amazon as a retailer.First of all, I am writing this following packing up 2, yes 2 replacement kindles (simultaneously) that are sitting on my table.I initially purchased the 8.9 HD on Jan 15 for the sole purpose of using it for textbooks. The 1st one came quickly however, the rocker volume was broken so a replacement was sent out. The replacement  had a defective touchscreen that was replaced by another. This one had what the tech described as a defective software/hardware interface. All I know is that the volume did not work when running an app.Sadly, I begin this evening by installing the 4th purchased screen protector on the 4th replacement kindle only to find after flipping it over that this kindle was a refurb! It honestly looked like someone ate a sheet pizza and then drew with their oily fingers on the back. Again, I called and talked to a gentleman who was overseas and spoke in broken English. He is now sending me yet another (5th kindle) and I anticipate that I might perhaps be able to view the digital textbook that was purchased in January for the class that ends in 2 weeks within a couple days.I understand that some people who have working kindle hd's love them. My daughter who owns an original Kindle Fire loves hers very much. I however can't in good conscious recommend this device to anyone. Or the Amazon customer service/replacement team for that matter.

Do yourself a favor and download a replacement browser and set it to be the system default ASAP. I have experienced no issues with competing internet browsers and have concluded that amazon SILK is simply unusable.- Text books are hit or miss. Some of the texts that I have bought have formatting issues that cause in some cases text to be missing and/or picture artifacts to be displayed over certain text boxes, making reading complete chapters impossible.

I wish I had researched it better. Fire is a fine device, but has some shortcomings in areas that are important to me.As an e-book device, my first disappointment was was lack of \"collections\", something I enjoyed on Touch. On Fire, books you download from the cloud appear on your home page page on Kindle's carousel arranged by date, author or title. But say you want to put all your 'mysteries' together? Won't be happening. My Catholic Studies books are mixed in with random fiction. A small thing, maybe, but a step backward from Touch.The next HUGE disappointment is that Kindle Fire seems less able to download and use most apps than my (very simple) smart phone. This isn't just lack of flash, this I believe, is Amazon hoping to market other apps. Take the simple yet very popular Candy Crush game. Nope, can't have that...but Amz has a ripoff of it. Or you can buy a book that will tell you HOW to use the app on Fire.  Facebook and Tumblr, yep, no problem. EPIX movie channel?  Well, you can dl the app, but since you have no Flash, you won't be watching movies with it.  And there are many, many games I had on my Touch which just aren't available on Fire. Look, if someone like ME is angered about apps that won't work, young people will surely be disappointed.I bought the cover Amazon recommends, and it's a dandy cover.

It continues to provide a reasonable platform to access media for entertainment purposes.My primary issue is that the Kindle is not a stand-a-lone device primarily in two areas:1.  It is impossible according to Amazon support to load pictures directly from my camera onto the Kindle Fire HD.  I do not understand the need to load the pictures on to a PC or or on the web via a PC before I can access them on my Kindle.2.  The Kindle also lacks the ability to connect to my WIFI connected printer. While this is likely due to lack of an app for my particular printer (an HP) it does reflect on the lack of some basic apps for this tablet or differences between the Windows and Amazon/Android approach to basic utilities.For now it looks like I will need to use my Windows laptop to accomplish these two basic tasks.  I find myself using the laptop at home and the Kindle less frequently.I expect that when it comes time to replace either the laptop or the tablet, that I will look at a Windows 8 tablet or for a different Android device that overcomes these limitations so that I don't need two computers.I recently purchased a Google Chromecast fob from Amazon and have been able to configure and use it with the Kindle.

That is, until I got my first Kindle fire. I was hooked. (Check out my review). I had no real complaints, but I wanted a bigger screen. Then came Kindle HD, and HD8.9... I had to check it out. I checked the specs and decided that the first one was so well thought out, I'd try it out. Long story short, I was absolutely blown away when I got it. The HD8.9 is much better than I had hoped. The case is slim, really slim. It is balanced in weight, so it cradles in your hand perfectly. Then there is the screen. It's Bright, and very sharp. The color on it is especially warm... and not to be outdone by the sound - If you are into video viewing on your tablet - This is THE best experience out there - PERIOD. The picture is head to head with any Retina display from Apple, but the sound is FAR better. The Dolby speaker setup is absolutely astounding. Particularly when you realize the case of the 8.9 is SO thin. The simple to use \"Masked\" android OS is as simple as ever to use, and because Amazon screens every app to assure it will work on the fire HD, you can be sure it does.The battery life is crazy good, and there are surprise features that are outstanding. For example, The Fire HD has a \"play button\" when you open a book. Pressing the play button starts your Kindle reading the book to you in very clear English. Not and audio book, but every book I have put on it. I really like this... what a cool surprise.Another feature worthy of additional mention is the Wifi reception. The dual band/Antenna setup is very noticeable. A few wireless devices have trouble in certain rooms of my house...but certainly not my Kindle. Reception is strong in every room. This is noteworthy if this is an issue for you. Even my original Kindle fire had reception issues in certain rooms, but not my HD. If you tablet use consists of web browsing, Facebook/Twitter, Email, Movies and books, and general entertainment, you can NOT go wrong with the Kindle Fire HD's. This combined with Amazons rock solid reputation for customer service is reason enough to try it. Its performance and price are reason to keep and appreciate it. If you're on the fence on which tablet to get, I seriously recommend you check it out.You may be as surprised as I was, and if so, you will be quite glad you did.Amazon did it again.", "Title": "Expectations exceeded...", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "R2DYXFKU7PDXUN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The bad:  Typing is not highly responsive.  The processor is a dual-core where as other devices built to be primary devices can be had with quad-cores.  If this comes out with a quad-core, I think it could have quite a slice of the market.That's my only complaint.  The device is born of its roots as a e-reader, and that functionality is simply mind-boggling in its simplicity and beauty.So... the good:Unimagineably beautiful display.  So glad I went with the 8.9 vice 7 inch model. I bought the Kindle Fire HD specifically for the hdmi output port. I tried in on a 24\" Viewsonic 1080p HD computer monitor, and content rendered quite nicely.  Especially nice when reading magazines or books.  HD Movies played great on the larger screen (also tried on an Insignia 32\" 720p HDTV) and this makes it quite fun and convenient.  However, the display on the Kindle Fire HD really blew away the images on my larger monitor and TV.Great Navigation.  It was pretty easy to get up and running with the device. But where my ownership gratitude meter really got pegged was when I downloaded the CNET user guide book in the lending library.Special Offers:  I find this tolerable enough to where I don't see the need to spend $15.00 for the no-ad device.  There's an ad on the unlock screen, and then that is it.  I say live with 'em and spend the 15 bucks on books, magazines and other content.Reading:  Unqualified.  Magazines display so nicely, they're almost preferable to me than hard copy (certainly the aspect of all those trees that gave their lives so I can have something interesting to read is a guilt-trip I no longer have suffer with :) )  I also like how you can zoom on the magazine pages and enlarge them to your own reading comfort level.Power:  The device is VERY SLOW to charge if you use any other device than the PowerFast charger.  I didn't order one when I got my Kindle, as I assumed any of my existing mini-usb chargers would work.  They do.  But it takes many hourse (overnite, actually) to charge.  I've since ordered the PowerFast adapter and eagerly await its arrival.Particular Scenario of note:  I was unable to get an appointment for an eye exam I needed to do this past weekend. The rep told me told me the walk-in wait would be 2-3 hours.  So, I rented an HD movie I wanted to see (you can only download videos if you rent them, a reasonable requirement to me) for $3.99.  Most enjoyable wait time I've ever had.I did go for the 32G of storage.  I did so for several reasons not the least of which is storage of my digital photos, etc.  I think it is the smart move.  I don't regret it at all.(Update) - Forgot to mention about the device's weight.  The 8.9-inch device is a bit on the heavy side.  With the Otterbox I purchased to protect it, the combo weighs in at 2 lbs 5 ozs.  It doesn't sound like much but it is a bit too heavy to comfortably hold and read with 1 hand.  However, the otterbox serves a dual purpose:  as a solid protective case as well as the fact it converts into a tray to stand or lean the device in.  This works well, as doing so makes a VERY comfortable to hold in your lap and read/watch your content.  Matter of fact so comfortable, I would hesitate to own it without the Otterbox (some reviews of the otterbox complain it changes the screen dynamics because of their protective screen - I have not found any problem along that lines.  However you can if you wish remove the screen and put a screen protector straight on the device.  I didn't see the need as I didn't experience any viewing degradation).Overall, I am completely enthralled with the unit.  Just to revisit what I was saying about the CNET lender book \"Mastering the Kindle Fire\":  The Device is set up to primarily direct you to Amazon's content store.  You can override that, but it's not easy to find the how-to's.  This book takes you through that so you can load and run non-Amazon approved apps and content safely and without risking damage to your Kindle's OS.  I highly recommend grabbing that book.Also, I have Google Play and found a website with instructions on how to set that up on the Kindle, as you will have to side-load the Google Play App.  I've not done that yet, but once I do I will update my review.I will also update on how it goes installing and using Calibre as I do have a library of e-books I want to side load on the device.Happy reading y'all!", "Title": "Stunning Device - but not as a primary tablet", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Author": "Tori K.", "ReviewID": "RDURXRJAVCMYU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Amazon Kindle Fire HD is a great Christmas present for ALL ages!

This one replaces my original Kindle Fire (which my wife now uses, replacing her Nook tablet).  This is a great device -- fast, awesome screen and sound, and full of features.  But it is not perfect -- the negatives would include: (1) no rear-facing camera to take pictures or video of what you are facing, (2) no plug-in charging cord -- costs $20 extra (or $10 if you catch it on sale), (3)charging time is not fast, even with the fast power cord.  I have not had it out in sunlight to see how well the screen works outside.That being said, the positives far outweigh the negatives.  First, this device is inexpensive -- especially now that they have lowered the price.  I will pay this price and take a little smaller screen any day rather than pay for an IPad.  The processor is lightning fast, and streams very well -- I love Amazon prime and have only had one glitch so far -- better than my computer (which has an extremely fast processor).  The screen resolution is awesome and the sound is also great.  I can't wait to use on a long plane flight (to Hawaii in May).  The Internet and download speeds are great, and it is much nicer reading magazines on this bigger screen -- as far as books go, I don't really see it being much better than the 7\" Kindle -- but for people with vision issues the bigger screen would make it easier to read in a larger font.Once again love this item -- some minor issues, but for the price it blows away anything else out there.

All those things weren't available on the Nook HD at the time I originally wrote this review.I've read a number of reviews that criticize Amazon for having the Fire HD too proprietary. Obviously they have not even looked at the Nooks which decided to move away from the universal micro USB charger to a proprietary one that doesn't even allow charging when connected to a USB port (only data transfer, with the last OS update it appears to trickle charge now).  For those that think the SD slot or data transfer will allow \"Side Loading\" apps onto the Nook, NOPE, B&N; has blocked that and the only way to even come close to that ability is to become a Software Developer and load the apps as a Developer would... Though even this doesn't allow the apps to be visible until you use button press options to gain access to the apps (with the last OS update developer loaded apps are now visible if they are loaded after the upgrade, those loaded before will remain hidden until they are updated). What a pain, and the UV connection the Nook brags about fails to update as it should causing further headaches.Yes, I'm loving my Fire HD even with a shorter battery life and a missing SD slot. The Amazon AppStore alone makes it a worthy investment, but I added a bluetooth keyboard and now I use it more frequently than I do my Laptop.Since I purchased this through Amazon it came to me ready to go and even gave a discount for the Keyboard and AC adapter I got with it.If you are torn between the Nook or the Kindle, I can tell you that the Kindle sports more features that will be used than those that won't.-- I have to admit that B&N; did a smart move by allowing the Google Play Store to be included in their last OS update.

I used it every day to read, check mail, search the web, play games and watch movies from Droid TV. (great app). I also have a Galaxy tab 10\".When Amazon came out with the HD 8.9\" I couldn't resist.  I received it yesterday and cannot put it down.  The HD is wonderful.  Sound is much better than on the 7\".  I don't have to strain to hear music or movies.  Over all, it is a wonderful upgrade from the regular Kindle Fire 7\".  As for the ads people mention; I don't even see them.If you are considering buying a Kindle, this is the one.  You will not be disappointed.Also, I needed some questions answered about transferring my old Kindle 7\" to a family member, and the email service I received from Amazon was awesome.

After a week with the Kindle Fire 8.9, I have very few complaints and far more praise:The great:- Perfect size for a commuter:  Can be held easily when sitting and standing on the subway.  Very light.- Perfect size for content:  WSJ, Sports Ilustrated, GQ, movies, books all look great. Love the easy navigation for digital publications- Nice, simple layout:  Didn't need much of a tutorial.  Carousel, simple settings page, top navigation all easy to use- Amazon Prime: A great deal if you order often from Amazon and want free content for your Kindle- Price:  I bought during a one day sale for  about $250.  With the free content, can't be beat.- Screen: Text and video crisp and clear- Sound: I used to have to take my nook tablet out of the case to hear.  Not with KindleThe ok:- I haven't paid to avoid ads yet, but I'm close.  Not great with random things popping up as your home screen- App selection: Hoping it improves.  Strong with medai, weak with games. Not much out there.The rest:- I was torn about buying the Amazon case based on mediocre reviews, but I think it's fine.  About as slim, sturdy and light as possible, which is exactly what I was looking for.

I chose the 32 GB version since you can never have too much storage space and doubling the storage was worth the extra $70.I also chose the Kindle over its competitors because I love Amazon and their products and their super easy to navigate website. After I discovered the location of their free ebooks, I have oodles to read and for free and Amazon also offers lots of ebooks under $3.I connected my new Kindle to my PC and it was very easy to transfer my photos and favorite music to the new Kindle...did all this without reading any instruction manual just the old trial and error method.My personal videos were harder but found a free converter link to convert my videos to mp3 so they could be viewed on my kindle:  [...] The Freemake converter was the only one I found that was totally free and didn't put a watermark on your video and was super easy to use too!I also transferred from my PC some of my adobe format ebooks. Still figuring out how to move them to the books tab but for now they show on the kindle carousel and read just like the regular Kindle e books.I chose the Defender Otter box to house my kindle since it comes with the screen protector already in place.It does make the Kindle heavier but makes up for the weight since I just rest the kindle in the otter box tray on my lap. The otter also makes the volume and on/off button easier to see and the touch screen works perfectly with the Otter screen protector in place.The only defect I found on my Kindle was a tiny pin prick sized hole in the center of the glass. The screen protector from the Otterbox makes the tiny hole invisible. I hadn't noticed the pin prick hole in the glass until I had already downloaded all my stuff so decided to keep the kindle since the hole has not affected the performance or appearance.I clicked on the \"web\" tab and was easily able to bookmark my favorite websites. I had no problem accessing them and didn't have any freezing problems.I purchased the DVD Hunger Games through Amazon and was delighted to find it also in my Amazon cloud. It was very easy to also download onto my Kindle device. The picture was crystal clear...truly HD quality and it was a blast to watch the movie on my kindle...speakers worked great and it also worked great with the ear phones I already had.I joined Amazon prime and loved watching the free streaming tv shows...watched the first Star trek episode and several episodes from Glee so far...all free and easy to access. Also \"borrowed\" my first book and am reading it now. Only downside to the book per month that we're able to borrow is that they're not new books.As for the \"advertising\" shown on the kindle it is ONLY on the lock screen and did not distract at all from the kIndle so save your $15 and leave it on!I've been using my Kindle since Dec 23rd and absolutely ADORE it.I highly recommend the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 version!", "Title": "I LOVE my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 32 GB!!", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Author": "Judith E.

I've been a PC guy since the mid 80's and between a desktop and my IPhone I really never saw a place for anything in between.  I certainly wasn't going to pay anymore to an ISP, so for me, wi fi was the way to go.  I may regret that later, but for now, I can load up anything I need at home if I'm going out.  So, I started out reading books and downloading a lot of free content, while buying a few top choices.  Then I discovered how well this thing streams netflix.  HD screen, and the sound, without headphones in a small room reaches around.  I'm amazed at the surround sound effect from such a small device.  I've been keeping an eye on the battery, and I doubt I could get ten hours of straight video from it, but it still holds a charge pretty well.  Better than my Iphone even with wi fi turned off.  Apple has some competition now.  BTW, I have not liked any Android products, so this was a hard sell for me.  Amazon has smoothed it out quite a bit though so its not as clunky an OS as on my previous Galaxy S.  Definitely purchase the wall plug that does not come with the unit.  The fact that they don't include this is literally my only reason for dropping a star.  You don't get GPS with this device, but otherwise it does everything an IPAD will do, without all the proprietary connections.

If I'm going to read anything on it I'll definitely have to rest it on my sizeable tummy while sitting down.I took it out of the box and turned on the power and got it registered.It took some time to find a darn Wi-Fi spot....an area near a window seemed to work best lol.Anyway it got registered just fine but when I tried to set up the AT & T it disconnected....grrrr......I'll try that one again later.All in all...I took to this the same way I took to Window's ME over a decade ago.I'm completely self-taught and this was/is no different.The pull down screens I had mastered in a snap.The little sub menus are easily navigated.I guess some people don't really like the volume or power buttons but for me it's really a non-issue.I've also heard people complain about the lack of a charger.Thanks to all the other reviewers for pointing out that it doesn't come with the Kindle.It should, but I'm not going to freak out about a twenty dollar charger.Coming from Windows ME to this is a revelation no matter the small annoyances.My biggest annoyance seems to be the open Wi-Fi spots.Wireless is nice but still not quite the same as wired.As for the volume and sound...I haven't had time to download any music yet. This is only day one with the Kindle.But I'll update later.I do like all the fun little notification noises you can pick from.I also wish you could choose different wallpapers.And the lock screens are beautiful but I also wish I had some control over those also.I also got mine without the ads so I can't complain about that either but thanks fellow reviewers for pointing out the ads before I bought it.The touchscreen is nice and very responsive.I haven't had time for the apps either but I'll definitely get Skype, the camera and some others.I'm not too big on games or any of that.Facebook looks to be a breeze also.I'll update frequently as I've had more time to explore my new baby.Oh and when the Kindle is turned off the screen is so shiny it makes a nice little mirror.All in all, five stars so far.The technology wasn't nearly as overwhelming as I anticipated and I picked everything up within a matter of minutes for the easy set up and an hour or so later for the menu's and other things.I plan on getting the Logitech keyboard and a headset and some other wireless goodies to go with it.I also got the HDMI cable for my big screen plasma so watching movies should be very nice.Bye bye Window's ME...your glitchy, buggy, constantly crashing self has served me well for twelve years but all good things must come to an end.Daddy will miss you...well..not really...see ya.I like my Kindle....happy, happy...joy, joy.Minor update...I did manage to sign up for AT&T; without a hitch.I, for the life of me couldn't figure out how to connect via the 4g connection. Once again, thank you fellow Amazon users...you have to turn the Wi-Fi off before you can use the 4g. I managed to download a few apps and I think I might need more than the 250mb per month as I'm already halfway though my monthly allowance. I also went into facebook and it loaded very slowly but that may just be the area I'm living in. I'll try Facebook again tomorrow over Wi-Fi. I did download the cameral app and my face, in all of its \"almost, but not quite, middle aged glory\" appeared very grainy but it might just be the app I was using. You know when you look at your reflection in the side of a toaster oven? Uh huh, that's kind of what I looked liked...well...maybe not that bad. :)I also listened to some music samples to try out the speakers and their nice and clear.

Now the negatives:The Internet browser is worthless. \"Silk not responding.\" SO excrutiatingly slow! No Flash player. The web pages don't look normal. Half of the options for Yahoo, MSN are cut off. I can't find anything. This is a pretty big deal, since the main purpose of a tablet is its portability for internet browsing. One should be able to pick it up, browse, shop.My first app download wasn't compatible. Another app slowed the whole system to a crawl. Had to delete it everywhere, reset Kindle.Takes forever to charge. Leaving it plugged in all night should be sufficient, wouldn't you think? Nope, that gets you about 35% battery. It also will not charge while it's being used. If it's out of battery (which happens quickly), you can't use it.Typing is INSANE. You would think that a keyboard would type exactly what you type. No. It guesses the word you want and imports it, sometimes twice right in a row! So, you have to back space. (There's no delete key). When you turn OFF all of the keyboard options, you still get two spaces after an apostrophe, random capitalization, and double words. Also, it's so slow you often have to type three letters, wait until they appear, then type three more.The touch screen is off, sometimes I have to press too hard, other times so soft. My son saw my trying to unlock the Kindle (slide to unlock), I was flicking my finger over and over, harder, softer, slightly above, below, longer, shorter. He said, \"Why does it do that? That happened to me too.\" One time I tried over 100 flicks and could not unlock it. Had to put it down and come back later. UGHGHGHGH!!!The screen locks up! I wait. I tap all over, try the home button, it's completely locked. I close the cover and the Kindle Fire is still on with the cover closed. It's completely locked. The only option is to hold the off button for 30 seconds.And the final straw. It now turns off randomly ALL the time. Right in the middle of a game or TV show, or a magazine article. Whether the Kindle is moved or stationary, doesn't matter. The screen just disappears. Even with full battery. Sometimes I can still hear the sound but the screen is gone. Sometimes it completely turns off, no sound no picture. I just sit there starring at a blank screen like, \"Are you kidding me?!\"  I've almost thrown it against the wall several times.I find myself using my laptop more and more and the Kindle Fire less and less and the Fire is only 3 months old. Very sad.Amazon will not lose me as a customer. They have earned my loyalty. I wanted to be able to spend my Tablet dollars with them. But sadly, I will have to go to the competitor to fulfill Tablet \"needs.\" Luckily the competitor does not also sell Organic/Gluten-Free foods, craft and pet supplies, nutritional supplements, and everything else I could possibly need at awesome prices, fast shipping with satisfaction guaranteed.Update: I now have the competitor's newest product and it has none of the problems that the Fire has. However, the Fire has better looking video and better sound. But now I can't get the Fire's battery to charge. I leave it plugged in all night  and all the following day, come home from work - 40 % charged. I watch 15 minutes of Netflix and I get the \"only 15% battery remaining\" warning. Arghghgh!!!

For $258 each, INCLUDING CHARGER, it was an easy decision.Maybe it's just me, but it's rare when I can't get something to work correctly.  Right out of the box, both Kindle HDs \"fired\" up, and the set-up was so simple that I think most elementary-age kids could manage it.  All the more widely used apps were downloaded and Amazon purchases sync'd in just a few minutes.  The size is right, the video excellent, and the sound improved.

Ignore it, or pay $15 more to make it go away.  Just don't complain because you didn't read the product description!A few observations:- Because the screen is bigger than its 7-inch brother, the keyboard is also bigger; this is a really good thing if you have fingers wider than a pencil.- Web browsing and video downloads are fast and crystal clear, but I also have a solid cable internet connection and a good wireless router (plus a downstairs amplifier).  Perhaps the problems that some have with web connections are more their wireless setup than their Kindle device.- Although it charges properly with the Kindle wall charger, it wouldn't with my Samsung Galaxy USB charger.  I'll need to experiment with a few others to see if this problem extends further.- On the original Kindle Fire, the power button had an LED light that indicated a charging / fully charged condition.  The power button on the \"HD\" model is just an on/off type with no LED.I use tablets for reading books, web-browsing on the couch or while away from home, or to watch the occasional video.  Whenever I want to do something substantial with a computer, I sit down at my desk and work with a keyboard and a full-size monitor.  That's why some of the more capable (but also more expensive) tablets were more than what I needed or wanted.  I was leaning towards purchasing the 8.9 inch HD before the discount.  It lines up very well with tablets in the $300-400 dollar range.  At $258 (INCLUDING the wall charger), it appears a slam-dunk value winner.", "Title": "What, no wall charger???", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Author": "Elizabeth Lyons \"Liz Lyons\"", "ReviewID": "R14Q7OITU06DZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I write long and short reviews.  This one will be short to start with and I imagine I will add to it later as I tend to analyze things in detail.But, I wanted to cut to the chase - I had no idea what I would think of this device, but it was love at first click.Now, I buy a new computer-type device every two years.  I just got a new ultrabook for work/travel purposes in the summer.I spent six months studying every pad in great detail, talked to friends and family, and finally decided on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".First off, it came sooner than expected.  Yay.  Wanted it the minute I ordered it so the wait was tough, but coming early was a bonus.Secondly, the box, the device, every design and display aspect of the Fire HD is gorgeous: sleek, elegant, sophisticated, vivid.  Love that.There were far more apps and features available than I imagined.  It is like being a kid in a candy store.  And the quality is high.  Could it be higher? Maybe, but I don't drive a Jaguar, I am happy with high, not ultimate quality.Like so many things, if someone knows the difference between one HD TV and another, that is their talent.  Mine is getting a great item for a great price and that is what the Fire HD is on both counts.I ordered the sleek little power charger and it arrived instantly - its just as beautiful as the Fire.  So, good on that.  I am awaiting my 'skin' with excitement, due tomorrow (but who knows, maybe today?). Fun.  I topped it off with clear screen protectors.  I am all set now.The Fire took 10 hours to charge through the computer - expected that.  The power charger should cut that in half.  So, charge at night, right?Lastly, let me fully disclose I am an Amazon fanatic.  The company never fails - customer service is a mouse click or phone call away and they are so competent and attentive, they restore my faith in large companies.  So, it didn't take much to convince me I would be right at home in an Amazon environment.That said, let me also say I have Acers, HPs, a Vaio, Mac's, an iPod - I love those brands too - none of them have ever let me down.And finally, I am pretty picky - with Virgo-like insistence on detail and perfection, so if this Fire continues to please me, believe me, you would have to be overly ocd not to like it too.I will keep this updated - gotta go play with my Kindle.Okay, one week or so later and after reading all the cranky reviews as well as the laudatory ones like mine:Here is the way I see it. The Kindle Fire should have every accessory, come in a sleek box but be perfectly and flawlessly protected, should offer every single luxury that anyone anywhere on the planet could imagine. And should cost almost nothing.When I read posts complaining about delivery issues, packaging, and all the things that the uninformed buyers were unaware of because they failed to do their homework, in short those of all the demanding complainers, I wonder what they can be thinking. This device is so cheap and so elegant and so robust. Be grateful. If you lived twenty years ago, you wouldn't even dream this was possible.I liked the box mine came in. It protected it perfectly. For ten dollars I bought the super charger that charges my Kindle Fire in three hours, well worth it. The device itself is beautiful, works flawlessly and has everything I can imagine wanting, and I am pretty demanding.If it makes me happy, then I know the complainers are asking for the moon.Period.", "Title": "I don't just like it, I LOVE it!", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Author": "Shannon Heskett", "ReviewID": "RDEDPST1V7729", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the Kindle Fire HD for my 12 year old son as a less expensive alternative to the 2 iPads that we already owned.

It had some design problems IMO like the protruding power button which was easy to press while in use, etc. That being said - I ended up using it much more than my (original) 32GB WiFi/3G iPad. The iPad however was useful on-the-go (because of the 3G).I decided to wait on the Fire HD this time, and after the price drop, decided to pick up the 64GB/4G LTE version (without ads). I don't know why you would spend $500 to still get ads on your lockscreen ... but I digress ...The picture quality is awesome, as is the sound. The overall build quality and design is markedly better than the Fire - it 'feels' good in your hands, I like the location of the power and volume buttons. As I had the predecessor, the Fire HD UI is pretty seamless and straight forward. Overall, its a very good device - especially for video playback.The 4G LTE option with $50 250MB option was the feature which pushed me over. I only rarely need on-the-go web access, as free WiFi seems about everywhere now, but when I do need it, its good to have.I never had trouble with WiFi before on the Fire, so I can't say the Fire HD is faster or better (?). I guess I could run some internet benchmark tool like speednet ... but WiFi service in my neighborhood has as much to do with microwave oven and cordless phone use (as well as activity among the some 20 APs I can see in my house) than anything else.I was surprised about not having a charger in the box.The ATT service setup is not without some hitches ... if you are an existing ATT customer, you can't (apparently?) take advantage of the special $50/250MB mo promotional offer (its based on email address). After sign up and activation of the account, I had to power cycle the device to really activate the 4G service. 4G in Hillsboro, OR overall seems hit-or-miss coverage-wise, and the device doesn't seem to handle downgrading to a lower-speed option well/at all.I am somewhat surprised at the battery-life of the device. Connected standby/idle states seem 'good' - it holds a charge for days. However, with web-browsing use, the battery drops faster than expected (e.g. down to 80% from full-charge within ~1+ hour?) I'm still trying to find a 'battery use' panel similar to what I have on my Google Nexus ... to see if it is some background app to blame ...And lastly, the on-screen keyboard seems a bit more twitchy than the old Fire keyboard - for whatever reason, its harder to type on the Fire HD (?).8-April-13 UpdateUsing my Samsung/Google Nexus USB charger to charge up this device is glacial ... it doesn't charge to 100% overnight. You should seriously consider the Kindle HD charger for this device.I downloaded a few games to the device e.g. \"Asphalt Heat 7\", and \"Modern Combat 4\" - the gaming graphics performance is honestly awesome for a tablet and totally unexpected (game load times are slow though).

(I purchased the one with 32 GB and no ads.) The 8.9 doesn't look all that much bigger in the pictures on the webpage of the two next to each other, but when I see them together here, there really is quite a difference. I can finally read magazines on my Kindle without having to scroll back and forth to see the whole page and it actually seems more like reading a paper magazine. I didn't subscribe to any magazines on the smaller one, but I will now. It will be so nice not to have magazines piling up and having to recycle them. It's great for reading books as well. And the high definition screen really makes quite a difference. I thought the old one was plenty sharp, but there was a noticeable difference as soon as I turned it on.This is the first Kindle I've owned that has Bluetooth. I buy all my music from Amazon these days and I have lots of playlists so it's really nice to be able to stream them from the cloud and connect to a portable speaker such as this: Satechi BT Touch Wireless Portable Bluetooth Hands-free Speaker System for iPhone / Android Smart Phones / iPad / Tablets / Macbook / Notebooks. Pairing is simple, just like connecting to our home wifi network was. It recognized the network right away, asked for a password, and connected right up. All of my Kindle content from my other Kindles showed up and was available for download. The wifi speed seems faster than my older Kindle.Another thing that is different on this Kindle is that the speakers are on the back. I'm not sure that I like that. It can be a bit of a problem when you use a cover such as this one: Verso \"Profile\" Standing Cover for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", Black (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 8.9\") that covers the back. I can still hear it pretty well, but it sounds a bit muffled. The sound is stereo and sounds decent with the cover off. I often listen with headphones anyway and there is a port on the top to plug them in.Movies are beautiful with the high definition bigger screen. And there are more movies every day with Amazon Instant Video. And with an Amazon Prime account there are a lot of them as well as TV shows that are free to watch. The battery life is long enough that you can watch a couple of movies before recharging. Youtube is more fun to watch on this model also.I'm very happy with this new Kindle and love all the improvements.

I am a huge Apple fan, or have been in the past.  I have owned every iphone since the 3G, owned an Ipad 3 (first retina ipad) for 30 days before returning it, for reasons I will explain shortly.  I also have an Ipad in the home, as my live-in girlfriend has the Ipad 3rd generation with retina display.  I also owned the Original Kindle Fire which I won in a contest at work.On to the reasoning on why I have never personally owned an Ipad for longer than 30 days, which is important because this product is not for everyone.First, let me say I believe the Ipad is the best tablet on the market.  Meaning, if someone came up to me, with every tablet on the market, and said pick one for free, I would choose the Ipad with no hesitation.  However, like most people, money is a consideration.  If money is no issue to you, buy an Ipad.  It has the 2nd best screen (behind the Android Nexus 10), the most fluid/elegant user interface, the best app ecosystem, and a premium build.  Also, Apple is a great company with outstanding customer service (and physical retail locations), there are a wide variety of accessories available, and it will integrate seamlessly with your other apple products (like my iphone).  Apple products just work, they're nice to look at, and they maintain a high resale value.That said, money is an issue for me, specifically value, or bang for my buck.  My tablet needs boil down to only those things which are inconvenient/difficult to do on my smartphone (which I always have with me) or my laptop (which is for WORK/productivity).  Specifically, reading books, watching video, and surfing the web.  Those are the BIG 3 for me!  I don't have any desire to play games (I can do that on my phone, but mainly I enjoy console gaming).  I don't care that much about apps other than the major ones which are usually on all app ecosystems.  The only apps I care about are those that deal with one of those big 3 of reading, watching, and surfing - where the screen size of a tablet is much preferred over that of a phone.  However, I didn't want to pay $500+ for just those 3 things!Out of the box, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 does 2 of those 3 things as good as an Ipad.  Reading and Watching video are at least as good on the Fire as the iPad.  The one area it's lacking is web surfing, as Silk consistently (in my experience) slows down, stutters and sometimes crashes. This has been my experience with Silk on 2 separate Fire 8.9's (I got a replacement due to a scratch in my original screen).  This was almost enough to make me want to return it, BUT with a little research you can download an alternate browser such as Google Chrome or Dolphin which make the web surfing experience about on par with an Ipad, and with Flash!Another Huge bonus is Kindle Freetime Unlimited.  Anyone with a young child will appreciate this.  I want to allow my child to use my tablet, but I don't want her to have complete freedom to surf the web and have access to my apps, books, music, etc.  Kindle Freetime allows an entirely separate \"area\" for your children, where you set the parameters of what you want them to be able to access!  This is a wonderful feature!There are two other nice advantages this tablet has over the iPad:  Comfort and Sound.  This tablet is more comfortable to hold than an iPad.  It's lighter & has rounded softer edges as opposed to the sharp metallic edges on an Ipad..  This is HUGE, especially to someone like me who likes to use it in bed, or hold it for long periods of time while reading a book, watching a movie, etc.  The sound is not great, but it's very very good for a tablet.  It is louder than an ipad and has stereo speakers (Ipad is mono).Who would I not recommend this to?  Like I said earlier, if money is no object, you may opt for an iPad.  If style/looks/build, quality/quantity of apps, and the fluidity/elegance of the user interface are at the top of your list, an iPad may suit you better.  Everything works/moves/flows so well on an Ipad, the menus are elegant, everything is intuitive.  There are more apps, and many of the apps available on both Ipad and Kindle are of a higher quality on the Ipad.My Girlfriend cares about how her gadgets look, loves playing games and discovering new apps, and loves the fluidity, intuitiveness, and elegance of the ipad interface.  For her Ipad is the answer.For ME and my needs, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is the best value on the market.  I got it for $249 (half the price of an Ipad!) and it does the things I care about just as well as an Ipad, with some added bonuses!

The volume buttons are hard to find and use, and occasionally, I've accidentally hit the power button when holding the sides to play games.3) The user interface is not the most responsive, and rather tricky to navigate. For example, the touch screen is not as intuitive and has, at times, required repeated attempts on my part. This is not a consistent problem, however.4) No Flash. Now I know this has been mentioned on Amazon's Kindle info page, but it's not made very clear. This is a big deal to me as there are flash video files that I like to watch. I was forced to install the Dolphin browser, which is slower than Silk, and then add Flash (all of this required a file manager installation as well) and, after all that, the files crash during playback. I can't tell whether this is the fault of the Kindle or Dolphin, but it's a big loss.5) The Kindle has frozen or crashed on a couple of occasions, usually while playing games.  Overall, it's not been a consistent problem, however.6) As others have mentioned, you will feel the limitations of available apps frustrating at times.7) Not as satisfying if you're not a Prime MemberPros:1) The speed is noticeably fast, and the HD graphics overall works great.2) Video from Amazon and other apps (not using Flash, of course) plays like a dream. I've been checking out \"West Wing\" from Amazon Instant Video and I've not had any issues.3) Lots of great cheap/free reading, especially the classics. And as a reader, it works well.Sum:This is my first tablet, and I had to decide what I wanted one for, and whether it was worth paying 2x the price for the Apple iPad, as price was a factor (I bought this product for $250).  As my needs were mostly recreational (games, video, music, reading, some surfing) I'm satisfied with the Kindle Fire 8.9.", "Title": "Complaints about the battery life, usability design, no Flash, and app limitations, but still pleased overall", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "C.

While the Kindle fire was great (wth a few annoying issues) but I ended up selling it. mainly because I wanted  something bigger. and whle the kindle fire hd is pretty much the ame equipment as the 8.9 except for the larger screen, there are a few major differences. One is blutooth. I never understood why the orginal kindle fire did not have this feature. I didn't watch movies on my old one bcause I'd have to listen through corded headphones. If you are out and about, say at a train station or airport you want felxibility. This one has that. but you can buy a kickstand case and then listen to movie with a blutooth headset. I really wanted that feature on my old one, but amazon didn't just upgrade this device incrementally, they basically started from the beginning. You get blutooth and a forward facing camera along with book features like xray. The only negative thing is my covers do not show up on the carousel (it's hit or miss for the actual books I have) However they show up in the book section. I used calibre to side load books bought previously or belonged to other readers.I id try out the Nook tablet and I was greatly disappinted (Ihaven't seen or worked with their hd version. That was based on the color/touch screen version. That one didn't hang around long, but about that time i heard of the kindle fire HD coming out. and me being the nerd that I am had to get the one with more storage and blutooth features (I have a $90 set of headphones so combined with the the Kindle fire hd itself, it all works out great. The video quality is great and I was really impressed by the sound out of the speakers The stereo speakers was a great touch.I have never owned any other tablets except for nook and fire, so I can't say much about the ipad though I've played with one before. pretty much I have seen/touched most of the tablets and the fire is not only affordable (well compared to what you are getting) and has everything I need right now.I am really impressed by this reader. So there isn't much need to go for the bigger/more expensive tablets. Besides some actually act more like a laptop so if you want something with a good size screen that's more portable then this is the way to go. While my device has no adds under the carousel if you are to highlight something (let's just say an app)then it shows \"recommended for you\" and while this is a petty gripe I think since i didn't pay for the adds, then I shouldn't be getting those either.But overall it's a great device looks/sounds wonderful.and with the 8.9 screen you get more breathing room and a better showcase for your movies etc. This one does come with a a sync cable which the orginal fire didn't. There is no wall charger by the way. But amazon probably has one for  a good price. Right now I don't need it though.  So that's fine with me at least for now.  It's pretty easy to learn, and also if you buy certain marked cds through amazon marketplace they will rip it to the cloud for you (another great service) And it doesn't count towards your alloted storage limit. so that way if you are connected  t wi-fi you can listen to your online collection which is a definite plus.there isn't much left to say really.

It still works.  I love it.  Problem is I hate having to read by flashlight so I don't wake the Wifey.So, I bought this one.  I was going to go with the 7\" but the Wifey said, \"Might as well get the newest one.\"  She's usually right about everything and so I went with her suggestion.  She was right,  Of course.I unboxed this thing and Wallah! I was super psyched.  The thing runs flawlessly.  There were a pretty good amount of apps in the app store and I was even able to dim the brightness and make the book pages sepia, much easier on the eyes for me.Netflix literally zoomed 1080p hd and delivered impressive sound from the side/rear mounted speakers.  Very impressive.  Especially with our internet speed... I can't talk about that it makes me want to cry...I installed all the essential apps that I could find and there is where I hit my first snag.  There were a bunch off android apps that I really like to use that aren't available in the Amazon App Store.  So I looked around and there was a setting to allow 3rd party Apps but it doesn't really give you access to the great android apps or the apps on Google Play.  I don't know why they nerfed the OS like this but most likely it was to make more money. I'm hoping in the future they allow us more freedom to choose the apps we want from where we want them. C'est la vie.My second point of contention is the Mini HDMI port.  I have a couple devices that use the mini to large cables and they are both the same.  The port on the Kindle is tiny and weird and so I will have to fork out about 6 bucks for one which isn't a big deal, I just wish they would have let me know it was going to be proprietary so I could have ordered it at the same time.(It's a micro HDMI type D to HDMI Type A... just to save you the hassle of trying to figure it out.)Finally, the Kindle Quick Charger.  Another way to squeeze a couple bucks out of you.  Luckily I already had a wall socket usb quick charger so it's not a big deal.  However for those who don't happen to have one and opt out on the Kindle Quick Charger there is this caveat!((Dramatic pause of silence))It charges in under fourteen hours from your computers usb port.  Wait did that say 14 hours?  The battery life is 10 hours.  I may not have a doctorate in math but something just doesn't add up there.Still over all I give this 5 stars.

The answer is YES.This is my 2nd kindle. The first was the KindleFire sold in USA November 2011.Both are good tablets. They each come with excellent customer support and a healthy customer knowledge base.Improvements: the AC adapter. The older adapter was beginning to fail on some first gen. KindleFire. Overtime the connection from cord to machine becomes fussy. The metal connector is small prone to dust, temp, etc. If one could not get the connector to properly sit within the KindleFire. The machine would not get charged.Now a two part charger is the norm (sold separately) it is similar to a dual ended wire. The small end goes to the kindle the large end goes to the AC wall plug.Considering the number of first gen KindleFire to lose ground because of traditional AC adapter. This is a welcome Improvement.

I wanted something that I could use to take notes in class, and use for textbooks. I also bought the otterbox defender for the Kindle. When the box showed up with both items the Kindle went straight into the Otterbox. Initially I had trouble using a stylus with the Otterbox, but that has resolved itself. There are several note taking apps that downloaded, and I'm still working out which one I like best. But, this is for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 so here goes:The Kindle itself:WOW! The graphics are amazing. I've seen other tablets around campus, and this one is by far the best looking. Not by a little, I mean noticeably better.I bought the non-4G version with special offers. I have access to wireless anywhere on campus, at home etc so I don't need 4G. YMMV. Regarding the special offers: I don't find them annoying or intrusive in any way. Matter of fact, I've found that the more I use it the better Amazon is at predicting what may interest me. I went from just ignoring them on the start screen to actually glancing at them to see if it's something I want.The key is that if I'm not interested it takes less time to just continue on than it does to think about it. So, for me, it's not even worth the $15 extra to do away with the offers.The performance is good. I have had a few times that it's been slow when doing something on the net, but that's a function of the campus network. Whenever I have full wireless service bars it's just plain fast.Movies....What can I say, they work well, and the picture is outstanding and the sound is great.  I haven't used the HDMI out, so I can't comment on that.Books: Nothing short of excellent. Easy to see, easy to customize the view, easy to purchase.Websurfing: Not the best, mostly due to Silk (the native browser). It works, mostly well. The biggest problem I have is with drop-down menus on the web. Silk is not good at that. Oh and it won't do Flash player either. Searching the web there is a way to do it, but not using Silk. When I get around to downloading another browser I'll update this.The biggest negative that I've run into so far is that I have a hard time keeping it. The wife and kids seem to think it's great for playing games. Don't they know this is a serious tool?! Actually, the wife has decided that if I don't give her this one then she's buying one for herself.There are plenty of options now for tablets, and this market section is growing exponentially so by this time next year I expect this will be out of date.

I've almost stopped buying paperback books completely. I finally felt it was time to upgrade. There were a few things I specifically wanted in a tablet.  I wanted apps such as netflix, and gmail, facebook, youtube, etc. I wanted to be able to read my kindle books, and watch my prime videos on amazon. Because my tablet is primarily for entertainment purposes getting the kindle was a no-brainer. I did some research on other tablets that had more customization and more options, but finally settled on the kindle because it does everything I want for a much better price.  Knowing that bias, now on to my review:VIDEOS:This device is amazing for videos. Especially ones that run in HD are exceptional. The screen is crystal clear and almost perfect. I say almost because there is so glare especially in bright light. For me, I do most of my movie/tv watching at night or in my dark bedroom with its heavy curtains, so this isn't usually a problem. But once or twice I have tried watching shows in the living room during the day, and if the sun is shining right in the windows, I can see more of my reflected face (especially in dark scenes) then I can of the movie. Again, this is only in almost direct sun. In softer light, or lower light, it isn't an issue, and even when it is you can usually find an angle that works. It is a small annoyance for me, but one that might be a bigger annoyance for someone who does a lot of video watching in bright light.READING:The screen for reading books is very bright, which I like. It can be turned down, or even switched to white on black. I have little problem reading even in bright sun. I am especially in love with how easy it is to highlight and make notes in the text.  I also have a copy of the OED on my kindle, so I can jump right to that from whatever book I am reading if I need a full definition of a word, which is amazing and has helped me out with some of my college classes. I've also tried reading some magazines and comic books which look amazing. DC comics recent reset some of their comics and I started reading the new Batman comics. The pages are pretty clear, and if you need to you can zoom in on panels to marvel at the artwork or read smaller writing. I might, when I can afford to, look into getting a magazine subscription like national geographic or something, just to see what that is like, but the few free ones I've tried look nice.APPS:My primary apps are Gmail, Facebook, Netflix, Skype, and Adobe Reader (for classes). These all work just fine on the kindle. I guess Youtube isn't available but there are ways to get it. I don't use it that often, and don't mind going to the website on the rare occasions I do, which works fine. Skype works pretty well, though it does get a little weird if you happen to adjust the kindle so the screen flips. It's just a small blip. Facebook, Gmail and Netflix all work perfectly, though I greatly prefer amazon videos to netflix, the amazon viewer just seems nicer and the videos look nicer.GAMES:I don't play a lot of games. I play words with friends now and then, but I did try out a couple of the more advanced graphic games such as the Sims game and Dungeon Hunter, both of which run without a problem and look amazing.SOUND:The sound on this thing is amazing. The case does change it a bit, but not drastically. I hardly use headphones with it because I most often use it alone at home. I don't even need it at full volume to hear it perfectly. It sounds as good as any TV.BATTERY:I had to go to the hospital when my sister was having her baby, and I spent all day, almost twelve hours, hanging out in the waiting room with nothing but my kindle. The battery held up well for just reading, but I didn't watch any videos because those do drain the battery quicker and I didn't want to run out. However, I can usually watch 3-4 hours of hd video before I get a notification to plug in my kindle. Which makes sense, things that use more power to run (videos, games) drain the battery faster than just reading.  It holds up well on tuesdays which are the days I spend almost all day on campus using it in class for web-searches or reading pdfs in the adobe app. I've never had it run out of battery when I need it, though I usually have to plug it in each night. It does take a long time to charge, even when plugged into the wall.OTHER THOUGHTS:Being less customizable than even a smart phone is a bit of a draw back. I wouldn't mind being able to set a background picture like I can on my android phone, for example. Or have a screen of apps like you can on most tablets.  While the carousel is convenient for getting to my things, I don't like that if I use something once it automatically goes to my carousel, like every time a view a webpage it is there at the front of my carousel and I have to remove it, because each new thing I try pushes the things I use most often back so I have to scroll over to it. Also, for some reason Facebook is constantly moving down to the end of the carousel even though I use it a lot. It gets shoved behind things I don't even use, which is weird. I'm always having to scroll over to find facebook.I purchased the $45 case that goes with this and don't regret it. I couldn't have lived without it. the kindle on its own without a case I fear too much for it getting broken or scratched. The case is amazing, I can stand it up and watch tv or read while I'm cooking or cleaning. and I feel safe putting it in my bag with my books and notebooks with the hard case. So I recommend it to anyone who gets the kindle, it is a bit expensive but it is a must-have.Also, a side-note about smudges. The screen smudges something awful. I've taken to carrying a cloth with me for cleaning the screen regularly. It is a must. But it really can't be helped.The kindle isn't perfect. But it is perfect for me. It does everything I need it to, and it does it beautifully. I can see it not being for everyone, especially someone who is looking for a tablet that can serve almost as a laptop replacement for the office.

I have a MacMini at home connected to my TV for movies (Amazon Prime Video mostly), music, Hulu, etc.  My wife also has an Air & an iPhone, my oldest son has an Air & iPhone, and my two youngest have iPad 2's.  We are big users of the iCloud, particularly the calendar - it's the only way we keep things straight.  So, we are ***deep*** into the Apple ecosystem (cult?).  We also use Amazon quite a bit - goods, food, video, music, etc.  We're Amazon Prime members too.  And I use Google services all the time (maps, Drive, Google+, Reader, etc.), both for work and home.So when I started looking at tablets for myself - something I could use while I workout, go on trips with, etc. - all three ecosystems (Apple, Amazon, & Google) were 'on the table'.  I looked at the iPad Mini, the Nexus 7, and the Kindle HD 7.  There were things I liked & disliked for each.iPad Mini:  Pro: iCloud support for my calendar & contacts, can watch Amazon Prime Video, can access Apps written by Google  Con: kinda expensive, can't use the Kindle lending libraryGoogle Nexus 7:  Pro: can access Google Play Apps, nice price  Con: can't watch Amazon Prime video (without rooting?), can't use the Kindle lending library, can't access iCloudKindle Fire HD 7:  Pro: can watch Amazon Prime Video, can use the Kindle lending library, nice price  Con: can't access iCloud, can't access Google PlayNone were perfect, so I didn't buy any.  But my wonderful wife bought me the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 for Christmas (on that sale day that it was $249).  I've been playing with it daily for almost a month now, and I have to say I like it a lot.  It's got a great screen, nice sounding speakers, decent battery life, nice industrial design - it's nice to hold (though I do find it difficult to find the on/off button).  I use it in the following manner: - Amazon Video while I spin - Kindle lending library & Overdrive for reading books - Internet news (via Dolphin browser, which I prefer to Silk) - Google reader & Google+ via browser only (those Google Apps aren't available) - Words with friends - email, but just a little bit - at home only, not at workThere are some things it doesn't do well, like calendar (can't access iCloud), and the email program isn't great.  And it's frustrating to me that I can't access Google Play even though it's Android.  (I have used 1mobile.com to sideload some apps, like the Dolphin browser.)  But I knew those cons going into it.All in all, I'm glad to have it, it's a great interface to the Amazon ecosystem (which is both its strength & weakness).", "Title": "Kindle Fire HD 8.9 from an Apple's guy view", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "Shannon Curran", "ReviewID": "R35MVRWDA26667", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I initially bought it for myself, but my husband is enjoying just as much as I am.

Image size on 8.9 are not much bigger than the (1st gen) old 7\"--only 1\" more due to wide margins on the sides of the screen.  Definitely don't get the new (HD) 7\" if you can get the old 7\" because the screen on the old one is more proportional for movies or if you want to watch videos on websites.If people get the HD, then 8.9 is better if one can afford it. The good things about the HD version is that the sound is better as the surround sound is noticeable, HD video does look HD, and it can be connected to the television through a purchased HDMI cable (not an option on the old or HDX version).  Other than those few things, the functionality are similar on the old and the new HD Kindle Fires.On my HD Fire, it occasionally had problems downloading or streaming videos from my Amazon account. The cursor would spin and spin until I leave a few times from the video and return later to play it again. This could be because of a slower speed on my internet.  With HD, you do want higher memory storage and Internet speed to run 100% smoothly.I think if you never owned the 1st generation Kindle Fire, this 8.9\" HD would seem like it is an amazing technology as it has a smooth look and feel. I would have probably given this a 4 or 5 stars if this was my first Kindle Fire.  However, for those of us who owned the 1st generation Kindle Fire, by comparison, we are not as impressed by the upgrades because though there were improvements, Amazon also took away some of the good stuff that the old version had in its system including physical components such as button locations and charging light, etc.", "Title": "Go with 8.9\" HD for surround sound, HD videos and tv connectivity, but stick with 1st gen Kindle Fire for internet videos", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "candi", "ReviewID": "R3OYSQQCMJ5115", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can I say... I LOVE the Kindle Fire. I am a fan 100%. The Kindle Fire HD 8.9  is my second one. I started with the original 1st generation when it first came out. Since then, I've upgraded  to this one. It's fantastic, as usual,  the hd is beautiful, the graphics, colors, and clarity. There are quite a few different features. There's Skype; more speakers for better sound quality. And there's a different look here and there. Amazon keeps making them better and better.***UPDATE: Do not get discouraged and ditch this device or any new kindle fires, because there's no flash player. ALL TABLETS do not have it, including iPads. Adobe is to blame for this not Amazon or any other company. Adobe has pulled the plug on installing flash on all phones and all tablets. They are sticking only to computers. Now, the beauty of these tablets (the Kindle fires) is that they are ANDROID, people.:) There's a remedy for that. So, don't hate the Kindle Fire. Since, we are all one kindle fire family, here goes: (1). Go to settings, device, allow installation of outside applications select \"yes\". (2). Download from the Amazon Appstore Es File Explorer (3). Go to the web and search - download dolphin browser. (4). Then using dolphin browser search - download Adobe flash player 11. (5). If needed go to Es File Explorer, go to downloads and install from there. That's it. Now you should have flash player. However, to use the flash player you need to use the dolphin browser because it will not work on the Kindle fire's Silk browser.

I had wanted to upgrade to a larger tablet and had considered an Ipad.  The deciding factor for me was the 30 dollar price break.  I take nothing away from the Ipad but for how I use my tablet I just couldn't justify the price difference.  First let me say I have one big gripe about this version and that is the lack of a charging light that shows you when the tablet is charging and has completely charged.  I'm not sure why this was not included on this version but I do wish it was.  Now for the good, if not great for me.  Let's start with the picture...wow the first time I booted it up I was stunned at the clarity.  HD content looks great, crystal clear.  The most amazing thing is the sound.  I'm not sure how they managed to get such great sound out of such a small speaker.  I was watching an HBO special and the sound absolutely stunned me.  Now mind you it's not a home theater system but it really adds to the viewing experience much more than I would have ever imagined was possible in a tablet.  The device feels solid and is very striking.  I haven't decided on which case I am going to get quite yet, just being careful with it for now.  The ease of transferring all of my data also was impressive.  Once I received it, just plug in my wifi password and away I went.  I know many have griped about no charger, I already had several from my others so it wasn't a big deal for me.  I haven't tried out the micro hdmi output but am anxious to do so.

(unless you're going the CLOUD route, then disregard this)Skype works well! Though they can't see you while you do other things on the Kindle at the same time. And i do have a constant issue with calling someone, and it says call went through but it ended. It's wierd but not frustrating enough. (I must be getting used to SKype)Solid build, no warping or flimsy materials. The buttons feel like they'll be working for some years.The glass! (Look, it's perfectly transparent. It can also take on a days worth of ... fingering... and it STILL shows a stunning picture of an HD movie or high res pic.)

I've used it nearly all day with brightness on full. and nowhere near hot enough to even feel like it's heating up. I love it. My phone heats up WAY more than the kindle under similar conditions of use.OH! UPDATING when i first received it and turned it on: took about 20min. Coming from a PS3 user, this is super speedy!CONS: the charging. Man this thing takes A LONG TIME to fully charge. Though it is smart about WHEN it charges. You can plug it in and depending on what you do, it may or may not charge during that particular action. You can scroll through your carousel and it'd be green battery indicator. Meaning it's charging, but as soon as something uses the WiFi, it stops. As soon as it stop using wiFi, it goes right back to charging.OVERALL: Worth the purchase, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE research what you NEED from your tablet/ebook, and you won't be wrong if KINDLE Fire HD 8.9 is maybe what you're looking for.#####UPDATE#######After a week of use,I have to say I do not regret getting this instead of a true tablet or netbook or even a laptop.The charging situation was rectified by getting a charger USB box.

I'm a big Amazon fan, but I like having access to the greater number of apps available to the Nexus. But what tilted me in the Kindle's favor was getting 2 Amazon gift cards for $100 each, for early Christmas presents. I'd only have to shell out $169. The Google Nexus 10 with 32 GB was $499 and I wasn't willing to go that high, so I bought the 8.9 with 32 GB. I researched both units thoroughly and knew that I better order a charger to save $10 and I picked up the CaseCrown Ridge Standby case for about $15 with shipping CaseCrown Ridge Standby Case (Blue) for Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9 Inch (Built-in magnet for sleep / wake feature)  along with a 3-pack of cheap screen protectors. So many people complain that the Kindle arrives sans charger. Does anybody read product descriptions?Since I had read so many reviews about the new Kindles not having Adobe Flash, I immediately remedied that by finding it online, along with a suitable version of the Dolphin Browser, which negated the Silk Browser's shortcomings. I'm not much of a game player so those apps were unimportant to me. What I do miss in the apps realm, is the Time-Warner TV app, which can turn a tablet into a little wireless flat-screen to watch your cable TV.  I found an older version and installed it, but it wanted to upgrade to the latest version to work, and took me to the Google store, so I struck out on that. I suspect that down the road, the Time Warner TV app will be added to the Amazon App store, as well as a few others, that people deem critical to their enjoyment. Patience is a virtue in this area!This Kindle has an excellent screen and the Dolby Sound is an added bonus! I've watched Netflix material in bed with the Kindle tilted on its case and I swear that the audio creates a virtual 3-dimensional field ...it's great! Netflix material looks better on the Kindle than my 55\" TV!  The CaseCrown cover has a built-in magnet that turns the unit on and off, so you don't have to find the On-Off button, a great convenience! The Kindle 8.9 also a great e-reader, and with having a Touch and original Kindle Fire, there's always reading material close by.

The physical construction of both is quite good, although I find the smaller Fire much easier to move around with, and I like its implementation of the Starter page for the Web browser infinitely better than that of the HD, which sticks one with a bunch of crappy \"Selected\" sites that apparently pay Amazon to stick links on your screen that you have zero control over, and a bunch more of \"Trending\" stuff that I would love to disable. I would really like to have MY Selected sites (favorites) displayed on screen in lieu of Amazon's, and perhaps more of my recent history.  However, two thirds of the screen is consumed by the Amazon-imposed links.  I also miss the externally viewable LED indication of \"Fully Charged/Charging\" status...if the HD is turned off, I have to turn it on to see if it is charged, which seems a bit regressive in terms of human design.  However, the addition of an external volume control with the HD implementation is quite helpful.  As for the power button, I like the Fire's better because of instant feedback, where with the HD I just have to wait to see if I depressed it far enough.  That a minor annoyance, at most, but one designers may want to look at in the future,As I noted, the physical quality of the units is excellent, so my beefs are with the software/firmware limitations.  My major grouse is the intentional blocking of apps that run fine on other Androids, but apparently Amazon has crippled their version so that it will accept only apps obtained via Amazon.  Worse yet, some apps that would run on the Fire won't run on the Fire HD.  Let me state now that if one is technically proficient and determined, one can often \"sideload\" apps not approved by Amazon which work fine...in fact, I routinely use a browser on my HD that I find more responsive than Amazon's and it displays what I want displayed, not what Amazon selects for me, plus I can watch webcasts and similar videos which apparently Amazon hasn't figured out how to handle since Adobe refused to support Flash Player on Android. I understand the desire to control what is loaded, but some of their protection is clearly self-serving, and not about users at all (at least in my opinion).  So here is the important take-away from this:  If you are willing to live exclusively in a world where Amazon dictates what is available to you, you'll love the unit.  Otherwise, get ready to live without some really useful apps or to take the risk of running them down on the net and side-loading them (some of which can indeed booger up your system).By the way, for those grousing about the power charging unit not being included, that is clear in the material and ordering process. Since some people already have several adequate charging modules, and since Amazon cuts you a deal when you order if you don't already have one, that's just not a legitimate gripe!  After all, why should those who don't need a charger have to buy one anyway?However, when one pays to avoid advertising content, only to have it imposed on the start page of the browser in terms of \"Selected\" internet sites not controlled by the user, I feel that I have been had.  However, as stated above, I don't necessarily use their browser that much anyway, so what the heck!  It is just so dishonest!If I buy another tablet, it will absolutely be a tablet upon which I can load whatever I want to load so long as it is written for Android, so it will likely not be another Amazon product, unless they alter course considerably.  Of course, they make their choices, and we all have to ultimately make ours.  Just be fully informed, check out some online demo's or evaluations and/or check out a friend's before you buy.", "Title": "Good if you never want anything but Amazon stuff", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Author": "taw", "ReviewID": "R16I64A9SAVD8J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been a huge amazon fan for a long time. So when I was looking around for a tablet or reader my first thought obviously went to amazon.  The quality of the actual kindle is great. And I had been aware before I purchased it that I wouldn't have access to google play apps(which seems very odd since my google phone goes out of its way to promote amazon). That said I expected amazon to have at least comparable app's. Much to my surprise I can't get my local bank app,  groupon which has my local discounts, nor can I  get my local news app just to name a few. Very disappointed in the app selection offered, every time I open the page it looks like it's set up for a 6 or 8 year old.I also have a lot of issues with connectivity to WiFi even at home.

Elmore", "ReviewID": "R1H44HTPSIK1MY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I sew a lot, so I keep movies and tv shows streaming on my computer for entertainment. I'm also read a lot. I also buy a lot of music. All of these things have Amazon in common.  I am a good customer.  So since my computer was suffering under the weight of all of those downloaded files and since I was getting the blue screen of death about once a week, I decided to take action.I researched and looked for a solution.My thinking: if I could get a tablet that could take the Amazon content off my computer, I might be able to extend the life of my laptop.  I looked at the Microsoft Surface and the Amazon Kindle seriously. I read all of the reviews, I put out messages to friends who have one or the other, I asked questions.  In the end, mostly because of price and ties to Amazon, I opted to get the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\".  Since most of my online activity includes Amazon, I thought it would be the better purchase.My first complaint is about the shipping service. I am a Prime customer. I deserve better shipping than what I got.  Now, I do have many of my Amazon purchases sent to a PO Box.  I know, how un-American of me, but I don't live in a sweet little neighborhood with mailboxes out front. I live in the wild west with directions to houses that go something like this: Go five miles out and take the only road that you see left. Go another 2.56 miles and when you see the bush on the left, turn right.  Now, the UPS driver that serves our area knows all of us. He knows where we live, he knows where we work, he knows our children and where they work. He knows if he can get down our road if it rains, he knows who our friends are and where he can leave it if our road is impassable.  Fed Ex sends a different driver almost every time. Packages get lost or left with the wrong person. No worries. They signed for it!!  Now, if you were me, would you have your expensive Kindle purchase sent to your house or would you go ahead and have it sent to your PO Box.  Most people can find the post office. Even FedEx.  My Kindle sat at the FedEX facility in a large city in my state for 36 hours!!!  There is no excuse for that.  The post office does have expedited shipping, why can't Amazon use that?  Or let me have the choice between UPS and FedEX on everything that I purchase. That would be great and worth the $79 that I spend every year to enjoy Prime shipping.Right out of the box, I could have used a manual.  I'm not stupid and I'm not of the \"no tech\" generation.  I'm of the \"it's passing me by\" generation.  The little iphone sized card called \"Getting Started\" isn't very informative. I found the on/off button and the volume.  I found the USB charger outlet thing. That mini USB connection feels so fragile. I miss the big ones. They at least felt like you could plug it in and not be damaging it.  The cord and the connector are stiff and I'm really worried that I'll mess those pins up when I plug it in.  I don't care for fragile things.  I like things with a more substantial feel.So, I finally get my Kindle.  Being so rural, I admit that my internet options are limited. But, I chatted online with someone from Amazon about the Kindle and the possibility that the internet wouldn't work.  It does work, but it doesn't work like Amazon said it would. I said that I have DSL. I didn't hide anything. Internet reception is just ok.  If you live in a really rural area and you have to rely on DSL, it is going to be slow.  The Kindle will stream a little less well than streaming on your computer. It won't get better. You've been warned.Next, I have had a few electronic devices. I was a technology geek for awhile, but just got tired of trying to keep up. So, I know some things and haven't a clue about others.  Here is something I do know. Screens need to be calibrated.  If Kindle has a way to calibrate screens, I haven't found it.  Another good topic for a manual.  The reason I say this is because when I try to move a book off of my device or from the carousel, I'm supposed to be able to put my finger on the image and hold. After holding, a menu pops up and says, \"remove from device, or carousel\" depending upon which screen you are in.  This is the most frustrating procedure!! Six, eight times I placed my finger and hold and the image just shivers and there is no menu.  And typing a help message to the Kindle crew was a disaster. The space bar wouldn't engage and if I wanted to move the cursor, I couldn't move it with a key, I had to place my finger on the message in the approximate position and  hold. It took me 30 minutes to type a simple help message of 5 lines.  The screen needs to be calibrated.Next, my audible books didn't transfer.  I had my audible account long before Amazon bought them, so my passwords were not synced.  Last night, when I tried to use the help, I got a \"contact us\" (the awful email). This morning when I looked I got an explanation.  I changed my audible account in order to use my Amazon credentials.  Still nothing. There is no way, that I can find, that will let my Kindle know that I've made the changes.  Help search was no help and this would be a good time for a manual.  I still have had no word from the help team at Amazon.  I also had trouble with my email account, but that did work itself our this morning.Finally, as I'm checking out all of the features, I went into books.  I downloaded several books and went exploring.  I went into my ESV Bible hoping that I could take my Kindle to church (larger fonts).  I could not figure out how to move around in the book.  Once you are in it, any book, all of the options, like the back arrow and the home button disappear.  Okay, maybe you access those buttons like the settings, you pull down with your finger from the top, right? No.  I completely stumbled on tapping the book to get the options back.  Manual. Or at least another little iphone sized card with helpful hints.  Good Grief.By this time, I'm pretty frustrated. I'm happy that I saved my boxes and that I opened everything carefully.After sleeping on it, I got up this morning to take another look. I did get my email account on, but I still don't have access to my Audible account. I can access Prime Instant video and it will stream. Until the buffer is full, it pauses about every 30 seconds.  I pause at the beginning and then once it buffers, I watch.  But that dual antenna thing doesn't work in rural areas.  That was the main question that I asked, and I always got the same answer: If you can stream on your computer, you can stream on a Kindle. True, but you neglected to mention that it doesn't stream AS WELL.What do I like?The picture and the video are good.The sound is good.I like the fact that I can move content from Kindle to Cloud and back again.  That feature on the PC versions of Kindle and Unbox would have been very helpful and I wouldn't have found myself in that original predicament.  Anyway, I'm glad to have that ability. That is probably THE reason that I won't return this to Amazon.The core stuff that the Kindle is meant to do...works.I uninstalled Unbox off of my computer this morning and regained 220 GB of space. My computer already runs a little better.Bottom line: After taking some time with the Kindle Fire, I'll keep it.  I think that it will do what I wanted it to do. It will take over my Amazon content. I can do my browsing on it. I don't go that many places.  I can't watch hulu because I don't have a hulu plus membership and I can't watch anything on CBS, but I can still do that on my computer.  I'm going to reserve judgement about whether I'd buy the Kindle again. Maybe in time, I'll love it or at least like it better.`", "Title": "I can't believe after all of the research that I did, I don't like it.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Author": "judith wallace", "ReviewID": "R1XYS4NJZ61159", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very excited when I got my first kindle as a gift from my husband.

In fact, it won so convincingly that I'm not sure how much use I'll have of my Fire HD in the future since my husband will be \"borrowing\" it frequently (that's why I keep buying Kindles...mine keep getting purloined by family members.)Storage space: I opted for 32GB, after being consistently frustrated by running up against the 8GB limit on my Kindle Fire (1st gen.) After loading all my apps, music, and desired books, I found myself with 26+GB to spare. (I'd caveat this by saying I only loaded my preferred music, about 300+ songs, and a small selection of my favorite books...after all, I do most of my reading on my Kindle Paperwhite.) If you tend to be selective about the material you put on your Kindle, you may be able to get by on 16GB. If, however, you intend to load lots of videos, 32GB would be the way to go.Wi-Fi vs Wi-Fi + 4G LTE: I opted for Wi-Fi only, in part because the cost of the 4G LTE comes up to about $130. You do get a great deal from AT&T; in the first year and can receive 250MB per month for 12 months for just $50, which is a steal. Unfortunately, after the first year, AT&T;'s typical data rates will apply, which will run about $50 a month for its cheapest package. I would never subscribe for a data package at that rate and I didn't think that paying $180 for just one year of 4G LTE service would be worth it, so I opted for Wi-Fi only. No regrets there. My husband's two iPads (technically, one is my son's) have never needed 4G service either. If, in an emergency, we need 4G access, well, that's what the iPhone is for (not that you can trust its map anymore, but that's a separate issue...)Kindle FreeTime: I don't intend to let my kids use my new Kindle (brave words, hah! Check back with me in a month) but I did experiment with the Kindle FreeTime function, which allows parents to control which apps/books/videos their child gets to use (and you can customize for each child) as well as control the amount of time they get to spend on the Kindle in total, or for each category of product. For example, you can allow them unlimited time with books, a half hour with videos, and a half hour with apps. As a parent, let me say that this is AMAZING. Amazon has also put out Kindle FreeTime Unlimited, a subscription-based service that gives children access to a wide range of videos, books, and apps appropriate to their age for a fairly reasonable price ($2.99 a month per child for an Amazon Prime member.) That seems like a pretty good deal to me.Special offers or no special offers: I paid an extra $15 to have a Kindle without special offers. My Kindle Fire will likely be utilized by children and I didn't want to deal with finding out that my child accidentally purchased a $599 botox session out in California. Amazon really does need to fix its one-click purchasing. I'd like some serious password protection on that ability.Minor gripes: My only real grip is the lack of ability to catalog my books. I think this reason is at least partially responsible for my utilizing a separate Kindle Paperwhite for my primary reading tool (I need reasons to justify my five Kindles, after all). I like my books neatly categorized. There is no such functionality on the Kindle Fire, and my obsessive-compulsive streak gets all twitchy down my spine.In summary, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\u2033 is a fantastic quality compared to its counterparts in Apple, and you get it for an amazingly low price.

Granted, I turn up the volume all the way, but there is zero distortion and the quality of the sound is quite highBattery indicator- I read a lot of reviews before I bought this and many complained there was no battery charge indicator on the tablet. This was obviously corrected by Amazon before I got my tablet because there most certainly IS a battery charging indicator. Granted, there is no light indicator to show when fully charged, but this is not needed.The OS- Many complaints focused on this being a locked down version of Android, can't customize, blah blah. It's true, it is \"locked down\", but everyone should bear in mind so is the IPAD and more so than this tablet. Many complained there was a software glitch in the carousel where you could not remove items, this has obviously been fixed because it works perfectly. In general, I like the carousel and the general operation of the OS. It's super fast and super easy, between the favorites star and the carousel you have pretty much everything you needThe app store- The app store is very good, easy to navigate and purchase. True, they don't have everything, but they have a LOT of thingsThe browser- I had no issues at all with the stock browser, but thought I'd pass this on. There were a great many people saying to use the \"Dolphin\" browser because it was supposed to be a great browser and also because it supported flash so you could work around the \"no flash\" issue. There were tons of remarks about having to \"sideload\" Dolphin and about a million different instructions on doing so. Forget all that. You don't need to do that. You can just download an alternate app store called \"good e reader\", there are excellent instructions on youtube, not that it's really needed, you literally have to change one setting and then you can download it normally, there is nothing strange or exotic required. Once you have this app store, IT has the Dolphin HD browser, flash, and probably a ton of other stuff, I haven't downloaded much else. The point is, you can just download from this appstore, there is no \"sideloading\" shennanigans needed and have the Dolphin Browser. I will say, the Dolphin browser DOES live up to its billing, it's fantastic, I'm glad I downloaded itAmazon ecosystem- amazing, far better than apple's in every regard except number of apps. The music is far superior as are the video offerings. I have watched a bunch of free stuff with my prime membership and it works flawlessly. Shopping directly from amazon for anything else on the planet is super convenient and works flawlesslySize/Shape compared to full sized IPAD: The 8.9 is almost identical to IPAD in Height. The difference is really in the width, the fire HD is narrower than the IPAD, which mostly accounts for it's reduced spec of 8.9 as compared to 9.9. What this really amounts to is the IPAD is much more of a square shape, it's almost like a 4:3 aspect ratio TV. The Fire HD is shaped much more like a modern TV or computer monitor, with a 16:9 ratio. One benefit besides better movie and TV shape that I did not expect is that if you turn the tablet into a \"portrait\" orientation to type, you can type very quickly with both thumbs just like a cellphone.", "Title": "Great tablet with stunning display", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Author": "Dawn Hinesley", "ReviewID": "R1GV8PBM77TJH0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had a number of problems with this version.

I bought it as a viable and inexpensive alternative to the iPad (which I now have but more on that later).  I found it very intuitive and easy to use.  Aesthetically it is very nice, clean and durable, although I don't like the position of the power button nor the position of the power port.  Many times I've accidentally pressed the power button while moving the device and because of where the plug in for the power is I can't set up the Kindle landscape while it's charging.  Within the first week I had a problem with it.  I would be watching something or doing something and it would shutoff.  After referring to the forum I found out the problem was the case.  I called Amazon and their customer service was superb.  They sent me a new case right away with a return shipping label for the defective case and that fixed the problem.  They requested me to ship the defective case back by a certain date or I'd be charged for it ($50).  I actually missed the date which was about a week or two from the date I received it (I know, my fault).  But they still didn't charge me.  In fact, they sent me another notice giving me an extension.  I made the second date and everything was fine.  The Kindle Fire HD was great for watching videos, checking e-mails and reading ebooks.  It wasn't until I tried to watch programs via Comcast.net that I experienced my first problem.  Apparently, Kindle is missing an essential Adobe Flash Player for watching certain things via a web browser.  I think you can download it but I never looked into it much.  It was a bummer but not that big of a deal.  Well, that also affected Youtube viewing, for which there is a terrible app.  So, speaking of apps... that was the true killer.  Kindle has a terrible app selection and some of them don't work well.  Even though Kindle is an Android device it doesn't allow access to the same App market as other Droid devices (I read that it has something to do with not paying Google that extra money).  So Amazon has a slightly different version of a lot of the popular apps and/or it may not have the app at all.  That really sucked.  It was at that point I decided that I'd get the iPad instead.  In summary, I think the Kindle is great if 1.) you're an Amazon Prime member (as I am) or you peruse Amazon.com a lot (as I do) or 2.) you're using it for videos, books and e-mails.  The Kindle is not so good if you are a heavy app user or if you watch things via your browser.****UPDATE*****This is an update per one of the comments (or only comment).  The app I can think of right away that didn't work for me was the Despicable Me Minion game.  Another app I had issues with was Monopoly.

Overall, I am happy with the purchase because it does what it does extremely well...but it doesn't do EVERYTHING!It does everything EXCEPT:1) Replace a camera. The built-in camera is only front-facing, which means it is designed for Skyping or taking photos of your own  face. It is prohibitively annoying to try to photograph anything else, especially if the object has text on it, which will photograph backwards, like a mirror. You will not be able to transfer photos directly from your camera to the Kindle with a PC in between or an expensive eye-fi sd card.2) Because the Kindle doesn't natively support Adobe Flash you'll do a lot of jumping through hoops to view a lot of web content without finding and using external apps. It's rather difficult sometime to upload things from the Kindle to the cloud without a PC in between.3) It has a lot of great apps, but not all Android apps work. There are some workarounds if you're at least a little computer savvy and good at searching the web4) No matter what the hype says, the battery in the 8.9 can't handle the load. It runs down much quicker than the 7\" and takes FOREVER to charge, even with the much hyped special Kindle charger. Lots of crap is going on in the background that you don't realize.

Lately we, the wife and I, were using the iPad 80% of the time, fighting as to who would get iPad.  We decided to get another tablet.  I was using the iPad for reading the daily news and to read books.  After reading reviews, we decided to get a Kindle.  We are both retired in our late 60's, so a large screen was essential.  For most things, the iPad and Kindle HD are comparable.  The iPad has a much bigger selection of apps.  The Kindle is better at downloading books, mainly free books from the library and from the other free book sites.  We do buy an occasional book from Amazon.  All these books can be viewed on the iPad or the other devices.  There are a few Kindle apps not available on the iPad.

It is great as an e-reader and I love that it syncs with the Kindle apps on my other devices (at least most of the time). It is also my first time owning a tablet. I must say that this device is at best disappointing when it comes to any function other than the e-reader. The device itself is pretty glitchy. For example, when you tap on the screen to move the cursor while typing, the cursor only goes to where you tapped about half the time (and that's being generous). The rest of the time it appears where you tapped for a split second and then automatically jumps to another spot in the text field, sometimes clear on the other side of the text field. The Facebook app is incredibly glitchy and in group pages will show the first five posts, but beyond that it's just a gray background with posts shown, but no way to like or comment on the post itself, and no way to click on the post or the author's profile. In these posts the pictures are also not displayed. That is very frustrating since one of the main reasons I bought this device is to use it to buy/sell items in fb buy/sell/trade groups. It is impossible for me to do that since I can't even see what other people are posting. I called Kindle tech support about this two weeks ago and  they said they could not find a fix because it was a previously unknown issue, even though I can see in the Kindle forums where people have been having this exact same problem since at least 2012. I keep getting emails from them saying they have not yet found a fix and are continuing to look into the problem. I doubt it will ever get fixed. The app selection is disappointing also, because of the exclusion of Google based apps, and other fairly common apps in Android and Apple stores. If you plan to use this as a tablet, don't waste your money. A device that is functional solely through the use of it's apps becomes useless when it's apps themselves are not up to speed, and the selection of available apps leaves a lot to be desired. I researched for a long time before making this purchase and thought I was making a wise decision going with the Kindle. I expected it to be fun to use and helpful, but it's been one disappointment after another.

I like the size, thickness and  graphics, but mostly bought this for the larger screen.  I am indifferent about the screensaver ads and the endless recommendations I get with my existing apps, since these apparently allowed me to buy at a discount (advertised as \"Special Offers\").  I see no difference in the upgraded Wi-Fi (the signal dead spots in my house are the same in either model) and the sound (other than a bit more volume).The three things that ARE problematic are the power/volume buttons, the power/HDMI connections and the magnetic on/off switch.1.  The power and volume buttons are located next to each other on one side of the case.  This is more a first world problem, but when using manually turning the device off, it is common to change the volume instead, and if you are manually changing the volume, you can easily turn off the device.  I would have stayed with a software volume control only, like the original.2.  While the display rotates to adjust to the position of the the device, there is still a default position.  For apps like Netflix, this means that the device has to be in the horizontal with the power and hdmi connections at the bottom.  When using a case or propping it up for viewing, this means that you can't have the power or HDMI connected without raising the device up a few inches. I would have run these from the side (like the original) or out the top.  When running multimedia like video, the power doesn't last long enough for a full movie, so a power connection is a must.3.  I bought a case to protect my Kindle since I tend to be hard on my electronics.  There are magnets in the cover that turns the Kindle off when closing.  This is a nice feature with one drawback.  When using the Kindle, I fold the front cover to the back, but since the device is so thin, the magnets turn the Kindle off from the back.  I find myself removing the case more often than not to avoid this.  Since the case is from a secondary vendor, I can't say this is a consistent problem.An additional issue is that some apps I bought for the old Kindle are not compatible with the new one.  I bought Monopoly and Dungeon Hunter 2, to find that they supposedly don't work with the HD version.  There may be others I haven't looked for yet, but this is maddening in that these apps should at least be patched or upgraded, since they are Android tablet apps.  If the rate of app obsolescence is going to be this high with every upgrade, I would advise anyone to be VERY picky about their app purchases from Amazon.One last item is the speakers, which reside somewhat on the sides and wrap to the back.  I found that by cupping the speakers to direct the sound to the front during use improves the volume and quality tremendously.  This isn't possible when using a case.  I assume the position of the speakers is for better sound distribution, specifically when using as a radio or MP3 player, but for movies and games it sucks.I have already given my old Kindle to my daughter, so I can't go back.

I only had 8GB available and with the things I read it didn't take long to fill but anyway...As for picture and sound I'd give them both a 10/10. I haven't had any problems with glares even when I'm outside. I do have a screen protector on mine but even with the screen protector it's still glare free. I'm a huge fan of watching Hulu and Youtube and it streams things perfectly.Books 10/10: What interested me the most in purchasing the HD was the whispersync feature. When you purchase a book it gives you the option to add voice to it for a couple extra dollars. And it turns the book into a professionally read audio book. I do recommend this option because the normal voice that you get without paying the extra couple of dollars is a very robotic GPS type sounding voice. In my opinion I don't mind if I pay a couple of extra bucks if it's a book I'm really looking forward too. The option is entirely up to you but sense I'm a big on books it's something I always consider.Web Browsing 9/10: The only reason I'm not giving this a perfect score is because I wish it had Flash. Yes, it is fast. Almost faster than my laptop but if it had Flash it would make it much better. I would like to be able to play Facebook games.App's (7/10): There were a few apps that were not available on Kindle HD that were available on my ipod. But it's not a big deal to me because I didn't buy it specifically for the apps I bought it for books.Look and appearance (8/10): The HD is a lot lighter than I expected. And I love having the bigger screen but it is a little clunky to me if you compare it to the Kindle Fire 7 inch. But it's just a minor adjustment that I've already gotten used too. In a way it reminds me about the size of a hardback book if you really think about it.Battery life (7/10): I can go several days without having to charge this device. But I gave it a 7 because I only got a USB port in the box and no wall charger. This turned out to be a big pet peeve with me and more of a pain. I tried to charge it through my computer but it didn't work. I had given my Mother my old Kindle Fire so I had to go out and purchase a separate wall charger. Why wouldn't you guys include the wall charger? Not all of us want to sync through our computers. Not to mention if we're going to invest in this much money there should be a wall charger included. So if that's the only complaint that I have about this device that is it that they don't include the wall charger.Side note: I know there isn't really a category for this suggestion but one thing I've noticed when searching for cases for my HD that there aren't very many yet. Maybe I'm just too picky but I was looking for a zip case one and I just couldn't find one I liked. I would like to see more cases for the HD other than just online. And Best Buy had a very few to choose from.Other than the charger issue I'm a happy Kindle Fire HD owner. I do think it is worth it to upgrade to the new version and I'm glad I did. I've had it almost a week now and I'm a happy camper. I like having a bigger screen, and I use the whispersync more than I thought I would.

I decided to upgrade to this unit as I had a little problem reading somethings on the 7\".  This new upgrade is fabulous!!  The resolution is as terrific as Amazon is claiming it is.  The dual antennas were a great idea.  I have wireless N in my home and was able to get 63 mbs with the original Kindle Fire and that was pretty good, just a little longer bringing up a web page, but now with this kindlle with dual antennas, I am now getting 117 and often times 130 mbs.!!!!!

Amazon made it very easy to watch videos on the new kindle if you have amazon prime.  I decided to try it last November and so far the service has been terrific, it really is 2 day delivery, around the holidays it may have been a day more but that is understandable for that time of year.

For example, I have had to \"bother\" Amazon tech support to get their very stupid auto-correct turned off. At first I couldn't even figure out why everything I typed was being morphed into something unintelligible. Then I noticed... you will realize that I am older, have come into the age of computers from the days of kerosene lanterns and outhouses. Well, in that I am not the Lone Ranger.If I had hours to read online instructions, I might have found how to fix that problem without bothering Amazon techs, but I don't have those hours. Again, I am not the Lone Ranger in that.I did manage to get my email set up by myself but cannot access my drafts folders on the Kindle. Tech told me they are working on that issue. Hope so; otherwise I can't do needed work from the Kindle. One-click payment as set up on the Kindle is not satisfactory as it does not show the total at check-out. Turns out you have to use your regular computer to turn that off. 'Nother call to tech support. There is no way to turn on video subtitles. Tech support told me I need to download an \"app\" for that but was unable to tell me which one would provide subtitle capability and whether it would be free. I use subtitles even to understand British English as across-the-pond actors so often swallow their words.But here's the thing: This device is absolutely fabulous despite these frustrations. And Amazon appears to be constantly working to improve it and claims to be listening to customer feedback. I suspect they really are. So I will take the extra time to communicate. And Amazon's tech support is the best ever!!! That alone ensures my continued existence as an enthusiastic Amazon money-spender.The picture is To Die For. Sound is crappy (of course - what can you expect?) but I use headphones - easy enough and then really, really good. Features are amazing for the money. I especially like the new Amazon \"Auto-Rip\" feature that has delivered both music and video without me asking or having to figure out how.

I know that Amazon very carefully screens Android apps to insure against unsafe content, but I wish they would accelerate this effort as there are many apps that I use regularly on my iPhone that have Android counterparts which I can't get on KF.However, this is a minor inconvenience and one I hope will be rectified over time  In the meantime, I will continue to enjoy streaming videos, reading and listening to music via my KF 8.9.", "Title": "Beyond My Expectations!", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Author": "C.

We ended up signing up for Amazon Prime to take advantage of the extensive and free TV and movie libraries, and have used it extensively, watching the first two seasons of Downton Abbey on it the first 2 weeks she had it.  By linking it as a 2nd Kindle to my existing Amazon Kindle account used solely for book reading, we were able to access on the new Kindle Fire all books I had purchased on that original Kindle.  Being able to access the internet gives it much of the functionality of other tablet computers, and with 32 gig of memory, the video and streaming is seamless.  The battery life is much better than I expected too considering the data flow, bright high definition screen, and lengthy periods that it has been used continuously.

First let me say that I am not considered a  \" tech savy \" person, so please consider this review as from an ordinary lay person who LIKES technological devices.You can be sure that the Kindle Fire HD is not a device that you'll need a lot of technical expertise to operate. It is very straight forward and the options are easy to understand. At this point I have owned at one time or another a Kindle, I have a Droid smart phone and my husband has an I Pad from work, so I also have had a chance to compare the I Pad with the Kindle Fire.  The Ipad devices do have larger displays than the Fire HD, but the crispness of the images on the Fire is every bit as good as the Ipad. If you regularly shop on Amazon , the Kindle Fire excels in being integrated with the Amazon store with the options of getting videos and audio very easily. From what I saw and experimented with on my husband's Ipad, there is no such easy integration on the Ipad.I know that the IPad is one of the most highly regarded tablets on the market,but I have to say that the price difference PLUS the easy integration with Amazon's huge library of content makes it a strong competitor and for me the price difference plus the easy integration with Amazon was the deciding factor for me and this was BEFORE I bought the device. Since I have had it in my possession, I can only say I have absolutely NO regrets!Also I find it easy to find great apps. The Android operating system allows you to install any app you want. The Amazon app store is the default app provider for the Kindle Fire, but if you want to get something else, you can manage, it takes a bit of doing to accomplish this though.I am also a prime member and this has made it a breeze to watch many videos and movies for free that you would have to rent if not a member. The Cloud feature  is also a great feature because for Amazon content, the cloud storage quota is unlimited!I would say that in the entertainment category, this device is phenomenal. You will be able to download and access many types of entertainment, such as music, books, videos, apps, the web, Docs, the newsstand etc etc. I could go on and on about this and the more I learn, the more I am so glad that I decided to get this device.I would recomment to download the Kindle Fire HD manual, especially if you are not used to an android device. This manual has been updated for the Kindle Fire HD and even if there is a bit of difference in locating the options, it will be easy to figure out. Another good reference is \" Help Me! Guide to the Kindle Fire HD: Charles Huges\" . They both have a wealth of practical information. I downloaded these two to my Kindle Touch, so I could follow the directions when they were side by side and not have to flip back all the time.As far as any cons:1.  The power button seems a bit awkward in the portrait position because if you are holding the device with both hands, it is  easy for your hand to hit the power button. It might be better to have that button closer to the left of the volume button.2.  The directions for the web searches seem somewhat cumbersome  but once you go through the instructions, it gets better.I might have to update this review later on, since I have only had the Kindle Fire HD for a little while. I am going through the two manuals page by page and learning a lot. So far I am very impressed with what this device is capable of. That said, my husband loves his Ipad, but he uses it mostly for his work and does not deal with Amazon as much as I do.

I've been very pleased with it, and even though I suffered from major envy when the HD came out, I figured I would hold onto my Fire for at least another year.  But when the 8.9\" HD was a lightning deal for $50 off, I just couldn't resist.  And I'm very pleased I gave in.The HD is a vast improvement over the original Fire, beginning most notably with the picture.  When I compare the two side by side, it's clear that Amazon put a lot of focus into picture quality this time around.  Watching video is a much better experience, and the larger screen doesn't hurt.  Sound quality has noticeably improved, as well.Battery life, one of my complaints with the original Fire, seems improved.  This will never be perfect, and Amazon does not help matters by forcing us to pay for a separate charger. OK - grumbling over.I'm not big on apps, although I do check out the free \"App of the Day,\" and I've obtained some fun and/or useful apps at no cost.  I'd recommend checking this out every day to see if there is a free app that appeals to you.  I've also loaded up on lots of free e-books, the vast majority of which I assume I will never read.  Of the ones I have read, however, there is a huge range in quality.  A lot are, frankly, terrible, but there are some gems to be found.  I also have Prime, and while the free movies and TV shows are not as numerous as Netflix, there are plenty of good options, and they look great in HD.Finally, I'd like to recommend an inexpensive, quality case: Blurex Slim Case for Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9 -- With Built in Multi-Angle Stand.

It served me well since I mostly used it for browsing and read books. When the iPad mini came out I decided to give it a try and I liked it for it has many apps I liked (which I never bother to try with the Kindle since I was not an \"apps user\"), on top of that, for it can do Chinese input so well, and the mini is indeed very light in the hand. With that experience, I tried to see if Kindle Fire could do what iPad could with apps. I was able to find most of these apps I liked on iPad and installed them on the old Kindle Fire. But I could not install Chinese kbd app w/o \"rooting\" it\", which I did not want take the risk.I bought the Fire HD 8.9 (on the day it was offered $50 off) with one main purpose: to stream video to TV (with HDMI) when I needed to. I had it for 3 days and initially found it was too big for my taste but I slowly more and more like it while discovering more positive aspects of it. The display is truly beautiful and great for reading PDF books (I love reading old books) with it high res display, and that is far better than the reading experience one would have using the 1st gen Fire or the iPad mini (both are at the iPad 1 screen res). Best of all, I found (by surprise) one can easily install a Chinese keyboard app to fit the need for Chinese text entry. That made me very happy. Now I think I can happily let my wife take the iPad mini since the Fire HD with it new Chinese keyboard is a better Pad for my needs overall.One strange issue bothered heavily me early was that the Kindle HD 8.9 seemed dropping Chinese character in browser or apps in the 1st day or so of use (not to a degree one could not read the page since it only dropped very few on a page), but it seems has learn to do it right now somehow.

I work in an office building and the Kindle has spend 95% of it's time in an indoor, friendly environment.  I've owned my kindle for over a year now and wished from day one I went with a different option.  I choose the Kindle as I'm a big Amazon.com fan and trusted they made a good product. Here are the issues I've been having:If you jump from different applications (i.e. Amazon Videos to Kindle books, Internet browsing), the Kindle freezes up as it doesn't know how to manage the memory properly.  Amazon.com customer service says this is a known issue and recommends holding the power button for 20 seconds to fix the problem.  This is a hard reset and may cause you to loose app data, save points, account history and other information.The touch pad often responds slow or not at all.  This has been the most common issue I have and happens almost every time I use the web browser for more than 5 minutes.  This must also due to poor memory management as Amazon's customer service fix is the same:  Hold Power button for 20 seconds to reset system.Speakers are rear facing.  Not a big factor for me as I use a Wi-fi headset.  If you do wish to use the speaker, you will have to remove it for any case you are using because they cover the speakers and muffle the sound.Charging the Kindle has now become a very serious issue.  I use the recommended Amazon.com kindle quick charger.  Within the year, the kindle connection has become very loose.  Now, I have to make sure the charge is connected just right and hope it isn't bumped.  Many times I've picked up my Kindle after charging, only to find the battery is too low to turn on.  This shouldn't have become an issue as the kindle has always sat flat on my desk or table when charging.This tablet is also not usable outside.  I've attempted to access the web and view movies while spending my lunch hour outside.

He said that the settings in the Wi-Fi router would need to be altered to accept the Kindle Device, but if you're a guest of the Wi-Fi, you don't have the capability to change the router settings.  I didn't learn all of this bad news until after the 30-day return window, and they refuse to accept it as a return because it's technically not a damaged item.

Unfortunately, that wasn't to be.The first device I received froze up time and again, but Amazon, true to their EXCELLENT customer service, sent me a replacement.  The replacement almost never freezes up.  So why don't I like it?  Keeping in mind the fact that this is one user's experience, here are the pros and cons as I see them.Pros:* The e-reader can't be beat.  A great visual experience and the almost seamless ability to purchase/borrow books.*  The Kindle Fire is first-class when it comes to downloading and watching videos, especially if you're an Amazon Prime member and have lots of free videos to choose from.*  The HD experience is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!*  Plenty of useful apps for download, many of them free.*  The size is really nice.Cons:*  Amazon Silk is herky-jerky at best.  Crashes frequently, even after reboot.  Links are often unresponsive.  Doesn't support Flash.*  Hate, hate, hate the carousel.  Cluttered and ungainly and pretty much useless.  Would much rather be able to put my favorite applications on the home screen.*  Actually, this brings us to one of my biggest gripes against the Kindle Fire HD, i.e., the lack of personalization options.  Amazon has pretty much locked you into their concept of usability ... and brother, it's not mine!*  The Dolby speakers ain't all they're cracked up to be.I guess my biggest problem with the Kindle Fire HD echoes a problem I have with Apple products, namely, the user doesn't seem to come first here.  The business plan comes first.  Selling stuff comes first.Basically, I would say if you're after a terrific e-reader and a device you can use to watch videos in glorious color, this would be a good choice.

First the positives though:Good:It's a somewhat cheap device for accessing the internet and amazon content.Bad:Basically everything else.1. Wi-fi connection speed in my home was awful... I could load webpages 4-5 times faster on my iPhone 5 and even my old iPhone 3GS. YouTube videos for the most part just wouldn't load. On every other device, iphones, ps3, ipad, etc... no problems in the same room.2. Touchscreen was having all sorts of problems. Typing was an exercise in futility at times. I'd press the same letter key dozens of times before it was recognized. And it seemed to not be an issue with one location on the screen... just generally unresponsive.3. The absolute worst is the content. Paying for a service like Prime, you'd think would be similar to Netflix since they are positioned as a competitor. It's nothing like Netflix. The available TV and Movie content (PAID content, mind you) is miserable. There is no use for getting prime unless you constantly read books. The worst thing is that they have a MASSIVE catalog of movies, but they have their own rental and purchase prices ON TOP of prime. Some of these go for as much as $20 for HD. That means there is no excuse for not improving the selection of Prime content. I really don't understand why they don't boost their prime content to make it more attractive and leave the new releases as pay per view.Conclusion:I think the best think about the whole situation is that Amazon really does have amazing return policies. That sounds like a backhanded comment, but really if you are interested in trying it out Amazon will give you 30 days to do whatever you want... even give you a trial of prime.

My boyfriend has the Nexus 7 and enjoys it a lot.In order to decide what tablet I would go with I started to list the things I did on the tablet:read bookswatch video (Amazon Prime is amazing)play a few app gamesread the news and look up recipes using Flipboard and Pinterestsurf the web (but not as much as I do on my computer)Both the Kindle HD Fire and Nexus do all of those things except the Kindle has two bonuses:Kindle Lending LibraryAmazon VideosSince I do have Amazon Prime, I watch a lot of my tv shows through that as they are free.I received my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" (if I was going to upgrade I will go big) and was immediately happy that I got it.  It is very beautiful and works extremely well.  Yes there are a few cons (web browsing is a bit slow, typing is somewhat awkward, limited apps since can only use the Amazon app store, interface is not customizable) but I bought it knowing these things.

I had done A LOT of searching, reviewing, and comparing other tablets before purchasing this one. I finally decided that though the KF HD lacked the latest Android OS, and would be centered around the Amazon universe (no Google Play apps, etc) this would be a good beginner tablet. I wasn't wrong about the ease of use and I don't particularly mind not being able to download apps from other than Amazon, especially since everything appears in the Cloud and I can easily delete/retrieve apps at will.However, I was NOT prepared for all the problems I have had with the device since almost day one. I initially had issues with the device locking up all the time and the battery life seemed waaaay short for the time usage. I did my homework and learned to shut down the device by the hard/cold reset. Thought I was home free for a couple of days til the device would no longer charge at all even though there was nothing wrong with my charger. Spoke to customer service for the 3rd time and they sent out THEIR rapid charger because obviously mine was inferior (not her exact words, but that's the gist) I will admit that the tablet absolutely charged better and even performed better with the rapid charger. I was really starting to enjoy using the tablet and happily played games/read my books with little problems for almost 2 WHOLE weeks...until today.I was in the middle of playing a game when it suddenly froze. I had no choice but to shut it down via the hard reset. When I powered it back on, the load screen ran continuously. After an several hours of trying to resolve it on my own, I grudgingly called CS again. The guy was really nice and tried to remotely reset the device (or something to that effect) but when that failed, he offered to replace the device.I am REALLY hoping I simply had a DUD because there are several features i really liked about this tablet. 1.) the screen brightness is awesome for bright days - not so good for battery life but you can really see the screen well.2.) the auto-sleep sensor is awesome when using a case that supports it.3.) size is perfect for me due to poor vision, I felt the 7\" was too small and a 10\" was just too bulky 4.) the gorilla glass screen is really durable and sensitive to the touch. I had a screen protector but took it off when the stylus had too much drag for sketching/drawing. 5.) the carousel is nicer than I thought it would be, keeps the apps and books easily accessible with a simple flick of a finger.Time will tell if the replacement KF HD will perform better than my first one. I will be happy to change my rating! The only reason I didn't rate it lower to begin with is because I really enjoy the tablet when its working and customer service has been quite good, albeit a little stubborn at times.UPDATE July 2013: The replacement KF HD 8.9\" is performing MUCH better than my first one, therefore I will now give the device 4 stars. There are still some issues that prevent me from giving a 5 star rating.  For some weird reason, my carousel will randomly disappear and I am left with a black screen with the menus at the top. Luckily the menus are still there and I can simply  There really seems to be no rhyme or reason for this and in all fairness I haven't spoken to CS yet to see if there's a resolution. Another thing is there are often errors when I download apps from the app store and I end up having to redownload them. I don't know if this is a device issue for certain, but it is annoying.As an added note, I had the opportunity to play around with an Asus 10 \" tablet a few weeks ago and was jealous she could have an animated background that changed with the times of day! But unless there's a way to enlarge the icons on the opening screen, I admit I like the big ol' carousel (when it isn't hiding) as my eyesight is deteriorating.", "Title": "GRRRR...needs replacing after 2.5 months...", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Author": "Alan Batten \"promoman\"", "ReviewID": "R3KFM9PMT2A8ZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Until I purchased my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", I had been resisting getting an e-book reader as well as something in addition to my iPad 3.

I read comparisons between the Kindle, IPad and Nexus 7 for weeks and the bottom line is people i.e. reviewers like what they like and it doesn\u2019t take long when they are comparing the various devices to see if they are IPad, Nexus or Kindle fans.  You can compare processors, screen contrast, memory, etc. until you are blue in the face; I personally can\u2019t see anything in the way of speed, sound and display when using the Kindle that would cause me to switch to an IPad or Nexus.  I will say I\u2019m not a big fan of Apple; they seem to nickel and dime you to death and are rarely competitive when it comes to price.  I am an Prime Amazon consumer i.e. I buy everything under the sun from Amazon and like the idea that the Kindle is tailored for their website and products.  I like the idea that Amazon does offer the consumer books and magazines for FREE; if nothing else it is a great gesture from a retailer to a consumer.Last night I streamed a movie, surfed the web, listen to my music as well loaded roughly 5600 mp3 to the cloud last night (It took about 8 hours) so that I can have them at my finger tips with the Kindle.  The entire Kindle experience was satisfying.  Being a man that doesn\u2019t carry a purse, backpack, clutch or anything along those lines, I decided on the 8.9 inch version; the 7 inch wouldn\u2019t fit in my pants pocket, so what was the point in passing up a larger screen for roughly the same price as the 7 inch.  Women on the other hand carry a suitcase around daily so the 7 inch may be better, if you are considering portability.If you like one stop shopping the IPad and Kindle are what you are looking for.  If you want to be locked inside a room with only a front door and no key, I would say stick with Apple products and buy an IPad.  If you would like the option of a locked front door and an unlocked back door then I\u2019d say go with the Kindle and Amazon\u2019s products.  If you want a front and back door with a window and a key to lock and unlock both doors, then go with a Nexus; you will however have to find independent sites to buy your movies, music, books, magazines, etc.  Personally, I don\u2019t have the time or desire to go from site to site trying to find media and audio content for my entertainment device.Lastly, I own 3 PCs, 1 Netbook, 1 Apple Mini computer, 1 Barnes and Noble Nook,  a Kindle DX and now the Kindle Fire.  I believe in buying the right tool for the job.  If I wanted the fastest CPU and was doing serious multitasking on the go, I would buy a notebook computer, not a tablet that is designed for pure entertainment which both the IPad and Kindle are really design to accommodate.

I have owned several different versions of the Kindle and also the first Kindle Fire.  When I got the new 8.9 HD, I was so excitied.  First, it's beautiful!  Second, OMG the image is clear, crisp and so sharp.  The Kindle Fire HD is very easy to use with on screen instructions and tips.  It is very easy to connect to all of your social media including, facebook, twitter and my space.  You also have access to all of your yahoo, hotmail and gmail accounts.  The app store is not as robust as Google Play however there are some decent apps out there.I am a Prime member, so I have all of my books, music and movies on Amazon.  I really worried with this one how surfing the web would be as the last fire seemed to be rather cumbersome and slow.  The Fire HD is FAST!  I have a newer Dell laptop core i5 and this new Kindle Fire loads just as quick if not quicker in some instances than my laptop.I have spent about a week now with my new Fire HD and my love and awe continue.  I love being able to do everything online that I need to do, check my bank, check my school work, office work, shop, play games and facebook.  I really barely use my laptop these days unless I have to type something.  I do hope they come out with keyboard case for the Kindle Fire.Now on to Kindle Free time - I have a 5 year old who loves my Kindle.  I started up the free time for him and set up his profile.  We downloaded all of his apps and books and he clicks on his name to see just his stuff when he wants to use the Kindle.  I am rather disappointed that the books that I have ordered for him say text to speech is enabled but it only reads the credit of the books.  I was hoping that he would be able to read along with the stories.  Hope this gets fixed soon!Ipad vs. Kindle Fire HD - I also own and IPad.. and to be honest, I hate it.  It sits here and I never use it.  It's heavy and cold.  I really hate the metal feel in my hands and the price is ungodly.  The Ipad2 is also much slower than the Fire HD.  That being said I was very happy with the price for the Fire HD.  I opted to purchace the one without special ads.  I was really bothered that the Fire HD only comes with the cable for charging and not the actual wall charger.  You have to buy this seperatly for 19.99.So why the 4 star review and not 5 if I love it?  Well for one the fact that I have to pay for a charger.  This in my opinion is BS.  Two, we need more apps... and some of the apps that are out there just don't work, even after uninstalling and reinstalling (slotomania and scramble with friends).  There are also paid versions of the apps that I have on my Samsung Galaxy SIII that I would love to put on my Kindle Fire but that is sadly not available.

Due to a few issues, I gave it a four because it's not possible to give a half star, otherwise I would have given it a four and a half.I've had a first generation Fire since they came out, and loved it from the start. There are some great improvements on this new one that I really love, but there are also a few things that I think could be better.  First, the good:The screen really does look as gorgeous as Amazon promised. The first thing I did when I received it was go to videos and watch the trailer for the movie \"Brave\", and I must say, I was absolutely blown away at the incredibly beautiful quality of the screen.  It's amazing!  After watching more videos, I am still just as impressed - they look fabulous and run smoothly with no lag. I'm also extremely happy with how spectacular my magazines look.The sound is great, and hugely improved over the first generation Kindle Fire, which makes enjoying video and music all the better.I love the larger size of the 8.9\".  It makes the whole Kindle Fire experience even more enjoyable without being hard to handle.  Feels just right, nice and thin, and not heavy to hold.Processing speed is great, and so is Wifi speed.  Screen operation is very smooth, with scrolling much smoother than the first Kindle Fire.Very happy to have the camera to Skype on this Fire - I'll be Skyping with my friend in France who I don't get to see all that often, so for me that's a nice plus.  I know some people are complaining about the lack of another camera, but I knew that before I purchased it, and I don't intend to take pictures with my Fire so it's not an issue for me.Ok, now for the things that need improvement:I don't know what they were thinking when they decided on the on/off and volume buttons - they're hard to feel or see, and I quickly got sick of hunting for them.  However, I just received a case I ordered from Amazon, and now with the cut-out holes for the buttons in the case, they are easier to find.  Also the case automatically wakes/sleeps the Fire, so that's less pressing of the on/off button for me as well.  By the way, you don't have to spend a small fortune for a case - mine is really nice and it only cost about $15 on Amazon.Yesterday when I typed on my new Fire I had no problems.  Today, though I still have auto capitalization and word suggestions turned on (I checked), the auto caps and word suggestions are not working.  I'm going to call Amazon about this, but I would hope that issues like these will be fixed with the next automatic update.The Silk browser crashed several times yesterday as soon as I opened more than one tab, though it's been ok today.  Again, another issue that will hopefully be fixed with an update, as I believe Amazon did for the Silk browser on the first generation Fires (initially I had problems with Silk being unstable on my first Fire, but that issue was resolved).I found Amazon's \"recommendations\" for me below my carousel annoying, so I got rid of them by going to Settings, then Applications, then Home Recommendations and turning them off.  Annoying problem solved.  As for the ads on the opening screen, they don't bother me as they're only there briefly till I swipe the screen.Based on the experience I had with my first Kindle Fire, I think once there is an update for the new Kindle Fire HD, many of the kinks that I and others are experiencing should be solved (except, of course, for the buttons). Overall, I do love my new Fire, and I hope to be just as happy with it as I have been with my first generation Fire.  Hopefully after fixes, the only thing that would keep me from giving it a five-star review would be the on/off and volume buttons.", "Title": "Mostly Love it, but a few Issues", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Author": "Dave Edmiston", "ReviewID": "R3NERQJ227KFUA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using my original Kindle Fire for about a year now, and I've been using Kindle eBook readers since the original version of the Kindle (K1), so I have many years worth of likes and dislikes with the Kindle devices.  I've been using this new Fire HD 8.9\" for about four days now and am very happy with it, with a few notable exceptions.  In general though, it's an amazing device and I'm pretty thrilled with it.I'm not happy about the lack of Flash, but that's inevitable based on Adobe's removal of Flash from the Android world.  My bigger complaint is over the lack of autocomplete in the Silk browser. I don't get it. They also changed the keyboard layout a little bit so that punctuation characters like the comma, the apostrophe, the question mark, etc. aren't available by just pressing and holding the period. So between the lack of autocomplete and the new location for these characters, typing text is clunkier than it was on the original Fire.Other than that, I really do love the new Fire.It's super fast. They really enhanced the browser and the CPU speed. Having a larger screen makes it easier to work with too. They also improved a lot of things on the UI to make the experience better.They stopped dumping your entire Library to the Carousel, which makes it a lot less cluttered when you initially start it up.I don't really care for the Related Items below the Carousel though (where the Favorites used to be). It's a pretty ham handed attempt to funnel you back to the Amazon store.The Facebook app stinks, but the screen is large enough and the tablet is fast enough that it's easier just to use the full Web-based version instead of the app or the mobile version.The product Offers on the home screen aren't as annoying as I had expected. I actually like them more than the screen saver images on the original Fire. At least these change up more often and give more variety.I like the new camera and the ability to use Skype.I like the attempts at location services, but it probably would have been easier just to put a cheap GPS radio in it.I thought I would really love the new location for the power button and the physical volume up/down buttons. The buttons are cheap though. I tried pushing volume down + power to take a screenshot (a feature that I was really hoping for), but the key combination never worked for me. This actually caused the power button to get stuck. With the power button stuck, there was no way to turn the device back on. I had to thump on the button with my finger a bunch of times to get it to unstick. I'll probably need to have Amazon replace this unit for me, because that's not OK.The Dolby speakers that Amazon touted so hard are actually really nice. I was surprised how good the sound quality is.For me the biggest and most awesome improvement is in the actual Book reader app. Reading Kindle books on the Fire HD 8.9\" is amazing. The larger screen is so much easier to read on. And one very cool feature is that when you turn the device to landscape view, it gives you a two-page view. This is a very comfortable way to read. (My wife says she's had the two-page view in her iPad's Kindle app for a long time.)I've heard a lot of people complain about the lack of power adapter.  You get a USB cord, and the idea is that you plug this into your PC.  If you stick with this option, you will get a very slow charge from your Kindle.  If you have an original Kindle Fire, you are much better off using that charger for the new Fire HD.  I actually like the fact that it comes with a good USB cable.  I have plenty of 2.1A USB chargers around the house, so I'll use the cable with those chargers.All in all, I'm really happy with the fire.

Great interface. Easy to use and lightweight enough to carry like a small book.2. I like the moving home button. That's one thing that annoyed me about the iPad when I played with it in the Apple store is that the home button was a physical button. The home button is a soft button on the screen that moves around as the screen does. It is at a convenient location all the time so that helps.3. I can now read my tech books while lying down on the bed, which are usually heavy and a pain to carry around. I used my laptop before ( too big) and my iPhone ( too small) too and neither were comfortable for me to read while I was lying in bed or just lounging around at a cafe. I feel like Goldilocks when I say this but the 8.9 kindle fire is just right.4. The sound and video quality is pretty good. so are apps on the Amazon.5. Going to the store and buying the apps/games/books/music/video is pretty easy, smooth and very quick over wireless.Things I didn't like:1. Packaging. I felt like besides that small thin USB cable, it could have included something else. Like maybe an power adapter that should NOT be 10 dollars more. I don't know what the iPad comes with but I have an iPhone and iPod touch and they both came with their own adapters. I luckily , like every other tech junkie out there, already have a belk USB adapter so its not like I was totally inconvenienced or something. Just enough to crib about it on Amazon anyway. I also thought it should have come with its own earphones. It doesn't. you have to get those too. :(. I just think it sweetens the deal, that's all. Then again, I might be totally spoiled by Apple.2. Keyboard. The keyboard is easy enough to use but the response seems to have a little lag and it isn't as smooth as one might think it could be. it has suggested words on top of the keyboard which does help speed up searches. Luckily I'm not going to be using it much for typing.3. Auto correct. I do like features like these when I am texting and it is a great help. Usually, but the auto correct kept correcting my name when I used it as a proper noun in most instances like while entering it in fields like \"first or last name\" or \"username\" or other places where you would think it shouldn't matter what you typed in because it specifically asks for uniqueness. iPhone had that problem too but I fixed that by entering it in the address field. Which I felt I shouldn't have to do because guess what? The thing is registered to me and it says so on the top left hand corner too that this is \"Sonali's Kindle\". So it should stop auto correcting it to Somalia.  I spent a good 4 minutes entering my name over and over again because it kept auto correcting it. It needs to get a clue that after the first try the \"typo\" was intentional.4. GUI to the amazon store to buy physical stuff is clunky and non responsive. I wanted to buy a cover for my kindle. It just didn't respond to my touch to enter payment information or address and I kept trying. I've also notice some apps like Netflix and facebook have really slow response times and at times they just hang. Since I don't face any problem with response when I use the ebook reader or the app store and certain games, I am not sure if this one can be blamed on the kindle but on the app developers.Overall it's doing what I want it to do.

Great design great image quality.  Great sound.  Great device for Amazon content (if you are a Prime member, a lot less so, if you are not).This is a tablet with good specs.  It has the best interface for Amazon content (better than any Amazon app available to competing tablets/platforms.).The functionality of this tablet in regards to the Amazon ecosystem really should be included in the Amazon apps for iOS/WindowsRT/Android.Cons:  This OS really should be just an app.  You feel like it isn't really a fully functioning tablet.  I considered converting this to a full android tablet, but didn't because I have enough tablets (android and ios) in the house and there is no value in adding another.  That saved this from the hack-monster.Takes forever to charge.  Can't understand why when it's battery life is less than good.  Not a fan of the power button location.  It is position right at where you would hold the tablet.  Also not a fan of the power port and the micro hdmi port.  Makes it impossible to charge the device while using with oem Amazon stand case (nicely done case, btw). I take this with me when I'm out and expect to have a lot of down/waiting time.  It really is a quite capable media device and the Amazon content is really well done. I can live with the closed ecosystem and recognize this as a great media delivery device, but my biggest issue with it is the Silk browser and it's constant crashing and inconsistent performance (not sure why a proprietary browser was necessary with all the great available browsers out there (especially for an android based tablet...why reinvent the wheel?)...and to exclude Google's Chrome browser from the list of available apps (you can side load (why should you have to?), but can't access Google Play).That really doesn't make much sense, but I suspect that Amazon is using that proprietary browser to collect consumer data on its unsuspecting customers, in a way not possible through another browser it doesn't own. Watching movies or reading books on the device is great, but not having a consistent browser is what keeps this device home, most of the time.  I can live with the limits of the closed Amazon environment, if I have access to a well executed browser (that's where the meat of my usage is).  I won't hack this to make it better and will not side load a real browser.  I just, very often don't consider using it because of the horrible browser experience (the browser always eventually crashes).  I will take it with me if I have room for two tablets (the Kindle for entertainment and a real tablet for everything else (usually everything else wins out and the Kindle just lives on my treadmill...a shame, really, for what should be a pretty good device).", "Title": "Great Amazon content tablet...meh everywhere else", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Author": "Cat", "ReviewID": "R2ZNTXX1EF7W6I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have purchased 7 Kindle Fire 7's over the last several years for myself and as gifts for family.

But be forewarned; this device is NOT an iPad and to expect any Amazon device to function anywhere close to an iPad is an unrealistic expectation.  If you're in the market for a tablet and you really want an iPad, then save up for an iPad.  I chose the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 because a) it was cheaper, and b) for the amount of screen real estate that I was getting at the price of it, it was too good to pass up.  But here's a few pro's and con's that I've noticed with it...Pro's:-The HD display does not disappoint!  I bought an episode of the Twilight Zone and threw it on my KF HD and it looks phenomenal.  The audio is as good as advertised, although to really get the most out of audio, you'll want to get a good set of earphones or earbuds as the speakers can be drowned out if there is something going on in the background (i.e. screaming kids, dishwasher, whatever).-The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 doesn't weigh much, so lugging it around with you is no big deal.  I take mine to work everyday in my backpack and I can't tell that it's in there.  In fact, I sometimes forget it's in there.-There aren't a whole lot of apps to choose from as compared to the Apple App Store, but if you go to a site like Good e-reader you can sideload a ton of decent apps to go along with your Kindle Fire HD.Con's:-I'm not crazy about where the ports are for this device.  The power charger and the HDMI output are technically on the bottom, thus making it useless to try to charge my Kindle and keep it on its stand at the same time.  While we are discussing the placement of things on the device, the power and volume control is in an annoying place.  That is one thing I believe the old Kindle Fire has over the new(er) HD model with having the power control on bottom.-Battery life can be a little deceiving on most electronics, and I think there's no exception when it comes to the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  If I stream anything on Netflix, my battery is almost depleted in a couple of hours.  If I'm reading, watching something on YouTube, or surfing the web/checking email, battery life is awesome.  And while we're at it, if you plan on purchasing any Kindle Fire products, BE SURE TO PURCHASE THE FAST CHARGER!!!  I have no clue why this doesn't ship automatically with the device (shame on you Amazon) but for $19 you can charge your device much quicker than with an iPhone cube or connected to your computer.All things considered, I still love this device, and I realize it's not perfect, but for the price I can't argue.

Adams", "ReviewID": "R3T7RZPX47Y2JF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet for my wife at Christmas.  She had previous owned an ipad, but unfortunately, it was stolen in a home invasion and was never recovered.  Since that time, she has occasionally used my kindle fire hd 7\" but longed for her own table.  So I decided to purchase this 8.9\" kindle fire.  All the same great features with a bigger screen I thought.  How could I go wrong?Overall, I suppose this tablet is okay.  As a amazon prime member, my wife has easy access to all the videos, books, and kindle apps her heart desires.  She has started reading much more because of the convenience of searching for and obtaining books, and naturally the bigger screen just makes that a lot easier.  Unfortunately, however, her experience surfing the internet has not been as grand.Before I purchased the kindle fire 8.9\", I had read reviews that warned that this tablet had issues with stuttering while loading pages and generally unexplained slowness.  Since I'd never experienced anything like this with my kindle fire 7\" I sort of shrugged it off.  I might have disregarded those problems a little to quickly I've discovered, because my wife has had lots of issues with pages with rich image content not loading quickly, stuttering during loading or just freezing of  the whole tablet.As the tech guy at the house (and I'm using that moniker loosely because I am not that tech suave) I've had to try to find a solution to this problem.  I've read pages and pages of supposed fixes, and I've tried more than I can recall right now.  One thing that has really helped is by using apps for all my wife's favorite websites like facebook, twitter, pinterest, etc. instead of using the web browser to view them.  (I've never had to use an app for these sites on my fire 7\".  The web pages work great in browser mode.)But even though we've cut down on the problems, the slowness issues still persistent, though thankfully we've eliminated the freezing.All in all, the kindle fire 8.9\" is a great looking tablet at a really good price.  It does work - more or less, and it is really convenient for using amazon prime services.  However, if you are thinking of buying this one, you should take the warning about slowness, stuttering loading pages, and freezes very seriously.  Those things might be a problem with your particular kindle fire 8.9\".", "Title": "Good tablet Not Great!", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Author": "Joey Purnell", "ReviewID": "RM6Y10XB291MC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch is a pretty good tablet. It's not great but it's still pretty good. It has a nice screen with awesome speakers and sound! But it is pretty heavy so it's not that comfortable to hold. It has a nice sleek looking design. But I think the ports would be better placed on the bottom. But probably the biggest negative is the app store. It is very small compared to Apple and Google's app stores. Their are a lot of good apps NOT available on it like Instagram,Google Chrome,Youtube, Google Maps, Google Plus, and the free version of Cut the Rope. Speaking of web browsers, Amazon's silk browser is ok, but the fact that they don't have chrome in the app store just makes you want it even more! The battery life also isn't that great. But some more positive things about the device are, that even though the app store is limited most of the apps on their are really good! The reading experience is better than any other tablet on the market right now. And if you have Amazon Prime you have a lot of great options available to you. X Ray is also a really cool feature especially when watching movies. The front facing camera is also pretty cool to have. But sadly it does not have a back facing camera.

I'm sure if there's a new version that comes out, I'll probably find an excuse to buy it at some point as I keep finding uses for the older ones. That said, it took me a while to warm up to the Fire HD. Perhaps because I expected so much from it, it being the first real tablet Kindle to come out, even though I'm not going to rave about Apple or the others.At first I mainly stuck to the reading and video capabilities - of course it's easy to download, manage and read material on the Fire HD. Videos look great on the screen as well, and as someone who streams their Prime account as well as Hulu and Netflix all of the time, I haven't noticed any issues with the video quality or capability. Some days I watch more on my Fire HD than I do my tv.Music streams and plays well, also (though have a complaint with the playlists on Kindles and how they can time out. Why no loop feature, Amazon?).I'm not the biggest app person out there - I've been able to eventually track down what I need and notice that there's more out there all of the time, but again, it's not like I hit the app store that often. I've never had an issue with the apps I have downloaded.It took me a while to get used to the Silk/internet feature. I'm not the biggest fan of this aspect of the Fire HD - if there was something to detract stars from,t his wold be it. Maybe because on a regular pc I'd have a couple of dozen tabs open and tons of bookmarks, and I don't think the bookmark nature of Silk is very intuitive and I have to remember to keep the tabs to a minimum for it to function well. Here's hoping to improvements in future upgrades.All in all, the Fire HD is a great tablet/multi-media/entertainment device.

I have been wanting a tablet, namely an Ipad for a long time now but just could never justify or get a good feeling about the cost, I have the money, just could never get a warm fuzzy feeling about spending the amount that Apple requires to carry their products around.After quite a few hours of research, I settled on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  When it arrived, it was almost alll the way charged, configuration with my wireless and Amazon account was extremely easy and I was quickly on my way to \"playing\" on it.I've read a lot of reviews that talk about the lack of apps, but all the heavy  hitters are there.  Facebook, Netflix, Pinterest, more than enough weather apps, Allrecipies, MyFitnessPal, all the latest games...........other than my personal bank or local television station, I can't really think of anything else that I would like that I'm missing.I'm not a gadget guru, but I have used a couple others and while it affects nothing of my  Kindle experience, I do see where the Kindle does not scroll as beautifully as the Ipad, page turning in the books is not as cool as Nook's actual page turning when I touch the screen, but again, these are very small insignificant things.I spent the better part of the weekend learning my new gadget and I'm in love with it.  The Silk browser is fast,  I can bookmark my webpages that I like to frequent for easier access.  I read the better part of a book and really enjoyed the Sephia option of page color, white seemed a little bright.  I watched a couple episodes of a TV show on NetFlix, my husband watched an AmazonPrime movie and we both surfed the net and played games on it all weekend.  Everything I needed in a tablet is there and the fact that it's half the price of what I've been wanting makes me feel even better about my purchase!!I would certainly recommend this to anyone not wanting to spend a lot when it's only going to be used for entertainment.", "Title": "Beat My Expectations", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Author": "csnyder", "ReviewID": "RMYOIB0AI1IW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love my Kindle Fire.

With an Amazon Prime membership, this device is a dream. I'm definitely part of the Amazon eco-system, purchasing books, movies and general products from the main website.There are only 2 things holding me back from giving this a five-star review:1) The native Silk web browser does not intentionally come with Flash support.  Yes, I know you can enable Flash support but the image quality is much better through a sideapp called Dolphin.  If you don't believe me, download Dolphin, watch a youtube video with HD resolution on Dolphin and then switch over to the Silk browser with Flash support and watch the same video.  It's like night and day.  The Dolphin browser with Flash support runs smoother and looks better than the Silk browser with enabled Flash support.  I don't like side loading apps because it may hinder the device now or in the future.2) Netflix looks like 480i on an HD screen.  I have a high bandwidth of wi-fi at my home.  I stream Netflix on my Roku and X-Box 360 player without a single hiccup and picks up a 720p stream instantly.  The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 simply looks muddy in comparison.  I know people on this review forum have stated they have no issue with Netflix on their Kindle Fire HD 8.9 but I think they must be resolved to watch it on 480i.  I unfortunately want Netflix streaming at the highest resolution possible (720p, as advertised by Netflix and Amazon).  I've checked my wi-fi, through countless forums dedicated to Kindle Fires and Netflix and no one has a solution.  People have simply given up watching Netflix on the Kindle Fire HD or just shrug their shoulders and watch it in 480i.  Just as a comparison, I watched 13 Samurai through my Amazon Prime and again through my Netflix account.  The Amazon Prime version of 13 Samurai looked beautiful (great color separation and image quality) and streamed 720p with no issue on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  When watching 13 Samurai through my Netflix account, the Kindle Fire HD looked muddy and bland (Yes, I wandered everywhere in my house to make sure it wasn't an issue with wi-fi interference and at one point kept the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 next to the wi-fi port to ensure the best quality).  I also watched the movie for an hour hoping the image quality was going to improve on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  The image never improved.  Just to ease my mind, I streamed 13 Samurai through Netflix on my Roku player and it looked similar to the Amazon Prime on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 (excellent quality).  I'm hoping and praying that a Netflix or Amazon representative is reading this and can resolve to fix this issue.  I like the convenience of watching Netflix anywhere but I have to watch on my Roku for now.  If the Netflix issue is ever resolved, I will change my review from a 4-star review to a 5-star review.  I can live with the limited Silk web browser but not this muddy-looking Netflix.Excellent device, especially if you have an Amazon Prime membership.", "Title": "Almost perfect...", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Author": "DON CLONTZ", "ReviewID": "R1WJ3GY8482RK5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "GREAT FOR BOOK READERS, MOVIE WATCHERS, ETC.

So, look to other reviews for an idea of exactly how this tablet works (of which there are plenty). This review is to try and clear up some common misconceptions in the various comparison reviews I've seen with respect to the screen resolution. Most of the reviews which compare the Fire HD 8.9\" vs. iPad (retinal) vs. Nexus 10 will refer to the actual number of pixels. Such a comparison is misleading and irrelevant, as the resolution number which matters is the ppi (pixels per inch). This is because the screens of these three devices are all different sizes.More specifically, the Fire HD 8.9\" has an 8.9\" display with an aspect ratio of 16:10 (i.e., wide-screen TV). The Nexus 10 also has an aspect ratio of 16:10, but has a 10\" screen. Thus, the Nexus 10 would need to have more pixels that the Fire HD 8.9\" just to maintain the same resolution (i.e., ppi). The iPad (retinal) is 9.7\", but has a 4:3 aspect ratio (i.e., old school TV). So you can just throw the actual number of pixels out the  window for this comparison. Furthermore, the only number that really affects clarity is the ppi (just like the dpi number for printers). Here's a break down so you can see what I'm talking about:Fire HD 8.9\" is an 8.9\" screen with 1920\u00d71200 pixels, which yields a resolution of 254 ppi.Nexus 10 is a 10\" screen with 2560\u00d71600 pixels, which yields a resolution of 300ppi.iPad (retinal) is a 9.7\" screen with 2048\u00d71536 pixels, which yields a resolution of 264 ppi.These are not calculations I did, but tech specs obtained from the web (Amazon and Apple list their ppis, while I needed a Google search for the ppi of the Nexus 10).So, while the iPad (retinal) seems to have a number of pixels close to the Nexus 10, its actual resolution is actually just about the same as the Fire HD 8.9\". Further more, the screen length is just about the same from the pictures I've seen (also indicated by the 1920 length pixels of the Fire HD 8.9 compared to the 2048 length pixels of the iPad). So, while any 4:3 videos or images will be larger on the iPad, and wide screen videos (i.e., just about all modern movies and TV shows) will be just about the same size.The resolution of the Nexus 10 is clearly higher than the other two tablets (by roughly 20%). This should make a difference when viewing text and possibly photographs or other static images (provided the images themselves have a resolution of at least 300 dpi). However, HD video right now is a max of 1080p, which corresponds to a resolution of 1920\u00d71080 pixels (2.1 megapixel) (as obtained from Wikipedia). Thus, I am not sure you would see a difference in video quality with the Nexus 10, as the limiting clarity factor with each of the three devices is the actual image resolution and not the screen resolution. If there is an upscaling program in the Nexus 10, then the video image might be better. Otherwise, you're not likely to see a difference.It should also be noted that while the Nexus 10 has a comparable screen diagonal to the iPad, the difference in aspect ratios means that the Nexus 10 has a longer screen than the iPad (i.e., bigger wide screen picture), while the iPad has a wider screen than the Nexus 10 (i.e., bigger standard 4:3 screen than the iPad). This means that while movies will be larger on the Nexus 10, magazines and other print media will be larger on the iPad. Similarly, web pages (which your most likely to browse in landscape mode) will be easier to navigate and view on the iPad.I should also note that Ultra HD is a technology that is just getting off the ground. The resolution for Ultra HD is at least 4 times that of regular HD, with a resolution of 3840\u00d72160 (8.3 megapixels). However, there's not much, if any, video content that currently uses Ultra HD. Add that to the fact that any tablet will likely be outdated by the time Ultra HD takes off, and the increased ppi on the Nexus 10 is likely an irrelevant factor (as opposed to with TVs, which you may intend to replace only once a decade or so). Also, with the small screen size of tablets, I'm not sure how much of a difference the naked eye could actually detect between regular HD and Ultra HD.In conclusion, if all you want is an HD tablet to read books and other media, and to view streaming video (like me), then the Fire HD 8.9\" is a no brainer compared to the other tablets since it is by far the least expensive option and you're not likely to find the additional features/benefits of either of the other two tablets worth the increased price. However, if you need increased functionality and/or access to more apps, then it's likely a toss-up between the Nexus 10 and the iPad depending upon your individual wants/needs. The hassle-free usability and user friendly operation of Apple's products would lead me to spend the extra $100 and get the iPad over the Nexus 10, but that's just my personal preference.UPDATE:I just received my device yesterday and love it. The New Yorker app seems to have a glitch, but the device worked flawlessly otherwise. I've been using my wife's iPad 2 for the past three weeks and easily like the HD 8.9\" just as much--if not more. The print for books is cristal clear with no noticeable pixilation--unlike the original fire and my wife's iPad 2 which I refuse to use to read books. Netflix and Amazon Instant video work flawlessly, and I've had no problems with the web browser yet--though you should see other reviews for downloading a different browser if you experience Flash issues. The Free-Time Unlimited app is also pretty awesome if you have kids. Even my two-and-a-half year old was fascinated by it, and the locking features allow me to let her play with it without me having to keep correcting her--as I need to do when we let her use the ABC Mouse app on the iPad since she can access the web by merely swiping her hand across the screen.If you all you want to do is surf the web, read books, and watch streaming video, then this is the perfect option--especially since you can get a \"used\" (which I understand to be refurbished or returned shortly after receiving since this product is pretty new) HD 8.9\" with 32 GB and no adds for $285 (including shipping). That's $15 less than a new 16 GB version with adds!The only down-side is that the apps are noticeably more limited than on the iPad. As of this review, I can't get the Optimum cable app, the Showtime app, or the ABS Mouse app (a great children's app). I'm hoping that this will change soon since HBO Go is currently available, but I have no idea how long I'll have to wait. Personally though, combining the cost savings with the Free-Time Unlimited app--which offsets the unavailability of ABC Mouse in my book--I still say the Fire HD 8.9\" beats out the iPad by quite a margin.", "Title": "Clearing Up Misinformation", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Author": "Irish", "ReviewID": "R2LD23MCC6DDY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What you get for the price can't be beat.

The 8.9 is great, it serves its purpose as a media consumption device but its size makes it useful for school work also (buy a good BT keyboard).

She was always complaining that she could never get on the computer because of me!  I will not make this a long review, as others have already done so.  I will say, however, that the Kindle has exceeded all of my wife's expectations, as well as my own.  It was not difficult to set the email account up with Verizon on the Kindle.  She has enjoyed the Facebook app. and uses it daily.  She finds it very easy to surf through the Internet, and equally as easy to send and receive email.  I have had a lot of fun with Amazon Prime watching the old Western \"B\" movies...movies I have not seen in 50 years--Roy Rogers, Johnny Mack Brown, Gene Autry, etc.  There are an awful lot of movies offered through Amazon Prime that are free to download, and I find this feature to be most useful and a super value.  New owners of a Kindle get a free 30 day membership with Prime, and after that, it is $79 a year.  I expect full well to renew after the 30 days is up.  I did have one problem however;  for some reason I was unable to download videos after 10 days.  I called Amazon service on a weekend, and they told me they would turn it over to the technical department.  I called the next day to see the status of it, and was told it would take up to 3 business days to address my problem.  I received an email from Amazon late the same day, tried the video downloads, and yep, it is now working.  As far as the charger not included with the unit, I don't think that is a big deal.  I purchased a wall charger, cord, car charger and a nice protective leather (like) cover for under $15.00 over E-Bay which included shipping.  So, I was able to purchase the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 for $249.00 on a one day only sale, and I think this was a terrific value for the money.  Knowing what I know now, would I make the same decision?

Its speed is impressive, and the screen size helps him avoid the mobile versions of his favorite websites (traditionalist, isn't he?). The tablet's sensitivity is pretty awesome, too. We were playing a game app involving rolling balls and navigable mazes, and I swear, I could feel the weight of the pixel ball as it bumped around the wooden barriers.We're Amazon Prime members, as well, so the freedom to continue watching our favorite free shows and movies was a definite factor in choosing another Kindle device for our household.", "Title": "Complete Success!", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Author": "av Joe", "ReviewID": "R2UJ7LXF4U1M80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The screen is big enough to read easily.The web pages load pretty fast off the WIFI internet.Apps open and close pretty fast.That is pretty much 98% of what you want from this machine.If this is what you expect from this machine, you will be happy.This is not a laptop.", "Title": "good enough", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Author": "gail weatherbee", "ReviewID": "R3VF0Q1YH8QX1R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "did alot of research on tablets and when they say the resolution is equal to or better to the IPAD then it is.  love the APPS and the internet access.

For the short period of time that I have had it, I keep  finding more and more uses, things,apps and all around really neat things this Fire can do. I was a little leary of buying this, even though I have had an older model Kindle reader with apx. 160 books on it and have never had any issue of function of this product. When I received this unit I carefully unpacked and fired it up. I was so impressed with the functions, HD colors and just general feel of this product, that my main response was, WHY DID I WAIT THIS LONG TO BUY THIS UNIT! I know I have really only scratched the surface of the functions of this and can't wait to discover all.One point that I have to share is that I am a retired Law Enforcement Officer and have gone on to getting my NRA and State certification for firearm instruction. As such I haveto haul around a large laptop case and a digital projection case as well as a large rolling box with a number of firearms for demonstrative purposes. As Iget older this becomes a rather difficult venture. With the Kindle Fire HD, I was able to download the NRA program onto the Kindle and using the proper cable, etc. I now can leave my laptop at home, thereby reducing that weight, my next step is to purchase a hand held projecter, available from Amazon, and further reduce the amount of equiptment. I now can load up and go to locations and use my energy to teaching my students all the proper instruction in safely using, care and feeding of same. Point is, without the Kindle Fire HD, I would properly reduce the number of classes that I perform. Without any doubt, if the reader is thinking of purchasing any other tablet, Ipad or others take a good long look at the 8.9\" Kindle and I am sure that this will meet most, if not all.

Of them all, I like the Kindle App on my iPad the best (because it allows outside content to be saved on it, ie not only from Amazon). Apart from that, I like, or dislike, each of the Kindles for different reasons.Since this review is about the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", I'll just refer to the others where it's relevant.Bear in mind that I'm 72, and I'm Australian (with an Australian billing address), and I'm currently in South Korea (where I'll be for a while). Those three pieces of information are relevant to what I have to say.KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9\"When I bought my Kindle Fire HD, I was actually on a trip to America. Naively, I thought that - having bought the Kindle Fire HD in America (although using my Australian billing address), I'd be able to download movies, for watching while I'm traveling around (which I do a lot). Moreover, I thought I would be able to join Amazon Prime, and have access to all the thousands of movies, and TV programs, that Prime members can download - just for their $79-per-year subscription. Also, I expected that I'd be able to get access to individual songs, as MP3 downloads.However, despite the fact that, as soon as I got my Kindle Fire HD, I was sent an e-mail from Amazon, telling me all the wonderful things I'd get as a Prime subscriber (including free 2-day shipping) - and giving me a one-month trial to boot - I could not, in fact, be a Prime member.  As soon as I tried to activate Prime, I was told that I was geographically restricted - couldn't even get one-track MP3 downloads. It seems that - to get into the Prime deal - one must have a US billing address, and a US home address.So that was a big disappointment. I was initially so miffed that I thought I'd return the Kindle Fire HD to Amazon, especially since I was still in the US at the time I found I would be subject to geographic restriction. But I kept the Kindle Fire HD because I realized that it was better for a few other functions, than either the Kindle Keyboard, or the Paperwhite.PLUS FACTORS for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\"1) AUDIOBOOKSIt seems that audiobooks don't have geographic restrictions, as movies, TV programs, and music have. So I've bought several audiobooks and, although the speakers aren't really powerful, they are powerful enough, if you are sitting in a quiet room, to hear the book reading very clearly. In addition, it's possible to use a bluetooth speaker, to get louder sound if it's wanted. Since I majored in English Literature - many years ago! - I'm on a mission to listen my way through all of the classics of the English language (which is so much more relaxing, via listening, than doing all that eye-wearing reading, with a hard-to-hold paperback that won't stay open at the pages you want it to). For example, I've just finished listening to \"The Great Gatsby\" and that was easy listening - except that the reader, Jake Gyllenhaal, wasn't able to project any sort of vocal personality for the all-important females - Daisy in particular. Just listening to Jake Gyllanhaal's effort to \"find\" a voice for Daisy (unsuccessfully) left me feeling there'd be no way that a listener/reader (who didn't already know the book well) could believe in Gatsby's obsession with a Daisy that the wish-washy unnoticeable voice personality that Jake Gyllenhaal's narration assigned to her.Given that it would surely not be easy for a man to render the voice of a young, upper-class, beautiful temptress, with any subtlety or authenticity, I think Audible should use cheaper unknown actors, so the budget could stretch to both a male and female narrator. What Audible seems to be doing is trying to tempt buyers by hiring big-name actors to do the narration. If Jake Gyllenhaal's no-impact rendition of Daisy is an example of the worth of using famous actors, it's a strategy that could backfire.2) MUSIC VIA THE AMAZON CLOUDAlthough I can't get single-track MP3 downloads, I can get instant music to the Kindle Fire HD, if I buy CDs (with AutoRip). As soon as you pay for those CDs - to be delivered to somewhere (anywhere for CDs - expensive shipping to Korea or Australia, but cheap to a friend in America, especially with free shipping for an order over $25), all of the songs are automatically delivered to your Kindle Fire HD (as well as to your PC, Kindle App, etc.) So I'm very happy with that - I've now got about 17 albums loaded up: everything from Vera Lynn and Frank Sinatra to Jackie Evancho and Josh Groban. As I write now, on my PC, I have \"David Foster: Hit Man and Friends\" playing in the background (on the Kindle Fire) - a bit away from me, rather than blasting out of the PC in front of me, to distract me.3) GADGET/SOFTWARE INSTRUCTION BOOKS (IN KINDLE FORMAT)Amazon has zillions of instruction books for IT gadgets and software programs: Kindle Fire HD itself, iPad, Android, Dropbox, Evernote, etc. For those sorts of instruction books - which have colored pictures, and screenshots, it's useless trying to learn from them, on a Kindle Keyboard, or Kindle Paperwhite: the pictures, tables, and screenshots don't translate well into black and white format, and the screens are too small to be able to get  \"pageful\" of text and graphics at the same time. I've never used a Kindle Fire 7\", but I'd expect that Kindle to also have a screen which is be too small for these kinds of instructions book. But the screen size of the Kindle Fire HD is perfect for showing pretty much the information (plus graphics) that would fit on the page of a real book - or on the iPad screen.A second advantage of having those gadget/software instruction books on the Kindle Fire HD is that you can keep the \"pages\" open on the Kindle Fire while you are trying out operations and techniques on, for example, the Kindle App on the iPad, or on the iPad itself. So it's really like having a book beside you.A third advantage is that, if you had those instruction books on an iPad, (for using as a reference book \"beside\" you, while you learn on another gadget), too much of the iPad charge is being used up to keep the books \"open\" for long periods of time. (It seems that the iPad gobbles up power a lot faster than the Kindle Fire HD does.) So, if you keep the iPad on its default auto-off setting (2 mins), to save the charge, it keeps turning itself off - unless you are actually touching the screen. The Kindle Fire HD stays \"on\" better, because there's not such a risk of running out of power too soon, if you leave it set at a higher time period for auto-off (such as 30 mins). Of course, it's possible to set both gadgets to \"Never\" to keep them on all the time you want that \"reference book\" open beside you - and I did that once, with the iPad. But I forgot to put it back to \"2 mins\" when I'd finished. So the iPad stayed on \"forever\" - presumably keeping a sensor fully employed, checking for Wifi hotspots wherever I went (even though it wouldn't have found many that I could connect to, since I don't have a cell-phone with a Wifi hotspot). The result was that, the next time I went to use the iPad - thinking it was still well charged - it was stone dead! Well, the Kindle Fire HD doesn't run out of charge as fast as the iPad, so it seems safe to leave it set on something like 30 minutes (auto-off) all the time - although it would probably be a good idea to set it back to 5 minutes, when finished using it.4)GOOD FONT/BACKGROUND COLOR OPTION FOR GLARE-SENSITIVE EYESI have eyes that are very sensitive to glare - white glare from screens, and glossy surfaces. The Kindle Fire HD, unfortunately, has a very glossy screen (compared to the Kindle Keyboard, and Kindle Paperwhite). But I've found a very good way to deal with that glare, such that I can comfortably read from the Kindle Fire HD screen. You can choose your default screen colours - with three options: black font on white background; black font on off-white (sort of like the Kindle Keyboard buff color), and white font on black background. I find that, even with the Kindle Fire HD's glossy screen, I can read very comfortably with that white lettering on a black background. It's a great way to reduce all the glare we get from white screens.NEGATIVE FACTORS for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\"1. GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTION FOR MOVIES, TV PROGRAMS, MP3 MUSIC DOWNLOADS, AND PRIMEOne big negative, for me, was outlined above: with an Australian bill-paying account, I can't download movies, TV programs, or MP3 music tracks - or be a member of Amazon Prime (although on my account screen, I keep getting messages that inform me I should join Prime, to reduce the shipping charges that I'm incurring - to Korea,mostly, and that's definitely not a free 2-day deal).2. KINDLE KEYBOARD AND KINDLE PAPERWHITE BETTER FOR READING LONG BOOKSDespite being able to set the screen for white lettering on a black background, it's nowhere near as comfortable to read lengthy books (such as novels) on the glossy KINDLE FIRE HD screen - and it's quite a bit heavier to hold up. For general book reading, I actually prefer the Kindle Keyboard best of all - with the e-ink off-white background that's not so glary, although it's handy to have back-lighting on the Paperwhite for reading at night, on airplanes.3. CAN'T PLACE YOUR ITEM ICONS WHERE YOU WANT TO PUT THEM, AND MAKE THEM STAY THERE!If you've got a lot of books loaded on to the Kindle Fire HD (and this is also relevant for the iPad Kindle App), you can't make them stay on the Home screen, in some order that suits you. It always happens that, as soon as you access one book, it comes to the top of the heap (so to speak), and so you've lost your grouping of similar kinds of books. In my case, I've got a bunch of RV books, many Instruction books for gadgets, various Travel guides, and Novels, etc. So it annoys the hell out of me when I've gone to the trouble to have all similar books \"sitting\" arranged beside each other, on the Home screen display. Then, as soon as I access one book, that book comes to the top of the display (or the beginning of the display), and will then end up mixed up with other books that are not in a similar category.Now, compare this with iBooks, on the iPad - which is excellent from this point of view.When you save a book for reading in iBooks, you can hold your finger on the book (or pdf) icon, and then move the icon to wherever you want it to be, in your collection. Subsequently, having placed each icon where you want it to be, it stays there - such that, every time you access that book (or pdf), or any other, the items go back \"to bed\" at the place on the \"bookrack\" where you put them. Not only does that allow you to keep all your collections grouped together, but it also facilitates developing a visual memory of where particular books or pdf files are, on the bookshelf - very useful if you've got a large collection of pdf files, and they all look pretty much alike, until you bring them up on to the reading screen where you can read the \"cover\" print more easily.This feature (or non-feature) is particularly a pain (on the Kindle iPad app), with Lonely Planet pdf files of their guidebooks. Lonely Planet has a few guidebooks as single-file pdf files. But, mostly, they supply the books as a bunch of separate chapters (like mini-books)- without an overall single-file pdf for the books that you've bought. So, just imagine what a mess you can get into with all those individual chapters - especially since the topics of the individual chapters can't easily be read until you bring them up fully on the screen. In addition, for almost all of the guidebooks that come in chapter bundles, the background colors are the same. Each country group of chapters has a unique picture on the cover of every chapter in the collection, but the pictures are small and you can't really see them until you bring a book (a chapter mini-book) up for reading.Consequently, you get a really messy situation because of Kindles (for the iPad app, or stand-alone Kindles)not allowing you to place your books, in the display, where you want them - and where they will return to after use. For instance, if I bring up a chapter of \"Nicaragua\" (out of perhaps 13 chapters), and then I bring up a chapter of \"Columbia\", and then one of \"Bolivia\" and also \"Peru\" - all of which I've got on my iPad (saved in both the Kindle App, and iBooks) - I end up with all of the chapters totally scrambled in the filing system; that occurs because no one chapter goes back to \"its place\" among the other chapters for the guidebook that it belongs to.So I have to use up more of my iPad's memory than I'd like, by saving all those chapter pdf files into both places: in iBooks, to keep the chapters where I want them to be \"filed\"; in the Kindle App, so I can access the contents page, touch on a topic in the contents, and get taken immediately wherever I choose to go. (With iBooks, for the same LP guide books, you can't access the contents page as a list, touch on a topic you want to go to, and be routed instantly to that topic - a very helpful feature of the Kindle App.)4. CAN'T USE THE AMAZON CLOUD TO COPY PDF FILES)FROM THE iPAD KINDLE APP TO THE KINDLE FIRE HD.When I buy those pdf files of guidebooks, from Lonely Planet (and they are not the same as buying Kindle-ized books of LP guidebooks - which are usually awful, with unreadable maps), I can save those pdf files to the Kindle App on the iPad, and that's fine - except for the mini-book chapters not staying where I want them to stay! However, the Amazon Cloud doesn't seem to allow me to then copy those pdf files on to the Kindle Fire HD - where I'd really like to have them.Imagine wandering around the back streets of just about any Latin American city (where I intend to be for some months of next year), with your iPad in your hand for consulting your off-Wifi guidebook. If you're foolish enough to be doing that - particularly an old woman like me - there's a pretty good chance some local desperado will grab the iPad and run. On the other hand, a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" would be a way less attractive trophy for a street-roaming snatcher (one who can tell an iPad from a Kindle Fire HD!); the Kindle Fire HD would also be much lighter for carrying around all day, and consulting; plus, even if the Kindle Fire HD does get grabbed, it's a whole lot cheaper to replace than an iPad.So I'd really like the Amazon Cloud to allow copying of pdf files from my iPad Kindle App, to my Kindle Fire HD. It's probably possible but I can't figure out how to do it. The Amazon Cloud doesn't seem to want to talk to anything not directly bought from Amazon, even if the pdf files are now \"in the Amazon system\" by virtue of being saved into the Kindle App on the iPad. .Now, here's the point of this for Amazon's bottom line. The Kindle Fire HD, as we all know, was designed to make it easy for all of us to buy Amazon books, audiobooks, movies, etc - although I, with an Australian billing address, can't manage to buy movies, TV programs, MP3 downloads (or join Amazon Prime). We know, and accept, that this gadget was definitely not dreamed up by Amazon, to facilitate open-sourced buying. But you would think that a Kindle App on an iPad would be able to talk to a stand-alone Kindle, via the Amazon Cloud. Seems not - friends only if Apple is the friendship broker.Nevertheless, it seems to me that Amazon could benefit from allowing Lonely Planet pdf files to be transferred, via the Amazon Cloud, to a Kindle Fire HD. Why? Well, as most people have probably discovered, it's nice to do all the travel research on an electronic gadget. But, when it comes to the boots-on-the-ground traveling, nothing beats having an actual dead-tree guidebook - extensively thumbed, and defaced with with notes, stickers on pages, and highlighted text. It's very difficult to have those user-friendly possibilities if you are interacting with any kind of tablet, except for trivialities - such as the best places to sleep or eat.Therefore, allowing Lonely Planet's pdf files to be uploaded on to one's Kindle Fire HD, from an iPad Kindle app, would probably produce sales, from Amazon, of the real books when the travel time comes. Why again? It's way cheaper to buy the actual LP books from Amazon than from Lonely Planet, even if you live in Lonely Planet's country: Australia. For me, the price of buying an LP guidebook, in Australia, is about twice the price that I'd pay from Amazon (with no shipping charge, if I was passing through America, on my way to all those Latin American countries, and had the books delivered to my USA-transit accommodation, before my arrival in America).For example, I made a trip just to San Francisco about three months ago and, despite having some LP chapters, for San Francisco, on my iPad (as pdf files - before my arrival), I still bought two other SF guidebooks, from Amazon, and had them delivered to the place I intended staying at, in SF. Plus, also from Amazon on that SF trip, I bought several real guidebooks for Japan: Tokyo, Kyoto, Walking in Japan, etc.So if Amazon allows the uploading of LP pdf files on to a Kindle Fire HP - as Amazon Cloud transfers from an iPad Kindle Fire app, it doesn't mean that Amazon will go broke supporting non-Amazon booksellers. In fact, by allowing such transfers, it just builds greater customer loyalty to Amazon, and its Kindles - AND it's pretty good advertising if little old ladies, like me, are wandering around Nicaragua, Columbia, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, and Costa Rica - and Japan - with their Kindle Fire HD's constantly on show. Amazon couldn't get that kind of advertising if the company paid for it!Therefore, I think there is a good reason for Amazon not to block pdf files from other publishers - especially from guidebook publishers, such as Lonely Planet, and especially if the pdf files are already in the Amazon system, saved into a Kindle App on an iPad..", "Title": "The icons won't stay where I put them, and the Amazon Cloud sometimes goes missing!", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "R3CFX2CRLKRCQY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire HD is a very good tablet for the price. I quickly bought the first generation Fire upon its release, and it was my first tablet. After using that smaller tablet for over a year, I decided to pick up the larger 8.9 inch HD model. After using it, I must say I actually prefer a smaller, 7 inch tablet. This is not a knock against the Kindle Fire HD 8.9, just a personal preference of mine regarding the size.The Pros:The price is a big selling point, in my opinion. I do not believe you can find another tablet this size for a cheaper price, but I may be wrong.The graphics and resolution are wonderful, and colors are very vibrant!The operating system is a step-up from first generation Kindles, but still not perfect (more on that in a bit).Some areas of content have a great selection! If you want to watch movies on your tablet, this is a great one to have! Amazon has a very good selection of films to rent or buy. And of course, don't forget about books. Amazon's selection of books is unmatched, and purchasing and downloading are very easy. I especially like how Kindles \"communicate\" between each other. For example, if I stop reading on my Kindle Fire HD, my other Kindle knows where I left off, which makes reading across devices very easy. The fact that all Kindles on an account sync with each other, if you want them to, is very helpful.The Cons:The app store just isn't very good. There are some decent games (my son enjoys many of them) but not anywhere close to the games available for Apple, or even Google Play for that matter. There are even fewer productivity apps, which is a big drawback for me. There also seems to be quite a few cheaply made, low quality bad apps. Because of this, the Fire is essentially a device to consume media on-that's it! If you're wanting to edit video or play around with photos, you'll be disappointed by the Fire.The camera is pretty weak, and is really only for video conferencing.The operating system, as noted elsewhere, is a heavily modified Android (and by heavily modified, I mean basically unrecognizable). I have an Apple phone, and love the iOS. I have never used a straight Android operating system, but only played around with devices. From my very limited experience, I think the unmodified Android is far better than what Amazon gives us on the Fire, and wish they would stop tinkering with it so much.Rumor has it a Kindle Fire HD 2 will be available later in 2013, and upon its release I look forward to seeing what improvements have been made. If enough enhancements have been done, I will most likely buy a 7 inch.

I don't know how many people really use it to browse the web. It's slow, inefficient. even with its much larger screen, I still prefer browse on my iphone use chrome.3. Even the native kindle book reader app, is not as good as on iOS. Though amazon brag it's audio book sync function, but i don't find that much useful for me. To activate the dictionary, you need to pinpoint your finger right on the words very precisely, I often find myself trying two or three times before get the right words I want to touch. But using Kindle app on iOS, I never had this problem. Guess it's mostly due to the kindle fire operating system amazon stocked.4. Battery life is a pain as well. I didn't tested seriously, but in my impression, it's way worse than ipad2. I used ipad2 more than this kindle fire hd, but charge ipad2 less frequently.5. The audio quality is a selling point when Bezos introduce this kindle fire hd in the keynotes, but I have to say, when watching videos, I always felt the sound is too little and it feels like the sound goes away from me (rather than towards me). Speakers are on the back, maybe that's the reason. But why ipad2 doesn't give me this feeling? I am so confused.All in all, you get what you paid for.

I was easily able to explore the Fire, as the quick tutorial explained what was needed to get started. I loaded a number of books, lots of music and apps, and some pictures. I am thrilled that this device can be loaded with my personal pictures. It was extremely easy to do through the cloud. And they look fantastic!I checked out the sound. Dang, Green Day and Pink sounded absolutely awesome coming through the Dolby speakers! No, it doesn't sound like a Bose sound system, but come on....this is a tablet. I think it sounds fabulous. Haven't tried it with headphones yet, but I will.I then played on the reading app. Love it! Though I do most of my reading on my Kindle Keyboard and Paperwhite, it will be very easy to read on this device. Everything was crisp and clear...I especially like the sepia background; it's very easy on the eyes.Now we come to the apps. No, not all of the apps I had on the original Fire would load onto the Fire HD. Nor did I expect them too. And I frankly don't care. If I want to play them, I'll play on the original Fire. Rooting? Side loading? Huh? Nope, don't even want to attempt that. I'm very pleased with the content I can get for my device from Amazon. I bought this tablet for entertainment purposes. And I know as time goes by, more apps will be adapted to work for the Fire HD. The 8.9\" screen makes such a huge difference when playing apps. I no longer worry about going blind playing Mahjong on my smaller screen!I then decided to check out some TV episodes I bought. Copper looks fantastic on the HD screen! I also checked a Prime movie - X-ray is such an awesome idea. No more going crazy trying to figure out who is playing a particular role; I just look it up without having to go to the web. Watching movies is truly a beautiful experience on the Fire HD. I haven't used HDMI (did I type that correctly?). I don't have an HD TV. Besides, I like to watch on my 8.9\" screen.My Yahoo and Hotmail e-mail accounts were easily set up. I like the e-mail app on the Fire HD better than the one on the original Fire. I went to the browser and put my favorite websites on and bookmarked them. This device is much faster than the Fire. I will admit that the browser locked up and reset a few times. I'm using a stylus, and sometimes I tap more than I should (which I did on the original Fire because I had to). I'm getting used to the screen, though, and it's happening less as time goes by. And I have had tabs not respond; but they recover so quickly, it's a total non-issue for me.I believe Amazon Prime is a MUST if you own this device. Besides the free shipping on millions of items, you WILL want the free Prime TV shows and movies to get the most out of your Fire HD.I highly recommend the Fire HD 8.9\" 32GB with no hesitation whatsoever. I mentioned some of the asinine reviews I read and would like to touch on a few points. If you read the product description, you will know what this device can and cannot do. Unless you live under a rock, I don't know how anyone doesn't know that Adobe no longer supports flash and is no longer used on new android devices. And I can't say I know absolutely for sure what flash is, but I know I don't miss it! Same goes for the device not coming with a charger; it's not listed in what comes in the box, and it has been discussed here more than once.. Someone said his Fire HD had sharp edges. Eh? Still trying to figure that one out! The edges of mine are very nicely rounded, thank you very much. There's no forward facing camera! Call me crazy, but if I want to take pictures, I use a camera (or my cell phone if it's a \"photo emergency\"). Reviews have downgraded the device because of packaging or delivery times. Sorry, but what does that have to do with the performance of the device? There were also the reviews that were not reviews of the Fire HD, but were plugs for their favored Nook or Apple devices. Then there are the defectivebydesign mindless Zombie reviews. No comment. But my favorite bad review was the guy who couldn't stand touchscreen devices. Then why the heck did you order one that you KNEW was a touchscreen device?!?!?!Get one of these babies for yourself and check it out.

I ordered the 8.9\" after my original Kindle messed up in a major way. Before I go into the details about this product, I must give a shout-out to Amazon's customer service team for the excellent way they treated me when my first Kindle messed up. It was almost out of warranty, but they still sent me this particular item at a deep discount. They were very polite about everything, and I got it 2 days later. I am now a loyal Amazon customer.This particular Kindle's screen is bigger and clearer, it has dual speakers on the back, and comes with the option of turning on Dolby Digital Stereo from the Kindle screen's menu. It has volume controls on the side which enable you to change the volume in a hurry if need be or if you don't want to mess up your viewing experience with the drop-down volume screen. By the way, it appears to sound better when laid on a table than when it is being held up. It has dual plug-in ports: an hdmi port and a charger port. The problem I have with this is that they are very similar looking in size. One is just slightly bigger than the other. So please be careful when plugging it into the charger and make sure you use the right one. Overall I am really satisfied with this product.As to small details having to do with customization, the only drawbacks are that this particular model does not support Go Launcher or allow wallpaper apps to work. ADW launcher works just fine however, if you don't care for the carousel-style screen and want something even more tablet-like. It is a bit more delicate than the original first generation so I would be careful about letting a child play around with it. If you have a child and want to get them their first real tablet, I would go with the original 7\" Kindle 1st generation. It just seems to be more durable and thicker and seems to be up to the task of being treated slightly rough.", "Title": "Ahhh Yiss", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "Gina M Rollin \"Gina R.\"", "ReviewID": "R3H5XSPE2DDWOE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For anyone who requires screen reading software don't let the \"Accessability\" of this product lead you on.

The Kindle Fire offers all of these things and is cheaper than an IPad so I took the plunge. Here is what I found for those activitiesGoogling - It comes with Bing as the default but I prefer Google (or at least I am most used to it).  It was easy to switch.GMail - This was where I had frustration.  There is a mail app that includes Gmail but I kep getting an error message.  I googled looking for reasons and got the idea that several people have the same problem but still no luck.  Yesterday I decided to try going into gmail by googling Gmail and used the login site.  I had to answer security questions because I was using a different \"device\" but once I did that, I was in.  Later, I tried the Gmail app and it worked just fine.Facebook - It is easy to get into and works but I am hoping to figure out how to change some of the settings.

Of course, I researched this tablet when it was announced as well as read reviews after its release. This is my 4th Kindle.  I have had my new Kindle Fire for about a month now, and it is definitely a keeper.  I will touch on a few issues below that have been mentioned in other reviews.THE CHARGER (or lack thereof):  I knew from research that it would come only with a USB cord for charging.  I have other chargers (one for the original Kindle Fire) but opted to purchase the PowerFast Charger for the \u00bd off price of $9.99 which is an option for everyone who purchases this tablet through Amazon.  The location of the charging port on the device does not bother me because I can just turn it upside down while charging and watch a movie easily without it being in the way.FLASH PLAYER:  I\u2019m not going to say much about this except that there is a work-around for this by downloading an older version of Flash.  Read the comments on other reviews for details.DESIGN:  Fabulous is all I can say.  It is just the right size, not too small, not too big.  Thin and lightweight.  I purchased the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9 case for $54.99.  It has a low profile and I like that.  I also have one of those AmazonBasics Netbook Bag for 7 to 10 inch tablets with a handle.  It carries my Kindle 8.9 (in the case I mentioned above), USB charger, and PowerFast Charger, whenever I am traveling.PICTURE QUALITY:  Fantastic, sharp, crystal clear movies and shows.  The high definition is really obvious when compared to my original Kindle Fire.  A++ in this area, Amazon!!WiFi:  I had no problems setting up WiFi.  After inputting my router security code, it recognized it and connected immediately.  I tested streaming a movie in the opposite side of the house where the signal is the lowest.  When streaming a movie on Netflix on my ORIGINAL Kindle Fire, it would sometimes lag and show a \u201cbuffering\u201d message, but on the NEW Kindle Fire HD 8.9, there was NO lag or slowdown of streaming the same movie.  Movies and shows stream seamlessly and I have no connection issues, even low signal areas.SOUND QUALITY:  Dolby sound is very nice as well, however, 90% of the time, I use headphones.CAMERA:  For my use, the camera is a nice add-on, but I don\u2019t intend to take pictures with this camera, anyway.  I have an iPhone for that and with this Kindle HD 8.9, it has the ability to import your photos from other mobile devices (iPhone?) and Facebook or Twitter directly to your tablet.  Love that feature!  I would primarily use this camera for Skype, probably.4G LTE WIRELESS:  This seems to be a bit issue with a lot of folks.  I\u2019ll admit that I was attracted to the $49 one-time fee for a year\u2019s worth of 250MB/month 4G LTE Wireless coverage.  But I knew that 250MB would not be enough for me.  We have 3 iPhones in our family through AT&T.;  So I went to the AT&T; store with my Kindle.  I dropped my current family plan and changed to a Mobile Share Plan which gave me 10 gigs of data per month for 3 iPhones and 1 Kindle Fire Tablet.  My hubby and son don\u2019t use much data at all, and I use maybe 3 gigs per month.  So, in my world, this is a win-win and I\u2019m spending only about $30.00 more every month for 10 gigs of data.  As you may recall, the other options given on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 during 4G setup were 3 gigs for $30 a month and 5 gigs for $50 a month.  I\u2019m getting 10 gigs for $30 a month.  Thank you AT&T;!!!PRICE DIFFERENCE:  OK, stay with me on this......I compared the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 32 gig for $369 and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 4G LTE Wireless for $499.  This is a difference of $130.  So you pay $130 more for the same high end, 32 gig model just to include the 4G LTE capability.  THEN, the average person signs up for the $49.99 for the first year 4G LTE Wireless for 250MB of data per month.  So you are paying $179.99 MORE for this Kindle Fire HD 8.9 4G LTE Wireless just to get this feature.Now, when you look on AT&T;\u2019s site, to get a data plan for a tablet equal to 250MG per month, it normally cost the average person $14.99 a month for this data plan.  This amount times 12 months equals $179.88.  So, really, AT&T;, is getting their money in the long run because Amazon is probably forking over most, if not all, of the profit they receive selling the 4G LTE version of the tablet to AT&T.;  Amazon probably views this as an acceptable loss because they know that they will recoup this amount plus more when people purchase media from their website.  Of course, this is only speculation on my part, but, it does sound feasible, doesn\u2019t it?So, in my opinion, this tablet exceeds my expectations.  NO disappointments, NO frustrations, and NOT a waste of money, as many would claim in the 1 star reviews.  You just have to know what YOU need in a tablet, and know WHAT you are buying.  This is a media consumption device, pure and simple.

I've had my first generation Kindle Fire and have been happy with it but I wanted more space for more apps and a larger screen.  The 8.9 HD 32 GB had that and it is proving to be a great investment for our family.  It is faster, clearer (HD) and just operates better overall.  I have had a few glitches but they are because of apps, not the Kindle itself.  The apps on this thing are awesome, much better quality-viewing than the smaller, older Kindle Fire we own.  I'm enjoying that we can stock up on apps and aren't in danger of running out of space.I still prefer to read books on the smaller, first generation Kindle Fire because it is more comfortable to hold for longer periods of time and laying down.  I use the 8.9 HD Kindle Fire for email, calendar, web and the apps and occasionally a video (which is pretty much flawless in playback on the 8.9 HD).  It has made my life simpler and more productive to just check my email or the web for something and then put it back down instead of having to sit down at my computer to check email, which usually ends up leading to mindless surfing.One thing I didn't anticipate that would be a real winner was FreeTime, which is a service you can pay monthly for to turn the Kindle into a child's device.  We are finding that it is a winner with our daughter.

It's not worth it.  Wait for a sale or a refurbished unit under $150.The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is a decent piece of hardware that is diminished by its user interface.  People who have never used a tablet may not be bothered by the interface, but those familiar with real Android smartphones and tablets are likely to be annoyed by a design that so clearly promotes shopping and consumption of Amazon's digital content.  Yes, I know, the primary purpose of the Kindle is to encourage more purchases from Amazon, but the sales focus is excessive.When you install a free app from Amazon's app store, you receive an e-mail confirmation of your $0.00 purchase.  Overkill.The special offers on the start-up screen are no problem.  They go almost unnoticed among all the other sales pitches.Other observations: -  The 8.9\" size is easier to hold in the hand than a 10.1\" tablet, and it is lighter. -  The display is sharp, making it easy to see detail on Google maps, for example. -  The dual-band radio is great if you have a dual-band \"n\" or an \"ac\" wireless router. -  Works well with Bluetooth Android keyboard. -  No option to use an SD card, because Amazon wants you to use its cloud for storage. -  Short battery life when in active use; keep a charger handy. -  The real Android OS provides many more configuration options than does the simplified Kindle OS.Fortunately, the Kindle Fire's operating system can be replaced.  So, within 48 hours of starting to use the Kindle, I had converted mine to run as a real tablet with Android 4.2.2.  It's a nice Android tablet.  The excellent screen and decent internals make the Kindle a good value if you can get it for less than full price.  Note:  A DIY conversion to Android is technically challenging.

I was looking for a tablet that is larger than 7\" so I more easily  read and watch a bit of Netflix. In my old age, my eyes aren't what they used to be so a larger screen helps.  The 8.9\" kindle fits that bill perfectly.  Not too big and not too small. Being refurbished didn't bother me since it still came with the same warranty and Amazon is very good about standing behind their products.I got the package from Amazon before it was promised. It included a USB cable and nothing else. If you want to charge the tablet in wall outlet, you'd have to use your own standard USB charger or purchase another one. It doesn't come with any manual, but the Kindle OS is very intuitive and easy to use.If you use the kindle for reading, Netflix or other light duty apps, the kindle will serve you well. I also have a Nexus 7 (1st gen) and the Nexus is a bit peppier than the Kindle, but not by much. Plus the Kindle's screen is far superior to my Nexus 7. The Kindle OS is very easy to navigate although a bit cluttered IMHO.  The \"Special Offers\" are basically advertisements on the lock screen. They are not intrusive at all and sometimes the offers are quite compelling.I wanted to install apps that are only available in Google Play and not available in the Amazon apps store. I therefore rooted the Kindle and modded it to a generic Android KitKat tablet.  It is working just great and I can now install and run apps from Google Play and the Amazon Appstore. I installed the Kindle app from Google play, so I didn't lose any functionality by rooting.Overall, I am very happy with the Kindle purchase, especially at the price I got it at.", "Title": "Great Price for a Fine Tablet", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Author": "Vivette Webb", "ReviewID": "R3V3CMFBUL3212", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was kinda disappointed with the Kindle because I thought I would be be able to get more games on it.Try to get that situated and I will be happy.", "Title": "It's OK", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Author": "Carol Shattuck", "ReviewID": "R15AGRW00WAZ0S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "On my replacement as the original kept freezing up,jumping from one app to another.

And since Adobe will not allow Kindle to use flash, Kindle has an experimental way of viewing the shows via the cloud. It can be challenging to get a TV show to play to say the least. There are some really cool apps. But they are somewhat limited. Since Kindle is so proprietary and Google is a competitor, you miss out on a lot of apps.

On the plus side, it's lightweight and I find myself using it to look things up far more than I ever did with my notebook pc because of it's portability! The carousel on the homepage lets you keep whichever of your apps that you use the most readily available.While there are many other features that I like, I feel that if I was reading a product review, I'd be looking for the downside of it when making my decision as to whether or not to purchase it. First off, I found that Amazon makes a good portion of their money by charging for EVERYTHING! I was immediately annoyed to see that no direct electrical outlet charger was included with it! Instead, it came with one that charges through my pc & takes 5x longer...but you can always purchase the better one at the Amazon store, which your Kindle has a direct link to on it's homepage! The same holds true for the case ($50.), screen protector (I found this necessary due to all the fingerprints left on the screen no matter HOW much I washed my hands before touching it!) & stylus. But one of my most important discoveries which would have affected my decision to purchase the Kindle was something I only learned quite recently: you CANNOT USE ANYONE ELSE'S APPS W/O MAKING AN ADJUSTMENT WHICH VOIDS YOUR WARRANTY!!! I believe that this one item is probably something that anyone considering purchasing a Kindle should first be aware of before buying!

It made it only $80 more than the most expensive reader. I had previously owned a Kindle reader with a navigation button. When the button quit working I was unable to use the reader anymore. I began looking for a new Kindle and was unsure which one to purchase. My 10 yr old has a Samsung tablet which I have used on occasion and I find it easy to navigate. I have a Kindle app on my laptop which I used regularly but some books I wanted to check out of the library would only download to a Kindle and not a Kindle app per the publishers guidelines. So when Amazon put the Kindle Fire on sale I decided to get the HD so I could read and also use the internet and play games. I bought the 16 GB with Wi-Fi because I didn't want to pay for a wireless plan and we have Wi-Fi at home. When it arrived I opened it and put it in the case I had purchased and immediately began to use it. It is so easy. The screen is very responsive to finger taps and swipes, maybe even more so than the Samsung. I never have any trouble with my internet connection and pages load very quickly. At 39 I am in what I guess you would call the in between generation. Computers became a household item when I was a teenager and has progressed from there. I didn't cut my teeth on technology but I find it easy to comprehend and this Kindle is very easy for me. My 5, 3, & 2 year old all love to play games on it and read books. My 10 year old wants to play on it too. If you want a Kindle for reading but also spend time online and play games then this is for you.

Flash is NOT supported on this particular device, and you cannot side-load it.  Well, you can side-load it, but it will not function.  So don't bother trying.I wanted an inexpensive, large-screen tablet that would allow me to watch anything on You Tube, a live-stream of one of my local news stations, and view the magazines to which I subscribe in digital form...all without paying any monthly fees, or even one-time fees.  I thought this tablet was for me.Well, there is no real app for You Tube, so that's out. If you go to You Tube's website, you can't watch anything because, like I wrote, Flash is not supported on this device.  (It is supported on some other Kindles, but NOT the HD 8.9\")  And, I could not watch a live-stream of my favorite local news because, again, no Flash!  (Adobe's problem, not Kindle!  Shame on them!)I found some of my magazines (for free) in their digital form, because I'm already a print subscriber, they were free.  Most of the other magazines were viewable IF I paid for a year's digital subscription. No thanks. I'm not paying twice.Since this Kindle device doesn't support all Android apps, there is a chance may apps you may have on your Droid or IOS phone will NOT be available on the Kindle...so make SURE that this will do what you want it to do before you buy it.  Seemed like there were a lot of \"silly\" apps and lots of games. If that's what you like, then you will probably like this tablet.  Or if you're into books, you may find what you're looking for.  (I'm not a big reader, so I didn't investigate books available)Lesson-learned for me...I should have checked into it all a lot more.

I do not like the fact that there is no Adobe flash but that I can live with since I can use my phone if I want to see a video but I am totally disgusted with the silk browser. It is constantly unresponsive and when I try to share something on Facebook it takes about 5 minutes. I have cleared my history and have even started back from factory settings and nothing helps. I tried the dolphin browser which is a little better but not much.

The plug is in a terrible place as I keep it sideways all the time and as a result the plug is in the bottom so it is hard to use this Kindle while it is plugged in.

Of course it's a problem on a Nook since they are the competition, which is too bad because the Nook tablet has an amazing screen).The size is a nice in-between the 7\" and 10\".

The 7\" tablets and 6\" eReaders that are out there have too small a screen for me for extended use.  At the price a refurb of the 8.9 HD was offered on sale, I thought it would be worth trying out.  It's a pretty good reader for pdfs, although there isn't any ability to change font size unless you try to convert pdfs into Kindle format via email, which is a hit and miss process.  The screen is fantastic for reading MS docs, very sharp and the 8.9 size makes reading long docs a breeze.I also looked at the ability to watch video (TV and movies) through my Prime account.  The screen is great for that as well, but apparently you can only stream free content.  You can't download unless you pay, which makes this device less desirable for airplane viewing.  Google Play on my 7\" Android tablet seems to have a more interesting selection of movies for rental.So the Kindle Fire 8.9 HD is a very good to fantastic device as an e-reader and a pretty good device for watching TV shows and movies.  But as a tablet for apps it isn't good.  Basically, Amazon has defanged the Android OS to make this device work best as an Amazon product delivery system.  Standard apps for Android, like Google Navigation, aren't available.  There are many key apps I use on my Android 7\" tablet and Apple iPhone that aren't available.  Everything seems to be oriented toward buying books, movies, TV shows, and apps through Amazon.  It's more than a bit annoying, and the OS used isn't nearly as slick as you'd find with a pure Android or Apple tablet.I'll be happy to use this as a reader for book-length manuscripts.  The quality and size of the screen hold a lot of appeal to me.  But I'll keep using my iPhone and Android 7\" tablet for apps.

But I certainly like it. It has drawbacks, mostly the stupid carousel interface. I just splurged another fifteen bucks to get rid of the \"special offers\" so maybe the interface will be less annoying now.However, the display is fine, operations are quick, sound is good (through headphones or small external speakers), and I'm enjoying streaming Amazon Prime video on the FIre HD. I've been able to load (by USB) some instructional video files and some photos onto the tablet, which I like being able to view without needing to be online.I knew it would be an upgrade from my old Kindle Fire, but have been delighted by the improved performance.I was able to snag the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Standing Leather Case, Saddle Tan during a Lightning Deal on the same day I bought my discounted refurb HD, which was a lucky buy.

After utsing it over time it tends to get slower.
