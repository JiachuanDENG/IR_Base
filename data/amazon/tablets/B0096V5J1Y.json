So far, my wife has been able to keep her hands on the new Mini without the grandkids hogging it.My wife likes the Mini because:It runs the same apps as the iPad 2 does.It is smaller and fits on the table beside her chair better than the iPad 2 did.It is lighter than the iPad 2.  This is important because the OtterBoxes add significant weight to the iPads.  (We would never have an iPad without a case because of the risk of the grandchildren dropping them.)It works very well for what she does: FaceBook, Pinterest, searching the Internet and simple games.I like that it runs iOS 7 and the cameras are better than on the iPad 2.Much has been said about the low resolution of the screen on the original iPad Mini.  That is not a problem for us with the way we use our iPads.  I suppose if you used it for viewing a lot of videos, that might matter.  But, that is what we use our TVs for.The iPads have been very appreciated by the members of this household.  The grandchildren do use the larger iPads for videos and have not complained about the low resolution of the screens.  We currently have an iPad (1st generation), iPad 2, iPad 4th generation and the iPad Mini.  What we like about the iPads are the wide variety of apps available (many free ones) and the fact that they actually work.Prior to getting into the world of iPads, we had 3 different Android tablets which had a variety of problems:The Android tablets:Did not use Google Play.  Two of them required downloads from a PC to install apps.One had a resistive screen, which was hard to use.Two frequently froze up.  One had a reset hole an ear ring pin could be placed in.  The other simply had to be left alone for the battery to run down.While people complain about the iPads not accepting SD cards, we had problems with our Android devices not allowing all of the apps to be installed on the SD cards.We are very happy with all of our iOS devices (including 3 iPhones and 3 iPod Touches) because they work as they should.UPDATE:I forgot to state that I also especially like the new Lightning connector the Mini and the iPhone 5 has.  It is much easier to connect to the device than the old 30 pin connector or a mini USB connector that so many devices use.  With the Lightning connector, either side can be placed up when connecting to the device.  The old 30 pin can be difficult to connect without actually looking at the connector and device.", "Title": "iPad Mini Rocks!", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Author": "Jr&Ethansmom", "ReviewID": "R1V6W73FOKPBOX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Both of my children have high functioning ASD. I have been looking for educational tools to help them learn and function better as well as make their lives a little bit easier. I have tried puzzles, leapfrog, vetch products  and even a different off name tablet (which was a complete nightmare). I always wanted to stay clear of apple products because I know of many friends that had to Jailbreak their iPhones to get around Apples strict restrictions (not to mention price); so the ipad was my last resort. After my children's schools sent home numerous reports on how well my children were working with the ipad, as well as their occupational and speech therapists strongly suggesting apps that could only be found on the apple store I broke down and bought the ipad mini. I am very glad I did! Not only did I find great apps for them that they love, I found several for myself that has made biology class a breeze. I'm a bit disappointed that I couldn't get the blue tooth to work with my Android cell phone (another one of Apples restrictions I assume) but In my case I didn't buy this product for the blue tooth or its communication features. I bought this product as a learning tool and it has done the job. :)", "Title": "Great fo ASD!", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Author": "JIsaacs8", "ReviewID": "RLXRPX79Z1N1I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my iPad Mini.  I was using my iPhone for everything you can imagine and it was draining my phone battery.  Whenever I got a call, it would kick off my game or whatever app I was running.  Now that I have the iPad, I pretty much only use my phone as a phone and I can talk while still using my apps.  Another thing I noticed while using my iPhone was the considerable amount of eye strain it was causing.  The larger screen on the iPad mini is perfect.  I also like the size of the mini versus the regular iPad.  It's small enough to tote around with me where ever I go and it sits nicely on the couch arm if you have a case that props it up.  I highly recommend the iPad if you want a larger gaming area for games such as Hay Day and Candy Crush.", "Title": "Save your phone battery and use the iPad Mini", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Author": "Abdullah Abdulghani", "ReviewID": "R9S2KE6C904DN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ipad mini was just like new in very excellent condition.

I owned a 1st and now a 4th generation standard versions.  As a tablet there is no better choice.I recently tested out the mini, and while it has all the same amazing features as the standard, I have to say I do not prefer the smaller size.  I get that people need something more portable, and for you this might be a great choice.  I however use mine for watching videos when I am out and about, so I found myself missing the screen size.If you need something more portable and just smaller, then get this, otherwise go get the 4th generation iPad.  Honestly though, either way you will be happy.", "Title": "Still iPad Quality Although I Missed the Larger Screen", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Author": "Jenette", "ReviewID": "R2QM06RIRD6JQG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad Mini manufactured by Apple has been the best purchase I have made so far in electronics. A 7.9 inch display touch screen, my iPad Mini is white but it is also available in black glass from and a aluminum back. It has cameras built in the front & back. The way it sounds when it plays music its great, its very loud but it also has an headphones jack build in so when you want to listen to music just to yourself. This device is so easy to carry around it only weights 10.9 ounces compared to other device that is very lite, its almost like your caring just a lite reading book. It has other great features like over 275,000 apps to download from the app store, Face Time where you can video call someone from any other Apple device and much more. Compared to other tablets like the Galaxy Tablet 2, Kindle Fire and even the iPad 2 that's manufactured by the same company I think the iPad Mini is the best. Starting with the Galaxy tablet, it has some features that are the same as the iPad Mini but not all. The Galaxy Tablet 2 is manufactured by Samsung it has a 10.1 screen, its a black colored tablet, weights 1.28 lbs that's 0.59 pounds more than the iPad mini. The only good thing it might have better than an iPad mini it is its battery lifetime, an iPad mini can hold up to 10 hours and an Galaxy Tablet 2 holds up to 14 hours. Every other feature the iPad has better. Second tablet to compare the iPad Mini to is the Kindle Fire. The Kindle is a 8.9 in display screen, it weights 20 ounces, storage varies on amount you want from 16GB to 32 GB. While iPad had an storage amount that goes from 16GB to 64GB this shows that the iPad has more storage available than the Kindle. Yes it has a few similarities as the iPad mini but the app store in the kindle is not the best, it has a few selections to choice from. Another thing to know about the Kindle is that this tablet is more of a online book reading tablet. Third tablet to compare it to is the iPad 2, a tablet that was made by the same manufacturer. An iPad mini is better than the iPad two in many different ways. One example is its weight the iPad mini weights 10 ounces while the iPad 2 is weighting at 1.22 pounds. Less weight is always better, you don't want to carry a device that's to big because then you'll get tired faster. The manufacturer comes up with an improvement in their tablets for a reason. The iPad mini came out after the iPad 2 but was a better success. Another example is Sire If you don't know what that is Siri is a feature that lets you use your voice tell it to do things like send messages, place phone call and other things. Size was a big change in the manufactures design in the iPad mini, they made it smaller and more portable for the buyers.  As you can tell the iPad mini is a better and improved tablet that apple manufacture has build after iPad 2. I have purchased the iPad mini and I'm so happy that I've purchased such a wonderful device. I've had such bad experience with tablets. They either are too big, heavy and there aren't much apps to choose from. But I've had best experience with this device it is so easy to work, I have many apps to choose from and its very lite to carry. I totally love the camera pixels, my pictures and videos are so clear. I paid a little bit over $300 dollars for my iPad mini but it was worth every penny. I recommend anybody that is going to buy a tablet to get an iPad mini. I know for a fact they will not regret it because I don't. This iPad mini is with me at all times and it's useful. I take it with me to class, its features let me take notes and save them when I don't feel like writing them on paper or when I don't have a utensil to write with. When it comes to me to remembering things I'm not the best at. But being able to use the iPad mini's Calendar is useful, I can type in reminders of events or anything that needs to be done on a certain day to remind me. There is so much that you can do with the iPad mini that its so amazing. I remember when I was running to class late I was rushing putting things in my backpack not realizing that I had forgot the most important thing for that class, the reading book. I arrived to class, I sat down I began taking out my things that's when I realized that I forgot my book on my bed. I didn't know what to do the teacher was very strict on being prepared for class, she didn't like people sharing books. As I was pulling my iPad mini I thought about an idea. I turned on my WiFi and began to browse the internet looking for an online book I was able to find one. I was so happy the iPad mini saved me. If it wasn't for that iPad mini I would have been lost in class and the teacher would have made me look like a fool in front of the class if she would have seen me not participating and not having a book.

I have to say, I am very pleased with this product as it is perfect for a student who is constantly on the go, like myself. It\u2019s thin, light weight, and very portable. It fits perfectly in my purse (even with a Defender Series Otterbox on it) and keeps its charge through my school day MUCH better than my laptop!The only minor drawback is, if you\u2019re like me and have an iPhone, you\u2019re going to see a noticeable difference in the crispness of the display. I never had a regular sized iPad, but from what I understand, the reason the images aren\u2019t as perfect is because the iPad Mini doesn\u2019t have the retina display. Again, to me this was a really minor drawback, and it doesn\u2019t change my 5 star rating. I also had a strange problem getting my iPad Mini to connect to my Apple iTunes account so I could use iMessage and FaceTime. The problem somehow solved itself about 24 hours after activating it\u2026 Not sure what the problem was, but it hasn\u2019t been an issue since.I also just updated it with the new iOS 7 software, and it looks and operates perfectly! No glitches so far, and it\u2019s looking like there won\u2019t be any!I would definitely recommend this product to college students who - like me - are tired of carting around their laptops, only to have the battery die in the middle of class!", "Title": "Absolutely PERFECT!", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Author": "Kitty Kat", "ReviewID": "R3QK2Q1V4RK0TH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a surprise for my wonderful husband and he simply loves it and has not put it down since it was delivered", "Title": "Lovin it", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Author": "Briggs", "ReviewID": "R3MJ0OE81Y5WH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Android just doesn't compare.

My IPhone was enough.A few more years, along with a few more iPad versions go buy & THEN......there was the mini!!!I was intreguied and found this new version something I possibly see myself enjoying. I loved my iPhone and had lots of apps that kept me from ever being bored but every once in awhile I wished the screen was bigger....like when drawing in an art app and such....Unfortunately the iPad was only one BIG size and more than I needed or wanted.The mini was perfect!! Just a little bigger than my iPhone making most apps the perfect size to see great & enjoy playing or working more but still small enough to comfortably take anywhere. OHHH and the WEIGHT!!! SOOOOOO much lighter than iPad. Plus I've been playing with it for awhile now and love everything about it.I got the White 64gb Wifi only iPad Mini and now I need a stylus. Anyone know which is good?My first & only iPad and I'm extremely happy. I just wish I could control my app buying/testing since I'm using a lot of space and there is no larger storage than the 64mb but I'm so thankful I got this size! LoL______________________________________________________________________________><><><>~~ U P D A T E Jan. 9, 2014 ~~<><><>< PROBLEM with tablet______________________________________________________________________________A few months ago my beloved iPad Mini started acting up and will no longer work unless plugged into the wall for power. It will be charged and say 100% on battery but as soon as the plug is removed, the battery icon shows that its in the RED on the lock screen and needs to be charged. I've tried every solution available on Internet and this \"problem\" conveniently began the minute it's 1 year warranty expired. So I have no idea what else to do except use it only while I'm near an outlet to keep it connected to which completely changes the portability aspect of the device.Ive had a few different iPhones and iPod Touches over the years with no major troubles so when I finally decided to join the iPad craze, I had nothing but positive thoughts from my own experiences and from friends who have been using them. I was wrong! Needless to say, I was/AM disappointed and the fact that its my FIRST and ONLY iPad is not helping the situation AT ALL!I'm outta luck though......I can't afford to purchase a new one and I can't sell this one in this condition. I've run outta solutions to try,,, so for now I'm just thankful that it works at all (hope it continues!) and just keep it plugged in to use it.I'll continue to search the web for others dealing with same issue and hopefully someone, somewhere, will have a solution out there for me that works. :::crossing my fingers:::::I expected more than a year out of this device (especially for the price!). I can honestly say, I took extremely great care of this iPad as I do with everything I own. I'm always careful with electronics especially but this particular tablet was specifically meant to only use at home, for quiet leisure days and at bedtime. I never even took it out of my house. It sat on my table or wherever until I was ready to use it (mainly bedtime). So I can only guess it was already defective when I got it.Anyway, just thought I'd post here in case anyone else has this problem or wonders if anyone has/had this problem.", "Title": "LOVED my iPad Mini!  ~ U P D A T E!!!", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Author": "Celeste Thoms \"Moviemaker330\"", "ReviewID": "R24CHXT96ZR1NG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was reluctant to get one at first. I already had an iPad 2 (2nd generation) and the specks didn't seem all that great compared to the newer iPads. However, I like the idea of the size because I love playing games and reading books on mine. So I got one and it did not disappoint. I'm really glad I got the smaller one. It's so light. It feels just a little heavier than my iPhone 4. I can read for a long time with it in my hands without getting tired. I can play games and the graphics are stunning. The battery is really good. I can still use the iPad for an hour or more even when it's at 15%. I use it all day without needing a recharge. What I liked about my larger iPad is that it was like a laptop. I could write my screenplays on it. The keypad on the mini is of course smaller, which makes it hard to type on. However, with the dictation feature I haven't been writing a whole lot. I really love that feature and comes in handy if you don't want to type on such a small device. I also use a wireless keyboard. Lastly, there isn't a lot of space on the sides of the device to hold it without touching the screen. It's still very light so I can grip the device in one hand which I like better.Basically the iPad mini has all the features of a regular iPad. It's a matter of what size you want to get.

And I AM LOVING IT.The weight: Heavier than a Kindle but only slightly so. It's perfect to throw in your purse, to read books, to do email and to watch movies and videos.Screen: Quality of the screen, the colors, the text, it's high tech, top notch and even over the top gorgeous.Battery life: So far so good. I've had it for weeks, charged only once, been using it 2-3 hours a day some days a lot less.... it varies.For reading books, it's great but I tend to read PDF documents here and still read my major books on the Kindle but of course you can switch on your Kindle app and keep reading on the iPad.Love the size and weight the most. So glad to own this little puppy. >SPLURGE.

I bought the 32 GB mini and stores I checked out the Fire said the most memory offered at this time is 16 GB! They offered to preorder a 32 GB Kindle Fire for me, but the fact that the competitors can't even provide more than 16 GB memory at this time further cements the iPad mini as the king of the hill for the time being.
