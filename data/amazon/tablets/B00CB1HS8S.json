All were about 85% charged.  Each Zeepad connected to my wi-fi home network in a matter of seconds.  Touch screen was responsive and a breeze to navigate.  I am pleasantly surprised with the overall build quality and remarkable functionality of the Zeepad.While not as fast as the Google Nexus 7, which has a hotter Arm Holdings designed processor, the Zeepad's speed is quite adequate.  I was drawn to the Zeepad since its processor is also an Arm design and the Android operating system is tough to beat.  Image or screen quality is inferior to the Nexus but decent.  The difference can be noticed when viewing the screen from an angle, but as long as the view of the Zeepad is straight on, the quality is good, not great.  To put the review in perspective, remember the Zeepad is well below $100 and, at this price point, I think this product is a real value.  Actually, it is a remarkable surprise.  My grandkids opened these on Xmas Eve and within seconds were connected to the net and gazing at more apps (mostly free games) on GooglePlay, where android apps are offered in abundance.  Did not experience any slowness as mentioned in some reviews.  Perhaps the network? Durability is an unknown since we have had the Zeepads for just few days so I'll follow up in a month or so.

The first one worked for over a year which I consider a fair return on what we paid for it. Since that tablet is no longer on the market, we purchased another \"no-name\" device, figuring it'll all be the same. Boy, we were so wrong.To start with some positives, this tablet looks cool. It is small and lightweight, and it connected to our wifi fast. Now I will elaborate on why I gave it one star. We don't expect much of those cheap tablets, we only want it to load and play the internet videos and display pictures. That is what our daughter uses it for. However, this tablet would not load the videos. Youtube website will load, but the video will be loading and loading forever. It might have loaded eventually, but I never waited for longer than 5 minutes. I figured, it it takes 5+ minuted for a simple few minutes video to load, my daughter will have a problem with it. I was very disappointed, I so wanted to keep this little tablet.Another thing we noticed, is that the tablet would shut down periodically on its own. What the heck is that, so annoying. Plus the battery life is measle, it lost 50% of its charge in about 30mins being turned on and connected to wifi. And finally, I made sure I ordered a black device. However, the one delivered to us was red. The stylus was not included either, although advertised.All in all, this parody of a tablet went back the very next day. Amazon was great, made the return easy, fast and simple. Needless to say, I would strongly advise to stay away from this product.

The manual that comes is very very tiny and also in broken English, probably used a translating program so you tend to scratch your head a bit.. that is IF you can read it, the print is so small I had to get a magnifier to read it and then discovered it was of almost no use at all.  So without any instructions it was/is hard to sort of figure out how it works.  It took me a considerable amount of time just to figure out how to set up the internet WiFi.... but once I figured out the simplicity of it.. it was set up in seconds .  The downside is that sometimes the device just does not want to let you get onto the internet even when the signal is strong.. unsure what is causing that issue... but you can come back later and try it and it might go onto the internet easily.. so don't know what is hanging it up.The device itself feels a bit flimsy but is also very light weight. The screen colors are fine and the sound is \"just ok\" .  I haven't tried Netflix yet but if there are issues I will edit this review.The battery is not very good, and I am not wild about the charger that came with it, however you can use it and play games on it while it is plugged in and being charged.  The type of battery that is in it.. the instructions say it is better to let it run out completely before you recharge it.. and if you have issues because you have charged it to soon.. to let the battery run out completely then recharge it.On the Positive side... For the price ($77.00) it is a pretty decent little handheld.  It accesses tons of games, almost all of the  same games I have on my Kindle Fire.. many many free ones and most games are between 99 cents to 2.99. The game downloads go easy and the game play is fine. The touch screen is very responsive and it takes only a gentle touch to play the games or select items.  I do plan to expand the memory with a micro sd card but may find that I don't need to.  I have half a dozen games on it right now and in less than 24 hours I am getting to understand the device. It is not a Kindle or a Ipad.. it is what it is.. which is a ok value for what you pay for it.  I dont mind the quirks with the internet for I think I will be able to figure that out as time goes by.  I originally bought it for my husband to be able to look thinks up on the internet but think I will probably just load games on it and let it go at that.. my husband will use it a bit or the grand kids will surely play the games so it was worth the price just to have a small handheld game player around for them to play.Would I buy it again? probably  Would I give it as a gift?  probably  of course this opinion is based on only having the device up and running for 24 hours  and hard to predict if it will hold up.", "Title": "Zeepad is ok for the price", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Author": "Mrs. Kia", "ReviewID": "R1TCM0WSC220PQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only problem is that I have yet o find out no to put on the parental control.

I am sending it back for a refund.  Very disappointed!-----------------Previous reviewSo I just received my Zeepad last night.  First impression out of the box, it is better than I expected.  I ordered it thinking how good could a $70 dollar tablet be. and how much can it really do compared to the more expensive brands and models?  Well I was surprised.  It is a bit heavier than I expected, but that just gives it a more substantial feel.I have a 'better' tablet already.  I have the ASUS Eee Pad TF101 32Gb and love it.  But I was wanting something a bit smaller that wouldn't break the bank.  I read alot on my tablet so it goes almost everywhere with me, but the ASUS can be a little big for the handbag:)  I wanted something that would fit better in my purse for on-the-go reading, but I also wanted a bit more then just an ereader in case I wanted to look something up on the internet or play a game to pass time somewhere.  Yes I could have gone with the KindleFire or Nook Tablet but they are still well over $100+.  I also like having access to the wide variety of Apps that are available with Android.  I'm not totally sure what all is available with Kindle and Nook.I saw this and several people who purchased had said they were pleased so I decided to give it a try.It connected to my home wireless easily.  The touch screen is responsive, much better than I expected. I immediatly went to Google Play and began downloading and installing Apps I wanted.  No problems there.  I went to the browser and everything was working OK except for one of my favorite web pages.  When it loaded all I got was a blank screen.  Reloading didn't help.  I went back to the Apps store and downloaded Firefox and Opera web browsers to see if they would display the page.  Finally after paying with settings I got my page to come up in Opera.  I'm really not sure why this web page was having such a problem on this tablet but i got it to work so I'm happy:)With the display only being 800x480 everything is not as crisp as my ASUS but by increasing the font size on my ebooks they read OK.  I haven't tried any videos or the camera on it yet so can't address those at this time, but then that wasn't the primary reason I wanted it.  Also haven't tried to connect it to my laptop to see how syncing and transfering files over to it works.  The web browsering and reading capabilities, in a more portable size, was what I wanted and for those pursposes I am happy with it.We'll see how it goes after a few weeks with it:)", "Title": "UnPleasantly surprised!", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Author": "Tarche", "ReviewID": "R28MQG0WB9JW7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this from a company called Goodios and it came with a pen and car charger and this company was very accurate whenever i would email them..

The hyped 3 hour run time (which isn't all that great to begin with) is in reality more like 20 minutes or less.  Charging takes awhile and the charging power supply gets warm so it seems to be working, but the battery is weak.  (wifi on notifications off, screen brightness set to ~80 percent)The screen resolution looked pretty good until I loaded some pictures and test patterns into my Ainol Elf 2 (another bargain priced brand X tablet) and compared them side by side, the Elf wins hands down.  The Zeepad does have a somewhat better viewing angle, but the display looks \"flat\" compared to the Elf.I never could get Netflix to work.  (and hadn't gotten it working on the Elf either until just recently)  Unfortunately my wife has the Zeepad now so I can't try messing with Netflix, but I suspect the newest Netflix app will work on it.If you have problems with Netflix Google for \"com.netflix.mediaclient_3.0.0 build 1010.apk\" That is the latest Netflix app and seems to be working.  No need to register with an app store and it can be found on the net for free.I  haven't decided what to do about the battery problem.  I can replace it for $10-15 but that option isn't going to be open to most of the people that buy these things.12/6  My wife has had it all the time so I don't really get a chance to play with it.  (I got it as a test bed for learning how to update android, etc.)  I'm getting her a Lenovo tablet for Christmas...  Anyhow I'm noticing the screen on hers is scratched pretty badly, my Ainol, in comparison, still looks pristine (and I'm not gentle with it).  I think we are seeing the difference between acrylic and polycarbonate judging by the scratches.Battery life is still bad, but she can get ~1 hour if she turns off the wifi, and app updater (which needs wifi to work). I also got her a new charger and that has been working faster than the one supplied.  She still runs the display at 100% brightness which eats some run time, compared to the 80% I was using.Netflix is working like a champ now.  Ap update worked wonders.

Response time is ridiculously slow.  You hit \"Install\" and it MIGHT flip screens 30 seconds later.  If it doesn't it will \"time out\" ... Timing out happens consistently.  I don't know how the games are with response time, I haven't had the patience to even try.  The kids haven't complained, but they are just happy they have a tablet.2.) The screens aren't very sensitive.  I realize that screens can be too sensitive but I shouldn't have to jam my finger on the screen to get it to respond.  Very annoying.3.) Low quality graphics -- honestly, I didn't expect much from a $70 tablet, but just thought I would let you know. It's no ipad or Kindle with the graphic quality.4.) Battery life. .... It. Dies. FAST.  I was just TRYING to download a game on one, it gave me the \"You're at 14% notification\" and literally less than 5 minutes later when I went to plug it in, it was already down to 9%. This is supposedly a brand new tablet.  We literally got it in the mail yesterday. (Please note that we've had the other one for several weeks, so I'm not writing this review without having used this.)5.) Very cheaply made.  The Power Off button feels like it's going to fall off it's so loose. The camera is crooked and my daughters pad is coming apart in the middle. When I say \"very,\" I do mean VERY cheaply made.6.)  The \"User Manual\" is supposedly written in \"English\" however, it doesn't even make sense.  Here is a sentence from the \"User Manual\"  \"#3 Check the music file wherther damaged. Try playing other music, if the file have damaged may lead to serious noise or hop sounds.\"  ---that is letter-for-letter.  Huh?If you're wanting a serious tablet.  Avoid this one.

When it arrived I rushed to get it set up and download a ton of apps so my son could play with it as soon as he opened it. It was very easy to use although the downloading did take a while. Took approximately 10-15 mins to down load each app and I had purchased about 60 apps (along with some children's kindle books). This was fine since the tablet is priced under $100 (what did I expect, really).My sole issue with this tablet is with the charger. It does not charge well or quickly with the USB cord and the wall charger is difficult to work with. The charger plug does not fit completely into the port so I'm constantly trying to stop myself from shoving it in further. Also, if the plug is not positioned in the port exactly right the unit will not charge. I end up twisting and turning, and wiggling the plug around while constantly checking to see if the tablet is indeed charging. It's a little annoying. If it at least had an LED light that would blink or light up when the unit was charging, I would like it a lot better.Overall, it is a nice tablet especially considering the price. If I could do it over, I would probably purchase the same one again. I may look into purchasing a different charger that might fit the unit better. I did have to purchase a separate MicroSD card since only 40 of the 60 apps I purchased fit onto the tablet. But that was only an extra $20 or so.

They like the Android system ease of use.One thing to be warned of however. The power button cannot be pressed too hard or it will break away from the motherboard easily. I had it for 3 days before I sent it to my grandparents and ended up being unable to use the device because the screen wouldn't turn on or off. The button seemed really loose. So, I pulled it apart and needed to adjust the button mechanism on the motherboard. Then I managed to wedge some paper in between it to keep it positioned correctly when I put it back together (if you have this problem, you will see exactly what I mean and possibly how to do it).

The manual was written with english words but the grammatical errors, spelling errors and everything else about it was so poor that I couldn't make sense of it. It was like reading a different language with english words. Once I let it charge for the day I gave it a try, only to be completely disappointed! I realize I didn't purchase an iPad so I was willing to give it a chance. I tried to play a netflix from it only to find that I could hardly make out the image on the  screen. I also had to hold the tablet at one exact angle in order to even see anything. The sound was so poor I couldn't tell anything was even coming out of the speaker until I turned it over and held it right up to my ear. (That was after I had turned up all of the sound). The final complaint and what lead me to my decision to return it, (as if the above is not enough) is that there is such a delay when pressing an icon that I felt like I had to keep pushing it to make sure it was recognizing my touch. Actually, I can't say there is anything good about this tablet. Buyer beware, Do NOT but this! I don't even want to give it one star. It doesn't deserve it!This is by far the worst item I have ever purchased off the internet.", "Title": "Buyer BEWARE!

I didn't want to spend a lot of money in case she broke it or didn't take care of it, so after looking on here and reading all the reviews I bought her this one. I gotta say I was really surprised with this because I was expecting it to be on the lower quality side because of the price. But it's actually really nice. Have a lot of pros and some cons for this tablet:Pros:-Very heavy duty but still light weight which I like. Seems like it'll last longer and it doesn't seem like it'll break easy if dropped.-Came with a bunch of stuff including charger, stylus, headphones and 2 USB chords-Very easy to set up WiFi and all the time/location settings.-Going between screens, closing out programs and personalizing tablet is super easy to do.-WiFi connectivity is great and have had no problems connecting to the house router and actually picked up a ton of other routers in the area too when it was searching for connections.-Touch screen works great. Using the stylus works even better.-All apps seem to work well - liked how there were a lot already installed like YouTube and Angry Birds.-Big pro for me was that you can turn this tablet off and on to save battery life. And it doesn't just go into \"sleep mode\" like the ipad, it actually turns off which is very nice.-Like how there's a slot for the SD card to add more storage to device.-Camera seems to work great. Can take pictures or record video and switch between the dual cameras. (Resolution is meh though - see below in 'Cons')-Charging is actually really quick. Takes maybe an hour or so to get the battery up to 100% once it's down to nothing.-Gets all the same apps as the iPad using the Google Play store (pretty much it's just like an Android phone but bigger and you can't make phone calls)Cons:-Will lag if you have too many programs open at the same time (which makes sense as the memory isn't that high).-Speakers aren't all that great. I think that's why they included the headphones because the highest volume is still kind of hard to hear sometimes depending on what you're listening too.-Resolution is alright. Not as good as the ipad or Windows tablet though. But it's not horrible, just not HD or anything.I'd definitely recommend this for a kid that wants a tablet.

Miles-monaghan", "ReviewID": "R1EGB80WLJ2W6N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this tablet for my wife to play casual games on.  For that purpose, and considering the low price, it works great.  Mine came with Jelly Bean pre-installed.  The box even says \"Jelly Bean\" on it.  The About screen in the OS confirms this as well.  Unlike other ZeePads with Android ICS, this updated model was NOT rooted out of the box.The first thing I did to prep this for her was to root it using \"Root with Restore by Bin4ry\", from the XDA forums, and then installed Ad-Away and Root Cleaner.  I also uninstalled the apps and games she doesn't use to free up some memory - root not required.Battery life is so-so.  A couple hours of gaming will kill it, but it lasts a decent amount of time for other tasks.  The back of the tablet does get quite warm while gaming.  Performance is decent, however a task killing app is useful for freeing up some memory.  The screen is OK as well and responds to touch accurately.  The viewing angle is quite limited compared to a high end IPS display, though the update speed is plenty fast for her games and doesn't exhibit motion blur.I didn't find any Chinese spamware on this tablet as I did on the Star N9500 phone that I purchased and reviewed here on Amazon.UPDATE 02-20-2014: The tablet has degraded substantially with light use.

So, giving it 3 stars as a \"belated thumbs up\".THE PRODUCT.  The Zeepad itself is fairly awesome.  It's decently fast.  Decently responsive.  I like the way Android is set up on it-- not a bunch of extra brand-specific garbage.  Easy to use.  Speaker is acceptably loud.  No bluetooth but that's as advertised.  Love the multi-function USB port.  Love that it charges either from the charger port or USB.  For the price, this is an impressive little tablet.  Didn't like the 800x400 screen pixels... too few really.  But it works and aside from typical \"short freeze\" lag factors common in Android devices, this is a great little system at $70.  The device itself I give a solid 4+ stars.THE SHIPPING and ADVERTISING.  Not so spiffy.  The ad seems to change from time to time and what was originally listed as \"up to 1200 x 600 graphics resolution\" turned out to be significantly less.  In truth, 800x400 just doesn't quite cut it.  It limits the number of icons one can have on one screen.  Now if that had been advertised would be fine.  Noticed at times the screen says just that.  But at other times it advertises the 1200 x 600 and (while I don't know why), that's going to cause problem expectations.But the real problem I had (and what knocked this down to 3 stars), when purchased from \"WorryFree Gadgets\"... it came shipped in its own box loose-packed inside an Amazon box-- no padding to keep it from bumping around.  Meh, these packages take quite a bit of bumping anyway, so not too worried.  But... Amazon box was in fine shape while the Zeepad box was significantly crushed.  Since the outer box was fine, that means it was PACKED in that condition.  As a result while the Zeepad itself seemed okay, the screen protector packed as a \"bonus item\" in the top of the box was also crushed.  Not happy with that.The bonuses were nice.  The Zeepad stylus, the screen protector (if it hadn't been damaged *at the time of shipping*), the mini-usb adapter, everything was fine.  But I don't have much tolerance for a merchant taking a visibly and significantly damaged box and going ahead and shipping it without even inspecting the contents.  That's lazy and it's just not right.So... three stars.  Like other users I give the Zeepad itself a thumbs-up value-for-the-buck rating.  For the shipping and merchant care, not so much.  The question I have:  was it shipped directly from the merchant or from Amazon itself?  The screen said \"Sold by Goodios and Fulfilled by Amazon.\"  So which is it... Worry-Free Gadgets, Goodios or Amazon to blame for shoddy packing?  Who crushed the inner box and who sent it out in that condition?  Dunno.  It got it returned though, and Amazon was great about that as always... with a refund to my account in less than 24 hours and free UPS pickup (just cannot beat Amazon on customer service).This is a product that cannot be exchanged, only returned.  That's fine because in truth, I want a bit better resolution screen if available-- and the new Zeepads are just now hitting the market with DOUBLE THE MEMORY for about $10 more (nice coincidence there).Despite the problems I still <3 Amazon, and the Zeepad is everything everyone raves about.

I bought this for my 9 yr old nephew knowing full well it was not going to be a top of the line tablet . It accesses the internet on WiFi only no Ethernet port that i observed . It is relatively fast but again we only talking 512 mb ram so your not talking lightening fast . It has a decent camera with it and also a built in microphone , both as i have said are decent for what your paying . Its only really bad downfall is it's battery life . Even fully charged its battery might last you an hour depending on what your doing with it . It seems to use more power using the internet than the games. Possibly because of it being on wireless .i am assuming you will not be able to use this in a wireless hot spot because you do have to set it up to detect your wireless configurations on your device at home .

The plastic cover is quite solid but the edges do scuff up pretty quick. The battery lasts about 2 hours and that is acceptable for the price. If you are thinking about using this as a PC substitute please keep in mind that after the OS you only have about 1.9Gbs of space left; bought a 32Gb microsd from scandisk and the system recognized it right away; but only as a 29.8Gb device(might be file system configuration, but that's enough space for me. It comes with angry birds and fruit ninja installed and it was a great excuse to have some random children play with it and although they handled it as if it was made of solid titanium; it came out with minor scratches, but non on the screen because of the protector.The major down side for this device is the charger; as noted before it doesn't fit all the way and most of the time you have to \"giggle\" it around so that it will start charing; but the usb cable charges perfectly, just takes longer; I get a full charge from 2% to 100% in about 15 minutes on wall charger and about 23 on usb.I would have given it a 5, had it come with bluetooth or at least gps support.
