I though that it was going to be amazing, it came in a every nice package and there where no dents and it turned on easily. I used if for about 2 week and then one morning it wouldn't turn on, so i contacted the seller and they are going to give me a refund. This tablet has a plastic back that can pop on and off every easily, so when you drop it it opens. I wouldn't give this to anyone as a gift.", "Title": "Wasn't the best", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "ProductID": "B00AZZQHBG", "Features": "Operation System: Google Android 4.0.3 ICS\nCPU:  VIA8850 Cortex-A9 1.2GHz + Mali400 GPU, 2D/3D graphics processor (Open GL ES 2.0 2D and 3D Hardware Acceleration for gaming).\nRAM: DDR3 512M\nNand Flash: 4 GB.
