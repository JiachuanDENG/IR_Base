So as a techie, I tested this tablet out and below I will list what I have found to be the Pros and Cons of this tablet and have listed what I personally discovered. Then this will hopefully help you to decide if this is the right tablet for you or not...(By the way, to let you know,Something to consider: If you are looking for a COMPACT VERY PORTABLE and lightweight WiFi only tablet (and do not need the phone part), consider this tablet. (This is my favorite size because I can carry in my purse, tote, gym bag etc so easily! While it does not have every bell and whistle installed on it, it is a good choice for: Checking emails, Getting Online, Looking at Pictures, Watching Home Movies.Here are the Pros and the Cons below.PROS:1- WiFi connects easily and the signal is SUPERB in most places I tested. (Found the WiFi signal is VERY STRONG in my home and even in my backyard). This model has the strongest WiFi signal of any tablet or phone that I own! And it stays on the WiFi for long distances without dropping the signal EVER!2- The advantage of having a SD card slot that will hold up to 64GB.3- Small and lightweight. Comfortable to carry around and place in backpack or briefcase easily.4- Micro USB Port - This is common in most tablets these days, but the older Tab 2 line did not have micro port but the propriety wider port.5- Screen clarity - For me, I found this screen easy to read eBooks on and view internet pages.CONS:- 8GB internal storage - this it the advertized storage before Samsung added the OS, apps, Touch Wiz and because the OS takes up room, apps etc, take up room, the tablet just has about 4.7GB in the internal storage when you receive the tablet. No problem really I still have over 4 GB left on mine after all of my apps I added from Playstore.Bottom line and Summary:** Price and New to Tablet Person (or for a child/student) - For the low cost of about 160 (or less if used) dollars, this tablet will make a very nice FIRST TABLET or a TABLET FOR KIDS as it is a lower cost tablet that is easy to learn and has lots of features for the money. For just 160 dollars or so new, I find this a very good buy and this tablet may just be the one for you.** Experienced Tablet Person - If this is NOT your first tablet and you want a higher end tablet, and want to spend just a little bit more say about 90 more dollars, then you may want to consider the Tab 3 8.0 with 16GB of internal storage and larger screen etc. Also there are many very nice 7 inch tablets out there to choose from that have better specs and better screen resolution and better internal storage.If you are to have any questions about this tablet, you may ask me in the comment section and I will answer right away.", "Title": "This compact tablet is easy to carry around, easy to learn with nice features! Detailed Review", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R78ORS5ALXE5G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are too many tablets these days, right?! Samsung's third generation of Galaxy Tab series is highly anticipated and for this price point phenomenal. I have been using Galaxy Tab 2 and I will compare and contrast here. I played around with review units of all sizes and I have since returned them. My reviews are unbiased and neutral! First, if you have not had any tablets before, Get THIS! Yes, Get this 7\". It is ideal for plane trips, long journeys. I had used a 7\" Tablet on a long journey to listen to songs and read epub books (Aldiko) and it was a very pleasant experience. 7\" form factor is lightweight, compact and great. If you are a bit experienced and can afford it, I highly recommend the 8\". In my opinion 8\" is the maximum value for the money and features and hence I gave 8\" a 5 star. I gave 7\" a 4 star (but no means undermining it). I gave the 10\" also a 4 star because of some strange spec `limitations'.Samsung has introduced 7\", 8\" and 10.1\" of the Tab 3 series. They are entering all form factors. As I know they have something in 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10\" lines. Woo.. All of the 7, 8, 10\" Galaxy Tabs come in white and golden brown color. My preference is white color. Looks pretty!Let's start off with salient points of all of the Galaxy Tab 3 series. I will later compare with the previous Tab 2 model.7-inch tablet: 1024 x 600, Marvell dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 1GB RAM, 8GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD card slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 3MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 10.58 oz. (300 grams). Android 4.1.28-inch model: 1280 x 800, Exynos 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 1.5GB ram, 16GB of built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 5MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 10.9 oz. (309 grams) Android 4.210.1-inch model: 1280 x 800,  Intel Atom 1.6GHz Z2560 dual-core processor, 1GB RAM, a 16GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD slot (up to 64 GB), Camera: 3.2MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 17.99 oz. (510 grams). Android 4.2I am not going into other details like accelerometer etc. as they are all standard these days, Audio support - AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV; MP3/MP4/Music Tones; Music Player; Ringtones, Polyphonic. Video support: AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM; Video Player; Video Streaming. Software is current of release date, and it is expected could be upgraded as next version Android 5 Key Lime Pie. (Currently targeted for Oct 2013). Key Lime Pie's one of the main touting points is compatibility to avoid fragmentation, so I can foresee, all of these models being able to upgrade if Google keeps their promise.The 7\" has a physical home button so are others in the series.  Also has capacitive Back and Menu buttons. Camera is a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera for skype, and a 3-megapixel rear-facing camera. It is also equipped with an IR blaster so it will work as a universal remote on both your TV and cable box. Camera is only so and so, and I will not rely on it to produce outstanding photos. Weighs only 300 gm. 64 GB SD card is awesome! With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.Galaxy Tab 2 is 345 grams, so Tab 3 is lighter by 45 grams.  Processors are similar 1.2 GHz dual core in Tab 3 Vs 1 GHz dual core in Tab 2. Resolutions are same with Tab 2 1024 x 600 pixels (~170 ppi pixel density). Tab 3 supports up to 64 GB whereas Tab2 is 32 GB. Not a big deal unless you have tons of video/photo/ebooks/music you want to carry with you all the time. I use a mixture of on device storage + Google Music + box for my data needs.  Battery is also same between Tab 2 and Tab 3 7\" versions - Non-removable Li-Ion 4000 mAh battery.Both have Bluetooth 3.0.  I cannot confirm still if Tab 3 7\" supports OTG.  I know for sure Tab 3 8\" supports as I tested it.  USB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.  Another much ignored feature is the TV-out (via MHL A/V link). Unfortunately the 7\" does not support it whereas 8in and 10.1 in supports it. You can connect Galaxy devices to a TV to make it truly a fantastic computer if the device supports MHL. Throw in a Bluetooth keyboard and it is awesome. Leo Laporte's TwIT TV which is Internet based show has one full episode in Know How on covering this topic. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.Finally, believe me, don't get mired in the spec game. 7\" is equally capable as a 8in for `most' day to day apps. If you are reading books, browsing, listening to music, looking at photos 7\" is more than enough. Samsung is creating markets for all form factors and I would consider this as an exploratory stage. Just like Ford or Toyota has cars in different shapes, sizes and price range, so are the tablet vendors now. Remember the laptop wars, 10\", 12\" 13\", 15, 17 and even some 19\" if I remember right few years ago. We used to debate endlessly which laptop sizes are better, which has better speakers and so on. The time has come to fight it out for tablets!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background. Wolfram is a computational genius). Well worth the $3 price.Withings HealthMate. (another remarkable app great UI/UX). I am getting the Pulse device as soon as it hit stores.

I bought this product after a thorough research on all the contemporary products at this range.Samsung has done great with the package and look. I got mine in white and it looks great,easy to carry especially if you read when you travel . Good thing they added the home button which makes the navigation much simpler and faster. Memory is expandable upto 64 gb. Comes with an unique feature tv remote,it's pretty cool to be able o control ur smart tv without any additional hardware. It has a sensor which communicates perfect with various brands of tv. The difference of this remote from the other ones,is this does not require the tv to be on network. Samsung watch on is a great feature, I think this wasn't there in the earlier versions. Jelly bean processor,1.2 ghz dual core processor makes the navigation much smoother than galaxy tab 2. The price is a big plus for this one. Now comes the cons. The voice assist feature is very very slow and robotic compared to Siri. The wifi connectivity needs improvement. It's not that fast compared to apple( but you get what you pay for). One more negative point is the resolution , kindle fire hd and nexus has hd resolution for the same price when this product comes with hundred times lesser resolution of 1024*800. Don't know why samsung dint add hd which is very very common in the recent devices. Other than all this ,if you are looking a easy to carry,light,smart and stylish device with a great storage and most Importantly cheaper tab, then this is the one for you", "Title": "Excellent product and a great choice", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Author": "Nick Adegite", "ReviewID": "R3TPF6XMNHJDMU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Did some research as to high quality but low cost tablets and found three main competitors; Galaxy tab 3, Google nexus 7 and I-pad mini. Granted I-pad mini isn't that cheap but size wise in same bracket.I purchased the SG tab 3 because it was comparable price to nexus 7 but huge interest in expandable storage. Since I brought that up I'll address that now. Expandable storage was a great concept but wasted idea. In past android was able to move all apps to your SD card in order to improve your performance for your device.SD Card:Currently however, it appears everyone and there mother has moved away from that feature. Basically, songs and documents can be moved over to the SD card and the card itself is purely internal storage. Doesn\u2019t sound like a bad deal, well here\u2019s some insight. If you like apps like mostly everyone does, the more apps you have, the slower your tablet will operate. I found myself waiting more times than not for simple apps to load or simply swiping to the next screen. If you want a tablet for the sole purpose of looking at pictures and opening documents, you got a winner. If apps, gaming, and productivity are you\u2019re strong point, this tablet is not for you.Features:The next point of information, the SG tab 3 is the lowest grade tablet for the SG market. It does have a beautiful display and when the planets align a generally good overall experience but this usually only happens when you first load the tablet, remove any background tasks and operate only one app, like a new reader. Instructions on features for the tablet are none existent and if advertised features on the internet sparked you interest for this tablet, it\u2019s only for the SG tab3 8 inches. Not even the 10 inch has theses bells and whistles.The pull down menu is however amazing allowing you to control all features such as turning on and off options like Wi-Fi, airplane mode, battery saving without ever having to open the settings. Some features have like the auto dimmer for instance end up being more of a pain then a luxury constantly changing your screen brightness making it usually to dim.BatteryAs far as the battery life for the tablet\u2026.don\u2018t hold your breath. If max charge is achieved it is after several hours of charging. Once you\u2019ve waited 2.5 to 3 hours to enjoy your tablet, the power quickly drains away never really reaching that advertised 8 hour lifetime.This next point I have separated because it is VERY IMPORTANT\u2026UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU DEPLETE YOU\u2019RE BATTERY TO 0%.  A common grip on the internet is that tablets of all brands and style are not turning back on. Either China is pissed or android has got a major problem on their hands. Once the battery dies from use, unless you immediately charge it after dying, you\u2019re tablet will not turn back on. If you think I\u2019m joking go to this link [...]I understand they are saying it happens to the SG tab 2, but Tab 3 owners of the 7.0 inch beware\u2026it happens to you to. I received my tab on 9/6/2013 and it died 9/10/2013. RIP Tab 3, we never really got to know each other. That aside I have requested for another to replace my currently dead and defective SG tab 3 7 inch so we shall see how that pans out. If it doesn\u2019t work out, there\u2019s always I pad. I will admit, though my hate or apple is quite large, they know how to make a fully functional device.Overall:Screen has great display and movies look great as well as reading whether it be books or comic books. The Google Play store has a ton of apps making the tablet a good source of entertainment but don\u2019t get too many apps of you\u2019ll bog down your tablet. No matter how big your SD card is, it won\u2019t make you tablet faster. Features are basic and are comparable to that of a generic low budget tablet. The SG tab 3 operates fairly slowly no matter how much ram you free up. Battery life is abysmal and if you ever let the battery reach zero, you\u2019ll never turn it back on again unless you have your charger with you at all time. Hate to say it but if Android is lacking the tablet department and unless you want to spend high dollar for a tablet ($300+) you might be better off using your smart phone.Good luck and happy hunting,Android enthusiast.", "Title": "Raging Disappoinment", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Author": "Truthteller", "ReviewID": "R20V51I5TLSMHK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Samsung 3 7\" should probably not be considered in the same grouping as the other Tab 3 products (the 8\" and 10.1\"), because it is so much less that either of those.  The problem isn't that it is poorly made, just that it is missing some very important features found on the other models, and it is way overpriced for what it does have in today's market.Before going further, and not to insult any other reviewers, but I have read a lot of reviews on this product on many websites now, and the conclusion I have come to is that the people who rave about this product very often are 1) speaking from a very short experience with it or 2) this tablet is their first one and they have neither good comparisons, nor have they researched the market well enough to know where this tablet fits in the current market in terms of features and pricing. It is a nice \"looking\" tablet.  Mine is white and its \"handsome\".  It's size is comfortable, although it is slightly heavy for its size\".  It is thin and pretty sleek, but all of that is pretty superficial.  It is, however, at least \"last year's\" technology if not 18 month old, and so is the pricing.There are several reviews here which indicate people had the Tab 2 7\" and were pleased with it, and then \"upgraded\" to the Tab 3 7\" and were blindsided by the throwback in technology.  While I have not owned the Tab 2 7\", I have looked it over, and compared it to my Tab 3 7\" and I have to agree. The Tab 2 7\" has the same resolution screen as the Tab 3 7\" but the older one is brighter and has higher contrast, which can be important if you are in brighter lighting.  The Tab 2 7\" uses a 30 pint connector, which some don't like, but one very important aspect to that connector was that you could buy numerous inexpensive cables and accessories (for under $5) that allowed you to plug a card reader, thumb drive, hard drive, keyboard, mouse or game controller into it.  The Tab 3 7\" has a more standard micro USB port, but it is only useful for charging the tablet or to connect it to a USB cable to interface it with a computer.  It will not acknowledge any of the other devices mentioned, regardless of the cable you use because Samsung decided to remove the hosting ability of the USB port on this model.  The Tab 3 8\" for about $100 more or the 10.1\" both have hosting USB and work with a cheap OTG USB cable.  Not the Tab 3 7\".What this means is that your only choice for storage of images, documents, music or videos is to transfer them onto a micro SD card and use the micro SD reader in the tablet.  If you have stuff already stored on a full size SD card from your camera, or a thumb drive, you have to use a computer in between, or WiFi or Bluetooth if your other devices have that ability.  Most Android devices since about version 3.1 (the Tab 3 7\" uses 4.1.2) have a host USB port.  Google suggests they all SHOULD (their emphasis) have one.The screen itself is acceptable but not that sharp.  You can do much better with resolution, brightness and contrast in the same price range with other brands.  The colors are a bit muted on the Tab 3 7\".The WiFi and GPS are both weak.  Mine unit drops the connections quite often.As others have mentioned, although the Tab 3 7\" allows you to put up to a 64 GB micro SD card into the unit, it only can be used to store personal media (documents, music, movies, images, etc).  You can't access and run apps from it.  The 8 GB RAM within the unit is pretty limited, as the basic OS and out of package apps leave you with under 5 GB left to store apps.  Once again, currently the market in tablets supports units with 16 to 32 GB internal memory for about the same price as the Tab 3 7\". The unit has a dual core 1.2 GHz processor, but its pretty slow for those specs and gets bogged down easily.  Once again, in the same price range one can find tablets running faster processors of dual to quad core and 1.5 to 2 GHz.The provided factory apps are enough to start with, but basic.  Unfortunately, Samsung, like everyone else, wants to get you to their own app store for content (ebooks, movies, and other media) and so they have apps for these gateways.  I don't see any advantage over Google Play and other options, and those extra apps just take up precious RAM space.Like several others have mentioned, my unit has been a bit flaky so far. The auto screen brightness gets stuck in dim mode and won't come out of it unless I reset the brightness manually.  The screen occasionally jitters for no apparent reason.  The screen text size will suddenly decide to shrink while I am scrolling with one finger.  For a while, when I asked the weather report, it gave me Cambridge Mass, even though I am on the west coast of Canada.However, by far, the worst aspect of this tablet (besides the inflated price for its features) is Samsung's customer service.  Their people are very pleasant, will promise you the world, and will deliver on nothing they promise.  They do not advance your case even when they say they will, they do not email you back even when they promise, you can call them, email them, it makes no difference.  They basically give lip service. Their \"executive customer service\" supposedly a second tier, is a joke.  Do not expect any assistance from these people, you are on your own, whether it is a technical question or a warranty issue.If you do not believe how bad their support is, Google Samsung Customer Service Reviews, their are literally thousands of complaints you can read.If this tablet cost about half of its list price, I would probably give it 2-3 stars, but these days ratings are not just about what you get, but what you get for the price you pay, and how that compares to other products on the market, and so with that in mind, the one start seems appropriate.  Lastly, for those of you who are wondering why I ended up with this device when I know what else is out there, it was unfortunately a gift.  I just want to warn those of you who can select a tablet yourself, that you can do much better for the same money with other brands (and maybe even customer support that cares about you).", "Title": "Overpriced in todays market, Much better value out there", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Author": "Denise M.

I own three: the original NookColor, which is highly outdated and is now used by my grandchildren. A 8.9\" KindleFire wi-fi/4G which both my wife and I really like.  And this Galaxy Tab 3, 7\".Making comparisons is very subjective since what I like maybe isn't what you're looking for.I definately like the Tab 3.  It has good screen resolution for a 7\".  Decent sound from its tiny stereo speakers located on the bottom when its standing upright. It's easy to use and came with a lot of apps.  Any other apps are readily availabe.  I downloaded the Amazon app program and the Barnes and Noble book reader so I have access to everything I already paid for from those two sources.One thing I like about the Samsung that's not on the Kindle is I can view QuickTime videos taken with an I-phone.  The Samsung offers you the opportunity to convert Q-Time to a more usable non-Apple format.This is a very competetive market and tablets will undoubtedly offer more features for less money as time goes by.

I lead with that information in order to provide some context in describing the Tab 3 which is simply a wonderful device for the money and for the ease of operation in most anything you'd want a tablet for and to do.The display is far improved over the earlier tab.  It's like going for SD to HD in one fell swoop.  The setup and getting it synced with the home network wifi was far easier than I had thought it would be.  The same can be said for tying into the Google disciplines.  Once I set up my existing Google Gmail transfer, I was able to easily tap into my existing Amazon kindle account and start reading from my personal books library.  The Tab 3 is fast, looks great and is easy to operate.  Also, within the first 10 minutes of setup, I accessed my Netflix account and was viewing various movies which came in LOUD (good volume/speakers) and clear.Summing up, the Tab 3 is a significant upgrade over the first Samsung Tab and for the price of about $200, I don't see how you can beat the value with any other device out there.", "Title": "Under-promises & OVER performs=Excellent", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Author": "Emily", "ReviewID": "R33UK56ROZEWQ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this as my first tablet, and I must say I really like it a lot. The size is perfect to fit in one hand. The screen is nice, bright, and clear. It's perfect for what I wanted and needed it for. It took a while to figure out and get used to (and after having it about 3 weeks I'm still figuring out a few things).Youtube videos are good quality. The only issue with these is that sometimes your hand blocks the wifi signal so the video buffers until you move your hand, or in some cases I've had to hold the whole tablet away to get the signal back.Apps and games load quickly and are fast and clear.I use chrome as a browser and at times it is a bit slow loading pages, but usually closing active apps and clearing the ram helps the speed a bit. The ability to stretch the page to zoom in is useful for sites with very small fonts/images.It's very easy to customize your pages (once you figure out how) and personalize the tablet to your liking. I have played around with ipods and ipads and they have no customizing other than moving the app icons around, so using the android wins in this case. It's hard to find wallpapers that fit the screen properly, but since there are so many other ways to customize the tablet with widgets and such, it's not a big issue.The 8GB space (which is really only around 5GB when you get it) isn't very much but is fine for using a few apps and playing games. You have the option of adding an SD card, but since I don't plan on downloading movies or music I won't need it, since you can't put apps on the card anyway.The camera quality is pretty good, especially outdoors. Indoor photos aren't quite as good and are more grainy, but there are always apps that make photos more clear.If there was one thing I'd want to have on this tablet is better notifications. That's one of the only ways the ipod/ipad beats this with features. Often the tablet makes a sound when there is a notification but nothing comes up on the screen at the same time or even shows on the lock screen. If you want to see what the sound was for, you have to unlock the tablet, pull down the top bar and then see it. It's much more convenient to see a notification message pop up right on the screen.I've recommended this tablet to a few people already. Maybe in the future I'd even be willing to spend a bit more to get the 10-inch one (especially since I really want the split-screen feature).

Because of its anemic storage capacity (8gb, and half of it is used up by worthless shovelware which can't be uninstalled), users of this tablet will want to transfer apps to the sd card. Unfortunately, Samnsung's Galaxy Tab 3 will not support ANY App to SD applications.Say you download a movie from vudu. The Vudu app does not show up in \"my files\" and can't be moved, even with a \"workaround nor with \"rooting. \"  So even if you have a 64 gb sd card, your storage capacity is extremely limited.  Since all downloads go straight to your internal memory (NO SUPPORT IS OFFERED FOR YOU TO DOWNLOAD STRAIGHT TO EXTERNAL SD), for downloads you must remove the the sd card, download the item to your sd via pc, and then put it back in.For those of us who download large files (like movies and pdf files), this is an unacceptable oversight.  I chose this tablet over the nexus 7 specifically because of the sd slot.  Now it is too late to return this garbage tablet.  So don't be a fool like I was. Buy a tablet that will suit your needs.  I can guarantee, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it WON'T be this garbage tablet.Before any Android/Samsung fanboys get all defensive,  this is a well known manufacturer's  issue that vendors always fail to mention. Samsung has NOT offered any solutions to this serious problem. And trust me, with only 5 usable gbs of memory, it is a BIG problem.  Again, the usual workarounds do  NOT work with this tablet.Oh, and to those who say this is a Google issue, I disagree.  Many tablet manufacturers were aware of this and provide ROMS that allow App2SD to work.  Also, Android OS 4.2 will not have this problem.  I had read that the Tab 3 runs 4.2 but it does NOT, it runs 4.1.2.  According to Samsung, who I contacted directly, their 4.2 update will include App2SD support.  BUT, they have no idea when they plan to provide the update!Meanwhile, other tablets are already running 4.2 and allowing for App2SD to function properly.", "Title": "It's hard to believe Samsung can sell this garbage legally", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Author": "Signman Dave \"Signman Dave\"", "ReviewID": "RTHPFRAMOOVGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a contractor on the go the Tab 3 offers all the features I require to stay competitive.

For those considering buying one, here are my thoughts.Samsung makes great Android tablets (for the most part). I've owned a Galaxy Tab 2 and done some testing of other Samsung tablets as well.  They're responsive, offer a pretty straight-forward interface, full access to the Google Play Store (unlike Kindles), front and rear cameras, Bluetooth keyboard *and* Bluetooth mouse support and expandable storage via the microSD slot. This last bit is important if you want to keep local copies of music or movies (e.g., not rely on the Cloud) for mobile media entertainment.Also, the inclusion of an IR (InfraRed) port on the Galaxy Tab 3, and the remote app allows you to turn your tablet into a full-fledged touch screen home theater controller at no additional cost. For a gadget freak, this is pretty cool.  Overall, the fast processor, expandable storage, relatively low price, and wide selection of apps make the Tab 3 an excellent choice for a 7-inch tablet.But my experience with the Galaxy Tab 3 has been marred by a recurrent problem: sometimes the Tab 3 will become unresponsive: it won't charge, nothing lights up, and it won't turn on. This happened to the white Tab 3 I bought my daughter for Christmas after exactly one day of use. It happened again on the Tab 3 that Samsung sent as a replacement (the yellow kids' version) after about a week of use.  The first time, my daughter ran the tablet until the battery was exhausted and the unit shut itself down. After that, it never turned back on again despite multiple charging attempts from the factory charger plugged into the wall, or the factory USB/microUSB cable plugged into a computer.I looked online and found all kinds of suggested fixes: Hold the power button for 10 seconds, 30 seconds or 60 seconds (no joy).  Hold the power button and volume down button (again, nope). Hold the power button, home button and volume up button.  Still, NOPE! Try a trickle charge - plug the Tab 3 into a computer via the USB cable instead of the wall charger hoping that the lower amp charge from the computer would \"trickle charge\" the battery and fool it into charging. Again (at least for me) - FAIL!  But you are more than welcome to try these approaches as they are pretty simple and completely non-invasive.*HOW TO REALLY FIX THE POWER UP PROBLEM*What did work for me was to disconnect and reconnect the battery, then plug the unit back into its factory wall charger. After less than a minute, I saw the battery icon on the screen, and the unit began charging normally. Hooray! The only bad news about this is that it's not as simple as removing the back of a Galaxy phone. In fact, it's possible that attempting this will void your warranty, so proceed with caution!Getting the back off the Galaxy Tab 3 requires gently prying the edges away from the screen in the little crack between the screen and the case all around the perimeter of the screen. Doing this properly requires a thin plastic pry tool and some patience. I used a small jack knife, but would not recommend it due to the risk of scratches or even shorting out something inside the case. Once you've removed the back of the unit, gently lift the battery connector off its port by prying it toward you. Once it's disconnected, plug it back in by pushing it back down into place. Replace the cover by gently placing the tablet into its shell and pushing along the perimeter, snapping all the tabs back into place.There's an excellent video of this on YouTube by a user called, \"JerryRigEverything\" - search for \"Galaxy Tab 3 Battery Replacement\" and you should find it.  The only part you need to watch is the first one minute and 15 seconds to see how the cover comes off and how to separate the battery leads from the motherboard. You don't need to physically remove the battery or remove the screws that hold it in place to detach the battery leads from the motherboard. Once you've put it all back together, plug the tablet into the factory wall charger and USB cable. Within about a minute you should see the battery icon appear and normal charging should begin.Without this \"little\" issue, I'd rate the Galaxy Tab 3 as a 4-star or 5-star product. But with this major inconvenience, I have to downgrade it to 3 stars.  If it had only happened to one sample, I would have written it off, but seeing it happen to two different samples, and seeing how many other people are saying the exact same thing, I have to think it is endemic to all Tab 3s and it's only a matter of time before it happens to most owners. Let's hope Samsung figures out a software fix for this. Otherwise expect to see a bumper crop of factory-refurbished Tab 3s in the near future.If this helps you get your Tab 3 back up and running (or doesn't!), please let me know in the comments.By the way, in our case, the failures occurred when the app, \"Dragon City\" was running while the battery died. I know that can be a flaky app so am curious as to whether others who have this problem are also running that app.UPDATE: One more piece of flakiness on the Galaxy Tab 3. My daughter was unable to connect to the internet on her tablet the other day, even though it was successfully connected to WiFi and our router was fine. Upon investigation, we saw that the Tab 3 had reset its date to 1/1/2012. Once we went in and manually updated the date/time to the correct values, the tablet was able to connect to the internet again.

The 4G works well and is reasonably priced. I spent some time in the store looking at this tablet and others (Kindle Fire, IPad Mini, Nexus 7, Galaxy Tab 3 8.0, Nexus 10) in the store. I found this one to be the best size--anything bigger was too big to hold vertically, with the 8.0 inch tablets being particularly awkward. I find the typing input to be good vertically and OK horizontally on this tablet.Overall very happy with the tablet. It comes with Polaris Office software, which I find really useful.

It runs Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean, has a 1.2 GHz dual-core processor, with 8 GB of storage. This tablet is not the top of the line, fastest and best tablet on the market- it was designed to be a basic tablet and be affordable. For the price, you can't beat this tablet.The OS on this tablet is Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. The OS runs well on the system, and is able to handle multiple applications at the same time. The OS also includes the ability to force close apps and clear RAM.The Tab 3 is also well designed. It is encased in white plastic, with a metal strip around the outside. The power and volume buttons are on the sides, with touch sensitive \"Back\" and \"Menu\" buttons, and one physical \"Home\" button on the face of the tablet. The charger port and speakers are on the bottom of the tablet, and the headphone jack is on the top. There is also a compartment for a MicroSD card on the side of the tablet.The Tab 3 also includes a cool feature for controlling other devices- there is an IR port built in to the side. Software comes loaded on the tablet to set up with your TV, Blu Ray, cable box, etc. Plus if you subscribe to major cable companies, you can load their channel lineups and guides right on screen.There is one last feature worth noting about this tablet. Since it is a Samsung product, it comes enabled with Samsung All Share Play. This is a great feature that allows you to share Photos, Videos and Music between Samsung devices. It's easy to set up within the device's Settings, there is an option to \"search\" for other devices. In my case, I have mine paired with my Samsung UN46EH5300 TV (review for that coming soon!). So if I want to watch a video on my tablet right on my TV (currently stored on a 64 GB MicroSD card), I just have to turn my tablet on and it appears in my TV's input selection list! When the video starts playing the tablet becomes the remote, giving you options to play, pause, rewind, etc. This All Share Play also integrates with apps like YouTube. For example, if I am watching a YouTube video, I have the ability to \"send\" the video feed to the TV (as long as it is turned on).Overall- I would recommend this to anyone looking for a tablet for everyday use.

The stock memory of 8gb can be filled quick because some games can be 1gb in size. But the memory can be expanded easily and not for too much. Performance is good. I am still surprised by the graphics of some games. I just wish I could get or find a gimp or photoshop like app to do graphic designs on the go without having to root or basically hack the tablet. The wifi range is good if you are within your home or the same building as the router but it can get weak when  you are outside. I am looking for a way to boost its signal by maybe using an usb wifi adapter for rasberrry pi like boards and use a usb to micro usb adapter to connect it to the tablet. Should work since rasberry pi uses android and linux like this can but this tablet has to be hacked to root it so you can install linux while it comes with android out of box. I would recommend and buy this tablet again. Battery is about 12 hours with wifi off but with wifi on it can be drained in about 6 hours if you surf the net alot and can be drained even quicker if playing a game with 3d graphics while wifi is on.

Side by side with my kindle fire hd i can barely notice much difference. The tab is not extreme fast but it is not slow either, if you install  a task killer or ram manger , you can keep the ram clear and it will improve your browsing experience. People say it take 3 secs more to open apps, really 3 secs if you cant wait an extra 3 secs, its time to slow down your life.  I test the wifi and it works great the bars are not correct , when iam outside i get one bar but the tab work perfectly still loading pages and loading u-tube, test it yourself u will find even with 1 bar showing the connection is great.This is a perfect tab for movies and emails, the size is quite small and light fits almost perfectly in my pants pocket.  Since the price drop you can find these as low as 149.00 , which is a great price for the tab. The tv remote is great for using the tab to control tv.  Most people make fun or hate samsung touch wiz, but i love it , it has lots of useful features and mekes it easy to use the tablet, i have own the nexus 7 2013 and yes it is faster and smoother, but i like the samsung so much better, with the nexus you have to be very gental as it is very thin I was always afraid the screen would crack.  Like i said if you install a ram manager or task killer and keep the memory clear , you will find the tab work fine, as long as your not expecting it to be blazing fast....

Ginkel \"bilobaman\"", "ReviewID": "R9XZNHXHCB8DB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, this is a decent tab.  I like it for what I use it for.  Value wise, it is a 'great success.'  I use it as my car navigation/radio device.  First thing I did was root it (XDA developers is AWESOME).  I left the stock rom on there, but needed root access for the Tasker app to be able to do all the things I wanted it to do.  I use an Akron dash holder to keep it mounted in my car.  When I power on the car, it boots Pandora, Waze, and other apps I want open while driving.  This thing spends 98% of it's time on my dash.  It does all these tasks admirably.  I have no idea how well it will do in the Utah summer heat though.  This is the WiFi model, I use WiFi hotspot from my phone for data while driving.Pros:- Bright screen with decent resolution- Battery life is quite long (even though it is always plugged in while driving)- It's Android rooted, so you can do whatever you want if you know what you are doing- Audio is sufficiently loud (I normally have the headphones plugged in to my aux while driving but sound is good)Cons:- Doesn't do great in the cold, even though I can't expect that; if it's cold, prepare for cold warnings and no charging, sluggish LCD refresh.- Menu/Back buttons don't light up on this 7\" model, sucks when night driving while trying to use it- Camera might as well not even be there, it has terrible resolution and horrible color.  Don't plan on using it for any reason.Overall, for a dash rider, it rocks.  Using Waze, Torque app for car data, Pandora or whatever music app you like, and Tasker seals the whole deal.  This app has a medium learning curve, but once you master it, you can make you phone do just about whatever you can imagine automatically.  8/10 would buy again.  Good for kids too at home with the WiFi.  If it breaks, oh well.  Not $500 bucks down the drain like an Ipad if it gets broken.  This thing has 200% more VALUE dollar for dollar over the Ipad.", "Title": "Great beater tablet.

I know the phone is a higher end device in regards to resolution and raw power, but this tablet does everything I need it to, and much more. I like the build of galaxy devices, and this tablet is no exception. The screen is sharp and colors accurate. I noticed that the resolution is not on par with a lot of the new tablets, but the screen is still very clear and easy on the eyes. For the price, you really cant complain. Everything looks great on this tablet, and all the negative reviews you read are from really critical people. There is always something better out there in terms of specs, and you can drive yourself crazy comparing devices. Ibreally haveca hard time putting this tablet down, and I enjoy its performance. I use it primarily to web surf, shop onlinr, control my home theater, and basic tasks and it does them admirably,  with little lag. This is a great little tab, and am grateful to own it. Also, if you have a samsung smart tv...it integrates well with it. I consider myself a slight techie and this is a more than capable tablet except for maybe the most demanding games.

As for myself I read plenty negatives reviews on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 totally ignoring common issues other users had with the product only to purchase it and then discover I would have the same issues that others have expressed.My experience with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 did not fair well for many reasons. I decided to purchase the Galaxy Tab 3 after hearing good reviews from friends & family bout the Samsung S4 Smartphone.  First issue that I had with the Galaxy Tab 3 out the box is that it will only pick an extra strong WIFI singnal in the same room as my WIFI router. I just purchased the router in recent months and never had issue with WiFi signals with any of our other WiFi enabled products....Smartphones, Laptop computers, etc. Potential buyers can & should confirm this WiFi signal issue with the Galaxy Tab 3 through a Google search on the topic. The Galaxy Tab 3; as with most computers; does auto-updates on the pre-installed applications and also any apps that I install through the Samsung/Google \"Play Store\". My Galaxy Tab 3 was giving me constant error messages when it would attempt auto updates on the applications. Last count I had 26 error messages....when I would clear them out the errors would cycle again. I tried to do the research online though Samsung and Android help forums on this one issue to no avail though it seems to be a persistant problem for many users with application update error -110.  A big negative for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 is no ADOBE FLASH. This is a bad if like my family you have Amazon Prime as you cannot play movies from the website and there is no app for Amazon Prime movies. This is just a personal issue for me, but I had to create a username and password to use most of the applications pre-installed on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. This got extremely frustrating for me as I decided to forgo use of some apps because of this.  Also, when I was able to do a search through Yahoo search engine it was common to get a message alert message saying - \"Too many redirects from search engine\".  Needless to say, I will be returning my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.

I received this gift in April of 2013 and it no longer works at first they said that the plug or the charger had a short when I called Samsung directly.  I took it into Best Buy and went to the geek squad to find out that it was neither it is the actually tablet itself.  When I received the gift I immediately ordered a leather case for it and a screen protector.  Then they asked me at Samsung if I dropped it.  because they don't understand why the USB port would be damaged so in order to send it to them there is a $34.99 charge and if the USB port has to be replaced which I already told them it did there are additional charges not to mention I have to pay to ship it and for them to return it which will be billed on my credit card.  The warrantee literally expired 16 days after I reported that it would not turn on and to no avail would they honor taking a look at it.  Just like my handbags if you don\u2019t stand behind your product I won\u2019t purchase it I am 40 years old and take very good care of my things however technology is fickle and even though the warrantee expired two weeks before it broke this product should\u2019ve lasted much longer.

First as a replacement for my aging Kindle. I loved it, but it was on it's last leg. I wanted something I could easily tote around but could also do more than just read books on. Second, and more importantly, I'm in the IT field and wanted to get some experience with the Android platform. After 60 days of use, here's what I've come to learn about these devices.PROS:- Decent weight. The tablet plus the simple Belkin cover are about the same as a Kindle Fire; easy to hold and use as an e-reader.- Excellent design. The tablet overall has a good layout with buttons in the right place (versus in the way). It looks good and the components used seem to be of excellent quality. Although the casing is plastic, it's thick and doesn't flex.- Clear screen. Some reviews I saw marked this tablet down for having a screen resolution that was lower than competitors and not as sharp. Really, in comparison to other Android tablets I can't see a difference. Streaming movies look to be DVD quality with only slight blurring during action scenes. Colors are sharp. Print is easily legible.- Good performance. On occasion I get lags starting up an application or during use. But overall performance is responsive. I've only experienced a couple of application crashes.- Battery life.  Without the wifi on, the battery goes about a week.  With the wifi on, about two days.  Not stellar, but easy to live with.CONS:- NO ANDROID UPDATES. This is my number one gripe. The thing came with Android 4.1.2 while 4.4.2 was released nearly 5 months ago. I would expect slow or no updates from the bottom feeder tablets like Polaroids. But when you shell out $179 for a product from a company that's going toe-to-toe with king of the hill Apple, you expect a bit more in the way of updates.- Shiny screen. The screen is slick and super shiny. It shows finger prints really easy and is hard to clean. Glare can be an issue sometimes.- Screen responsiveness. The touch screen takes more pressure than it should requiring more of a stab than a tap.- Weak WiFi. The tablet can usually manage only about 3/4 signal strength unless I'm within 15 feet of my wifi router. Although I haven't found any dead spots in my 2-story house, the signal gets weak really fast as you move away from the router.- Camera. Although the rear camera is a decent 3MP, the front camera is pretty weak at 1.3MP.  Additionally, the cameras have no flash.- Crapware.  There's a ton of Samsung apps that I'll never use and no way to delete them (short of rooting it which most folks probably aren't going to do).In summary, this is a good tablet for everyday use and at a reasonable price.  It's met my original two goals of being a Kindle replacement and getting to learn Android. However, in comparison to my daughter's iPad Mini...well, there really isn't any comparison. The Apple (among other things) is more responsive, made of better materials, is regularly updated and has a better wifi range.  In the end, if you're on a budget, go with the Samsung.  If you're not, go with the Apple.", "Title": "Good Enough, But No iPad", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Author": "Cen", "ReviewID": "RSZD1K7R653U3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Having owned each generation of galaxy, this iteration is not up to par.
