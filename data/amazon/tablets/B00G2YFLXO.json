It's smaller (with the same screen size) and faster and can run multiple apps at the same time.The bummer for me is that ios7 feels like it is unfinished and that it wasn't sufficiently tested. First off, Safari crashes ALL THE TIME. I've only had one or two crashes on my old iPad so this took some getting used to. Secondly, there is the \"white screen of death\" where the iPad will just reboot itself for no apparent reason. Again, Apple products just don't behave this way so this was a huge disappointment. Finally, it is long past time that iOS add a real file system for saving files and sharing them between apps. Yes, the cloud works OK and Dropbox has become the de-facto standard for those who don't want to use Apple Cloud but come on, it's way past time for a file system.", "Title": "Apple is slipping in the software department", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Author": "Chari", "ReviewID": "RT1IGBIH3YBP3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received this item on time, boxed securely and works wonderful.

I use it for a small business and it has all the apps I need. I love the size of the device - large screen yet the tablet is nice and thin and light. The case that I got for it adds a very minor amount of bulk. As a new Apple user I was impressed by how easy the interface is to use.

If you have doubts shoot me a comment, I can help!Having used several tablets, I like the hardware weight and screen resolution of iPAD Air. It takes 3-4 years for a tablet maker to reach an acceptable level. All previous full size iPADs were heavy for me. I won't go into details of iOS7 itself. I am also disappointed Apple has GPS only on 4G models. The apps and security of iOS platform is generally good. What I don't like is the iTunes way of syncing up. Not a USB drap and drop. This is the primary reason for me giving a 4 stars. Android trumps in this regard.Overall being a geek, I like all makers. I don't bias and want Apple to succeed. Success of Apple will propel Google and other makers of tablets. My wishlist is to try a a Windows tablet once they get through a iteration cycle in late 2014.Overall iPAD is a delightful tablet as long as you accept its limitations.

Apple keeps getting so close, in some ways, yet so far away in others. Please let me explain.First, an iPad is overall a great piece of hardware. The iPad Air is lighter, thinner, and faster than all other tablet devices on the market. However, it does come with a few issues that leaves me hesitant to give more than a rating of 3 stars. Please let me explain.First off, Apple is notorious of fleecing every penny you have out of you. It isn't just the brand name or the product quality.For those that remember the days when buying a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES for short), what did you get in that box? You got the connector cable to the TV, you got not just one but two controllers, a light zapper gun (Duck Hunt anyone?), and up to three games that came included all in one box.What does Apple doe? Let's see. You have to buy a screen protector (separately) a protecting case (separately) connectors to a TV (separately) a stylus (separately), etc. etc. even if you get a good Black Friday deal somewhere, you can end up almost spending the same or more of a cost on a used car versus the cost of the iPad with all the extras you end up being required to buy on your own. You also get another additional $99.00 charge for a very limited (basically only a 1 time only use) AppleCare warranty plan.Also, there is the hardware. I know Apple is known to hold back a bit and choose stable hardware versus the latest greatest things out there. I get that. However, there are a number of areas Apple slacked on A LOT on the iPad Air.1. It still uses a USB 2.0 connection over a connection to your PC. Even if your PC has a USB 3.0 port, the iPad Air still only transfers data at USB 2.0 speed (a snail's pace by comparison).2. The battery in the iPad Air is actually half the size of the battery in the iPad 4. Despite claims of optimizations and so-on, Apple has still refused to spend some of the billions they earn each year on actual real research and development on a longer lasting battery with a much longer amount of juice. You shouldn't have to run to the nearest plug-in jack every few feet to recharge the thing. Likewise, am I the only one that realizes that solar charger calculators have existed since the 70's? If Apple would simply put a slightly larger sized battery inside the iPad, with a solar charger built into the case itself, no one would ever need to plug it in again to recharge it. As how very dated solar chargers are for small electronics, there is no excuse for not having it.3. The iPad was recently boosted in storage capacity from the former max 64GB to the current 128GB model. I do appreciate that. What I don't appreciate it just how many years the 64GB max storage model existed and how many years it took Apple to raise storage capacity. As fast as technology advances, we should have at least 512GB or even 1TB storage on an iPad. Consider that desktop PCs can have a 6 to 8 and soon to be 10TB storage capacity, a minor 512GB or 1 single TB of storage space should be no issue for Apple to provide, especially since Apple still offers no micro-SD slot for adding more storage capacity.Finally, I will say, I find it very inconsiderate, rude, and showing true colors on just how far Apple is in bed with Obama, the White House, the police state, and the National Security Agency (NSA). Just look up the Part 2 of Infect and Protect video by Jacob Appelbaum. About half-way through the video, he shows with official NSA slides that proves they have a 100% chance to be able to turn on any Apple device, i.e. iPad, IPhone, etc. They can turn on the microphone when you are not using it, they can also activate the camera to take photos of you, all with everyone around being left completely unaware. They have full access to your contact lists, including the complete addresses and phone numbers of all of your contacts, have access to all of your passwords, all of your email, all of your Google searches, and much more. Unfortunately, Apple decided to give in and join the PRISM program after Steve Jobs died. When that happened, any possible minor chance of any privacy, freedom, or liberty any owner of any Apple iDevice had, went right out the window. Could Apple have done their part to protect its customers? Yes, and very easily. The could have chosen to encrypt all user information and data stored at Apple and in the iCLoud. They could have been respectable and NOT give the FBI, CIA, NSA, or anyone else 100% universal backdoor access keys of their customer's devices. They could have added a completely free open-source plug-in offered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) called HTTPS-Everywhere into Safari on iDevices, preventing web traffic from being intercepted, by using a SSL connection everywhere, instead of use the very unsafe standard HTTP connection on the web. They could built into iOS a 2 form of authentication, instead of just a small 4 character password. They could have built access directly to the Tor network for full free anonymity. Apple did none of this, and it would have costed the very little in time and resources to implement. Until Apple grows up and starts fighting for the privacy, liberty, and freedom on their customers, I cannot in good faith suggest anyone buy an Apple Product again.", "Title": "I want to like it..but", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Author": "Mike60", "ReviewID": "R1QHQO5QBVHQFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "light and fast, easy too hold, screen is very nice.

No problems with my wife's iPad2.  I've tried several sounds to announce an email, and when I tried the duck quack I can never change it or shut is off. It's so annoying I quit watching Duck Dynasty! Also, when an email arrives you have to scroll to the most recent, it doesn't do it automatically. The worst problem was ignoring my touches, even though the icon would highlight, indicating it recognized my touch. However, when I did the software update a few days ago the touch problem went away and always recognizes my touch.The biggest issue is once you build your life around one of these monsters it has you for the rest of your life. You cannot live with out it. Carrying mine to a hardware dealer 55 miles away to use a coupon that wouldn't print out saved me $70, as it was still on the screen at the check stand. If left on all night in the sleep mode it only uses about 1% of the battery charge.A couple days ago  I stumbled into an iPad chat and some guru suggested doing a \"reset\" to cure the locked on duck quack, that did the trick. I also saw I wasn't alone with this problem.

This review is being written from the new iPad, and I am loving it.The biggest difference I have noticed is the weight. This thing is so much easier to hold with one hand and feels much more manageable as a reading tablet. The screen is much clearer thanks to the Retina display (same resolution as the 4th gen iPad). I cannot comment on a previous poster's comment that the screen is not as bright, but the display is plenty bright for me when I need it to be.Typing on the tablet does feel a little different than before, but I do not think it feels like it's going to break. I actually prefer typing on the new one. It is difficult to explain, but I suggest trying it out in store if you are seriously concerned about the feel.Overall, I would definitely recommend this tablet (especially if you are tied to the iOS ecosystem). There are other great tablets out there, but I cannot comment on them since I have never owned them.", "Title": "Solid upgrade from a 2nd gen iPad", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo":
