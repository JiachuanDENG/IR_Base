The product went completely dead, obtaining an RMA and shipping back the product which functionally was a piece of plastic with glass on the front was a long and time consuming process.  Received an RMA to return at my cost and 9 days later received a poorly packed Nexus 7 with a cracked screen.  After even more headache and time; as well as attempting to take clear photos of a cracked black reflective piece of glass I finally received an RMA number.  It took more than an hour on the phone before Asus decided they would consider replacing the defective unit that they sent back to me broken.  Back to Asus for the second time, my confidence in the product is falling and buyers remorse is sinking in.  They do send really sweet notes about how sorry they are for providing a non-functional product.  I prefer the clean Android operating system but at this point I would just like my money back or a certificate to the Apple store and we can just part ways.

I wanted to like the Android tablets, but they simply weren't a polished enough package.  The Nexus 7 changed my perceptions on the usability of an Android tablet, and they did so at a price well below the Ipad-Mini. What I wanted in a tablet was a robust platform to listen to audiobooks, read e-books in multiple formats, read through gmail, and use a few organizational applications. Could I do all of this on my Galaxy SIII? Absolutely, I would just run out of power half way through the day. The Nexus 7 is a great for these niche tasks, the screen can be easily read and the battery seems to last forever.  When you add to that the form factor - its so small I can tuck it in a large pocket and so light I can't tell its there - you have a winner in my book.  Did I mention the price? Buying the Nexus 7 was a no-brainer.", "Title": "Best In It's Class", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Author": "Emissary52", "ReviewID": "R28JNA1DR9D85S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I managed to snag the \"old\" Nexus 7 Wi-Fi 32GB model from Staples with a $30-off coupon last week, so the final price came out to $169 plus $11 and change for NC sales tax. I knew Google was coming out with the new, improved Nexus 7 and read about the upgrades that the new version would have. Since I'm not much of a gamer and already have the Kindle 8.9 32GB tablet, I figured that saving ~$100 over buying the new model suited me better. Plus Amazon is a super source for cases and screen protectors, which exist in quantity for the old Nexus as opposed to having to wait a few weeks for accessories to appear for the new version.As soon as I received the Nexus 7, I read online that Google had the Android Jellybean 4.3 for it on their developers' site ready to go. I downloaded it and found a program to install it, since I figured it would be a few weeks before Google rolled the update out over the air. My Nexus 7 came with Android 4.1.2 and when I went to upgrade it to 4.2.whatever, it said it was Up-To-Date. Yeah ...right! Well, I learned that upgrading most Android devices is a little more work than upgrading my original Kindle Fire, Kindle Touch and the Kindle 8.9 HD. Amazon has spoiled us Kindle people ...but I'm glad I learned the procedure to manually upgrade an Android device! That was a few intense hours well spent!I did manage to load a few apps on it - before I wiped it, when I did the upgrade, so I don't know how much better Jellybean 4.3 is, versus the older versions, but a few people have said it's made their old Nexus 7's a little perkier and the screen looks a bit more colorful. I also have a Lenovo A2107a 8GB and this Nexus 7 can run rings around it! It's like comparing a 10 year old Yugo to a new Corvette.My advice to potential Nexus 7 buyers - if you can get the old Nexus 7 32GB model for under $199 and you're not a gamer, but just need a general-purpose tablet ..then go for it! If you're a gamer, or just need to have \"the latest and the greatest\" get the 32GB new Nexus 7 and enjoy the 1080P screen and faster processor. All those people that bemoan both the new and old Nexus 7 not having an SD slot, just remember ...there isn't much other than music, photos and PDF's that you can put on it anyway! Most apps can't run correctly on those SD cards, which is why I always try to buy something with as much built-in memory as possible. To everyone who bought a Nexus 7, whether the old or new version ...enjoy your new toy!!!", "Title": "Bought The Old One on Sale!", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Author": "T", "ReviewID": "R2D3DCU0ZLO49E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned the Nexus 7 32GB + 3G model for over two months now, and I have to say I'm quite impressed.  For a tech geek with 20+ years of computing behind me, there's always something missing in a product, this one came pretty close.  The N7 is an excellent product, both in hardware and performance.  The 7 inch form factor has a solid grip and the tablet is light enough to be handled by one hand.  The tablet is well built and sports a powerful processor and good enough RAM to get you going.Whether you're in for work, entertainment or web browsing it's powerful enough to handle it all.  The screen is high resolution and very clear.  I purchased an OTG cable and you can stick a flash drive and extend your capacity with full control over folders.  You can attach work documents, copy / paste files with ease.  The battery is over 8 hrs so it's good for all day computing.  It fits easily in most pockets.PROS+ Fast performance+ Sharp screen resolution+ 32 GB storage is good enough + you can use a flash pen+ Running the latest Android Jelly Bean 4.2.1+ Great battery life+ Wifi + 3G both work well+ Light & pocketable+ Lots of free stuff on the Play StoreCONS- No 4G / LTE- No HDMI support (can't imagine why)- No microSD card slot (no problem, just stick a flash drive)- Flash is not supported on the latest software (available if you root)- Nothing else reallyI've owned the iPad 2 Wifi model and it's a great tablet, but the N7 is more versatile and handy, and comes at a good price.4.5 / 5 stars", "Title": "The Next-Gen Tablet", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Author": "Donald Carlin", "ReviewID": "RUBJ0QPMCN4D1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a decent 7 inch tablet, to replace my iPad2 which was kind of commandered by my stepdaughter for her school. I looked at the iPad Mini, but could not justify paying nearly the same amount for a much smaller tablet so I decided to look into Android tablets. I first considered the Kindle Fire HD, but it seemed to have a more closed ecosystem for an Android tablet. So I looked at the Samsung Tab 2, I really liked the features, but having 3G data was important to me, because I used my old tablet for both media consumption and communicating. I looked over \"no-name\" brands, which looked good on paper, but most of the companies I never heard of and sinking $200 to $300 into a product without knowing the company did not appeal to me. Then I heard about the Google Nexus 7 and checked them out. The specs looked good to me; the graphics, the processor, the most current Android version, and Google just released a new model with 3G wireless data. And being pure Android, it had the open ecosystem Android is known for, unlike iOS and to a lesser extent the Kindle. I also had good experience with other Asus products so I took the plunge. I've been very happy with it. My first forray into Android has been very positive. I was able to find all my Chinese apps I used on my iPad and still use on my iPhone, and installed them on my Nexus, they work fine, in spite the Google Play message telling me they are not compatible with the Nexus 7 device. I really liked that I could work around that restriction, which would be much harder to do on iOS. The 3G works as expected, so I can stay in touch anywhere (provide it has coverage) And the battery life is very good. Over all, I am happy I took the chance and gave an Android platform a shot (but I still also like my iOS devices haha).Some issues which might bother some people and even be a deal breaker. There's no front camera, not much an issue for me, but I know others will insist on having one. No mini-SD slot, and I would have liked to have one on the Nexus 7, but still, on balance, the lack of SD was out-weighed by the other features in the end. Cellular data is only 3G, and I realize some people will want full 4G if they go with a cellular-enabled tablet. To me, it's one of those things that would be nice, but not a deal breaker, as I don't plan on streaming media from cellular networks.", "Title": "Loving it!", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "Penny Gname", "ReviewID": "RCR3W0BHU8OH8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought mine in January directly from Google and it cost $299.I like it. I have been very resistant to getting into the mobile smartphone thing because I figured the small screen would just be frustrating, so when a fairly inexpensive tablet came along, I decided I'd give it a whirl. I can't compare it to an iPad because I've never owned one.It runs all the apps an Android phone will. There are quite a few articles and such with good recommendations for must-have apps. I was also interested in possibly using my tablet as a phone by using Voice over IP. Looks like that is possible. Using Google Voice and a couple of other apps.The one thing I didn't like was Google's customer support for this. They were just horrible, it was quite a nightmare.Oh yes, I also find the navigation/traffic isn't as good as what I have on my TomTom GPS. I thought I'd be replacing my TomTom with it, but I don't think I will.Pros:Price -- $299 from GoogleFunctionality -- Great!Voice recognition -- Works fairly well.Cons:Google customer support is horrid.On occasion it is a little laggy when responding to finger presses.I'm taking away one star for the terrible customer support service I received with an issue that should have been very easily resolved.", "Title": "Google Nexus 7 32GB HSPA+", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Author": "Robert York \"maintain_composure\"", "ReviewID": "RQ6TFXJDLIYZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A quick background: I own an iPad2, Blackberry Playbook, Surface RT, and Kindle Paperwhite. I bought the Nexus 7 32Gb with cellular 4G mainly because I own a Samsung Note 2 smartphone. The Nexus 7 was $299, without 4G it's $250.I am not going to compare it to any of the others except the iPad2 and iPad Mini. The Surface RT is not a valid comparison. The Surface RT is a productivity device with a full version of Office and a very cool keyboard/mouse combination. The keyboard snaps in and doubles as a cover. My daughter now uses it for school and loves it.If you own a regular size iPad, the Nexus 7 takes a few days to adjust to. The 7\" form factor at first feels small for a tablet. However, once you start using it you begin to appreciate its portability and fantastic screen resolution. Now for the comparison to the iPad Mini.Pro's:1. Android 4.2 OS. It is the crem-de-la-crem (IMHO). I like it better than iOS.2. Quad core processor. For comparison, the iPad Mini is only a dual core.3. Screen resolution. The Nexus 7 is HD, the Mini is not the Retina (HD) display found on the regular sized iPad.4. Apps. Very much in line with Apple. I like some of the Android apps over Apple. For example, the Kindle app on Android is far superior to Apple. Apple does not allow you to purchase publication from the Kindle app... inexcusable.5. Google play for videos and music. It work really well.6. 1GB DRAM. The Mini only offers 500Mb. The Nexus 7 is a little speed demon!7. Batter life. 10 hours. Nice.8. Standard micro USB charging port. The Mini uses Apples proprietary charging port.9. Price! The iPad Mini, with far inferior specs, is $200 more than the Nexus 7.  If you get 4G, the Mini is $250 more than then Nexus!  That is difficult to justify.Con's:1. No rear facing camera. I NEVER take pictures or videos with a tablet so this is a worthless feature to me.2. No memory expansion slot. 32Gb provides plenty of space but a built in microSD slot would be nice. The Mini does not offer one either.3. No HDMI port. You can buy an add-on to hook into a TV if this is important. The Mini also does not offer a built-in HDMI port.That's it for now.

Huynh", "ReviewID": "R13YZBKK9GSV08", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like to think of myself as a tech savvy individual but when my family and I got together to celebrate my dad's big b-day this past January, I soon realize, I wasn't so.  You see, my older brother and sister both own new iphones, my niece and nephew both have ipad minis. And as of January, my dad now has the newest ipad 4.  While in contrast, I'm still rocking a 2007 Motorola Razr as my latest tech device.  Don't laugh, please.  Well, that's technically not true, I did purchase a new laptop last year, but it's nothing I would consider carrying around or deem to be portable.Well, after playing around with the ipad minis and ipad 4 during the get together, I realize how much I have been missing out. As mentioned earlier, I have a new laptop that I purchased last year which I love, but with a tablet, consuming media and information is so much easier and fun.  Was a tablet a necessary item to have?  For me, no, but's a great way to kill time and a heck of a lot of fun and in many respects has made my life easier.Well, shortly after, I made it my mission to get a tablet for myself.  I knew what I wanted - something in the 7-8 inch form factor.  My budget was set for $300 which left my options for mostly android tablets.  Also, I wanted to purchase my tablet at a brick and mortar store so that I can return the device in the event I had any issues.After doing some research, I settled on the nexus 7.  I decided on getting a nexus 7 because it was a Google device which meant it would get the latest os updates first.  Also, the device is stock android which means it does not have any added skins or modified OS (operating system), ie, samsung tab & amazon kindle, I'm talking to you.Display - 7 inch IPS screen with a resolution of 1280x800 and a 216 ppi (pixels per inch).  For me, the resolution is quite good.  Could it be better? Sure, but on a screen of this size, I think it is just more than fine.  Nice wide 178 degree viewing angles.  It's great, especially, when you need to show something off to a few friends.  The device has 350 nits of brightness so if you plan on using this outdoors in bright sunlight, it will be a struggle.  Keep this in mind.Battery Life- 4325 mAH (Google claims up to 8 hours of active use)  In my test of mix use: video playback, gaming, web browsing, emailing and e-book reading, etc - I can get about 7-7.5 hours with wifi on.  I have my screen brightness set at half way, I also have a live wallpaper and gps and wifi on, but bluetooth is turned off.  Your usage will vary depending on settings, of course.Appearance - The tablet has an understated look which I think is quite sexy.  There are only two physical buttons on the entire device which are located on the upper right hand side on the back of the tablet.  The button closest to the top is the power/sleep/wake button and sitting below it is the volume rocker. Once the device is powered on, you have 3 touch buttons which sit on the bottom center of the screen.  From left to right the buttons are as follows - back, home button and recent apps button. And the back of the tablet is constructed of a perforated rubberized non-slip material.Form Factor - I think a tablet in the 7-8 inch size range is nice size for carrying around when you are on the go.  I tend to wear cargo shorts mainly and my tablet fits nicely in all my front side pockets.  I'm not going to lie and say doing some things on this tablet is all that wonderful compared to a full size laptop, ie, browsing the web, for example.  On a device of this size it take a little getting use to but is very do-able once you get use to it.Performance - This tablet is sporting a 1.2 ghz processor with a Nvidia Tegra 3 cpu which helps to keep everything flowing nicely.  In addition, the latest OS - Jellybean with its project butter makes everything run smooth and effortless whether it's switching between apps, running graphic intense games, browsing the web or whatever your heart desires.  This little tablet can handle it.  Every app that I was able to download from the Google Play store just works.In summation, I really love this device and do not regret getting it one bit.  Yes, it is with its faults - no micro sd card slot, rear facing camera and no micro hdmi out but I knew that coming into it and those factors really didn't concern me all that much.  I was more concern about buying a solid device with decent hardware that could last at least a couple of years without being obsolete and also be reliable.  And I found that in this device.  If you do plan on purchasing this device or any device for that matter, I would recommend also purchasing a screen protector and a case for protection.  Thanks for reading and if this was in any way helpful, please fee free to give it a thumbs up.", "Title": "Rock Solid Device That Just Works!", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Author": "Lectrichead", "ReviewID": "R2K3S1Q1JV8OWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So this year I decided to pick myself up an Android tablet at some point.  I needed to learn the `meats and potatoes' of Android, not just how to use it.  And I needed something hackable and customizable that I could both learn more about Android on as well as use in a practical manner.A Galaxy Tab was my first choice but the Nexus moved to the forefront after a bit.But it's only drawback was the lack of an SD slot. And I felt that this was a major drawback for sure.As these things goes, it happened that after the Nexus had been out for a while a simple dollar (or less) microUSB-to-USB (OTG) cable solved the lack of an SD slot problem.  With the Nexus Media Importer app, the cable, and whatever memory card reader or thumbdrive you want to plug into it - now it can have the ability to transfer data this way and overcome this limitation.This had been the thing holding me back from getting one, for the most part (as well as the money - I'm frugal), and while I had been prepared to buy a Nexus 7 after Xmas my wife beat me to it and picked up one for me, the 32GB one.So I have been using the Nexus for awhile while waiting for the cable to be shipped (which took taking quite some time as it's coming from China); well, I found that I really didn't miss it a bit.  With the various ways and apps for connecting to cloud storage, as well as using my own server, AND using the very excellent, very highly recommended (by me!) Airdroid app I don't miss not having an SD slot at all.Someday I know I'll really need to be able to transfer something via a thumbdrive or plug an SD reader into it - once I get the cable, but for now I don't miss it.  Likely two of the situations where I WILL need this kind of access might be while I am at a customer's and need to transfer something from a computer to the tablet (though I can do this with the Airdroid app anyway) or if I need to access some pictures off one of the sd cards from one of my cameras, like if I'm on vacation or something.I might even find myself taking a vacation or trip without my laptop.  <GASP>  (Sorry - I don't get this attitude of wanting to go technology-less on my vacation.  I'm not stressed out by technology, and I know when to turn it off, and I want to enjoy my vacation in every way possible.)It's possible now, as this Nexus comes close to many of the things I use my laptop for.  And as time goes on I find more useful and comparable apps that brings it closer to my laptop's abilities.  I think there's going to be a need for using my laptop sometimes, but I'm seeing less and less that I need the Vaio for the more I use this tablet.And as tablets become more powerful, and can access more devices (like keyboards and mice) the laptop will likely move more into the pervue of the desktop.  I see more and more people eschewing buying desktops and instead using laptops as their primary computer.A semi-side note here - the cable for plugging USB devices in came in the mail while I was in the process of writing this review.  Ecstatically I opened the package, plugged it in, and with the help of the USB app I was able to access thumbdrives, an SD reader, my Canon EOS Rebel and Canon A570 as well as my Canon digital camcorder directly with the Nexus.  No trouble, no fuss - no taking the memory cards out of the cameras, etc.  I also was able to plug a USB mouse into it and it works well.It's very easy to set up, and whether you like Google or not it's good to go through the process of setting up a Google account for syncing and backing up the tablet.As soon as you use it you can see right off the bat that the quad-core CPU and 12 core graphics chip pumps out a very smooth graphics experience, no matter what you are doing.  I will be able to show website demo's and photos and graphics to customers much easier than with my laptop.  Sure, smaller screen but easy to transfer stuff to their desktops for my serious perusal, with things like Airdroid.And it also has a \"stealth\" fifth core that takes over when there is less CPU demand and conserves power. I have noticed that if I'm just reading a book or doing something fairly passive with the WIFI and GPS turned off; it may show that I have two days worth of power.But it quickly drops when I do things like actively using the browser, typing with the keyboard, etc.  Still a pretty good battery life, not quite as great as the hype on the Google Nexus Page and I think it should be better.  Much better.  Or maybe it's just mine.  I have seen some suggestions that some are better at power conservation than others.I'd suggest it has a lot to do with what you have running.  It's so easy to allow EVERYTHING to give you notifications  but each of those things is checking the Wifi at intervals and using your power so considering turning notifications off on some stuff.  Usually you can just swipe the notification area down and touch the notification and access its options or menu to turn them off. The NFC allows you to \"bump' or at least hold the device very near another device with the ability to transfer data.  I haven't actually tried it, and mine is inside a (cheapo) flip over case folio-style so I likely won't be giving this a shot.  But cool from what I have heard.WiFi reception seems to be real good, I live in an old house with 21 inch thick stone walls in one section, and more modern stick-built walls in the rest.  It seems to penetrate the stone quite well, though understandably at a lower signal strength.  But my other routers takes up the slack and pumps me back up to a good signal.  The Nexus switches seamlessly between the routers quite nicely, despite a slightly non-standard overlap of the router.It's a little awkward taking pictures of anything but yourself but it can be done and the pics are fine at 1.2 MP.  It would have been nice to have a rearward-facing camera.Using the tablet is a pleasure - it's fast and smooth as an iPad/iPhone/iPod and everything seems to work well.  Graphics and the screen are crisp, super-clear and clean.  So nice.  I won't go into speeds and such as I have yet to do any hardcore gaming - not really something I'm much into.Though, of course, so many apps want to leave you notifications, which slows your tablet and eats your battery, and of course for those who are a bit paranoid there are privacy issues when EVERYTHING pretty much can access your private data and location, etc.But a quick click on these notifications by swiping down the notifications section (top-right) and tapping them usually gets you somewhere where you can access a setting to turn off notifications.  This is one thing I don't like about the Android OS - the notifications are very pushy (pardon the pun).  But this is the fault of programmers, not the Nexus.I also keep the GPS and Bluetooth turned off unless I need to turn them on.  Like for mapping programs it's nice to have the GPS fired up, of course!I do occasionally have a crash and a time out in Google Play, but this is likely no the fault of the tablet and has more to do with our Virgin Mobile MiFi crapping out often - the only Internet we can get here (outside of dial-up).The Nexus' casing itself has a nice feel to it, the plastic has almost a leather or porous feel to it and is nicely non-slick (despite looking like it is).I won't go through all the installed apps and the stuff you normally would download, except to say it all functions nicely, smoothly, and many times seamlessly together.  If you want to use another app for defaults for various uses it's easy to set up, same as on any Android device.Widgets are nice, but I find that I don't really use them - it's nice to be able to see the weather at a glance but I'm going to click it any way for more info.  So I've kind of turned off the widgets I had tried out originally.  I like the screen space.Also love Jelly Bean's ability to make nice little IOS-like folders.  Excellent, easy (just drag n' drop), quick.Jelly Bean has some nice improvements over previous Android versions, like the task list and the swiping away of programs you don't want to run any longer.  I find I like Android more and more, and being based on LINUX (there's even going to be a mobile version of LINUX coming out sometime, from Ubuntu - but you can also try different flavors of LINUX right now n your Nexus if you like).The voice commands for Google Now work incredibly well.  With our home Dolby Surround Sound cranked it couldn't quite pick up everything I said, but that's pretty extreme - under normal circumstances it's amazingly accurate.  Ask Google a question and you'll probably get the answer.They keyboard is pretty standard, with predictive typing.  And I'm just getting into using Gesture Typing - swipe your finger over the letters you are typing without lifting your finger.  It seems incredibly fast, though takes some getting used to.  Lots of potential there.The screen itself is Corning\u00ae Fit Glass - which is not quite the same as Gorrilla Glass unfortunately, but it is very scratch resistant.I installed Flash on the Nexus 7, and it works well for me.  At least in my testing but a friend has told me that games don't seem to run correctly on it.  Which is too bad.There's some great apps out there.  And I find the tablet is very much becoming a replacement my laptop in some situations.", "Title": "Excellent tablet - workhorse", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Author": "Random1040", "ReviewID": "R14CPUUYQDYCIE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the new 32GB version and started out with a mild case of buyer's remorse, but I'm warming up to it a bit more.[This was updated 11/24/2012. I'm adding a star to the review, after doing more research on other Android tablets, and updating a few other points, finding a few more uses, and reconsidering how the price fits.]First let me say that I looked at every option in existence [now a bunch more in person], and the Mrs. owns an iPad 3. We each also have laptops, and I own a ridiculously well-equipped desktop. At the end of the day, all of the current generation of tablets have shortcomings, and many have strong points. Of all of them, the Nexus 7 and regular iPad (3rd or 4th generation) are the best bets, though the Kindle Fire HD has a place. Let me just boil the review down easy here:The good:1) The N7 has a great build quality so far as I can tell. Everything from the shape to the textured rubber back makes sense. I don't hear any electronic noise listening to music with headphones.2) Jelly Bean [old and new version] run smoothly and are a clear improvement over past Android builds.3) The display looks really good. Not quite iPad3/ipad4/retina good, but close enough to not miss it during daily use.4) It's a great reader, and both Google's books and the Kindle app work like a charm. Google's app especially.5) Facebook, music, especially Google Play, also great. The stock email app, not so much.6) [NEW] As I student I use a flash card app which working nicely. Input info on a standard computer, and sign in on the N7. Any tablet can do this but extremely useful.7) The price is excellent, relative to what other tablet makers are offering. [Don't even bother with the iPad mini if it's on your possibilities list... if you're going to pay that you might as well just step up to the iPad 3 or 4 and enjoy the nice screen]The not terrible but could use work:1) Lack of apps. Don't underestimate this! I'd heard but didn't fully appreciate how bad it was. I had this dream of subscribing to my favorite magazines and newspapers and enjoying them in a nice format... not to be. The selection is pretty weak, though 3rd parties can aggregate them a bit even if they're a bit clunky. Another app I like on the iPad is Amplitube, which lets you simulate guitar pedals and amps as you plug your guitar into it (works well). No such animal on Android yet.2) Like most readers, it feels a little heavy. Or maybe not heavy, but a little awkward compared to a book. And my thumb always want to touch the spot that changes a page. Seasoned tablet people can probably ignore this, and in fairness the N7 is still better than most competing tablets I saw. Reading off a full size iPad3 is awkward as hell.3) A lot of missing features: no expandable storage, no HDMI are big ones. For the 32GB I wouldn't sweat storage unless you're a complete app pig and insist on keeping a huge media collection on the device (instead of one of the popular cloud services). HDMI I miss more, would be nice to be able to line out to a TV with some video content, but no dice.4) As with Apple, no Flash support. There are workarounds, but the two I tried didn't work out. I appreciate that Flash is dying (and it should), but there is still content out there that uses it.5) EDITED: Recharge not too bad. It was very slow using a different power adapter for whatever reason, the one it comes with does a decent job when run into the wall.6) Screen is a fingerprint magnet with a lot of glare. Plan on applying a film for that.7) The power & volume controls are a little too subdued the way they're placed. Minor point.All in all, it's a solid & well-built piece of work if you can use it. It's probably ideal for someone who uses public transportation and needs to pass the time with a device I'd call half reader, half toy. Provided you own a computer, TV and basic smartphone, this device will probably be redundant for you. If you're buying it to read bestsellers, read Tweets and fling some Angry Birds, [or study flash cards!] you'll be happy.Android' app ecosystem is the biggest concern here.

Think about it, you can download an app such as Google skymap, Skyeye etc. and hold the tablet up against the sky and it will show you what stars, planets, nebula's are behind it. Everyone into astronomy should know the basics but its nice to be able to quickly verify what you are looking at. These are a little harder to attach to a scope but if you are into astrophotography you likely want to keep your scope as light as possible unless you have a pier mounted Astrophysics mount or similar. But for a larger Dobsonian you might be able to attach it directly to the tube and use it as a crude spotter or for push-to guiding.I researched iPads at first since they seem to be the most common and reliable but was not happy with how quickly Apple obsoletes its older products. I used some astronomy software on an iTouch but Apple won't allow updates to download to it since it is an older version. A fellow astronomer on Astronomyforum.net suggested I try a Nexus tablet over a cheaper droid device. I'm really glad I listened as really feels nice in the hands, durable and quick as it needs to be. The 32GB is ample to load up several DVD quality movies and the Wifi moves these back and forth in minutes.Unfortunately instead of using this for AP I wound up getting distracted with the great variety of tasks it can accomplish. It is really nice being able to take this out for a quick visit to a news site, Panoramio, Foursquare, Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. Its like having a fully functional computer that you can jam into a fat pocket!My biggest use so far has been loading it up with movies or TV shows to watch since I have a long commute for work. The portability of the Nexus 7 beats any portable DVD or Blue-ray player and the battery lasts longer than that I have owned. Its also nice being able to load up several movies and not have to swap discs. The device is also fully capable of streaming Youtube, Hulu etc when in WiFi range. If the screen isnt big enough for you, you have the option to Chromecast these videos to any HDMI (Television) device on your connected network. Getting files onto the Nexus is very easy, you can either plug in a USB to micro USB (Wish they had used mini or full size USB as the connector seems flaky). Since Droid has such a wide variety of software available you can also download a file browser such as ES Explorer and copy these over your network (or the Internet) via FTP, or Samba etc.Google is able to offer these durable top notch tablets fairly cheap as they are trying to get their name out. In other words, it comes preloaded with Google apps, works great with Chromecast etc. Another nice thing about being a Google product is that it gets the firmware updates before other devices! These updates usually take 3-4 minutes to install compared to 3-4 hours for a similar firmware update on my Surface RT. Unlike the Surface and possibly the iPad is that Droids allow you to choose your internet browser, Mozilla firefox (can sync favorites and history with your desktop), Internet Explore or Google's own Chrome.The learning curve to using these (my first tablet) is pretty quick. These are not my first tablets ever as one vendor shipped me a Surface RT for $75 (instead of a scratch and dented 2012 16GB Nexus 7). I thought the Surface was a heck of a deal until I started using it. The new Metro interface and Windows 8.1RT has all he unfriendliness and bad aspects of the past versions of Windows including being a real resource hog. I do miss a regular keyboard but for light use, the screen keyboard is sufficient. In fact, my wife liked it so much I wound up buying her a Nexus 10 for the 2013 Christmas season.The biggest drawback with the Nexus 7 will likely be charging issue. If you Google this or look at some of the other reviews you will this not an uncommon problem. I believe the Nexus 7 has a small chip inline with the battery and for some reason it decides to charge at a really low rate. This seems to be exasperated when the battery is really low or dead and you plug in the charger. If you unplug the charger from the wall and plug it back in a few times during the charge cycle it usually seems to clear this up. If this is the case Google could easily just make a charger that cuts power briefly once an hour and this would allow the chip to work with some battery behind it and hopefully make the right decision about how much current to draw. Or better yet, why not have a charge light on the charger to let you know you its drawing 2a? This used to happen often for me even though I am a daily charger (my Treo 650 that I still use runs on two charges a  month) often to get annoying. The docking base they sell for it seems to have cut back on this and I have only had it not fully charge overnight once on me.", "Title": "Months later I am still amazed at this little device.

As it comes, the Nexus 7 is a bit too bright for reading at night but there is an app to custom dim the screen further to make it just right for your eyes.- replace a laptop computer. With a touch-screen, such simple matters as selecting text to cut copy or paste can be <<< utterly maddening.>>> However, these routine tasks become easy, even quite pleasant, with a decent external mouse and good external keyboard. Good peripherals take up very little briefcase space and really make the Nexus 7 an excellent road-warrior. An OTG cable and app change the charging micro-USB port into an external access port for reading and writing memory sticks and even powered hard disk drives. 16GB is plenty with such external storage. When not working, the Nexus 7 tablet is such a handy package you are most likely to have it, well, right at hand.- The screen is remarkable for watching movies and is very nice for video calls (Skype, Tango, etc.) I am pleased the screen is also very readable for texts, emails and browsing the Internet.

When I ordered this Nexus 7 I was already aware that an improved version would be coming soon. I bought this one anyway because the value-to-price ratio is so positive. I came to depend on my first Nexus 7 so much, that for the price I wanted a spare machine I could configure identically. (Two Nexus 7 cost me less than a laptop. Spend $200 for a spare tire, professionally speaking? Sure.) This time I sprang for the 32 GB model (my other Nexus 7 is fine with 16GB) because when travelling I can sometimes be uncluttered of peripherals to use the additional storage for movies, downloaded programs and music.Do get a good case for it.

Out of the three ASUS Nexus 7's and two ASUS TF300's I've tried the past month, these were the results: Nexus 7 number one exchanged due to severe screen flicker, Nexus 7 number two returned for refund due to failure to charge, TF300 number one was exchanged after developing two very noticeable mura spots (looked like two glowing white orbs), and TF300 number two was returned after developing dead pixels the second day.  It also had significant backlight bleeding that I was willing to overlook, but not the dead pixels as well.  Finally, Nexus 7 number three is perfect so far.  Not to toot Apple's horn but facts are facts.  I've purchased five iPads, at least one from every generation, since its initial release and not once have I had such problems with them.  If you can get a good one, the Nexus 7 is a great tablet.  ASUS, please get your Q&A; together.  There is a fine line between value and cheap.  If the quality is that shoddy, may as well buy one of those cheap knock-off tablets.--------------------I recently purchased a 32 GB Nexus 7 to compliment my standard iPad for those times when I don't feel like holding such a hefty device.  First, the form factor is perfect.  It fits perfectly in one hand and I love that there are only two buttons, power and volume. The rear has a bumpy matte plastic finish that makes it easier to hold without it sliding.  I figured with the specs and for $249, it was a steal.  Then I turned it on.  The first thing that disappointed me was how warm the screen color was.  If you have nothing to compare it to, it looks acceptable if not a tad washed out; however, when I placed it next to my wife's Galaxy Tab Plus, it was no contest.  Her tablet was much brighter, more vibrant and displayed much better looking pure whites.  By comparison, my whites looked dingy with a yellowish tint and colors were more washed-out.  Despite less than stellar colors, the 1280X800 display was more sharp and crisp than the Tab.  I noticed that the colors on the Nexus improved a bit after the screen had a little time to burn it, although they were still no match for the Tab, even with the tab's lower resolution.As far as performance, it was a mixed bag.  I have to say I honestly expected better.  For instance, Subway Surfers runs flawlessly on my iPad 3 but stutters at times on my Nexus. Now, I realize the iPad 3 has a better GPU, but the Nexus was only marginally better than the Tab as well.  The Nexus even rebooted spontaneously on me a couple times for no reason during tasks.  That leads me to my biggest problem with the device, too many quirks.  Other than the random reboot, the first Nexus I had was okay.  I was perfectly content to keep it until the screen started randomly flickering.  I first noticed it during gaming but noticed it in other areas as well.  I'd have flashing horizontal lines across the display.  I subsequently exchanged it for another Nexus 7.The second Nexus was much like the first but with noticeably less flicker.  I was actually enjoying it for nearly a week until the battery completely drained during use and I attempted to charge it.  I had previously charged the device once before but the battery wasn't completely drained during that initial charge.  It was down to roughly 2%.  I plugged it up and it charged fine.  This time however, I plugged it up and instead of the charging icon, the unit booted.  I figured it was normal because my iPad and iPhone also boot after charging a few minutes with a completely drained battery.  However, it booted to the main screen, the low battery alert sounded and the device shut down again.  I again mistakenly assumed this was normal and that it just went dark to charge.  However, it rebooted again, and again, and again....  Each time it rebooted, the main screen would display for a few seconds, the low battery alert sounded and it rebooted again.  It seemed like it was getting just enough juice to boot and then shut down, only to repeat the process.  I allowed it to do this for roughly 10 minutes, hoping it would eventually get enough juice to end the cycle and charge normally, but it didn't.  I then scoured the Internet for answers and was shocked by the number of users reporting screen flicker and charging issues.  The weird thing is, although I came across a few random bad reviews of the tablet from users during my research before purchase, I did not encounter the staggering number of reviews specifically related to my same issues until I typed the exact symptoms into the search engine.Needless to say, I followed the advice I found in an Android forum and booted into the boot loader and allowed it to charge a bit in there.  Once I rebooted, it charged normally.  I wanted to see if I could duplicate the issue, so I again allowed the battery to completely drain and attempted to charge.  So far, I am unable to duplicate the issue.  I honestly feel all these issues are tied into the latest Android version 4.2.1.  Many people are content to keep finding solutions as new random problems arise or they are sadly beyond their return period (I saw quite a few posts filled with buyer's remorse) but I don't have time for all that nonsense, so back it went.  Last year I was furious with Samsung for taking forever with their Ice Cream Sandwich updates and that's how my wife ultimately ended up with the Galaxy Tab Plus which was originally mine.  I now see that it's best to hold out until the developer is absolutely certain that the software is ready instead of releasing half-baked updates.  When you have pure Android, you get the most recent updates faster than anyone else but you also get all of the early adopter issues that go along with it.  In any event, I returned the second Nexus 7 and won't be trying a third.  I was tempted to exchange it for a Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 Plus, but I understand the Tab 3 is rumored to be just around the corner.  So I'm going to wait it out for now and stick to the big old iPad.  I'm honestly not interested in the Mini at the current price and prefer a small Android tablet.The Nexus 7 is a promising and very capable small tablet.  I personally know several people who own it and have experienced no problems.  Maybe I'm either unlucky or too picky but I don't want to keep rolling the dice and hoping to finally get a unit without issues.  Without the flakiness, I'd probably rate it four stars, with the one star being knocked off for the poorly calibrated display.  However, taking my issues with two separate tablets into account, I rated it as highly as I feel it deserves based on my personal experience.  Depending on the release date for the Nexus 7 second generation, maybe I'll see if I have better luck with that model. That is assuming I don't have a Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 by then.", "Title": "Great tablet with issues", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Author": "badger1", "ReviewID": "R2L9RAV0NBSL7G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After four months of use, battery life is abysmal.

And that it is jelly bean 4.1. I like Jelly Bean more than ice cream sandwich because the applications run a lot smoother.The things I don't like is the front camera, it is absolutley dreadful! Nexus should have not created the camera because it makes anything that looks good into super unattractive! I wish Nexus instead of putting the camera in, swap it out and put a micro sd card reader (You can buy an OTG cable to by pass that). The next thing is the speakers, don't listen to this tablet without headphones. When I cranked the volume up for music it either goes into static mode or just distorts. Plus it does not get very loud when I'm watching movies via Netflix. Those are my only gripes.In summary this tablet is wonderful, it was my first tablet ever and I'm glad that I choose this as my first. The speed is wonderful, the resolution is fantastic and it's Google's tablet so updates come frequently. It's not a perfect tablet, I experience extreme lag when I update just 5 apps, the screen takes a while to move side to side. I've had only a few crashes, nothing to severe.

(And that's a good thing, compared to some of the vender-customized versions.)  I bought it for some development work and for trying out different operating systems.  I think the future of such devices is to have a choice of OS's, just like you can have with a laptop; so the important thing is how hackable is this hardware?  The Nexus 7 happens to be popular for that sort of thing, so you can choose between various versions of Android and other Linux distributions such as Mer with KDE Plasma Active, Ubuntu with Unity, and Bodhi with Enlightenment.  I'm sure more are on the way.  I installed TWRP and the multirom hack to be able to choose the OS at startup (via the touchscreen even).I also like that it feels solid, and I like the rubbery feel of the back.  The display is really beautiful too, and high enough resolution.  Maybe it's not \"retina\" but it still looks better than last-generation tablets, and it doesn't tax the GPU the way a 2k resolution display would.  So considering the Nexus 10 is so hard to find right now, maybe it's OK to wait until the next generation of GPU before getting a retina Android tablet.  The microUSB port has host mode, so you can plug in such things as keyboards, USB sticks and so on via an adapter (not included but cheap to buy).The minor downsides I've found so far:- no microSD slot.  32GB is enough, but it would still be nice if it were expandable.- the desktop dock is hard to find and costs too much- there should be a keyboard which attaches to the tablet and uses the 4 gold-plated contacts rather than using bluetooth, and basically converts this tablet to a laptop.  But nobody has made it yet.  Instead you can buy a bluetooth keyboard which is the same size, props up the tablet when you are using it and and acts like a screen cover when you're not.- there could have been a Wacom tablet with a stylus like the Samsung Galaxy Note series has.  It's too bad only Samsung is doing that so far.  But then again this one costs half as much.  When the 8\" Note comes out, I suspect it will be quite competitive.- the accelerometer shows up under /sys/bus/iio but NOT under /dev/input.  It's still possible to work with that of course, but not treating it as an input device makes it less straightforward.  Of course this is not Google's fault or Asus' fault, just a Linux driver idiosyncrasy that is consistent between Android and all the Linux distros I've tried so far.", "Title": "Nice hardware", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Author": "Javier C.

Yes, I expected better from Google.Follow Up.  Since I was not going to try to go through the warranty system anyway, I decided to open the case and check the battery connection.  Opening the case voids the warranty of course.  The battery was not connected.  It appears to be a design fault that would even allow this to happen.  I won't bore you with the details but I was able to plug the battery in and get the device to accept a charge.

And you can tweet and find the closest Starbuck's or Costa's on it to boot, though given the form factor you will of course have to hunt and peck. Its major limitation is the rather scanty 32GB of internal storage, not much even by media player standards (more on that below).If, on the other hand, you have actual work to do, and want to use this device as a tablet computer, you'll probably be unhappy with it. The really big problems are the 32GB internal storage, lack of an SD card slot and the exclusive use of the MTP/PTP protocols for USB access to that internal storage, with consequently severe constraints on the ability to synchronize your own files to/from this tablet to any other machine. The first two might have been bearable (which was my calculation when buying the device), but the third (discovered only after my purchase) turns these limitations into a handicap. There are partial solutions to the problem (e.g. Nexus Media Importer, Dropbox, Stickmount, Samba, MTP mounting and a few MTP synch utilities, etc.), but many of them are tediously interactive (i.e. resistant to programming/scripting), none of them are completely satisfactory, and the less inadequate ones will all require rooting the device.I'm using Samba & Stickmount and thanks to FunkyFresh and Chainfire can probably live with it for a while, but I must say my encounter with the Asus/Google Nexus 7 has started me wondering about getting an actual tablet computer like Microsoft Surface or some other device that has been designed to support more than personal entertainment. In the meantime, I don't foresee decomissioning my Vaio anytime soon.Update:Rating revised to two stars. I'm replacing the Google/Asus device with a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8 that has SD Card extended storage.

It's really the perfect little tablet for media consumption. The screen is also a great size for games, it handled Angry Birds, Candy Crush and the other addictive games in the last year and a half without a problem.More recently I'd been using it as a kitchen clock and web browser to look up recipes and letting it sit on the Nexus 7 dock when not in use. This is when I started noticing that it would restart every so often, about a month of this and now it comes up with a screen asking for a password to decrypt the tablet. After searching the problem Google help told me this was a common problem and that Android couldn't read the SSD and thus assumes that encryption is turned on and asks for the password. Sometimes restarting it again brings it back to normal, other times not. It got worse and worse though to the point that now it restarts every 30 seconds loading the home screen and having several apps crash. I did a fresh restore back to stock Android, deleting all my information, as Google suggested. This seemed to work for all of about an hour. Now it's back to restarting non-stop. At this point I've had the tablet for 16 months. The original warranty was 12 months and the problems starting creeping up around 14 months. I was planning on getting more Nexus 7 tablets and even have a larger ASUS android tablet and 10\" ASUS Windows 8 tablet but after this I'm not buying another ASUS product again. At first I bought a C720 Chromebook to replace the Nexus 7 with but after getting two units that would shut off randomly I went to the HP Chromebook 11.", "Title": "SSD memory corrupted after 16 months", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Author": "M.

I read lots of people complaining that the 3G doesn't work... well, now you know! Take it to tech support and make them check the options.

However, the Nexus 7 (this has been corrected with the newer Nexus 7) only has a camera on the side of the screen. Yep, every front-facing picture you take will be taken blind without a view of what you are taking a picture of. To top it off, the system doesn't even come with software to run the camera. I have never understood why they would do that.

I am not an Apple fanboy by any means (I own 6 high-quality Android tablets/phones and am a mobility administrator for a billion dollar a year company so I touch hundreds of devices), but I prefer the iPad and iOS products both on and off of corporate networks. These are built well, but the Google Play Store is like a free-for-all. At least iTunes screens their apps thoroughly and you don't have to worry about your devices' integrity/security like you do with Android/Google Play.I bought two of these. One for my 9 and one for my 5 year old so they would stop fighting over my iPad. Guess what.......they still fight over the iPad.

I got these for a good price otherwise I would have purchased the iPad minis for them. I got 2 of these for $520, so I couldn't go wrong. $329 for a low end iPad mini is a little expensive.*** Update ***After less than a year of use, one doesn't allow charging anymore and the other is broken (my son's fault).

In that time I obviously have come to learn how to work with the OS, and have bought apps I'd like to not lose by switching to some other platform.  I've worked with the Android environment long enough to know what I like and don't like about this tablet.Pros:- Responsive- Good modern specs (good CPU/Ram)- Google keeps it up to date with the latest android versions.- Slim enough to fit in jeans pocket.Cons:- No camera other than front facing.- No HDMI output.- No cordless recharge (like in Nexus 4.)- Battery life could be longer.- Sometimes having it in jeans pocket rubs the power button which turns the screen on in your pocket.After using this since Christmas (it is 2/22/13 now) I can say I don't want to go back to a version of me that didn't have a tablet.  Ever.  I take this thing everywhere and whenever I want internet, I just use FoxFi on my RAZR Maxx.My RAZR Maxx has great battery life, so I'm spoiled.  The tablet has pretty darn good standby time, but the battery will drain noticeably while watching movies or working with the tablet a lot (bigger screen must take more energy.)Accessoris:- I got myself a pair of LG HB-730 Bluetooth stereo headphones.  Watching Netflix in the office has never been better.- I have bought case from Manvex which isn't perfect, but Manvex has great customer support.Conclusion:I think if this thing had a camera and HDMI out it would be an easy 5 stars.

Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase but I do have a few reservations that I feel are worth noting below.  Just so you all know where I'm coming from, I own the iPhone 4, a MacBook Pro, Mac Pro Tower and a Mac Mini.  I'm pretty well invested into the Apple world and would have gladly gone iPad but I didn't like the high price and the way Apple hijacks all your media to run through iTunes.  Turns out it was not as tricky as I feared it might be to break away from Apple.PROS:GREAT PERFORMANCE - The tablet is fast and responsive when I'm playing games or watching movies or surfing the web. This is a zippy little machine that can hold its own.BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY - very vibrant colors and good contrast.  I've been reading the Steve Jobs bio on here and it's a real treat! Some of the free game apps (such as Temple Run and Fruit Ninja look amazingly vibrant and lush)GOOD APPS - I was concerned about this one because Apple dominates in this field, but my needs are pretty basic: I wanted it to watch/listen/read media and maybe play some games.FORM FACTOR - It's very comfortable to hold/grip although I wish it was a little lighter.FLEXIBILITY - I love being able to plug my Nexus into my mac (any Mac) and open the home directory of the machine using the basic Android File Transfer Program.  No need for iTunes syncing/multiple libraries or being slave to what's available on Kindle - it's a drag and drop operation!PRICE - For the current price of the 32 GB Nexus, you can pick one up, a case and a stand and some apps and still come up well under the lowest price for the iPad Mini.CONSWEAK BATTERY - This is definitely the most disappointing aspect of the tablet.  The performance from the battery is poor even when it's in sleep mode!  If a full charge lasts through a whole day, it's doing well.  Just keep in mind you'll want to carry a separate cable or charger.NO HDMI OUTPUT - As a media guy, I'd love to use this to plug into someone's TV as a video player.  It's pretty lame Google nixed this feature in favor of their \"Nexus\" product (which I'm not going to purchase - it's more than the tablet itself!)NO SD SLOT - I did purchase the OTG cable but it's kind of lame to have to plug in a loose cable to expand your storage.  I'm not too heartbroken about this tho - 32 GB is a lot and as I mentioned, it's easy to move content on/off the machine.WEAK SPEAKERS - They can perform OK in a quiet room at home but out in public or a semi-noisy room and you will need to work out an alternativeOn the whole, it's a lovely little tablet that is a great foray into the 7\" tablet game from Google.

Don't get me wrong, I used to be a big fan of Apple's nano, their touch, and the iPad, but I've just gotten so disgusted over the years with Apple for the following reasons:1. being forced to sync/dock to iTunes (only to have my entire music library accidentally deleted more than once)2. having to go through gymnastics and gerry-rig other third party apps to try and place my iTunes library on more than one computer or more than one Apple product (all which I own, mind you), and STILL not having something sync up (either music, or pictures, or movies or books etc.)3. having to pay a HUGE premium to get a little extra memory (which cannot be expanded).4. Let's not forget the dopey non-replaceable battery.5Let's move on to the Nexus and I'll explain why this is so fantastic.  First thing, EVERYTHING is sync'd effortlessly over WiFI.  Updates to their operating system, all their apps...EVERYTHING. No more having to sync with a computer app (iTunes).  And when you're tired of an app, you just un-install it right on the device (seems quite obvious to me, but not to Apple. they make you go through iTunes again). And trust me, there are thousands of fantastic and free apps...for music, games, magazines, productivity, calendars, phoe calls over wifi, twitter, facebook EVERYTHING!!!!And guess what, nearly limitless storage on the Nexus. Yes, it has a fixed internal memory and no card slot, but just buy a $2.99 app (called Media to Go) and buy a $2.00 usb to usb micro connector cord and you can store movies, books, music everything on a little SD card. Simply connect the card to the Nexus and you're good to go. You can save all the precious on-board memory in the tablet for processing. And this same set up let's you connect a mouse, a keyboard, nearly anything. And it works flawlessy on the Nexus. No drivers, or special connectors needed (unlike Apple which constantly changes their docking connections, ports, chargers etc.).And the speed of this thing is LIGHTNING fast....quicker than my 2g ipad.  (oh, and although it's not advertised, the battery on the tablet IS replaceable. Just snap off the back cover and snap in a battery).The look and feel of this device is amazing. Magazines, pictures, games (Temple Run 2 anyone???) looks and works flawlessly.  Nearly every day, someone on the subway asks me how I like the device and that they're going to get one as well.  The screen is great, and the back cover has sort of a rubbery coating that makes holding this thing a pleasure (and no more smudges).Guys, if you've been holding off for a tablet, please try this out yourself or talk to someone who owns one.  I am so happy I purchased this (as opposed to the iPad mini which I looked at for quite awhile).  The Nexus 7 is more value for your money, expandable and in my humble opinion, a superior product.", "Title": "WOW....glad I finally broke the strings from Apple.

Not as many choices as the Apple Store, but it's getting there.Build quality is outstanding. Love the rubberized, grippy back.Books look great on the 7 inch screen, and the G.P market has plenty of them.It's good to know you'll always be first in line for updates.The smaller 7 inch screen size is very good for smaller hands, and also for playing games that use the gyroscope, like Riptide GP.The processor is blazing fast! No frame rate issues at all with Tegra 3 games like Dead Trigger or Riptide GP. Project Butter also makes the user interface zippy and responsive.Chrome is standard.Ehh:Decent screen resolution. Pixels are barely visible, only if you look very closely.Screen isn't very bright.No storage expansion, so go for the 32gb model. That should be enough for the average joe.Charging isn't very quick.No rear camera. Not that I would take pictures with it anyway.Cons:My unit (bought from hhgregg) had a busted speaker.Screen size. In the days where most new smartphones are upwards of 4 inches diagonal, a 7 inch tablet just doesn't seem like a good investment.Screen is too small for web browsing, in my opinion.The large bezels on the top/bottom and small bezels on the sides make the tablet feel unnecessarily narrow.Conclusion:Unfortunately, because of the speaker issue, small screen area, and an issue with booting up the device, I had to return my Nexus 7 just 2 weeks after I got it for Christmas. However, Asus makes great products and I just ordered my Transformer Infinity. This tablet will be great for younger kids who just want to watch movies, read books, and play games, but for someone like me that will use it for email, web browsing, and taking notes, I would recommend going for a 10 inch screen tablet (Nexus 10 or Transformer Infinity are my two non-iPad recommendations).", "Title": "Nexus 7 review", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Author": "Miss K V Scholts", "ReviewID": "R1FD3ZNQUSO5CG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet as I had it on loan from someone prior and was very impressed with the ease of use and user friendly interface.Although the iPad battery life is superior this tablet has no need for difficult file conversions to add films to it, is easy to hold and on top is great value for money.Am very happy with this purchase", "Title": "Great Tablet - Good Value for money!", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "13 Ways And Counting", "ReviewID": "R2F6W0A1XIEG2U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third android based tablet. My previous tablets were $200 appx tablets purchased from Chinese sellers on various websites. It was an effort to save money on the more reliable models from HTC, Motorola, and Samsung. They wereok but there was typically no access to the Google app store without rooting the device. There were always battery and screen issues as well.I was very excited about having am official Google device. This thing performs. It is fast and smooth. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it is a super phone. This tablet performs just as well as that phone. I have found myself going to my nexus 7 before my S3 unless I need to make a phone call.YouTube is fantastic on here, Twitter and Facebook are more engaging on the larger screen, and the games like fruit ninja are much more enjoyable. Internet browsing on the chrome browser is excellent.The screen size is perfect for ebooks through the kindle app. Speaking of the kindle; this tablet absolutely smokes the kindle fire. You get the benefits of what a kindle offers through the app and the benefits of an open android os.I would advise ordering a screen protector, rubber/silicone case, and a USB drive adapter. The essential app you will need is called the nexus media importer off the play store for a few dollars. It allows you to transfer content from a USB drive to the device. Movies, music, pictures, you can move it all with the app and cable.My best experience so far with this tablet has been using the ultimate guitar app to view tabs while I play guitar. I put the nexus on a universal tablet stamd purchased on amazon for viewing - I find the \"leather\" cases with built in flip stands to not only be ugly and bulky but seriously tacky as well.Overall this is a fantastic tablet and unless you're and apple fan or locked into their micro-economy (iTunes) get this tablet. It will do everything you want it to do at a great price point.", "Title": "Awesome new toy!", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Author": "Abhishek", "ReviewID": "R1JG2XI9WN7JBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When google initially announced the nexus 7, I was rather skeptical of it, because the tablet market was already dominated by the iPad and a $200 tablet wouldnt be able to compete with it.But now, it has proved otherwise. It is completely changing the tablet market along with the kindle fire and introduced a new sub category within the tablet section.Starting off, the nexus 7 is still not officially available in India, so I had to purchase it through a friend in Dubai. I got the 16GB WiFi only version, a few weeks back.At the first look, the soft rubberised back makes it a pleasure to hold it and you wont feel the pain to holding it upright unlike an ipad.The screen is a 7\" one, which is smaller than the iPad and the resolution is almost comparable. I was rather uncomfortable with such a large bezel at the periphery, but it actually makes it easier to hold wile reading a book or browsing the web.Coming to the software, it runs android 4.2 out of the box, and that is the latest version released by Google. Since it runs pure android without any customization by the manufacturer, and the tablet is made by google, you'll get the updates as soon as they are released. Many of the samsung tablets are only now getting their Ice Cream Sandwich update, whch is just sad, because Samsung customizes the tablet by changing the skin and adding the Touch Wiz UI.The tablet has front facing camera with is good for video calls, skype, google + hangouts etc, but only if you prop it up properly so that it is aligned with your face. In the potrait mode, it becomes rather uncomfortable to use when video calling because the camera is located in the right side or the left side and the camera lens does not have a wide angle to cover more angle.The device comes with Wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 and what not. The initail setup was very easy if you have a google account. All it asks you to do is to connect to a WiFi network and sign into your google account. It takes care of the rest. Once you start the Google + app, it automatically pulls your profile picture from there and props it into your user account in the tablet. All your mail, calender, contacts are synced. THe best part about Jelly Bean 4.2 is the user accounts.My dad uses a corporate account for syncing and it contains much sensitive information. This is where user acoounts realy shines. All I had to do was to sign in with his email account and right in the lockscreen, it provides you an option to log into either one of the accounts. The two accounts are no way connected to each other and my dad's and my data are separate.The screen is beautiful and you'll love to use it. The tablet has a power button at the right edge and the volume rocker there too. Nowhere else are there any buttons. The charging port it at the bottom and so is the 3.5mm Headphone jack.The battery lasts pretty long, even with wifi turned on, It remained for over a week with low usage and a full day with heavy gaming and video streaming.You can find plenty of apps on the play store, and even though people say that there are not many tablets apps, it is still sufficient for the average user. Most of the apps will look clear in landscape mode also, but some of them become slightly blurred.One aspect that I didnt like about the Nexus 7 is the fact that it doesnt have touch sensitive keys below the screen. When running apps there is a small black band which shows buttons for the home, return and the most recent apps keys but they take up a some screen space and make the apps look slightly stretched.The presence of the Quad Core Nvidia tegra 3 really is felt at all times. The UI is so smooth, even with the memory full and a couple of apps running.Overall, I personally recommend this device to anyone who wants a tablet, but is not a Apple fanboy.", "Title": "Nexus 7, brilliant tablet by Go0gle", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Author": "Mikey likes it", "ReviewID": "R31KTC5EGAMD2Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being my first tablet purchase, I debated on whether to get a 7\" or 10\" and whether to go for an ipad or something else. My decision to get the Nexus 7 was a good one. It's the perfect size - light and compact enough to bring anywhere while large enough to be effective for viewing videos. It's great as an e-reader. The width allows it to be held with one hand like a paperback book, which is harder to do with the wider ipad mini. The virtual keyboard is just right - in portrait mode I can thumb-type much faster and more accurately than with my smartphone. In landscape I type even faster using three fingers of each hand. Quality is excellent and the screen resolution is higher than the ipad mini, which doesn't have the retina display. Movies are large enough to be enjoyed. 32gb is a good size, providing ample storage especially when supplemented by cloud storage. It's the perfect personal organizer and can take the place of my laptop in most travel situations. Android Jelly Bean is fantastic and though there currently aren't as many android apps as IOS apps, most of the truly useful ones exist. Since I got the Nexus, I hardly use my smartphone for anything other than calls. My laptop use has also decrease a lot, as many things are just faster and easier to do on a tablet.The minor complaints I have are: 1) there's no rear facing camera. I had assumed it would at least have a basic one and I was surprised after receiving it that it didn't; 2) the audio quality through the headphone jack is okay, but don't expect audiophile quality. My ipod touch sounds way better; and 3) the speaker is rear facing, at the bottom edge. None of these are significant flaws, given what I use it for and in light of the price. Get one. You'll love it.A few accessories I recommend are a USB adaptor which lets you expand storage by using a thumb drive, a bluetooth speaker like the JBL Flip (great for music streaming and watching movies) on the Nexus 7 and a case (the Blurex N7 case is great).

This one was supposed to be the best 7-inch android tablet, but I'm questioning that notion. I own the Galaxy tab 2 7.0 as well, and to be perfectly honest, I think that Samsung's personal touches to the Android software makes it a winner over the Nexus line. I can't seem to find a battery-saving mode on the Nexus, the buttons are all in the most awkward locations, and there is no way to expand or import memory through memory cards. it seems the battery dies out way too quickly, even when in stand-by mode. It seems to take a long time to charge. The screen only looks a bit sharper and brighter than other tablets I used.I wouldn't say that this is \"bad\". Not at all. But I think that Samsung's Galaxy is a better choice. The only drawback in the competition is that their hard drives don't come with more memory (if I could've got a 32gb Galaxy 2 7.0, I wouldn't have bought this Nexus 7). I wanted this for video games, apps, movies, music, etc. It holds 32gb, and it feels like I can download half the Play store without seeing a dent in memory. But in reality, I think that the \"pure Google experience\" is not as nice as people made it sound. There are too many features I enjoy that are missing.But as things are right now with the competition, I'd still highly recommend this. It's portable enough to fit in a bookbag, purse, laptop bag, or even pants pockets, it does almost everything you could want a tablet to do, it's fast, it holds a lot of stuff (the 32 gb version), and it has a lot of potential in the right hands.

The keyboard would sporadically appear, then in the middle of typing in the username, the keyboard would just disappear.  The operating system runs very slow as well, and sometimes crashes.  When I plug my SD card reader into the S3 android phone micro usb charging port, the file structure on the SD card is immediately displayed.  On the Nexus, I had to pay $4.00 for an app to use micro usb port.

I will admit that I am not very experienced with tablets since this is my first one, which makes it so I have nothing to compare it to, but it also tells you about its simplicity, but that doesn't mean it has no customization. Andriod is very very customizable. I'll start off by throwing out a few things that are pros and cons in my book.pros:Very solid product, comfortable to hold, and light.It has amazing battery life.The screen quality is right out superb for a $200ish tablet.It's a nexus, which causes you to get very prompt OS updates giving you the latest of Andriod.Speakers - they put out better sound then many laptops I have seen.It is very simple device to root.There are sleep covers for it so that it doesn't waste battery life when not in use.WiFi reception is good, not amazing, but good.Bluetooth works pretty well. I like using a Bluetooth speaker while using the shower to keep the tablet away from the steam.Charges & syncs using micro-usb so it is easier to find accessories.It normally is a pretty speedy tablet.With buying a simple, three dollar, app you can connect external storage, it doesn't even require rooting.It costs half as much as many comparable tablets benchmark wise making it a great deal.The back, as apposed to some tablets, is not a finger print magnet and it is not slippery.The Nexus is very comparable to the Kindle Fire HD but the nexus runs pure Andriod so it is much more customizable. With the Kindle Fire you are completely locked in Amazon's ecosystem unless you root it, but with the Nexus you can get the Google Play Store and then buy apps for Amazon, Nook, and such, so it gives you much more options.Neutral Comments:Size - seven inches is perfect for me. It may or may not be perfect for you, but it was for me.It runs Android which i like but it will depend on the person. The classic Andriod vs. iOS, which you'll have to decide for yourself which is best for your individual propose.It doesn't cost as much if you buy it from other retailers.Negative:It's a Nexus causing you to get very prompt updates, which sometimes are slightly buggy causing a little lag at times. You get to be used a little like a guinea pig at times. since the 4.2.1 update it has needed reboot two times, but before that it never had to. I am sure it is very temporary thing, and will be fixed soon.There is a lack of compatible apps, let alone optimized for the screen, but the Play Store is growing rapidly, so that's just a matter of time.On a side note, one thing that annoys me with this, and other tablets as well, is there pricing. let me elaborate, charging up to 50 dollars more for only 16 gigs of extra memory is a little steep causing Google to get more off those who need more memory.  I just wish that they'd not be quite as unfair against those of us that need more memory, but that is against all tablet makers not just google/asus.  That said, it is just an amazing deal for a tablet. I have  even read multiple places that Google it taking a loss on the tablet and just hoping to recoup the money through data collection and apps.  so for the price you can't do any better.Finally, I'd like to say, I have owned my tablet for three months and, overall, I am very pleased with it.

I copied several GB of music files to the device and I can even see them in the folders, but the device does not recognize them.  I downloaded several apps that are supposed to 'correct' the problem, but they either crashed or failed to have any effect.C'mon now, why is this soooo difficult to do?  So far, no music and no obvious fix.The screens are not intuitive.  I cannot figure out why some screens appear out of nowhere and are sometimes empty.  There is no obvious means of managing the screens or icons.  I cannot figure out how to move icons around in order to put the most used ones on the first screen.  It goes on and on...(I have an iPhone and find that it's design is much more elegant with respect to managing content.)There is no native camera app.  You must download a special application to use the camera.

Games work well, but editing ANYTHING (email, documents, etc.) is worse than a chore.  Try moving the cursor to a point in the text where editing is needed. It's so incredibly tedious to edit text that I end up retyping the entire word or sentence instead of changing it. I usually end up back in front of my server to do the task. Reading email works reasonably well, responding to email is just frustrating.I am guessing that Apple copywrited the 'better' editing methodology and the Android devices are not allowed to use it.

Worked fine from 11/27/12 until 12/16/12 when I tried to turn it on and nothing happened. I checked charger and it will charge other devices so the problem is not in the charger, the tablet just seems like it's completely dead and won't take a charge. $255 and didn't even last three weeks, I am very disappointed with this product ASUS put there name on. I waited a long while and did much research before deciding to purchase a tablet, tying to let all the kinks and bug out but evidently they still don't have it together, should have just went with an iPad. What really pisses me off is the tablet isn't even 30 days old and hasn't been turned on more than 15 or 20 times and now I HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE IT SHIPPED FOR A RMA...ASUS YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE! It was $19.86 to ship it back to you!! Last ASUS product I will ever purchase due to horrible hardware lifespan, having to pay shipping to have a practically brand new tablet I just bought repaired, the fact my son won't have his tablet on Xmas, and very poor customer service. I will make sure to tell everyone I am in college with and students I tutor IT for to never buy an ASUS product. It doesn't take but once for me and on to the next brand, esp considering all the trouble I went to to get it and now my son won't have his big Xmas present on Christmas morning because ASUS and Google are producing cheap tablets that aren't worth buying, especially if they're gonna be DOA or only last a few weeks.", "Title": "DEAD in 18 Days!!!", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer \"beroez\"", "ReviewID": "R1T72Q0YYBB0FN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I agree with the review of Pearl1312, I have the same experience.
