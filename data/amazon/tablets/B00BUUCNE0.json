I bought this to take with me when I travel out of town so I don't have to hall my laptop with me. Anyway, I fully charged it before I began to add my favorite apps and it's a bit slow to me. I have been using my smartphone for internet access until my new laptop was delivered since my old one was stolen. My phone is faster using the same WI-FI so I'm not to thrilled. I will use this and test it out over the weekend and see how it goes. Pros: It's not bad for the price and screen size is great. I got this about $8 cheaper than Walmart. Cons: I can't figure out how to log out of my Yahoo email and I couldn't log into My Fitness Pal app using my Facebook account, I kept getting error and had to log in using password.", "Title": "A bit slow", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "Haley Fosdick", "ReviewID": "R1849IF2ORW6P8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would recommend this product for younger kids, I would not recommend this product for older adults trying to play games.", "Title": "It works great!
