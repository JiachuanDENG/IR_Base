This Xperia S is much better. Better picture, better product design and better software ( upgradable to Android 4.1 aka Jelly Bean). At 9.4\", the screen is quiet big but now there are tablets in the 10\" category that are probably even better. I enjoy using the Xperia S for a lot of things, but really I like reading newspapers like The New York Times on it in the morning when I wake up. You can also read books on it. I do not use Sony's own Reader store because, in my opinion, it needs improvement, but I have Google Books and might start using Amazon Kindle app for newspaper subscriptions. Google Books has so many free books you can take advantage of. But this is not only a ebook reader. I have also used it to listen to music and even watch Netflix outdoors on the front yard. It amazingly controls some of my Sony-branded electronic devices (TV, DVD player, hi-fi stereo and home theater). The remote feature, however, isn't as convenient or powerful as a standard remote and, therefore, won't replace the ones that came with my devices. For the most part, it is a good tablet, a true alternative to the iPad which, I admit, is definitely a good product to have as well. Sony has since released a newer version just this past spring but I'm happy I purchased this one.

The only device better is Galaxy Note 2 (>6000).Playing live TV with HD HomeRun is fine while Galaxy Tab 2 failed to perform.It takes standard size SD (good for cameraman for instant review). The latest R6B ROM even support FAT64 FS, so you can use 128GB or higher standard size SDXC.The screen looks clear and sharp, but the white looks slightly orange (I checked all other models with same screen problem).The tablet uses new Sony uniport, so I have to buy host cable, HDMI adapter, and extra data cable to carry and leave another at home.This model has a HUGE plus which may be overlooked: 5V charging. It can be charged with original charger, or with iPad charger, or Samsung Galaxy Tab charger, or any USB charger with 5V 2A output.There is a ridge on the back which is used as attachment with OEM Sony case, but I also found even a box of Kleenex can give it a support with \"just right\" viewing angle.Pro:Nearly 180 degrees viewing angle from any direction.Rather fast quad-core 1.4GHz CPU.Standard SDHC (or 128GB or higher with latest R6B ROM) support.Rather loud when playing music or TV through Slingplayer.8mpx rear cam with auto focus (but there's no flashlight).A special ridge on the back which can be put on the Kleenex box for viewing support.5V USB charging.Con:Proprietary port (it can be costly to buy cables).Orange-tint screen (a reason why it lost a star).Limited and rather expensive accessories.Special note for root users: if you plan to root this tablet, you have to be aware NOT to update through internet connection. Check dedication forum in xda for more details.HD HomeRun users: you can purchase HomeRun TV and MX player from Play Store. The latter provides multiple local file format support.Since the tablet is having promotion ($330 on the unit itself and half price on accessories from Sony online store), this is the best chance to get it and I found it sold out rather quick.", "Title": "much better than Galaxy Tab 2 with ONE exception", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Author": "cyun", "ReviewID": "R6CHUBETOFQWX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The best part about this Xperia Tablet is the SD card slot.  I bought a 64GB card, and voila, my memory quadrupled from 16gb to 80GB.  There is also the option of buying the 128GB card which gives you the storage space of some ultrabooks.  The brightness, colors of the screen, and slim factor are all pluses for me.  In addition, the fold makes it easier to hold with one hand, and makes it possible for Sony to come up with some clever accessories.  On the downside, the screen is way too reflective in sunlight, and the bezel is still too think, especially compared with the iPad mini.  The resolution, while good for movies, isn't as great for reading text, but I just hold the tablet further away from my eyes than I do with my phone and the problem disappears.  While moderately colorful, the colors appear washed out compared to those on the screen of my Xperia S.

Stephens", "ReviewID": "RS9NL4015QYDH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Updated review:There was a software update the other day and the wifi issue for me is resolved. The keyboard is also better. Upping my review to 4 stars. This is a solid tablet now. There are tablets I've owned that I'd rate slightly higher but you won't be disappointed with the Sony.Original review follows:The bottom line:Unless you really want the remote control feature wait on buying this tablet until they fix the wireless problem.  At the moment this is at best a three star device.The details:I've had my Sony Xperia 9.4 for several days now and comparing it against my previous tablet, a Motorola xoom (which I'd rate 5 stars), the Sony could be better.It does a few things better than the xoom:- The sound is better (probably due to the better placed speakers which are on the bottom edge instead of on the back like on the xoom).- It's lighter- It's faster- The display seems crisper- (The remote control feature sounds cool but I won't comment on it as I haven't tried it and won't use it since I already have an RF harmony remote)However I was disappointed in how many ways this tablet failed me compared to the xoom.  Sony is usually better than this.Ergonomics:  I bought this partly for Ergonomics and surprisingly it fails.  The edges are too sharp and after holding it a while while laying on my back back in bed reading/browsing it tends to cut into my palms and is uncomfortable.  My xoom was more comfortable to hold for long periods by comparison even though it was heavier.Problems with the wireless broadband:  This is the major problem for me right now and apparently for another recent reviewer.  The wireless usually doesn't go on when you wake the device up, you have to go fiddle with the wireless settings.  Sometimes even fiddling with the settings won't work and I have to power it down and then back up.  I have a feeling they tried to fix this before shipping because I've gone to the settings and seen it trying to do something--it's stuck in a loop automatically turning on the wireless and then turning it back off over and over until I power it down.  I never had such problems with the xoom.  I expect this will be fixed in a future update as it's probably just a software issue but I would not buy this device until it is fixed as flawless wireless should be expected at a minimum on a tablet.Keyboard Issues: I noticed some minor funkiness with the keyboard input in some input fields.  Sometimes the keyboard doesn't appear when I touch an input field until I hit it a 2nd or 3rd time.  Also inputting my password in the Netflix app was very difficult for some reason most key-touches weren't registering.  I never had such problems on the xoom.  Again I think this is a problem that will go away with a software update, but right now it's annoying.Connector: As other reviewers have said, the proprietary connector is a mistake.  It's not a stopper for me but it will keep the tablet from ever being a five star device for most people.  If we wanted proprietary connector drama we'd buy apple instead of android.Battery Life: From my usage the battery life on the Xperia is not as good as the xoom, but the xoom is tough to beat there (and the Xperia is a faster CPU which might be more power hungry).Overall the device is ok but with the competition out there it should be better.  Sony, I know you're probably reading this so fix the software problems above and I'll change my review to 4 stars.  But due to the sharp edges and funky connector it's not a 5 star device, sorry.", "Title": "Updated review after problems addressed", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Author": "Jaeden Hudson", "ReviewID": "R2INXNL815Z3S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It has good points and bad points.Good points, The display is awesome for its 1280x800 resolution.

Obviously Sony bought it and did not bother to update the database with their own product database.The only way I could set up my AV Receiver (Denon) is to program the codes one by one, and the detector is extremely flaky, not nearly sensitive enough, and the program crashes about every 4th key I program.Other than YouTube, NetFlix and Hulu, the rest of the Videos and Pics are obviously designed to make money for Sony.Tried to install Chromecast, app installed fine, but can't cast Chrome (I guess it is an Android thing), and none of the videos I tried other than YouTube would cast either.  I did not try NetFlix nor Hulu, I'm not subscribed.  Flash is not supported (I think other Android platforms do, but I'm not sure).Screen is glossy and gets fingerprinted very quickly.
