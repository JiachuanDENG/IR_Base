After approx. one month, a section of the screen would not respond to touch. Everything else worked great. I contacted tech support on Feb 6th and they sent me a shipping label to send it in for repair. They sent a ground shipping label so it got there on Feb15th. They repaired it and sent it back 2nd day delivery on Feb18. The repair ticket said that they replaced the screen. I received it Feb 20th. When I turned it on, I discovered that they deleted all my data and it was still doing the same thing.I called them back the same day and asked for a replacement since they didn't fix it. They refused to replace the tablet and wanted it sent back for repair again. I went through the same process again. I sent it off Feb 21st, they received it Feb 26th and sent it out to me on March 7th. The repair ticket said they replaced the screen. So I was prepared for what I would find...and yes, it still wasn't fixed.I called them back the next day. March 8th. They were so nice on the phone and apologetic. They told me they would send me a new one. The girl that helped me clearly did not know what she was doing because she would tell me one thing, put me on hold, come back and apologize then tell me something else. She told me that my tablet would be replaced with a new one. Then she said I could provide a credit card payment and a new tablet would be sent right away. She put me on hold, came back and told me I couldn't do the credit card and that I would have to send my tablet in and once it was received I would be sent a new one. Next she told me she would send me a shipping label. She kept trying to send the label but it would not show up in my email. She put me on hold and then came back and told me that my replacement had to be approved. She said I would receive a label in 2 to 3 business days.I finally received my shipping label after contacting the CEO via their website. I received the shipping label March 19th. They received the tablet March 27th. I just got a email today April 2nd that they don't have my 32GB model in stock so they can either send me a 16GB model or give me my money back.I will gladly take my money back and get something else so I won't have to go through their tech support again. Now I am just wondering how long it will take to get my money back!UPDATE! the refund takes 15 to 20 working days to be sent out. I think that is pretty lame since they have had my tablet tied up since Feb 6th and it is now April 3rd. Now I have another month to wait. To me, this is a poor way to do business.", "Title": "Poor Tech  and Company Support", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "Beer Shark", "ReviewID": "R1YGZBBKAZQYJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll start with some quick disclaimers about my purchase and my experiences:-This was not an amazon purchase, as when I decided to make the purchase, the store right next door had it in stock at the same price, so why wait the two days.-I purchased mine in late January, and as such, my entire experience has been with the updated software, so perhaps before that upgrade, there was more room for improvement.  I can only speak to what its like after the update, which is what anyone reading this would dealing with anyway.-The only other tablet I have owned was the original Kindle Fire.  (However, I am by no means a novice with technology, and I am very aware of the more popular products and their function.)With that out of the way, The Samsung Galaxy note 10.1 is everything I was looking for and more.  I had originally just been looking for a cheap way to have my notes taken digitally, as I am a graduate student and cannot tell you how much time I havespent writing, rewriting, and losing notebooks.  Nothing in the \"cheap\" price range came close to what I really wanted from it (a simple tablet like thing I could write on, I wasn't even looking for any other features or a tablet per say.)I saw the Note 10.1 and it seemed to be too good to be true.  The videos showed it doing everything I wanted.  So, I dove into the \"professional\" reviewers.  As many here can attest (and have), those reviews were often less than glowing.  The screen wasn't good enough for the price, the build was flimsy, the multi tasking was flawed and lacking, and so on.  All these reviews painted a picture of a first generation attempt that needed serious improvement.  So, I kept looking around, hoping to find something else, with better reviews, to fit my needs.  In the course of that search I came across all the forums and customer reviews of the Note 10.1.  The users themselves LOVE the note.  You'll hear the same thing everywhere you look at customer reviews, forget the \"professionals\" this device is amazing, it is what you are looking for, and you won't regret it for a moment.The exterior build itself is perhaps the most valid criticism.  There is some give around the back edges and it doesn't feel like a piece of metal you could use as a hammer.  If that's what you're looking for, then I'd suggest just that, you clearly don't want a tablet, you want a hammer.  I keep mine in a flip case, for protection and the stand, while it's in there all those previously mentioned (and VERY minor) details about the build disappear.  It's not flimsy, it's just not an actual rock.Battery life has been terrific for me.  I use this thing almost non stop every single day.  I will say, I don't watch a ton of video on it, but I do keep on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, autosync, gps, etc.  I've had almost no need to take any steps to conserve the battery, because it lasts far longer than I've ever needed it to.  The only thing I did do was turn off auto screen brightness and put it at the level I liked, when auto was on, it kept changing the brightness when I didn't want to.  I'd suggest you do the same.The screen.  It's well documented that the Note 10.1's screen is \"not as good as\" the other products in the same price range.  That's fair, it isn't \"as good.\"  That also begs the question, how good do you need it to be?  I don't look at my screen and notice any problems.  It's 10 inches.  Larger screens would suffer more from the specs, smaller screens it's almost irrelevant.  Again, how good does your screen need to be?  Are you just buying a tablet as something to watch movies on and you're extremely finicky about it?  Then go elsewhere, this isn't for you.  Here's a better point about the screen, what other tablets in the price range use the Wacom technology, the pressure sensitivity, etc?  How much do people pay for just a Wacom pad?Which brings me to the Spen.  The pressure sensitivity.  The ability to hand write on whatever you're working with.  As I student, I have filled up volumes of notes.  I've spent countless hours rewriting work because it needed to be cleaned up for others.  I've filled up notebooks, then the next semester, they are gone and I'm starting over.  I cannot tell you how much time I've spent trying to find notes on some a particular item buried in with everything else.  The Note 10.1 has put an end to that.  My notes are in a file right from the start.  I upload them to dropbox and can get them anywhere I am.  I can email them.  I can reorganize them with the touch of a button.  It's been a life saver, a time saver, and a stress saver.You can even use the S pen to cut and paste parts of the screen to another program.  It's as easy as holding the s pen button and\"circling\" a border around what you want.  I personally use it to grab items like graphs or HW questions from my pdf textbooks and drop them into my notes.The Samsung apps that use the s Pen are all pretty good.  S note is nice, but it has some baffling flaws that almost make it seem like they made it, and then just didn't listen to any user feedback.  Lots of little things that I want to do when note taking (cut and paste (not screen shot), locked zoom, blank template, etc) you simply cannot do in S notes.  so THANK GOD FOR LECTURE NOTES.  Lecture notes is an app, that if you get the Note 10.1, it should be mandatory for you to download.  It's what S notes should be.  Without it, I'd still love my Note, but there would be those minor frustrations.  Lecture Notes does everything you could want and more.  It makes the Note 10.1 indispensable for a student.  I don't know what I'd do without it, and I cringe at the thought of going back to the way it used to be.I bought the 16gb version.  Apps can only be installed to the built in sd card.  For me, 16gb's there is more than enough.  I have a 32 gb card in the slot where I keep my textbooks, etc.  I don't know how people can use up the systems 16gb with apps.  What the hell are you people installing???Multitasking, (again, since the update) is great.  I keep open a notebook, and a textbook or powerpoint slides (which you can write directly on, as with pdf's etc) and just click through one while jotting down notes.  You can do it with the video player, youtube, etc as well.  Can you do it with every app?  No, but I do feel that the apps you can do it with cover such a broad range themselves that there really isn't much of anything missing.  And hey, if you want to use one program full screen, switching back and forth between a few things is extremely easy as well.  Even taking a partial screen shot with the pen, it makes it very easy to choose right then and there where you want to take that screen grab in other programs.I think I've covered everything I intended to, and then some.  Most tablets out there are effectively for passive media consumption.  Sure, you can take pictures, etc, but mostly you're just watching videos, looking at slides, and having access to what has previously been done.  With the Note 10.1 you can actually get things done.  To me, this is what a tablet should be.  It is small, portable, and makes me more productive, not less.If that's what you're looking for, then this is what you want.  If you want a device that will allow you to get more done, and keep it all more organized, then here it is.  If you want to just stream videos and take pictures of food, you should go elsewhere, this isn't for you and you wouldn't even know what to do with it.I don't know when the next generation of this will come along, so I don't know when there will be a new and improved iteration of this, but don't put it off because you want them to work out bugs.  This is a well made machine that will be a productivity aid.  With the addition of the Lecture Notes app, any frustrations have disappeared.", "Title": "Everything I wanted and then some.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Author": "Dan Zapix", "ReviewID": "R25B4OB8TPZW3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Copy and paste of a comment I left on XDA forums about the Galaxy Note 10.1 + additional comments.================2 weeks ago I had nothing good to say about tablets at all. Nothing. If anything, I thought they were in general a silly idea if you already owned a smartphone, even more so since Windows OS laptops can be had for similiar prices, and do infinitely more if portability is the point of it. I don't travel much, so I don't need a laptop. My phone is enough for the rare times I do so I can check my email. I already have 2 desktops, so all my in home computing needs are met.So might wonder why I got a Galaxy Note 10.1 last week. O.oHere's how it happened.WARNING! Incoming sleep inducing story!1. First thing I noted was the S-Pen. I hadn't seen a stylus used with tablets before, so it caught my attention just briefly enough to look at it. (like a worm on a hook.)2. After being lured into watching a video about it, I noted the drawing and writing abilities of the Note 10.1. Haven't drawn in years, but that could be fun. Started seeing this as a device to do everything I do on my phone with a bigger screen and let my phone do what it does best... Be a phone. (I'm now interested in the worm. Enough to add it to my amazon wishlist to think about it.)3. Started reading reviews and learned about the hardware. Ugh. Lacking Tegra 3, doesn't have any real dock. Reviewers raving about some Asus Transformer thing. (lure moving away, losing interest...)4. The more I thought about it though... Was Tegra 3 really THAT important? I looked at a list of Tegra 3 games. Not important. Keyboard dock... Wait, I already decided if I wanted a laptop, I'd get a laptop. The lure was the S-Pen. Being able to reach over in the morning, grab the tablet and read the news, email, etc. A senseless luxury item no doubt.5. Went to Best Buy to see them personally. Played around with a Tab 2 and the Transformer. Didn't see the Note 10.1 at first. Was mostly decided on the Note, and then I saw one on the other end of the store. Took me maybe a minute before I knew I was getting a Note 10.1. (nevermind the hook, somebody threw a grenade into the water!)What sold me?The s-pen, the way it felt in my hands vs the other tablets. Picture quality is all I could ask for, and would be great to watching Netflix or something in bed. I'm already familiar with Samsung products having had an Epic 4G phone for almost 2 years, and recently just upgraded to a Galaxy SIII... So things like TouchWiz, rooting, and overall expectations are well known to me. No *NEW* brand surprises.To each their own though for whatever reasons somebody wants a tablet. I think the Note 10.1 is great though, and in the few days I have owned it, I have used it a lot. I have to admit it's nice to have an android device where I'm not worried about the battery level all the time as I have with my phone(s)================I've had it for a week now, and I find it hard to put down. The S Pen is a charm to use. I find myself just doodling on it because I can, or using it to browse through RSS feeds like a digital news paper. Point and tap, no finger prints! I also love the fact I can write by hand with this. I rarely write by hand anymore, but now I do it for the fun of it.It handles gaming very well. Hardcare tablet gamers will probably want to look to a tegra enabled tablet, but there are not a lot of tegra games so I see little point in helping nvidia cause division in the market. and make no mistake... The S Pen is useful with games!The battery seems to last a long time as I can squeeze 2~3 days of use out of it before needing to recharge and that is with moderate use throughout the day. Don't get me wrong though, I could probably burn through the battery if I used it all day.On screen typing btw is good. Samsung's keyboard works well here unless the tiny useless touchscreen keyboards on a phone (including my Galaxy S3). In both landscape and portrait it is easy to use and and accurate.Overall, I am amazed at just how much I am enjoying my Note 10.1.", "Title": "First tablet, exceeded my expectations!", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Author": "Nak", "ReviewID": "RUPENZF9ZX6V7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Note 10.1 16GB, and I would return it in a heartbeat if it wasn't well worth the asking price. The thing is, it is. Even without the pen, it's hands down the best Android tablet out today. The screen isn't as high a resolution as some, that is true. However, the vast majority of people will never notice that; all they will notice is the beautiful, crisp and clear screen. If you have great eyes, are under 40, and like holding the tablet right up to your face to see the difference, sure you will see the smallest fonts are slightly pixelated. Other than that, this tablet just plain works. Simple, but true. Everything just plain works. No force closes, no hang ups, no problems with video or PDF rendering. Everything is quick and smooth. Just like an Ipad, without an Ipad's limitations. Performance wise, it's the fastest tablet available today, yes benchmarks and real world performance beats all comers, including the new Ipad.It is true that many reviews are negative, not from real world users though. Trot on over to XDA-Developers and read user reviews. You know, the site where they REALLY know mobile devices. The acknowledged experts in the field. Everyone LOVES this device. Absolutely rave reviews from real world users. Why the E-zines don't like this device I don't know. Perhaps Samsung is not spending enough marketing dollars? If you understand the industry, you'll understand that if you don't pay enough in advertising, you don't get good reviews.After a few days of owning the note, the things I really like about it are:  The touch screen. Very accurate and responsive input. It just plain works.  The screen. It's crisp, bright, clear and color accurate.  The speakers. Wow. Best speakers of any tablet or laptop I've ever had. Easily usable and pleasurable for watching movies and listening to music in hotel rooms. (I travel a lot.) Given a choice between watching a movie on my wife's Ipad3 or my Note, the Note 10.1 wins hand down due to the superior speakers and screen size.  The performance. Every app I use works smoothly, correctly and quickly. Everything just works.  The battery life. Almost 10 hours of netflix viewing or reading ebooks on a single charge.  Video. Every file I throw at it plays perfectly. Motion is smooth and clear.  The Pen. Really great to have. Initially, I thought I had no use for it. I was wrong. Photoshop touch is just great with the pen. Note taking is like pen and paper without the mess. Really a game changer. There is a learning curve though. You have to learn how to make best use of the pen and adjust the settings to your preferences before you start liking it. Don't expect to be wowed the first time you use it. Also, don't assume you can get a stylus and use it with other tablets to the same effect. The Note 10.1 has a built in Wacom digitizer in the screen. That's what makes it so accurate and responsive.  Bulid Quality. After the OTA update (22 August), the only issue I have with the Note 10.1--currently--is do I exchange it for the 32GB version.After a week with this device I will say it is the best mobile device I have ever owned, hands down.", "Title": "Galaxy Note 10.1", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Author": "T. Boehnlein", "ReviewID": "R2MQKFIRRBF2QI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet for one reason only: to take notes at work.  And with Quill, I have everything I need to take notes and organize all of my projects.  The Wacom S-Pen works beautifully.  Extremely accurate and fits nicely in my hand.  And having a place it put it on the tablet is very convenient.  Lots of professional reviews knocked this tablet, but I could not disagree with them more.  I love it.I'm glad Samsung didn't do a high resolution screen.  The end result would have been a heavier less responsive tablet because of all the extra pixels to push.  Despite what the reviewers say it is fast.  It is very responsive.  The benchmarks clearly show this tablet is a beast.  I do use 3rd party apps to replace parts of interface just like I do with my phone and any Android device I have ever owned.  I use Apex Launcher instead of the stock Touchwiz launcher.  I also use Swiftkey instead of the stock keyboard.As far as build quaility is concerned, the back does have flex.  I don't know why it matters.  But some people are going nuts over this.  If you are going to leave this tablet naked, maybe then worry about the flex of the case.  The sides seems very sturdy to me though.  But I always buy a case.  My very first tablet that I bought cost me $250 to repair it because I dropped it without a case and the LCD screen cracked. With a case, none of the flex matters.  At all.  I also think the grey looks way sharper than the white version.  And it's awesome having front facing speakers.  I wish all tablets were this way.  The screen is very bright.  I compared it outside on a sunny day with the Transformer Prime with IPS+ mode on (my co-worker owns one) and both of them were readable.  Neither one of us could say one was better than the other.  The colors also look beautiful.  My lock screen is a picture of Mami from Madoka Magica.  And the shades of yellow on her outfit and hair look stunning everytime I turn on the screen.  Samsung did a great job with the screen even if it isn't full HD.  The camera is so so.  It's good enough I can use it to take a picture and mark it up with the pen.  But I will always use my phone camera before my tablet camera for general picture taking.Again, this is the tablet you want to buy if you want to take hand written notes at work and diagram stuff.  If you want something now, this is honestly your only choice.  If you can wait until Windows 8 tablets drop at the end of October, you will have a whole bunch of different choices.  But not all W8 (or Windows RT) tablets will feature a Wacom stylus so make sure before buying anything.  If you just want to screw around with a tablet on the couch, you have plenty of choices at lots of different price options.  I would say go with the Nexus 7 or maybe one of the new Kindle Fire HD tablets.", "Title": "Ultimate Work Tablet", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Author": "David C. Veeneman", "ReviewID": "R2RMTM7TQAVTTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I love this tablet. But my needs are somewhat unique. If you want a tablet simply to consume media--browse the web, watch movies, show photographs, play games, and so on, you should probably consider either an iPad, Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1, or Google's Nexus 7 tablet. Other than the iPad, they are much less expensive than this tablet, and all do a good jod displaying media and games.I use my Galaxy Note 10.1 in three modes. First, I do use it as a media display device, and it does a great job at that. Web browsing, movies, games, and photos are all clear and stutter-free. The unit is quite responsive, with no sluggishness at all. I am very pleased with it in that regard.The second mode I use the tablet in is reading mode. I don't use it for e-books; my Kindle does a better job of that. I use it for technical articles and books, many of which are in PDF format. The s-pen is ideal for highlighting, underlining, and generally annotating the PDFs that I work with. I have wanted this capability for years, and I would have paid $500 for that alone.Finally, I use the Galaxy Note 10.1 as a peripheral device for my desktop computer. I have avoided buying a graphics tablet for years, because I couldn't get comfortable with drawing on a gray tablet and watching what I was doing on my computer screen. With the Galaxy Note 10.1, I can load a photo or other art work onto the tablet, work on it there, and send it back over to the computer with a single click. The tablet acts as a wireless graphics tablet for the computer, with the added benefit that I can see the progress of my work on the tablet itself. I am utterly amazed at how well it works.A really fun feature is the built-in IR blaster, which lets the tablet act as a remote control for a home entertainment system. Even though the software bundled with the system is in its early stages, it works flawlwssly, and it shows a lot of promise of really sophisticated media control coming down the line.Obviously, these capabilities won't appeal to everyone. If you can't think of an immediate good use for the s-pen, you might want to think twice before buying this tablet. There are other very good tablets out there. But personally, I think the Galaxy Note 10.1 points the way to the future of both PCs and tablets, where we all use multiple devices, working together, to accomplish what we want to do.", "Title": "Great tablet, particularly if you like the s-pen", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Author": "Eddster", "ReviewID": "R3EL2LAYOLF8E5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love, love LOVE this tablet!  It is blazing fast and buttery smooth (even with Samsung's Touch Wiz UI).  This baby features THE BEST multi-tasking that I've experienced on any tablet.  The screen is bright and beautiful.  Video absolutely pops on this.  I do have to admit that written text is sharper on my iPad's retina display screen, but this was by NO MEANS a deal breaker for me because this Note tab is so feature packed that it more than makes up for it and written text basically looks like it did again on my iPad 2, which is nothing to sneeze at.  The S-Pen is freakin awesome! Now I can do Draw Something some justice! LOL  But seriously, I love being able to create and send personalized notes and edit PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel documents.  I have barely been able to put this thing down since I got it.  The included Photoshop Touch application is really cool and you can do some really awesome things to pics.Also, the fact that I have Adobe Flash on this thing and can experience the entire web from this tablet is a MAJOR plus for me.  That was by far one of the most frustrating things about using my (old) iPad.  Well that and the closed nature of the iOS environment.  I love that I can play around and customize this Note tab to my liking.  The snappy 1.4 GHz Quad Core processor and 2 GB of RAM results in ZERO lag when using this tablet.  Everything is so incredibly fluid as I swtich between apps, widgets, and the web.  And web pages load in a snap!  It is REALLY REALLY nice.  This thing has already meant death to my 3rd Gen iPad and at this point I can already tell that I will now hardly ever use my PC.Oh and the fact that you can also use this as a universal remote is freakin sweet.  It took me all of 5 minutes to set up all of my devices (TV, Cable Box, A/V Surround System, etc) with Samsung's Peel app. That app gives you a very easy to follow set-up wizard and instantly turned this thing into an entertainment hub!I just can't say enough about this tablet.  I am so glad that it finally came out.  And as amazing as this thing is already, Sammy says we should get Jelly Bean very shortly! So an already great tablet will become even better! If you are considering taking the plunge with this thing, go ahead and do it!  I think you'll be happy.  It seems like the possibilities are almost endless with this device.  Did I mention that the S-Pen is crazy awesome?!?!?!!!", "Title": "Made me sell my 3rd Gen iPad...", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Author": "BW", "ReviewID": "R2VRGHGODKIJGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to wait until I'd had the Galaxy Note 10.1 a few months before reviewing it so I wouldn't be reviewing it while in the initial oh-wow-I'm-in-love stage, which I definitely went through.  I love techy gadgets, but I find I can't know how they'll work for me until I've had them a while, and some turn out to be an infatuation that fades as I find that I don't use the gadget as much as I'd thought I would. But I've had my GN 10.1 almost four months now, and I'm as much in love as ever and using it every day.The biggest draw for me was the S-pen.  I've been waiting for a tablet that I can write on like a pad of paper, and the GN has turned out to work very well that way for me (unlike other electronic devices I've tried over the years).  After a few weeks, I bought a larger (Samsung) stylus because I use the handwriting function constantly, and I wanted something that felt more like holding a regular pen.  The included stylus is just fine, though (once you find it--it's so well-designed, tucked into a corner, that it took me a while).  I've been very impressed with the handwriting recognition.  I imagine it will get better in future versions, but for now, this is more than good enough for me.  Before I bought the GN, while I was trying to determine how good the handwriting recognition would be, I found a good YouTube video that persuaded me to use the complete recognition option rather than the stroke recognition, and I *much* prefer complete recognition.  I sometimes do use the keyboard instead, and the prediction is pretty good.  I eventually bought a third-party app, 7notes with mazec, which I like even better for handwriting on the tablet and having the output be text in a word-processing app, a diary app, fields on web pages, etc.Besides the Samsung S Note app, the GN comes with an office suite that takes advantage of the S-pen and the ability to have more than one app open on the screen at the same time (which I was excited about when I was reading reviews before buying, but it turns out that I seldom use the split-screen feature), but there are other office suites, free and pay, in the App Store, and I found one I prefer for working on Word documents.  And there are plenty of other note-taking apps that use the S-pen, and lots of them are free.  It's worth trying them out and keeping the one(s) you like.  Not as many other apps yet that use the S-pen as I hoped for.  But it's still a small market--the Samsung Note tablets and Note smartphone.  I hope there will be more in time.I found the layout and controls of the GN 10.1 mostly intuitive, and by playing around with it, I figured most stuff out for myself.  The user manual is pretty lame (which is also true of the iPad).  But there's plenty of information on line, and as I do more with the tablet, I learn more about the functions.  I like the layout of the power button and volume control rocker more than the iPad's.  Sound through the speakers is good enough--I wouldn't expect better from a tablet.For those who complain about lack of Flash, there *IS* a way to install it.  It's free, it's safe, and it works fine.  Do a Web search or look through the comments on these reviews.  I also installed an extension for the Firefox browser for Android that fools websites into thinking that it's a non-mobile version of Firefox, and between the two of them, I haven't found sites where Flash doesn't work.Some reviewers have been unimpressed with the cameras.  I haven't really used the front-facing one (got to start Skyping one of these days, I just haven't got around to it).  I have used the rear-facing one, and I like the results a lot.  Maybe I'm just easily pleased, but I haven't seen what the results look like for an iPad, so I don't have a basis to find the Samsung's camera wanting.  I'm plenty satisfied with it, in any case, and I use it much more than I expected to.  Similarly, I've never seen the retina displays of the latest Apple products, so I'm not comparing the GN screen to that, and I don't find it the least bit disappointing.  For me, it would probably be worth the tradeoff anyway, just to be able to write on the screen with the S-pen.Google's app store has had almost all the apps I would like and plenty of choice.  A couple that are available for the iPad but not Android that I miss are the NPR app that includes their music streaming (there's an NPR app for Android, but it doesn't have First Listen, concerts, etc.) and iPeng for controlling my Squeezebox music player.  But there's a fairly good alternative for iPeng, and I'm still hoping for a better NPR app to be developed for Android.Besides the ability to handwrite on the screen, the other big selling point for me is that the Samsung tablets aren't boxed in the way Apple products are.  It's easy for me to network the tablet with my desktop and laptop computers, move things around among them, stream video and music from my desktop via an app, set up the storage on the Samsung the way I want it, and add, move, and delete things without having to go through something like iTunes.  I'm also looking forward to using a micro memory card to take a bunch of movies, books, and music when I travel, but I haven't come close to filling up the internal storage so far.The only thing about the GN 10.1 that I have any complaints about is the battery life.  It's probably reasonable for the size, power, and weight of the tablet.  It's just that I use the tablet so much that I could wish for a longer time before I have to recharge it.  That probably says more about my heavy use of the tablet than about the battery life.Oh, and the charging cable is ridiculously short.  I bought a second, somewhat longer one, which also serves a backup in case I forget the original someplace or lose it, but I'm planning to get an even longer one soon, for convenience.  I'm also planning to get an HDTV adapter so I can try streaming video from the GN to my TV via an HDMI cable.Okay, one more minor beef: It comes with some apps that I don't use and don't want but can't uninstall.  I can at least hide their icons, but I would prefer to get rid of them altogether without rooting the tablet (I would rather not root it and haven't yet--because it's more configurable than the iPad, I haven't felt the need).All in all, the Galaxy Note 10.1 has been a delight, and I'm finding new uses for it all the time.  It's so much more portable than my laptop, so I take it with me almost everywhere.  I write on it, read books on it, check the weather on it, keep up with the news on it, shop at Amazon on it, do a lot of other Web stuff on it, check my e-mail on it, play games on it, watch videos on it, listen to Internet radio stations on it, control my Squeezebox with it, keep a calendar on it, take pictures with it, keep a journal on it, sign PDF documents on it for work, print from it, use it as a portable scanner, keep lists on it, plan my writing projects on it, and one of these days I'm going to use some of the fitness and meditation apps I installed but never seem to find the time to use.  Ditto the sketching and drawing apps.  I'm not artistic, but it could be fun to play around with those.  There's just so much I can do with it and not enough time.", "Title": "Love it, use it every day - AND YES IT CAN HAVE FLASH", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Author": "Sanghoon Lee", "ReviewID": "R2FY5QIHDJWIBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My family has two iPads and three iPhones. I love Apple products, but became worried after the patent verdict that Apple might take over the technology world; a monopoly would not be good for consumers. That's how I got started with Androids.When I was buying this tablet, I was ready to be disappointed. However, I liked the idea of a tablet with a pen so decided to give it a try. After 10 days, I am more than satisfied. The S-pen works nicely. Things move fast and smooth, without a single crash. I like the photoshop that came default, the mini apps, long battery life, and the continuous typing keyboard.There were a few times I was glad that I had the Note with me. For example, when I browse a website and want to jot down something quickly, I can just open an S-memo mini app and write it down there. With iPad, I would have to look for a separate notepad and a pen. Or when I want to upload a picture to a website, the Photoshop is really nice. The S-pen makes Photoshop easier and more powerful.Of course, there are things the new iPad does better than Note 10.1. However, I think there are trade offs in these areas and Samsung made right decisions. First, Galaxy Note 10.1 has a lower resolution screen. It does not bother me at all when I just use Galaxy Note, but when I compare it with the new iPad side by side, there is a noticeable difference. However, if Galaxy Note had the high resolution, it could lead to other problems. It would not be as fast and battery would not last so long. I prefer speed and long battery over a high resolution screen. Second, Note 10.1 has a plastic body. It is true that Note 10.1 does not look as classy as iPads. However, its benefit is that the tablet becomes substantially lighter than iPad. This helps a lot when I read ebooks. Again, I prefer light weight over a metal body. Overall, I think Samsung made right decisions in these trade offs.If you have been an iPad user for long time, I suggest you give the Note a couple of days before you make your  decision. On the first day, I was a bit disappointed because it did not work in the way I was used to. But once I get used it, I came to like Android better than iOS. I think iOS does a great job simplifying its operations; even my three year old daughter can use it. However, for me, Android OS offers more functionality and efficiency.", "Title": "Samsung got it right this time.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Author": "C. Jones", "ReviewID": "R3SZW4BL963MJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been wanting an android based tablet (my wife has an ipad but it feels too limited for my use)to use for note taking for over a year now. I've tried a couple different tablets, acer a500/asus transformer and the capacative stylus just doesn't cut it. Heard about this at the beg. of the year and decided I'd get it, after a long delay which was to better the tablet, it came in yesterday. Though I know Windows Surface is supposed to be the end of Oct. and may be a game changer I've quite enjoyed my experience with android on mobile phones. Also, the app market being established and ease of sharing everything I have between devices is seamless.I will update this review in a couple weeks, this is just an initial glance.If you're familiar with a Honeycomb or ICS tablet then the Galaxy Note 10.1 should feel very familiar. Nothing new or exciting to write home about, TouchWiz adds a couple different bells and whistles (literally, the notification chime is a whistle which I actually like) but most of which I will not use. I'm used to stock android, Galaxy Nexus, so the extra fodder that TouchWiz provides doesn't do much for me. The 1st thing I did was delete all the pre-loaded widgets. I noticed that before I did this there was a slight delay scrolling, afterwards it seems fairly fluid. I currently only have my minimalist calendar and beautiful weathers widget loaded. I still feel that if it were vanilla ICS or Jelly Bean (eventually???) it would be lightning fast. But even still it is the most responsive android (and possibly apple) device that I've used to date.The build quality was a little better than I expected, yes its typical Samsung plastic but it feels decently and has a good weight to it. I really like the greyish color as opposed to black and though the back panel is plastic it has a brushed metal look. The screen is bright and clear, despite everyones complaints about screen resolution, and is at least readable in direct sunlight - though not ideal. The bezel is near about the perfect size for a \"writing\" tablet if held in either portrait or landscape and the speakers give it a distinct look along with being very functional since they are forward facing. The screen is a fingerprint magnet like any other touch device, so I'll be looking at a non invasive screen protector eventually. Overal I give the build quality a 7.5 out of 10. Oh, and for those of you that care - after pulling teeth chatting with Samsung online they finally said the screen is indeed Corning Gorilla Glass, but I couldn't find anything legit online to back that statement up.I've mainly been using the S Pen and am quite impressed. I think I'll finally have a writing solution instead of pen and paper. Nothing feels like ink to paper but this is pretty darned close. And being able to write small words, like I would on a pad, is great even though its hard to read my chicken scratch! But then again my penmanship is poor an paper....not much of a difference. The S Pen is the main selling point for this tablet and I think Samsung has a winner here. I give the S Pen a 9 out of 10I think things can only improve and have a feeling we'll see an update in a couple weeks; with the hopes of Jelly Bean by the end of the year - Samsung hasn't been good at keeping update promises though. I really think that if people can get away from \"screen resolution\" this is the tablet to buy regardless if you want the S Pen. Though TouchWiz isn't as intrusive as I've seen in the past I'd still like to root this device and have stock ICS or Jelly Bean - it would no doubt blaze past Apple and anything else Android currently on the market.I know this review was a little scattered and not detailed but I wanted to give a quick glimpse of what I thought, if you have any specific questions ask below and I'll check in periodically and answer them to the best of my knowledge.UPDATE: 2/20/2013OK - I've owned this tablet for about 6 months now, its time to give this review an update. I'll try to be as short and sweet as I can, but if anyone has any questions about something I left out please comment below or message me and I'll answer to the best of my ability.I've changed my review from a 4 star to a 5 star review, and until a tablet comes on the market that I feel is better than the Note 10.1 at around the same price point it will remain a 5 star review, especially now with the 4.1.2 update.This device is completely solid and functional. It is not like the vast majority of tablets that now flood the market and feel like an overgrown smartphone. The software is well implemented, multi-tasking is great, and the multi-view capability bring it very close to the feel of using a PC. I use it daily in the workplace and also at home, in which I now rarely even use my personal PC. The build quality is solid, I've dropped it several times and there isn't a scratch on it. (Though I do have a screen protector on it AND its in a cheap poetic case) But after using it this long and the abuse I give it daily, sometimes just throwing it in the passenger seat of my truck - I think the people who say the tablet is \"cheap\" feeling b/c of the plastic build do so unwarranted. If it were cheaply built I think mine would have already broken, the body or the internals.It doesn't really matter if you are an Android fanboy or an iSheep, the fact remains that this is the best sub $500 tablet out there to date. It has a true filing system, is fast, has true multi-tasking, great screen, great battery life, great software and a solid build. Throw in the S Pen capabilities to those that use it and it is light-years ahead of the competition. I truly believe that anyone who wants a tablet for anything more than a facebook/email machine would be unwise to choose something else.

Yay.I am a current owner of a Samsung Galaxy SII, and I loved the freedom that Samsung proliferates in their technology and build. I like it so much that i knew immediately when i began searching for a tablet it would be from Samsung. They make some great stuff. I didn't buy the tablet for gaming or even for school since i am currently disabled and have problems learning as well as physically going and coming from school etc. I bought it for legal matters in the hopes that a larger screen would make what i was displaying on it more accurate and applicable, but it seems that it will get more use from entertaining me from heart rendering boredom as i take a long trip to somewhere i don't particularly want to go. but anyways...now for my opinion on the product...:)If you are deciding between getting the IPAD or the Samsung note, let me help you out with your decision. GET the Samsung note. Why? you won't miss the IPAD, sure it has a better spec screen but trust me you won't miss it. The Samsung screen is bright and as beautiful as the dickens, trust me. It has this very soft and beautiful luminescence that makes you think \"now there's momma's baby\" when you turn it on. it is not annoyingly strikingly bright (sorry apple). Also i am not biased against apple since i have an IPOD Touch, but come' on apple your stuff is way too expensive to be so consumer limiting. Instead of calling their company apple they should have called it \"Yes, Dad.\" But yes... Buy the 16gb 10.1 note and just buy a 64gb SDHC card and save some money, I even wonder if this will take a 128gb SDHC card (it would be so awesome). knowing Samsung I'm sure it would.Gorilla Glass! Don't leave home without it! I had to walk around with the Note unprotected in my purse (yeah i know i know) where there were house keys and pencils and pennies jiggling free inside for a couple of days and every time i pulled the note out it barely had any dust on it never mind scratches, so i don't advise anyone to buy any screen protection (this coming from a girl who wrapped her computer in glade wrap for fear of cosmetic damages) so that says Alot. Also people say that it messes with the functioning of the stylus, you'll want some smooth swiping for the great applications and games. a screen protector is not needed. but i would and do have a Decal Sticker covering every other exposed part on the note and it now has a little store bought case as well. and yes Samsung built the note with a plastic case but it doesn't look like or feel particularly like plastic, but i like the plastic. it won't dent when it drops to the floor and it also probably wouldn't break either (not because of the plastic but because of Samsung's solid build).  Speaking of the Stylus, Super Super Awesome! has a cute little cubby hole, slide out and slide in. the stylus also does not feel awkward in my hands. great for some games but old habits die hard and since i don't use this for writing or reading or anything i'm often using my hands..also because my numb little fingers makes it hard to hold a grip on the stylus.  The camera is nice but i doubt people will be using this for the camera, Samsung was just being thoughtful, since most everyone has phones with souped up cameras. When I'm trying to take a picture i go for my Samsung SII instead of my Note. also the note is sorta large to say that you want to take a cute little pic with it. what else...  The apps are really nice, again the screen picture quality is really nice so don't worry about the intergalactic level graphics that apple boasts about for the IPAD. you don't need those level of graphics for something so small, it would just be ridiculous and overkill. great bang for your buck. also i must congratulate amazon on getting the product to ME (ME ME ME and nobody else) safely and timely because i have been disappointed over the years. also i advise you to take out warranty, if warranty is there, take it because this can very easily be a laptop replacement and running around the house with it under your arm will be...in short...a mistake.- typed over the expanse of 100 hours of speech to text software (kidding...but not really)- never really wrote a product review but this product desires some accolades...also i don't feel so scared to be home now :)Product Owned: HP Dv6 Touchscreen Laptop (custom made), Psp go (somewhere in the house...wait..no...i think it broke), Ps3 (collecting dust bought it in college tried to get another one for my undeserving brother but never got it.

The tablet is wonderful. I did not want an iPad simply because everyone else has one and I didn't want to tout around the same thing as every other person on the planet. This is my first tablet and I did a lot of research before buying here at Amazon. I would have purchased at Costco since it was the same price but Amazon was tax free..so sorry Costco. Anyway, I researched the iPad, the Galaxy 10 and MS Surface Pro. The Pro I felt was too expensive for a first generation product. Small things were overlooked such as providing a slot for the stylus; a big deal if it's lost. Plus reviews on the MS Pro's battery life worried me.With the iPad, I wasn't interested in following the heard. I wanted a sleek good looking device that can do everything the iPad can for less money and I have this in the Galaxy 10.1. Plus with Apple changing the charging/input equipment required for their latest tablet; that was the last straw on deciding not to buy. Having a proprietary charger for each new product release is stupid and I wasn't buying an Apple charger that's not compatible with my existing iPhone.There were maybe 2-3 minor apps that are not available for this table but again those apps (washington post and CNN) are minor and I have a laptop.

Before my husband bought me this, I spent an insurmountable number of research time on deciding which tablet I wanted.  Ironically, I was looking for a few tablets in the $200 range, but when I took my husband into Walmart, and showed him this tablet and explained to him what it did, his budget went up, and I got really happy then because I had been eyeing this tablet since last year,( but had been respectful of my husband's budget).So being that the budget had increased, I started doing research on all tablets, but this one kept coming into mind.  I was constantly on Amazon checking reviews, comparisons, and prices.  I realized that no other tablet could do what I needed and wanted the way this one could, and with the price tag.  Besides the S pen capabilites, the expandable memory with a micro sd card, was a selling point.  I considered everything - the pros and cons and realized that there were more pros than cons.  I knew that this would benefit me as a student, writer and occasional gamer.I have had this for a little over two weeks and am so happy with this product.  It goes everywhere with me .

Packing a Exynos quadcore 1.4GHz processor and a Mali-400 graphics chipset, this tablet has horsepower to spare. But power isn't everything. 2013 is here and the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 still outshines newer model android tablets. It's no longer the fastest, most graphically impressing tablet on the market. That would arguably go to the Nexus 10, also made by Samsung, which has a better DPI than even the iPad 4. Getting back to the topic on hand, this tablet screams productivity. The multitasking aspect coupled with the ability of the S Pen makes this a students' and business mans' dream. It has all the features that come standard with Android's with some special apps from Samsung. At launch, the Note had some problems with slow downs when running android ICS. After the Jellybean update, the Note better utilizes its hardware and software creating a very smooth experience. No inconsistent lag / twitchyness and more apps can be put onto the screen instead of just 2 by using cascade mode. I found myself opening 4 apps, filling every corner of the screen. One for note taking, another for emails, another for video, and 1 more for internet browsing and this time more apps are allowed for multitasking instead of just factory installed apps. The features this tablet has to offer is its strongest selling point. Until other tablets can multi-window / multitask like the Note can, I'd say this tablet will be a terrific buy for busy bodies.

Nielsen", "ReviewID": "R21UNJRXO3OYFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've wanted something like this tablet for years. I've had a variety of PDAs, laptops, smartphones, and tablets over the last decade+, but all have had the significant shortcoming of not having good and easy (or any) handwriting recognition integrated into the system. This replaces an Acer A200 Android tablet, which served me well even though it wasn't the fastest tablet; speed isn't important for me.The A200 was good at data consumption -- reading PDFs (the main reason for purchase), some light web browsing, reading email, a few apps, a few lightweight games to waste time, etc.; however, data creation was a slow and tedious process with the on-screen soft keyboard. Yes, I could have paired it with a USB or Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but that increases the weight and bulk in my daily carry bag considerably.This tablet with its S-Pen changes everything, although it won't quite replace a notebook for my needs. As of this initial review, I've had the Note 10.1 for a little over a week and have had adequate time to get familiar with it and start experimenting with new ways to use a tablet.  The handwriting capability allows me to use this in meetings to take notes in my chicken scratch handwriting and automatically convert it very well into type; I can then email the notes to my work computer. This is also likely to replace paper notebooks that I take to meetings for note taking, and give me the capability to electronically search for years-old notes on my desktop. I can now easily and precisely add notes and simple drawings to PDF manuals and books that I'm reading and anyone can read the text later on.For relaxation, this is a great media player. It has the loudest and clearest sound of any portable device, to include laptops, that I've heard. The videos I've played run smoothly thanks to the fast quad-core processor and plenty of RAM.So far, battery life has been great, lasting 2-3 days at least between charges.I've only played a little with the dual-apps on screen as the current ones are rather limited in number. I'm looking forward to the extra apps that appear to be coming with Jelly Bean.CONS: No standard USB port. I wish the S-Pen were maybe an inch or so longer. I hate glossy screens.I'll post updates as I become more familiar with the Note and start using more of the custom apps unique to it.Update, 3 Jan 2013:===================After a month with the Note, I like it even more. My Pros and Cons above still stand. It has been very stable, it has not needed a reboot/force off due to lockup. I've used the handwriting input to take notes a few times in meetings. I do experience problems with certain letters and characters such as 'i', '.', ',', and a few others, but nothing too bad that can't be cleaned up right then or later on. I'm still getting 2-4 days of use between charges, depending on how much I use it per day. I haven't really used the current S Apps other than learning the basics, the Premium Suite may have more useful apps and features for me to re-investigate; I'd love to see the ability to multi-window well-written apps such as GMail, Facebook, Chrome, etc., which I feel would be a huge benefit for me.I've picked up a few accessories that are working well with the Note:Samsung EPL-1PL0BEGXAR USB Connection Kit - allows me to plug in a USB thumb drivePowerGen Dual USB 3.1A 15w Travel Wall Charger with Swivel plug for Apple iPad 2, New iPad 3, iPhone 5 4s 4 3 3Gs, Amazon Kindle Fire HD DX KeyBoard, Samsung Galaxy Tab (USB Cable NOT included) - BLACK - a bit more portable for taking on trips, can use to simultaneously charge my cell phoneAduro Samsung Galaxy Tablet Extra Long USB Charge & Sync Data Cable (6.5 feet) USB to 30 Pin, Galaxy Tab 7-Inch, 8.9-Inch,10.1-Inch - use with charger above, like the extra lengthrooCASE Dual-Axis (Black) Leather Folio Case Cover with 23 Adjustable Portrait / Landscape Stand for Samsung GALAXY Note 10.1 N8000 N8010 (NOT Compatible with Galaxy Tab 2 10.1) - good protection, allows positioning horizontally or vertically, large range of angles, it is pretty thick, the tablet in its inner sleeve can be removed and held without the full case for extra convenience", "Title": "Awesome Tablet", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Author": "joseph", "ReviewID": "R3I19ZYQW3X02R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Apple look out... for those who love using a typical key pad, this is not the one for you, nevertheless... its ready to be your career and professional best friend.  the apps that come standard with the tablet are ready to take your business and life to the next level...", "Title": "Go Samsung", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Author": "tom webb", "ReviewID": "R1KPVCV9RNHH4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WHILE MANY TABLETS HAVE ENTERED THE MARKET OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS I DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE MADE ONE THAT WAS MORE THAN AN OVERPRICED TOY THAT I WOULD JUST SET ASIDE AND NEVER USE.

If you are looking for an android tablet but would not mind compromising on few things then go for it. As a device it is well worth the money. It is fast in processing, light in weight and excellent screen appearance. I would only list out few points here to help you in your buying decision.HDMI output - If you want to connect it to a TV / projector using HDMI port, please remember you would have to buy an expensive accessory. You can connect it through your home wireless network without much problem but it has few limitations depending on what you watch.OFFICE - Though it has a scaled down App for using \"word\" Excel\" PowerPoint\"  or PDF, it has limitations. Do not expect the same windows experience here ( After all it is android not windows).Browsing - If you did not know, android has lost flash support for your browsers on newer versions of their android OS. Which means, you can only watch Facebook videos or you tube videos ( or any such videos on other sites) only using their native apps but not directly on your web browser. So If you want to have a full experience of you tube ( app does not give you the same feel and look of a browser page, you might even miss few videos on app) you would not be able to do that on browser right out of the box. You would have to download flash from the archives and install it yourself. There is a step by step guide to do it, try Google for help. You can install flash on Firefox, stock android browser or bada browser but not on chrome.All in all; this tablet is not a replacement for your laptop or not even a high productivity tablet but If you need an entertainment device with a touch of productivity this would exceed your expectations.After using it for 3 months, I can say it has an unmatched battery backup If you know what you are doing. I have seen many of my friends complaining about battery backup problems on different device without realizing it is the user who is responsible for the low battery backup in most cases. Unlike apple ipad, android has the ability to run multiple apps. If you do not close the app you were using ( not hitting the return button) some apps would still be running consuming the battery. So use the task manager or another app to kill background apps.Hope that helps. Also, sorry if you see any spell errors or incorrect punctuation marks; I am not very good with smartphone touch screens.*****Sent from my Galaxy S4", "Title": "Decide what you need it for before you buy it", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Author": "jackalack", "ReviewID": "R2E1KFXRZYT825", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this tablet, couldn't be happier with this purchase!

I almost bought the Nexus 10 to get the native Android experience, but I couldn't commit to a tablet that didn't have an expansion slot.  I manage and store all my media on an SD card so I'm not tethered to the cloud.  Storage expansion is a \"must-have\" feature.  I was concerned about the standard resolution of the Note screen, but the screen looks great.  Because the screen is a standard resolution, there are fewer pixels to push around (compared to the Nexus 10) which makes for a super smooth user experience.  It never lags, stutters or hangs and I'm using it with a live wallpaper.  The other consideration is the number of Android tablet apps.  While there are a lot good tablet apps, most aren't written to take advantage of a high resolution screen like the Nexus.  And the screen is bright.  I lowered it to 40% and it's still very bright for indoor use.The Note is used mostly for media consumption, casual games, email and surfing...and I'm doing all this while \"watching\" TV.  The Peel IR remote feature is excellent and well implemented.  Since I'm multitasking, changing the channels is easy using the tablet.  I can search the guide, find a program, select the icon and the cable box responds and brings me my program.  Audio sounds great...for a tablet.  Having the speakers facing front is brilliant, if not common sense.I've only experimented with the S-pen a little bit and it works fine, even converting my poor handwriting to editable text, although I don't know how much I'll use it.  The S-pen would be great for business people or if you're an artist, I'm neither.  I purchased a slim leather case that fits perfect and provides basic protection for the tablet.Check out the Note.

I actually had a good old Nokia N800 4.3\" tablet I took notes with a few years back, but it was a resistive screen and clearly not the right format. I also had a netbook with a wacom bamboo, and a PC convertible tablet (heavy). These worked well on drawing, but clearly not for taking notes in the tiny seats we get at university. I then jumped to an android tablet, the ASUS transformer. I really liked it, the joys of Android are not lost on me, but notes was out of the question, even with a capacitive stylus. So I got excited to get the Note 10.1 I have traded all of my notebooks for S Note, and drawing is great with Sketchbook Pro for Android.There are even a few cool tools in SNote like formula match (I have gotten the most wows out of my fellow students with this one, write a formula, get it recognized, then click search to have wolfram plot a graphic and calculate its value),  a shape detector that makes circles, squares and lines for graphics, and handwriting recognition, but I haven't really used that, I prefer my own handwriting, really. If you study anything that forces you not only to write but also to draw schematics, graphics and the like, this is a great tool to have everything in a digital copy :).I also pull it out to play some games with my friends in the cafeteria, Spit! and Reversi are some of the favorites for killing time and work well in 2-player mode.PROSSPen Rocks, if you want to take notes by hand or drawing, its really comfortable.

So far it's been pretty reliable, I take my notes in class, upload it to Google Drive, and access the notes through any computer with internet access. The S-Pen is amazing, it not too hard to write with and my handwriting looks pretty much the same compared to my normal writing, although as expected it is a little worse. The battery life is pretty good, I am able to last a school day which is around 8 hours taking notes (I don't use the tablet the whole day). The apps are fine because it has Google Play, and I don't really play games on this so i wouldn't know if it lags. I will list some of my favorite pros and some of the things i do not like:Pros:- Can Open two apps at once. THIS is extremely useful for students who want to take notes and access the calculator or Internet, or even the everyday person who wants to multitask. I think the iPad doesn't do this so it is at a huge disadvantage.- Google Play Store-S-pen. I see other college students type their notes on the iPad, which to me looks time-consuming and it's harder to draw pictures or formulas or write something that would be difficult with a keyboard.-Lightweight. It's 10 inches but it is still easy to carry.-Ability to upload notes to Google Drive. I love this because Google is so convenient and I can access my notes and print it out through a school printer.Cons:-I wish I could write on pdf's or word documents. Maybe there is a way, but I didn't find out yet. SEE BELOW.-The screen froze on me once already. Hopefully it doesn't happen again but it's less than 4 months and it doesn't look good if that happens, especially when I need it during class.EDIT: I found that you can download PDF's and import them into S-Note, which is very useful because you can just write on the professor's PDF's, Word Docs or Powerpoints without making a seperate note. I really like that feature. Also another thing I did not mention is that when you write on the bottom of the screen, you are prone to touching the settings option by accident which happened to me numerous times. I'm not sure how to fix it but it get's annoying.", "Title": "Pretty good for a taking notes", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Author": "mary grace camat", "ReviewID": "R3VDV5OY0ESQ50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great buy for its price!

The price is just right and I am not spending $2000 for a tablet that I cannot take with me. What sold me is the technology used for the S-pen which is provided by WACCOM who are leaders in the industry of tablets used for art. Other than the fact that it is a quad core and has a great operating system Android this tablet screams beyond the capability of the Ipad. Don't be fooled by people who say that the resolution of the display is under par with other devices. I have had no issues with watching video content to even notice any flaws. The front facing speakers is also an awesome feature and makes movie watching even more enjoyable.My biggest complaint is issues with connectivity with WIFI, from what I've read that this is an issue that Samsung has not yet resolved with any updates. That is why I only gave it 4 stars. From what I have read from forums is that when the tablet is connected to WIFI it will lose connectivity on and off which is really annoying when trying to watched streamed content (Youtube for an example). Forums state the only way to fix the issue is by replacing he tablet with a newer one. I don't see this as good option and hope the Samsung will have an update to fix the issue. Mind you my comment about video playback is different from streaming video content.As far as gaming on the tablet seems awkward even with the controls on screen. I am currently researching a way to connect an Xbox360 wireless controller to the tablet to make game play more comfortable and more enjoyable. DO NOT PURCHASE a cheep OTG adapter from Amazon due to you get what you pay for.

It is a fine device for an entertainment platform as far as I can tell, just not a serious business productivity tool.Primarily I had high hopes to use it to take detailed notes and jot down sketches for productivity reasons. Hence the interest in the S-Pen.Secondary to my use was to do research on the web and to pick up/send  e-mail. Particularly with work related photos and drawings...not family vacation pictures.Tertiary to my use was stuff like calendar and alarm clocks. I can already do that on my phone.With regards to my intended use of this device stuff like watching movies, playing games, playing music, tweeting or facebook, or GPS tracking of my location for marketing suggestions is useless to me and of less than zero interest.If my use parameters aren't aligned with yours you won't like my review. So be it. Save your time and energy and don't bother to \"flame\" me. If what I listed above sounds more or less like what you are hoping for, then this review is for you.The S-Pen is the heart of why I had high hopes for this device, so let me start there, and also with the included memo/pen app \"S Notes\"The S-pen is a big step in the direction I had hoped for, but it is still in the toy stage. When evaluating the amount of whiz-bang it is a lot of \"whiz,\" and not much \"bang.\" Dozens of colors; different special tips; you can set the width of the lines etc... All \"whiz.\" That is whiz a-la MS Paint from the  \"Win95\"  era with not quite as many options. Try to write or draw anything precise with it? No good.  No \"bang.\" It isn't precise enough and it doesn't do the job well enough. It's touted \"special functions\" either don't work or are balky. Writing/sketching with it is like trying to take a note on a cocktail napkin with a broken crayon. Even in its finest setting it just isn't precise enough to mimic a real pen (or pencil) and paper. In a space where I would be able to easily write 7 or 8 perfectly legible words in my long-practiced block-capital draftsman-style writing I have to settle for two or three words at best on this device, and those are crayon-like and hardly legible. Switching to the handwriting-to-text mode improves things, but is too slow to transmute your jottings into typed form so it is more distracting than helpful. Also as soon as it converts a couple of words you must move your input writing down a line so as to not overwrite the typed text, and guess what? The new typed text comes out on the lower line. That is to be expected I suppose, but this whole system needs some refinement. [EDIT: access to the handwriting-to-text as well as voice-to-text and a few other \"productivity\" special functions is not possible in all memo formats. You must use their pre-made templates in order to get these features. You can not add them to your own memo by any means I have been able to discover. Which means Samsung might as well have skipped including them in the software. What is the point of a feature you can't access it?] You can switch to the keyboard and type, but I find touch screen keyboards lacking in sufficient tactile feedback to make my input reliable. Typing out a note with my thumbs on a Blackberry gets much better results. there is a speach-to-text function which for me works pretty well except that it isn't always convenient to be talking to your device.  \"This presenter is selling a bunch of nonsense. His reference data is the \"University-Hospital Study\" which was refuted at least 5 years ago. Check your files for that and bring it to staff meeting when we review this proposal\" isn't the sort of thing you want to be blurting out in the middle of a sales presentation.Navigating the menus on the included S-Note memo-taking app is confusing to say the least. I am learning it slowly, but it is far from simple or intuitive. Many icons don't do what you might suspect they would. like touching the \"+\" icon doesn't add a new empty page to write on. It saves the old page. And a lot of functions that should be possible with one simple poke or click or swipe can't be accomplished without first pulling down and changing to the appropriate menu. An example is if you are zoomed in on the page so as to make the handwriting or skethches more precise when returned to normal size, you can't write a few words and then easily scroll to the next part of the zoomed-in page to continue sketching or writing. You have to pull down a menu, change to scroll mode, scroll over, change back to writing mode, dismiss the menu if it is in the way (which it always seems to be) and then continue to write. Doing this every three or four words is very distracting. As far as those menu's being in the way? Some of them are constantly covering parts of the memo page and so those parts of the page cannot ever be accessed to edit or read.It is impractical to do any sort of meaningful dimensioned sketch. It is impractical to try to create a memo more than about a dozen words total. If you were hoping to take detailed notes at a meeting, forget it. If you had hoped to send a working sketch to a draftsman or a shop...forget it. Anything much more detailed than \"Don't forget milk on the way home Friday\" is just too much to get onto one screen without scrolling antics, which are just annoying.The problem is partially the app software, but it is also partially the hardware and the OS. First the Android OS withthe Samsung UI is just plain odd. Not difficult, but just odd. Why do I find my files listed under apps? Why can't I easily shut unused apps off? Why can't I minimize stuff or bring background apps to the foreground easily?.... since they are still running in the background anyway.... unless you went to pains to shut them off...  Yes, you can do this stuff, but it is just odd how you have to go about doing it.  The hardware doesn't have the necessary pen resolution yet. The special features of the pen need to be extended and debugged so you can easily do stuff like scroll around the page without pulling down menus. Being able to pick a bunch of colors and pen types as if you were in MS-Paint might impress a 14 year old girl drawing puppies and coloring flowers but doesn't thrill me. I would have preferred a better, more precise interface. One feature missing that was previously there was the ability to turn the pen over and use the other end as an eraser. This is now gone. Too bad. It made such perfectly intuitve sense.To be fair to Samsung though. No one else seems to be doing any of this any better. So my money is on Samsung to eventually get it really right before anyone else does. They just haven't gotten it there yet. They need to focus on making it a tool, not a toy.The included web browser seems to work OK, not exceptionally well in any regard... but it doesn't make it easy to delete your history or clear your cache, and worst of all, it tries to keep your form data and your passwords in memory. If you have a phone or tablet it is inheirently subject to physical misplacement or loss since you have it with you as you go about your day. So passwords shouldn't be retained on these devices lest someone picks it up and finds their way to all of your sensitive or important data. Kids don't have a lot of overly sensitive data, but business people and adults do. Some people will disagree with that satement, and that is their perrogative, but I'd prefer to be able to set my browser so that it never saves this sort of stuff in the first place. Instead I have to jump through a couple of menu hoops to either get so it won't save the data, or to delete the data after the fact. Why can't I just set that in a preferences menu and have that setting retained?The unit came packed with a metric ton of bloatware to do stuff like download movies and videos, music, interact with social media, etc... etc. All stuff being more or less push-marketed at you by Samsung and Google and usually for a fee or at least to put your eyeballs onto their marketing..... Or to track your location and on-line habits. All this sort of stuff might be of great amusement and delight to a 14 year old kid or a gadget freak, but I find it useless and just in my way. It clogs up my RAM and slows down the device, and it just uses battery life..... and frankly I don't need Google or anyone else tracking my location, spying at my on-line habits, or pushing movie content at me. Unfortunately this sort of software seems to come packed on any and all devices you get these days. Normally I just delete or ignore it. But to delete and disable a lot of this stuff on this device requires \"rooting\" (similar to jailbreaking an iPhone) which I understand voids the warrantee. I'm going to try to live with it and work around it for a couple of more days, but I am already at the stage that I am figuring out how to root the thing and get this stuff out of my way. The device is useless anyway as a business tool unless I can somehow improve its productivity. If I brick it trying to make it useful that is not real a loss. It is already only slightly better than a brick as it is.There is scant little help in learning their UI. For the new user the only way to learn is poke and hope. A few on-line tutorials that really showed you their methods menus and tools would help. They claim to have these things but what they amount to are just ads and marketing gimmicks and they are not truly useful. The stuff they show you is the easy cool stuff. Lots of colors and photos and such. The stuff they don't show you is the useful mundane real stuff. Like how to move the cursor to a particular point in the text to edit a single character. Or how to start a new memo on  a new clean sheet with a new title. If better tutorials exist I can't find them. Therefore the learning curve for a new user results in several days of lost productivity. A serious consideration for any business. I happen to have a determined (some say stubborn) streak, but frankly if it was my employee taking up much time as I have learing this thing I'd take it away from him. Permanently. The device fails miserably as a productivity enhancer, but it is a really REALLY big distraction.This device is part of a new culture in computing and smart phones wherein no one turns off anything or erases any old data. Once again to me this reflects a kind of 14 year old's perspective of not realizing that failing to clean up after ones self, especially digitally, has consequences.... When I am done with an app I want to shut it off, not leave it running and taking up memory in the background. That takes a number of strokes to accomplish on this device. The philosophy of this OS is to leave everything you have previously opened up running and taking up memory. You can't shut an app off directly from its own screen. Instead you can go to the \"Home\" screen and navigate to another app from there, or use the back button. The OS is supposed to decide which apps to terminate when it determines that you need more memory. In the meantime they are gumming up your RAM and probably using up your battery..... and some no doubt are logging data about where you are and what you are doing. Also some have higher priority than others, so you don't decide what you want to leave running, Andriod does. And if Android wants to track you via GPS then that is what Android does. So instead you have to take control yourself by navigating to the task manager every time you want to shut stuff off and clean out your memory. Furthermore regarding notes and e-mail and memos; in business some of that stuff is sensitive and you wouldn't want it falling into the wrong hands. Stuff like cost estimates and profit and loss estimates and even HR stuff. Things no one needs to stumble upon once you are done with them. Try cleaning out that stuff on this device! Agian, it is possible, it just is not easy and straight forward. To be fair these complaints are just as applicable to iPad and iPhone too.... but I look forward to a day when device makers figure out that real adult people with real serious purposes would like serious digital tools for their serious workplace. A real memo and note taking sketch pad and an communicating and e-mailing machine, with decent security for your privacy. Not a crayon-pad coloring-book movie and music player.Call me old fashioned, but I date back to an era where the 64K of RAM on my Apple II+ was a precious resource; and when battery power was to be managed carefully; and when personal privacy was a responsibility taken seriously.

I REALLY wanted to love the Galaxy Note but, despite the clear advantage of having an intuitive OS, external storage and more horsepower under the hood, I found the Note to be sluggish and inconsistent especially when watching different video formats not yet abandoned by Android, i.e. non-flash, etc.  I benchmarked a new iPad3 alongside the Note and there really was no comparison in terms of speed, clarity and touch responsiveness which are my primary requirements when using a tablet..  For me, the amenities built into the Galaxy are short-lived when your video screen cannot be maximized or when repeated pausing causes the video to stop altogether.  I tried several browsers  that allowed User Agent changes including the ICS +, Chrome and Dolphin and the result was mostly the same and you lose the split-screen function when not using the stock browser.  The S-Pen?  Well, it's a neat feature but when you can't make handwritten notes on the calendar and instead have to type out your appointments, what's the use?  Note taking is a nice feature but it's not very intuitive as you must be in the note app to read everything...why no incorporation into saved pages or Polaris office?  On the upside (and there are several), I liked the form-factor and front, stereo speakers are a big plus although the sound is mostly upper-mids and highs.  The file system is great and I actually prefer an open-ended app environment that is not vetted to death like Apple has.  However, for me, all of that became irrelevant when the core functions proved unreliable.  No Apple fanboy here...I own Samsung products and really wanted this to work for me.  That said, of all the non-Apple tablets I test-drove, the Note 10.1 was clearly the winner of the contenders and I spent a fair amount of time researching and hoping the Galaxy Note would remedy the same issues I encountered with the original Tab 10.1.
