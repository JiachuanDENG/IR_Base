I have a commerical Wifi setup in my house that delivers 54m very well. My other Wifi devices all have full scale signal except for the 7\" plus. There was an update pushed out this week that I hoped would make it better but it actually dropped a bar after installation. It does not drop out as much now but still the signal is 30% weaker than anything I have. Have a 3 year old Dell Streak & that outperformas the 7\" plus but the battery is 2 hours so no help...I have seen the 7.7\" Tab and it's a beast, my friend paid $600+ to get it from England... There was no issue will the Wifi at all at my house and the screen is the best ....Conclusion: The 7\" plus is a great unit if the wifi works correctly for you. If yours is like mine return it defective and hope that the 7.7\"comes out soon........Come on Amazon get us the updated Tab, the Note is already starting to appear and the 7.7\" came out a month before that in New Zealand..", "Title": "Great size but Wifi too buggy for me!!!", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Author": "Jay Bug", "ReviewID": "R275UNV1K9G9SO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This won't be a long review, just meat and potatoes.  I've got an iPad, iPad 2 and this tablet.  This is by far my favorite of the three, simply because it's far more portable than the first two. Don't get me wrong, I love Apple products but being able to put this tablet into my cargo pocket is awesome.  My only complaint, and one I'm sure will be fixed by updates in software is that from time to time the tab shuts off when I've put it into sleep mode.  It's only happened a couple times.  The quick fix is to hold the power button down until the tablet comes back up.  BE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE!!!

I'm using it with the Verbatim folding bluetooth keyboard as a word processing setup, and it works really well.

My first thought was to purchase an I-Pad as I have owned and still do own two I Pods. Yet, when I did some research, I discovered the I-Pad was lacking in some items which are important to me... 1) Size, (yes, I KNOW size isn't everything!) at  7.4 inches it fits perfectly in my hands, a 10 inch tablet would have been just too much like a net book, for my taste. 2) Portability, I can slip this in to my purse or a pocket, additionally the android system is very user friendly and has really, really nice functionality. 3) The View, (no, not the TV show, \"Hi Whoopi\") The screen is sharp, the colors vivid, I can adjust the brightness to my liking, day or night (it is sometimes a tad too bright at night, even on low, but a scarf, gives what I need) 4) Flash, Apple does not support the Adobe Flash player. The player is needed for a number of application and to not have that available on the go is for me a deal breaker in a portable unit. Of course I have \"worked around\" that problem with my pods, but if I'm going to pay almost $400.00 for a \"mini computer\" I WANT my Flash player!But I digress, I have found what I want in this tablet, I wish the 32GB had been available (and in my price range) but I can add 16GB to my current 16GB Galaxy and have 32GB so I'll deal.The ONLY down side, for me, is the location of the on/off button. I have more than once, unwittingly turned the power off. :-o, It should have been placed on the front of the unit, instead of the side. I'm sure as I become more familiar with my Galaxy and perhaps purchase a cover, this annoyance will cease to exist. I've had no problems with it losing power/charge too quickly, I DO know that in general android systems use LOTS of powerIn conclusion I give the Samsung Galaxy Tab Plus 4.85 stars ; deduction due to the location of the power switch.", "Title": "I'm in the Exosphere!", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Author": "Jim Mueller", "ReviewID": "R25F0KGA4SM4H4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the first Galaxy Tab 7\" from Amazon the week it came out, and liked it so much I did the same with this second generation.Overall the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus has been a great device.  The operating system (Honeycomb 3.2) is a great upgrade from Froyo and Gingerbread that I experienced on the original Tab.  Apps are nice, and the Samsung proprietary layers work well on the device.One down side is the Peel component of the device.  Either the Infrared port is weak or the Peel app is not functioning properly.  More often than not, even after extensive time in customizing the setup, the wrong signals are sent to my entertainment system.  This is especially frustrating since I also have a Samsung plasma TV and Samsung blue ray player.  Both products are models less than a year old, so they should work seamlessly, one would think.Otherwise, I use the device for email (Gmail and Exchange), browsing, and many apps including fun games, widgets, and productivity-based apps.  Most work great, and those that do not appear not to be the fault of the Tab.  For work, leisure, and portability, this is a great tablet!I am looking forward to purchasing the custom Samsung keyboard dock for this unit when it becomes available (still listed as \"back ordered\" on the Samsung site and not available at Amazon yet).  I bought the original Tab OEM keyboard and it absolutely changed how I used the device.  The fully customized keyboard from Samsung turns the tablet into a productivity machine!  I will highly recommend that product, as well.  Even at $90 MSRP it is worth it.Speaking of cost, I value the use of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus.  The price, though, is a little high compared to other tablets like the Kindle Fire.  I paid $400, and it was tough to do so especially after having just bought the original Tab last year.  What can I say, though...I love gadgets!Samsung has treated me well, even through a couple of technical- and service-oriented issues.  Great company, and so far pretty good products.

I wish I would have done a little more shopping around because you can find the new version of this device on Amazon for the same price, but that's my own fault.  there are a few things I can mention that bug me , for instance,  at the buttom of the screen there is a menu bar that brings up the task manager , home screen, and for some reason a screen capture button.  what sucks about it being at the bottom of the screen is that when gaming, it is too easy to accidently hit one of these buttons which will back you out of the game, or take a freakin picture and then open up the photo edit app (so annoying)...  but all in all it is a great device.  it has a longer wifi range than the IPAD and with the SD expansion port, you can add as much memory as you can find on the market.

I was an early adopter of the original Galaxy Tab, and it quickly became a part of my every day life. When I left it on top of my car and drove off a few weeks ago, I was almost happy, because I had seen the 7.0 Plus and planned to upgrade at the end of my T-Mobile contract this year anyway. Since my local T-Mobile store asked a lot for the device and had none in stock, I decided to continue my contract on a MiFi and get the WiFi version from Amazon. Since the Tab shares WiFi (a feature I often used in airports), I'm not sure I made the right move in retrospect, but I'm happy enough. The Plus is a big improvement over the original Tab. Android 2.3 with Samsung's improvements was a good tablet OS, but the browser was a little laggy, and audio playback was sometimes sluggish when multitasking. The Plus has few of these problems, and the new OS is an improvement.After deciding on the MiFi approach, I briefly considered the Kindle Fire, but I'm glad I stuck with the Tab. The Fire is a great product for the price, but browsing on the Plus is superior, and the Fire has no GPS.

I've done some serious research before I bought this. And as many of you heard, bigger doesn't always mean better. I originally was going to get the Transformer Prime but then I started thinking about \"real\" portability. Those 10+ inch tabs really are big. I started thinking about taking it out in the train or on the bus and I realized that I really don't want the attention of others.This 7.0 plus is \"real\" portability PLUS power. I can carry it in my pocket or my small book bag and it's near seamless. The other two selling points for me were the expandable memory and Bluetooth. I can't be without my Bluetooth JBird headset. And what a duo they make together. Everything about this tablet is perfect. The resolution is great for a 7 inch screen. The touch accuracy is dead on and the auto rotation is extremely fluid.Oh, and I must add that I love the video bookmark feature. Pretty sweet to have for when you're not to sure where you left off at in a movie.

(get a class 6 micro SD card)Noticeably faster than the 10.1 with the Samsung 1.2G dual processor rather than the 1.0 Tegra.GPS (using NAVFREE USA from the Marketplace) works like a charm without a data connection.Set up like a phone with an earpiece and mic for occasional Skype calls.Battery life decent if you turn off wifi when not online and the auto synch apps and only enable those periodically. Put it to sleep with the power switch and it will sit all day with no noticeable battery drain. Charges in a few hours. (Still wish it had the larger battery used in the 7.7.)Vivid screen- no bad pixels.Sound is impressive for a tiny device- much better than my Asus eee Netbook.I repeat- FAST. Boots fast too without a hitch.Strong wifi, but see below.Samsung 1-800 support very good if you get a good line- you get techs in S. Carolina who are very courteous and run off to get you an answer if they do not know- no bluffing.NEUTRALKnow beforehand that this tablet is optimized for use in portrait mode like a cell phone, although it does auto rotate to landscape (essential for Angry Birds). That is the price I was willing to pay for a manageable jacket-pocket/ glove-compartment size. So using it in landscape presents a few problems- the stereo speakers are both on your right (where the logo is) and your fingers obstruct the ambient light sensor near the earpiece causing the screen brightness to jump up and down. So use external speakers or headphones and turn off auto-brightness. I loaded an app called Display Brightness 2.4 that puts a transparent slider bar on any screen edge so you can adjust the screen manually without opening the settings menu. Not listed as CONS because the device IS optimized for portrait mode- it is what it is. The \"Pulse\" web aggregator used in text mode (rather than web mode, selectable at the top) is splendid in portrait mode- it gives you book-like text on white with pictures and no side bars, no banners, and no ads. You can customize it with so many feeds that it alone is worth the price of the device. You might even stop using a browser.CONSThese took a long time to figure out, but once you know, they are not real Cons anymore:* If you put your music library on the removeable SD card and plug it in, don't expect the music player to find them without a little work. It seems that Samsung used the same coding in this device as it did in the 10.1 (according to Samsung support) and since the 10.1 does not have an external SD card, the software isn't looking for one. With a file browser you can insert a \"jump point\" on the internal SD card going to the external SD card, and it is not hard to do. I wrote a forum post on how to do it at:[...]* The wifi is strong, connects instantly, and is as fast as my hard wired system. But after a week or so, you will lose your connection and be unable to connect again to the same (your home) network. This is because that routers are DHCP- they only lease your device an IP address that they change later. But the Galaxy tabs take note of the initial IP address and the MAC address (the serial number) of the router that issued it and remember it. When your router gives you a new IP address later, the tablet ignores it and uses the one it logged in. The explanation is long and tedious,and it is unclear whether the problem is more from Android than Samsung since the web is full of people looking for solutions with other tablets as well. But the solution when you get locked out is to delete the old connection info in the tab and give it a new STATIC IP address. Samsung's website tells you how to do it and the phone support people do as well. It seems from my testing that the Static IP is only static on your own network. You can still go to a public place and log on to their network with DHCP, at least until it boots you off as well. If it does, there will probably be an update by then or another workaround. I don't think you can escape this by buying another brand, so if you want a tablet, you have to live with it and grow as Android grows.ONE REAL CONI think the internal compass on mine is 4 or 5 degrees off, even after factoring the declination offset. Since the GPS does not use this to fix your position (it is little more than a gimmick) and when I consider the hundreds of things that could be defective on a replacement unit, I am not sending it back for that.", "Title": "Almost 5 stars", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Author": "elytron", "ReviewID": "RFJSOS15MX74S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the 32GB version of this tablet.

I had some doubts at first but for casual use the 7 is fine for what I do. Secondly, keep in mind that not all Android apps will run on a tablet and this one is no exception.  Radio.com does not work well at all and tv.com is in the same boat.  Unless the app is specific to tablets you could have problems.  I had a little trouble with Weatherbug but it is usable.  All of the above apps run fine on my HTC Android smart phone.  Thirdly,if you are listening to music or listening to audio on a web page and navigate away from that screen to another screen the audio will stop.  Otherwise apps like iHeart radio and Tunein radio work well.  The tablet is very fast.  I think faster than the Tegra2 tablets.  The screen is more than bright enough so don't believe what you read in other reviews.  I wish it used a micro usb for charging.  The proprietary charger connector looks suspiciously like that used for ipads. I checked and they look identical but the pin outs are different.

Oh yes, Skype works well with the built in mic and speakers but not well with head phones either bluetooth or the ones supplied with the tablet.

My needs were a product that could handle all of my media play, portability, little to no restriction in terms of browsing, video chat through both gchat and Skype and document editing through office and adobe. I had the kindle app on my Xoom and downloaded it on the tab, it works fine at accessing my books, although there is a page turning glitch which I noticed someone else mention where if you tap the margin on the tab, it advances two pages in stead of one. That's annoying, but the slide page turn works as normal. Now the Tab is small, so of you have big old fingers you might want to think about a ten inch (my dad prefers the size of his Xoom to my Tab). In terms of document editing, polaris office is very good. Input methods indigenous to the Tab include Swype which is what won Samsung a guinness record for fastest text message sent I think. I can see why - Swype is very very fast, although, if you notice a really interesting spluttering or grammar mistake, or just a comical use of a particular word, it's probably because I'm using Swype right now. It puts the website \"damn you autocorrect!\" Into perspective. You should definitely check your completed compositions before you send. Another little glitchy thing is that I actually had to delete one of my email accounts from the Tab email client because it was just not a reliable feed of those emails. This is an email account from a university, managed by Google so I don't know of there's any significance to that, but accessing gmail works fine on my Tab, so I just use that. The picture quality on video is good, although it isn't very loud, I find myself having to wear head phones even when alone in my bedroom. Skype works as well as Gchat for video which I'm happy about, because Xoom didn't.

The only thing I can say is that the screen resolution (1024x600) is not da same as the iPad 2 (1024x768) but its to me its decent enough especially for the price. The universal remote feature is awesome,I've completely ditched my cable remote and used this instead.  Overall I'm very happy with the Galaxy Tab, it satisfied all of my tablet needs and I would recommend this device to anyone who's looking for a decent low priced android tablet.  The hardware is sufficient enough to run Android Honeycomb 3.2 (OS it shipped with)and from what I read it should be getting the ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich)update. If you're undecided then take a trip to your local electronic shop and play around with the display model and if you're planning to buy it then shop for it here because Amazon has the best prices I've seen so far.", "Title": "Very Pleased ...", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Author": "DNG", "ReviewID": "R37A153UEHJIX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first review ever in amazon.I own this around two weeks and I definitely love it.

I was between this and an Acer that was $100 cheaper. I figured you get what you pay for. The other tablet hah HDMI out, but they were sold out of them, and this was an impulse buy. This Tablet has expandable memory and you can buy the cable to hook up to HDMI. Also when you plug USB into your computer, it recognizes it immediately for transfering files onto the microSd in the tablet or into the tablets memory.Pros:-Customizable-Very Good Speed, ie Browser and Opening Apps-Amazing Picture Quality by Samsung as usual.-Comes with a program similar to office already preloaded for documents, spreadsheets, etc.-Unlike Apple, when you transfer files, you rarely have to convert them to other formats. I have AVI files that go right onto the tablet and I can play through a downloaded app from Android market. It has all necessary codecs.-Using DoubleTwist you can set your tablet up with an Itunes similar program.-Slightly smaller than Ipad so easier to carry around.Cons:-There are a lot less apps on here than on an Apple. ie. Scrabble with Friends.-Using Optimum app on Android, you cannot watch live TV, where as I can watch TV on my iphone with the same app.-Peel app is pretty bad. I got it to hook up to my TV, but the IR capabilities aren't easy to work with. It makes a poor universal remote. If they did not put so much other stuff into the app and made it solely a remote it probably would have worked better. You shouldn't buy a tablet if you want a universal remote though. I thought I could tweak it being an engineer, fix it a little, but its a pretty poor app. Only one really.Basically, I love this tablet.

There is a limit to what a smart phone can do.First of all, the Honeycomb tablet OS with Touch Wizard interface operates without snags. Battery life is very good and almost excellent. The tablet is fast and the display is excellent.  Audio through is terrific--I use Power Amp as my media player and classical music sounds wonderful. I am not sure what DAC chip Samsung used in this tablet but it sounds like a top notch audio DAC.This is a light tablet. Construction is solid. No problems wkth setup. The USB charging cable is short as I had read, just a little bit annoying.

I have trigger fingers in both hands and shoulder adhesions so I notice weight.

I believe only inherent flaws should lower the rating of a device, or misleading advertising, not personal preferences that are known before purchasing the device.  With that in mind:These tablets are amazing, especially the 5-7 inch ones.  These are a game changer, more so than the 10-inch devices, because of their extreme portability, or, more specifically, their holdability or pocketability.  These are so much easier to use than a desktop computer with all the delays in starting up, etc., and being confined to a chair in a sitting position.  One big difference between the 5 and 7 inch tablets is, more is displayed \"at a glance\" on the 7-inch device, it's more visually rich and exciting, so the inclination is to buy the 7-inch device (like the Galaxy Player 7 Plus), it is holdable and a good impression is made in the store.  BUT - it's weight becomes a problem for extended periods of reading.  Holdability is an important property for these small tablets, and I discovered I could hold the 5-inch Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 (5-inch) device endlessly, whether standing, sitting, or lying down.  One needs to be able to hold the device in 1 hand while gesturing with the other, rather than cradle the device with both hands, which you almost have to do with the 7-inch device.What's surprising is how a 5-inch display can deliver so much!  I wouldn't have expected it, and the 5-inch model fits in a shirt pocket!  It's both holdable and pocketable.  It displays full web pages (in landscape), and text is very easily resized by pinching then tapping for almost all web sites (and most text based apps).  The 5-inch Galaxy Player also has a micro SD slot (max 32GB) but not the 4-inch. I could go on, but the point is, the Galaxy series delivers 100%.  The 5-inch model is simply more holdable, in my opinion, than the 7-inch Galaxy Player 7 Plus, but that's a preference that doesn't diminish the 5-stars of the 7-inch \"Plus\" model.", "Title": "Great device - but that doesn't mean it's for everyone.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Author": "Bigdog", "ReviewID": "R15ZUNRE70ESNN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The previous owner changed the platform so nothing wants to run correctly.
