If you're looking for a iPad replacement.. $99 is not going to get you one. If you want a speedy pad with a great display that you don't have to guard with your life, if its lost or broken - this is a great one. We just bought a 2nd one today. Just remember, it's $99. Amazing.", "Title": "More than I expected for the price.

Just wish the following things were better.1.  Resolution - 800x600 is OK but needs to be improved to display much brighter and sharper pictures2.
