{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Mar Chuan \"MC\"", "ReviewID": "R2B4YOSB2EUCLG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this as a birthday gift.  I pay attention to tech sites but only had general knowledge of this device.  I have to say I am loving it.  I have the LTE version (SPG351) which I think is also the international version.  I updated to 4.3 via wifi with no problem.Features I like:WATERPROOFI took it into the shower and it proved that it really is water proof.  I tried to use it while water was running on it and it seems to have difficulty registering swipes.  However I'm not sure if this is an issue if the tablet is fully submerged.FLASHTo make it even more versatile, I was able to install Flash.  I use Dolphin browser to ensure that I can view Flash videos and Flash websites.LTEI use Tmobile for my phone so I took my sim card to a Tmobile store and had them cut it down to micro sim card size so that I can put it into my Xperia Tablet Z.  Worked like a charm. I get amazingly fast LTE speeds (when I'm in an LTE area).  I can use Skype to place calls over LTE, however, placing Google voice calls does not work.DISPLAYThe display is bright and crisp.  I'm not sure how the display stacks up to Samsung Galaxy Note tabs or even Ipad Air, but it definitely exceeds the Ipad 3 that I was using.BATTERY LIFEUsing the stamina mode, the battery life is excellent. I can use the tab all day and still have juice left at night before charging it. Stamina mode turns off radios and stuff when the display sleeps.  Quickly turns everything back on when you double tap to wake it up.WIFI/BLUETOOTH/LTE CONNECTIONConnections to these radios all work very quickly.  I've had no connectivity issues with any of them.  I use a bluetooth headset as well as use bluetooth to easily and quickly \"throw\" files to my phone or my laptop.SOFTWARE / UISony's skin is very limited and allows the tab to feel very close to stock Android.  I added Nova Launcher because I do like to have a little bit more of customization.SPEED / PROCESSINGThe Xperia Tablet Z flies when it comes to processing.  It can handle everything I throw at it.CAMERAThe stock camera is vastly improved with the 4.3 update.  I also installed 3 other 3rd party cameras which all have different features that I like to use under different circumstances.  The camera performs satisfactorily but doesn't quite match the cameras on some of the flagship smartphones these days (Galaxy S4, LG G2, HTC One, etc).GPSGPS works flawlessly and connects very quickly.  I was able to use Google Maps to guide me to several destinations.BUILD QUALITYThis device feels nice in my hand and very solid. It is light weight and I never get tired of holding it. The back has a nice smooth rubber back which feels upscale while allowing for a good grip.  Frequently I swap out the sim card to put back into my phone which requires opening and closing the plastic sim card slot cover.  I do the same with the charging port cover frequently as well.  So far the slot covers still close up tightly just as well as they did when I first got the device.  I highly recommend that you do not bend the slot covers backwards so that they will always close tightly.  I'll probably get a charging dock which will render the removal of the charging port slot cover a moot point.Conclusion:I really like this tab and highly recommend it.  I enjoy it 100x's more than the Ipad 3 I had been using. I was able to play with an Ipad Air at the Mac store and though I was impressed with it (light weight and nice display) I couldn't see myself enjoying being stuck with Itunes and inability to customize.I found on xda developers the method for rooting the Xperia Tablet Z LTE version and will be rooting it soon.  I'll post an update on how that went and what extra benefits I've unlocked (if any) by doing so.", "Title": "Pure Joy, Can't Put It Down", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Author": "Kim Schultz", "ReviewID": "R26XZE93VM7C9L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like a few other reviewers this Sony tablet is replacing an Asus Transformer that, compared to this tablet, is worthless.  Not all Asus tablets are junk, but the TF201 is...pure and simple.  Unfortunately it took over a year for the major problems to surface.  Initially I gave the TF201 a good review!  I will update that!The display on this tablet is breathtaking...seriously!  And holding it is nothing short of pleasurable.  So light and thin you hardly know it's there.Set up was a breeze.  Have not had one hiccup with my Wi Fi connection, or any of the keyboard glitches that others have complained about.  And I use this tablet every day and basically do everything on it while outside of work.  My only complaint is the same complaint I have with all of these electronics that ship with so much junk already installed.  I have not uninstalled anything for fear of removing something important but that is my next project!I have had some disappointing experiences with Sony products in the past so I was a little hesitant with this purchase.  I purchased a Sony digital frame about 6 months ago that has an amazing display so that really was the catalyst in getting me to give Sony a chance with this tablet.  So far worth every penny.

I had purchased it on the day Staples was offering $100 off. I kept it for a few months before selling it on eBay. There was nothing wrong with it though, just that I had no real use for it. Back then, the android app ecosystem for tablet apps was still in nascent stage and the novelty of this new tablet wore off quickly after first few weeks.I did not buy my second tablet until 2013. I wanted to be sure that the next tablet I buy should not follow the way of my first tablet. And since my earlier tablet was android, I gave Win8 a shot this time. I bought a refurb Samsung ATIV 500T. It has a 11.6 inch screen (which I loved) and also comes with a stylus. Initially I loved this tablet (like you would any new gadget) for its large screen and stylus and full desktop OS. And honestly speaking... the Win8 edge gestures (swipe from left to open recently used apps, swipe from top to minimize an app, swipe from top and continue swiping till the bottom edge to close an app, swipe from right to access the charms bar) is the coolest thing to happen to any touchscreen device on any OS. But soon I realized that the app situation for Win8 is even worse than what it was for android tablets back in 2011! And technically speaking, Win8 tablets should not even need apps because it does support full-fledged desktop applications. But its not the same... there is a reason we all have 22+ inches monitors hooked to our desktop for! And the apps that are present keep crashing all the time (netflix, fresh paint). So I ended up returning this tablet too!Soon after I bought this Sony Xperia Tablet Z 32GB (White) from Sony's website. Amazon did not have them in stock and Sony was offering 10% discount for some kind of promotion. I love my new tablet. It is very sleek and light in weight. So light that I'm using this to watch netflix in my bed (before falling asleep) - couldn't do that with my ATIV 500T because it was not comfortable to hold in one hand. I was slightly worried about ordering a white one but I can confidently say now that this white tablet does not make me look girly at all (also confirmed by my wife and my 2 year old). This tablet has an IR port and comes with a remote control app, and I was able to pair my Samsung TV and Motorola set top box with this tablet on first attempt. I keep flipping channels when my wife is watching her soaps and she has no idea whats going on. She thinks that our TV might be possessed. I might enjoy this a little while longer. This tablet is also PlayStaion certified meaning I could easily pair my PS3 dualshock controller with this tablet (uses bluetooth) without having to root it first! I look forward to playing FPS games on this tablet now that I don't have to use the touchscreen to aim anymore. Another feature I love is that this tablet wakes up from sleep by a simple double-tap on the screen. I never realized how much I hated fumbling around for the hardware button until this feature came along. Kudos to Sony for inventing/implementing this feature.Bottom line is that this is not a cheap tablet by any means and this tablet does not have the best screen or the best processor or the best GPU but it works very well as a complete package. When held in hands, it feels like a premium well-made product. When using, it feels snappy enough that I do not notice any lags or freezing issues. Overall, this tablet has provided me with a very pleasant experience and I do not feel like putting this tablet down even for a moment.

I wanted to get a lighter/ large screen/ resistant tablet for my parents and also switch myself to an iPad Air in a few months time. So I got the Xperia Tablet Z and decided to play with it for a while before passing it on.Well, the news is that I might keep it. Gorgeous hardware, smooth operation. Very light. All the pros and cons have been nicely highlighted before, my personal take would be:- I also use an Xperia phone and there is a Sony Xperia app for easy data connection via Bluetooth, plus its own widget to control it. No more creating private WiFi network on the phone, setting the data sharing, manually connecting the tablet etc. when out of the WiFi coverage. It literally took me 2 minutes to set everything up once and that's it.- IR blaster and the accompanying app, very handy. I managed to input functions of all of my remotes (7 in total) into the app very quickly (15 minutes, if that much) so I can stove them away. Remote mess be gone.- I like using music apps and in that sense, iPad is leaps and bounds ahead of Android. Especially in the professional domain. But I also use my computer for music creation, so the iPad was more of an additional gadget (I don't perform live). What I would miss most is using the iPad as a remote surface for Apple Logic music software.- I also like drawing/ sketching/ painting and it that sense Android is way behind as well, app-wise. Again, on the flip side, I do design for living and have a 27\" iMac and Wacom tablets (and real pen and paper and markers...).Some time ago I have decided to become less platform-reliant and therefore started using contact, calendar, notes etc. solutions that can work on any platform (either Apple software that can sync via Google, or 3rd party apps). In that sense, the transition from iOS to Android has been quite painless. And there are things I like in Android better, for example the on-screen keyboard: I was never happy with the iOS all-caps rendering, plus on newer Android you can make it smaller and even split it. Also the freedom to arrange the home screen in a flexible manner, little things like that.All in all, very happy at the moment, I still have couple of months to go before the time comes to give it away \u2014 or not. I like Sony as a brand and this tablet embodies it very nicely: great quality and design (nothing earth-shattering, just very, very pleasant to use).", "Title": "iPad 3 > Xperia Tablet Z", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Author": "Poogy", "ReviewID": "RA9D0A04FC396", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Xperia Z is definitely pretty and impressively constructed.  Very thin (less than 7 mm/slightly more than 1/4 in) and light (one pound), it's easy to carry around, and you can hold it with one hand while operating it with the other--unusual for a 10-inch tablet.  It's water and dust resistant, as a result of plastic caps that cover the 3.5mm headphone jack, micro USB port, and microSD card slot around the perimeter.  So you really can use it in the bathtub if you're so inclined, but more realistically, you don't have to worry about spills or rain or humidity.  (Those little caps seem flimsy, though, and I suspect that eventually one or more may break, destroying the water resistant feature.)  Although it's plastic, it looks great and other than the plastic caps on the ports, feels very solid. Completely flat, with slightly rounded corners.I find that the gorgeous glass screen gets covered with fingerprints very easily.It has a microSD slot so you can add plenty of extra storage(up to 64 GB)on top of the 16 GB it comes with.The 10.1-inch 1920x1200 LED-backlit HD LCD \"Bravia Reality Display\" doesn't have the resolution of, say, the Nexus 10 (300 ppi vs. 224 ppi), but it looks clear and crisp, with good black levels.It comes with an 8MP back-facing camera and a 2MP front-facing camera.  I expect little from a 2MP camera, and this one's about average.  The 8MP camera is adequate, but particularly in low light, subpar.It carries a 6000mAh battery (as opposed to, say, the Nexus 10's 9000mAh).  I get a couple of days of use on a full charge, with about six hours of screen use tops. This is a few hours less than a number of other tablets that don't have to sacrifice battery capacity for thinness and light weight. It has a Stamina Mode that disables data when the screen is off, allowing very long standby time if you can live without updates and notifications during that time.  There's a battery menu with a standby timer that's pretty accurate.  Charging the battery through the miniUSB port is quite slow.The two speakers produce better than average volume for a tablet, but don't expect great sound from such tiny speakers.I'm not crazy about the keyboard the Xperia comes with.  The autocorrect isn't very accurate, and neither is the swype input.  But there are other keyboards out there you can download.This is a Wi-Fi only tablet that connects to 802.11b/g/n networks on both 2.4 and 5GHz frequencies. Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC are also on board.  All work well.The Xperia Tablet Z is powered by a quad-core 1.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro processor with 2GB RAM, and it's faster than most.  It handles graphics-intensive games well, and web browsing is speedy.In summary, the Xperia Z is attractive, speedy, and light.  The main cons are mediocre camera and battery life.  Value for the price is very subjective, and it's debatable whether this tablet is worth the premium price. Other tablets can perform most of the same functions for a lower cost.  But this is about as good as an Android tablet gets at the moment.", "Title": "Solid, Beautiful Android Tablet", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "Bernard Shomin", "ReviewID": "R2UL1XUFH7R3WZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yep, and it survived!

I did quite a bit of research and comparing between other top tablets before purchasing. I kept coming back to the Xperia, even though I had never actually seen it in person. I ended up ordering it off Amazon without ever seeing it, that was how smitten I was with it! The design of the tablet was so striking and elegant to me. I love the thinness and the squared off corners. To me it makes it look like less of a kid's leapfrog pad and more like the sophisticated internet machine that it is. The screen is crisp and leaves nothing to be desired. Response to the touch screen is extremely fast and I have not seen any lag. The operating system is easy to learn (this was my first android product) and it works marvelously. The battery life for me, with normal internet surfing, social media, Netflix, and book reading through Google play is about 3 days. I've seen in reviews it takes awhile to charge, but I just plug it in over an 8 hour shift or overnight, so I have no complaints. I do use the tablet all the way down to about zero battery before charging it. I've heard that charging batteries like that in general helps prolong the battery life, so I'll keep doing it. The speakers on the side are an interesting choice, but depending on how you hold it if your hands cup them it amplifies the sound. Laying it flat on a counter or in an empty bathroom sink also amplifies it. The sound is good considering how tiny the speakers really are. I have not tested the waterproof feature like some people, but it is comforting knowing that I don't have to worry if I take it in the bathroom to play tunes while showering or if I drink tea while using it or bring it into the kitchen while cooking. Not having to baby it or worry about it is really nice. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone and everyone! I honestly would never buy a different tablet. Sony's eye for simplistic, quality, and sophisticated design makes the tablet itself a beautiful gadget, and the Android operating system makes it powerful and intuitive to use.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3KRN5G46J0U0Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been eying tablet PC's for many years, however I never pulled the trigger because it seemed my only choice was an Apple IPad and I do not like apple products, nor did I like the way Apple arrogantly refuses to offer external storage on their products. Once Samsung started to make a name for itself in the tablet market I found myself drawn to the Galaxy Tablet, but for some reason I did not want to pull the trigger when I saw it in the store a couple of weeks ago.  Instead of rushing a Galaxy Tab 3 purchase, I decided to go home and do more research.My research introduced me to the Sony Xperia Z Tablet.  Specs wise, the Sony is superior to the Galaxy Tab 3 in processing power (Quad core vs Dual Core), screen resolution as well as a higher rated camera.  Another plus is that this tablet is water proof and can be fully submerged into water and it won't ruin the tablet.  (requires all ports be closed).For me the choice was clear even though the Xperia was considerably more in cost than the Galaxy.  After more research and spending nearly an hour comparing the two side by side in the store.  I decided to purchase the Xperia.For the most part this tablet does not disappoint but there are some things I wish were there.The good.Look/Feel:Originally I did not like the way the tablet felt in my hands when using it in the store.  It felt generic and honestly I like the feel of the galaxy tablet better.  However after getting it home and playing with it all night, I really do like the sleekness and the feel.  It's light, but it feels professional and sturdy.Processing Power:As with my Galaxy S, when using the Galaxy Tab 3 in the store, I would notice that applications would occasionally stutter or freeze.  However with the Xperia I did not run into this problem when using it in the store and only once or twice since using it for about three weeks now.  Applications are extremely responsive and screens touches are immediately recognized with no delay.Screen:The screen is beautiful and puts out vibrant colors, when comparing the same videos between this and the Galaxy Tab, the Xperia just looked better. The Galaxy's screen colors looked washed out when comparing the two tablets side by side.Water Proof:While I have no plans on using this around water, I just think the fact that this tablet is completely water and dust proof is just cool.  I saw the demonstrations online where the person would completely submerge the tablet in water while it was powered on.  Finally I got up the nerve to try this demonstration myself and luckily it did not ruin the tablet.  I have attached a picture showing my Xperia tablet functioning while it was completely submerged.Battery Life:Surprisingly, the battery life on this tablet is very good.  My Galaxy S phone will be completely dead after only a few hours even when not using it.  However this tablet does a very good job in managing its battery life.  I used this tablet continuously for about 8 hours and the battery life went down to 40% before I decided to charge it again.Things I don't likeSony Xperia Link Software:While I purposely got the wi-fi version of the tablet because I did not want to pay my wireless provider a monthly fee for a data plan, I noticed that there was a pre-installed application that would allow me to link the tablet to my cell phone's network to use when Wi-Fi isn't available.  However I quickly found out that it requires an Xperia Phone and will not work with other manufacturers phones.  This wouldn't be so bad because I need another phone anyway, but my wireless provider does not sell Xperia phones, so I have to buy one from a third party or Ebay which is not always 100% reliable.No way to play music from other devices via BluetoothI have tried but I could not figure out a way to play music from my laptop on my tablet via bluetooth audio.  I'm able to do it the other way around but that is it.  This isn't a big drawback, but it would be nice if I could do it.  To get around this I just copied all my music on a microSD card and popped it in the tablet.No support for Amazon Instant Video (update 1/2/2013: see comments section for workaround)This isn't really the fault of the Xperia tablet, but it's worth mentioning that if you expect to be able to watch Amazon Instant Videos on the beautiul screen, then you will be disappointed.  According to Amazon, there is no support for Amazon Instant video on any android device \"at this time\".  Apparently Amazon only caters to Apple devices as well as their own kindle.  This is an annoyance and it would have been nice to be able to watch Amazon instant movies on my tablet instead of having to watch them through my XBOX or PS3.  This was one of the major things that stopped me from purchasing this tablet sooner, but I figured that even with this drawback, I still prefer the Xperia Tablet over the iPad, and the Kindle.UPDATE:  With help I was able to get Amazon Instant video to play on my device.  As you can see in the comment section, it requires the Dolphin browser, the JetPack plugin, and the last available version of flash for android.  Adobe no longer supports flash for Android, but you can still download their last android version of flash from their website by googling \"Flash archived versions\" and scrolling down to the android section.  You also have to make sure you have flash enabled in your Dolphin browser settings, and make sure Agent is set to desktop.  Once you have everything set up properly you can watch Amazon Instant video via the Dolphin browser just as you would on a regular PC.  In addition to Amazon Instant video you can also watch videos from other sites as well (such as Full Episodes on Fox).No flash for cameraAfter I got it home and took some sample pictures, I was surprised to notice that there was no flash.  I kind of assumed it would have a flash and was disappointed when I didn't find one.  However I then realized that the Galaxy Tab 3 doesn't have a flash either so nothing was really lose here.  However at this price I would expect the camera to have a flash.Wi-fi connection sometimes drops for no reasonI have noticed that when connected to wi-fi, the tablet will sometimes without warning disconnect itself from the network.  I have not figured out what I can do to prevent this and have no clue on when its about to happen.  Some days it keeps the connection all day, but one other days I would get 4 or 5 automatic disconnections.  This is very annoying but luckily it doesn't happen often enough for it to be a major problem (yet).Despite the issues I have with this tablet, I think its the best choice for me and with this tablet currently being sold for 20% off its original price its a great deal and a great alternative to the iPad.", "Title": "Near perfect tablet", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Author": "Juan S\u00e1nchez", "ReviewID": "RDX7UEMTIJNEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great choice the best of Sony works excelent if you have already a Sony Xperia smartphone or any Sony device", "Title": "great", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Author": "Vlad Pitt \"technocrazy\"", "ReviewID": "R1KXULF133VDXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought it will be a toy for me.. but now I am actually using it sometimes for work related stuff...

I've been in the market for a higher end large screen tablet for the last year but haven't been able to find anything affordable and impressive enough to replace my rooted HP TouchPad Wi-Fi 32 GB 9.7-Inch Tablet Computer (which I mainly use for home browsing and games) and Kindle Fire 7\", LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers (which I carry with me primarily as an e-reader on my work commute).

I found this ability very useful as I'm always carrying my tablet around the house with me.+ Water resistant and immersible in a meter of water for 30 minutes (although I'm not personally brave enough to test it).  Read in the tub without worry if that's your thing!+ Playstation Certified allowing me access to the Playstation Suite.  This is perfect for me as I've been a loyal Playstation owner since the system's original launch in 1994.+ Respectable external speakers, however the sound is fantastic when wearing headphones.+ Decent battery life (approximately 7-8 hours for me), even when using heavier applications.+ 720p video recording complete with video editing features.+ Runs on Android 4.1 Jellybean and is upgradable to 4.2 Jellybean.+ Full tablet start up in mere seconds.Cons- Unable to charge directly via the USB cable into a PC port.  Tablet must be plugged into the AC adapter (included) which plugs into a standard electrical socket.  Charging time also seems a bit longer than my other devices.- Ports can be troublesome to find as they're extremely well disguised and difficult to open if you have large hands and short fingernails.  Unfortunately, these snug seals are necessary for waterproofing the tablet.- Like most tablets on the market, the external speakers are good, but it's still a portable device so don't expect home theater sound.- High price point, however considering what you're getting it's difficult to argue.- Pressing the volume control button can be a little problematic at times depending on the angle.- USB charge cable is quite short at only 3'.  Since you have to charge the device using the AC adapter it's bothersome since I'm always more than 3' from an outlet.- Screen is prone to excessive fingerprint smudging.  If that bothers you you'll either have to clean it often or get a screen protector.The Sony Xperia Z SGP311U1/B 10.1-Inch 16GB Tablet is without a doubt one of the most impressive 10.1\" tablets on the market today.  It boasts so many impressive features it's  easy to overlook it's few minor flaws.  Before I even received this tablet I began researching and purchasing products to better accessorize the gadget which would soon be glued to my hand.  I picked up the Poetic Slimline Case for Sony Xperia Z Tablet 10.1 Black (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic), Sony IT Charging Cradle for Xperia Tablet Z (SGPDS5) and Fosmon Crystal Clear Screen Protector Shield for Sony Xperia Tablet Z - 1 Pack.  As other reviewers have stated, this tablet is not an iPad killer, however if you enjoy the freedom of the Android operating system you'd be hard pressed to do better than the Sony Xperia Z SGP311U1/B 10.1-Inch 16GB Tablet.  It's an amazing tablet overall and a much needed upgrade from the current tablets I use so I couldn't be happier with it.", "Title": "A slim, sleek and superb 10.1\" tablet from Sony", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Author": "Maria Thompson", "ReviewID": "R2VUXMRUV3E9MP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you go to the Sony website and read the self help section you will see others, like myself, have had issues with the screen shutting down for no reason.

The overall look and feel was impressive. It was as light as expected. In short, it was exactly as described. The more I worked with it, the more I liked it. The Water Resistant feature was a big, big, big, big plus for me.The deal killer for me was in the Android operating system, which I knew would be a risk when I ordered it. A major use for the tablet is viewing Amazon Instant Videos. Yes, I knew that this Sony tablet was not a Instant Video Compatible Device, and Flash Player is no longer supported by Adobe for Android operating systems... and there is no Android version of Silverlight... but so many websites claimed to have a \"work around\" - just download a different browser app, or use a hacked version of Flash Player...Well, after getting the tablet and running through all the different websites \"fixes,\" my conclusion is that there is no acceptable fix at this time.I don't blame Amazon, my Instant Videos play well on my Win 7 laptop (as well as iPads and other compatible devices). Why should Amazon bend over to accommodate a major competitor. I also don't blame Sony, I have a Sony Vaio laptop and I am just as happy with it.But I'm done trying to fit a square peg in a round hole - I'm getting a Kindle Fire HDX. If you're a cynic, you are thinking that I'm falling right into Amazon's marketing plan. I disagree for several reasons including the one discussed above.

I thought the battery was not in it when I first unpacked it as shown in the video. From there the base functionality is just like any Android device with some added benefits.  The screen quality was excellent, even dimming it some to conserve battery life.Battery life: I easily got eight hours of usage out of the device including browsing, streaming, playing with apps and connecting to everything I could find in the house via IR or on the network.  I did dim it to about 65% as I find no need for the brightest setting.  In saying that this is like any other tablet that in direct sunlight you will not see it perfect.  Think eInk technology of the Kindle for that.  It takes a normal amount of time compared ot other tablets to recharge and can use any micro USB charger which is an added benefit. No special adapters needed.Tablet size and weight: I was shocked at how light it is. Really, It still amazes me and anyone that picks it up. I did a direct comparison to the iPad for you in the video so you get an idea of overall length and width. It is both slightly wider and longer.  The downside is that every bag I have is made for iPad or smaller and the length of the Xperia was not on their game plan.  It is easy to hold yet when typing in landscape the keys are spread out quite a bit.Hardware specs: As supplied on this page above, the specs are terrific with the Snapdragon processor and available memory that is built in.  The ability to add a micro Sd card to the device for expansion shuts down any thought of the iOS devices.  I had no issues with any of the buttons, tabs for the port openings or connections.Waterproof (really?) : yes it is.  I dunked it. Quickly, but definitely under water for a short time.  I sat panicked and astounded at the same time.  It worked, was totally dry and sealed tight.  If you use the tablet around the sink when cooking this is perfect!Connectivity: I easily connected it to my wifi and home network. I connect it at Panera's, work, library.  Everywhere.  At home it sees my Windows media shares and can easily stream movies and music.  Simple and effective streaming.  It even has a FM radio? Really? The IR controls worked well if you point right at the device.  I have my TVs and a stereo working great from it.Android: This runs on Jelly Bean so expect updates and more features to come along.  Also with the open Google Play store apps can be found for just about anything.  I used Skype to make calls, our corporate instant messaging app to communicate and more.Sound: The built in speakers are decent.  Nothing exciting.  they don't distort and didn't sound like tin or anything.  They are just ok.Downsides:- Sony provides it's own app store and the Google Play store is on the device.  They do not see each other so if I instal an application from Google Play and look at the same app in the Sony store it shows not installed.  I skipped the Sony one and deleted it.- The remote control function is cool but I wish it let me just pick a TV make and model instead of making my look at 72 different remote layouts for a Samsung (for example) and pick the best one.  The IR works great but that was a pain and time consuming to set up for multiple devices.Overall this is a killer device from Sony and should be looked at as a viable choice for anyone with tons of added benefits over others.  Expansion, waterproof, battery life and more.See the video for setup and my other opinions!", "Title": "Unbelievably light, fast performance and great battery life", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "Doug Hibbard", "ReviewID": "R17D0EVWOBDGAK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Two years ago, I thought I did not need a tablet. Then, I jumped on the Fire bandwagon and gave it a shot. I thought that was awesome, and have used that tablet constantly.I thought, though, that I could not imagine finding a use for a 10-inch tablet. After all, I have a laptop...Now that I have fired up the Sony Xperia Z, I'm thinking the Fire is headed for the \"here, kids, have a toy\" pile.Why?1. Battery life. When in use for email, Evernote, web-browsing, and Nozbe (to-do organizer), I have used my Xperia for 8 hours. Throw in some music in the background, and it still lasted 8 hours. Admittedly, this is just for music and note-taking, reading, and typing. Still, the ability to use a tablet all day and not have to carry the laptop around for \"while waiting\" tasks? Excellent.2. Screen size. Obviously, you can read the description and do the math, but the difference is amazing compared to how cramped a 7-inch is.3. Thickness. Lack thereof, really. That quarter-inch makes the Xperia easy to hold all day long.4. Small-apps setup. I don't know if another device offers this, but the Xperia has both regular apps and \"small apps.\" The small-apps allow a small notepad, timer, calculator, and a few others, right on top of another running application. Since I frequently use my tablet for presentation notes, the ability to add a timer on top is wonderful--I had been using a KFire and either smartphone or additional tablet. Now, it's all right there.5. Water-resistance. What can I say? A bit of dampness, like a kitchen with steam and splash don't hurt the Xperia. I will not risk mine in full-immersion, but I am not afraid to get it a shade splashed.6.Wi-fi range: I can extend about 50 feet farther from my wifi than I could previously. I'll put that on the receiver of the Xperia.7. Cameras: both are good--although the lighting is not perfect. I'm a lousy photographer anyway, so I'm in no place to give you a good feedback.8. Speed: A few other reviews give you specifics on stats. I'll say this: it pulls apps up quickly. There is a minimal hesitation, but I used to have a Commodore 64 and remember typing load before supper so I could play a game afterwards. A few extra seconds wouldn't bother me. But I don't feel like I'm waiting and waiting.9. Sound quality: I'm a bit on the flat-eared side, so I won't say it's concert quality, but it's better than I expected given the size.10. Memory card. That's good--can save pics or other non-cloud synced items and get them back if the tablet goes splat.Now, drawbacks:A. The water-resistance needs the covering flaps on the ports closed. The covers, though, feel flimsy in their attachment. Additionally, it does not appear that they can be replaced if they are torn off or lost. So, that feature can bite the dust if you're not careful.B. Price: it's within the expectations for this type of device, but still, none of them are cheap.C. TV-Remote: I don't think I really need this, and it's more sensitive to having to be pointed exactly right than my universal remote. So, it's a space-user that cannot be removed. You might like it, I don't need it.D. Sony Apps/music/movies: more just a gripe than a real drawback: I've got Amazon apps, Amazon music, Amazon movies. I've got iStuff apps, music, and movies...and while the music will work, the movies don't. Some of the apps do--except the \"Fire Versions\" that I have. Just one more thing to adjust to.I will say this: I've not gotten my hands on the newest iPad or Samsung, but for a straight-up, does this Tablet deliver what Sony says it will question, I find the Xperia to work as well, or better, than expected based on the specifications.", "Title": "And now, my Fire goes to the shelf", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Author": "Sam1973", "ReviewID": "R3RU5X45RDS6KU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since I couldn't wait for shipping I bought this 32 GB tablet from Fry's electronics.

When it works properly, it really is quite special. However, it working properly is not at all a sure thing, and that unreliability makes using it in a professional context, as I had hoped to do, completely impossible. I'm a musician, and had planned to use this table both on stage and with students. The unit freezes and goes into an endless restart sequence that can take hours to resolve. I have to hard reset the unit many, many times before it randomly starts up properly. Along the way it will freeze at various points of the startup process, or will make it all the way to being fully booted up, only to freeze and/or crash and reboot itself.Eventually, I will get it to boot into a stable state. It is then a pretty cool tablet, but I dare not count on it for anything other than light entertainment before bed, as it has proven to be completely unreliable.It seems like things I've found that are possible triggers for the wonky behavior are SD cards and widgets, but I have reset the device to factory state several times and the problems continue, even with no third party apps installed.It has been this way since I first received it, and I probably should have returned it right away. However, I can usually eventually (sometimes after hours of resets) get it working properly, and it's easy to convince yourself that it is \"finally\" going to work as advertised. The trap of the optimist.I hate this tablet like I have rarely hated an inanimate object.

I have previously shied away from 10\" tablets because of price and weight.Our family owns a Kindle Fire HD 7\" and Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\".  Previously, we were attracted to 7\" models because of the lower price point, weight, and ease of use (I have small hands).  Both tablets are great in their own right; they each have their unique strengths with the Samsung being used for all-purpose application while I use my Kindle Fire HD primarily because of the Prime Instant Video usage as well as my books and ability to listen to my 16,000 song selection via the cloud.That said, I was a little apprehensive about the 10.1\" Sony Xperia Z.  I was concerned about the size and relative ease of use and the weight was a concern as well.  My wrists aren't what they used to be and my wife has permanent neurological damage to her wrists and arms sustained during a car accident.ERGONOMICS/WEIGHTOut of the box, I was both amazed by how THIN this tablet was (thinner than a pencil!) and by how light it was.  At merely over 1 lb, this tablet weighs only 2 OUNCES more than my 7\" Kindle Fire HD.  The very thin profile of this tablet also makes it amazingly easy to hold and grip.  I did wind up purchasing a case for it MoKo Slim Cover Case for Sony Xperia Tablet Z 10.1 inch, Black (with Flip Stand, Integrated Elastic Hand Strap, and Stylus Loop)-Lifetime Warranty, and even the additional bulk of this case made it easy to hold and the wrist strap on this case completed abated my ergonomic concerns.  Top marks.STARTUPThis thing kicks on in a hurry.  I didn't even get to 7 seconds before this thing was fully booted up and ready to go.  The quad-core processor probably has a lot to do with this.OPERATION/PERFORMANCEThe quad core 1.5 GHz processor appears to work fast...blazingly FAST.  There is no noticeable lag starting up any of my applications and was able to run a couple without any noticeable degradation in performance.The wireless connection snapped to my router immediately and makes use of either my \"g\" or \"n\" bandwidths as I choose.  I have a Samsung Galaxy III which I use as a mobile hot spot and the Sony connected to it in stride, able to make full use of the speeds that I had available.  (I have a 40 Mbps connection at home).SCREEN/DISPLAYThe image is stunning - the 1920 x 1200 display is pure eye candy and watching movies in HD on it is a portable wonder.BRIGHTNESS CONTROLThe Sony does have a separate sensor for automatic brightness control if you want to conserve your battery to the maximum intent possible.At maximum brightness, the Sony's display is eye-piercingly brilliant...I don't think that I would want it any brighter at all.  Contrast is very well done (with some of the limitations that you expect with LCDs, but top marks nonetheless) and colors are very well produced and rich without oversaturation.SOUND QUALITYSimply ok.  The onboard speakers get the job done, but I found the Kindle speakers to be more impressive as a standalone audio device.  That said, I typically use my headphones or my Bluetooth speaker anyway, so this is not a huge disappointment for me.  The sound through the headphones/Bluetooth speaker is quite good.BATTERY LIFEI'd say that the battery life is probably a good 8.5 to 9.5 hours depending on your usage, the quality of your wireless connection (AND if it's on), whether you have GPS on/off, and/or your brightness setting.  It's on par with most tablets these days and I haven't noticed any significant variance between this tablet, my Kindle, or the Samsung Tab.MEMORYThis model came with 16 GB on-board, but you can insert a microSD card for additional memory, unlike the Kindle (hope you're STILL listening Amazon - memory expandability is STILL my biggest pet peeve with the Kindle Fire HD).  I placed a 32 GB Sandisk memory card in there and I dropped in a couple of movies that I like to watch from time to time.The current Android OS doesn't allow aps to be installed on the microSD card, however.  I have heard rumors that the 4.2 Android update should allow this again and Sony is supposed to be getting this update, so I'll update the review if this changes.The memory limit for me comes as one area for improvement (see Room For Improvements below).CHARGINGI'm glad that Sony has opted the use of micro USB input for file transfer and power.  The device comes with an AC adapter for that purpose, but the micro USB cable input grants you flexibility if you need it.HDMII have not tested the HDMI output but I rarely find a reason to use it since I already have a PS3 for Netflix and video viewing anyway, but an HDMI output is available on this unit.  It also has a 3.5 mm jack for headphones.BLUETOOTHAnother plus is the Bluetooth capability of the device and if you have a Bluetooth portable speaker, it's great to use with the tablet.  I have a Monster Bluetooth portable speaker and it sounds great.WATER RESISTIVITYRemarkably, this unit is water RESISTANT to a depth of 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes.  While I don't advocate a \"check this out\" approach, the piece of mind knowing that I could read this in a bathtub, hot tub, next to the kitchen sink, etc., without having to worry about collateral splash damage is a very, very nice feature.  All of the ports (HDMI, microSD, micro USB, and headphones) have a special cover requiring fingernails to pop open.  When you shut them, they fit back with a reassuring fit to ensure water resistance.  But it's only water resistant when these ports are sealed.REMOTE CONTROLIt's a neat little feature - you can use this tablet as a remote control!!  You can select the brand, the type of device that you want to control, and with a little troubleshooting of finding the right IR schemes, you're on your way.  It took me about 2 minutes to get my TV up and running...there is even a manual setup if you want to get even fancier than that.  We own a pair of Logitech remotes, however, so we don't have too much use for it.  But my limited testing shows that this feature works quite well.CAMERAThe 8 megapixel camera that's included on the back takes pretty good pictures.  Like with any smartphone, you just need to have adequate light (see Room For Improvements below).  You can also shoot HD footage on it, but I don't see how easy that would be to use compared to a conventional camcorder.  In a pinch, however, it works pretty well.  The 2 megapixel camera on the front also works well and is satisfactory for Skype usage.SONY ENTERTAINMENTWe have a PS3 at home and we subscribe to Music Unlimited.  While this is an app that's available on smartphones, it has received poor reviews from people who have not been able to use it.  It works just fine on this tablet, however!In addition, you can connect to your online PS3 account to see what's new, what you have downloaded, etc.  However, I wish that it could do more (see Room For Improvements below).FM RADIOOk, not as many people listen to the radio anymore, but including this feature on a tablet is a cool factor for my wife.  Your headphones act as the antenna.  It's not as good as your car, but if you're listening in town, it works quite well.  Just don't expect it to work as great on the fringes where your car encounters some static (you probably won't get anything on the tablet at all).ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS1.  LED light.  Seriously, Sony, how did you not think of incorporating an LED light next to the camera?  They don't take a whole lot of real estate, require fairly minimal power, and is practically a standard on smartphones.  The lack of one is painfully obvious from the get-go.2.  PS3 control.  How do you include Bluetooth capability in a tablet and include an app for remote control of devices, but NOT include any functionality to be able to control the Playstation 3?!?  It's a Sony tablet...and Sony dropped the ball inexplicably in this area.  Granted, you can hook up a dual shock controller to the tablet so you can use the controller to play games ON the tablet...but why can't I pair the tablet to the PS3???3.  Price/4G/Memory.  At $499 and for the size of the tablet, I can currently get a 10\" Kindle and have 4G connectivity with 64 GB of on-board memory!  That's just one example and it's something that's not present on the Sony.  Granted, it's thinner, lighter, faster (quad-core processor)...but these are features that may likely give way to convenient data plans for some buyers.  Although the quad core processor is pretty fast, I haven't seen apps (yet) where this improvement is \"wow I must get this\" factor.  Or perhaps not...it depends on your needs.  The Sony doesn't include 4G which is not a deal-killer for me since I typically use my phone as a hot spot anyway.  However, buyer be warned and informed; there are other options in this regard and certainly at very competitive rates.Overall, it is a fantastic tablet...but there is definitely some room for improvement.Please let me know if you have any questions in the comments.", "Title": "Fantastic tablet with some room for improvements (4.5 stars)", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Author": "LostInTheSouth", "ReviewID": "R3LN1TGIQHZL1H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wonderful picture quality, great size and weight, plenty of HD space, even though I haven't yet put in a micro SD (64 GB is in the near future).Also have a Poetic Slimline Case coming.Only thing is my wife has trouble finding the power port.
