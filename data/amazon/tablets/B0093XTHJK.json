{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Kyle Brotherton", "ReviewID": "R31DUNZA4I10LI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first tablet, and I love it! I bought it largely to stream movies with Netflix (subscription required). Thanks to this tablet, I've also discovered free ebooks and magazines from my local library. I love reading my local newspaper in the free Overdrive app (newspaper subscription required). Checking email, weather reports, and my Hotmail calendar is quick and easy. I'm glad I got a 10\" tablet because magazines, movies, and games can really take advantage of the extra large screen.Over all, I think this tablet is a great value. I would buy it again, and I highly recommend it. Keep in mind that installing a bunch of apps and customizing the tablet may require some extra know-how plus hours (and hours) of your time. I also recommend that you purchase an inexpensive tablet stand (there are several types available on Amazon).I'm probably going to also buy a Kindle e-reader. The e-ink screens are easier on the eyes; and dedicated e-readers are much easier to hold when you're reading a book for several hours.What I like:> Large, beautiful screen> Excellent touch response> Easy to use settings> Convenient buttons for power, volume, and \"back\"> Expandable storage via MicroSD slot> USB connection> Wifi was easy to set up and connect to my home network> Great built-in email client> Great battery life with most apps (several hours)What I dislike:> Cannot access Google Play (a.k.a. Android app store)> Front-facing camera is almost worthless. No flash, can't easily scan QR codes, doesn't work well with Skype app> Built-in speakers are not very loud. You may need to use headphones or an external speaker> Heavy and difficult to hold for long periods of time (like reading a book)> Web pages take a while to load. It's often faster to just turn on my laptop when looking something up> Cannot mount a network drive (or at least I can't figure out how to), although you CAN browse network drives using the included ES File Explorer app> Battery life is too short for reading lots of books (typical problem with color LCD tablets)> No back-facing camera> It takes a while to charge (I feel like it takes several hours, but I haven't timed it)What I use it for:*Note: Some of these apps were hard to find and/or install because this tablet cannot access the Google Play app store.> Watch movies with Netflix app - Netflix subscription required> Listen to music with Pandora app> Read local newspaper with PressReader app - newspaper subscription required> Read ebooks and magazines - borrowed from local library via website (free) - using Overdrive app and Kindle app for ebooks - Zinio app for magazines> Check my Hotmail calendar> Check the weather with Weather.com app (free)> Check email> Check my budget with YNAB app (requires YNAB desktop software)> Surf the web with Firefox app (free)Where I get my apps:> Amazon app store (lots of great free and paid apps)> Aptoide app store (some apps, hit or miss)> papktop.com (some apps, hit or miss)> Getjar (a few apps)> Bing search for the app's \"apk\" file, then transfer the apk file to tablet and install it> Other random app websites (often difficult to use, some may not be entirely legal)Update: I have been using this tablet for a few months. My rating has dropped to a \"3\". Netflix works alright, and so do email apps, magazine apps, weather app, Pandora, etc. Skype doesn't work at all. Web browsing is PAINFULLY slow, and pretty much pointless. Apps freeze all the time. The tablet can't even run the keyboard app smoothly. But the worst part is WiFi. It often loses the wireless connection when I take it more than 40 feet from my router. That is unacceptable. I'm going to sell it and buy a better tablet.

Then FINALLY got CS (customer service - a call center not connected with corporate, or factory or return warehouse)1) Called a week after mailing to ask if they got the return. They had to move. Will take a month to move out to California so the boats from China can deliver these products and they can make more money than from Knowlton, Georgia with reduced shipping. Call back in a month.2) Called one month later they have to close for inventory of new factory. Call back in two weeks. They also said the replacement of the item will be delayed because of shipping from CAL to FL.3) Called two weeks later. The person in charge of reading the CS requests about my status is now on vacation. They don't know exactly when she will be back. Call next week.4) Called next week and the women who processes the requests is nowhere to be found.

The Coby Kryos MID7048-4 did however meet all my expectations.  My main reason for purchasing this tablet was in order to read E-Books.  I installed Kindle for Android and all works great.  I wasn\u2019t sure that I would like reading on a tablet but soon found that I actually prefer it to paper books, not to mention the convenience of not having books stacked all over the place.  Amazon has tons of books available and if you have an Amazon Prime account many are free and many more are very inexpensive.  Browsing the net is expectedly not as convenient as on a full sized computer, but it is certainly a reasonable option when needed.  The screen resolution is quite good though I know more expensive tablets have higher resolutions.  There are tons of applications available from Amazon and the many other Android App. Stores. I have a 32gb Micro SD card installed which works great.  I also purchased a OTG (On The Go - Male Micro USB to Female Standard USB) cable and have accessed both 16 and 32gb USB flash drives. I have had a little trouble reading the flash drives a couple of times but suspect that it is more the cable than the tablet that is at fault.  I have ordered another, hopefully better, cable.  The touch screen works well with the exception of some difference in where you touch the screen and where it registers on the screen.  This seems to be mostly around the edges of the screen.  Once I turned on the option (in the system settings) that shows a blue dot where your touch is registering I soon learned how to compensate. There have been some minor glitches here and there, but nothing that was more than a minor issue and certainly nothing more than one might expect from ANY computer.I had intended to purchase a keyboard case for the tablet but decided that the screen keyboard worked well enough so as not to need one.  I did purchase a basic case made by Poetic. The first one did not fit properly even though it was said to be for the MID7048-4 as it covered up part of the RH side of the screen.  I returned it and ordered another case also made by Poetic which did fit well and which I am quite happy with.  That case is an ASIN: B00ANGOIR2 (product number).  If you are interested in a case do an Amazon search for B00ANGOIR2 and it should bring it up.  It did at the date of this review.One more thing, do not step on the tablet.  Mine slipped off of the bed and I did not realize it until the crunch.  LOL  Ok, so I didn\u2019t laugh at the time, but I did order another Coby MID7048-4.to replace the unfortunate one.", "Title": "For the price", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Author": "S. Austin", "ReviewID": "R1ZC5XQAHWTEWX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet as a Christmas present for my tech-savvy six-year old nephew. He has dominated his Mom's IPad so I though it was time for him to get his own and the price was right. I opened it before giving it to him to set it up with games and educational software. Although the reviews for this tablet are mixed, it really depends on what you want to do with the tablet and how much you want to spend. The display is just okay with a resolution of 800x600 and it's a little dim for me. It has a front-facing 0.3 mega-pixel camera - okay for a child. The tablet runs Android 4.0, has 1Gb RAM and a 1GHz processor. It weights 24 ounces, has an HDMI port, a micro SD card slot for up to 32GB of storage and a built-in microphone and speaker. The speaker was just okay and I didn't test the microphone. You don't have access to Google Play but can download apps from Amazon (after you install the Amazon app package) and also some free apps are included in the GetJar app that is installed. The battery charges pretty quickly and WiFi works fine (we didn't see the problems that others noted.)  At a price of less of $120, this is good first table for children and even some adults.

As other reviewers suggested after my package arrived next day,i  immediately downloaded Amazon store app. I did this by selecting Amazon store app apk. http://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get/android. That is the link that takes u right to the download. It downloaded fast with no issues and from the Amazon store i downloaded Dolphin hd browser,Netflix (which this tablet does play and well not laggy at all. loads lil slower then id like but movie streaming is seamless.) Yahoo mail app,Aim app, Weather channel app and Angry Birds Space and other assorted apps such as games and Amazon Kindle app for downloading books.All Downloaded with no issues and work fine. This is a pretty good E reader as well. There is a one Second Delay when u switch from Landscape to Portrait view but nothing to complain about. It is flash 11 enabled so u can watch you tube videos it does come with the app already loaded and on your home page and it can play videos from sites like solarmovie.so. As far as Facebook games it can play some but not all. So games like Farmville u will need to get Farmville express since the app was discontinued for some reason for which u can find easily by googling it. The Battery life is a little short as others reviewers did say i get about 3 hrs of battery life before it needs to be charged. Standby time is good however lasting easily 10hrs in standby mode. The camera is ok it is front facing and only 0.3 mp but it does have zoom and can take videos. I downloaded skype and skyped with it and built in mic and Camera are ok not great but  people could see and hear me well. Just not recommended in bright areas it will wash out the camera. The built in web browser is decent but i added Dolphin had which i like better Opera Mini is also a good browser. You cannot get Google Play or app store out of box. You could root this tablet and other reviewers have suggested ways to get it to work i did not try them however. Amazon app store plus other various free ware sites Such as getjar freewarelovers.com etc provide a lot of free apps that work fine. Getjar site is working again not all apps will download but most do and are free.  The screen is clear and bright resolution is very good. It is not laggy at all as of yet and when u type it doesn't have that annoying delay from what u type till it appears in your text block. it types very smoothly. All and all it is a good tablet for the 97 bucks u pay for it. I will update this status if any issues arise after i had it for a couple weeks.

It's VERY good for viewing text documents and reading books. The quality seems good and the display is bright and fairly easy to read in the sunlight. The Browser is nice..it's tabbed for multiple page viewing. And having the 10 inch screen has it's advantages. I seldom have to zoom in to read something. I do have trouble viewing flash video in the browser...it just won't do it or I haven't figured it out yet. It does come with a You Tube viewer though and it works nicely. Of course it's being an Android system there are many apps that are fun and useful...you just can't download them from the Google store. Doesn't make sense to me...it's (Google) Android for pitty sake. It just says that it isn't an approved device. Thank goodness for Amazon's Appstore for Androids. You will find most anything you need there. It is a little thick and heavy as tablets go. It isn't an iPad for sure but it works for me...and at a great price, too.5-21-2013...After using it for a few months I have changed my rating from 4 to 1. It was OK as far as reading books and documents, and playing most apps. I had some problems with it though. It gets to where it takes 2 - 5 minutes to load a web page. I called Tech support (no problem getting through)and they told me to try a full reset. I hated to do that because it meant that I would have to re-install ALL of my apps but I did it anyway. It worked so I was happy with it for a short while until it started doing the same thing again. I called them back and they sent me a email explaining how to return it...to include the receipt and a $15.00 money order for return shipping. What really gets me is they state that it will be 6 to 8 weeks to process the claim...WHY SO LONG? It's been 3 full weeks since they received it so I just called and they told me that it still hasn't been entered into the system and that it will probably be a couple more weeks until it does. I'm sorry...that's just unacceptable. Well...I hope I get it back someday. In the mean time I bought a Samsung Galaxy 2 and am enjoying it immensely.8-14-2013...I wish there was a minus star that I could check. I will never buy another Coby device again. It has now been almost 4 months since I returned my tablet to Coby for warranty repair. I WAS able to contact customer care by phone...now even that is unavailable to anyone. You call the PUBLISHED phone number on their website and you get a recording telling you to go to cobyusa.com where the only option you have is to email them...so I did. I have emailed them twice asking them to simply return my tablet. After weeks I have yet to receive even a confirmation that they received my email. I wish I could understand how a company as successful as Coby is could deal with a customer in this manner.I must give Amazon some high praise here. I copied them the last email that I sent Coby. I got an email back from Amazon within hours of when I sent it apologizing for the problem that I have suffered with Coby. Not only that...they have refunded the entire amount that I purchased the tablet for, including tax and shipping. Amazon...you are a class act! I was unable to send return email to them thanking them but I can do that here...Thank you very much.

I was impressed the battery was fully charged when I took it out of the box. That was a thoughtful gesture from Amazon. No problems so far. Very fast connecting with Wi-fi and I already put it 18 movies (via 32gb micro sd) and worked well. It has some apps already installed (basics), but lots of possibilities to advance for more apps out there. I bought this mainly for email checking and watching movies. The battery lasted at least 6 hours of movie watching (surprisingly). The only cons is the resolution, 800 x 480.  This could have been a perfect tablet if the resolution is higher; but for a tablet priced less than $100 bucks, you can never go wrong. I compared this tablet for my Blackberry Playbook which I already own (purchased 2 months ago), this Coby Kyros Mid-7048-4 is faster and more RELIABLE than the Playbook. I only have my Playbook for 2 months and now having issues from it. I must say, not all expensive tablets out there, is really worth as they should. I am glad I bought this Coby Kryos Mid-7048.

I am not sure why other people can't download the apps that I have but here is what I did. I opened it up and charged it for a few mins. Then I connected it to my home WiFi with no problem. I d/l Dolphin browser, Amazon App Store, Netflix, and several other apps from amazon.I restarted the Tablet and checked Netflix to see if it worked and it did no problem. Kindle worked and all of the other apps worked. I noticed several reviews stating that Netflix and Kindle wouldn't work and I am not sure why they had problems.The only downfall I see is that the internet is slow and freezes a lot when browsing. I'm not sure if it is the tablet or my internet. I am thinking my router is going bad so that may be the problem. I am searching for a solution online and will update when I figure out which is which.No you can't have Google Play Store but Amazon App Store, 1Mobile, and GetJar are sufficient for me. I have Google Play on my EVO 4G but rarely use it as I prefer Amazon. Amazon also has the Free app of the day and I have gotten many high $$ apps for free from them.

I was looking for a ten inch tab, but didn't have a lot of cash. I already have the Acer Iconia A-100, which is a great tablet. But i wanted a 10 incher. When i first got it, it ran fine but there was no Google App Store, bummer, So I got the Amazon App Store. everything was working fine but when I loaded Netflix it didn't work, the app loaded fine but the screen would just go blank. I called Coby Customer Service and they said it was a problems with Adobe flash not running right? Anyways, with Coby you actually get a live person however, you may not get one that knows anything. So i looked around on the internet and found that this is a problem with the tablet. I also found a solution. A tech advised to reboot the system and erase factory files. Here is the message ---- \"Power the unit off (holding power buttom) and selecting Power off, then hold simultaneusly back button and on buttom 8 seconds,when the android icon appears press the back button, in the menu select wipe data/factory reset pressing home buttom and then press back buttom, in the next screen select \"yes delete all user data\" pressing back buttom, and in the next screen select \"reboot system now\" with the back buttom and wait. IT WORK FOR MY TABLET.\" ------After doing this download the Good e-Reader app store through Getjar. The Good e-Read app store has everything. Netflix now works great on my tablet. I was also able to down load pretty much every app the Google Play Store has. They even have the Google Play Store app. Anyways, after doing this my tablet runs smoother, seems to be faster and everything works. Took this tablet from a 3 to a 5 star. I now love this tablet.

The major thing is that tablets need a lot more charging than e-ink readers do. I had an Android smartphone a while back before deciding it wasn't worth the monthly plan charges so the OS wasn't a problem. So the Coby Kyros seemed to fit the bill for my needs: it comes with Aldiko ebook reader already installed so I don't even need to be online to get my main use out of it. It's relatively cheap too. It's easy enough to plug into my PC, load up my music, ebooks and movies. I had no major issues with the software as I only wanted an ereader functionality everything else was bonus. There was some stutter here and there while reading books and it would not import some larger pdf file books with lots of pictures but this could be an Aldiko thing. I ran movies and music off my 32gb micro sd card as there's not much room for a lot of those type of files on this, no problems running any of that.I was able to put most of my epub library on there no problem. Aldiko was fairly easy to import my books into once I knew which folder to put them in so it would read the books. I found it to be great for epubs, not that great for pdf's. I particularly liked the feature where it switched the exposure on screen for night reading as it's much easier on the eyes and probably uses less energy since most of the screen is black other than the words. The 16:9 aspect ratio is not the best for holding this as a book for long periods of time I have to say. Also they put the power/vol buttons right where you hold one side of it when in portrait mode for reading, not the best thing but it's not a deal breaker either. It does seem to kick the heat out around there too as my hands got sweaty while reading.I can't comment on the internet part of this since I don't have wifi at home and never needed it while I owned this. The touch screen was pretty responsive. The micro USB port needs to be better positioned as it EASILY gets knocked out while plugged in. I also didn't see a \"charging\" symbol when it was plugged into the PC via USB so I'm not sure if it was charging that way or not, it did fine with the dedicated charger though.I received it from warehouse deals and it was supposed to be in like new condition. Well it was not, the plastic case had a crack down the back that was already half way down and so I returned this for a refund. Coby needs to either use harder plastics, metal or work on their structural design for this item. I went ahead and got another brand and model in the same price range as this one that also has an ereader app as well as has Google play store pre-installed. Pass on this and get a play store item that's designed to be more sturdy for not much more in price.

Its reasonably fast for the money, and it has a decent battery life. However it has some issues. Because most apps won't allow you to install to an external SD card, you are STUCK with the meager 4gb of storage space. It has NO out of the box Google Play support. This can be remedied, but at the risk of possibly bricking your tablet. While it plays most of Glu Mobile's swankier games just fine, you won't be playing larger, beefier games, due to the limited specs and low storage space. So don't get this tablet if you're wanting to play the likes of NOVA 3 or the Modern Combat series on your big screen. Mine developed a glitch that kept disabling the internal storage, and eventually had to get a refund. That might not happen to everyone's, but buyer beware.So there you have it.

Simply use the tablet browser to go to the getjar app website and download the getjar app. When you get the getjar app, download the \"good e-book reader\" app. Another great appstore is called mobile 1 app store. Between the three of these appstores, you have access to almost all of the nicer apps that google play has. Mobile 1 appstore has probably the best selection for a google play alternative. Also, get rid of the default browser and get yourself dolphin browser. The default browser is so and crashes frequently, but the problem is solved simply by installing a different browser.

Up until Tuesday morning, it wouldn't connect to the wi-fi. Every other electronic equipment in my house works fine (and i have at least 3), but this tablet won't connect. It keeps saying \"Out of range\" when I'm sitting only 7 feet from the router.I called Coby on Tuesday morning, and was told to reset the device. It worked fine for about 2 minutes, then same problem started again. It won't connect to the wi-fi!I've only had it for 4 days, so i'm going to give it another 3 days before i send it back.The 9-inch form factor is perfect for me (thus the 2 stars), but the thing has to work!PS: They advertise it as being 1lb, put i put it on a scale, and it's actually 1.25 lbs.Will update soon...*Update 1: June 6, 2012 2-stars rating changed to 3So I returned the first unit to Amazon, and got a replacement. It took 1 hour and $50 for my ISP provider to make the tablet connect to the home wi-fi.Calling Coby customer care for over an hour did not resolve the issue.I had to pay $50 to my ISP provider for them to figure it out for me because the tablet is not their product.I also noticed that the tablet does not come with flash player already installed, so some websites do not work. I've downloaded a flash player from Getjar, yet still no success. I have to spend another half hour or so with their customer service today so they can tell me what to do.So overall this tablet cost me $250, which is 50 bucks way more than I was willing to pay for it. If you add in the over 2 days spent trying to get it to do the number one thing i bought it for (connect to internet), that irks.Depending on the wi-fi settings in your house or wherever you try to connect, this unit might not work. Whereby my old HP Touchpad connects everywhere, every time, without a hitch.**Update 2: June 11, 2012 - 3 stars rating changed to 2I finally found a flash player that works, but it only works with the native browser, not the Google chrome browser that i downloaded.I had to do my own research online to find the right Flash player, because Coby customer support was completely useless. The version that they suggested that i use didn't work, and they became very dismissive over the phone and rushed me off the phone when they saw that what they were suggesting wasn't working. Sad!So all and all, I will go from 3 stars rating to 2 stars because i shouldn't have gone through all that i went through to have this tablet do the No. 1 thing I bought for.It costs me overall $250, too much of my time and a lot of frustration.***Update 3: June 27, 2012 - 2 stars rating changed to 3; Would have given 3.5 if it was possible.Everything now works, except it's very slow. My small laptop with half the Ram of this tablet processes things faster. The tablet is very slow, no matter in what application I'm in, no matter how many applications are running at the same time. The sound is very low as well, so i use the headphones a lot.Not being able to use my Google calendar in it sucks big time! I removed the Google chrome browser and replaced it with Dolphin HD. Much better.So all and all, it took 3 weeks of troubleshooting, extensive internet search, hours over the phone with Coby CS, 2 returns and exchanges to have this thing work properly.If you plan to do anything other than basic internet surfing, you will get frustrated with this tablet if you don't have tons of patience.", "Title": "Seriously?", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Author": "Dolemite", "ReviewID": "R3AYI7LV3RE1BB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me first start by saying that this device is terrible.  Ok, now here is why.1. It is running 4.03 without access to play store.  For some this is not an issue, but most people need apps.  When you hear of an app that you really want, be prepared to not be able to get it.  They give you an app store called get jar, which is a joke.  Get jar has no apps at all.  With some Androids you can manually load Play Store, but this device is locked down.  Impossible.2.  This device is locked down.  I could not even browse files on my own SD card, let alone play a movie or listen to music on my SD card.  When I tried to download a file browser from crap jar I could not find one, but then again I could not search for one.  Every search that actually managed to work came back with the same results.  If I searched for butter I would get angry birds, if I searched for word processor I would get angry birds.  Crap Jar3.  The screen has an issue.  When I would run searches on the web, it would erase what I entered in the search bar when I pressed the search button.  This happened on several different sites, which means that it is the browser or the tablet, and being as I cannot load a different browser I have to live with it.4.  The device is fast, but that is because there is nothing on it.Complete junk.Oh and you might want to carry around a pair of toe nail clippers to get the SD card in and out as regular human fingers just dont seem to cut it.Oh and the usb port is an off standard, so dont go thinking you can use any cables you already own.", "Title": "Stay away", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Author": "V. mills \"vmia16\"", "ReviewID": "RIIPYD5B51GEL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "and it broke.

I have been trying to save money for a tablet for a while, and then received an Amazon gift certificate for Christmas.  This was the only tablet that was completely covered by the gift certificate, and after much soul-searching I decided to \"spend it all in one place\" and go for it.  I am thrilled to be able to see my school's website and class power points on the go - however, it took a lot to get there.The touch screen and on screen keyboard are better than expected.  The wi-fi is intuitive and excellent.  The pre-installed web browser was not supported by my college's online program at all.  I tried installing Chrome (the suggested browser) - however, as noted in most other reviews, this tablet cannot access google play, and play is the only place to download chrome.  So I tried installing firefox from Mozilla's website - which redirected me to google play.  I searched the pre-installed app store - GetJar - however NOTHING I attempted to download from there would work, it would give me an error message.  So then I installed Amazon apps.  That got me *some* apps (many are not even available for download onto this tablet)... however, every time I exited out of Amazon apps and then tried to enter back into it, the appstore wouldn't load and would give me only a black screen and search bar that did nothing.  I worked around this by uninstalling and re-installing Amazon apps each time I wanted to use it, which was tedious.  Meanwhile, I still couldn't get a browser that worked on my school website.  So, all I could do was check my email and facebook, and view pictures from my sd card.  Definitely not worth $100.  A friend found a link to download firefox after some serious searching.  Once I installed firefox, I was able to connect to my school's website and view our online syllabi and power points, but each time a screen loads it still gives me an error message that I must click out of.  That raised this from two stars to three.  Finally, I found. on the Coby wesite, instructions on how to get GetJar to work (you have to access GetJar from the Coby website, not the widget that comes pre-installed).  However, the GetJar site ended up not being worth any of the hassle.  But, Pandora installed and works great.  I can read any office document, but need to pay $15 if I want to be able to CREATE anything, inlcuding any word documents.  Back down to two stars.  I ordered a keyboard/case, and then a usb-to-mini-usb adapter to make it work, and it hooked up instantly and worked with no problems, so that brought it back to three stars.  I am planning on trying the reset described in an earlier review and hoping that google play will then work - but I am not holding my breath.Another serious problem that I have not yet solved is its complete refusal to record sound.  It plays songs fine, but the camera (front facing only, so can really only be used for skyping and the like) is very poor quality, and will NOT record sound.  An email to Coby customer support has gone unanswered.  Apps that have high star ratings don't work either.  So no recording of class lectures with this baby!If you need the ability to compose word documents you will have to pay for an upgrade to the pre-installed office program at $15.  If you want to record sound it will cost you more - perhaps a microphone, or better yet a completely different gadget at $30 or more.  If you want to take pictures, again you will have to buy a different gadget - either a phone with a camera or a camera itself - this one has its camera facing the screen and is poor quality and zero flash.  But if you want to be able to surf the web and check your email on a screen larger than a phone, this one will do it.In summary, had I been able to afford a slightly more new-technology or bigger brand tablet, I would never give this tablet a second thought.  However, considering that if this tablet had not been available I wouldn't have one at all, it isn't all THAT bad.  Better than having none at all, but if you can afford a slightly higher quality brand, do so.", "Title": "Surfing and email, yes.

For $100 I figured I would get a good product the boys could both enjoy.  Now one of my boys has to wait for me to ship it and get a refund so i can go out to best buy and actually buy a tablet i know we can rely on.  This is the worst tablet I have ever seen, I am not happy with this at all.  I will let everyone know not to buy a Coby tablet.  I have used amazon in the past and my boyfriend orders stuff off amazon religiously, but now we are both very unsatisfied.  I do not plan on ordering from Amazon anymore.  I would rather pay the extra money to have a good product I know will be good.  This was a terrible experience I am not willing to take again.  VERY UNHAPPY customer.  :(  I will get a refund for the tablet and never shop on here again.

I bought this for my 9year old son thinking, it's not to spendy, I'll give it a try! I think many parents think the same. DON'T get it! Unless your child did something horrible and you want to punish them by severe disappointment!It has a sub par app store called, get jar. It has junk apps. You can't get google play off of it to make it better. I had to go to amazon and download their app store, it's ok but it's not google play.Getjar also doesn't have Netflix.Oh and by the way it's super buggy, it says if it won't turn on(and at some point it won't, take a paper clip to the reset button. Did that and it still wouldn't turn back on.)A working tablet is a must,having an app store that isn't junk also a must. If you just want to surf the web, watch YouTube or check email you may be happy with it, if it doesn't stop working. Oh, the fb app is junky too...We are Returning it  and spending  the extra money on a better tablet. Nexus 7 or a kindle fire hd.This is not worth the frustration.
