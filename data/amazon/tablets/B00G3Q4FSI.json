{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Britton", "ReviewID": "R1VJ8XGNNQYFPD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received as a birthday gift around the holidays and I have used it every day ever since.I am a bit of a techno-phile.  I've been using computers since the days of parachute pants and the mullet.  I have both Windows and Linux computers and have fully embraced the Android OS.  I still cannot bring myself to spend the money required to own Apple products, so I cannot and will not compare this to an iPad.What a handy device it really is!  It's wifi ready, has a headphone jack, a mini-HDMI output, and it can be charged with either a supplied A/C charger or a micro-USB charger.  Its 7\u201d screen size keeps the whole thing manageable but much bigger than a phone screen.  I think it\u2019s an excellent balance of size and convenience.  My wife can keep it in her pocketbook without feeling weighted down or feeling like it has taken over her bag.  If I had to, I could keep it in the front pocket of a pair of slacks (not jeans, though).Even a newbie Android user should be able to figure out how to use this tablet.  Follow the instructions to fully charge the batteries before using without the plug.  But I started working on it right away with the device plugged in.  The Settings screen is accessible through the bottom of the screen and the apps list button on the home screen.  Through Settings you can get to the wifi settings where you log in to your local network.  I was on the internet in less than a couple of minutes.  After a quick download through the Play store, all my favorite apps including IMDB, Accuweather, Firefox and more were immediately available.  It also loaded my favorite games including 7 Little Words, Angry Birds and Texas Hold\u2019em.  To add a recent picture I took as my wallpaper, I loaded QuickPic to organize my pictures and Tonido to access all my favorite files from my home computer.I asked for this tablet as a gift to provide two tasks, both of which it handles very well.The first is to give me internet access - mostly IMDB - while I'm watching TV with the Queen.  The wife and I love to watch TV and movies and we are always wondering where we've seen that actor/actress before.  It works very well for just about any online access you will need.  I\u2019ve even used it in the kitchen to try a new recipe for banana bread.The other task was to have an easily portable tablet available for when the Queen and I are running errands or on a road trip.  I've installed the 'hot-spot' option on my cell phone so when we're out and about, we can easily log into the internet via wifi while driving or shopping.  Our previous tools for that were either our cell phones (not as easy to see) or our laptops (too big and clunky for the car).  This tablet provides the perfect balance.Some downsides to the Y88 are the battery life and the availability of apps.  My favorite weather app is WeatherBug which is not available for this tablet.  Not sure if it\u2019s the tablet or WeatherBug that\u2019s at fault here, but I found a reasonable solution with Accuweather.  There were a few other apps that I looked into loading and they were not available, but I\u2019ve also found viable workarounds.  The battery issue is not unusual for tablets, so no major complaint here.  I\u2019ve dug up some eBay sourced micro-USB chargers from around the house and have plugged them in where I sit with my tablet around the house and just operate \u2018wired\u2019 as necessary.  Not that big a deal.  We do the same in the car until we need to go wireless.  Simple.Overall, this tablet met all my expectations.  Hope it does the same for you!", "Title": "Meets expectations; used daily.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Author": "Crunk Panda \"Crunk Panda\u2122\"", "ReviewID": "R3GUYUPHVQD7K0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My kids each received one for Christmas from their grandparents.

Doesn't seem to have any problems loading apps or playing applications.  HD display during movies, so far, that i can see.  Charges quickly and seems to hold good so far but may be because the screen is so poorly lit.  Good tablet for children as it is inexpensive if it gets broken.  Front and Rear cameras are an expensive addition in name brand tablets and included in this tabletConsI will compare this tablet to the kindle fire hd.  When I purchased it i looked for similar characteristics.  The 1280x600 hd display is what sold me and was expecting similar quality screen to kindle.  This tablets screen, i would be surprised if it was truly 1280x600 hd from a quality control stand point.  In the same note, the front/back cameras seem to take equal quality pictures, yet the back camera is rated at 4 times the picture quality.  The picture is maybe half the quality as a kindle fire hd.  This tablets picture seems to be recessed into the tablet so the pictures cannot be seen clearly except for straight on and is very low lit.  Frustrating for anyone who has used a kindle as there screen seems to display right at the surface and withvery viberant.  You will need to buy speakers of some kind for this tablet.  This tablet 85 compared to kindle fire hd with camera at 140 used or 200-225 new.  Save for the kindle unless youre like me and buying several for kids as that can get expensive. Dolby surround and precise picture at all angles is worth the extra 75 bucks and you will have to buy 20 bucks worth of speakers anyway.  Don't buy this if you are an adult.

I had to buy a micro SD card to download the file too, and then insert into the tablet and restart tablet.Well guess what. I couldn't get the tablet to start up.  So I got back in touch with the Tablet Express person and was given a different file. I could now start the tablet but it wouldn't update itself.  So I was told to ship the tablet back and they would fix it.  I wrapped it in bubble wrap and shipped it in. I received an email back saying the tablet screen was broken and that it wouldn't be warranty.  They asked me how it had gotten broke. Well during the time I was emailing back and forth I was sending them pictures of the screen that I was seeing. There was no breaks in the screen.

Yeah so I'm stuck with this tablet because I ordered it awhile back and it's passed the 30 day return period.

Video quality from Youtube on this thing is garbage, the sound isn't that loud even on max, the charger it comes with doesn't work.

When I saw the price of this tablet and all it had to offer it was hands down the best idea. I just knew my daughters would love having their own tablet with camera. This way they could Skype their grandmother, take pictures, and still have the reading capability of a nook.They have had the tablets for 3 months now and we had to return them due to freezing, low battery life, broken charger, inability to read the SD card, etc. Now that we have received the new one and still having some of the same problems.  Now I can't get in touch with the manufacturer to request assistance, not by phone or e-mail.
