But the ios is actually easier then windows once you know what your doing. And there is the rub. This comes with no instructions. But you do get 90 days help and can call in as many times as you want in that time frame. The service is great, real people that seem to be in California, no accents. As a befuddled \"oldster\" (but I did know windows very well) they gave me plenty of time and effort. Some things are so simple if you only knew, and reading on the \"book\" manual in the iPad's ibooks (free) can only get you so far. The touch is so responsive it took time to \"power down\" my finger compared to \"other\" touch products (my other brand smart/dumb phone, kindle fire, other people's tablets, etc.)Things to know, = makes very sure you get that 90 days service, once the box has been opened the clock starts. If you buy someone else's or a \"open box\" from some store, make sure you know how much time is left. If you are like me and didn't even know there was that service, or that I needed it, I would have been lost. Another thing is that dang password. I spent a lots of time on the phone with Apple help on this, and they kept passing me up to higher supervisors. I don't know why it was so hard, but I know I wouldn't have got \"in\" without that help. God help me if I ever forgot it.You hear fanboys and geeks talking about Apple products. Frankly, I'm just a plain retired person and I love it! A week after, it updates to ios6 with siri (sp? ipad corrects your spelling, very cool) I sure like that bonus.And yes, the Amazon Kindle app works well. I also can watch Amazon steaming movies. Oddly enough, there is no buffering or stalling on the ipad like it does on my laptop, or Kindle Fire. Odd because they are recv. the same DSL signal in my home.

Awesome, Awesome piece of technology and tool.Now for the long version.  I had an iPhone for two years before purchasing the iPad.  I had played around with my friends when the first one came out and thought it was a fun (expensive) toy great for surfing, playing music and games.When I got the chance to get one for myself finally, I honestly wasn't sure that I would use it.  I had been given the first gen Kindle Fire and thought the UI was s#@t!  Not to mention that the Android store was neutered and I wasn't able to download any app that I wanted because of the Amazon operating system that was on it.  So even after rooting the Kindle and installing the Android operating system I was even less thrilled about the tablet idea.  The touch technology between my iPhone and Kindle were significantly different.  That difference equated to annoyance when I couldn't get the Kindle to recognize the correct link I was trying to get without having to zoom in all the time.  The iPhone would figure out what letter I was picking on a page and get it right 98% of the time... unzoomed.  What I did like was the idea of being able to not have to have my laptop around all the time (which is 17inches of screen) and that I could use it as a reader.However, I didn't want to squander my work bonus on something that would sit on the kitchen counter next to the Kindle Fire because I had no use for it.  After researching what apps were available like iWorks, Flipbook,  Note Taker HD that would serve a utilitarian purpose for my job.  I went ahead and got the iPad.  I honestly can't remember being more stoked about Apple since my first experience on the Apple IIe as a kid learning basic and playing games.  This muthafkr goes EVERYWHERE with me now along with my iPhone in my back pocket LOL!!!The clarity, visual smoothness, quality of the metal... Steve and his team really out did themselves.  As a reader, there can occasionally be some glare as I've come across when reading outside.  For a true person wanting an eReader, I think one of the other Kindles would work (Kindle Fire had glare too).  However, very few come close to the experience of the iPad... and the total solution architecture experience that Apple has created for and around their products.It is art, design, and technology merged.", "Title": "BEST CREATIVE PRODUCT IN A LONG TIME!!!", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Author": "Royce", "ReviewID": "R2AVRVB8XICW97", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well let start this off by saying either you like Apple products or you don't.

Nikons' raw format, (NEF) or Jpeg images, both it seemed had  \"image clarity\" issues, I don't know if there was some sort of error downloading through iTunes or what happened, but 10 or 20% these ultra sharp & clear images, end up useless, when transferred to my iPad.

I was hoping to use my iPad 2 for 2 years and get the iPad 4. I decided to try the newest android tablet the Samsung note 10.1. I experienced many issues on it and in the end I missed the usability, reliability and apps of my iPad 2. I decided to get the iPad 3 and am very happy with it so far. It is more expensive and has less features than the Samsung note 10.  But it is still the best tablet on the market hands down. The iPad is really easy to use, has a huge app market for tablets, good support, good build quality, lots of accessories, retina display and air play.  When I first read about the iPad 3's retina display I thought it was a gimmick. After owning and using it I do see the difference with the screen. Since I spend a huge amount of time on my iPad 3 (mostly reading) it makes sense to get a better screen. They say it's suppose to be better on your eyes even if you have bad eye sleight. I also see the difference when watching videos or viewing pictures. In terms of speed I don't really notice the difference from my iPad 2. The extra ram is probably the main thing I've benefited from by getting the iPad 3. I do wish apple would improve the speakers on the iPad by making them stereo and not down facing. That's once thing I miss from the Samsung note 10. The samsung note 10 also had the ability to do real multitasking not the seudo stuff apple does. The note 10 could also run apps simultaneously side by side. These are things apple could do to improve their tablet even more. Although the iPad 3 is only slightly heavier and thicker than the iPad 2, I still notice the difference. I know that apple had to put a larger battery to power the higher resolution screen, LTE and processor.  I just think its unlike apple to release a product that is heavier, thicker and offers less battery life than it's predecessor. I haven't updated to iOS 6 yet as I heard it slows down the device, gets rid of YouTube/google maps and wifi issues. I am waiting for an update and also a jailbreak for ios 6. I am looking forward to Siri for the iPad 3, browser enhancements, email enhancements and Facebook integration. In the end apple won me over with air play since I own 2 apple tv 2's. No other tablet or mobile device anything like air play or as easy to use as AirPlay.Early November 2012 update: Well Apple screwed us iPad 3 owners by releasing a new iPad just 6 months after this one. The iPad 4 has a faster A6X chip, dual channel bonding wifi, a hd front camera and lightning connector. The new chip is suppose to make the iPad 4 twice as fast as the iPad 3. The dual channel bonding will make wifi connectivity twice as fast when connected to a n network support router. The lightning connector is suppose to charge the ipad 4 about 45 minutes quicker than the previous version. Personally I wanted an iPad that was thinner, lighter, had more ram and stereo speakers. Do yourself a favor dont buy the Ipad 4. Wait for the iPAd 5 which will most probably be thinner, lighter, stereo speakers and more ram and look like the ipad mini. In my case I was within 3 weeks. The apple store let me return mine for a full refund. I came home and placed an order for a iPad 3 refurb. I got my refurb wifi 64gb for only $550. Which is a great deal. I really dont know why Apple couldnt have waited a few more months for a newer version. Who knows maybe Apple will release a new iPAd in march or april again. The only reason to get an ipad 4 is if you do alot of gaming, photo editing or video editing otherwise your not really going to notice the difference or be worth your while.

However, very soon after buying MacBook Air and giving my iPad 1 away I realized that I really missed my iPad (another thing I thought would help me to deal without it was a 4.5 LG Spectrum Phone).I was concerned about the New iPad being a bit more bulky than iPad 2 and getting warm as some people complained. Waiting until a new version of iPad is released seemed like a good idea, but I decided to go for it and buy the New iPad anyways. No regrets: it is not bulkier than my older ipad 1, and even though I do feel the warmth on its back and wish it was not there, the high resolution screen makes up for it and would probably compensate for more problems if there were more ones.The iPad definitely has the niche of its own: as small as MacBook Air 11 is, it is not the same. New iPad has a way better screen, nicer form factor (for reading and for browsing), and does not get overheated as quickly (my MBA would turn its fan almost right away as I start watching a video on it).

This device joins my very first iPod and Kindle on my \"Why didn't I buy this sooner?\" list.When the iPad first came out, I knew I wanted one. I didn't know what I would use it for, I just knew that I wanted it. I loved my iPhone so why wouldn't I like this?I had no idea. The iPad changed everything. I am still amazed by all of the things I can do with it. Here the list of how I use my iPad on a daily basis:* Email - Obviously. I use it for both work and personal email, especially at home after work.* Web browsing - Naturally. The Safari browser (as well as the Google Chrome app) work great. As long as there is no Flash, it's as good as or better than using a computer.* Reading - The Kindle app looks amazing on the Retina screen. Plus, since I can sync what I'm reading between this, my iPhone, and my actual Kindle, it doesn't matter which device I have with me, I can always pick up exactly where I left off.* Magazines - I never read a ton of magazines before, but now the only ones I do read are in the Newsstand app. Just like with books, I've gone paperless here.* Comics - I'm not a huge comic fan, but there are many titles that I do like to read. The key there is \"read.\" I don't need to collect them anymore. They just take up too much space. I just want to read them and move on. Now that all of the major publishers have excellent digital versions of the comics (most released the same day as print) it was a no-brainer to go digital here. As soon as I got my iPad, I stopped buying paper comics and have been 100% digital ever since. That has also saved me money. Most digital comics are cheaper than print (some the day they are released, some a few weeks later). I'm usually so far behind in my reading that the price has dropped by the time I'm ready to buy the next issue. In just one year, I have saved almost half the cost of the iPad by waiting for comic prices to drop before I purchase. I can carry 100s of comics with me at any time. This is the future of the comic book industry.* Movies & TV shows - With Netflix and Amazon Prime, I can stream an endless number of TV shows and movies. Combine that with my own digital library of shows and movies and I never have a shortage of something to watch, no matter where I am. The best accessory for my iPad to watch movies is my hammock in the back yard. Can't be beat.* Sports - I'm a baseball fan so I use the MLB At Bat app to watch games of my favorite teams. (subscription required). The Watch ESPN app is great also.* Social media - Facebook, Twitter, etc. In many cases, their apps are better than the user interface you get in a web browser.* Shopping - The Amazon and eBay apps are way better than their standard web interface. The last few times I've sold something on eBay, I created the listing 100% on the iPad (including the photo).* Games - Everything from basic puzzle games, to social games, to platform-quality action games can be played on the iPad. I used to play more video games (consoles, PC, etc.) but don't have as much time for it anymore. Now if I have 10-15 minutes free, I can jump in and play some Modern Combat 4 no matter where I am.* Notes - Almost three years ago, I decided to go paperless with my notes at work. My handwriting was horrible and I can type faster than I write. I started using Evernote and haven't looked back (actually, I'm typing this in Evernote). I've learned that I can type pretty quickly on the iPad keyboard so that is all I take to meetings these days and I have access to all of my notes.* Connecting with friends/family - With Facetime and Skype, it's easier than ever to fire up a video chat.* Remote desktop - There are several apps that allow you to log in and remotely control your PC/Mac from the iPad. This means that you don't have to carry all of that with you.* All the rest... - Dropbox for file sharing. Countless games and TV shows for kids. Online banking. Pandora for some music (combined with a Jambox you get a lot of music and great sound). The list goes on.So there you go. If you aren't sure what you'd actually use an iPad for, hopefully this will help you see the potential. I used to sit with my laptop on my lap when hanging out at home.

As others have noted, it heats up - constant browsing for more than an hour makes it very warm. Charging is very sloooow. Mine takes about 5 hours to go from 20% to 100%. The charger that comes with the iPad is a higher wattage than other Apple chargers of the same shape - make sure you don't mix them up if you have an older one. Mine does not gain any charge if I plug it in while I am using it. Do not charge off USB to your computer, way too slow. There are third party chargers on the market with more wattage which you can buy and that will cut a few hours off recharging and I recommend that, but it's another $20-30.

His goal was to have me use it for college. It has definitely come in handy already and I am only a freshman. I bring it to class instead of my heavy computer, which, trust me, makes a huge difference when you are also carrying a lot of books. There are many uses of the Ipad 3 in a schooling aspect, and also some restrictions. I'll go into both in this review.I will start with the positives of the Ipad 3. First off, it is super lightweight. So if you are interested in carrying it a lot of places, it is a good option. It is small so it can fit in most bags or purses. I wouldn't write an essay on it, but when I need to look something up really quick in class or on campus, I have the option to. It is also good for taking quick notes on, or having something saved so you can show your professor.Something else that is really good about the Ipad 3 (which also goes for all apple products) is the choices of apps. I am taking a French class, which has an online textbook. However it uses Java, which most Ipad internet apps do not support. Through lots of questions and research, our teacher found out that there is an app that supports java. So now I can also access my french book from my iPad using \"Puffin\" internet browser. Other than that, safari and other internet apps are very useful, fast, and easy to use.The iPad 3 has a \"mail\" app that is used for your email. It will load the email straight to your iPad, so you can use the app instead of having to log in online. The best thing about this app is that you can load multiple emails to the app, so you can see all of your emails in one place. This might sound overwhelming, but you can sort them in a specific way. Say you have three emails linked to it, and you only want to see the new emails for two of them, you can select and unselect what email shows the unread messages. Something else that is good for school is \"math reference\" app.I am so glad I have the Ipad 3 because when I was in math class, and lost in the lecture, I could just open up math reference with my Ipad and get a quick answer. There are many helpful apps on the Ipad 3 that you can use for school, and a lot of them you can get for free, or for really cheap. One comes already on the Ipad 3, which is called \"iTunes U\". This is an app where you can download and save specifically education material. Such as books, courses, and educational videos. More and more now textbooks for certain courses are coming out with the \"kindle edition\" of their books. Which means if you have the Ipad, you can buy your textbook as a Kindle book and read it in the kindle app. This would make the books astronomically cheaper and of course, be much more convenient because they would all be in one place in a nice, lightweight iPad 3.The iPad 3 makes it very easy to change settings if necessary. All of the apps are easy to move around into the organization that you desire. They are easy to download, or delete. You can easily manipulate almost every aspect to your Ipad from the \"settings\" app. It is very clear, concise, and easy to use. Even for the technologically challenge. And even if you don't know how to fix something, you can just look it up online. There are tons of forums and Q&A; websites for apple products. There are also a lot of great shortcuts on the iPad 3 to get around easy. For example, the very left page is a search page. If you double click the home button a bar at the bottom shows up with your most previously visited pages. If the iPad is on lock, if you double click the home button, some options will appear for listening to music (if you already have music playing). If you click and hold the home button, you will have access to \"Siri\". If you click the home button and lock button at the same time, it will take a screenshot.Now for the negatives of the iPad 3. I have very little things to complain about with this product, but of course there are always a few inconveniences. One would be that sometimes the internet stops working. Most of the time it is just my campus internet failing, but sometimes its my iPad. Most of the time, just turning it off and back on will fix it right up. Very, very rarely my iPad will be slow or have apps quit unexpectedly on me. But again, this is very rare.Overall, the Ipad 3 was a great purchase. I use it everyday. I am still looking for my class books to be kindle editions so I can just download them to my iPad. I am sure more will start having kindle editions soon. It is such a great thing to have for my schooling, it is incredible how many things you can do on it to help your education.", "Title": "Overall, the Ipad 3 was a great purchase.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Author": "Uriel Galimidi", "ReviewID": "R3P51MYSFQ7LOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use my iPhone for news video clip, reading books and documents, and surfing the web.

The Kindle worked well enough for many of the reasons I bought it (and I absolutely love it as a book reader) but not for everything business-wise.I researched and read reviews for the iPad itself and the apps that I would need before I finally took the plunge and purchased it.  I chose the most memory with WiFi and Cellular coverage because it is primarily a business tool for me.  I need the memory for photos and videos and the cellular coverage so that I can access files and contracts.  It's important to me that I can conduct a complete real estate transaction wherever my clients or I happen to be.Even if you are purchasing primarily as a personal device, you may still want the 64GB version if you store a lot of music as well as photos / video.One of the things I was not able to get conclusive info on before I purchased was whether or not I would have to activate cellular coverage immediately.  The answer is no.  You can do it whenever you want.  I chose to wait until my next billing cycle started just because it was easier to read the bill without the pro-rations.I was a little hesitant about buying it from Amazon instead of from Apple or my phone carrier, but that turned out to be a misplaced concern.

Hinton", "ReviewID": "R2IKLSS535J07U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The reason I decided to write anything here at all is the listed price of the 32Gb model.Wow just wow....  $629 for a $600 item.... Apple iPad MC706LL/A (32GB, Wi-Fi, Black) Price: $629.08 & this item ships for FREE with Super Saver Shipping.I guess Amazon has now come full circle charging more than MSRP for an item that is readily available everywhere for MSRP or lower.Even at the the Apple Store (iPad with Wi-Fi 32GB - Black 3rd generation $599.00 In Stock Free Shipping).What a deal for unsuspecting Amazon shoppers.Since I am here I may as well put some very random thoughts about the machine into the user reviews.We had an iPad2 (16Gb wifi) for about a month, it was bought so my wife could take it on a trip. Since we did not know if she would really like a tablet or not we went with the lowest price model.  Well as it turns out her fingers became permanently glued to the device. The iPad3 came out very shortly after we had bought the iPad2 so we sold the iPad2 to a family member and bought a iPad3 (wifi 64Gb) model.Other than my Galaxy II phone I/we have no other experience with tablets or smart phones.  I have used the iPad a little and the phone a lot.I am pretty middle of the road when it comes to the iOS / Android battle. Each has good points and bad points.  I think the Android will always suffer some of the same type issues as Windows due to the multitude of hardware configurations it is deployed on.The one thing I was greatly concerned about with the iPad was the lack of Flash support, but as it turns out the only website I have noticed the lack of Flash being a problem is here at Amazon.In the music section the Amazon music preview player is Flash based so I cannot listen to the sample clips when browsing CDs.  I am sure there are plenty of other sites that will give errors but we don't visit them so we are not greatly affected by the Flash 'issue'.Of course if the websites you like are Flash driven this will be a major issue you should consider before buying this machine.As far as I can tell the best trick the iPad3 has over the competition is the retina display; the text on the new iPad is considerably sharper than the iPad2 (big deal for me, not so much for my wife) and only a couple of the premium Android tablets are in this fight.Any tablet I decide to get for myself has to have text that is on par with what the retina display produces.  So my list of tablets is pretty short.When it comes to the rest of the hardware the review sites give the A5 processor a slight edge over the Tegra 3 processor, but for my use I am confident either processor is more than adequate.If you like action games I would specifically seek out performance reviews of the particular game you want to play before committing to any specific machine.The iPad3's cameras do a really good job for Facetime and video recording. Picture taking is somewhat lacking and from the reviews I have read this is a common knock I see on all the embedded cameras on phones and tablets. The 8mp camera in my Galaxy SII does not take as good of pictures as my old 4mp Kodak camera so I have good reason to believe the negative reviews of the cameras on the various tablets are accurate.The one thing I really don't understand is Apple's omission of some variety of SD slot (and on a top of the line machine in 2012 it needs to be a SDXC slot) on the iPad.Even the 64Gb model is really limited on storage space if you want to put a music library on it.  I don't even think my music collection is all that big and I have over 60Gb in high quality MP3 files.If the iPad had a SDXC slot I would not hesitate to buy one for myself. As it is if one of the premium Android machines adds it in the next refresh that will probably tip the scale for me to go that route simply for the storage capability.Build quality is outstanding on the iPad3, not sure what more could be asked for.The native apps that Apple has particularly right are Facetime and the music player.Even though I am unsure about the whole iTunes thingy (my wife has it on her computer, but I don't have it on mine) once the music is loaded on the machine it is functionally the best music player I have ever used.Facetime simply works; too bad it is a closed system for Apple only (the rest of my family that I would like to do video chat with use some variety of iPhone, iPad, iTouch, iMac). I have used Skype and it has done the job, but it does not work as good as the Facetime.Since the listed price of this machine is what prompted me to write anything I might as well comment on the price vs the competition, if you want to compare a budget Android tablet to the iPad3 there is nothing anyone can say that will affect you. Apple does not compete in the budget machine market.But if you do a more direct comparison of top of the line machines there is not really that much price difference (yeah I know $100 is $100 but $600 for a ASUS TF700T 64Gb model vs $700 for iPad3 64Gb model seems pretty close to me when any head to head review by an unbiased source gives the overall winning nod to the iPad).", "Title": "Why is the 32Gb more than MSRP ????", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Author": "OLE LADY MEL", "ReviewID": "R2F67F526IC6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY NEPHEW, WHO GAVE ME HOPE WHEN I NEEDED IT.

I will sum all of the good into a nutshell and say that the iPad is everything Apple advertised it to be, and then some. The Retina is awesome, the camera is great, 4G LTE is quick, and gaming is brilliant. With the addition of Siri in iOS 6, this device is a good internal leap from the iPad 2.But here are my couple of flaws. The first is that the battery takes about 6 or 7 hours to charge. Basically you have to just charge it at night, then get 10 hours of use for the day, charge it at night..... Not too bad. My next critique is that the back heats up a bit. Its not painful or anything, but it can be a bit irritating. I would reccomend a case to solve this. Another issue us that the microphone is apparently in the dock connector. So if you want to make a facetime call while charging, or your hand is over the port while filming, the sound is muffled. My final problem is that the facetime camera is pretty awful. I guess it's usable, but even in great light it looks pretty grainy.As a whole I would reccomend the new iPad to everyone and anyone. While to the novice, it may appear the same as the iPad 2, it is surely a good, well rounded, fundamental update.", "Title": "Superb iPad", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Author": "Randomly", "ReviewID": "R2AMQ4QUUZYD82", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The new ipad is very good for one job, browsing the web: reading online news, books, searching various information. Typing is pretty good, but I did not try to do work on it. The spell auto-correct function is sometimes annoying. Some programs simply don't work on it. It is much faster than the Kindle fire. I find the camera 1) not so useful 2) possibly less good than in the iphone 4. It connects to a wi-fi network flawlessly.This being said, the casing is slippery and one has to buy a protective case. Once this is done, which is inevitable if you really want to make sure an accidental slip would not wreck your ipad, the options are restricted to hefty cases (I have the Otterbox Defender). At this point your device morphed into a heavy, bulky  not so elegant netbook without a lid. Add a screen protector (included) and the once superb display is just grainy but yes, extremely responsive. It is of course an extremely fast, responsive tablet, about the right size and worth 4 stars. However, not five, as it costs way too much compared to a laptop.A word of caution about 4G: I decided to pay more to have this feature, motivated in part by the new sharing plans from At&t; (which I did not sign up for yet) and the unreliability of cable internet providers in my area. 4G (LTE) does not really work everywhere on the At&t; coverage map. My iphone works perfectly on 3G but 4G is dead in my house. It is not clear to me if I can force the ipad to use the 3G network, but my first impression, from admittedly superficial research, is that a locked device would not accept it.The ipad is good, but not a necessity. Purists may disagree with a comparison to the iphone 4 (in my case). But the iphone does everything the ipad does; its form factor makes it amazing, versatile and indispensable.

The iPad really just feels \"off\" - like it's missing something.  The OS isn't customizable, and we really miss a back button like on Android.  Not all of the apps have buttons in the same places and very little consistency, so it was a bit of annoyance just using it for daily use.If we needed this for daily/entertainment use, I would probably return it.  As it turns out, I'm a pilot and use it for Foreflight/Stratus.  For that purpose it's fantastic, but that's because Foreflight is awesome, and could be just as awesome on Android.  So the iPad doesn't deserve all the credit - but maybe some.My girlfriend loaded her Danish newspaper website, and it didn't display well at all, everything was a mess and all the flash elements were obviously broken.  The same site loads perfectly, flash and all, on the Transformer tablet.This is my first experience with iOS and it just feels really dumbed down and overly simplistic, but in a bad way.  Missing flash is a very real problem and I kind of think anyone honest with themselves would freely admit that Android is far superior at this time.The battery life is fantastic and will last for a couple days of flying without a recharge, that's a big bonus.  The screen is quite nice though the benefits with the retina display just aren't all that noticeable in the real world.  Does it look nice?  Totally.The iPad is a very well polished device, but it's trying too hard to be simplistic to the point where it becomes more of a toy for a 5 year old child than a device for an adult.  I highly recommend Android over the iPad, and for me, I prefer my Win 7 Slate - I need a real OS.", "Title": "It's just ok", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Author": "C.

I'm just going to give a quick overview of the ipad 3 vs the ipad 2.iPad 3 Advantages:  Clearer graphic and stunning text, much better camera and video recordingiPad 3 The Bads:  Way heavier compare to the ipad 2, a lot warmer in temperature, takes a lot longer to charge, speed is not faster like advertised,  Video Quality is not better (Screen makes videos worse)After owning both, I would not recommend iPad 2 owners to upgrade to the new ipad, unless you like reading a lot. The text on the new ipad is incredible. I love reading on the new ipad.Update 5/31/12:  Charging time is a pain.  It takes way too long to charge.  Beware if you use the ipad a lot.  For people that don't use it too much then I don't see any problems.

Yeah, Apple already has them at premium price, but usually it's worth it.  However, Apple doesn't price gouge even when there is huge demand.  Why does Amazon feel they need to add to the already high price?  It's not like they put any technology into them.  Obviously it's to make more money from us, the loyal customer.  If you saw an 32 GB iPad 4 priced at $690 in a store you'd walk out and go into an Apple store and get it for $90 cheaper.  You could also get it online from Apple for the true price.  Also, why is the white iPad cheaper than the black iPad?  They're the exact same product, just different color.  Oh, more people want the black one, so Amazon is going to profit more from that.  Shame on Amazon for jacking up the price of an item that people want...in the name of greed.", "Title": "price gouge", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Author": "Debbie C", "ReviewID": "R140IS34TH9VIU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Don't by a Verizon iPad unless you are able to get a Verizon \"local\" number if you want to use their prepaid monthly data plans plans.

I was told a Verizon phone number has to be attached to the account. The only option they gave me was a postpaid contract plan with activation fee on top of a monthly fee for an amount of data I would never come close to using up.
