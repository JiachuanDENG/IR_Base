They sent a new charger in good time, and kept their ears open for a result. The unfortunate problem is that the new charger did not fix the problem, however I am confident their Customer Support will fix the issue. It seems more people are popping up with a similar issue with charging, so I may assume the battery board is indeed the culprit.For now I will give four stars.", "Title": "The Latte ICE Tab2 is Excellent for the most.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Author": "M. Nosir \"Ms. N\"", "ReviewID": "R6J3DB7TF9HDB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The specs sounded great and so I bought it.  It even looks like a good tablet with the nice metal casing.  However, it turns off randomly and will not restart even if the reset button is pushed.  The only way to get it to turn back on is to plug it in to the charger even though the battery has plenty of charge left and may even be full when this occurs.  I called  Latte tech support and I am still waiting for them to call me back.  I am very disappointed and will be sending this back.  I may get an Ipad mini next time because I don't know if I  can trust another Android tablet.  I don't know what is a good brand to get to avoid the hassle.", "Title": "Turns off  while playing games like angry birds.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Author": "Steve Choi", "ReviewID": "RB3TOF7XWGOEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was very nice and sleek design tablet.

I've now bought 3 of the 7\" Latte Ice tablets and paid anywhere from $123 to $135.  Basically the white version looks like an Apple 7\" clone sort of though is inferior to the Apple Mini in hardware specs..  The IPS screen looks great, like a higher end cell phone.  It has all the standard stuff though does lack an HDMI slot.  I compared it to a 7\" Dragon Touch tablet and both brought up and played youtube video's at about the same time though with the IPS screen the video was much sharper and colors more accurate.  The front speaker provides decent sound though none of the tablets have that great of sound that I've heard.Note - I ordered a couple more of the 7\" version since my initial review and the last one I received came with two plastic screen covers and a nice case that doubled as a stand for displaying the tablet on a flat surface.  It must of been a Christmas special cause I didn't specifically order these items but was happy to receive them.  Or maybe they just were rewarding my repeat business :)1/23/14 - I'm unable to get any of 3 different bluetooth mice to connect and work reliably on two different tablets.  Revising to three stars until this is resolved.3/7/14 - Revising to ONE STAR as there is 0 product support.  I requested help with the Bluetooth issue twice through Lattezone and once through here regarding the Bluetooth problem and did not receive so much as an email except the automated email right after I generated a support ticket.  If you buy and have a problem there is no help, do not recommend purchasing from Lattezone.", "Title": "Nice looking screen, but bluetooth doesn't work & no support from Lattezone.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "Mike Park", "ReviewID": "R1K9VOIVFONHNM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Look.  I read some of the bad reviews but decided to still try due to the low price.  I can honestly say this tablet has exceeded my expectations.  I own quite a few china tablets (ramos w30, hyundai T7, etc).  Performance is very snappy and the screen is quite lovely.  The battery life is very impressive (over 8 hours of HD movies) on a single charge.  Some people (reviewers) just ask for too much.  A great tablet for a little over 100 bucks.  I am impressed.  This has become my main tablet now.M", "Title": "Very satisfied", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Author": "Jackie L.", "ReviewID": "RTL6HMVUY5MBD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The I-muz Q9 is my first tablet. I've had mine since 01/2014. Comparing \"apples to I-muz,\" this android rocks. Great antutu score, and beautiful display. Some orientation bugs, but this can be somewhat corrected in settings>>accessibility and remove the check mark next to auto-rotate screen. Not a perfect fix, but it helps. You can change it back at any time you wish. I have rooted mine and I love the freedom to change and tweak settings. Something that is hard to accomplish on a \"branded\" tablet. It appears that www.lattezone.com has all but abandoned its customers, which is really disappointing. Some information can be gleaned from www.i-muz.com and www.rock-chips.com. With a minimal amount of effort, you can turn this tablet into a customized fun machine. The physical build seems well thought out. I like the covered ports, although the ports themselves, are a bit flimsy. If you handle them with a modest amount of care, they should last throughout the tablet's useful life. The case and buttons seems sturdy enough. The cameras are not the best in the world, but they suffice. One thing I would like to see more of are accessories for the Q9. For the money, I believe this is a great starter tablet, as well as a good daily user. I hope this helps to ease the minds of those who may be, \"on the fence\" about buying this tablet.", "Title": "Super-good tablet, but not quite great", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Author": "Lastredwitch", "ReviewID": "R14WTUBSGXNYZ1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": ":: Beware!!! LatteZone folks DO NOT Answer their support phone number! DO NOT follow up or answer their own service 'Ticket System'! DO NOT follow up on their own email! DO NOT have standard or complete Android Builds on their tablet so you cannot use several features or even properly \"Self' support!I spent almost an hour on robo-hold; they never did pickup! I opened 2 \"tickets\" on Latte Support, opened 2 contact emails at iMUZ's web site, even tried calling iMUZ Korea (robo-hold in Korean), sent a email to Latte's @support... Finally an email response from Latte saying they'd dropbox my fix and get back to me. That was three WEEKS ago... STILL NO RESPONSE OR FIX!! -Sent another today -These options are actually DISABLED in build property and jar manifest files; which you can read but not change!. ... also Owners manual shows all the following but they are missing on the tablet!  Display: Missing wireless display controls  Missing HDMI enable, zoom, timeout  Developer options Missing Completely in menus and recovery!  No usb debug, no way to access app data on system partition - So NO WAY TO FULLY BACK UP TABLET IN ANY WAY!USB - PC hardware driver device id damaged corrupt?- No drivers available anywhere for PC PhoenixSuit or other usb ADB  access.- Missing system info:  No serial number, no product name for Google Market update of System apks- No way to mount extSD as directory of built in SDcard because permissions and setups are wrong on built-in SDcard configurationsI've also searched many of the forums for a stock build for this tablet No Luck! I've found several 'close' builds but I'm unwilling to try.
