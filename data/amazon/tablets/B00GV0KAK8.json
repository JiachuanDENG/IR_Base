Later that day, the one without sound began to crash to a white screen. The other one operated ok, but would lock up running only 1 app (Bad Piggies). I sent the soundless one in for return and bought another hoping it was an anomaly. The replacement worked for 1 week. It then began having a nervous breakdown, deciding randomly to shut down or refusing to power on. The remaining original tablet began having problems at this time, failing to charge or refusing to power on. I returned both tablets for a refund and will not be buying replacements.I don't expect a lot at this price point, but I do expect minimal functionality. The build quality on these units is very poor. The charging port is loose, the plastic molding has ridges and rough spots. The screen has inconsistent quality and very poor color rendering.
