The speed of the tablet is faster than my Acer A100.The tablet does have full access to the Google Play store and I have not found any app that isn't compatible yet.Android 4.2 is a powerful OS and the tablet it's self as far as the hardware is a solid buy at 60$.I have had zero complaints. Down loaded several games. They have played well. No issues.This tablet is light. My kids love it. It has exceeded my expectations.I would recommend  it to anyone who is looking to purchase a nice tablet.", "Title": "great item", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Author": "L.

It is very fast & has a lot of apps...now I only wanted it for email, Facebook & Netflix but I am able to do a lot more. The only drawback so far is that the battery doesn't last very long but it does charge real fast. If you are looking for a small tablet just to do the basics and still have some fun this is it.", "Title": "Great Tablet for a Great Price!", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Author": "Loretta Griner \"Lolly\"", "ReviewID": "R2M2EP55IEVP91", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet is just what I wanted and it was delivered quicker than any other merchant could do.

The OS, like any OEM installed OS needed some tweaking but that's normal. The installed file manager is function-free. Unlike most Unix clones, connecting to the www is quick and painless.
