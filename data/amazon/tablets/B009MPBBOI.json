About three weeks ago I had to return it again . . . this time it would charge the battery only intermittently. I've sent four emails now and have had no reply. I emailed the Sales & Support departments and never received a reply. I don't think anyone really works there. Never found a phone number, only email which apparently is set up with a filter to auto delete the email.At this point, I don't care if I ever see my media player again. I just want the satisfaction of letting any of their potential customers know that they're most likely throwing their money away once they purchase one of these products.

Maybe this will help anyone that actually buys it:1) if the screen doesn't stay on when you get and you're first charging it --> just let it charge past 20%, it should start working again after that (assuming it's not broken).2) The wi-fi won't turn on --> oddly enough, I just left it off for a few hours and it magically started working again... not sure what to say on this issue?3) Touch screen not responsive --> means you've left it plugged in for too long, the tablet is overheating. If it's still not good after it cools off, try calibrating it with a free application from a simple google search maybe?4) Battery lifespan --> just remember to kill apps running in the background you no longer need running, lower brightness, and get an app that lets your tablet go into deep sleep (drastically reduces power usage when idle).5) Don't buy this unless it's on sale... I realize it's cheap for a tablet, but the cheapness really makes it... well, cheap. It does run everything just fine if you're careful and maybe tweak it a bit.6) I've only tested a couple 3D games on this device, but the ones I tested ran just fine. browsing the internet was a bigger memory hog than the games (GPU vs RAM and all that junk). Anyways, for faster browsing get an app like opera mobile that uses compression... doesn't have to be opera, just an app designed with tablets in mind for browsing.7) buy an SD card if you plan on watching movies, listening to music, playing games on emulators, etc, etc. (this only applies if you plan on watching multiple movies and stuff).", "Title": "It's only going downhill from here", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "Nick Mitchell", "ReviewID": "RK89SZ5W9MS8B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This item was purchased for a Christmas present.  It was opened and checked prior to putting it away.  Everything appeared to work at that time.  After Christmas, I discovered that the battery will not hold a charge.  I emailed the manufacturer asking about the warranty twice, but have never received a response from them.  As it is, it is worthless as the battery charge only lasts 5-10 seconds once it is unplugged!  I think that it is a piece of junk and hardly worth the $100 price tag that I paid for it!  There isn't a phone number to contact customer support, only the email address that gets no response!  I definitely regret the purchase and would not buy anything from this company ever again!

But it functions very slowly, especially in comparison to similar products. It holds a lot of songs which was my one of the main reasons I decided to buy it. That, its size and the fact it is an android. Unfortunetely as soon as I started using it I regretted my decision. Not only is it slow to react, but shortly after downloading songs and messing around with it it started malfunctioning or maybe it was just being slow again... whichever it was I couldn't get it to turn on for almost a half hour.

Here are some things I love about it. I have Kindle loaded on it (which is what I probably use the most) and it works great. I can read at night or without a bright light so I really love that. Easy to navigate. The touch screen responds well. I noticed some other posts about incorrect tapping. I have not found that to be the case for me. The picture is clear and crisp. Plays movies back well without hesitation. There are plenty of apps that do work great on it. There are some that do not but that is to be expected. I like that I can lock it with a pin number so if someone picks it up, they can't charge my amazon account all over creation. It is a perfect size for me. I can put it in my purse and take it with me wherever. That is a BIG PLUS. It is built well and is sturdy and looks cool. It was very easy to setup and get going out of the box.  Here are some things not so great about it. The speaker is not loud enough. I have to either have a headset or plug in external speakers to be able to listen to music or watch a movie. There is a storybook app I have downloaded for my daughter. With the volume pegged out you can still barely hear it. That is a bit disappointing. It is not good for surfing the internet. It loads very slow and is not really worth the frustration. If you absolutely need something from the internet it can get the job done but, it is super slow and is not enjoyable at all. Don't get this if one of your primary purposes is to surf the web. Some apps don't work on it. The battery life is a little shorter than I would hope. Most of the battery drainage is due to \"cell radio standby\". I am not well versed in these things but it seems it is looking for phone signal. On average, 77% of my battery usage is for that. It seems to be looking for cell service that it obviously is not going to get. If anyone has any ideas about that please share. I would like to remedy that and I have not been able to find any info about it.All in all I like it. It suits my personal needs well.

I was expecting a decent tablet based on the product description and customer reviews, but I was very disappointed. Some flaws with the tablet...1) Screen is not clear...very grainy and not much color to it.2) Screen is not very responsive. For example, if you hit a selection, it doesn't register until you hit it a few more times.3) Speaker on the device is terrible.  With the volume all the way up, you can barely hear a thing.4) SD card option not that great either.  I inserted a SD card and could not get my files to run.  This option is definitely not user friendly at all.5) Battery life is terrible.  I played with it when it was fully charged and about one hour later, the battery was already half drained!Had I known all this came with the product, I would never have ordered it.  Good thing with Amazon's great return policy, I am able to return this thing.  I am returning this (after having it for one day) and will be getting a more reputable tablet.

Knight \"Efrin Knight\"", "ReviewID": "R156X1FNFYG8GL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the past couple of years I've been dreaming of a pocket size Internet tablet in order to replace my outstanding but aging HP 2415 PDA.So far, LATTE folks seem to be the only manufacturer smart enough to put in the market a 5 inch Internet tablet that is more than a simple MP3 music player!When I saw this five inches machine with Android 2.3, Android market, USB and HDMI connections (BUT NO Bluetooth, NO Adobe 10.1 flash and NO GPS), I thought this would be the replacement that I had been yearning for.  Unfortunately, it is NOT!Maybe I was unlucky and it's my machine that was defective but here are the lacks and issues that I encountered after two weeks of very moderate use.1) LOOOONG TO TURN ON (800 MHZ).  Unlike my good old PDA, which turns on in a fraction of a second as soon as I hit the button, the Latte Ice Smart needs MORE THAN TWO MINUTES before you can reach the home page.  When you turn it on, it takes more than a minute before you see a first screen with a big clock and 2 messages (\"No service\") and a brief message on the toolbar saying: \"Preparing Nand memory\", followed later by another one that says \"Scanning SD memory\".  At this point, you press the \"menu\" key and wait another minute to see the home page which otherwise will never open!  Now you can open your files except video.As for the video, it won't even open the \"Gallery\" until it has scanned the micro SD card containing all photos and videos.  This will take another 90 seconds or so.  That's AT LEAST THREE MINUTES AND THIRTY SECONDS TO OPEN THE GALLERY from the time you turned on the machine.  As long as you see a wheel turning in the toolbar, it won't open it.  Once it has scanned your card, you may open the Gallery but then you have to wait one more minute until it \"loads\" your files.  You are now almost FIVE MINUTES since turn on!2) NO INFRARED, NO BLUETOOTH.  This means that you can't use portable keyboards like the excellent PALM Infrared folding device, which is a full keyboard when open but folds down to only 3 1/2 by 5 1/4 inches and therefore fits in your pocket!  I bought a USB IR key from Tiger store on Flagler Street that I hooked to the OTG cable but it didn't work either.NEITHER will it take a BLUETOOTH folding keyboard similar to my IR from Palm, even if you buy a USB Bluetooth key as I did from Amazon.  The manufacturer sent me an e-mail clearly saying:  \"Our device doesn't support IR. So it will not work with IR keyboard nor Bluetooth keyboard. It will only work with regular 2.4 Ghz wireless keyboards which have wireless adapter (which will connect to OTG)\"The only problem is that those who make 2.4 Ghz keyboards are NOT smart enough to make a full keyboard that folds into 3.5 by 5.25 inches like the Palm IR, so that you can put it in your pocket!  They are all huge desk keyboards!  Please gentlemen!  How about putting your brains to work?  Try a fish diet; sometimes it helps!You can therefore only use a USB keyboard BUT the smallest I found is 5.5 by 9 inches, made for 7 inches tablets and therefore won't fit in your pocket.3) AVERAGE BATTERY ~ I ran TWO BATTERY TESTS:First, for music.  With Wi-Fi and screen off, it ran continuously during nine hours before turning off at 10%, which is not so much: all my Chopin and Lily Laskine CDs went through.  That's slightly more than my HP PDA, which uses 9% of power per hour of music when I walk along the beach listening to Nana Mouskouri or Sarah Brightman with the PDA in my pocket.  That's with a Compact Flash 32 Gb card.  If I use a Seagate or a Hitachi microdrive, which is the size of a CF card type II, then my PDA uses more power (about 12% per hour)Secondly, I ran a test with video concerts.  I could see the first two concerts of Celtic Woman (3 hours for both) plus the first part of Andre Rieu in Tuscany.  Grand total was almost four hours, which is not so much either.4) Finally, I had PROBLEMS WITH VIDEO PLAYING after ten days of very sporadic use.First, I could only hear the sound but there was no image.  The screen showed all my DVD files but as soon as I pressed on one of them the screen suddenly became black and I could only hear the sound.I ran a reset by inserting a paper clip in a little hole next to the micro SD card and it worked again.But then the film stopped after a few minutes (with a full battery) and I had to turn it on again.  After it happened three times, I requested an RMA from Amazon, which sent me the label to return it for free, as usual.Amazon's outstanding returning policy makes me buy more and more from them.  I started with a few DVD orders the first year and now I have placed more than sixty orders in eleven months.  HONESTY PAYS!Maybe I had a defective device?  I don't know but I didn't want to take any chances and requested a refund from Amazon, which I usually get in a couple of days, unlike some Marketplace merchants who need ten days after they receive the merchandise!GOOD POINTS: I deeply regret these lacks and failures of the Latte Ice Smart 5 because, although slow and imperfect, I loved this little machine a lot due to the size, small enough to fit in a shirt pocket.  Furthermore, unlike my Archos 604 and other machines, which don't read the real thing unless you convert it to AVI, it reads both MPEG 2 AND MPEG 4 files.  See more about this in my Skypad review.On the other hand, it has a USB + an HDMI ports, which is very convenient because you may hook a second memory SD or USB jumpdrive (works like the Skypad Alpha for which I detailed the mechanism) and also allows you to watch your videos on a big TV, although I have never seen a hotel TV with HDMI yet.  Maybe they do have it at the Sheraton but since I'm a simple professor working almost for free, that's not the kind of place where I usually go...  I'm already happy enough when I find a composite connection in my usual budget hotels over three continents!After I returned this machine, I discovered and purchased a SAMSUNG GALAXY 5\" MP3 MEDIA PLAYER that has Android 2.3, Bluetooth (therefore possible folding Bluetooth keyboard) and GPS BUT NO HDMI or any possibility to see a video on a big screen.  I hoped I could use my Archos 604 cable that plugs into the headphone input with a composite connection at the other end but it didn't work. I took it on my trip to Montevideo for Thanksgiving weekend and I am quite happy so far.  I'll write a detailed review in January, after I will take it on my trip to Paris next week, then again to Montevideo at the end of December.", "Title": "Fits in a shirt pocket but DECEIVING", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Author": "Abdul Purnell Askew SR", "ReviewID": "R22HDVCFXN9DZL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this tablet.
