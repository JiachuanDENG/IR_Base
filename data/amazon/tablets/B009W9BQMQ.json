{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Student", "ReviewID": "R2EBIZ57N5JG0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is amazing.  It's not perfect, but considering that I'll have it for at least 2 years and I've used it every day so far, I certainly get my $.40 worth each day!  It's very sturdy and I know it will hold up well, as my other Apple products have.  I have friends who still use their original iPads (they work just fine, but many applications don't run on the operating system).  I have a Kindle (an old version), and still love my Kindle as a reader. It's the only way I can read in the sunlight and it's SO lightweight. Eventually, I'll upgrade to a new Kindle reader, but I see them as having different purposes. The iPad is a mini computer, and the non-Fire Kindle is the equivalent of carrying around a book (or a thousand).iPad 3 vs. iPad 4:I purchased the version right before this one--the iPad 3--several weeks before the announcement of this version.  I called Apple a few days after the announcement, and they immediately set me up with a way to return the iPad 3 to repurchase the newest version.  I realize that some people were angry about the announcement, but there has to be a cut off date for new technology at some point, and I thought that Apple treated me as well or better than I've seen from any other technology company.Yes, both the iPad 3 and 4 have very crisp, clear screens (which are stunning for video quality compared to my Macbook from 2010).  However, the increased speed of the iPad 4 makes the video quality seem clearer. It's difficult to explain, but movies definitely got a bit crisper. Also, the increased speed really is incredible when opening apps and running a lot at once.  I'd say the time it takes to open large applications is cut in half. But, I was so impressed with the iPad 3 when it came, and if I hadn't been able to exchange it, I would still give it a 5-star review--it's definitely not \"obsolete.\"Finally, what makes the iPad special? First, no one *needs* one. But now that I have one, it's sure useful and I wouldn't want to go back to life before I got one. Here's why:* I sit at school or at work in front of a computer all day.  I am always typing or reading on the screen. Coming come to something different is nice--it's refreshing. I'd rather watch a tv show on a 10\" iPad than any other non-TV device (laptop, tablet, phone, etc.).  The picture quality is great for movies and browsing, and the 10\" screen is big enough to share if a friend and I want to watch something together. A 7\" isn't enough for that or big enough to basically serve as a TV replacement.* It is functional enough to REPLACE a computer. Don't get me wrong, I still need my computer for editing files, serious typing, spreadsheets, etc. But right after I got the ipad, I went on a 10-day trip. No computer, no problem. I could take care of all of my emails from work and school, keep in touch, keep up with my finances, etc. It was anything I'd need for a non-work trip. Web browsing works just as well as a laptop for 95% of sites, and there's an app for many that even improves the browsing experience.* Given the first two points, I think owning an iPad will greatly extend the life of my laptop. I probably use my laptop 50% less now that I have an iPad, so I'll probably get an extra year of life out of my laptop as a result. That, in itself, makes the purchase of an iPad worth it in my eyes.* Integration with other Mac devices. This doesn't apply to everyone, but if you're a Mac user for a laptop or an iPhone, I'd highly recommend the iPad over alternatives, even if it's more expensive. If you're hooked on Windows products or Google products, I'd consider those devices.* The number of apps. I know that apps are everywhere these days, but, it seems at least, that there are still the most applications for Apple devices. The difference is especially noticeable in non-retail applications. For example, I've tried dozens of \"to do\" and organizer apps, and my favorite, Errands, is only available on iOS. Another of my favorites, Fotopedia Heritage (a gorgeous display of UNESCO World Heritage photography), is only on iPad. So far (and this may change), a lot of companies also choose to release new iOS versions of applications first. This edge will decrease with time, but for now it is still a significant \"plus\" for an iPad over other tablets for those who are into applications. Also, I can run most iPhone apps on the iPad, and there's an easy way to tell the difference (e.g. you can search just for iPad apps or for iPhone/iPad/iPod apps). Not sure if you can do this on other tablets, but I've found it useful (e.g. my bank only has an iphone app, but I can still run it on my iPad). Finally, though, just to be clear, this is NOT just a device for running applications. I could do almost everything I choose to do through applications just by using a web browser.* The number of accessories. Many won't care about this, but some will.  If you like to have cases to protect your electronics, the sheer number for iPad is a draw (not a huge one, but the sprinkles on the cake). Everything's out there, from cheap plastic covers to the smart cover (the one that folds as a stand) to professional-looking leather folios to designer soft zip cases. It can be a fashion statement, but it's more likely just a way to make sure to keep your device safe.* Finally, and this may be petty, but it's the most professional device.  In the field I know (law), partners at law firms and federal judges use iPads, not other devices to read briefs, send emails, etc.  I've never seen anyone doing work on a Kindle device and I've never even seen another tablet in a professional setting.  Part of this may be that it's a well-established product, and part may be that the 10-inch screen is nice for reading, even if it's bulkier. Being able to feel comfortable that you can carry your device in a professional environment may matter for some, and the iPad definitely delivers above other devices there.", "Title": "Great Multipurpose Tablet", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Author": "Bigz \"BIGz\"", "ReviewID": "RM1Y65IQTWOX5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 8in Apple iPad Mini was eagerly anticipated, but the new 10in iPad 4 (or iPad with Retina Display as Apple insists on calling it) is a surprise as it arrives only nine months after its predecessor the iPad 3.Externally, the iPad 4 looks and feels identical to its predecessor. Although it is sturdy and slim, it's still the same weight at around 650g. I had hoped for a reduction in weight since the iPad 3 was around 50g heavier than the iPad 2. The battery lasted 12 hours when I was playing videos matching the time achieved by the smaller iPad Mini.The 10in screen still has the same 2,048x1,536 pixel resolution. It's very sharp and bright with exceptional image quality, especially when compared to lower resolution tablets like the iPad Mini. Only the upcoming Samsung Nexus 10 Android tablet will have a display potentially capable of matching it.All the changes are on the inside rather than the outside. The A6X dual-core processor is twice as fast as the iPad 3's A5X chip, but this will make little real difference until apps are designed to take advantage of it. Apple will doubtless release features in future versions of iOS that will only run on the A6X, but that has yet to happen.The iPad 4 is thankfully compatible with the recently launched EE LTE network.HD FacetimeI was pleased with Video chatting and that the front-facing camera now records in 720p resolution which gave better, more accurate-looking video although the speed of my broadband connection did also affect image quality.The iPad 4 may be a modest upgrade over its predecessor but it's still the best 10in tablet so far, which says just as much about the competition as it does about Apple's tablet. It's still relatively heavy though, so lighter tablets such as the iPad Mini will be a better buy for some.

HERE'S A BREAK DOWN", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Author": "Crabigail Cassidy \"Crabby Abby\"", "ReviewID": "R3PO54J7RA7969", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Honestly, I had been trying to figure out what an iPad4 was. Well, this is essentially an iPad3 with a few improvements that I really like.I already own an iPad2, but decided to upgrade to this because I needed to bump up to 32GB.  That, and a deal on this iPad which was incredible convinced me to upgrade now. I still use my MacAir and my Dell laptops, but the iPad is my daily go to device and where I go an iPad is going. Great battery life and minimal problems make this a much loved convenience.The improvements are not overwhelming, but the truth is I already love the iPad and this makes it better. I've always thought the screen image was very good, but this is an obvious step up. It is clear, bright and vivid with the improved retina display.The iSight camera at five megapixels is very good, but I wasn't complaining about the pictures I took with my old iPad. Still, it is a nice improvement and it takes a much clearer picture than my old iPhone.The new processor is really fast. I didn't think it was slow before but when I have a lot of apps running I've noticed that it is faster. You'll have to trust me on this one. I tend to run a lot of stuff at the same time and the old iPad was slower, but not to the extent that I found it irritating or irksome.I like the new lightening connector which is an 8 wire adapter. Just me, but it seems less clunky. However, if you have a lot of Apple products that use the old 30 wire adapter, this may be a pain. I'm going to have to get another car charger/wall charger and I'll have to take two chargers to cover both adapter types when I hit the road.Another thing I like is my personal secretary Siri. Depress the screen button and Siri is ready to roll. It is voice interpretive intuitive software that retrieves information. While this will probably seem like rudimentary artificial intelligence in a few years, I get a total kick out of it. It's nice to get directions or find out where the Sox are playing or get the earliest showing of a movie. Love it, though I am still playing around with it and probably haven't scratched the surface yet. I don't know if there is any truth to this, but I've heard that the Suri software may be available for the earlier versions of iPad at a later date.As for the size and weight, minimally larger but I'd be hard pressed to say this except I compared the specs.Here is the thing. If you don't care about a better camera or a better display or a faster processing speed or having your own cyber slave to talk to, go with the less expensive iPad2.I like Apple products. I have been using the iPad for two years now and it is fairly trouble free. The few problems I've had were the result of software upgrades. I am absolutely no techie type, but the problems have all been fixed with minimal grief.This product is getting 4* because the differences between this iPad and its predecessor are slight when you look at the overall big picture. This takes a great product and kicks it up a notch or two, but it hasn't reinvented or reimagined the iPad.Update: I am liking this better each day. The updated processor is nice but this also seems a bit more intuitive if it can possibly be so.The imaging is incredible and the pictures this takes are amazing in their clarity and level of detail.I found that my pricey Joby stand case, which was supposedly made to fit with my iPad 2 works with the new iPad despite very slightly different dimensions. I'm delighted that it doesn't have to be tossed.The only problem I've encountered thus far was an upgrade to the software. This is Apple's problem since it screwed up our other iPads with the same problems, most notably with mail. There is a fix that I found on an Apple forum.Love this, but it is still a 4* considering everything.", "Title": "Nice But Not An Overwhelming Nice", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Author": "Lionsfan \"LionsFanForLife\"", "ReviewID": "R3B0NIXN13N3MB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a MacBook and our household owns 3 Ipod Touch devices, and I made the mistake last year in buying the Nook Tablet.  It was ok, but I really didn't use it much because it was a pain to even access web pages, just clumsy overall.  So I plunked down the cash this year and took to leap.  I bought this IPad on Black Friday from the Apple store and it is getting heavy use every day at my house.  Here are the pros and cons:Pros-Awesome Retina display- this is pretty nice.  I wouldn't say it was a selling point, but is nice to have.Nice chip- this has the newest chip in it, and you can't get that with the mini.Apps- I love the apps.  My Nook was a joke compared to the immense amount of choices I have now.Great for kids- My 4 year old loves it...and I mean LOVES it.  There are so many good free apps for her to learn with.Voice dictation- This is it folks.  This was where I dropped the extra $130 or whatever.  You can build documents just speaking.Lightweight- it feels really good as all Apple products do.Charge time- I run this thing all day long and just plug it in at night.Capabilities- I feel like I am just scratching the surface, seriously.Cons-Handling- You need a case, absolutely.  I bought an Otterbox Defender.  This thing almost hit the floor 2 times when I got it.  It is just slippery and is pretty solid so one wrong shift of weight and it might fly out of your hands.I have no other complaints.", "Title": "You need one too!", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Author": "Besh", "ReviewID": "R17MWPL4MIUCNI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I love apple products, just like most of the world does!I sold my ipad3 to get the new ipad4 due to the HD front facing camera and the blazing fast A6 chip compared to the A5 I had in my ipad3.Long story short, Biggest mistake ever!

It is not my intention at all to harm apple, in fact I plan to return my ipad4 and buy an ipad3 because it was perfect.Also, Just to let you know, after I received my ipad4 I sold it and bought another one just to discover it had the same problem with Wi-Fi.Apple made a huge mistake with their new generation ipad4, and they should either fix the problem or stop selling the unit.

For this it deserves 5 stars. As an owner of the \"New iPad, aka iPad 3rd generation,\" however, I feel that Apple did an injustice to those who purchased it.The previous version was released to much fan fair in March 2012. This version was released a mere 7 months later, in October 2012. When I called Apple to find out why they would release a newer version so soon after the previous one, the representative who I spoke with informed me that there were problems with the 3rd generation, and as a result, Apple removed it from the market and introduced the generation 4.I have no problem with the fact that technology constantly changes, and that computers are outdated in short order. What I have a problem with, is the fact that Apple prematurely introduced the 3rd generation of the iPad knowing full well that it wasn't ready to be sold. While Tim Cook was onstage last March promoting the 3rd generation of the iPad as the most revolutionary product ever offered by Apple, he knew that it was just a stop-gap measure until the components were ready for the model that you see here.I love Apple products and have always thought that the company treated their customers in the highest regard. As a result of the above, I now feel differently about the company, not the products. As of this writing, Apple sells the iPad 2 and the iPad with Retina Display, aka the 4th generation. They do not sell the 3rd generation at all, as the one listed here is what the 3rd generation was supposed to be. I feel that this is very deceptive on the part of Apple and believe that owners of the now obsolete 3rd generation model should be given the option, for a fee to upgrade to the model presented here. I spoke with customer relations at Apple regarding the above and was told that this would not be an option. They readily agreed that there were \"issues,\" with the 3rd generation model, but refused to tell me what they are. In this regard, they are certainly not being very transparent to their loyal customers.So, the bottom line is that the iPad with Retina Display is a marvelous device, however owners of the previous generation got screwed. I'm giving the model presented here 5 stars, because that's what it deserves. On the other hand, if I had the option to grant stars to the way Apple treated owners of the previous version, I would give them just 1 star.", "Title": "This is an excellent device, but Apple did a disservice to owners of previous version", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "Bea Haven", "ReviewID": "R2FOXOVPREEH8N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thought I would love the iPad, but I don't even like it at this point.  I love my sister's iPad, my son's and others', but mine won't stay connected to wifi.  I tried to troubleshoot using Apple's website, called AppleCare several times, and ultimately sent the iPad to AppleCare for repair.  But my iPad still doesn't work.  In the same locations that my iPad is nonfunctional, I can use my sister's iPad (she has the iPad w/retina display, too, and I set hers up the same as mine) with no wifi connectivity issues.  But every time I try to access the internet, I get the message that my iPad is not connected to the internet. I go to settings, select the wifi connection, and if it connects at all, it's only briefly.  This happens not just with my home router, but at my place of employment and other wifi access public places (where other iPad users report no difficulty and I have no problems with my laptop, etc.). The AppleCare folks sent my iPad back in 2 days (fast service but the porblem is not solved) with a form letter that states my iPad meets Apple's specifications for acceptable performance. Unfortunately, it doesn't meet my standards. I have a $700+ lemon. I know the Apple iPad is amazing when it works (and it usually works, according to the vast majority of reviews). If Apple replaces this lemon with an iPad that actually works, I will update my review accordingly.Update-1/13/13: I spoke with AppleCare again and was instructed to send the iPad back for maintenance--this will be the second time. Why should I expect it to work this time? What a a waste of time! Another week+ without a functional iPad. If the problem persists after this encounter with AppleCare, I was told the iPad would be replaced. I am becoming more disillusioned with Apple. I have had experience with other iPads and know they can be wonderful when they work, so I would not advise against buying this iPad. But purchase with the knowledge that there is a significant problem with wifi connectivity attested to by many consumers on Apple's own discussion forum. I'm thoroughly frustrated with this lemon and my experience with AppleCare!Update-1/28/13:  After a few returns for maintenance without improvement in performance, Apple replaced my new iPad with a refurbished one. It connects to the internet, but is slow.  I've updated my router, called my wifi provider, and it's still the same.  If I could, I would return this one. One of the big selling points of the iPad is the ease of use and mine has been anything but easy to use with this wifi connectivity issue. Another big selling point is the fast connection speed--not so for me.

The iPad is extremely useful and portable for studying anywhere, anytime.  It offers several different apps that allow you to store PDF documents, highlight, and annotate.A helpful tip for people interested in using this for school.  I subscribed for a free membership at Acrobat.com -- an Adobe product. This was a 100% free program.  You download the Acrobat app to your iPad, and it will allow you to view, highlight, and annotate.  The beauty of Acrobat is that they give you 5GB of free online storage.  (5GB is almost unheard of to get for free... Drop Box only offers 2GB for free.)  Once you have your Acrobat.com account set up, log on to the website from your desktop/laptop (wherever you have your PDF documents stored).  From there, you upload your PDFs to Acrobat.com, and you can access them anywhere and anytime by logging on to the website.  Your website login info will be saved in the Acrobat app on your iPad, and you can study and annotate your PDFs from there.  Once you are done studying, Acrobat automatically saves your modifications to those PDFs, so you can view your latest modified document ANYWHERE.  If you forget your iPad one day, you can log in on any computer and view/modify your documents from Acrobat.com.  **By using Acrobat.com you will not use up any of your iPads hard drive space, so the 16GB was more than enough for me.^^ Sorry about that tangent, but I found this extremely helpful, and I wanted to share it with everyone!

Received as promised on 2/19/13. But before I even opened the factory-sealed packaging, I called Apple support to verify that the serial # (which was visible on the outside) was not registered to another Apple user.I had read in some of the reviews that people thought they were buying brand new iPads on Amazon, but received used ones. When I spoke to Apple, the person on the phone, Abby, was very helpful. She stated that the serial # I gave was not registered to an Apple user. However, it was listed as purchased back in Oct 2013. I asked if that meant this was a used iPad. She said not necessarily. As I was buying from a distributor through Amazon (Xr Distributors was the one mine came from), it could be that they bought the iPads and resold them without any customer having used them in the meantime. The downside is that the 1-year warranty that iPads come with would expire in Oct 2014, taking away from the amount of time I expected to have a warranty.I contacted the seller to let them know what Apple said, and they replied to my query within two hours. John T., who was listed as Operations Manager, apologized in the email for the inconvenience and said that all their iPads were brand new factory sealed. If I wanted to return it and buy one directly from Apple I could, or he would give me a $25 credit for the inconvenience.I really appreciated the gesture and opened the iPad to find that it was brand new, never used, and it's such a wonderful product.

The retina display is no big deal and actually makes photos look worse. I found many references to this in other reviews, but really did not believe for myself until I compared side by side with ipad 2. Mostly photos taken with camera phones of loer pixels look horrible on ipad 4 but good or even great on ipad 2. I am not impressed with the increased processor speed, as you really would not notice it anyway unless you play video games. I do not. Overall, there is really no discernible benefit to spend the money and replace an ipad 2. Of course if you did not own an ipad before, or owned the original, I highly recommend ipad over other tablets. I have owned and used many android based, and the Apple iOS I find better and much more stable.

I was able to return my ipad 3 to the apple store within 3 weeks of purchasing from them. At first I was angry that apple released a newer version after 6 months. I then purchased the refurbished ipad 3. After a while I found it to be slow and read many good reviews about the ipad 4. Black Friday came along and I was able to purchase the ipad 4 for cheaper than the price of the brand new ipad 3 version.On to my review. The ipad 4 is considerably faster than the ipad 3. I noticed this right away once I started using it. Opening, closing and switching apps is faster. Boot up is now half the time of the ipad 3. The ipad 3 took almost 50 seconds, ipad 4 takes 25 seconds. Wifi is also much faster. I have a newer router that supports dual channel bonding. Many web pages load almost instantly. Speed tests show much faster speeds. My ipad 3 would get 30-40 Megs down. My ipad 4 gets 60-70 megs down. The ipad 4 also comes with the lightning connector cable and a faster powered charger. This allows the ipad 4 to be charged in quicker amount of time (5hours and 15 minutes). The ipad 3 charged with its charger takes 6 hours to fully charge. The ipad 4 also has a newer hd front camera for FaceTime or Skype. The ipad 3 did seem slow at times mainly due to an under powered processor having to operate the demanding retina display. The ipad 4 no longer has this problem. My ipad 4 finally feels like my ipad2 used to feel. Fast and responsive. My ipad 4 is also getting 1-2 more hours battery life than my ipad 3. This is due to the a6x more efficient processor. I can get about 18 hours of web browsing and youtube watching with brightness on 25% and notifications, email, GPS and Bluetooth turned off. The ipad 4's screen is made by LG. At first I didn't like it compared to my ipad 3's screen made by Samsung. The screen appears with a yellowish tint when compared to ipad 3's which has a blueish tint. After using the ipad for a few days the ipad 4's screen grew on me. The LG screen is said to be more accurate and easier on the eyes. I also found it brighter, which means I can keep the brightness lower to save battery life.When the ipad 4 was first announced I was hoping it had some of the ehancements I had on my wish list. I wanted it to be lighter, thinner, stereo speakers and 2gb ram. None of these features were added to the ipad 4. The ipad 4 is still heavy and thicker than the ipad2. The ipad 2 was the perfect weight and thickness. The ipad 4 is still heavier and thicker due to its retina display and much larger battery. I don't know if the ipad 5 will be able to be made thinner and lighter. There is a good chance the next ipad will have stereo speakers like the ipad mini design. I'm still not sure how their will be room to fit the stereo speakers. Hopefully the next ipad will also have 2gb of ram. This is a much needed feature so that the ipad can better multitask and run many tabs without reloading pages.If you don't really need or care about a lighter, thinner ipad with stereo speakers and 2 gb of ram then you should buy the ipad 4 right now. The ipad 4 is a great device, which is the fastest when compared to any other tablet on the market right now. No other tablet will give you 10+ hours battery life. Apple continues to have the best tablet apps with 275,000 and growing. Apple also has great build quality and support. The ipad 4 is must have for previous owners of the ipad 1 or 2. If you have the ipad 3 and you bought it when it first came out I would still suggest waiting for the next ipad. Unless you can sell your ipad 3 for a reasonable price or you were able to return it.

MS Surface won hands down in my experience.First off, you can actually run more than one website on the Surface. If playing a Youtube video on the Surface and at the same time briefly browsing a different website, the Youtube video continues to play. Not so on the iPad. The video stops the momemt you browse to another website even in a different tab.Secondly, as far as Youtube is concerns the Surface version runs all videos like a full blown laptop. The iPad version runs only a subset of the videos and tells you to play the others on a computer.Thirdly, the Surface has a built in stand. No need to buy a cover stand separately.Fourth, even when not using the stand, the Surface is much easier to hold in the hand - slips much less than the iPad.I like the Surface user interface for switching from one browser tab to another better than the iPad. Not sure if that's a definite win for everyone since some folks may prefer the IPad.Not to mention the Surface is about half the price. True, iOS has more apps, but for all the apps I use (Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Youtube, Skype, WhatsApp, email, browser, Yelp, and some travel related apps), both have all the apps needed.

I used it for about 2 weeks.  I found it not as intuitive and the learning curve, while not bad, was a bit more cumbersome to learn to use.  Also it was one more operating system I would have to understand and use. I have an iphone 5, which replace my 4.  The iphone is easy to use, all kinds of apps (though I dont use many, its nice to know they are available).  I have handle the ipad before from relatives etc and they seemed nice and all, but not much different  from the iphone and wondered why the fuss.  At the time, I just couldnt see spending the bigger bucks for the iPad.  I found out differently.  While the Kindle does everything it says it does,  I returned it and ordered this ipad.  I feel now that it is definitely worth the extra.  It has the same sharp image with the retina display as the kindle and I would say even better.  Since I travel a lot and have satelite for TV at home, I use a vulkano (like sling box) to view my DVR recordings and live tv stations from home.  The Kindle did an OK job, but the iPad is superior with that task.  the app for kindle worked, had to pay extra for it and the operating system handled it OK but every 30 to 40 minutes it would drop the connection.  The ipad app was free and rock solid, so far.  I had used the iphone for several years, and using the iPad is as comfortable with familiar icons and function.  It has a little larger screen, ease of use, more apps, and accessories than kindle which made me spring for the extra dollars.

With the apps that I use through the Apple store, I have gotten more than enough use out of it.  The iPad 2 was not enough of a generational jump without upgraded graphics, and the iPad 3 wasn't enough because of the resolution of the camera.  However, this model is truly a wonder and it will be with me until iPad 8 comes out, I suppose.The integrated camera has excellent resolution, as does the video.  The processor is perceivable faster for graphics intensive games such as those by Gameloft, EA Sports and the like.  Sound seems to have improved, as well.Although the latest rendition uses a different port from the predecessors, it's easier to use since either orientation will work.  It does essentially make my accessories, though, obsolete.  That means a new speaker dock, car charger and whatever else I may need.  However, I have become accustomed to using Bluetooth peripherals making connectivity more seamless.Operation is pretty much identical, and then there's Siri.  I find limited use for Siri since I have a Wifi-only iPad.  I can type faster than hold the Home button to talk, and voice recognition is ok.  Not great.  I can touch type must faster than Siri can understand me and react.  However, I'll give it more time.The housing is as small as iPad 2 and 3.  Battery life is essentially the same since Bluetooth and Wifi are always on with a 75% brightness.  The volume control is responsive.Since I have over 1200 apps, I'm pretty much stuff with Apple.  That is the main reason I haven't considered other operating systems, apart from the Kindle Fire.Overall, I'm pleased.  If you don't have an iPad, this is finally the one.  If you're waiting to upgrade from iPad 1 or 2, then it's a no-brainer.  iPad 3 is certainly not that much behind.  Intuitively, I prefer to have a jump in processing, graphics, sound and resolution before I plan to update, again.I love this device.Two thumbs up.Update:I decided to jump up in memory to the 128 GB version.  Music, movies and applications take up a lot of memory.  Aside from the jump in memory, there are no discernible changes in operation or battery life.", "Title": "I'm no early adopter.
