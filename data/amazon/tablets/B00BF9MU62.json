Bought this tablet because the price was cheap. I have a child who doesn't always take care of her things so I decided to go the cheap route with this tablet. It worked okay. Picture quality wasn't all that good and it was a little slow. After having the tablet for less that 6 months the USB port completely fell out when the charger was taken out of it. We called the company that makes the tablet and they said that this happens all the time! Not by any fault of the owner but by fault of the manufacturing. Since the port fell out it completely ruined the inside motherboard of the tablet and it was no longer able to even turn on. I usually don't write reviews but I felt people should be aware of the faulty USB port before trying to purchase this item.", "Title": "Faulty USB Port", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Author": "Stanimir Stoyanov", "ReviewID": "R11MVMF6PKM87Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Android Operation system is too slow, also it can't catch Wi-Fi, even when I try from few metres.Sometimes just turn off by itselfs.", "Title": "It doesn't response on my expectations.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Author": "Tammy Y.

I love the apps available on the Amazon App Store (I use the tablet mainly for the Kindle app but also for some Facebook and Pinterest. Netflix works well but the screen is a little too small to make watching worthwhile.) I haven't found an app I like for listening to music so I don't know how performance would be in this area. I'm disappointed with the browser which is VERY slow. I haven't taken any photos yet that turned out good enough to keep. All were deleted and it's unlikely I'll be using this feature unless absolutely necessary. Overall, it's well worth the price if it's problem areas aren't a big deal (to me they're not.)

I actually purchased two of them since we have twin 5 y/o's and wanted them to each have their own tablet (to avoid the usual sibling arguments), and while I had to get 1 of them in white, since the black model was back-ordered for over 6 weeks, they are great for what we need them to do.
