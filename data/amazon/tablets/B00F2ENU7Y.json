Alberts", "ReviewID": "R710IYWCYZDAM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I won a Miix2 8 at a company event, and bought a second one for myself.  Both managed, within a few days of each other, to fall from about 2.5; off of a desk.  In both cases, the bezel separated from the back (it was in a protective case, and this still occurred).  Now that's bad enough, but to make matters worse the way the power button is situated, separating the bezel from the back causes it to pull out of the hinge, making it impossible to turn on or off if you reconnect the bezel right away.  If this happens to you, it's fixable but you have to be careful.  Take a butter knife and remove the back carefully.  Go to the power button and you'll see that any little bezel separation will cause the button to come out of its little hinge.  Replace the button into the hinge and replace the back.  This isn't a big deal if you have a lot of experience fixing computers or other gadgets, but it's sort of ridiculous that an 8\" tablet has a build quality like this.  If I need to buy another one, I think I'd look at the Dell or the Thinkpad 8 instead as the build quality seems better on both of those.  And even though you can fix this issue, the power button is sort of ridiculously small and difficult to turn on or off while in the case compared to a Surface RT or the Dell.Beyond the build quality, the machine works as advertised--fairly snappy, the screen is bright and clear, and Windows 8.1 seems practically made for this device size.  I've really enjoyed using it so far, if the build quality is excluded.", "Title": "Good, but fragile", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Author": "A. Lebov", "ReviewID": "RUET81ZCYRISR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've read the other reviews (including the very negative ones) and I'm not sure if I just got a \"good\" unit but I've not had a single issue with this tablet.It boots very fast when shut off, and wakes instantaneously when sleeping. Speedy processor and strong and stable WiFi (benchmarked faster than my Lenovo B570 laptop!). GPS works perfectly (not sure if it has an onboard compass though). Very responsive touchscreen and although at first I admittedly didn't like windows 8, after a month of learning how to use it I honestly think it's the best system for touchscreen computers available. Runs legacy Windows programs like a champ as well.As for the Dell Venue; Although much ado has been made about the Miix2 speaker volume vs the Dell Venue 8 Pro, I had both units and although the Dell speaker is louder it exhibits a great deal of harmonic distortion. On the other hand the Lenovo has a very clean sound. Seems plenty loud to me and I'm a musician by trade. The Dell also claims to have a longer battery life, but they play a trick by testing the battery charge with the screen greatly dimmed down. Lenovo tested their battery life with the screen at normal brightness and contrast. The colors were also rather \"odd\" on the Dell and the whites on the screen weren't quite white. The Venue is also considerably heavier than the Miix2 which can become an issue if you often use it as a handheld reader. But the worst issue is the terrible placement of the Windows button on the Venue. You search for it constantly.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this tablet again.  I've watched movies on it in several formats that neither the iPad nor Android will play, surfed many flash websites, played games, downloaded the Kindle app and used it as a reader. It's really a joy to use.", "Title": "Just wonderful.

I personally like mine, but then I also like and enjoy my iPad (First Gen 3G), and plan to buy an iPad Air to replace that iPad later in 2015.  This tablet is more of a splurge/impulse buy from Best Buy (they had it for $200 on the weekend of 3/8).  It's supposed to be a toy and a hands-on for Windows 8.1Pro -- The machine has surprisingly decent firepower for multi-threaded tasks - it feels like a similarly clocked notebook PC from 2009.  If you bought a CULV machine from back then, well, it's about that fast.  To translate from non-geek, it's about as fast as the first 3 generations of the 11 Inch MacBook Air.- VMX mode (virtualization) is enabled by default, so it is possible, in theory, to run something else alongside.- Graphics performance is decent enough for games made before, say, 2006 - Half-life 2 should run \"okay\" on it with native resolution - it does have a cut-down version of Intel's Ivy Bridge GPU (think of it as like the Intel HD2200, the 4EU version of the 6EU HD2500).  Stuff like Nintendo 64 and/or Sony PSX emulation is do-able, if not entirely friendly to your battery.- Comes with Quicksync, so video transcoding on the tablet is possible.  Just grab the right version of Handbrake Nightly with QS support, and use it to convert some downloaded videos to your smartphone.  Yeah, use your tablet to make videos for your Android or Blackberry 10 phone (or if you really like to mess your tablet up, run iTunes on it so you can synch it with your iOS devices...and shoot yourself in the foot while at it).  That's so wrong but it feels so right.- Comes with a full version of Microsoft Office 2013 Personal and Students edition for free (not the Office 365 demo, the actual Office 2013 suite).  You could conceivably do some work on it.- Dualband, dual antenna wireless capable (decent wireless network speeds if you have a recent wireless access point)- Decent camera quality (and the panoramic picture mode is nice to play with)- Broadcom GNSS GPS receiver. it's GPS but not standard full NMEA stanza GPS.  If you plan to use it to replace your Garmin....eh, buy Centrafuse Localizer ($5) so it can translate the GNSS data into something-kinda-NMEA for compatibility purposes.- Bluetooth 4.0 Low energy capable- Ability to read from external hard drives, USB sticks and most other USB accessories.  I actually use it to connect the machine to my office internal network via ethernet.  Just buy a Micro USB OTG adapter if you wish to do that, and look for one that can do power injections (it's a Y-cable) if you want to run devices while keeping your battery charged.- If you really need to do so, the USB OTG can be combined with the freely available Asus AiPower utility to act as an emergency phone charger.Yeah, I'm not kidding about this one.  You can use your tablet to charge your phone if you have the right cable and the right sofware utility to do so.  It's just not very fast nor very efficient to do so.Con -- 32 bit OS - Seriously guys, selling a 32 bit OS with 64 Bit hardware in 2014?!  The iPad Air has a 64 Bit ARM chip and half the RAM, and it comes with an iOS 7 64 bit build.  This is probably due to the 64 Bit Connected Standby not-ready problem hitting all the Bay Trail Atom Tablets.  Lenovo MIGHT roll a 64 Bit clean variant later on as an upgrade, but I strongly doubt it.- It only has 2GB of RAM, and Windows 8 occupies about 1GB.  You also do not have the ability to upgrade.  So running more than a few apps at a time is straight out- No separate power port, everything goes through that one Micro USB port.  If it fails you are up the creek.- No video out - no HDMI, no MicroHDMI, and no MHL.  So unless you grab a Displaylink or Miracast adapter, what you see is the only thing you'll get.- Comes with a TPM chip...of questionable utility.- 32 Bit Connected Standby Mode - the thing that helps the Atom get the great battery life, but also really held the tablet to 32 Bit Windows.  Also messes with the clockspeed of the tablet and make it laggy in the high draw titles...like the N64 emulators.- Doesn't have a conventional BIOS, so you cannot boot into an alternative OS easily - no 64 Bit Linux for you, and Linux that boots off 32 Bit UEFI is rare.- Windows 8.1 is still a headache - not really feasible as a mobile OS, really - think of it as like the 2013 equivalent of a touch friendly netbook (or better yet, the good old UMPC).  When you have to navigate 4 menus to turn bluetooth on and off one just has to wonder who fell asleep in their UI design department.- Really needs better casing options.  The Lenovo case is really a smart cover.", "Title": "Decent tablet PC, but it has its caveats.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Author": "D. Chien", "ReviewID": "R30C7E32F3N6C1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Notes from a week of use (IT power user, used everything since the TRS-80 days):+ Light enough of a tablet to be used one-handed for an hour or so of ebook reading. Not immediately 'heavy' like the Nook HD+, which really begs two-handed or lap use from the start. Well-balanced in portrait or landscape.+ Nice curves! Rounded, smooth, nothing that'll catch on your fingers or hands as you hold it and rotate it about. Like holding a polished skipping stone.+ Decently bright screen. Easy meets and slightly exceeds the brightness of a Nook HD+, though still not as bright as the Nokia 603 at 800 nits. Notebookcheck's site has their brightness tests of the three major 8\" tablets out right now (Miix 2, Excite, Venue).  Brightness indoors easily goes from borderline too bright at the lowest setting in a dark bedroom at night to bright enough to read with the sunlight coming through a silk curtained window in daytime with the highest brightness setting.  Really no complaints of note here.+ Color temp is a nice white, not a touch yellow like the Nook HD+. Colors on the Photodisc test target look IPS great (esp. skin tones)! Images pop. Really happy with this display.+ No visible touch-screen lines unlike the Toshiba Excite, which is mared by this problem. 'Soft' feel to the surface, slick, nice and very responsive =) Never a touch-issue.+ Never runs HOT like the Dell Venue, which gets far too hot at one point on the back. See notebookcheck reviews and you'll see why the Venue becomes too hot to comfortably hold at times, the Miix 2 is always just a touch warm and okay to hold.+ Charges far faster than the hours and hours Nook HD+. Like a cellphone for charge speeds, can go from 25-50% in less than an hour plugged in.+ Baby pocket rocket tablet! No significant lag on most common uses (word, web, MP4 playback, etc). Runs everything just like a desktop, which means Miix 2 = Apple and Android tablet KILLER!! =D  Seriously!!  Have had and tried everything from iPads to Nooks and short of the Lenovo Yoga, this baby kills non-Windows tablets.  Web browsing? No problems at all - full site access with full Flash, Adobe, etc. plugins. Easy tube downloading through Firefox with Download Helper. Full torrent, Netflix, Hulu, etc. capabilities, etc.  Office, remote desktop, etc.  (Okay, a few things it can't do due to 32-bit OS...)+ Finally, the ONLY platform that let's you run both desktop EPWING dictionaries through EBPocket and view eBooks at the same time in two side-by-side windows Win8-style for studying foreign languages. And full foreign language input capabilities, with pen/handwritten input, for easy input of even the most complex Chinese characters.  Android, eg. using Nook HD+, was the closest with 3rd party handwritten keyboard, but no dual-apps running simultaneously on-screen meant lots of needless app switching.+ No issues with MKVs, 1080p MP4s, MPGs, DVD rips, subs, etc. playback, naturally. MPHC, VLC, WinAmp, etc. all run just like any other PC =D No need to worry about conversion, bitrates too high, funky sub formats, etc. EVERYTHING plays fine. (Unlike Android where even all the media players couldn't handle EVERYTHING I tossed at them.)+ MicroSD port. Push in slightly to eject. No audible sound. Cover is a plastic flap. Works fine with 32MB class 10 MicroSD cards. Haven't tested anything bigger yet.+ Regular USB to MicroUSB (OTG) cable works fine for connecting to printers, etc. Nice. Plugged in my all-in-one Epson and could scan and print in under a minute after driver install.+ Sony Vegas Video 11 runs fine on this. Can do basics like fading between two 1080p clips on the timeline without much fuss. Generally on the more responsive side, so useable as a mobile editing platform.+ Built-in cameras that can take 1920x1080 ~20Mbps, 29.97fps progressive, AAC 192 48khz MP4 video from the back.  Nice in daylight, decent resolution and detail, okay in low-light, but not 'horrible' or 'unusable'.+ Runs all 32-bit programs like VLC, Media Player Home Classic, WinRAR, Adobe Acrobat Reader, Office 2013, etc.+ Can run Nokia HERE MAPS and download offline maps for use with the built-in GPS....except, Nokia still hasn't gotten the license to include maps for JAPAN yet after all these years! >.< Certainly is handy to have maps of all other major countries offlined on this tablet - far easier to download than all other mapping programs since each region/area is one download file rather than thousands of 'tiles' ala OpenStreetMaps/Google/MapQuest/etc. screen scraping map offloading programs.  (Haven't tested the GPS unit yet...)+ LOUD speakers.  Have absolutely no idea what others are saying, but I can have this in a noisy buffet restaurant packed with a hundred people yapping away and at full volume, can easily listen to music videos, etc.  Easily exceeds the volume I regularly set my car audio deck at 45MPH on about 3/4 volume when used in my car.  Think 'cellphone-like' speaker and you'll be fine (Pocket AM/FM radio sound for you analog types.)+ Bluetooth tethering to Nokia 603 works fine (...but see below, no adhoc)+ Power on/off/volume buttons require enough pressure not to be accidentally pressed in most cases.+ Can't beat the two Franklin price point! Nukes every other tablet in the range out of the market. Nooks from one hundred to the Tabs and minis at three. And once you're up beyond three, it's time to look at the superior Yoga series, which honestly kills everything out there for most uses short of a high-end, i7 1080+ IPS panel, fast gaming GPU notebook.+ Runs Office. Full Office. Complete Desktop Office 2013 =D  No issues now opening, editing, creating any Office document for work, school, etc. This alone kicks the other OS tablets to the curb IMO.+ Easily pushes 5+ hours of mixed surfing and downloading without running out of battery. One of those tablets where you can run through a 8-hour work/school day without worrying about bringing the AC charger. (Naturally, turn brightness down, Airplane mode whenever you're not online.)- 32-bit Windows! And only 2GB RAM.CPU can run 64-bit OSs and 4GB, so sad you can't install and run memory-intensive, 64-bit apps. Lenovo also doesn't have 64-bit drivers for upgrading yourself. No Premiere CC >.< No Visual Studio 2013 >.< Virtualize and run portable apps to get around this, offloading things like Photoshop to the MicroSD card.- A touch slow at picking up rotation. Not sure yet if it's OS (likely) or by design. Just a half second or so, but sometimes, you have to bump it on the edge to rotate.- Speaker is on the back. >.< Sigh... When will cellphone and tablet designers wake up and stop doing stupid things like placing speakers on the opposite side of the human?!? Should be on the front, so you'll have to cup the speaker with your hand or use a waveguide to direct all of the sound to the front where you are.- Too bad it doesn't have a regular USB sized port built-in. They could have made a baby bump on one edge and used that to include HDMI, too, which isn't included.- Only one USB port that can be used to charge, or for connecting to devices. Thus, external HUB is required. Wished they had two or more ports.- Windows 8.1 issue - NO ADHOC connection to cellphones (eg. Joikuspot on Nokia)!!!! Very, very annoying, Microsoft >.< - It is slick like a polished stone. Too bad no hand strap port for use with a hand-strap. It can slip out of the hands - put a strip of textured cloth or rubber tape on the back to fix this. But still better than the ugly Venue rubber back.- Only 32GB. Office + Win8.1 + a handful of simple apps results in about 5GB free.- WiFi antenna/module isn't as good as on a laptop/desktop with multi-antennas/etc. 3 bars Miix 2 vs 5 bars Z580 at one location with a distant router (showing about -85dB in Inssider). But at least it's a/b/g/n, so it'll connect to about everything short of ac.- Too bad no built-in FM radio. Heck, even my Nokia 603 has a built-in FM radio. Modules can't be that expensive.- No power option besides a basic BALANCED. Can't control CPU speed using default OS shipped. (Maybe there's a 3rd party?)- Typical Win-Classic side adjusting of fonts and display settings to get things big enough to read comfortably. Win 8 side is generally fine.- 9\" Nook HD+ Screen is about the right size for full page comic book reading in portrait mode, so this 8\" Miix 2 begs to be turned landscape and scrolled. Thus, you'll have to decide whether you want a one-page, scroll-free view of your comics, etc. or not before buying a tablet of this size. Very responsive with 4-cores, so it's not been an issue here reading ebooks.", "Title": "Love ^o^ The BEST 8\" tablet at a Great price! Beats just about everything else at the price point =)", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Author": "Val Gameiro", "ReviewID": "R35UONVSA58SPM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got my first Lenovo Miix 2 8\" tablet for Xmas 2013. I had been resisting getting a tablet, even though my wife had owned her iPad for years, and loved it. I'm a writer and a filmmaker (in my spare time) so I thought I would always want/need a physical keyboard. For that reason, I bought a Lenovo S10 Netbook, and loved it. Last Xmas my wife persuaded me to buy a tablet, and I finally gave in, but misunderstood the sales rep and didn't buy the accidental damage plan -- BIG MISTAKE! If you buy a tablet, make sure you get at least their 1-year accidental damage protection. I ended up buying mine at Best Buy, but Office Depot's accidental damage plan prices are about half.At any rate, I knew I needed/wanted a Windows 8 tablet instead of Android or iPad, because I already have a lot of software I use on my Netbook. If I want a regular keyboard, I can use that to write, but if I want to be mobile (surfing the net while in bed, or watch some Hulu or Netflix) I use my tablet. It's great for traveling, much easier to handle and put away, and because it is not a \"larger electronic device\" I can keep it on the whole time on the plane.I like the size at 8\" -- the 7\" was too small, and the 10\" too big (I know because I tried a Microsoft Surface 1st gen and it was too heavy and bulky to handhold on a plane).I also like that you don't have to join the Microsoft collective to use the tablet -- I have my own cloud storage set up so I'm using a local account instead of a Microsoft account -- VERY happy about that. I use OwnCloud for this.Pros:Light, boots up fast, runs most Windows programs I need (within the 2GB RAM limit). You can plug it in to your laptop or computer and it will charge. You can also use a regular USB to Micro USB adapter to connect external drives. You do not need a USB OTG (on the go) adapter for this tablet. You can plug in a USB hub and connect multiple USB peripherals at the same time. Good finger friendly interface. Able to run Modern Apps and Desktop Apps. The Metro/Modern interface is pretty good on a tablet (I don't like it on a desktop or a phone, though).Cons:Only has 2GB of RAM, and you can't expand it. These are fragile, and if you drop it, it will more than likely break - at least the glass screen. When I broke mine and called Lenovo, because I didn't have a protection plan, the replacement glass alone was $200, and I only paid $300 for it... hardly worth it. You can pretty much only use self-powered hard drives with this thing. This isn't as popular as the iPad so there aren't quite as many accessories available. Had a hard time finding a good case that wasn't pink or purple :(  The Windows Store is a lot sparser than the Android store, or the Apple store... but there are quite a few apps there, and Microsoft has released a free tool (Project Siena) to allow people to create apps easily.Bottom Line:When my original one broke... I saved up to get a second one... with accidental damage plan. I tried a Dell Venue Pro 8, and I wasn't happy with it. This is definitely my favorite tablet. Get it if you want/need Windows apps and you want portability. Definitely get a decent case to protect it, along with an accidental damage protection plan.", "Title": "I never thought I'd like a tablet - until now", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Author": "Lucy", "ReviewID": "R2QKJA9LMGO7U1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So frustrated with this due to a bunch of bugs. It froze a few times while I was doing something so I had to do a hard shutdown but 3 freezes in 14 days was forgivable. What is not forgivable is that EVERY day when putting it to sleep or shutting it down it would freeze. Putting it to sleep makes no sense because it would drain about 10% battery per hour...sometimes it would wake up from sleep without needing to do a hard shutdown but is not worth using unless I was coming back to it in 30 minutes to an hour. Shutting down would not drain the battery IF it shut down correctly. When it shut down correctly it would take about 5 seconds to restart which was great. Half the time you would think it was shut down though but it wasn't and it would drain the battery at an alarming rate. Last night I shut it down at 95% battery and when I woke up it was totally dead. I had to plug it in to start it and the battery was 1%. I've googled this and many others have had the same issues. I tried some supposed fixes by changing the Wi-Fi settings but it did not work. I wanted so much for this to work out. It is pretty nice and if not for these simple issues it would be a keeper.

Here are some comments:1.  This is my first use of Win8 (actually, Win8.1) with a touchscreen.  I can see the usefulness of using Win8 this way.  On a laptop or desktop, I find it much easier to use Win7.2.  I am disappointed so far in Lenovo's support of this tablet.  If you go to their website and look up \"parts\" or other service info for the Mixx2 8, you will find VERY little information.  I am trying to work thru a problem with WiFi on my unit.  Device Manager says that the WiFi system is by Broadcom, and the driver that is installed is from Broadcom.  But the Lenovo website says that the WiFi system is by \"Hiking\" and they provide a driver for it.  I'm very confused and don't know what to do. But, if you've ever owned any \"Think\" product, you'll know and appreciate that IBM/Lenovo has always made it very easy to find and install updates and firmware for your device, using System Update.  At least so far, there is no similar service for this tablet, and so it is very difficult to find an install updates.3.  Along the lines of #2, above - there is no forum that I've found to communicate with the company or other owners about this issue.  And Lenovo has on their website addresses or numbers to deal with questions about \"Think\" or \"Idea\" branded products, but there is nothing to indicate where the Mixx fits in.  Frustrating.4.  Using an 8\" tablet to work with Windows programs is difficult.  I use a program called Multiplay, in which you have to use the program's icons.  To touch an icon on an 8\" screen is very difficult.  I use the stylus that came with my flip cover, but it's not as good as using the touchpad on a laptop.5.  Typing on the screen is much better than I thought it would be.  Navigation is good.  The system is very responsive.6.  WiFi so far is not very reliable.  On networks at work or my home network, sometimes I'm able to connect with no problems and other times I'm not able to connect at all.  I find that changing the WiFi driver from \"Broadcom\" to the \"Microsoft\" helps.  Why it keeps changing back to \"Broadcom\" is a mystery.  Again, I wish I could discuss this on a forum, but I can't find one.7.  I feel VERY limited by not having a SIM card for this unit.  For this tablet, which I got when it was first released, there was no SIM option available - only WiFi.  If I had the choice, I would DEFINITELY get the SIM option.  I don't know if newer Miix tablets are offered with SIM, but if they are, I would recommend that.  I'm GUESSING that the Thinkpad version of this tablet (which I read about in one of these reviews/comments) will offer that option, and I'd think I would be happier with that one.8.  In conclusion, I think that this tablet is good as to see what Win8 in a touch environment can do.  But I'm not able to reliably get any real work done with it, I'm disappointed in Lenovo's website support (so far), and I think the \"Thinkpad version\" of this tablet would make a better choice for anything more than media consumption (reading or videos or games).  For now, I'm still happiest with my X220 Thinkpad, after using an iPad with ClamCase Pro and a Galaxy Note 2 and the Miix2 8\".", "Title": "A good introduction for Win8 touch, but...", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "R15SVZYQS5Z63C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As with any technology as soon as you receive something it is already obsolete - particularly true in this case as Lenovo is slated to start shipping the ThinkPad 8 with an 8.3 screen, a faster processor, optional keyboard/case and most importantly a micro-HDMI port at the end of January 2014.Attention: GPS on the ThinkPad 8 will only come with the 3g/4g/LTE models due out later.Someone has written that both the Lenovo Miix 2 8 and the Dell Venue Pro 8 are just toys without HDMI output.

I do IT support for a living and eventually I'm going to have to deal with Windows 8 so I needed an inexpensive device to learn it on.  I've been using the iPad since they first came out and my go-to tablet is currently an iPad mini.  That is inevitably going to color my opinion of this device.  I'm going to limit my comments here to the tablet itself not windows 8 as I am new to the OS and am having the expected learning curve.Build Quality:  Nowhere near iPad quality.  The back is covered with stickers.  The most important of them is the one containing the Lenovo product information and serial number.  Guess which one is starting to peel off after less than a week.  Right! The Lenovo sticker.  There is a bit of give on the left side of the tablet about 1/3 of the way up from the bottom where it feels as though the back has warped a bit and isn't quite seated against either the display or the other components.  It cheapens the feel of the tablet but doesn't affect anything else.  The microSD card slot doesn't seem to latch to the SD card properly and the card will randomly disconnect from the computer. Reseating the SD card fixes the problem until next time.  The buttons on the right side are easily found and have sufficient feel that you know that they have been pressed without requiring enough force to be irritating.  The capacitive windows button on the lower front engages positively.  I haven't had very many accidental presses of it which is better than I expected.  The sound is terrible without headphones and fine with them.  This isn't a major issue for me; if you need great speakers, look elsewhere.Performance:  I'm actually quite pleased.  I was expecting rather sluggish performance and the tablet surprises me.  It does what I typically use a tablet for only slightly slower than my iPad mini (old version) and hasn't been an issue with anything I typically use a tablet for.Issues:  The biggest issue I've run into is the failure to wake-up from the sleep state.  When I'm using a tablet for something I need to grab it and use it.  On both my iPad and the Android tablets I've used, this isn't a problem.  Press a button, swipe, enter your PIN or whatever your are using to lock the tablet and go.  The same is true here if the tablet hasn't been asleep for a couple of hours at a time.  Then, it is a case of grab the tablet, press the windows key (nothing); try again (nothing); hold power button down for 10 seconds to power the tablet off. (Note that there is no feedback to indicate the tablet is off or still asleep.)  Release the power button.  Press the power button for a second or two until the Lenovo logo comes up and the tablet boots.  The boot is quite fast but by the time I've gone through this I could have done what I needed on any Android tablet or iPad and gone on to something else.  This is a MAJOR issue for me.  On the iPad, the only time I ever power it off is during an IOS update.  On the Lenovo, I've had to forcibly shut down two and three times a day either to recover from a no-wake-up condition or a random freeze.Apps:  I'm not going to dwell on this as it isn't a Lenovo issue; it's generic to Windows 8.  I have been able to find all the apps that I needed although they seem to be less well thought out than either the Android or IOS versions.  There are some glaring exceptions; Amazon instant video for example; but, for the most part I can do with this tablet the same things I frequently use on my iPad.As I said at the beginning, I bought this as a learning tool and it is useful for that.

The Lenovo Miix not only had issues with all three of my Bluetooth audio headsets it did not show all supported Bluetooth services in the audio options window.When I first paired with our LG700 and LG730 Bluetooth headsets, Xbox music seemed to stream fine using the Stereo Headset service. After another hand full of updates the Stereo option was replaced with a generic Bluetooth headphone audio option that would frequently pause as audio was streamed. Occasionally, the audio option would reset to Bluetooth hands free headset service known for its horrid audio quality when listening to music. I was forced to manually reset to the generic Bluetooth headphone service to get decent stereo audio. All of our Bluetooth devices work as expected with the Asus RT and Acer W500 tablets.I noticed I was only getting one to two bars while in my bedroom which is the room most distant from the router. Down load and upload speeds were 1/3 to 2/3 respectively of that seen on my Asus RT and Acer W500 tablets. The Acer is running Windows 8.1 and the Asus RT 8.0.I do not understand what is happening with Bluetooth audio and the newer Windows devices. Certainly, I cannot be the only customer using quality Bluetooth headsets to listen to music on Windows 8 and RT machines.The Dell is resetting as I type so it can be returned. If the Wi-Fi had not been so poor, I might have spent time trying to ferret out the Bluetooth audio issues.The Lenovo is lighter than the Dell but the raised logo on the back can be felt while holding the Lenovo and is a distraction. The Dell had a better overall feel while holding.Lenovo ships with more crapware apps. Speaking of ... it also ships with a trial version of MacAfee. As usual, I was not sure it had been totally removed when \"uninstalled.\" Come on vendors the days of shipping with Norton or MacAfee should be over!Dell audio is louder and better when used without a headset.Be prepared for update hell after unboxing the Lenovo. As a seasoned Windows user, I expect updates but the Lenovo ships with a few of its own that are a pain to install.The Dell built-in microphone was better for untrained Speech to Text control and dictation. I had to train the Lenovo before I could use Speech to control the device and accurately dictate. The Dell responded well without training.Rear camera for both Dell and Lenovo were poor. In contrast the Asus rear camera is good and has an LED flash (unless you disable it updating to Windows 8.1)As someone using both Windows 8.1 pro and Windows RT 8.0 tablets, I prefer the Windows RT experience. Windows 8.1 pro on my desktops yes but Windows RT offers a better tablet experience for me. Windows RT means fewer updates, fewer worries about manufacturer delivery of driver updates, and far fewer worries about catching a nasty Virus. I know I may be in the minority re. my fondness for Windows RT on tablets but do not need full Windows when using a tablet. Give me a few Metro apps (like Music, News and Slapdash), Office, good built-in mic, Microsoft Speech to Text and I'm good to go.", "Title": "Both Lenovo and Dell have Bluetooth Audio issues and Lenovo inferior WiFi", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Author": "The Fifth Ocean", "ReviewID": "R30MQ9QCGOQ3YB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It froze three times within the first day doing some tasks that supposed to be a breeze on the iPad.

I researched long and hard for a lightweight, portable full windows device that runs Microsoft Office and doesn't break the bank.

It took me a full three days to finally successfully connect the device to the internet, only to have it disconnect again on sleep. I've tried everything (updated/uninstalled/reinstalled drivers, run through the whole troubleshooting menu, turn it off and on, etc.) and nothing works. In fact, when I turn on the wireless network connection, it just turns itself back off again for no reason. Also, bluetooth won't detect my bluetooth keyboard anymore. I don't have hours to waste looking up help forums and fiddling with this machine to get it to do the basic task of connecting to a wireless signal that works with every other device in my house. I would have liked this tablet otherwise, but what's the point of having a tablet if you can't even get online?

I don't usually write review but I was so excited reading everyone's positive reviews, and I was so eager to receive this tablet and put it in service. Finally a good x86/x64 tablet you can actually use for work and play!Let's see -- I was going to use this tablet to access my car's ECU and use it as a vehicle diagnostic dashboard, and performance logging device. It comes with built in GPS/GNSS!!! That meant I will be able to log my fuel injection statistics and how it affects the speed of the vehicle in relationship to the fuel adjustments I make.. How awesome?In the spare time, this was going to be my couch toy.Boy was I disappointed when I found out the GPS/GNSS sensor does not work with your legacy apps that require communication over NMEA 0183 / COM port. The sensor can only be accessed by Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 applications written in Visual Studio using Windows' propitiatory API. If you are buying this to because it has GPS/GNSS sensor... Then look some where else.There is one company that makes conversion software \"centrafuse localizer\". It will make your legacy applications work with this GPS/GNSS however, the resolution is awful and slow...This sensor was only meant to be used as a location beacon so websites could provide you with targeted advertising....The wireless is slow. Even at 802.11g speeds, with device next to the wireless router, I was getting 1Mbps with serious packet loss. I'm a network engineer and this reminds me of 802.11b communicating at long distance behind a concrete wall...The eMMc storage chip is very slow. The device will boot fast, but some apps that require a lot of disk reads will be very slow to load. Other apps like \"calc\" and \"paint\" start instantly...  Opening word files takes a bit....RAM is slow too.The device ships with Windows 8.1 32bit, however the CPU is 64bit. You will not be able to change the OS because of the 32bit UEFI bios. No where is this mentioned on Lenovo's site... Really Lenovo? I am disappointing.  You will not be able to run 64bit Windows applications.Battery life is great... No complaints there.It's still a great device, and things have come a long way ahead.

I connected a bluetooth keyboard designed for iPad, and found out that only numbers were accepted.  In my case, characters were not be recognized by Windows.  But another bluetooth keyboard designed for Windows works just fine.My biggest problem with the Miix2 is the brightness of the display.  It hurts my eyes even at the lowest brightness that the device allows me to tune to.  As such, I can use the tablet only for casual web browsing.  I cannot use the tablet for productivity work.

Windows Updates could eat through that 10GB alone. Next, this was advertised as having Microsoft Office Home & Student Edition 2013 preloaded. I found that this was not the case. I could download the trial version (that would've eaten up about 5GB), but I had to purchase a key code if I wanted full access to MS Office. Also, it took forever for me to get to the appropriate support area from Lenovo. (I called because I was under the impression that I would be receiving full MS Office.) And they didn't transfer me around a phone tree. They gave me the phone number, kindly said goodbye, and hung up on me. (Auto System) Other than that, yes I'll agree that it's a nifty little device.
