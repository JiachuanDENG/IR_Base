Very disappointed!  It is WAY TOO EASY to accidently turn the tablet off due to where they placed the button.  When you touch the screen, many times you have to keep touching the words before it will accept your selection.  Also, the instruction manual is worthless.  It does not tell you how to use tablet, and when setting time, most places offered to choose are not in this country!!!!  I would not recommend this tablet to anyone.  Am sending it back!!!!", "Title": "Too touchie!!!!", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Author": "Trace E Griglione", "ReviewID": "R2CXHWHGFZU8JB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Other review notes a dongle needed.
