I saw it as an ITouch but a whole lot bigger and no cameras. But when my sister showed me her IPad 2 (and 1). I was convinced this was a great product. So first chance I got, I got one.Its everything I expected to be..the good stuff I mean...unlike the original IPad this has 2 cameras (vs 0) is thinner and faster. I was able to watch videos in near picture pefect quality. Its so easy to carry or just sit and hold.There are some problems. Even though it does have cameras...most of the time they feel like a cheap camera you buy at a dollar store. Also no Flash on it, so some sites wont work.Overall its a great Tablet, yeah there are cheaper tablets out there but only apple has a program where getting viruses and impossible.Pros:-Size-Can never get a virus-Video quality-Speed-Can easily be held and carriedCons:-Cameras could be better-No Flash", "Title": "Some new bells and whistles", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer \"Chet Brewer\"", "ReviewID": "R3IJE51AM2FY7E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok, my rating is a compromise, in terms of working exactly like its intended to it should be 4.5 stars or so, in terms of how it replaces things like a kindle, a smartphone or notebook, its maybe 1 star. I really wanted something that would allow me to ditch the laptop and use this on travel. Its not happening, functions are too poor, touch screen keyboard is not tactile enough to use for any real typing, Safari browser is cumbersome to use, can't read the screen in even normal daylight so doesn't replace my e reader at all. No real spreadsheet functions or presentation modes. Too clumsy to take noes on.  The only things it replaces laptop for are movies or videos and even then the battery life is pretty poor. As far as I can tell I really got sucked into buying one from the hype. On the other hand I use my smartphone (iPhone) constantly and it also replaced my mp3 for traveling. A case of a product making your life easier. I'm going to give the tablet to my daughter, I'm sure she will use it, but I havent really found a useful role for it", "Title": "ok, so tell me why I bought this", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Author": "David Fonseca \"Netmammal\"", "ReviewID": "R1LL73RZZB4B2P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The iPad alone I would give 4-5 stars to.  Since there is no way to separate the service you get with this device, and the device itself (and once you get this particular model of iPad, you are most likely to be using AT&T; (T-mobile is slower)), this device gets a really unfair rating from me.  Go look at the Verizon version.The good:Easy to use, light, rugged.  Great apps.  The software and apps just \"seems to work\" as compared to the two Droid phones I've owned, which crash, do weird things, are sluggish when first turned on, etc. etc.  Based on this, I would not recommend an Android tablet to anyone except the most Technoholic Open Source types.The bad: (blame AT&T;, and spineless government oversight)I bought this because I would like to use it if I ever go overseas.  Since Verizon chose to go it alone with CDMA, and the regulators let them do that, you are stuck  in their little prison if you want to switch carriers....So I was told by Apple that the data service would be easily turned on and off like a faucet, and that I would only have to pay for the months for which service was enabled.  Great!  I buy it in December, immediately use it \"off-campus\" in Albany on Christmas vacation (no internet at my Dad's if you can believe it...)Sometime during Dec/Jan, I call AT&T; to get them to help me figure out why I can not get in to the Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature.  First call was probably 15-20 minutes long, and the AT&T; representative is clueless.  It was like I was asking for help with my Acme Moon Lander.  I suspect it would have been news to the rep that AT&T; actually has millions of iPad customers who pay them monthly.  In fact enough customers that AT&T; should be able to escalate to iPad expert reps.Call two: Again 15-20 minutes, this time the rep is much more adamant that this must be an apple screen (though he could not explain why the AT&T; death-star logo was on the screen I was having trouble with.)Just to play along, I call Apple, and waste some of their money and more of my time.  They quickly confirm this is not their problem.I finally figure out although it would be a nice-to-have to check my account out this way, I can go to their web site, and log in.  It takes me a surprisingly long time (about 20 minutes) to figure out how to \"suspend\" my service.  By this time, I've waited much too long, and I'm going to have to pay them for January, even though I had not used it then.OK, I pay my bills, and now I get a new bill for Mar 25 thru Apr 25.  Whot?  My service is suspended, why are they still billing me?Now the reason for the dud star: I call AT&T;, and get Rep one.  They are very nice, and explain that even though I have suspended my service, I still have to pay.  What I really wanted to do is cancel my service.  Huh?  This is not sounding too much like a faucet anymore.  She suggests that what I REALLY want is what she calls \"Session based\" service.  She can not do that for me, but she will connect me with someone who will.I get put on hold where a recording LOUDLY tries to sell me a new Samsung tablet, repeatedly tells me I can  \"Re-think the Possible\" with AT&T.;  Let me tell you, I've starting to rethink how badly customer service can possibly be at this time.  ....Oh yeah, and there is something in there about not wasting my time too.Rep number two:  I recount my tale of woe,  but she will not have any of it.  First of all, I better get it straight: she does not know where this \"Session based\" phrase I'm throwing around came from, but I better get it straight.  Its called pre-paid, and we will hence-forth ONLY call it pre-paid, so we both know what we are talking about.  OK lady, you're the boss, Pre-paid.  How do I switch my account to Pre-paid, and how do I get this bill cancelled?  Well it turns out they can not just flip a software switch on their end.  The type of service (let's just call it a billing plan) is determined by my SIM card.  You've got that right: even though it is just a stupid serial number in a database, I've got to haul myself down to an Apple or AT&T; store to get a new SIM card, so that they can bill me differently.Apparently WAY back when, when I first signed up with AT&T; (which I think I did on the phone because the web site was too confusing), THAT is when I went off the rails.  That is why my Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature gives me a weird error which three different AT&T; reps have not been able to help me with.  This woman was annoyed with me, and clearly thought it was all my fault for getting myself in to this predicament.  ....But she could not give me help with my bill.  Onward:More annoying \"commercials\":  you know if this Rep loudly read the scripts from these commercials while we waited for the next rep, it would be considered really rude, and nobody would put up with it.  Give me the elevator music please.  I am not calling AT$T because I've got money burning holes in all of my pockets to buy another tablet, I am calling because they are not billing me the way I was promised.Rep number three: I again recount my tale of woe (more quickly this time, so I don't p*ss him off).  Since I'm now in to minute 30 of this call, and that last rep was really testy with me, I'm now asking them to forgive three months for service not consumed.Guess what?  I tell this guy I apparently should have signed myself up for Pre-paid service way back when, and that is why I am here now, and he says: \"Oh you mean Session-based service?\", and proceeds to use the \"Session-based\" term that Rep #2 reprimanded me about for the rest of the conversation.So AT&T;: you are just awful.  When I communicate with you, you use the term \"Phone Number\" when it is not a phone. And I can not make phone calls (or text as far as I know)  You allow me to suspend my service, but you still charge me the same money, whats that all about?  Your own people disagree on what terms should be used for the billing plans.  And we are not talking innocuous terms like \"pop\" vs. \"Soda\", because this is how I got in to this mess.  I signed up for the wrong service, and I suspect it is because your poor discipline with terminology.  And that original error message, why give me a mis-leading error, just put up a screen which say \"You have got a XXX plan, and this info is not available under that plan\".  Cancel/Suspend, Pre-Paid/Session-based. Phone Number/device number.  \"Invalid account\"/Wrong plan type.  Pathetic. And I mean pathetic, not ludicrous, or shameful, or awful.  Pathetic.", "Title": "This iPad is great, but not the AT&T; service you get stuck with", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Author": "Harkanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "R3D8AOAY06VVE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought about getting a tablet a hundred and seventy  eight times before finally buying one. I have a couple of laptops and a mac desktop so I wondered if I really need one. I know it isn't that expensive to own but then I also had 2 iPod Touches. So basically I was going to get the iPad 1 first but then they came out with the iPad 2, I waited several months and then like any man who hates indecision I decided to get a tablet. The choice was simple. I was used to the iPod Touch (4th generation) and thought this would possibly be similar. I was worried it would sit in one corner of my house. To clarify I never needed an iPad, what I did like however the most was the speaker on it. You see, i'm big on music and wanted something that can behave like a traveling jukebox. Besides watching a film when I'm on an airplane  won't be a bad idea either. I was sincerely considering getting the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 but then I knew this thing has been the best selling product of all time so I decided to get it anyway. I've had it for a little over a month now and in the following points i shall speak of the features, some unique and share my findings with you.UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE IPAD 2 -1. At 9.7 inches of diagonal length and brightness that is nothing short of being called exquisite one would imagine this thing to have an average battery or a good battery but the battery life is extraordinary. I use my iPad for a couple of hours daily and I must say that despite music playback, wireless data transferring to the iPad from my mac iTunes library, this thing lasts me for at least 5 days. This is remarkable. I can give you the best device in the world as a manufacturer but if the battery life isn't good what good is it to keep charging it. It does take a very long time to charge mind you which tells you that it's gonna last you a while. For some bizarre reason I like to charge this with my Mac. Charging using the wall outlet is slowly getting primitive.2. The speaker is amazing, it's loud and clear but you have to know where the speakers are placed and it's very important or else it will hamper your experience. Sometimes you have to hold it in your hands to make sure the sound output is ideal. Does it work well placing it on  a flat surface glass or  wood? Yes. What do I use the speaker for? iPod. At 16GB this is just about enough for me to carry a contemporary selection of music  and films with me. Does it sound good while browsing internet pages? Yes. Youtube is exhilarating to say the least. Also only selected Facebook videos will work because many are not available on mobile devices so if something doesn't run on your iPhone or android phone, it may not run on the iPad. Fair trade.3. There are two cameras, both are sub par for 2011 but if you're sitting in a dimly lit room and have washed your face, it may just somehow take a nice photo of you but I seldom take pictures from it. I like to record 30 second to 1 minute videos and email it directly to people. I always keep it connected with my wifi. This is really convenient and is a NEW WAY for me to keep in touch. I never did this with my mac or my iPhone. Also please note an interesting thing here, if your video is too long, your iPad tells you that you cannot send it owing to the large size. I have not gotten into the whole editing video and cutting it thing so what I then resort to is UPLOADING  IT DIRECTLY ON YOUTUBE. Great feature though quality is to be compromised slightly.4. The iPad 2 weighs less than the iPad 1 by a significant amount. This shall be reason enough for people to upgrade or maybe you guys can wait for the iPad 3 to come out in April next year (random estimate)5. While typing on the iPad is a breeze for \"novices\" and \"intermediates\" it is not ideal for a super fast expert typer. Having said that I don't use it much for typing. I am much faster on my phone than I am on the iPad. I have noticed i am able to type best when I am not holding the tablet in my hands and it is resting on a surface. Now I have installed a invisible shield for it because it liked to keep a daily account of fingerprints. Did I find an ideal one? No. I also use an invisible PLASTIGLASS thing for the back which I found on Amazon and found super amazing. The back is so smooth even with this accessory. I find the leather cases a little too pricey and there are several available but I find them kind of obstructing to the design of this iPad and a little cheap so I don't use.6. Great company on an airplane - While I am always fidgeting with this device when it's playing something, the device makes for great company on an airplane provided you have an \"mp4\" type file to play back on it. You can easily install it using iTunes. But if you have  an avi file or a divx file I don't know how to play them or transfer them. The iPad doesn't work as a USB STORAGE device so it won't show up on your finder (or my computer) when connected. There is no way for a user to save files by dragging and dropping. WHILE MANY ARGUE over the relevance of such storage, I believe the absence of it helps in keeping things organized and we all could do with a little less clutter. iTunes works beautifully for transferring stuff. I have noticed on all apple platforms (iPhone, iPod, iPad) that uploading a picture to Facebook involves more steps than on Android. Infact in certain cases Apple makes you buy an application to upload files to Facebook for the iPad. I find this cheek quite amusing but I take it with a pinch of humor. While playing back video you can tilt the device in any which way you want and the screen tilts that way. The video output is superior and the tilt  helps so it makes sure your fingers don't keep smacking into the headset jack when headphones are attached.7. Browsing - Yahoo looks utterly brilliant on the iPad. I love to go  once a day and simply look at their news features. Most search engines have specific websites for the tablets to access em and it looks super. My friend has a Xoom and he loves his tablet and is always talking about it but I see a sincere longing in him for an Apple iPad. The interface is unmatchable whether you are browsing, playing back a video or a song, the iPad wins. I do not use this as a task keeper so I don't bother with office utilities and all. Neither do I edit videos on the iPad but I believe there are inexpensive  solutions available. I read about them all the time on Macworld. Browsing on the internet, watching youtube videos, being on Facebook - it all seems flawless on the iPad. Much better than using a computer or an iPod or a phone. This is where the iPad truly shines. The font and the brightness I repeat is flawless and magical - nothing like i have seen in a dozen years of computers.8. TRANSFER - With the new ios 5.00  and iCloud I can actually send music, video, pictures to the iPad or play them back on my mac without connecting. Another big significant improvement. Now if only I could charge it wirelessly :)9. Are you thinking about getting the 32gb version? Don't. The 16gb is just fine  - for applications you won't need more. Multi-tasking is very easy and truly mastered on the iPad as opposed to the relevance on an iPod or iPhone courtesy of the big screen. Yes there is no flash support so I can't watch imdb trailers directly on the iPad. I have found applications which allow me to download music directly for free on the iPad - I am sure you will too. Netflix works flawlessly on this. I have put 740 songs on it and three films and have 35 applications installed but I still have 3GB remaining. After watching this film once I delete it to keep it free for another. This way you won't need a bigger iPad but if you do the difference is just $100 + Tax. I have also found that there exist many solutions for iPad users to wirelessly connect the iPad with a wireless storage hard drive. The expansion options are super. So take a look into that but I strongly advise getting just the basic  16gb version. I have a 64 gb iPhone and 64gb iPod so maybe I am so adamant on the uselessness of a higher storage iPad too.10. Miscallenous - It works with bluetooth, the iPad is light, unique for browsing, unique for youtube, ultra fast, multitasking is beautiful, you can play music or pandora while browsing, you can also switch the screen off and it will continue singing to you for several hours, the battery life does justice to it's perfections, the cameras are ok, i never Skype using it or i don't use FaceTime cause I don't know many people who do that. I like to carry it in my 13inch laptop case logic bag when I have to. I haven't dropped much water on it because i like it too much to be clumsy  with it. No headphones or instruction manual is  shipped. It took me roughly 30 minutes to set it up by connecting  with my mac.  It comes with a decent amount of charge so you can go 4 hours of playing around with it right out the box.I want you to look at all the above mentioned points and ask yourself if this is a notebook replacement? Obviously not. Because it has no physical keyboard, hdmi out, usb slot but if you are a casual browser, you can invest in this first and use it within the first 30 days to make your mind up. Apple is good that way. Overall - this is by far the best device i have ever used. It beats my iPod, iPhone, android phone, old blackberry, my mac desktop (close  2nd) , my ASUS laptop, my tv, my xbox, my blu ray player, my cameras and even my iron. Good luck.

We have one white 64GB WiFi/AT&T; 3G and one black 16GB WiFi.My family all pooled together to buy my son his iPad 2 (after they saw how he was responding to my 3G version).  Unlike many children with autism, my son has never been very computer or technologically inclined.  His interests have always been with physical and tangible objects and interests (not a bad thing, at all)... but we strongly suspected that the iPad touchscreen would change all of that.There are some remarkable apps for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) - some of which (fortunately) we don't need to use, since my son is very verbal.  That having been said - I have watched how the iPad is completely transforming the lives of his peers who are not very verbal.  Since this isn't a review of the apps, I won't write a whole book about the great apps - except to highlight three that perform really well on the iPad for my son:  1) the \"First Then\" schedule - you can use stock photos, photos you take, or grab them from Google images; 2) Stories2Learn where you can make your own social stories using photos you take; and \"Look in My Eyes\" a game that makes your child look squarely into the eyes of images of children (there is a secret number displayed) that needs to be entered on a next page to get \"prizes\".Okay - so now a review of the iPad itself...For the 64GB wifi/3G model - I swore I would only use it for my son and myself... that I wouldn't get sucked into using it for work (since I am the one who paid for it... right?).  Okay, well that plan lasted all of 3 minutes.  I have all of the attachments now: the VGA connector (used it yesterday to put maps up on the wall during a meeting using our projector); the HDMI connector (which is genius - since it has a 2nd port to provide power using your own AC adapter - and I use this at home and at work to plug into the TVs/LCD displays); the USB and SD Card reader (which imports my photos from my Nikon DSLRs); and my sister bought me the bluetooth keyboard (which I thought would be superfluous - but since I AM actually using this for work ALL OF THE TIME - it comes in very handy).  All of the Apple attachments work great.  Yesterday, I received a cheap non-Apple 2100 mAmp car charger from Amazon - and it works GREAT.  Charges, and I'm not afraid of my iPad battery frying!So, let me get to the two negatives - since that's why YOU are reading this review - right?  You want to figure out what is wrong with this thing... if anything.  The honest truth is that the cameras STINK!!!  Totally, and completely.  So, why give it a 5 star review, right?  The cameras WORK for the purpose that I wanted:  to use facetime to call my sister who lives overseas... and for that - it works passibly well.  Not in low light.  NEVER in low light.  So... I adjust.  Don't call Asia with the lights off!  Problem solved, solution found!  Trying to take photos with the front or back camera - also not great.  REALLY HORRIBLE in the low light conditions I just mentioned.  YET - when you take photos outside in the sunshine - they are actually quite decent.  I'm a photo snob, though - so nothing that didn't come from one of the Nikon DSLRs is suspect to me... DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE HOPING THIS WILL REPLACE YOUR COMPACT DIGITAL CAMERA.  My Blackberry phone camera is a million times better - and I still think that THAT stinks.While I'm on the subject - let's talk about Facetime.  Apple - it's a great product.  I really love it.  HATE that I can't use it on my iMac at home unless I upgrade to Snow Leopard - which I have no intention of doing.  Glad my son now has his own iPad 2 so that I can call him when I'm at work or on the road... So others who are reading this understand - the Facetime App is a billion times better than the Skype app.  Apple made Facetime to work on their computers.  Period.  As such, it takes those not-so-great cameras I just mentioned, and maximizes their abilities and functionality.  If you can call someone Mac to Mac - use Facetime.What else don't I like:  the cost of all of those add ons I mentioned.  Seriously!?!?  My choice to buy them.  I will stop my rant.What I HATE:  the smartcover.  It's horrible.  Don't waste your money on the smart cover!  It's not smart.  I bought the orange - and it's already dirty in the ridges (remember I take this everywhere, and to work... and I work as a project engineering overseeing large dirty and messy job sites) - but the orange was already a sick creamsicle color, but it is just lame.  It doesn't always \"snap\" to the edge with the precision shown in the video commercial.  Just buy something else.  Or save your money.  I am waiting for the Otterbox Defender to come out - since I now realize how much I will travel with this.Everything else - I love.  The list is long, and I won't bore you.  As a child, I dreamed of such a device... and it meets almost all of my desires and wishes for a non-human user interface.  The AT&T; 3G is good enough, don't know if Verizon would have been better... I will always question my decision.  I can watch Netflix - but it doesn't hold coverage on my trainride... but then again, my cell phone from Verizon doesn't either.  There are lots of \"dead zones\" on my train ride to work.  When I'm stationary - in the woods, at a restaurant, in a store - the AT&T; signal is typically strong enough to handle the most demanding streaming.Visually, this object is a stunner.  Physically, this object is a winner:  it feels great in your hands, is responsive to the touch, and it makes everyone want one...I recommend that anyone who has time on their hands buy one.  If you don't have time on your hands, don't buy one, since you will never sleep..... that is my woe...", "Title": "Great for ME & great for  my son who has Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Author": "Craig Whisenhunt", "ReviewID": "R36OU1VJHER2BP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you.  If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this.  I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.Physical CharacteristicsThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin.  More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in  your hand.  One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time.  For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal.  Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device.  In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2.  That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day.  The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.New and \"Improved\"Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB.  What does that mean?  For most casual users, probably not a whole lot.  There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games.  If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements.  If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.The screen is the same for all real purposes.  It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution.  The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next.  In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands.  I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive.  Try not to drop it though.The addition of 2 cameras was expected.  Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras.  Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2.  The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images.  The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad.  For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone.  With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time).  FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon.  This is probably a good thing though.  It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.Smart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful.  Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations.  You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2.  It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.Multitasking SupportOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support.  Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature.  The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well.  That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.AppsOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability.  The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2.  The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses.  There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing.  Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap).  The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.Pros:Weight.  Seriously.  The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion.  It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.Battery Life.  From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook.  That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.Books.  This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way.  The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle.  This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same).  Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window.  If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.Cons:Still no dedicated USB support.  While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage.  Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider.  The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files.  Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.Still no dedicated SD card slot.  This is troublesome on two fronts.  First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around.  Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage.  I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue.  If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.HDMI output.  Really this is a Pro and a Con.  The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter.  All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in.  This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.No Flash Support.  This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games).  Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not.  If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.If you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list.  If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can.  Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release.  They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2.  If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet.  I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1.  I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI.  While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets.  With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors.", "Title": "A Step Closer", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Author": "J. A. Pape", "ReviewID": "R1YOKKMEYNDTIW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've postponed this review for a few months -- waiting to see how useful it would be after the newness wore off. So, the verdict is in:I put it in a black leather case and deliver sermons from it every week (written on a Mac and transferred to the iPad by \"Print to PDF\" at A5 size straight to a Dropbox folder, then transferred on the iPad from Dropbox to iBooks. It takes about 20 seconds). I prefer the iPad to printed sermon notes and wedding outlines because it's more easily hand-holdable, I can use a custom color scheme at no extra charge for ink, the print can be very large, I'm not wasting a bunch of paper, it's lighter, smaller, and more portable than a large-print Bible, and when talking to people after church I've got access to my calendar and address book so I can schedule appointments, get contact information, write reminders for that week's staff meeting, etc., -- all while standing in the foyer greeting members and visitors.I've also used it for presentations by connecting it to a vga projector input at the podium and utilizing the mirrored display. You aren't limited to Keynote for that although it does work well. But I've found it just as useful with iBooks, Bible software, and even YouTube player. The portability is fantastic -- disconnect the video adapter, slap the cover closed and walk away.Daily uses: mileage and expense tracking, keeping track of contacts, calendars & notes, video record-keeping, listening to Texas Rangers baseball broadcasts, web surfing, investment management, reading papers and books, and navigation. It's my favorite device for reading and responding to most emails.It can stand in for a computer in a pinch, which it had to recently when my laptop was put out of commission for a few days by a lightning strike. Using various apps most of the data I need on a daily basis is automatically synced wirelessly between the iPad, iPhone, and MBAir, so I still had my complete calendar and all my appointments (iCal/Google combo), access to all my email (IMAP gmail), all my notes (Evernote), vital documents (Dropbox), and the ability to research and write sermons, articles, and class presentations. It's capable enough that I can get by with leaving my laptop at the office most evenings. Yea!It's far more portable than even my MacBook Air. It's small and discrete enough to take into restaurants, tuck into the console in my car, and take into hospital waiting rooms without appearing insensitive to anxious family members. Instant on and off means you can pick it up to glance at the weather radar, or check an address, or take a note as easily as picking up an iPhone, but the size makes it much faster and easier to enter and view information. It's also large enough to share information with others around you.I use it daily and would replace it within a week if I lost it. 5 stars.", "Title": "SuperPad for a preacher!", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Author": "goonius", "ReviewID": "R30F3IG6LX661G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After playing around an iPad2 in the Apple store, I did a little research, made the leap and bought one.Before I placed my order, I had a few questions about which one I should get: Black or white? Would 16gb be enough, or should I go for 64gb (since it's not like you can add memory to it later)? Or maybe I should take the moderate middle road and get 32gb? I had definitely decided on WiFi, not because 3G doesn't appeal, but because I don't need another monthly bill. What about the Apple-refurbished iPads? Are they as good as the new? Is there any tangible difference? If these are the same questions you have, I'll try to flesh out these answers in detail -- as well as what the iPad is good for -- and what it is decidedly not good for, and what a dedicated PC-user (like myself) should expect from a first-time Apple purchase.THE SPECS:So, Question #1: White or black? I was instantly enamored by the white. It was so... different. And that is the reason to go for white. Perhaps the only one. However, the reasons not to go for white outweigh this almost immediately: Primarily, the contrast of the white does in fact make the screen appear less bright and vibrant (I noted this in the Apple store) and there are reports of light-leakage. I went for black, and have no regrets.Question #2: What size? This was probably the question I spent the most time on, and I felt as if I couldn't get a really good answer for it. Some people seemed to find 16gb to be more than enough, while others said even 64gb wasn't enough. I almost bought the 16gb, but ended up compromising and getting a 32gb refurbished from Apple for the same price as the new 16gb. And I'm really glad I did, because I've already used more than the 14.4gb -- which is the usable space available one the 16gb.The 16gb, I've discovered, would have been ideal for someone only using apps and browsing the internet. Forget using it for music or movie storage, it's just not happening. On my iPad I have about 80 apps currently, consuming 5.6gb of space. Contrast that with the 1300 songs I have on there which are taking up about 8gb of space, and you'll see what I mean about 16gb being an apps-only device. So, if you already have an iPod, say, then it might make sense to get the 16gb.The 32gb is ideal for apps and storing a moderate music library, something I never would have anticipated using the iPad for -- but it turns out, I always have my iPad in my car, and find it much more convenient overall than my CDs. I've even gotten rid of an old stereo I used to play CDs on in the house. They're just kind of obsolete once you switch to storing tunes on an i-device.The 64gb, I imagine would be perfect for storing a little of everything: Music, movies and apps. I'm actually glad I didn't go for the 64gb, as I'm perfectly happy with YouTube or streaming Netflix for a nominal monthly fee (more on this in a moment).Question #3: Is a refurbished iPad as good as a new one? Although I don't have a new one to compare, I'm going to say yes -- with one minor caveat. The refurbished iPads have new glass, a new back cover, a new battery, the same 1 year warranty, and go through the same rounds of testing that a new iPad goes through (if you buy from Apple directly, of course). And when you think about it, why wouldn't this be just as good as getting a new iPad? After all, even a new one could have flaws that might become apparent in the first year of ownership. There aren't guarantees with any device, and when you can knock 20% off the price and make a vote for recycling electronics -- better for the Earth -- why not do it, right? Oh, and the caveat? There are a couple of times I have come across some settings that were clearly from the previous user which is... a little odd. Nonetheless the pros outweigh this, so far as I'm concerned.All, told, if I had it to buy over again, I'd make precisely the same choices as this time: Black, 32gb, wifi, refurbished. So, onto the device itself....__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________THE IPAD:This is my first i-device, and I have always been a PC (Windows) user in the past, so it's an entirely new experience to me. I bought it primarily because when laptop shopping I ended up getting a fantastic deal on this behemoth of a wide screen laptop. Not portable at all... so what about when I'm at the coffee shop or the bookstore and I want to tinker around, check my mail, Facebook, etc. Here's where the idea of getting an iPad came in for me. I wanted an easy-to-carry, reasonably-sized, aesthetically pleasing (and here's where the competing devices were blown out of the water) device to fill my portable computing needs.Interestingly, some of the things I initially bought the iPad for are the same areas where the iPad falls short. I knew there would be no flash capability, and so expected this. In truth, it's not been much of an issue, and YouTube is way better on the YouTube-dedicated iPad program than it is on my flash-enabled Windows 7 laptop. But its the simple demands that are over-complicated by the iPad. Email is a bit tedious. Like the way that you can only delete one item at a time, see one folder at a time, can't do certain things like 'star' an email to make the level of importance or permanently relegate something to a junk mail category. Note: This refers to the included email program, but even if you do your email through Safari there's going to be a lot of awkward pinch-zooming to awkwardly replace the awkward lack of functions in Apple's email program. Similar issues arise with the Facebook app: It's hard to see who's online, for one thing. I can't share a story from someone else's wall to my own, and most infuriatingly -- if I post a comment, and hit enter too soon (easy to do with the on-screen keyboard layout-- backspace and send are way too close to one another) I can find no way of deleting it -- aside from opening Facebook in a browser window and trying to navigate the too-small text and awkward formatting, when this should be a an obvious and simple maneuver on the iPad app for Facebook. This is true of many apps that replace simple browsing, from eBay to Amazon to social networking. Most are beautiful, well-laid out, and missing at least one (often more) necessary function. And speaking of function, while zooming is a simple task, cutting and pasting is beyond annoying -- so much so that I often say 'hell with it' and don't bother copying things I otherwise would have. Apple needs to overhaul that function.It is the aesthetic beauty of the iPad that rescues it from a lesser star rating based on the lack of functionality inherent in some its apps/programs. I tried the Kindle Fire in the store and found it to be visually lacking in comparison -- and much slower as well. Meanwhile, the iPad is lightening fast with just about any task you set forth to do. It makes my laptop with better specs look like a dinosaur in contrast. The screen is breathtakingly beautiful (and unless you're trying to close out lots of open apps, incredibly responsive). It's so fun to just look at that you will find yourself wanting to store a photo library on there just to view the pictures on it. I love having pictures of my kids to show off on here for the older relatives at family get-togethers. It's definitely better than a traditional photo album -- and that sentiment comes from someone who is rather old-fashioned about anti-technological items like physical photo albums. Side note: My 300 moderately-sized photos are only eating about .5g of space. Another side note: The camera, while not graphically amazing, takes some of the speediest photos I've encountered with a digital device.Just as the iPad is able to display unparalleled beauty with photos, its video display is equally amazing. Since I care little for large-screen televisions, watching movies on here has actually made me consider getting rid of our two televisions. Netflix is convenient, the resolution and sound are perfect, and although the selection for streaming is quite limited, it fills our equally limited television needs. I haven't watched a single show on the television since I received the iPad, but I have watched the entire first season of Downton Abbey -- at my own convenience -- which was quite a luxury.Lastly, the apps that are built *specifically* for the iPad: The games (like Contre Jour, Angry Birds, Cut the Rope), Garage Band, and Drawing Pad are awesome toys to have on hand --and affordable (as well they should be, considering the cost of the device itself). There are endless free apps to play around with, download, play with a bit and often delete -- occasionally saving the really exceptional ones. This is a great bonus to owning the iPad. My husband has an iPod touch, and the apps are far more interesting on the iPad.There are even a number of educational apps that I didn't expect. I'm not one for computing for kids in most instances, and we stay away from all that LeapFrog and VTech madness -- instead opting for books. But I've been so impressed with apps like Solar Walk and Star Walk that I've been willing to make an exception. They're magical, and present really difficult concepts like the universe in a understandable way.Despite the iPad having some glaring flaws, I would buy it again. I believe now -- as I did when I chose it -- that it is the best tablet available. I can't stress how much I love perfection of the display. I've been pleasantly surprised by the unexpected things which it has been so handy for. I'd have loved to have known about its flaws in advance, which is why I write this review -- I hope someone else will go into their purchase feeling more informed and confident about their decision than I felt when I ordered mine. But if I had it to do again, I am pleased to say I'd make the same decisions all over again, so it was an easy 4 stars.", "Title": "Pros & Cons + Defining the Difference between 16gb, 32gb, & 64gb", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Author": "Artlover \"Experience It All\"", "ReviewID": "R35HWMRSKXH9XA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're deciding whether or not to buy an iPad 1 or iPad 2, you may want to read this first.  I've had an iPad 1 for 9 months.  Before I bought it, I doubted how much I would use it.  It had no hard drive, USB connectors, DVD player, camera, full keypad, ability to load major business software apps, ability to play flash-developed graphics, and it did not have much storage and memory space.  I wondered how it could be useful to me, since I had many Apple products - Mac Pro, Macbook Pro, iPhone, Mobile Me, Airport, Time Capsule, etc.To my delight the iPad provided 100x my wildest expectations.  Once you start using it for searching the Web and researching just about everything you do, you realize how much more you can get out of the Web and Internet every day.  You begin making tons of use of the Web and it makes you become way more productive in life (home, autos, service providers, education, children, parenting, illness, job, professionally, etc., etc., etc.).  It ends up becoming an extension of your hand, mind, and life.  It doesn't take you over, it merely helps you with everything you do.Email is also a different experience using an iPad.  You find yourself no longer reading email on your phone or computer.  You end up having your iPad with you, no matter where you are.  Email is extremely easy to read and is organized in way never thought possible.  I bring it in stores, theaters, healthcare providers, hair salon, work, lunch, and e v e r y w h e r e !!  it's way too easy to use and to make you much more productive.All this, and I haven't even gotten to the thousands of extremely useful and productive apps, movies, podcasts, music, etc., available (via iTunes).  You can have every type of app, from sophisticated business intelligence dashboard software to first class presentation software, to science, astronomy, and tons of world-class games.  All in addition to the new extension to your brain and hand (mentioned above).  So, don't get hung up about USBs, DVDs, and hard disks.  You can get a VGA cable, external camera connection cable, and a myriad of cases and multi-use devices.  You will not even want your regular computer after a month.  iPad 2 brings us to a new level, with two cameras, 2x the speed, thinner/lighter, and great new OS features.  If you try an iPad for 30 days, you will never want tp be without it.  I do not sell iPads and I have NO affiliations with Apple or their resellers.  Load the Auryn Ink app and use a Nomad brush.

In bed, on the couch in front of the TV, and definitely for traveling-- this is a great accessory for checking email, Facebook, and browsing the web. The interface is simple and the display is great.The cons are minimal. As an e-reader, the backlit display is hard on the eyes, so I find myself going back to my Kindle with its e-ink screen. And I find myself reminded that the iPad is probably closer to an iPhone than a computer because it limits some of the videos you may want to see since there is no way to get the Flash Player plug-in, which so many sites require. YouTube and Netflix, however, work just fine.  Although it was a bit frustrating when I paid for in flight wifi on a plane yesterday and still could not properly load a Netflix video.Overall, though, the iPad does exactly what it says it will do, which is giving the user a computer experience more personal and portable than a laptop.

I was originally against it and bought the Asus Transformer first. It's not the greatest thing in the world, but the operating system and features are good in their own way. I might one day sell it and buy a Prime, since I like certain things about Android better. The main part that I don't like is the speed it operates at. (Lags a lot). But this is not about Android; it's about the iPad.Ok, so the main reason that I was against the iPad and Apple products was it's use of slave children to make them and the exclusivity of the operating system. Slave children part? Still an issue. But the main reason I ended up buying one was the promise of Apple of making textbooks for college available on them. I had waited so long for it, too. How convenient is that? No more aching back and such. SSOOOOOOOO nice! And the exclusivity of the operating system? It's honestly not as bad as people had made it out to be. For the most part, things work really well in all aspects for the iPad and there's really only a few websites that I have gone to that don't play videos. I don't play flash games, so that's not an issue. But for reals, the iPad has the best apps and they're tailored specifically for it. The best example is Splashtop, which remotely accesses your computer. It certainly is NOT optimized for the Transformer. The greatest thing is that I can actually watch movies streamed from my computer in bed! When it comes to the processing power, I have been told that the components are the same for both of my tablets, but the iPad plays streaming video a whole lot better. And it also does just about everything better.....except for the widgets. Why can't Apple design widgets for the iPad??? That's why I like the operating system of Android better, plus you can customize it better and surf files better and generally get a more user-oriented experience. Once again though, the apps for iPad ARE better and there ARE more of them, (though not a whole lot). It quickly does hit a brick wall and the apps fall dramatically in quality. Most of the apps that are truly useful, you will find on both. Itunes though is a b*tch and I truly do not enjoy using it. This cuts back to the point I made that files are easier to work with on Android products. If you can climb successfully up the iTunes learning curve, you will do well, but you shouldn't enjoy it, if my experience is anything to go on. So, that's about all I have to rant about right now. If you're like me, you'll just blow your money and get an Apple product AND and Android product. Both good, but for now, the iPad is MUCH better. I swear, sometimes I just want to hold it and fall asleep with it. Oh, and just as a quick afterthought, the next generation of iPads need more quick-access buttons, just like Android. There should be a menu button, back button, (that doesn't just take you back to the main screen), and a quick-switch multitasking button. If they did this, the iPad would truly reign supreme.

Hui", "ReviewID": "R3HY8KYKA5S8WX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I initially didn't upgrade my iPad 1 to the 2nd generation as it was \"good enough\" for my needs. But as time went by and iOS5 was released I found my iPad 1 a bit lacking... Safari would often crash and more recent games such as Infinite Blade (the first one) wouldn't even load without crashing. It was becoming that I was getting a bit miffed with my iPad so I sold it off recently to wait for the iPad 3. Without an iPad in my life there was a bit of a void and I took advantage of one of the many resllers of the iPad 2 in the Marketplace. I found a great deal for a perfectly mint condition iPad and I have to say I am loving my iPad 2. No more crashing, the iPad 2 is really FAST and I feel it will be a bit more \"future proof\" for next year's iOS6 and even iOS7.Though it doesn't have the rumored retina display of the iPad 3 I feel that if you can get an iPad 2 for less than retail price right now it is well worth the purchase, even this close to the release of the next incarnation. Not to mention that a retina display for a device this large is less important than on an iPhone where the image size is much smaller. The only thing a Retina display will improve is the reading of ebooks and honestly not by that much. It's not as if it goes from illegible to crystal clear, just slightly more crisp... and for my needs not as necessary since I don't read much on my iPad to begin with. Also remember higher resolution also means more battery usage... so unless they put a bigger battery in the next iPad the battery life will be impacted. If they put a larger battery then the iPad 3 itself will be larger.Which leads to another thing I love about the iPad 2, the size! It is insanely thin compared to the first iPad and quite a bit lighter in hand. Now my left arm will have less of a work out when I'm standing and working on the iPad. :PMirroring with an Apple TV is beyond fun and a great feature for those of you who want a HTPC but don't want to deal with the high prices of Mac Mini or a Windows HTPC. Now I can surf the web on my TV and stream (soon to be) any video found on the internet. As Apple declared Flash video is on the down swing and soon it'll bow out of the way to h.264 as the go to streaming media format.The iPad 3 will no doubt be great... and I'm sure I will upgrade to it too... NEXT winter.I paired my iPad with the perfect;KHOMO DUAL CASE: Grey Polyurethane Smart Cover FRONT + Hard Rubberized Poly-carbonate BACK Protector for Apple iPad 2(I found one \"used-like new\" from Warehouse deals for $17.99)Originally I had the Incase Magazine Case for my iPad which the Apple Smart Covers and this case mimics. Though there were features on the Magazine case that I will miss (3rd standing option that was between the vertical mode and the keyboard mode) this is by far the best looking feeling and quality full body protection that I have seen for any of the iPads. I loved the idea of the Smart Cover but hated the price and the fact there was no back protection. Also heard that the magnetic connectors end up scratching the iPad and falls off easily, this is not something I wanted.Very happy with my purchase and am glad I got myself this great Xmas gift.", "Title": "Decent upgrade from iPad 1", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Author": "djrolandg", "ReviewID": "R37M46U7TN21KB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking mobility?

After trying to decide between the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and iPad 2, I pulled the trigger on the iPad 2 (16GB, Wi-Fi, Black) and have yet to regret my decision.Pros:*Apps - The best feature about the iPad is the App Store, and this was the deciding factor for me. On a smartphone, there's a bit more to consider than apps (call quality, carrier, camera quality-in my opinion, pointless on a tablet-,etc.), but on a tablet, it's all about the functionality delivered through tablet-optimized apps.*Design - The iPad 2 is very thin, light, and has a nice aluminum finish on the back. The only comparably sized tablet is the Galaxy Tab 10.1.*Screen - The screen is great, especially in terms of quality and contrast. It's a 9.7\" IPS screen with a 1024x768 resolution.*Battery life - Excellent. It has the best battery life of tablets (Galaxy Tab 10.1 comes close). To get an idea, it lasts for days with some gaming/web browsing each day.*Accessories - Because the iPad is basically the epitome/name-brand of tablets at the moment, if there's a tablet accessory, it's compatible with the iPad.*Resale value - If I decide to sell it later to upgrade to the inevitable iPad 3, I know it will maintain most of its value.Cons:*Cameras - Although I will probably never use them, the cameras on the iPad 2 are horrible.*Screen - Competitor tablets have a bigger 10.1\" screen, but my biggest complaint is the lower resolution of the iPad (1024x768 vs 1280x800). The resolution difference is more important because it would've allowed for more content to be displayed which is espeically important for web browsing.*Apple's proprietary ports - The non-standard ports lead to some overpriced adapters and accessories.*Apple's \"walled garden\" aka iTunes - To most people this isn't a big deal, but some people will be annoyed about having to use iTunes. Personally, I don't mind iTunes, but I hate only having Apple-approved apps available in the App Store.

Please.The iPad can be used for almost anything we normal people do- reading, entertainment, shopping, surfing the web. No flash?? True....but really, there are not that many instances that pop up where the lack of Flash is a problem. If it were a real problem, then Apple would not have sold tens of millions of the device thus far. I don't know about others but I know my company switched their entire website to one with HTML 5- good bye Flash. I'm guessing that's going to happen more and more. It has no USB or video out ports?? Ok....then don't buy it! It's amusing how people \"purchase\" the iPad and then moan and complain that it has no USB port or HDMI out ports. Really?

Plus right now they are engraving it for free. iPad 2 - 16 for 499.00, w/ 3G 629.00. You can even go to Walmart and get it for that price. I also thought that ALL iPads had to be sold at the same price - I could be wrong here, because I heard that through a friend. I don't know how long of a wait shipping is here, but as of this writing, my delivery date would be July 22-24.So, if you don't mind the wait and you want the best deal for your iPad 2, Apple is the best bet. Or play it by ear and hope Walmart has one in stock and get it the same day.PS. My 5 stars rates the actual iPad itself. It's a great tool and I absolutely love it. Goes anywhere and the fact I can FaceTime with friends across state/ country is totally Star Trek, (I mean, this man totally knew what was coming. In the 60's, can you imagine.)I originally bought the 32GB with wi-fi only. Figured since you are not bound by a contract, (ie. 2 years to subscribe) I would get the 3G just in case I ever wanted that feature. You cannot upgrade.

Williams", "ReviewID": "R340UD6CAFHE49", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love my Ipad2. It is fast, very reliable and stable, and just plain fun.  But there are a few things that keep it from being perfect.  First, as other reviewers have commented, the camera is the pits and really not up to Apple's ususal outstanding quality.  The second issue, in my opinion, is the slick aluminum back side material.  It looks pretty but really necessitates a case because it is slippery and without a means to get a better grip, it is only a matter of time before the inevitable fall.  I found the same problem with my Iphone.  It would be a much better devise if Apple used a rubberized type material on the back.  I spent alot of time comparing the Ipad2 with the Motorola Xoom at Best Buy before making my purchase, and I really don't think you could go wrong with either tablet.  The Xoom has a far better camera and does flash which might be a big plus if you are really into video and gaming. But flash also comes at a cost in performance and stability which is exactly why Apple doesn't use it.  The Ipad2 seems more intuitive to me and just seems to work better and do things quicker. But I have to admit that my familiarity with Iphone may partly influence my opinion on that point. Ipad also has many more apps available at the moment. One other drawback though,in my opinion, is the need to tether the Ipad to Itunes. I understand their logic, but I really wish it had a simpler PC-Ipad interface. Honestly if I didn't already have an Iphone I might have been inclined to buy the Xoom, but that's not taking anything away from the Ipad2 - it is a great tablet!", "Title": "Great Tablet But Not Perfect", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Author": "H. Wang \"nycmode\"", "ReviewID": "R1FCQ0XY5I8VMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "By now there are plenty of reviews that offer the pros and cons of the iPad 2 versus other tablets on the market.  With that in mind, I've decided to focus this particular review only for those of you who are in the same boat as me - which is debating whether or not to upgrade to an iPad 2 from the first gen iPad.After giving it much thought, I recently took the plunge and I am 100% sure that I made the right decision.  However, this is only in the context of how I use the tablet, which is primarily for gaming and other graphic intensive apps.  Previously I owned the AT&T; 3G iPad with 32GB of memory.  After giving it much thought, I decided to purchase the wi-fi only 64GB iPad 2, since I realized I don't actually used the 3G much.Most of the apps I use are very graphic intensive.  EA games such as Dead Space, FIFA 11 ... or Gameloft games such as Order & Chaos, Starfront, and Dungeon Hunter ... I play those games often and noticed a HUGE difference after I transferred my data to the iPad 2.  The games run much better, and there is a major change in terms of performance.  There is much less slowdown, and FIFA 11 actually plays like the way it should - fast and crisp (and not slow and turgid, like it was when I was playing the exact same game on the first gen iPad).  In cases like this - having the faster processor and added RAM makes a huge difference.Now if you're the kind of person who plays simpler, less graphic intensive games like Angry Birds, Diner Dash or World of Goo, you will probably not notice anything different.  You also won't really notice any difference if you stream or purchase videos as the display is the same as before.  Sorry, but no retina display this time around.But what you will be pleased with is the fact the iPad 2 is far lighter than it's predecessor.  This is important for those of you who spend a lot on the iPad playing games (like me).  It was no secret that the previous iPad was bulky and difficult to hold.  It also made it very tiring to grab the device for an extended period of time (making it difficult to play intense FPS or sports game without frequent rest periods).  The iPad 2's weight makes it much easier to hold and less burdensome to play games for a long time.  Long story short, my hands don't feel numb as often as I did when I used the old iPad.As for the other bells and whistles such as the camera/face time, etc ... all of that is well and good.  The interface is easy to figure out, so there isn't much brain surgery involved.  The smart cover is also a nice touch, though it's not a necessity.  I personally have one though, and I like it very much.So the biggest question here is - should you upgrade to iPad 2 if you already own one?  If you are a die hard gamer, the answer is 100% absolutely yes.  The difference in performance is absolutely striking and you will see the benefits of upgrading within seconds (so long as you play games that take advantage of the upgrade - i.e. games w/high production value).Even the apps I run outside of games run noticeably smoother and faster.  Using video/graphic intensive apps like CNN or ESPN XL is a snap, and they run much faster than on my previous iPad.In short, should you upgrade from the iPad to the iPad 2?1. If you play hardcore, graphic-intensive games - YES, upgrade ASAP2. If you run a lot of apps at the same time, like to use video/graphic intensive apps - YES, upgrade3. If you run apps that aren't that taxing (lighthearted games like Angry Birds, simple interface apps), or use the ipad to mostly surf, write email, etc - NO, upgrading is not necessary unless you have cash to spare (save your $$ for the iPad after the iPad 2 IMO).That's my 2 cents for folks on the fence.  Good luck!", "Title": "For those of you on the fence ...

It does everything and i've been impressed with it in the 2 months that i've owned it so far.  I use it primarily as my internet browser, an e-reader, and to stream Netflix.  It's a revolutionary  product for me.  The iPad has replaced my laptop as my go-to for internet.  I no longer take my laptop with me on business trips.  The iPad does everything I need.  It doesn't replace the need for a computer, but it does allow me to travel without my laptop and to leave the laptop in the office (or the kitchen where it usually lives) when I want internet access on the couch.Here are some of the key features that I use:The web browser is the real deal.  It's full internet and not a mobile browser.  I like surfing the web on my iPad better than on my computer because the touch screen and gestures are very intuitive.Facetime and Skype look great and are easy to use with the dual cameras.  It's nice to be on the road and be able to see my daughter any time I have an internet connection (Facetime requires WiFi, but you can Skype on the 3G).As an e-reader, I haven't used it to read a full book yet, but I do often use iBooks to crunch PDF files that I use for work.  It allows you to search and bookmark.  The bookmarks then transfer to your iPhone via MobileMe.  It's nice because I have literally thousands of pages of regulations and tech orders at my fingertips in a very portable format.  The backlight screen is nice when reading in a dark environment and I've found it comfortable to use when reading for 15-20 minuets.  I haven't read any longer than that, so I don't know if it will cause eye fatigue over a longer period.Video looks great.  64GB is plenty of space.  I'm currently carrying 17 movies, about 11 GBs of music, 10 GBs of Apps, all of my books and I still have about 20 free GBs to load anything else.  I could probably have gotten away with the 32 GB model.Netflix streaming is awesome!  They have a great selection and the app looks really good.Games on the iPad are really fun.  I have a few board games and you can sit across from someone and use the iPad as your Monopoly board.  The large display makes it a pretty social device.The news apps look really good and have the feel of reading a magazine.Pros - It does everything.  It looks good, is very light and the battery performance is fantastic.  Apple's claim of 10 hrs of use is true.  The battery really lasts a long time.  The 3G service is a good deal.  I don't always use it, so you can set the 3G up to \"pay as you go\".  If you need to use the 3G, you can enter your credit card info right into the iPad and sign up for a month of service.  It's $15 for 250 MB and $25 for 2GB.  You can cancel without a penalty and there's no long term commitment.Cons - Price.  The iPad is expensive, and you could buy a laptop for the same price (or cheaper).  It's a great device and I think it's worth it, but the price is pretty steep.  Lack of Flash support, which is common to all iOS devices.Overall, I really love my iPad, I use it for everything and I take it with me routinely.", "Title": "I love my iPad!", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Author": "Michael Schultz \"avid9er\"", "ReviewID": "R3R2CFGSWMG71T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been wanting one of these since they came out.

Like most people, I use the iPad 90% of the time on just a few Apps. For me, reading an ebook, checking stock quotes, and reading the news constitute most of what I do. It's good to have half a million Apps, but it's impossible to use that many, or even a fraction of that. I've compared the iPad to the Kindle for reading ebooks. For me, the iPad is the clear winner. In my opinion, the iPad is easier to read and is sharper, also the color is a plus. The Kindle is hard to read in low light. Maybe if you are outside, the Kindle would have the edge, but I never read outside, and I think most people don't (possibly some do at the beach). I have an iPad 1 with WiFi and 3G, and an iPad 2 with WiFi only. I think the WiFi is the way to go because of the cost savings. Sometimes the 3G is nice, but I don't use it that often.

I'm actually writing this review with it right now! A lot of people I know have criticized the iPad for being like the iPhone or iPod Touch, and I have to say while a lot of features are similar to my 3GS (don't own a touch), there are a lot of features which differ. I have had so much fun typing the screen of the iPad, I spent hours with the yahoo app talking to one of my friends while I installed my other apps. I am a college student and plan to use the iPad instead of my computer at school so I don't kill my back walking to class. I'm not the most tech savvy, but I know my way around the iPad from having my 3GS and love the simplicity of the device.  Besides, you can't beat the awesome of having almost full functionality of web pages through safari on the iPad. I continually get frustrated with my phone's version. I am not a fully converted Apple person since I still own a Sony Vaio and prefer the solidarity of The Sims 3 on PC. I also used a Mac last semester in school, and I just couldn't get used to it.I also REALLY love how much faster the iPad 2 is compared to the 3GS. It may not be a fair comparison but I also added 6 gigs if ram to my laptop so I could have a faster machine. I hate lag.Oh! Not having adobe flash hasn't fazed me one bit. I don't really understand the argument about that one but the iPad has no trouble playing YouTube videos in safaris browser. It doesn't take you to the YouTube app like on the iPhone. I almost bought the Sony tablet which was recently released but I didn't feel like getting all my apps all over again since  I already own popular ones like angry birds. iTunes on the iPad has similar functionality to the program on the pc, and I'm assuming Mac, and I out most of the songs from my husbands accout in here. I also have never used a honey comb based tablet so iOS and iPad I went. iOS 5 installed in under 30 minutes for me.I have accidentally hit the back button in here twice with the iPad-the screen is extremely sensitive-and I don't think I can leave anything more useful for others considering the iPad, so I'll wrap it up. I got the 32 gig iPad in black and I've had a hard time putting it down. I'm also using a reflex series Otterbox and never plan on removing it from the iPad.

They provide you a very portable second screen. I happened to pick the iPad 2 after a lot of research with other tablets.I am away from home a lot during the day for work and class and also at night as I study. As a college student and future programmer I love having the iPad as a second screen. I can have my Kindle and PDF textbooks, web tutorials or HTML help apps open on the iPad as I type notes and program on my laptop. I am not constantly having to minimize or switch between windows on my laptop screen, which is pretty nice. I can also have Netflix, the ABC app or Hulu playing as I do homework. The small size of the iPad allows for me to slip it right into the same case as my laptop, awesome! They have some laptops now that have a pull out second screen but it seems to be an expensive option that leaves no other features like the iPad (or another tablet) does.iPads also have a lot of other fun features besides providing you with more screen real-estate when you aren't doing homework or programming!The End*I am a fan of Apple, have been since the early 90's when in 1st grade I was blown away by the amazing Oregon Trail (yes I know it was MECC software) on the IIGS in all it's green glory. I now own many Apple products. I am also a fan of Microsoft, work on Win XP and 7 at work everyday and have no issues with Windows. I also play pretty hard on the Xbox 360 in my down time.

I, like a lot of other sheep, went out and quickly spent about $650 on this thing. Then I was told by Apple,for an additional $150 I could get two years worth of technical support which I gladly gave up. What they did not tell me was that I would have to be on a complete LEARNING CURVE( which they did not even understand themselves!) to use this product. First, let me say, don't waste your money on any Apple technical support gimmicks. I had some valuable notes stored on my Ipad 2 to do a convention with about three days before this happened. I went to Apple technical support because my e-mail did not work on my Ipad 2.Then they instructed me on how to delete my notes and \"wake up my e-mail\". I said, \"won't I lose all my notes?\" She said \"No, one has nothing to do with the other\". My response was \"Are you sure? I really need these notes for my speaking engagement at the convention\". She said \"No way you'll lose anything. Trust me\". What she should have said is: \"I'm an Apple tech support person, who gets paid by the hour, and it's no skin off my nose if you lose your notes or not!\". And that's exactly what happened. As per her instruction....I lost all of them. I was devastated. I had to spend days,scrambling to recovering at lease some of my lost notes. I will never get back what I lost...ever. I didn't know that everything on an Ipad 2 had had to be backed up to a REAL COMPUTER(notice I said: REAL COMPUTER). I was never told this. Now, that there have been so many failures and complaints about this product I understand they've created a thing called \"cloud\", which does the same thing....backs up your files. You will do better to buy a smaller version of a laptop and don't fall for the nonsense,like I did, that this is a great buy.....because it's not.Wondering if my e-mail was ever fixed? After spending six hours on the phone with Apple and completely losing my notes and going through the process to \"restart\" my e-mail 6 times..... guess what? It still doesn't work!!! If Apple tech support is the standard for which other companies should model themselves,then we have NO STANDARD.

I wonder at how something so weak could be so popular. I now see why there are so many Apps available that use work-around methods to try to make up for the lack of a more complete system.I bought an Apple II in the early `80s and soon had to learn to use workaround routines to produce acceptable results. When the IBM PC became available I bought one and discovered what a well-executed operating system was like. I used Microsoft DOS for 8 years before changing to Windows 3.1 which was slowly developed into the present Windows 7 version.It looks like Apple is repeating the same cycle with the IPAD2. The system is so restrictive it limits any chance of even limited productivity. If you're only interested in playing games, email or rather poor quality photo images and video then you'll probably like the Ipad2. I will admit it's very stylish which is probably a big help with sales but you can't tell a book by its cover.

The head supervisor there confirmed that the policy and design of Apple is such that itleaves no options with the customer, but to re-buy another piece even if the touch screen is cracked.In my case, the screen got cracked due to keeping the iPad under my pillow after my night time reading. They requested me to send the picutures of the cracksand said that the cracks are due to external pressure and hence do not come under warranty, leaving me with no other option but to not use the Apple iPadanymore due to safety reasons. I am left only with this option because I dont want to buy another same product in its replacement. I can as well buy similarproduct from other company's offering.I even offered to give back the product and give me atleast some money. But they said that Apple doesn't have repurchase policy in India.In addition, the other known Apple issues like unable to play videos ( due to non compatibility of flash player), low sound, no external ports provided likeHDMI, USB etc. The maintenance is also a rip-off. Please note that you will have to buy seperate Apple accessories if you desire to have ports to connectwith other non-Apple devices. Even the sound is low to inspire customer to buy external speakers.The intersting thing is that other similar products inmarket have these things built in.Having burnt my hands after buying my first \"Apple\" product, I have decided not to buy any future Apple products and highly recommend not to waste so much of anybody's hard earned money to buy such a product.

I received the IPad 2 as a gift from my daughters.  When I first opened the IPad2, it was WOW.  Now that I have used it for 2 weeks, here is my opinion.  It SUCKS.  No offense to the IPad lovers.  Here are the reasons:The IPad2 lists at $499 with a puny 16GB memory.  After you load a few apps, your memory is down to say 14 GB.  There is not much you can hold with only 14GB...music, videos, pictures nowadays eat up a ton of memory.  If you want a higher memory, you have to buy the 32 or 64GB, at $599, and $699 respectively.  And even so, the last time I had a 64GB storage capacity is when I had my Atari Computer back in the 80's (ok..i'm exaggerating..but you get the point).  Apple calls 64GB a progress?  And some people hail Steven Jobs as the great innovator?  This is going backwards in time.The IPad storage capacity is NOT UPGRADABLE.  You have to sell the old one and buy a new one.  This is how Steve Jobs made a lot of money, off of a lot of unsuspecting customers.  What puzzles me is why do some continue to patronize such marketing program.There are a few things you can do to overcome the small storage, such as, carry a bunch of SD cards, preload it with files and use the camera kit to view.  Some suggest using an external harddrive which you again have to preload with the files you intend to use.  Others suggest using online data storage which you have to pay, somewhere between $10-30/month, and mind you, you have to be online to access these files...so if you do not have WIFI or 3G access, you are SOL.If I have to do the above to gain storage, what have I gained from IPad2?  I thought the IPad2 is about ease of portability?  Not to mention the additional money one has to spend on the additional accessories.The 3G data capability adds $129 to the IPad2.  Bear in mind, you still have to subscribe to the 3G data.  If you are on the go, the 3G would be helpful.  However, the 3G is not all dependable depending on where you're at.  The 3G signals in China, Hongkong, and Macau were unreliable.  In mainland China, I was able to get \"some\" 3G data, but none is HongKong and Macau, even when there were strong signals....something to do with prioritization...they give their local subscribers priority, and you get the scrap signal (This is according to T-Mobile).  Maybe this only happens in China.IPad has NO ethernet cable connection.  While it appears that more and more places are now going WIFI, there are still a lot of good hotels using ethernet cables.  Sometimes you have to go to the lobby (a great inconvenience) to get your best WIFI signal (so, being able to use the ethernet cable in the room would be more convenient).  And there are still a few hotels that don't offer WIFI.  Then what?  You are SOL, unless you bring your own WIFI router.  So I ask again, if I have to bring a router for these rare occasions, am I not defeating the purpose of the ease of portability?The IPad2 was not able to open a video clip from my Canon T2i (format is .mov).  Later I hear Ipad only supports apple video formats.  It does not run Flash based content.  It does not run Java.  What the?I still thank my daughters for gifting me the IPad2.  At the least it brought me up to date with technology...I know what I'm not missing...I can say I know what it is...and I can speak intelligently about the Ipad...it's overrated.", "Title": "OVERRATED", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Author": "angela scott", "ReviewID": "RNDLIK2AOFOX5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wanted to return this item and company was giving me a hard time about it.

I'm not going to treat the iPad as some sort of godlike creation, I am going to give the most straight review I can: the iPad isn't that great.Heres the things I will go into detail about: First of all,its got graphic capabilities that are about halfway to Playstation PSP and Nintendo DS, so its game's are pretty,but they aren't anything to get excited about.Next up, its App market is great. But the problem with it...well, I'll get to that.The hardware itself.. that's where i got a bone to pick.It slipped out of my hands one day and it hit my tile floor,and the screen cracked. And the same thing happened to my friend: but his was in a protective case. These things are fragile, which makes me wonder why anyone would trust these things to a kid under 5.Speaking of fragile,ive dropped the ipad on -carpet- before and the video output on the screen turned green and well.. broken. If you want to see this for yourself: Google \"iPad Green screen problem\".Finally, I bet you are wondering: What about those apps I bought? My ipad still sounds usuable,so I still use them,right?Well, yes,and no. The thing is when I dropped my iPad,I was -moving- it. I still use all my apps,but the only good ones i got from it were universal: So when I say i'm using them,I mean on my iPhone.So,to bring it all back home: Its just an overpriced piece of technology that you probably will stop using after 6 months, give or take how much you have to pour into it to find uses for it.", "Title": "Buyer Beware.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Author": "Unsatisfied", "ReviewID": "R3KQ2RVUZ6PHYM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My order was an Ipad 2 refurbished, big mistake!!
