But I am frustrated with a lot of issues:1. I bought this along with Amazon's Origami case which automatically wakes up when you open the cover and puts it to sleep when you close the cover. However, the device goes to sleep shortly after I open the cover and fold it back! I think the sensors are somehow detecting that the cover got closed when in reality it is not! This is really very frustrating. I don't know how Amazon could sell the cover without properly testing it with the device. I guess a firmware fix is possible and I really want Amazon to fix this.2. The accelerometer sensor is not properly calibrated. Even the slightest tilt will make the display go from portrait to landscape mode or vice versa. Again not a good user experience. I have used iPhones and iPads and I really like the way the accelerometer works on those devices. A firmware fix should be possible for this too.3. The automatic brightness control setting is useless. Again the sensor seems to be too sensitive. Even though I hold the device without any movement and under a constant light setting, the brightness continuously kept changing. You just cannot use the device when the display continuously flickers.4. I configured the email app to only manually fetch the mail. When I open the app and check for mail, it consistently fails on the first attempt. You always have to retry to fetch the mail. Need a fix for this too.5. Many other issues like Silk browser not connecting to websites sporadically, unable to connect to WiFi randomly (my iPhone at the same time connects perfectly fine).6. Amazon has been slow to get the apps in the app store updated to take advantage of the high resolution display. Many of the popular apps that I downloaded still had low resolution.7. The latest software update has deteriorated battery life. Previously the battery used to drop by only 6% during the night while in standby mode. After the update, it drops by 17% for no reason!All in all, this is just a tablet that aspires to be in the top league but fails to do so. You can get things done if you are a little patient but if you want an enriching, hassle-free user experience go for an iPad.

For other use cases I lean toward the iPad, but the Fire HDX is an awfully nice alternative if you are unwilling to throw down the cost of a tablet from Apple.I can\u2019t speak highly enough about the quality of the display. I watch a lot of Amazon Prime video, and the Fire HDX display is a joy to look at. Sound is good too, or at least is much better than from my phone. (However, I could wish for a couple more steps of loudness on the volume scale).The deepest negative is the charging time. (Twelve hours one night brought it up only to 84%). Buy the nine-watt charging adapter. The five-watt adapter that comes in the box takes far too long to charge the device. The nine-watt adapter is the one that really ought to be in the box to begin with.I like the tablet for why I bought it: watching Prime videos and reading Facebook and the Internet over my morning coffee. Amazon.com has crafted an excellent ecosystem and collection of offerings around their line of tablets. Apps such as The Bible App are wonderful on a device like this.The Kindle Fire HDX is well-crafted and good value for the price. So far the 16 GB model has been plenty, because I stream all of my media on this device anyway.

I love the parental controls, that way she can enjoy reading the books I want to send her and she can browse online safely.

I own the 2nd generation Kindle, followed by the original Kindle Fire, and then this one. When I opened the box, I couldn't believe how thin and light they had made it. The Kindle worked great. Loved the screen resolution. Much sharper than the original. Wireless seemed to have a better connection to the Internet as well. I downloaded a number of my books, music, and most of my apps. One thing I was surprised to discover was that some of the apps I paid for were not in the cloud for me to download. It would be one thing if it was a free app of the day, but was really hoping to move all my apps to this one as I was running out of room on the original and had to leave most of my apps in the cloud. Overall the new Kindle is a great little tablet. I have an iPad with 64GB and I have to say I like using this better since it is as sharp as my retina display and had almost all of my books and apps that I use. Plus it is a better overall value.One strange thing that I have noticed is that some of the apps may not be designed for the higher resolution screen. I have a word search app which you cannot see all the letters. On some other apps, the screen is smaller and hard to read. I will patiently await to see if the designers will address this. Not an issue, as it only happens on a few of them. Overall, I can access and use about 85% to 90% of the apps without any issues.Even though I have had a few challenges, I would still recommend this to others. It is a great light weight tablet that I will be using daily.", "Title": "Really Good Tablet", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "Denyse Rose", "ReviewID": "RKR3HW1U0H7L5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm from way before computers came into the world. I go to the library site and request a book. When it comes in from another library, I get a phone call to pick it up and I usually have a week or two to read it, depending how new it is. It's worked out well, and I have saved money by not buying $30.00 books that I read and give away. My Kindle 7\" arrived in its small box. It is so tiny and can be adjusted so the light is brighter or softer, fits in my purse, and there are quite a few books available for free or for a minimal fee. I can take it to doctor appointments, all kinds of appointments so that I'm not bored. I can get all kinds of apps and my college student son is teaching me how to use it. In fact, that is the only drawback I can find - that there are no written instructions, or any instructions of any kind that come with it! So I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading and wants to fill up those minutes here or there. When you turn it on, it finds the page you were on and lets you hunker down and do just what you wanted to do all along - read your 'book' without being disturbed. This is another first - I've never left a review.

I am changing 1 star to 5 stars. After posting the original review, amazon contacted me and worked with me. I finally spoke with someone in the kindle support who could help me. The problem was the Comcast Arris Modem/Router I was using. Last friday, I bought a Netgear modem from Best Buy and an Belkin N+ router. All problems have disappeared. My kindle is now working fine. If you are having wifi problems and battery drain issues, it might be your Comcast router. Do not return your kindle, just get a new modem/ router and the problem should be solved.Original Review:**********From the outset, I want to state that I will not recommend the Kindle HDX 7. I own five Kindle devices, 4 Kindle HDs and 1 Kindle HDX. I had pre-ordered the Kindle HDX when Amazon announced it and I received it three days before it was sold to the public. Within a month of receiving the HDX, I had problems and had to contact Amazon for a replacement. They quickly sent me a new replacement kindle. The new kindle has been giving me lots of problems: disconnects constantly from the wifi, drains battery power even when it is not in use. Keep in mind, none of my Kindle HDs that are already over a year old have any of these problems. At first, i thought the problem was the Amazon kindle hdx case I had on it. I took the case off and still experienced the same problems. This has been going on since December. I have factory reset several times and the problem is still not solved. Last week I contacted Amazon, they sent me a refurbished replacement kindle (nervous knowing that the kindle I received had prior problems and that is why it is refurbished.). It looked used. I used it for a day and noticed problems with it. I contacted Amazon again and insisted they should send a new kindle because I am tired of driving to UPS to return defective kindles. The representative said he was placing an order for a new kindle for me. Today, i just got another refurbished kindle. I contacted customer support and I was told that as per the terms of agreement, a replacement kindle may be a used device. She informed me that if I have any problems with it, I should contact them and return it for a replacement. I am again nervous this might have issues again. I am crossing my fingers. If I have any issues, I will just return to a kindle HD. I like the new kindle because it is smaller and the display is better. Amazon will never tell us how many people have returned these kindles but I am sure a lot have been returned. I love amazon and I spend a lot of money on Amazon but unfortunately this might be my last kindle if Amazon does not make right with me. For now, I will not recommend the purchase of the HDX until amazon is able to deal with the technical issues with this device. I feel like I just paid $230 to buy a beta device. My ipad and iphone which I use a lot (90% more than the kindle) have not shown any problems like my kindle is.", "Title": "Too many problems before but problem was Comcast Router and not kindle.
