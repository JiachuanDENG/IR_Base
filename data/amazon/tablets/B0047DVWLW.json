Ipads have everything you need all in one and what makes this thing so great is that it works for various and different types of people needs.Ok im from the old school days, remember when you had to carry a planner, a calendar, a calculator, a to do list, a grocery list all in your purse and before you know it, your purse had so much weight to it!!Now ipads have all of that in one and more!!Techonologhy has allowed us this generation to be more efficient and less time consumed by having gadgets like this run our busy lives.Now if you don't have an ipad you may say you don't need an ipad, but I have to say you're wrong! Whether you like to read, watch movies, listen to music, play games, surf the net, do homework, ipad should be apart of your life and will make things so much simpler.FOR KIDS:Ipad is a great learning toy, probably the best one made. It something about the huge touch screen filled with color that makes kids go crazy for it, and with all the learning apps it will trick your kid into thinking its a toy, when their learning and playing at the same time. It amazes me how now schools like elem and middle school will now be having ipads for their students. Its great because growing up i remember having tons of books in a big ole jansport the that weighed my back down.There are tons of apps available for kids and if you want your child to learn or sit still at home or in the car get your child an ipadFOR STUDENTS:If you're in college or even high school having 4 to 8 classes each class requires atleast 2 books and those books add up and are even costly. Ipad 2 can save all that and even save on buying those stocks of notebook paper. ipad 2 allows you to take notes and have all your college books stored on there. Amazing!FOR BUSY MOMS:being a mom is a very busy 24 hour job!!! And as a mom you have to keep up with appointments, doc visits for your child, birthdays, and etc. Instead of carrying a planner, calendar, and etc. Having an ipad and apps for your busy mom. schedule makes life a bit more easier.Ipads are great for every age and even grandmas/grandpas. The huge screen allows us readers to zoom in and see everything clearly.MY EXPERIENCE:At 1st when iPads came out i said i did not NEED one simply becuz Iam always glued to my computer! and than computers wasn't portable easily, i mean yes you can take it with you, but i mean can you slip it right in your purse...no! I never really left home with my laptop because i had to find wi fi and than carry it in its case, bring the plug, it just felt like too much! And than the iPhones came out! I'm like great portability, internet, email check on the go, Facebook, tweet, on the go!!!But as great as the iphones are they are made for that....to be a phone and being on the internet and etc would drain my battery and i need it for calls. but the major drawback for me was the screen, iphone 4s screen seems sooo small compared to an ipad 2So one day my husband convinced on an iPad 2 by getting me one, and i was instantly in love!!as much as I work on my computer at home, once I'm done and i want to relax and read n surf the internet n listen to some music i pull out my iPad 2 and i own a mac. I don't want a laptop on my lap while I'm laying down.And than the portability!! love it i can slip this in my purse, i don't need to bring a charger, case, and etc, just the iPad and I'm out the door.Now ipads shouldn't be computer replacements if you do most work on a computer. Now if you do a lot of homework, word docs, emailing on a iPad i would definitely suggest a keyboard, my hands hurt just typing this reviewI use my ipad for everything from listening to pandora to watching Netflix movies while I'm in the kitchen cooking. Its a great entertainment tool and saves money on electricity instead of having the tv and radio on all the time.Battery Life:When i first got the iPad 2 it felt like it took 2 days for it die even with heavy use, now after couple of months I have to charge it atleast once a day. on heavy use, it can last a couple of hours with no charge. So battery life is okTouch screen:Very responsive touch screen better than other touch screen tablets. You don't have to press hard and it quickly responds to your fingertips!Screen size:I think the screen size is a bit big, but great, I mean you can see everything so clearly and zoom in and everything is right in your face.Weight:I carry this in my purse daily and im not complaining of shoulder pain. It does add a little weight to my purse but nothing where its like omg i have to take this out my bag. In comparison its like having 2 notebooks in your bag/purseCons:Unlike most other tablets they have hdmi ports, sd slots, usb slots ipads have none of those. It would be great if it atleast can take a memory card on its own and not need to buy a accessory to attach to transfer photos.Camera:camera quality back and front sucks to me. The way phones are made now with 8 mp cameras the ipad 2 is in no comparison its camera quality is like a razor phone, when cameras on phones first came out. Like it does the job but nothing to print out and frame up.Overall I think apple did a great concept for technology by creating this and making our busy lives less hectic. iPads can be used for everything from music, to youtube, to web surfing, to email, to word docs, to reading, and so much more. If you're undecided to get an ipad, consider it. I don't think you'll regret like return it back, you ll be too in love. It is a bit pricy but than again all apple products are, and honestly coming from windows for over 12years straight and android phones for over 10 years straight i only regret not going to apple sooner.Its like having a nissan car 1st and driving a bentley after, you'll never want to go back to a nissanI love my Ipad 2, im using it now for this review and i use it every single day! happy shopping!", "Title": "greatest invention technology created!", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Author": "Samuel Claney", "ReviewID": "RWICMS4C6X4AB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I feel like all the hype around the iPad before its launch made it seem like it was going to be the greatest and most revolutionary thing since the first PC, and then it came out and there was a little disappointment because it wasn't, but now there seems to be this comfortable feeling that the iPad has nestled into our lives. It doesn't change everything, but it's great for playing games, surfing the web, and reading books while you're on the couch, or a plane, or a bus. It also has great battery life, the camera's are a great feature, and even though they aren't the quality, you won't use it as much as you might think.

Since I am no longer a full time student anymore, there wasn't much of a point other than just entertainment purposes.  All I really like to do is check my email, watch youtube videos, listen to music, and listen to church sermons and play chess.  I wouldn't want to spend a ton of money on something just for those purposes. A cheaper laptop I could have got but they honestly wouldn't last long.  So the Apple Ipad was a perfect idea and it works well for the unimportant stuff I like to do off the internet.  Well worth the price indeed!!!By the way, I am not trying to be sarcastic.  The Ipad is a big help for me.  As I have went through periods of depression, I don't know where I would be if it wasn't for being able to listen to the sermons off the internet, nor communicating with my friends through email, and even getting my mind off of things through playing chess and listening to music.

Earls", "ReviewID": "R10XWFZEOEKP4O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First I'm not an Apple hater. I returned the product for several reasons I felt to be valid:<1.>  It's still too heavy and it's not very ergonomic. This product is not comfortable for me to hold for long periods. I would say I'm of average strength (I can do 10 overhand pull-ups). I didn't purchase it to prop it up on a desk. I can use a laptop for that. The 10\" Android tablets I've held are too heavy too. I think I might be happier with a 7\" tablet.<2.>  A certain social networking app I use on the iPod all the time stinks on the iPad. I don't know why they couldn't come up with something better than: A. Open it iPhone size. B. Stretch it with a nasty 2x zoom that really displays poorly.<3.>  There are a ton of iPhone apps, not so much for the iPad. And the aforementioned problem keeps me from wanting to run iPhone apps on the pad. I don't want to have to fight with jail-breaking the device just to run an app full-screen. There do seem to be plenty of games, but I didn't get it for that.<4.>  It doesn't even include a calculator. Sure you can download a calculator from the app store. With the added bonus of a big iAd in the middle of the screen. I didn't know I was getting a $600 iPad with Special Offers.In short I would not purchase this product without planning to jail-break it.

Which makes Apple products and exceptional buy for their quality devices at a steal of a deal where they have a sale. I just wanted to be up to par with technology getting the ipad 2, just to stay ''I own one '', however there are no true differences in my first generation ipad 3G to my second generation non-3G ipad 2. It doesn't have a quality camera like the iphone 4 and still no flesh player. If you want more freedom and full use on ANY site, buy a different branded tablet for your needs like an android. the only obvious changes are 3G on Verizon's network, cameras and new color  (white), the device still remains weighted in ones hand as well as bit slick. It's honestly not enough changes for one to feel the need to upgrade unless money isn't a factor. Apple's lineup changes yearly , so if don't own one yet or are looking to upgrade still, just hang on few more months for the ipad 3. best buy has a buy back program so you could also trade in and apply the value of your pre-owned to purchase of a newer model with more memory/features. still great battery life like anything  Apple, there is no other electronic brand like them. If you invest in the iPad (1 or 2 ), set aside funds to buy a quality protective casing and screen protector because Apple's ''limited'' warranty in deeds limits you, it is NOT ''insurance'' for accidental damage so you should wisely choose a 3rd party warranty like best buys to replace or repair if water damage, glass shattering or worse occurs. there's a warranty out there for everyone that doesn't want to shell out nearly a grand for replacement ipad plus more if you need one jailbreak.", "Title": "Purchase one and see for yourself, You'll love it if you don't mind restrictions...", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Author": "M.

This is not a laptop/netbook or a desktop.Review for: iPad 2, 32gb 3G White with smart cover.Good:- IOS is the only stable tablet OS available right now in my opinion, yes android may be able to multi-task better but 99% of users will not know the difference. As for stability IOS (Apple) is miles ahead of Google.- Tons of tablet optimized applications, I have around 20 that I use regularly and never had a problem with any of them.- Zinio iPad application, if you are a Zinio subscriber the iPad is the best way to read your magazines. Much much faster than using even a desktop and also much more pleasant to read and use.- Can play pretty much any kind of video (including avi, mkv and others)if you install AVPlayerHD and output via HDMI. No stutter like on current batch of honeycomb tablets, at least in 720p which I use...- Great keyboard (virtual).- Battery we get around 11 hours on a charge with wifi on.- Stanby is even better you can most likely leave the tab unplugged and come back a week later to use it. If android phones are anything to go by android tablets probably don't have anywhere near the same standby performance. (can't remember the number of times I forget to plug my android phone at night and wake up with it dead, while my wife never plugs her iPhone and )Could have been better:- Flash support would have been good but I can live without it and quite frankly I just wish flash would go away from the web. Its not secure, is a resource hog and basically not very good technology in my opinion.- An sd card slot for expanding memory or keeping your music/movie collection on. So far I did not see a need for this but could be something I miss in the future.I don't like (in general for all Apple IOS devices):- Can only sync to one computer and the iTunes on that computer. What if you have more than one computer ? or quite simply want to load something at work and you are synced with a computer at home ? Your only choice is the cloud and even then you are limited with what you can put on the iPad.Summary very much like the iPad 2 and just ordered a second one as my wife has taken ownership of the current one.

A categorical comparison quickly reveals that the quick release and updates were unnecessary in such a short amount of time. For new buyers, by all means get the iPad 2 and the updated features. However, for those owners of an original iPad, do not waste $500 buying this \"new and improved\" product, because the $600 original you are holding in your hands right now is essentially the same.For starters, the dimensions for both products are the same, with the exception of the width. The iPad 2 is 0.16 inches thinner than the original, resulting in a 0.15-pound decrease in weight. Both devices have the same amount of storage, however the iPad 2 has double the amount of RAM memory performance, which leads to faster download times and less of the \"checkerboard effect.\"  Both devices include models with Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi + 3G and Bluetooth capabilities. The displays are the same size and both feature the fingerprint resistant oleophobic coating. The processor on the iPad 2 features the Dual-Core A5 chip, whereas the original only has the A5 chip, but upon consistent use, the speed appears to be about the same. The original iPad uses the Mac iOS 4.2.1 operating system, which is just a step down from the iPad 2's iOS 4.3 operating system, and few differences are noted, and nearly none are experienced.The one feature that Apple is heavily marketing is the user's ability to FaceTime another iPad 2 user. Although this is cool, is it really worth spending an extra $500 if you already own an iPad? Why not just use your iPhone? Or Skype? Apple is also talking up the iPad 2's 10-hour battery life. They must be hoping no one does their research, because the original iPad has the exact same battery life! The iPad 2 also features a new, smart cover. What's really \"smart\" about an electronic device cover, I'm not entirely sure. I own an original iPad black leather cover and I think it's pretty smart too.If you are reading this review and do not own an iPad at all, by all means go for the new iPad 2. It's fast, skinny and features a camera and FaceTime abilities. However, if you already are the proud owner of an original iPad, do not waste your money. If it only took Apple one measly year to release an iPad 2, it probably won't take much longer to release an iPad 3 or 4. By that time, maybe the updates will actually be worth burning a hole in your wallet.

Since the IPad uses dedicated memory, don't be surprised if the delivery date is extended out a bit since all the parts to put this wonderful device are just not out there.A device that's finally proven once and for all that we can compute different ways, this wonderfully powerful and as always easy to use device is proving why the tablet computer is our next exploding tech market.  Our head guy here at Amazon said in his interview here that we'll see over 40 tablet style computers on the market by this coming Christmas and now I understand why.  The simple fact is much of our time on line is spent simply reading stuff.  Then why carry around a keyboard we're not using?  Be it via Wi-FI or 3G, the upload speeds are simply astounding so we can read or watch videos at speeds that will astound even jaded users such as myself.  Don't look at an IPad 2 as a new computer.  Look at it as a different way of computing.Another surprise with the IPad 2 is in their ability to handle business applications and environments.

This model is a real tool - a real computer - a really different way of doing things in the most user friendly and portable way possible.

About 2 weeks ago I had a heart attack and my Dr. Told me that I need to have a 1000 cal diet and work out a lot more.  Well I couldn't use my phone for the calory counting, too small.  Well I decided to buy iPad 2 and I was angry, but I knew I needed one for ONE reason is to count calories.  I've had it for about a week now, and I LOVE IT.  I really can't leave with ought it anymore. iPad 2 really is saving my life, with the apps to count my cal, my workout programs, and even my Dr. Can see what I eat and what I do at the gym.  I'm not going to talk about how cool it is to serf the web, and do business on it...  I have a 16 g white iPad.

Why they couldn't use the camera from the current iPhone, which is quite good, on this $500+ product, is beyond me. It is a huge flaw in an otherwise mostly outstanding beast.  On a more minor note, the Apple tendency to design for profit instead of ease of use is always maddening. Case in point:  The built in memory costs $100 for each additional 16GBs.  My (non-iPhone) phone has a removable mini SD card that cost $9 for 16 GB, and I can add memory at will, for very little money. This could easily have been the Apple approach with the iPhone & iPad. A mini SD is the size of a fingernail. So I still buy Apple products because they are so good in so many ways, but the affordability thing is kind of ridiculous. Their computers are better than PCs, no question, but should not cost fully twice to three times what a comparable PC costs.", "Title": "Cameras are terrible", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Author": "amikeliunas", "ReviewID": "R3E2COPAC0ZI3I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Most people are aware that iPads don't run Flash based content.IPad has its own YouTube browser to compensate for this design flaw.However, no one mentions that you can't run Java on an iPad or iPhone!!!There are still thousand of web sites and corporate applications running Java.Java is still #1 or #2 language in the world for developing applications.Because Apple had an internal war with Adobe and Sun, the consumers suffer and received a product that has a limited feature set.Check with this url [...]Steve Jobs has been quoted as saying \"Java's not worth building in.

I should have done better research, but figured there would be some sort of workaround, but there is not as of now.

BUY A Keyboard! Mac Bluetooth.Then it was the infatuation with \"apps!\" \" GOLLY look at this! It allows me to print a document!!\"  And other absurdities like that.You know? The stuff that we all have been doing well now for 10 plus years, with the buggy nightmares of the 90s, that used to make one pull hair out in Windows' frustration, now thankfully long suppressed... .I used to refer to Mac devotees as \"Mac Bigots!\"But after dealing with Windows security issues, and instability through every Windows generation... I finally took the plunge with a Powerbook and never looked back. If I became less than a \"Mac Bigot,\" still I learned to love Apple's integration,  stability, sleek looks and creative tides... that happily washed over Apple's countrymen and America as a whole, like that great wave from the first iPhone.But, this is an iPad review and although I don't desire to denigrate this generally great piece of technology or even review it seriously, I  do want to you to seriously consider a Macbook Air before the iPad.Weight is a great part of the allure of the lightweight iPad...but... the new Macbook Air is only about twice as heavy and since it may be likely that the first thing you may buy is a Bluetooth keyboard... that may not be a deciding issue...because if you wish for your, oh so cool... purchase to actually be a functional input device of text... and you took touch-typing in high school... the plunking at an iPhone or iPad's screen... with one's THUMBS... or the dull end of your fingers... becomes a tedious devolution of functionality.And this is the real core of my criticism of PADS in general. They are at this point clever receivers of information but clunky input...ers. One looks for app after app to do the simplest things...  and then we say... \"golly isn't that cool,  I can actually highlight text!\"And guess what? That highlighting of text usually takes a few tries to get the text that you actually need to select with \"TAPS\" selected...to 'mark-up' a doc properly... and some compromise is usually entailed and could have been far more exactly... achieved with a mouse 30 seconds ago.Look ... do I like my iPad?Yes!And I did  order a stylus for 27 bucks and it has not come yet so I can't comment upon that helpful addition as a partial solution for... the iPad's entry flaws... .  But realize... when one peals away the COOL... and gets to the functional daily needs of email ... and entry of certain data... you will spend a good deal of your iPad time... which after all... is life time... learning to get around.. the touch screen and the operating system\"s... limitations.Now ... it is true that if one has say...an iMac which I Highly recommend ... that the real question is: how much...do you actually  need to input at the coffee shop or as a quick reference in the car or as a very light travel basic communication computing device? If the answer is \"not really that much...\" or if putting up with the iPad's limitations for real text entry is OK on occasion... and the added weight of a keyboard is only needed part time... then it has indeed a LOT of very cool qualities and... apps too... that we actually do find we desired and... didn't even know it!!Are even... useful and yes... fun,  a LOT of fun.If you work seriously on the road... an iPad is not for you... at this time in its development... if you need a very cool slick device that is indeed just about the perfect weight and size for extreme portability happiness... and mainly want it for consumption, of information... then the iPad is wonderful.The iPad is a very creative and evolving technology. The \"Cloud\" Apple's and say Dropbox... are bringing all of these devices together and we all are literally with our use... defining their place and potential and the APP ecosystem is indeed VITAL... .That participation in change... is in itself fun to watch and to take part in... lets face it... our participation in that creative process by supporting what works is... a central part of an iPad's attractions... nothing wrong with that! That is the old America, remember her?Creativity  is sadly... so purposefully dimmed for political outcomes... in our dear country...that any tree of creative life left...is worth supporting even one without a real keyboard... .", "Title": "Consider a Macbook Air before you get too excited about the iPad2", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Author": "Duck", "ReviewID": "R3S885EB8V4OT3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works well.

Now that it has been released for six months and I own one, along with the first generation iPad and a HP Touchpad. I feel I am one person that can give a fair review of the item. Examining how the iPad 2 is an improvement over the original on the outside, inside, and how it compares to the Touchpad in terms of hardware and software is a great way to show why the iPad 2 is worth buying. When first grasping the iPad 2, you notice it is much thinner than the iPad 1. It is approximately the same thickness as a simple pencil; you may ask how does it not break? Well it is construced of aluminum on the back and gorilla glass on the front. The gorilla glass in the iPad 2 is double the strength of the similar type of glass used in the first generation iPad. The testers at the website Gizmodo.com compared these two pieces of glass with two pieces of wood and bending the glass between them. The iPad 2 glass stretched twice as far before breaking.  The glass is not perfect though, it will break it dropped without a case because it is indeed glass. Unlike the iPad 1, the iPad 2 has special tiny magnets built in around the screen that allows Apple's new product the smart cover to be usable. The cover sticks to the iPad 2 and wakes up the iPad when the cover is removed. This interesting feature is a feature not available with the first iPad. The screen size and resolution is the same as the original iPad, with a 9.7\" IPS technology screen and a 1024x768 resolution. A new addition to the iPad 2 is the cameras on both the front and the back of the device. The front facing camera, similar to that of the one in the Apple iPhone 4 is mainly used for skype and video conversations. The camera on the back is a low one megapixel camera, and is quite grainy. I cannot imagine anyone having a use for this and I myself have never found a use for it. It still is better than the originals iPad's though, since it does not even have a camera.  The iPad 2 can also be bought in the color white, unlike the original. I bought my iPad 2 from Apple.com the night it was available and got it in a few days with free shipping.The internals have gone through a drastic change between the two iPads. Apple, along with every other technology giant upgrades their devices to meet the latest technology. Apple has shown this by upgrading from the slower A4 single-core processor in the original iPad to the faster and much smoother dual-core A5 processor found in the iPad 2. The random access memory or RAM has been doubled between the two devices from 256 megabytes to 512 megabytes. The RAM upgrade allows more webpages to be open simultaneously in applications such as skyfire and safari. On the original iPad if you open ten pages at once, the device is quite slow and can even become unresponsive; on the new iPad ten pages is no problem, with no slowdowns. The speakers are the same in both iPad's, although the placement of them is a bit different. The hard drive storage options are the same in both devices, depending on how much you need. Available options are as low as 16GB to as high as 64GB. The video memory has also been upgraded in the iPad 2, allowing games such as Infinity Blade to run quickly and look much better, more realistic even. The figures in Infinity Blade look more closely to real humans than those shown on the first iPad. Overall it is good upgrade to the original in my opinion, since the price of the two is the same starting out.Knowing the iPad 2 is a good improvement over the original, how does it compare to similar tablet computers in the market? I own an HP Touchpad which is a similar tablet and it is a close comparison. The Touchpad features the same type of display, sporting a 9.7\" IPS technology screen just as the iPad 2. I consider the two being a tie in this category, because there really is not much of a difference. When it comes to overall shape the Touchpad is shorter than the iPad but the same width. I do not see this as being much of a difference either. The iPad 2 is considerably lighter than the touchpad it feels like, this should not matter too many people, the difference is not to major, and with a case the weight equals out. The touchpad has smaller hard drive options than the iPad 2; having only 16GB and 32GB options. I do not know many people that would use the full 64GB of data that can be bought in an iPad 2, but if you need that much than the iPad 2 would be the device to go with. Both my iPad 2 and touchpad have 16GB of data and I do not find myself looking for more space at all. My original iPad has 64GB of data and if I did not put my movies on it, I would have no use for the full 64GB. The camera comparison between the iPad 2 and the touchpad is another tie. While the touchpad only has one, front facing camera, it is of a much higher quality than both of the cameras on the iPad 2. Since the touchpad does not have a camera on the back and iPad 2 does, I give them a tie.  The touchpad has a dual-core processor, just as the iPad 2, but it is .2 gigahertz faster. The .2 gigahertz does not seem to make much of a difference, but since the speed is clocked faster, I give this to the touchpad. The battery life on the touchpad is very close to that of both iPad's. I do not notice much faster drainage between the three devices. A notable difference in the two devices is the speaker quality. The iPad 2 has decent speakers but not the best on the market; on the other hand, the touchpad uses higher quality beats audio, which is argued as some of the best on the market in 2011. It shows this, the sound quality on any music is like comparing static to clear, smooth sound between the two devices.  When it comes to price, originally they were both tied at $499 for the base price, but now the touchpad has been lowered to an extremely good, low price of $99. If you are on a budget and want a nice tablet, the touchpad is for you.When it comes to software, I have to say the iPad 2 dominates this category all around. The touchpad, which runs on WebOS is a system that does not have near the developers or supporters that the iPad 2 and the app store has. The app store has well over 500,000 applications that can be downloaded for free, or for a small fee to the iPad, whereas the touchpad has only a few 1,000. This attracts many more people to the iPad 2 because there is many more applications for anything you can think of in the app store, the selection of apps is very limited if you are buying the touchpad. If you are using a phone as a main internet connection, you will notice trouble when trying to connect the touchpad to the internet; this is because the touchpad does not support ad-hoc networks. This is a downfall for people like me that live on the iPhone internet tethering; the iPad 2 does support these networks and has no trouble connecting. For most people this will not be an issue but it something that should be known and that I was not aware of when I bought the touchpad. When using the touchpad, it is just as fluid as the iPad 2 when it comes to scrolling between pages of applications and searching through the device.  WebOS itself is not a bad system to use, and if it had more applications I believe it would be a great system.If you are stuck on deciding a tablet computer to buy, ask yourself what you are expecting. If you want just a simple tablet computer, with no cameras, lots of apps and good ability to function, the iPad 1 would be good. Although if you want a nice, newer tablet with a camera you have to decide how much your budget is? The iPad 2 and the touchpad are close in mostly every category besides the selection of apps, is the price difference of $400 worth the app store? I myself believe the iPad 2 is a wonderful device to have and use if your budget can afford it, otherwise I would highly recommend the $99 HP touchpad.", "Title": "Great Device if you can afford it!", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Author": "Rosemary's kindle", "ReviewID": "R19D90MXHY75BA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a used item but it was just like new with the exception of a very small scratch on the back.. otherwise, looks and works perfect.", "Title": "It arrived just as product is described", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Author": "eugene kirkham", "ReviewID": "RD9JRK6SIR196", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it.the price was right.it came in like new condition .

The iPod and Videos features are nice to have when travelling, and for those who like to read, the iBooks app is a capable book reader and there are thousands of ePub books and PDF files out there to load up on. For people that use Office to write letters and school papers, there is the iLife office suite which is Office compatible in most cases.There is a bonus for musicians. The iPad is becoming a professional tool for musicians with a plethora of music utilities, software synths (including a few Moog products), guitar amp simulators and even Garage Band to write and record on the go.

Corbin", "ReviewID": "R3SJY0KTEVNOJK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This review is for the general public looking for something easy and fun to use. I am not a techie and have never owned a tablet until yesterday when I purchased a Galaxy Tablet 10.1. I loved this tablet but sadly had to return it this morning when I learned that I was lied too about its ability to connect with a VGA projector. After returning the Galaxy Tablet 10.1 this morning because of its inability to connect to a VGA output I found myself reluctantly purchasing an i-pad 2 16gb tablet. I wish I had never returned the Galaxy Tablet 10.1!! In terms of usability the Samsung Galaxy Tablet 10.1 was super easy and within minutes I was sending off emails using voice control, etc... however the I-Pad 2 left me flustered all afternoon long and I am still in shock at how complicated and convoluted getting things to work on it is. For instance 1) Before I could download anything needed for work I had to up-grade the OS! 2) Once OS-5 was installed I bought three (3) apps - keynote, pages, some PDF reader and I also installed Netflix for free. I had to uninstall and then re-install all four (4) app's in order to get them to work properly! Then, it turns out that the i-pad 2 doesn't actually charge whilst plugged into the computer via its usb port?! The battery life is not ten hours either! After five hours of feverishly trying to figure this thing out I was way below 30% battery life! I found the applications very frustrating to access and EVERYTHING forces you to use APPLE \"something or another...\" be it music, files, pictures, etc... if you like having options than avoid the i-pad... it leaves you feeling like you have been run over after all of the new accounts you have to set up just to get it to turn on properly out of the box.Compared to the Galaxy Tablet 10.1, everything was super easy to use and ready to go. It also comes with Polaris Office which is just as nice as keynote and pages in my opinion and it is FREE! I wrote a review about the Galaxy Tablet 10.1 expressing my disappointment that Samsung is being so short sighted about not having an VGA adapter for it. However, I could find no fault with the tablet itself or its applications. It left me feeling upset that I had to return it as I loved it so much. However, the Apple i-pad has left me so angry after hours of jerking me around that I can't wait to bring it back tomorrow and be rid of it. I also have the arduous task of trying to get my money back for the apps keynote and pages... both $10.00 each. I will confess that now that everything is finally set up and once you succumb to Apple's monopoly over how software is transferred from your computer to the tablet (i-tunes - sigh!) both keynote and pages preserve your Microsoft word and PowerPoint documents very nicely and is usable immediately. The Apple i-pad also has a proper VGA adapter for its i-pad... but it is NOT as user friendly as people or Apple itself makes it out to be and has left me wanting to return it regardless. Also, unlike the Galaxy Tablet, it does not allow you to swipe the screen from left to right and limits you to the basic top to bottom functions. The keyboard is inferior to the Galaxy tablet as well. For whatever reason the i-pad doesn't even have a tab key despite the fact that there is a blank space where the tab key usually is on any normal keyboard, including the Galaxy tablet 10.1! Just to type in some of my passwords I have to literally change the keyboard options three (3) times! This is only a problem for people like me who actually make full use of all the keys on a qwerty key board when making passwords and such. The Galaxy Tablet keyboard was simple and easy to use. It was as good as typing on a laptop keyboard! I also found some really great books for free via the Galaxy whereas most of the free books for the i-pad is just crap. Apple should spend more time on perfecting its products instead of introducing new ones every six months!Bottom Line: if you do not need to use VGA projectors than buy the Galaxy Tablet 10.1. I am heartbroken that I could not have kept that one. Leave Apple to those who like it for what it is. Personally, I'd sooner use a Remington Typewriter than the i-pad!UPDATE:I returned this iPad and purchased the Galaxy 10.1 Tablet again and couldn't be happier! I found a way around the projector problem too which is great. My only regret is having bothered to purchase the iPad at all.", "Title": "Apple I-Pad 2 VS.

If your iPad breaks, Apple will give you a refurbished iPad if your warranty is still in effect. If your warranty has expired then your only option could  be to throw away your Ipad or sell its parts on Ebay.17)Apple forced Amazon to remove the Kindle Store button from their mobile devices. They have also done this to the Barnes & Noble Nook Application.18)iPad2 probably has the worst operating system ever. The system is so restrictive it limits any chance of even limited productivity. If you're only interested in playing games, email or rather poor quality photo images and video then you'll probably like the iPad2.Pro:1)Long battery life.2)Good screen but no need for such a high resolutiongiven its size.3)Support from Apple store if you are near one.4)Widely used.5)People think it looks good.6)Shiny.7)People who don't know much about technology are impressed by the device.8)If you have lower than average IQ you will find this product easier to use than a more tweekable Android tablet.All in all my roommate wishes he had gotten a Toshiba Thrive because he would like more freedom and does not want Apple breathing down his back asking for money at every turn.===============================Concerning the retina display of the New iPad:March 18, 2012 (I unfortunately was forced to post an update to this because my roommate thinks people can benefit). He heard about Apple's new iPad and wanted me to give him some ideas of what techies thought of Apple's retina display in the new iPad. So I went to a website I read frequently and one that is popular with the most technologically literate people on earth: tomshardware dotcom. I am includingsome of the comments voted highest and left by tomshardware frequent readers. It is hoped that this will assistintelligent readers on deciding if they should get the new iPad.Halcyon:\"Why didn't someone besides Apple use this most excellent screen first? Heck, Samsung makes the screen...you'd think they put something as nice in their own tablets.\"------Bystander:Frankly, I find it a little ridiculous at the resolution of this screen. I'd rather have the extra battery life and if you use it for games, they are probably going to have to use it at half the resolution for performance reasons.2550x1600 on a 30\" is about as crisp as i can see. Why do we need that on a 9.7\" screen?I won't refuse the added resolution, but I'm not sure there is much reason to spend extra money for it either.------Icemunk quoted by Del35:\"Back in 2010 when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone 4, he claimed that the human eye stooped discerning the individual pixels when the pixel density is 300ppi. Hence he called the display on the iPhone 4 the retina display, which has 326ppi. Now we go forward in time almost two years and after all the human eye stops discerning pixels at 260ppi not 300ppi as previously stated.Also the phone I mentioned was a Nokia N900, at the time I also had a iPhone 3GS and a Xperia X1. Without knowing I had two phones with retina displays.\"The retina display is such a load of nonsense. The hype is designed to draw technologically subliterate zombies. The bottom line is that I simply can't imagine using a device like the new iPad that prevents me from experiencing fully close to 30% of websites due to its proprietary infestation (no flash and no java support!). On another note, I am happy that Samsung manufactures the retina display for Apple. Obviously they see no need to create a hype around it and seem not to be pushing it on their devices. For me the 1280 x 800 Pixel Super Amoled display of the the Samsung Galaxy Note is more than I need. Thanks but no thanks Apple. Give me connectivity, openness, and produce a device with a better that 2 in 10 repairability ratio and thus almost impossible to repair, also throw in a micro sd slot and price the device reasonably and I might consider it. Till you do that you will just be producing overpriced junk for  zombied morons using your logo as a shield.End of story.-----Icemunk:\"Fact of the matter is Apple displays are nice, and set a good benchmark, however they have been surpassed by newer technologies and better resolutions on many fronts. Most new super phones surpass 300ppi using LCD, OLED, and LED technologies.\"-----Icemunk:\"Yup, Samsung make excellent handheld displays!----------Vladislaus:\"My old phone with 3,5 inch 800x480 apparently also has a retina display long before Apple introduced it with the iPhone 4. Apparently all of a sudden, retina displays became much more common overnight.\"----------The Dane:\"Apple's retina displays still uses IPS panels. Much prefer lower resoution SuperAMO LED if image quality is important.\"--------Icemunk:\" There are plenty of phones with \"Retina\" display (above 300 ppi). For example, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus has a 4.65\" OLED screen with 316 ppi, however it is not advertised as \"Retina\" display, because that is a marketing gimick which Apple has a copyright for. OLED beats LCD hands down by the way.\"-------Shaod:\"Of course it has 316 ppi \"strictly speaking\" - ppi being simply the number of pixels it has per inch. That's ignoring that PenTile actually looks (subjectively) better than a regular display of the same resolution, while using less power because it has few subpixels.And sorry but 'retina display' is a marketing term. Like you point out it is completely subjective upon other factors such as where the screen is held and how good the eyesight of the user is.\"-------Icemunk responds to Watcha who  seems to work for Apple:\"You sound like a person who has little experience outside his Iphone and Apple products.. that is unfortunate, I believe you are caught up in the marketing of Apple and confusing it with science. It's tough to be a truly critical thinker when you are a fan boy unfortunately... hopefully you'll realize this in time. Good luck.\"-----Icemunk responds to Apple employee Watcha:\"I'm not going to argue about what a \"Retina\" display is, because that is a marketing device which Apple holds copyright. If you would like to argue facts, than I will present them to you:OLED is a superior display. Lower power, higher clairty, better viewing angles, true blacks and superior contrasts, higher resolutions, more advanced, higher quality, vibrant colors. LCD does not compare, even if you make up some marketing term about \"Retina\" display. OLED wins hands down, no matter how you spin it. And just so you know.. Apple won't be using LCD in their next Iphone, Samsung will make them a nice OLED display for it instead.\"Del35 replies to Icemunk:-------\"Watcha is unforuntetly lacking in real knowledge, and lost in the vast marketing machine produced by Apple. He reads his \"science\" from websites such as[...] which talks about nothing but Apple.. I feel for people like him, they don't realize they are being manipulated by marketing.\"I agree. In fact Watcha is even lacking in the basics of logical reasoning as evidenced by many of his past comments. Watcha does not even know  what  a contrapositve statement is or what a converse statement is or what  a tautology is. To illustrate his total lack of logical skills,  I recall a discussion with Watcha where he/she claimed that Apple made better product because more affluent people purchased them. I replied to him that his argument was akin to the claim that slavery was a better economic system because wealthier people held slaves in the 17th and 18th Century. He could not see the fallacy of his claim and held to it. Now it is known that Watcha works for Apple. So he is just working to put food on his table albeit in an immoral and anti-intellectual  fashion.--------Icemunk:\"I'm not going to argue about what a \"Retina\" display is, because that is a marketing device which Apple holds copyright.
