It was sealed in plastic showed no signs if tampering. It came with IOS 6, but within hours updated to IOS 7. It was easy to set up and my mom loves her Christmas present. The iPad  itself I would give 5 stars.The shipping via FedEx Smartpost I would give less than a 1 if possible. I have Amazon Prime  and it (plus 2 other items in the shipment) arrived 2 days late. I completely thought it was lost. The tracking data had it in Dallas for 4 days and the post office never saying whether they received it or not.  Amazon had returned my money. Only after Amazon processed my  refund did new tracking data appear, post dated days before. The iPad and other items were presents and I wanted them so I told them to charge me for them again.It was all a big mess due to FedEx Smartpost u was very disappointed with the delivery that did not arrive on time and poor tracking data that made it seem lost.I am  pleased with the iPad, but very disappointed with this shipping method.

But I opted to buy an iPad Mini because it was on sale at Walmart for $299. I was going to get the Nexus 7 for $249 but thought for my money the iPad Mini was faster, had a better display and can do virtually everything I'd want or need it to (sans the Amazon AppStore). And I believe I was right.The iPad Mini is the perfect size, being not long and skinny and not perfectly square. It's not too tiny and not overly large. It looks like a giant Galaxy Note II running iOS 6.  It is stick and snappy, loads and plays videos spectacularly, takes great pictures and has a lot of good free and paid for apps that will suit anyone who wants a tablet to play with or do business with.Coming from a Nook Tablet (non-HD) I can say I'm very impressed with this one; how it looks, how it feels and how it performs.  It can do all my Nook Tablet does, and more,  I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.", "Title": "Perfect 8\" tablet", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R3G639EHKJU0M4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great apple product, amazing clarity and easy to use.

It reads like a trade paperback in its vertical position. I have read plenty of ebooks on my ipad using ibooks but this puts the ipad inthe shade ebook wise.Second, I have always carried my ipad with me in my purse no matter where I am going. I have now changed this to my ipad mini going along in my purse instead. This gives me access to everything at a perfect, portable size.  I do not need to wear reading glasses to use it.  I find the iphone too small to solely carry that around. Although I prefer going online with my ipad, the mini is perfect for this in carrying around mode.Likewise, I play scrabble, gin rummy and do crosswords on he mini now.  I used to solely use the ipad for this. The reduction in size causes no problems and I can again skip glasses. I am almost 65 so this is a factor for anyone in my age group.I also use the mini now for all of my podcasts.  I love NPR, the New Yorker, the NYTimes, etc., podcasts and mini is perfect for all of those.  It is ideal for both audio and visual podcasts. While I still prefer watching films on my ipad due to the larger screen size, the ipad mini is fine for videos where detail is not as important.I am also now loading different apps onto my mini from what I load onto my ipad. Musical audio visual apps such as Jack White's and Brian Eno's just went onto it as well as several art based apps. Increasingly I am devoting my ipads to films and tv.  I no longer own tv sets, finding the apple products all I need for full audio visual.I use keynote and pages of all of these systems.  Probably the ipad is still my favorite size with those programs but the mini performs very well with them.On a daily basis I am still discovering more and more with the mini.  I am sure I have many discoveries yet to make. But even with only this much discovered, I already love it and highly recommend it.I bought mine online at the apple store.  I got it cheaper than this so you may want to check it out there as well as here. I also got two lines of free engraving etched onto the mini's back, my name and email address,  although you can put whatever you want on yours,", "Title": "another great apple mobile computer device", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Author": "J. Walton", "ReviewID": "R3VAWCCE7988OD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this better than my fullsize IPAD.  It is one light, thin, sharp looking device.  The design allows you for a much smaller footprint with just a little bit of a smaller screen size.In my house, we have an IPAD 2, IPAD 3, and IPHONE 5's.  So, I am quite familiar with their products.  The mini is for my daughter for X-MAS and I have downloaded the apps for her setting it up.In a nutsheel, the mini is a must buy at a very fair price of $330 considering what you are getting which is the best tablet made in this size range (simply put).For the Apple haters who love to comment on Apple products although choosing not to own them, you cannot run stat for stat because of the IOS is not made for multiple vendors thus it is way more efficient.  And, the image on the IPAD supercedes anything out there just because of color saturation.  Look at users comparisons on You Tube. I have a close friend with a Nexus 7.  The two beside each other and in operation are no comparison, period.
