However, people giving it 1 and 2 stars are not really being fair.  Now, should we all give Asus 1 and 2 stars...YES... but this tablet is not a 1 or 2 star tablet.I pre-ordered from Amazon, but it was taking to long to get here, so I canceled and ordered through BB, and got it about 12 days later.  It is a very good tablet for the price when you compare it to it's contemporaries (e.g. the Ipads, Xooms, G-Tabs, Xyboards, etc of the tablet world).  The other tablets will run you up to several hundred dollars more, and often will not give you a better experience for the extra cash you fork out for them.  You can go cheaper and get a Nook (rooted and droided) or Kindle Fire, but again, you will not get the shear horsepower of this tablet. Also, I own the OG Transformer, and it was the best Android tablet for the money until the Transformer Prime hit the street, so the Asus-Android combo has been, and continues to be, a great value.Does this beat the Ipad 2?  In many area's yes, in some, no.  Will it be able to go toe-to-toe with the Ipad 3?  Probably so, but will more than likely lack the polish and overall ease of operation that people love about Apple products; however you will pay handsomely for it $$!!  Will other Android tablets be released in the near future that will best the Prime?  Again, probably so, but get ready to pay $100-300 more for Samsung, Acer, and the like.  Now, will you find a more powerful Android tablet with greater features and $$value$$ than the Prime?  I am fairly confident you will not.So, if you need to use your tablet for turn-by-turn navigation, will regularly be 60-75 feet away from an wifi AP, and have the money to pay for the polish and ease of Ipad, then you might not want to get the Prime.  However, if you want the most powerful processor running Android (with Ice Cream Sandwich and unlocked bootloader in 5 more days), sleekest looking piece of hardware, thinnest 10\" tablet, and all at a great value, then get this tablet asap.  Don't get all wrapped around the axle over GPS unless you really need to use this thing for turn-by-turn directions.", "Title": "Unfairly Getting a Bad Rap", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Author": "P.

It feel much lighter to hold with one hand and it much thinner overall and the edge taper off and wrapping around the glass screen. I'm nitpicking this here, because of the taper design the micro SD card it protruding off a bit and you are reminded when you have it on landscape mode holding the tab with your left hand. The back side have a metal finish with the rings effect, nice looking, but don't have much texture for griping. Glass touch screen like all devices is finger print magnet. But you like that metallic feel this the tablet for you and I don't mind it also.- Performance -Yes the first quad core on a tablet, But I don't see a big different comparing a dual core yet when running multiple different apps and games. Maybe more on the software side and when apps developer optimized the 4 core, also hope ICS can boost the performance even more. I use three browser - Opera, Firefox and the default browser and all is slow to load up. I have some drop Wifi connection a few time. It also freeze up a few time for me. The one speaker don't sound loud or rich and it point away from you. Why can't at less any manufacturer design one aiming at you?. But I pair with my Bluetooth Nokia play 360, so that fine. I use the micro Hdmi port and it display on my Samsung set with a bit of over flow and there no option to resize the screen to fit.Wish Asus add Bluetooth v4.0, but Bluetooth pairing with my Bluetooth mouse with no issue, it pop up a pointer when enable. Auto brightness don't work well for me, it darken the screen way more then you can tolerated when in a dark environment.- Battery -With advance task killer, I have it on and running all day without re-charging until the night with screen brightness half way, Wifi and Bluetooth on and play music, video and surfing the web. I had 15% left, before plugging it back in.I'm pretty please with my Asus Prime tablet, even with it flaws, but I'm sure Asus will be on top of it and released more patchs. All I need now is root access, more compatible apps for the tablet and ICS upgraded. Newbie tablet owner will be happy with this tablet choice.

Gavin", "ReviewID": "R2SPB1WRC9P4UT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I read the negative reviews regarding WiFi and GPS issues and decided to go ahead with the purchase despite the problems because it looked like Asus was addressing them.  However, their way of addressing those issues was to redesign the product as the TF700 with a plastic back (which the TF201 should have had), add a few bells and whistles, and charge $100 more. Why they didn't just bite the bullet and retrofit the TF201 with a plastic back and satisfy all those customers who already plunked down $500 is beyond me.  In any event, I got the unit yesterday and there was an immediate update to Android 4.0 right when I booted it up.  I thought, \"great I'll have the newest version right out of the box\".  The only problem is that doing the update results in a tablet that randomly locks and reboots.  I had it less than 24 hours and it randomly locked and rebooted at least 15 times.  After reading the message boards (not the Asus support site, which has no reference to any of the problems), I realized that I was not alone in the rebooting issue.  I've put up with enough marginally functional computer products in my lifetime but I've finally realized that if I pay $500 for a product, it should work properly right out of the box.  So, I boxed it up and returned it and will monitor tablet reviews religiously before I commit to another one, especially one from Asus.", "Title": "Random reboot issue so I returned mine.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Author": "Liqmaticus", "ReviewID": "R2SDXB0L46T2DZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have no idea what these negative reviews are talking about. My WiFi signal is strong all throughout my house. Very solid build on the chassis. Incredibly crystal clear bright screen. Stunning performance and graphics. This tablet is just an exciting piece of tech. I have a first gen iPad which two years ago was jaw dropping and now the Transformer Prime takes it to a whole other level. When you play Shadowgun on this tablet you realize nothing else compares. Total silky smooth FPS with beautiful water effects. The Tegra 3 really shows its muscle on this tablet. The scary thing is the quad core processor on this tablet is barely being tapped yet so it is very future proof as well. Now that rumors of the iPad 3 are coming out about quad core as well it looks like 2012 will be the year of quad core tablets. Either way this tablet is a bargain at 500 bucks for the 32GB model. It also is ultra thin and stays cool even under heavy load. Just amazing. I have never been happier with a tech product. Not to mention that ASUS has announced Ice Cream Sandwich will be coming January 12th and ASUS has announced an unlocked bootloader/tool. I wish other tablet makers would follow ASUS's lead and give what their customers ask for.Update: I am knocking two stars off for the way ASUS is handling the TF201 WiFi/GPS signal metal chassis design flaw by introducing a new Prime (TF700) model. Badly handled and I agree that we TF201 owners are stuck holding the tablet so to speak. I hope ASUS comes out with an acceptable solution for us TF201 owners or I predict there is going to be legal trouble down the road for them. There is a petition you can sign here if you are thoroughly peeved like most of us. [...]Update 2: The WiFi issue with the TF201 is worse than I had anticipated. I tested my TF201 from my bedroom where my Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL sits (yes I know that is an older model router, but a tried and true workhorse model) and I am getting an average of 12Mbps down and 3.6Mbps up. I move two rooms away with two walls in-between and it drops to about half at an average of 6.5Mbps down and the same on up @ 3.6Mbps. These are consistent results. With that said, all my WiFi devices experience some drop in speed as I move away from the router's ground zero, but here is the gotcha. The overall WiFi speed is much lower on my TF201 than my two year old first generation iPad. My iPad 1 in the same spots in my house gets 17.3Mbps down and 3.7Mbps up and two rooms away 15Mbps down and 3.7Mbps up. A couple things come up here. Is the antennae in my iPad 1 of better quality or stronger than my new TF201? Notice my iPad only drops about 2Mbps on the down speed when I move two rooms over yet my TF201 drops almost in half by about 5.5Mbps on the down speed. On the flip side of the coin I have an iPhone 3GS which does not have 3G enabled, but I still use the WiFi portion on it (essentially an iPod Touch). It has always had bad performance on the WiFi, but yet again the drop from ground zero to two rooms away is a smaller drop. On my iPhone 3GS I get ~6Mbps down and ~3.5Mbps up at GZ and two rooms away I get ~4.5Mbps down and ~3.5Mbps up. Only about a 1.5Mbps drop on the down. So, to answer the question, yes, the TF201 definitely has WiFi issues compared to a two year old first generation iPad and drops more speed on the down than a two year old iPhone 3GS. I was using Android ICS 4.0.3 for my test on the TF201. So anyone saying the ICS update solved the issue with WiFi on the TF201 is incorrect.Update 3: As some have reported with their TF201 I just got my first reboot for no reason. I was reading news feeds in an app called Taptu and the Prime went black and rebooted. My battery was at 80% charge. Running on the new ICS 4.0.3 update which could have something to do with it. Let's hope this gets resolved in future updates and luckily, so far, this is a rare issue.Update 4: For those who are reporting that your ASUS Transformer Prime TF201 is crashing/rebooting randomly since you updated to Android Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS 4.0.3) you are not alone. Follow this link: goto comments section under this review for linkUpdate 5: So after all the random reboots, crashes, weak WiFi, barely working GPS I realized I paid premium for a piece of tech garbage. Throwing in the towel and calling Office Depot Online tomorrow and returning the Transformer Prime. I am not going to be buying the new TF700T on principle since ASUS is not addressing their customer concerns with any sort of urgency. There are plenty of Tegra 3 tablets coming to market soon and I will sit and wait to see how it all shakes out. The Transformer Prime had such potential it really is unfortunate. If you want to see how bad this whole ICS 4.0.3 update that just came out went just go over to this XDA link.

(updated January 12)", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1ZX0GKVEGR8AO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received the 64gb version after waiting 6 weeks with amazon. As soon as i turned the unit on it went through its initial setup.  It came with Honeycomb. We also have the samsung galaxy 10.1 and they both perform very similiar on honeycomb. The asus does have a better front camera. After loading all my apps i received a update message to upgrade the asus, thinking it was ICS i did so immediately. As soon as it rebooted it lost all wifi connectivity. After an hour with asus support, they told me to go back to factory defaults, which i did. The update was not ics, but upon reboot i received another mesage to update. Per asus suport this was ICS. I did so an presto it was ICS. Immediately I noticed the difference between honeycomb and ICS. The tablet was much faster so i thought great, then problems began, sudden reboots for no reason. When surfing the internet pages would freezes asking me to wait or quit. So i downloaded several other browsers with the same results. At night i would power down and recharge the unit, next morning the tab would indicate no wifi connectivity. I had  to go through wifi setup again not a big issue but still an annoyance that we do not have with the samsung. Tested out the gps and like everyone else has stated does not function. Everyone is saying that having the tegra 3 is the deciding factor to get the asus but currently there is little or no software to take advantage of the better processor. It will be 3 to 6 months before any significant applications will be available by then there will be many tablets to chose from, even asus will have a newer model in the 2q of this year. I'm glad i purchased from amazon because this unit is going back and I'll wait for the improved tablets to come out later this year.", "Title": "Don't believe all the hype", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Author": "jfranco", "ReviewID": "R3N6LO2QV5P949", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am going to keep my review as short as possible. First off, my tablet works flawlessly. I did have my concerns like some of you who have done your research about wifi performance, gps and light bleed. Off the bat, my wifi performance was good but not consistent. I used wifi analyzer to check my signal with comparison to my current android phone, the HTC EVO 3D. Both showed the same signal strength but I noticed the inconsistency with various download speeds that ranged from 8 to 20MPS. This was from about 15-20 feet away from my wireless router, the Netgear Wireless N600. I re-configured my router to use channel 11, set the security options to WPA2-PSK (AES), Mode set to 300mps. I disabled the guest network and the 5ghz wireless broadcast. After making those changes my wireless reception improved and I was consistently hitting 20 Mbs using the speed test app. My internet service is provided by Comcast. About the GPS... I was not able to lock onto any GPS satellites from inside my home. Took the table outside and locked on to 6 satellites and counting within seconds with great accuracy on location. Using the stock Navigation app I was able to lock and use. About light bleed... There is no light bleed what so ever on my tablet, confirmed using the light bleed app from the market. The only issue I have with the tablet is when typing with the tablet using the stock keyboard can feel uncomfortable. Its like the edges of the tablet start digging into your palm. This will be easily be fixed once you put it in a case. Performance wise, I did not notice any slowdown in switching between apps and screens until I installed the app called Pulse. This app or others like it may have a compatibility issue with the companion core causing a slow down when the Asus using the companion core to conserve power. Just something to keep in mind.In short, this tablet looks great and does everything I want. I love everything about it, watching movies, fluidity, games, Multiple email account support using the Asus stock email app, and a beautiful display built into a great design to ice the cake. I was looking to jump in on a full featured Android tablet and I found it here with the transformer prime. All that's missing is Ice Cream Sandwich. I will update my review again when I receive the ICS update and/or our second transformer prime (champagne) that I ordered for my girlfriend. To bad it wont ship until the end of January early February from Amazon. The Grey Transformer tablet that I own know came from Best Buy, ordered on November 29th, shipped on December 19th, received on December 23rd. I know, I was one of the lucky ones!****update 1/9/12 11:42pm****Just got Ice Cream Sandwhich and its working great!", "Title": "Works great, just put in an order for a second one.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Author": "JCossack88", "ReviewID": "R1KPM7X5FAGKO9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I was thinking about getting a tablet I considered 3 options: The iPad 2, The Galaxy Tab 10.1, and the Transformer Prime. To be honest I was almost dead set on the GTab 10.1, because it had allshare so I could watch television on my tablet, but I decided to go with this tablet instead. I have had it for about a week so I will tell you what I love, and what I don't.The Good:1. IPS+ screen is beautiful. I have never had a brightness issue, and I mainly work outside and I use my tablet all day. It has many brightness settings so you will never have to find a dark area again.2. Dock station. The keyboard dock is a must for anyone that is going to be doing word processing, massive web use, or needs more battery. The keyboard is awesome and feels very nice. I also like how thin it is when it is closed. Also, because it attaches and detaches I know I won't lose it.3. Battery life. I am getting well more than a full day of use out of the tablet (with the dock). I work from 7-5 every week day, and use it in the morning to catch up on my news, listen to music, and watch videos. During the workday I use it for about an hour to read over my appointments, create to-do lists, and jot down notes. On my drive home I do some homework for another hour. As soon as I get home I finish my homework and immediately use youtube, netflix, and the web. Now by the time I go to bed (usually around midnight) I have about 90% on the tablet and 30% battery on the dock, so you will never have to find a plug anywhere. But if you just use the tab, you may need a mid day short charge, and it should last well throughout the day.4. Camera. I own an Epic 4G from Sprint, so this camera is wayyyy better than my phone. It captures images in full 1080p. I also like the camera app this device comes with. Every control is right under your thumb so you never have to move around the screen, which has been great. I do not take a lot of pictures with my tablet, but when I do it is good to know I have a great option.5. Built in office suite. The TFPrime comes with Polaris office, which is a full office suite, with a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation builder. They save in microsoft office formats so you can do everything from your tablet. The tab also has a file manager in it, so if you are a student and need to locate your documents to send, you can find them easily in the file manager. This tablet has completely replaced my laptop due to this feature alone.6. Speaker. I was a little sceptic about the single speaker in the back, but I found that it is amazing! It is very loud and you do not really need to cup your hand to transfer the noise to the front (unless there is a lot of background noise around you).7. Processor. The Tegra-3 Quad core processor is blazing fast! I saw the video from c-net that said the iPad 2 was better, but its not, there is no slowing this tablet down. I even had 15 programs open at once and noticed no change in the speed. transferring between screens on other tablets is very slow, but the screen changes in real time now that I have this one.The Bad:1. Wifi connection: My specific model (which is a C series serial number), has had some issues connecting to wifi. It has only happened twice in the past week, but usually if I just squeeze the top while trying to connect it will connect (which I should not have to do, but it is better than nothing).2. Finger prints. You will get fingerprints EVERYWHERE on this thing. The screen, the body, the bottom....everywhere. But it comes with a cleaning cloth that is very very very durable, and I noticed that if you clean it right away, you won't have a problem. But if you wait to clean it, you may find it harder to clean. If not, you can just use a little water on your finger and wipe it clean.If you are thinking about getting this or an iPad you should seriously consider your options. Many people that have iPhones and iPads love my tablet. Mostly because iOS does not have widgets or scrollable wallpapers. Also, you can download many different keyboard apps to help on screen typing to become much easier by using just your thumbs. Also, take into consideration the aspect ratio. The iPad is a 4:3 and this tablet is a 16:4. 4:3 is old square screen (back from the turn of the century), so if you view a lot of widescreen material, which is most media now a days, you will be diassapointed viewing on the iPad, because it will leave two big black bars on your screen (which ultimately makes the image smaller). If you ever watch some commericials on HD channels, some of the commercials are not in HD format so you will notice two black bars on each side of the screen, that is what the iPad is. So when it does view HD or widescreen media, it is not full screen (which annoys me, and is why I decided against the iPad). On this, widescreen is the format, so there are no black bars.", "Title": "Best of Show", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Author": "William W.

Initially I simply wanted a way to read my school text books without carrying them around.  At first I was going to get a kindle.  However, the IPad was starting to come out, so I decided that why not get a \"reader\" that also can help with researching on the web?  I am an anti-apple guy and just could not bring myself to purchase an IPAD, especially since it didn't even come with a camera at the time.  So, I decided on upgrading my phone to the Motorola Droid X.  I loved the Android software and the screen was big enough to read books.Fast forward to about 5 months ago.  I seriously started researching the various Android tablets, which had flooded the market since I had first begun thinking about a tablet.  I am an information hound and love looking stuff up on the fly and my laptop was always in the way at home.  Therefore, I was now on the market for an Android tablet.  The Xoom and Galaxy were priced too high for me, the Toshiba Thrive was appealing, but the Sony 32 GB was what really caught my eye.  Then, after feverishly researching in late November, I started to see Asus pop up.  I had never heard of Asus, so I was skeptical.  Wasn't sure it was something like those generic brands such as Coby, or Pan Digital.  I was determined to buy a quality tablet, one which I would not come back later and wish I had spent the extra money afterall.  The Transformer Prime was listed at $500 for 32 gb, with the fastest processor, better cameras, latest Android software, and was not bulky like the Thrive.I was so excited that I put in an order both on Amazon and Best Buy with Amazon coming through first to my pleasure (I am a loyal Amazonian).  First impression:1)  What a beautiful screen!  The colors were crisp, clear.... breathtaking!  I never imagined such a thin piece of technology could look so good.2)  Super fast.  I am not sure what issues people are referring to with regards to the Wifi.  I click on the browser and wham! My homepage pops up and I am able to surf quicker than my pc, or laptop.3)  Really thin!  To be honest, I am not sure if this is really a good thing.  I bought my Wife the brand new Acer A200 and the thickness and almost rubber back makes for a better grip.  I cannot wait till the case I ordered comes in because I am nervous about dropping it.4)  A little confusing to navigate through the menus.  It might be the Android $.) (which I upgraded immediately), or the Asus built in software.  I am used to my Droid X, so it may just be lie when I first used Windows Vista.  Hated it at first, but after getting used to it, I can't imagine going back to the prevoius Windows versions.Pros:-The responsivness and clear video makes for great game play, picture viewing, watching videos, etc.  I am not sure what most people are expecting from a tablet, but this is the most important to me.-The price is extremely pleasing, especially since Samsung is selling their 8.9\" unit for $450!-The camera placements are perfect and the quality of pictures are better than most cameras I have owned.  I will enjoy taking videos of my kids to upload without having to wait for my phone's camera to respond.Cons:-File management.  I may just need to spend more time playing with it, but it is a little confusing.  Also, the Asus \"My Net\" software used for connecting to other units either doesn't work properly, or is just lacking in capabilities.  I should be able to connect and access the files on my other systems connected to my Wifi at the house.  So far, I have not been able to figure out how to do this.  I want to be able to transfer music and pictures from one system to another like I do now between my laptop and pc.-No print option.  I am researching now how to print via my Prime, but all I find are folks who tell me to use a print app, all of which are not as easy to use as I had hoped.I will follow up later after gaining more experience with my Prime.  However, I am extremely pleased that I did not have to purchase an Ipad to get the speed, responsiveness and screen clarity all in a very light and thin (almost too thin) tablet.

So far it has been flawless for me.  Everything runs great and I've only run into the GPS issue which seems to have since been fixed.  I hate to write one of those glowing reviews for a controversial product that tends to get ignored but this has genuinely been my experience thus far.Wifi:I know this has been one of the complaints but for me I haven't found this to be an issue.  I have a two story house plus finished basement.  I can use the tablet from anywhere in the house and even outside without losing signal (that is not dropping connection obviously as I get further away the meter reports lower signal).  So I can't complain here, I was using it from my car as we pulled out of the driveway and it wasn't until after we got a house or two away before it completely stopped.GPS:Initially I couldn't get a GPS lock at all though largely I wasn't concerned since I never really considered that important for my use since my phone would be far more likely to be used for that.  After a firmware update yesterday though the GPS instantly locks and seems to work fine though (noticed this while showing someone the tablet today and they asked about the issue).  I've tried repeatedly and every time it has worked fine.Outside of those issues I think universally people have liked the rest of the tablet and for me I agree everything seems to run great and work well.  The screen is beautiful and displays crisply and brightly.  My only complaints would be that they should have just let go of the Christmas season and just waited a month to get all the fixes in right from the start and have supply on hand to fulfill orders.  They would have lost some sales but not nearly as much as has probably been caused by the complaints of those who got the tablets before the updates went out.My recommendation is definitely if you are in the market for a full fledged high end tablet that this one is worth getting without any reservations.

It was fast and ran everything as smooth as silk. After a while, things began going downhill gradually, and the love affair basically ended. The wifi speed was always slow, but it eventually began to gnaw at me how terrible this thing was when I really needed it. Updates from Asus became few and far between and after releasing the new version of this tablet just a short couple of months later they abandoned this and everyone who had initially defended this device in the beginning. I was able to salvage a bit of usability by installing a custom ROM, but just recently the camera has stopped working, which is apparently just par for the course for the Transformer Prime.

On the positive side, it is well built and sturdy, light, and very fast for a tablet. If not for one key issue, I'd give the TF201 a five star rating.Unfortunately, the ability of the TF201 to receive and hold WiFi signals is sub-par at best. I've now had the ability to compare the WiFi range to three different devices - My wife's Lenovo Laptop, a Droid X (yes, with Wifi, and not 3G), and and version 1 iPad. Compared to these three devices, the TF201 has a significantly reduced range. As an example, my wireless router is in my basement, and when I am in my master bedroom, which is located on the first floor of my home, I cannot get a good steady WiFi link with the TF201, which causes intermittent internet access at best. All three devices which I mentioned not only get a good WiFi signal, but are able to stream video flawlessly.This is a serious defect. First of all, if all I was using this device for is to look at youtube video's of cats transforming in to croissants, then who cares. I bought this device to do work on. In one case, I was unable to get to my online folders, send email, or collaborate online while I was away on business for work. Yes, I was able to wander down to the lobby of the hotel where there was better signal, but that really isn't the point.I consider this device to be a premium product - it was quite costly, and was designed to compete with the iPad, and Samsung Galaxy as one of the premier tablets. If WiFi is compromised, it limits the portability aspect of a tablet, which is one of the main features of this type of device. Getting WiFi right should be such a basic feature - ASUS should never have really let this device out of the lab, and they must have know that it's WiFi capability was insufficient.Also, the TF201, at the time of purchase also stated that it has GPS, and I assumed that it would function similar to an android phone's navigation. No dice on the GPS either - the signal is so weak that it can't be used reliably at all.I'm keeping the TF201, because I can \"work around\" it's deficiencies, but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth w.r.t ASUS, whom I have bought PC components from before with no issues.

After reading all the glowing articles and reviews on those tech websites about the new Prime, I was left drooling and had to have it. I had also read some of the negative comments from people that began receiving their orders and were experiencing some issues. So, I was excited, but also somewhat apprehensive. After waiting anxiously for several weeks, I finally received my Prime on 1/6. I spent the next several days puting it through its paces. I knew there were issues with the GPS, which I was able to confirm. It was a disappointment, but not a deal breaker for me. I also experienced issues with weak Wifi and Bluetooth reception. Although I never lost wifi connectivity within the house, it was pretty weak in certain areas of the house especially my backyard, which I never experienced with my other Transformer or laptops. I could definitely see the weak wifi being a problem at public locations, such as hotels and airports. Besides the GPS, Wifi and BT issues, I noticed the tablet was considerably slow while browsing. It was almost painful - to the point that on one occasion, I put it down and used my old laptop to finish what I was doing.On 1/9, I was pleasantly surprised that the ICS upgrade was made available. After installing it, I noticed the Prime seemed to come to life. Apps and especially the stock browser worked much faster. However, I soon experienced other problems including the email client and browser requiring a force close every other time. I also noticed flashing anomalies on the home screen - sections of the screen would flash and go dark.I loved everything else about the Prime. The thin, light form factor, the brilliant IPS screen, Tegra 3 optimized games. So, it was with a heavy heart that I drove to Best Buy this afternoon to return it. If Asus can fix the issues on the Prime, I would consider purchasing it again.

I was a little less familiar with some of the applications in it.  For example, there are \"hidden\" menus for many programs, and it took me a little while to develop the habit of where to touch on the screen to access these things, but not extremely long.  If you are a person how doesn't mind tapping a few places and finding where things are, this should not be a problem.  It's just the basic learning curve, and does not apply to this specific tablet, but rather the Android OS.The tablet itself is fairly light.  I have not handled a lot of other tablets, however, so I cannot compare.  But because I am used to carrying around a laptop and books for school all the time, this it seems light to me.  However, it does have enough wait that you don't feel like throwing it around.  I like that however.  It weighs just enough to make you think twice about throwing it around, which I would not recommend anyway at this price.  Which leads me to the price...It is certainly expensive.  And if you are looking for only an eReader, this is overpriced and overpowered for you.  However, if you are like me, where you want something much closer to a laptop/netbook/notebook, but want the general feel of an eReader, then this is a great choice.  It's cheaper than the iPad 2, unless you buy the iPad 2 on a contract, which ends up costing you more in the long-run anyway.  For a quad core processor and a solid feeling tablet, this price is actually much better than some of the \"last generation\" tablets which only have a single or dual core processor.  Therefore, unless you are planning to wait until the next round of tablets that comes out later this year and onwards, this tablet will meet or beat most (or all?) of the other options in terms of price and performance.With the newest update of the Android OS, you can control the screen brightness (ie. ICS - not sure what the abbreviation means).  Because of this, if you are in a low light area, you can turn down the brightness to the lowest setting, and this really helps me because you can still use it perfectly, but it doesn't strain my eyes as much as a bright screen does.  Even better, it only takes two taps on the screen to make this change, so it is much faster than doing it on a laptop, for instance.The battery life, because of the ICS setting, is much better than I was expecting.  I also turned off the GPS setting, which I don't really need anyway.  The combination of these two things, and turning off the screen when not in use, has allowed me to use it between 2 and 3 days.  Because a lot of the usage is me reading books (I am a graduate student, I read a *lot*), I actually keep the screen on a lot.  So, I would estimate that I keep the screen on, plus wifi, plus occasionally doing other things like checking email, for approximately 4-6 hours a day.  This is, of course, spread out throughout the day.  And so, I would venture to say that I can use it without the need to charge for about 8-12 hours of \"constant\" usage.  This is beyond what I expected when purchasing the tablet.  And that means I am really happy!The headphone jack allows for headphones, and the quality through that is pretty good.  I have not played a ton of music, so I cannot really talk too much about good or bad.  But it seems at least comparable to listening to music through my phone or laptop on headphones.  There is also a speaker, which is admittedly not amazing.  I mean, there isn't a tone of space for high quality speakers inside.  But it is not awful by any means, either.  In addition to the listening capabilities, the microphone appears to be pretty decent also.  I played 5 different songs (two of which were Chinese songs - from China, which Mandarin Chinese lyrics) with Shazam, and Shazam got all the songs correct within 5-20 seconds of listening.  There was not a huge amount of background noise, but the microphone picked up these songs well enough for Shazam to work flawlessly, so I have to assume that it is of at least moderate quality.OVERALL CONCLUSION:  No regrets after almost 2 weeks of owning the Transformer Prime (TF201).  It is a little expensive, but the quality and it's ability to take whatever I throw at it shows that it is worth the extra money over most other options.  If you are in the market for a good tablet, at about the average high-end tablet price, then the TF201 is highly recommended!", "Title": "Very pleased with this tablet!", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Author": "Eftyking \"Eftyking\"", "ReviewID": "R3PL7MNGJDH4TL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I guess I feel lucky considering some people seem to be getting lemons.

They arrived and were all that I'd hoped they would be for ~1 month until I tried to dock the tablet to the keyboard today and it wouldn't go all of the way down into the keyboard. Closer examination revealed that one of the screws had come out of the keyboard and was rattling around loose in the clam shell.I figured that I would just pull the clamshell apart and put the screw back in with some of the blue lock tight as that looked like what the factory had done (admittedly not well given that it had come out on me) initially. I got looking at the tablet though, and there must have been a period of time where the screw was loose and rubbing up against the gorilla glass because I've got a circular scratch in the glass.It's a minor point, but my view is that the problem is completely the fault of ASUS.  It's a combination of the keyboard being improperly assembled, and a design that could have been better. Hindsight is 20/20, but they probably should have put a plastic facing over the screws so the if one came up like that it would push the plastic into the channel and stop the tablet from getting down far enough to get scratched up.ASUS support was spectacularly disappointing. I use my Prime every day as a laptop replacement and will be traveling over the next little while, so I asked them to ship me out another tablet and keyboard so that I could continue working, and I'd ship them my original as soon as I had the replacement model.The rep said that they wouldn't do anything because the tablet hadn't been functionally impacted. I pointed out that the docking station at this point had been functionally compromised, and said that while the tablet hadn't been functionally compromised, the glass had been scratched up through an error on the part of the factory in the assembly of the keyboard.He said that they wouldn't do any kind of hot swap to allow me to continue to work with my Prime, but that he could arrange for a shipment of my gear back to a repair center where it could be evaluated, but 'if the damage was judged to be user error' that the warranty wouldn't cover it.I told him I didn't think that was reasonable, but that I can't go without my Prime for the time required to ship it back and forth, so I'd just fix the keyboard myself as I originally intended, and then I'd leave a negative review around the quality of their support and the poor build quality on the keyboard.Pretty disappointed all in all with the overall experience.", "Title": "Great Product, Terrible Support, Not Worth the Wait", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Author": "funkyshoes", "ReviewID": "R2OOB4NZ7CIEIN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I ordered this tablet from Amazon but it was going to take maybe 3wks to a month to get here, and frankly I don't have that kind of patience.

It was completely dead. I plugged it in and within a few minutes it started up.I must of gotten a newer one since it already had ICS 4.0 when i checked.There were a few setup steps but it recognized the wi-fi with no issues. big reliefThe only SMALL issue i had was with setting of the time.  I configured it to automatically to set the time based on my location but the system didn't know that until I powered it completely off and turned it back on.other than that one little issue its been a dream to use.I used it the first day with about only 50% charge the whole time while it was charging.  I let it charge over night and started using it in \"power\" mode and after 3 hours of emails/surfing and downloading magazines/books its at ~90% charge... all i need is it too last 8 hours.  I also can get more out if it by putting it in power saving mode - which activates the 5th hidden cpu core.while in power mode i didn't get any crashes or notice it getting warm.its very crisp and fast... I don't notice it being obviously faster or sharper image than an iPad 1 or 2 ... maybe you can tell if you hyper analyze the two screens in a side by side comparison.  Technically its got less pixels than a iPad 3 ... but the gpus play a big part in making a movies seem crisp. i noticed that going from iPad 1 to 2.The prime has 12 gpus while the iPad 3 only has 4.  Asus needs to advertise that fact better. the prime also lets you choose power consumptions modes.. its sort of like a hybrid car.  there a \"Power\", \"Balanced\" and \"eco\" modes that effect the battery use.Our family had 3 iPads before i got this one. my daughter has the original iPad(64 gb)  and my wife and i had ipad2s. I gave my iPad(16gb) to our parents so we can FaceTime with them easier. it also let me have a reason to get the prime. I was constantly running out of space on my 16 gb iPad that won't happen for a while on my Prime with its expandable memory.if u want a device \"just to use\" just get a iPad... if you want to tinker get a prime. I have two CS degrees so I obviously fall into the latter category. :)From a usability POV different android applications do everything slightly different enough to make the experience not as perfectly smooth as using an iPad... but thats the sort of thing that makes apple so much better at appealing to grand parents and non-techies. I've had two other android phones an the UI drove me nuts to the point I sold the samsung galaxy s2 for a iPhone 4s... but a phone is something I use primarily for very frequent brief activities like making a call or quickly checking emails so the little hiccups with the ui annoyed me more.  With a tablet i tend to use it less frequently but for each instance for longer periods so the little ui discrepancies bother me less.overall its a phenomenal tablet! between the hardware and ice cream sandwich this tablet is the first one that made me turn my back  on the iPad.for 32 gb its actually $50 cheaper than the 32 gb equivalent iPad PLUS you can expand it by 64 gb for about $99 for the price of a micro sd card... which I'm sure in 6 months will be half of that :) while apple 64 gb will still be $700!Get it if you can... if it doesn't work Amazon will let you return it, so your covered that way", "Title": "works perfectly", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Author": "Tiago Pereira", "ReviewID": "R8Y2NG2GAYQJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first tablet, so I don't have much to compare. I have played with it for more than a week and got the new GPS dongle today from Asus (Fedex'ed from Sunnyvale, CA, surprisingly quick!).In terms of the tablet, it is responsive and seems to work reliably. Mine is a 'C3' serial number and came with ICS pre-installed. There was an issue with the Netflix app that kept crashing. Upgrading would not work in the tablet, but going to <...> on my laptop I could reinstall and the issue was fine. I don't use many of the pre-installed apps, although I was negatively surprised that the google voice does not allow one to make calls directly from the tablet. Instead, you can only connect calls to gmail (on a computer?) or to your phone(s). Reinstalled to no avail. Not sure if this is a limitation imposed by Asus or Google, given that it works on android phones.The HDMI out works ok. When connected to an external monitor, it assumes that it also takes sound and mutes the internal speakers. Because my monitor doesn't have speakers, I would like to hear the sound from the tablet, but it doesn't seem possible. It also only seems to output 720p unless you are playing a 1080p movie, which is annoying if you want to work on a 1080p monitor. But I guess all of these are limitations of Android, and not necessarily this tablet.After reading the reviews, I was concerned with the wifi performance. Did some tests at home and was really worried. My room is about 20 m (60 ft) away from the router, and the download speeds I was getting were about 5 times slower than at the router. My laptop in the room worked almost the same. And not only the speed, but the latency was also affected. Sometimes connectivity was very poor, and I believe I was getting some packet loss. I was almost at the point of returning the tablet, until I decided to change my wifi channel. Turns out I was on channel 1, a popular choice in the neighbourhood. Changing to another channel (8) seemed to work wonders. I have repeated the test a few times, and here are the pseudo-scientific numbers:* At the router: ping 36 ms; Dl 22708 kbps; Ul 6408 kbps (4 bars)* One room away (1 thin wall, about 7 m): ping 23 ms; Dl 16075 kbps; Ul 6901 kbps (3 bars)* Two rooms away (2 thin walls, about 20 m): ping 26 ms; Dl 13507 kbps; Ul 6348 kbps (3/2 bars)* Three rooms away (3 thin walls, about 24 m): ping 25 ms; Dl 14598 kbps; Ul 6600 kbps (2 bars)For reference, with my laptop at two rooms away I got: ping 22 ms; Dl 14684 kbps; Ul 6348 kbps (all bars).So it seems that this tablet has good wifi capabilities but is very sensitive to wifi interference on the same channel. Unfortunately this is not something one can control when on the go, but for home use or in places without many networks it should work fine.Now, about the GPS dongle. Received it today, and seems to work very well indoors (did not check outdoors). I can immediately connect to more than twice as many satellites, and it is much faster. Unfortunately, leaving the dongle on causes the tablet to reboot. While I had it on navigation there were no issues, but when I left it on and the screen went to sleep, a few seconds later it was rebooting. First time it was strange, so I repeated the procedure and it does it every time. I have caused it to reboot three times this way just to check. Hopefully Asus can fix this in a software update, otherwise I will come back here and take one star from the review.", "Title": "Decent tablet, GPS dongle has issues", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Author": "Devin", "ReviewID": "R3T7VBJBO0ITH8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So, like many others, I had WiFi issues with this device.  I sent the device back to Asus and based on the parts list they added a \"Conductive Sponge\", \"MB Top Absorber\", and \"Flange PCB & GPS Foil\".  After the repairs, the WiFi still didn't stay connected for more than a minute or two at a time.  I ended up replacing our old Linksys WRT160N v3 with an Asus RT-N56U and now the Transformer Prime stays connected without issues.  Now that the WiFi issues are fixed, I don't have any complaints about the tablet.  The interface is extremely responsive and games are smooth.The only complaints I have are in regards to Asus support. First, they aren't very responsive.  The online ticket system states that they will respond within 48 hours of submitting a ticket.  It took them 2 weeks to get back to me, and then they just said to put in an RMA request as this may be a hardware issue.  I put in the RMA request, and that was approved in about a week. After shipping the tablet to Asus, I received no confirmation that it was ever received or an ETA for when it would be finished. Even so, the device was fixed in about a week and a half, and I received notification that the tablet was being shipped back to me. Now that it's fixed I'd say it's worth 5 stars, but I got the device back in late January and it's just now working properly, so I'm giving it 4 starts instead.", "Title": "Great aside from WiFi issues", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Author": "Taz", "ReviewID": "R1Y4F4JHKRRA61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I got this tablet it instantly installed ice cream sandwich update and have enjoyed it from day one.

All reviews praised about how fast this is.  But I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed.  Once in a while, the browser would hesitate and even pop up asking me whether I want to kill it or wait.The 2-finger pinch/zoom is too sensitive and it often over zooms it.  My HTC android phone has a better browser pinch/zoom than this.  Also, the browser on my HTC seems to have better auto-size capability than the browser on the Prime.I am a bit baffled as why some common 2-finger gestures do not work in the browser.  e.g. 2-finger swipe left/right to back/forward web pages, which are quite common on Acer or Asus laptops' touchpads.The keyboard dock is solid, well-built, and it integrates well with tablet.  Keys are fine but I find myself missing the right \"Shift\" key often.  So far, the only 2-finger gesture is just scrolling web pages on touchpad.  Again, my Acer and Asus laptops' touchpads could do a lot more by default.Overall, it's an excellent product.  I just feel I was disappointed on a few areas.  Perhaps, due to my own unfamiliarity with the product at this point.  Will provide updates later if I feel any different.==============UPDATE================================================Today, I suddenly noticed the face panel of tablet is slightly warped on the left edge (where the volume control is).  When running my finger across the panel, I could feel the \"curvature\".  If looking closely, I could see a gap between the face panel and the casing.  The length of the gap is about 1.5 inches.  I am taking another star off the rating.  Good thing is that I could still return this tablet with such defect back to Amazon for a full refund.The reason I am returning instead of getting a replacement is that, as much as I want a tablet, I find myself tired of holding the tablet when using it.  I want to put it into its keyboard dock most of the time.  However, the keyboard is just too small for extensive typing and the touch pad on the dock isn't really that good.  Therefore, I ended up wanting to use my Acer S3 Ultrabook instead because of its larger screen and excellent touch pad.So, I have been asking myself a hard question this week: Do I really need a $650 tablet & dock if I use it like a netbook most of the time???The finding of the warped face panel finally made me face the reality: I do NOT need a tablet because of my usage pattern.  A thin, light-weight, and instant-on Ultrabook can best meet my needs.", "Title": "A little disappointed ... so far", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Author": "Don Alan Uhrig", "ReviewID": "R1GAWLRLKBXR6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I could, I will not be writing a long technical review. Others have done that, and I have read all the pros and cons.Short story: The Asus Transformer Prime has been in my hands for two weeks now and has performed flawlessly. Not a single program has crashed. I have not had any forced closures. I have not had to reboot my tablet. (Makes me wonder what these other people are doing.)The tablet is beautiful and perfect. I like how easy it is to get to settings when, for example, I need to add a wi-fi location. One or two taps is all it takes to get to the most frequently used settings or applications.The tablet runs nearly every app that I had on my Android phone. What doesn't run is accessable via web browser - and actually using my banking in the web browser gives me access to ALL features whereas the bank app did not.One concern some might have with a tablet is some things only work when you are connected to the internet. I have no concerns about wi-fi access, because my android phone can be turned into a hotspot (yes, slower than broadband, but it does work).Only once have I run the battery down to 20% and that was during my longest day on my college campus - Thursdays - and I was showing off the screen by running in Super ISP mode quite a bit, and watched a movie. I actually didn't realize the 20% till I got home.

My first impressions when it arrived was that there were a few minor scuffs on it.  Not a huge deal but I expect like new to look \"like new.\"  To me, there's no wiggle room in making that claim.  \"good\" or \"very good\" are another story...But anyway I felt it was just good enough to keep so our adventure began... with a thud.  After the first couple hours I was honestly going to send it back.  The screen went fuzzy and I had to restart it, there were several hang ups and freezes, The Wi-Fi reception was terrible if at all.  The next day after several updates it started working much much better, no more freezes or screen problems, the Wi-Fi while still not great, didn't go below 2 bars even with the router in the basement of my Brick Ranch House and me being upstairs as far away as I could get.  It just kept getting better over the coming days.  I installed about a hundred free apps from the Playstore and most worked great no matter how graphicly demanding the game was.  And with 32GB of built in memory you can hold alot of em.  I added a 32GB micro SD card so I could easily put 720p HD shows and movies on it and watch them on the Asus Prime.  They play seamlessly and look great on the screen.Several days ago the Jellybean update came available to my Prime, I downloaded it and to my surprise, its running even better yet.  I usually get 3 bars of reception in the house and it seems faster and snapier yet.Pro's:  Fast Quad-Core processor with Tegra 3 graphics chip.  Great Graphics and better Tegra 3 apps are yet to come.  Super IPS LCD display.  This thing gets really bright and vibrant.  Best screen I've seen on any tablet.  32GB of built in memory, holds alot of stuff!  And another 32GB can be added with the micro SD card slot for cheap (under $20).  Has HDMI, and looks very good using your HDTV as a monitor, full 1080p output.  Gorilla Glass, that's very tough stuff for a screen.  My Droid Bionic has it and hasn't scatched yet after a year of constant use with no screen protector on it. 1080p rear facing camcorder with 8MP Digital Camera.  Takes some really good natural looking pictures and video.  Does decent in low-light.  Not the best HD I've ever seen, but very decent.  Some of the newer tablets are ditching the rear camera and that's a shame.  It's nice to take some video and watch it right there on the 10.1 inch display for all to see.  Has a 1.2MP Front Facing camera,  Works surprizingly well.  Shoots video at 480p and is perfect for skype.  Has a metal body, you just don't see that kind of quality much these days.Long Long Battery Life! and lasts longer if you turn it down to single or duel core mode.  Touch Screen is perfect! Totally responsive but not overly sensitive, just right.  Full access to Android App Store.Cons:  1280x800 screen, looks great in my opinion but may turn off some looking for 1080 or 1200p displays.Metal Body, on this one, its blessing is also its curse.  Some say the metal body makes the GPS unfunctional and hurts its WiFi reception.  My WiFi seems fine but I can't speak of the GPS, I don't use it on this device and could care less if it works or not, but if GPS is important to you, it might be wise to look elsewhere.  The rear camera has the most Un-wide angle lens I've ever seen on any recording device.  Wow, how did Asus achieve such a narrow field of view?  I'm not sure?  You could of done better on that one guys...  The speaker.  Really bad and tinny sounding.  It's a single speaker, not duel, so it sounds even worse then most.  Bad sound aside, you also you can't turn it up very loud.  There are free apps available that allow you to turn the sound up louder, get one.  Also  plan on adding a portable plug and play speaker, I did. I bought a Logitech Tablet Sound Bar due to the affordable price and the fact my Logitech laptop soundbar worked so well.  However I don't recommend the Tablet version, better sound then the built in speaker but doesn't get loud enough.

I had no fear of shipping damage after I held the box in my hands. Inside was 10.1 inches of widescreen gadget glory, and a few accessories, (Charger, USB cable, microfiber cloth, manual)Tablet was heavier than I imagined, but had a GREAT feel to it. Mind-blowingly thin. The back of the device has a nice matte feel due to the anodized brushed aluminum surface. It is a pleasure to hold in both hands, and absolutely is nice to look at. It is a little bit heavy when holding with just one hand, but that is to be expected with 10.1 inch tablets. The edges are a little sharp, not annoyingly so, but definitely noticable. The finish on the back is a very dark grayish-purple. Yes, purple, but not immasculine. Its a great color for the device, absolutely no complaints on style.Screen:This thing is gorgeous. The pixel density is just right for this size device, and reading web pages is an easy process. The contrast is fantastic for an LCD, and the colors absolutely pop. I'm no display expert, but I know for certain this is the best display I have ever seen on a tablet, smartphone, netbook, and 99% of laptops. It can get obscenely bright in \"Super IPS\" mode, which is great for using outdoors, which was once no-mans-land for LCD displays.UI/SoftwareIt is running Android 3.2.1 Honeycomb. Just that sentence alone will give you some insight on the UI's look and feel and responsiveness. I like the look and layout of Honeycomb, but the optimization and snappyness is subpar. Of course I will attribute this purely to the sluggish mess that is Android Honeycomb, and not to the blazing fast quad-core monster inside of the deivce. The included Asus UI is great, I have no complaints about any of the menu layouts or widgets etc, in fact, it is very nice to look at. Props to Asus for making a smart, sensible UI layer that anyone can use. The included cloud storage, \"Webshare\" or something of the sort is nice to have, but I will probably stick to dropbox for my cloud storage. Asus includes remote desktop software that works flawlessly, and a DLNA streaming app that I find intuitive and well executed.Honestly, any software problems or sluggishness will be addressed with ICS on January 12th, so I am not worried about it for now.Hardware/performanceHoly crap.This machine is fast. It absolutely slaughters every other device in EVERY benchmark. Well done, NVIDIA, this Tegra 3 chip is a phenom. The performance is most apparent in gaming, when all four cores are working to their full potential. Games have that extra layer of realism that really makes the difference between mobile gaming, and real, console quality stuff.One spec I did not realize was included in this machine is the ability to play games in real, stereoscopic 3d when connected to a 3DTV. I played Riptide GP in 3d, and Shadowgun in 3d as well on my 50 inch samsung plasma, and I was floored! Definitely a huge statement to the performance of this machine. Well done, everyone.Really no more needs to be said about this device's performance other than \"its fast. really fast.\"CameraCameras on tablets look ridiculous. This is true with any tablet. One cannot pull out a 10.1 tab and casually snap a few shots. The whole thing is a rather hilarious affair. Otherwise, the Cameras on the TF201 are absolutely top notch. Video is clear and smooth in 1080p, and still shots look better than my point'n'shoot. The webcam works great for skype. Good work team.Video playbackFlawless with MX Video Player. 1080p30 on a 50 inch plasma is fantastic. No complaints, and no more needs to be said. It just works.And now for the bad.The GPS issue is a well documented problem. There are ons of explanations for why the GPS is not as accurate as one would hope. Basically, Asus missed a key design point here. The aluminum construction blocks radio waves in a big way. It is a simple fix that could have been prevented by Asus when designing the thing.Wifi performance is also affected, though less noticably. The range is not as good as my thinkpad's. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a rather glaring oversight.EDIT: (Lighthearted sarcasm alert)Who uses a tablet without 3G for GPS anyways? I mean cmon guys. Its a wifi tablet. Using this as a nav system in my car would give me a good chuckle, and really nothing else.Ignore the one-star whiners that don't even own the thing.

I ordered the device through amazon and it was delivered within one day with free shipping (nicely done Amazon)!!!  When I started using the device I started noticing minor problems with WiFi connectivity and connection speeds.  When I was next to my wireless router, the connections were good as expected (16Mbps give or take).  When I moved one room away in the house I would get a speed of about 8Mbps.  When I moved even further away in my house the speeds would plunge down to about 300Kbps.

I was hoping that some software updates promised from ASUS would fix this unacceptable WiFi behavior within my product return window but alas this did not to happen.

When outside I could weakly detect several satilites after waiting many minutes.  And even after all of this time it was unable to get better positioning accuracy than about 75ft.  This was evident when using google maps with GPS enabled - The map was centered over my neighbors house across the street.  No updates that ASUS furnished resolved this problem.

I did all of this wilh the standard Android Honeycomb 3.2 that came on it before running the update to ICS that I was prompted to install.

Using a wi-fi analyzer I was able to determine that the other device had slightly better reception, but not to a point of affecting performance.

I have a DroidX which was my first smartphone just a year and a half ago. I didn't get an iPhone because I didn't want to use AT&T;, and when Verizon picked it up, I decided I wasn't going to change phones and stick with Android. It's funny, but some friends were sooo excited to get \"new\" things on their iPhones recently and it was stuff I've had on my DroidX since I got it. I don't get the hype. I know PCs like the back of my hand, and we have a MAC at home which drives me nuts sometimes because I can't clean it up or really find where files are stored (and what's up with not being able to copy cd's?).So I finally really really wanted a tablet, but which one to get? Here's what I was looking for:1) Wanted the 10.1 size, not the \"mini\" 7\"-8\" tablets that are out there. I have a smartphone, so I don't need a slightly larger one.2) WiFi only, did not want another phone/data plan.3) Front facing camera so the grandparents could Skype with the granddaughter and not be tied to the desktop computer. So this ruled out the Kindle Fire.4) Removable/upgradable storage. I like having an SD card on my phone to transfer photos and stuff, and wanted to have the same option on my tablet. Also allows to upgrade from 32GB to 64GB without spending the extra $$ for it internally. Sorry iPad, I guess this rules you out. The thought of having to sync through iTunes made me cringe, I like to be able to just select what files I want and copy to a thumbdrive or SD card and move it over.I was originally looking at the Xoom2, but when it finally released it was 3G only and pretty expensive. In reading reviews for that one I found out about the Transformer Prime. I knew of Asus only because I had bought my husband a netbook a couple a years ago by them because of great reviews.So I read the early reviews for the Transformer Prime and waited patiently to order (this was early December). Finally ordered on the 19th and waited patiently again. I received my Prime on Jan 21st, which was ok with me since all the updates were rolled out (like Ice Cream Sandwich) while I was waiting.I love my new tablet, it's bright and sharp and quick. It did it's upgrades right away and Ice cream sandwich is great. I never used Honeycomb but I like ICS better than Gingerbread. I don't have any WiFi issues, always have 3-4 bars in my house. I haven't even turned on the GPS yet because I have my phone for that when I'm out. For those Apple versus Android people who love to do comparisons, the iPad2 doesn't even come equipped with GPS on the WiFi only model.What makes this tablet great compared to others is that you can buy the dock and turn it into a \"laptop/netbook\" and also get an extra battery. This was really cool to me since I get tired of pecking/Swype. The USB port is also a bonus for transferring stuff off my thumbdrive.I'm not concerned about the 700T tablet with it's HD display, 2Mp camera . Don't think I need that for an extra $100. The battery life will probably take a hit, and there will always be something better a few months later. I'm sure after HD tablets they will start making 3D display tablets.So there's my 2cents for what it's worth, now I can start wondering what phone to get with my \"new every 2\" on Verizon.", "Title": "My first tablet", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Author": "RoyHobbs", "ReviewID": "R3R78H9SY8NAHN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Update of July 2013This tablet is now a piece of useless junk. The repair shop says ASUS will not ship any replacement screens.Isn't that great support?This is the last piece of ASUS crap I ever buy. I rate this tablet a zero if I could.And, by the way, thanks ASUS for denying me my dongle to fix the Wi-Fi/GPS when I was one of the first to buy this worthless piece of crap.Update of June 2013This new update drops this unit from a 4 star down to a 1 star:I was inserting the screen into the keyboard as per usual and the screen cracked. No reason for this to happen especially since this is supposed to be gorilla glass? Even if it isn't Gorilla Glass this should not have happened. I sent it out for a glass replacement and received the reply that the repair can't be done as the repair shop keeps getting defective screens from ASUS. WTF. So I did a little searching and found out that this problem isn't unique to my repair shop - no one is getting any decent glass from ASUS to repair these tablets.HMMMM..... Everyone, both owners and repair shops seem to imply that ASUS would rather you buy a new tablet than repair your defective tablet.Pretty scummy treatment from ASUS.Not sure if my tablet will ever be fixed but I am sure that this is the last ASUS purchase I ever make.Update of Jan 20, 2012Just installed the free printbot app so I can print to my hardwired HP2100TN laser printer via my D-Link DIR655 wireless/wired router. Got my Ice Cream Sandwich update a week ago, firmware updates yesterday and it has been working flawlessly. I don't seem to have any problems with WiFi strength or GPS but I haven't used the ASUS GPS app that much. I used to live on my XP laptop but I hardly touch it anymore (Linux next maybe?). At first, I thought this couldn't do as much as my XP laptop but the more I use the Prime the more I see it is truly better, easier, more versatile and the screen is fantastic. I can't say Droid or Apple tablets are better but both are better than a traditional windows laptop. I am especially impressed with the way the Prime and keyboard work together when you need it. I take it every where and still leave my emergency phone in my pocket. The smartphones are too small for me and I don't hang on a phone - no twitter/facebook/etc. Great Tablet -  End of update.-----------------------------------------------First of all here's where I'm coming from - I use a windows XP Laptop, an emergency cell phone (no smartphone), and no tablet so this was my first \"upgrade\" in awhile.I'll let everyone else review the apps and technicals - all I want to say is I don't think I could have done any better with my \"upgrade\".1. It's the right size, reminds me of the Mac Airbook I was considering.2. The keyboard dock is great. Keys are comfortable for typing. Quick to dock/undoc. I have several 4G SDHC cards for it. The additional battery life it affords is great.3. The screen is bright and beautiful. I'm downloaded my first Kindle book and reading on the Prime is a quantum leap beyond reading with a Kindle.4. I also bought a 32G microSD chip for the screen, a real plus. I have a USB phone that I will try to use Google Voice with.I'm not committed to Windows or Mac but I use alot of Google apps and, in the final decision, that's what drove me to the Prime over the Mac Airbook, 17\" Windows Laptop and the 2nd place winner Ipad.I'd give it 5 stars but that would be over the top as I'm a newbie with Tablets, Droid/Chrome and haven't used the variety of what is on the market.I highly recommend the Prime and, even more, get the keyboard with it. Carrying the Prime with the dock for me is a no brainer: it protects the Prime, provides extra battery life, and the keyboard is a pleasure to use.Does it do what my laptop does? No, (well, almost) but it doesn't have to - it boots fast, gets me to the web fast, is an excellent reader for Google Currents, NYTimes, Kindle, and is light as a feather even with the keyboard.Are there as many apps as the Ipad? No, but there are apps for everything I need (how many apps do you need?)I do all my shopping at Amazon but, for the first time, I bought this at the BestBuy down the street in case I needed technical support or wanted to return it in a hurry. I'm using the Amazon App Store - easy smeezy.Nice surprise today - I spend way too much time on Baseball-Reference and today I used the Prime to get there instead of my Windows laptop.

I think some people are looking for absolute perfection, and I'm just looking for something that works damn well.  The Prime clears that bar easily in my opinion.The one thing that I am disappointed in (that I did not see mentioned in any other review) is the lack of 5 GHz wireless N.  It supports 2.4 GHz, but not 5 GHz.  From what I've read, the hardware supports it, but ASUS has disabled it in software.  This could be due to the aluminum case, but I do have 5 GHz N deployed in my home, so it would have been nice to use it.

Lightweight feel, extremely thin, extravagant docking keyboard (sold separately; the dock adds USB ports and a HDMI port),and a back and front camera.

I seem to be part of the lucky few who suffer little to no problems (GPS locks on quickly for me now since update and wifi never seemed to be an issue for me).

While I feel like the apps are really what make a tablet worth while, there are too many differences between the same app on both devices that come down to quality of programming spend for the device. Being honest, most developers spend more time/money on the iPad version, then attempt a conversion to Android.I only got to play with the Honeycomb version of this tablet for about 4 days, and it felt very similar to an iPad2: transitions between desktop screens flickered, WiFi worked ok with issues connecting to places like Chic-Fil-A, GPS so slow to connect outdoors but then worked great (not so great indoors). Main drawback to the Prime/Honeycomb tablet was it was constantly referred as a \"phone\". Prompts about making calls, ringtones, vibrate feature etc. It really took away from the tablet only (no 3G/4G available). There WAS no reason to accept this tablet over the iPad2...All this changed with the update to Icecream Sandwich (ICS), transitions between desktop screens is SMOOTH, better than iPad2. WiFi update stablized the issues connecting at Chic-Fil-A, GPS connection improved with an update. All these updates to the system were out within the first MONTH of product release.Now for my tidbit on the app areas: Apple has better apps and more of them, no surprise being the leader. Once you select iPad your into the WHOLE Apple bandwagon with iTunes and iCloud. Now their products just work very well together which is very appealing if you like all their products. Android Marketplace has a lot of great apps, most the same as their iTunes conterpart, however \"some\" are more finicky on Android than iOS. However, the best app reason for Android the ability to install apps from other sources, like Amazon or GetJar. This allows you to bypass Google if desired and pick your own sources for apps.I am in no way an expert and this only represents my opinion.

I really wanted it to replace my iPad 2. My iPad just isn't cutting it any more. I wanted something that was more powerful and verstile. The main features I was missing in the iPad were: flash support, better multitasking, more inputs like USB, sd, micro sd and micro hdmi. I also wanted to be able to customize my tablet more and have more options in terms rooting. Jailbreaking my iPad was still very limited for me.This tablet is far superior than the iPad in many areas. The iPad also has alot advantages over the prime. Although the iPad 2 and the prime are not exactly in the same class in terms of specs and the prime came out 9 months after the iPad 2. I will still be comapring the two since they are the best tablets on the market at this point.The prime has a much better screen in just about every aspect. It has a higher screen resolution and a much brighter screen. I definitely enjoyed watching videos much more on the prime than the iPad 2. The images displayed are much more sharper and crisper. Also the prime has a 16:9 screen versus the upad 2 which has only 4:3 screen. The 16:9 is much better for video viewing. I didn't really enjoy the prime in portrait mode when viewing web pages and reading in general. I much prefer the iPad 2's  4:3 screen for viewing web pages and reading. I really liked the fact that the primes screen can get very bright. This comes in handy when outside with the bright sun and glare. it's very hard to see my iPad 2 in these conditions.The prime is lighter, thinner and easier to hold in landscape mode than the iPad 2.I found the prime overall to be slow, buggy, freezed alot and also crashed quite a bit. In general I was expecting the prime to be faster than the iPad 2 in most tasks. The iPad 2 is much faster in normal tasks like switching apps or launching apps or even just exiting apps. The iPad 2 is also much faster at booting up.The browser seemed to be much slower than the iPads even when I had flash disabled on the browser. The browser seems to crash quite a bit also. I tried a few different browsers and I got pretty much the same result with all of them.I really did enjoy ice cream sandwich. It has some nice features and seems to run pretty fast overall and definitely an improvement over honeycomb.I did experience the wifi issues every one seems to be talking about. My wifi signal strength and speed was alot lower and slower than any other wifi device I own. When compared to my iPad 2 from the same location the prime always had at least one less bar in signal strenght and at least 5mbps slower speed. When observing the wifi signal strenght I noticed it fluctuating up and down for no apparent reason. I have read the wifi speed can be improved by changing the channel on your router to a lower channel and also setting your n router to g only mode. I diidnot make these adjustments to my router so cannot comment on that. In the end I found no matter how low signal or how slow the speeds I was still able to carry a signal and stream hd video.Although I already knew that there aren't that many tablet based apps on the android market. I was still suprised at how few their were when I compared it to my iPad.  Out of my almost 100 tablet based apps on my iPad there were only a handful of the same apps availble on the android market. Initially and I do still beleive when you have a tablet like the prime with a full browser you don't really need apps that muc. Most apps are just differnt versions of a website that actually limit functionality. This is mostly true for Facebook and twitter. I still found myself missing alot my iPad 2 tablet optimized apps.  The number of android tablet apps will get better very soon. I'm sure by may or June there will be alot more and definitely by the end of the year it would have improved significantly as ice cream sandwich is still new. Currently the prime is the only tablet that has ice cream sandwich officially.I was really disappointed when I found out that the prime doesn't support USB mass storage. When connected  to your pc the prime is only recognized in mtp mode. This makes it much harder to transfer files to the prime via USB. Makes it much slower and also which files you can transfer.The speaker on the prime is not as loud as my iPad 2. There are apps that can increase the loudness of the speaker but i expected it to be loud out of the box. The audio quality is better than the ipads speaker though. The llocation of the speaker is very poorly placed. It's placed in the same spot you would put your hand on the right side when holding it landscape mode. Also the position of the other inputs like the mic, headphone jack, power button and volume rocker just didnt make sense to me. Just didn't seem like it was well thought out.One of the other reasons I got the prime was the keyboard dock. Which is a great idea. Combines alot cool features I would love to have. I will be writing a separate review on the keyboard dock at a later point. So please check back later for it.Overall I really liked the prime. Definitely a very good competitor to the iPad 2. But in my case it just wasn't good enough to replace my iPad 2. Many people would be ok with the primes buggyness and instability or it's lack of tablets apps or it's slower browser performance or it's flash issues or any other issues I mentioned. I will eventually replace my iPad 2 with an android tablet. I much prefer android over iOS especially since ice cream sandwich is out now. I am confident the tablet market is going to change alot and very fast in the next 6-12 months as more tablets and apps are released to optimize and take advantage of ice cream sandwich. Another note is that asus has already anounced yet another large tablet which has a better constructed wifi antenna, 1080p screen, better camera and other enhancements. So in just a few short months asus has already updated and made this prime obsolete. Most companies including apple wait a full 12 months to release a new model to their line. This just shows what asus is all about. When there were already major issues with the prime they release a new model without addressing the current primes issues. I have to add that in UK asus has anncounced that they would extend warranties on the prime by 6 months or allow customers to return their primes for a full refund.

The youtube videos started buffering (almost always) while the same videos worked without buffering on the galaxy tab which is connected to the same wifi.By now, I received the keyboard I ordered through target.com and started using the tablet with the keyboard. While it is easier to type using the physical keyboard, it is still not a great user experience compared to a laptop (going back and forth between using the keyboard and the touchscreen for navigating). I tried to convince myself of the several advantages of a tablet over a laptop such as portability, touchscreen feature etc. Well, until I went and checked the new ultra book product lines in bestbuy. 13 inch ultra books (made by Asus, Toship and Samsung) are so lightweight, portable, with several ports (USB, memory card reader etc), and more importantly 3 or 4 times powerful (processor speed and internal memory) than these tablets. Long story short, I ended up returning both my tablet and the keyboard and bought a Toshiba Portege ultrabook. Now, after few months of making that decision, I can testify that I get more done with my ultrabook with more ease with a comfortable keyboard and 13 inch screen.Don't get me wrong. I am not disputing the fact that there is a place for tablets as opposed to ultra-books (or laptops) in our computing needs. But for me, I find using an ultra-book much more convenient and productive.I am taking one star down due to the WIFI issues. Wifi issue apart, all my points in my old review (below) still stands.P.S: I heard that Asus is releasing an improved version of this tablet later this year. Hopefully it comes with a fix for the WIFI issue.---------------------------------------------I can't speak for others but after owning the TF201 for about a week now, I can attest the following:1. As a person a owned galaxy tab (which is also a great tablet) for an year, TF201 outperforms galaxy tab in several major areas.2. WIFI: Stronger than galaxy tab in the same area in my home (My WIFI router is placed in the basement and I can access WIFI on the tablet anywhere in my 2-story home).3. Speed: Way faster than probably any tablet out there (However, you need to change the performance settings from \"balanced\", which is the default setting, in \"balanced\" mode the tab is not using the full power of quad core processor always)4. Screen resolution: Beautiful!5. Style: Supreme!6. Lay out of power, volume control buttons and ports : Brilliant.7. ICS advantage (Apple's iOS would look like a kiddie OS comparing to ICS. Apple: How about copying the re-sizable widget idea (for example) for your next iOS version and market it as is you 'invented' it?)8. Beautiful and powerful Key-board docking option - adds battery life, more ports and convenience of typing using a physical key-board.9. No comment on GPS performance because honestly I haven't tried it and I am not planning to use GPS on a 10.1 inch tablet anyways.10. The only 'con' (which is not really a 'con' of the tablet itself) is the lack of ICS and quad-core specific apps/games available currently. But it's only a matter of time (may be a few months). All the major apps in the market (facebook, g+, gmail, weather, netflix, youtube etc are already upgraded to work on ICS)", "Title": "Great tablet except intermittent WIFI issues.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Author": "B.

Web browsers and other apps frequently hang for up to 10 seconds at a time, causing the system to present the \"Wait / Force Close\" dialog.-Way, way over-priced compared to Asus' other tablet, the Nexus 7-Worst RMA experience of my life.  My device is currently out on RMA and we are approaching 4 weeks and counting.The following is my bad experience with the Asus RMA system, but won't necessarily happen to everyone.  It does, however, illustrate that they are not interested in working with the customer and will do what they can to weasel out of doing repairs.One of the first things I did with this tablet was unlock the bootloader in hopes I could fix the sqlite problem (which I could not.)  Unlocking the bootloader to install a non-Asus firmware voids your warranty, which is annoying, but was presented clearly.After unlocking, I thought I'd try the warranty service nevertheless to get the terrible display replaced.  I figured the worst that could happen is that I'd lose the shipping cost.  Unfortunately for me, Asus did the warranty service despite the voided warranty.  When they returned the device, I found the bootloader relocked, and the power button had been damaged in such a way that the tablet would no longer function.  Now that they've damaged the device, they are refusing to do any further service because the unlocked / relocked bootloader.Asus has given me excuse after excuse as to why they won't service the device.  For instance, why is this not covered under the 90-day repairs warranty?  \"Because that repair was on the DISPLAY and the power button we broke is not part of the display.\"  Seriously, that is what they told me.I have purchased lots of Asus stuff over the years and liked them pretty well.

I bought it through amazon through a third party , refurbished ,sealed with a 90 day manufacturer's warranty.

Well, I opened the box and the the tablet was in near perfect condition to the naked eye on the physical aspect. Charged it till the light turned green and turned it on. After it loaded up and I looked at the display I noticed a blueish , teal colored line that ran vertically down the left side of the display. No matter which way I held the tablet , landscape or portrait, this blue line seemed permanent. I was very unhappy because it came in perfect condition except for the display problem. I have had to send it off to ASUS for RMA in Texas to fix this and my experience with them so far has not been a good one to say the least. To make a long story short , I took a shot and purchased it and became one of the unlucky ones. If it came with nothing wrong with it , the Prime is an awesome , fast ,tablet, with an excellent display.  I gave 5 stars because if it wasn't flawed, it would be mint.I love and miss my Prime, yep that's right , still haven't gotten it back yet and its been like over two weeks in there posession over at ASUS.

Hiltbrand", "ReviewID": "R17NRXJQDFR4SI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet a year ago in April. it is a wonderful tablet with more than enough computing power to get the job done. So, let's get to it -Packaging - The Asus Transformer Prime comes in a typical box. It is nicely packaged with instruction manuals, cleaning cloth, and power adapter / cable. The package is sturdily built, which helps with shipping.Transformer Prime Features - The TF201 features a Tegra 3 quad core processor. This processor allows you to use the latest apps, and multitask between them, with ease. It features a super IPS+ screen. This screen reproduces images with clarity and detail. However, I have found that it does not do very well in sunlight. It features an 8 megapixel camera, which is great for a tablet. The pictures produced are clear, and the camera app features a lot of great customizable settings. The tablet is equipped with a mini HDMI connector, so you can view the contents of the tablet on the big screen. The TF201 has a dock connector that offers many expandability options. There is a keyboard dock, which allows the tablet to become essentially a netbook (as it adds a keyboard, extended battery, and USB support). I currently use a USB adaptor (which allows me to connect thumb drives, a mouse, an external hard drive, etc.) and a GPS dongle to get a GPS signal (See Below).TF201 Issues - The TF201 has a great, all aluminum case. The problem with that is the Wireless radios (Wi-fi, Bluetooth, and GPS) are adversely affected, since they can't get a very good signal. The wireless problems can get annoying, since you have to be right by a router to get any sort of consistent signal. The Bluetooth doesn't seem to be affected that much. The GPS is rendered totally inoperable as a result of the case. Asus offered a connector to alleviate the GPS issues. It is a bar that connects to the versatile dock connector. However, this has only slightly improved the quality of GPS signals. At least I'm able to get a signal now.This tablet is a great tablet, packed with tons of features. It suffers from a design flaw however that really hurts its capabilities. If I were to do it again, I would have waited a couple months and purchased the TF700.

It overheated and would no longer charge.  While it was with Asus, they discovered that it also had a Touch Screen Function Error.  Both parts were replaced.  The next return was for lack of HDMI output among other things. Parts were replaced for an I/O Error, Touch Mis-action (same part as the first time), and finally ECN, ECR, ARN rework.  Even after getting it back the second time, it still was a little wonky, but at least the HDMI output worked.  The next step in the saga is the update to Jellybean.  Yes! Finally, all the bugs were gone. I had a fully functioning tablet for the first time.  That lasted less than three weeks.As of this morning, the tablet will no longer accept a charge directly from the charge adapter or from the keyboard dock.

B&H; could not provide a reliable shipping date or even explain if they shipped on the basis of who placed orders first. Thus I indicated my travel destination as the shipping address thinking there was no way the product would take that long to ship. Wrong again. Weeks later, when it was clear that my vacation would end before I received the tablet, I asked B&H; to change the shipping address to my home. B&H; explained they could do that but that would place me at the end of the line, which was apparently established after my initial call. I had previously had good experience with B&H;, but it was very disappointing to hear this. Considering the experience and the still unused Amazon gift certificate, it was easy for me to cancel the order through B&H; to order through Amazon instead. I have never had a problem with Amazon and they just happened to have started taking orders again. I placed the order in late December and it arrived on about the 14th of January nicely boxed to prevent damage during transit.I unpacked, quickly went through the abbreviated user guide, charged the unit as directed, and the following day attempted to run the setup to link to my wireless home network. Based on news accounts and Transformer Forums I was concerned about problems with both GPS and wireless connectivity. I hoped my experience would be uneventful, but it was not to be. When the setup attempted to log into my Gmail account, it was apparent to me that I probably had hours of troubleshooting ahead of me. I had some hope, however, that since the Transformer Prime was connecting to the home network but failing at the point of internet access, that my problem would be easier to diagnose and fix. I did a fair number of fruitless Google searches before I resorted to ASUS customer support. ASUS had me reboot my router (which I had just updated the firmware for) and then walked me through the process of resetting the Android software. Still no luck. Customer support told me I had two options at that point: one, send them the Transformer Prime for repair since they concluded it was faulty or, two, return it to Amazon for an exchange or refund. These options were provided to me after no more than 5 minutes of conversation and I was surprised that ASUS was not suggesting other options. I reminded the representative that I was able to establish a wireless network connection and that the issue was simply internet access. He was insistent that the problem was the tablet and I didn't argue. Nonetheless I was determined to try other options before returning the tablet.I started by driving to a nearby mall, figuring that if I could connect to the internet there I would have some assurance that the tablet was not the problem. Within seconds of my turning on the tablet, I did indeed establish the internet connection while sitting in my car about 30 feet from the nearest building. I completed the setup, went to the settings menu, saw that there was an update available, and proceeded to download and install what turned out to be Android 4.0_. I then drove home monitoring the access points and signal strength along the way. I was very surprised by the number of unsecured access points in residential areas. I hope that people are taking precautions in safeguarding their privacy and data.When I got home I called my internet service provider to make sure that there were no service interruptions. I was assured there were none. I then powered on the tablet hopeful that the operating system update solved my problems. It did not. At that point I knew the problem was my router. Since I purchased my D-Link 655 from Costco at a time they had a promotion that provided free lifetime technical support, I wasted no time in getting them on the phone. Within 30 minutes of trial and error testing, we traced the problem to an IP address for the router that limited functionality. We changed that and immediately had the Transformer Prime on the internet.One thing I am extremely thankful for is the free router technical assistance. I have an extremely complicated home network with multiple routers, switches, and extenders for both wired and wireless connectivity. We also have multiple media servers and at any one time can have more than 10 devices competing for wired and wireless bandwidth. My technical knowledge is limited and as much as I enjoy tweaking, a prime consideration for me in any future router purchase will be the availability of free technical support for those times that I can't troubleshoot a problem.As to the Transformer Prime, now that I've put it through hours of use, I'm impressed. I have not taken it on a trip yet, but I can happily trip through my home and yard while surfing without problems. The available aps are numerous, performance far exceeds that of a netbook, the screen is gorgeous, and while I have experienced occasional browser crashes, they are thus far tolerable and I hope fixed in future software releases.This is what the Netbook should have been.I recommend a Griffin stylus and a stand to go with the mini HDMI cable in your accessory kit. I am still waiting for the leather jacket that I will protect the tablet in. If that allows me easy tablet access, this product is a winner since it seems I can use this product all day without a charge.", "Title": "The Wait Was Worth It", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Author": "Leining Lu \"Leining\"", "ReviewID": "R325RR62XH4XJJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Different people use a tablet for different purposes. Therefore they form different opinions about the tablet. Please note that if you don't use ASUS Transformer Prime to watch high resolution HD movies but just for other usages, this review should not affect your purchase decision.I have waited for a long time to buy an ASUS Prime (TF201). I have done extensive market research. To my dismay, it was out of stock with Amazon in the first two weeks of 2012, though there were quite a few from third parties with much higher prices. During those weeks, I kept logging on Amazon several times in a day just to check if there would be any ASUS Transformer Prime available. On 1/20/2012, to my pleasant surprise, suddenly a handful of ASUS Prime units became available from Amazon. I was so excited that I quickly snatched the opportunity to order one for myself. I had very high hope with the ASUS Prime based on so many positive reviews that I've read. I am sure it has many great features and most of them are the best in the industry. But I also had a little concern about one thing, the color of the HD video that the Prime plays. I use a tablet mostly to watch HD movies with resolution of 720P (1280x720). Most reviews seem to be focused on its superior build quality, being thin and light, high processing speed, and screen brightness etc, but very little mentioning of the quality of color. Only one review from CNET website has brief mentioning that the reviewer said that he was more impressed by Samsung Galaxy's image color compared to ASUS Prime. That information concerned me. But I still ordered it from Amazon just to give it try. After I received it on 1/23 and tested it, my concern about the Prime's video color proved to be true. I use an app called MX Video Player downloaded from Android Market to play 720P movies in formats of MKV, MP4 and AVI on the Android tablet. Before I bought ASUS Transformer Prime, I had bought two tablets, Ipad2 and Samsung Galaxy 7.7. IPad2 is a great tablet, except that Ipad2 has weaknesses with its screen resolution and the video color. That's why I bought the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 later on to make up for it. Samsung Galaxy 7.7 is still not available in the US market yet. I ordered from a retailer in Singapore. The image quality and screen color of the HD movies of the Galaxy 7.7 are absolutely stunning. I haven't seen any tablet better than Galaxy 7.7 in terms of that.The screen of the ASUS Prime is very bright, as many reviewers have said. However, the color of the 720P video being played on ASUS Transformer Prime is very pale. The ASUS Prime seems to have diminished large amount of colors, most noticeably the redness. The colors of wallpaper and photos from the internet browser have no such problem. They look very good. I noticed the lack of colors only when watching 720P HD movies or TV shows. I was disappointed and I returned it to Amazon the next day. I would wait for the Samsung Galaxy 11.6 coming out later in this year. When it comes to the color richness, Samsung products (TV and tablet) seem second to none. I heard Samsung makes screens for many other brands including Ipad. Perhaps they have held some technology related to the screen color to themselves and use it exclusively to their Samsung Galaxy tablet.", "Title": "A Deal Breaker for me", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Author": "J.

These updates and rom were stock and came from asus. So the option was there, but no dice. I called Asus and set up to have it fixed (reinstall) but the worker who dealt with a very angry customer did not give me a quote. I called back to get a quote and I asked what the repair ticket said was the issue, He replied \"customer broke the bootloader when they unlocked it\". This was false, the tablet worked after the bootloader was unlocked.

I own a Dell streak, rooted Nook color, Motorola droid pro and Motorola Xprt.

Base line of 32 gigs will suffice for even hard core app users. For people that like to store movies on it you can get a 32 gig micro sd card which i did and store them on there. Also with the dock (which should almost just be a requirement its that good)you can add up to a 128gb sd card which i got a class 10 32 gig one on sale for $22. That's 96 gigs of storage not even counting the flash drives and external drives you could use with the usb port.Last and my favorite is gaming. Games are smooth and look great and for more fun get a blue-tooth controller (in my case ps3 controller) and get a cheap micro hdmi to hdmi cable and play games on your tv.

I didn't think the WIFI would be that important nor did I think its less than favorable reviews would be an issue. I was wrong on both counts.  Everyone has covered the tablet and it does work rather well however, the WIFI is probably worse than described.First off, in some cases you could be sitting ON the router and it still wouldn't work, ASUS has essentially no fix for it - they have tried this that and the other to pretty much no avail and those that own these are just plain stuck.  However, what makes this even worse is that if there is a weak WIFI sginal that the 201 can't stay connected to (oh it will find it and try - forever it will try) and you want to hook up to your phone WIFI that won't happen either because it keeps looking back and forth and won't attch to either..... I have had this happen REPEATEDLY and makes the tablet USELESS for our business application.We needed another tablet for an additional application and went with the 101 which actually works and has a WIFI that actually works - go figure.  It configures quicker and in my case transmits data faster.  Also found it at a pretty good price. I happen to like the thicker 101 - it fits my hand better and the silver edge around it I think looks better. If we had to buy a third tablet it would definetely be a 101 over the 201 however, now it would be a SAMSUNG!LarryUpdate 4/25/12Well ASUS has forced the update on everyone and it did not go well.

Many circumstances after owning for a week  lead me to return my Asus Prime Transformer.  First of all, I am an Expert in using the Android OS.  This tablet out of the box was an error.  I tried to register the tablet and the serial number was not recognized by the manufacturer's website.  I called Asus and they manually registered the tablet for me.  I purchased the Ipad 2 for my daughter and registration was an ease and a registration link was part of turning on the Apple Ipad 2 for the first time.  This not the case for my Asus, I had to look for product registration.  Secondly, half of the apps I use on OS Gingerbread were not available on my tablet.  Either they were not Tegra 3 qualified or ICS qualified, but the apps were not available in Google Play (formerly Android Market).  To be exact...USPS and UPS apps are not available on tablets running ICS.  I use these two apps extensively and my tablet was crippled without these two apps.  Of course, I could have gone to the internet on my tablet, but this was a downside for me.  This defeats the purpose of a $500 tablet.  This is fragmentation.  Manufacturers are building t tablets in record numbers and specs to include quad core.  But the majority of the apps that run Gingerbread are not available for tablets running ICS.  I don't know the reason why but I relate to either ICS or quad core functionality.  The problem I see is that manufactures are building tablets to enormous specs without an OS to run on. Develops are not producing apps that only 1% have the OS to run on, meaning ICS.  Developers are not producing apps with quad core capability..This is the fragmentation that is wreaking havoc across Android .  GPS, all but non existence on the Prime.  Although the user manual says there is an icon for turning on the GPS, no such feature is available on the tablet.  The feature was removed.  Wi-Fi--so-so.  Not as good as I would like to see for a tablet costing $500.00 plus dollars.  After comparing the two, meaning my daughters Ipad2 and my Asus Prime Transformer, the new Ipad would be my choice--even though the Ipad2 lacks many features the Prime has...like Flash, HDMI out, sd card, to name a few.  But the IOS is not fragmented.  All the apps are available for download, no matters which Ipad you have and the apps look and have more functionality than the apps in Android.  For example, the USAA banking app is ten times better than the USAA app in Android.  I have to admit and having been an Android fan since the days of Cupcake and Donut, I have to admit that the Apple Ipad (new one) will be my choice of a tablet.  Maybe in a couple of years when developers start producing apps to run on ICS along with quad core processors may the Prime Transformers be a contender--It's just way before it's time launching on Android.", "Title": "Fragmentation across Android ruins this tablet", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Author": "Jerry Cuevas Jr.", "ReviewID": "R3OQKIWY9TIF99", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this item and waited several weeks for it to arrive from Amazon.

Wifi signal is pretty week. I used to have 20MBPS cable speed in my house. At that time, when I test close to my router I get 15MBPS and to my corner of my house, I get just 5 MBPS.

This is not an issue if you have high speed of internet like 20MBPS3. You cannot use Bluetooth and Wifi simultaneously. You cannot browse any thing and internet does not work with Blue tooth on. When you turn off your Bluetooth, your internet will work as usual. This indicates that you cannot use SKYPE or any VOIP app software from your Prime.

It was meant to redefine mobile computing in its entirety, but fell just short.This device's hardware are off the charts. With the specs given in November, it had my jaw dropped! I received the device nearly day 1.I've always been the biggest fan of Android (even an early adopter of ICS via cyanogenmod). Quite frankly, this device has me looking more towards a Windows 8 slate for my next tablet purchase.I use this device for work, school and leisure. When I first got the device, I was plagued by the dreaded WIFI bugs. If bluetooth and wifi are on simultaneously, they weaken each other significantly. Many other users have the same problem, and we continue to have it to this very day. Also, the WIFI antennas are surrounded by a metal body (poor design) which decreases WIFI reception entirely. My Samsung Galaxy S 2 gets around 100 more feet in reception on my campus (no joke), and around 30 more feet on a wireless home router. Also, the poor design decreases GPS reception completely (to the point where they actually took it off the device spec list - even though my receipt says GPS device).In terms of software, ASUS is improving it slowly. There were many bugs in Honeycomb, and even more in ICS. Very recently have they updated the device and removed a considerable amount of bugs, but there are still more, and they've even created new ones. Most bugs are bearable, but annoying.ASUS support is even worse. I would have attempted to RMA the device in hopes for a fix, but user reports are awful. Some have taken up to 2 months to get the device back. Some have even been returned devices with cracked screens. I've even seen circumstances where ASUS claims of customer induced damage (but the pictures of the damage are all in the exact same spot, with nearly identical damages). I use this device every day, so losing it for 2 months is not an option.For a NORMAL user, as in, slightly techy, I would say you could get the device and be happy with it. But, you could get a much cheaper device for the same average quality.  For an ADVANCED user, I would advise to not get this device and wait. More and more TEGRA 3 devices will be released over the upcoming quarter.In my personal opinion: the device was great at first! It was exactly what I needed. Once I became somewhat dependent on it, is when the bugs (hardware and software) really started to take their toll on me, and by then, there was no going back. I do love the device and it is very much usable, but it can be extremely frustrating to know your device works decently at optimal circumstances, and poor in any other.

I am currently typing on an Asus brand laptop. I was thrilled to be able to own a cutting edge tablet from such a trusted and reliable company. With that out of the way, on to the review of this product:This was supposed to be my and my sons Xmas gift last year, but the pre-order was not filled until a few weeks later in January, so the first experience I had with this product was an annoying wait. After receiving the item and getting used to the interface and doing all the updates I became very concerned about the poor WiFi reception only a room away from my router, and barely usable at the other end of the house in my living room. This not being a problem for any of my gaming consoles/PC's. On top of this there were tons of basic stability issues, especially with the browser. I had not responding messages come up every time I scrolled pages and randomly with most any functions and frequently had to force close. The Play Store is also fairly unusable on the system.I originally thought these were just early issues and they would improve... and they did, somewhat. The not responding issues have gotten better, but are still fairly frequent. I have since gotten an android phone (HTC One VX) and it is so much faster and more stable and fun to use I can't believe what I was missing out on. I pretty much just used the Prime for my son who is 3 and autistic as a therapy and learning device now. Well, up until last week, but I'll get to that.Other problems with the system include 5+ minute boots from the moment I first received the thing, way longer than my PC's take to boot! Also, randomly, it refuses to start and I will think it has finally kicked it, only to have it power on again the next day. Then there is the proprietary charger and the software based charging that often fails to work. Basically I plug the device in and it won't charge. And then another day I try and it will. I think what needs to happen is the power needs to run out completely before the charger is able to work due to the charging software crashing? This is just a guess, but it's quite annoying to tell a young child with autism that the computer isn't working because it doesn't have enough power to boot and it won't charge.Then there are the crashes that cause me to have to restart entirely, usually related to icons refusing to load and the OS basically being frozen. This again has never happened on my phone. On the Prime it could sometimes happen multiple times in one evening. After holding in the power button multiple times it would eventually reset, usually to power back on after a few more power button presses... then load for maybe 8 minutes and then turn right back off. At this point the system would then proceed to get super hot, so hot it would burn your hand to touch it. When attempting to turn it back on in this state, it would just start booting again. This happened often. I was very worried the components were being fried, but I didn't know what to do to keep it from getting hotter and hotter as it happened when the system was off! It never got hot like this when it was on.So after a year of just dealing with my 500 dollar gift barely functioning (was unable to play tons of commercial apps I tried due to games freezing and rapidly flashing after playing for a few minutes) and never once dropping or abusing the system (not a slight scratch or mark anywhere on the thing), the screen broke. While against the side of my couch sitting next to me while I used my DS. My son was in bed and I had just used it to check my email. I wanted to try to play a quick round of scramble before bed and picked it up to use it and saw what looked like something white on the screen. Having a not so smart moment I touched it to see what it was. I still have a piece of glass lodged in my thumb. I am completely unable to determine how the screen could have possibly broken while sitting on the couch next to me. I wasn't touching it. I wonder if the system getting so hot sometimes caused a weakness in the glass? I really have no clue, but we can't afford another right now and my son who is very set in routines and who loves the thing has been miserable all weak. I am afraid to just tape it and let him play with it as the cracking could become worse. It's a very odd pattern, like it got crushed in one area, as if someone had taken say a screwdriver and just drove it down to the corner of the screen.So anyway, long story short, this item has been a giant string of problems and disappointments and now I have to find it in the budget to find another tablet for my son so that he can continue to benefit from what the technology offers him. I can honestly say I will never buy another Asus product again, 500 dollars is a lot for a single income family, I am not currently able to work as I take care of my son and we have tons of therapies to pay for each week and drive him to. Really did not need this problem on top of everything, but that's life. One unhappy customer may not mean a lot to Asus, but a product like this with so many negative reviews is sure to make others think twice before buying from then.We had actually been considering a Nexus 7 for my sons birthday, but I'll be looking at another brand now, especially as that tablet was also full of early problems. Don't release products before they are ready Asus, it really has affected your reputation.Edit: Just remembered 2 other problems. The camera is broken, not sure how long as I really didn't use it, but a few months ago when I went to use it it was just a green screen and hasn't worked since. Also since summer, the screen won't rotate into portrait mode anymore on the desktop and a few other times when it should, but will rotate fine in games that support rotation and accelerometer games play fine. No idea.Another Edit: The tablet no longer charges properly at all, it will only \"trickle charge\". Basically it takes about 24 hours to charge the thing up and an hour or two to use up the charge. It's become my sons tablet as I can no longer be bothered with it and the battery issue at least serves to keep him from using it too much.", "Title": "Nothing but problems for a year and now broken", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Author": "Robert Fischer \"borode\"", "ReviewID": "R1RUOKOXJJDFP4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have gone through two tablets now in the span of 2 months; loved the tablets until the screens cracked; is made of cheap glass (actually is dangerous since it can cut your fingers); isn't covered by their \"best warranty\" in the business, which is actually a big crock.

So I have had nearly a month to mess around with it. But it is still not quite there yet. So I have decided to sell it. I'll explain why.1. Price - I am not saying that the hardware for the TF 201 is not worth the asking price, the build quality is really nice. But for $499 you should expect to get more performance. Compared to all of the other tablets on the market with Tegra 2 chips, the Prime is no comparison with its Tegra 3 processor, it makes everything faster and snappier. But for $499 ($650 if you add the keyboard dock) you can get a pretty awesome, and powerful laptop. The screen is excellent and is very bright, though some of the colors do seem kind of odd, but that is a matter of opinion. The Prime also takes really good pictures for a tablet, good 1080p video too.2. Web Browsing - I have upgraded to Android 4.0 (ICS) and I am still not happy with the tablet. I am not sure if it is the Android OS or the hardware but I just want more from this device. I want super fast web browsing, that's not buggy. But the Prime just cannot deliver in this area. Too often have I experienced numerous issues while browsing on the Prime, browser crashes/freezes, not loading properly, slow, etc. Considering web browsing is mainly what I use the Prime for, this is a major issue, ultimately the issue that made me sell the tablet.3. Gaming - This is kind of an android complaint in general. I love high quality gaming, but Android gaming is different, in some ways good, in some ways bad. Android has tons and tons of free and cheap games, some are fun, some are just dreadful. But some games are just not made for touch screens. Such as FPS games or games that require many different controls. Also, the quality of Android games is definitely on the rise, but is still no where near PS3, Xbox 360 or PC gaming. The complexity, story, graphics, sound, online play are all way behind that of consoles and PC. I think this will probably catch up in a few years but it is miles behind what is considered awesome today. Developers just don't spend the same amount of time and resources on an Android game as they do a PC or console game. The biggest selling point of Android tablets is its extreme portability and lower power usage (battery life) and developer support. I think they set out to reproduce and laptop like experience in a much smaller and slimmer form factor, but the truth is, they just cannot do it yet. Android gaming is super cheap, yes. But I prefer quality over quantity. You can buy a $2 game for your tablet that may give you 10 hours of entertainment. Or you could just buy a $5-50 well polished PC game on your laptop, that not only looks amazing and can do multi-player, but it will provide you with endless hours of entertainment. Like I said before, Android gaming just cannot produce the same type of quality content, period. I am going to give this area a few years to mature, I have high hopes for the future, but its just not there yet.4. Productivity - Without the dock, productivity on the Prime is more like a novelty, no one really buys it for this purpose. You can do actual work on the device, but it is sometimes very painful and slow. Sure there are all types of Word editors, PDF viewers, PPT viewers, etc. But compared to their Windows 7 cousin, they just cant come close. In any possible way. There is currently no substitute for a real keyboard, it is required to be productive. It takes about 4-5 times as long to type an email on a tablet when compared to a laptop or netbook. The virtual keyboard is a pain to use, it is hard to type without messing up often. The keyboard dock would have to be a must if you plan on being productive with this tablet.If you don't care about any of the issues I have mentioned in this review, then by all means, the Prime may just be great for you. But for someone who demands great performance and value, and alot of bang for your buck, you might want to stick with a laptop.The TF-201 is a big step forward for the tablet market in general, its processor makes it a much more capable device than its predecessors. But it's an expensive novelty that has no real function in my life, nor does it really excel at doing one particular thing in general. So my advise is, let it mature, it will be great in a few years, but its not quite there yet.", "Title": "Lets face it, Android tablets still need work", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Author": "rdkmco \"rdkmco\"", "ReviewID": "R15WBKX252NJPF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was real excited about receiving my Prime and did a lot of research before I purchased from this web site.  My wife has an Ipad2 and I have an IPod touch, so I was really leaning toward the Ipad2, but did buy the Prime, even after reading some (many) of the negative reviews.  For the Android OS market, the Prime is probably the best on the market.  That being said, I can now also concur that there are issues with the device.  It is true the GPS was nonexistent.  I knew this BEFORE I purchased, but did not care at all because I was not intending to use the Prime as a GPS.  SO if GPS is REAL important to you, do not buy the Prime.  I also concur that the sound/speaker was inadequate.  I am amazed really that ASUS did not create TWO speakers with stereo sound.  The single speaker does not do justice to the unit.  In fact, it is quite low on every application - Movies were ok and so was music, but CHAT via SKYPE or YAHOO was excruciatingly low.  The earphone jack was fine and adequately loud.  The issues with Wi-Fi do exist somewhat, although I did connect every time all around my house.  As compared to my phone and laptop, the Prime did have trouble obtaining as strong signal.  Compared to the other Android tablets (Honeycomb or ICS), the Prime would be a top contender.  However the few mechanical issues reduce the overall rating.  Now to the software.  Ice Cream Sandwich is a nice system and I did enjoy the interface.  In deciding to rate the Prime, I am comparing directly to my wife's Ipad2 and am comparing similar programs.  Overall, I think there are better Apps from the iTunes Store rather than the Android market.  For my HTC Android phone, I have found the Android market Apps to be great actually, but for the Prime, not so much.  The ITunes Apps are much crisper and I feel higher quality as compared to the same ones on Android. In comparing my HTC phone to my iPod touch, I would also say there seems to more quality control over Apps from ITunes versus the Android Market. One of the BIG issues I had was that  I could NOT send email from my exchange account on my Prime and after searching the forums and online, this seems to be an issue as well.  This was most definitely a deal breaker for me.  (It was the second one - more on that later).  The same MPEG-4's I played on the Ipad2 were better than when played on the Prime.  Pictures also displayed better on the Ipad2 than the Prime.  I did not use the flash camera but the front facing web cam I am told by several people was low quality and grainy- (via Yahoo and SKYPE).But the real issue I had with the unit and the reason I sent back for refund, was that on several occasions the Prime would not charge.  The proprietary connection is flimsy at best and the actual connector and cable feel low quality.  The connector does not really slide in very far to the Prime and due to the design of the Prime case, the connector sort of \"hangs\" with not much support.  There is NO comparison to the way the Ipad2 and for that matter ALL the Apple products, charging cables connect. I cannot trust a device that only after a few days of use, indicated charging troubles.In summary I wanted to really like the Prime as it was about $150.00 less than the comparable Ipad2 32 GB.  If you have the money, I recommend the Ipad2.  If you don't, the Prime probably will do for you.  I just do not think the quality control is really there for the Prime and I have read several European sellers have ceased to carry the Prime until these issues are addressed.  In fact, ASUS announced a new tablet soon after the Prime was released late last year. One last but nonetheless important fact, is that there is an abundance of Ipad2 accessories out there.  In fact, virtually every store and website sell some form of Apple accessory.  Conversely, the Prime uses a proprietary charging and USB system/plug and accessories are virtually impossible to find and when you do find them, are expensive.  The new Ipad3 is rumored to be out in early March and I am going to wait to see what the offerings are and either buy the Ipad2 if the prices are dropped or the new Ipad3.****update: I have now purchased an iPad 2 and even more strongly believe the Asus Prime is an inferior unit. Many people leave reviews based on no experience with another competing product.  I am sure there are people who love the prime who have never tried or owned an iPad . Many people talk about the kool-aid Apple likes to give, but I fell for the Android kool-aid. If you are able to buy an iPad 2 32 or 64 gb before they are gone, you wold do much better than buying the Prime. Each tablet has some differences, but overall I have fund the iPad far superior when it comes to build quality, OS, ease of use and much better App quality.  The iPad feels and operates much more solidly. Additionally there are significantly more iPad accessories than the prime, or any android tablet.", "Title": "Prime versus Ipad2, Guess who wins?", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Author": "Tuan-Khanh Tran", "ReviewID": "R2IVJ23L49P6WF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I pre-ordered mine from Amazon and was very excited to get it two days ago (2 weeks earlier than promised).

Oops....I ordered Amethyst Gray 32GB tablet, first ordered Nov. 22, but Amazon cancelled, then reordered December 19.---------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT January 9, one hour later than original review.  Just downloaded Android 4.0.3, Ice Cream Sandwich.  Speedtest seems faster, but still not up to other tablet and older Samsung notebook. But there is a whole section for DEVELOPER OPTIONS now!!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are so many good things about the Asus Prime tablet, but the weak wifi makes it almost less than satisfactory.Here are some of the good things I noticed today after 7:55am delivery.1.  Looks - It looks beautiful, it's light, thin, and very attractive.2.  Screen is very bright, even at half brightness.3.  It seems fast, EXCEPT for the soon to be mentioned wifi problem.4.  The included Glowball game has amazing graphics.5.  Setup went amazingly well, and it updated firmware after asking.Now onto the wifi problem.  Much of the computing in our home is in our family room, about 20-25 feet from our wireless ATT Uverse router.  Every other device (older notebook, HTC Flyer) gets 10 Mbps or so at Speedtest.net in the family room .  Not the ASUS Prime, at this distance the ASUS Prime get about 10% of that speed, or about 1 Mbps.  Move closer to the wireless, and the speed is fine at about 6 feet.  12 feet away and the speed degrades a lot.  This is just totally unacceptable, there is a consistent problem with the Prime unless it is not almost next to the wireless.EDIT January 10:  Or put another way.  Samsung notebook gets 4/5 bars in family room.  HTC Flyer tablet gets 3/4 bars right now.  Asus Prime gets 1/4 bars or 2/4 bars in same place.  But the main thing is, unless Asus Prime is VERY near the router, the download speed is degraded.  (Maybe some of the experts can address this, but the upload speeds are all good, on all devices, even the ASUS Prime at all distances, all devices have upload speeds about 1.5 Mbps.)Called ASUS support (in Jamaica!), they are aware of this wifi problem (as well as the GPS problem).  No solution at this time, but please keep checking usa.asus.com SUPPORT for further information.And then today, ASUS announces a new Prime virtually the same.  Same dimensions, but better screen, one new camera, and fixes for the GPS and wifi problems.BUT WHAT WILL ASUS DO FOR US, TO FIX OUR NON-FUNCTIONING PRIMES?  ASUS, could you please fix ours, before you come out with a new model?  Please....I was wondering if I installed a WIFI ACCESS POINT in our family room to add to the existing ATT Uverse wifi router, would that solve this problem for me, at least at home?

But the tablet is simply not ready for prime time.  For example, I discovered that you cannot listen to major BBC stations and programs with the Transformer.  (I own a much cheaper Archos tablet and have no problems doing so with that tablet).  If you try to download a BBC station, you get a message saying \"this device is not supported by the BBC I player.\"  For ASUS to roll out a product without making sure that the most prolific news organization in the world is available in mobile format is astonishing.  The instruction manual (only available online) is also woefully inadequate especially for consumers for whom this is the first tablet.  ASUS deserves credit for launching the world's first quadcore tablet and it has many fine features.  But there have been numerous problems with the rollout of this device in addition to the one I just detailed.  ASUS should have waited till all these issues were resolved before launching the device especially considering its price tag of $499 minimum.Also, a major annoyance is that the Prime's screen falls short of being 16:9.

There were a lot of professional reviewers writing glowing reviews about the Prime. I couldn't wait to get it! Bottom line, it's a beautifully engineered disaster. Seems companies like Asus are hell bent on copying or bettering the iPad. Problem is Asus threw out all engineering principles in the process.An all-metal back simply blocks radios signals---GPS, Wifi and Bluetooth radios. This physical attribute CANNOT be addressed by software updates, which is why Asus is removing GPS----how long before they remove the other radios? Watch for a 3G version of this tablet to be released with a PLASTIC back instead of METAL.Pros:+ Nice, bright screen+ Good battery life+ Awesome keyboard dock (feels like a Macbook Air)+ Only one dead pixel. No light bleed.+ Awesome game performance from Shadow Gun (very fun to play with my PS3 controller attached).Cons:- GPS does not work (Asus confirmed). So much for using Google Maps or Navigation while traveling.- Wifi is weak (up to 10x weaker than my Xoom. Measured using wifi analyzer app.)- Bluetooth works, but cannot be used with Wifi (ie, can't stream Pandora to a bluetooth speaker.- Haptic feedback is faulty.- Software is sluggish (Honeycomb is a real dog). Maybe ICS will help.- Ergonomic it's not. Corners are sharp, almost weapon-like. Don't want to throw this than around!- Bad placement of micro SD card slot. The card will easily pop out by accident...and you wouldn't notice.- Fragile connections (audio jack, AC jack, HDMI jack) due to the thin, beveled design.Bottom line, it's getting returned. Even with Ice Cream Sandwich, this tablet will never overcome its current flawed design. I'll wait for one of the hundred other Tegra 3 tablets coming out this year. I'm begging for an ERGONOMIC tablet instead of shiny metal. It's like tablets are shiny keys for us babies to play with. I wish companies would value function over form. Thanks Apple. Thanks for inspiring all these clone failures. (Sarcasm)If I didn't prefer Android so much, I'd get an ipad 3. Apparently, it's a big deal.

I could not wait to get it.Now that I had it. This Tablet has dropped all the way down to 1 star. Here are the reasons.1. GPS2. Laggy3. Bluetooth4. Poor Customer Service from ASUS5. Keboard6. Bootloader Locked (for the techs)GPS=================This is my response from me emailing them about the poor gps signalsDear Valued Customer,Thank you for contacting ASUS Customer Service.The ASUS Transformer Prime is made from a metallic unibody design, so the material may affect the performance of the GPS when receiving signals from satellites.Please note that this product is not a professional GPS device and signal performance can be easily influenced by factors including, but not limited to: weather, buildings and your surrounding environment.Please understand there are some limitations when using the GPS function.Some scenarios you may encounter when experiencing weak GPS performance:1. Using the GPS while traveling in a car: The roof of a car, the insulation, bridges and other factors can affect signal reception.2. High density areas with large buildings and structures that can block line of sight communication with GPS satellites.Since this email ASUS took GPS off the US site.  I am not sure how a product gets released with all the issues I have had with this device.  This is not just mine.  This is all the tablets even the one you are about to buy here  on amazon.Here is a hundred plus page thread about how the GPS does not work[...]=================Laggy=================When you first boot this device it runs pretty smooth... Not lighting fast but acceptable.  After about 20 minutes of playing around going to the web opening a couple tabs.  Downloading an app or two from the market.  The tablet starts acting like a 10 year old pc with malware on it.  You pretty much have to reboot the device to get the speed back.  Actions tend to get stuck and you keep clicking thinking you missed the button/link.  Then a few moments (could be 20 seconds) the actions start popping.  That was when I went to bookmarks and tried clicking on amazon's link.  tapped 3-5 times and nothing.  I gave up and went to the address bar and typed in am... then the bookmark worked.  Amazon loaded then I would start navigating and every time I clicked a link it pulled my click from the bookmarks and I had to reboot to get out of the link loop.=================Bluetooth=================I have not been able to connect anything to this via Bluetooth yet :(Tried IPhone and Car stereo.  Not sure what the problem is here.=================Poor Customer Service from ASUS=================Tried calling about the GPS and they played dumb.  This was after multiple post on XDA and other Android Blogs.  They gave in and gave me an RMA.=================Keyboard Dock=================I thought this was cool but this is supper laggy and I have not gotten one letter or number key to work yet.  Only keys that work are the ones on the top row. Enable Wifi... Bluetooth...=================Bootloader Locked (for the techs)=================I want complete customization.  This blocks that.
