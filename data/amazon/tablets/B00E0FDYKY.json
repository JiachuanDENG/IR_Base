The first failed within the first week and Amazon replaced the device.  The second device worked fine for about a week but I stopped using it and the battery ran dead. I tried every trick possible to get it to charge.  I searched online forums for similar problems.  I plugged the tablet into the USB hub on my computer, I used multiple wall chargers all for a minimum of 12 hours.  The device is completely dead.  Since I'm out of the 30 day return window with Amazon I now have to go through Asus support.  No telling how long that will take to get my device back.There are obviously people that are happy with this device so if you still want to buy it I suggest putting it through the ringer and use it hard the first 25 days you have it so if it fails you can return it to Amazon.", "Title": "Not worth the risk", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Author": "Bradford Schmidt", "ReviewID": "R192ROV48GQYID", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Frankly, I'm still blown away that you can purchase a 7\" HD tablet for a hundred and fifty bucks. You'd think that'd mean it would skimp on features and quality, but the MeMO Pad 7 certainly does not.Setup is quick and easy; turn it on, go through the usual input of your Google account, update the software and you're up and running. The MeMO Pad runs a skinned version of Android, but it's not as bad as some of the skinned versions I've run into. However, if you're looking for pure Android, you won't find it here. On the upside, some of the Asus apps (for sound and color registration, for example) are actually useful, so that's nice.Construction is fine. It's lighter than many tablets, which some may say feels cheap, but I like the weight reduction. Fit and finish is just great, buttons push well and feel solid, and it feels good in my hand.I'm not in love with the surface of the screen though. It's a fingerprint magnet, is actually flexible, and feels like plastic, not glass. When I clean it, I flexes noticeably in the center, making contact with the panel beneath and sticking there for a moment. Other issues with the screen: it's not nearly as slippery as the surface on other tablets or any of my phones, and the touch isn't quite as responsive as some, occasionally requiring more than one touch to register.The display, though, is lovely. Great color and angle of viewing, as well as excellent brightness. On the downside, there's no way to set it to auto-brightness, which is a drag for me - I don't like having to change it depending on viewing conditions. On the other hand, my Kindle HD 8.9 has an auto-brightness feature that simply doesn't work, so there's that.Speed is excellent on most apps, though I was lagging like crazy using the NY Times app this morning - that may be an app issue, I don't know. YouTube works great though, and video in general looks quite nice. Social apps and mail work a treat, as does outlook.com.The built in web browser is excellent with one issue (I'll get to that in a minute). It's fast and works on just about every site I've hit, and it actually reflows (YAY!) text when you zoom in and out - something that WAY too few browsers do right. The problem with it is this: the FIRST time you run it, you'll notice it immediately logs you into your Google account. One assumes it is now tracking every click and cookie, and there does NOT appear to be a way to log it OUT of Google. And it's not obvious it's done that unless you notice it when you first run it. I'm not a big fan of that sort of behavior, sorry.WiFi reception has been very good but not phenomenal, in the upper middle pack of devices I've tested. However, the connections have been solid and the MeMO Pad has never dropped off of my router. WiFi is also extremely fast; large files send and receive quickly and I've never found myself tapping my foot in impatience.The built-in camera is a pleasant surprise: it takes really fine pictures and decent video. It includes a full compliment of features and the filters anyone that's ever used Instagram is familiar with. A nice plus: Asus provides a group of nice filters on the video side as well as the still camera side.A huge plus: it's expandable. Rather than trying to get you drop extra cash on a device with more built-in memory, you can use an SD card to expand memory. This is just such a standard feature I'm amazed that the market lets certain companies get away with excluding it.Here'e the thing I'm most impressed with: I have a Kindle HD 8.9, a 17\" laptop, a 15\" laptop, a desktop and a Samsung GS3 to choose from when I want to check mail, hit YouTube, bid on an Ebay item, research stuff, or shop online. And unless I'm sitting at my desk, this little 7\" tablet is the one thing I reach for more than any other; that's high praise indeed.It's fast and light, does exactly what I need, and the battery lasts a good long time. I'm not a fan of the screen surface, but the rest of the package is so good (and expandable) that it's still going to cop a 5-star rating from me. In my opinion, it's the best value in tablets on the market right now, and hits the sweet spot of power, size, battery life and weight.", "Title": "A Fantastic Value That Works Beautifully", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Author": "K.

This tablet was too good to be true, and I'm almost certain that ASUS knew this prior to launch.  The specs blow away anything at it's pricepoint and it provided approximately three months of great ownership.I bought this tablet to replace a 5+ year old laptop that was failing.  I had never owned a Tablet before, but had previous good experiences with ASUS products.  I was so excited about the MeMOPad for the first two months of ownership that I nearly convinced a few friends to buy one (I'm glad I didn't).I own a Samsung Galaxy S2 and the wife has a Galaxy S3, so I'm familiar with the Android platform.  I was thrilled with the speed of the processor, the quality of display, the battery life, etc.  I used the tablet primarily for browsing the internet (Amazon, Gmail, etc.), but it was also fairly capably of handling games (even those that are graphically intensive).I bought this Tablet in late November.  It functioned very well for the first two months, but began occasionally failing to power on.  The first time it failed to power on, I thought the battery had just died.  I plugged it up and attempted to power it back on, but it didn't give any indication that it was charging.  I thought it was strange, so I left it plugged up for a while.  The next time I attempted to power it on, it came right back on.  I thought nothing else about and everything seemed fine again.A month passes and the issue reoccurs a few times.  The second time it happened, I started thinking about what might have killed the battery (nothing came to mind).  I plugged it up to charge and it gave me the battery charging indication.  The third time, nothing seemed to help.  I couldn't get it to indicate that it was charging and it refused to power on.  I eventually opened up the casing (I had planned on removing/replacing the battery), but the battery doesn't remove (it's attached to the board).  I closed the case back up, and strangely enough, it powered back on.At this point, I started reading the 1-star reviews and it seems to be a VERY common issue with the MeMOPAd.  I have removed the case two more times successfully to power it back on (may be a problem with the actual power button), but it's still \"asleep\" from the most recent failure.  I'm not sure what causes this tablet to fail, but it's a legit problem.  ASUS may have discovered the issue too close to the holiday shopping season to retool/resolve this problem.  They probably believed that lowering the price point would be enough to move these defective units.  I'm sure that I could send mine back to ASUS and have them ship me a \"refurb\" unit that was returned by another sucker (owner).If you need a good throw-away Tablet that functions for about three months, this maybe exactly what you're looking for.  If you want your electronics to last more than a season, spend your money on something better.  As for me, this will be the last ASUS product that I purchase.

On the plus side, the ASUS warranty covers repairs, but you have to pay shipping. 2 out of 3 of these products have not worked, so I recommend shopping for a different brand to avoid the hassle.

No matter how many times I pressed the power button or plugged it into the charger, it DOES NOT turn on/wake up/show charging status/nothing! The only way to fix this was to leave it on the charger and to come back to it in a couple hours. This was very annoying because it could happen at anytime, even when it's charged or on the charger. This seems to be the case with other reviewers also, but I didn't think it would happen to mine.  -___-If that wasn't bad enough, about a week later the screen became unresponsive in TWO places.

She was previously using my Nexus 7 1st gen. Needless to say the tablets are so similar in size and construction, it was a flawless transition.The build quality of the Asus isn't up to par with the nexus 7 2012, simply because of the plastic backing that gets scratched very easily. With that said, comparing the screen quality of this tablet to that of the nexus is like night and day. Surprisingly the Asus just appears a lot more vibrant and sharper. Maybe its just my nexus, but I think the responsiveness is much better as well.This tablet isn't the fastest thing out there, as you would probably expect. But with one gig of memory and a 1.2ghz dual core processor it isn't too bad. It scores somewhere in the region of 13k on antutu, so youre looking at a galaxy S3 level of performance. Some apps to happen to slow it to a complete crawl sometimes however.Since the tablet is built on the mediatek architecture you're not going to get a lot of custom ROM support for it. I did however manage to find one that gives you some kit Kat goodies and some much needed stability improvements.We did experience the problem a lot of reviewers complained about: the tablet drains the battery and then will not turn back on. While I don't think you should have to go through this kind of thing with any product, this kind of thing happens, I guess. I contacted asus and opened up an RMA because it happened only 40 days after purchase, so amazon wouldn't let me send it back. But then I decided I'd try to fix it on my own.I popped the back cover off, removed the battery connector from the main board and shorted the terminals, kind of like a \"clear CMOS\" procedure on computers. Needless to say, I plugged it back in and connected the charger, and everything was good to go again! The problem hasn't happened since, and we've had it for about 3 months now.Overall if you're on a tight budget I would recommend this tablet without hesitation.

It's still nowhere near as good as my iPad (currently at 91% after 5 days without a charge) or the Samsung (96% after two days), but the MeMO was at 89% after standing by for 2 days, and that's much better than how it started out.This tablet is like a bad high school boyfriend: cute as all get out, lots of potential, but some of its behaviors are borderline unacceptable.I bought this a week ago. It's the second android tablet I have bought in a month; the first is a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0, and, for what I need in a 7 inch tablet, it is pretty darned good. I also have a 4th generation iPad (retina display) and a first gen iPad (so obsolete, but so reliable).Next to all of the other tablets I own, the Asus Memo Pad HD looked great on paper - the quad-core processor, the better display resolution than the galaxy, the way lower price, the fact that I could get it in green (okay, silly, I know, but cute!)But, check it out: battery life is abysmal. I don't just mean while you are doing things with it. Actually, it performed comparably with the 7 inch Galaxy on an hour long streaming video, going from 99% charged down to 92%, where the Galaxy went from 100% down to 94%. It's the standby time that is highly problematic. To see how the battery compares to my other tablets, I charged everything and then left all of the tablets on standby overnight and all the next day, doing nothing. At bedtime, the newer iPad was at 100% still, the Galaxy at 97%, the old iPad at 96%, and the MeMO pad was dead.Today after testing the battery on video playback, I left the Galaxy and MeMO sitting next to each other and came back to check later. Galaxy was down to 90%. MeMO was at 82%. I have it on the ultrasaver power setting. I just don't get why it would run down so fast.Next comparison - displays. My 4th Gen iPad is beautiful, and I thought I might be a little spoiled, but the MeMO's display is very clear. Video renders smoothly with excellent motion. Resolution is 1280 by 800 (compared to 1024 x 600 on the Galaxy). Totally doable. The Samsung seemed less smooth. However, the Samsung performs better on sound and touch. Dialogue is a bit muddy on the MeMO, and upper range is not quite bright. The touchscreen seems to have the slightest hint of lag, as does the accelerometer. Not terrible. But noticeable.The MeMO pad camera is a lot better than the Samsung - especially in low light - but nowhere near as good as the 4th Gen iPad (which also has led flash).In terms of form factor, the MeMO is a little bit bigger, but still fits in your hand. Not sure it would fit in a pocket like the Galaxy. Or that you would want to put it in one, since the MeMO is lighter and seems quite a bit less sturdy. It will fit in a very small man-bag or pocketbook.As for pre-loaded software, features, etc., the Galaxy comes with a nice voice assistant, but you can get a very similar app for free at the app store for the MeMO. Galaxy has better alarm sounds (I think), but both alarms are reliable and fairly customizable.So which little android tablet is better? Well, with the battery issue, I have to say the Galaxy is better. By quite a bit. The MeMO would be great for portable entertainment, if the battery lasted longer. Without good battery life, the thing just isn't that portable. And the lower price doesn't make up for it. Not in my opinion, anyway.OTOH, if you're looking for something that will be plugged in most of the time, like a bedside tablet/alarm/home automation controller, this will be great and it does save you some money over the Galaxy and a ton of money over any iPad.", "Title": "Weak Battery Life", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Author": "Comtap", "ReviewID": "RVSNSM9NNHSFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Worth every Penny,  I recently bought the Dragon Touch 7in tablet from amazon for my wife for a present and it was a total piece of garbage and sent it back and bought this instead. and the Asus Memopad HD is Fantastic it cost way less than a kendel fire but with all the same funcionality.

There chripring noise if you move tablet up and down slowly. That makes sure this tablet is not made with due care or one can blame entirely in plastic body too.2. \"Micro SD card unexpectely removed\" which if happens during watching a movie or playing games becomes very annoying. Since one can move couple of apps without rooting this tablet the problem multiplies as you either keep all necessary apps on phone storage or get sudden card removed notice.3. WiFi is horribly disconnecting even though I'm a half meter away from my router. This makes surfing stressful and failed downloads. Annoying when I download large files and all of a sudden WiFi gets disconnect. Reception of WiFi is also not great as it should be. On my mobile I get full strength signal in my next room whereas this tablet struggles.4. Too many unwanted apps by Asus. Don't know if I require any ever. Have disabled them, can't uninstall.Now some positive - this machine is beast in speed, usage and battery life. Be it playing high def games or be it running tab on WiFi for almost 10 hours or watching movies this tablet doesn't disappoint.Screen is superb, glows well outdoors and pretty viewable. Lacks automatic brightness but one wouldn't require if not used too often in changed environment like in and out too frequently.Camera is adequate for Skype or Google hangout (Skype's old version is running well, new one keeps crashing). Rear camera is decent for random clicks. Gives good result. Video recording too is very clear and in HD.No problems faced using any app as of now. All games and apps supported.

Also, I do not have to worry much about the battery life. Those who own a Galaxy will know that at some point throughout an eight-hour day a worry will sink in about whether or not to plug in our tablet. This (Asus) tablet actually makes me feel secure not only about not plugging in the battery, but about not having to wait long for it to recharge once it does require to be plugged-in to an outlet. Wow. The battery (again, not a technologically savvy person) charges quickly and lasts probably more than the 10 hours noted on the product description.

I didn't want to by some child specific built tablet which some were even higher priced than the ASUS or the cheaper ones that didn't get very good reviews. In my weeks of research it became evident that the best bang for the buck for this size entry level tablet was between this and the Nexus 7. Both have their pros and cons but they are pretty close in comparison. Everything will tell you the Nexus 7(newer model) is best but it will cost you more too. They said the new ASUS MEMO HD was closely designed to the previous Nexus 7. For me it was not worth the price difference since this was going to be for my kids first tablets. These also had the sd card expansion the Nexus does not. We have had these for about a month and they are used non-stop by my boys. If you are used to using and android based smart phones you will have a easy learning curve in setting up and using these tablets. It runs fast. We have had no issues with internet or running games. My boys run Netflix constantly and there has been no lag. This also has a front and rear camera with decent quality. I set them up with Skype accounts so they can video chat with the grandparents anytime they want. Looked good on our end and my parents said the picture on their end was good too. I find myself grabbing their tablets a lot to use vs. my laptop or cell phone now. I think the viewer angles are good. The only \"con\" I can see as noted by others is this unit does show finger prints easily. But that is only a issue depending on how the light hits it and come on, how hard is it to just wipe it off. They do sell screen protectors for this that helps with this issue, but honestly ours is in a case and I always tell the boys to wash there hands before they use them. Battery life is really good. My boys can use them almost non-stop playing games, streaming movies, internet, etc. and it would be at 20-30% battery life. This has parent control features but I have not set them up. This is a good entry level tablet and perfect size for portability. Will fit in your purse with a case easily ladies.

All it lacks is the Tab's IR remote capabilities, and it has a much better charger than the Galaxy's, which is known to be a problem the manufacturer has yet to correct, Out of the tabets I have purchased here on Amazon, dollar-for-dollar this has been the best buy, and I continue to use it every day for email, games, surfing the web, and it has yet to fail me. If I just check my email, play an hour or so of games, maybe surf an hour or so each day, I can go almost 3 days without a charge. The actual uptime on a full charge with constant active use (i.e. playing something) for me has been about 8 hours. if I just check my email and do little else, I can go days.In sum, if you want a top of the line tablet at a good price, one that has an expansion slot for more space, and dual cameras, with an HD screen, and even a transcover (close the optional case cover and it sends your tablet to sleep, saving power), you can't, in my opinion, do any better than this Asus Memopad HD.

I found that I was constantly reading epub books on my iPhone and wanted something with a larger screen.  I tried out our iPad for a bit and found it just a little unwieldy for reading with, especially in bed.  So I started researching with most of my efforts slated toward a Kindle.  I had basically decided to purchase a Kindle Paperwhite but kept going back to our local retailer and was really just not happy with the screen (oddly enough).  What I really didnt like was that there was a visible \"regeneration\" of each page as you flipped along.  It became very noticeable and then turned into very distracting.  So I broadened my search to the 7\" tablet line which led me to this ASUS Memo Pad HD.  And honestly, for the money - which was the MAIN focus for my search, I don't think you can beat it.  During my research there were a LOT of articles that I came across that basically said that you should skip this level of tablet (sub-$200, 7\") and just shell out the extra money for the Nexus 7.  Which missed my goal entirely, I absolutely did NOT want to spend more than $150 for a tablet that was mostly going to be used to read on.  And if I could avoid it, I didnt want to get to the money limit by settling on a refurbed product.  Below are some of the Pros and Cons that I got out of this specific purchase:Pros -* Great Price!* Beautiful Screen* Really Good Sound (honestly, I keep going back to Google Music to randomly play music because it impresses me)* Full version of Android - which Kindle wasnt getting me in ANY version.* Functionality at a LOT of other things besides e-reader* Expansion card slot - picked up a 16gb card for $13, now its essentially a 32gb tablet.* Had a reason to require some ASUS Customer service and found it to be great - good response times and fixed a software issue I was having with Netflix* HUGE array of apps through the Google Play store.* Surprisingly adequate camera - not that this is a function I plan on using much but nice to know its there!Cons:* The screen is GREAT, but one thing the Kindle readers have over these tablets is anti-glare.  Reading outside takes some creative \"angles\" at times to avoid the mirror affect.* Battery life could be better, but I knew this was going to be a trade off from an actual e-reader.* seems somewhat \"fragile\" when you're holding it.  Still waiting for my cover to arrive from Amazon, until then I am deathly afraid of dropping this!* I've noticed some screen \"flashing\" on websites in Chrome - assuming its hardware related.  (Not a problem I would have had on the Paperwhite - hehe...)That's all I can think of for now.  Honestly, the Pros so completely outweigh the Cons for what I was looking for and I REALLY do recommend this tablet for anyone looking for a good, solid-performing and value-conscious device!UPDATE 10-18-13:  Woke up this morning to a brick.  I had the tablet charging overnight, with the ASUS peripherals and this morning the tablet is dead.  I contacted Amazon Customer Service and they are replacing the unit (which is 13 days past my \"30 Day Return window\" so THANK YOU AMAZON!!!).  I will update again after I receive the new unit and use it for a little while.  I am a little surprised and disappointed as I think ASUS has a great reputation.  Hopefully this was a fluke!!Update 11-01-13: So far so good.  The new unit has been performing well for the last two weeks, including a business trip.  I will say on the trip I was using Southwest's Wifi and TV access and I was NOT able to access the Live TV which was available, I kept getting an error that the video would not load.  However I was using this tablet to access my emails, responding to and writing emails on the wifi with no issues.  Cross my fingers but the unit is performing well again and hopefully that issue with the previous unit was in fact a fluke.  I've upgraded back to four stars.", "Title": "Updated 10/18 Uh Oh....
