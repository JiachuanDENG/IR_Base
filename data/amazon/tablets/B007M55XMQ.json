Lavoie", "ReviewID": "R2B2VL865F5JL8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't normally post reviews but I feel strongly enough about this product to say something.This is my second Visual Land Prestige tablet. The first one I had was a Prestige 7L, which crashed after a few months. Tech support (which took a couple of days to get through to in the first place) was no help. They said \"send it back\", so I did. (As a side note, tech support didn't even bother trying for more than five minutes, which to me says much about THEIR confidence in their own product.) They replaced the 7L with a Prestige 7, which is their slightly-scaled-up model. Down-time until replacement: several weeks.Now, a few months after getting the replacement Prestige 7, this one is also crashed. It looks like it *wants* to boot, but it never gets anywhere useful.  It comes with a recovery mode which allows for, among other things, updating the ROM, but there are no helpful updates or ROMS available from VL or from the 'net community in general, so this is useless.I now have another note in to VL Support but I'm not hopeful for a long-term fix. In the meantime, I've ordered a Kindle Fire which should produce much more confidence and usability.As long as you don't expect much--or anything--from this tablet in the long-term, go ahead and buy it. But if you want something that works and keeps on working, I'd invest in something with more...well...anything.", "Title": "Strongly disappointed", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Author": "Edward Eck", "ReviewID": "R1YS4JIP08T0D1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Unit was not as described in ads or literature.

No HDMI port .", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Author": "Sherri S", "ReviewID": "RUEPPC9ZPSF8P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The screen is not very responsive (I put the pattern lock on it, but I had to take it off, because it took me about 15 tries to unlock the tablet, because it kept skipping spots as I was running my finger over the dots. I wasn't running my finger over the screen fast, either. After the first time it failed, I went slowly and carefully, but it still took about 14 more tries. Sometimes it would fail before I was finished swiping over the dots. I have pattern lock on my android phone, and I have never had a problem with it). I've rarely been able to get it to swipe from one home screen to another. I've always had to use the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Sometimes I have to press on an icon 4 or 5 times to get it to respond. Most of the time, I have to press icons 2 - 3 times before the screen responds.It takes forever to load anything. Candy Crush takes over 5 minutes to load (if it doesn't crash first). A text only web page takes about a minute or so to load (if the browser doesn't crash first). I took this tablet with me to view my notes in my college classes, and it took so long to load the college's website (which our notes are accessed from) that I got frustrated with it and put it back in my backpack. The reason it's so slow is that it only has 512 mb of ram, and not even a dual core processor.It also doesn't have Google Play. It has 1 mobile marketplace, which although it looks the same, isn't the same. There are instructions online on how to put Google Play on this tablet, but they don't work. You have to root the tablet first. (If you don't know what that means, you might as well forget about ever having google play on this tablet).The plastic case of this tablet feels cheap, and it also pushes on the back of the screen, (just by holding the tablet in your hand, even if you're not touching the back of the case) creating a little crater in the screen. Eventually, whatever is pushing on the back of the screen is going to damage it.Also, the battery doesn't last very long. If you're using it constantly (not for viewing videos or playing games, which will drain the battery faster. I mean using it for something like reading an e-book or surfing the web), it lasts for about 3 hours. You will pretty much have to sit next to an outlet with it plugged in all the time whenever you want to use it, otherwise, the battery will die in the middle of whatever you were doing. I bought this tablet to use primarily as an e-book reader, but the battery life is too short to do anything useful with it.The only good thing about this tablet is that it comes in different colours.A much better tablet is the Hisense Sero 7 pro. My brother has had one for about a year now (and I just bought one for myself), and it's really fast. The case is sturdy, the screen is instantly responsive, and it has really good specs, especially for the price.", "Title": "A waste of raw materials", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Author": "gregory m joyce", "ReviewID": "R2NHHKJ47DFIQV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "3 were bought as Christmas presents Oct. 10,2013,were given on Christmas .my daughters(age 14)power button broke.my son's (age 21) and my wife's shut off in the middle of use and have not come back on since.would I buy again or recommend to someone else?
