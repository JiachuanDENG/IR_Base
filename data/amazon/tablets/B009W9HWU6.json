Nevertheless, because I have access to wireless at home and at work, this little device has taken the place of my smartphone and an additional laptop I used at work.Why? The functionality of the iPad 4 on wireless only is absolutely sufficient for my use. If I need to use the iPad outside of a wireless network I have sufficient storage to save up to 64G of music, videos or audiobooks for that use. When I am online, this device works perfectly for email and internet surfing.I use it at work for email that I cannot access on my work computer and at home for reading, audiobooks, and games when I am away from my home computer. The display is all it is advertised as being - crisp, high definition - and the apps available to me are more sufficient.At home, with its wireless connection I can \"read in bed,\" play games, catch up on emails, use the device as an alarm clock... if I think of something I need to look up in the middle of the night I can look it up on this device ... so it is a VERY handy tool and entertainment vehicle.I am pretty sure that other tablets can provide similar uses... and possibly at lesser cost That said, the retina display and the Apple reputation (I am admittedly an Apple user at home and a Windows system user at work) are impressive, and worth the cost as far as I am concerned.", "Title": "Before I had an iPad, I had a smartphone, a Kindle DX, and a computer.

Basic requirements of music/video playback, or pdf/ebook (personal collection) reading out of the box is non existent. That along with a mere 16gb of storage does make this still a purchase worth thinking twice about.

It broke off inside the tablet.  After research, this happens more often than you think.  Apple does not cover under warranty and considers it \"abuse\" which it was not!!!  They wanted $299 to give me another device at the Apple Store I took it to.  I called Apple Support they told the store to give me another one at \"no cost\".  I think there is a flaw in the design of the charging cable so be very careful when using it to charge your iPad and if this happens to you, do what I did and ask for an exception.
