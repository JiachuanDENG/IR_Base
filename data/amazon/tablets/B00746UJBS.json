I opened the iPad box to discover...no protective plastic over the accessories and the screen, and a few hand prints over the iPad. I contacted WOW and it looks like they \"accidentally\" sent me a used one, when it's pretty blatant all over the order if you purchase a new or used one. Thankfully they provided a FedEx shipping label to return so I could exchange the used iPad for a new one. UNFORTUNATELY, despite them having my credit card information and charging it twice, they did not want to ship me the iPad first before me returning it (I use this for work so it's a hassle to get rid of and return it and wait again). So I dropped it off at the nearest FedEx only to become nervous again as they said they couldn't provide any receipt. It's been almost a week now since I've dropped off the package, with no tracking label or confirmation code and I've yet to hear form WOW what the status is of my new iPad. It's either a sketchy business trying to rid themselves of their used iPads or they're too 'lax and let silly mistakes happen in shipping.", "Title": "Review Against Company: Ordered New, Was Shipped Used...Taking Forever to Exchange", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Author": "TheMan", "ReviewID": "RH4J2EOS6TMLA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the new Ipad for almost 3 weeks now. I've downloaded lots of apps, use it for business meetings, play HD games on it, take pictures in different settings, use it to stream videos, watch my own videos on it, do some ppt presentations on it, use MSWord and Excell documents on it, read some iBooks on it, put the battery into constant abuse to see how long it last and I gotta tell ya, I'm pretty much impressed! But I do have a few cons about this tablet. And now I will list my pros and cons below.PROS & CONS:1.  Retina display is stunning! I have view wallpapers, photos, videos(my own uploaded & streaming)and it looks incredibly sharp and crisp.  I have some photos that were taken during a trip to SF Bay a few months back and forgot to bring my Cannon DSLR camera so we took some pictures with my wife's little samsung handheld 8mp camera.  When these photos loaded onto my laptop they look ugly, blurry, and pixelated but when I had them transfer to the new Ipad to view...wow they look great (not amazing, but great). The retina display help the photos to shine!  I've also uploaded the movie \"The Lorax and Acts of Valor\" to the new Ipad and even at 720p, the pictures looks stunning.  Then I stream movies from Netflix and Amazon and the pictures looks even more stunning.  Last week we went to a hiking trip and I took some pictures with the Ipad's camera.  I was a little skeptical due to the fact that it didn't have a built in flash, but when I view the pictures both on the new Ipad and my laptop, I was amazed how good the pictures look (it makes me wanted to take it to walmart and have it printed).  I even test the display laying down and try viewing from the side and the picture still looks stunning.  Overall, the Retina display on the new Ipad is topnotch and you will love it! Definately a PRO!2.  Performance wise, the Ipad is a quard core (4X) processor and with only 1g of internal graphics memory I don't really have much issues with it.  I have had a few crashes with some apps but I believe it's due to the app.  I have run apps that are processor hungry such as Air Supremacy and Garageband without a glitch.  I know with any tablet, you will experience some problems and the Ipad 3 is no exception.  I only wish apple put a 6 cores and 2g of memory inside but that would up the price too. Neither PRO or CON.3.  Responsiveness, the touch screen response pretty quick with my fingers but I'm using a stylus pen and depends on how hard the tip of your stylus pen is sometimes the screen won't register.  You will need to push a little harder. Still a PRO!4.  Productivity, with any tablet you buy it because you want it to use it for work and play, right?  Well, I have work with the new Ipad and play with it and this is how I feel.  I've used it to take notes during a meeting (I'm the notetaker) using just the app \"Note\" with a bluetooth keyboard and I was able to keep up with the meeting.  Pretty impressive! I have use it to give out speeches using ppt slideshow and able to use and edit MSWord on the tablet.  Even if I have to use third party apps to be able to use ppt and words, it runs great and very impressive!  I've used the tablet to remote controll my laptop and wow it runs smoothly without a glitch.  I was able to download some of the files I needed to my new Ipad within minutes!  You can access ONLive, Dropbox, etc. on the tablet without any issues.  Reading on the new Ipad is great also.  The letters on the screen is truly crisp, clear and sharp and I gotta say it's the best compare to any tablet on the market now (Even with the new Asus Infinety TF700).  PLAYTIME! Games, Games and Games!  I've downloaded tons of games, bowling, Angry birds, hockey, fruit ninja, pool, DH reloaded, Riptide, Dark Me, FLcommando, Dead Trigger, Juggernaut, GT HD, Air Supremacy, Metalstorm, F18 Carrier, Gunships, Blood and Glory, Infinety blade, and many more that I've played and deleted.  The games looks stunning on the new Ipad and it plays well (especially Air Supremacy, wow you gotta check out the graphics on that game!). THIS IS MOST DEFINATELY A PRO!5.  Well, every tablet has it goods and bads and it's no exception for Apple's new Ipad.  I have the screen brightness at \"AUTO\" and in my opinion I don't think the battery lasted long enough. It lasted about 6.5 to 7 hours for me.  This made me want to get the Asus Infinety TF700 with the keyboard dock.  I went to bestbuy to ask them why didn't the new Ipad support flash and they gave me a bunch of bullship excuses.  Well it's APPLE! They want to be different!  I really wish that my wallpapers could be a moving background like all the android tablets.  NO ANIMATED BACKGROUNDS - a bummer for me!  NO microSD card slots, HDMI, or anything else except your power button, wake, and volume buttons.  And it will cost me an arm and a leg to get accessories/adapters for the new Ipad to be able to stream (HDMI) movies to my HD TV, shoot my ppt presentation on a screen, transfer photos/videos to and from my new Ipad.  And most of all, I can not expand my internal storage cuz NO microSD card!  I bought (well...my wife bought it for me.  What a nice wife I have!) the 32g Ipad and with all the apps, movies, videos, photos I have already I'm down to 7g of memory left.  Darn! should have told her that I wanted the 64g!6.  Other CONS that I have are, IT GETS HOT! as hot as my 3 year old laptop.  The new Ipad can be a heater for winter (although the new Ipad might freeze during winter).  Do not put your Ipad in the car!  It does not like heat!  Even under the seat it will overheat, it likes to breath just like you and me.  It's like why would you lock your animal or kids in a warm summer car.  Same concepts here people! why would you lock your Ipad in a hot summer car.  When you play intense games or run application hungry apps it will get hot and you will notice it.  Another gripe, I mean CON.  What $#R@# is the use of a facing camera that takes pictures or video that looks like VHS quality.  All these tablet companies that have a little wimpy low resolution facing camera on their tablet need to go and do more research.  If you're willing to put a 8MP camera on the back might as well put one in the front.  I want to look stunning when I facetime with friends and family.  It's an advertisement gig! LOOK GOOD on camera to show the world they will come and buy your product!  PUT a decent camera on the front!7. And LAST but not LEAST!  I was very happy that the next system upgrade on the new Ipad, Apple will finally have SIRI on the new Ipad.  Well...at least I will have a woman to talk to when my wife is not home.  I just hope Apple don't use a man instead! better yet, give options to choose man or woman or an alien.  I guess, after all the PROS and CONS and gripes it all comes down to one last question.  DO I RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO BUY THE NEW IPAD 3?  Yeah...yeah! If you have the cash ($499 and up) or if you have a beautiful and very nice wife that would buy one for you.  \" GO AHEAD MAKE YOUR DAY!

Dean \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R3918O293VNU9W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started with the original Kindle - I love reading, and an ebook reader was a lot better than reading on my old Windows Mobile 6 phone.  Then the Kindle 2 came out, and I upgraded to that.  I found that most of my reading was done laying in bed before going to sleep, and I was getting tired of having a little lamp clamped to the Kindle.  When the first iPad came out, I sneered at it.  I've done tablet PC's since their inception back in 2004, and had no plans on buying one.  But after playing with one at a local brick and mortar, I grabbed a 16GB version and brought it home.  30 Minutes later, I returned it for the 32GB version since I knew 16 would never be enough.  Gave the kindle to my mother.  Then when iPad 2 came out, I gave my 7 year old son the old one and got the new.  Now that the third gen is out, I gave my son my iPad2, my mom the iPad 1, and am enjoying the third generation immensely.The processor step each time was very noticeable - even for something simple like changing orientation in iBooks.  The convenience of checking mail while i'm reading, or doing quick searches on the web when I come across something I'm reading that I want to look into a little more, it's like having the options on my laptop but in an easy to use anywhere form factor.Since I can find wireless pretty much anywhere I go, there was no need for any version other than just the WiFi one.The screen is incredible.  The resolution if notably different, much like the iPhone 4 was when it was released.  It was the screen more than anything that made me get the iPhone 4 when it came out (was my first iPhone), and seeing it on the larger tablet format is just stunning.  And it's not just photos or movies that it looks good, since I don't do much of either on here, but everything else, even just the text while reading.  Everything is just crisper and much easier on the eye.Having spent the majority of my almost 45 years scoffing at Apple, and not buying anything they offered until almost 3 years ago, it's quite a change for me.  The app store makes it so easy to find things (almost too easy, like how it's so easy to spend money at Amazon).  Most items I can install on all my devices (3 iPads and 2 iPhones now) as long as they don't require in app purchases.The screen is easy to use, the touch component works great.  The only downside is the handwriting - even with apps designed for it and styli, it's not anything as good as the Microsoft tablet platform.  Which leaves the on screen keyboard for input, which works alright, but just not as easy or quick as a full screen keyboard for those of us who touch type.Fortunately I have a Macbook Pro so I can charge it from USB, but I also have several speaker docks, a few alarm clock docks, so there's plenty of options.  But it does not charge on my son's laptop or all in one dell touchscreen via USB.Weight is nice - but if you're used to a kindle, it's a shock, since the kindles are SO light.  But still not heavy enough to really be a problem usually.  The back is just brushed metal though so it's not very \"grippy\" (one of the things I liked the most from the original Kindle was the back, which helped it to be held without slipping).  I always have a snap on case of some sort that gives me a better handhold.I'm using the smart cover from my iPad 2 and it works fine on this new one.Sound is good for something with just the single speaker on it.  But sometimes your hand partially blocks it depending on how you're holding it.Sensitivity for game input (tilting, etc) is outstanding.Camera works great, better than the previous version, but it still will never replace a real digital camera. More for when something happens and you don't have the regular camera on hand.I'm very happy with mine.", "Title": "Guess I'm biased as this is my third one, but it's great...", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Author": "Charlene", "ReviewID": "R2L6UNTPGPDO90", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally took the plunge and I replaced my laptop with an iPad. Loving it so far. I downloaded the kindle app and a few books. My friend recommended I purchase a kindle instead. She cautioned that it was hard to read whole books on the iPad because the screen is too bright but so far so good. I'm enjoying the variety of apps available and my kids have downloaded a few games. We went out to a restaurant, they have never so quiet in a restaurant before. They actually shared and were able to play together. I have read some users have warned their screen heats up but I haven't noticed anything. I love that I can use it for work, my kids to play and that I can download books and movies. I can't wait to take it on the road with me, I really hope it's true the battery lasts 10 hours. When my plan allows me to upgrade my phone in August, I'm replacing my android with an iPhone.

Luckily, my husband knows what a retina display looks like and this was not one... He checked the product number on the box and according to google it is an ipad 3 with retina. Then he looked up the product number in the ipad settings and figured that this is an iPad 2 and NOT an iPad 3! Apparently I got an iPad 2 in the box of an iPad 3. I think this is unbelievable! I expect frauds like these from craigslist, but not from Amazon!", "Title": "Warning! Beware of scams!", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Author": "Harkanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "R2H0ZG4U5GC4RO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Apple can say what they want but as a keen follower of Apple I can tell you the reason they're calling this the ipad and not ipad 3 is not what they want you to think. There are very few improvements over the ipad 2. If you have never had an ipad, then go for the ipad 3. If you have an ipad 2 like I did, I would say stick with it and wait for the next year's ipad. Let me nonetheless talk about how I use this device.What do I use my iPad for -a) I stepped on my Kindle four months back and have been using my ipad for \"reading\" since. It is a much better experience because of the backlight, the smooth transitioning of fonts. It is so easy for me to send myself an ebook. I simply attach the .epub file to an email and send it to myself and it opens within seconds on iBook. On the other hand, if I have a .mobi file - I can simply open it using the Kindle app. If the Kindle app is installed on your ipad, when you click on the attached .mobi file in your email it simply opens it in Kindle.b) I sometimes like to watch mp4 files on my ipad. I do this when I'm lying on the bed leaning on a couple of cushions I can simply place the ipad on my stomach holding it with a hand and watch an episode of Game of Thrones. Bear in mind, it will not play any avi files or divx files and Apple iOS devices support only mp4. If you have a mac, I recommend a s/w called \"smartconverter\" which specifically converts avi files to mp4 for iPad 3.c) I'm using a Speck case so the fact that this little man heats up more than the predecessor hardly makes a difference. Does it heat up? yes, sometimes, it gets very annoying and does definitely heat up more than the ipad 2.d) Portable mp3. If you switch the screen on the ipad off and let it play music for you, it will keep playing at a sufficient volume for hours. I often go to sleep on my couch with the iPad singing away for hours. It can play audio for several hours without losing the battery.  I am disappointed in saying the audio is the exact same as it was on the ipad 2, so it not Louder than the ipad 2.e) Checking email, facebook, the web browsing still needs improvement because often times I have found Safari a bit lacking and buggy but trust me I am saying this from the point of view of someone who's been using the iPad for a year. If you have never used an iPad you will find it sufficient, I just find it annoying when I'm trying to use it on forums. The world wide web is still not very iPad friendly. Is it better to serve than any other tablet? Hell yes. But is it as good as using Firefox on my macbook air? Never. The keyboard is great.WHAT HAS CHANGED FROM THE IPAD 2 -a) A bit heavier but I got over that soon.b) The graphics are slightly better. The retina display is not that different. Brightness is the same.c) The 5 megapixel camera is very bad for indoor shooting. I havent traveled that much with my ipad so I can't say if the camera is all that good outdoors.d) This heats, that didnte) The battery is the same. I thought this will give me a much better battery because the battery is thicker, turns out, the battery is thicker to support the RETINA display.f) Faster graphical processor .. making it overall the fastest ipad.4G iPad - I feel all of this technology behind ipads supporting 4g is actually very misleading. In what you will really use your ipad for you will never need 4g. I urge you not to fall and become prey to ill effects of consumerism. I strongly advocate purchasing the wifi model. Even if you do get 4G and want to watch Netflix video, you get a limited data limit so why would you do that to your money?**Pulse application is good. Youtube looks the same but the newest OS has made it buggy and sometimes you have reload a video. Very amateur mistakes by Apple.I should have stuck with my ipad 2. This is really the iPad 2s. Facebook app is good. I wish Apple would charge us five bucks more and include one of those white headphones. Do buy a case if you're buying the new iPad because if you drop this it is more likely to crack the screen. Stay away from big cases, buy something practical, be a little careful and avoid those screen protectors. There is no excuse to making such a good looking device cheesy. Though it's a good reader, bear in mind, you will need to charge it daily. I turn it to aeroplane mood when Im reading but I'm not sure how much battery that saves.RETINA DISPLAY - If you put the ipad 2 and ipad 3 side by side you will notice the ipad 3 icons seems to be more clear and seem to take less space, seem more organized. It is a slight increase in the dots per inch. The hue on the buttons and icons for the ipad 2 is MISSING from the ipad 3. The new ipad does have a better display guaranteed. Here's a funny thing to consider. When I stopped looking at my ipad 2 and playing with it, I thought a month after using the ipad 3, the ipad 2 would look a little cheesy. The same way my ipod touch looked cheesy compared to the new ipod touch. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN. The ipad 2 still holds its own. All said and done, gotta love the iPad.Do I use a case? Yes. Speck.

I decided to sync the IPad with my ITunes library and that filled up 16.5gigs, but the photos and movies look great on the IPad, and make them easier to share with friends and family, the music, not so much. Anyway, with the extra hard drive space I wont have to worry about running out of space, at least for the next year or two. I'm sure to replace this IPad with a later model by then and hopefully it will have a port for an SD card. I ordered through Amazon for 2nd day delivery, and it got here on time and undamaged. One thing that I liked about my Ipod touch was the weather app, on the IPad the weather app is not included, but if you buy the WeatherBug Elite app, you not only get detailed weather, current and forcast with dangerous weather alerts, but you also can watch the national weather forcast on the WeatherBug.com website!

(I have no complaints about either iPad - they're very useful devices and deserve 5 stars.)  Because I had talked with Verizon customer service before purchase, I knew I wanted the prepaid option and ability to suspend auto-payments.The rep's advice was to open a separate email account for the iPad (I used a free gmail address).  I was told there have been problems with AOL accounts in particular.  I was also warned NOT to delete the account or phone number when I wanted to stop auto-pay because that would necessitate a replacement of the SIM card.  He said I could uncheck the auto-pay option in the cell account settings on the iPad.  With that information, I found registration was painless and fast.I used the iPad on a long west coast car trip, accessing the Internet in the car for 3-4 hours a day.  As always, Verizon's coverage was good and fast.  I found that 2-gigs of data were enough for web surfing, checking email and GPS work.  I let the plan auto-renew so I'd have enough data for the last few days of the three-week trip.When I returned home, I wanted to suspend the auto-pay so I went searching for the 'turn-off' option on the iPad.  No luck.  I called Verizon and the rep quickly deleted the auto-pay feature from my account.  She also told me about that option on the iPad but when she looked for it on the iPad 3, couldn't find it either.I plan to use the Verizon access intermittently over the next year, so here's what she told me to do to make sure I wasn't receiving unauthorized charges:  Call Verizon to stop auto-pay (800-786-8419), then re-enter credit card information and choose a plan when I want to restart.  She said there was no problem in calling them for cancellation as many times as I wanted.Seems clunky to me and I don't understand why I can't manage the account from the iPad, but at least Verizon is responsive and helpful.  If I was a bit more of a skeptic, I'd theorize that Verizon makes the deactivation a bit murky in the hopes that users will let the plan roll over rather than call.", "Title": "Verizon prepaid data plan information", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Author": "TechGuy", "ReviewID": "R3416ZM2UUAZMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sold my first generation iPad so I could take advantage of all that the New iPad has to offer.

My anticipation was excited by the many articles I've read claiming that the new display is everything from your first experience seeing HDTV to a blind man getting sight.Since I had shelled out the cash for the new one and promised a family pass down for the old I was out of pocket about $1200.  So you can imagine my disappointment when I turned it on and saw nothing dramatically different from the IPAD 2.  OK let's get them both out and compare side by side.  More disappointment as there seems to be almost no difference in the visuals.  My first taught was they shipped me an IPAD 2 by mistake.  Weight, thickness, larger camera and a serial number check proved it was definitely a 3rd generation tablet.I have now had it for more than 24 hrs and can positively report I have gone from totally disappointed to thoroughly impressed.Why:Visuals from a distance of about 3 ft. when I made my comparison looked about the same but when you put It on your lap to view it at a more normal distance the display starts to pop and everything from text to pictures to movies look phenomenal.The camera is finally capable of taking excellent photographs and the HD video is with anti shake is very high quality.  Bringing photos up in IPhoto makes them look more like a printed glossy and very 3D like.Internet sites load very quickly and seem more crisp especially when you blow the size up or view a video full screen.  Download speeds tested out about 50% higher than the 2 and so did the links.My favorite racing game \"Real Racing HD\" issued an update to run on the new iPad screen and so I tried it out.  WOW first off the cars in the garage now have a life like appearance.  The game itself played very smooth at very fast speeds and the visuals were outstanding.  Even games that have not been updated yet played and looked much better.I read a lot and it was important to me that the books and online articles would provide a better experience and less eye stain than the iPad 2.  Too early to tell about the eye strain but the text on iBooks was noticeably better and pages turned smoothly.  The kindle app text was also better but pages were jerky and did not turn properly. Checked out flip boards new updated app and again the articles were all eye catching and pictures were outstanding to look at.So now I've gone from very disappointed to thoroughly impressed and glad to hand over my iPad 2.", "Title": "From  very disappointed to thoroughly impressed", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Author": "M.

That statement is of course not entirely technologically factual. But at the end of the day, it is feels more true than the fact that there are differences in specifications between the two devices.Ram, processor -The iPad 2 in some instances felt constrained with only 512mb of ram, so the iPad 3 was supposed to feel like an improvement when it comes to app management and multitasking. However, that difference is negligible. The iPad 3 packs 1GB of ram which is the minimum amount required for an acceptable experience. But due to the fact that the iPad 3 is driving 4 times as much pixels in the screen as the iPad 2, the experience is pretty much the same. Both devices render websites at the same speed, some games are faster on the iPad 2, some games have greater detail (yeah, believe it) on the ipad 2 than the 3, etc. The design of the iPad 3 chip shows a great increase in power even though it is still is clocked at 1Ghz due do a doubling of graphic cores from 2 to 4. But testing reveals that the increase in power is entirely used to drive that high definition screen and is not felt elsewhere.Screen, application size and Internet usage -The improvements in the screen are magnificent for people who care about reading on the iPad. But then again a lot of users do not notice a difference between the screens, and i was one of them. Staring at both iPad 2 and 3 side by side does not reveal the WOW factor to me that everyone has been talking about. What is obvious is that apps that are used on iPad 3 are much larger than the same apps for iPad 2 since these apps must have high definition imagery. So if an app is 20mb for iPad 2, the same app may be 80-100mb for iPad 3. If an app is 100mb for iPad 2, that app may be 400mb for iPad 3. If you're using a limited plan to download these apps, you may be running out of bandwidth sooner than you anticipated, and if you only bought an iPad 3 16GB like I did, it may only take a day to run out of storage space. 16gb was definitely not enough. The iPad line now needs an SD slot more than ever.- Processor - improvement is negligible and not felt over iPad 2- Ram - improvement is negligible and not felt during multitasking- Storage - it's the same storage for the same price, but more limited due to an increase in app size to support the high definition screen. You run out of storage faster than before. Charging the same price for limited storage is also a big NO. Apple should have already made 32GB the norm and included an SD slot.- Screen - improvement is obvious especially in reading and text rendering, but to some it's a drawback since it increases app size- NO Sd card slot to increase storage is truly disappointing. This is my main problem with the iPad line, and with the 3rd iPad it got even worse.-  Great 9 to 10 hour battery life- iPad 3 is thicker and heavier than iPad 2 - again a drawback- iPad 3 also has a warmer corner than iPad 2, not that big a deal, but an annoying featureFor me all of these factors caused me to return the iPad 3 within a week, but since I needed a tablet for textbook use, web reading, and my partner was already annoyed at me using his iPad 2 all the time, I walked into a GameStop and picked up a used 64gb iPad 2 plus 3G for $499 and 2 free iTunes gift cards totaling $100. The same price as an iPad 3 16gb. That was a much better deal in my mind than the iPad 3.The iPad 3 is not worth the hype, and since it under-delivers in almost every category but for the screen and 4G, I do not recommend its purchase. If you own an iPad 2, wait for the 4th to come out. If you're purchasing a new tablet, I'd consider the iPad 2 for $399 16gb or a used one with larger capacity for a cheaper price. Or the nexus 16gb for $249. Just remember iPad 2 has no Siri, dictation or other advances present in the iPad 3 due to apple's choice to only include the latest features with the latest iPad.  My jailbroken iPad 2 does Siri and dictation as well as an iPhone 4S and iPad 3. All in all I'm happy with my decision. 64GB of storage is fantastic.If iPad 4 comes with an SD slot, I'll definitely be looking to upgrade in the next year, if not my iPad 2 will be standing with me for the foreseeable future.Make the decision that best works for you.Good luck!", "Title": "Needs an SD Slot Desperately", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Author": "sam", "ReviewID": "R2ZHC4O6M76E31", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought my new ipad through apple.com.

The iPad is not one of these things, but it is still a very nice piece of hardware / software.  The problem with the iPad is the same thing that makes it incredibly useful:  It can connect to and integrate so many disparate services into a single interface, and controls me.  My work email, contacts, and calendar with my Gmail one, as well as any other account I configure.  That's pretty slick, and I can't say I've ever seen anything be able to do that before, on Windows or Linux.  The dark side of all this is that \"It KNOWS!\" ..... as it has now become a sentient being.  But, this isn't that dissimilar from Google, or any other service you use that tries to integrate all the aspects of your life and/or workflow.  Do I wish that all this data could be stored in such a way where the only person that has access to it is me?  Absolutely.  Do I understand the reality that I'm not going to get this kind of integration unless I give up my privacy and/or anonymity?  Yep.  Would I also be for any other alternative that comes up that can protect my privacy and rights more than it can when using iPad, Google, etc.?  Certainly.The reason I got an iPad is essentially because I knew it would \"just work\".  While I can't say that this has been completely true, it has been mostly true.  As a knowledgeable tech guy, I've been wowed again and again by what this device can do, with relatively little effort on my part.Gripes:- There is no Adobe Flash.  I don't give two flying fish about your business politics;  I want Flash, because so much of the web depends on it.  You can take your stinky business model and send it down a dark alley.- No streaming Amazon video. (EDIT:  Amazon released their iPad app on 2012-08-02, so this is no longer a gripe)I'm able to find apps (and am willing to pay some amount for good ones) that do what I want them to, and do it well.  SSH, RDP, VNC, SFTP, FTPS, FTP, and other acronyms.  That makes the iPad very useful to me, and I can subdue the rage that brews inside about these other things.  I think that it's possible that the iPad could be just as useful to me (if not more) and *not* do (at least some of the evil things) that it does.Steve Jobs was a visionary, and so was Bill Gates.  They both ripped off their ideas from other companies, and proceeded to market them better.

Long story short is that I absolutely love the Ipad for everything it can do, BUT, there were two reasons why I ultimately returned it:1. Connections:  I still really find it annoying that the only connection you have to this Ipad is the normal connection as seen on every single previous version of the Ipad.  Look, I know there is that adapter that you can buy separately that connects a USB cord to the Ipad as well as the SD card as well:[...]But, the general public that has bought the item specifically for the Ipad 3 are consistently complaining that it is very shotty and doesn't really work.2. THE BIG ONE!!!:  Itunes and the TERRIBLE interface when trying to sync photos from your computer (either PC or Mac ... and for me specifically a PC with Windows 7, 64bit), to the Ipad 3.  Not, Ipad 2, I'm taking about the Ipad 3.  Why is nobody complaining about this HUGE problem on this site?  If you don't believe me, just type in \"Ipad 3 Photo Syncing Problem\" on Google, and be amazed.  If you want to save the time, click on the below link which will take you directly to the blog as discussed on Apple's own community website.[...]Just start from that page and read on through 23 other pages, of complaints with this issue.  Some people offered solutions, some worked, but the bottom line is is that Apple continues to deny this problem, and there has been no recent fix/update with Itunes to remedy it.

I was definitely going to order one of those. I had ABSOLUTELY no intention of even considering an iPad. I have always had Android in my phones and wasn't about to change now.As I played with these two tablets, I noticed the pros/cons as stated by reviewers. My complaint with the Galaxy was the bit of lag, especially in the browser... but it was doable. The Prime just flat out disappointed me with it's non-bright display. I thought that someone put the display settings down but it was on high. I tried another one thinking that maybe this was defective and I got the same dark(er) screen. Also had the same lag time. Was also scared about the wi-fi issues I had heard about. And wi-fi is the main reason I am purchasing a tablet.For the hell of it I looked at the iPad 3 since it was right next to these. I immediately saw a huge difference in resolution. The more I studied it the more I was blown away. I went back and forth comparing the text resolution to the other two and there is NO comparison. The text on the iPad 3 is just crystal clear and as sharp as can be. You can even see the difference between the iPad3 & iPad2. While looking at small text I had to zoom in a little to read it with the Androids but with the Ipad 3 I could leave it at it's smallest text and read it easily.Also there was NO lag at all in the browser. It flowed smoothly with no hiccups or lags. After seeing this I went back to the Galaxy and now I can realllly notice the lag. Scrolling through web pages it was choppy and hesitant (in comparison).When pinching the pages, it would jump a bit and go down a few lines. With the IPad 3, no jumping at all. Pinching was extremely smooth and perfect. I have been converted!!Yes, I would love to have the Android personilization, but better graphics and smoothness are more important to me. The other tablets just can't compare in this department. I am a convert.Note - Give careful consideration as to the storage size you need. I was going to get the 16GB model and although I do not do many games, I was concerned about running out of space. If the iPad allowed you to use an SD card, then the 16GB would have been my choice; but I stepped up to the 32GB model to play it safe. Currently I have only a few games and about 4 apps. I have NO photos or music on here yet and already I have taken up almost 4GB of space. Obviously pre-installed material contributed to this but I would recommend that you consider the size carefully. If you will be saving movies, music and large photos, it may be wised to consider the 32gb model.", "Title": "I was hooked...!!", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Author": "AgingBoomer", "ReviewID": "R222UR6QJVFQJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the new iPad and had the chance to compare it side my side with our iPad 2.  Other people have provided more extensive reviews, but I wanted to give my two cents on the new Retina Display.Photos definitely look more crisp on the new iPad.  In particular, areas of photos that include fine detail are noticeably cleaner and sharper.  As Apple advertises, if you look closely at, say, someone with a white shirt in a photo on the iPad 2 you can actually see the display pixels, which obviously limits the sharpness of the photo.  If you look at the same white shirt on the new iPad you cannot see the pixels; you just see a smooth area of pure white shirt.I think the difference between the new iPad and the iPad 2 is most dramatic when you view print, whether in a browser article or in an electronic book.  On the new iPad the boundary between fonts and the white page background is much, much cleaner and sharper.  This will make the new iPad much better for reading, with sharper fonts and less eye strain.", "Title": "Pictures Are Sharper.

However, the Ipad was never intended for serious office work or as a portable storage device, so be informed up front, this tool will not replace your laptop or even your netbook due to its limitations.That said, I have used it to display PowerPoint presentations and to do light office work. But when it comes to editing or performing actual day-to-day work related tasks, this device is simply not capable of performing much (if any of them) without jumping through tons of hoops for every new project.This shouldn't matter if you use this tablet for it's intended function: to entertain you.PROS: The construction is second to none. Processor speed is excellent. Huge library of Apps. Long battery life. And fairly simple to use. The speaker is also pretty decent.CONS: It can be a pain to upload files. ITunes is the worst program I've ever used. The back is way too smooth to get a grip on (basically, you NEED a case/cover to actually hold onto this device with any sense of security). Accuracy with a stylus isn't that great; only the most talented artists are capable of using this as a drawing tablet and your handwriting will never look worse than it does on this device.Even with the amount of cons, I can't stop using this tablet when I'm away from the computer.And depending on where you live, a wifi version should be sufficient when out and about.

I ended up selling all that other stuff to pay for the $499 iPad that I bought at Best Buy. I'm typically an Android guy as I own the Droid Bionic and have only used Android phones since the original Droid. The only experience I had with iOS was with a second generation iPod touch I bought 3 to 4 years back that I enjoyed.My experience with the new iPad has been very positive. The battery life is fantastic, the screen is so enjoyable to read news articles and watch TV shows through Netflix and other streaming software. I've had two tablets before the iPad (Galaxy Tab and HP Touchpad) and iPad is the only device I've actually wanted to watch HD shows on. In almost all cases, anything I watched on my iPad seemed just as sharp and colorful as my HDTV and much sharper than my laptop screen. Top it off the device is quiet with no mechanical fans running in the background so your watching experience is really luxury stuff. I would note the external speaker is nothing special and that any type of TV or movie watching should be accompanied by a nice set of comfy headphones.iOS in many ways doesn't seem all that different at the core from when I had my 2nd gen iPod touch. It seems Apple has taken a more evolutionary approach to iOS while Google has tried to take giant leaps in user interface design. (Ice Cream Sandwich). In many ways however this has boded well for Apple. the A5X processor (pretty much the same as an A5 just optimized for  retina) tears through the menus with elegance and smoothness unlike anything in the market. That type of smoothness in transitions creates an experience where you stop caring about the clockspeeds and dual cores and ram and just concentrate on what you're doing which eases my techy brain into a calm state.I wanted to also note that the heating \"problem\" people seem to have doesnt' bother me. I rarely heats up and when it does it's just a tad warm nothing more. I recently put it in leather-ish case for protection reasons that seems to have reduced the heat on my hands as well. The battery charge time isn't a big deal to me because I charge my devices overnight and the slight change in heft is laughable as my last tablet (HP Touchpad) was a blimp in comparison.Ultimately to sum it up, the screen has made this device superior in many ways to almost every device I have in my apartment. It's THE screen to use when watching video and reading and it's super sharp and clear. The software support on iOS is the best of the best and the slick transitions make this a great device for almost anybody wants a great computing device when in bed, on the couch or on the go.

The aviation apps available these days are simply amazing. I no longer have to carry a big case full of charts and approach plates. It's all available on my iPad. Plus the location of my airplane is shown right on the chart or approach plate in real time. I can get 15 minute old weather including radar and satellite showing right on the chart. And with the 4G active I get updates in the air as long as I'm not in the mountains too far from a cell tower on the ground. The FAA and airlines have been crazy careful about passengers using cell phones in airliners. I can use my cell connection on my iPad for real time updates while in the air. For aviation usage the iPad is wonderful.That said, I use the iPad at home for reading the NY Times and responding to email. I have a Logitech bluetooth keyboard/cover that perfectly integrates with the iPad. I also use the iPad for displaying textbooks in the Amazon Kindle app. I can use the iPad for a laptop replacement for domestic pleasure trips. But for international travel the iPad is not very useful. For business trips there's no real replacement for a laptop when you need to use PowerPoint to make presentations or work with large spreadsheets or documents. The iPad is for light duty only. And it has no video connection for attaching a projector. HDMI is available using an adapter. But it's not well integrated. I see folks using an iPad for reading a book on an international flight or watching a movie. But a Kindle is much better suited for book reading on long flights. And bigger Android phones work perfectly well for watching movies. Taking an iPad on an international trip where it's a major target for thefts is really not the best idea.This iPad is the best option for what I use it for - aviation. So I can highly recommend getting an iPad for aviation. Make sure you get a WiFi 4G model. The WiFi only models do not have built in GPS.  I've tried the few apps available for aviation on Android. But they are much less capable than the iPad versions and there is really only one app choice - Garmin :Pilot. If you're in the Apple world and need a tablet then the iPad is a logical choice. But if you're in the Android world and don't need aviation apps, then the Galaxy Note 8.0 or the Galaxy Tab Pros are very good tablet choices.", "Title": "The only option for aviation apps", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Author": "Marydigs", "ReviewID": "R32KXU678BSSK0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love my iPad.

I have been the proud parent of many tablets prior (Asus TF 300, Galaxy Tablets, etc) and nothing compares to the silkness of the ipad 3's OS, processor, and retina display. My Asus TF internal chip overheated and my galaxy tablets constantly froze, which frustrated me...As an average consumer who always looks for the most efficient way (money and quality wise) to purchase products, I did tons of research concerning the comparison of the ipad 3 and 4. I realized that shortly after the release of the ipad 4, the ipad 3 was discontinued from being produced and not even sold or offered in stores while the ipad 2 still was. This led me to assume that apple discontinued the ipad 3 in order to make more money selling the ipad 4, since people would just buy the ipad 3 instead since the ipad 4 would be priced a 100-150 more, just for a half-second speed boost over the ipad 3, while they both held the retina screen.So overall, i highly recommend the ipad 3 to the 4, as you can even buy a used ipad 3 for 250. if you want a half-second boost in speed and bragging rights to say \"i have the newest ipad\", go ahead with the 4.

Mauricio", "ReviewID": "R1K16TE210781L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I consider the iPad 3 to be that one iOS device that hit everything correctly. First off, the display, this thing is freaking gorgeous. It looks like you are looking at magazine print with its retina display. Reading on the thing is a joy you'll not see a single blocky pixel on the device. The third iPad generation also is the last device to be released using the now extinct 30 pin connection plug. Now why is this important, I have a youtube channel ([...] and a lot of the content on my channel is devoted to two iOS games, jubeat plus and Reflec Beat plus. I do line-in recordings for these two games and let me tell you, the iPad 3 can mirror images with very little lag. It is the superior 30 pin connection that allows this with the AV HDMI adapter that is sold separately. The 30 pin connection requires no further processing on the adapter so the image comes out crisp, colorful, and ultra responsive. The new lightning dock connection iPads (even with the more powerful iPad 4) require the AV adapter to further process the video signal leaving you with much lag and poor picture quality. In the end, the iPad 3 is a great device especially for those who are in the business of recording line in images of their iPad. If you like to game on and share what you play professionally with line-in recordings, I can't emphasize it enough that the iPad 3 is the best device for you. The newer devices can do that but lag thanks to their lightning connection docks. The iPad 3 can do everything that the mini and 4 at this point.

However, I I L-O-V-E my iPhone and couldn't imagine having a Blackberry again.  Upon my usage of the new iPad through a significant other, I was able to log some substantial hands on time with the device and I've got to say I was impressed and eventually got one of my own.  The most important feature of the latest iPad is, of course, the Retina display, an amazing feature that deserves the acclaim it's received.  I only had a couple times handling the previous iPad 2, but I can also definitely tell the processor outputs faster than previous generations, if only slightly (and hardly noticeable) - in fact, the only MAJOR draw for upgrading to the latest iPad is the display.  Sure, the iPad 3 is pretty much everything the iPhone is, but reading books (I bought my first - the Steve Jobs biography - recently) is a dream on it, as well as seeing the apps in all their glory blown up to size.

My other issue is that the iPad cannot text or IM to any non-Apple device. You can email, just not text. With this issue however, there are apps you can get which will allow for texting to other devices. They aren't quite as simple to use(just a few more steps) but I'm sure that is by design.
