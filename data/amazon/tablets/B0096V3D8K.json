{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2HSE7HGNPDSHJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a bit hesitant to spend $300+ on a non-HD tablet, seeing as the Nexus 7 is only $199, but I'm very glad that I did. I am by no means an apple fanatic, I traded my iPhone 4 for a Galaxy Nexus and never looked back. However, the tablet ecosystem is much different than smartphones right now. I find myself using the iPad mini almost always over my phone now, aside from texting and calling. Here's my list of pros and cons:Pros:Fantastically smooth- seriously. You really don't need to compare android tablet specs with iPad's. The iPad will always have a lower clock speed and less ram, yet somehow perform beautifully and rarely have a hiccup. This has a dual core 1ghz, and my phone has a dual 1.2ghz. Yet, the iPad rarely skips a beat, while I have to occasionally kill apps or reboot my phone to keep its performance smooth.Battery is fantastic- I use this thing a LOT. Like, a few hours throughout the day. I blast music on the speakers, surf the web, tumblr, facebook, flipboard. Yet I only have to charge it maybe once every other day. I've played a half hour of music from the (also fantastic) speakers, and the battery moved 1%. It's great.The speakers are rich and loud as hell- I often used my roomie's laptop before I bought the ipad, and it worked. Now I have to use my ipad to listen to music, simply because it's louder and richer than the laptop speakers. And it's not a netbook, it's a standard 15.4 incher. The iPad mini is LOUD, in stereo. The bass even rocks. It's not extremely prominent, but it's a step up from the tinny wannabe bass from this laptop or my phone.Extremely easy to jailbreak- for the tinkerers out there. I love to tinker, thus the android phone I own. But with evasi0n jailbreak, you literally plug the iPad into the computer, hit a button, 5 minutes later, jailbroken.Slim, sleek, and light- This thing is a feat of technology, reminiscent of the first iPod nano. It just makes you think, how the hell did they fit all that into this tiny case? Holding the ipad mini for extended periods proves to be comfortable and painless, and it literally just slides into my backpack effortlessly when I'm traveling. I never wanted an iPad before, simply because they were too big, and 7 inch tablets were too narrow and small. This ipad gets it right.iPad specific apps- This is a big point in the android vs iPad wars. Android tablets are generally cheaper than iPads, with faster and higher capacity internals. On paper, they win over the iPad in every way. But where the iPad really outshines them is the apps. Many 7 inch android tablet apps are just scaled-up versions of their phone counterparts. But the iPad, being popular as it is, has developers writing entirely new versions of their apps specifically for the larger tab. And they look great. They're functional, convenient, and reliable. Apps like flipboard, youtube, and tumblr come to mind. Whereas on a Nexus 7, these apps are just scaled up (10 inch tabs get a tablet version of youtube, which is actually pretty cool though).UI (user interface)- Apple is known for taking simplicity and perfecting it for the masses. The iPad's UI is the pinnacle of their design. It just works, and it works well. Apps are organized in a 4x5 grid, with room for 6 on the dock at the bottom. The notification bar pulls down from the top just as it has since iOS5, and holding the home buttom gives you a nice greeting from siri. But the multitouch gestures are really where it shines. 4 fingers swiped up opens the multitasking bar. While in an app, 4 fingers swiped side to side switches between other open apps. And my favorite, 5 fingers pinched in at any point takes you back to the home screen. I had always griped about having to hit the physical home button, and this solves that issue. Also, swiping to the left of the multitasking bar gets you to quick settings, such as music control, brightness, volume, and orientation lock. Nifty.Cons:The non-retina display- Honestly, I think the only reason this bothers me is because my phone has a 720p HD display, which is becoming the norm these days, with high end phones getting 1080p this year. The screen isn't bad, it's bright and colorful. It's just not extremely crisp. It's especially noticeable when reading smaller text. I'm sure later this year Apple will find a way to cram a retina display in, and maybe I'll upgrade. But probably not, because it's honestly not that big of a deal in everyday use. The device is still an extreme pleasure to use. And this is my only con.Overall, I'd highly recommend the mini. It's a great tweener for the iPhone and full sized iPad. It's become my go-to device, and I really enjoy using it everyday. If you have the extra capital and are in the market for a reliable, responsive tablet, go for the iPad mini.", "Title": "Hits all the right marks", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Author": "nlv064", "ReviewID": "R2VUU17AT929HN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought Mini ipad, Dell window 8 pro, & Samsung tab 8\". I compare them side by side. The screen & resolution of Mini ipad is the worst as compared to others. After seeing the text on Dell & Samsung tab 8\" (1280x800 resolution), I don't want to read any thing on Mini Ipad ANY MORE. 1280x800 should be the minimal resolution for reading. The text looks nicer, sharper, much easier to read, and importantly, puts much less strain on your eyes. Text on Ipad Mini appears blurry as compared to Dell & Samsung, therefore, is hard to read on such small device.Web searching & emailing & reading experience is best on Dell window tablet b/c it is a regular computer. Android & Ipad can not compare to it. There are many webpages that I can not zoom in & out, & text is too small to read w/o zooming on Ipad Mini. Also, Dell is faster opening the webpages.. Longer screen of Dell & Samsung is better for reading b/c it could include more text in landscape view. But, Ipad Mini is better (to me) to watch video b/c its wider 4:3 screen size produces larger screen view for movie viewing.Pictures & games look good on ALL these three devices.All these 3 devices are beautiful in their own ways and all are light & are comfy to hold. BUT, Mini Ipad is very slippery b/c of its very smooth back side. However, one needs to buy a jacket for it any way. Ipad Mini is wider, so, is harder to hold in one hand (in portray view) AS COMPARED to slimmer Dell & Samsung tablets.No SD card to expand is a HUGE disadvantage for Mini Ipad.No USB port is another HUGE disadvantage for Mini Ipad (one got to pay extra $$$ for a USB adapter).Many basic, common functions for daily use are lacking or are very difficult to use in Ipad Mini, & so, are HUGE disadvantages, i.e: files transfer, video transfer, or documents (words/PDF) transferring & reading/editing .... Even if you pay for doc/Word editing apps, those edited files will not appear like what you make them when you open them on your regular computer/laptop. You don't want to go through few hundreds edited pages to proof read again. How can it be used for school works as people have claimed ?? I'm wondering !!!. I recently found few free apps that allow users to easily perform some of the above functions (transferring & viewing mostly) - this is one of big reasons why I bought Mini Ipad for my kids JUST NOW. Ipad forums show that ALL Ipad users have been suffering this limit for decades ...... . BUT, despite of these facts, & even though after many years, many Ipad fans still SHAMELESSLY deny its limitation, or lie about it, or still blindly defend it - many of them are probably on Apple pay roll, trying to push the sale by lying.One thing that Ipad Mini wins over others is its apps & games. But, Android device is not far behind, and reality is you don't see much difference between them when you look for apps for your daily needs, your daily uses.Also, The cost for Mini Ipad is high for its value at this current time, and is higher than other devices which have many better features. Ipad Mini should be around $200 or less.My kids' relatives have Ipads, and kids like to play games together. Therefore, I have to buy Ipad for them instead of other devices. I buy Dell device for myself. Ipad Mini probably is OK for whoever just needs entertainment or social media, and is willing to accept its limitation.", "Title": "NOT ONE OF THE BEST ANY MORE BUT STILL COST MORE THAN OTHERS.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Author": "Scott Frey", "ReviewID": "R16PVAGX01ECBV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It opened apps that we did not select and would randomly start typing when no one was using the device.Very disappointing.

Though I live right in the middle of San Antonio, I cannot connect with Sprint's vaunted LTE network from my home.  Worse, Sprint's antiquated CDMA network architecture isn't used in the rest of the world so connecting for updates overseas is impossible.  I should have gone with AT&T; as the carrier.  My GSM networked iPhone works in the UK, the middle east, and in Africa no problem, while my iPad is totally disconnected.  You will only realize how big a problem this is when you discover how many apps won't work unless they are connected to a cellular network.  Sprint is a big mistake. Should have done more homework because their cheaper data plans don't make up for their network architecture shortcomings.  True enough, the iPad works fine when connected with WiFi, but outside the U.S. WiFi networks remind me of 300 baud modems -- \"you are now connected to the world wide wait\".Another problem with the iPad is the inability to import photos using an Apple supplied SD card reader that plugs into the mini's Lightning port.  Turns out, Apple has got the iPad software so locked down that the card reader won't function with an SD card from anything other than the simplest point and shoot camera.  If you use a good Nikon, Canon or other high end Digital SLR camera that stores jpg files in separate folders you can forget about importing your photos directly into an iPad.

So i get the iPad 3 and get my first taste of the Retina display. From the time you switch it on, you just know this is something else. Crispiest screen you'll ever see, probably even better than any mac displays. At the same time, as you are sucked into the clarity of the some of your old photos, now suddenly looking like they were clicked from an SLR camera, you are finding your hand starting to hurt. Yes, the size and the weight of the iPad takes over and you are finding resting places for the oddly sized tab.I've just sold my iPad 3 and have got the mini. The size is just perfect and the weight is unbelievable. So much so that I didn't even feel the need to rest it on my bedside table to watch the latest episode of homeland. It does everything that the iPad 3 does and it is just more ergonomic. the one and only con is that it does not have the retina display and i might be nitpicking but there is definitely a difference. However, i strongly feel that if you have not used an iPad 3 you will not feel the difference.Would I prefer the retina display over size, the answer is no! Ill go or the mini for its ideal size and weight any day. I love this lil' slim, sexy black & slate beast.

I wear three professional hats as an actor, producer, and business owner and the iPad has apps not found on the Android market that have immensely increased my productivity in all three.

I will not go too much into technical aspects, overall functionality, and capabilities of the ipad mini.  There's a great apple website for that.  I will however tell you why I like the mini for my 3 year old son over the ipad 2.To give full disclosure, we love apple products.  Our family pretty much owns every single iThing that apple makes.  My son's been using an ipod touch practically ever since he was born.  So...a little over a year ago, we upgraded him to an ipad 2, which he absolutely loved.  With apps like Tozzle, Teach me Toddler, and the Toca Boca apps, which kid wouldn't?  My son has learned so much from using the educational apps on a daily basis.  Here's a question for you though...What are 2, 3 and even some year 4 year olds better at than being sponges and quickly learning things?BREAKING THINGSAn ipad is most definitely something most of us can not afford to be broken.  So to protect mine, I bought a OtterBox Defender Series Case with Screen Protector and Stand for the New iPad (4th Generation), iPad 2 and 3 - Black.  Once on, this case is just awesome and protects your ipad like a tank.  But to a 2 year old with slippery fingers, it might as well weigh 50 pounds at that point.  Now that my son is 3, he's gotten used to it and knows to carry it with both hands, but it's still a little heavy and bulky for him.This is where the ipad mini comes into play.  I was a little hesitant at first to pre-order one since it didn't come with a retina display like the 2.  I went ahead and convinced myself that we needed a an upgrade in gigs.  Who knew that 16 gigs on an ipad 2 would not be enough?  I got the 32gig mini in white and setup was a breeze.  I was able to just plug it in and choose the last back up of the ipad 2 for configuration.  It immediately loaded all our favorite apps, songs, pictures, and movies to the mini without hassle.  The look on his face when I handed it to him was just priceless.  He had the biggest smile on his face and his exact wordswere, \"it's a baby ipad.\"He absolutely loves this thing even more.  He's been using it solely for about a week now and has not dropped it once.  We got him the i-Blason ArmorBox Series 2 Layer Hybrid Protection Case For Apple New iPad Mini 7.9 Inch with Kick Stand Kids Friendly (Multi Color) - Blue / White and Ionic Screen Protector Film MATTE (Anti-Glare) for New Apple iPad Mini 7.85 inch / the iPad Mini 7 Inch / built-in Stand for Apple iPad Mini 7.85 inch Latest Generation 4G LTE (3-pack) just in case though.  Even with this case, it's still far lighter than the ipad 2 with the otterbox.  He can now easily carry the \"baby ipad\" from room to room.All in all, the ipad mini is basically an ipad 2 that went on a diet and exercised.  It's smaller, lighter, and faster.  Perfect for your little one at home who's curious about everything.  The Ipod touch was too little for our son, the regular Ipad was too big, the mini...Is just right =) We still kept the ipad 2, cause that is perfect for mommy and daddy.  Hopefully this was helpful for parents.  Please feel free to ask a question or post a comment on this review.

I don't make a big deal like some people who just can't stay quite and choose to be a apple fanatic. iPad mini is good but in my humble opinion I don't think it's as good as nexus 7 or samsung tablets just because their tablets has a much more interactive fluid operation system with better features and more perks. For example, the galaxy tab note has a ton of better features than mini. The mini is very simple very basic. It's almost like a big version of iPhone or phablet. I have had the experience of using mini and when I compared it to my old nexus 7 and galaxy note for me I could see the big difference in the operation system, features, and the overall quality of all the three devices and basically decided that I prefer android tablets (namely Samsung or nexus) rather than apple ipad generation of tablets. Maybe in the future when there's better features integrated and operating system improves for apple products or IOS than I will consider apple products but for now I enjoy android operation system and their way cooler than apple so I'll stay with android for the the time being.

I saw it as inferior to the 10\" iPad. Why spend the money on lower end hardware?Once I got to spend some time with it in person, I changed my mind.The iPad may not have the latest A6 processor, or a retina display, but it offers two very appealing things. 1. Lower price point, 2. An appealing form factor.The latter being the most significant. I've owned 10\" iPads in the past, but I always lost interest after the first month and sold them. For me, they were a bit too big and heavy, and it discouraged me from taking it with me when I left the house. It is by no means unwieldily, but I used it for movies and gaming, and holding it up for hours at a time wasn't that comfortable, and I hate using stands.The smaller size and lighter weight of the iPad mini makes a HUGE difference. The new form factor makes it more portable, which is when the device really shines, and it makes it more inviting to use, and that makes all the difference. For example, I can comfortably hold the mini in one hand and watch a youtube video, while sipping a drink in the other hand. Or I will be lying on my back, on my couch, and can comfortably hold the mini in front of my face while I watch Netflix, and can do so for extended periods of time. And now I can easily hold it with one hand in portrait position, for my apps that are viewed that way.Despite the smaller form factor, the screen size is still good, and more than large enough to make it a formidable device for movies and games, thanks to the slim bezel.Now I have had the iPad 3, and the 4th and 5th gen iPod Touch, so I am no stranger to the Retina display. I know how crisp and gorgeous it is. And while I do miss it, this omission is by no means a deal breaker. The display is still good. If you are using the device for reading, this would be a more significant factor. Personally, I can't stand reading books on an LCD screen, and I do all my serious reading on an e-ink device.And then there's the fact that it has the A5 processor, and not the latest A6. But right now, most apps don't utilize the A6, so it's not a big deal. And the A5 is still a very capable CPU. I have had no performance issues running the most demanding apps and games like Modern Combat 5, Vice City, and Infinity Blade II, both run very smoothly.The lower price point is just what the iPad line needed. I believe all tablet users should try both an Apple, and Android tablet, and stick to what they like the most. But a lot of people haven't tried the iPad due to the cost. Now they have an affordable option. And for people who use the iPad on the go, they have a device that's easier to carry around. It will fit nicely in almost any handbag, and even some coat pockets.So before you go knocking the device because of it's hardware specs VS the iPad 4, remember, that the mini is all about form factor, and an affordable price point. I could have purchased the iPad 4, but I feel like the 7.9\" is the sweet spot. I think the iPad needed to be sized down and made more portable. Check it out in person. It just might grow on you.", "Title": "Not a skeptic anymore!", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Author": "Conor Levis", "ReviewID": "RFTDB3WZ8ND65", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Screen on iPad had a touch issue which turned out to be a hardware issue and I needed to have it replaced.", "Title": "Screen did not work.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Author": "hdtravel", "ReviewID": "R1LY3TAOYUH01I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing high quality build quality.

So, I thought that because the item has only been used a few times and in new condition and that I had all the original packaging, that the seller would take the item back with little to no problem. The response was that the item had to be returned in it's original packaging, obviously with an unbroken seal to get a full refund. Well, in order to use the item, you have to take it out of the original packaging (duh) and was offered an amount that was a third of what I paid for it; obviously I declined to return the item and downloaded a users guide online for $0. This is the problem: when you order something online you open it and try whatever item you ordered to make sure it works or it fits you or whatever only to find out that the item isn't right and you want to return it - sometimes as in this case it's just not worth it. I'm sorry I didn't just go buy it at Staples or Wal-Mart.UPDATE: Funny enough, after the owner of Always Innovating read my review he sent the following e-mail to me:Always Innovating:I apologize that this transaction did not meet your needs. Customer satisfaction is very important to us, and our feedback % means a lot to our business. If you would like, I can send you a complimentary cover for your ipad ( please let me know what color) if you are able to remove the negative feedback.ThanksMy Reply:Thanks, but I had purchased a cover at the same time I purchased the iPad... I have no need for another cover. Unfortunately, unless you want to refund my money in full as previously requested (minus a restocking fee of course), the review stays. I'm sorry, but I'm sure you could easily resell this item for close to what you sell them at brand newAlways Innovating:If you would like, I can issue you a 10% refund and you can keep the item.ThanksMy Reply:You are totally and completely missing the point. You previously stated that \"Customer satisfaction is very important to you\"; well, I am a customer and I AM NOT satisfied with the product or the way your company conducts business with it's customers. It appears to me that all you seem to care about is a negative review which clearly states the facts. I also noticed a couple of other reviews of dissatisfied customers with similar complaints. It is an insult to offer me a bribe of 10% of the $312.00 I paid in good faith to your company for a product for which I am stuck with because your company refuses to refund my money, unlike many other companies I have dealt with on Amazon. So again, unless you decide to refund the money I paid, I will return the item, (which is in pristine condition) I refuse to help you.Needless to say, I have not gotten a response. It appears as though \"customer satisfaction\" IS NOT A PRIORITY TO ALWAYS INNOVATING.", "Title": "iPad Return for a Refund?!?

I'm currently using it right now to write this review. I really like my iPad mini because it has Siri and all the new updates with the iPhone c an iPhone s. If you have an iPhone 4 or 4s, the chargers are different then the 5. If you have your updated iPhone to iOS 7 you can if you don't have it connected to your phone plan you can turn on your hotspot and it has a password and it's just like using data on your phone. Beware that you are using data so you don't want to be on your iPad mini too much but when you using your hotspot it's just like having Wi-Fi and you put in your password for your hotspot and you can basically be on your iPad mini anywhere and have Internet and be able to look at emails and whatever else you want to do. On the iPhone that Apple Pages cost money but on your iPad mini it won't cost anything. I recommend it for someone who doesn't want a full-size tablet or iPad and wanted something just you can put in your purse or backpack really easily. I also recommend it for anyone who may be doing schoolwork you can get cheaper words and it could be just like a little computer or laptop. Also when I say like a computer or laptop it won't have all the functions as a computer or laptop I don't want to get anyone confused. Things that you can do on your laptop you won't be able to do on your iPad mini but having the keyboard makes it easier to type things if you are typing anything such as emails. Only thing I really don't like about Apple products are the brightness I don't know if I'm only person who feels like their products are too bright at night. When reading the book on your iPad or iPhone it's really annoying to have such a bright screen and I have to invert the colors because the brightness is to bright at night and not bright enough in the day.

I.O.S 7 is fast, it's completely changed Apple's look. It's got new backgrounds that move. The only problem is it takes 3.1 GB.  Next the Ipad Mini (I think) is better than the Ipad 3 and 4 gen.

When I study for tests and exams, I use siri/notes and when I talk on notes what ever I say  goes on the paper. It makes it easier to study. This device has great memory and loads super fast so if you buy a game or music it takes only takes a few seconds to load. There are  small things that I don't like about my iPad mini. When I am using the internet or Google, I can barely see the print. Also, it is complicated to set up Imesseges if you don't have great reception.

I read the Verizon version will work on other carriers but the same is NOT true of the ATT - so for me its was protecting the resale value.Love the LTE speed.I got the 32 Gb version since the 16 is way to low for me for the books and magazines I read.In a pinch I can use the tethering feature on it if my cable goes out and I dont think verizon cares - as long as I dont suddenly spike on my data usage.  The same cant be said of ATT.The ipad itself is so much easier to handle.  Its sooo much lighter than the regular iPad. after using it I cant get over how heavy the 10 inch one is.I also had a regular sized 32Gb iPad 3 w/ RD. and sold it to get the asus transformer prime. I got it since it had one feature I wanted, the expandable memory. I loved the Prime at first but it was glitchy and got slower over time.  But it was never quite as smooth as polished as iOS. I guess google needs to work on improving their \"photocopier\".I started using my wife's iPad one day and just kept using it since it was so much smoother and it never froze up like the prime.I decide to get a mini since it had just come out and it was cheaper. I got the 32 Gb LTE version for a little more than the base regular wi-fi only ipad with 16 Gb.The non-retina display is not a big deal for me even though I had a iPad 3 and a iphone 4 (replaced w/ a 5). The resolution IS better than a non-retina display iPad but not as good as the ipad 4 w/ RD. Bottom line its good enough to watch movies and view pictures or magazines on.The mini with LTE is the perfect size for using as a gps in the car.  Its way bigger than almost all gps provided in any car right now. Plus it doesnt cost +$2K like it does as an option on a car.Its also the perfect size to use to control my TV as a remote for Apple TV, Comcast (although I have the wrong cable box right now), ...Cons: The only down side thats important to me was the lack of expandable memory. But I did find a fix for that.  I use a Seagate GoFlex Satellite Mobile Wireless Storage 500 GB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive STBF500101 Black. It lets me stream wirelessly up to 500 Gb of movies, music or whatever to my ipad.  It even works if I dont have a wi-fi signal since it generates its own signal.

However, after using it, I have changed my mind. The size is what truly changed my mind. The fact that it's smaller seemed cute at first, and then extremely useful once I started carrying it around. I used to carry my iPad 2 in my purse and it made it extremely bulky. I can't even tell that the iPad Mini is in my purse. Holding it is not as \"cumbersome\" as a full sized iPad. It feels very nice in your hand, though I can't fully use it with one hand as Apple advertised. But, I can hold it much easier than the iPad 2. The image quality is not that of the iPad with Retina Display. But I don't really need a retina display on my iPad, and I can't imagine that everyone else does.I use my iPad primarily for graduate school, and I can see this coming in extremely handy. I keep all of my textbooks on the iPad and take notes on it as well. I watch lectures on it, write papers on it, among other things.

I currently have the iPhone 5 so I decide, after a lot of research. to go with the iPad Mini. After giving it a full charge I started running it thru its paces, registering and getting all my favorite Apps loaded. Then I started to notice that I was losing battery very quickly. An average of 1% every 2 minutes. So I went into settings and did all the tricks; lower brightness, turned off notifications, manual email receive, etc.. Even though it did improve slightly it was not dramatic. I was also noticing that it was slow and had quite a bit of lag compared to my iPhone 5. I ran some video and it was constantly buffering. So I did some speed test across my WiFi and found it was running at about half the speed of my iPhone 5 and laptop. So I decided to do a hard reset,  bleed the battery to zero, then charge it to 100% and then reload everything. Well the charging took forever but I figured this was the first time to zero and back so I'll give it a chance. I started loading it back and had all the same issues. Bummer. So I opened a case with Apple. They are excellent BTW. After the basic testing and trouble shooting Apple decided that they would start by replacing the battery. But I decided rather than continuing to put in a lot of extra time trying to get this unit to work for me I would just return it. Amazon was great with the return process. I give them 5 stars. Apple support was great. I give them 5 stars. My particular iPad Mini. 1 star. Hopefully it was just a fluke bad unit.", "Title": "Hate to say it but......Disappointing", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Author": "Irish-Mike", "ReviewID": "RLPYS4SUKDXP2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Okay, I was a huge apple fan for many years.  In spite of their walled garden mentality, I've always felt that Apple was the best money could buy.  However, I've slowly soured on Apple's business model.  The Ipad mini is nothing more than a miniturazed ipad 2.  The interals with exception of the camera arer exactly the same.  So, when one looks at what he/she is paying for it's outdated 2 year old technology.  This device was outdated and obsolete, before it even hit store shelves.  What does this mean for the consumer?  It means that as soon as the new Retina Mini comes out with 2gigs of ram, you will likely need to upgrade.  Let's consider here that apple has a history of forced obsolescence.  This means they can and often do abandon a previous generations product, when the new one comes out.  An example of this can be seen in the Ipad 1.  The first gen Ipad arrived in April of 2010.  In November of 2012, Apple stopped supporting it with the latest ios update, after ios 5.  This means that customers that purchased the 64 gig cellular model for over $850.00 now have an overpriced paperweight...but at least we still have the beautiful logo to admire.  When apple first introduced the Ipad, the company promoted it as a virtual replacement to the laptop and while I never really subscribed to this notion, I do feel as though at nearly a $1000 dollar expense, this should buy me a lot more than a shade over 2 years before the company forces the customer to upgrade, or be left behind.  Now, there will be those that say, \"Apple doesn't force you to do anything.\"  I beg to differ.  Yes, they indeed do.  Outside of music purchases in Itunes, do I as a consumer have the right to use my digitally purchased content on a non apple device?  The answer is no.  So, if I choose not to upgrade my old ipad, my content is locked tight in Itunes and I have no means to access it.  This is the nature of a \"walled garden\" and I as a consumer understand this.  But when apple supporters buy in to this(at a high price point I might add) we receive no assurances that our purchase has a shelf life of greater than a couple years at best, or 6 months at worst.  See again, those who purchased an ipad 3 only to be surprised by the quick release of the 4.  By the way, Apple no longer manufactures the 3.  So if you have problems with it, you have to pay for the cost of repairs at this point or purchase a 4.  It's just a matter of time before consumers of the Ipad 3 begin to feel the very same pain of those who puchased a first gen Ipad.My biggest issue with the mini?  The price.  Come on apple...The ipad Mini cost by most accounts $112 dollars to make and is sold at a starting price of $329...Give me a break.  As we go up in storage capacity, it will cost us no less than $100 dollars...this is pure lunacy.  I am no fanboy of any brand, but if we look at Google and Amazon's investment in cloud storage, we begin to see how rediculous it is to pay for onboard storage.  Apple's Icloud is nothing more than a sync service; it is not a true cloud based service.  Apple has no insentive to invest in true cloud service because to do so would hurt their bottom line, because they would not be able to charge the consumer for extra storage, as the cloud eliminates this need, for the most part.  The cloud is the biggest threat to Apple's business model and would surely drive profit margins down even further than they are already.  Please understand I am not an apple hater; but I am simply no longer a blind consumer and am informed enough to see that in this case, apple is successfully marketing and selling repackaged crap in a smaller bag...but again, at least we still get the nice apple logo, which of course comforts us and helps us to reaffirm our fabulous purchase of a brand new old idevice.", "Title": "Shameless cash grab device from Apple", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "P.

This is an amazing device and I use it almost continuously at home.  It's more expensive then the Nexus 7 with less features, but because of the wider screen size I think the price is still worth it.  Also, the top tablets out right now come with 2 GB RAM but the IPad mini only has 1 GB and this noticibly slows Internet browsing and video loading times as compared with most other tablets.  With that said, this is my first tablet and the speeds have amazed me.  Everything this device does generally runs 100% smoothly and feels so natural to operate.  For the most part everything is intuitive and friendly.However, Apple controls all apps very tightly and because of this there are some things you can't do.  For example there is no flash suppport so if you decide to go to southparkstudios.com and try to watch the latest episode you will not be able to play it.  Also for things like video editing you'll be required to put up $5 for the software (IMovie is worth the price though).In the end my personal preference would go to one of the new ASUS tablets.  ASUS gives you much more power for the money and it works on the google operating system which comes with the full google suite of software which IMO is amazing.In closing, if you like apple and use ITunes a lot then this is a great mid range tablet computer that I highly recommend.

However, the deluge of icons is really confusing and it's very hard to navigate to what I was last doing upon turning the device on. It requires remembering, finding and usually quite a few clicks and typing. Very unintuitive. The iOS 7 is a complete disaster, it is very hard to tell what is a link, what is button, what I can click and what I can't. I am often confused. When I watch photos, it feels like I am in an email. It was very hard to find the url box in the Safari browser. I often can't recognize what is the selected object or link or button. Well there are no buttons or links, only blue text. It is minimalist style to the point of uselessness. It feels like the work of a European preoccupied with style over usability. Very unamerican and very unapple-like. In addition, reading magazines is very unpleasant, requires monthly subscriptions. It is very hard to buy a Bloomberg Markets for $5 like I can on the street. Also each magazine has its own app with different scrolling motions. Some scroll to the right, some scroll down. It is extremely confusing and frustrating. I just want to read magazines and flip from page to page and I kind of like checking out the ads as I browse.Also the content on the iPad is very expensive - movie rentals are north of $5-$6 and some hot titles can fetch $10 per rental. Also the 24 hour rental period is too short. I can rarely watch a movie in one night after coming home tired from work. Especially if the movie is 3 hours. I only got the iPad mini because the app ecosystem is so deep and there are games on it that my daughter wants to play that are unavailable on the Kindle Fire HDX.

Their return instructions indicated to return the package unopened so I was unable to comply with their request and responded to their email reminding them I was returning this product.  They also require the package cannot be returned in the box received.  So it cost me $25 to put the package in another box and mail.  They received it on a Monday and said 5-7 business days to receive a refund.  I called 10 business days later and, fortunately, got a hold of someone named Fernando.  He was great and processed my refund the same day.  Amazon then took another 3 business days to apply the refund.
