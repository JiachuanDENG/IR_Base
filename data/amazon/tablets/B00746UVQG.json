I am surprised at the reaction of so many that say thicker and heavier. I hadn't noticed until I read it LOL I looked it up and here are the specsThe new hew Third Generation iPad isDepth: 0.37 inch (9.4 mm)Weight: 1.44 pounds (652 g)The iPad2 isDepth: 0.34 inch (8.8 mm)Weight: 1.33 pounds (601 g) .11 of an ounce heavier in weight  and .03 of an inch in thickness are microtads. I didn't even notice it!The performance is much better than that of my iPad 2, when you look at the new iPad then the iPad 2 next to it, the high quality of the new display it is very apparent. That on the iPad 2 looks more pixelated and washed out next to it. It has more memory than the iPad 2 did, and I'm very pleased with the updated camera, the dictation feature, more memory and mine does not get hot.If you are hot happy they let you return it for 30 days no questions asked. The Wi-fi connection is great, I did not want to be tempted by the LTE connection I do not need more bills with a carrier for data, my smartphone is enough for me there. I highly recommend the new iPad. The display alone and the 4 quad core graphics capabilities from the new larger battery, camera and dictation features are well worth the upgrade. If you only browse the web or read email etc you're probably better suited to the iPad 2 or first generation iPad. I also picked the 64 gb this time being it's only $100 to double the size of the 32gb so I would not regret it later. Why does Amazon and the sellers have the price 50 to 100 dollars and higher for the cost of the iPad than it actually is?

Using iTunes to move files from my PC to the iPad is like using some clunky shareware program from 1998.  Apple hates Windows so much they torture Windows users with the iTunes program.Tablets, Apple or Android, are limited computers that substitute slick and snazzy graphics on a super nice screen for actual wide functionality and reconfigurability, essentially they are smart phones with a bigger screen and no phone.I really think people like the iPad because of it's slick design, clever graphics, and compact size, and so make excuses for all it's functional limitations.  For me the vaunted iPad and Apple iOS is a huge disappointment and offers less than Android which itself isn't that great.I'll probably send this back and try another Android tablet because I miss having an SD card slot, proper USB port, and simple access to files on my PC.", "Title": "Limited functions compared to even a cheap laptop running Windows.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Author": "J. Ard", "ReviewID": "R2PSRD71G1I2XN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As my title says I'm an Android man, this is my first iOS device. There probably isn't much to be said that hasn't already been covered by more experienced users, so I'll be brief. I bought this with the idea to use it for a few months and then give it to my wife who's been asking for one for awhile. I was planning to get an Asus Transformer for myself. Having used this for a month so far, I now find myself on the fence...while I love the customizable features of android (usually root my devices and load custom ROMS), the ease of use and final polish of this pad is phenomenal. I like the screen, the size and I think I might actually prefer the 4:3 screen ratio to the widescreen of the asus, as it means less scrolling when browsing the web in landscape mode.Ultimately, the new iPad is undeniably a 5 star device regardless what we of the Android community spew against it. So if you like iOS, or want THE tablet all other tablets are judged by, you should probably buy this one. As for me, I'll continue hemming and hawing, for the next couple months while I use this iPad (much to my wife's distress) while I continue trying to decide if I really want to abandon my beloved android.***Update***So my wife and I have been using it consistently for about 2 months now, and my main aggravation with the iPad is simply that there is no native file management system in place. Example: I want to create a text file with my passwords on it. However, I don't want any person that comes along to open the notes app, see my file and be able to open it. I prefer to be able to \"bury\" it in a hidden folder somewhere within the operating system. I would also like the option to easily rename files, and organize my Pictures, Music and personal documents in my own folders, i.e. a \"My Documents\" folder. I debated dropping a star on the iPad for this inflexibility in the iOS, but I knew about this \"shortcoming\" (as least in my eyes) before buying it. I just didn't realize how heavily it would impact my day-to-day use. In the end, I will be buying myself an Android tablet while the wife will use the iPad.***Final Update***So I finally ended up purchasing an Asus TF300 for myself and have been using it for about a month. My reasons were mainly because I wanted the flexibility of a file management system and the ability to more thoroughly customize my home screens (i.e. widgets and such). While I'm happier with my Android tablet, I still think the iPad a 5 star device, while I'll probably give the Asus 4 1/2 stars. The build quality just can't compare, the retina screen on the iPad is beautiful, and the stability of the OS is rock solid. Of course, the price of the iPad is more steep, and it came with 1/2 the memory, but 16GB should be plenty for most users and anyone who isn't SURE they want the Android, would probably ultimately be happier with the iPad.

So over the course of years I always dismissed iPad because of it's price. I bought MANY Android Tablets and taking them back because I was disappointed with Issues. Here is a list:- Elocity A7 tablet- Samsung Galaxy Tab- Dell Streak 7- Archos (few of those)- HTC Flyer- Eee Pad Transformer- Xoom- Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1- Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0+Now all of them wasn't bad tablets, they just wasn't working properly after a while. So after all that I gave up on tablets period. I decided that since I have a now Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note) It was time to just save and bite the bullet on a iPad....Now I question myself...Why did I wait so long to buy one?!?!This tablet is amazing, It truly a remarkable device. I can see why Apple get's praised for making a device this good and this fluent. While I understand both iOS and Android is different and each it's own (There are some things Android and iOS do better then one another.) but \"The New iPad\" is leaps and bounds over most tablets that I've tried here is why:Screen:Bright and Vibrant HD Visuals. It's crisp and sharp and reading on this thing is Phenomenal. This is eye candy (or iCandy) pure eye candy to anyone who is a fan of a HD display. Unlike the iPad 2 which I tried at the demo at store there is no way I can go back to a lower resolution tablet due to the fact I am spoiled by this screen. The games look amazing as well. Honestly its like the screen isn't there.Speed:Quick...So quick in everything it does. Web browsing is super fast, Opening apps is super fast, Doing anything is fast. I never owned a iPad 2 so I can't compare the two but I am very happy with it.Apps:Good apps are in the app store. Almost anything your looking for its almost certain its in the app store and running perfectly if they are iPad ready. You won't be disappointed. Its one of the best ecosystems on a tablet device. This was my main reason for getting the iPad and I'm sure a lot of other people too. There wasn't a hassle like \"side loading\" like it was on my first tablet \"Elocity A7 tablet\" which lead to a terrible user experience for a first timer. The iPad simply just works and I can believe if this your first time having a tablet. You will be happy.iOS 5.1.1 / Camera:It improves on what was already one of the best mobile OS out there. Notification makes it a much more enjoyable experience. unlike it was before on the first iPad. The cam on this thing is so much better then it ever have been before 1080p looks clean and clear. Recording Video is nice! What bad about it is that it takes up SO MUCH STORAGE. I don't see myself using the camera at all to take pictures it's nice that it's there though. Let's face it, I don't think many people would want to use their tablet to take Pictures / Videos. I will just use the front facing cam for face time.Build Quality:Solid and it just feels right in the hand. Just don't drop this tablet at all. it seem like it would break pretty easily. I would get a screen protector like I did and a case to cover the iPad. I notice its a little heavier then the iPad 2 which might be a problem to some people.The bad:Well, The iPad can get warm at times on the back. It's also somewhat restrictive and limited. I would like to have an SD slot to add more storage / lack of customization that iOS such as widgets / and a little bit more open in the market. I can live without these but it would be nice for Apple to open up a little more. The price is expensive but worth it (especially for that screen alone) just little too much just for 16GB of space.Overall:I just want to point out that this Tablet is not for Android junkies, its just not. If your coming from an Android and that's all you've been using. I doubt you will be 100% happy especially if your so use to customizations. I suggest you guys wait for the Nexus Tablet from Google which I will be getting as well.But for people that just want a great user experience with a tablet without any hassle. Even if your a New comer to tablets, I suggest you get the New iPad. Its a little hard to say if you have an iPad 2 to feel the need to upgrade unless you want that drop dead gorgeous screen. But trust me it improves on what the iPad 2 before it had which was a good tablet from the start.It have the best ecosystem, it still has the \"just work\" aspect and it still one of the best tablets out there. Buy it, enjoy, and have fun!Edit:I took back the 16 GB and got myself a 32GB iPad and I love it to death! Personally I highly suggest getting the 32GB/64GB iPad. its just not enough storage with some Apps ranging to 1 GB+. Thanks to some research I also found out how to do home sharing on iTunes to save space.

I finally took the leap.Admittedly, when I first got it, it felt like a luxurious toy -- and perhaps it is. I kept saying to myself, \"my Macbook can do this\" or, \"Do I really need this app?\"But finally, what it boiled down to was that I was having so much fun with my new iPad. It was a mixture of both practical, functional apps and wonderfully fun apps. I concentrated on free apps and already have so many good ones downloaded. I have books and magazines to read, including audiobooks which can be read to me before I fall asleep, and apps to help me with things like finding yard sales in my neighborhood or Manga Storm, which is marvelous for reading manga on the iPad. There's Glympse, which lets everyone know where you are at any given moment.This may be the Wi-Fi version, but in my city it has its advantages. My ISP is providing free Wi-Fi hotspots for its customers around the city, and is adding more all the time. I imagine other ISPs will follow suit. Wi-Fi may soon be in competition with 3G and 4G. It sounds far-fetched, but at least in my city, it isn't, although a few years ago it would have been. So I can get connected in a lot more places for free, which is nice.I'm very impressed with everything about the iPad, from the display to the controls to the sound. I don't have an iPad 2 or an original iPad to compare it to, as this is my first one. All I can say is that I am very happy with mine.I got a beautiful case for it that I just love: the Osaki iCoat Slim Y+ Hard Case and Cover for The New iPad and the iPad 2. It fits both the new iPad and the iPad 2. What I love is that the front of the case is like a Smart Cover, except that it does both portrait and landscape modes. The front cover attaches not to your iPad, however: instead, it attaches to the back case. I also got a nifty little stand, the Arkon Portable Fold-Up Stand for Apple iPad, Galaxy Tab, BlackBerry Play Book. It works great in both portrait and landscape mode and is great for charging.I also want to say a word about screen brightness, since some people have mentioned about the iPad overheating. I was worried about this prior to getting mine. Yes, if you have a bare iPad and you run a game or a very graphic intensive app, the iPad may get a little warm. However I have found that most of the time, the brightness level that the iPad is set on, which is around 50%, is fine for me. There have been a few times when I have raised it to 75%, and there have also been a few times when I have lowered it to 25%. But mostly I keep it at 50%. I keep my Macbook's screen at 100% brightness. So I like a bright screen. But the 50% brightness on the iPad is really bright to me. The only exception is if there is a game and it has a really dark scene. Then maybe I want to turn up the brightness a bit, or maybe I want to dim the lights in the room. It depends on the game.However, most of the time, people are not going to have a bare iPad if they are thinking about protecting it against dropping it. Usually they will have AppleCare+ or some type of protection plan. Mine went right into my case as soon as I got the case. So with the case on it, I really do not feel any heat. The heat I was mentioning was when I was playing games on it when it was bare, before I got a case for it.Also, if you've never had an iPad, I learned from Apple tech support you can only have 11 pages of apps on the iPad (you can have unlimited apps stored on iTunes or in iCloud). But you can put apps in folders. So at least there is that option!All I can say is, if you've never had an iPad and you're on the fence, this is a beautiful device. I'm extremely happy with mine. The only thing I would wish for is more storage. I got the 64GB but it still feels like for things like photos, videos and movies that I would like more storage.The iPad third generation is amazing: you won't regret your purchase.

The iPad 1 is pretty much now obsolete because it is incredibly slow and crashes a lot with the newer apps. There is also no camera on the iPad 1. Therefore, if you are going to upgrade, you might as well upgrade to the iPad 3. Everything is better on the iPad 3 compared to the iPad 1 in terms of screen and speed.However if you currently own an iPad 2, I actually do not think upgrading to the iPad 3 is worth it. For one the iPad 2 and the New iPad look virtually identical. I even brought them both into an Apple Store and the guy that was helping could not tell the difference. You might think you can easily tell the difference with the retina display but you have to look very carefully to be able to tell. Don't get me wrong the retina display is beautiful but you have to look carefully to tell the difference. In terms of speed, I cannot tell the difference between the iPad 2 and iPad 3.

If you want to use it at an angle (e.g., while sitting in an armchair or lying on a sofa) - you still can kind of prop it on one hand (e.g., bottom edge on your palm and a few fingers behind it for a prop) - but your hand will start getting numb in just a few minutes (remember the weight!!!)- Sound: given its size, I didn't really expect it to have Bose quality, but still, it's rather more rattling than I care to listen to music with...- Battery: it never really gave \"...Up to 10 Hours of Battery Life...\", and with time it dies faster, and takes longer to recharge - now it only takes it ~2 hours to go from 100% to 8% (and it's been less than a month!!!)- Cord: power cord is extremely short (never seen something similar in my life!!!), so, if you want to use it while plugged in (remember the battery life?) you need an extension cord - with the bulgy adapter dangling just below your knees (when standing - figure out where it'll be when you're sitting or lying down) - It might be not a bad idea for a new product: \"belt clip for the iPad's extension cord\"...- I resent the idea of 'sandboxes' for applications, where each application can see only its own data and nothing else: e.g., if I have two applications capable of viewing PDF files, and I download/save a PDF with one application, I can't open it with the other; or if you have two 'file managers', each one's storage will be separate, so you have to remember which files are managed with which manager... And if you try to install a 'better file manager', moving your files from the old one is a nightmare (if you figure how at all)... Honestly, 'Jailbreak' seems almost a must... :-(- Applications: yes, applications are provided by different vendors; but there are some that come preinstalled - and some of them suck big time...

I got the Wifi + Cellular model for AT&T; so I could have the internet anywhere and everywhere. I have used my iPad every single day and absolutely love it!I resisted getting an iPad for a long time because I could not see a need for one. I already had a MacBook Pro and an iPhone so what would I do with an iPad? It seemed to be a blown up version of the iPhone (without the phone part) and an inferior version of the MacBook Pro (without the keyboard or processing power). So what the heck would I do with this iPad thing?As it turns out, I do a lot with it! I will admit that I play games on it a lot, but I also use it as my main \"to go\" item. I have it synced with my MacBook Pro and iPhone so it always contains anything that I consider important and want to always take with me (emails, notes, calendars, documents of various kinds, etc). It's my entertainment if I'm ever stuck anywhere, having to wait on something (the apps are much better on the iPad than my iPhone). I keep track of the weather and my kids (AT&T;'s Family Map plan), and the rush hour traffic (which can be a mess in the Houston area). Maps are easier to read and follow with the larger screen than they were on my iPhone. Even reading books is better on the iPad than the iPhone.

They each have their specific purposes. Even though I waited years before finally buying my first iPad, I cannot imagine not having an iPad now.

I sold my old unit and would NEVER ever ever complain about the blazing 4g speed with which I can play and enjoy the internet on the move.

While I still love some Android tablets, thanks to now owning an iPad 3 after owning the Ipad 2 for a few months before that I can say that Android developers have to catch up BIG-TIME!  The design aesthetic and ease of use of the iOS system and the design philosophy that gets passed onto the developers who make the apps is beyond average.  I will give my impressions on a few different aspects that come to mind as far as superiority.Hardware----The aluminum unibody frame and simple design of the front just gives off a great feel of quality and even though its Chinese made it gives you an idea of what is possible for Chinese companies.  If Chinese workers can put together these high quality products, its only a matter of time before before they improve their design abilities and crack out well designed and quality over engineered products that will leave Western companies in the dust (Please remember my kind comments future Chinese overlords!)  Even the glowing green light for the FaceTime camera is a demonstration of superiority keeping in mind the amount of thought, time, and expense put into figuring out how to make it semi-transparent.  Google the article about the special machinery Apple custom designed and built just to accomplish that one simple task to make the light glow green through the material!  Its weight is very light considering the size of the battery and the retina screen.  The thinness is still pretty damned good considering all of the above features that are included.  Thanks to the uniformity of the device that they purposely kept, there are stupid amounts of available accessories that will hold, protect, or customize your hardware.  Genius!Software-----Web Browsing:Safari is one of the best mobile browsing experiences out there.  Thanks to HTML 5 I do not miss flash all that much since a lot of the video sites I thought I would be missing out on actually work pretty good.  I am able to use the browser to accomplish most tasks that there isnt an app for, or if the apps is crappy I can always pull up Safari and just act as if im on my MacBook Air.  Copy and post is really simple in the app also so that comes in handy a lot.Taking Notes:Thanks to tons of apps including Notability (which I highly recommend for all college students) that made me lugging around my backpack ALMOST irrelevant.  At the very least I could leave my laptop at home if I chose to and annotate slides from classes.Face Time:This program works great on the tablet.  I am able to have a conversation as close as possible to having the person in the room with me.  I've tried Tango, Skype, and Google Video Chat.  I just wish more people I knew had Face Time devices because I swear I would just stop making phone calls and just video conference with everyone.  Welcome overshare and having conversations in my boxers!Watching Videos:This is so convenient using ___ that I rarely use my laptop which has a bigger screen to watch videos that I have downloaded from the web including MKV files, AVI files, and mp4 files.  It has turned into my home entertainment center, car infotainment system, and my constant companion when I'm dying to watch my show and have to head to work.Calendar:Calendar works great with my Google Calendars and I can move events around and put in all kinds of related information.  Just works great, despite the fact that it relies on a Google calendar system in my case.Mail:Works great also.  Emails look good and I can easily copy and paste different parts of emails and pictures.Bottom Line:I started to write the bottom line simply because of the fact that I realized how easily I could go on and on about the different aspects of the device and speak glowingly about this tablet.  The point that should be taken from this, if you are reading this review and \"considering\" getting the new iPad just STOP and buy it.  I can guarantee that 99% of the population can come to love this device just as I have being a former Windows and Android fiend.  If I made the switch and feel this strongly about it, damn near anyone can be convinced that Apple does, not good but EXCELLENT products and software.  Just buy the damn thing, you wont look back!", "Title": "The best in tablets, still the best!", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Author": "JLind555", "ReviewID": "R3SQUSTV8MADF5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "...and bought an iPad last week.  My first Apple product.  So far, I like it a lot.  Glorious colors, very fast downloads, enormous app store, I felt like a kid let loose in a candy shop.  I haven't had any problems with \"warm spots\" or \"hot spots\" either.  But it's not an unmixed blessing.For one thing, it's pretty heavy to carry around.  Walking 20 blocks toting an iPad in my tote bag is not the best experience I've ever had.  A smaller tablet comes in handy at times like that.For another, some apps and websites don't work as well on Apple as they do on Android.  Notable among these is Nook.  (I know nothing about Kindle because I've never used it.)  I have Nook for Android on my HTC phone and every feature works great.  There is no Nook store on Nook for iPad; to download books from Nook you have to go to the Barnes&Noble; website, navigate to NookBooks, and order from there.  Another minor cavil is that Nook for iPad doesn't have animated page-turning whereas Nook for Android does.  However, I didn't have any problem downloading my Nook library to my iPad; in fact, as soon as the app was installed, all my books downloaded immediately.  (Reading books, of course, is a lot easier on an iPad than on a cell phone because the screen is so much bigger.)The iPad bookstore is adequate; that's the most I can say for it.  It's nowhere near as comprehensive as NookBooks.  So far I've got 3 books on my iPad bookshelf and over 30 on my Nook bookshelf.I clicked on the Huffington Post website on my iPad.  Lousy scrolling and none of the comments loaded.  iPad has an app called HuffPo for iPad so I downloaded that and found out the videos don't load properly.  C'mon, Apple, you can do much better than that.  I haven't had any problem with any of the other websites I've navigated to so far.I was able to transfer all my photos and videos from my cell phone to my iPad with no problem at all.Actually, my biggest beef with the iPad is that the screen is a fingerprint magnet.  No, this screen is NOT fingerprint-resistant, I don't care what anyone tells you.  Five minutes in and the screen is absolutely covered with fingerprints.  The screen  protector for the iPad 3 is okay and solves about 95% of the fingerprint problem.  The smart cover is great for saving energy and keeping the screen free of dust and scratches.  Naturally the screen protector costs extra, but they did apply it for me at the AT@T store.  Good thing, too, or I would have gone bananas trying to get out the air bubbles.  Actually they did a commendable job.I bought the iPad with 4G from AT&T; because I don't have wi-fi at home and don't want to be limited to a wi-fi hotspot if I want to surf the internet.  The day AT&T; set my account up, the iPad worked perfectly until around midnight and all of a sudden it wouldn't connect to the server.  Next morning, it was working fine and continued to work all day with no problems until late that night when it wouldn't connect again.  I took it back to the AT@T store the following day and they told me AT&T; was having some server problems which should be fixed by that evening.  They were.  No connection problems since then.Overall, the iPad is a lot of fun.  I'm still exploring all the various apps it comes with (I absolutely love the Photo Booth) and getting used to how it works.  It's not perfect, but what is?Judy Lind", "Title": "I finally succumbed...", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Author": "Whitney Best \"Whitney\"", "ReviewID": "R5T6I08GWE7HE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great size for carrying especially if you have back problems and/or a disability like me.

I received the iPad1 two years ago as a gift that I turned to my wife. When the iPad came into the market I thought it was just a bigger iPod touch, but it is much more than that. Its display allows to be used as a game pad for kids or adults, a great news paper reader, e-book reader, photo frame, instant internet browser and as I have done, reading personal and corporate e-mail. Its vast application store gives you access to thousand of free applications.Early adopters of iPad has the benefit of downloading free applications (or 99c apps) that later required purchased or a price increment, but as an early adopter those apps can be downloaded to you new iPad without requiring to purchase them again.Unless not all applications has been upgraded to the new retina display, it is noticeable when you open your photo library or the background photo. In some cases those not upgraded applications seems worst because the HD display make bad pictures to seem worse (similar to watching a SD program on an HD TV).The drawback that I have noticed on both iPhone 4S and newiPad (I have not tested the iPad1) is that when I connect them to my car AUX input they both does not seem to give enough power volume, so it requires to turn car stereo volume to it's maximum, so a lot of noise is then perceived. I do compare with an classic iPod and a Blackberry that perform much better on this circumstances.I have purchased a magnet case, but I have turned off the turn on on open since there are a lot of miss fires due an small movement. There should be a setting to turn it on by opening and touching the screen or something to prevent miss fire.One thing that I miss on iPad is the ability to take pictures even it is blocked (as the iPhone 4S) also to mute music when it is locked.", "Title": "Great New Retina Display", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Author": "diablo-urban-o", "ReviewID": "RHG8DQZ7O60NH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought the ipad to do some development, however the features, the easiness to work, the great resolution make it the best investment so far", "Title": "ipad, good investment", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Author": "blondie68", "ReviewID": "RBP7KMS54LB17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the picture quality and the front facing camera feature.

Moreover, if Amazon Payments or Paypal don't work for you either making even Cydia Store unusable, your only source of applications will be pirated stuff from the shady Internet corners. Note that I am not advocating piracy -- I am merely presenting the choices you will have if you cannot select your country in iTunes Store.During my last visit to San Francisco I have purchased Apple iPad 3 (16GB, WiFi, white) in an Apple Store. I paid for it using my VISA credit card issued in Serbia with absolutely no issues. However, iTunes Store will not accept the very same credit card because I cannot enter valid billing address -- my country is not on the list.I exchanged several emails with Apple Support, but the only thing they were able to tell me is that my country is not currently supported and that they will eventually support it some day.Now I have a great piece of hardware which is useless except for very basic stuff -- email (a trivial client for people who get at most 1 email per day and delete it after reading), surf (if you can stand the ads because there is no ad blocker in Safari), social networks, some PDF documents, and that's about it.Thanks to Apple, I cannot purchase software, books, music, movies, tv shows, nothing. So, my advice to you is -- do your homework before purchasing. I admit that I didn't, because I haven't expected that in this day and age of e-banking and e-commerce someone is still discriminating credit cards by the country of issuance.", "Title": "If you are not from USA or major EU countries...", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Author": "kitkat", "ReviewID": "R3112CXG9M15ZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "AWESOME - I have just retired and I was debating on getting a new laptop or the IPad.

And there will be host of tablet makers good/bad/ugly onces in the market and trying to find the best one is difficult. So that means another 1.5 years of wait.Meanwhile, about 8 months back I purchased asus transformer 1st gen. It kept me happy for sometime, but latter I was less than happy with its performance. With the death of asus transformer tablet that I own, it was no brainer to buy the 3rd gen iPad.The iPad does what it is advertised to do, it is a giant iPod touch, but the larger screen is always better.The tablet is all nice and good, the apps, the performance the acceleration, the retina display etc.BUT the display calibration is bad.

It is not a good deal with the batter, right? The battery discharges way faster than recharging. I am using the adapter and cable provided by the iPad 3. The battery recharging capability is less than satisfactory to me.Edit2: I upped my rating by one star because I am more than happy with the performance of the device.

Why kick the company to the curb that has already done all the work, put all the money needed into it, and is proven itself. Why? Apple has gotten a big head again, and believes that whatever it makes it just has to be better.Touch sensitivity: I used my friends iPad 2 for awhile after he upgraded to the iPad 3. He told me I had to try the new version. The touch sensitivity seems to be off. It does not have the response of the iPad 2, Samsung Tab, or even a Kindle I used to have.Retina display failure: I see no difference between the iPad 2 and the new iPad. If you are looking at upgrading to the new one for its display don't. There is nothing special about it. It is just a numbers game.Must use iTunes: iTunes is one of the main reasons I will never own an Apple product. This software is awful. I cannot believe they have not made it easier to use. If you want to buy all your stuff through apple then yes, oh yes they make it easier. But what if you are not brain wasted by apple and you want to use Amazon to get your music for a better price? Not so easy to get it on the iPad. The software is a joke.No support for other video formats. This device unlike all its competitors has said no to supporting standardized formats. If you are buying this device and wanting to transfer your current videos to it, don't. It will only support the apple format.Your apple ID: This is nearly the worst part of the iPad itself. You cannot do anything on the iPad without this ID. It is terrible, and if you forget your security questions you will need a crack team that can get into Fort Knox to get back in. Why are these questions so important? Well it took me over a month to help my mother fully get back into her apple ID because if you upgrade to a new apple product and you do not know those questions? Good Luck! You may never get back in. And if you have spent a lot of money in iTunes it could be lost. BEWARE: write down your security questions.So much for ease of use. I have had in the past year family come up saying with a big smile I just got the iPad. I tell them good luck with that. They go off and \"play\" with it for awhile.
