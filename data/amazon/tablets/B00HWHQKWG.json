The stylus was the biggest selling point, though.  I can write on the screen in One Note and Journal and it even has OCR for writing with the stylus in MS Office.  It also doubles a mouse/pointer for when my fingers are too fat to zero in on just the right object that I want to select.  I'm glad I went with the full Windows 8.1 rather than the RT and I would recommend going with the 64 GB version rather than the 32. All of the preloaded software takes up most of the first 32 GB.

I've played around with IPads when I had the chance and wanted one for some time, so I was thrilled to have the opportunity to test this one out through the Vine program.  I expected to have some challenges with getting used to it but it's quite intuitive if you're familiar with Windows operating systems. We have an older desktop with Vista (yes, I know!) and a laptop with Windows 7, and my son has a new laptop touch screen with Windows 8, so it's been pretty easy for me .  It was much easier than using my husband's IPad.  I had never used a stylus before, however, so there was a learning curve for it, once I located it in the lower, right corner of the tablet, but it seems to work well enough.  I haven't done much actual writing and only played around with drawing a bit but it makes using the smallish graphics a lot easier than a finger touch at times.This all said, I'm thrilled with the clear, bright display and ease of use of the ASUS Vivo Tab Note 8!  With the Window 8.1 op system it's like having a mini laptop in your hand.  It's fast, with good connectivity , and you can quickly access your mail and internet sites as well as download apps or movies.  You also have a pretty good camera and a fair editing program.  And, the sound is decent for a device this size, better than my Toshiba laptop!  I have not tried it with headphones yet, but when I do, I will update.I've been very happy with the battery life and I've used it for 5-6 hours with some to spare.  It charges quickly, which is good, as the cord is only about 3 feet long if you wanted to use it while plugged in.I purchased this http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IE3QDX8/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1 Thankscase for it and like it very much.

That said, I'm returning it after a single day.It's not the perfect computer for me, but it very well might be for you!SetupUp until a few months ago I was entrenched in the Apple ecosystem - for the past ten years I've owned nothing but macs, iPads and iPhones, and loved them. Then a friend let me play around with his Surface Pro, and it blew me away. It was the perfect work / light play computer, and the fact I could handwrite notes on it completely sold me. So I bought one, and recently upgraded to a Surface Pro 2.What I was looking for, though, was a smaller computer to use when I'm working away from my desk and don't want to pull out a large tablet, or one to jot down hand-written notes on the side when my Surface is docked at work.On paper the Vivo Tab looked like a perfect match - it could sync with my Surface, it has a Wacom pen for writing, and it's relatively cheap! I really, really wanted to love this computer, and here are the things that left an impression:Good-- A Fantastic Value: Following what I mentioned above, holding a handheld computer that can run most modern software and has pen input for under $400 (with tax) is like living in the future.-- Pen Input / Dock: This can't be stressed enough - if you want to jot down notes digitally, OneNote with a pen input is the greatest thing ever, and this computer works perfectly with it. The pen is a little small, but it has a built-in dock (something the surface is missing), and any Wacom pen should work.So-So-- Small Screen: When using the metro interface, Windows 8 works perfectly on a screen this small, but traditional desktop mode suffers. You'll read this from other reviews, but it bears repeating here - the icons on the desktop are tiny. Really, really tiny. Stick with metro as the app picker and you won' t have a problem.\u000b-- Build Quality: The Vivo Tab has a bit of a cheap feel to it - which I guess is to be expected from the price point - but it's nothing too distracting. It's very plastic'y, picks up fingerprints like mad, and has a plastic \"lip\" going around the edge that hangs out slightly.-- Buttons: Some people might not mind, but having the power and windows buttons on either side of the device (rather than on the top and under the screen) is a strange design choice, and goes counter to similar device layouts.Bad-- Screen Resolution: The factor that's making me return this device is the screen. It's bright, but the viewing angles aren't great (there's some darkening on the top when viewing at an angle) and the resolution doesn't quite work. It makes all smaller text give off a faint \"smudge\" on the side, which is highly distracting if you care about such things, especially coming from the Surface Pro (which has remarkable viewing angles and hyper clean text).-- Screen Feel: This might be able to be fixed with a screen protector, but this tablet has a bit of a \"rough\" aspect. Even after cleaning it, I can feel areas that have a bit of drag when lightly gliding the pen across it. The Surface, however is completely smooth.So, if you're looking for a solid handheld computer for a great price, and don't mind a screen that is \"ok\" rather than \"great\", jump on the Vivo Tab 8. If the screen sounds like it could be an issue, though, hold off. Apparently Microsoft is working on a smaller Surface, which will hopefully be the perfect match for my needs.", "Title": "Great for Some, Not for Me - 3.5 Stars", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Author": "Scott R", "ReviewID": "R1RL6UK164TWL5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this tablet about a week now and have easily put in 40 hours of use already, that is how much I am enjoying the tablet. For an extremely fair price, this is a great full Windows tablet.Performance - 9/10Overall I'd compare this to a entry level laptop software performance wise. It is powerful enough to run Adobe suite software with only small amounts of lag and is able to run Civilization V in touchscreen mode with a bit of a long load time but adequate performance once its up and going. Obviously not going to run anything reliant on a discreet GPU but all lower demand Steam games should work. For development, Eclipse and Visual Studio run just fine (with a bit of a slow load time from VS though). I've had only a couple seconds of mild hangups from the device and only while running numerous desktop apps and flipping between screens quickly. Definitely performs better than I expected it to.Hardware - 9/10The case is nice overall, matte backing is nice feeling and has no sway or flexibility and the device is reasonably thin and light. There is a bit of a lip around the screen with a slight crevice. This kind of retracts from it having a super refined feel like higher end devices, which this isn't so can't really complain. Screen is standard, glossy and smudges easily. Also with the lip around it a bit harder to clean than some devices but not bad.Pen - 8/10The integrated Wacom pen is a big factor of this machine, and was one of the bigger selling points for this over any of the competition for me. I am overall happy with the pen, great performance for a tablet but not as spot on as some. Accuracy is pretty good once I re-calibrated it, out of the box it was off by a 1/10th of a inch or so. The only issues are that the sensitivity detection is lost near the edges of the screen causing any drawn lines to become fainter (in drawing apps that support pressure sensitivity) and any button presses harder to detect. It is not bad enough to really screw me up but I am also not a professional artist so it might be more of a sketch pad to the artists rather than a professional tool. The pen itself is longer than I expected (essentially the whole width of the tablet in length), fairly stable feeling though could be snapped in half if attempted, and the tip is smooth but has a very slight amount of sway to it which I believe is necessary for pressure detection (?). My only complaint is that the button is a bit hard to find, wish it had a bump or indent to make it easier to feel without having to look at the stylus.Screen - 8/10Not the sharpest screen in existence but it looks good enough when watching video or playing a game. The viewing angle is impressive, really no angle where I can't make out the screen. With the brightness turned up it is bright enough to see in the sun, but at the cost of battery life.Sound - 8/10Adequate but not amazing. In a quiet room I was able to hear the stereo on a game I was playing and decipher left and right easily. Music actually sounds pretty good through it as well. That said it is not loud enough to compete with loud noises in the area so like most tablets, headphones or external speakers are recommended.Battery - 8/10Have only had it for a week so time will see how well it holds up. So far it seems to be better than a laptop but not as good as some other tablets. So far it will last for 6 or so hours of extensive use at default brightness with a full battery. I haven't left it alone long enough to really see how well it lasts in standby but overnight on standby the battery will only decrease slightly which leads me to believe it should last at least 2-3 days on standby without issues. As I use it more I will update this. UPDATE: I was busy this weekend and ended up leaving the tablet in standby from Friday night to Monday morning, it sat in my laptop bag the whole time and only went from 100% down to 86%.My Overall Rating - 9/10For the price this really cannot be beat. I would recommend this device to anyone looking for a windows tablet. I would give it 4.5 Stars if that was a option, rounding it up to 5 Stars because I feel it deserves that rather than being rounded down to a 4.", "Title": "Overall Great Tablet - Very Happy with Purchase", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Author": "Marwan Al Hemairi", "ReviewID": "R1RLSXYFOM6ETV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have bought an iOS and Android tablets in the past but I have never bought a Windows tablet before.

The Dell Venue 8 has identical specs and much nicer build quality for $100 less. If the Wacon Stylus is a necessity, this is your best (and currently only) option.First, the thing most people are probably looking at this tablet over any of the other 8-inch windows tablets for; the stylus. It's wacom and it writes very smoothly. However, the included stylus is TERRIBLE, borderline unusable. It is extremely thin and narrow, making it a real pain to hold for even a short time, let alone using for extended periods. The right click but is far too easy to click and I constantly found myself accidentally clicking it when I didn't want to, and needing to adjust the stylus in my hand when I needed to. The tip also seemed rather rough unlike, for example the Surface pen which glides effortlessly across the screen. On the bight side though, you can stow this thing in the body and swap it out for another, higher quality wacom pen.When I purchased this tablet, it initially reminded me of a slightly larger Nexus 7, which, if you've never held one, is a good thing. However, if the more I used it the more problems and quality issues I noticed. First and foremost, the screen. The coating of the screen feels cheap compared to most other tablets. There is also a noticeable gap between the display and the glass covering it, which might bother some more than others, but makes it seem very cheap to me. The build quality is acceptable, but the resemblances to the Nexus 7 disappeared quickly when I really began to use it. It feels just a bit too light for my liking and a tad flimsy.I won't go into the specs of this little tablet, since they are nearly identical to most other 8-inch windows tablets around at the moment, so performance wise, this is nearly identical to others like the Dell Venue 8 and the Toshiba Encore. It runs admirably well for basic tasks like web browsing, watching videos, and even some gaming on less demanding games such as Minecraft on low settings, but anything heavier than that and you will notice serious slow downs. It is worth noting that this DOES NOT have hdmi support, while some of the other 8-inchers do with the right adapter.", "Title": "If Wacom support is not absolutely necessary, avoid this one.", "Date": "June 10, 2014"}, {"Author": "wolfiemom", "ReviewID": "R2Y5AL169QD5JO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is exactly what I've been waiting for, now if only there were more apps that allowed you to use the pen then i'd be completely happy.", "Title": "I love it", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Author": "snazzy", "ReviewID": "R19ODPYVRS1XAS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just the right size and weight.

I admit I was frustrated after a System Restore failed because of the timing of the update. I called ASUS, and the rep spent an hour on the phone with me. There was nothing that could be done other than a System Refresh, i.e., returning it to factory settings. As of this morning, I am re-registered and all that stuff, and am back to learning more of the capabilities of this computer.***I got this on March 27. The following review is before we got two more tablets (a long story), and the review reflects my inexperience with tablets. As of today - a month later - it's even more difficult to evaluate: 1. The ASUS can do more; it is a real computer, but 2. Android OS are much easier and a lot more fun. Ultimately, what happened was that my wife uses the ASUS for meetings and work, and I use the Galaxy for photography, music, and easing into retirement. They both have the one essential (for us) external storage.***(The March 27 review) I'm fairly new to tablets and Win 8, and nothing seemed to go right the first two days that I had this computer. Thanks to two other early reviewers, I found the stylus (it's part of the case), and learned some useful things about this \"mini-PC.\" That's exactly what it is, a PC with Windows 8. It's only a tablet in size. Note that I'm retired and have little use for a lot of the Win 8 or even ASUS apps, BUT my wife is still working and this will be taking the place of her first generation Kindle Fire ... and then some.My primary reason for getting this is that we wanted a decent sized screen to look at daily photographic shoots while on vacation. That's what we do, and my wife and I can shoot as many as 2,000 pictures a day. We don't want to edit although this Asus can do that, too, but we need at least a 20\" monitor or else we'd go blind.My one need was met after a good deal of difficulty setting up accounts with an extremely small font and a very large stylus (instead of the fantastic stylus it comes with).Pros: After you \"master\" Windows 8 - which is really Windows 7 with widgets and app icons galore. It's pretty easy once that becomes apparent, but without a guide, it does take some time. (I was working in a vacuum.)If you know Windows at all, you should like this OS. It gives you everything even a version of MS Office. The needed Office serial number is in the box. (I had to fish the brochure on Office out of the trash because it looked like an ad.)There is a mini-SDHC port, and since our cameras take the mini-SDHC Class 10 cards, we can pop the cards in this slot and watch them come up on the screen once we go to the external card in the Control Panel. Note: Though we both use P&S; cameras, the photos can be as large as 6-8MB each, and with several hundred, don't expect this tablet to display them as quickly as a a desktop quad core etc. etc. etc. I could put my entire (and that's a big \"entire\") music collection on a 64GB mini-card, and play music that way, but at least at home, I could hook up to Windows Media Player via Bluetooth and play my music anywhere I want without the card. (Small house.)With the supplied Wacom stylus, you can take notes, and it converts handwriting to print. That will come in handy when we're shooting pix in the open space or national parks.Briefly, you can darn near do anything a smart phone does except make calls and have internet access except with wi-fi, but it does more on an 8\" screen that any phone can today...I think.Cons: All the buttons and the stylus are the EXACT same color as the case. They are difficult to find visually. Adding the right case (and I think there may only be one for the Asus Vivo 8 at this time - see link below) really helps because the off/on, volume, and stylus are on the right and the holes give the indication you need as to the button location. That will make sense to you later.Though it has the mini card reader, and those cards now come with up to 128GB storage, I'd like to run more programs using the flash memory than from a card. Perhaps when I find out what I can uninstall, I'll free up enough on-board memory.The screen font is tiny, I mean 2-3 point font tiny. This is why I called Customer Service, and it was a question they couldn't answer, i.e., how to make the screen font bigger. One of the reviewers had the solution, but when I turned the computer on the next day, the font had reverted. We're still looking for an answer. Today, in the manual, we found the answer to making icons larger, but not fonts. Not after 10 days, anyway. (Make that 20 days now.)Some of you may want the selection, but there are so many apps and widget icons that it literally took hours to decide and delete the ones that we will probably never use. We are left with 34 apps and 32 ASUS and Windows widgets. The Windows Accessories and System widgets are of much more use or possible use, perhaps because I understand Windows stuff fairly well.The sign-up forms for ASUS and MS are also tiny and a pain in the neck. You really will need the Wacom stylus that comes with this to fill in the forms. But the Wacom stylus is very thin, doesn't point as well as one would expect when passing over some of the tiny icons (e.g., battery life, wifi status, and all the other things in the taskbar). There is another stylus that quite a few have recommended, but that adds $35 to your costs. The Wacom stylus does well enough for writing notes - short notes - and drawing if you can draw. Neither my wife nor I can draw a straight line, so this may be a moot point.The days after I signed up (without checking the \"getting notices\" box), I started getting email on my desktop PC. Not appreciated.Neither here no there: Just as when you shut down a \"regular\" PC, you have to sign back in (though you can simplify this with a PIN number and I think I saw a way to do away with signing it altogether). Further, Windows updates daily - HIGHLY recommended by me - and so start-up will take a minute or two especially if you haven't used the tablet for a few days. It's not as though I don't have plenty of time, but even in retirement 90 seconds to see a screen just seems like a long time.The screen is acceptable. It's not HD by any means, but since I don't watch movies on anything under 15 inches, this will suffice for YouTube and Wimp.NOTE: Use the manual that is on the tablet, not the downloadable .pdf one. The one on the computer has an icon.I highly recommend this case - which seems to be the only one for this NEW tablet (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOIGT7S/ref=pe_385040_30332190_TE_M3T1_ST1_dp_3) - and I'm listing it here because it's so darn hard to find on Amazon as of 3/29/14Three of these cons were sufficient for me to delete one star, but overall I am impressed.

I knew the tablet was supposed to come with a stylus, but I believed mine was missing since I had no idea where to find it.  It was only after searching the internet that I discovered it was stored in the tablet.  It can be a little difficult to remove, but I guess that's the price you pay for storing it securely.  The stylus is a little wonky but generally I like it--the only other stylus of any sort I have used is with my Kindle, which of course is a very different animal.Since I'm not used to touch screens I can't say whether this shows fingerprints more than another--but it DOES show them easily.  I tried a screen protector film but didn't care for it so I removed it.There are lots of features I put to the test when I traveled last week to another state:1) it was wonderful to read using the Kindle app on the plane.2) whenever I was near free Wi-Fi I could use Mapquest to route my trips for the day, then hit \"pint\" and simply keep the screen there with my routed trips.3) of course it was handy to read and delete my emails--although a couple of things were weird with that:-- I use gmail and I could not delete emails if I was not connected to Wi-Fi, which I don't understand since I can certainly do that on my iMac.-- no emails that I SENT from my tablet showed up in my Sent folder; need to try to figure out why4) I had lots of fun with the Alarms, although the first morning I didn't realize I must have set it and it chimed, making me wonder what was going on.  LOL  It's great that I can set several alarms (weekly and once) and have different sounds.  That app is awesome!5) The weather app is great, too--I set several cities where family live (as well as my own city) and it's cook to see the current weather conditions.6) I like the tiles and the fact that I can change the size and which tiles display on my home page.I found the Lock screen annoying so I disabled it now that I am home, but would probably use it when traveling.Sometimes I have to hit the start button several times to engage it.....????

Jacobs", "ReviewID": "R19PR6BJ4MB2BE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prior to receiving this tablet I had been using an ASUS netbook purchased in 2008 as my Internet machine.This gadget is a vast improvement.I'm not a great fan of the Windows 8 tile interface, but you don't really have to contend with that if you don't want to: just scroll down and you're looking at a nice easy-to-use list of program icons. The stylus takes a bit of getting used to, and utilizing the on-screen keypad is definitely going to slow down the typing speed of anyone accustomed to a regular keyboard, but the really nice wireless speed more than makes up for these disadvantages.Since I'm only going to be using the tablet for Internet browsing, I can't speak to some of the device's more mundane capabilities. I can say that based on its size alone, I would dread trying to work up a spreadsheet or PowerPoint presentation on it--but then I doubt that anyone would buy a tablet with that sort of purpose in mind. I like it better than the iPad I tried out once, for whatever that's worth. (Why should anyone have to log into at least two separate accounts just to browse the Web?)This is a good, sturdy little tablet that I'd recommend to anyone. I think you'll get your money's worth out of it.", "Title": "Good little tablet", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Author": "citygal", "ReviewID": "R2VQ60HMIFB9HL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "5/8/2014:  I'm updating the review from below because I recently tried to contact ASUS customer service to order a replacement adapter (my old one was thrown away by accident).  It took me about 40 minutes just to find out which adapter I wouuld need.  First, ASUS has no phone number that you can simply look up and phone them. Instead, if you click on \"Contact us\" on their web site, you will be directed to a form to input your personal information (name, address, etc. & serial #, model # of product).  Then, you're given three numbers to phone, depending on the type of product you have. Tablets are not listed, so it's a guess as to which number those who own tablets should phone. I guessed incorrectly, so I had to hang up and phone another number. I pressed all the right buttons (I thought), and I was connected . . . and then disconnected.  I phoned again, went through the litany of choices, and finally got a customer service rep.  After telling him my issue, he directed me to the ASUS web site to order the adapter. I told him that I had already tried that and did not know which adapter to order.  He then gave me the E-store phone number to call. I phoned them, and spoke to someone named Monica. She at first told me that they did not have the product but I could probably find it on Amazon. I told her I was on Amazon while speaking with her and wasn't sure which adapter to order. She put me on hold for about 5 minutes and then told me that their E-store did have it.  She gave me the part # to order it. By the way, the adapter is $40 on their e-store, with a minimum of $9 shipping--what a rip off! That adapter weighs next to nothing, yet their charging $9 shipping.  My first customer service experience (see my old review below) must have been a fluke.OLD REVIEW:  This is the first tablet I've ever owned, so you'll need to keep that in mind as you read this review.  It's fast, the screen is a nice size, and the stylus feature works great!  Also, I think it's worth mentioning that the first day, I had a few questions about registering my tablet with Asus, so I called them. The customer service rep was nice, and she answered my question within a few minutes. It means a lot to me that I can actually reach customer service (and I phoned about 10 p.m.) and get my question answered.", "Title": "Whatever you do: Don't lose the adapter to this thing", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Author": "tdell", "ReviewID": "R34EPQ2AH5IDBQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I tried this product with hopes it could be paired with the right accessories and replace laptop.

In the defense of this tablet, it has a lot of potential, especially for the computer savvy.That being said I wish I hadn't bought it, I didn't realize the return policy for electronics from amazon is only thirty days so keep that in mind when buying.When my screen times out, it already won't turn back on unless I power down and turn back on. The connectivity has been an issue but also my internet provider isn't the best so perchance you have top of the line, it might be less of an issue.It seems overall I constantly have to restart this thing just to get it to work, and have ended up using it mostly to stream media rather than all the nice features you're hoping to utilize in the over 400 dollar price tag.I now wish I would have just bought a kindle or other lower priced device because of how little I use it.Like I said though don't blame Asus too much, I'm just sore about not being able to return it and think this sort of purchase might have been wiser to make at Costco where they give you 90 days, I'm hoping maybe it's just operator error because I read so many good reviews on this thing that it seems like there is no way it should be running so poorly.I still wouldn't recommend it because I would hate for someone to have to deal with the same issues I've been having.", "Title": "don't blame asus too much", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Author": "Just Trying to Help", "ReviewID": "R9B7NBZBEFFJ0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It seems like the backspace and the \"b\" key go off frequently when using the stylus.

The stylus has a button on it and works really nicely, the button allows you to have a bit more control with the stylus.  Its a smart stylus, I guess.I think its a good value and I like the fact that you can do anything that a windows computer can do (or at least, I can).  I just can't stand the typing feature, and the backspace key \"going off\" when the stylus is 3 inches from the keyboard.
