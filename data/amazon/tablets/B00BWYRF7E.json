It is completely reliable, and the only thing wrong with it is it's low storage (only 8 GB).  I was very excited about this new fire HDX with 64 GB of memory.  The problem was, it completely crashed after only TWO days.  Would not turn on, would not reboot, nothing.  Was a completely blank paperweight.  I returned it and amazon sent me a replacement two day shipping.  The only problem with that one is that it has now crashed too.  The first crashed while I was watching it.  Now the second has either crashed, or won't recharge.  Worked fine until the battery died, then either wouldn't recharge, or it did recharge but won't turn on.  Another paperweight. Hopefully this third one will work right.  ***IMPORTANT NOTE*** For those of you who had the same problem, and cannot now download onto your new kindle because the content was on the old one that crashed, call Amazon Instant Video at 888-802-3080 and ask for TECH SUPPORT.  You are having this problem if you open a movie and the \"DOWNLOAD\" option is greyed out, and below it says \"WHY CAN'T I DOWNLOAD?\"  The problem is that since you downloaded a movie onto the kindle that crashed, your download has been used.  You can't download the same movie onto two different kindles at the same time.  In order to download onto your new kindle, you must first delete the download from the other.  A little hard to do when that kindle has crashed and you can't turn it on.  The folks at Amazon have no idea how to fix this, and in fact don't even know what you are talking about, but the guys at Amazon Instant Video tech support knew exactly how to fix it!  Hope this helps.", "Title": "Maybe the Third time's the charm. \"WHY CAN'T I DOWNLOAD\"", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Author": "KB", "ReviewID": "R1TPM5BTTH6BEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my Fire HDX as a birthday gift. This will be the third kindle in my household. I currently own a basic e-reader kindle and my fiance has the second generation kindle fire. Let me just say, this one blows all the rest completely out of the water. The display is sharp, the speakers are simply amazing, and the performance is outstanding for the price.Display:The display is crystal clear and is full HD. Just think about that for a second; it has the same resolution as any full size HDTV! On a 7in screen, it really shines. If you hold this side by side to an ipad mini, the display on the fire HDX wins hands down not only in resolution and color, but also clarity.Speakers:This is what impressed me the most about this tablet..... The speakers: Full Dolby HD that have great bass and a nice clear sound. These speakers are better than most laptop speakers. They go loud enough to fill a room and do not lose any of the sound quality.Performance:Performance (at least in my experience) is on par with the current generation ipads. My parents have an iPad and the fire HDX is just as responsive and snappy. No doubt this is due to the new chipset inside. Gone are the days of stutter, missed taps, and lagging swipes. The HDX even does multi-tasking (something that was missing of fire's and fire HD's of past).Battery:I've gotten all day use out of it. Based on my estimates, I will meet the time Amazon advertises, based on my daily usage of games, web browsing, and music. The fire HDX comes with a power cord!!! (Finally!!!). However, this power cord is just adequate. It's only a 5W charger instead of the 9W. As long as you don't need to use the HDX and charge it at the same time, the supplied charger is good. It takes almost all night to fully charge w/ the 5W included adapter. If you're a heavy tablet user, I'd buy the 9W charger.Mayday:This is the best feature of this tablet. It works just as you see on tv! I had an issue setting up part of my HDX. I hit the mayday button, and 10 seconds later I was chatting with a live person! I was shocked that it was exactly as you see on TV! This is perfect for anyone who is new to kindle, or to the world of tablets. I can see this being a definite benefit.Overall:The fire HDX is the best kindle to date. The performance is second to none, the display is great, the speakers are some of the best I've ever heard on a tablet, and the mayday feature is icing on the cake! I think the price is right on the mark for what you get. It's a great value tablet and a great performing tablet all in one.One note of caution:The charging port is on an angle and if you're not careful, I could see this being an issue down the line. If you try to lay the HDX screen side down, you will bend and put stress on the charging cable.", "Title": "Simply Amazing", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Author": "Kendall Giles", "ReviewID":

what's in the box:* Kindle Fire HDX 7\u2033 tablet computer* Micro USB charging cable* AC adapter* Quick-start guideMy Kindle powered up right away out of the box, and after entering password information for my firewall and a few other simple admin steps, I was online and ready to go.In fact, the Kindle Fire HDX immediately populated the Books, Videos, and Music tabs with items I had previously purchased on Amazon. All I had to do was tap the icon for the James Bond: The Authorised Biography, by John Pearson, or the album cover for the new Black Sabbath album 13 and, after a brief download, I was reading and rocking, respectively.Aside from the ease of getting online and using the device without a lot of hassle, I enjoyed several welcome features:* The Kindle felt good in the hand: the dimensions of the unit are 7.3\u2033 x 5.0\u2033 x .35\u2033, and at 303 grams in weight (lighter than the Apple iPad Mini 2), it was easy for me to hold with one hand.*  The display was absolutely brilliant: at 1920\u00d71200 pixels, the 7\u2033 screen clocks in at 323 Pixels Per Inch (PPI), which is up there with the best of the tablets. The text was crisp, the images gorgeous, and the videos seamless. As a writer and Computer Scientist, I'm accutely aware of technology getting in the way of what John Gardner calls the \"vivid and continuous dream\" enjoyed when immersed in a compelling story. This display, along with the quad-core CPU and user inteface supplied by the Kindle Fire OS 3.0 \"Mojito\", does not get in the way of what you are reading or seeing.* After a couple days use, I'm still using the device as I got it right from the box. The rated battery life is 11 hours of mixed use, and 17 hours when reading.* The dual Dolby audio stereo speakers crank out adequate volume, though the 3.5mm stereo headphone jack helps me really tune out the world when I'm listening to an audio book or movie or Black Sabbath.* The front-facing camera and built-in microphone are useful especially for Skype calls.* The unit's Bluetooth support and video streaming capabilities are helping me get in shape, since I can watch movies and crank the volume with an external Bluetooth speaker when running on a treadmill.* The unit came with lots of built-in apps that allowed me to be productive and entertained right out of the box, with more available on Amazon.Note that I haven't yet used the Mayday button, which is supposed to connect you, if you need help, to an Amazon expert 24\u00d77, but it's a nice feature to have in my back pocket.Also, I was already a Prime member, which gives me free 2-day shipping when shopping on Amazon, the ability to stream or download Prime Instant videos, and a free ebook a month, so the 30 days of free Prime membership with the purchase of the Kindle Fire HDX was lost on me, but I did start downloading some movies so that I can watch them offline for on an upcoming trip--being able to tune out your surroundings by diving into a movie is wonderful when stuck in those cramped airline seats.My video shows the unboxing and the Kindle Fire HDX in action.So to me, this tablet provides a big bang for your buck.", "Title": "Big bang for your buck", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "Jeanne D Day", "ReviewID": "R33FG0IPX75104", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This kindle fire HDX has not held a charge since it arrived early December.

Ricucci", "ReviewID": "R1DBW18TQ7Z7ED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 11 days of using the Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB -- and now editing slightly thanks to a couple of helpful Amazoners:What I LIKE about the HDX:- Slim, light, more mobile & easier to handle than the Fire HD which was heavy/unwieldy for my arthritic hands- Gorgeous display, crisp and beautiful- Easy setup, very simple even for a senior lady like me- This model includes a charger. Yay!! (The Fire HD did not come with a charger.)- Responds quickly, very intuitive- Email program is great, nicely laid out & easy to set up all my accounts -- my Mac account, my MS Exchange work account, my Gmail accounts- As an Amazon Prime member, I have a huge selection of movies, TV & music available at no additional cost- It's just a smooth operation, does what I want it to do simply and very quicklyWhat I DON'T LIKE about the HDX:- No way to know when device is fully charged; no green light as on other Kindles; you have to turn it on and unlock to see whether it's fully charged- Speakers on the back means you have to be careful and aware of which way you're holding the device so your hand isn't covering one of the speakers; I don't think the placement is all that great.- The micro USB port at the bottom, where you plug in the charger, is at an odd angle. Often when I go to charge the device, it takes me a couple of tries to get the plug into the port. Seems strange, something which could have been done better.I really like the Fire HDX, much better than the Fire HD and I know I will very much enjoy it. As an all-around device for music, videos, email, web browsing, games, keeping up with news/weather/sports on-the-go, etc., I can definitely recommend the HDX. It's not perfect (does anyone know a device which is?) but if the HDX does what you need, you will love it!UPDATE on 12/5/13 -- I've now had the device for about 6 weeks and am using it heavily, much more than my previous Kindle. It keeps surprising me in terms of the things it will do and the way it fits into my work & leisure needs. I don't know if I just got lucky, but I swear there is no blue haze on my screen. BOTTOM LINE: I'm very happy with the HDX. Now if I could just discipline myself to put it down....", "Title": "Very pleased!", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "RBHK0EOJ7QRS5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live in the Amazon Ecosystem.  I buy my movies from Amazon Instant Video, I pay for the Cloud Music service, and I've been a Kindle reader since the first generation.  I've had iPads, Nexus and Surface tablets, and while they offer most of the Amazon services through various Apps, none are as cohesive as the Kindle Fire.  I was hesitant to upgrade to this years model, as I absolutely loved the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 last year, but I wanted a smaller tablet, and the specs this time around were rather impressive.The first thing I noticed about the Kindle Fire HDX was not the screen (although it is rather impressive), but the weight.  Make no mistake, this tablet is thin, and this tablet is light.  It makes movie watching and reading a pleasure, even one handed for a long period of time.The screen - a nice upgrade over last years model, it's bright, vivid and the text is crisp, which is helpful, especially for reading.  I did not notice any blue hue that some people complain about.The sound - I didn't notice a huge quality difference over last year (and I liked last year's), but moving the speakers to the top of the device and slanting them makes a huge difference, especially since I hold my tablet and the bottom and would constantly cover last years.Speed - I noticed a huge speed increase over last years model.  The interface is fast and fluid, and I have not noticed any slow down so far.What I don't like, or what they could improve upon:Rear facing camera - I was hoping the 7\" model would have one like the 8.9, but not so.  I use my tablet for Skype so the grandparents can see their 2 year old grandchild, and it's much easier to use the rear camera to chase her around the room, so I was a little bummed about that.  Hopefully next year.HDMI out - I was disappointed to see it didn't make it into this years model.  I travel quite a bit, so it was nice to hook the Kindle Fire up to the Hotel's TV and relax at night.  I bought the NETGEAR PTV3000 to use the Miracast Feature, but it would have been nice to use the cable I already had.Apps - It has most of the ones I'd want on a tablet, but access to Google Play would be nice (without rooting)Long story short (too late), if you live in the Amazon Ecosystem, this is a great tablet, especially for the price.", "Title": "Great Tablet For the Amazon Ecosystem", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Author": "HK", "ReviewID": "R2S0EAN0Y6ZSPX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my fifth kindle.  I have also owned the original kindle fire and loved it til it suddenly stopped charging- even after I was very careful in taking care of it and did not use it extensively.  Kindle support informed me that some of the original kindles had this issue.  When I heard the new kindle fire hdx was coming out I had high hopes that Amazon would have solved the issue of the battery port giving out prematurely, but within a month of receiving it, I started experiencing the same issue on my new kindle fire hdx!  Sometimes it would charge, other times it wouldn't.  I was so disappointed in this similar repeat of history, I decided that I would simply return it for a refund and not risk more money wasted, so I put it aside and stopped using it.  My biggest mistake was waiting for the hustle of the busy holidays to pass before calling Amazon thinking Amazon is so great with returns, another few weeks shouldn't be an issue!  My other mistake was not realizing the interpretation of their one year warranty was completely up to the whim of their representatives.  Their one year limited warranty states as some options, that a new device may be given as a replacement, and also that refunds may be given- and does not state when or when not.  I fully trusted that Amazon would come through for one of their loyal prime customers; I mean we've all read about Amazon's great customer service in the past and in others' reviews!  However, my New Year has now been completely soured by my latest experience with Amazon, and I will never view Amazon nor it's kindle products the same ever again.  On New Year's Day I called and asked for a refund because this had been my second experience with kindle fires having charging/ battery port issues, and it happening again to such a new product that had just came out- I didn't want an exchange until I was sure this would not happen again.  They refused me a refund because my thirty days had passed.  In the end after several more requests for a refund, I settled for an exchange of a product I no longer trusted in.  The order invoice said a new kindle hdx was on its way, and I was willing to give it a second try because what other option did I have?  I packed up my new condition kindle with its power charger and the original box- thinking what a shame- still brand new if it wasn't for the charging issue, and dropped it off at UPS.  Today the replacement arrived.  I was so disappointed and shocked to open the amazon box and find no packaging at all including, no original kindle box, and just a refurbished kindle without even a charger- just a dusty cord!!  I had sent everything that came with my kindle in its still new box back to Amazon!  Not only had I received a refurbished kindle as opposed to a new one when I had only owned my new generation kindle hdx for a little over two months (I received it at the end of October), but now I felt like I got an even shabbier deal because Amazon didn't even have the decency to  package my replacement in its original box with a fully working charger!  When I called customer service I was upset for the above reasons, and one of the kindle support reps spoke to me in a very patronizing tone and yelled at me and threatened to stop helping me if I continued to be upset.  The biggest reason for my upset and frustration was because I had really trusted that Amazon would be reasonable and willing to work with me and help me out.  Every time I was put on hold was a ten to twenty plus minutes wait and in the end, the \"higher ups\" were also completely unwilling to help me - still no refund or no promise of a new kindle, just \"a repeat of \"no we can't\" , \"no we can't\"... \"We can't issue a refund\"even though if I had received the new kindle just even a little later when it was expected to ship out, I may have qualified for the extended holiday return policy that starts with November shipments. The patronizing agent told me it was my fault for not reading the whole email sent with the label which would have told me to keep all of the accessories and only send the device- why would I keep the accessories when I thought I was getting a new replacement?!  And how is that ethical to keep part of the product? When I went back to my original email later, I did not see any small print about keeping the box and all the accessories, though I did fimd on the amazon website that it is not necessary to send in the charger or manual.  I would still think a refurbished electronic device would come paired with a charger if it was originally offered with the device?!  The friendlier agent I spoke with on New Year's promised that Amazon always takes care of its customers, so don't worry- if I have further issues with the replacement to just call back.  At that time, I ended the call still agreeing with him about Amazon looking out for its customers.  And even on that day, I had called - expecting a full refund, and though not getting it, believed Amazon would at least replace a two month old bestselling device with a new product for a very disappointed customer.  However, today after an hour long run around and dismissals and no one willing to truly work with me, I am no longer a fan of Amazon.  It's too bad because I used to rave about Amazon and kindles and what I believed was true about Amazon customer service being one of the best out there.  When customer service stops coming through for you or the company stops caring about its individual customers, it's time to stop believing in its products.", "Title": "No Longer A Huge Fan of Amazon Nor Kindles", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Author": "BarbZ", "ReviewID": "R2ROLCJAJ0O1C7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This device is a breathtaking movie watching device, but falls short in other areas.  Some will feel like \"nits,\" but I wanted to mention them, since they were surprising to me, and they are things you should know:Screen:  Gorgeous.  Movies are breathtaking, full of depth.Movie watching:  While watching a movie (streaming or downloaded), you can tap the screen, hold the progress bar, and scroll forward/backward in the film with a preview screen which shows you exactly where you'll land when you release your touch on the screen.  Great!  XRay for movies is also a nice feature, and in some cases, gives you \"goofs\", so you can check out the filming mistakes on your own!Sound: Incredible.  For movie viewing, this is really like having a mini theater in your lap.  I stand the device in an old Kindle Fire cover so that the sound is projected towards the front by the folded back cover.  It feels like you are in a theater.  This is the first device I've ever used (been satisfied with the sound) without headphones, and if you aim the sound toward you, it's stunning.  I've watched about four films, and I wouldn't think of using headphones with this device.Mayday: Great feature.  I used it twice.  I had an agent available in less than a minute, and they stuck with me until the issues were resolved.Setup/Glitches: I had one hang up/reboot.  Your device will do a software update while booting for the first time, which takes at least 10 minutes.  Note:  I have some video enhanced Kindle books.  They would not run on this device, however, they ran on my older Kindle Fire, hence one of my calls to Mayday.  I expect there will be some inconsistency in older/newer generation devices with some materials.Storage:  16G is really 10.6G, so expect it to go quickly.  I would order the 32G if I were ordering again.Downloads:  A nice feature.  I downloaded a couple of short television episodes in order to test this.  The downloads took longer than expected, however, based on my service and typical download times.Why I didn't give it five stars:The high definition of the device makes some text and images too small to see/read, so this is not a viable web browsing device for me.Integration/Intrusion: Great for Amazon, not so great for the user/device owner.  I'm very disappointed in one thing: When you download a book sample and try to read it, there is a yellow button in the bottom third of the screen that says:  Buy Now.  When you purchase a book, a bar/box appears across the bottom third of the screen (when reading) asking you to try the audiobook (similar button)...and the audiobook sample is already downloaded to your device!  This is:  1. very intrusive to the reading experience.  The bar/box blocks a portion of the book's text (the bottom third of the page).  You have to tap the screen to remove it.  Also, if each time you download a book, you are downloading an Audible sample, this is simply a sales tactic at the expense of unnecessary bloat to the storage on your device.  This is really disappointing from a company that understands exactly what the purity of a reading device should be. I find these sales pitches in the middle of my reading experience to be annoying!Reading:  Not great on this device.  There is a purplish border around the screen when reading which I find fatigues my eyes.  I read easily on my iPad, Kindle Fire Gen 2, even the new Paperwhite.  This will not be my first choice for a reading device.Form factor:  Very nice, and easy to hold, except for one thing:  the micro USB plug is at an angle to the device.  It is very difficult to insert the plug on my device, and also difficult to remove.  I'm not sure about the viability of that connector in light of the force needed to insert and remove it.No Battery Indicator light:  This may seem like a small thing, but I find it very annoying.  When you plug in the device, there is no indicator light to tell you when the battery is charged.  I couldn't believe it!  In order to know if the device is charged, you have to turn on the device, and check the screen.  I called Mayday to confirm this, since I simply thought I was missing it.  Now when I plug the device in, I check to see when the plug loses its heat to know that it's charged.  Seems ridiculous to me.Overall:It really depends on what you want to use this device for.  As a pure movie absorbing device, it's 6 stars!I recommend ordering with more memory.  I was going to order the Kindle Fire HD with 16G of storage.  Then, I realized that the price difference after upgrading the memory in the low end device was only $60 to the 7 inch HDX with 16G, so I decided to go with it, in light of the many other differences in the specs.  I think that was the right decision, but I don't expect the memory to go very far in light of the other issues I've mentioned.I need to do more reading, and check the device connector, and keep an eye on the memory before deciding whether or not to keep the device.  I'll update this review, as I learn more.Enjoy!", "Title": "Gorgeous device, but some things you should know....", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "Pavic", "ReviewID": "R2OIC7C543S2IZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you Amazon for another wonderful product, it came right on time for me!I'm an avid reader, so when someone stole my Kindle Fire three weeks ago, it was as if a good friend was taken away from me. Kindle was already a part of my life, it made the books and therefore my contact with the English language (which is not my mother tongue) easier for me. Since I had so much personal content on it, I felt as if someone invaded my private life and totally messed up my little daily rituals.Although I reported it to the police and had Amazon freeze my old device for me (I can't thank them enough for their promptness), it did not turn up, so my husband and I decided to buy this new one. It has just arrived today, but from what I've seen so far this one is much, much better.My first impulse was to look at the books (by the way, it came with the majority of the books on my account already installed, which is again something I am thankful to Amazon for) and the screen seems better than the old one. To be honest, that was my main concern - I was a bit nervous as I knew it was smaller than my old Kindle Fire, but it turned out ok. I even went outside and read with the sunset reflecting on my screen and everything was easily readable.The second thing that I noticed about it was the speed - not only it's much faster and I downloaded all my music and some of my videos in a heart bit, but I'm also extremely happy that my Jillian Michaels exercise routines are downloadable and can be played off-line - now I will be less upset when our Internet company schedules their maintenance!The sound, as far as I'm concerned, is clear too, and I don't mind the way they put their off and on and volume buttons in the back - I got accustomed to them very quick.I also like the fact that the device is now compatible with Youtube videos, that used to be a constant source of frustration for me on the old one. Back then having a kindle seemed to me like setting your priorities - I wanted to choose my books over the youtube content, and I had to deal with not being able to play many other things. Now I don't have to make that choice anymore; this kindle incorporates the amazing Amazon reader and a tablet. That is very nice and I don't think there's anything similar on the market at the price!I haven't tried the apps or the games enough to comment on them, but I will update my review if I find it necessary. Maybe I'll find something negative to say, although that's very unlikely :PIn other words, thank you Amazon, I love my new device! I'm glad in a way that I had a reason to buy this one right off after it came out!Update 10.25.13: It's been two days since I got the Kindle and I'm still perfectly content with it. I've seen people around complaining about the blue / purple haze around its border - in all honesty, I had to read their reviews to realize it's there. And now that I see it, I think it really gives more depth to the screen. It doesn't impede my reading at all, on the contrary...I've also downloaded some of their games and apps and everything runs smoothly.I even used the Mayday button once; as I expected the Amazon specialist was impeccable in their reply and helped me immediately. However, the Kindle is so easy to use that there's almost no need for Mayday :)I still think this is the best device you can get out there for the price. Go for it and you won't regret it!Update: 11.06.2013 While trying to Skype on the new Kindle, I found out that this one is a little too sensitive to movement compared to the previous model. Every time I moved the camera it would make a clicky sound and the image would freeze. Somehow I have the feeling that the way it receives the Internet signal is slower or something of the sort. The former Kindle seemed a little better with that I didn't have any problems moving the camera while talking on Skype.", "Title": "love it!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Author": "Travel Fan", "ReviewID": "R2KDJ0C1SL0DHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a chance to enjoy my new Kindle HDX 64GB, Wi-Fi only for a few days now. The packaging was great and worry free. I could tell that Amazon took care to make sure that my new toy would arrive safely. My first Kindle was a keyboard kindle which I loved. However, when the previous generation HD came out, I could not resist the call to enjoy color again. I had missed seeing my book covers/pictures in color. I loved all the HD had to offer, the games, internet browsing and being able to check my email while on travel. It was a great little device, but alas, when the HDX came out, it just had a little more of what I was looking for. I bought it for the lighter weight, the extended battery life, higher resolution, etc.. the same reasons everyone else bought one. I traded in my HD with Amazon and this is where I have to praise Amazon for their excellent customer service. My mother had also asked me to trade in her HD along with mine, so we sent them in one package. We followed instructions, submitted the trade in and waited patiently. After two weeks, I could see that they had received the package, but nothing was happening. After contacting Amazon, they responded within the hour and discovered that apparently our items had somehow been lost. At any rate, they could see that they had been delivered and gave us an immediate provisional credit. Later, they did find one of the devices, but to make things right, they gave an additional credit for that item on top of letting us keep the full provisional credit for both devices. Now that is superior customer service! Hard to find that anymore. They were prompt, courteous, and resolved our issue (and I dealt with three different customer service reps). Anyway, on to the HDX. This is a spectacular little device. It is much lighter, more compact and easier to hold than my HD was. It is also quite a bit faster, whether checking email or browsing. I also enjoy my reading experience. Of course I have to mention the blue haze issue. After reading previous reviews, I have to admit that I was a little concerned. However, I need not have worried. It is a non issue to me personally, I had to look really hard to see it and I find that it is actually easier on my eyes than a stark white page. I do not see it at all when browsing or checking email. I have downloaded some music and find the sound quality to be at least as good as what I experienced on my previous gen HD. I can't wait to view my newly purchased HD LOTR trilogy on this device as the screen so far has been highly impressive. I also decided to purchase the HDX with 64 GB as I found that the 16GB in my previous device just wasn't enough to accommodate the downloading of several movies for when I travel. I would highly recommend the higher storage capacity for anyone who is wanting to download movies, especially those of HD quality. Also, I have used the charging port several times and have not been bothered with the angle at all. In fact, because of the angle, I have found it easier to plug in than with my last device because I had to hold that one exactly level in order for me to be able to insert the cord. I have only one more thing to say about the HDX and other Kindle tablets. They are not IPads, nor will they ever be IPads. If I had wanted a tablet with the features of an IPad, I would have bought an IPad. Thank goodness I do not want that, which means I can get everything I want for a lot less money than I would have had to spend on an IPad. I have more money to spend on stuff to put on my Kindle. This puts a smile on my face. Kindles are in a category all their own and I love them! Thanks Amazon---------------------------------------------------------Jan 26, 2014I would like to modify my previous review a bit. After using this device for a while, I still love it. However I have noticed considerable eyestrain when reading a book without a lamp at night. My eyes would burn and water. Since then, I have purchased a Paperwhite and have no more problems. So now I use my Paperwhite for reading, it is lighter weight anyway which is better for that purpose, and my HDX for everything else. When I travel though I will still just take my HDX for simplicity and the sync feature makes it easy to continue reading where I left off on my Paperwhite. I still consider both devices to be a good investment.", "Title": "Sublime!", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Author": "Rita", "ReviewID": "R1IWS6AOYTRZS8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I want to say that I was 4 star happy with my Kindle Fire HD 7\" and have been just as happy or happier with past Kindles.  The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" will be the fifth one for me and my family.I find that the HDX is a good upgrade from the HD.  I haven't found anything yet that would make me want to return it.  There was 60% battery out of the box and for me, setup was a snap.  The HDX connected to my account, downloaded all the info, upgraded and came back up in about 5 minutes.  The hardest part was opening the box.I was very happy to see the charger when I opened the box and not just the wire.  I really hate to buy the extra charging plug.  The one that comes in the box is a smaller charger than the square one Amazon sells.  I don't know all the specs, but I assume it charges slower, but has to be faster than charging through the computer.  I haven't had to recharge completely yet so I don't know how long it will take.  But I am assuming it won't be any longer than with the HD.  I found that so far the power usage is about the same at the HD.  I was on it for several hours last night and used about 15% without running video.  That was setup, book downloading and cruising the features and some internet just to see how the screen looks and check out loading times.  The charging wire does stick out from the kindle at greater than 90 degrees, so one will have to be careful when plugging it in and removing the plug.  Also, you wouldn't want to lay the kindle on it's face when charging, the plug will get in the way.The screen resolution is fantastic. The sound is very good for such small speakers and I haven't seen any buffering with the videos.  Although the cloud did have all of my books, the cloud didn't seem to know which books were still on my HD. The only books on the HDX when it arrived were the ones I purchased since I put in my order for the HDX.  When I set up it pulled in the cloud but not the unread books on the HD.  So, I had to run through the HD and download the books I haven't read yet from the cloud to the HDX. The speed is faster than the HD, although not remarkably faster.  It is lighter than the HD which is good for me because I have arthritic hands and can't hold a book. So far the best one from that standpoint was the Touch.Many have complained about the bluish/purple light around the boarder on white pages.  I would not have noticed it if it hadn't been mentioned in the reviews.  It doesn't distract from my reading (and I read a lot), doesn't cause me any eye strain, and I forget it is even there. People complaining because Amazon is trying to put a positive spin on this are na\u00efve.  All companies are going to try and give their products the best spin.  It is up to the customer to like it or not.  Return it if you don't like it.I am happy for the mayday button, but I haven't had a chance to use it yet.  I don't want to contact someone just to say hi.  But I am sure I would use it in a heartbeat if I needed to.  I have never had a problem with phoning tech help, even if it is in India. The user guide was pretty easy to find and I am going through it tonight to see if there is anything I haven't figured out yet.The origami cover isn't really great and hugely overpriced.  It's a little floppy when opening it but the magnets put it tight when you  flip it to the back for handheld reading.  I do like the way it feels, and the magnets that hold everything together and creates the stand are solid.  The kindle is held in the case securely, although it looks like it might fall right out, it won't.  The cover doesn't block the speakers, but seem to enhance the sound by holding the kindle slightly away from the back cover and aiming the sound at you in landscape.  When I stand the kindle in landscape it wiggles a little when I swipe or tape to change pages and seems as if it wants to fall over.  It hasn't yet, but it doesn't seem very stable. The worst is when I stand it in portrait.  The kindle turns itself off and restarts repeatedly.  I don't know if it is the cover on button thingy hitting the table or if the new location of the on button on the kindle itself is poorly thought out.  The on button isn't in the way no matter which way I hold the kindle, it is only a problem when it stands in portrait.  Maybe another cover would work better.  I am going to wait to see what other hard cover is created by other makers.So, I am happy with my purchase and I am glad I upgraded.  I don't use my kindle for more than reading, email, facebook, twitter, and the internet, but I am looking forward to the software upgrade in November.  I am curious to see what kind of business items will appear.  I wish Amazon would notify kindle owners when a new update is available or make it possible to update software automatically when one connects to Kindle.UPDATE 11/3/13 - I am happier than ever with the HDX.  I am experiencing a weird thing with it though.  It may be the Origami cover that is causing this, but 4 times now in the last week the HDX has decided to just restart all by itself.  When it does, it doesn't save a book where I am reading.  I have to hunt for the page I was on.", "Title": "Kindle HDX 7\" Wifi 32 GB", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Author": "Debra Ann Fescina", "ReviewID": "R199IHRUR3XORN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Found the following on the 1-star reviews:  \"From somebody that has owned both products, I was never happier to sell my kindle fire on Craigslist.

Save yourself the trouble and go straight to the apple store.\" Again, I couldn't agree more.I purchased FOUR Kindle fires last year for grandkids for Christmas.  I have two of them in my home right now that will not charge AT ALL.  The other two, I am waiting to hear from my other grandkids to see if they are having any similar issues.  I have spoken with three representatives from Amazon, and I am hearing the same thing from all of them:  They would be happy to sell me 2 replacement Kindles .. it is the best that they can do.Amazon needs to put into place a remedy for people other than what is written in black and white.  The fact that your people, one who is supposedly a supervisor, cannot stray from the rules and make an exception to a customer who purchased FOUR Kindles and now has TWO not charging at not quite 13 months later is amazing.  There SHOULD be some sort of empowerment to Amazon employees, especially supervisors, to make decisions that are fair to Amazon's customers.  I asked if I could get an exception to the 30 days past warranty; and when told \"NO\" I asked if I could get a discount from the normal $79 replacement cost since I would have to purchase TWO refurbished Kindles.  Again, I was told \"NO\".  At a minimum, Amazon should replace the battery at a REASONABLE cost.  However, that offer was not on the table.Apple, Nook, Nintendo, Bose, Dell, HP.  I have them all (I have a hand-held Nintendo that is literally more than 15 years old - it still works!).  I have never had a product quit working at 13 months ... the only thing close to this is an iPod that only works while on the charger but it is FIVE years old AND it does still work while on the charger!

I now prefer using my HDX over my HD model most of the time.  The performance  is way more solid than my HD.  I still use my HD for my missing Weather app  WeatherBug...and the older version of AccuWeather.  The HD and HDX clearly  use different stores.  I got notes back from app developers....no estimate  of when these apps will be in the HDX store.  Does anyone really care?2.  A new minor app issue for my ESPN scoreboard which nobody wants to address.  The standings font for the stats is too large and overlays the city names  such that NFL Won and Loss numbers overlay the city names.  Very annoying.  Does anyone ever test these new/modified HDX apps?3.  Battery life.  As noted below....it is directly proportional to the brightness  setting.  If you want to conserve your battery life...turn the brightness bar  down to 70-80% of the bar length....to get at least 2 more hours out of your  battery.4.  No HD solid black matrix...more dark grey on the HDX.  I guess I am getting use  to this change.  Still like the black LEDs better.  I also don't notice the  blue edges as much on white screens when I am reading.  With time, we can all  get use to just about anything.5.  I did get the HDX Marware screen protectors.....a must accessory...although way  too expensive.  $14.99 + tax on prime for just 2 plastic sheets.**********************************************************************************First, let me say I really like my Kindle(s), but for those who are consideringan upgrade, I will post my quick review to help you decide if now is the timeto make an upgrade or not, and whether to keep your HD around for certain apps.I am still testing out my new HDX and will update this review as I discover moreabout it.  Normally, I wait a few months before I buy an upgrade for any pieceof hardware, but this time I pulled the trigger early on 11/4 to take advantageof the extra 1 day 15% discount which Bezos gave us for the FAA ruling on wireless devices.

Great price performance (Cheaper and Faster)2. Size and weight (Smaller and lighter footprint for jacket pockets)3. Origami case is ok with fixed magnetic angles but not adjustable4. Mayday Help (Excellent) - Fast response but some advisors are still  learning and some are not familiar with HDs and need 2nd level help.5. Apps and movies seem to be running much smoother with fewer freezes than  HD model.HDX vs HD CON:1. Most disappointing:  Screen background matrix is not a black matrix like theHD...more of a very dark grey with lighter gray spotlight in the middle of the display and shadowing of icons and other objects.  HDX screen seem less sharp than HD despite higher resolution when viewed side by side.  I tried all positions of the brightness bar and turned auto feature on and off with no improvement.  There is no contrast control either per my chat with the Mayday folks.2. Others are correct on the white screen blue edge lines on the bottom and rightside of screens.  The HD would probably be a better choice for those who readmore on their Kindles white screens. I did not notice blue line edge problems for movies and pictures. Choice of the blue LEDs for the HDX might explain this problem and the \"dark gray background\" matrix on the carousel screen.  I am surprised there was apparently not more human factors testing on this model before this release.3. The standard font size for the HDX seems 1 or 2 points smaller for more text than the HD. An issue for older reading glasses users.  Portrait viewing will help this a little.4. I don't like the non-carousel device app icons to be half-way visible at the bottom of my HDX.  There is no * (star) feature on this operating system to hide the apps you don't want visible on your carousel.5. Not all HD apps you have now are available on the HDX.  I am not sure if the Kindle \"Store\" is the same store for the HD and the HDX.  If so, they have a problem.  A good example is one of my favorite free Weather Apps, WeatherBug, which has the blue ladybug icon with rain and snow symbols on shell.  The HDX store says it's there and you try to find this icon in the store and all you get are apps the look or are spelled like it but not the real WeatherBug app.  Meantime the HD Kindle \"Store\" has the real one...and I use it on my HD all the time.  When I called the Mayday folks...they said it probably is still not available for the HDX.  If so, then why does the HDX app store search say it is there???  Another free app, AccuWeather, is there in the store, but has a totally different look andfeel, on the HDX. I still like the HD version better.6. Still no .AVI .MOV or .MVI support for movies, only .MP4.  I had to get a desktop converter software for all my Canon camera movies. (ArcSoft Media Converter 2 is a good one)7. Miss the HDMI port on the HDX.  May use the HD for playback of movies on my HDTVs.  Not sure how fast the wireless \"Mirror\" display will be on the HDX...or if I will have \"Miracast\" compatibility. Seems like the hardwire cable would be faster.8. Battery discharge seems to be faster than the HD for same apps...may be underpowered for the higher screen resolution.  Might require lower brightness setting to conserve battery reserves. Requires additional benchmarking.Final Analysis:I'm sure many of the early \"bugs\" will be worked out of the HDX before the holidays and many of the \"missing apps\" will show up at some point.  I will probably keep my HDX to keep testing and benchmarking it against my HD.  I will not get rid of my HD until I see the improvements on the Con side addressed here and I would advise the current HD users to do the same.  Even if this generation proves to be a disappointment, there is still a lot to like about this one for a new tablet owner.", "Title": "HD to HDX Upgrade - Initial Impressions Good and Bad", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "Sara Karolina", "ReviewID": "RJELLQHFEYV6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this Kindle Fire. You can read, surf the net (let me just suggest downloading the Dolphin browser, since the Silk browser it comes with isn't that great). And that blue LED light on the side that everyone is complaining about isn't actually flawed, it was a design decision based on lower LED battery using power. The blue LED lights used less power than the white, so they went with the blue. Honestly, it doesn't bother me and I don't really understand what the big deal about it is. You definitely notice it, but more so if you are reading a book but still, it doesn't even matter. The clarity of the screen is amazing. I highly recommend going with the 64 GB, that's what I got. I already have a ton of apps on there and am watching tv shows and movies and barely have any memory used up. I also got the Amazon origami magnetic case for my Kindle Fire, and it's also really good quality. I saw that most reviewers didn't like the fact that the charging spot for the Kindle Fire is at an angle. I actually like it because it doesn't get in the way of anything when it's laying down. The headphone spot is also at an angle and I don't mind that either. I think overall the design is awesome.

Size & weight,,,,, lighter and thinner than the ipad mini,,, perfect size to handle. I like the location of the on/off button and volume, much better than my sons HD I dont like to search for buttons on the side.2. Speed, its seems REALLY fast, book pages are in a blink of an eye  & the web loaded fast not choppy or drag, my wifi is pretty good so it helps. I have not tried the 4 G yet so I cant comment on that.3. Screen WOW its really sharp almost as good as my Samsung 55 in LCD 1080,,,,yes darling it is that sharp.4. Did I mention there is no blue or purple gold green or rainbow light around the border !!!!!!! & if there is it is so light I cant notice it. I only used it for an hour or so last night so I will update if this changes but for now it looked clean.5. Apps,,,hmm I hear a lot of people b*tching about google this or google that,,,,WHO CARES,,there is enough content on Amazon to keep me happy & not that I am a betting man I will bet there is a bunch more in the pipe line.6. I maxed the Kindle out with 64 gb  so I assume i will have enough room for years to come.7. Very easy to use,,,,,turned it on entered my wifi password and bam my account was set up in less than 1 minute.8. Shipping it was here in 1 day for 3.99 how can you beat that ?9. Amazon eco-system good stuff period I have always been a huge fan !10. Did I mention there is no blue or purple border light :)11. So to sum up my thoughts on my new Kindle HDX is this,, OUTSTANDING & I would recommend buying it over an I PAD for PRICE (value) the I PAD mini does not offer a 64 gb model and the 16 gb 4g mini cost  $429 which is 5 bucks more than I paid for my maxed out Kindle AND the 64 gb 4g I PAD air is $ 829 !!!!!! Yea thats right $ 829 !!!!!! LOOKS the Kindle is a really sharp looking device, speed fast fast fast, screen WOW, sound clear & rich amazon prime works for me, I hate shopping in stores love my books and amazon has it all.So your prob saying wow this is a normal dude posting a review that says this thing is pretty much perfect, well it does seem this way BUT,,,,,,,,,yea there is always a BUT, the only thing i see that should be included is a back facing camera not that I am one of those parents you see waving their IPAD around at a school play or my kids basketball game but sometimes your 5 year old does something so cute while your reading a book you just want to snap the pic, this is so minor that I really dont care but just putting it out there for Amazon ( cough cough ) .Did I mention I did NOT have a blue or purple light around the border !!!!Thanks for letting me post my 2 cents on this wonderful device & Merry Christmas to all !!!!!! ;)ps what is the best screen covers & case to get ???On a side note I returned the Kindle it to small for me and I had to drop it down to a 2 stars for being hung up on by customer service twice and the really bad screen flicker !!!!", "Title": "**Edit Bad screen flicker REALLY BAD Customer Service RETURNED !", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Author": "alana", "ReviewID": "R13VX6O3LRMI2G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really wanted to love this tablet.  I love the variety and price of books available in the Kindle store, so I thought I would step out of my Apple cocoon and try a Kindle Fire for an e-reader.  I was so excited, but within 1 HOUR of owning the Kindle HDX, I quickly became really, REALLY bummed with it and decided to return it right away.  For the price, you would think you would get a decent quality tablet, but there were some major red flags right away.I will start with the GOOD news first (and the only reason why I give this item 1 star):- The MayDay feature is amazing.  GREAT job by Amazon on this one!  The tech supporters were friendly, helpful, and excellent with customer service.  I used this feature a couple times, and each time a tech person responded in about 10 seconds.  Obviously, as more Kindle HDXs are sold, and the tech department gets busier, they will be slower in their response time, but that's fine!  It's such a great feature, that it's worth waiting 20 min for.  Even though I was ultimately disappointed with the Kindle HDX, I was really impressed with the tech support available.  This is one major feature missing from Apple.Now, for the BAD news:- Froze 3 times on me in about ONE hour.  That's ridiculous.  I didn't download anything on there except for a couple books, so there's no real reason for the damn device to keep freezing on me.  That's the biggest red flag for me with this device.  One hour in, and the damn thing keeps freezing, so I can imagine how much worse it's going to get as the device gets older and I download more things.- Kept getting error messages when the device would automatically update after turning it on.  First of all, I don't want it to automatically update when I turn it on, but I guess there's no way around it.  And to top it off, brand new and it's not even updating correctly?  C'mon Amazon!- Apps wouldn't come up correctly after it froze and turned back on.  So after the device kept freezing and I turned it back on (3 times), on the main page where you can see the big books, apps, etc... that you can scroll through, the pictures of the apps wouldn't show up.  It just came up as gray boxes with the Amazon \"box\" logo on it.  Again, I shouldn't be having these type of basic loading issues one hour after opening the box.- There is NO WAY to create \"collections\" in your books library.  Say what???  I've been reading my Kindle books on my iPhone through the Kindle App, and I'm able to organize my books into collections.  But the Kindle Fire doesn't allow me to do this?  This is the most asinine thing I've ever come across!  You'd think that you'd get more features through a Kindle Fire than you would on the Kindle App for a different company's device.  Using MayDay, I talked to a tech who confirmed that yes, you can't organize your collection on the Kindle Fire, but that there were other third party apps that let you do this.  She also said that maybe, with the new software update coming in November, the Kindle Fire may include this feature, but it's a \"maybe\".  I'm sorry, but this is a huge no-no for me if a company can't get their s*** together enough to offer basic organization of your library on their own device, when it's a feature already available in an app for a different company's device.  I know I'm repeating myself, but I'm just so shocked that they can't even get this kind of basic necessity worked out...- THE WORST PART FOR LAST: the BLUE HUE around the edge of the screen.  I read a lot of reviews about how horrible this is, and I thought that I would still give it a try.  I thought that maybe the blue hue isn't visible when you change to the \"sepia\" tone for books.  Um.  Yeah... No, it is still very visible, and it is as annoying as everyone else made it out to be.  I can't concentrate on reading anything bc my eyes kept looking over at the blue hue.  My eyes unconsciously kept floating over to it like a mosquito to a bug zapper.  While I was trying to read, I caught myself thinking, \"wow, that blue hue is ridiculous, it's really visible, how horrible, I can't stop staring at it... so weird...\"  When buying an Amazon Kindle product, I expected a seamless and easy screen to read off of, and this totally FAILED.  So again, when I talked to a tech rep about it, she kept saying that the blue hue is \"completely normal.\"  Um, no.  I spent $250 for the device (without \"special\" promotions) and as the client, I will tell you what I think \"normal\" is.  Trust me when I say that the blue hue is NOT IN ANY WAY \"NORMAL\".  I know this is what she's trained to say, but I felt like Amazon was just trying to CON me. LIKE INSISTING THAT I'M EATING CHICKEN WHEN I HAVE THE SNEAKING SUSPICION THAT I'M EATING CAT.  After looking at countless of different types of computer/device screens, we are intelligent enough consumers to know what is a \"normal\" screen and what isn't.  A blue hue around the edge of a device does not feel \"normal\".  Amazon should seriously listen to all the reviewers' comments about how bad this screen is and just apologize instead of trying to tell us that it's \"NORMAL\".SO - after all these problems within one hour of using the device, I have decided to return to my Apple cocoon and buy an IPad Mini.  Yes, it's much more expensive, but in my opinion, it makes no sense to pay $250 bucks for a device that has so many problems that make it unusable when you can spend an extra $150 more and get SO MUCH MORE that works BEAUTIFULLY.  Sorry Amazon, but you completely failed on this one.  Please listen to your customers' complaints about this device.  We are especially right about the screen - it's HORRIBLE.

This review is specifically for parents hoping to use the free time app, which is the specific reason why we bought this kindle. (we already have two others)First, the app is not intuitive at all. I see no reason to make it so difficult to navigate. I can never figure out where I am or where I need to go and find myself having to log in all over again while trying to navigate it.Second, there is no way to control content under the amazon free time subscription. We chose NOT to use this app, because it means giving content control over to Amazon, and we don't necessarily agree with them on what is good content for our child. They include things we would not and leave out things our child would like that we find acceptable for him.Third, even if you have a prime account, you cannot stream free video content within the free time app unless you pay for the subscription to use the content amazon has chosen. Within the free time app, you must purchase and download any vidoes your kid wants to watch.Fourth (this is minor compared to the other three, but still an issue for us), it would be nice if there was an option for reading time vs other time. Right now we have to set individual app and video times. We'd like him to be able to choose either for the full amount of time. Not that he often will, but we'd love for him to be able to choose educational apps for his full allotment of time.

Apps load faster and wifi connection seems better.  The operating system has been cleaned up and moves things along at a nicer rate as well.  So as for my experience, this years iteration is a good buy, and if you're looking for a tablet, don't pass this one by.For those who post about the lack of Google Play, then they should have bought a stock Android tablet.  It's that simple!  I have both an Asus tablet and HTC phone that can access Play, and yes there are more apps available there, but what are you looking for that you can't get at Amazon or can't live without?  I found that several apps at Play are only available for phones and can't be put on an Android tablet.  Not a deal breaker.One post whined about not having an office suite on their tablet. Go to the app store and get one.  There are several there, and Amazon has the top sellers available for any Android device.  Another post complained about NetFlix not being on his tablet... I downloaded it from the app store and was watching videos within minutes. Take the whiners with a grain of salt.  They only post negative reviews to hear them selves talk.  To those posters, there's not enough cheese in all of Wisconsin to go with your whine.I guess if I have one complaint about this new tablet compared to the previous 8.9, I lost the Micro HDMI port.

I already own an iPad 3, an iPhone, and a MacBook Pro. So it only made sense that I come full circle and buy the mini when I needed a smaller more portable tablet. However, while shopping around, the Kindle Fire HDX won me over.I normally breakdown the good, bad, and the ugly of the products I review. But there's really nothing bad nor ugly about the Kindle Fire HDX. So I've settled for good and not so good...GOOD~ It's affordable. I purchased this using my Amazon store card and received $50 off from their promotion. So for $179, it's $220 cheaper than its rival, the iPad Mini w/ Retina display.~ The images are clear and the colors are vivid. My husband even thinks the screen quality is better than the iPad.~ It's incredibly light. When I unboxed it, I immediately lost myself in a book for a good 3 hours. And there was no hand strain from holding the Kindle up to read for that long.~ I can buy books from Amazon directly from the books section. With the iPad, I had to go Safari, log in to Amazon, buy the book, log back out, then go back to the Kindle app before I can read the book I want.~ I finally get to take advantage of my (1) free book a month for being a Prime member.~ The silk browser is fast and the browsing experience is noticeably smooth.~ I can switch between reading and listening to the book's narration without exiting the books section.~ A ton of apps to choose from. Having used the iOS platform for so long, I was a tad concern that there won't be enough apps for the Kindle. But I was wrong.~ Very user-friendly and easy-to-navigate. If my 3-year old can navigate through the HDX with ease, then so can you.~ Decent battery life. My kids and I put the HDX through the paces when I first unboxed it. And after watching a ton of YouTube videos, reading half a book, browsing through several web pages, and listening to an audiobook, the HDX stayed alive for a good 10 hours.~ MAYDAY BUTTON! This sealed the deal for me. A 24-hour customer support rep directly on your Kindle HDX with just a touch of a button. I mean c'mon, this feature blows Siri completely out of the water.NOT SO GOOD:~ The speakers are not as loud as I'm used to. In some cases it even sounded a bit muffled. But when using headphones, the sound is loud and clear.~ The front camera's quality is not so good. It's grainy. But since I won't be using this for video chats or taking pictures, it's not a big deal.~ The app store is not secure. While my daughter was using the HDX, I got an email thanking me for an app I purchased. Good thing she chose a free app. I have yet to figure out if I can set a password every time someone tries to purchase an app. This feature is available on the iPad, not sure if it too is available on the HDX.~ In the first 48 hours that I had the HDX, my wireless connection would automatically disconnect when the HDX is not in use. So every time I tried to use it I had to log back in to the network and establish a connection. After a few times of doing this I finally got tired and hit the Mayday Button. The Amazon rep was so patient and helpful. We finally fixed the issue, I only needed to modify my router's proxy settings.VERDICT:~ BUY IT!

I spent time perusing these latest greatest Kindles. They were supposed to be pretty much the same as the Fire HD, but with better graphics, battery and sound. A few other perks like really great support and cameras front and back. Gadget junkie that I am, I resisted until December, but my Fire was slowing down. Probably from all the stuff I was doing on it. Mind you, it never stopped working but it didn't work quite as well as it had. When Amazon dropped the price by $50 before Christmas, I bought the HDX. It came with 6-month financing at 0% interest. Nice.The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX has a new, improved interface for email and the calendar is better too. I know the audio and video were technically better, but they didn't seem different to me; the audio and video on the Fire HD are super and from super to more super? Nothing to notice. I loved my Kindle Fire HD and figured I would love the new one even more. And so I did. For a day. Maybe two. The battery drained in a phenomenally short time. At one point, I was on the phone with Kindle support complaining about the battery -- and it was dropping at about 1% every two or three minutes. In about 40 minutes, it dropped more than 50%. I plugged it in before it went flat. It also drained while it was not in use -- sleeping -- at approximately 5% per hour. Reading -- not audio or video -- drained it at 15% per hour. As the battery hit less than 20%, it became unresponsive. Customer support suggested I let it drain all the way and recharge it. Which I did.Same story. It seems you can't turn off any of the apps once you turn them on except by forcing a stop. Which slows (but doesn't stop) the draining while the device sleeps, but not when you are using it. Then it just chews through the battery at warp speed.Back at customer service, she said I should send it back and try a different one, there must be something wrong with the unit. I wasn't so sure about it. I had a funny itchy feeling in my brain that the problem was NOT my unit, but a design issue. I'd been reading reviews. Too many people were complaining of battery problems. I had noticed the reviews before I bought but refused to believe Amazon would knowingly market a product not suitable for its intended purpose. If a portable device -- a 7\u2033 tablet -- doesn't have a good battery life, it's useless.The Fire HD didn't have weeks of battery life, as does a plain Kindle, but it had a solid 12 hours. Twelve hours of actual use. On the Fire HDX, you'd be lucky to get 4 hours. Nonetheless, after being assured if the replacement was unsatisfactory, I could return it, I agreed. A couple of days later, the new HDX arrived.The second HDX was worse than the first. After little more than a week, I called Amazon and said \"That's it, I'm done.\" In the meantime, in a fit of totally unwarranted optimism, I had given my Fire HD to my daughter-in-law and I couldn't bring myself to ask for it back. I wouldn't have gotten it anyhow because she REALLY likes it. So there I was without a Kindle. I could use my husband's temporarily, but not long-term because he reads too.I bought the Paperwhite -- the model with WiFi, not 3G. It arrived yesterday. I set it up late in the afternoon. It went live as soon as I plugged it in. It immediately  - at blinding speed -- connected, displaying all my books and documents sorted into the categories I'd created on my original Kindle. The Paperwhite reminded me why I fell in love with Kindles. It's a great reader. It has a few little bells (no whistles). It's light, small, easy-to-use. It has some similar design elements as the Fire HD -- a touch screen, virtual keyboard and its own light -- but retains many things I loved about the older Kindles, mainly that it is a wonderful device on which to read a book.Paperwhite is a dedicated reader, not a tablet. Flat, non-reflective surface -- very easy on the eyes. Adjustable fonts and lighting that won't wake your spouse or make you go blind. It weighs almost nothing, even with a cover. You can get inexpensive covers for it. Mine (from Fintie) cost $10. There were cheaper ones, but I liked this design and I've owned Fintie covers and knew the quality is good. I settled in to read last night and for the first time in a long time, could focus on the book. The Fire HD was a great little tablet, but it was forever teasing me away from reading to play a game, hear a tune, or watch a movie -- things I can easily do on my laptop.Perhaps this is what I should have gotten in the first place. Regardless, I cannot recommend the new Kindle Fire HDX. The battery is inadequate to the tablet. I'm really sorry to have to say this.

If you're a Prime member, this is the best tablet to get the most out of Prime.I have an iPad mini and the first gen Nexus 7 already and used several older tablets (iPad 1, Acer Iconnia, Dell....) and it's amazing how much faster each new generation of devices performs. This HDX has a very clear, sharp screen. I haven't seen the new iPad mini with retina but I can't justify spending almost twice as much for it.So far, here are the two negatives about the tablet:1. Mine was shipped with a usb cable and power adapter. However, when I plugged it in using the supplied cable and adapter my tablet displayed a message about using a low powered power supply. It charges very slowly. Every other tablet I've owned came with a 2amp adapter for optimized charging. Why did Amazon bother to include a 1amp charger?2. Not all Prime videos are downloadable. This was the big reason I finally bought a Fire and I was disappointed to find that many titles, especially the more popular  titles, were not available for download.If you are planning to download multiple Prime videos, I suggest upgrading to a 32 GB or bigger.

Responsive. Runs games, or video streaming, HD TV streaming - with no lags.**DesignThat hardly depends on personal taste. Myself I like it. Easy to hold even with one hand. Not slippy. Light. Good thing is that Power and Audio buttons are well situated. If you hold HDX and watch something, or listening music while reading and wish to adjust volume - easy to find buttons as your fingers are exactly there.**Screen/Reading experienceIt is marvelous for reading. I do have Kindle reader as well and mostly read on it, but sometimes have to use Kindle Fire - for EPUBS f/e and I should say KF HDX screen is amazing step ahead. Of course, for reading not as good as EInk screens, but really better than reading on smartphone  or IPad Mini or Notebook. Do not have Nexus, thus can say nothing about. Can't compare here.Only bad thing with this screen is that it's glossy. Terribly glossy. If you love dark backgrounds and pick that option in apps, or if you read and prefer white letters/black background - forget about. You would see yourself in the screen like in a mirror. But for white (or any light) background/black letter thing - as I have said above reading experience is superb!Of course for movies and games HDX screen is superb as well. Rich and bright,  well calibrated.  Vivid colors. No complains here.I do have some applications for note-taking (handwriting) like 7Notes and HDX is good for that. With a stylus you can take notes or draw something - would not say that's exactly like if you have a pen and paper but quite close.**AudioSpeakers are well situated so you never hold it with your hand. And the audio is good - loud and clear. I do also have bluetooth speakers but no real need to use them. Well, maybe somewhere in a noisy environment.Back, where speakers are located has an angle and that's smart - if you lay HDX on table, speakers are not covered and audio is good.**BatteryHolds about 10-11 hours (Amazon says 11). But when you read, it automatically picks energysave regime, well done! Nice option really and very useful.Charging takes about 6 hours. Bit less.But HDX charger output is 1A, when HDX can be charged at 1.8A - thus, better to use other charger it would be fast. F/e 1st Gen KF charger output is exactly 1.8A.**Web browsingWith double antenna it finds Wi-Fi easily and holds it well.Silk browser is getting better. Works well, quick enough but still below Chrome. Of course Silk is the only browser on Amazon appstore, but sideloading is possible. :)Streaming is smooth. You can watch online TV from some other web-servers, of course watch Youtube, Dailymotion... No lags. If you have access to some HD TV online broadcast services - HDX is good for that as well. Buffering is very quick and after it goes like a charm. HDX great hardware gives you all benefits here.**HDX Keyboard/FontsYou can read books, surf web in any (or almost any? - don't want to make a mistake) language and you can type as well as HDX new keyboard gives an option to download lots of additional languages. And keyboard supports path-tracing like Swype. Works really well. If you love Swype keyboard, HDX one is close to that standard.**EcosystemDepends you are a long-time Amazon customer or new here. Are you a Prime member or not. Myself I am with Amazon for several years now. Buy from e-shop, also reading on Kindle (reader), later when they release KF tablet I got it... thus, HDX integration with Amazon services is an important thing for me. You access all your books. All your documents you store with Amazon. Cloud Drive is integrated. Videos, music streaming. You can now download Prime videos as well.Needless to say, that buying from Amazon e-shop or siblings like Zappos or MyHabit is easy and nice.As for apps - of course Amazon Appstore is way behind it's e-shop. You may not find lots of applications you wish to have. Hope Amazon would work here and call more developers. But again - don't forget, you can find an application somewhere else and sideload to HDX. Of course - that's not an ideal, but still a solution sometimes.And MayDay. 24/7 Online support. Have not used it yet. :) But that may be helpful when you need.**Cons/Things you should consider, while orderingTraditionally: No Google Play (but some Google apps like Calendar, Music or Gmail can be sideloaded and work - pls., see comments for details). But you know, what you buy.No rare camera but for me that was not crucial while making a decision as I do not really gonna to use it having smartphone with better camera.As for blue light around screen edges - lots of people do complain. For my eyes that's barely noticeable and not irritating while reading or browsing.If you refer to \"We want you to know...\" topic on HDX page, Amazon says, that \"All displays have some level of light emission around the edges... Most LCD displays use white LEDs. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"Thus, if you buy HDX, you have to live with blue glow. Future software updates would leave that intact I guess.Fire OS is almost no Android OS. Hard to feel Android here. And native launcher is much different from any other Android launcher. If HDX is not your first KF - than you know it, but if HDX is your first tablet form Amazon, you may feel lost from the beginning.  I felt this way when I received my 1st Gen. KF... finally I ended installing an alternative launcher. Sorry, Amazon. :)But I should say, that for HDX Amazon made some nice changes - f/e option to see apps. in greed view. That's nice.**Special offersYou see Ad ONLY on lock screen, as soon you slide to unlock - ad banner disappears. Not annoying at all IMHO.In conclusion - great hardware, well build and if you are with Amazon ecosystem and do not need Google Play etc. - this is an extremely nice tablet.___Accessories:**CaseJust got Slimline Case from Poetic (which is on sale right now on Amazon). Fits HDX well. Awakes tablet when opened, like Origami case does. Very good one.**OTG/BluetoothNo surprise, but in case you wonder - no flash drive supported via OTG but I tried to connect HDX and my smartphone via bluetooth and it works.", "Title": "Great Tablet if you are with Amazon Ecosystem", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "Bruno F.

The screen is beautiful. It has 323 pixels per inch as opposed to 216 for the HD. Apparently 107 pixels per inch is enough to bring a device from high definition into extreme high definition.Whatever the numbers really mean doesn't mean a whole lot to most people. This screen is dazzling and it will not disappoint you.StorageA 16 gig HDD isn't too terrible for something that costs $229. The main issue here is that if you intend to use the feature allowing you to store 1080p movies then those 16 gigabytes will fill up rather quickly. It is also apparent that the operating system and support software will also take up a portion of that 16 gigabytes. As with nearly all devices of this type one can assume that it is likely that you will never be able to increase the size of this hard drive.Form FactorKindle Fires have always been build like a tank. They were able to take a beating and are more difficult to crack than other screen-based items. Unfortunately, this comes with the price that the Kindle Fire was rather bulky and clunky. This time around we get a nice slim device that also seems durable. It is comfortable to hold in your hand without feeling cheap. The width went from 0.9 inches to 0.6 inches (33% thinner!) and the weight went from .86 pounds to .66 pounds.New Operating systemRecently, the Kindle Fire operating system has started to become a bit more difficult to use. Things seems to be a little bit less user friendly, though it did have a lot more features. I got to see an older generation in my family struggle when the OS got an upgrade for the Kindle Fire HD.The New Operating System is called Mojito and it is based on androids JellyBean. This feels more iterative than a revamp but some things about it definitely work. You still have the carousel with Mojito, but you can view more apps at once which definitely makes this feature more usable. Silk now feels like something I might actually want to use. I feel that this has has the biggest upgrade with the new operating system. The Keyboard here feels much smoother and pages definitely seem to have loaded faster (though i guess i should thank the increased specs for that one). This is also helped along by the fact that the touch screen is far more accurate. I can't be certain of who to thank but this is definitely a smoother, more pleasurable experience.New FeaturesAs we know there are many things to like about amazons Kindle. People can go back and forth comparing the size, quality, and price of this item to that of an iPad. Here are a few argument winners that will help to sway people into the Amazon ecosystem.Prime Viewing...now watch Prime without internetYou will now be able to download amazon prime content directly to the hard drive of your Kindle. This means you can enjoy a long car trip or a plane ride without using 3G service. This is a great upgrade and truly has this item stand apart.X-RAY just got better (sorta)Now with X-RAY you can bring up imdb.com information on people that have just come into the screen. This is partly and old feature but it will become new again with trivia. This is just the trivia that is already provided on the imdb.com website, but it is a fun addition. There are also instances where you can follow certain lyrics line by line. At the time of the review I have yet to try out this feature.The idea of adding more to X-RAY is nice. Anything that makes watching a movie more immerse is a good thing. Unfortunately, this kinda feels like something that you will forget about very quickly. Though, there is a push for this kind of content nowadays (SmartGlass) so maybe it could become something we all naturally all use, time will tell i supposeMaydayTo me, this is the thing that really drew my attention.  This is definitely something that is meant to be used by my parents but it gives a warm to the product. A savy electronics user may never need to use Mayday in order to find out where the home button is but it would be fantastic if this type of feature is forever integrated into devices by other companies. Hopefully, this free service will be a game-changer for customer service.Why Only Four Stars? (small drawbacks)The new Kindle Fire HDX is a fantastic piece of hardware. It is light, beautiful, and fast. Unfortunately, this device feels as locked down as previous Kindle Fire models.The the entire Kindle Fire line boasts that it is compatible with 80,000 apps. This number looks really high but there are nearly 10x as many apps on the android store that are not compatible with the Kindle Fire. Kindle items are Android devices of sorts, why can't they run every app available?In addition to this there still does not seem to be any way to create your own home screen wallpaper. I have seen with previous devices that even with the ads turned off you still cannot choose your own home screen. The images they have provided are stunning, yet there is no customization. There should at least be a way to set your home screen to reflect the image of the book you have most recently read.Holding the device is wonderful, it is light and the face of the device is beautiful. The back has a rubber touch to it and the side has a nice angle to it. The power button and the volume rocker are on this angled surface which is nice, but it's not entirely impossible to feel a bit uncomfortable at first. One thing that is curious to me is that the speakers have been moved to the back. They have a nicer speaker set this time around but it seems unusual to me to be projecting that backward. In addition to this is seems possible to me that some people might naturally want to hold the device with their fingers covering these speaker holes. Clearly, these are minor issues that may not amount to much once you get accustomed to it.If you have come to this page looking for a way to figure out if you should get the 7\" or the 8.9\" I have one insight for you. I have never held the 8.9\" but one instant difference is that the larger device has a rear facing camera. This wouldn't be a deal-breaker for me but i thought it might be important to note this.These few issues are very petty and, in the long run, they are insignificant. I am just shocked that such a fantastic device has such unusual restrictions. I cannot imagine that this would ruin the device for any buyer, but I felt it would only be fair to make you aware.This device is beautiful and deserves a spot in your home if you are looking for an upgrade. I love the look and feel of this device, I will just be sitting here hoping that the next time around we get a stock android device, though maybe I should just be happy that this thing will keep a huge smile on my face for a very long time.", "Title": "Stunning upgrade with just a few familiar drawbacks", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer \"Usagi Driver\"", "ReviewID": "R3TQF9CKUT20N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HDX is magnificent, just read all the raves.

Within the first day, knew that it wasn't going back, as it has exceeded my subjective expectations. Mine is the Wi-Fi version with 16GB memory, and I picked this one based on prior experience with earlier versions. Right out of the box it was easy to see that the engineers had done their homework and listened to the users of the prior models. As an owner of the first generation Kindle Fire and then the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablets, it becomes quickly apparent that this one has most of the features we have been looking for since the first models.This will be a detailed review, so for those who just want the key points, will list them followed by a more in-depth look:\u25c6 Likes:+ Excellent 7\" HDX display; 1920x1200 (323 PPI), exact color accuracy (100% sRGB)+ Super-fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor; Snapdragon 800 with Adreno 330 GPU+ Long battery life; up to 11 hours, 17 hours when reading; charger included+ Updated Fire OS 3.1 \"Mojito\"; has Goodreads integration, Cloud Collections and more+ Lightweight; about 10\u00bd ounces (Wi-Fi model); excellent ergonomics+ Dolby Digital Plus audio; optimized according to task+ 'Mayday' button; online tech support in 15 seconds or less+ Front-Facing HD camera; good for those into selfies+ Dual-band, dual-antenna Wi-Fi; excellent connectivity+ Silk Web Browser; cloud-optimized, faster than older versions+ One-year limited warranty & service; excellent from past experiences\u25c6 On the Fence:\u00b1 Angled microUSB connection; may take some getting used to\u25c6 Dislikes:- None encountered\u25c6 Opening the Box:The Kindle Fire HDX arrived quickly, within two days of ordering, and it was well packaged. Within the flip-lid box was the new Kindle Fire 7\" HDX tablet, a USB 2.0 cable, a 5W power adapter, and a Quick Start Guide. I immediately plugged the unit into the charger to make sure that the battery was fully charged, then turned on the power.From the first moments it was obvious that the HDX was much faster than the previous versions, but it was the sharpness and response of the screen that really stood out. Had read numerous online reviews prior to ordering the Kindle Fire HDX where so many were raving about the 1920x1200 high pixel density (323 PPI) display, and they were right. The color accuracy (100% sRGB) is faultless, and admittedly even better than my earlier Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" that has been service for over a year.It weighs about 10\u00bd ounces, so it's light enough to carry day to day without adding much weight to what you normally carry. The overall dimensions are 7.3 x 5 x .35 inches, making it easy to hold in just one hand. It may be too large for a pocket, but will fit easily into your briefcase or bag. Found that is slipped easily into my camera bag, a personal necessity.\u25c6 In Use:First impressions are one thing, but it is the actual usage that counts. Most of the apps that I had already been using popped up smoothly when the HDX was turned on, and the improvements with the Fire OS 3.1 \"Mojito\" upgrade were apparent. On the home screen, the contents, books and apps in Carousel View are easy to access, and the new Quick Switch aspect allows a side swipe gesture to easily move between multiple apps or individual content items without navigating home.Had ordered mine with Special Offers enabled from prior experience with the HD, and this one is actually smoother and better. And admittedly I ordered a sleeve case from one of those deals at a decent savings.As far as Wi-Fi performance goes, I have had no issues as this model has a dual-band, dual-antenna built in. I've been able to move around from one room to another with no signal loss. Using this tablet in hot spot enabled locations is easy as well.\u25c6 Using the Amazon Appstore:The Appstore is often perceived as a third-tier marketplace in the mobile space, due primarily to the fact that Apple's App Store and the Google Play marketplace are so large. But the Amazon Appstore has been quietly growing and posting some major titles in many categories, allowing users to find almost all of the more popular apps they would find elsewhere. As you explore the Appstore, check the reviews for whatever category appeals to you, and maybe do some experimenting. My focus with my Kindle Fire HD and HDX is more toward productivity and photo apps, but I'll list a few to perhaps help.The very first app that I downloaded on my new Kindle Fire HDX was Lookout Security & Antivirus (Kindle Tablet Edition), as any device that goes on the Internet can be hit. First used on my Kindle Fire HD over a year ago, it has proven to be a best in class utility, and it's a highly recommended 5-star freebie.There are a number of popular apps already loaded on the Kindle Fire HDX if you explore a bit. You'll find the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), Yelp, Goodreads, and of course the Kindle e-reader app. In addition, you'll find utility apps, productivity tools, games, entertainment apps, and most of the big social-networking services.For business and professional users there is the LinkedIn app, and for general social networking you'll find Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and more. There is no `official' YouTube app available for the Kindle Fire HDX, but YouTube videos do play in the Silk browser, and streaming-music apps and services are plentiful.There is very little that the Kindle Fire HDX cannot handle; it is surprisingly fast at everything. There is currently nothing available on the Amazon App store that can make it break a sweat, from what I have observed.\u25c6 Movies and Videos:You can download videos from Amazon Instant Video and watch them offline, which is unique to the HDX series. Rotate the screen and you will be surprised at how quickly it reorients itself. Flip it over during an HD movie and the HDX doesn't even blink. If you are not already a member, taking advantage of that free Amazon Prime trial is worth it, particularly with this tablet, if just for the videos and movies.The other Prime features are good as well: free two-day shipping and a free e-book each month. Try it out, but don't get hooked if you want to avoid paying $79 a year. For me it's proven to be worthwhile for years, and now with the video free trials, even more than before.\u25c6 Mayday:The 'Mayday' button is Amazon's free online tech support, where they have publicly committed to providing live support in 15 seconds or less; 24x7, 365 days a year. Based on prior experience with previous devices, had fully expected to give it a try, but the HDX is so intuitive that it was unnecessary. Thought of coming up with some obscure question to ask, but every time I looked for something, the answer was right there in front of me. As an interesting note, there were a number of online tech journalists who had reported that the Mayday tech calls had averaged a nine-second response during the Christmas season. Impressive, to say the least.\u25c6 Summary:Looking at this review, I've had to edit out a lot of random observations, and at this point all of them are positive. As noted earlier, I have encountered no negative points with this device, which is a rare thing. There are some features that I will never use, such as Kindle FreeTime Unlimited. This is the innovative all-in-one subscription that offers games, books, educational apps, movies, and TV shows for parents and kids. For those who have children this is probably good, but mine are grown.I have owned this device for less than a month, so expect that updates will be posted as I find them.The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is quite fast when it comes to most tasks, and the screen is spectacular to say the least. It has excellent battery life, and there seems to be a 40-50% increase in longevity during times when you're reading in the Kindle app. The Silk browser is fast and easy to navigate, and it would be pretty hard to screw anything up with its use. The Dolby Digital Plus audio is excellent, and the good quality speakers combined with the first-rate display make the Kindle Fire HDX well suited for watching videos and playing games. The Wi-Fi version that I picked fits my needs, quite well, but keep in mind that there are other models that may be better suited to your personal needs and location. Bottom line: the Kindle Fire HDX is a 5-star device, and is the best that Amazon has offered to date.JW \u25aa 12/31/2013", "Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\"...

The kindle refused to turn on when I hit the power button so I held the power button nothing. I tapped the power button a couple times not response I held it again, so on and so forth for about 5 minutes until it sprang to life and relief flooded across my body. This relief was short lived through because only 10 minutes into having the product on after going through all of the initial set up the screen went blank. I called up kindle support and was transferred around about 3 times before I found someone remotely competent. They went through some steps and determined that my brand new out of the box Kindle was broken already! they said they were going to express ship the product. When the shipping information appeared on my account it said that it would be shipped in 4 business days, I don't know about you but 4 days is about double what should be considered express shipping. But I patiently waited, on the 4th day when it hadn't arrived I called the shipping company and they explained the estimate was wrong and it will be taking 5 business days to receive the product which just added to my excitement. When the product finally arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it turned on much more easily. Well pleasantly surprised until I tried to register my device. When I tried it would not let me register it, yet again I wade neck deep into the sea of incompetence that is Amazon customer service to find out that because they do not know how to properly ship a product and it took longer than 2 days to be received they went out and on their own reported it lost or stolen which is essence bricked my kindle. the process of reversing the problem took over an hour and was the worst hassle on the phone I have ever had.

I do pay for Amazon Prime membership as well as Kindle Freetime Unlimited for kids.Ok, with that out of the way, allow me to share with you my impressions:Device layout/Handling-----------------------WEIGHT: It feels really light! I measured on my digital scale which showed 10.6oz (300g)VOLUME CONTROL: I actually like the volume up/down on the back where my right fingers can conveniently adjust without losing grip. If these buttons can be re-mapped, then racing games will be at another level with \"paddle shifters!\"POWER BUTTON: I am neutral on its location (left rear). Users can get confused with volume buttons on the other side. Also, once the Origami case is put on, there would not be a need to hit the power button at all since opening/closing cover will do the job automagically.Display/Audio--------------TEXT: very sharp - can see the difference with its improved pixel density. Not sure it'll help improve the reader's vision, but certainly it is very pleasant and easy on the eye. Almost as pleasant as Kindle Paperwhites, but with color!VIDEO: I side-loaded a 1080p movie clip, and it looked real good as it should. Most people will not put big 1080p movies with 16-32GB storage. Downloaded 720p HD videos are fine, but they won't blow anyone away compared to similar tablets on the market.GRAPHICS: very smooth and clean rendering with no lag for fast action games like Real Racing 3 and Asphalt 8. Icons for Apps, movies, and music albums all look sharper. The only negative I found with such high resolution is some older color kids books are image-based, so a full page on older Kindle Fire now look tiny on the HDX display.AUDIO: Very impressive stereo fidelity! I can hear the pleasant difference compare to the Fire HD, but may not be as loud. Sound reflects nicely when laid flat on my kitchen counter.CAMERA: only front-facing camera which looks fine with proper lighting. Nothing breakthrough here. Maybe someday there can be a nigh-vision camera as part of the x-ray feature set...LOLBattery Life--------------STANDBY: full to drained in 4 days - just under 100 hours with email and notification check once a day.ACTIVE USE: I got past 6 hours of web browsing, listen to music, and watching videos before I had to retire (approx 50% juice left)Software/System----------------STABILITY: no hang-and-reboot has occurred so far. This happened a few times on my Fire HD. The pad is warm to touch after a while but not hot.WI-FI/Bluetooth: works well like the Fire HDs.X-Ray: Music lyrics is very cool and I love it. This feature shows up on many of the MP3 albums purchased from Amazon. Usefulness in Kindle books depend on the content. Movies? Works like having an interactive blu-ray session, which I don't find it as useful. As expected, my personal uploaded music are not \"x-rayed\" for lyrics.QUIET TIME: Saw \"Quiet Time\" button next to \"Mayday\" and didn't know what it is, so I pressed \"Mayday\" to find out. Quiet time is to \"mute\" notification and others that cause audibles, but does not mute the sound from music, games, or other apps.MAYDAY: got a male operator within 15 seconds. He did require me to verify my email address, name on the account, and billing address. I asked him how would my kids be able to use this feature when I issue them the new Kindle HDX?  He said \"good question\" and will pass it on...So just a heads-up that the operator will need certain info.SILK: Browser runs fast as is. This is NOT always the case with Fire HD, where the browser can crawl like a turtle unless the \"Accelerate Page Loading\" is turned off. So looks like the developers fixed this to perform as advertised. I hope that will give Fire HD's software an update also.Summary--------For Kindle users: The HDX is a good incremental upgrade to Fire HD. The major improvements underneath don't surface as much for general users. But for owners of the first generation Kindle Fire, upgrade to HDX is significant.For non Kindle tablet owners: Kindle devices greatly enhance experience with Amazon's offerings with e-books, music hosting, instant videos, magazines, and especially for Prime members.

Wertz \"Imautobot\"", "ReviewID": "R1EQCALRS6SF8F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really really wanted to like this Kindle.  I bought it as a upgrade from a 2012 Google Nexus 7.  This was a mistake.At first I did this because I am a Prime member, and an Amazon device is really the only way to get access to the streaming video on a tablet, or the lending library option.  However, these additional options do not make up for what I lost.  By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.  If you want a legitimate version of any Google product, or many other Google play apps, you cannot install it without a side-load situation.  My problem with that is that apks are then downloaded by non-store sites, this means they might be out of date, or even hacked.  I chose the path of least resistance and just sent it back.  I've got better things to do with my time that hack a product right out of the box.  While this means you don't get access to the actual G-mail app, Google Earth, Google+, and YouTube, the loss that hurt me the most was the inability to install Chrome.  Chrome has all my bookmarks, and I had little desire to painstakingly re-enter all those into the silk browser.The hardware is nice, the interface runs smooth, and the high res icons that consume the better part of the main menu are surprisingly beautiful.  However, I found it annoying that under those icons, you'll be force fed amazon purchase suggestions based upon on what icon is centered.  I bought the Kindle without the \"special offers\" for a reason, so this subtle solicitation bothered me.Ultimately the Kindle feels only slightly less locked down than an iPhone/iPad, which is exactly the same reason why I don't buy those Apple products.  I want my device to be free to get apps from multiple (legitimate) sources.  And I want that functionality to exist out of the box.  It's interesting that my Nexus 7 can easily get the Amazon app store installed, but the Kindle could not easily have given me access to the Google Play store.I ended up replacing this with a Nexus 7 2013, which lamentably has a slightly slower processor, but at least I'm not in for any of these proprietary surprises.  Maybe I've just been spoiled by my other Android devices.If Kindle allows Google apps to be able to be installed through a front-door option, I would gladly revisit the Kindle hardware, it is still a nice piece of equipment.", "Title": "Beautiful and flawed.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Author": "Linda G", "ReviewID": "R2041D1V2XNNHM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great device for someone who has trouble getting around the internet.

I understand the reasons for the blue LED use and accept Amazons explanation. It is a non issue, really. I read quite a bit on the Kindle HDX on a plain white screen then a sepia screen and was not distracted. Again, it is on the very edges where no text appears. It is nonexistent on videos, dark backgrounds, etc. I did try the Mayday function with a question and it was promptly answered and frankly, this is a really progressive implementation of customer service/tech support. Very nice job Amazon. The curated appstore is obviously not as complete as Google Play but has anything important and then some. I do not feel the need to sideload apps whatsoever. The essentials are more than covered and then some. For the record I also own the Google Nexus 7 2nd Gen and think these are two great devices. I'm fully invested in the Amazon ecosystem with books, MP3's, apps and videos and like having a dedicated device. The Nexus 7 can do all the same things by running Amazon Apps except there is no App for Amazon Instant Video. The IOS (ipad, iphone) has such an app, but not android. All told I have the best of both worlds and didn't break the bank to do so. If you are on the fence I don't think you can lose either way. The biggest differences are No Google Play on the Fire HDX, and no Amazon Instant Video on the Nexus 7. Faster quad core processor on the Fire HDX and brighter screen on the Nexus 7. There is a sense of community with Amazon that is really an intangible and keeps me loyal to this company.

That I didn't like.  3d Another issue was the fact that certain parts of my screen where sluggish to respond to touch.  That tore it and I had to exchange it.  I spoke with tech support through the mayday function, but all I got was a picture and no video like they said.There was an update that would not download, and I had the device for 2 days.  All that time the update bar never moved.One thing that surprised me was the cheap packaging the first kindle arrived in.  It came in a cushioned mailing envelope and the kindle was sliding around inside.  I thought that was kind of a cheesy way to ship a $300.00 device, and I was happy to see that yesterday when my new one arrived it came in a very well cushioned sturdy box which I appreciated a lot more than the cheesy cushioned envelope the first one came in.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of the issues I was having were due to the kindle being banged around by ups personnel playing football with it.  As usual Amazon was very cooperative and they rushed me another one in a couple of days.  I received the new one yesterday, and I still see the blue haze around the page, but like I said that doesn't bother me.  I usually read with the black backdrop and white letters in any case.  Everything else on this one is running smoothly so far, but it's on probation.  I'm giving it 5 stars because so far everything on it works like it's supposed to.  I used the mayday function on it a couple of times and it only took a few seconds for a live video of the tech to pop up on my screen which I found pretty cool and very helpful.  So far I find it to be a 5 star device, but like I said, I'm going to give it a month and see if I have to come back and change my review or not.  I'm hoping not because I really like it, and hope it stays like it is.  The high definition is amazing, and so far the only thing I haven't tried is the Skype function due to the fact that I don't feel like blowing more money on something I really don't need because you have to purchase time with them like you would with a cell phone company.  Something to consider maybe in the future.  I opted for the one with the ads but they don't bother me in the least, and you only see them when you are turning your device on.  I also have the one with the 64 gbs which is a definite improvement over my first generation kindle which this one is replacing.Overall I think it's a great device, and I've checked out ipads, and I'm glad I've got this instead of one of the overpriced super hyped ipads.  You're on probation kindle HDX until the 22nd of November!  Ok, here it is November 7th, and I've had my new kindle now for a while and I just thought I'd come back and add something I don't like about it.  I thought of subtracting a star because of these two reasons, but the good outweigh the bad (at least in my opinion) and here are the two reasons why I almost subtracted a star:First there is no light indicating when your kindle is fully charged.  You have to turn your kindle on to see if it's finished charging.  Why get rid of the light indicator?  Did it really take up that much space?Second: Why are the speakers in the back and not in the front?  It sounds a hell of a lot better when you turn your kindle backwards and listen to it.  Then you can't see the video.  Come on Amazon!  You've made a killer device and it could have been a lot better by adding a charge indicator light and moving the speakers to where they should be!

I got it on special for $154 and at that price it's a freaking bargain.  I am a  longtime Ipad user (Ipad 2 and more recently Ipad Air) but I was looking for something more portable I could take on my subway ride to work and I didn't want to drop $400 for an Ipad Mini.  What really sold me on the HDX was that I could download free content from Prime and then watch that on the train and I would be able to use the device as a very portable reader.  I was expecting a significant downgrade from my Ipad Air in performance but have found myself blown away by:1. Feel:  The device is light, well built and has good tactile feel with a grippy, rubber like backing.  I bought a case (10 bucks) which was fine but I really liked holding the device without protection so I ditched it.2. Picture:  The picture quality for videos is amazing, far surpassing the Ipad Air's (or any other display I've seen):  I downloaded and watched (for free) an episode of Justified and was noticing slight blemishes and beads of sweat on people's faces.  The images are simply beautiful.3.  Performance:  The HDX is snappy with no lag whatsoever and very intuitive functionality. I was even able to side load a nook app and other Google Play apps in a matter of minutes following easy instructions on line.4.  Browser:  Silk is very quick and easy to use and works like Chrome (which can also be sideloaded but I prefer Silk)5. Customer Support: The Mayday function is revolutionary.  I have never waited more than 30 seconds for help and every rep has been friendly and competent (and native English speakers).  They have walked me through the necessary steps, drawing and highlighting on my unit, and even provided additional tips and suggestions.  Like others I had some issues with dropped WI-FI signals but the Mayday rep downloaded a WI-FI manager for me that maximizes the signal strength from my router and I haven't had a dropped signal since then, about a week ago.  One Mayday rep I spoke to said they spend a lot of time helping folks with basic non-HDX-specific functions on third party apps like Facebook or email like posting pictures or attaching documents.  The Mayday reps are also Amazon generalists and can handle customer service issues as well.6. Cloud storage: This was something I wasn't even aware of when I purchased the unit but copying photos from my Mac and music from Itunes into the Amazon cloud and onto the device was easy and free (2GB for photos and 250 songs).  I also have all my Nook books on the unit which I didn't know was something I could do.In summary I am very impressed with my HDX.  It's a very capable, inexpensive little device.  It won't replace my Ipad use at home but it's perfect for commuting and travelling places where I don't want to carry a larger device.  I have since purchased one for my mom for Mother's Day.  I originally purchased the Fire for her but the Mayday button would be so helpful for her, particularly with everyday functions like how to use Facebook, that I returned the Fire and upgraded to HDX.In brief response to comments from some of the the other reviewers: it is true that the universe of available apps is smaller than on Google Play or Itunes.  That's not really Amazon's fault and most Google Play apps can be side loaded with third-party software. The critical apps are all there.  Also, as other reviewers have noted, the HDX can drop WI-FI signals.  As discussed above, Amazon is aware of the issue and, according to the Mayday rep I spoke with, is working on a fix to be released with the next software update.

I really had a hard time choosing between Kindle and ipad. I knew I was getting all 3 kids a kindle fire for Christmas (a different review coming for those), but for myself, the decision was tough since I already have an iphone and feel like an ipad is just a bigger version of the iphone but it's not a phone - so part of me thought \"whats the point?\". I wanted a device to-go and mostly for entertainment and books. I have a laptop and it's not fun to lug around when really I just want something to maybe do a little work email and gaming or read on. I also travel frequently and think I can get buy with just a tablet. The Kindle was my first. The results on it are:Music/Media:ipad would streamline all our content with my phone and itunes. If I went the ipad way I feel like we could just kinda have one system and get apple TV to rent movies on. And guess what?! KINDLE does it even better! I paid the 25.00 or whatever it was to upload ALL our 11,000 songs to the cloud and the kids and I can all listen from the cloud or download to our devices. Now I will be researching a device to stream to TV.Speed:Some games lag on this device, but I am still new to it so I am unsure if it's the device or processor, or if it's the game itself. Overall though, the selection of games has been great and free or cheapBooks:You can't go wrong with Kindle books. They are generally MUCH cheaper than apple's books, and sometimes even free! I like the screen and the ease of turning \"pages\", etc. I am still learning about some of the highlighting features, and X-ray is really cool! I just figured that out tonight thanks to MAYDAY!Another great thing! MAYDAY!I have used it twice. I was wondering if they could see me but they cant - even though I can see them. You get a PERSON in AMERICA when you hit the mayday button, and it literally takes less than 10 seconds to connect to them. It really made me think I have to get one of these for my gramma. Really useful. No googling forever, no making an appointment at the genius bar 3 weeks in advance just to ask a simple question. Just hit mayday, reach a human, and ask! And while they answer you they are friendly and may offer up info about other features you didn't know the device had.Sound:I was surprised how good the sound is! Ususally small devices have a bit too much treble or tweet or something for me. This one has even sound. You can comfortably listen to music or something on it without feeling like you need to go get the bluetooth radio. (and it has bluetooth too!) Also sounds great with Beats headphones, but what doesn't?Screen:Is fantastic. Video quality is wonderful!Battery life:Pretty fair. Doesn't last all day if it's in constant use but doesn't take too long to charge either.Now the cons:*No way to track it if it's lost like you can in the icloud, though you can call amazon and they can essentially make it into a brick for whoever finds it. I would just like to see GPS tracking so you know where you left it. Or a way to make it chime somewhere if I can't find it in the house.*Plug is kind of angled and funky, so hard to plug it into the charger in the dark. Have to angle it just right.*NO REAR CAMERA - You can only take front facing \"selfies\" with it.*Not easy to quickly \"kill\" apps if you need to.

As a device for browsing the web, viewing movies and, most especially, reading, it is the best device I've ever tried. It is not without its failings when compared to other tablets (or even the iPhone), but overall I like it. The review that follows is more of a semi-organized narrative vs a table of pros/cons or an organized feature list with scores.Rotation (for apps that support it) is really fast and seamless. The place where rotation doesn't do what I'd expect is email; more on that below.The response time when turned on is what you'd expect. It would be nice if it was easier to stop other apps from running; even iOS 6 has a straightforward way for this (much better in iOS 7). Amazon stuck with the slow & clunky Settings/Apps/Running method that has been in Android seemingly forever. Some apps get pretty unhappy with you if you force them to stop. You can reboot for a clean start, but that makes start-up pretty slow. A pity that while keeping this Android feature they disabled some other key features (see below for Apps issue).Books and even newspapers display their text and pictures beautifully. The paging is snappy unlike my older 2nd Gen Kindle, and for speech-enabled books, the speech synthesis system is decent. I LOVE the X-Ray feature. It is not perfect, but I assume it will just keep getting better.Silk is a decent web browser, but not as smooth as its name tries to imply. It is fast, but doesn't work with some important websites; and when it doesn't work it really doesn't work. Take Google Maps for instance. The display of Google Maps just plain sucks. No doubt about it. My iPhone handles Google Maps much better (and has a Google Maps app). No, I don't plan to take my Kindle on the road as a map device, but I would like to use it instead of my iPhone when a computer isn't handy; but that is not to be. To make things worse, there is no Google Maps app in Amazon's store. And to add insult to injury, you cannot install apps from Google Play unless you root your Kindle. That just plain sucks. This takes thousands of Android apps and puts them out of your reach. Amazon already has a \"don't install from other app stores\" switch there. When I turn that off, the Kindle HDX should just work with Google Play... I do not understand why Amazon made this choice and the Kindle HDX is poorer for it.I don't have many apps installed (some that I want to install I cannot -- see note above about Google Play). Some that I did install are ill-suited to my Kindle (e.g. Audubon Birds) as they have a fixed orientation and don't understand rotation. I'll probably stick to books and movies (and newspapers), which no doubt suits Amazon just fine.On the question of e-mail: the Kindle's email support looks pretty, but is pretty non-functional for me. I have an Exchange account plus some iMAP-only accounts that I setup. The Exchange account works really well, except for the Kindle's UI (see below) and some odd configuration things. For instance, no matter how many times I changed my notification sound, the HDX insisted on playing a different one. I even tried using the MAYDAY feature to see if the support gurus could help. I got my HDX on the first day they were available, so the support gurus will still learning the device and did not offer up anything I did not know. In the end I turned off notification and rely on my iPhone to alert me.The mail UI is disappointing in that when I rotate my HDX to landscape mode to gain reading space, the HDX instead insists on showing an Outlook-like 2 pane UI. I thought there was no way to change this, until another user (thanks, Judy) pointed out that a 3-dot menu shows up when a message is selected. That menu allows you to switch to fullscreen mode while viewing the message.WORST THING OF ALL with email: The HDX would randomly mark some unviewed messages as read. This took me many, many days to figure out, and caused me to miss some time-critical messages. How do I know it's the HDX? It started after I setup my iMAP accounts on the HDX; it stopped when I deleted them (another ding vs. other devices I've used: no way to disable the account just for testing -- you must delete it or use it).It is nice that installing my Exchange mailbox brought over my contacts & calendar, though I really don't need yet another device chiming to remind me of meetings. So I use this more as a quick check when reading so I don't need to get my iPhone out.The virtual keyboard is ok, but only just ok. It isn't smart about things like automatically engaging the shift key after punctuation or on a new line (I thought I disliked that about the iPhone at times, but the HDX made me realize how handy it is -- sad that my year-old iPhone has a better typing UI than my new HDX though). The spacing makes it easier to type on than a phone, but I miss the iPhone's features (perhaps just because I've become used to them). I do like the running display of word choices that show up as I type.A general configuration gripe: why is there only 1 sound type to be configured? There are notifications for: email, apps, calendar... why just one sound? And why don't changes to that take hold? Sigh, yes it is a smaller detail but one that impacts the \"fit and finish\" of the device. It's not like Amazon hasn't shipped out a tablet-ish device before, so this disappointed me.Movies -- now this is a REALLY nice feature. The speakers on the HDX (especially with the origami cover in place -- separate review coming on that) are just ok; I'd plug a nice headset in to listen. It is very cool that you can download prime movies onto the device and go on the road with those. What I do not understand is why the HDX has no way to SEARCH for downloadable prime movies. Instead, you need to browse, movie-by-movie, to find the ones that can be downloaded. C'mon, Amazon... really?? I haven't watched a movie on my HDX yet but will on a future road trip. I just hope the battery holds up.The UI for viewing photos is marginal; there is no good way to search for, sort or group photos. You just need to scroll through them and try to spot what you want. Worse, when you copy pictures across the USB interface (yay for a USB interface -- with the display, the only other technical advantage the HDX has), the picture's creation date is tossed. The HDX sets the creation date to the date the picture was copied; I can see NO advantage to anybody except for the careless programmer who didn't have to add that feature to his or her spec. Once you find the picture you want though, the display is what you'd expect from the HDX. Again, if I really want to find a particular picture quickly, I guess I'll just go to my iPhone. I am not even sure I'll keep moving pictures to my Kindle.Music: don't use it. My iPhone syncs with iTunes and I also have an iPod. Moving all of that to Amazon's cloud or my HDX would require conversion from Apple's format. Just not worth the time. Some of my music was purchased from Amazon, and those songs are available. But it is a small subset. Top it off with marginal speakers in my configuration and, well I just don't use it.I am yet to try Skype, but I suspect it would work very well.The HDX comes connected to Amazon's store. That makes it easy to buy books or movies. If I ever remember to carry my HDX into my basement to watch movies, it could be an easy way to select a For Rent movie when I want to watch it through my XBox. Too bad the swipe-to-TV feature doesn't include using the Amazon XBox app... then I'd always take my HDX downstairs with me!That leads to another oddity: for some Kindle management features you have to leave Amazon's store app and use Silk (or your laptop or iPhone) to go onto the web. Why is that? I can buy stuff from Amazon (including expensive, physical merchandise), but if I want to add an email address to my \"approved for documents\" list I need to go sign-on via Silk and browse around their website to find that feature? Doesn't make sense to me.Now the Mayday feature -- it is a really nice idea. I am fairly technical, and when I ask for help it is usually on some detail (like why won't my changes to the Notification sound stick?) that is not easy to find in the documentation. Unhappily for me, the Mayday reps, while very eager to help, did not yet know the HDX very well and I was often put on hold while they went to research things. So I'd go back to reading something and sliding their little window around on my HDX... which got old pretty fast. It is, though, really nice to have that help available when they are able to help. I can hardly wait to try hitting Mayday on Xmas day just to see if they can handle the load ;-)So why did I give this device 4 stars? Because it replaced my older, 2nd gen Kindle and as I said above, it rocks in that role. If you want to view this as an iPad competitor, I think it fails as a general-purpose device that you'd take on the road instead of a laptop; hell my iPhone does a better job of that than this new HDX. But that isn't why I bought it.

Movies, tv shows, games, everything looked great on this device.The device was lightweight, had a fast processor and decent memory. I bought the 64GB but they should have made a 128GB since a single 1080p movie with dolby surround took up 9.5-10.3GB when downloaded from my amazon account. You only get 54 GB to start with because of the operating system and whatever else they put on.I could download Prime TV shows to watch offline when travelling, a great feature! The website said you could download Prime movies as well, but I could not find any that gave me the download option.The device came with a charging block (unlike the fire hd I bought last year).It was for these reasons I gave the unit 2 starts and not just 1. Keep reading to find out why!Second, the not so good:When you plug in the charging cord and the headphone, they are not flat and parallel with the unit. They stick up at about a 15 degree angle. Not a big deal, but it made me nervous in case someone accidentally set something on top of it while it was on the counter or desk. I think the damage would be catastrophic to the unit if that happened.The battery life is not great. This unit sucks down the battery faster than my fire hd does.Lastly, the terrible:I received the unit and spent the day loading it with videos and goodies for an upcoming trip. The last thing I did was sit down to watch a movie I bought specifically to watch on this unit's screen. I noticed a static buzz underneath the soundtrack that was annoying. I experimented until I found that the buzz was happening everytime the unit accessed the internet. Since the movie in question was streaming, the buzz was constant. I tried a downloaded movie, no buzz. I tried surfing the web with nothing on and everytime I clicked a new link, the buzz would be there until the new page was done loading. So, I called Amazon and they sent out a new unit (recieved the next day, thank you Amazon!).The new unit did the same thing. I tried some more experiments and found the buzzing happened with all my ear buds (cheap ones and expensive ones) and did NOT happen with my headphones (both cheap and expensive were clear sounding). The rest of the unit was so cool, I figured I could work around this even though the only reason I have expensive ear buds is to travel with my fire hd. So, I spent another day dowloading tv shows and other goodies to prepare for my trip. I was sitting reading a book and downloading a movie when the unit flashed a warning that I had used up 90% of the storage and did I want to delete something. I clicked no and the unit shut off. I knew the battery was a little low so I plugged in the unit for 20-30 minutes. I tried restarting the unit and nothing. I held down the on/off button for 20 seconds like the website said to and got a brief \"Kindle Fire\" screen flash but nothing else. I called tech support and we basically tried the same thing again and the tech said that they could replace the unit, again.So, I am sending this unit back and getting a refund. I've wasted 2 whole days dealing with this. I have 2 different covers on their way because the origami cover was terrible (see my review for the cover for that story) and I still have to deal with returning those.I'm very annoyed with this whole process because I feel like this was a great product that got rushed through testing and production and was just not ready for consumers yet.

It became my little 7 inch companion everywhere I went. I did everything I asked of it with little complaint. I could work with Gmail, Calendar, Gvoice, and Good docs. Yes, most of my stuff revolves around google for the same reasons so many out there are also tied to the google eco system. I ported my number to gvoice and found it an excellent decision in this world of constant texting slowly replacing talking on a cell phone. All this and play games, rdp into my servers, check stocks, check bank accounts, and track my daily mileage. Everything I needed.This year I purchased the Amazon Kindle HDX 7, an awesome little tablet in every respect. It's extremely fast compared to my old Nexus 7. The screen is absolutely stunning. Games are extremely smooth and everything just works perfectly. That is, except anything that has to do with google. Here's where the HDX leaves me placing in the corner to use only for games or watching videos. Yes, it has an email client but I don't really like it much. There are no other email client choices (yet) for this thing. The calendar is very blah. Google voice apps are non-existent in Amazons store, youtube - forget it. Yes it does Netflix also.Hardware-wise this thing kicks butt. On the software front I totally understand Amazon needs to steer the crowd towards its own content, especially considering the cost hit of the HDX. I'm sure they are losing money by selling us these tablets if not making peanuts on the hardware. Their hope it to hook you into their ecosystem obviously but that leaves us google users having to find other options when it comes to keeping a single tablet with us. Example - I really do love my HDX tablet but I don't bring it to work with me. Instead I continued using my old Nexus 7 for the daily routine. The real odd thing here is that having access to google services on the HDX would not change my spending habits with Amazon. I think Amazon is one of the best sources for just about anything these days. Please Amazon open up the HDX a bit to allow google stuff access.", "Title": "Almost perfect for me but not quite", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Author": "Crystal Elliott", "ReviewID": "R20DNKSF3Z7UEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:-Replaced my smart phone for media so I don't kill my phone's battery-Comfortable fit/great sized tablet-Extremely versatile content wise. I use it for music, games, checking my email, social media, reading, and watching movies on Netflix. If you want to do it, you can probably do it on this device.-Gorgeous vibrant colors-More responsive touch screen then the kindle fire HD which means better control over whatever you are doing (especially important when I'm gaming!)-Physical buttons-Loud speakers-Quad processors make it run very smoothly (much better then the HD)-Came with a wall adapter and charges faster then the kindle fire HD-Updated email app easier to work with then the kindle fire HD's-Updated photo app makes focusing the camera easy-Music player is better organized and more functional-Rubberized backing makes a great grip, though this has not changed-Better accessories then Kindle Fire HD right out the door (I'm looking at you, origami case!)-Lock screen ads lead to FREE stuff and coupons! Why would I pay $15 to lose out on saving money??Cons:-Physical buttons placed in slightly strange places if you use the device primarily in portrait mode (I only switch to landscape if a game I'm playing needs it or I'm watching a movie). I've had the kindle fire HD for almost a year so I'm used to the buttons being in a set place so if you're upgrading that's something to keep in mind.-Charger and headphone ports are slightly slanted so when plugged in the cords jut out in a strange way-The infamous purple/blue light (I personally don't mind it since everything else is so gorgeous but you definitely do notice it while reading so I'm including it in cons I guess as a warning to others)-I preferred the curves on the back, if it ain't broke why fix it? BUT if you've never used a kindle fire HD you won't miss it at all so this isn't really a con per se.Amazon has outdone itself in my opinion. I was a big fan of the Kindle HD (which I had for 8 months) and used it constantly. I prefer Kindle greatly to my iPhone and Kindle tablets may be the reason I switch to an android phone because of how preferable I find it. The ease of use in transferring books and music is unbeatable. Drag and drop and be done with it! And though Amazon tries to push itself on you (no google market on the kindle, amazon cloud, ect) they never do anything as annoying as apple with iTunes. Kindle marries together the simplicity and straight forwardness of using an iPhone (EVERYBODY knows how to use one of those) with the customization and ease of an android. Beginners and pros alike can find something to enjoy on the Kindle HDX.And what's better is everything that people mentioned they didn't like in their reviews of the Kindle HD, Amazon fixed with this tablet. They learned their lesson and included the charger adapter, they made HD content more accessible and better quality, and upped the ante with two more processors with those who felt the Kindle couldn't keep up with their content. They even upgraded Silk to be a better browser! This is basically unprecedented with physical stores because they don't have a consistent reviewing system where the consumer literally says what they liked and don't like. It's great to know Amazon is listening.I'm very satisfied with this purchase (bought from Radioshack, not amazon so it would be here on time for Christmas) and will continue to buy Amazon's tablets whenever they come out and it's time to upgrade. I may update the review as time goes on because I DID just get the kindle for Christmas, but I've been a big fan of Amazon and Amazon Kindle tablets for years now.Edit 1: I've had the kindle for a few weeks now and I still adore it, but the buttons are quickly becoming a big hassle. I don't have 50 dollars to kick out for the official cases but because of the sudden change of the buttons locations finding different cases is extremely hard unless you search through amazon itself. For those who like ordering from amazon this is not really an issue, but those who would like to find a bargain without paying shipping on a case this is a downside.I was split on the button at first because I understand they wanted to change where the buttons are but because of the fact that I can never remember where the power button is and the case issue that's definitely a con.", "Title": "Loyal Kindle Owner", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "Mema \"Wife, Mother, Mema, Sister\"", "ReviewID": "R3AR2BBRDJ0499", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I generally read on my Kindle and this HDX is great for reading, yes there is a hint of purple around the edges but frankly once I start reading I don't even notice it, probably would never have noticed it but for other reviews.

Overall these are excellent tablets, however, there are some drawbacks for parents:- You can not add passwords to each child's profile.  (If you have multiple children, they can easily prank each other by modifying or deleting content from another child's profile so be prepared for drama.)- The child or parent must enter the parental controls password every single time they exit from freetime. If you envision them being able to use freetime, but also to be able to exit freetime to use skype, youtube, the camera, or any other features outside of freetime app, this is a BIG PROBLEM.  The password they have to enter to exit freetime is the same parental controls password that prevents them from making purchases. Making the parental controls useless if you want your child to be able to use the tablet outside of freetime.-  There is no way to set up your children on your amazon account without them also having full access to all of your amazon account information, order history, and all of your other Amazon content.

Although I enjoy and appreciate such things as HAM radio, smart phone, laptop computer, and all Kindles starting with the original e-reader to now the Fire HDX; I am self taught so there will be no sophisticated analysis here. Two years ago I bought the first Kindle Fire and have enjoyed using it however after reading the many reviews over the past year about the Kindle Fire HDX I decided to upgrade.Primarily I use my Kindle for email, listening to the radio, reading, and having the ability to listen to music at the same time.The personal docs is another feature I enjoy as I send my favorite recipes to my Kindle and can easily share them or do my grocery shopping for the ingredients without having to make a list.  I like the lighter in weight, sharp screen with brilliant colors, longer life battery, and better sound quality.  The screen does have less glare, but not as good as the e-reader.The original Kindle fire allowed me to download music directly from Amazon but haven't figured out how to do that with the Kindle HDX, also I had the drop box on the Kindle Fire but am not able to download the app on the new Kindle HDX from the cloud.  I take pictures on my smartphone and they go directly to my laptop computer, and Kindle Fire, and of course stay on my phone; a real convenience.  I am able to go on line to dropbox.com and view my pictures that way, just not as convenient.

The battery life on it is rather poor in my opinion.  I have the Kindle app on my iPad and had been mostly reading on that and maybe I just got spoiled on the battery life offered by the iPad.  With MY standard daily use of the iPad, I could usually go 3 to 4 days between full charges.  The Kindle Fire HDX is only offering me a little less than half that time.  I most often use this device during down time I may have at work.  I think buying an extra charger for it so I can plug it in at work when needed will be a solution for me on this.

I bought the 64GB because I wanted space to download movies and apps because my 3yr old can't stream movies do to our data usage issues. Even though I PURCHASED these movies and DOWNLOADED them to my kindle, my three year old can't watch them now unless I take the kindle to a place that has a stronger internet connection than my cell phone and go into each of the 50 or so movies to 'reset' them because the kindle will start giving her an error message that she needs an internet connection to watch the movies (even though they are downloaded on the kindle!!). Also... even when connected to the internet, I often go into my purchased movies and don't get the option to play the movies. I have to go in and out of the movies a couple times to get the 'play' button to show up. I have also found this unit to be slow and unresponsive.I initially purchased this Kindle in Jan 2014. In less than a week I was calling support because it kept crashing. I had to reset to factory conditions and redownload everything twice in the first two weeks. After two weeks of fighting with the initial purchase Amazon support suggested replacing the unit for me. When they did, they sent me a refurbished one (I had purchased a new one). They refused to send me a new one as replacement so I am now stuck with a piece of crap somebody else already sent back.One of the features I liked most about the old Kindle was Kindle Free Time... this is now crap. You have to have an internet connection to even use it. Kindle Free Time is advertised as a safe way for kids to use the Kindle without worries about them accidentally going on the web or purchasing things. But you now need an internet connection to even use it. So my 3yr old has to use they kindle without free time. She is constantly getting error messages and accidentally buying stuff because she hits wrong buttons. I have to watch my bank account very carefully and call Amazon to reverse everything she buys. This kindle is a constant headache. If she didn't love the games and movies so much, and if I had the money to re-buy all the movies/apps for some other tablet I would in a heartbeat.

I originally bought my kindle so that I could play my amazon instant videos on the go without having to lug my xbox or laptop around.  I am now switching over to google's marketplace because i do not want to have to use a kindle.  Here are some of the reasons why I sent it back.1. Kindle Fire HDX is not able to access all websites.  I was on the phone with customer service trying to resolve the issue and this is what they told me.  I was trying to access 'stocktwits.com' and my kindle could not navigate there.  Apparently this is the case with various sites.  I frequent stocktwits regularly, so this was a big deal for me.2.  Since kindle does not support adobe flash, you have to switch between \"desktop\" and \"mobile\" mode to get videos to play on various websites.  No rhyme or reason to this, but an annoying step to have to take.  This again is customer services solution to videos that wouldn't load on certain sites.3.  The screen is not customizable.  This doesn't sound like a big deal at first, but you'd be surprised at how annoying seeing advertisements each time you unlock your screen can be.  Customer service informed me there is no work around for this.4.  Kindles apps are not well supported.  I tried downloading the etrade app, and it didn't work.  the app would download, but it wouldn't work.  Etrade customer service informed me that they haven't fully developed the app for fire HDX's yet.  Not high on their list of priorities I guess.  I'm sure this is the same with many other apps.  I also could not download the stocktwits app.5.  There is a blue haze.  I know this is much talked about, but it is there.  It didn't really annoy me very much though.6.  Amazon uses the kindle to advertise to you like crazy.  My facebook feed had amazon ads at the top of my page.  my google email immediately became swarmed with amazon emails.  they suggest apps and items under the carousel.  they advertise each time you unlock the tablet.  i mean enough is enough!7.  I'm not impressed with the ease of navigating the device.  I think android is much more intuitive and user friendly, not to mention you have much more versatility since android is open source.Are there Pro's?  sure, but not enough to outweigh the cons for me personally.  It is a relatively snappy device.  The cost is low as well.  I think there are child protective functions if you have kids.If you are need to save money financially by going with the Kindle instead of a more expensive Android or Ipad (don't know much about Ipads), then a kindle may be for you.  But I was buying this strictly for access to amazon instant video, not so much because of price, and I was disappointed.  I really tried to make myself like it, since I love amazon as a company, but I am returning it and switching to Google movies.

I love that I can change the background color of what I'm reading (to black), allowing me to read at night in bed without disturbing my girlfriend with how bright the screen would be otherwise. I can easily change the size of the font when I'm getting tired. I also love how I can check my progress of the current chapter, as well as the entire book. The easily accessible menu options doesn't distract me from my spot while reading. The dictionary and X-Ray while reading is smooth and easy to navigate.I wanted to be able to write on my tablet. I found it was Bluetooth compatible with most keyboards out there. And you can snag a great one at a great price. Then came the writing programs itself. I'm still testing out Kingsoft Office, and am happy with it so far. As a word processor the Kindle Fire handles just as good as a laptop. I like that I can prop the Kindle wherever I need to (using the origami case) and have the keyboard on my lap or wherever is most comfortable.There are many apps not compatible with the HDX, yet are said to have worked with earlier versions. Yet there are hundreds of apps that will work. Guess it's just a waiting game. YouTube videos are great, clear. I may get a Netflix subscription to check out the power of the HDX. Screen mirroring doesn't work as well as I'd like (I have to download an app to connect with my Chromecast), but I'm still figuring things out.The web browser is great.

I mainly wanted it to read books on, which it definitely fulfills the purpose. Prior to this, I had been using a Nook Color that I bought 2 or 3 years ago to read books on. It has been discontinued, and of course due to Amazon's cheaper book prices, as much as I read, I.figured the Kindle would pay for itself in books over time.Pros:I love the way it feels in my hands. It's comfortable. It feels like I could actually be reading a lightweight book. It is much more lightweight than the Nook Color, despite having a screen the same size. A lot of people have said that the Kindle can have a glare when outside reading, which is why one should opt for the paperwhite instead. I took my kindle fire HDX fishing yesterday and read perfectly without glare, which I think may have something to do with my reading settings being set to look like  dark page with white writing on it. You can also change it to a white page with black writing, as normal, or to sepia. I love that it tells me how finished I am with a book (like 45% finished with book). That alone means a lot, because the Nook did not do that at all. The sound on the HDX is phenomenal. It sounds like I am sitting in a surround sound movie theater. My Nook Color, iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy S4, nothing I have owned this far in the tablet and phone world has sounded as awesome as the HDX. I love the predictive keyboard, which to me is similar to my iPad minis, because I can make a lot of mistakes typing quickly. I enjoy the app selection. It is much much more than my nook color ever offered. I am a medical professional and must have epocrates installed on my device. It was right there for free in the app store and works beautifully on this device. I like the fact that if Amazon's store does not have any app I want, I can sideload it. I have only had my HDX for a few days, however, and have not found any apps to be missing thus far. So I have  not had to sideload anything yet. I hear it is not that difficult. The screen is also great and very hi def. I am not sure if it outranks my iPad though. They seem similar to me. I like how quickly the HDX loads movies,videos, and games without lag or having to reload.Cons: the ads you have to pay $15 to get rid of (but I sometimes enjoy seeing what they're offering. It prompts me to look at books I may have not consideredd before). The fact that you can't change the background of the screens home to anything you want. The poor quality front facing only camera on it.

The ability to download & store on the Kindle was new for HDX for Prime users, and you can't do that on the HD.But, after opening the HDX to use, we discovered it does NOT have an HDMI port to connect to the TV with an HDMI cable, like the previous Kindle Fire HD. I cannot believe Amazon removed the HDMI port for the HDX! Makes no sense, and apparently other customers were caught off-guard, too. If you read the description very closely, you'll find that info, but I don't think any HD user expected them to REMOVE a great feature like that.The only way to display HDX content on your TV is to have a TV already set up for Miracast or buy a wireless Miracast adapter (like the crappy Netgear one). In spite of being able to download movies with the HDX rather than live-stream, we still have to use this added wireless device anyway, and had to pay a good bit for it, on top of the HDX price. So, we still get some buffering glitches with this, and the quality is not very good (pixilation), even when we download the movie at the highest quality available. I can't be sure if the problems are from the HDX or the Netgear Miracast adapter, but the end result is we're not using the capability for which I bought the darn thing.Overall, the Kindle Fire HDX and the added Miracast wireless device are a disappointment. Definitely prefer our old Kindle Fire HD with the HDMI cable, even though we have to stream live with it. We're still doing that to watch movies instead of using the download-to-HDX option. IF the HDX with the Miracast adapter worked well (no glitches/hiccups, no pixilation), it would probably be worth it in spite of the additional costs because you wouldn't have to be tethered to the TV with the HDMI cable. That was never really a problem, but it's the only advantage I can see with the HDX. But you do still have to have that added device connected to your TV, with its cables & power supply.I almost returned the HDX when discovered the HDMI problem, but decided to get the Miracast device and try it out. In spite of the disappointment & the fact that we cannot use this at all as intended, we kept the HDX just to have an additional tablet to toss in a backpack or purse. I got it on sale right before Xmas, and it's sort of handy to have 2 (can use one while other is charging), but overall, there's no real benefit over the HD for us, and the HD was a better deal.By the way, I contacted Amazon about the HDX and Miracast devices before I bought an adapter, was transferred to their \"Kindle Fire HDX experts in technical service\" (apparently in India) and got no where. They couldn't tell me anything about which Miracast adapters are available, which ones work, etc. They basically read from the Web description that the HDX uses Miracast. That's it.

Books are easy to read, Screen clarity is great, Movies play back beautiful (if you can get them downloaded), Mayday customer support is great and worked well when I used it.  Battery life is pretty good. Thin and user friendly.The Bad:The apps that they do allow you download are not like the Android ones I am used to.  Do not expect a ton of Android type apps.  You have little or no control over the information they can access on your kindle or amazon.  It seems to me that Amazon does not value the privacy of our personal information. Some Apps even make you agree to allow them to share PERSONAL INFORMATION with other advertisers and \"partners\" before allowing you to install.  If you don\u2019t agree, you cannot install.  The Facebook Application terms that are levied by amazon/Facebook are egregious, so I won\u2019t install that app.The Special offers are not so special...Basically they hold your screen saver hostage with advertisements and movie promos.  If you want to remove them, it will cost you a fee.  (I think $15) Therefore, ads come with the Kindle.Bottom Line:  They have a great product here and they know it, I would have rated it a 5 Star if not for the BS.  It\u2019s not like it used to be, buy our product and use it as you wish.  You must use it the way they want you to and accept their terms or don\u2019t use it.

Admittedly I was initially disappointed with the purplish edge.My advice if your HDX has that issue is to use your HDX for a few days.I now only notice it if i'm looking for it.* Everything is faster on the HDX.The internet is blazing fast on the HDX.Mine holds the connection well at home and at free wifi locations.* Navigation is much improved.On previous models you sometimes had to tap multiple times to get the screen to respond. Also typing was wonky.Most of the navigation worries seem to be a thing of the past.* It's nice and loud.Here is what bothers me a little :* Charging port is horrible. It goes in on an upward angle. Does not feel or look stable.Makes me wonder WHY is it designed like that.* Battery life is less than the previous model(2012 Kindle fire HD) Does not last long on standby.* I wish the power button and the volume were NOT located on the back of the HDX. I prefered the previous button locations.* I used the Mayday button to ask a question about printing from my HDX.Specifically I wanted to know where on the HDX could I  access the print screen amazon shows a shot of in the product tour video. Well my advisor answered fast but when I asked my question she kind of rolled her eyes and made an exasperated sigh. She then said hold on.Her screen went from a live shot of her to a graphic of a pair of headphones.Then another voice started talking to me.

The first, which I ordered before Christmas 2013 (a 16 GB machine, wi-fi only), had to be returned because of the blue halo-ing screen issue. Although I liked it, I already knew that if I tried the Kindle again, it would also have to have a larger storage capacity. So when Radio Shack had Kindles marked down for New Year's, I bit the bullet and grabbed a 32 gig. I am happy to report that the new machine does not have the screen issue and seems to work fine.My impressions of this tablet are that it is the perfect companion to tote around in lieu of its larger far removed cousin, the iPad. (True, the iPad Mini is just as good for a 7\" tablet.) Although one is a modified version of Android, and the other is iOS, they pretty much do the same thing, which is give the user the ability to consume media, albeit on different levels. It is true that Apple does have a larger app selection, and that some Google apps are totally shut out of the Amazon ecosystem--but I haven't found that to be a problem because the basic apps I want to access: News, Netflix, internet and a few others are available on both platforms. I also have no problem issue with the fact that the device only has a front facing camera. I don't Skype or use a tablet camera anyway, so it's a moot point. Both my phone and iPod 5th gen have cameras that work just fine when I want to snap a pix. People who complain about the lack really should research before they purchase an item. There are multiple review platforms on YouTube that show the actual device in real-world situations. Lack of knowledge is not an excuse when you have access to the internet.As for how the Kindle HDX functions, I will give it a thumbs up. The display is crystal clear, the sound is decent and the ability to access the content I want works just fine. It is true the tablet is linked directly to Amazon, but this isn't a problem. I am not a Prime member, but may go ahead and join later on. I also don't mind the screen saver-come-advertising, which often offers great deals in books I am interested in. It's not as annoying as I thought it would be, and I can always pay the 20 dollars later on if I decide I want ads removed.Overall, this is a nice little tablet to tote around, and covers everything you want at hand if you're confined to a situation where you want the basics without carrying around a laptop or larger iPad. Put on a nice case, throw it in a bag and go. You've got books, movies, email and internet on hand. Perfect in every way.One more thing I might mention. Yes, it is compatible with iTunes without having to purchase conversion software, and you can transfer your entire library to the Kindle with a few clicks. Sure, it takes a simple workaround, but the music transfers fine, even if you've purchased most your music through Apple, as I have.A+ to Amazon for creating an affordable, fun little tablet.

Harbour", "ReviewID": "R1DFMDLJ5LLNGE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About fifteen years ago I had a Dell Inspiron that caught on fire and melted. Yes, I was one of those with the bad battery. I received such poor customer service that I went out and replaced the Dell with the Apple PowerBook, their main competitor at the time. And, I never looked back. I have been a part of the Apple ecosystem for more than a decade now, and couldn\u2019t be happier. The design, the experience, the quality. Yes, I know, I\u2019m trapped in their rigid world and the man is holding me down.When they came out with the iPad the public said, huh? We don\u2019t need this, and then gobbled them up by the millions, because Apple had figured out what we were about to. People don\u2019t like to relax with laptops. Open that thing up and you feel the need to do something. It\u2019s because of the keyboard. It\u2019s an input device that is waiting, begging, for your attention. But a tablet is pure consumption. No work required. Just sit back, read a book, play a game, watch a movie. They adopted the Gillette model of business: They didn\u2019t sell the razor handles to make money, they sold the razor handles to sell you blades. The blades here are the apps. And Apple made millions off of the apps. Then came the followers with cheap, poorly made tablets to try and compete and each got smacked down in the process.So here I am with a first generation iPad, yes you read that right \u2014 first gen, and I\u2019m looking to upgrade. I\u2019m thinking the new iPad mini because I want a smaller form factor for flights. It\u2019s before Christmas and I\u2019m in BJ\u2019s. The Christmas lights are blinking and everything is warm and bright. I spy an Amazon Kindle Fire on sale for $99. That\u2019s interesting I think and I move along with the tasks at hand. The thought sticks in my mind and I start investigating the Kindle line. I\u2019m already in deep into the Amazon system; Being a writer my wares are mostly sold there, I need to follow Goodreads daily, and for movies I\u2019m already a Prime member. I take a hard look at how I use the iPad. Email, check. Browse the web, check. Watch some movies, check. But mostly I use it to read books and magazines through the Kindle app. I abandoned  iBooks  years ago. I should support my biggest professional partner, I think, and then start really looking at the Kindle line. Amazon, too, follows the Gillette model. They are selling the HDX almost at cost so that it is easier to buy books, apps, and anything else that Amazon sells.So I dig. I read. I go to Best Buy to showroom the models. And I\u2019m surprised. They\u2019re good. They\u2019re damn good. And they are half the price of the iPad with the same specs (64GB). I make a decision I didn\u2019t think I would two years ago when the first one came out\u2026I placed my order with Santa for a Kindle Fire HDX and waited for Christmas.Fast forward to now. Of course I got the Kindle as Santa is a close friend of mine and I have been giving it a stress test probably only seen in the Amazon Lab. Along with the Nexus 7 (Not Microsoft. Microsoft still doesn\u2019t get it, they want to make you work on the damn things.) there is a serious threat to Apple\u2019s market share. It is a beautiful piece of kit. Sleek and light with a rubberized back that makes it easy to hold while reading. The Kindle Fire is my new best friend. It took me a day or two to get used to where the buttons were but now I can\u2019t imagine them in a different place. The performance is amazing. HD games feel like they are on a console and reading on it is a joy. I know there are some complaints about the blue hue around the edges of the screen. It\u2019s there, but I\u2019m okay with it. Those that keep returning theirs because of the hue are, in my opinion, a bit of the Princess and the Pea. Myself, I\u2019m impressed and ecstatic about the device, and can\u2019t say enough about it. If I find something, I\u2019ll post it here but don\u2019t hold your breath.Will I give up my MacBook Air? Not a chance in hell. iPhone? Possibly. iPad? Yes. Kindle Fire HDX?

The 2 HDX's are the only Kindle products I've ever had to return. This has the potential to be a great tablet once the bugs are worked out.  The bugs consist mainly of dropped wifi connections, the tablet showing a pop up message that you're not connected to a network when the notification icon shows fully connected, and completely \"forgetting\" wifi networks on a regular (almost daily) basis.  The first one was \"buggy\" out of the box, and I had to do 2 factory resets before it would even connect to a wifi network and allow me to register.  I tried factory resets numerous times on the first one and finally returned it.  I then purchased another one and it functioned out of the box, but the wifi issues started within 24 hours.  I did a couple of factory resets and the issues persisted along with random restarts.  After researching the issue online, it appears to be common.  I contacted customer service...who are always fantastic simply to ask if they planned a software or hardware \"fix\" for these issues.  They offered to exchange the tablet.  In my experience, Amazon is always very quick to fix any software issues...but not so much for hardware.  The solution always appears to be to stand behind the hardware and exchange it if justified.  I've had fantastic experiences with their customer service department.  But then again we buy the majority of our groceries, toiletries, household items and gifts from them...so it's obvious we're very loyal customers.  But in this case after having the same issue with 2 units purchased 3 weeks apart, I opted to simply return the HDX and wait for future \"fixes\" or for my HD to break beyond repair.  My Fire HD still works great, and I don't need to spend $250 on a table with \"OK\" improvements that is buggy,  I read and watch movies.  The screen on the HDX is bettter than the HD, but the speakers aren't quite as good.  It's certainly lighter and detaches from the cover easier, but the Origami cover isn't true to the original.  The original \"origami\" cover would allow you to position the Fire in at least 3 positions including a slanted keyboard setting...the new one only does vertical and horizontal.  We use the video out on the Kindle HD a lot while travelling so the kids can watch \"safe\" shows in hotels rather than risking the exposure to ^%&$ on hotel cable.  The HDX can employ a wireless device, but it has no mini HDMI out like the HD.  While the volume buttons on the HD were poorly positioned, at least you could reach them while holding the unit in it's case.  When using the Origami case with the HDX the buttons are covered.  So the HDX is faster, lighter, smaller, better screen, better UI, worse speakers, worse connectivity and buggy.  The HD is slightly heavier and larger, fantastic screen but not as good as the HDX.  But it's a 7\" screen...I'm still trying to figure out why anyone needs that high of resolution on a 7\" screen...but people want it on a 4.7\" phone so...  The HD has better speakers and connectivity.  For those interested, the HD can also be \"rooted\" without losing the Kindle UI or access to Prime instant video features.  As of the time of this review, \"rooting\" HDX has presented issues for those that don't REALLY know what their doing.  Of course I would never recommend doing this either way since it voids the warranty, but at least there are ways to get that other \"store\" on the HD without losing all the great Amazon features.  I would have liked the 8.9 tablet, but I think it is way too expensive when you can pick up a Nook HD+ for about 1/3 of the price.  It has the \"other\" lay store and is easily adapted via the SD card slot to access the Amazon app store.  Of course there's a reason it's priced that low...talk about a \"fire\" sale!  :)", "Title": "Eventually this will be a great tablet!", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Author": "Sarah Nickels", "ReviewID": "R3HDX7T69CF6D4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought 2 Kindle Fire HDX's as Christmas gifts for my 11yr old and 9yr old.

The 7\" is perfect for my travel needs--it's light enough to hold in one hand, the battery will easily last one day with very heavy use, and it's easy on the eyes as the screen/display is excellent.If you want portability and your needs are primarily email functions, browsing the internet, streaming media, using aps & playing games the HDX is hard to beat.", "Title": "For the Novice in all of us...or the non-technigeeks  :)", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Author": "MM", "ReviewID": "R2MYELZ83KV1TK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We love our Kindles more than our iPads!

You can also change the text background in your books for example. you can read on a black background with white letters and the blue glare goes away.

Further every tablet can download the kindle app or some type of e-reader app for books. The kindle tablet has limited access to the app market where android and apple are almost pretty equal. Amazon talks up a great game with this tablet, but I don't think it owns up to the price. Lastly I bought this to use almost as a portable laptop because I read you can VIEW Microsoft office documents. I first mis-read this for using Microsoft office. The kindle does not offer such a feature you can only simply view these things.

I believe this note is a recent addition, but it would've been easy to miss earlier. It's close to the top of the page and is under the heading We want you to know, followed by Learn more about design decisions to help make an informed purchase. This links to the following statement: \"We want you to know...The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" has perfect color accuracy (100% sRGB), and we wanted to share more details around our display design decisions that helped us achieve this.You may notice a very narrow, faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background, such as books or web pages. All displays have some level of light emission around the edges, and the light on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy. Most LCD displays use white LEDs, and then apply filters to extract the desired color. The result is oftentimes a compromise to tone and color accuracy, or--if attempting to address these compromises--an increase in battery consumption and, thus, device weight.We've taken a different approach. To achieve the perfect color accuracy on Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight, we used blue, not white, LEDs. Blue LEDs allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to 20% improvement in power efficiency.\"So amazon's official stance is that the glowing blue border results from deliberate design decisions and is therefore not a manufacturing defect. We'll all have to decide for ourselves whether this is true and that all subsequent HDXs will have the same effect.I'm giving this three stars because I think amazon should've warned people about the blue border in advance. I do otherwise like the HDX in comparison to my first gen Fire and would give it four stars. I'm going to spend the next couple of weeks deciding whether I'll become accustomed enough to the blue border to no longer notice it (this is already happening to some extent).", "Title": "Much to like; trying to get used to the glowing blue border", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1HBMKNEADWKAP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Amazon continues to attempt to make sure you have to buy audible books through their audible store by failing to write the code in this new kindle that would make it compatible with oneclick digital which is the app the public library system uses to provide audible books for free (lends them just like a library book).Now they could include in their description that the app will not work with this particular kindle version but than people might not buy the tablet.  After an hour of being shuffled, disconnected and otherwisw aggravated with \"customer service\" I was told that the app writers would have to change their app to make it compatible.  Unlike most free apps that run constant ads the one click digital app is provided by our public library who can ill afford to make those software changes each time kindle develops a new version of its tablet.  Since we know previous kindles have had the software written to make them compatible we also must logically conclude that they could continue to do so.  It does not take a genius to figure out why  the new hdx was made incompatible.  Shame on you for effectively eliminating many peoples ability to obtain audible content.  As there are many children's books available to lend out this is particularly disgusting.  As a parent would I prefer my kids listen to someome reading a good book or playing games or movies with zero educational benefit?

Shame on kindle.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Author": "FreeSpirit", "ReviewID": "R30LUQNCS0J30Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "QUICK SUMMARY - So far I think the Kindle Fire HDX is a great device given its performance, price point, and some really nice features though it is missing some features that would have been nice to have.1. FORM FACTOR - Compared to both the original Kindle Fire and the Fire HD, the HDX is lighter and thinner. Edges on the back are curved though not fully rounded, they still make it easy to grip the device. I can comfortably hold it in portrait mode in one hand between my thumb and palm and type with the other hand. The size and light weight makes it comfortable for one-handed reading for longer periods of time. There is a power button and volume +/- buttons on the back. The buttons are as easily accessible in landscape mode, but I'm still getting used to using them in portrait mode.2. SCREEN - This screen is the best in terms of resolution I have seen so far, sharper than its predecessors. There is no blurring of images or text under bright or dark background screens. Try pinch-zooming on an image, you will see that the integrity of the picture holds up pretty well despite zooming in real close. Reading e-books on this screen is easier on the eyes than reading on an iPad. I personally prefer to use my old e-ink Kindle to read books, but when traveling I plan to use the HDX. It doesn't strain the eyes as much as most other tablet screens that I have seen.3. SPEAKERS - I briefly compared speakers of the HD and HDX by playing the same song and maximizing the volume on both. The Fire HD's speakers were definitely louder when cranked up, but the difference was not significant. The speakers on the HDX however have better sound quality compared to the Mini for sure. That said, I personally don't buy tablets for their surround sound. I mostly use a tablet either with headphones or connected to a TV.4. STORAGE - I bought the 16GB version and I am already thinking I should probably upgrade to the 32GB. Of the 16GB, there is perhaps approximately 11-12GB available for end use, just an estimate - I could be off on this. This leaves little space if I want to store my entire music and video collection on the device, along with pictures and apps. For an extra $40, the 32GB is looking like a pretty good option. That being said, if you have most or all your collection stored on Amazon's Cloud Drive which you can stream to the HDX, the 16GB should be good.5. SPEED - The HDX is noticeably faster than the original Fire, and also feels improved over the Fire HD. Apps and videos load quicker. The most noticeable difference in speed is when browsing. Browsing on the Silk platform is smoother and less choppy. The difference is more evident when you go back from the HDX to browsing on an earlier generation Fire or another device.6. BATTERY - The HDX came with a micro-USB power charger! Advertised battery charging time is under 6 hours. Once fully charged, run time is said to be approximately 11 hours. Plenty for an average user like me, I use it probably 2-3 hours at most on any given day. This is supposed to have better battery life compared to that of its predecessor.7. CAMERA - The HDX 7\" version comes with a front facing camera only for Skype or other video calls. I tried the front camera briefly, picture quality seemed good for Skype calls. The 8.9\" however, comes with both a front and rear camera. I myself don't really use tablets to take pictures, I have my phone for that, but if you would really like to take pictures with this device, the 8.9\" would be the way to go.8. WITH OR WITHOUT SPECIAL OFFERS - I have always bought the Fires with special offers to save $15. Figured I always had the option of paying this amount later and removing the ads if they annoyed me. However, the ads appear only on the lock screen, which I don't look at any way, so it doesn't bother me at all. If ads on the lock screen annoy you or if you want a more personalized lock screen, you can simply pay the extra $15 and it goes away.SOME REALLY NICE FEATURES:The following features, in my opinion, are a game changer in favor of the Kindle Fire HDX:1. MAYDAY - A one-button tap gets you online with a live support agent within an advertised 15 seconds (swipe down on the time on top of the screen, MayDay button appears as one of the options). You can see the agent, but the agent can only hear you (though I think the agent should be able to see you if you fired up the front camera, but that's only if you want the agent to see you). The agent can take control of the device and help with any questions you may have. I tried this service once, connected in 15-20 seconds, agent walked me through trying to stream video through Apple TV (wasn't compatible). Audio and video quality was good, but I just found it weird looking at someone while getting support. Maybe it'll take getting used to, I guess I'm just so used to getting support over the phone.As of now, I'm not sure if the MayDay service is provided for the life of the device, or for the warranty period only, or if there's a charge for the service once the warranty expires. If someone familiar with this can post a comment, that would be very much appreciated.2. OFFLINE PRIME CONTENT - This is another really cool feature that has been added. Prime videos can be downloaded to the device for offline viewing - extremely useful for travelers when you don't have wireless coverage or wi-fi available! However, note that not all movies or shows can be downloaded - there are titles that are available only for online viewing. I guess this probably has to do with the studios and what titles they have agreed to make downloadable. Nevertheless, as long as I can download 4-6 hours of content for a flight, that is all I need! Once I return from a trip, I can simply delete the movies and download new ones. With this feature, a lower storage capacity device becomes more viable because I don't need to keep downloaded movies on it at all times. I can delete and add as I wish. This feature also helps save on wireless minutes. You can download a movie at home over Wi-Fi and play it on the road without spending 3G minutes to stream.3. SECOND SCREEN - This feature is expected to be available soon so I haven't had a chance to try it yet. With Second Screen, the Kindle screen can be mirrored on to your TV. From the description, it appears that the HDX does more than just mirroring - you can stream a movie to your TV and then use the HDX to check emails, browse the web, etc - basically you are free to use your tablet for anything while it is streaming to your TV. If this is true, this is a major step ahead of what most other tablets are capable of doing in this regard. With my iPad, I can only mirror the screen but I can't use it for anything else while it is streaming to my TV. I am excited to try out this new feature, will post an update once this feature is made available.Note - In order to stream to your TV, you will need a Smart TV or a compatible device like PS 3/4. If you don't have a TV or device that can connect wirelessly, you will need a Miracast dongle that plugs into your TV's HDMI port and can be set up on your wireless network to communicate with the HDX. I bought a dongle like this for around $100 a few years ago, but I think you can now find them here on Amazon for $40-50 (you can search for \"Miracast dongle\"). It is possible some devices are unable to connect because of their software or other compatibility issues. So for devices like say the Apple TV or Google Chromecast, if they are incompatible right off the bat, you can search online for apps that make them compatible with the HDX.4. FREETIME - This is a neat feature for families with kids, both in terms of time and content management. (i) Time - We have two boys and we try to keep tablet time in check (one hour each day Fri-Sun). Sometimes it's difficult to get them to let go when their time is up, and the ensuing battle never ends! With this feature, we have the option to set a time limit so the kids know automatically when their time is up. We also have the option of leaving a category like reading without a time limit. (ii) Content - We can basically create a sub-profile within the HDX and choose what content we want to be available in there. This is like creating a tablet within a tablet in some ways. Within the sub-profile, we can choose what games, apps, videos they can watch, and also change the backdrop to make it look like a kid's tablet. Very thoughtfully executed design.CONs:1. NO HDMI - The HDX no longer has the Micro HDMI port that last year's Fire HD came with. I thought this was a great feature to connect the device to TVs particularly when traveling. This also made it easier to connect the device to audio receivers to blast music through external speakers. With HDMI gone, you simply have to rely on wi-fi to connect to a TV. Most hotels are not equipped with smart TVs in rooms yet. So if you absolutely want to use the HDX to watch videos on your hotel room TV, you will need to carry the Miracast dongle as well. If the lack of HDMI is a deal breaker for you, I think last year's Fire HD might be the way to go.2. NO EXPANDABLE STORAGE - It would have been helpful if the HDX came with a memory card slot that could be used to play movies or content from an external storage device. This would leave the HDX storage itself open for apps and other content that must be stored on the tablet to be used. Also, expandable storage would mean that the 16GB version of the device would be good enough. However, if you have most content on Amazon's Cloud or have purchased volumes of movies/music from Amazon, lack of this feature shouldn't be an issue for you.3. NO GOOGLE PLAY APPS - Even though it runs on an Android platform, the HDX doesn't have access to Google Play which means the selection of apps available on the HDX is limited. That being said, it is fairly simple to install apps that are not otherwise available within the Amazon app store. You can run a Google search on \"how to add external apps (or Google Play apps) on Kindle Fire.\" It's pretty straightforward. I have found that the downloaded apps work great. Just remember to NOT root the Fire when installing these apps.4. 7\" HDX LACKS REAR CAMERA - The 7\" comes with only a front facing camera for video calls, it doesn't have a rear-facing camera. I personally don't need a rear camera on my tablet, but if you definitely need one, you can go for the 8.9\" which has both a front and rear facing camera.ACCESSORIES:1. CASE - I bought two cases with the device - the Amazon Origami case and the Marware Origin case. Origami - more stylish, functional, various stand positions, excellent quality, $50. Marware - inexpensive at $20, stand, basic frugal choice.2. SCREEN PROTECTOR - The Kindle screen is pretty good against scratches, but I have put a screen protector on regardless. I got the Marware screen protector - good quality and keeps the screen clear like there's nothing there.3. MIRACAST DONGLE - There are several adapters you can find here on Amazon. You will need this for streaming to your TV if you don't have a Smart TV or a compatible wireless device like PS3/4.4. CHARGERS - If you need to purchase additional chargers or cables, regular Micro-USB chargers/cables will work fine.BOTTOM LINE - Compared to the previous Kindle Fire versions and other tablets that I have used, the HDX is lighter, faster, has an excellent screen, and is loaded with some amazing features. All this for $229 makes the device a great choice. Whether or not to buy the HDX is entirely a personal decision. In my humble opinion, the choices:(i) If you have a recent tablet like say the Fire HD and are contemplating an upgrade, the upgrade may be worthwhile if you absolutely must have some of the new features (like Second Screen or offline Prime content).(ii) If the new features are not that meaningful for your purposes, it may be better to stay with your current device and wait for the next round of device releases.(iii) If this is the first tablet you are considering, scroll to the top and add to cart.", "Title": "Great performance and value", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "Sclark", "ReviewID": "RM5PVQMEOK68P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered the Kindle Fire HDX, based on all of the favorable reviews.  My only complaint is that the device is not secure, right out of the box.  While the Kindle may be great at what it is intended to do, I pretty much rejected it due to a lack of security and regard to my Amazon account.  I am writing this review as a word of caution to others who may order it:When you order the Kindle, Amazon will ask you if you want to pre-register it.  They are doing this as there were many complaints of registrations failing after customers received the device, so they pre-register it for you before shipping, to cut down the amount of calls to their support.  The bad part of this is that, straight out of the box, you can click on \"Shop Amazon\" and go straight into your account.  The app, or the Kindle itself, does not ask for your credentials.  What this means is that my Kindle could have been mis-delivered, someone could have opened the box, powered on the Kindle, and had immediate access to my Amazon account (settings, Order History....everything).  I was even able to go shopping and could have made purchases, all without being prompted for my account credentials.Even with a passcode lock on the device, once registered and accessed, the Kindle prompts you no further for your Amazon credentials.  For some folks this might be OK, but for others who loan their Kindle to their kids, friends, or are just plain security conscious, this may be an issue for them.

Bought the Kindle DX, then upgraded to the Kindle HD last year and purchased Amazon prime for the Prime streaming of TV and movies. So when they announced the new HDX would allow for downloading prime movies and TV shows I thought it would be fantastic. I use the Kindle for reading alot and also for watching the movies and TV episodes while exercising. So I thought with the new HDX and being able to download the prime TV/movies, it would be perfect for those hotels which have very poor wifi in the fitness room and I could also watch movies/TV on the plane.Well, watching the movies and TV shows are much better than the HD, but it comes at a cost, and to me it's a big cost. The reading experience on the new HDX is terrible. The blue/purple line is definitely noticeable, not only when reading but also on anything with a white background, including email and web pages. This is not actually a major problem for me but I can see how some people would find it distracting. My major issue with the HDX is the color of the backgrounds while reading. As noted in some previous reviews, the black background is not black, it's grey but my biggest problem is the white background. It's not white, it's off white/light yellow. When comparing to an iPhone/iPad and even the previous HD, it definitely has a yellow tint. The fact that it's a little bit of a yellow background wouldn't be such a big deal, but it's blotchy. Most of the screen will be a yellowish color while there are small sections that are the bluish white color. I notified Amazon of this and they sent me out a new one but the new one was actually worse than my original. The \"blotchiness\" was larger and the yellow color was more noticeable. Plus, the blue/purple color was more noticeable as well. I also went to Best Buy to look at the HDXs and the yellow color was on those as well. This yellow color in a lighted environment is subdued, but when you're reading at night in bed with the lights off, the yellow color and blotchiness is very noticeable.Another disappointment is the battery power. The battery doesn't last anywhere near as long as the HD. As I said, I read alot and before with the HD I could go weeks without having to recharge which was great with the amount I travel so I wouldn't have to bring the cords because I could just recharge back at home. However, with the HDX, I have to recharge every 3-4 days which means I have to bring the cords with me when I travel.The Mayday feature is NOTHING like they show on TV. The video is not very clear and the audio is very delayed. The service reps also don't know anything other than telling you to reset the device and then if that doesn't work, someone will call you back on the phone, thereby not even using the Mayday feature.Also, the screen on the HDX is no better in the sun than the HD, which I was led to believe it would be better. Not sure if this was a misunderstanding on my part, but it's not better than the HD. In comparison with the iPad (mini), the iPad is way better to read in the sun and I don't mean just a little better, but way better.I'm just very disappointed. I've never had any problems with Amazon before but it just seems they didn't think things through on the HDX. The Kindle has always been a great reading device, so it seems they wanted to improve the viewing experience for games and movies/TV to be better than Apple. But they did it at the expense of the reading experience, which is a big disappointment for those of us that like to read.I could continue asking for new HDXs, but what's the point? I've already seen 4 and they've all had this problem, and the replacements could be worse than the original like my one replacement already was. Do I go back to the HD? If I do that I lose the ability to download the prime TV/movies which is a great feature. Do I get a Kindle paper white for reading? Well, then I have to carry 2 tablets with me which is ridiculous. Should I purchase the 8.9 inch which supposedly doesn't have some of these issues? Well, the 8.9 inch is bigger, bulkier, heavier and more expensive and space/weight is a premium with the amount I travel. Do I begin using my iPad mini? Then again I lose the ability of the prime downloading. So I guess I'll keep the original HDX and hope Amazon addresses the reading issues on the next upgrade, but with the way they've been responding with these issues on the HDX, it seems like they don't think the issues are a problem.So, if you'll primarily use the 7 inch HDX for gaming, and viewing videos, you'll probably really enjoy it. However, if you plan to read a lot on the HDX, this is probably not the device for you.", "Title": "Disappointing", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer \"jlambert1982\"", "ReviewID": "RML3THOX9TJ06", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:The size.  I have an original iPad and an 8.9 Fire HD from last year.  I never thought I'd be want the smaller size, but this is perfect.  I no longer play games on my phone, b/c this thing is easy enough to carry around I take it everywhere.  In fact, if I didn't use my phone's hotspot to give this thing connectivity I would consider dropping my phone all together and using this thing to make calls from.The screen.  This thing looks amazing.  A co-worker has the new iPad Air. Side by side we both think this little guy blows it out of the water.  We pull up the same images from google and it is easy to see the difference.The performance.  My biggest complaint about the 8.9 Kindle Fire HD was that it was laggy.  Pulling up apps would take too long compared to my Galaxy S 4 or my son's iPod touch.  Apps would crash before they opened.  Videos would stall between clicking play and the video actually playing.  This little powerhouse has eliminated almost all of that.  Apps still crash, but I'll get to that later.Cons:Storage.  I live on a farm.  Beyond satellite and cell coverage I have no options for high speed internet.  I do get LTE where I live, but that is on a limited basis, and my satellite broadband has a data cap as well.  It would be nice to download season's of television while I am at work or travelling and store them on my device.  64GB seems like a lot, but between apps, books, audiobooks, and HD video, it still fills up fast.  A 128GB version would have been worth it to me.Video output.  On my Kindle Fire HD I could bring an HDMI cable with me wherever I went, and as long as there was free HDMI input on the television, I could watch my videos.  Now I have to watch through my PS3 (which I could already do with Amazon Instant Video) or the newer Samsung televisions (but not my 2011 55 inch LED).  Kind of frustrating.  Even my kid's iPod Touch has HDMI out with an adapter.App availability.  I love Amazon App Store.  It is a lot easier to navigate than Google Play, and you don't have the multitude of worthless apps.  However, there are tons of apps that I use on my phone that just are not available through Amazon.  I use Google Voice to check voicemails and send messages.  While I can do that through the Silk browser, why can't I have that option?  Everyone I know who owns a Kindle Fire has their own personal complaint about an app they can't use.Summary:I love my HDX.  To me, this is the perfect size for a tablet, and this thing performs like a monster.  It has replaced all my other tablets.  I still have a very large library of movies and TV shows in iTunes, and it continues to grow b/c of my wife's love of her iPhone and my kid's reliance on their iPods, so I can't just shut down my iTunes account yet.  For me personally, however, I'll never have to use iTunes again.  Everything this device is supposed to do, it does great.  It is a great e-reader.  It is a great video player.  It is a great music player.  I started reading comics again when I bought the 8.9 inch Fire HD last year because of how great that device was for the comic book format.  The 7 inch HDX is just as good.  Note taking, game playing, time killing.....You name it, this device does it.Right now I don't know who I wouldn't recommend this to.  Thinking about spending 150 bucks on your kids and buying them a LeapPad Ultra?  Spend the extra money up front and get them a device that is worth the money in the long run.  Between the free apps and device quality, that is a no brainer.Have grandparent who watches old TV channels and reads books?  Give them this and tell them to pay for Prime, and cancel their cable bill.My only complaints are minor.  I knock off one star because I don't like the idea of being locked into their ecosystem of apps.  That is very Apple of them, and while I understand the business to it, I still don't appreciate it.  If I could make any improvements, I wish Amazon would let me import my library of videos from iTunes to their cloud like they did my music.  If they could make that happen, I would be a fully converted form .mac fanboy.Buy without hesitation if you are a Prime member or just starting your digital video library.  I would hesitate slightly if I had thousands invested in iTunes videos and apps, but even then, for $230, it may be worth it just to see if you like it better.", "Title": "Very Impressive", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R398UH9UFG0YA1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've previously owned one other tablet -- the iPad 1.

With the Nexus 7 or iPad, there is less emphasis on \"buying stuff\" and more emphasis on \"doing stuff\" (e.g. a less commercial experience).Still, for the price ($179 on Cyber Monday), I can't complain too much.  I will say, though, that depending on the promotion at the time, if the Nexus 7 and Kindle HDX are the same price, I'd probably actually prefer the Nexus 7 for a more traditional tablet experience.

Amazon pushed me to Google movies and other tablets with business features.However, the new ability to download for no additional cost much of its Prime content for off line viewing for up to 30 days for each downloaded movie/show and the new wireless video display via Miracast was too much to pass up, or at least try.Incidentally, I bought the new Nexus 7 at the same time but returned it because you can not stream movies download to the unit.  One is required to delete the saved Google purchased movie from the unit and stream via the internet.  GO FIGURE.  Im not required to do this with my other android tablet.  FYI, you have to perform the os upgrade for the Nexus 7 to stream.I bought the 16GB, 7 inch HDX.  I did not notice the purple hazing some have reported.  Sixteen gigs seems to be okay because you have the option of what quality movie you download.  I think I will be able to save 15 movies or so, more than enough for a weekend.The display is excellent, the unit charges rather quickly and battery life good so far.I used a Netgear Push2TV to connect wirelessly to the TV.  It works great even without the latest Netgear update.  I didnt even notice a lag.  Only gripe is you have to enter into settings, then display and then connect, versus other units have a mirror connect when you swipe down the notifications.  You can disconnect more easily.NOTE OF CAUTION IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE CONNECTING:  All of these Netgear Push 2TV 3000's are not created equal.  I have three of these units, two that I have had awhile and connect to WIDI, though I have given up WDii and Windows 8, but wont connect to Miracast.

I can honestly say that there is no other tablet that provides the value for the cost.Screen: 5 out of 5In order to really appreciate the screen, you need to download at \"best quality\" an hd show or movie from amazon prime. Then you need to compare it to an hd video on another tablet. The screen color and clarity is absolutely amazing.Sound: 5 out of 5Coming from an Apple device owner, I never expected much for sound quality from tablets until I got the kindle fire hdx. The sound is crystal clear and loud! I don't quite understand how it works because I have tried covering the sound ports but the sound is still loud like it may be coming from around the screen as well. Try it, you will be impressed.Build Quality: 5 out of 5You can tell that this tablet has a magnesium frame built in. There is zero flex when holding or moving the tablet around. Compared to the Nexus 7 which also has a rubberized grip, you can tell that the nexus 7 is plastic and the kindle is metal on the inside. The build quality rivals the iPad mini.Processing: 5 out of 5Phenomenal speed doing any task you can imagine. Everything is instant with no delay at all. Loading up videos on youtube is much faster than on an iPad, which is most likely due to the dual antenna wifi for the kindle hdx. There is zero stutter playing hd games like Fifa Soccer 14 and watching 1080p videos.Battery Life: 5 out of 5This was the one aspect I expected to suffer being that it is an android based device. Battery life never seems to live up to what the manufacturer claims because android seems to just drain the battery. I have been using the device for a couple days and so far, it really does live up to the claims. After watching several hours of video I still find the battery life around 80%. Charging is also quick. I expect that it will only take a couple hours to go from 0% to 100% charged.Overall: 5 out of 5This is THE tablet to own for 2013-2014. Amazon has set the price of the kindle fire hdx to dominate the tablet market. Unlike other tablets such as the nexus 7, the kindle fire hdx doesn't sacrifice build quality to bring the cost down.

It's screen is sharp and the color rendering is very good so reading books and watching movies you rent, buy or get free as an Amazon prime member is a very good experience.  Thus, if you can live within that construct I think you will be happy.My problem was I wanted it to do more, and there's where it gets smoked by the admittedly far more expensive but also admittedly far more capable iPad min retina and also the similarly priced Nexus 7.  I found I needed my tablet to do some serious internet surfing, but folks, let's be honest, Silk may have improved over time but it's still arguably the worst browser out there.  It is slow, clunky, and struggles to render accurately many websites I visit.  And yes I did install the Dolphin bowser-not as straight forward a task as I'd hoped-and it's better than Silk but still weak compared to surfing on an iPad mini or a Nexus 7.Then there is the Amazon app market, or lack thereof more accurately.  The apps are poor in their number and often horrendous in their quality when compared to the Apple app store or Google play.  Yes, yes I know you can root the HDX and access Google Play, but if you're going to go to all that trouble why not just buy an equally affordable and very more capable Nexus 7 running stock Android?Finally, I have to say the stability of the Fire OS based on archaic the Android Jelly Bean version the HDX uses is bug ridden and ineptly designed and almost forces you to root it just so you can install an updated Android OS and dump the pitiful carrousel launcher for something far better.So, if you can live within the HDX's limited role of consuming Amazon media I think you will be happy, but the moment you try to go beyond that I think you'll envy anyone with an iPad mini or Nexus 7.", "Title": "It is what it claims to be and if you can live within its limitations it's fine.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Author": "Vinny", "ReviewID": "R16X1M58ZS7AM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are expecting the Mayday button: Prime: Movies: Share your screen: print functionality (for now) to name a few for Kindles bought through the .au Amazon store then you won't get them.

Every one that I have ever seen reviewed had this same issue. I figured that \"they\" were all being picky.  No sir, it was horrible.  I couldnt watch movies either because on any screen that was white, there was that blue tint.  In the end I returned it and am now using the first gen HD7.

Cook", "ReviewID": "R2XQWM0FEHYNPA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this Kindle as a Christmas gift for my spouse.  I usually do very thorough research before ordering online but I messed up on this one.  With all the hype about the HDX, I assumed it would include GPS.  My lowly ASUS has it so why wouldn't the much hyped HDX?  Otherwise, it has some nice features but I just have a hard time getting past this major shortcoming.  The video is very good, audio is better than on the ASUS but I prefer headphones to the built in speakers on any tablet.  Processing speed is pretty good but perhaps the most impressive feature is the \"Mayday\" live help.  I've only needed it a couple of times but when you need it, it's there and I was very impressed with the quick response time and the knowledge of the operator.Not a big deal to me but another standard feature on my ASUS Transformer that's missing here is an HDMI connection.  It does have Bluetooth. Wireless is a little stronger than the ASUS. This tablet also lacks a memory card slot and a rear facing camera, both of which are included on the ASUS Transformer.Other than the lack of GPS, the most irksome thing is that you're pretty much locked into Amazon for content.  Many things I would get for free on Google are not free or not available on Amazon. Oh, and did I mention, unless you get the more expensive 4G version, THIS UNIT DOES NOT HAVE GPS?!  GRRRR!  The ASUS GPS works without a wireless connection as long as you load your maps and select your route while connected to a network and keep the tablet powered up.  Even if you have the 4G version of the HDX, I would not assume that GPS will work without a 4G connection.  Otherwise, why would GPS only be available with 4G?Revision 3/27/14: The Bluetooth is picky about what it will pair with. Can't connect with my Samsung mobile headset. It is also extremely picky about wired headphone jacks. Some work sporadically but many don't work at all. Some only get mono even though they give me stereo with other devices (like my computer or my ASUS tablet). So far the only headset I've found that works reliably and really well is a (fairly pricey) Sony Walkman in-ear headset with headband.  I've also had my first poor experience with Mayday since I first posted my review. It took a very long time to finally be told that the tablet is not compatible with my Samsung Bluetooth headset. To sum up, I don't doubt this device is very good for reading books but that's not what I bought it for. It's pretty adequate for web browsing but lacks several features that are standard on many if not most Android tablets, many of which are less expensive. If I had it to do over I'd probably opt for the smaller (less expensive) companion to my ASUS Transformer.", "Title": "No GPS?!

I'm so sick of searching message boards every time I have a problem with an electronic device or electronic service of some sort.  When web-based technology works well, it is amazingly convenient, but when there is a problem with something you've come to depend on, it is so hard to get help.  Especially with a 2 year old tugging at your...everything.  However, the Mayday feature of my new kindle is fantastic.  To have a person who can hear your voice answer your questions immediately, and solve your issue within seconds is just invaluable to this busy mom.  No more email back and forth conversations with customer service reps that didn't read the entirety of my message or didn't answer my question fully, necessitating a problem solving session lasting for days.  A person and a voice that can respond immediately is a breath of fresh air.  I would have given the Kindle HDX 3 or 4 stars before using Mayday (mostly because I prefer the Mac look but and feel and probably should have bought an ipad mini) but this service is just so impressive and beats having to go to a genius bar and wait in line for 45 minutes or more that I'm completely sold on the Kindle.", "Title": "Mayday feature is un-freaking-believable", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Author": "Eva \"Eva\"", "ReviewID": "R1UIHN524VIQII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love it!

I did a LOT of research before I made my purchase and decided that this Kindle was the best fit for me. I was not disappointed!There are a few drawbacks:1. No SD card slot so on-board memory is all you get. This isn't a problem for me, since I don't have a whole lot of apps and cloud storage is available. (LOVE the cloud storage!!)2. Google apps are not supported. Reportedly people have gotten them to work on their Kindle but I wasn't able to get them going. I adapted - I get my Gmail via browser and use an alternate mapping app.3. Battery life isn't quite what I'd like, but manageable.Now for the pros:1. The size and weight is just right. It is comfortable to use - even hours on end like I do2. Clear, sharp images. I was quite impressed by how good things look on the Kindle Fire3. Cloud storage so if you get overloaded with apps or books, you can save them to the cloud for later retrieval4. A wide variety of apps will run on the Kindle Fire, ranging from games to Office apps.Once I got the Kindle Fire, I realized that I'd underestimated how much I'd use it. I not only use it for reading (which I do a lot!), but I also have Skype on it, several games, and a bunch of work-related applications. I use it to do some work-related tasks when it's not convenient to be at my computer. With the apps I've collected, I can do all of my work - even work that requires VPN -  on the Kindle - it's that good!I'll admit that the Kindle Fire is not for everyone. If you are expecting a full-blown tablet, you may not like this. It's total overkill if all you want to do is read books. If you absolutely MUST have the SD card slot or MUST run Google apps, then you should look elsewhere.

Hockenbarger", "ReviewID": "R2QWZOMX7VK7Y6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for myself.  I love this tablet.  I've got multiple other tablets in the house for use by the 7 kids who have all but abandoned television to watch YouTube and other streaming media technologies, so I'm not new to tablet technology by any stretch of the imagination.The hardware is great. I wasn't sure about the 7\" size, but have found that I love it.  I certainly think larger tablets have their place, but the convenience of the 7\" form factor is really nice for media consumption (reading books and magazines, watching streaming video, etc.).  It fits in the hand easily, and for smaller kids the lighter weight and smaller size makes it easier for them to use when I want to loan it to one of the littler ones.  Battery life is okay, I went from full charge to around 60% after watching three TV show episodes back to back.  The display is crisp, colors bright; blacks could be a little deeper, but it's a 7\" tablet not a 4K TV!  Sound is good, but I still question why the only vendor on the planet that gets that you should put speakers on the front of the device is HTC.  This is SUCH a no-brainer and if you want the strongest possible device for media consumption, put the speakers on the front!  That aside, the back-side speakers are pretty effective and sound is crisp with a pretty good range.I like the fact the system has 5GHz WiFi, my other tablets are all 2.4GHz, so bumping up out of that spectrum was nice, especially for streaming performance.The skin on top of Android is one of the better ones I've seen, certainly better than Asus or Samsung's skins (but I haven't gotten an opportunity to play with the MagazineUX yet, which is similar to Windows tiles which I really like).  I'd like to see more configurability for the carousel.  I haven't quite figured out the logic behind how things get added to or removed from it.  For example I view a Prime Instant Video and it shows up in the carousel, but after I pause it and look at something else, it pulls it out.  I'd like to pin Prime IV to the carousel permanently, and I don't see a way to do that.Of course having access to all the ebooks I've been reading via the Kindle app on my phone is awesome, and my wife loves the Newsstand feature.One nit about the software is that it doesn't interface properly to my Prime Instant Video, particularly my Watchlist.  For some reason it isn't reading that properly, so it doesn't see that I've got all the seasons of Doctor Who, for example queued up for viewing in my Watchlist like it does if I log into the website.  Again, a nit.The main reason this doesn't get 5 stars is actually a huge issue to me.  Not having Google Play access is almost a show-stopper.  The refusal of Amazon to work with Google and play in the ecosystem relegates the Fire to a media interface device, and it cannot become my primary tablet device.  So instead of going into my backpack when I travel on business, it sits on my bedside table for media viewing and reading at night, because my larger Samsung tablet can do everything the Kindle does and more, albeit in a larger and heavier device.  The Amazon app store is simply deficient and weak compared to Google Play, and there are a LOT of apps I use that are not available, particularly around system administration.  Of course not having the native Google apps is a big kludge, especially for a person who has carried an Android phone for years, has multiple Android tablets, and is a big fan of that ecosystem.  Even Samsung understands that not allowing the native Android apps is a bad thing, and while they push their custom versions of things, still allow you to use Google Play.  If Amazon decided to go 10\" or so on a tablet, I wouldn't buy it for this reason alone.  Since I'm a geek, I don't mind having multiple devices, but for friends and family that want a single device for things beyond media consumption, I cannot recommend the Fire.  For non-technical users who want nothing BUT media consumption, the device rocks.And yes, I know I can sideload or I could root, but I don't want to have to go to that effort across multiple devices just to get proper Android access.Overall a very nice tablet implementation.", "Title": "REALLY nice, but not a viable option as a single tablet device...", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Author": "Cindy Clark", "ReviewID": "R1ZA72FAD48COE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After owning several tablets,cheap to rated the best.

This Fire HDX... not so much.  For one,  the reading screen is difficult.  The black of words just seems to fade into background.  I can't seem to get a comfortable reading screen.  Since receiving this at Christmas, I have not read at all on this device; I have only done emails, the web and games.  Reading screen hurts my eyes.

One of the first things I tried to do was download the User Guide - so far, I have been unsuccessful - it has simply taken too long and it times-out. It seems reasonable that there should be an easier (faster) way.  While I am computer \"literate\", it has been slow finding my way around all that the HDX offers.One of the reasons I selected the HDX was the availability of the Skype App.  When I installed it, however, Skype advised that they were blocking my account - because of a break-in that occurred in 2010. Everything was resolved by Skype and my bank, and I have been using Skype on my desktop ever since.  Working with Skype to unblock my account was endlessly frustrating.A minor point. I have used Every Word: Crossing on a previous Kindle.  I expected to use it on the HDX. However, after searching the Kindle website, I finally determined it was not compatible with the HDX. Subsequently, I purchase (it was free) the App Every Word - and received confirmation.  However, it was never delivered.  Your helpful tech determined that (again) it was not compatible with the HDX.  Not a crises - just a bit irritating.I have not yet used the Amazon Assist feature yet - but I think the offering is excellent.In one of the reviews I read before selecting the HDX, the reviewer commented that the On/Off button was in an awkward place - I agree.Thank you for the opportunity to comment.", "Title": "My Comment", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Author": "murray johnson", "ReviewID": "R1RS3YKKPJ40QA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just wanted to give a little praise to the Mayday people.

The product came with the standard usb/wall charger and nothing more, but you don't need anything else. After registering the device it was good to go. The quality is superb, transitioning between apps and things are easy and fluid, and it even has a headphone jack so you can hear media in peace or without disturbing others. The only thing my mother wanted, though, was to play Papa Pear Saga and it isn't compatible with the Kindle Fire.All in all this product was more than enough for my mother. She was happy with the product and I was happy to see my mother happy. The only thing I didn't like, which has nothing to do with the product itself, was that Amazon had the May-Day $30 off Kindle's sale right after I ordered it so I kinda missed out on a greater deal.

Purchased Google Nexus 7 Second Generation. Returned it  Purchased Samsung Note 8 for an amazing $225 from Staples because of coupons and store discounts. No rebates to wait for.

The display screen resolution is incredibly sharp and the \"READING VIEW\" is a true joy when I'm reading digital media such as CNN and MSN.

The processing speed and memory are among the best for 7\" tablets.  The screen is fantastic, and even the sound from the speakers is impressive.  Another great feature is the ability to view Prime Instant Video.  Access to free movies and TV shows (some of them are even downloadable for off-line viewing) is an added bonus of having an Amazon Prime subscription.The tablet is also great for kids, or individuals who aren't very tech savvy.  Its very intuitive to use, and the parental controls are fantastic--even allowing parents to set a designated period of time that their kids can play with the device.  If you are a parent, someone who is looking for an easy-to-use device, or someone that simply wants to watch videos, read books, and play simple games, then the HDX might be your tablet.However, I was looking for a more traditional Android experience and I just couldn't get past the Fire's heavily modified Android operating system.  First, the operating system offers very few customization options.  For example, you cannot change the background screen, have access to widgets, or customize/organize your home screen as you would for other Android devices.  I also use the Swiftkey Keyboard on my Android smartphone, which has helped productivity when sending text/email, however, the keyboard on the HDX cannot be changed and Swiftkey is not available for the HDX in the Amazon Appstore.The real nail in the coffin for me was the inability to access Google services.  This means you won't have access to the Google Play store, which has a vastly improved app selection over Amazon's Appstore.  You also cannot access Google Hangouts which I use frequently for text/chat messages as well as video calls and videoconferencing.  Further, I use Google's Chromecast to stream video to my television. The Chromecast app is unavailable on the HDX.The tradeoff of purchasing another Android device over the HDX is the inability to use the Prime Instant Video.  Amazon has provided an Prime Instant Video app for Apple devices, but has not (and I suspect will not) produce one for other Android devices.  I'm not going to lose any sleep over this because I didn't find the selection of free movies and TV to be all that impressive.  The selection of free movies that were downloadable to the device for off-line viewing was even less impressive.  Most of my video viewing on the tablet was through HBO Go, Hulu+, or Netflix.All in all, the HDX is a decent tablet with great hardware that unfortunately stumbles on its software.  If Amazon were to offer a Kindle device with the same hardware, but with a more traditional Android software experience with a slight Amazon spin (a la the Samsung Galaxy Tablets), I would certainly be willing to pay a higher price for the device.", "Title": "Fantastic Hardware, Handcuffed by Inferior Software", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Author": "fearn0evil", "ReviewID": "R2CIX400A3M8VY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Its alright.

The Send To Kindle app is such a neat thing, I've been able to send documents straight from my Mac to the Kindle over wifi, which is so simple and genius. The only thing I haven't figured out quite yet is if the battery always drains as fast, or if there are apps running the background and I'm just not sure how to turn them off completely. It's a simple thing to do on my iPad Mini. Between the Mini and the Kindle I prefer the interface of the Mini, but the size and screen of the Kindle.

I think we have to put all these tablets in perspective. I also have a 8.9\" Nook HD+. So, much as been said about the Kindle that I had to buy one to see for myself is it all that it is said to be. I like the Kindle because of its size and portability. One of the main reasons that I can really enjoy my Kindle is because it has been rooted. This means that not only do I have access to Amazon content, I also have access to the Google PlayStore. This is important to me in order to be able to enjoy ownership of a Kindle.With it being rooted I can enjoy both worlds. The Kindle is a fantastic tablet, but in my opinion only if it is rooted. I don't like proprietary software and if you keep it with Amazon's offers, ecosystem it gets really boring quick. I am a Prime and Netflix member, so this tablet is great. I am able to fit it inside my purse and travel with it with no problem. However, the only reason I can enjoy it to this point is because it is rooted. It is a beautiful tablet and I really like everything it can do.Pros: affordability, portability, fast and efficient software (speedy), beautiful display resolution, versatile (if able to root), impressive device (makes me want the 8.9\" just can't justify the purchase since I have a Nook of the same size)Cons: no way to expand memory, no HDMI ouptput, proprietary software, having to pay to stop special offers", "Title": "Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 64 GB - Includes Special Offers", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Author": "Barbie", "ReviewID": "R13C13DT45WADG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Beautiful display, lightweight, no problems with using it immediately.

I also have saved pdf docs of patterns and tutorials on it. My HDX works beautifully, in the standing case, on my jewelers bench for various metalworking guides and for offline use.In my kitchen, the HDX is  a recipe book,  with recipes from the internet via wifi as well as files saved offline.Basic Pros -- The images & sounds are  crisp and clear,  which is a significant improvement over the original Kindle Fire.- Easy to use & navigate for the slightly less tech savvy (I'm an art geek not a techno geek and comfortable with Apple products.)- Kid friendly, my 2 yr old niece and 8 yr old nephew enjoyed an interactive story on it as well as the usual kid games and apps.- A lot (1000's) of free Kindle books, lower priced reads, samples, and the Prime lending library for a monthly freebie.Basic Cons --My 64gb 7\" model doesn't  have  a rear facing camera but it's not enough of a con to knock a star off. I use a DSLR for my art pics and my iPhone 5s for my out-and-about snapshots, so using the HDX for an occasional selfie or web chat is  great.-The battery life isn't as good as it was on the old original Kindle Fire. Since this version does a lot more, it makes sense, and because I charge it daily.  I don't have issues with it dying on me in the middle of activity.- Overall this Amazon addict is pleased! -My  new lightweight Kindle goes everywhere with me.

He gave me the option of a Kindle or an iPad so I choose Kindle because I wanted something different; we have a few Apple products already. Unfortunately when I received the Kindle, there was an issue with the volume buttons on the back. They only worked half of the time. When they did work they were kind of glitchy and the times that they did not work, well, you would push the buttons numerous times and absolutely nothing would happen. So Amazon kindly sent me a replacement. Once again, this Kindle had a problem as well (maybe I have horrible luck?). This time the area that should have displayed AT&T; 4G and the signal bars read \"INVALID SIM\". It would not work. So I went to AT&T; and got a new sim card and it still did not work. I returned both Kindles and decided to not receive a third.Things I did like about the Kindle: I liked the size. I didn't really want a big tablet so the size of the 7 inch was perfect. I liked the back side of the Kindle. The iPad's back are metal so I see them as being more likely to slip out of your hands but the kindle's back made for a better grip. I like the display. Also, the speakers on the back of the kindle were great! It has a nice surround sound like quality.Things I did not like: the hardware issues.Overall, the Kindle itself was nice but problems with the hardware were not okay. I did not want to keep having replacements shipped to me until I found one that worked 100 percent.

So, I'll share my experience with that part in case it could be useful for someone else looking for that functioanlity.I had this for few weeks, and basically can echo many other reviewers. Excellent build quality, display, Amazon apps. If you're planning to use this device just to shop, read, watch videos on Amazon (on Kindle display) I doubt you could find anything else even close. However, if you want to output the display or sound content to an external device like a TV it all starts to go downhill. I want to highlight these issues since I could not find any details on the web (except very few).For some reason, Amazon does not provide apps such as \"Pioneer Control App\" and \"Panasonic Remote 2\". These are essential for me to control my TV and receiver from Kindle, so I could use them as a workaround for at least playing my own music/video library. To make matters worse, there's no other display output (like DLNA, through the home network). Kindle does not have an HDMI port, and the USB port does not work as a \"Slim Port\". So, I tried the \"Kindle Certified\" NetgearPush2TV. A real dissapointing experience. I wrote a separate review for that. Apparently Amazon tech support (and Netgear support) does not know much about this (I spoke with at least 4 agenrts, if I remember correctly). All Amazon agents were great, but couldn't help. So, if you plan to use the Kindle for the following then you'll be dissapointed:1. Play music from Kindle to your networked (aka connected) receiver2. Play videos (from internet/Amazon Instant Videos and from your own library) from Kindle to a networked TV3. GPS (e.g. with CoPilot) --- Kindle does not have a GPS, which I realized after buying. My bad, not whining hereA modern high-end device like Kindle should provide this sort of basic functionality, in my opinion. I was surprised to learn these limitations (the hard way). There are apps for this sort of thing (e.g. Flips/iMediaShare) but they're far from perfection with many limitations. I tried very hard to keep the Kindle and find workarounds for the limitations mentioned above but I could not. So I had to return it.Since then I bought a Nexus 7. Only problem I have is that Amazon does not allow it to access Instant videos (I knew this before I bought it but still weird, because I can use any other device and don't see how Amazon makes money by blocking it. Kindle is really cheap, so, also hard to understand how they make lot of money by selling the hardware. So, I'm confused but there must be some reason other than just Amazon/Google rivarly). I don't watch videos very often (but my son takes care of that for me with his Kindle) so it's not a huge isue for me at this point.Again, you need to read this review very carefully since I did not attempt to highlight lot of good aspects of the device since others have already mentioned those; if the extra networking/navigation/output functionality is not needed for you then the Kindle is an excellent device.", "Title": "Great device but lacking output/apps for external devices (TV, Receiver)", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Author": "Christine Hill", "ReviewID": "R1LCMZ4NGI3WY0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first tablet I've ever owned so I can't really compare it to anything else out there on the market but I am enjoying my Kindle a lot.

I use this primarily for reading, watching videos and movies, and occasionally surfing the web, so nothing terribly extensive. It suits my needs just fine, at a lower price point and makes me feel like getting an iPad would just be overkill for me. I purchased mine with the adds included and honestly it's not a big deal. They're not intrusive with whatever I might be doing on the tablet and if it bothered me that much I would just pay the $15 to have them removed. There are some deals that are exclusive to kindle fire owners which is pretty awesome and since I use amazon quite often for purchases, I don't mind a chance at snagging a good deal. There are plenty of apps to pick from (for my purposes anyway) like Facebook, Youtube, and a few games here or there. It's lightweight and easy to hold for reading while lounging around in bed and the movies I've watch show up in beautiful quality.

As a 5th year student I really didn't want to (nor could I afford) a new laptop that will be replaced by a professional computer in a year or so. So, I thought on black Friday why not try for $180. I own the 2012 kindle fire and thought it was this seemed to be a good choice. I got a Bluetooth keyboard for this to make it a \"real laptop\", because I mainly write essays and it does well. I like this new kindle so far. I can type with a Bluetooth keyboard on word apps which helps a lot for the normal college student. I am not a tech geek or anything, just needed something to get me by for the last school year. I had a normal 15\" laptop then a netbook that both died out in college so I really didn't want another expensive computer and this is a good replacement. I don't plan on this being a forever replacement and I don't think other people should either. I use it to type and play games on it. The kindle is really thin which I love. At first I was hesitant because I was fine with the 2012 fire but I needed something better to write essays on. Now I think this is new one is fine. Overall, if your looking for a basic tablet that can do things like write in polaris app (or in king soft, whatever) and play app games this does very well. If your looking for a tablet that is more photo sharing, personal details, bigger screen, etc this may not be for you. I haven't had a problem with it and advise a person to get Prime with it, you can download movies and watch them without internet (great feature).Down sides:Yes it's a kindle, you can't have a screen photo and they're adds but for the normal person thats not much a bothersome.The power button and a volume button are on the back of it. I find it a hard transition coming from old fire to the new one. It beats me why they'd put them on the back. I find the power button on back a little bit of an annoyance but new fire users may not. This also makes it an issue because if you have an old kindle fire you'll need to buy a whole new case and NO OTHER KINDLE FIRE CASES WILL FIT IT! (You have to specifically buy an HDX one). I bought one thinking they would but nope. Normal CASES cover the power button on back; I still use the non-fitting case because I don't want to spend more money on a case.It is only 7\", no surprise there. But it is on the tiny side for tablets. I didn't mind in on the 2012 kindle fire and I don't now. If you have a giant cell phone it may seem odd because they're close in size but I don't have a high tech phone so this really doesn't bother me.This version does have a front facing camera, I don't know how many MP. I can't seem to find that info (but I haven't searched that hard). I tried it out and it's okay, prob like 3MP or so.", "Title": "For a college student", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Author": "L.

It sounds cool on their site to have it anyway...but....they're just advertisements on the lock screen that take up the whole page.  Soo...instead of microtransactions inside of an app to get rid of ads, you have to pay $50 more to not have these on your lock screen.  Not cool Amazon...not cool.EDIT: I purchased this on a Black Friday sale, to clarify, it is no longer $50 difference in the devices for the ad/non-ad ones, but at the time, one was on a large sale and the other wasn't...making it a large price difference.Second complaint which is also the awesomeness of this product.  With the purchase of the Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD, and the Kindle Fire HDX, you get free 500 coins for the app store after registering it and adding billing information.  I completed this...and 0 coins.  Soo....being curious, I used the \"Mayday\" button on there to contact support.  Due to the friendliness of the agent that responded, I found out I was only like the 10th person to use it that morning, as it's still a new feature, and the agents are new to this too!  She was EXTREMELY helpful and kind and informed me it could take a couple hours to receive this promotional credit.Last but not least...the power cable.  It is at a FUNKY angle on the tablet in order to keep with the contoured angle of the tablet edge.  It angles upward while plugged in properly.

It is difficult to use, requiring many key strokes to get it going, not to mention the necessary use of a headset. The Kindle is very accurate in getting down what I say, not 100% yet, but closer than I can do with my fingers on the PC. Now, all I have to do is learn to speak in commas and periods. That unfortunately it can not do by itself. Just push the microphone button, keep your hand away from the microphone area, and talk.", "Title": "Talk to the kindle, it listens.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Author": "Claudine Jancik", "ReviewID": "R3DWF08R1R7NGZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I  like  everything  about  the  Kindle Fire HDX.

But it's a great E reader.I wanted a good 7 inch tablet.  I bought a returned the Google Nexus 7.  It was great except for no browser having a reading pane which is important in a small tablet.  You would think Google would have this in Chrome but no.  The screen is the best in class.I went to Best Buy and they had the HD and HDX side by side.  I compared the internet and there was no comparison - they HDX was very fast so I bought it to try out.  Happy to report that this is now a true tablet in that the Silk browser is much improved,, the quad core makes all the difference, the internet is now very usable and fast.HDX also has improvements over the HD - you can slide up from the bottom to access recently used programs which is very important if you need to switch between apps since only Surface allows you to keep two apps open simultaneously in the tablet world.  This works better than iPad.A page from other androids - you swipe down to see email and other notifications.The power button is now accessible!Size is smaller and slimmer.Some have noticed that there is a purple haze to the background.  That's true and that's something you have to judge for yourself if it bothers you.There is a limit on the number of tabs you can open on the Silk browser.Battery life is improved over HD.  It now comes with a cable and wall charger.There is no rear camera.  If that's important to you, consider the iPad Mini.  OR you can buy a real camera for the price difference.In summary, there is really no reason to buy the HD unless the price is $100.  The HDX is now a good competitive tablet.  The app store remains a problem if you depend on apps for games.  I have found some surprisingly good specialty apps.This is smaller than the iPad Mini and almost half the price.

I love reading and the pages are so easy to see in any light...regular room light, dark room, and outside. Playing games that I had previously played on my old tablet is a whole new experience. The games are more vibrant, and no hesitation.I haven't used the Kindle for music yet, but based on what other have said, I am sure it will be great.I do like that they are now including the rapid charger with the Kindle, rather than having to purchase one separately.

As my first pseudo-Android tablet, I found it to be a very limited tablet based on Apps available and limitations on installing true Android apps, including a real internet browser.Battery life for active use seems to be as-advertised; however I do not expect the batteries to fully drain while in sleep mode - this is the case with my unit.Screen quality is superb for a 7\" tablet - the blue-haze issue on the borders is somewhat annoying when reading books.  Sound quality is second to none when compared to my other tablets.  Mayday is a cool feature - in a couple of instances I received great support and help; in others, it was anything but helpful.I am not a Prime subscriber - even that has limitations over other alternative media providers. This further convinced me not to subscribe.Overall, my disappointment stems from the limitation enforced with the Android apps available (c'mon, no YouTube or real Browser?), the questionable battery life when not in use, and the blue haze of this otherwise great display.Finally, I saw a recent TV ad comparing the HDX to an iPad...

Screen quality is stunning and video amazing. With the origami case there is some heft to the device and over time a unsupported hand holding it would tire. The origami case is a creative solution that works fairly well as a functional case btw. The help capability to instantly video chat with a tech is a positive experience. My Kindle arrived with special offers enabled, though I'd ordered without them. An email to customer support resulted in a reply within a couple hours, on Christmas Eve no less, with the sponsored ads removed, no charge. Incidentally, I think it would be useful if there was a way to opt back in for that content in order to receive the special offers in an unobtrusive manner. If this was controllable by the user that might be useful.I rate the poor marketing due to the following information in the product description: \"Stay productive on the go with ultra-fast web browsing, built-in OfficeSuite, and updated e-mail and calendar support for Gmail, Outlook, and more\"There is no built-in OfficeSuite. There is a built-in VIEWER.  A viewer is a very different product from an office suite. One can read documents but not be very productive if unable to produce documents, spreadsheets or presentations. This in my mind is just false and misleading advertising. A deciding factor in purchasing this product was the presence of a built-in office suite tool. You won't even know this either, unless you go looking on the product forum, as I and others have done, posting \"where is the built-in OfficeSuite? That should tell Amazon something - consumers are expecting a true suite of office tools. Either include one or more accurately portray what is on board.I chose this device after one too many crashes with my first gen iPad. So far, I'm happy with the technology. It's intuitive, easy to use and the images on the screen are exceedingly clear and sharp. Set-up was easy and fast. The very simple on board customer service is in strong contrast to getting help from Apple, which is no where near as easy. That's a definite positive factor for this product.

Its lighter and the battery lasts longer than the new nexus 7 and I personally think the screen has better color reproduction and contrast.  I had both and compared side by side, the Kindle was just all around better.  HOWEVER, no access to google voice, hangouts, maps, Music, keep, gmail, docs, google calendar, and chrome makes this tablet limited in its awesomeness.  I use a laptop for most of my internet and \"productivity\" related tasks so no integration with the google ecosystem isn't a deal breaker for me.  But it sure would be nice to be able to have hangouts, keep, maps, and voice.  Almost 100% of my IMing happens in hangouts or facebook chat, neither of which are in the Amazon market, and I would love to check my texts with google voice on the tablet.  No gmail, chrome, docs, or calendar isn't a big deal because the substitutes they have are good enough, and no music is understandable because Amazon has their own music app BUT for light social applications and looking at Maps I really wish amazon would make a deal with Google or create  decent native apps that integrates with them.With that being said, I still like the HDX 7\" better than the nexus 7 tablet because of the seamless integration with the amazon ecosystem and amazing access to content through prime. Its so easy to watch movies, play games, read comics, and read books that what little leisure time I have is spent within the amazon ecosystem.
