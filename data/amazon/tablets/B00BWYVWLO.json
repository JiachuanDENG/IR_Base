Allemann", "ReviewID": "R13RFVFJ44AQL8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I am a long time Apple Fan. I own a Mac Desktop, an iPad and an iPhone. I like to use my phone strictly for phone-related uses--making calls, using the map while traveling---that sort of thing. It is just too small for watching movies, playing games and such. But I wanted a small 4G LTE tablet of some sort that was light and would easily slip inside my purse. I wanted one that I could take with me when I traveled out of town, made road trips with my hubby, or when I'm killing time waiting for my son at his music lessons. My iPad is full-size and connected to a keyboard case, so I didn't want to keep lugging that around. So, since I am an Amazon Prime member, and after much thought and research, I finally decided on the Kindle Fire HDX 7\".At first I was concerned that I might not like it. One thing I don't care for as an Apple user is how restricted their apps are and how geared they are toward all things Apple. I was afraid that I might be repeating myself by buying a Kindle---that this tablet might be locked up in all things Amazon with no access to Google apps, youTube, Gmail, Chrome, or other apps that might not be available in the Amazon app store. However, I've found that the Kindle Fire is not locked up after all. I learned that even though there are some really great apps in the Amazon store, not everything is there that I might like or want. Yet, it was very easy to install a third party app called 1MobileMarket, and with that I have been able to side-load apps that I can't find in the Amazon app store. One app I was abler to download for example is Chrome, which of course is a Google app. It works great! I was able to sign in on Chrome with my Google account and watch all the youTube playlists and favorites that I had accumulated in my Google youTube account. I was also able to earmark Google as my search engine of choice on the Silk browser. In the Kindle email app, I was able to incorporate both my Hotmail and my Gmail accounts, and it handles both of them seamlessly. While I'm on the subject of side loading, another app that you might want to download right off the bat is the free app ES File Explorer. It's a full-featured file and app manager which is similar to Finder on a Mac or Windows Explorer on a PC. It's been really valuable in helping me find and organize apps and games, etc. after I've side-loaded them to my kindle. I highly recommend this app before you get started with side loading.Now on to my music collection. I have a ton of songs that I've already placed in my iTunes account and I didn't want to have to buy them again in order to listen to them on my Kindle. So by using the (free) Amazon Cloud Player and the (free) Amazon Music Importer, I was able to upload all the music that I had put in my iTunes account to the Amazon Cloud. The next time I turned on my Kindle Fire HDX, then went to Music, there were all my songs right there for me to listen to and/or download to my Kindle. I then found a really great feature within the Music app. It is called x-ray. I found it by accidentally pressing it as I was listening to a Diana Krall song. While I was listening to the song, and when I pressed the x-ray icon, up on the screen came the lyrics to the song, following along with Ms. Krall as she sang (similar to karaoke words streaming on the screen). When the next song came on, the lyrics to that song came up on the screen. Cool! The sound is amazingly strong for such a small tablet! As is the video display. And speaking of videos, I have several instant videos that I've purchased on Amazon, and they display and sound beautifully on the Kindle Fire HDX! I also have several videos on my Mac computer, and by using the free app Android File Transfer which I had downloaded onto my Mac, I was able to connect my Kindle to my Mac with the USB cord, and simply upload those videos to the Kindle library storage.Day by day I'm learning more and more about my Kindle and how fun and easy it is to use. But on the second day after I had bought it, I ran into a problem while trying to get into the app store. I couldn't figure out how what to do, because I couldn't get the App store to open. I just kept getting a black screen. So I pulled down the Kindle menu from the top, found and pressed the Mayday feature and within a matter of seconds, a young man with headphones on popped up on the screen and asked in a friendly voice, \"Hello! How may I help you?\" I told him the problem, and then watched my screen in amazement as he opened the necessary screen, forced closed an app, and then got me into the app store. Within moments he fixed the problem right before my eyes. So impressive! (By the way, although you can see them, they can't see you---in case you're wondering)One problem that some have mentioned, is the blue/purple haze around the edges of the screen when one is reading an ebook on this Kindle. Yes, I guess it is there, now that I looked for it. But I really don't find it to be a distraction, because it is very slight. However, you have three different page color settings to choose from that might help if this really bothers you. You can choose to have your book pages be white with black letters, sepia pages with brownish-black lettering, or black pages with white letters. Since I prefer the black pages/white letters setting (as I mostly read at night), the faint purple haze around the edges of the book pages aren't an issue for me because it simply doesn't show at all under the black color. Speaking of the eBooks section, many (most?) of the books have a feature on them called Text to Speech. While reading a book, you simply tap on the Play icon, and the book becomes an audio book, and you can listen as the book is read to you while you go about doing other things.So to summarize, I am a long time faithful Apple user, but I have to say that I am really liking my new Kindle Fire HDX. Don't let the negative reviews keep you from trying this little amazing tablet out for yourself. For all the \"problems\" that I've seen mentioned here and there, there's none that are really an issue (in my humble opinion) as you get to know your Kindle Fire. I can honestly say that the more I learn about this little tablet and all the wonderful things it can do, the happier I am that I took the plunge and bought it!", "Title": "This Apple user loves the Kindle Fire HDX!", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Author": "asortafairytale", "ReviewID": "R3701V3BUK0UM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this about a month ago and wanted to give myself some time to play around with it before writing this review.Let me just say, I'm really enjoying it. It's the first tablet I've ever owned, so I can't compare it to anything else, but I am really enjoying this little toy. I've downloaded and listened to a couple of audio books while driving to and from work. I'm addicted to a few game apps that are eating up WAY more time than they should, but that's what they're for, right? I also have the Weather Channel app that I check each morning before I get ready for work.One of my absolute favorite features is the quality of the screen. I have the Netflix and Hulu apps and the screen is so freaking amazing. So crisp and clear. Honestly, it's better than the screen on my laptop. I still use my laptop for laptopy things - creating Word and Excel documents, or going online if I need to have multiple browser windows or tabs open/do multiple things at once. But if I just want to sit and watch a video, I prefer this Kindle over my laptop.I've also read a couple of books on it. Not my favorite, to be honest. I'm not a huge fan of reading on a backlit screen. I have a Kindle Keyboard that I much prefer reading on. But this isn't too bad and I enjoy it more than I thought I would.I definitely recommend this Kindle and can't wait to continue using it for a long time.", "Title": "My new favorite toy", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Author": "HAMPOTIN", "ReviewID": "R1OXGXR7OWRSIY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let start by saying I am a Huge fan of Amazon and Kindle.i have the Kindle reader which is fantastic.but the Hdx7 was a shocking disappointment.I had to call Kindle on mayday every other day to reboot this unit to get it to work.after five days of this I sent it back,and as usual amazon was great with the return process.

Third, having only the front camera, I thought that's fine since I was going to use it to skype video with my family, but the chat always have echoes.

I should have just bought the iPad, even the older version of the iPad would be better than this new HDX.", "Title": "Regret buying it", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Author": "Nevermore", "ReviewID": "R1APEKWVER45J6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*Note--Review addresses some common concerns*An ebook reader I thought...Something to read a few books, maybe watch a movie, possibly play a couple games on a bigger screen than my phone. Something that looked nice, didn't cost too much, and had some good reviews. I had no idea this sleek,little, black tablet would become one of my favorite electronic items in the house.I had used a relative's older Kindle HD off and on, so thought I had an idea about speed and what to expect.  Nope, wrong.  The new 2.2GHz Quad-core Snapdragon processor is blazing fast.  Tapping on an app, and it opening, is near instant, HD movies play seamlessly with stutter and pixelation being an extreme rarity. Web pages load quickly, and the touch-screen is responsive, yet not so sensitive you will accidentally open an app by brushing against it's icon.The button placement and size, to me, are ideal.  With the older Kindle, it was easy to think you are pressing volume, but would be pressing on/off.  Not to mention they were tiny. The power button and the volume buttons are on opposite sides on the HDX. Mine is in a case, and neither button has accidentally been depressed.If you are looking for a gorgeous screen with vivid detail and color, the Kindle HDX is impressive.  The 1920x1200 display handles HD content with ease, ebooks are crisp and clear; it really is stunning. Additionally, the black level rendering is superb for such a small unit. Brightness can be set manually or you can let the Kindle adjust it automatically based on lighting conditions.Located on the back are two speakers and there is also a mini-jack in case you want to use headphones.  For as thin as the HDX is, the sound quality is good.  While the speakers cannot compare to a Home Theater, they reproduce sound clearly and with little to no distortion, even at maximum volume.Battery life has been more than adequate for my needs, yet I have noticed that how long it lasts can vary depending on usage.  For example, I started off with the battery at 100% and streamed movies for four hours straight; it was at 70% at the end.  Conversely, I played a popular game on it for 30 minutes, and the battery went from 100% to 82%.  Every time I play it, I know to expect a 10% draw in about 15 minutes.  Also, any app that uses a lot of memory or constantly runs in the background can affect battery life.  A Memory Manager can help turn off apps in the background and prolong the battery.My normal usage consists of heavy email, medium amounts of web surfing, lots of reading, and a few hours of streaming, mirrored to the TV.  Adding it all together probably equals between 3-6 hours per day.  The lowest the level has been was 33%, and that was after using all day and forgetting to plug in at night, so it stayed in sleep mode until the next day.Below I will address some concerns that seem to be common:1.  Dropped or poor WiFi Signal-- I have had this happen only three times in three months of ownership.  Once, was due to the router needing to be \"flushed.\" The second time, I cleared the cache in the Kindle, and the third time I have no explanation, but a simple rebooting of the HDX fixed the issue.2. Blue glow around the edges-- If I had not read about this, I would never have noticed it.  The only time it is visible is on an all white background, such as an ebook.  However, to me it is very faint and neglible unless you are focusing solely on the edges.  It is due to the edge lighting using the blue LED's and using the auto-brightness or manual adjustments should minimize impact.3. Screen Flicker-- This does happen on occasion, yet only with certain memory and color-intensive apps.  Every time it has self-corrected within a short period, and have never experienced it when streaming a video or movie.4. Ads-- I did not pay extra for no ads, but do not see them as a problem.  They only appear on the lock screen and do not interfere with performance.  Additionally, you can view them all on one page and sometimes a special buy will show.  If you absolutely do not want ads, the payable option exists.5. Laggy/Slow performance-- As with any computer device, the cache can become full and should be cleaned regularly.  Anytime my Kindle HDX seemed slow, a simple cleaning remedied the issue.  One note--certain apps can affect performance and I recommend checking after installing various apps to see if they hinder the device. The cleaner I use is Clean Master and it also acts as a memory manager.6. No Google Play--It is true that you cannot download from Google Play, however, there are other reputable android sites that you can use.  Youtube and the Web have plenty of resources to help.  You will need a File Manager, which can be obtained in the Kindle Store for free.  I use File Manager Free along with 1MobileMarket for any android apps not available in the Kindle Store yet.7. No Youtube-- I use Youtube all of the time on my HDX, whether through Silk or through the app on my Bluray Player.Some other Features and Benefits:1. I have three email accounts synced with my Kindle HDX.  It makes it very easy and convenient to turn it on and have instant access to all of them at once.2. For me, it is preferable to not use the carousel.  I appreciate that I can just swipe upwards and have all the apps I put on my home page arranged cleanly just like desktop icons.  Additionally, by holding an app and dragging it to another you can create \"folders\" to customize the appearance.  For example, have all your games in one  folder icon, all of your productivity apps in another, and so on.3. My Kindle HDX can control two cable boxes, my bluray player, my AV Receiver, act as an independent cable box, stream movies with Amazon Prime and Cable On-Demand.  Once the Home Theater is on, all I need is the Kindle to control all of it.4. Using the Netgear PTV3000, an app, and the Kindle HDX has eliminated the need for me to have a cable box for each TV.5. As time goes on, I keep finding more uses for the HDX.  It is amazing how much this small tablet can do at a fraction of the cost of others.6. It is an incredible e-book reader and library.  I love how convenient it is to have so many books in one place and be able to take them wherever I go.The Kindle HDX has become the most-used computer in the house. It does everything I initially wanted and much more and is still working great after three months. If you are looking for an incredible value in a tablet, then I definitely recommend it.  Currently, it is my favorite purchase from Amazon.", "Title": "Much more than a simple e-book reader...I love it!", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Author": "Lee Harpster", "ReviewID": "R2BCLDIHWR86CK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got the new Kindle Fire HDX 7\" as a Christmas gift and I love it! WAY better than any other tablet I've tried recently. I had a situation with my speaker, so I used the MAYDAY. TIM (it's too bad I don't know his last name) went above and beyond to help me.

I have looked at them for a long time and wanted one when the first `Fire' came out but just kept putting it off.  When I finally decided to take the plunge and get one I had heard there was a new updated one about to be released and waited for the newest version.I've had it now for a week. It's a great little tablet at a great price. It is slim, light weight and looks great!  The screen is beautiful, great picture quality and the processor is very fast.  Mine was almost fully charged when I received it, so I basically just had to pull it out of the box turn it on and `GO'.  It was already registered through Amazon. It seemed to do a quick little update and all was set.  Plus it is great it came with a quick charger adaptor, as it seemed all the previous versions never did.At the moment I mainly will use it for reading books, playing some games and occasional internet use. I like all the other options of things you can do with it, even if I don't think I need it at the moment.  At this point I am not sure if I will use it for streaming movies as it sounds many like to do. It's nice to have the option to do it. Maybe in time I will look at doing that and give up most of the movie channels I pay for on my cable tv.Some are complaining about a purple haze border around edge of screen.  I can see that now, but to be honest, I had to go looking for it after I read it in the reviews.  It is not very noticeable to me.  I just don't see it as a big deal and  I wouldn't consider this such a major flaw to give it a negative review or send it back.  It is a faint, and I mean faint, haze.

Will be returning the tablet to try the Nexus 7 or just go and buy a Mini 2/Air.I'll keep it short and easy to read and list the pros and cons as bullet points (I was hesitating between a 2 or 3 but I think Amazon is on the right track so 3 stars):Pros:1- Very clear and beautiful 1920X1200 resolution screen (A bit higher resolution than 1080p which is 1920X1080). Even better than your HDTV since it's this high of resolution on a smaller size (higher PPI)2- Excellent speaker volume and location. Doesn't get blocked when using the hdx in landscape mode (the iPad and Nexus 7 have the speaker placement issue)3- Mayday is actually very useful for someone that isn't tech savy. I was able to get connected every time I tested it within 10-15seconds. I would assume the wait will be longer during holiday season.Cons:1- The first and biggest issue for this and any tablet is APP selection. This one is missing many of the latest and greatest apps that are on the Apple App store and Google Play (including Time Warner App, some banking apps, big mobile games)etc...The Amazon app store is currently estimated at 75000 apps while both the Apple and Google App stores are each over 1 million apps and have many dedicated specifically to the tablet (specially the Apple App Store)2- Buttons placement of On/Off button and volume Up/Down are horrible and size is way too small for my normal sized hands.3- Although it is smoother than the last Samsung Tab 2 I've used, the interface still feels a bit clunky at times. It's not butter smooth like the IOS on the iPad (believe me, even my iPad 1 was smoother than this)4- Apps crashed too frequently, even when going in the prebuilt Shopping and App store apps5- Needs better quality control. I understand this is probably the first batch of the tablets and usually every first few batch of a gadget have some issues but I really think better quality control would alleviate most if not all issues.

I spent several hours experimenting and I realize there will be a learning curve, but I'm having fun with it.

I've used others in the past, and I never could get past how slow they operate; however, Kindle Fire HDX is an exception. While I'm not familiar with other operating systems, I will say that Fire OS is very smooth. I will admit there were some bugs while working the device. For instance, I have run into a few occasions where it has crashed and restarted. I have also run into situations where I've had to reinstall apps for them to work properly again. In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed. I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet. This is rather unfortunate, considering a number of these apps have been out for quite some time already. Basically, Amazon doesn't have the same broad selection you would typically find in the Apple Appstore or Google Play. Though it might be common knowledge, apps from the Appstore or Google Play aren't compatible with the Kindle. On the plus side, Amazon does release a free app each day, so that makes developing your collection easier.I've also tested some of the new features that came with the Fire OS 3.1 upgrade, including second screen and Miracast. Second screen allows you to take movies and TV shows from Amazon, and lets you play your selection wirelessly on a nearby television, assuming you have either a Playstation 3 or 2013 Samsung TVs connected. Bear in mind that second screen is only available to amazon content, nothing from netflix, hulu, or any other online streaming services. Ironically, TV Sideview (Sony's app that allows you to control Sony devices from your tablet, including the PS3) isn't compatible w/ the Kindle either. As a result, you'll have to navigate your system on both your controller and the Kindle, at least until, and this is assuming, TV Sideview becomes available for the Kindle.Miracast is a much better version of Second Screen, as this allows you to wirelessly display what you're doing on your kindle onto a nearby television or media streaming device, as long as it is Miracast compatible and compatible with your Kindle. For those of you who have familiarized yourself with Chromecast, just a heads up: it's not compatible with the Kindle. I ended up using the NETGEAR Push2TV Wireless Display HDMI Adapter - Miracast and WiDi (PTV3000) (link provided below) to test Miracast, and I have to say that if you want to use your Kindle to stream content onto your TV, this is the way to go. It displays in HD, the sound quality is superb, and anything you do on your kindle can be placed on your TV. **Gamers, if you're expecting to play games in this fashion, bear in mind that there is likely going to be lag time between the commands you input into the tablet and the miracast compatible device. This doesn't affect anything other than games, however, as the sound and video output on your TV will be synchronized during use. Thus, if you want responsive controls, I don't recommend miracast for gamers.There was one more update that came with Fire OS 3.1, and that is Goodreads. Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with it. All I know is that it's an amazon app that allows you to share what you've read, provide recommendations, and look at what your friends and other people are reading. Readers, you'll probably find this resourceful. I know some of my friends love it.Overall, the Kindle has the power and graphics to provide you with a great quality experience; however, the selection of apps do pale in comparison to other devices. While it's not perfect, it still provides the same functions you would find in other tablets (some of which are better). If you have to have all of the latest apps, especially the ones that accompany big games, such as GTA V and Injustice (Which has been added since I 1st wrote this review. Still took them most of this year though.), you'll surely be disappointed.Helpful tip for closing apps on your Kindle Fire HDX:Some of you might not know how to close apps on your Kindle, and a number of pages on the web recommends force stopping apps to close them; however, that could damage the data. Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app. If the app doesn't allow you to exit that way, then the developers never developed an exit button for their app. Then you'll have to force stop it to keep it from running in the background and avoid eating up some of that precious CPU usage.

I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support. First, the good: brilliant color, speed, much improved speakers, and the button placement is ideal for on/off and volume. \"Mr. Hyde\" appears in the reading, at least on my device, in a slowly-advancing glowing blue border! I know- the notice has gone out that this is \"normal\" and part of the advancement in true color display, but my device border is irregular, blotchy, and prevents any enjoyment of reading despite adjustments of brightness, font, etc.Amazon customer support is stellar, but I've had some difficulty conveying the fact that this display is unacceptable. Past experience with support has been very positive, so I won't let Jekyl and Hyde dissuade me.More to come....**10/30/13 Kindle support consented to sending a replacement. This second HDX does not have the unevenly lit border, but is \"shadowy\" even with the sepia background, which I find easier on the eyes. The HDX doesn't come close to the reading experience of the Fire HD that I traded in, but I'll live with this because any other e-readers I've tested have backlit displays that are far worse!I would advise you keep your Fire HDs if you enjoy reading.

My first tablet was an iPad 1st gen. I liked it, but it was too restrictive & locked down. Since then I've owned the following: Google Nexus 7 (original), Amazon Kindle Fire (original), Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\", Motorola Xoom (original), HP TouchPad (WebOS fire sale), PanDigital Novel 7, few generic Chinese eBay (all of which sucked BTW), Barnes & Nobel Nook HD+ (still have, gave it to my mom when I ordered the HDX) & now the just released Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7\" 32GB.Honestly I didn't know what too expect with the HDX, all the specs were awesome & it's kicking serious butt against the Nexus 7 (2013) in various benchmarks, but I was still kinda nervous. I knew the HDX would be high-quality & well made, Amazon doesn't put out anything, but well made devices.It arrived yesterday, it's a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but the difference is the HDX doesn't have all the wasted space usually found in the bezel areas of most tablets, it's minimalistic in design. Very much a welcomed change!By reducing the wasted bezel space, Amazon has not only made the tablet lighter, it's very easy to hold in one hand.The true full 1080p HD display has blown me away!!! I have never seen such clarity, vivid full spectrum extremely accurate color reproduction, flawless crisp clean & incredibly smooth video. Honestly, no matter what I say, this is one of those things you have too see to fully appreciate. There is no blurry, pixelated motion distortion you find in some HD TV's.Combined with true Dolby sound, which somehow manages too reproduce a very life like surround sound experience. I haven't figured out how the HDX pulls this off, but the sound is phenomenal.You definitely notice the quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor under the hood, as this thing flies!Amazon's re-built from the ground up newly minted Fire OS 3.0, is a work of art. It's fast, very user friendly, gorgeous graphics & integrates very smoothly with the content available from Amazon Prime. You can easily find anything & everything you may be looking for.Amazon's app store is rapidly catching up to Google Play & I have been able to find all the apps I use from the Google Play store.The integrated apps, such as e-mail, calendar etc. was surprisingly easy to setup with my Gmail & Google Calendar.Amazon has most definitely hit a massive homerun with the HDX line. Apple & Google have serious competition this time around.Don't second guess yourself if you are considering the HDX, it's an absolute no regret purchase. You will absolutely love the HDX. And YES, the HDX really does have the best & highest quality HD display currently available.After seeing what the Snapdragon 800 CPU & Adreno 330 GPU are capable of, I now see why Google is using both in the upcoming Nexus 5.

The Ipad requires an Apple PW EVERY time you want to download an app, and you have to make sure you remember it EXACTLY, because if you don't, the system won't let you in, and there's no way to store your password so it will fill in automatically.

Cordoba \"mxc\"", "ReviewID": "R3M0JZDWPQSSDE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like the kindle. It has a great price, awesome screen, and with an advertised 11 hour battery life (up to 17 hour if just reading according to Amazon) I figured this device was the perfect companion.After a few weeks of testing and timing, I can confidently say that for the vast majority of user scenarios, the battery life is significantly worse. In fact, I have no idea how exactly Amazon came up with the 11 hour number.But lets start with the basics pros:- Screen is really nice (yes there is some slight blue light bleed around the edges, but Amazon has a complete explanation of why that is - and it's used to have the great color accuracy/gamut that the display has). Honestly, it was very little to bother me at all, and welcome the increase color gamut. The screen is superb.- Kindle Free Time: this is absolutely great. I can let my daughter play with the kindle with some serious restrictions. (what apps can be accessed, how long she can play, read or watch videos (3 distinct timers). She can't do purchases or anything else. I can't believe nobody had done something like this before. It's really amazing.Cons- Neutered android means that a lot of very popular android apps are not available, and you have to resort to side loading them, and not all work that well. I really wish they allowed a larger percentage of the Google Play store apps (all preferred)- thick border around the edges, where the display could be extended to be even more usable without increasing the size of the device. It's around a 1.5 inch diagonal of wasted space. The iPad min in contrast his just a 1/4 of an inch or so.- And the worst offender which causes this to be a 2 star product instead of 4 stars, is the misrepresented battery life. Partner has an iPad2, (10 hour claim) and it generally lives to those expectations, lasts all day off the plug, great.The Real Battery Life of the HDX which claims to be 11 hours (up to 17 reading!!) is closer to 5 hours.Here are the tests I did during the last 3 weeks:The first day, I downloaded several apps and got it setup, read some books to my daughter, and watched a movie. I used the mayday button to ask about sorting apps by age of your child (can't be done as of now). It couldn't have been more than 4 hours, and the device was already at 10% charge (down from a full 100% charge) so I was really disappointed, and started doing a series of tests:Things to note:* Wifi only model (3g would suck the battery even more)* brightness was set to 50%.* I'm a huge fan of Amazon, and this is the first Amazon product that has really let me down with their claims. I owned a kindle keyboard, and now a paperwhite 2 - both of which I love. Customer service has always been second to none. Basically, there is no reason for me to \"bash\" this product. I am a tech person, and I am aware battery life varies quite a bit by usage, but this is a serious issue not just a small variation. Amazon failed to deliver big time on their battery life promise.Test 1:* 3 hours of mostly reading (kids books, so they had colors and things, my daughter flipping through the pages)* 1 hour of videos (she was unfortunately drawn to Barney)* Half hour of games (some simple puzzle games, nothing 3D intensive or anything requiring full use of the graphic processor)* Battery was down to 20% and I started surfing the web and others until it ran down in 1.75 hours.So basically, during a reading heavy session (17 hour amazon claim), the device failed to last 6 hours.Test 2:- Charged it overnight, let my daughter do whatever she wanted with it (using the awesome Kindle Free Time). She mostly watched videos and flipped through some books. She also opened a game or two (Again simple puzzle games, no 3D battery intensive games). She had breakfast in between and then lunch. And then brought the device to me because the battery was dead. The device lasted just over 4 hours...In contrast the iPad, where she likes to play with 3D puzzles and several other 3D apps (Mr Potato), she plays with it several days before it ever runs down.  I can confidently say that playing with apps, the iPad lasts at least twice as long as the kindle fire.Test 3:- Sporadic use throughout he day. I figure I'd try a really subtle scenario.- Light web browsing (not more than 30 minutes)- Some videos (1.5 hours)- occasional book (only 5 minute spans, or flipping through pictures)- The device was on the sleep state most of the time.- Battery life was at 30% that night. So 70% of the battery was lost during some 3 maybe 4 hours of use.I will do a strictly video test and post it later.But nothing I have seen indicates that any normal usage will get you anywhere near the 11 hour claim.", "Title": "Terrible Battery Life (5 hours or so)", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Author": "P.

I searched to find the right box and found out the Netgear PTV3000 is the only one certified by Kindle to do it. I plugged it into my HDMI input on my Samsun plasma tv, found the connection procedures and shot the display over to my tv, after about 30 seconds or so it connects and everything works perfectly! I have a couple of little complaints about the Kindle in general. When I download movies to watch when I am not in Wifi mode, it takes a REALLY long time to download and if you try to download them in full 1080p, it takes even longer. I have settled for 720p on most movies but still takes a while. Also, when I fling movies to the tv, it does show in HD but there is fairly obvious pixelization so it is not as good as watching a Blu Ray disc. It also cuts out just a little bit every now and then but no big issues there. I got my email synced to the Kindle and that works fine. I also ordered Amazon Prime so I could watch free movies and tv shows but I would say less than half of them are actually free, which is pretty annoying. I will not pay $2 or $3 bucks to watch an older tv show when the reruns are free on tv. It would be nice if they had an option to watch them free with commercials or to pay for them. The same for older movies, we were going t Ho watch some older Christmas movies this year and several of them were not on HD Prime so you have to pay for a lot of older movies too. I am still getting to learn all the modes and I have not played any games yet so can't really reply to those. I do wish I had spent a few more bucks on the Kindle with the larger memory though, if you download a few movies, they will eat your storage space right up. Hope these comments help anyone considering this. Also, I went with the 7\" Kindle instead of the 8.9\" because I just could not justify paying almost $200 extra bucks for just 2 inches of extra screen when everything else seemed the same. I am quite happy with the 7\" screen as I use it on my train rides to and from work and I think the bigger one would be more cumbersome.

It does appear to be just slightly more yellow on the right than the left, but it's not blotchy / spotty like the HDX it's replacing. I did an experiment to verify that I'm not imagining this tint - I set the Kindle overlapping my Macbook laptop screen, and side-by-side the difference in white is quite noticeable. However, since the tint is consistent and not blotchy, it doesn't take long for my brain to \"tune out\" the yellowness and accept the white as white while reading. I'm updating my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars. I'd give it 4 stars, because I like the tablet as a whole, except that it took me three tries to obtain a Kindle HDX with a \"tolerable\" screen (I'll be keeping this latest Kindle). If you were to put all three HDXs I've used side-by-side, each screen would be noticeably different than the other when reading text on a white background. That just should not be the case.-- ORIGINAL REVIEW --I would give the Kindle Fire HDX four or five stars if not for the problems I've had with the screen. I'm on my second HDX and have just requested my third. My first HDX had something akin to \"dead pixels\" - a brown spot under the glass that looked like someone focused the sun on that spot with a magnifying glass. I returned that device immediately, only to get a replacement with a different but even more distracting screen defect that I can best describe as \"muddiness.\"I've owned a variety of laptops and tablets over the years, including the previous Kindle HD, and I've never encountered a screen that looks like you're viewing it through a thin layer of dirty water. The uneven \"dirty\" white is mostly noticeable when reading black text on a white background - which is most of the time when using the browser, news apps, or even just reading a Kindle book.When I noticed this right away on the new HDX, I remembered the story of iPhones having a similar problem due to a screen adhesive that takes time to dry, so I kept my current tablet for close to a month, using it every day with the hope that this muddiness would go away on its own. It has not. It is HIGHLY distracting, and despite the crisper resolution, I find myself wanting to return to my old Kindle HD. I've requested a third HDX to replace this, but how many of these tablets must I go through to find one with even a decent display?Just in case you think I'm fussy, I have no problem with the blue glow on the sides. The glow is in the margins and doesn't overlap text or video. If the glow was the only issue, I'd still give this tablet 4 or 5 stars. Like I said, I have lots of screens in the house to compare this to, and it's obvious that Amazon's flagship tablet should be at least on par if not better than the average everyday LCD screen.Others have had similar problems (search \"yellow HDX\") , and yet others, including professional reviewers like Ars Technica, have NOT mentioned these screen problems. This and my own experiences lead me to believe that there is a breakdown in Quality Control / Quality Assurance in the manufacturing of these devices. At the very least, it appears that the manufacturer of the screen itself is letting substandard displays out onto the market. If that's the case, then you are \"rolling the dice\" when you order the HDX.

I thought long and hard about whether to buy an iPad mini and stick with the Apple ecosystem or get another Fire. I'm so glad I went with the Fire. The first thing that struck me was how light the new HDX is. I love the sleek look and the placement of the buttons. The HDX was incredibly easy to set-up. I also had no problem adding my FB photos to the cloud nor uploading my iTunes to the Cloud drive.The screen is absolutely gorgeous. The color and clarity are amazing.

Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZF0QJKD88D1M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update 11/2/2013:  My family has been thoroughly enjoying our Kindle Fire HDX.  We set up Kindle FreeTime and it has been a huge hit with our 3 year old.  We started a free trial of Kindle FreeTime Unlimited that gives her access to thousands of books, games, videos and songs.  Some of these are junk, but many are items we have purchased for other devices in the past or were considering purchasing for the Kindle Fire.  There are Boynton books, Ivy & Bean, episodes of Sesame Street, Dora and Mr. Rogers, as well as Cut the Rope, Monopoly, Life, Bejeweled 2 and other great games.  You can find a list of what is available on Amazon.com (currently over 1500 items).  While the videos are not a big draw if you subscribe to Prime, like we do, Prime members get a discount on the monthly subscription fee, currently $4.99 / child or $9.99 / family.  Prime members only pay $2.99 / child or $6.99 / family.  At $2.99 per month, I feel that Kindle FreeTime Unlimited is, by far, the best feature of the Kindle Fire HDX for us.  If you are a Prime member with children under 10 years old, I would give my strongest recommendation to the Kindle Fire HDX.The Kindle Fire HDX is a great tablet that balances form, function and price.  There are some key differences that set this tablet apart from the iPad Mini 2 and the Nexus 7.  The Nexus 7 has a slower processor.  The iPad Mini 2 has a 7.9\" screen with higher resolution but a much higher price.  The Kindle Fire HDX has no rear camera and the screen has a bluish tint on the edges from the blue LED lighting, but neither bother me.  The Kindle Fire HDX has the least apps available of the three, but all the android apps I like are available.  On the plus side, the Kindle FIre HDX is very user friendly thanks to it's clear and smooth interface and mayday help feature.  If you are an Amazon Prime member or purchase music, ebooks and videos from Amazon then the Kindle Fire HDX is a very seamless way to enjoy your content.My setup consisted of pressing the power button, selecting my language and wifi access point, entering my wifi password and confirming my Amazon account.  It took about 50 seconds.  I was immediately impressed by the screen's resolution, vibrant, accurate colors and wide viewing angles.  The screen automatically adjusts for ambient light, not just with changing brightness but also changing contrast.  Speakers sound good for a tablet, but i wish they weren't rear-facing like every other tablet.  The tablet is incredibly responsive; everything is instantaneous.  Wifi is fast and gets good reception throughout my house without dropping the connection.  The tablet isn't too heavy and feels comfortable thanks to the contoured back with good grip.  I'm not really the kind of person to use the mayday feature, but I see it as being one of the biggest selling points.

Something not addressed is the lack of HDMI and the inclusion of Miracast.I like it the HDX. What I don't like that there is no micro- HDMI so I took off 1 star for this. I really liked being able to plug into any screen to watch movies, etc. Now we have Miracast which is unproven and seemingly being forced on us by Amazon. There's not alot of options and if I want my TV's to work I need to buy at least 3 adapters.My question is specific to the Miracast function. Has anyone used a dongle to use the Miracast function? If so what product did you use? Amazon support not to helpful as the Indian call center does not even know the differences between the HD and HDX.

I set up the aforementioned NetGear which does what it says and was the recommended product by Amazon. Good (not excellent) overall picture quality when watching videos, but there is some lag especially when you have to transmit to the Netgear and download simultaneously.

Feels really solid and well built. Appstore relative scarcity is not an issue since you can easily sideload APKs if you have them. But...1. When first reading about the purple border \"feature\", I figured it was overblown or exaggerated and wouldn't be an issue. I mean, I have a gen 1 Paperwhite and the faint light blotches seem negligible to me. However, the bluish borders on my HDX are neither subtle nor negligible in size and you can bet I'd be unhappy about them even had I not heard about them first. It is really distracting on anything with a white background. I read at least 10 industry reviews prior to purchase and I didn't see this mentioned once (apparently it was an aside in one review I missed). I have to think this means there is some variance between units and I got a bad one, while the reviewers saw the best examples.2. There's also some non-trivial screen flicker, particularly when I'm in the Settings pages. It's as if it's trying to auto-adjust the brightness, but I have mine set to manual.3. This is minor one, but how can a device whose stated purpose is multimedia consumption not have a graphic equalizer built into the OS?I'll probably wait a bit to see how this all shakes out, but I'm sure I'll be exchanging/returning mine. I'd be completely happy if the screen issues were resolved.***************************************Edit 10/25: Just had an interesting chat with the very courteous Mayday rep \"Cody\". I asked him if the blue haze is supposed to be the same width along all edges of the screen of all Kindle HDX's, and he said yes. I then told him the haze was wider along the long edges of my screen, and he said he's heard that as well (oops). I then asked him if the haze is supposed to be the same width and brightness along each of those long edges (where it's most visible), and he said yes. When I told him that the haze is much wider/brighter along one long edge than the other - the bottom edge opposite the camera, he didn't have a whole lot to say (oops #2), other than this is not considered a defect that warrants a replacement. I then asked him if every HDX exhibits this to the the same degree, and he said, \"they're supposed to\". When I asked him if they actually are all the same, all he would say was to repeat that they're supposed to be.It might sound like I was being a jerk, but it really was just a calm discussion where I wanted those specific questions answered, and there was definitely some waffling on their part. And they are going to replace mine, due to the screen flicker. But if you call with just the haze issue, be prepared to return rather than replace.

The video quality was awesome. It was the video that they had on the demo model that was crap. Yes the new HDX models have that blue border when reading books. The solution to that is changing the background color to back with white letters. If there is one thing negative I can say about this particular model its the size. While using it to browse the web, I realized maybe the 8.9 model would be a touch better just bc it is bigger. But if you are used to using a cell phone to browse the web then its not really an issue bc u would be used to swiping around a web page. And one more thing. Why not put a second camera on this thing like the 8.9? That would make more sense. That would make the HDX 7 awesome! IMO, the only choice you have to make is which HDX to buy.

May", "ReviewID": "R2AQU6NH2GG4A5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the seven-inch Amazon Kindle Fire HDX (64 GB, Wi-Fi, Includes Special Offers) today and have been using it now for about four hours. This review will evolve as I continue to use the device, but my initial impressions are...this is a fantastic device for the money.I still own a first-generation Kindle Fire whose stock OS and user experience were so bad I had to eventually root it and install stock Android Jelly Bean on it to make it usable. That Amazon has progressed from that to this in two years' time is remarkable.If you're worried about value, don't: just buy one if you think you want one (that's kind of a quote from a photography expert who has a blog and reviews a lot of gear). The value for the money here is incredible.Here are my pros and cons, which I will expand upon as I return to this review and update it periodically as I do more with the HDX.PROS:+ The screen. I've been trying to get an hour's worth of work done at the office, but I just can't take my eyes off the display. It is gorgeous, bright, sharp, accurate. Everything the pro reviewers have said about this display is true, but it doesn't prepare you for the actual first glimpse. It's an awesome panel.+ The sound. I fired up \"Smokey and the Bandit\" and was perplexed by the quality and volume of sound coming from the seemingly tiny speakers on the back of the device. Despite their location, it seems like the sound is coming right out of the screen. The engineers knocked a homerun here. Unless you're practicing privacy, headphones or external speakers are not essential.+ The design. The tapered edges give the device an ultra-slim appearance when viewed from most angles from the front side of the device, yet the body has sufficient thickness to be gripped and held easily. When the screen is off, it is very difficult to see the screen's location within the bezel...like a solid sheet of black. It is well-built, but it is light. And it's balanced well--I'm using an old Incipio stand originally designed for a Galaxy Nexus phone with the HDX, and it's perfectly stable and solid.+ Ease of use and setup. Within five minutes of unboxing, the device was ready for use, and that included downloading an OS update, setting up two email accounts, a Facebook account and a Twitter account. Amazon's ability to pre-register the device prior to shipping is huge.CONS- Blue screen edges. Most of the time they're not distracting, and I understand that they're \"necessary\" given the fact Amazon chose to use blue LED's to illuminate the screen and ensure close-to-100% color accuracy. But when browsing webpages or reading books, at my present stage of HDX enjoyment, they are a bit of a distraction. I'm hoping I get used to them. (10:56 AM, 12/23/13)- Amazon's app ecosystem. This is not a knock on the device but rather an indictment of Amazon's app store. But my hunch is that with the HDX devices developers will get cracking on making the freshest versions of apps available for Kindle Fire devices sooner and in greater quantity. Specifically, Spotify is ages old compared to the current versions available for iOS and Android, and more seriously crippling is the fact that the version Amazon offers does not support Spotify's new free-listening initiatives for mobile devices and tablets. Let's hope this improves soon.More to come...but again, this device at the price Amazon is asking is simply a no-brainer.

Baca \"happy mommy\"", "ReviewID": "RTV91WXMRQCC0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A Kindle was not even on my list of possible tablets to get. I was interested in the Samsung Note 8 (played with for a little bit at Best Buy). But Amazon offered me a 30-day free trial with a Kindle of my choice and I found that this was too tempting to pass up! Being an Amazon Prime member is awesome and it's truly the best way to get the full Kindle HDX experience! My 30-days are almost up and I plan on keeping my Kindle HDX. Here are my reasons why:1. MayDay. How awesome is this! I used this feature because I was having issues with one of my apps. The attendant came up as soon as soon as I pressed connect and was very patient and understanding while I was trying to explain my issue. Eventually I did have to get on the phone and speak with someone else but the attendant stay with me even while I was discussing my problem with the rep to make sure the rep understood what the issue was. This is by far the best thing about this device hands down!2. Amazon Prime. If you are a Prime member then you already know that you can get free movies and shows but if you have a Kindle device you can also get free books through the lending library (this was new to me!) and there are a tones of books to choose from. Going back to the movies and shows, I like that I have the option of downloading them onto my Kindle for travel (great feature for kids!) or going places where I know I won\u2019t have access to Wi-Fi.3. Shopping experience. I shop a lot through Amazon (which is why I am a Prime member) and this device just makes it incredibly easy to do just that. I think the Amazon coin option for purchasing apps is a great idea and have used them on a few apps for my kids.The only down sides of the Kindle for me are:1. There\u2019s no true YouTube app. I love YouTube and watch it pretty regularly. There are ones available in the kindle store but the best one I found so far (vTube?) doesn\u2019t quite function the same as the Google app on my iPhone.

Well, guess what...I just bought another iPad.  :-(  Three things I do most often on my tablet is 1. GPS apps 2. Email and 3. Web browsing.

I didn't start to use my HDX until I returned to the the U.K as I still had my trusted fire.I purchased a new protective cover for it as it was obviously different from the fire. Unbeknowing to me at the time the cover had the ability to shut down the HDX when either folded back or closed. Many annoying and frustrating conversation with customer services and three HDXs later I just happened to read an advertisement on a similar cover to mine that had this facility. Mystery solved I was a little surprised that Amazon had not encountered or were aware of this problem.Also another niggling problem arose when adobe flashplayer tried to download its updated version I knew that Amazon did not support the flash player but this did.not stop it from preventing me from gaining access to the web. It took a few days for a very supportive customer service chap from Ireland to sort out the problem.

I expected to only use it as an e-reader, but it turned out to be one of our best electronic purchases ever.  That Kindle went with us to many interesting places over the years.  It's small enough to fit easily in a purse or a hotel safe, so it was our family's take-along device when traveling. With the reasonable price and small size, it was perfect for trips.  Free game apps keep the kids entertained on a rainy day of a beach vacation, not so expensive (compared to an iPad) that you worry about it being stolen when it's in the hotel room or broken while sneaking in one last roller coaster ride before heading to the Orlando airport.  The Acrobat Reader app allowed me to take hundreds of pages of work-related reading material with me to Europe without having the extra weight in my suitcase.  I read a lot, and my local library has thousands of books available to borrow for e-readers, a very nice supplement to the ones I've purchased for Kindle.  The untimely death of the previous Kindle was my fault: I dropped it, glass-side down, onto a ceramic tile floor and the glass shattered.  It's still working, but now in a plastic freezer bag so I don't get (more) glass shards in my fingertips.Now that I know what my Kindle needs are (50% reading, 50% apps and web surfing), I chose the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" as the replacement.  I  considered the iPad and iPad Mini, but this Kindle has more features and better resolution for a lower price.  I also looked at the larger Kindle Fire, but I really need my e-reader to fit in one hand, so the larger size is a disadvantage.  We own Apple products, so it's not like we avoid them, Kindle Fire HDX 7\" better suits my needs as an e-reader and tablet.Several things have been upgraded on this one compared to the earlier model.  My favorite is the ability to categorize books.  I have a pretty big library already on the cloud, still working on downloading and sorting through the books.  The screen resolution is better, not meaningful for reading but great in combination with Amazon Prime movies and apps.  I haven't had reason to use the camera yet, so no comments on that.  I also haven't tested the battery life on this one, but on the previous version I found that the battery lasted much longer when the wi-fi was turned off.I am very happy with this new Kindle.  The screen size allows great portability and it can be held in one hand, not too much bigger than a paperback.  Battery life is fine, screen resolution is beautiful  Available apps are great.

First, it IS a fantastic device.  Incredibly versatile, lightweight, with an amazing screen.  I have always had (it's probably me) trouble using Apple products, as for me, they simply aren't as intuitive as others, and I don't like I-Tunes, so the HDX was a logical choice.  It is very reasonable in cost, and for those who need it, the Mayday feature is sure to be a big hit.  I've used it two times, (could have easily found the answer to my question myself, but wanted to give it a try) and the help Amazon gives IS all it's cracked up to be.  Very convenient. This device is super fast, and dependable.  I won't carry a cell phone, but with this, you can load on a free app from MagicJack, and you're good to go!  Free phone calls are always great, right?  So, why not five stars? As with most tablets, there are the occasional hang-ups while online, mostly while trying to view a video, say from Yahoo.  Can be frustrating if you're not ready to just let it go.....just don't need to see it that badly.  It can lock up the device.  Some videos DO work, but not all. Not a biggie though, just disconnect, get back on, and move on.  Hey, this can happen on my laptop, and who amongst us hasn't experienced that?  This aside, this thing is so easy to use, if you can work your laptop, or desktop, you won't have to learn a thing......no jumping through hoops like I-Tunes to load music......just drag and drop it from your laptop, and voila! Very intuitive. I bought, and suggest the 32gig model, just to be certain you'll have plenty of memory, as you cannot upgrade the memory.  The sound from the built in speakers is nothing short of amazing, and of course through the headphone jack as well.  Maybe I should have given it FIVE stars.  One last thing......I almost was set to pay for the 'NO OFFERS' (which you can also do at a later time if you don't do it when you first buy the Kindle) but was glad I didn't. The offers are GREAT, the screens shots are brilliant, and you find yourself looking forward to them when you power up.

From button placement to OS layout.Kindle's major flaw is software. Obviously Amazon & Google are competing in the device market. But as a Kindle owner, you lose out on access to Google apps. This is huge. The Kindle apps tend to be two or three versions behind their Google Play counterparts. The selection in the Amazon App Store is also much slimmer. Not getting some key apps from Google, Microsoft and other major developers. So if you are a power user, you might want to go with any other Android device.The screen resolution is really nice. Sharp and bright graphics. I've noticed an occasional brightness flicker. But nothing too terrible. Video playback is quick and clean. Easy to watch a whole movie on this.Really great speakers.

The color screen is crisp and, as a color screen, is more suitable for technical volumes than the B&W; Kindles.

I appreciate being able to jump to a browser to research something I encounter in book I am reading. The Silk browser is much improved over previous instances. The mail app is also good enough for casual use.I don't watch videos on the Kindle so I can't comment on the performance at that task.

This is because the HDX 7 has a great high definition display, is easy to use, and seemed to have better connectivity to the internet than did my old Kindle Fire. Today, I was at Starbucks, where I tried connecting to the internet through their free WIFI service, but failed to connect. I had not tried connecting in other environments other than in my home where I have high sped internet through a cable company. Thus, I ran into the very same connectivity issues that I had with my old Kindle. This was very disappointing as I had been reassured by the Amazon chat tech that the connectivity problems had been significantly improved (in the HDX 7'). For this reason, I made the decision not to order the 4G internet (Verizon) with it and ordered solely the WIFI connection for it. I am returning the device in the morning.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new Kindle!!", "Title": "How did I live without it?", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Author": "David Cripe", "ReviewID": "R1NWRE8PDA313L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this Kindle Fire HDX during the cyber-Monday special of $179, which was totally worth it as that price.  My family has owned the original Kindle Fire the past two years roughly, and this one is way above that version.  Is it better than the Kindle Fire HD version?  Depends, but probably not if price is your biggest factor.Pros:1) iPad Contender - Seriously.  The iPad in my opinion is way overpriced for what it does.  The Kindle Fire HDX is just as capable at handling most of the same work flow with a couple of differences.  Yes, this is tied to the Amazon App store.  If Google Play was standard, then Apple might be worried.  Right now though, Amazon is crippling their own success.2) Fluid Performance - Smooth as butter.  I have played around with everything available for the past two months and it handles it all with excellence.  Games, work, reading, etc run flawlessly (app issues not withstanding).3) Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.  Made the original Kindle Fire look like a 10 year old non-HD television.  I could stare at this thing for days (but won't).  Reading, movies, games, etc are shown in perfect HD resolution.NOTE - The blue pixel edge issue is there, but it is not distracting to me.  I actually kind of like it.  If you read a lot on white backgrounds, then it pops out more than normal.  The haze falls to the background after I begin reading the first page of something, and I never notice it much any more.4) Micro USB Connector - Bite it Apple!  :)  No cord carousal here.  If you have a cord sitting around, it most likely works for charging or connecting the Kindle Fire HDX.  For the first time ever - a plug adapter is included!  Amazon is including a plug adapter so you can actually charge the device through a regular electrical outlet.  What a concept Amazon!  That might catch on with other electronics (sarcasm).5) Bells and Whistles - This thing has it all (mostly).  Dual-band WiFi, HD screen, Amazon support (best in the world), light as a feather, etc, etc.Cons:1) Amazon App Store (sort of) - No Google Play?  I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.  I am able to use 3rd-party app stores to upload missing apps and outdated ones on the Amazon App Store, but still!2) USB Connection Port - The connection port on the device can be a bit of a nuisance.  You have to connect it at an angle on the device (around 30 degrees).  Just irritating to me for some reason as everything else has it straight, so your mileage may vary.3) Mayday Button Gimmick - I am a computer-savvy person.  I don't need help on where to press the power button or tweak the brightness.  If you are buying this for grandma or a person that never has used much technology in the past 10 years, then this is a life saver for you (no more annoying phone calls).4) Battery - I get a couple days of heavy usage (8 hours) out of it.  I just wish I could get the Kindle reader battery life of 4 to 8 weeks.  :)Overall:This is finally the Kindle to put Amazon in striking range of Apple on the tablet front.  If you crave everything Amazon like me, then it is a no brainer to purchase this.  If you are not, then buy it anyway as you will save at least $100 over the nearest priced iPad.  If Amazon would just switch to Google Play for the app store, then there is nothing that would stop them from ruling the world!  :)", "Title": "Best Kindle Fire Hands Down", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "R22FZPHTPJ6OYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "New owned a Kindle or a Tablet and got this for Christmas and I love it!

I like the 64 GB and quad core processor.  The dual band wi-fi can use more power than my Internet can really deliver.  I will probably have to update my whole Internet package.  When I use the wi-fi to do downloads, everything on my wi-fi slows to a crawl and my Internet movies on Amazon and home computer freeze till it is done.

This kindle is powerful and takes over my whole Wi-Fi service.The power adapter is a little different this year and goes in at an angle (thought it didn't fit).  The adapter comes with the Kindle.I will be keeping my old Kindle Fire HD, because I still enjoy it and some of the old apps I am not tired of yet (not compatible to HDX).  I will be able to upload more of my pdf's to this newer Kindle, because pdf's use a lot more space. Also I can download more TV shows and movies, since I live in the Amazon ecosystem.I like the clock on the screen is back. When I open the Kindle cover, the clock is in the corner with the date.  That was not on the HD, but was on the first Fire (it was bigger).I like the offers, because it is important to me what else is available.  The screen is beautiful as always. I did have to make some adjustments to brightness (using settings) and the books (using view) I am reading. Actually for us older folks, brighter is better.The sound is nice. I was watching PBS channel out in my yard and my neighbors could hear it. The PBS channel app  was not something I was aware of before, but loving it now (even with my Internet service).The HDX is smaller than the HD 7\", but the screen is still the same size.The camera on the 7\"HDX is better than the HD.

Google Nexus 7 (2013)7.) Nvidia Shield8.) ASUS Transformer TF-101First, let me say I think the Kindle Fire platform is really nice when compared to the straight-up Google android experience.  Amazon does a great job of bridging the technical gaps for a user wanting to use a tablet and not have to constantly enter their email and password.  The Amazon docs, photos, music and video compare better in use to Apple's iCloud experience and makes the Amazon prime a solid investment.  Additionally, the horsepower of the Kindle HDX is amazing and makes this tablet for the holiday 2013 season a solid gaming platform.  My own benchmarking of the Kindle Fire HDX shows that gaming performance and CPU performance place this unit within the same performance bracket as the current generation of iPads and the Nvidia sheild.  Which is saying something when the HDX is half the cost of an iPad mini and 2/3rds the cost of a Nvidia shield.My disappointment comes from the screen on the Kindle fire HDX.  The HDX's screen shows a very visible and noticeable blue ring around the display's edge.  I've measured the blue ring to be one-eighth of inch along the long edges of the screen and slightly less on the short edges of the screen.  These blue edges really become notable when you are reading a book or browsing a web page that have white page backgrounds.  The blue ringing is much less noticeable when viewing the carousel page (which are grey) or running a app that uses something darker around the edges.I can not recommend the Kindle Fire HDX to my friends, family and colleagues because of what I consider to be design defect in the screen.

Miracast is supposed to be like a wireless HDMI standard, but you have to buy a $50+ device to make it work.  The other thing missing from this is USB hosting, which is present in every Android 3.1+ device.  I wanted to use my Kindle Fire HDX to upload photos from my camera to Facebook and the like while I was out on vacation by using a Micro USB SD Card Reader.The no HDMI thing doesn't bug me as much as the USB thing, I really wanted to be able to look at my vacation photos on my Kindle Fire HDX while I was out on vacation.

I have had every iPad since day 1 and have always just accepted the speaker quality.  I'll still use my iPad simply because of all the Apps I already enjoy, but for movies and TV shows I'll go to the Kindle every time.  Amazing sound.

This is our first Kindle).Shipping was wicked fast.  Even with buying it on Thanksgiving night...we had it by Monday.  Then lo and behold a few days later it was (of course) an additional $50 off.  Quick online chat with Kindle customer service (about 7 minutes) and BAM!  $50 refunded and an email confirmation thanking me for allowing them to refund me $50 LOL!Set up was cake -- less than 5 minutes and we were off and rolling.  Amazon sent an email the day it was delivered with links to everything we needed.  Unit moves through any program we throw at it with ease.  Videos/movies - games - web sites are all quick and crystal clear.  Haven't tried all it has to offer yet -- but I see no reason to worry  I have no complaints.

The wi fi connected very fast, an improvement from the HD model, where at times I have had to turn the kindle off and on to get a connection.  This is slightly smaller and lighter than the HD version. That is not a plus to me because I like the wider edge on the HD. So an old case will not fit. What I do not like is the rearranged buttons for power and volume! They are located on the back side and the kindle will require a specialized case in order to access them if it is being used in the case. They also did away with the HDMI port ! I use that feature on my original HD model frequently. Also the cable port is at an angle and off to one side. This is probably because the device is so thin. It compares to the I pad mini, but the mini has a larger viewing area.  If you have last years model I would keep it. If you do not own a Fire yet you will not be dissatisfied with the HDX.  I have not tried out the camera, I am already spoiled with the I pad mini camera which is wonderful, so it does not make a difference that the Kindle has one.

He just hands me back the tablet and goes to play.Reading on this Kindle is so nice. I love that it holds my spot and tells me how far along I am in the book. I also like that I have access to all the books I've bought in one place. It's a lot easier to carry this around than it is to carry around a heavy book.Cons:I'm not so fond of where the power button is. It's kind of awkward to find. As well as the charging port. It's at an odd angle and I have to actually pay attention to what I'm doing when I plug it in.The apps from the Kindle store are few and far between. There aren't a whole lot of them.

There aren't as many apps for the Fire as you have for iPad, but I'm guessing that's just a matter of time before they fix that.I mainly bought the Fire so that I could add my very extensive book collection to it. For reading I've been using the Kindle Touch 3GB, and I have more books than I have space. I found it tedious having to add and delete books all the time. I thought the Fire would be a good step up.If you have a couple hundred books, the Fire is perfect for your book collection. But if you're like me, and have been using Kindle for years and have a 6K+ collection, you might be disappointed.First, you have to click on every single book to import it onto the Fire. There is no batching. I really wish they could have had an \"add whole collection\" option. Importing is tedious at best.Second, you can't just import your old collections and believe that all books will automatically place themselves in the correct collection. First of all, I now have collections from my very first Kindle on the Fire. A Kindle that has been deregistered from my account for ever.The collections that did import correctly, are a mess. Books are missing, or the wrong books are in the wrong collection.Then there is the books that aren't in a collection. If you're viewing your books as collections, you can't find the books that aren't in a collection. It is simply impossible to figure out which book is in a collection and which book needs to go in a collection. I like to organize my books, and collections were the perfect way to do so. On the Touch, that is. On the Fire, it's all a big pile'o'crap, and I can't figure out what's up and what's down.So far, bookwise, Fire has been a huge letdown for me. I was really excited about getting the new HDX with the 64GB hard drive, thinking I'd finally be able to put by books in order. Not so much.As far as reading experience, the Fire is very good. The screen is clear, the text easy to read, and it doesn't hurt your eyes like the iPad does. Which is the only reason I give the Fire HDX 3/5 stars. I really hope Amazon updates the OS real soon where you have the option to import your whole collection with just a few clicks. And most of all I hope they fix the collections issues. Just thinking about what a mess my Kindle is makes me want to cry.", "Title": "Good for reading, not for collections", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Author": "JPP Smorenburg", "ReviewID": "R5TINYTF5X0WF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to share my feelings about my new HDX 7 which I received recently. I'll update the review as I get to know the HDX as time passes. I use the HDX daily for 2 hours on average reading and surfing. I use a PaperWhite 3G at work and at home and have used previous E-ink Kindle generations for daily reading in the past. Kindle Fire is growing up fast. The vastly upgraded device response and fluidity are already well commented on. The extra speed when surfing the web and navigating the HDX are again a big step up, good work. There is very little display reflection, improving reading once again this gen. Text is totally, faultlessly sharp.A very cool software feature in the Kindle app are the extra Wikipedia and Translation boxes that come together with the dictionary definition box, totally cool. Silk works better, taking many opened tabs in its stride and making the most of the display size with the cool article mode and nicely working full screen option that takes away the tabs and adress bar to move the page upward. I always found the iPad 4:3 display ratio appealing, but the Silk features mentioned above make the 16:9 ratio enjoyable for web surfing while keeping the device as small as possible.The form factor is again much improved with the HDX generation, no apologies necessary anymore. It's much more manageable than my previous generation HD 7; noticably less circumference and a third less weight. The physical buttons are very tactical, unlike those on the previous gen., and the sometimes mentioned \"angled\" USB port feels and looks solid, not at all awkward. The bezels are smaller and the plastic outer enveloping rim much more so giving a very tight, high quality appearance compared to the previous gen.In my opinion, Amazon have at this generation arrived at a wonderful compromise between \"boutique\" (like iPad) and \"utility\" (previous gen. HD) moving steadily toward the iPad. Also with the HDX, there is a better compromise between Amazon presence (say, like an Amazon website-type environment) and an open Android presence (like any generic android tablet) with the HDX showing beautiful, eerily sharp lockscreen wallpapers, app icons matrix and book covers, with removable recommendations which, removed, leave an \"Android or iPad like\" home screen save for the background, which is (in my opinion) nicely dark with classy icon shadowing.Battery life is at least as enduring as on my previous gen. HD. Sound is as good to my ears.UPDATE:I have some clouding, showing a brighter spot of about an inch in the centre of the display, which is visible on an even background like when reading. I can only get rid of it when switching to white text on black. The slight blue border bleeding is also present, but doesn't bother me at all.UPDATE 12/3/2013: I've requested and was right away permitted after a short live chat an exchange HDX to arrive in a couple of days, amazing stuff!UPDATE 12/5/2013: I received my replacement HDX today. What a miracle of logistics; from across the Atlantic traceable almost to the hour. Even my return HDX I can track. Boggles the mind. Well, I must say the clouding is less with the new one, but I can still see it. My daughter (painter artist) shakes her head and says: \"You exchanged it for that?\", when I show her the \"faulty\" one. Must be me then. I'll accept it as a HDX character trait.UPDATE 12/14/2013:The HDX performs excellently, the smaller size and mass, and the very sharp, defined characters are more appreciated as time in use passes. The new ability to sort cloud content in collections is much appreciated. Silk occasionally froze. Disabling page load acceleration solves that.This device is a big improvement over the previous HD; better ergonomics again, better display, less glass glare, much more zip, diminishing the E-reading gap with the glorious PaperWhite. My PW is certainly used less for reading since the HDX is here. As we live in the real world, I think the price:quality ratio is very important, and the HDX has made that ratio more favourable again for my ends, which are: reading E-books, internet news and watching news videos with the best possible display quality and low weight and size at a good price. Weighing the above factors, the HDX-Amazon combo is unbeatable. What I would call a Serious Tablet.Job very well done,Recommended!UPDATE 1/5/2014:For an Epub reader app, I can recommend Aldiko, downloaded through their website via a sent link for the free, non-ad reader. Really hassle-free, with only the basic options for good reading, not playing. The only caveat is crashing of the app with large .Pdf's. But it's not really needed for those; the embedded Kindle Reader app is superior for handling .Pdf. No need to waste space installing the Adobe Reader.For a good enough productivity app, I can recommend the King Soft Free version through the Amazon App Store. No ads, no hassle, easy connection to Google Drive.Good File Manager app: Free no-ad ES File Manager through the Amazon app store. (You can get easy access to your Cloud Account by adding in ES through documents/network/add (+ key at bottom, pick your account)Good Task Manager: Free no-ad ES Task Manager through the Amazon app store.", "Title": "Kindle Fire Is Growing Up!", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Author": "Kindle Customer \"Chuvasia\"", "ReviewID": "R1FRVSKFODHZFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being able to download Prime instant videos is sweet!
