{"Reviews": [{"Author": "ErickinOKC", "ReviewID": "R3ECPO32L5VWE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I worked for Apple for several years and was part of the initial iPad launch. I was skeptical when the tablet market took off, thinking I'd never have a legitimate use for something like this, but when I held the first iPad on launch day, it felt like a special device. I bought one and was a loyal iOS/Apple user until this past year. I felt my iPad particularly had lost its luster and its legitimacy as a helpful device -- it never evolved past being a toy, something to read a magazine on or casually play games. Especially as phones got bigger, the iPad felt less unique.I tried a Galaxy Note 8.0 and my interest in tablets was reinvigorated. The usefulness of the S-Pen, the inventiveness of Samsung's TouchWiz UI (while I do think it's a bit overkill and find myself turning much of it off, and while I do replace the launcher with Nova from the Play Store) with features like Multi-Window and Air Command, and the deeper productivity capabilities of Android (changing default apps, downloading/attaching/sharing files easily among apps) made me see that it wasn't the size of the iPad that had become obsolete, it was the limitations of the device and its ecosystem.I switched to the Galaxy Note 10.1 - 2014 Edition when it launched and am incredibly happy that I did. The screen is gorgeous, Samsung's tweaks and use of Android 4.3 are much improved over the previous iteration, the S-Pen has gotten even better, and the TouchWiz UI has gotten less intrusive. This is a fantastic tablet that I use to take notes in all my meetings, read on the treadmill, watch shows on a plane, and listen to music from while getting ready each morning. It's a truly beautiful, premium device, one that makes the iPad -- even the new iPad Air -- feel dated and limited. I can't recommend the Galaxy Note 10.1 - 2013 Edition enough.", "Title": "Makes the iPad feel dated and obsolete", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "T.J.", "ReviewID": "R3C4W370JZ9GRZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best out of the box electronic product I've ever bought.

My husband and daughter both have iPads.  I previously had an Asus Transformer Prime tablet and now this Galaxy Note.  I love the Galaxy Note.  I had originally purchased a Kindle Fire a few days before (only because it was cheaper).  I ended up sending the Kindle Fire back after only having it for less than 2 hours.  I didn't like the user interface on the Kindle and there was no Vudu app available.  I could have lived with the user interface that I didn't like, but the no Vudu was a deal breaker for me.My daughter that has the iPad, sometimes uses my Galaxy Note.  There is no denying that iPads are good.  She is not disappointed with the iPad in anyway, but even she says that if her iPad ever stops working she wants a tablet like mine to replace it.The picture on this tablet will AMAZE you!  I can assure you that the picture quality is top notch.  The sound quality on this is good.  While I wish the sound was louder, I really can't complain because the sound on this Galaxy Note it better than my daughter's iPad and FAR exceeds my previous Asus tablet.  The interface is typical Android look and feel.The pen that comes with the tablet has some good features, but I don't use it often.  If you buy this tablet definitely read up on the whole S-pen functionality.  It is good for note taking if you know how to use the great features that come with it.  Overall, I would recommend this tablet.", "Title": "My favorite tablet so far", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Author": "Ivan Go", "ReviewID": "R3KUAXQJMHLNO1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this tablet mainly for note taking in college. So i use S note a lot.  This is the main reason why I bought this tablet. So far it has served my needs pretty well.  Below is my honest opinion about this tablet.  This tablet is an upgrade from my 1st generation IPAD. Haha!The good:1) The screen resolution really blows your mind away.  It is the clearest and sharpest screen I have ever seen yet.  I have no problems staring at the for hours and still admiring its beauty.2)  When running without any problems, this tablet is a beast. It is a powerhouse.  It can handle any applications you throw at it with ease.  it can play any HD games with no problem at all so far.  Surfing the web is a joy and the multi window feature really helps especially when I'm taking down notes.3) Using the S pen is a joy and i believe it is the best thing to a pen and paper experience out there.  It writes smoothly and accurately as opposed to the display units in Best buy that i have tried.  I tried writing on my friend's IPAd and there was no comparison.  This tablet is miles ahead of the competition in terms of the handwriting recognition and note taking capabilities.The Bad:1) One of the things that stops me from giving this tablet a 5 Star rating is because of the occasional crashes and glitches I experienced. SO far, i experienced glitches from the games and also S note in the midst of taking down notes in class which can get pretty annoying.  I might be quite harsh in my comments but given that this product is one of the most expensive tablets out there and a direct competitor to the IPAd, I believe this tablet should be more than good.  If not close to perfection.2)  The home button at the center of the tablet really gets in the way during note taking. When writing on the 2nd half of the screen, I have to be cautious and careful not to touch the home button. This really made the whole tablet experience a tedious one.3)  The screen scratches very easily for some reason.  I tried using my friend's stylus pen on my tablet and my screen got scratched.  I didn't want to get a screen protector because I'm afraid it will affect the superb handwriting recognition of the tablet.4) The stylus that came with this tablet is pretty small and thin. My hand get tired writing with it after a 1 hour lecture.Overall, I like this tablet.  It has grown into my schedule ever since I bought it and I can't leave for class without having my tablet with me! I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a good note taking device and can also double up as a good multimedia device.  You just need to live with the occasional glitches as for now and hope for an update that will fix these problems in the future.", "Title": "A college student's review of the the galaxy note 10.1 2014", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Author": "Tundey Akinsanya", "ReviewID": "R3GCDSIB152JJT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are reading these reviews, am going to assume you've read the industry reviews and are looking for first hand account from people who actually paid for the tablet, right? Well do yourself a favor: buy it already. The major issues have been addressed: performance & lack of multi-profile. Samsung's TouchWiz is still there so if you hate that, don't even bother. And yes, the ugly notification bar is still gargantuan but you get used to it. But the tablet is smooth as butter and the pen works greats (my wife loves it).So get it, get the updates and get on with being productive :)", "Title": "Expensive tablet but worth the money (updates fixed performance issues)", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "RPKUSS2YF7TOK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I thought I'd break down the review rated by key area. If you think I've missed one please ask and Ill rate it.Ill use a 0-5, 5 being the best.This is a review done PRE-rooting, but post \"tuning\" and software updates. Ill update when I get around to rooting and really tuning the crap out of it.Screen - 4.3You guys all know the specs. It lives up well, and only falls short a bit. The color range is decent, without being overly saturated. Its just not as deep black and bright white as the previous Note PLS screen. The high res and overall good color reproduction make up for it though. The high res makes text much clearer, and now multi window for documents is better. As a piece of advice, \"reading mode\" was turned on my default on my unit, this seems to change bright white to a soft off white. It does help with eye strain, but makes it look muted elsewhere.Sound - 4.4Good volume and stereo is where its at. The speakers are crisp, clear, and loud enough. Their fault is 2-fold. They lack any real low end, so leave music to headphones. Also, on peak volume certain higher frequency ranges rattle a bit. The speakers being on the side vs front really doesn't seem to make a difference.Construction - 4.2Lets face facts, its plastic. We can compare it all day to an iPad, and obviously it wont come close. As far as Android tablets go, its got one of the most solid feels. I don't get any creaking. The seems where the chrome plastic is could be better, the tolerances seem perfect on the bottom and sides, but the top and a super small difference. THe weight is good, and balance is even. All the buttons response with a soft feel and definite \"click\".Performance - 4.8After getting rid of Touchwiz (for shame Samsung) and putting Nova Launcher Prime on it, it ran great. Even the \"My magazine\" app, which many pre-release reviews showed to be very laggy, lost most of its lag with Nova. High def games run great, and this is the first Android tablet to run Visible Body 3D Human Anatomy Atlas (and very high res, detailed anatomy app) with no hesitation. 1080P movies look fantastic.Battery Life - 4So far I get a day. Thats a day of games, reading, web browsing, ect. So not a day just doodling. My previous Note got around 3 days. I have a feeling this will be one of the biggest improvements once I get it rooting and completely tweaked. Charge time is....I don't know. I go to sleep and plug it in, its full once I wake up. Honestly that all I care about. It lasts a day of good use, and is charged when I wake up. I also keep in mind given the hardware and screen res, a full day is pretty acceptable. If I can get it to 1.5 days after tuning, fine by me.Productivity - 4.8Best tablet on the market for it. The added bonus and multi window within multi window? Thats cool. Office program on one side, pdf editor on another, and a small floating youtube window. The reason its not a perfect \"5\" is because the \"pen window\" feature in air command only allow for a few apps to do this. Its NOT every app compatible with multi window. If that changes, Ill be changing this to a 5.Stability - 5I've only had it for a few days. No crashed/freezes yet. If that changes so will my score. I have a feeling a mix of me using Nova Launcher, and only using some pretty well established apps, means I wont have to worry.Overall - 4.6For what this tablet is for, and what it can be once the user puts some tweaking into it, its the best Android tablet on the market.Here is the video of Orrery. Ill probably add one of Atlas 3d in action too. It gives you a good show case of the speakers sound quality, as well as how it handles graphics.[...]", "Title": "Rated and detailed review (quick video demo of Orrery)", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R2L9DJT4B05LHP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this a few days ago in black a best buy on the 10th, initially impression are, I love the black, nice quality. My wife has a ipad 4 so I compared them both substantial. The GN 10.1 is lighter, smaller bezels, much louder and better speakers, The screen is better quality overall for sure. I did internet test by going to the same website on both tablets at the same time, I tried about 10 different sites and GN beat the ipad 4 every time with ease sometime double the speed. The battery is about the same as the ipad 4. The S pen is awesome, and I could totally use it for school and just browsing the tablet. Their is slight lag here and there in some things but not even close as laggy as some of the reviews make it out to be, overall I think its extremely fast. I have a Galaxy s 4, and its faster. Mine does not lag on the main screen, or gallery like others. Overall I think its an amazing tablet and totally worth it. Sure the Ipad has better and more apps but its not a productive tablet like this one. The GN has great multi tasking, S pen, many features that make it better. I found all the apps/games I wanted on the Google play store.

When I started the device I heard the start up screen but the screen was black although the buttons on the device worked and had a lighted background. Called Samsung support and their response was that I did not charge the device so there was not enough juice to run the screen. Quite honestly this seemed quite idiotic to me and the support person kept insisting I charge the device even after I called to state the problem persisted. I finally got through with another support person who ran  some tests and it was determined that it was a hardware issue and the device needed replacing.Discovered Samsung will not honor the Amazon warranty!! Really Samsung when did the product become Amazon's!!Thankfully because I opened the device I would be able to return it for a refund within the returns window period. Must give kudos to Amazon for their response in returning the defective device. I think a better arrangement has to be made between Samsung and Amazon with regards to the warranty, if I had purchased the device in a store I would have just walked in and got a replacement. With Amazon I have to ensure that it is returned within the 30 day period, taking into consideration I have to drop it off at UPS (ground) and wait till my device arrives at the warehouse and then another device is shipped. Again Amazon customer support was actually great but I after this experience think I will purchase future electronic devices at stores.Well three days before Christmas and off to look for another gift for my girlfriend. Thank you Samsung!!Disclaimer: Before anyone thinks I am bashing Samsung or promoting retail stores. Both my girlfriend and I own multiple Samsung devices and because of busy schedules we purchased a lot of these online from Amazon.

Did I mention I have a 20+Mb internet connection, and now I can use it. It didn't come with any case or a sleeve like my first one and they have controls on the bottom of the front below the screen making it totally incompatible with any existing cases, as far as I can tell and to tell you the truth I am having problems holding the unit without hitting any of the external buttons. Looks like they are advertising cases just for the 2014 but none of them are available as yet. Also it's nice that they went to a mini USB plug rather then the proprietary one like my old unit but I think it would be better if the connector was on the top or side as you can't stand it up if you have the charger plugged in which the exactly the way I use my old one, which has the same issue so I end up using it upside down. That's not so easy with these new buttons on the bottom.

fulfillment arrived in a box full of small paper flakes. They were all over the device, sticking to the protective screen sticker provided by the manufacturer for transport. Not only were they all over the device and sticking to the side stickers, but I found them under the screen's protective sticker as if no one cared there was dust/paper flakes all over it. Part of the Samsung label on the back of the device appears faded due to sliding around in the box during shipping.I chose a white 32 GB Note because I prefer it over black. Right away I noticed the top of my device by the camera has this red blemish. Upon closer inspection I noticed that whomever attached the front bezel of the Note didn't align the stuff under it correctly, so what I'm seeing is the leading lines for placement under the front bezel which is visible if you're looking at the Note from the side or flat on its back.After wiping off all the paper flakes that came with the device and blowing air gently into the power port, the audio port (which has a HUGE hole compared to the Samsung Galaxy S3's audio port), I powered up the device. As with most devices, I figured it'd have a little power to turn on, but this one did not. I plugged it in and went about setting it up. Not thirty minutes out of the box and all the applications start crashing on me. They start to error out, unable to find location, unstable internet (which was fine according to my phone) and that google.services were unable to function.I pulled my hair out for a bit, read some Android forums and figured out how to do a manufacturer's reset. Everything appears to be working now, but that was a headache upon receiving it. Had I been an average user with no experience in computers/devices, I'd have shipped it back up in frustration and returned it. The blemish bothers the heck out of me, but I'd rather not have to receive another box of paper debris and risk getting a scratched screen, just for a cosmetic issue. Going to try it out for a few days, see how it does, then decide if I should return it.Update: Feb 13, 2014: Sitting with Samsung Support trying to get my device to load the Samsung App and Samsung Hub application to no avail. I have the apps on my Galaxy S3 Phone which work, but they aren't loading on my Note. They error out with \"common error on product search\" and \"Service Unavailable (1009). Unable to find your location. Check your network settings and try again.\" Technician had me create a whole new Samsung account just to test the device, but it isn't loading either way.7:57 pm - Amazon is overnight shipping me a new Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014) edition after Samsung Technical Support suggested I replace it since it was brand new and malfunctioning. Amazon's customer service is amazing because I thought I'd have to wait a few days for a replacement. I already shipped the defective device back today, so I'm glad to see I'll have a new one in the mail tomorrow without the red blemish and hopefully without any WiFi/GPS connection problems that were messing up the Samsung App/Hub processes. Will update with another review when I receive the new device.Updated: Feb 14, 2014: Straight out of the box I noticed my replacement has a scratch on the bottom left silver bezel. The speaker cover plates are loose and jiggle when you move the Note around. You can tap them gently and they'll wiggle loose. The previous Note 10.1 (2014) did not have loose speaker plates, therefore I can't believe this is \"working as intended\" or was designed like this.Turning the Note on, it went through several updates unlike the previous Note, but still could not connect to Samsung Apps or Samsung Hub. In addition, this Note is hot to the touch unlike the previous one I replaced. I'm about ready to ask for a refund and try my luck with in-store purchases instead. This is ridiculous, the headache has made me reduce this by another star.Bonus Extras FYI: Dropbox will not give you the full 50GB of storage space if you have a pre-existing account. Any GB you earned from Referrals won't matter after you link it with your Bonus offer for Galaxy Perks.Update: Feb 15, 2014: Returned my device to Amazon through the pre-paid label. I asked for a refund to be issued. In the meantime, I went with Samsung's suggestion to purchase the Note from an \"authorized\" vendor, as apparently Amazon.com is not considered by them an authorized dealer (who knew?), and headed to Best Buy. The Samsung employees there hired to work at Best Buy listened to my story, they let me test the device right there with them. No scratches, no blemishes, no paper flakes in the package. Screen's protection sticker was absolutely fine without any debris in it like the first two I purchased from Amazon. Straight out of the package, it had a full charge, no problems getting it signed up on the Samsung account, updated, all the apps worked in the store. Device itself did not get burning hot to the touch like the second replacement I was sent. All the parts on it were in good working order, no loose pieces or otherwise visible defects. S-Pen worked like a charm, quick to respond to the button tap near the screen, worked flawlessly.My only problem with it was once I got home the Samsung Hub had an \"unknown error\" again and crashed. I'm wondering if the Samsung Hub itself isn't working properly and the server is dropping or if there's an issue with my router and the Note because the Samsung Galaxy S3 phone works fine on WiFi with the Samsung Hub application.Why am I so determined I wanted a Note 10.1 (2014) instead of an iPad Air when they're relatively the same price?The expandable memory for the SD card is one. The fact I can plug my Note into the computer via micro USB and retrieve files. It can NFC with my phone among other Samsung things. It has the ability to flawlessly render my handwriting into text format, port it (handwriting and all) to PDF format then send it to Evernote. There's the fact I can not only use the tablet for hand writing my notes, but I can also use it to draw sketches. It's definitely a useful device for someone who spends most of their day sketching, writing, or researching. The S-Pen permits you to take snapshots of whatever you're looking at and save it to a scrapbook backed up on the Samsung account you link your device with. You can also take a screen capture and doodle on it with the S-Pen then send it off to someone or save it.Since the device itself is 10.1 inches of real estate with the capacity of adjusting your stylus width/type you can virtually do whatever you need with S-Note. From using a pen, pencil, brush, various colors, types of lines, etc. I really wanted this without having to buy a stylus, multiple applications, and so forth. Dual window screen is great for someone trying to copy and paste data from an e-mail to another program or even just comparing information.So far I liked the price, the features available, and customization versus the high price and lack of expansion with the iPad.", "Title": "UPDATED: Straight out of the Box...", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Author": "Lou", "ReviewID": "R2YG3IQTM265UA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a big fan of Samsung products and I currently own the Galaxy Note 3 and the original Note 10.1 tablet. When the 2014 edition of the Note came out, I was eager to explore the high resolution screen and the many features that make the Note such a great tablet. Being aware that the Note Pro 12.2 is about to be released, boasting of a larger screen size and a more windows-like display, I seriously thought of waiting to check out this larger tablet. However, trying to be practical, the Note 2014, for me, lighter-weight and slightly smaller in size (not screen size though), the portability of the tablet is really important to me. I bought the tablet a couple of days ago and am quite impressed and very happy with this product. I was able to sync the tablet, through my Samsung account (with MUCH help from my tech-savvy son) and to my surprise, was able to get all my saved S-Notes onto my new tablet. An app called File Manager, a free download from the play store, was needed and well utilized in making this transition possible. And on the Samsung website, an S-Note Reader program can be downloaded for free onto any PC, allowing you to read your S-Notes on your computer. Again, all credit goes to my son, whose patience for this is extraordinary. A lot of trial and error initially, along with some scary (I thought I lost ALL my S-Notes) and frustrating moments, it all worked out well in the end. I have barely begun to explore the many new and improved features of this tablet, and I was quite satisfied with the original Note 10.1 (which I happily passed along to my son). I rely heavily on the S-Note application to take many notes, create many folders, etc., both for business use (primarily) and for personal use as well. I LOVE the S-PEN, which now I cannot live without. While always attracted to the iPad with Retina Display, the lack of note-writing capability on the iPad and most other tablets, is a big disadvantage to me. The Surface Pro was also something I seriously considered, but with enough windows computers and being I am so very comfortable with the Note, I am sticking with this tablet. I also purchased the specially designed Samsung cover/case for this tablet, which I am also very happy with. It is really slick-looking and when you lift the cover open, it wakes up the tablet. All necessary ports are conveniently exposed. The screen resolution is beautiful, text is so easy to read and videos stand out beautifully. I was also able to install Adobe Flash Player from the Adobe website, which, for me, just ,makes life a lot easier. All the apps I had installed on my original Note 10.1 were automatically placed on the new tablet once I set it up. Wi-Fi connections work very well also, so I have no complaints so far. I will update this review if I come across any issues, but so far, so good. If you like Samsung products, I would highly recommend this tablet.

I don't think I'll ever go back to anything but s-pens.  The Samsung apps that utilize the s pen are also good.  I wish there were a setting so whenever the pen is removed, only the pen will touch buttons and not the finger or hand.  They have that partially in some apps.- SD card. In the app options, it says you can move apps to the SD card, but I'm not sure how to verify that it works.  A warning: when I checked out, Amazon recommended a 64GB micro sd card.  The specifications say it only accepts 32GB.  I bought a Samsung 32GB, so I haven't tested whether 64GB works, but I wouldn't risk it.  I bought a Samsung micro SD card because it's faster than SanDisc.- Great speakers.  I'm a musician, and was worried about complaints others made, but I think they're great.  I mean, they're not exactly surround sound, but what do you expect from a tablet?  It's loud enough and clear enough for my purposes.- Good camera.  I'm no photographer, but I thought the camera was a good quality.- Thin and light.  I haven't had much experience with tablets, but I was happy with the size.- Great perks.  I don't know how long they'll offer the perks, but I got good stuff like DropBox space, Google Play credit, credit toward entertainment in the Samsung Hub, etc.- The IR blaster is cool (TV remote), but it's hard to find a good app that uses it.  I finally found one, but it was a long search.- Big screen with good quality.  If you like to watch movies in the dark, you might want to turn the brightness auto adjust off, because in the dark, the screen also goes dark.  For movies, that usually doesn't work too well.  When you turn the brightness to your liking, the quality is great.- I also like that you can have two apps side by side, or mini floating window apps.  Not all apps can do these - actually most can't, but many of the important ones can.Neutral/Maybe:- The pen is small to hold, but that is to be expected.- There are other tablets with 64GB + SD card.  I'm not close to running out of space yet, but I like to have it just to have it.- I'd like to see better power options.  There is a power saving mode you can turn on and off.  My phone has options to keep the screen on when it's plugged in.  I'd like that for the tablet.  I'd also like it to turn power saving mode off when it's plugged in, and perhaps turn power saving mode on when it's not plugged in.  When it's fully charged, it displays a message saying to unplug it from the charger.  From my reading, it's just an odd attempt at being green.- The speed is what I expected.  It hasn't really lagged too much.  You have to change a setting so the screen rotates faster.  Just remember that it is a tablet, not a computer.  In general remember that.  If you want to type, use a keyboard.  A tablet is for portability, but bigger and fancier than a smartphone.Cons:- I haven't been that happy with the Samsung software and apps.  They haven't been what the videos say they are.  I have a Samsung laptop, but I can't stream video to it like I though I could.  Unless you have the right Samsung TV or box, don't plan on streaming movies or pictures to your TV.- Along with the last complaint, there is no HDMI port.  There are adapters for other models, but not for this one.- When you press home when you're already home, it takes you to read the news.  You can't change this option.  I'm sorry to say, I'm not that interested in the news.  I keep pressing it by mistake, and having to go back.  I wish you could choose which app that shortcut would open.", "Title": "Great tablet.  Very happy.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Author": "Sara", "ReviewID": "R2MLQXCX32CH8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this tablet as an artist, for drawing and painting and various Graphic Design projects. As a Graphic Design student I cannot express how useful this tablet is. The pen uses a Wacom digitizer. Instead of hauling my Wacom tablet to class every day, I just take the tablet to create digital works, which I can then port to Photoshop, Illustrator, or whatever. The stylus is far superior to those which work with an iPad, and you save money by having a stylus that is built in to this tablet. If you are an artist or an art student looking for a tablet that will increase your productivity I highly suggest the Note over the iPad. I know that Apple computers are the industry standard in the Art world, but this tablet should be the exception to that \"rule\". Art kids, abandon your Apple tablets and get yourself a Note.Speaking of Note! The note taking capabilities of this tablet are amazing. For once, I'm an organized note taker. I have abandoned the lined paper notebook and I use this tablet solely for note taking in my Art History classes. I love how I can drag pictures into my notes, which is absolutely a bonus, and an important feature in helping me learn Art History. Instead of having to download a huge PDF with slides from a lecture on art, and flip through my paper notebook to find the corresponding artworks, I just drag the artworks over into my notes and everything is right there. It's awesome!This tablet is very fast, very snappy, and responsive. I have no issues at all with it's speed. Even when running many apps at once, and while using a custom launcher app, it's still fast.I love this thing. I am incredibly happy with my purchase. I literally cannot imagine my life without this thing, now that I've had it for a few months. It is an integral part to my education and my life. I should do commercials for Samsung. :)", "Title": "Far superior to an iPad", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer \"Sean Holder Photography\"", "ReviewID": "R26C1MQT86V4F1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So here's my take on this tablet:1. The additional items that Samsung is playing up in their advertisement as being $600 of free stuff, is complete garbage. The $50 credit they give you for the Samsung hub is a joke, the bookstore has nothing worth purchasing except garbage books, the App Store that Samsung has is complete joke also. The only added value is the 25 dollar credit with Google Play. Everything else you're going to get a free trial and then they want you to get a subscription with a monthly fee. So it's a complete marketing scam by Samsung to get you to buy this tablet.2. Okay now is the tablet worth $550 for the 32mb version? I would say yes.3. The other reason I do not rate this a five star is because its not running the latest version of Android. You would think, at least I would think, that if this is your flag ship model that research and development would have worked endless hours to give you the latest updated edition since its release last year. But no it's still running Androd Jelly Bean 4.3 which is not a bad thing but when you're spending this kind of money you would expect a and company like Samsung to be at the top of their game.4. Why did I pick Samsung over the iPad? The biggest reason I got this tablet was because of the stylus s-pen verses touch only types of tablet. If Apple had a tablet with a stylus with Wacom technology similar to this one I more than likely I would have gone with the iPad, reason being is their updates seem to come out faster from their R&D; division. For some reason Android products seem to be hit or miss on whether you're going to get an update or not or if you do get the update it takes forever, this tablet was released October 2013 and it still does not have the KitKat update for Android how ridiculous is that.5. So how does the tablet work? After I purchased the tablet I went to the Samsung store and I purchased the Bluetooth keyboard and the USB adapter. I have to say this almost works as good as a laptop with the keyboard and the USB adapter. I am able to plug in my portable 2tb external hard drive by Western Digital, this is a huge plus being a photographer that this little tablet can actually power my external hard drive for when I want to show images to clients. Again the keyboard is an awesome addition if you wanna sit and type something verses using the S-pen or finger typing.Final note, I'm going to give this tablet a chance and hope the updates come out soon and the biggest test is going to see if later this year probably several several months from now when Android 4.5 is released if this tablet gets updated to that version. The last thing I want to do is be spending this type of money every year and a half to two years when a new update for Android comes out and the company doesn't support the upgrades. I have that issue with Toshiba Thrive 10 inch tablet this was a very promising tablet but once they got to Android Ice Cream Sandwich version they stopped. There were no more updates, no more support which was truly disappointing since I really enjoyed the Toshiba company. But when companies do not take care of their clients, the ones that support them they will lose them. Case in point as for me I will never purchase a Toshiba item again, I am currently very very happy with this Samsung tablet.Does this tablet have value that an Apple iPad air does not have? Yes it certainly does the multi task window is a huge feature that Apple would probably need to learn to implement into their tablet. The s-pen is huge the Wacom technology is spot on I've been using a Wacom tablet to edit my photos on my computer for several several years and to have this feature on a tablet is awesome.So again to recap the added value that Samsung is pushing on their advertisement that you get this supposedly $600 in extra stuff is a complete scam in my eyes. To me the value is only really $25 for the Google Play Store other than that everything else is a waste.Will I keep this tablet? Definitely it's a great tablet let's see how soon Samsung can get there research and development team together and get it updated, and keep it updated with the latest versions of the Android software and not take 6 or more months from release date and have you still waiting for the update and at the same time call this their top of the line model when its not even running the most current Android software.", "Title": "Top of the Line Tablet, Mediocre Samsung Support", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Author": "C. Steinbrecher \"CWS\"", "ReviewID": "RW9EDYRWOZCAJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1\" 2014 edition one week ago.  Intent was to transition my iPad to my wife who is comfortable with her iPhone and me to adopt the Galaxy Note as I really like my Galaxy S3 phone and am looking for maximum compatibility.  I have been exceptionally pleased.  More and more I belive that the Apple products, while they do have some very nice features, just seem to lock you out of too many things.  For example, try transporting your Apple address book somewhere else, good luck with that.  The google address book gives you so much more flexibility and power.The screen on the Galaxy Note is incredible.  The form factor being a little wider is also generally very nice.  Some Aps although do not scale quite as well to this - for example my application to read the San Diego Union Tribune seems to be sized more for the iPad - not a huge deal though.The internet browser on the Galaxy Note seems superior to me.  It just works better and seems to support more websites and particularly video formats that you can not view on the iPad.Love how you can install your own micro SD memory card in the Samsung products.  You can buy a good quality 64Gb microSD for a fraction of what Apple charges you to get 64Gb of memory.EMail Ap provided with the Galaxy Note is very nice and easy to use.GPS Receiver Built In - very nice built-in GPS receiver.  My iPad2 does not have this.  Don't know if the more recent iPads do or not.  Works very well and of course integrates great with hte GoogleMaps and since this is an Android device no problems there.  You do need wireless access for your maps to update as you move around the country but I did find a free Ap that allows you to download maps for free (Navigator) that appears a good option.Dropbox - Samsung gives you 2 years subscription with 50Gb storage to Dropbox.  I am very impressed with the ease of use of Dropbox on the Samsung Galaxy Note as well as my home laptop.  I can even look up files from my work computer network by just logging into my dropbox account.  This is very convenient.In general, I am thrilled with my Galaxy Note 10.1 2014.  It is generally very intuitive and I find it to be more powerful in many ways than the iPad.  Did I mention the ability to open a second application to the side or in a subwindow - very convenient at times.  There are a few drawbacks compared to the Apple iPad which I will list below.  - Ap Support - the application availablity for the Galaxy Note is excellent but not as good as for Apple.  If you have a popula Ap on your Apple device I would estimate an 80% probability the Ap will be available on the Androis as well.  But there have been some supriises.  I have been running an Ap on my iPad and Galaxy S3 Phone to track my NCAA mens basketball bracket and mysteriously it does not seem to be available for the Galaxy Note.  Similarly, my Glo Bible ap is not yet available but they say they are working on it.  Also, can't find an Ap for Amazon Prime  video although there is one to play Amazon prime video on the iPad.  Hopefully Amazon will get one available soon for the Android.  - Music Transferability - this is both a negative and a positive.  If you have all your music in Apple iTunes it will take a little work to transfer into the Android system.  That said, Apple iTunes I find to be too restrictive and I'm trying to move away from them.  There are aps and utilities out there that can do this for you.  - Picture Transferability - Apple does a very nice job with it's iPhoto program and then transfers all of your albums seamlessly to your iPad and/or iPhone.  That said, it appears that Google's Picasa can now import your iPhoto albums.  I will be trying to make that transition but I do have to complement Apple on the ease of use of their iPhoto program between their devices.After one week I am thrilled with the Samsung Galaxy Note and highly recommend it.  I find it worth the transition away from Apple and with just a little bit of work will be more powerful and convenient than the iPad was.", "Title": "Beats iPad", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R37IE4HJRU095Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am currently in college right now and this tablet has become essential for my day to day life at school.

I have the original Galaxy Tab 10.1 GT-P7510 that I got two years ago and liked it but it was buggy and slooow and would have to re-boot a lot. I decided I wanted to upgrade and get something I could multi-task with and have good battery life.I read and watched reviews and settled on the Note 2014 32G. I got it the 1st week of January and have used it every day I've had it. I have read some people had lag problems or battery drain problems but I have not any problems with anything. I did install Nova Launcher Prime (I had it on my Tab) and use Chrome browser. My Note is fast and smooth. Very snappy when I swipe and change apps. I'm not a game player so I can't address that but I have watched movies on it and the screen is awesome and movie play is flawless.Typical for me is: I can read a magazine, a few chapters of a book, watch a few YouTubes, play around with the S-Pen while listening to some music, surf the web, surf Amazon and place an order, check email and Facebook and do a couple of lessons of an on-line course and general messing around and still have 1/3 of the battery left at the end of the day. I can easily go a couple of days with a battery charge. I was lucky to get a day on my Tab 10.1 with less use. I usually plug it in at night while I sleep but there have been times that I want to top the battery off and it seems to charge fairly quick.I use this tablet every day and really enjoy using it. I bought the Samsung smart case and also use FlexArmorX pouch because I take it with me when I go to work and when I travel.I do wish Samsung made it easier to sync stuff from one device to another. I'm still trying to get files from my Tab to my Note but that's a Samsung issue, not a Note 2014 issue. I would recommend the Note 10.1 2014 to anyone wanting a fast, powerful and pleasure to use tablet. There is a learning curve but that's part of the experience. I did buy and download \"Samsung Galaxy Tabs for Dummies\" by Dan Gookin. Copyright 2014. It covers all Galaxy Tabs and the Note. It's $10 from Amazon and I have learned some good and helpful stuff. I would recommend it whether you're new to tabs or, like me, have had an older tab.", "Title": "Great tab.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Author": "V.

I gave my husband an iPad for Christmas, and he's very happy with it.  I was looking specifically for a tablet with a port for an SD card so that I could take the card from my camera and pop the photo's directly into my tablet.  This is one of the few tablets with an SD port - the iPad does not, so it wasn't even on my short list.I love that the tablet plays nicely with my camera, but it does so many more amazing things that were happy surprises.  I particularly like the S pen functions - scrapbook is a great way to keep track of recipe's I want to put on my menu plan for the week or DIY projects I want to try.  I even used it to take pictures of haircuts that I liked to show to my hairdresser - very handy feature.  S note is great for grocery lists, reminders, and idea's that I would otherwise loose track of.As far as speed goes, I'm absolutely pleased with the speed of all of the tasks I use it for.  Quick surfing, video's play well, and the screen is rich and amazing.  The sound isn't great, though, but we paired it with a little Jam bluetooth speaker or the Bose speakers in our RV and it works great.There are lots of tips and tricks available on Samsung.com to help you get the most out of this tablet.  I've found them very helpful.  I'm really happy with my tablet choice - it does everything I would want it to, is light and easily portable, the battery life is more than enough, and it's very user friendly.  Combined with the ability to expand with the SD card, it's an easy top pick.", "Title": "SO much more than the iPad", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Author": "Jakob S.", "ReviewID": "RX16UJMB7X89U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must first start out by saying that I had the note 10.1 2012 version before purchasing this one and I have been pleased with all of the Samsung products that I have.The display is amazing compared to the old note 10.1. I am out and about all day every day for work and school and always have my tablet with me for quick notes, or if I have some extra time, for watching movies. The display was the main reason I got this tablet.I compared and contrasted this display with my iPad 3rd generation which has the retina display, as well as compared it to the old note 10.1. One of the problems that I had with the Note 10.1 2012 was that it always had an awful glare especially when I was outside or in a room with a lot of windows or with lot of light. It killed me because the old note was very powerful but the screen always had a very annoying glare. The screen on the old note 10.1 was also not as sensitive to the touch as my iPad 3 did. The speakers on the old note were not as good as the iPad 3 either. But with the new note 10.1 2014, Samsung really nailed everything right on the head. The screen on the new note 10.1 2014 outperforms the note 10.1 2012 by a long shot. The screen is brighter and way more vivid. It is also a lot more sensitive to the touch. Those annoying glares that I always got with the note 10.1 2012 were gone. I also noticed that the speakers were significantly louder than the ipad 3 and the note 10.1 2012, but the ipad had a lot more bass it it's speakers.One problem that I had with the iPad, as a student, was that it was somewhat difficult to take notes while in class. There really aren't any very good word processors made for the iPad. The note 2014 comes with Polaris Office which is really similar to Microsoft Word. It is a fully functioning word processor. What I like most is that through Polaris Office, you can set it up to save all of your documents straight to google drive so that your documents can be synced to all of your devices. For example: I start an essay in class and save it; when I get home, I can continue working on it on my computer; then when I am on the bus I can read it on my Note 3 cell phone. You can make word, excel, and even powerpoint presentations right there on your tablet. I purchased a keyboard case for it and paired with my Razer Orochi bluetooth mouse, it is nearly a computer!While using a bluetooth mouse and a bluetooth keyboard with the wifi and bluetooth on all the time, this tablet lasts me all day and even into the next day for a little if I forget to charge it. And because it is so small and light, it is very easy to carry around all day rather than having to carry a bulky laptop.Another useful feature is the app Watch-on. Because the note 10.1 2014 has an IR sensor in it, you can pretty much control anything that uses an IR remote. I have it set up with my 42\" TV, my bluray player, my cable box, and my receiver. I did find the app somewhat difficult to use sometimes because you can pretty much only use it when your line of sight is directly above the tablet and since you have to line up to IR sensor to your TV when you want to change the channel, sometimes you don't always hit the right buttons.Another thing I use it for a lot is for music. I am involved in the Millennial Choral Organizations in Mesa, AZ which requires that I memorize a lot of music in a relatively short period of time. I just take a picture of the music using one of the Cam Scan apps and save it as a PDF until the end of the semester when I delete it all. Part of having all of this music is having to write notes on how the conductor wants it to sound. One thing I was a little disappointed in was that it does not have the capability of writing notes on the PDF and then saving them. But what I figured out is that you can select free write after you pull out the s-pen and then I can write my notes on it and it saves it as a screenshot. I wish that it had the capabilities to do write on the PDF, but unfortunately, you cant.Overall it is a great and powerful tablet.", "Title": "A tablet made for students and musicians as well as for media lovers", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Author": "Jeffry J.

HOWEVER, I bought this after all the updates were out, and things were already looking better. You can see the line in the reviews for when this happened. This is customary for new technology. I have had a rooted kindle and have had helped others with an iPad, but I really wanted something that was Android and good enough to use many of the features of my phone on a pad (I have a Samsung S4, near enough to the technology in this product to sway the purchase).Snote is working much better since the update. Most of the other technology is working really good. I have not removed the Knox interface as many have threatened (and some have done). The primary reason is update path. I am still waiting for a good bluetooth keyboard case for this and I want the update path so far. That does not mean I may stick with it forever, but I actually use the Knox interface to split my business/home use. This is very handy. I have packed this pad with goodies and it's still going strong. I use both the Spen and a standard pad stylus from my roocase purchased at the same time. The Spen actually has the detail/resolution to grab the timesheet program interface bar that is buggy on a mobile interface (it gets squashed).The camera has less resolution than my S4, but actually has slightly better light and color response. I have not used the front facing camera and am unlikely to in the near future.

I have been waiting for my first impression to wear off before I wrote this review, and it has. The reason I bought this tablet is that I was contemplating getting a laptop, for school, despite how much I dislike laptops.I bought this tablet knowing that it had the stylus (pen) and it had handwriting recognition. All store models I had used were all very fast and responsive. My handwriting is unlike anyone else's that I have seen. In the years past, devices with handwriting recognition were not able to read my writing. They required I write in a specific manner.  Also previous devices required that I write one letter or word at a time. All the store models of the Samsung Galaxy were able to read my handwriting. The Samsung Galaxy allows me to write more than a sentence at one time. It also reads it and processes it quickly, as well as gets better at recognizing my writing the more I use it.With the apps, the web capabilities, the speed, the responsiveness, the handwriting recognition, this tablet has become my school workhouse. I really do not feel I need a laptop anymore. Like anything, the Samsung Galaxy has it's shortcomings, and there are a few. But at the moment, the only shortcoming worth mentioning is the ram. Even with 3gb of ram, and the responsiveness, I feel that it needs more memory. I constantly see my memory usage at 2.74gb. I constantly make sure that I close apps instead of just minimizing them, because i'm always maxing out the memory.And just the OS alone seems to take up 1.23gb of the 3gb of ram, because at boot up, the memory usage is never less. No matter how many apps I close, or memory I clear I cannot remember it ever showing less in memory in use.I am not an apple fan although I have used their devices many times.

I think I'll do a little test by fully charging both then playing the same movie on both with brightness set to half and I'll post the results for those who are interested.(2) I've also noticed a very little light-bleed particularly at the bottom of the screen while watching a movie with the black band at top and bottom, this is in no way a deal breaker as you will hardly ever notice this.UPDATE 18/12/2013:After going a little deeper with my comparison between my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (16GB, White) and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (32GB, White), I've come to a few conclusions.Test 1:I streamed the movie \"Olympus Has Fallen\" from Netflix with both tablets playing at the same time \"in sync\", I started with both tablets at 100% battery charge, 50% brightness and 50% volume level and at the end of the movie credits, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (16GB, White) was at 64% battery life while the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (32GB, White) was at 57% battery life, a 7% difference. By the way, when looking at the same picture, movie etc. on both tablets side by side, the older tablet has a noticeably bluish hue as opposed to the newer model which shows more vibrant natural colors.Test 2:I continued using both tablets until they reached the 50% battery level then I started the charging process while timing on a stopwatch. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (16GB, White) took 2:40 to charge from 50%, while the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (32GB, White) took 3:13 to charge from 50%, a 33 minute difference.All in all I love this tablet, the resolution of this screen is something to behold, everything looks so much better and words are much clearer and I'm really impressed with the sound quality and processor speed. I'm happy that I made the purchase, can't wait to see what Samsung comes up with next in the Note 10.1 line, hope this helps a little.Pros: Realistic color, screen is bright and beautiful, great sounding speakers, can print with my hp printer via wifi.Cons: little light bleed around edges but nothing to talk about.", "Title": "Even Better Than I Expected After Testing Both 10.1 Models", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Author": "Christine M Bell", "ReviewID": "R299FP6NU5QIUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went into a retail store and checked out this tablet in person before I chose to buy on Amazon.

In fact, there were only two reasons I bought a new tablet:  1) I have a strong need to use a tablet for hand written notes and  2) the Transformer Prime camera had failed on me for the third time in the two years I had owned it (it apparently was a major design flaw on that tablet).  I loved the dockable keyboard, speed and everything else about the Transformer otherwise.Still, when I unboxed the note, I was immediately impressed with its speed, beautiful screen, and form factor.  I do find myself missing things like the HDMI port, but was able to easily remedy the keyboard situation by getting an inexpensive case with built-in bluetooth keyboard.  The Note responds well and quickly, even when running multiple applications.  The handwriting experience has been excellent, especially once I purchased the larger stylus (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009PJN1U8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1)  Battery life is nothing stellar but is acceptable.  Another thing I miss about the Prime is the extended battery life from the keyboard.The only two significant 'gripes' I have about the Note are:1) The built-in Samsung apps.  They get in the way.2) The placement of the Menu/Home/Back buttons.  Rather than being left to be displayed by the OS (appropriately placed based on the tablet orientation), they are part of the perimeter of the tablet.  I don't know whether Samsung didn't really think this through or just assumed/hoped that people would use the tablet in landscape orientation 99% of the time.  Perhaps because of the screen size they didn't want any of it taken up.  Regardless of their reasoning, I disagree with it.

Putting this review out there for people like me who are looking for a tablet that will allow you two write on the screen and convert it to text into a document. While the S Pen can be used to hand write text on the screen in a few ways, for a writer, there isn't an easy way to use this feature. You can use the S Pen in their included Notes app but all handwritten text must be selected and then converted to text - not ideal. This app also requires pages to be the size of the screen which means if you keep writing you'll need to add a new page - no text flow to additional pages. This set up seems designed for the note taker, not a writer.I was not able to get the S Pen to even allow for handwritten entries into Google Drive documents or any other proper document app.The S Pen can be used to hand write and auto convert to text within GMail - but that is hardly useful to a writer of an article or book.Ultimately I had to return the tablet as it did not meet my main need. There was also a bit of a lag on functions - as an example if you have two windows browser tabs open, go to the 2nd and then go back to the first - that page would need to reload. Haven't seen that happen on other tablets and not even on my Samsung Galaxy phone.Pros: The screen does look great. Touch response is excellent. The S Pen used as a cursor worked perfectly.Cons: S Pen support limited within Apps. Handwritten to Text feature not good for writers of large documents (prob. ideal for note takers).

I have two Alienwares, an all-in-one Gateway touchscreen desktop, a Kindle (Paperwhite edition), and a Galaxy Note 3 smartphone. On top of these, I have a powerful desktop which I built myself with top-of-the-line pieces of hardware. Why should I buy a tablet? That's the question I asked myself over and over before I bought the new Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 edition) with LTE.I told myself that after buying the tablet, it would be my chief e-reader and I'd have to give away my Kindle. I thought it would make for a great browsing device while lying down in bed. Well, I was wrong. My new tablet CANNOT replace my Kindle. The reading experience with my Kindle is much more better. The Kindle Paperwhite is superb; it feels much like a book and offers more than any physical book can. Holding the Kindle is more comfortable compared to by new tablet. There is no way the table can replace my Kindle.As far as browsing the internet goes, I really do not know where this tablet fits. It's neither as small and easy to hold as my smartphone, nor is it as sophisticated as mt M11x laptop. It cannot render web pages as good as my laptop can; it does not run smoothly as my laptop either. Plus, you really would need a kickstand of some sort if you are going to be viewing an hour-long movie on it; not so with my laptop. For those, who thing this tablet, or any tablet for that matter, for that matter will be great for note-taking in classrooms and board meetings, I'd say good luck to you. You can draw with this tablet, scribble short notes, create scrapbooks, and do some other little things like that. But as far as serious note-taking is concerned, no note-taking on a tablet can compare to writing with a pen on an actual piece of paper. Period!To be fair, the tablet is gorgeous as far as tablet goes and has some impressive specs, but I still do not know what task to assign to this device. What sort of task will be best done on a tablet? That's the answer I am yet to find.Some people have complained of occasional lag and stutter with this tablet. I have noticed it too. It makes my wonder what good the 3GB of RAM does. Why would Samsung tot optimize it's Touchwiz to prevent this sort of thing?With all that said, and this is why I rated the tablet with 4 stars, this appears to be the best Android tablet in the market today. I say this with respect to it's design, hardware specs, and level of performance (bearing in mind what tablets can actually do).", "Title": "I still do not know what task to assign to my tablet", "Date": "June 11, 2014"}, {"Author": "Javier", "ReviewID": "R36EEYNY0CRW8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet used in Amazon warehouse deals for less than 300 dollars, No lags so far and everything works like new.", "Title": "Perfect for me!", "Date": "June 10, 2014"}, {"Author": "Matthew Meredith", "ReviewID": "RLR1BO6AUS9RV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this tablet on the daily.

The description stated that there was a 1/4\" by 1/4\" \"cosmetic\" flaw on the front of the device. The description also mentioned that there was no original packaging or user manual. For these reasons alone, the description stated that it was selling the device for approx a 25% discount. There was no mention of any issues with functionality. When I received the tablet, I inspected it to identify where the cosmetic flaw was on the front of the device but could not find it. When I began to use the tablet, I began to notice that the functionality was severely compromised in a variety of ways.Text, buttons and other functional elements were frozen or missing from virtually every application. For example, it was impossible to browse the internet from any browser, it was constantly freezing or rapidly refreshing and chunks of the page would black out. Text would disappear from buttons or windows making it impossible to read and click/tap as needed. In some cases, the functional elements would go missing altogether. This happened whether in a browser or any application I launched. It even happened in the settings menu! The display also began to erode very quickly. Within just one day of use, or trying to use the tablet, white lines began to appear even when resting on the home screen.I understand that I received the item for a 25% discount, but I still paid close to $400 and would expect that the device would be somewhat functional. Given that the seller was Amazon itself, I trusted that the description was accurate. When I called to see what could be done, they offered an apology, a return but no replacement.

In case someone reads those comments considers taking them seriously, a few points:1) Yes, I'm reviewing the 2014 model. Please note \"Amazon verified purchase\" under my name.2) Yes, the relative lack of useability of the pen pushes this to a 2-star rating, which according to Amazon means \"I don't like it\". 3 stars means \"I like it\". Considering the one feature that sets this tablet apart and makes it one of (or the) most expensive Android tablet, is a design failure large enough to cause me to return it, I think I can say I DON'T LIKE IT.3)Of course turning the tablet upside down solves the problem of your palm accidentally hitting the home button. And if you use the device without a case and write with the device resting flat on a table or in your lap, you are good to go. However, I (like most people I would think) use it with a case. That is the only easy way to get the device resting on a flat surface at a 25 degree (or whatever) angle that makes it comfortable for writing. Have you seen the cases that can fold back at that angle? They all have cutouts for the different buttons (volume, power, s-pen, etc.) that only allow you to insert the device into the case one way, which is NOT upside down. So, you cannot use the upside down method if you are using a case.3-a)Even if a solution to the problem listed above (accidental home-button-pushing) is somehow found, it still doesn't solve the problem of that little ruler thing that runs along the bottom of the handwriting keyboard now.4)My problems weren't because I was using S-Note, because I don't use S-note. I was trying to write notes in Evernote. The app being used doesn't matter because it is the SAME handwriting keyboard that comes up for all apps. Really, what a nitwit comment.Yeesh, some the people ripping me a new one for my review don't even know what they are talking about. All I can say to someone reading this review and weighing whether or not buy the Note 10.1 is to go try it if you can somewhere - especially if you are buying it for the hand-writing capabilities with the s-pen.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I purchased the Galaxy Note 8 about 4 months ago and liked it a lot, but quickly realized it was too small. I used it to write take notes in Evernote for all of my meetings and it worked great for that. Connectivity with projectors was a problem, and the screen was too small to use remote desktop to get into my work server when I traveled. So when I heard about the Note 10.1 2014 coming out I planned to upgrade and pass the Note 8 on to one of my staff.Got the Note 10.1 a few days ago and it was like Christmas morning. Went through the standard setup where it downloaded not 1 but 2 updates to the Android operating system, downloaded all of my apps and got it set up just like my Note 8. Of course I wanted to play with it, so I opened up Evernote and started writing a fake note. I immediately realized there was a problem because the physical home button is in the middle of the tablet when you have it landscape mode, which is how I (and most users) would use it propped up at a slight angle (in its case) on a desk/table while in meetings. That home button ends up under your fist as you hand write your text across the screen, and about once every 3-5 times my hand touched the home screen I put enough pressure on the button to cause the Note to exit out of my program and go the home screen.Problem #2 is with the actual hand writing keyboard mode. It is different than the one that comes on the Note 8. It still looks like yellow note paper, but there is a weird little ruler running along the bottom. What happens on the Note 10.1 is that when you write, your hand writing moves to the left and eventually off the screen. You can touch that little ruler along the bottom and drag it to the right side of the screen to bring back previous text you wrote, I assume to be able to change it or something. The problem is that my hand would also catch that ruler and drag the text back towards the middle occasionally, which would cause whatever I am writing at that second to be over-written on a previous word, creating a mess with the text that actually ends up on the screen. It would also occasionally have a word jump over to the right side of the screen (I couldn't figure out why that was happening) and so what I was writing would get out of order.This is very difficult to explain so I'm sorry if I didn't do a good job. I tried recording a video of this but couldn't get my camera set up at a good angle. I suggest if you are considering buying this you call some local stores to see if any have them on display so you can try it. If you are like me and buying this tablet for the pen functionality then you really should try it.Oddly I didn't experience any of the lag that many of the professional reviewers (Engadget, Tech Radar, etc.) have complained about. Great looking and feeling device, and it was very responsive. But it is almost like they didn't do extensive user testing on this when they moved the home button and designed this new handwriting keyboard software. Very strange and disappointing.As an Android user since the first Droid phone came out (currently have a Galaxy S3 phone and still love it) this has been a real kick in the crotch. Since I have seen the benefit of having such a device with me at all times at work, and the benefit of being able to write naturally with a pen, it looks like I am going to have to go to a..a...oh this hurts, a Windows tablet.

Now they have a 15 day period in which you can get a full refund or exchange if any problems occur. Exactly 1 day after that warranty expired, I started having multiple glitches on my tablet! It turned off abruptly several times while watching videos, playing games, surfing through the net, it wouldn't charge while I was using it, and the icing on the cake was that by the end of the month, for the last 2 days it failed to charge. I finally decided to take it back to the store to see if I could get a full refund or exchange, because after all its still new, only 1 month old, and with minimal use. I'm not one of those people who's glued to my tablet, cell phone, etc, so my world didn't come crashing down, but its still a huge inconvenience. Their rep, which btw was very courteous, tested it, and nothing happened, the tablet was dead. So, anyway, to make a long story short (too late), all Best Buy could do was send it to Geek Squad to have it fixed! I'll get it it back in approx. 2 weeks from today!! YAY!!I sure do hope either a Samsung Rep or Best Buy Manager read this post. I'm just dismayed at the faulty product I purchased from Samsung. It's still new, and its basically just a lemon. I can't believe that after just one month, my tablet had to be sent back for repairs. I'm just utterly amazed at the poor quality of certain products nowadays. Sadly, I've lost confidence in Samsung.So if you plan on purchasing this faulty product, take my comment into account.If you have any recommendations for myself or any other persons who've had this problem, please feel free to message me.My next step is to send a well written letter to Samsung.Oh well, as I like to say, when life throws you lemons, make some hard lemonade!I'll update whenever I get it back.Update!!OK so I finally got my tablet back............ 3 weeks later......Internal battery was changed, I apologize, I'm not a techie, but yes there were some hardware problems with the device, Geek squad took care of it. Best Buy rep admitted they've had several people come in with similar problems, though their tablets being much older. Got it home........would not charge, tested the USB cable on several outlets, and.......... nothing.Went back to Best Buy, purchased another cable, worked fine. So, Samsung, please include working cables with your products.......please?Been using it for about a couple of weeks since then, guess what? It still abruptly turns off, and it still does NOT charge while I'm using it...... ::sigh::But.......it's working.........most of the time. It's just an inconvenience when it turns off in an instant (even when it's fully charged), and you have to log back in and whatnot.
