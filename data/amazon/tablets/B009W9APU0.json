However, she began using the iPad immediately after it arrived (lightning quick shipping btw) and has loved it from the very beginning.  She takes it to her bedroom, to the kitchen, out on the patio--basically everywhere she goes!  I had expected weeks of trying to teach her how to use it but she picked up on it quickly during the first few hours and has had NO problems.  She's happy.

Second I did not buy this product from Amazon because of two reasons, 1. At the time when I was ready to purchase the 128gb cellular version it was going for a 1000 dollars plus on this website, when apple stores and bestbuy stores were selling this for $929 plus tax. 2. Some of the reviews suggested the seller was actually sending people used iPads when paying clearly buying \"new\" products.Anyways, I love it, its fast, easy to use. You get what you basically put into it, the app store is amazing with so many things that make this ipad great. I can not believe I did not own one sooner.The only thing I can not figure out how to do is, is be able to send multiple attachments within a email. I hope some new application or apple fixes this issue. Its easy to do one at a time, but its not efficient. It seems like a common problem and question that is asked i noticed when googling this issue.My iPad has had none of the issues addressed earlier. It gets great wifi signal all the time and the 3G works great also. I am glad I got this instead of a Android based Tablet.", "Title": "iPad 4 128gb with Cellular", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Author": "Nicholas Escott", "ReviewID": "R8GEFZ48GT0U6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In the family we have the iPad, Kindle fire, Samsung Galaxy and Goggle Nexus 7 tablets. So having used all four brands here is my take on the iPad.Pros:Very fast.Excellent for surfing the web and navigating around apps.User friendly.Very Good battery life.Malware free worries.Good speaker volumes.Good for game apps.Bluetooth.Even pixation.Plenty of accessories online for it.Front and back cameras.Cons:Not the best Colors even with retina display. I wish that they were as vivid as Kindle fire HD for video streaming.Screen loves fingerprints.Cost more.Does not support SD memory card (Only Samsung Galaxy does of the four brands that I have used).Costly brand power adapter.Does not use a universal power adapter like all the other brands. You can not use a universal usb micro cable to charge it from your laptop. You are sucked into buying a new brand adapter, if you forget the brand power adapter at home on a trip.Unlike the other brand tablets, you can not recharge the Ipad with a universal cigarette power adapter from your car or with a universal usb micro cable connected to your laptop.As it is the tablet is already costly enough, why make more money from users if they forget their power adapter?Recommend for surfing the web or using game apps.Not the best for online video streaming.

By the fourth, it seems comparatively lackluster. That isn't to say that the product is bad, or worse than its predecessor, but having owned the 1st, 3rd, and now 4th generation Ipad, here are my thoughts.-- The processor speed and performance is much improved. This is noticeable during use, and the only reason to get the latest version.-- The Retina Display is nice, but personally I wasn't as impressed with it as I hoped to be. Likely because fonts and such are all still the same size. For photographers, the increased resolution will result in extra sharpness, but for most users it won't make a bit of difference.-- The latest iPad really hasn't added much; it's competitors have been adding innovative designs and features since it came out. Apple needs to come up with a creative twist on the iPad that makes the cost difference worth the purchase.Bottom Line: I have bought iPads for work use, to test products and features we develop. They are a nice, simple product.

Smooth user experience - I have a Galaxy S2 for my phone and had a 3GS before that, and though Android for phones is comparable to iOS, the iPad and iOS are seamlessly integrated to optimize load times, switching between apps, etc. while Android tablets sometimes lag2. Battery life3. More apps optimized for tablet / high resolution - everything on the mini looked fuzzy in comparisonCons1. Weight - iPad is heavier than the Nexus 10 and more than 2x the mini2. iOS is probably better suited for phones than for tablets, where android's customization / widgets would make for a better user experienceThe iPad has met my expectations.

When I first heard about the Retina display, I was sort of shocked by it and a bit doubtful. I thought there was no way that they can make the display any better... but I was wrong, it looks better than any still photo! It looks more real, realer. It is absolutely amazing. I got the 16GB Wifi only and have not had a problem with it once. I did get this one since I was not interested in the iPad Air that they had coming out, and I already had a 7 inch Kindle, so I was not interested in the iPad mini that was already on sale.I do not regret this purchase at all, everything on it works wonderfully, I got a Fintie case for it that rotates which is wonderful, and I must say that this iPad is the only thing in the world that is as close to perfect as anything or anyone can get. Pictures look wonderful, games look fantastic, and The Cloud works very well on this device. There is no set up time, just enter your email and password (or make an account) and that is it you are ready to use/share on The Cloud.I have to say now after experiencing Apple and their products, I now will be purchasing all their products (the products that I need) so they can all work together and accommodate one another. Right now I have an iMac and iPad and they work wonderfully together. Syncing my PC takes a bit more time, but it does indeed work. Although it is not as quick or seamless as my Apple products syncing with each other, but of course they are using the same iOS, etc. so that is understandable.This device is a masterpiece, best little computer there is, and is a absolute pleasure to have.5 stars all the way!!

They had it in stock, so I was thrilled with the fact that I could walk out of the store on my lunch break with a fully functioning new iPad.  I'm a sucker for picking things up in person, unless it means waiting on a line with people who think they are 'making history' with their purchase, in which case I just have it shipped to me at home or work, most likely from Amazon.This is my first iPad.  I held off on buying one because I'm a film geek and wanted a full HD display.  When Apple came out with the Retina Display, I thought, \"That's great, but with a maximum of 64GB it's still just a toy.  I need at least 120GB.\"  And then they came out with a 128GB model plus a better port and it was time to buy.  All my friends who rushed to buy the first iPad, the iPad 2, and 'The New iPad' as the 3rd generation model was called were definitely jealous; but more important for me was that I got exactly what I wanted.In fact I was so happy with getting exactly what I wanted that when the iPad Air came out, a little faster and lighter than the one I bought, it didn't make a difference to me.  Sure, I'm looking forward to when Apple comes out with what I predict will be a larger, more powerful, fully functioning computer in iPad form--and I'm predicting it will be called the iPad Pro--but even then I'll probably wait until at least the next generation of that model before buying it unless it features the ability to use Final Cut Pro (which no current iPad can do).Will you regret buying this one instead of the iPad Air or waiting for the next model?  I don't think so.  First thing, it's nearly as powerful as the iPad Air, and if you wait for the next model you're going to pay top dollar.  If you wait for the price to drop, then you're going to want the model after that.  And the cycle of suffering on this matter is endless.When you're ready to buy, then buy.  Buy the one you want.  This one versus the Air, personally I think the only significant difference is price, that you're not missing something.

Safari is an wasting Internet browser to use and, while you can't customize settings as much as a laptop computer, it has excellent malware protection and is set up very conveniently for the casual browser. It's a good weight too. While shopping for my tablet, I've looked at and held many other brands. A common problem (for me) is that a lot of them felt too light for their size. This is probably because apple uses aluminum for the back cover of their tablet instead of plastic. It feels sturdy, and that's a good thing when it comes to durability. Another excellent apple quality? The apps! I know, other tablets have apps too, but apple has kind of cornered the market on app production. Most of what you can find on an android or kindle tablet, you can find in the apple store (and then some). See an app not available through apple? Probably a good thing! I've learned that Apple screens all of their apps before putting it up in the store. This means that there are no major malware problems. There are some disadvantages of course: 1- you have to buy directly from apple as they do have monopoly on their stuff and a lot of imitation items are suspect (this can get pricey), 2- you can't really open two screens the way you can simultaneously on other devices. This is not to say that you can't have two (or more) things running at once, but you have to switch entirely between them and can't view both on the screen at once. 3- there are many conveniently pre-downloaded onto other tablets that are very useful for students and office work. You can get a lot of those same apps through the apple store, but many of the better ones are not free and you have to pick and choose your way through quite a few applications.There are probably more then 3, but these are the ones that stood out to me.
