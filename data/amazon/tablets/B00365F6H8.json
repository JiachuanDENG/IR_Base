Smartphones offer the ultimate in portability plus a camera and the ability to place calls.  Notebooks offer a reasonable amount of computing power plus an expectation of portability especially in the 13 to 15\" screen size areas.However, smart phones are very difficult to use because the screens ARE so small. Web browsing , reading and responding to email are a chore. Notebooks provide all the functionality of desktops except expandability and usually video cards required by high end games are lacking.  But even though they are transportable, for many simple functions that such as email and web browsing, they can be cumbersome to set up and take down.  Any larger screen size than 15\" and its unlikely it will leave home.  The cost of laptops has fallen considerably over the years and from being primarily a business tool, laptop owners use the machine as their primary computer for personal use.  The laptop is unobtrusive, can be moved from room to room especially if wireless internet is available, and does not have the dearth of cords and junk that seems to easily collect around an embedded laptop.  Still, in spite of its portability, many people would just rather leave the laptop behind if their travels do not require work specific needs.Sensing a need for an email machine, web browser and the ability to run regular programs should the need arise, the computer industry introduced the low cost NETBOOK. There was certainly some interest in these machines as they allowed a very convenient way of checking email and web browsing while traveling around town without the bulk of a laptop.  A NETBOOK could literally be folded up and placed in a purse or cargo pants pocket.However, consumers soon noticed limitations and annoyances about the NETBOOKS.  Durability was in question.  Cheap production meant a cheap product which easily broke down.  Installs of software had to be downloaded or an external drive hooked up to it. The screen was small and especially for older eyes, hard to read and make out was was being viewed.NETBOOKS were still computers and required all the maintenance of one: anti-virus had to be installed / updated or else it was susceptible for infections by any type of badware.  Startup programs had to be monitored to insure \"too much junk\" was not loading or its already slow boot times would be further impeded.  Many programs ran sluggishly, creaking along primarily on ATOM processors.  The Windows 7 Starter edition was a crippled version of Windows 7, lacking functions and the ability to run certain  programs which ran under \"normal\" Windows 7, diminishing some of its expected capability.Though the NETBOOK could be taken anywhere, its optimistic battery times were usually half its advertised rate under real world operations and begged still for the presence of a desk or other table like furniture to set up upon for proper control and use of the cursor.And then Apple announces the iPAD, a tablet style computer.  Tablets existed before and many of them were just morphed Windows machines into the tablet form factor with styluses that often found their way into toilets, sewer grates, and dog maws.  And a Windows tablet is typically priced 20 to 30% higher than a corresponding laptop.  It seemed a little overkill to check email and web-surf.Few guessed how well the iPAD might sell. SuperGeeks decried the lack of a true USB port, camera and the fact DOSBoX could not be installed nor a game controller, let alone a boot configuration into Linux.  They foresaw little use for such a device and predicted its utter failure.  But since its release a little less than a million a month have been selling.  Granted the Flash, Python, MySql, sed, XCode, and Linux demographic were entirely ignored; but the habitual e-mailers and Websurfing crowd was not.  And especially at these two tasks, the device excelled. Add in some other useful tasks such as e-reading, to include comic books (previously a chore on a PC or even Mac with incessant mouse / key scrolling / zooming and clicking), and some games with various other programs and the iPAD became an overnight sensation.At once other companies began to announce various tablets of their own.  Microsoft and HP each announced products based on Windows 7, but bailed when it became apparent their technology and Windows could not deliver what they originally envisioned.  Other companies instead decide to work with the Android OS, already in use on phones and scale-up to tablet seemed much more promising.This is all fine and good, a summary of this slice of industry from my viewpoint--so HOW does the PAD benefit me?1.=The iPAD is available NOW (though not on Amazon at a reasonable price YET).  Announced products that are canceled or have uncertain release dates are of little use.2. = The iPAD is unbelievably portable and unlike a smartphone, the screen quite readable.3.= I have not read a comic book in years.  This allows a small collection available at all times.4.= The entire works of Shakespeare are available FREE in a 1.6 lbs form factor. And the type can be ENLARGED.5.= Scads of translations of the Bible are available FREE in a 1.6 lbs form factor. And the type can be ENLARGED.6.= The Quran available FREE in a 1.6 lbs form factor. Jewish friends may be upset  because they don't see the Torah's Icon, but remind them the 16 translations of the the Bible's first five books is the Torah. And FREE. Also the type can be enlarged.7.= If  WiFi is there, the WEB is there.8. = EMAIL is very easily accessed, ALL ACCOUNTS.  If one has multiple accounts, the iPADs interface makes it easy to monitor them without going around to various websites to log in and out of them9.= Drawing / sketch apps allow direct sketching on the screen.  Previous technology required cabled Wacom tablets or a Wacomized computer with propitiatory stylus.10. = Artists often make use of reference material to better paint or draw an accurate representation of an object.  Researching on a computer usually requires the expected Google search (or library visit in the olden days).  Once an image was found, it had to be added to a paint program, resized and printed out then taken over to the work area. The iPAD  allows one to go to Safari, pull up an image, save it, then go into the photo album and resize it for easy display viewing while it is being painted or drawn paint it.  Other pictures of various subjects can be switched over to easily.  The iPAD's size and the fact it has no spill vulnerable keyboard, makes for an easy unobtrusive. insertion next to an artists work area.I give the product 5 stars less one for, well I'm REALLY trying to knock it down one star, OK maybe for the lack of a USB port for printing to my non wireless printer, and perhaps some nuanced things like the included NOTES text program--no re-sizable fonts, or that I cannot delete spam without opening the email first.  But it is really hard to deduct that star.", "Title": "Surprisingly useful and convenient", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Author": "C.

Pirone", "ReviewID": "R3RCYWTY1PUPEM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After receiving an unexpected bonus from my employer I decided to use it to pick up an iPad.  I went with the 16 gig wifi only model as I didn't want to shell a lot out of pocket and the bonus barely covered the cost.  While I like the device from a \"coolness\" perspective, I have found that over the past month of use that the lack of flash support makes the device nearly useless for effective web surfing.  I would estimate that nearly 80 to 90 percent of run of the mill sites use some form of flash that makes them crippled on the iPad.  Try going to any of the national chain restaurant websites, (fFriday's, Chilis, Applebees, Buffalo Wild Wings) and it's likely that you'll end up not being able to view much if anything.  Many sports news sites or general new sites have huge holes in their pages where flash is supposed to be running.  Even with all the other nice bells and whistles, and the hundreds of thousands of apps available, this one drawback makes it tough for me to recommend the iPad to someone who expects a full web browsing experience from a portable tablet based device.  As for use as a laptop replacement for business purposes, the options in the app store for MS Office compatible software for editing word, excel and PowerPoint docs are quote broad, but not a single one let's you edit in any form that is close to the full blown desktop software, especially PowerPoint which I use extensively.  Logmein Ignition picks up the slack however in giving me access to my work laptop when I am away, albeit it's tough sometimes positioning the mouse on the laptop's screen accurately.  It will allow me though to leave my laptop at home on short business trips as long as I have wifi where I am.  I am going to add on a MiFi hotspur from one of the major carriers to allow me access anywhere rather than having gotten the 3G version, which allows me to pick the vendor of choice and upgrade to 4g or whatever newer technology comes out.  The lack of cameras is glaring considering all android based devices are seemingly coming out with them in their first gen offerings.  My hope is that e next gen iPads have dual cameras to support FaceTime and other video chatting software.  I also hope they work something out with adobe so that flash support comes to the iPad.  Without it, I am definitely leaning towards an android based device as an \"upgrade\" from the iPad because viewing the web is to me what these devices are supposed to do well and the iPad falls way short of acceptable.", "Title": "Lack of flash support really starts to annoy after a while", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Author": "Mac Fan", "ReviewID": "R12HQMALGJ3BLI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When the iPad 3G became available it seemed to be an ideal solution for us to use when traveling away from our home in northern New Mexico.  We knew that ATT 3G service was not available in our immediate area, but that was not important because we planned to use the iPad either with the WIFI in our home and or when we were traveling to a place with 3G. Because we could get a data plan on a monthly basis without a long-term commitment it seemed workable.Unfortunately, when we tried to sign up for ATT service before a trip to CA, we found a glitch in both the ATT and Apple plan.  iPad software will not allow users in an area without 3G to sign up, as determined by the billing ZIP code.When we called ATT and asked how to get around this problem, we were told that the only way was to apply for a credit card with a ZIP code in an area with service.  When I suggested that was a nutty suggestion, the ATT representative told me that the problem was really Apple's and gave me their contact number.Apple, of course, immediately told me that I should contact ATT as this was their problem.  When the Apple representative learned that ATT had no reasonable solution, Apple admitted that I was out of luck for using the iPad in the way we wanted.  It is impossible to believe that neither Apple nor ATT had encountered this problem, but ATT service really seems unavailable.As a result, iPad 3G buyers in areas without 3G coverage in their billing ZIP code end up with a larger, and much more expensive, but fancy version of an iPod.", "Title": "No ATT Service anywhere if your billing ZIP doesn't have 3G", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Author": "Jochen Lauterbach \"jochen157\"", "ReviewID": "R29WAYP3PQNPH1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The IPad constantly drops my WiFi connection, both at home at at work, that works just fine with three Windows 7 laptops and one Macbook.

So, as an owner of the device, would I also consider it \"magical\" and \"revolutionary\"?Well, I don't know about magical as I generally reserve that for unicorns and the like. I've logged several hours on the device since launch day to give you a well-rounded account of the great, the not so great, and hopefully help you know if the iPad is right for you!--Overview:I really love my iPad. Like many, my first impression was that it was just a giant iPod Touch. I've come to realize that's not the case. In fact, it's so much more useful than an iPod Touch, I just chuckle these days when people say this. For me, the applications, utilization of the extra space, and the web capabilities that really won me over. There are a few features I'm really hoping are forthcoming in a future software build that would make the device even more useful. On the whole, the iPad has become an extremely useful device that's got my laptop feeling a bit unloved and jealous these days.--Hardware:There's no denying the iPad is gorgeous. Apple has re-envisioned the beautiful look of the iPod Touch/iPhone in a fuller form. The screen is flawless and (as I unfortunately learned) very resistant to scratching. If you intend to use the device outdoors you'll want to know that the high-gloss on the screen makes it very difficult to see in direct sunlight at times. The speaker and mic are great in this device. The speaker will fill an entire room with sound. Unfortunately, Apple (yet again) put a focus on design over ergonomic. The iPad is a bit hefty, and a bit difficult to hold for long periods of time. It is; however, much sturdier than you might expect from the pictures.The processor works extremely well with the iPhone OS, it's a screaming combination that makes this one of the fastest tablet computers I've used in ages. That being said, much of the software is designed for the less powerful iPhone still. We'll see how the iPad's speed stands up to a new wave of software designed for 1GHz mobile processors soon enough. Initially; however, it's been unimaginably quick.Battery life is amazing. I'm getting at least 8 hours (even watching video) and sometimes more. I also opted for the 64GB version of the iPad. It has plenty of storage for what I've been using the device for, but as my video collection becomes progressively more High Definition, it won't be long before I have to start picking and choosing what I can place on my iPad. This is not something I'm happy about in a device costing $699 + Tax that's so clearly designed for HD video and content. I'm also very disappointed in Apple's decision to not include an SD card reader for the device. This is one area where the HP slate still has a compelling advantage. There are many instances in which, popping in an SD card and being able to access the documents, images, music, and video stored on it would be extremely nice. Apple has planned an accessory for the iPad which will allow you to port your photos to it via an SD card adapter, but that's the extent of its functionality with SD cards. That's a definite delta for me.I have the Wi-Fi edition as the 3G version has not been released yet. I've run into a few instances where it would have been extremely nice to have 3G connectivity. If I had to make the choice over again, I think I would question my decision that everywhere I go has Wi-Fi anyway, and probably wait for the 3G edition. I'd really encourage you to hold out if you think there's any way in which you'd use the iPad regularly outside of Wi-Fi coverage.Just a quick note, I've had none of the issues that other users have reported with wireless connectivity. My iPad has been drama-free thus far. I'll update this review as I encounter issues to keep you aware.--Web Browsing & EmailTwo of the iPad's strongest features are web browsing and email. Safari (the iPhone OS' native browser) is very fast. It's a significantly better browsing experience on the iPad than you'll have on the iPhone. I've found that I really don't use apps for sites like Facebook anymore. The iPad's screen makes it much easier to just visit the actual Facebook site.Even on the iPhone, email has never been so quick and simple. Apple really devised a great approach to email. A quick tap calls up a pain showing you all the emails in your inbox with a brief preview. You can organize, clear, or open email in ways that seem decades ahead of what MS Outlook is capable of. Setting up my Corporate Exchange account on the iPad took less than 60 seconds! It's hard to express what makes email so much better on the iPad than the iPhone/iPod Touch, but you'll know it when you see it.--The ApplicationsThe applications really sold me on the iPad. I can't say enough about the iWork suite (sold separately via the App Store)! This software suite puts a desktop-grade word processing application and presentation software on your iPad. The \"Numbers\" spreadsheet application isn't exactly as smooth, but is still the best spreadsheet app available on a mobile platform. There are just so many great applications already available for the iPad that I can't list them all. My favorites so far are iWork Suite, Sketchbook Pro, Kindle for iPad, ABC Player, and Marvel Comics App. The extra screen real estate makes this device unquestionably better for media. Even the iPod application within the iPad is much smoother than on other iPhone OS devices. The iPad will also run your iPhone applications, and can double their size to help them fill more of the gigantic screen. Honestly, the iPhone applications aren't much of a selling point on this device. They look grainy and ridiculous on the iPad's screen.--iBook Store/ReaderThe iPad does several things well. One it doesn't do well would be eBooks. The backlit screen is tough on the eyes and the resolution leaves the characters fuzzy. As a Kindle owner, I can honestly say that the iPad is not a replacement for that device. This is pretty much universally true of the eReader applications available for the iPhone/iPad. It may be personal preference but I really don't enjoy more than brief periods of reading on backlit screens. There's a reason 700 page novels aren't backlit = ).--I really wish it had...I really wish Apple would reconsider their stance on Adobe Flash. The absence of the key internet video technology makes the internet a little hit or miss. You'll still have a great YouTube option via the iPad's YouTube app, but little embedded videos on places like the NYT, MSNBC, or other sites are just not there at this point. Let's hope that Adobe and Apple either make up soon or HTML5 catches on extremely fast! Until then, the HP Slate may be a better option for users who really take advantage of web video other than YouTube.A camera would also be really nice, especially a front-facing camera for video conferencing. In a dock the iPad seems almost born to video conference! I doubt I'd be taking many pictures with my iPad if it included just a standard back-mounted camera, but it might help developers do more in their applications.--The Accessories:The iPad uses the same (30-pin) style connector as the iPhone/iPod so it already has a wealth of compatible accessories on the market. If you own an iPhone/iPod, it may even be compatible with devices you already own. Here's the rule of thumb: If you have to dock the iPhone/iPod Touch... the iPad won't be compatible, if you can connect it via a cable, it'll work. This is mostly due to the considerable size of the iPad. Obviously, it's not going to fit in that smaller indentation that most iPhone/iPod docks utilize.I really recommend a case, and dock for this beast. I've owned my iPhone for 3 years and never owned a case for it (until a few weeks ago). I got away with that just fine. The larger screen of the iPad makes it a different sort of device; however, and I wouldn't even think of running around without a case on this thing. It's actually a bit disappointing that Apple didn't include one. I'm sort of glad they didn't; however, because I purchased the iPad case designed by Apple and was extremely disappointed. It's of a very weak felt lined cardboard from what I can tell. Its material holds oil and lint making the screen worse when you close the case. It also has such a tight grip on the device that putting the iPad in or taking it out of the case makes you feel like you might damage it.The iPad really needs a dock! You wouldn't really anticipate it, but having this giant on your counter can really occupy much of your kitchen or desk space. I'd recommend a dock as they generally hold the device upright maximizing the space around it. Apple makes a really great dock for the device that includes an audio-out port. Just note, that the case designed by Apple isn't compatible with the dock. Go figure.If you intend to carry a lot of video on the device, you may also want to invest in a video-out cable. The solutions available for the iPhone/iPod Touch will work for the iPad, or you can opt for the Apple video out cables (they actually aren't too horrible price-wise).--A note about iPhone OS 4:Apple announced the newest edition of the iPhone operating system (which the iPad runs on) last week. Some really great features are on their way that will benefit the iPad a great deal! Amongst the best of them- multi-tasking (run multiple applications or processes at once), geotagging, improvements to gaming on the device, and more! Read up on the new OS! It should be available for the iPad later this year.Thanks for reading my review! I hope it helped. If you do decide to purchase an iPad, have fun. It's a great device, and don't forget to try out the Sketchbook Pro, and iWork apps. I really love them on mine!", "Title": "Considering the iPad", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Author": "David C. Walls", "ReviewID": "R1F7NKJBQLVB4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In this review, I compare the iPad to 5 other devices I own, use, and love: the Sony Reader, the Amazon Kindle 1 and 2, the iPod Touch, and a laptop.  As you likely know, the iPad fills a niche that is between an ebook reader or similar device and a laptop or netbook.  Although there are an enormous number of apps available for the iPad, it definitely does not have the full range of function of a laptop. For example, I use my laptop for programming using MS Visual Studio, web development with Dreamweaver, and graphic work with Photoshop and Illustrator.  The iPad can be made to do a little bit of all of these functions, but for any large or complex work of that nature, a full-scale computer it the right device.With that said, I find a similar distinction between my smaller devices (the ebook readers and the iPod touch) and the iPad.  I love my Kindle(s) and will not give them up, however, the big advantage I find in the iPad over those readers is the larger size and the additional functionality.  The Kindle is still my preferred device for reading ebooks that were created as ebooks, but I now use the iPad for reading pdf documents. If you have ever struggled with trying to load pdfs onto an ereader, I strongly suggest you try the iPad.  For most pdfs, there is not even a need to use one of the many programs that help squeeze them down or trim their margins, etc.  Most pdfs can easily be read at their native size on the iPad, and moving the document or zooming slightly can be accomplished much more easily and quickly on the iPad as compared to the ereaders.The screen on the iPad is, frankly, better than I expected for reading.  After nearly 30 years of working with computers, I instanly loved the eink display (as in the Kindle, Sony, etc.) the first time I used it.  It still provides a better visual image for reading than the iPad as long as you have adequate lighting.  However, the iPad screen is as good or better than the best monitor I have used.  It tends not to give much eye strain even after extended periods of reading.  Of course, it is backlit, which is good and bad -- good because you can use it in most situations except for very bright light, e.g. direct sunlight.  The bad it that when you are reading, you are also looking directly into an artificial light source, and, eventually, that will cause eye strain for just about everyone.The iPad also has many other functions that it performs very much better than ereaders.  For example, it makes a very sericeable web browser, with the *big* exception that it cannot display flash videos or animations.  It also does not support MS Silverlight (an environment similar to Flash) as of February, 2011, although one never knows what will happen in the future.Finally, I have found the iPod Touch (and equivalently, the iPhone) to be a very hand device that I can easily carry in my pocket that provides some ereading capability, some web browsing capability, and the ability to run numerous apps, albeit on quite a small screen.  The iPad does all of these things, barring slipping into my pocket, and does them better.  I still carry the iPod in my pocket for quick access to my contacts, my calendar, my task list, etc., but as soon as I am indoors, the iPod goes away in favor of the iPad.  One last point with respect to the iPod Touch or iPhone vs. the iPad -- the former devices have a mirror-shiny finish on the back, which is beautiful when you take it out of the box, but it is absolutely impossible to keep it scratch-free without using some kind of protective cover.  So, with those devices, no matter how careful you intend to be, your choices are to keep it in a cover or live with scratches.  The iPad, on the other hand, has a matte finish on the metal back.  I have no dooubt the it, too, will accumulate tiny scratches if left uncovered, by they are much less likely to be seen and to diminish the lovely design of the iPad.", "Title": "Excellent multipurpose device", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Author": "Richard Stone \"Unity New Thought\"", "ReviewID": "R3FC7E8UCA0Z9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought long and hard about waiting to look at the next generation of the iPad, and at the competitors that are coming out. However, I decided to go ahead and buy the iPad now, partially because I hate to wait for anything...What I've learned so far about the next generation of the iPad is that it will have two cameras, a flat back, even better resolution, and it will be faster.Two Cameras: First of all, I can't imagine using this large (for a camera) as a camera, especially since I have both a Nikon DSLR and a Nikon point-and-shoot. I will use the iPad for a lot of things, but have no need for it to be a camera. I do see the use of the camera with Skype or some other such service, but I have that capability on my desktop computer and don't use it, so I don't think I would use it on the iPad either.Speed: I don't doubt that it will be faster, but the iPad I have is so fast, it's hard for me to see the advantage in waiting for one that's a little bit faster. I also understand that much of the speed will be used to run a high-resolution screen which probably will negate any apparent gains in operating speed.Resolution: I also don't doubt that it will have a high-resolution, but again, the resolution on the iPad I have is so high, I have doubts that I would be able to tell the difference.Slimmer Size: slimmer is better, but my iPad is quite slim as it is, so once again I didn't think it was worth waiting for.Other Models: There a lot of models that have arrived already, and will be arriving in the near future. However, if the iPad versus other brands turns out like the the iPhone and iPod versus other brands, they won't match the refinement, ease-of-use, and overall exceptional quality of the iPad. I have a Droid X and I like it a lot. It does everything I wanted it to do, and I'm satisfied with it. However, the Droid X is a Dodge Viper, mean looking and loud, while the iPhone is a Mercedes, sleek, powerful and efficient.The iPad comes out with a new model about once a year. The second-generation model will have incremental improvements, but the third-generation coming out about a year will likely have major improvements. The model I have just might wind up on eBay if that's true.One further comment on waiting for the Next Great Thing, if you do, you'll wait forever because there's always something bigger, faster, and better coming down the pike.", "Title": "Glad I didn't wait", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Author": "Mumbly Joe \"MumblyJoe\"", "ReviewID": "R2V0CP3XZ4X2ZJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was really drawn to to the iPad after playing with it at Best Buy. I had been waiting for a long time to see what kind of Android tablets would come out but finally gave up on hoping for one that would have the same responsive interface as the iPad and received one as an early Christmas present.I'm an art student and the thought was that I would be able to use the iPad to take quick color sketches and play video games on the go without toting my entire compliment of materials and a laptop around. In theory it seemed much better than any kind of tablet PC alternative since its small enough to go everywhere but big enough for me to see what I'm drawing. In practice though it really didn't work that well for drawing, even with top rated painting apps and a stylus. So lets break it down into pros and cons.Prosportable- not as portable as an iphone but small enough that you can stick it in your backpack or purse and take it most places.3g- you're not likely to find a better deal for no-contract 3g service even with the 2 gb cap.interface- lets not forget the sweet responsive interface, the primary reason that you're probably thinking about buying an iPad and the main thing that sets it apart from a netbook.Reading- at least for reading an ebook, the iPad is much more comfortable to read on than a laptop or netbook. the page flipping animation as well helps to capture that. Though the advantages over an actual paper and ink \"book\" seem to be negligible. It can hold a large number of them, and really, how many books do you plan on reading in any given day anyway?Games- lots of fun games right at your fingertips, most of which are very inexpensive.ConsGames - lots of drek right at your fingertips, most of which tricks you into wasting between 1 and 5 dollars on it.viewing angle- being flat, its really hard to see the thing and type or let it rest in your lap without some sort of stand or keyboard attachment. If you're going to get a keyboard attachment for it though... why not just get a netbook for half the price.functionality- the iPad certainly has all the pieces parts to be as capable, if not more so than a standard netbook but its locked down under the oppressive rule of itunes.  While many things are much easier and more streamlined than on a regular PC, other relatively mundane tasks, like transferring files or signing pdf forms, will have you endlessly trudging through the app store.  The phrase \"there's an app for that\" is truly a double edged sword.SHINY!! as appealing as the shiny surface is in photos, people will think you have some sort of condition when they see you bobbing around trying to peer around your own silhouette while trying to watch a movie on the thing.cost- this is a big one, at least for a student like me. The thing isn't cheap.  Realistically you can get a pretty good laptop for the cost of an iPad, even the cheapest 16 GB one, yet you can't get anywhere near the same level of functionality out of it.BOTTOM LINEI had one for 27 days, for the first 2 weeks it was the greatest, most useful device on the planet. The next week I complained about how my wrists hurt from holding the iPad up to play angry birds and. Then I converted a bunch of comics from cbr to cbz and then to epub for the iBooks app because the cbr reader app sucks. Then I just went back to regular ol' paper comics. On the 27'th day I realized Lenovo was having a year end sale on laptops and I could replace my defunct laptop with a core i7 machine for less than I paid for the iPad.

The biggest paradox is that despite people calling this the apple ipad tablet, it's not a tablet at all, you can't take hand-written notes on it. The one thing that would have been able to define a new category of device would have simply been that. Furthermore there is:no camera,no usb ports,no easy way to organize a file system and transfer/copy,no easy way to print your files, no interaction with office productivity software (Office),the on-screen keyboard is not practical,the screen resolution is 4:3 so you see movies with huge black bars,there is no HDMI out so you can't connect it to your new LCD,no card readers for your photos,no flash support for websites (rendering 50% of the web useless),there are wifi issues (connections dropped),the screen is glossy so you can't read on it outdoors,no multitasking supportridiculously low storage space (even netbooks have over 200gb now)it's very fragile and slippery in your hands (one drop could kill the screen)it will set you back $600 (the price of a full-featured laptop)I could go on for a while but I'll just stop here. What is frustrating is that Apple obviously has the technology to include these things easily, so it was purely a short-term business decision on their end.

They are taking advantage of their brand recognition and marketing power to extract revenues from a purposely made sub-par product.

When I first bought it, I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it, and for the first month or so it languished, just a huge version of my beloved iPod Touch. Too heavy to use as an e-reader. I love the keyboard but not for writing long or multiple emails. And then slowly over time I started to find uses for it, until at this point I would miss it very  much if I didn't have it. It's a tedious process to find the apps that you want and will use, but it's worth taking the time to search. Everything looks so good on this thing! I keep it by my bedside and use it as a quick reference device after the primary computer has been put to sleep in the living room. I have a super weather app. I am not a big game player but I found several that are fun and the iPad makes them very portable. I put episodes of TV shows that I like on it and watch when I am camping and it's raining outside (again, HD is gorgeous on it). I have a musical app that's interesting (Beatwave), and two drawing apps (Uzu and LineArt). I have a bird ID app in it and one that plays bird songs for identification.

It's really fun.", "Title": "A fun toy...don't make it your only computer", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Author": "MiRSD", "ReviewID": "R3CVAC88ADKN1K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the iPad for about a month now, so I've had some time to play around with it.First off - the device is NICE looking. Much like a giant iPhone/iPod Touch, and in fact, if the iPod Touch had 3G and was 4x the size, I don't think you could tell the difference.The device shares the same OS (or a slight variation of it) and most of the iPhone/iPod Touches built in apps (although some are slightly modified such as Mail and Contacts to better fit the large screen).A great touch is that it runs MOST of the iPhone apps. Most? not all?? No -- some apps (I've figured out the hard way) are designed for iPhone only and will simply NOT WORK on the iPad. Be sure to check apps ahead of time to avoid disappointment! Emulation is decent, giving the option of either \"boxing\" around a 100% sized screen or \"2x doubling\" which fills the iPad screen. You either get the best quality at a lower size, or a full screen at a lower quality - a poor tradeoff (also, running iPhone apps at 4x their intended size looks very odd in some cases -- skype turns the iPad into a 10\" phone display that looks like one of those joke remote controls they sell with the 4\" buttons). iPad apps make much better used of the available space, but so far those apps are behind the iPhone counterparts that have been in development for years (and usually cost a bit more!).One big disappointment of running iPhone apps on the iPad are that they don't run the same! Photo editing apps, for example, save all photos at 640x480 on the iPad (but full resolution even on the original iPhone 2G). To edit photos and keep them at full resolution you need to use iPad specific apps (which again are not up to the point of iPhone apps).Much like the iPhone, almost everything needs to be done through iTunes (transferring movies and music, updating, syncing), so those of you who hate the program will need to just suck it  up for this one (even on my newer quad-core PC iTunes is a big resource hog, so I understand the pain!).The 3 sizes available (16GB, 32GB and 64GB) are before formatting - you get about 59GB usable on the 64GB model (which is expected if you've ever purchased a hard drive). Unfortunately there isn't any other storage option available, so if you buy 16GB and need more you'll need to delete stuff to free space.Overall speed of the product is very nice - I only have the original iPhone (2G) and with all of the updates over the last couple years it's really slowed it down. The iPad is blazing fast now, but I wonder how long it'll be before OS updates slow it down and you need the the 2nd generation iPad to get that speed back. Also, a big problem with the iPod Touch are that updates cost between $5-10. Will the same hold true for the iPad?The device is great for movies.. sometimes. It's closer to a 4:3 (fullscreen) aspect ratio than the iPhone (widescreen) so widescreen movies WILL display black bars (and those 2.40:1 movies like the Matrix will be mostly black bars). Movies will also quickly fill the iPad (coming in around 1.5 - 2.5GB a piece).Sound is a bit better than the iPhone, but still in a very poor position (one speaker, located at the bottom right of the iPad) - You'll want headphones for this thing.Wifi is nice, but what about away from the house? the option to even get 3G is another $129. On top of that you need to purchase a monthly plan (fortunately no contract!). Unfortunately, just a month or so after release, ATT has killed the option for Unlimited 3G and replaced it with a 2GB cap (you also have a 250MB plan available for a few bucks less). People who purchase the iPad by 6/7/2010 will be able to purchase the Unlimited plan but will only have the 250MB/2GB plan available if they cancel the unlimited plan and want to sign up again).A big disappointment are the included accessories. You'd expect something to come with it for the outrageous price it costs, right? No case, no dock, no headphones. Just a USB cable and wall adapter. Expect to cough up way more than necessary for a dock, headphones, case, etc.. I went with the A-frame for Ipad and Belkin F8N277tt Pleated Sleeve for iPad - Black , both very nice accessories.A great thing about it is being able to use the web without a computer. No more booting up the PC or bringing the laptop out of standby. The iPad is 'always on' and just takes a click to use it. That's the big selling point for me. The downside is that you lose all other functionality of a PC and have to resort to using available apps (more $$).A bit selling point for me was the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit - being able to plug my DSLR into it, download photos, edit them using iPad apps and then upload them to flickr from anywhere! Problem is, the kit is more $$ (why not just add a USB slot to the thing?), the memory card adapter is SD only (not the popular Compact Flash found in DSLRs, so those people (myself) will need to plug a USB cable from the camera to the iPad camera kit to the iPad to download photos). More stuff to carry around!There are some very cool apps on it - I love being able to hold movies on a larger device than an iPhone. I love being able to put all my photos on there. I love being able to browse the web from anywhere. For that, I give it 4 stars.A couple last disappointments - the things a bit heavy (1.5LBs) and hard to angle anywhere. Trying to watch a movie and hold it isn't fun, and the stands aren't perfect (or usable in all situations). It's also big -- a little too big! Unlike an iPhone which can always be in your pocket, this thing needs its own bag that you have to bring with you.It's much like cameras -- a Point & shoot gets the job done and can go with you everywhere. A DSLR does a much better job, but being so bulky you can't take it with you all the time.", "Title": "Review of 3G + 64GB Model", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Author": "Vincent E.

For me the device fulfills several different functions I have been meaning to purchase in separate devices, like an e-book reader, portable music player for my master bedroom, and electronic photo frame.  Why buy all three of those devices when the \"Apple iPad\" does all three functions in one neat silver (albeit expensive) package?I was enamored with the \"Apple iPad\" the moment is was announced because I saw the potential in the portable e-book reader that not only offered more memory than any other device on the market, but also offered up a full color widescreen display, Wi-Fi or 3G wireless, access to hundreds of applications, a web browser, music player, GPS address book, calendar, e-mail reader.I know, I know, it lacks support for Adobe Flash as a fellow iPad elitists recently pointed out, but I don't miss it.  There has only been one instance where I could not play a video on my \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi;\" that to me does not constitute a crisis, nor does it diminish the considerable functionality the device brings to the hand.  And, I know, I know, the device does not multi-task, but the \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi\" is not a computer it is an e-book reader that also does other functions.  I have a laptop and desktop if I want to multi-task.The iPad 64GB Wi-Fi FactsThe Ultra-Portable, 1.5lbs (1.6lbs if 3G is installed) \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi\" is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.5\" thick \"iPad\" you'll find the screen lock and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56\" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.The silver-bodied \"iPad\" can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A4 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 3G UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR is also provided.The 9.7-inch LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 1024x768 resolution and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The \"Ipad\" is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.First ImpressionsI really, really, really, like my new Apple \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi.\" Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public like I did today!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, etc.iBooks the e-book reader that is specially designed to work with the \"iPad\" is not preloaded unto the device, I had to download it from the iTunes Store; not a big deal.  Once downloaded e-books can be download either directly (through iBooks) or via iTunes.When I connect the \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi\" to my computer and launch iTunes, it automatically sync's the two transferring any e-books I may have bought into iTunes.  Conversely, any e-books I purchase via iTunes are synced with the \"iPad\" automatically.Hands down, the Apple \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi\" is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! Yes, the entrance fee (699.00 for the Wi-Fi 64GB; hey its $100.00 more to add 3G), but I think it is well worth the cost.  I wanted 64GB in order to have room to download app, music, e-books, and images without concern about running out of space.  This is especially true since you cannot add memory to the \"iPad.\"So far the \"iPad 64GB Wi-Fi\" has more than lived up to my expectations and I have no regrets concerning my decision to buy one.

However, it neither brings the same level of unprecedented convenience to end-users as the iPhone, nor does it feel like a credible replacement for the traditional laptop. And yes, it is over-priced.PLUSES+ Display is bright and sharp. A joy to behold.+ Compared with a traditional laptop, it is and feels quite lightweight, and therefore convenient to carry.+ Flash memory means that it wakes up in a matter of seconds. Laptops take longer to wake up from their \"sleep\" mode, and a lot, lot longer from a cold boot.+ Safari mobile browser is almost as capable as your typical desktop browser - IE, Firefox...+ There is an app for almost everything you need, want, wish for, think about, don't care about, and wished you didn't know.+ Video playback (have not tried full HD so far) is smooth and without any jerkiness.+ Audio quality is very good, even without the headphones.+ Managing your wi-fi networks and VPN configurations is very straightforward.+ Downloading and installing apps from iTunes is simple. Nothing to it really. You click to install and the app downloads and installs. No mucking around with install folders, specifying your JRE folder, or such things that we have grown to become accustomed to.+ iOS4.2 will bring multi-tasking to the iPad, so that's another huge plus waiting in the wings.+ The touch keyboard is large enough to enable almost full-speed touch typing. No more pecking awkwardly with your fingers.+ The more powerful processor means that it performs perceptibly better than the iPhone 4 on similar tasks.NEGATIVES- Light though it is, it is still inconvenient to use it for extended periods of time in your hands. You will need to place it on a surface at some point.- The lack of an in-built stand means you will have a terrible time viewing the screen in a brightly lit room. You will need to buy a third-party accessory.- The iTunes software is a frustration-laden nightmare to use. Version 10 does nothing to improve matters. If you have multiple Apple devices, managing them effectively with iTunes is next to impossible. Knowing which apps are syYou never know when a right-click is available, where it is not, when to use drag-and-drop, and when to use the menu. Needless to say, it is the weakest link in this chain.- The lack of a right-click gesture.- The lack of tooltips and the equivalent of mouse-hovers. You get so used to hovering your mouse over a link or text or image and seeing more information about that markup that you sorely miss it on the iPad. Especially when browsing. You sometimes feel like you are taking a step in the darkness when you click on a link that you don't know what it is going to lead to.- The automatic content orientation from portrait to landscape does not work quite as well or as expected. If you place your iPad on a flat surface and then rotate it by 90 degrees, the iPad, most of the time, does not automatically change the orientation of the content. You have to pick up the tablet and hold it at a slightly tilted angle, of say 30 degrees or more, for the content to reorient itself. Minor quibble.- You need to connect the iPad into a wall outlet to charge it. Evidently you cannot charge the iPad by connecting the USB cable into your laptop.- The closed, walled world of the iPad. No Flash, no Java. Yes, you can use your browser for most things, but if you want to use apps, then the iTunes stores it is. Yes, the store provides some assurance of safety and protection from malware, but this closed worldview is a regressive one, and reminds one of Microsoft's attempts in the 1990s to wall off its Windows users from the internet. Microsoft failed then. Apple could well fail now.- Price. The iPad, even at its cheapest, at $499, feels overpriced. You can get full-featured laptops for that price, with more RAM, more hard disk, a bigger screen, a physical keyboard, USB ports to plug in external devices into, no limitations on Flash or Java, your choice of software to install, and more...The FutureConsider this. A laptop with Flash memory and without optical drives, if well designed, could weigh just as much as an iPad. Innovate a bit more and provide a sliding keyboard so that you can use a physical keyboard when you want to, and which also allows you to place your laptop on a flat surface with the screen tilted, and you have an iPad competitor.What Apple has managed to do is bring an unprecedented level of architectural integration competence and a very viable third-party commercial ecosystem to the world of its devices, in the form of the iTunes App Store. This, more than anything else, will prove to be a formidable barrier to competition.

I've never really owned many apple products and have always been more of a \"PC guy\", but I decided to try the ipad out and have now owned the 16GB Wifi version for 3 months. There has not been a day that I have not used it... I guess that means I would have to be counted in the \"love it\" group.Yes, the ipad has it's flaws - which undoubtedly have been covered in great detail in the other 150+ reviews, so I won't go into much detail about them. Yes, I wish it could handle Flash, multitasking (which will be added with iOS4 this Fall), and it could definitely use a camera (or 2). Yes, it's basically a big ipod touch and a netbook would be more powerful, more capable, and seem to make more sense.Despite these short-comings, the ipad has a convenience factor about it that makes it extremely appealing. Being able to pick up the device and have it turn completely on in about 1 second is something no netbook or computer can offer. Being able to lay in bed and hold the ipad like a book while surfing the web, watching movies, playing games, reading magazines, putting together a document for work, shopping, etc. is fantastic and just wouldn't be the same on the tiny screen of an ipod touch or while having a netbook laying on your stomach. Perhaps soon some android tablets will offer what the ipad does and more, but as of yet, no other tablet/netbook even comes close to offering the convenience and appeal that the ipad offers. The interface is extremely smooth and I've become addicted to shopping in the curated app store. It's much easier to navigate and find apps than in the cluttered android marketplace. I've even found that I love some of the games offered - something I never imagined myself using the ipad for.As for the Wifi vs 3G debate, I can only say that I'm pleased I went with Wifi because it rarely leaves my house. Even if I do take it somewhere else, there is usually Wifi available and if not and I need 3G access somewhere, I have my phone. I'm equally happy I went with 16GB, because I haven't even come close to filling it up even with a medium sized music/video library and tons of apps.As for the ipad vs a kindle - I've owned both the DX and ipad. I love both, but find myself using the ipad more just because of the wide variety of things to do. The kindle does have the advantage of the e-ink screen. If my eyes feel \"tired\" or if I'm in sunlight, the kindle is definitely what I reach for. I've found myself using the kindle app on the ipad a ton though. It's fantastic that I can buy books from amazon and keep my kindle library on the ipad. I do wish amazon would sell magazines through their kindle app like they do on the kindle though. There are other options on the ipad like Zinio, but I feel it's an area that amazon could really thrive in.A device that I haven't been able go a day in the last 3 months without picking up for hours on end deserves no less than 5 stars in my mind. The ipad hasn't replaced my computer, but it has opened up a new area in my life that I don't think I could go without now... okay, I could but I don't want to.

Nine months later I sold it on eBay (a woman in Russia bought it). Why? First, iPad is for consumption, not for producing any content. At the time I did not have a notebook, and I need to send, not only receive emails. iPad has no keyboard and is bad for this. Even after I bought the external Bluetooth Apple keyboard, it was still way too cumbersome. Second, the Wi-Fi reception is not sensitive - Apple Macbooks get much better signal at the same hotspots; I have compared. Third, Wi-Fi alone is not enough. One needs the 3G/4G connection now and then. But this means paying ATT for a second service on top of my iPhone. I refuse. iPad should allow the iPhone to be plugged in to share the 3G network. Fourth, it is cumbersome to get files into the device, needing either iTunes or email. This is inconvenient.Fifth, I discovered I just don't like a touch interface. There, I said it. With the iPhone, it's clearly necessary but for a bigger device, I prefer keyboard and mouse. Touch on the iPad is imprecise and often does not respond immediately. Often necessary to press a spot several times to get a response, or it will not accept input. Frustrating and I'm mystified why more people don't complain about this. The good things about iPad include the long battery life. The iPad is wonderful for many purposes - schools to replace books - but it's not for everyone.********Update added June 2011. After selling my first iPad, I bought an iPad2 recently to try again. I like it better this time, partly because I now have a MacBook Air also and no longer expecting the iPad2 to be something it's not such as a platform for typing memos. I just use it now to read email and the news in bed, and to read journal articles and magazines. And to carry photos. And for Facetime. This is what it's designed for. Also, the iPad2 is slightly thinner which does make it noticeably easier to handle and the software has been smoothed up. I still feel a bit ripped off that I can't share the 3G connection between my iPhone and iPad; after all, I cannot use both at once so why not use the minutes on the device in use at the moment? Also I would REALLY like to see a USB port to read files on a USB drive. Finally I would like to see the iPad integrated with the MacBook; one would detach the display and it would switch over to being an iOS device. Maybe Apple will offer that someday.

My campus book store says their e-texts are not compatible with hand-held devices, but the iPad is enough like a computer that I can get around that oversight.There are also apps to where I can download and read PDF files and other misc text for class.Super useful to have this on the side while I use my computer for the more intricate school work.I can read my texts and other books better than I would in print and FAR easier than I would have on my computer screen. Being able to zoom-in on the text makes it easy on my eyes and the full-color screen displays the graphs very naturally. I'm so happy to have this instead of a traditional text book (and at $250 it cost just as much as some single-use printed texts).> Aside from being an e-reader, it's pretty much a very-large iPhone.The internet displays pages nicely. Some pages even look better on iPad than on my computer. I generally just use one page at a time though, computer still has it beat on multi-tasting.I like the email, when the iPad is displaying on it's side, you can see your inbox and selected message at the same time, making it easy to flip through them quickly. I prefer to check my email on the iPad.I like that I don't have to start it up. I can quickly check my email, look in a book, or do some basic web browsing without starting up (like I do my computer).> This does not replace my computer, and I never asked it to.Some people have iPads instead of computers, in which case buying the oldest model is probably not what they're going for.

I got this after my laptop failed on me and I went to get a warranty replacement.  My main reason getting an iPad is that it was light, easy to carry around and the touchscreen was easy for me to use.  For me this is very important due to a physical disability that limits my range of motion and limits my hand use, only able to grip something pretty light.A laptop was awkward for me to move around and difficult to carry if I was using my manual wheelchair.  I don't have the money for a second gen iPad, so, I went this one.  I've had it for about a week and couldn't be happier with it and the ease with which I can use and move it.  Like some of the other reviews have said, it does have it's limitations, especially since I do a lot of photoshopping, which has always been best done on a desktop for me anyways.Other then that I use for school, I go online, and for my books for school, regular books (the iPad makes it easier to read books and newspapers because I do not have to mess with pages nor try to keep the book open), the touch interface does not require a ton of pressure and the swipe to get though falls within my range of motion perfectly.  I would drop stuff trying to press buttons bore while I tried to balance and work a mouse too.I'm not sure about writing a full document, such as I would for school, yet as I ran out of money to purchase the program I'd need to write it then export it as a .docx (format required for my school).

I owned my iPad for almost a year before activating the 3-G, and that was only when Wi-Fi would no longer work on my local train. If you do choose the 3-G option, be VERY mindful when using the 3-G. Use \"Settings\" to turn it on ONLY when Wi-Fi is not available, and be conscious about what you do while on the network. Streaming Video, File Downloads, etc.. will quickly BURN through any Data Plan. If you are mindful - you will be able to get by with the smallest $15/month data plan (...but even that adds up to apx. $200 a year....)I would strongly recommend the \"skin tight\" Original iPad Case, which SECURELY and elegantly holds the iPad, and the \"book cover design\" affords privacy from (potentially) prying eyes of the commuter sitting next to you, or you can fold it back behind the iPad itself.

After buying an iPad, I'm looking into replacing my laptop with a Mac Mini and making my iPad my primary computing device.  If you think about it, what do MOST of us use our computer for MOST of the time?  Surfing the web, checking email, organizing pictures, listening to music and watching videos.  The iPad can do all these things.  Even those who use their computer for more \"serious\" activities (word processing, music recording/editing, keynote presentations) will find that iPad can do all those things as well, though you may have to actually purchase an app to do some of those things.  In addition, this thing is GREAT for travel.  Bring this on a plane and you can watch a video or read a book.True, the iPad will not REPLACE your laptop/desktop for most people, but you will find that you end up using your iPad instead of your computer for most things.  You will still need your regular computer for the large hard drive and flash videos (at least until Apple fixes that in an iOS), but you may even find that you prefer your iPad for things like email, Facebook, and the web.Without using an iPad 2, I can't really make many comparisons to the two models.

I use the 3G but i could probably have gotten away with not having it now that there are mobile hotspots and cell phones can be used as hotspots.

I first purchased the iPod Touch which I found to be a wonderful product, but I had really wanted to buy the iPad, but couldn't really afford. Even the iPod Touch stretched my budget. As I got to know my Touch, and all the things it could do, I was very happy with it - but the screen was just too small and limiting. I could browse the web, but spent a lot of time pushing the screen around to be able to read the page. After a few months, I set out to look for a larger device, a tablet. Going for inexpensive, I selected a 7-inch Android device (the Archos 70 Internet Tablet) Archos 70 - 8 GB Internet Tablet (Black). While I found this tablet very good in it's own way, and liked the small size and weight of it, with an improved viewing area, still I realized the Android world currently has some serious limitations. The biggest limitation was the Android Apps Market is so much smaller thatn the Apple App Store. I set out to try to find the Android equivalents of the apps I had on the iPod Touch, but there weren't many. Apps like Dragon Dictation for example, or Netflix, aren't yet available for Android. On the other hand, the Android gives you a lot more control of the device, so you can buy different lauchers which make the experience different. I liked that I could add up to 32GB memory using a SD card, and there was a USB port available which allowed attaching a mouse, keyboard, etc. You can also access the Android device file system, side load apps through the USB connection, and in general experiment with a lot more configurations. But I also didn't like how the Android had the home screens, like the iPod, but you had to go into a app \"drawer\" to launch the apps (although you could also copy them to the home screens as needed). Then there was the battery life - I was finding the Archos running quickly through the battery, like getting 5 hours on a full charge (this may be a defect in my particular Archos, others were reporting more like 8 hours of use per charge). What finally did me in however was when I could no longer access the full Android app market. There was a work around (short of rooting the device), which worked for a while but then stopped working. I could no longer get the most recommended and productive apps. So I searched again, this time looking seriously at the iPad. This was just about the time the iPad 2 came out, and we began seeing the original iPod get discounted - $100 discount at Apple's stores. I saw the iPads on Amazon and found a 64GB WiFi only iPad for a great price, about $300 less than the original price. So I bought it.I really should have just bought the iPad in the first place! Trying to save money, I actually wasted close to $800-$1,000 (including accessories). I gave my wife the iPod Touch, and the Archos tablet sits collecting dust. I am quite thrilled with my new iPad. I don't feel the iPad 2 had enough additional features to spend the extra money, and I figure I might spring for an iPad 3 or 4 or 5 some day in the future. THE BEST THING ABOUT THE iPAD 1 OVER THE iPAD 2 IS THAT ALL THE ACCESSORIES FOR IT ARE BEING DISCOUNTED AT AMAZING REDUCTIONS! As an example, I just bought a case that was orignally $50 for about $16. The case is wonderful and exactly what I wanted. I also bought the Rocketfish keyboard case on Amazon Marketplace for $25, these are still selling at Best Buy for $99 (admitedly, the case was sold as used, but it arrived in perfect condition, complete in it's original box). The keyboard in this case is full size, and the iPad snapes into a little recess which holds it in perfectly.Anyway, many things have been written about the iPad so I'll just highlight the Pros and Cons as a summary:Pro's:-Wonderful bright, colorful screen (the Archos Android tablet is dull, lower resolution, and washed out by comparison)-Ability to browse web sites, read books, scan magazines, and see full-screen apps without having to read tiny print, or scroll around constantly.-pretty light weight (I rarely have to hold the iPad without support)-Design is superb and the device feels solid and well made under apparently high standards of manufacture-my iPad did not have any light leakage that was complained about in its early production, and apparently is a problem with early iPad 2's-it downloaded all my music, videos, and apps from my iPod Touch through iTunes.-the touch is amazingly responsive, a just incredible experience - the Archos tablet was a mess compared to the iPad, hesitant, inconsistent, non-responsive-The Apple app store is amazing. If there's any reason to go with iPad or iPod, the app store is it! There's very little I think of and can't find. For example, I bank at a small, local credit union and thought \"I wonder if they have an app?\" and there it was! I have Netflix, Dragon Dictation, etc. I also like how I can print from the iPad using Print Central application, right to a non-wireless printer attached to my Windows PC.-Availability of accessories is great, and did I mention accessories are greatly discounted for the original iPad?-Tons of free apps! (Android also has a lot of free apps, but again, poor apps selection in general)-iWork (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) is a good selling point, I hope Apple keeps updating these programs, making files more exhangable for instance.Con's:-I don't like the Apple \"benevalent dictator\" control, requiring iTunes, and making the app developers jump through hoops to meet their rules. They got rid of the excellent VLC player (which auto-converts many AV formats saving a lot of time and work) because of their rules. They make developers remove links to the developer web site for apps, which is often helpful for getting information or trouble shooting. This seems petty to me on Apple's part, even somewhat paranoid.-I don't like the absence of Adobe Flash when searching the web (although there are a couple browsers that do display Flash animation and videos - I use Puffin for this). This is not a deal-breaker though, since there is an app for you tube and more web sites are using HTML instead.-I don't like how I have to go through iTunes to download my own music, videos, etc on the iPad (although I understand IOS 5 will fix this limitation)-I partly think the iPads are on the expensive side, although after using one for a while, I do think they're worth it. Still, it would be nice to have them cost less in the future.-Less control over interface and configuration than Android devices (although I like the iPad interface, so no urge to change it).So there you have my thoughts. I wish I would have just bought the iPad in the first place, but live and learn. If you're considering the Android devices versus the iPad, I hope my thoughts have been helpful. I really think the Android devices will come to a point of maturity in a year, maybe two. But there are a lot of users who swear by them and really prefer the customization level, and the freedom from the Apple restrictions. It's just that right now the iPad is the best tablet out there at any cost, in my humble opinion.

I was one of those who wasn't really into getting one, because it frankly looked like an oversized iPod Touch with no other purpose than to browse the web and get email. I already own an iPhone and a BlackBerry, as well as a MacBook Pro. Why would I need an iPad for?For a lot of things, it seems. Thing is, iPad is just a medium in development and we are still not fully certain of its whole potential. But there are several things which come to mind:- Netbook killer: You would really think of writing a 2100-word essay on a netbook? Not unless you want to develop a severe neck strain and a bad back; so netbooks were originally designed for light web surfing and email, you know, the kind of stuff you don't really need high horsepower for. Now, let's say you have a product which will help you in getting to the Web, using your email and twitter without the hassles of turning on a PC.- Media center: iPod helped us in getting music everywhere. iPad is for helping us get our content everywhere, such as movies (it's great for flights), TV shows and videos. After you get an iPad, you will think that turning a laptop on to watch an episode of Mad Men you downloaded from iTunes will be silly.- Magazine and newspaper delivery: Looking at what organizations such as the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times have done with iPad, this is a very serious contender for becoming the de facto way of distributing content currently on paper. I don't think Kindle (sorry Amazon) can match it.- Casual internet use: You just want to read [...] on your lap while you're waiting to aboard your plane, or just want to relax on the sofa or on the bed reading stuff online. iPad is perfect for that, and it also makes you wonder why people bring their laptops to bed.- It will help many senior citizens get acquainted with technology and will make them lose any fears or intimidation they might have about computers.\u00e7I don't think iPad is by any means a substitute for a laptop, but it will inspire users to confine them for mere productive activities.

The ePad revolution is coming and before the end of qtr 2 it will be in full swing. Even MS$ is sending out a new lossleader soon. Android will populate most of the new pads with the MS machine running \"windows 7\" (for ePds)? Who knows how fast this bohemoth is going to run. Right now is a bad time to buy an ePad. Too many are already shipping and you'll see them at your local cell phone store at first. Samsung had 2 tablets available for 6 weeks and then abadoned them for upgraded models. Does this give you any confidence in what you're buying today? Talk about turnover. Where will Apple be by October? The iPad 4 probably. Just my opinion- I may be wrong.......But lets talk about MY iPad. Black, 64GB, Wifi, built like a brick and never, ever screws up. I have it with a soft poly rear shell covering and the 'OFFICIAL' APPLE LEATHER PORTFOLIO for travel. 10 hours of battery life? - you betcha! And thats hours of browsing time. I also read books, magazines, daily paper, etc.. Battery still running strong. Can't kill that battery. I have a dock and a bluetooth keyboard for use in zero-G times. Also works great when the seatbelt sign comes on. THERE IS NOTHING THIS BAD BOY CAN'T HANDLE! I thought I had lost my geek mojo before buying this iPad but I was mistaken. Nobody will ever take my iPad from me. It put the cool back into computers for me. It came with few goodies but the iTunes AppStore is crammed with more and they are all reasonably priced too. I found a couple of overpriced progs but 99.9% of them are spot on for the cost.In fact more than half of them are either free or the obligatory 99 cents. Some of the free apps are big name apps when the iPad is acting as a conduit to a source of data such as the NETFLIX APP.  I am a bass player and the combination of the IK iRig and the software to really perform some amazing signal mods on the output port before hitting the bass amp are phenomenal. The iPad does close to zero latency throughput of bass in-->mods-->bass out . The hardware was $50 and the software about $40 so far. Just an example of what you can do with an iPad and $100 worth of software/hardware. Real time processsing makes this a great live instrument setup for either bass or lead guitars. Of course other instruments such as an electronic keyboard could be thrown into the mix with endless possibilities. I guess that's another point to make. Maybe on the weekend I want to go hiking - well my iPad can hold any downloadable usgs map and keeps me from getting lost.That's pretty important where I live in Tucson, Arizona. With my maps I know where waterholes are, pitches that are too steep to traverse without roping in, etc... I just haven't seen another ePAD that can come close to what I have in mine, albeit the 3g phone would be convenient at times. And I'm just scratching the surface of my iPad. I've owned it for 12 months and maybe it's time to pickup a new iPad2 but honestly, the only new feature on it that I would use is one of the camera's. I would probably spring for the 3gs model too.In short, given whats on the market now and how well I know my iPadI think I would be better off holding on to my iPad1 and see what the iPad3 looks like whenever it comes out. A couple of the Android 3.0 models make the iPad2 seem bulky and thick so I'll be checking them out too.Oh - I almost forgot. Don't buy the official leather portfolio from Apple - go to a dense foam notebook holder instead. The Apple prodcut is just too inconsistent.

The battery life I have experienced with my iPad is nothing short of excellent. I can easily get 10 hours of use before it needs to be recharged. With the Wifi turned on, the battery does drain faster than with it off, but this is typical of any mobile device I have used. Synching content via iTunes is a simple, fast, and enjoyable process, just like synching to an iPod or iPhone. Apple definitely has the best user experience of any electronic item category that they offer product in, and the iPad is no exception. There are apps designed specifically to take advantage of the iPad's screen size and you can also run all the iPhone / iPod Touch apps on the iPad in either their native screen size or 2X to fill the screen. There are some excellent apps available, many for free. Games are a lot more fun to play on the larger screen versus the small screen on the iPhone and iPod Touch. But I particularly enjoy using the Netflix app to watch movies anywhere I have wifi service. I also use the free computer program Handbrake to import my DVDs into my computer. It is then just a simple drag & drop into iTunes to allow synching these movies to my iPad.The only accessory I have for my iPad is Apple's iPad Case Apple iPad Case (CASE-ZML MC361ZM/A). The fit is excellent and the cover folds over the back to create a wedge shape that is great for standing up or laying down on a flat surface angled towards you. I also had purchased the Zagg Invisible Shield protector for the screen, but upon opening it I discovered that I did not like the texture of the material. I feel the Apple case provided enough protection and I have zero scratches on the screen to date.Some people have complained about the lack of a camera on the iPad. But once you hold one in your hand, I think most people would find the inclusion of a camera to be something that they would not use. I believe the size of the iPad would make it awkward to use as a camera, so for me its not a missing feature.

You have to measure the functionality of your technology with the price that you're willing to pay and I have to say that neither the ipad 1 or 2 is worth what apple is charging. With all of the problems and glitches of the ipad I personally wouldn't pay over $300 for it. If you don't believe me go online and search problems with I pad 1 or problems with I pad 2. The problems that you see are not fictious their real and if you buy the ipad you better be willing to do some troubleshooting. Some people have problems with the wifi, but me personally, I had problems with it syncing to itunes . You should know that any old usb port won't work with this device you REALLY need a USB 2.0 port that is directly linked to the motherboard of your computer, and even then it won't charge directly from your computer. You will need to plug it into the wall. Secondly I must tell the reader that you need to watch your accessories . Even though some cables and card readers say that they work with the ipad the ipad is so finicky that they may not . I have a card reader that was supposed to work with the ipad, but it doesn't hence it must be sent back.All in all I have to say that the ipad isn't perfect, but it is over priced my advice would be to buy it used if you really must have one and to get the higher amount of GB (32 or 64) as you can easily run out of space. I bought mine used (for about $300) and it didn't have a scratch on it so it was pretty much new . I got the charger and all the paperwork that came with it, so I had some help, but not nearly enough. My advice to you would be to get used to the sites that offer Ipad fixes before you buy and to anticipate problems. THIS DEVICE IS WAY OVERHYPED AND NOT PERFECT.Well that's it to summarize get it gently used, anticipate problems and glitches and don't pay over $300. Trust me when the problems come (and they will) you won't feel so bad. And definitely get on those apple web sites that offer fixes. I was able to get mine working with their help and I'm glad that I looked them up. They saved my sanity. And watch your accessories sometimes they work and sometimes they don't . Just make sure that you don't pay through the nose for something that you can't even use.Good LuckP.S - If you are the type of person who is not tech savvy the ipad is probably not for you. This is definitely for the person who knows their way around the net and who knows what they are doing. The ipad was not my first tablet and i've learned that when picking out a tablet reviews are definitely key. This is still new technology so you can't expect it to be perfect. If your new to the whole tablet scene I would recommend the kindle fire. It's way more stable and easy to use.

Yu", "ReviewID": "R2F7N6QCDI3H7E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Now that I've had my iPad (1) for 2months, I can comment on what I like/dislike about it.Background; we have iPod Touch and iPad, no iPhone.The likes: it's great for kids, to play silly games.I have a 4-yr and a 7-yr. They like playing the silly games on iPod Touch and now iPad: AngryBird, Smurf, etc.It's lightweight to carry around - but much heavier and bulkier than my Kindle. Just better then most laptops.That's about ALL we like about iPad.The dislikes?- slow, toooooooooooooooo slow to navigate the web: without multi-tab support; switching to another browser window and it would Always RELOAD. since it's slow, this makes the web surfing extremely painful. Hence I'd say surfing the web with iPad is useful ONLY when there isn't a computer around- want to load your favorite song/video from flashdrive to iPad? First, you HAVE to have another computer (eh? is not iPad supposed to be a computer replacement?)!!! Then, you HAVE to install and use the iTune software. Thirdly, even though everyone is now all too familiar with copy-paste, syncing content to iPad from computer can NOT be done via copy-paste -- I haven't fully figure out how (WHY would anyone with 10+years of computer experience have to FIGURE out how to copy-paste???), but it's a HUGE pain in the A**- if you have multiple iPads, and worse, an iPad plus iPod Touch (or iPhone), then the pain to sync content is multiplied: eg, you want some contents to be only for iPod and some only for iPad -- there is a LOT of work you need to do to achieve that, otherwise, iTune syncs ALL your content to whatever device you have connected to your computer.- it does NOT have a DVD player. Sure there is a LOT of contents online. but, what about the DVDs we bought and/or borrowed from the lib? My kids have lots of them, and we just cannot all cramp on the bed with the kids and watch DVD on iPad - but we can do with our computer!!!- typing is extremely slow and annoying: without a keyboard, this makes it useless in doing any serious work (or to type a review like this - I'm using my Windows laptop to write this review!)- small screen: it IS nothing but a bigger iPod touch. It's not big enough for 3 kids to watch something together!- battery: I NEVER get anything close to 10hr - never more than 6hr!!! (which is very good compared to to what any laptop/Windows - but WHY pay a premium for something that is useful for nothing but the \"cool\" games?)- the power cord is TOO short: most of time I use my laptops, I have them plugged in. I want to do the same with iPad - but can NOT do. THe cord supplied is TOO short. So the only want to use iPad is to (fully) charge, use up battery, then back to charge...==> the problem is, when you want to carry it outside, either you carry it half-charge (since it's been used for a while), or you must wait for hours for it to charge before going out, AND you have to charge even when it's only half depleted - significantly reducing battery life (on the up side, your beloved Apple can sell your authentic batteries to make more money, which enables them to create more Fancy stuff like iPad for you to spend even more $$ on...)When compared to a normal laptop, iPad is anything but one - in fact, it is NOT one and you MUST have another computer to make your iPad (more) useful!In summary: will NOT recommend iPad. It's nothing but a bigger iPod Touch.Get it if...- you're satisfied if ALL you get is a bigger iPod Touch- all you care are just the AppStore games/apps- you can figure-type really fast and prefer not to have a real keyboard and/or type with both hands- have too much $$ and won't mind to have another potentially useless toy lying around (think of the Legos you spent hundreds of $$ on - after first use, have you ever played again?)Do NOT get it if- you want an iPad to replace your laptop -- this is BIG NO NO- you want to use it for regular web surfing- you want an iPad whose battery can REALLY last 10hr -> it will NOT- you want it regularly used for watching video- you prefer typing with both handsRecommend:try out some i3 or i5 Windows laptops with 5+hr battery life, relatively light weight, and around $600.", "Title": "iPad? $400 Windows7 is way better", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Author": "Abbey's mom", "ReviewID": "R3D03MS3VTTA52", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "How do I love my IPad, let me count the ways!

I was not disappointed.  The feel of it in my hands and the speed with which it responds when web-browsing are perfect.The big surprise came from the Apps.  The Wall Street Journal App works so well that I now still retrieve the paper WSJ from my sidewalk out of habit, but I set it aside and read it on the iPad instead.  Pictures on the iPad are also substantially better than viewing them on the iPhone (and most of mine were taken with the iPhone!)  But the biggest surprise was Netflix.  When Netflix first starting streaming movies using Flash on the web, that one application would bring my $3000 notebook computer to near melt-down temperature as the processor screamed.  Eventually it would crash before I finished watching a movie.  Many people decried the decision by Apple to avoid Flash on this device, saying it wouldn't be a player in the streaming market.  Well I can honestly tell you that the Netflix App works fantastically well on iPad - better than their web version, and better than the version that streams to my blueray player.  I've watched Netflix every night for the first time ever.The wifi range is no better, and maybe even a little worse than my iPhone on my current network - but that could be because of the router.  The wifi speed on the otherhand is fanstastic.  I've reached upto 4mbps on speed tests.  Maybe if I get a better router it will be even higher.Reading is a pleasure on my iPad.  The action (page turning or otherwise) is smooth and natural.  Some others have said they prefer the Kindle.  I tried the Kindle just the week before I got the iPad and I was shocked to find that it couldn't do many simple, obvious tasks like searching or definitions - let alone copy and paste into a browser for a wider websearch or to quote the text in a paper.  iPad does all of these things fantastically well.  I've had no trouble with eye strain/fatigue thus far and that's a good sign.In sum, the iPad fully lived up to my expectations and that's saying alot considering my discriminating taste when it comes to engineering; just see my other reviews if you don't believe me.  Apple in recent years has consistently delivered while their competition uses up goodwill with customers by delivering crap. (I'm looking at the tablet PC people here - as well as the cell phone and other 'gadget' companies.)  While they make 'smart phones' and 'gadgets' Apple delivers iPhones and iPads.  It feels good to believe in a company's reputation again.

(Some of the moments when releasing a product before engineering was done with it, notwithstanding.)However, I see the iPad as an offering where Apple attempted to get back to basics and fully accomplish a \"design cycle.\" I'm impressed with the power and options of this machine. The clarity of the display and the intuitive nature of the touch screen were drawing qualities. I was up and running, and I mean effectively, right \"out of the box\" with just a few probing \"trial and error\" type checkouts. The \"pop-up\" touch screen keyboard is very good, for the size of the unit. I was pleasantly surprised at that. I got the iPad case, turned it sideways at an angle, and find I can type with relative speed (not as fast as a full size keyboard, but very quickly and adequately for the light, quick notes and composing I am doing on it.) As I've played around, I have seen other features come up, asked myself \"what does that do?\" and figured those out as well. One day I'll go back and review the instruction manual.But, where the notebooks were designed to fill a niche of portability, lighter than a laptop, but still with internet access and some minimal functionality, I see the iPad coming from the other direction, filling that same market segment.It's an iPod on steroids!I do see it replacing a couple of my devices. My calendar and contacts are going on, and I can see myself retiring my PDA. The music and media features will replace my iPod. And, the 3G feature I activated and found to be very useful on a recent vacation trip to stay connected, so no lugging my laptop through security on business trips.Nope. No speaker phone. I'll still need to carry a cellular phone. Otherwise, this would be the one-stop shop. As it is, that is notable to me as a drawback and a slice where a blackberry or other access-enabled device might still be a viable alternative.Just downloaded my first movie. Maybe I'm premature in writing this review. But, I expect that to be impressive as well. So, overall I rate it positively.

And for reading, looking at pics, doing email, etc. this thing rocks.But it drives me crazy that Apple has waited so long to update this to iOS 4.  The iOS 4 features - which have been available for *months* on the iPhone - will finally bring multitasking, the ability to resume applications where you left off, and folders to the iPad.  These updates are merely small conveniences on the iPhone - which you use as a computer only for short periods when you're out running around or whatever.  They're extremely important to the iPad's credibility as a device which you'd like to use as much as possible instead of lugging around a laptop or being chained to a desk.  I still use the iPad a lot if I'm going to be focused on one application for a long time.  But life is often messier than that, so I actually end up switching to my much-too-teeny-tiny iPhone more than I'd like because it's got more flexible functionality.Devices like the iPad are definitely the way forward for light computing, and Apple has done a great job on developing this product.  But it's not quite done - it's pretty freakin' irritating that Apple has taken so long to meet this obvious need to update to the greater flexibility of iOS 4.2.p.s.  The only other thing I'd change is to up the resolution of the screen to iPhone 4 levels.  Don't get me wrong, the iPad's display is gorgeous.  But the nature of the device is that you hold it *closer* than a laptop.  Resolutions that would be really great at laptop screen distance are a bit grainy at handheld distance.  Which means that you feel like you're reading on a computer instead of looking at something that looks like a printed page.  I've noticed that although the iPhone 4 has too small a screen to read really long books comfortably, the crisp text resolution makes it more comfortable than you'd think for reading.p.p.s.  I couldn't give a bleep about a camera/facetime.  Kind of a cool concept, but until our nation has much faster broadband, it just isn't worth the aggravation.  Yes, my experience is that AT&T; is the pits - slow 3G, slow home broadband, and truly stone-age customer service.  Just what you'd expect from a de facto monopoly service provider!", "Title": "Love the device, hate to be *still waiting* for iOS 4!", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3SV4AIK5RA74N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research and even played with a few iPads before making my purchase, so I was not too surprised by its performance. I mainly got this because I can't wait another 2-? years for my job to decide how they're going to let us carry electronic publications. The iPad works great for that function, especially using GoodReader which I find to be superior to iBooks in a number of ways.So far I haven't been disappointed using it as an internet device in my home and offline in most other places. Overall it is basically what you expect: an oversized iPhone with similar features. Web pages look much better than they do on the iPhone, but there's still no built-in flash support. Angry Birds is a lot more fun on the iPad's big screen.One thing I don't like is the email presentation. It basically uses the same iPhone-sized strip overlayed on a full screen message display. There's no way to just be looking at your inbox or other folder; you have to always be looking at an email. It's a minor annoyance, but different than I have my email setup on every other system including the iPhone.I was also surprised to learn that the iPad is still on iOS 3 (so much for my research). I spent over an hour trying to create app folders on the device and in iTunes before I realized the iPad doesn't have that ability yet. I'm disappointed with the number of apps that expect you to re-buy just to increase the resolution enough that full screen looks good. Most apps like that I continue to use in the small, iPhone-size window that opens by default or I put up with pixellation and hit the 2x button. I didn't realize how quickly I'd gotten used to iOS4, but now it's annoying when I click a link on one website that opens a new window, and upon returning to the original site it has to completely reload instead of saving my previous position. Hopefully iOS4 will be out this month for the iPad and it will function more like my iPhone.If you're going to throw your iPad in a flight bag, I recommend the Otterbox Defender case. It was covered by the tax savings I enjoyed by purchasing from Amazon instead of Apple. The case offers a lot of protection, but like its iPhone cousin makes the ports less accessible. You have to remove the back panel to access the charging port, and not all headphones are able to reach into the headphone jack. My wife and I wanted to watch a movie together using a y-cord, but it wasn't able to fit without me removing the top half of the case.Overall I'm pleased with the unit so far. I could have waited for another solution (Google Pad, maybe?), but as Apple's already big in our lives and my work is likely moving to this unit, it was the best choice for me. If you're thinking of buying an iPad, I don't see why you'd buy anywhere but Amazon. Their list prices match the Apple store, but they add no tax or shipping charges.

After working on my laptop all day long, when I want to relax and do some casual internet browsing, reading, watch my photos, etc I want to move away from my desk without carrying my 5 lb laptop with me (and also unplugging it from an external monitor and bunch of other cables). iPad allows me to do exactly this. 1.5 lbs vs 5 lbs (MacBook Pro) is a big difference. Instant on makes a big difference as well. I used to use my iPod Touch for these purposes, but it is too small to browse the Internet comfortably, and overall its 3.5\" screen is too tiny pretty much for antything. (It worked as a e-reader to me pretty well though).I spent a lot of time trying to find a nice netbook, but after looking at one that my friend bought I realized that this is not going to work - these are just small (and therefore inferior) versions of laptops. I gave Kindle a try, but did not really like it. I gave MacBook Air a really close look, but that thing is twice as heavy and three times as expensive. iPad is conceptually new device and it seems to fill a niche that Apple is trying to fill pretty nicely.Some people say iPad is just a big iPod Touch, and this is true - it is a larger and better iPod Touch. This is why I like it. Its screen is 4-5 times larger, and it is less than twice as expensive (as I recall the cheapest iPod upon its release was priced at $299). I would say this is how iPod Touch was supposed to be from the very beginning. I always felt that my iPod touch was too large for an mp3 player and too small for an internet browsing device. May be without knowing it, I became an Apple geek - now I have a Macbook, an iPad, an iPod Touch, and iPod Nano. Probably I will get rid of my iPod Touch, but the other three devices complete each other perfectly: MacBook is for work, iPad is for casual browsing, reading, and checking email, and iPod Nano is for music and audiobooks.I got my iPad, keeping this 14-days return policy in mind, but I am pretty sure I am going to keep it.

Fast forward a few months of basic non-use due to the problems, and I decided it was time to have Apple look at it.  Naturally, they sent it back immediately after a hard reset and said, \"the problem could not be duplicated.\"  Of course it worked for about a week again, and now it is once more useless due to the intense glitching.

It started in NYC (as all great stories do) and I won't bore you with all the details but suffice to say I was purusing Megan Fox pictures - the classy ones - on my new iPad and Tony Blair's PA who was in NYC visiting friends was on the subway sitting next to me. He happened to look over my shoulder - and well, thanks to my gleaming new iPad we hit it off! We went for drinks downtown, partied till the wee hours and 24 hours later voila I'm tumbling in Swiss down feather pillows with my iPad at Davos!Well with the iPad in hand (I leave the case off, it can get kind of smudgy but really a lot classier than those dull plastic looking covers) we dined with Tony (BTW Berlusconi's got nothing on the Tone) and really beat the bush about how to solve the whole getting broadband WiFi out to the poor. We were on to something but then Tony started getting antsy. His PA (BTW his name is Geoffery) leaned over and whispered in my ear that Tony was allergic to asparagus (huh). Well apparently the Tone likes his asparagus but it gives him the itchies in his buttocks (something about the antibodies attacking his hemorrhoids and inflaming them and then bam! he's scratching at 'em like the devil).Of course this was not good news as we had planned a \"party\" back at Tony's hotel suite with Berlusconi (aka Bert). The Bert was bringing the champagne (primo stuff) and Dmitri (some Russian dude) was going to bring his iPad and bunch of \"secret\" apps. Well, I'm not one to miss a party especially on someone else's buck and decided to take action. I took out my iPad cleanser (see above re smudges), sprayed it generously onto the $50 special cleaning cloth I had purchased (I tell you that cloth works magic - I once cleaned my laptop screen and it wiped out the entire drive!). With as much British decorum I could muster I discretely passed the sopping wet cloth across the table to Tony Blair. Not even a quizzical look - he knew instantly - grabbed the cloth and swiped away! There was that winning toothy smile and a couple of shots later we were back on track and solved the whole WiFi issue!Well as you probably figure the Party happened. Bert brought the champagne and his assistants (to - ahem - pop the corks), and a few choice cigars. Dmitri showed us his iPad apps (he's sooo much cooler in real life, though it was weird his secretary Vladimir kept calling him and telling him to get back to his hotel room...) Anyway, we partied all through the next day's sessions, pretty much trashed the room.  During a lull in the mayhem, Tony pulled the iPad cloth from his pocket (well it wasn't quite that elegant, he had to reach under the bed and pull his trousers out from underneath the bottles of booze, but you get the point, and yes I did see the 'rrhoids), handed it to me and said \"Davos 2012.\" Cool.
