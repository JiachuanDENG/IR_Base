I was a little worried about switching to the 16gb because of less space, but it turns out to be plenty of space since I stream my music (from google player and other services) instead of saving it directly on the device.I use the device primarily for reading, surfing the web, watching videos, and editing pictures and documents. However, since I have started using the new iPad, I use it more than my computer, and for many, many more projects. I've started listing items on eBay right from the device (which works even easier than on the computer, since it has the built-in camera). I also have been using it for many projects that require a lot of typing, as the smart case I purchased makes typing comfortable and easy. I've even started playing more games on it because of the incredible processor inside! Previously, I could only run Angry Birds and Diner Dash, as I knew they wouldn't crash (and heavier games like Infinity Blade crashed the old iPad way too often). Now I can run GTA Vice City while multitasking with eBay and email, and no lag at all!Apple has really outdone itself with this new iPad -- of course, I understand that it isn't worth the plunge if you own an iPad 3. However, if you are like I was--still using the old iPad (or no iPad at all)--this is more than worth the money!
