Figuring what you want to know is, \"Is it worth the upgrade?\"Well yes and no.If you are already using an iPad with a retina display (and the display IS pant-wettingly gorgeous), you're going to get a sleeker, lighter, faster version of the same thing. Sure, the camera is a bit improved, but don't you think that people look odd trying to take photos on an iPad? For me, that's not what this is designed for.The first thing you'll notice when you pick it up is how sleek and light it is compared to previous models. It really is a beautifully designed and built tablet. It' also noticeably (but not hugely with the apps I tested) faster. iOS 7 looks fab on the thing.Still, the bottom line is, if you are running a pre-retina iPad and you got the cash, yes, it's worth it (and I use 'worth' as a loose term here, they are bloody expensive). If you are running a newer iPad, sure, this is sleeker and shinier, but I'm afraid it's not going to change your life.To conclude, this thing is beautiful, extremely useful in my life, and I love it like the child I never had :-) Just don't expect it to change your whole life!", "Title": "Simple Review", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Author": "EvansDJ82", "ReviewID": "R3D3OD7YY7Q22E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this at a recently run promo at the local Best Buy ($150 in gift cards that I received for the purchase was promptly used to offset it's higher cost).It is a 5-star tablet in everyway.  I'm fully invested in Amazon media and am glad that Amazon saw fit to put all it's services onto the iPad Air via apps so that I can access it seamlessly.  I have both the HDX 8.9 and the Air even though the HDX 8.9 has a better screen, I prefer reading books and magazines on the iPad Air because of the 4:3 aspect ratio.  I also am happy that I got it because it is apparently the only tablet that works on my company's internal network.The HDX 8.9 is better for video watching, particularly if you're watching without headphones.  The speakers on it are amazing.  However, the speakers on the Air aren't bad, they're  just too close together to practically be stereo.That said, both the HDX 8.9 and the Air are 5-star tablets.  They have different strengths and do different things well.  The HDX 8.9 is now my son's and the iPad Air is mine (because of it's work functionality).You really can't go wrong with either tablet.", "Title": "iPad Air was a great buy!  You won't regret it!", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Author": "J. M. Kahn \"Gizmo Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R3QIG90IQFIVZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had first purchased the iPad when it first came out, wasn't impressed and returned it.  Bought the 2nd version, loved it and have had it ever since.  When they came out with the 3rd version I wasn't impressed with the changes so I kept my iPad 2.  Ditto when they came out with the next version.  But I saw the iPad Air in person and had a chance to try it for myself.  I loved the new camera (much more defined pictures) and the screen definition (it's now hi-def).  Beautiful sharp, clear colors.  So I upgraded and bought it (I bought the white one though.)  I was fortunate that the place I bought the iPad Air from accepted my iPad 2 as a trade in so I got it for approximately $200 less (my iPad was in immaculate condition and I still had the box, paperwork and the accessories.)  I do love this iPad.  It's fast, fast, fast and my games are beautiful.  I have both Microsoft and Apple products (although no Apple computers, they're too expensive.)  Both have their merits, but I have to say one thing for the Apple products, upgrading to new devices and transferring all your programs, particularly games, is so much easier.  On Microsoft products, with Windows, you have to reinstall all of your games and programs, and with the games pray that the new operating system will let you play your old games.  In most cases it won't and you have to go through a bunch of iterations to play them (and I say this while typing on an HP Laptop which I use daily and would rather DIE than go without it!)  I don't know why Microsoft, (maybe it's the game developers) won't let you back up your games or the programs like Excel, Word, etc (even though you've already paid for them.)  But with Apple you just attach it to your computer  and sync it (hopefully you backed up your iPad, or whatever, to it) and voila, all your previous games, music, programs are on the Apple product ready to use just where you left off (most of the time anyway.  On a few of the games I had to start from the beginning, but I think that's because of the developer, not the iPad because some of them I did start where I left off.)  Also, set up for programs such as mail is minimal (just put in your user name and password and you're ready to go.)  I wish Microsoft would come out with something like that so I could purchase a new computer without the fear of not being able to play my favorite games.  Anyway, bottom line I LOVE my new iPad Air.  I even found a case that allows me to swivel the stand to either landscape or portrait positions so that I can read the newspaper or books on it and eat at the same time without having to try and prop it up on something (bought the case on Amazon.com, it's a Targus Versavu).", "Title": "iPad lover", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "Xachary Dinsmore", "ReviewID": "RSJSN0GPTVMU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have historically been an Android person, However, this time I decided to give Apple a whirl. In comparison to an Android device it is far less customizable. You don't get to install different keyboards, or load widgets onto 8 different home screens, or install a completely different launcher all together, but this doesn't mean it's all bad. The user interface is very simplistic, but that actually works fairly well on a screen this size. The only thing that really sucks about it is that you can't hide the infrequently used apps quietly off to the side in the app screen like you can with Android. You are staring at all the apps at once from the home screen mo matter what. Even all neatly organized in folders it can still be a little hard to find what you are looking for. This coupled with the lack of information on the home screen(such as you get from a widget) would make me really dislike this on a small phone screen. It does work fairly well with the 10\" screen though, and the multi touch gestures make switching between apps and multi tasking a breeze.  This thing is extremely fast as well, you really can't slow it down. 10 browser tabs open, streaming music, playing a game, and checking your email, all while jumping back and forth between them is completely seamless. It literally feels like you can't feed it input fast enough to make it even stumble a little.  The battery life is also excellent. You will be hard pressed to kill it in a day. You would have to be gaming on it for hours to accomplish a dead battery I would think. I think the battery life is the perfect balance, to increase it any would in my opinion probably mean a sacrifice to either performance or weight and size. I typically get about 2 days of moderate use out of it.  For those of you on the edge between this and an Android device(or the constantly improving world of Windows mobile), the App Store selection is about the same. For the types of apps I use there seems to be very little difference, the are both excellent for social media, media consumption, email, and browsing the web. I do somewhat prefer the BaconReader reddit client app for android over what I have found here, but that is a very minor complaint. There are a few apps that are paid on iOS that you can get for free on Android, but at the same time there are more tablet specific apps on iOS, so I think it's a fair trade off.As far as day to day use goes it has been impeccable and I would recommend it to anyone. It has been reliable, fast, and had great battery life, any complaints are minor and subjective. In case Amazon rolls my review in with all the iPad Air models, which they probably will, I have the 32GB white version. I would also recommend avoiding the 16GB, after everything is all updated and the included free apps installed, you will only have a couple GB left for apps and media.", "Title": "Great, even for an Android fan.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Author": "T. Marble \"Movie fan\"", "ReviewID": "R3LCL3HZ6ENZHM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had several tablets... Sony Tablet S, nexus 7, ipad mini, and now the ipad air... This is definitely my favorite.  The screen is big enough to allow for relaxing reading, but it's thin and light enough to carry around without it being a chore. Battery life is amazing. I easily get 10 to 15 hours on a single charge with normal use. Build quality is superb. I have an apple ecosystem at home, so it fits perfectly. My Mac mini, iPhone,apple TV, all seamlessly communicate. This works so well, I've decided to no rush into buying a MacBook Air.", "Title": "Best tablet for normal people.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "Michael Sullivan", "ReviewID": "R13FGE9ZVT4R5L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad Air is, without exception, the best piece of technology that I have owned, and I have owned nice tablets and computers before.  One of the first things that jumps out about this device, beyond the gorgeous display and excellent speed, is the long lasting battery life.  I have owned this tablet since the day it came out, and I am still averaging about 10 hours of battery life on it.  That is a good thing, too, because if one gets this tablet, they will be using it a lot.  That is, by and large, due to the tremendous versatility that the iPad Air provides it users with.  I have effectively utilized this tablet at both work and in my graduate courses, and by my judgement, my performance has seen a boost by consequence of that.With that in mind, it must be acknowledged that the iPad Air, or more generally, apple products are more expensive.  Critics of the iPad often point to that very fact, but a \"premium\" price boost to a top of the line product is not unique to the iPad - the nicest things are also invariably the most expensive things.  Because this tablet is so well made, there will typically be very little to no frustration associated with it.  It gets the job done across the board, be it for personal or professional use.  It is for that reason that the iPad Air is worth the extra $100-300. As a graduate student, I cringed at my bank account after I purchased this, but at this point, I'm honestly relieved that I got the iPad.  $600 may seem like a lot at first, but by the time a month has gone by, and one realizes how much they actually use this thing, that $600 will start to seem like a small price to pay.  Once a former galaxy tablet loyalist - now firmly in the iPads corner.  Truly, this is such a well made device - it really doesn't get better than the iPad Air right now, and it probably won't until the next IPAs either.", "Title": "A Transcendent Tablet - Apple Delivers This Time", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Author": "Voenix Rising", "ReviewID": "R11YB5ZRVSQ3BX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "While technically ALL iPad Airs are \"unlocked,\" and can be used on most any carrier, I was extremely dismayed to learn that the Air I received from TechGiant arrived with an IMEI (a hardware identity number unique to every device) that was locked to AT&T.; Because of that lock, it's not just a simple matter of swapping out the SIM card to get it on the carrier of your choice. In my case, Verizon had to scan the IMEI of one of their own devices in order to activate one of their own SIMs to use in this Air so that it could be added to my existing account and used on their network. Yes, in the end it worked, but it was a huge hassle and if I'd known beforehand that the device would arrive this way I would not have purchased it from this seller, instead going directly to Apple or Verizon.", "Title": "Buyer Beware", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Author": "Danamite", "ReviewID": "R34DQA57YUOFR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I managed to avoid 5 generations of ipad purchases (including the 1st generation mini) but this one finally got me. My eye doctor told me if I didn't stop being ridiculous and using my itouch as an ereader (I know, I know but it was so portable!) I could kiss my 20-20 vision goodbye. Basically Apple can thank my optometrist. That being said this thing is gorgeous. It takes beautiful photos and video, the screen is crisp and clear. While I don't run around in public taking photos and video with it I'm happy it has the capability. It's great for watching movies on the go and I've been very happy with the battery life.So why should you buy this one? It's a reasonable size without sacrificing screen size or quality. I think the ipad mini is cute but I have friends who practically have smartphones with a screen that size. It wasn't worth the price for me. We have other ipad products in my family, I've never been motivated enough to go out and buy my own but this one is a good size. It fits in a normal size bag or purse and makes me feel like I'm carrying around a pad of paper rather than a small laptop.I've had several people ask me why I bought a ipad instead of a kindle fire or the like. As I said, we have a lot of iproducts at my house and I'm very happy with itunes. This way I can easily swap movies, tv shows, ebooks, various apps I need on a daily basis around and basically this has turned into a backup laptop for me. The functionality was absolutely worth it to me.I guess if I were to say anything negative it would be 1) I'm never going to live down finally having bought one after saying I wouldn't for so many years and 2) my iphone and itouch now seem incredibly small. I'm hoping the iphone 6 releases soon and has a bigger screen.

The total length of the lightning cable is approximately 3.25 feet. Being used to longer cables, I've accidentally yanked this thing a few times but that hasn't done anything to my iPad Air... yet. However, you can probably purchase a longer lightning cable online.Also, I found the rate that the iPad downloads apps is about 5x slower than even an iPhone 4. Apple support told me this is usually because newer devices have a lot more to do like connecting to iCloud for the first time, etc, but I don't buy it. I think it's just because iPad apps are a lot larger than iPhone so I don't expect this to change, but I'll update if it gets any faster. UPDATE: Yes, my iPad does download at fast speeds now after one day, so don't worry if you encounter the same issue at first!While these two points are on the negative side, keep in mind that my overall experience is easily still 5 stars.

Yes the iPad Air is thinner than previous iPad models and it may be faster.  Honestly I didn't see much of a difference in speed between the iPad Air and the iPad 4 while surfing the web.
