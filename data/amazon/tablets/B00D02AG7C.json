I've only had it for a few weeks to date but I'm so glad I got it.  I bought the 7\" Galaxy Tab 3 because I want something very light weight and small enough to put into my purse.  It holds a charge for a long time and I can use it for multiple things i.e., computer, email, countless apps, etc.  I am very happy with my purchase and don't hesitate to recommend it.  It is very easy to use.  I had no trouble figuring out how to adjust the font.  It also has an easy way to see what page you're reading on, how many pages in the book total, how much time it will take to read to the end of the chapter.  It is easy to bookmark.  It also gives you the ability to adjust the brightness of the page.  All of these things are very easy to figure out.

I have also had various iPhones in the past but now own a Galaxy S4.  There's the background on what I'm familiar with.I didn't purchase my iPad 1 new...used on Craigslist.  I just can't bring myself to spend $500+ on a new iPad (even though they're nice) when there are a plenty of high-quality alternatives for less than half the price.  To stay on topic...I didn't purchase my Samsuny Galaxy Tab 3 7\" on Amazon.  My local AT&T; retailer was offering a deal where if I upgraded my wife's phone (she had an iPhone 4 and wanted to join me and get a Galaxy S4) to an S4 they would give me a 'free' Tab 3 7\" with 4G if I signed up for a $10/mo data plan.  So of course I went for the deal.Personally since I travel a bit I like 7\" tablets.  They're easy to hold with one hand when reading on an airplane.  I like this one slightly better than the 7\" Kindle Fire HD...same basic size but since I now own a Galaxy S4 phone I found navigating this tablet EXTREMELY easy.  It's basically a large version of my phone.The screen is great...great picture quality.  It was easy to sync pictures from my phone to the tablet wirelessly.  My google play music ported right over.  There's even an Amazon Kindle ap right on the tablet so all of the books I'd purchased from Amazon are now on my Tab 3 (no different functionally than if I was reading from one of my Fire's).  So that couldn't be more convenient.I give the device 4 stars (instead of 5) for two reasons:1.  Compared to other tablets, it seems like it longer than normal to charge.  The battery life is about the same as other tablets (longer life when using it to read, shorter when watching videos) so nothing negative there.  Using the provided Samsung charger, if the Tab 3 7\" is around 5% battery life remaining it will take 3-4 hours to fully charge.  It seems long to me.2.  This may have nothing to do with the Tab 3 but I am annoyed that there is no app on the device for Amazon videos.  This ap exists on my iPad (so I can use my Prime membership to stream free movies/tv shows on my iPad) but it doesn't exists on my Galaxy S4 or this Galaxy Tab 3 7\".  If Apple of all companies is allowing this ap on their iPad's (instead of forcing everyone to purchase content via the Apple store) why can't Google allow the same?  Beyond irritating.  I'm not purchasing stuff from the Google Play store when I can get it for free with my Prime account from my laptop.  Call me cheap but it irritates me.That's it.  It's a great tablet besides the two issues.  I can't imagine anyone purchasing one and not being happy with it.", "Title": "Very close to 5-stars...and an excellent tablet for the money", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Author": "negrito", "ReviewID": "R2VG66BAY65FDJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just love this tablet it serves all my purposes very good if you not an expert in computing it is very easy to use like it a lot.", "Title": "Just very good", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Author": "oldandugly", "ReviewID": "R2CZLFQWXCR3R3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the Galaxy S3 and the tablet is set up exactly like my phone.

I bought them for my kids for Christmas gifts and my kids love them. I ama big fan of Samsung products, I own a Samsung Smartphone and LCD television and both of them work without any problems. I also own 4 tablets including two of these. I own an Ipad mini and my fiancee has a Windows Surface RT tablet. I feel as though android is the easiest operating system to learn so I figured these would be best for my children. Ok on with the review.PROSPrice - usually if you search hard enough you can find one of these for around $150. Which is a steal for a Samsung tablet. Alot of other android tablets you can find cheaper but they are cheaply made. I prefer Samsung cause I know my product will last.Learning Curve - Android is by far the easiest operating system to learn. My kids were already playing with my android phone before they got their tablets for Christmas so they already knew how to use them. If you can use a smartphone you can use this tablet.Resolution - I have compared this tablet to other android tablets side by side. The brightness and quality of the colors on this far exceed any other android tablets I have seen. Every Samsung tablet is so bright and colorful compared to say a Lenovo tablet. I was told by a Samsung rep that they use the same material to make all of their LED tv screens and Touchscreens so that is probably why it looks so good.Good Camera - Alot of tablets have a low quality camera. This one seems to take clear pictures whether facing front or rear. `Battery Life - I am a big fan of long battery life. I hate having to recharge my devices all the time. I have noticed my kids can play on these for around 6-8 ours before a charging is needed. I feel as if that far exceeds my expectations.Touchscreen response - Touchscreen responds well. You don't have to touch things twice or press down too hard. It responds perfectly to swipes and presses.Case availability - Because this is a Samsung product it is very easy to find a case for this tablet. Of course you can get the Samsung brand case but even if you want an off brand or knock off case you will have no trouble finding one for this model. I found cases for $15.Processor - This has a 1.2 GHZ dual core processor in it. It is quick enough for anything I could imagine doing on it. Youtube, Netflix, and streaming music all work without a hitch. Games download and play fine also. Plenty of speed for the money.Memory card slot - some android tablets still don't have memory card slots. Samsung always includes one so you can expand memory.CONSI couldn't find much wrong with this tablet. Here are the few things I could think of that I didn't like.Hard drive space - Only 8 gigs of internal hard drive space. I guess that is enough for a casual user but I prefer at least 16 gigs of internal memory. Especially when 1-2 gigs are already being used when you buy it. Of course you can add a memory card to it and this problem can be solved.Bloatware - This tablet comes included with quite a bit of \"Bloatware\". Bloatware is programs that are pre-installed before you purchase your computer/tablet. I find the bloatware on this tablet to be excessive as compared to say the Nexus tablet.That is about it for the cons. Overall i give the Samsung Tab 3 5 out of 5 stars. I seriously cannot suggest a better 7 inch tablet. If you are only trying to spend around $150-$175 then go no further because this tablet is for you. There are cheaper android tablets out there but what you are paying for here is the Samsung seal of quality. Instead of buying the $100 Lenovo or Asus android tablets spend the extra $75 and get this. You won't regret it.", "Title": "One of the best Android tablets for the money!", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Author": "Amanda", "ReviewID": "R3SVD20BKZC6S2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before choosing to buy a tablet to use as an e-reader, and chose this one because of its size, price, and the fact I've always been very happy with Samsung products. The expandable memory allows a MicroSD card to expand the memory from the default 8GB for significantly less than it would cost to buy an e-reader or tablet with those same internal specs. The height and width dimensions are roughly the same as a mass-market paperback and are perfect for carrying it around on a daily basis and fitting in my purse.The Android OS lets me install all the apps I need for what I read. Along with several news and magazine apps, I use reading apps for Kindle, Nook, Aldiko, and Kobo, and I'm confident I'll be able to find whatever else I'll need in the future to consolidate all my e-books in one place. Each app operates independently, so I can download reading material directly from the internet to the app or device or update my libraries with what I purchase using a computer or other device. The Dropbox app makes a good middleman for getting free books from Project Gutenberg or documents from other sources to Aldiko.The way the tablet is set up physically makes it perfect for e-reading. There is a button on the lower left which gives different options based on the app being used, and the back button on the lower right toggles you back from the book to the library. To use the Kindle and Nook apps as examples, once the apps are up and running, you would not know you were on an Android tablet and not on a dedicated Kindle or Nook device.Of course, there are other perks to having a tablet, including being able to hook up to free wifi for internet browsing and email, games, Google maps, music, weather, other cool Android apps (which are very similar, if not identical, to iOS apps), widgets, and the front/back camera.

Pombo \"felinelvr\"", "ReviewID": "RI4U4K0GUAORM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this tablet because I have a ASUS Memo HD that has spent more time getting repairs, than actually being used. The Samsung on the other hand is a nice little 7 inch tablet, though 8 gigs of space turns into about 5 gigs of space and google only lets you load apps on the device. So the space fills up fast. I did learn to move my Audible books to the SD card and I can load most but not all my apps on this device. This device isn't as zippy as I thought it would be. But overall I like the tablet. I think the sweet spot for this type of tablet would be 16 gigs and SD expansion to 64 gigs is prefect hence the 8 inch tablet. But I wanted something smaller than my 10 inch tablets, and something I could just throw in my purse and listen to my audiobooks or read my e-books or listen to music etc. I am not crazy about Googles/Android web browsers and the whole Flash issues. My iPad I can visit news websites and watch the video, but you can't on a android tablet without a big hassle. iPads do not support Flash, but I can still watch the video???? But that is just an Android gripe. I did install Flash and it seems to work ok....Overall this is a good tablet so far, for the light user and with careful installation you can move some data to a memory card and make this thing more usable. But if you love your apps and need space get a different tablet.", "Title": "Cool little tablet", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Author": "Ann Whitaker", "ReviewID": "R2YBG0FAWPK40C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it, it is easy to hold, fast, clear screen holds almost all the apps that my Samsung phone holds and they can be sync together.", "Title": "Small, fast affortable", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Author": "Traci", "ReviewID": "R293U20R2WYPKF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have an iPad, but was curious about the Samsung tablet.

Roth", "ReviewID": "R3LI0X1O4NUTFD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched tablets extensively online before purchasing this one.  There was a certain budget and size I wanted to stay in, and when all was said and done this fit the bill.  I was taken aback at some of the reviews I read about it being slow or dying all of a sudden.  Of course I don't have a crystal ball, but as to the latter I'd say if you purchase a tablet with a lithium battery and certain sensibilities, it's good to take the time to read and heed the instruction manual and treat it accordingly, especially regarding charging. If I'm not mistaken (and I don't think I am), it comes with a one-year manufacturer's warranty. All this aside, compared to other tablets in the same class, Samsung's build quality and reliability seem unparalleled.  If it just up and dies on someone, I'd say it' s a manufacturing anomaly and not the norm.  People misuse and mishandle these tablets and then complain that it's junk, but I do believe there's more to those stories than meets the eye.Anyway, the funny thing is that I used my husband's Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 to do my research.  This was over a period of a couple of weeks, and as I went along searching and researching I came to like and trust the little gizmo.  He's had it for over a year now.  No problems!  It runs like a medium-grade laptop.  Sometimes it will take a second or two to go from one web page to another, or sometimes (I think because it's so small) you have to tap a couple of times to hit a link just right, but please.  Come on.  That's not slow.  That's not horrible.  That's fine.  It's good quality.  It's a Toyota.  It's not a Porsche.The display is beautiful.  The sound is remarkably nice, nice enough to listen to without a bluetooth speaker while you're puttering.  Both ways, depending on your preference at the moment, it works great.The Dolphin Browser, I find, is awesome to use on it if you dislike certain mobile apps as do I.  You can add your favorite websites to your speed dial and just go there.As for it running slowly, again, treat it as you would a $400-$500 laptop.  Clear the cache and make sure you don't have a jillion apps running all at once.  The Active Applications widget  and Clean Master app are awesome for doing this very easily and quickly.I've only used the camera a couple of times, but for casual picture taking I'd say it's quite good!  If you want something fancy, buy a camera.  Duh.In summary, if you're looking for a portable, reliable (and, I must say, very attractive and well-built) tablet you can carry around with you to watch movies and TV shows, check email, play light games, listen to music, visit your favorite websites, read, chat, Skype, etc., etc., you really can't go wrong with this baby!  It's not an iPad, and it won't open your garage door or wash your dishes, but it is a remarkably versatile device, and I'd say it's priced well.  Amazon's dropped the price lately, so keep an eye on that.  It's comparable to the price of the Lite version (which also looks excellent), but why get lite when you can get full fat?I could not be happier with my purchase.  If that changes, I'll let you know, but I don't think it will.", "Title": "If I could give it 5 and a half stars, I would!", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "R9674T1HN01JV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "and you cant return it and now will cost to try to get fixed, if it can be fixed.

I have the Samsung Galaxy SII cell phone and it's great.On 3/14/2014, I bought two SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab3 for my two children.On 5/9/2014: One of them got completely discharged then it stopped getting charged when I connected it to its charger. I tried different chargers and cables and still no response. called the support as it was still under warranty and went through the steps with them pressing the button combinations as instructed by the support representative.

But again a battery that goes bad upon complete discharge is unforgivable in a device like this.

The size is perfect--it is lightweight, but feels comfortable and sturdy while holding it.  It has an Android platform, so virtually every app is available for it (except those exclusive to Apple).  I have used it to watch movies, play games, and listen to music--and everything is just amazing.  I will, however, concede to the views of others regarding to the placement of the speaker...sound is great in portrait mode, not so great in landscape...so you might want to use headphones.  I have had no issues with the resolution of the screen, but I am no expert, so I wouldn't know if the display was inferior.It is VERY easy to use right out of the box.  Just set it up and go.

I come from an Apple iPad.  Compared to the iPad's snappy response, this device's response times are almost unbearable.  I suspect it's a combination of the device and the Android operating system.  Ironically, the worse response times are on the Internet using Google's own Chrome.  I impatiently hit a button again and again, while unrealized by me, the first button is still being processed.  Needless to say, this causes problems with screen processing.  Also, typing into the address bar is a stilted process as the screen update appreciably lags behind the keyboard input.  These things were never a problem on my iPad.Having said that, the 7\" device is worth the $200.  I bought it for only a few dedicated reasons; 1) as an e-reader, it's a better bargain than the Kindle Paperwhite as you do get the Android OS and a better bargain than the Kindle Fire as you get a more generic flavor of Android, 2) as a IR blaster for controlling my home theater it has more battery life than my iTouch and a better form factor than my iPad, and 3) as an e-mail reader there are a number of Android replacement e-mail apps, a sorely lacking alternative in iOS.So all in all, it's a good price point device.  I'm just glad I didn't buy the 8\" or 10\" model.  As an aside, I find some system commands in Android to be a lot clumsier than in iOS, but that's probably a function of familiarity.Amazon review updateAffter living with this device for a couple of weeks, my major complaint is that surfing the internet is agonizingly, criminally, unforgiveably slow.  A frustrating and demeaning experience.  If you remember trying to do anything on the internet with a 1200 baud dial up modem, you know what I mean.  Why this should be I don't know.  It might have to do with the lack of memory, although if this were the case powering off and on should make a difference, which it doesn't.

When I got it in the mail the home screen button was broken, but a quick trip to my local Best Buy to swap solved that problem. As I got to using it, though, I was surprised by 4 key points, but first some caveats: I use an iPad and I have a Galaxy S4 phone.1. Heavy. At 7 inches, compared to the iPad 10 inch, it's pretty hefty.2. You can ONLY use Samsung chargers. No third party chargers allowed. This is practically a deal breaker for us and we're thinking about taking it back because of it.3. The layout of everything is markedly different than the S4. Confusing even.4. Like it's bigger and smaller cousins the Galaxy Tab 3 is BLOATED with junk-ware. Software that Samsung and others installed that you cannot uninstall. At this point even if you are tech savvy and know what you're doing you can't uninstall those apps. That's a problem b/c it takes up space and gets in the way.With those points aside let's get another thing straight: As yourself why you're buying this tablet. We chose it because it was the cheapest of the \"Reliable\" Android tablets. Those points may be good for some but for the masses it will probably disappoint.We really should have gone for that extra inch and gotten the 8 inch. Some people may be satisfied with 7 inches but when you're use to an iPad that extra 1 or 3 inches (depending on model) really makes a difference. Not just on ease of us but clarity, eye strain, reading, etc. The overall size makes it good for fitting in a purse, or heck even cargo pants, but bigger is .. well..nice!Moving around the menus can be a little awkward if you're use to other Android devices. Items such as security and applications features are not where you expect them to be. This is probably due to only having Android 4.1 Jelly Bean (API level 16). The Galaxy S4 comes with 4.2.2. So perhaps with a little update at some point things will get better. The cameras are pretty bad. It's baffling why the S4 has a 13 MP camera, and the Galaxy Tab 3 only has a Front 1.3MP, Rear 3MP. Pretty much useless for photo taking - which is odd because it's small enough to use just fine.All in all though, if you're getting something for business that you need to be a cheap Android tablet, without much bells and whistles, this is a good product choice. You're going to really hurt in buying those proprietary chargers, in the steep learning curve and lugging it around, but it's cheap. You've got all the standard apps out of the box: Calendar, music, photo management, weather, document creation, etc. If you're committed to Android but see yourself as a power/business user, go for the 10 incher. If you're not tech savvy, if you like bigger screens, ease of use, flexibility with third party chargers, and in particular if weight is important, you should probably choose the iPad.", "Title": "Proprietary Charger and a little heavy", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "K. smith", "ReviewID": "R19WLYJ70ODIWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the ipad was great just not my style, i love the freedom of android and this tablet gives it to me, on 4g Lte ATT it's fast no doubt. smaller than ipad and easier to carry and used everyday~ lightweight and fantastic Samsung menu and quality, books are downloaded within seconds from kindle app. bit of the normal bloatware on it but i either uninstalled or stopped from loading if i don't use it. thanks again Amazon and Samsung!!", "Title": "so glad to went back to android", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Author": "Traci Bohl", "ReviewID": "R1W255XXYCCGLI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product and investment.

All the reviews i read on amazon were pretty close to the same, \"its better than tab 2 and great for the price!\" I'll start with what i liked about the Tab 3. Since it's a Samsung product, and i already had a Samsung Galaxy S Blaze phone, once I signed in using my Samsung account, all the apps i have on my phone started downloading automatically. Also, all of my wifi hotspots and passwords were transferred so i didn't have to remember and recall of my family's home network passwords. and since this is also a Google product, a simple sign in also allowed me access to all my Google accounts like youtube, gmail, and all the Google services that i participate in. The product is a nice size and fits in my hands well. It feels well put together, not cheap but not as sturdy as i was hoping either. the screen is bright and crisp and the touch responds well most of the time. it uses a micro usb cable to charge and connect to the computer. i already have 2 Samsung phones and an amazon kindle hd, so i didn't have to purchase any extra cables and can charge it where ever i have strategically placed a charging station around my home. I also love the microSD port that can expand the memory up to 64 Gigabits. Now i'll move on to some of the problems. i have had issues where the back button, common on android devices, just stopped working and i had to wait for it to become responsive again (restarting did not fix the issue). i also had an instance where i was surfing the web and then suddenly the wifi connection just stopped. It recognized the home network was there, it just wouldn't connect to it. I know it was working because i picked up my phone and started browsing using it with no issues. A restart fixed the issue but it still bothered me. Also when browsing it felt slow to me so again i picked up my phone and did a little test. i went to the same website on both my Galaxy Blaze and the Galaxy Tab 3. Every time, the phone loaded up the page quicker, even on refreshes. Which brings me to the most disappointing reason and the main reason i am returning it(other than the defects like the back button and wifi shutting off), my apps. Since all my apps starting downloading once i signed into my samsung and google account, i was pretty stoked that i wouldn't have to go find them individually and i wouldn't have to always use my phone for games, reading, or time killing apps. One of my favorite games is Simpsons: Tapped Out. Once everything was done downloading i fired up Tapped Out first. It worked fine for around 3 minutes, then it crashed back to the home screen. I tried to relaunch it, once i clicked to start playing, it crashed to the home screen again. i restarted the tablet and attempted to relaunch again. This time the game got hung on the loading screen and the back of the tablet next to the camera lens starting getting very hot (obviously this is where the processor is). i forced a restart and began to check if anyone else was having issues. This is a common issue with the game on the Tab 3 with many people not able to play. i couldn't understand why my 3 year phone can play game, that my 1 year old tablet couldn't. so i started to dig a little deeper. i found that many people are having game and app issues with the Galaxy Tab 3 and apparently this has to do with the resolution of the screen. The tab 3 has a resolution of 1024 X 600, while most newer apps require 1024X800 ( which is what most other tablets at least have if not higher). I have had issues with other apps that work fine on my phone but not on the tablet such as Lego: My City and the Chive app. i talked to someone from Samsung and they said the apps may not be completely compatible with my device. Again, i couldn't understand why my phone can play them flawlessly and this tablet cannot. Not all of the apps were glitchy or unusable, the Kindle app and Comixology worked very well and, even though slow, the web browsing worked okay. i also have Angry Birds and Bad Piggies loaded and those both worked as well. Maybe all these issues get fixed with a new android OS update(it's currently 4.1 Jellybean), maybe this is an isolated incident, but I'm not going to try again with this tablet and will recommend it only to those looking strictly for a reading device with occasional web browsing", "Title": "a letdown", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Author": "Krystle Vian", "ReviewID": "R28SQ2XRW0ZLD5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my tablet.

Plus if you set up drop box or any cloud system they can be sent directly there, so you do not need the SD.  As a result, I am very conservative in the the number and types of apps I download.  I ask my self do I really need it. For example, I downloaded the Washington post app.It takes up a lot of memory, so I thought I was going to move it to the micro SD , but as I mentioned above you cannot move apps to the SD card.Had I really known and understood this was not an option, I might have picked another device.

I go to town on this thing.i can read pdf excel powerpoint presentations you have a world of apps.i dont know where this thing can go wrong. Im very careful about what I download if I dont use it its deleted.i havent saved much just still seeing how much it can manage.i did say before I started saving pictures & books I would get a micro sd card. the storage is expandable to I believe 64 gb.i can say so far the camera quality is a little ify.it may be one of those where you need bright light and a close up. Will test that more. Using the internet is just as good as the portability. and just when you think it may stall (not that its slow at all just low expectations) you see the blue processing line going across the top of the screen like lightning. So far im very much enjoying the tablet.along with this purchase I bought the tech armor anti glare & anti fingerprint screen protector (love it). I recall the reviews being ify but it was a snap for me its a 3 pk comes with a smoother & wiping cloth. I also purchased a silicone skin cover to protect from scratches. I think i will get a case. Its another level of protection it was a life saver for my last tablet. I liked to open in close like a book. One thing I wanted to mention if your looking at your screen and it looks too dark dont worry it auto adjust to your lighting. If the room has low lighting the screen will automatically dim. turn the lighting brighter then the screen gets brighter.  Oh another thing that drove me nuts was wanting to organize or remove apps or delete one of the 3 home screens. To move the apps around hold drag and drop. if you want on another screen hold and drag to either side you'll see a blue line as if turning the page. It'll go to the next screen.

S. Raven", "ReviewID": "R2WUAZ0SA1P3FU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for one purpose - to use a word processor on it so that I could see the text better than on my cell phone screen. I don't need to watch movies or download a lot of content or anything like that, so for me it works just fine. Also, I already own a Samsung phone and had a Google Play account, so it was nice that when it turned on, all my content downloaded and I have everything that I have on my cell phone on here as well in the same Samsung set up that I'm used to.However, it must be said that this device, while nice and all and the size works for me, is not the zippy, high def tablet that you get for doing multiple tasks and downloading loads of things from the internet. It is quite slow loading internet pages, it often stalls if there is more than one program running, some of the widgets took forever to show up on a screen where I put it because I was downloading other apps at the same time. A few of the games I play from time to time, blink a bit with lag time, but I haven't done any heavy gaming. I assume that would be a horrible experience. It also has a tiny memory, so be ready to buy that SD card (nice feature, but these days who wants to spend extra money on an SD card, or have to have an SD card?).Generally speaking, it works fine, it's just not very robust, the screen isn't amazing, the camera isn't spectacular, and the speed is not impressive. But for what I'm doing with it, I like it. The size is great to carry around in a purse, it fits in one hand, typing on the screen is fine (though I've gotten a bluetooth keyboard). If I wasn't using it for just the general text document processing that I am, I would imagine this would only be good for very light tablet use, maybe for young kids that don't play big, high def games, probably great for taking notes in class. Other than those select areas, I imagine this is not what people would want for all the apps and dazzling stuff you get online these days.

The Tablet has a USB port for connecting to your computer.  The Expandable SD Card Memory is a huge plus.Cons: The WI-FI connectivity is far below par.

I plugged it in to charge when I got it and didn't get to use it much the first day, only a couple hours of straight use and everything seemed fine. The next day I noticed the WiFi problem some other reviewers mention which weren't on here until after mine was shipped. Almost every time I turned it on or woke it up I had to go in and manually turn the WiFi off then turn it back on for it to connect if I wanted to get online right away. The other times I let it go (if I wasn't getting online right away) it took at least a minute or longer for it to connect, this is with a signal it was saying was very strong. It seems to constantly \"scan\" for WiFi signals, even when it's already connected to one. Even though this was annoying, I was willing to put up with it and hope they could fix it with an update.I downloaded a couple apps and they all seemed to work fine (Netflix and Viggle). Although a couple games I tried (Robot Unicorn Attack 2) ran slow at times and (Major Mayhem) paused once and told me the frame rate was too slow and wanted me to turn down it's graphic settings. Although if you turned off the power saver setting, both of them ran a lot better. A few other games I tried (Candy Crush Saga, Tetris Blitz, Jetpack Joyride) played fine.Google Chrome ran at probably half the speed as the built-in browser. On Chrome a site would take 20-30 seconds to load, the same site loaded in less then 10 seconds on the built-in browser. Though the built-in browser isn't without it's annoyances. One I hated the most, there seemed to not be a password manager in it. If you told it to remember your passwords and you wanted to remove one later, I only saw an option to clear all passwords.Some people may not like it, but I liked the sound every time you \"clicked\" something with the built-in browser, it let me know I actually hit the link. Chrome on the other hand did not have the sounds leaving me wondering if I missed the link or if it was just loading slow like usual. Also, multiple times while online, I would click a link on a site, the site would be loading the next page (on the same site) and give me an error saying something like, that action can not be preformed and finish loading the page... what action it was? I have no idea. It does not support flash and It also froze up once loading a site and I had to hold the power button to get out of it.A couple other annoyances, the setting to automatically control screen brightness constantly made it entirely too dark, I eventually turned it off since it's on by default. Also, In my experience, the camera was too dark. I had to turn the brightness clear up when I tried it. Unless the object had direct light on it, I could not see it.On the 3rd day I started getting the error \"the process com.google.process.gapps has stopped.\" It only seemed to pop up when I opened a browser. There seems to be fixes for this although I didn't look for one at the time because I started getting another error.That other error \"Package File Invalid\" started, which it seems that now Google is looking for a fix for it. The game Jetpack Joyride had an update and I got this error. I thought maybe something was wrong and tried updating it later just to get the error again. I uninstalled the game and tried to install it again, couldn't do it at all. Not knowing if it was just the game or not, I tried downloading another app to see, still get \"Package File Invalid.\" I looked around online for help, found nothing at all on Google Support nor Samsung, although Google may have something now since they are looking for a fix. I found a few Android forums/sites with \"fixes\" none of which worked for me. Cleared cache and data, uninstalled Google Play updates etc. nothing worked.Thinking I maybe did something or an app I downloaded screwed something up, I decided to completely factory reset the thing. I start setting everything up, enter my WiFi, enter my Samsung account, start entering my Google account when I click next it sends me back to the start... OK I set everything back up (WiFi, Google account etc.) when I finish and it loads the OS, I had 14 update errors where it tried updating all the pre-installed apps and couldn't because \"Package File Invalid.\" OK so maybe I did something wrong or when it sent me back to the start something messed it up, factory reset again, this time everything works fine, the OS loads and starts updating. A couple updates go fine, then once again \"Package File Invalid.\" I entered the Play store tried downloading an app \"Package File Invalid\" tried another app \"Package File Invalid.\" Factory reset again to remove all of my information and contact Amazon to return it, thankfully they let me.This being my first Android device, it didn't make a good first impression.", "Title": "Returned after 5 days.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Author": "Milo", "ReviewID": "R75TDUK1BJZQT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Planning to return it.The two main disadvantage so far are:1.

In fact, my husband purchased the Tab 2 for me instead of this one because the Tab 2 had better reviews (I returned the Tab 2 after less than 15 days for a Note 8, but that is not the point of this review so I will not go into it further for this review). This tablet has been a very pleasant surprise!My husband has not had any problems with this tablet, it is peppy/fast and seems to offer everything that he needs. We added a 32gb card to it so it now has 40gb of memory ($17 investment). He had been using our old iPad (2nd gen) and he is not a tech geek like me, but he seems to really like this device and the size of this device (he has not picked up the iPad since he got this). I tried to set it all up for him before giving it to him and found later that he was enjoying customizing the device himself, which made me happy!We own a lot of tablets and this one fits in with the others quite well. In my opinion it is a much better value than the iPad or iPad mini largely because the operating systems are so similar at this point, the apps are similar and you can add memory to this device, which is something you cannot do on any iPad. Oh and I have found a number of android apps that allow you to sync to itunes for your music and movies and then other apps that allow you to sync to your icloud calendar, contact and to do list.In terms of this versus the other less expensive android tablets that we own the main differences would be how the company (Samsung in this case) sets up the android environment and the fact that this device has a button instead of all touch screen buttons. Overall this is a nice tablet for the price point. If I could change one thing I would have it be 16 gb instead of 8. The 8gb is fine for my husband who does not have a ton of large apps that run better on the device vs the card, but my kids have a lot of kid friendly, high graphic, large memory apps that run better on the device vs the memory card. I think this device would not have been a great choice for my kids.Please note - Android devices generally, with the exception of the Kindle (which does not have a memory slot), cannot play Amazon video. I believe this is Amazon's choice and not the choice of the manufacturers.Here are the similar devices that we own:1. Samsung Galaxy Note 82. Lenovo A30003. Dell Venue 7 16gb4. iPad 2If you have any questions about the different devices I am happy to answer any questions you might have.", "Title": "Good win!", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Author": "S.

A common problem with the product based on my research.  You can go to wireless headphones...but me personally...I like hard wire so...I guess more EMF for my brain.?Positives:  No lag in key strokes, price is good... I like Samsung personally, graphics are clean, have'nt experienced pixilated screen with streaming video, size is perfect, SD card slot, more freedom than Apple products.  Again, you get your money's worth with Samsung.Negatives:  I believe a common manufacturing error has occurred with the headphone jack, as it started right out of the box and progressed to clicking alternating with working fine to now no audio at all from headphone jack.  Camera is not up to par with most Samsung cell phones from the same generation.I  will stay with the Samsung tablet due to freedom of controlling data etc...hopefully the next gen tab has a better camera megapixel like the S4...AND the headphone jack manufacture improves.", "Title": "would have gave 5 stars...problem here..", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Author": "1MRZA", "ReviewID": "RW0QEA8UW51MJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband truly loves his tablet.

I originally ordered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and when it was delivered, the packaged was open and the seal on android box was broken.

I was very pleased in how easy the return process was as this was my first time sending a device back. I love the Galaxy tab 3 and it goes well with my Samsung Galaxy S 3 Phone. The Tablet has a beautiful bright 7 inch screen making the handheld experience comfortable. It can fit nicely in my purse. It is easy and simple to set up and use. I ordered the 16 gig because that is all I need for books, music and pictures storage. I love the camera that is front faced too. It is WiFi capable and I am not obligated to sign up with any carrier. I have a kindle but brought this tablet for more extended fun use where I am able to access documents on cloud apps for handling business or school. The camera feature is nice since a IPad was out of the question for me no matter what deal was available. I love Samsung products in their lap top, camera, phone and now I have the tablet. The white color with silver trim is very nice than the normal black color devices out there. I am a satisfied customer. I buy from Amazon on a regular.

I often let my units go to zero because I forget to charge them or don't want to OVERCHARGE them and burn out the battery.  This is very inconvenient to have to watch the charge; what if I am out of town or something?Also, I purchased this device for watching videos or reading in bed before I sleep.  The wi-fi is so sluggish that I end up using my IPAD MINI for that use, instead of the Samsung Tablet.I am so upset that Samsung messed up the tablet.---------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINGAL REVIEW: I purchased the original Samsung Galaxy tab 3 years ago; it worked great. I dropped it getting out of the car last year and this year it finally just conked out - it starting blinking in and out after the drop.I decided to purchase THIS MODEL - T210R. The touch screen is either overly senstive or not senstive enough. You may touch a link and it may or may not open. THIS MODEL seems to have some internal issues. As a result of being annoyed with this model, I finally succumbed and purchased the IPAD Mini.The mini, I have discovered 100's of dollars later, is just a dumbed down version of the original Samsung Galaxy tablet. If I had known that, I would have just purchased another Galaxy Tab (original model) off ebay.Battery: Great; the battery life on the original Galaxy Tab is horrible; just existing caused the battery to drain. This model can lay around for days without needing to be chargedSize/weight: great size. It is flimsy though; the home button fell outValue for the money: Great cheap tablet if it is not your primary tablet; I would not recommend using this model as my primary tablet.Screen resolution: the pictures look pretty for the wallpaper and internet, but the photos don't look as pretty as the original galaxy tab; the lag, however, is gone thoughI use THIS MODEL for using wi-fi around the house.  For my serious tablet needs out and about, I use my IPAD Mini.Edited to add: I am ANTI-APPLE and it caused me great pains to finally get an Apple product.  I am disappointed that Samsung, making such an excellent first generation tablet, has dropped the ball on the current generation tablets.Would I recommend THIS Version? NOOOOOO, if you want a Samsung product go buy the first generation tablet or buy one of their phones.  If you want a tablet, go to the store and try out the various tablets, but don't get this one unless you just don't care.  This is my DON\"T CARE about tablet.", "Title": "I do not recommend this tablet as your primary tablet!", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Author": "Amanda Royse", "ReviewID": "R1TBX10QTS3D5R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this on March 12, 2014 received it a few days later.

Really, I did. I'm a Samsung fan. I own two Samsung phones, a Galaxy Blaze and a Galaxy S III, and I'm very happy with them. The Tab 3 looks like a larger version of the S3 on steroids. Unfortunately, it doesn't perform that way. It's slow doing simple things. For example, there is a noticeable lag when scrolling through web pages. And I don't mean loading pages, I mean scrolling AFTER the page is fully loaded! Move your finger, and for half-a-beat nothing happens, then the page moves. Very irritating, especially since my 18-month-old Blaze scrolls so much faster. This general slowness affects all of the Tab's operations to some degree (for example, when turning pages in a book or reading a pdf file). Even the menu for Settings, while faster than browser scrolling, still lags just a bit. C'mon, Settings is the most basic operation on the device!This slowness occurs even with no background apps running, or in memory.The shape and size of the device is quite pleasing, but the back is smooth shiny plastic with no texture, so it makes the Tab feel like a heavy toy. And the shiny finish magnifies fingerprints and smudges.Aside from slowness, everything works as advertised. But I get a sense that Samsung didn't try very hard when they were designing this device. It lacks vision. It's not revolutionary or evolutionary. The Tab 3 is a familiar form factor housing tech suited to 2011 or 2012 (dual core, 1200 MHz, ARM Cortex-A9 and 1024 x 600 pixels), but seriously out of date in 2013-2014. Ya, it's cheaper than some other tablets. And for this reason it might be a good gift for a child, or a tablet for someone on a very tight budget. But overall, I can't recommend.I kept the Tab for two days and then returned it. Got a Nexus 7 (2013 version), and it performs perfectly.Note that this review is for the WiFi-only version.

I find this unimpressive for a NEW NEW tablet to have so many slow downs.  There's a smoothness factor to the newer apple products that this simply lacks.

Tablets, i-devices, laptops, servers, gaming systems - we love all of it and with varying degrees of proficiency.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it's my favorite of all of the smartphones I've owned.  I've had a Kindle Fire & Nexus 7 in the \"real\" tablets, along with an array of off-brand tablets for my kids.  So, when my Nexus 7 tablet screen spontaneously cracked on Thanksgiving Day, I was immediately looking for a replacement (after the swelling in my eyes went down from crying about my beloved tablet).  I originally thought I'd get another Nexus because I've been really pleased with it.  But then I remembered it's 20 days until Christmas and I have 6 children to buy gifts for and looked for something that had good reviews, was a brand that I recognized and was in my price range.  Since I have a Samsung phone, I thought I'd love the tablet.I paid extra for Saturday delivery, anxious to get back to reading my books, playing my games and all the other things a person who has a lot of down time due to illness does.  Sadly, the delivery guys didn't bring it for 3 days after it was due to arrive!  So, they missed their delivery date and I was bummed.  When it finally arrived, I was so excited to get my newest little electronic baby settled in with all of her apps, tweaks, connected to my world, etc.  I realized immediately that while this is called a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, it's nothing like the Samsung Galaxy S3 phone I have.  It's missing a lot of menu options, the cameras are very scaled down, the tablet is very difficult to hold because it's so slippery and light.  It's beautiful to look at but I felt like I needed something to grip on.  And finding a case for it is kind of a challenge as well.I knew almost immediately that this tablet wasn't for me.  It didn't feel right in my hands (which are small, even for a woman), the screen seemed so much smaller than my Nexus 7, though they were the same size.  The pictures were a bit fuzzy or hazy.  Loading pages took a lot longer than it should have with a brand new tablet, videos wouldn't play at all sometimes.  I couldn't figure it out because I hadn't changed anything, it was just that everything runs Soooooo Sloowww.  Page turns=slow, loading pages=slow  What a bummer.The screen had issues on it's own.  It seemed a bit off when I'd try to selected something to move it around, it wouldn't want to pick up the icon and move it..  Chrome loaded like I was on dial-upPros:Cute looking little tablet.  If you just want something for email, watch a movie, play a tame, it'll probably be oK.  But if you do anything else, you might be disappointed in this one, unless this is your step up into the big leagues of tablets, you'll most like enjoy this one just fine.It does connect through the Play store for lots of games and other apps..The negatives are:-Slow processor means slow everything.  I honestly got faster response time on the off-brand $40 tablets I've gotten for my youngest at ages 10 and 12-Very, very dainty and slick.  It weighs nothing and is very thin, it was really hard to find a way to hold it comfortably without feeling like it was going to slip'-Some apps and wepages took a long time to load.  That doesn't feel like a new tablet should feel, it's new!!  It should be like lighting!-The volume buttons are really hard to find, you have to keep feeling around to see where they are .  There's a lot more, but I have to sleep, we're expecting a huge snowstorm tomorrow and that could mean SNOW DAY!Bottom line:  If you have a Samsung Galaxy phone and think this is pretty much the same quality you are used to, you're going to be disappointed with this tablet.-", "Title": "Maybe for a beginner", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Author": "Oswald Barreto", "ReviewID": "R707ENYGJGGUC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent sale, the products arrived the destination undamaged and smoothly.

One was the 7\" model (for my Granddaughter) and an 8\" (for myself).  Had no problems setting up /connecting either tablet.  My Granddaughter is eight years old and had no problems with any of the controls and is extremely delighted with the size of the screen compared to her iPod Touch. She has downloaded many games and other Aps from Google Play and everything works as advertised.  With that said, there are a couple of features that are present on the 8\" model that I feel should have been included with the 7\".  The first is the ability to transfer some Aps to the SD card.  Some (not all) Aps are developed with this capability and I think that Samsung should have allowed this on the 7\" as it did on the 8\".  The internal memory of the 7\" is half that of the 8\".  The other feature that is available on the 8\" and not the 7\" has been mentioned in several of the other reviews.  It is the ability to control the \"Touch Key Light Duration\".  I think a lot of owners would like the ability to have the lights on for a longer period or all the time.Note: In an attempt to get more information regarding the transfer of Aps to the SD card, I contacted Samsung through their \"Chat\" service.  After listening to my question, and doing some research, the Service Rep informed me that the 7\" Tab 3 had the capability that I was questioning him about.  I told him that there were two identical Aps on each tablet.  I could transfer them on my 8\" but not on the 7\" in spite of both tablets having the same OS.  At that point the Rep said I should contact the developer of the Aps.  Needless to say, that ended \"Chat\".  A week later I decided to call Samsung.  Surprise!  I got to speak to a real life Human!  After a brief conversation and a not so brief \"hold while I research\", I was told \"we don't know the answer but we will forward your question to the Tech Department\".  I was given a transaction number that I'm sure is resting on the bottom of somebody's circular file.  Hopefully, in the future, they will  ad this feature to the 7\" Tablets if it can be done with an update.", "Title": "Great tablet, missing a couple of features.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3EJ2VXV73LN6V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATE - INVALID PACKAGE FILE when updating apps or installing new ones work-around:Naviage to  [...] in your browswer and follow instructions about  Setting up VPN option.

The Tab 3 was my first Android device since I moved from the iPhone.The first thing I didn't like was moving back to a lower-resolution screen after having become accustomed to the Retina displays of Apple products. Next, and this is my biggest gripe, I found the user interface to be clunky and ugly. For example, the idea of program widgets is clever, but they do not blend in well with the overall look of the OS. There seems to be no standard design, it looks mashed together. iOS was much more polished and visually appealing.The way the programs were put into different screens was also annoying. In iOS you have up to X main screen where all the programs are listed. On this device there was a separate screen where all your downloaded programs would be listed, then you would have your \"home\" screens. You had to either make a shortcut from the all-programs screen to one of your home screen or just browse the all-programs screen. Breaking programs up this was seemed completely unnecessary.Having been on iOS now for several years, I refuse to repurchase apps on Android that I already bought on Apple's App Store.", "Title": "Returned after 2 weeks.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Author": "Ascaris", "ReviewID": "R20QCQJL4R94Q5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would have been greatly in love with this tablet had it not been for the capacitative buttons not lighting up.I have the white version.Normally I wouldnt mind little details and I usually love Samsung products. BUT someone dropped the ball big time on this.The tablet is great, its a lot faster and smoother than my Tab 2 7.0 which I love by the way.. Both are small, compact and light weight. Perfect size for me since Im on the move a lot.The new Tab 3 7.0 is even smaller even tho it still maintains the same screen size at7\". And also the memory is upgradable via micro SD.But the most annoying issue I have is that the capacitative buttons dont light up, meaning that if you are in a room with low light, it is near impossible to see where the back button and the menu button are.I thought I would love those button not being on the screen itself but it really gets old when while watching a video or even surfing the web or playing in an app and accidentally hitting one of those button since they are not discernable from the frame.In a well lit up room or outside in a sunny day it isnt such an issue since the buttons are grayish outlined. But in a car or a plane where light can be low the whole thing turn gray and cannot see where the buttons are.Now people might think Im just being too overly negative about this issue but for what I bought this upgrade it just isnt working. I hate it, I HATE IT! Always accidentaly touching these invisible buttons. I would have much rather love for them to just leave them inside the screen.And I cannot even let my 2 year old play with it since she cannot tell the buttons arent there. On the tab2 she can see the those button and the home button since they are on screen and she knows what they do. On this one, she keeps getting kicked out of her apps and she thinks something is wrong with the tablet. She like the tab2 better obviously.And the worst part is that I tried looking up if this was due to a deffective product or the tablet is just made that way and even the rep couldnt give me a straight answer telling me that this tablet is made just like the Note and that the buttons light up but not bright, that it depends on the brightness of the screen. wait WHAT? That doesn't even make sense.Also looked up in the options to see if there was an option to turn those on but nothing.If I had the option, I'd just wait for the Nexus or something else, but if this issue does not bother you, Id definitely recommend it to you. As for me, I will explore my options.Update after 3 days with the Unit:2nd day of use and The unit seems to have issues with Wifi connection. Cannot connect to the Play store, but the web browser works just fine. As of yesterday it will not even connect to the Wifi while my tab 2 gets connection. I will try to do a factory reset and see where it takes me. Also it seems to have a issue when hooked up via Aux cable and there is a loud noise (for exemple an explosion or a shout especially while watching an action movie) the sound messes up and I have to unplug the Aux cable and plug it again. Yeah those are definitly too many issues with my unit.I understand that my review score might be a little too harsh to some, but Again, for what I bought this unit for, it is not serving its purpose so it is useless to me so far.Update After day 5:Yeah my unit is pure garbage at this point. Now it won't even connect to my laptop. It keeps restring or shutting off and just showing the charging battery. I'm done with this, returning the unit and giving it another shot but I'm not hoping for much here.I'm still not happy about the Capacitative buttons, but not much can be done here. The rest I'm sure is either I have a defective unit or its just a software issue that hopefully Samsung can fix with updates.I'm hoping I'm the only one with these issues as the Samsung rep told me he's never heard of the unit underperforming like that.All in all, There is much to like about this tablet, but right now with my experience now turning sour I would have to give it a 0 star.
