What made me more upset was the fact that I had told Amazon about ALL the issues the first tablet had, and with every replacement tablet they sent me it came in worse condition than before and was barely usable. Now I am stuck with the 3rd \"new\" tablet Amazon sent me and it has the most glitches of all. It NEVER connects to the internet (the main point of me getting it) so I just wasted $120 on a product from Amazon that does not work at all. It is like they purposely sent me tablets with even more glitches...which makes no sense at all because I was EXTREMELY nice in my first emails to them regarding all the annoying issues of the tablet when I shouldn't have been so nice because it was a HUGE pain to send back a deformed tablet so many times. Then later I had to fight with Amazon to get my tablet delivered to me ON TIME (the latest day possible in their very long estimated delivery time) with the shipping cost I CHOOSE AND PAID FOR because it was a birthday gift I needed to have by a certain time..and honestly NO costumer should have to fight with a vendor that they already gave their business and money too, especially when the product arrives in horrible condition and the customer has to wait longer for the replacement. They were trying to get me to PAY MORE to get it delivered to me when they said it would be originally delivered, like the tablet being deformed was MY FAULT (this was the last straw for me). Now the stupid tablet sits in my room unused and after this horrible experience with a product directly from Amazon I will NEVER trust the \"Amazon fulfillment guarantee\" ever again!!! I have never been so negatively shocked by service and product condition from Amazon so let this be a warning to those who were like me and thought Amazon products are more reliable because they aren't at all!!! My advice: DO NOT BUY DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON, EVER (at least not with expensive stuff they can screw you over with like they did with me).", "Title": "Prestige 7 Internet tablet I received from AMAZON", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "Hassan", "ReviewID": "R3MLD5IKUVKNS6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this product during black Friday for 80$. Which is cheap. However, it does not work good.
