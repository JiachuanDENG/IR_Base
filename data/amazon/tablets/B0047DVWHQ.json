I plan to use wifi only and add 3G at times I think I might need it.The iPad2 comes with some fantastic apps. and many, many others are available at the App Store. Lots are free!!!In my case the advertisements about using the iPad2 \"right out of the box without the need for a computer,\" were wrong as I had to set mine up using iTunes on my computer!The browser is fast and no waiting for pages to load. . . with a full signal that is.  The weaker the signal on wi-fi, the slower the load but I guess that's to be expected. Dropping even one bar makes a huge difference. Also it's not compatable with Flash which is why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars.I love the portability, the design and mostly everything about my iPad2. But it IS costly so if you need the functionality of a laptop, this will not be a replacement. But if you just surf the web, check your e-mail and play games you'll love it!", "Title": "Love my iPad2", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Author": "ben m.", "ReviewID": "RPU6KR9C3TUZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The iPad 2 is :Thin.

Nonetheless, ever since I got the iPad, I have been using it for a range of tasks, focusing mainly on reading magazines and books. I travel often, and the iPad allows have everything I might want to read on a trip in one, which also happens to be lighter and more compact than most books out there. The only drawback is that typing on this machine is slow since you have to keep an eye on the keyboard at all times, but this holds true for all other tablets, and its easily fixed by purchasing an external keyboard if typing is essential to you. A must have accessory for this item is some sort of protective case. I have two, apple's sponsored screen protector (which conveniently locks the ipad when shut), and a sleeve for traveling, so that I can easily put it in my backpack when traveling.", "Title": "Incredible", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Author": "John Brown \"Book Sage\"", "ReviewID": "R1BI6NC4SYFM9Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Apple ipad 2 64 GB Wifi, Black was a good buy.

Comparing to other tablets the ipad 2 is far more efficient and worth every penny. You have a front facing webcam to chat with all your facetime buddies and if you have an application you can even chat with android users as well! The touch screen is both elegant and accurate to the exact point of your finger. Also with the new A5 dual-core 1Gz processor this will surpass any applications. However im telling you all the pros about the product and I'm not one of those all out apple fan boys I believe every device out there has a purpose but some are more worthwhile for your money.Cons: Despite all the good looks and great hardware and software the device is fragile and you must buy a case for it or its prone to scratches unlike most android device they have a much more durable glass one known as gorilla glass. Also the camera isnt even barely a megapixel the quality of the images are horrible and you have a vga front facing camera.Overall: this is a great buy because the amount of application offered from apple's App Store benefits you more than Androids app store. I have to admit apple's app store has a higher quality of apps and a lot better utilities and such. I use this alot for school so its the perfect tablet to use a researching tool and typing up notes and organizing my work.", "Title": "Most innovative Tablet out there", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Author": "OregonBay \"\u00a9 OregonBay - 1999 to 2014\"", "ReviewID": "R36X5T8MJW00M3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, my wife got the black 16GB several months ago and I inherited a Nook Color which I though would be good enough to use for surfing the web, email, editing and publishing documents, etc...  and after several months of frustration, and seeing how well that iPad 2 worked, I decided to get myself one.*WOW*I'm not trying to bash the Nook Color, it is nice for reading magazines and books, not as pleasing on the eyes as the larger iPad 2 screen, but it works.  It's probably more of the limitations of the Android OS that is so frustrating to me, and the lack of real world applications for it.  Yes it has an abundance of applications, but no real apps to do work it seems.iPad 2 has apps like Pages and Numbers that integrate seamlessly with their counterparts on the computer.  On the other hand Android devices have something called Quickoffice PRO which is supposed to allow you to edit and transfer Office documents between the device and the desktop...  sounds good, but after paying $14.00 for the app I cannot use ANY document with ANY type of formatting on the Android, and the smaller screen makes it hardly usable.  In contrast the only issues I have with Pages is if there is a font that is not available on the iPad, but is on the desktop computer, and I can always find another one that will fit the bill.The iPad 2 is way ahead of Androids in terms of touchscreen recognition.  The Android was constantly doing things that I didn't want it to do.  For instance I would be attempting to scroll the screen and often times it would instead select an item or link from the screen.  That was uber-frustrating at best.  Trying to do anything on it was a labor of love I guess.  I oft times just got frustrated and moved to a computer to get something done.  The iPad by contrast seems to know exactly whatI am trying to do...  rarely do I have a touchscreen error.The iPad 2 is sleek, elegant, and has a large enough screen to actually get some work done.  Surfing the web is a breeze and despite the complaints about the lack of a flash plug-in, I surf with relative ease.  Speaking of flash, yes Androids have that, but it doesn't work very well on them.  I struggled on web sites with flash on my Android.  Often times the page would not display correctly anyway, so that's kind of a wash.  And Microsoft is canning flash in Windows 8 as well.  It looks like Steve was right... flash is going away.iOS 5 with iCloud is an iDream (pun intended).  I can sync all my contacts, my wife's contacts, calendars, Aperture photos, etc...  without any real user interaction.  Just turn the services on and go.  Makes me re-think that OS X Lion Server purchase I made, but I still need that for the older Macs running Tiger and Leopard on my network, and at some point I will probably turn on that XSAN server to create a local SAN RAID...Numbers files work perfectly and seamlessly between the iPad 2 and the desktop computer, formulas, etc.  That's another problem I had with the Android Quickoffice, it would not understand complex and sometimes simple formulas, so I couldn't use spreadsheets on it at all.Generally the applications for iOS are far more mature and polished than those available for Android.  The user experience is without a doubt far superior on the iPad 2, apps like Hulu Plus were not even available on the Android which sort of left me scratching my head.  I do have an Android phone that has Hulu Plus on it, so I'm not certain why there wasn't one for the tablet, but it rendered what could have been a nice TV show watching device into a useless for TV device.iPad 2 is sleek, sexy, stylish, yes.  But it is also a serious workhorse if you are like me and want to do real world work on it.  With a combination of the iPad, and iWork.com I am able to create documents on the iPad or desktop computer, save them to iWork.com, and download them anywhere in any of three possible formats (Pages, PDF, or Word).  The translation to word documents is nearly as flawless as the other transfers, again, sometimes there is a font issue, but that is rare and is easy to fix.Another problem I had with the Android was the lack of iTunes for it.  Much of my music library is still DRM protected and the Android wouldn't play those files.  iPad 2 by contrast sync's right up and has every one of my songs available to play, and speaking of iCloud -- I have more computers than I need, and having that many leads to problems like the old \"you can only have 5 computers authorized\" when I try to authorize another iTunes library to sync my music.  iCloud eliminates that problem, your new purchases automatically are downloaded from the cloud. And storage is not really an issue with iPad 2 specifically... get the Camera Adapter kit and you can use all the SD cards you want with it.Back to the iPad 2 - if you are looking to buy a tablet type of computer and are on the fence between an iPad and another, shall I say \"knock-off\", dig into the details.Some of the Androids may be better than the Nook Color in terms of power, response, screen size, etc... but none of them have a decent office suite or iTunes, they don't have as many accessories available for them, you'll have to use a variety of different services to get iCloud functionality, you cannot use iWork.com with them, Apps are not as abundant and generally are not as mature/polished, syncing with your desktop is a headache - if you can even get it to, etc...Overall this is one of the best, if not THE best Apple product available.  I have a lot of Apple products these days due to the ease of use, this one is one of the easiest to use and I HIGHLY recommend it!", "Title": "The perfect portable pad", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Author": "Nuknuk", "ReviewID": "RL73NICTHN08S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am late on the iPad bandwagon. Although I have multiple iPods and also an iPhone owner, this is the first time we are getting ourselves an iPad in the household.This is wonderful device. Just like what they did in the IpodTouch, the amazing thing is how they were able to squeezed so much technology in such a small space.By the way, this is a review of the iPad 2.  The first iPad, we skipped it completely.  There are many tablets in the market but it is really tough to compete with iPad. First, the interface.  This is what Apple is known for.  The simplicity, usability and ease of use of such a very compliated hardware is a miracle in itself.  I have tried other devices that are similar but the most of them seems to be  a  tad slower and  less smart.Another big factor that is strongly going for the iPad is the number of apps availalble in the Apple store.  Android is starting to compete, specially now with big online stores like Amazon taking the challenge.  Still, it will take some time to really match the number and the quality of the apps in iTunes. Apple is also known for being strict in approving apps being sold in the App store.Funny thing is, what made me pull the trigger to finally buy an iPad despite the high tag price is the HP Touchpad fiasco.  I ordered one when it was advertised for $99.  I was ecstatic to have my order received and placed through Barnes & Noble,  only to be notified the next day that my order was cancelled.  Due to frustration, I walked in to the closest Apple store and got me one.What really amazed me is the usefullness of the tablet in education. I have heard so many times that it is good for kids who have autism and one of my kids was diagnosed with autism. He is so focused when playing with it.My kids have DSs but most of the games are just for fun and entertainment. They get a little bit of learning at the beginning, but after that it is repetitive and just time waste.There are amazing educational apps like the following:- Word Bingo- Math Bingo- Teach Me- Presidents vs Aliens- Stack the States.- Brainquests series- Write On (for learning cursive writing)NO FLASH:iPad2 still does not support flash.  There are Aps that you can use to play flash on websites  like iShifter, etc.  It is not perfect but at least it works.SKYPE:One of the advantages the iPad2 against iPad1 is that now you can do video calls with Skype or Yahoo Messenger.", "Title": "Great for education", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Author": "Tink", "ReviewID": "R1BWW2OK3V8TP1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been debating whether I wanted a Kindle or an I-pad.

But if you're considering ordering an ipad from armelectronics2011, THINK AGAIN. When I bought my first ipad 2, the listing was for a brand new still in box product. When I received it, the ipad was NOT in its original box (as I anticipated) and after a couple of months, I started to realize that the ipad 2 that I had purchased from armelectronics2011 was complete CRAP. I'm pretty sure that the screen on the ipad I had bought was actually replaced in a very unprofessional way and in time, it showed because the white ipad began to turn yellow. The home button did not work correctly, the glass began to peel away from the actual ipad, and the entire ipad began to act as if it had a virus (which apple products supposedly do not get viruses). When I contacted the seller about their false advertising for their \"brand new product\" it took two days of phone tag to even contact them, and even when I FINALLY talked to them, they basically told me \"oh well, not our fault, you can pay the return shipping and a restocking fee to get your money back\" -which by the way is not at all worth the trouble after all of their unnecessary fees for something that was THEIR FAULT. I in the end kept the ipad 2 from this seller (REGRETFULLY) and eventually bought a new one.Basically, if you want to splurge for an ipad of any sort, go for it because in my opinion it is worth it.

It took forever to save up 600$ but is was worth it! I am able to do so much on it I am able to read, play games, go on the internet etc.One thing that i enjoy is the screen is very clear, I personally don't have any problems reading or seeing anything!  One thing that I enjoy to do in my Ipad is read quotes and sayings. I love how fast i can save them. My computer takes forever to download things like that. All you have to do is push one button and you are done!  One other thing that i love about the Apple Ipad 2 is that you can set up a lock so nobody can get into it (like my little brother). I am the only one that can get into it! I love it.  I think the ipad 2 is truly amazing! You can do so much on it. You can do the same things that you can on a computer, maby more! there is really nothing I dislike about the Ipad 2. Also I don't have any problems doing, seeing, hearing anything!I think the Apple Ipad 2 is amazing for anyone and everyone who loves reading, playing games, and going on the internet.

They help to define who we are by being a source of connection to the world. An iPad is what has been my connection and has transformed my life exceedingly. It also enhanced every aspect of my life in many unique ways. My iPad 2 is reliable, family/school friendly and has also served as a memory book for me.Apple has been in existence for decades, since 1976, and has grown to become our apple and nutrition of the day providing us iPhones, Macs, iPods and iPads. Apple has become a very trustworthy brand. Before I purchased the iPad on Amazon I needed to confirm that it was going to be worth my time, effort and money. I was blown away by the results of the reviews it had obtained throughout the years. Most of the reviews had given it a five star rating. At that point I knew I needed to buy my iPad 2. I anticipated its arrival anxiously because of the great qualities the product had. In the end, it was everything I had imagined it to be.My brothers fell in love with it as much as I did, or possibly even more. I started exploring my iPad, downloading games and taking pictures. I am amazed at how much one little device can calm and contain children. I have four hyper active brothers and sisters and my iPad has worked miracles on them. They all sit down and as one quietly plays on the iPad, the others patiently wait for their turn. Before my siblings would be jumping and running around everywhere, yelling and fighting about everything. After that point my mom always carried my iPad and she is now buying one for herself. My iPad has become very helpful when it comes to school. I can take notes on it. I complete my homework on it.as type up my essays; watch instructive videos, take educational pictures and much more.  It also converts to a television on weekends. The screen is big enough to watch movies on it, browse Netflix and watch almost anything else. I have grown an emotional connection with my iPad and if you have a family or go to school, I know it will be the perfect product for you as well because it has the capability of helping one though any struggle that may arise.Not only is it an amazing device because of the things it can do but it is also easy to carry around. It is very portable and lightweight compared to carrying a laptop. A laptop does not have the same durability as an iPad. The iPad will hold many memories; it will be like a digital scrapbook that you can easily access and always retain. The iPad memory is what preserves those special moments with your pets, family and anything that is very dear to your heart. The iPad may be purchased with different types of memory according to what it will be used for. Also because it is so transportable it has a great battery capacity, making the life of the iPad longer. Lastly, the iPad's 2 cameras will capture many memorable and wonderful moments. The camera captures clear and vivid images that will last a lifetime.My iPad has been a huge focus in my life. I believe it will be a long lasting item that I will not become bored of or toss in the corner like another abandoned electronic. I will always feel confident in recommending this item and what better place to purchase it than Amazon. Amazon has everything for a better, cheaper price; it is dependable and has the option for fast shipping if needed. My life truly has been blessed by this prodigious electronic. I agree with most people that this item deserves a five star rating. It has been two years since I have bought my iPad and I continue to be a very happy costumer, and will continue to be a consumer of apple products in the future.", "Title": "The People's Choice", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Author": "J.

It came to a cross roads where my husband said if you can prove to me that you need it you can get it... Well need and want are two very different things but I justified the purchase by listing all the functions and daily life the iPad would help with. I got my way and when I got my iPad was thrilled with what I had expected to be a super functioning and helpful tool. I hadn't realized just how wonderful it would be. From movies, music, books, shows, orginization, games and productivity, the iPad has made waves throughout my house. My husband has since admitted the need for more than one iPad in a single household. He is on it almost as much as me! Our 4 year old has found it to be enthralling and has provided a great outlet for learning, and entertainment!  It is easy to use, even for the kiddos and has provided our family with a great helper on long trips. Some of the apps are expensive but that is okay when you are choosy with your needs. Most apps have a free version. I have gotten pretty fast on the keyboard. The iPad connects easily to available wifi and makes using the feature painless. I love my iPad! I reccomend a case immediately! With an investment such as this you can't be too careful. Usually you can find them online or in discount stores. Because the model is the same size as the previous iPad and will likely be the same as the iPad 3 screen protectors need not be outrageously priced. I have had issues finding all the books and magazines I thought there would be, however I expect in short order there will be releases. Apple is always coming out with new and innovative products, accessories and updates. Great purchase!!! I am very satisfied. I am a Android lover, and iPad almost has me convinced I need an iPhone on my next go-round!! We shall see!

Clifton \"Techie Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R2S1RJPRRZAFLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll mix it up a little and start with the things I don't like about the iPad 2. I sold my iPad 2 a while back, but I now have an iPad 3 and iPad Air. 4 iPhones, and an iMac.  On the other side of the fence I own a Kindle Fire HDX 7\", and did own a 7\" Lenovo tablet, both of which I like also.  Obviously the only draw-back I can think of with the iPad 2 is the poor resolution, which probably isn't even that big of a deal to some people. To me it's a deal breaker, and that is why I sold my iPad 2, however when I got the iPad 3 and realized how much heavier it was, I actually kind of regretted getting rid of my older version!  I absolutely love the light weight of the 2, ALMOST as much as I love the Retina display of the successive models.  I honestly can't tell any real difference in the speed of the 2, vs. the 3, vs even the Air! I guess I'm not all that much into games anymore, which is probably the only place the upgraded power and speed of the newer iPads would ever come in to play anyway!  As I mentioned before, the Retina display to me is a very worthwhile tradeoff even for a heavier iPad.  I actually prefer my iPad w/ Retina and keyboard case to a much more expensive Mac book Air, without Retina display. The reason being, no matter how close you set the iPad to your eyes (such as laying in bed with it sitting on your chest, the clarity is just like reading printed material right out of a book, and to me that's more important than a big screen any day of the week! I much prefer the new fire wire charging cables over the 32 pin one that the iPad 2, android tablets, and other phones use.  I hate having to worry about which side is supposed to be up or down...  The reason I would go with an iPad 2 over any of the other Android tablets, including the Kindle Fire, even though probably all the android tablets have far superior hardware for the same amount of money, is that iEnvironment. iOS, iTunes, iCloud, better quality apps, even from the exact same software on iOS vs. Android.  Owning something from Apple is not about a status symbol or anything like that for me, to me it's like owning a piece of art that makes my heart go pitter-pat every time I pick one up or sit down to relax with one on my chest.  My satisfaction and joy of owning and using such device with such a OS and compatibility with everything in my book is well worth the extra money that Apple charges for their devices.  I'm also very proud to support an American company, versus a Chinese or Korean one... sorry, but do you haters even stop to think that all the Chinese and Korean equipment use poorly paid and poorly cared for cheap labor in China just like Apple does... duh!", "Title": "Disclaimer: I a true Apple Fan, only recently converted...", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Author": "Rosemary Witkowski", "ReviewID": "RLTCZ88D1R7XB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Speaker inadequate; must use earphones to hear anything even with volume @ it's max.

It is without a doubt one of the most innovative, useful, and powerful products on the market. That was true in April of 2010 when Apple released the first iPad, and it remains true to this day. An unimaginable number of iPad reviews exist online, so I will not restate the specs or the seemingly endless uses and applications. I will simply state that I have never regretted my purchase of my iPad for one second and I have found it to be one of the most versatile, useful, and simple pieces of technology I have ever owned. It's multipurpose functionality cannot be overstated. I cannot speak highly enough of the Apple iPad - and look forward to the day when I can upgrade to the latest model. Even so, my iPad 2 continues to be fully functional, fast, and sturdy.

It was given to me as a gift. I use android based phones.My impression is that the ipad is very much like the iphone. Exactly the way you get into the phone you do the ipad. The icons are identical. So if you're coming from those other devices it's nice to have the same icons that you're already familiar with.Overall I'm happy with the unit. My only real complaints are the camera, speakers, no siri and lack of microsd card slot. The camera is horrible. I was shocked to learn the mexapixel that comes stock on this device. I don't think it's even 1 megapixel but for taking pictures it's really bad. Very grainy. Video recording is in hd so when the video does come out the picture is good quality. But the camera pictures are horrible.The speakers are mono. I'm not sure why they are mono on such a flagship device. They sound ok but i figured you would at least get stereo speakers with something that costs over $400.Lack of microsd slot. Now this is really bad. iphones dont have them either. neither do their ipods. it's a great way for apple to make more money since you can't upgrade the storage capacity. Android tablets and phones I'm able to add up to 64gb of extra storage. So with this device I'm locked in to what storage I buy. That's apple's deal so take it or leave it.No siri. Upgrading to os 6 I thought that I would at least get siri. No. Apple won't allow that. Kinda sad for their once top of the line tablet. Ok but not really a big deal. Just would have been a nice feature.If I were in the market for a new tablet now, I would seriously consider the Samsung Note 10.1.

It was a huge relief to go back to a bigger screen, fixed keyboard, windowed environment, and faster processing speeds.iPad is a revolutionary device and I find its design and build quality outstanding.  However, once the novelty wears off, it becomes apparent that it is best at supplementing your other mobile devices, not completely replacing them.The device is also fragile, so make sure to buy a sturdy case, especially if you plan to use your device in the field.", "Title": "A revolutionary device but not a laptop replacement", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Author": "Cirerram", "ReviewID": "R1SYRQF41514R4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with the product!I looked far and wide to find a sign of use but struggled to do so.

With apps like Documents To Go Premium and AVPlayerHD, it has almost completely replaced my laptop, and with the keyboard/case combo I ordered it does word processing just fine. It does pretty well with the battery life at mid-level brightness and does terrific on the lowest setting. Im a college student and Im at school for 12 hours on some days, so time is factor and it delievers.My one big issue with the iPad is its restrictions. You can not drag and drop items like word documents, images, pdf's, videos to and from the ipad without itunes, and because the iPad natively only plays a few video formats, you have to download an app if you want a broader selection. AVPlayerHD plays all video formats and actually allows you to drag these files into the sharing option in itunes. Which makes the device feel much more diverse, but the app isnt free, its about 1.99 in the appstore. Aside from the restriction issue I really like it, it hasnt completely replaced laptop, not until your able to transfer items without the use of iTunes.(There are apps like AVPlayerHD that allow you to transfer  certain incompatible files to your ipad through iTunes, and Im sure there are some for photos and documents, but you'll have to hunt for them down and they probably wont be free -but I guess if you can afford to shell out the dough for an iPad you can afford a couple 1 to 10 dollar apps-)I reccomend the iPad, its pretty cool.*Update*I got my iPad on Jan 14th, 2012 and got rid of it February 12th, 2012. It was very fun for awhile, but once the novelty wore off the iPad was just too limited. I needed more freedom and less hassle, I'm not a fan of going through iTunes for virtually all data transferring. I cant hook anything up to it without some ridiculous peripheral; something as simple as an SD or MicroSD card slot could have made a world of difference, my model was 16 gig. After the iOS 5 update it was down to about 13, and I had over 6 gigs for music and 8 for previous iPod touch apps.I had tons of movies but with the limited none expandable space, I could only fit about three compressed movies at a time, which were greatly smaller in size compared to anything offered in the iTunes store. I greatly regret not going with the Galaxy Tab, which in terms of flexibility is incredibly superior, however, neither of these are computers so the overall flexibility I prefer might never be on that level. That said, I probably should have gone with the Galaxy, although, the iPad was very fun, it wasn't for me.", "Title": "I enjoy it", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Author": "Patricia Brouillette", "ReviewID": "R24VXE1RTD9ESC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is definitely worth the money.

I found it was not good for doing my homework asssignments and heavy duty work, because of its small size and onscreen keyboard (not effecctive if you really know how to type). However, once we added a bluetooth keyboard, I thought that it really could be a good \"only\" computer for anyone but a hard core document writer.

I couldn't justify purchasing it for the longest time because I couldn't figure out how to work it into my technology regime. It's not computer enough to replace my Macbook Pro, and it's not phone enough to replace my iPhone 4 (not the 4S) running 5.0.1. When you factor in the price, I just couldn't convince myself that the iPad was something I couldn't live without.Then the iPad 2 comes out: front- and rear-facing cameras were new, so I could use the iPad for face-timing my mom 14 hours away, but it was essentially still something halfway between a computer and an iPhone.Finally I came to a point where I could spare the $600+ dollars to purchase the cheapest iPad 2 capable of connecting to at&t;'s 3G wireless service. I ordered this iPad on January 18 and just received it yesterday, so keep in mind I've only had this thing for one day.Immediately, I can see how the iPad 2 may come off as seductive; essentially, it's a ginormous screen surrounded by a thin frame of black or white (depends on which color your purchase--I bought white) with a single button. There's no denying that it's sexy. When you turn it on (after plugging it into iTunes and completing the necessary setup) you're blown away by the crisp screen--though it's not yet on par with the Retina display of the iPhone 4 and 4S, it's a luscious screen and only the seasoned 'techie' would notice this slight inferiority. The iPad 2's screen is still better than most if not all its competition.Apple also has a leg-up on its competition with the easy integration with iTunes. If your like me and you bought the iPad 2 to simply be what it is: an iPad, somewhere in between a computer and an iPhone--then you likely won't be filling your iPad 2's limited storage with your entire music library. I opted to sync with only my recently played music, top played music, recently added music, and a few recent playlist I've made, which I'll probably replace with newer playlists as they're made. I did sync with a fair amount of the same apps that I have on my iPhone, a handful of movies, none of my ringtones (what would I use them for?) and ended up using about 9GB of the 16GB available on the iPad 2 model I purchased. And in all actuality, after the firmware files and other junk Apple puts on their products, only about 13-14GB of the 16 are available to use out of the box.As expected, web browsing and email are where the iPad 2 shines. It's very smooth, the screen shows side-screens and sub-menus simultaneously, which really makes this thing quick to use. I used a Best Buy gift card I received for Christmas to purchase Apple's aluminum wireless keyboard to connect to my iPad 2 via Bluetooth and, although the keyboard makes me occasionally reach over for a mouse (you must still use the touch-screen mechanism despite having an actual keyboard), typing is a DREAM on here now! Facebook is also very fun to use with the keyboard setup versus the onscreen keyboard or even using the Facebook app on my iPhone. Don't get me wrong, the onscreen keyboard of the iPad 2 is very usable, but I find with a screen as large as the iPad 2's, I'd prefer having an actual keyboard so as to utilize as much of the screen as possible for web browsing, emailing, Facebooking, and anything else.I wish Apple would make it more clear that for at&t; 3G models, the SIM card is not included and will need to be purchased separately. I haven't gotten around to going to my local at&t; store to pick one up, so I'm not too sure how much a SIM card will cost.All things considered, so far I'd say I'm happy that I purchased the iPad 2. It's only receiving 4 of the 5 stars because, although I'm very comfortable with using it and definitely see myself using it on a daily basis, it hasn't replaced any of my other electronics. In all actuality, it's become another separate electronic device that I've incorporated into my routine for its own purposes. The 4 of 5 stars also reflects the price; I understand that you 'get what you pay for' (which is definitely the case for the iPad 2, as it outperforms the competition on every aspect except price), but for a product to ADD to your routine rather than to REPLACE or SIMPLIFY, I think the price could come down just slightly. Even a difference of $50 might be enough to lure in some hesitant customers.", "Title": "A tablet-sized iPhone, sans phone", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Author": "Phandaal", "ReviewID": "RR97WGNVRD6NR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the IPAD2 3 days ago for my mother, 75 years old.She really enjoys it and like how user friendly it is.

Overall, i am very happy with the iPad 2. It is the 32GB model, so i have the extra storage. I have at least 70 apps and 3 songs and no videos on it and i only use up about 10GB so far. The ability to back up all of your documents, apps, music, etc. ti iCloud is a great feature. You get 5GB of free storage but then you can buy additional storage if you need it.EmailThe ability to check email on it is a great feature. I use the Xfinity Mobile App instead of the mail app though so the emails will delete and be marked as read on my computer too, not just my iPad.WebThe ability to go on the web right from my iPad is also another great feature. If i need to look something up real quick i can just use the iPad instead of waiting for my computer to boot up.PrintingOne area that the iPad does need improvement in is the ability to print from it. We originally had a WiFi printer from Lexmark but did not have Airprint in it which is what you need to print from the iPad. So, i went to the store and bought a Kodak printer that says you can print from iPod, iPad, iPhone on it. I thought that that means that it has Airprint which is what you need to print from the iPad. Come to find out it doesn't have Airprint in it, BUT, you can download an app that lets you print from your iPad. So i get the printer all set up, connect it to my network, and try out the app. You need to save a screenshot of the screen you want to print from, the send it to the app which sends it to the printer, and it worked fine. Was just hoping i could use Airprint, but maybe next time.Flash PlayerI was a little dissapointed to find out that the iPad doesn't have a flash player built in. I can't open emails with videos in it or stuff on the web that requires flash player. I think apple should put built in flash player on the iPad, beacuse if they are going to compete against the Kindle Fire which has flash player, then they should seriously consider flash player.

During online chat the chat window from agent disappeared when I started typing.Making corrections to this review I can't scroll down to information I already typed.  No arrow keys,  had to preview then edit, the hit return then delete returns.Hard to place cursor between letters even using a stylusIn app store some games say they are free but eventually you must buy to continue.  Many of the thousands of apps are games and not many useful apps for business.Hard to scroll in form (like this on).  Every time I try to place the cursor I get a pop to cut, copy etcReading books hard because thumb placement on device can inadvertently turn pages or other thumb can take you out of book and to the desktop.

A real OS, flash support, large hard drive, screen can be adjusted for optimal viewing, USB ports, and the list goes on.  Portability is not much different and you can get a lot more for your money.

I have a laptop, desktop and a very good Android phone so I didn't really need this.  But I've owned many Apple products (Macs and iPods) too, but never an iOS device.  So, as a birthday gift, I wanted to splurge (haha).Not to sound like an Apple ad/fanboy (or SJ-RIP), but I do like its `convenience.' I like that I can `lounge' with this instead of being at my desktop, having to deal with the bulk of a laptop or the small size (and power) of my smartphone.  The touchscreen is very responsive and the image quality (be it pictures, web pages, video-especially HBO) is great.  There is little to understand or setup (except connecting it to your wifi, if you got a wifi only; if you know/use Apple, Android or Windows, you'll figure it out easily).  I got a 32 gig because I wasn't sure what my ratio would be for apps vs. media/pic content (even with Apple's cloud service).Granted, it has some limitations (be it lack of `flash,' getting used to the onscreen keyboard and some multi-tasking capabilities), but its conveniences do make up in its usefulness (that is, if you use it for web surfing, checking email, using apps, etc).  I've had to stop myself at times from saying `I'm doing those things on such a thin device'-haha.I'll say that this is a very good `half-top,' that is, half a desktop/laptop.  It isn't to replace my computer or smartphone, but I do find myself using this more in leisure than my actual computer (haha).

Very poor wifi, constantly disconnecting regardless of wifi source, have tried many locations.

It reminds of a circa 80s PC, maybe Windows 3.0 era. It is great for games, books, iPod because they are all internal. If it has to go externally to stream content, or send a message, etc that is when the problems develop.People complain constantly that it does not have a USB port. This is good because endless problems would develop from the use of endless attached devices, just like on PCs.

Again, the return policy was not in the correspondance received from the distributor.", "Title": "Do not purchase from this seller", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Author": "Alline", "ReviewID": "R1GPBMS7HZFYCW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered a iPad touch on nov10th still haven't recieved it I'm not sure what's going on with getting something that I had paid for almost.
