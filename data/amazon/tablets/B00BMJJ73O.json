I bought 3 of these items because they are inexpensive and I thought it would be a good way to evaluate if I wanted to venture into buying tablets for me and my two children. I have waited a while to post this to try and decide if I was being to critical of the product or if it was just that bad. After a lot of thinking, it is just that bad.The only positive thing I can say about this product is it is cheap. After that there is a long list of negatives.Out of the box it just feels cheap and like it could break at any second. After powering it on you want to make the screen brighter but realize quickly that the brightness is already turned all the way up. After that comes the realization that the display looks grainy and distorted, it is actually very hard to read almost anything. The touchscreen is horrible! It is at times over sensitive or under sensitive even with the same amount of pressure applied each time and will register touches a fingertip below where you touch it and you end with things you never meant to open opening or things not opening at all. The RAM for it is so small that after receiving it and updating Google services, you cannot add any apps to the tablet that cant be moved to the SD card right away. Even if you remove some of the Google required apps that cant be moved to the SD card they get downloaded again the next time you need an update. So it is slow, very slow and a lot of apps hang up when you try to open them.Then on one of them the mini USB port came detached from the motherboard when simply removing the power cord. Now I am stuck with one useless tablet and two that are in the word of my children.. Horrible. In fact on of my children refuses to even try to play games on his because he gets so frustrated by how poor it performs. I am trying to work with Ematic to return the broken one and possibly return the other two since they are so dysfunctional. I will update this as info come available but please save your money or invest a few more dollars in a better tablet.", "Title": "Don't waste your money on this.
