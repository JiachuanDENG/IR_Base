Anyway, I decided I would go shopping for a tablet PC that would be good enough to satisfy me until I have enough money saved up to get an iPad, and this tablet is just... \"Truly Amazing!\" I wanted it fast, so I requested the \"One day shipping.\" and of course it came very quickly. I ordred it on Sunday the 19th, and it arrived Tuesday the 21st, it was $20 extra, but totally worth it. Anyway, it came packaged in a VERY nice box with ANDROID printed all over it. They even included a free screen protector! After I opened it up, it was fully charged and ready to go. And my first impression was that the tablet was absolutely stunning. It is fast, vibrant, up-to-date, and has surprisingly loud speakers! I cannot believe this device only cost me $100, and it does such wonderful things! It's equipted with Android 4.0.4, and is very speedy. It has a good weight to it, and it looks sturdy. I do have to say that RARELY it can slow down a little bit, but 95% of the time, it is very smooth and crisp. I will also say that the screen isn't MARVELOUS, but I would like to write a note to anyone scared of a \"Cloudy Screen\" ...Please, read EVERYTHING about the tablet before purchasing it.  The screen resolution CLEARLY LISTS that it's 800X480 pixels, what did you expect, an iPad Retina Display? haha, It's $100 , it certainly will NOT be the best display you have ever seen, so don't scare people away by saying \"Dull screen!\" It honestly isn't that bad, it's just fine! Thank you(:Anyway, this tablet is absolutely fantastic! It has a very fast processer, and when you watch movies and such on it, it's a very nice mini T.V.! I cannot get over how fantastic this buy was! I absolutely LOVE this tablet, I already have 10 apps, 150 songs, and 10 notes on it, and it runs VERY smoothly. It downloads apps and songs EVEN faster than my Galaxy phone! And my phone is very fast! The webcam isn't the greatest though, but it's okay and still get's the job done! After a full month of searching for a tablet to get... I thought this one was it, and for a hundred dollars, this thing is brilliant! GET THIS ONE! And plus, the screen is FINE! And VERY responsive! You will LOVE this tablet if you buy it! This ones a keeper! I really hope my review helped some of you \"Tablet Searchers\" out there. In all, this tablet is nicely sized at 7\", very fast, very responsive, and... Just awesome! Deffinately get this one, you won't regret it!(Ignore any negative comments about the \"Cloudy Screen,\" because it's NOT cloudy. You can definitely see pixels on the screen, but nothing to complain about!)-Thanks for veiwing!:D", "Title": "Truly Amazing!", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Author": "Ray P.

This thing does everything i want it to. Very responsive screen and very nice video playback. Youtube seems to load and run faster than my home computer. Again i have the 4gb version but I would think the 8gb is much better. I added a 32GB flash card and loaded 1200 songs on it. The sound quality is amazing! The camera sucks so go buy yourself a good camera ;) I would recomend this pad. Its my first one and I have been using it for over a month with zero issues. Battery life is about 3-4 hours. All android games seem to work fine and i have not loaded one that does not work. Its so cool to have a nice hand held computer and learn to use android. I hope the US can come out with a good line of these.

Oh, and yes we both were connected to my network.Overall:I am very pleased with my purchase.The touchscreen is very nice.  The size is perfect.

I ordered 2 of the Tursion 7\", 4.0 Android 8GB tablets. One for myself, and one for my 16 yr old daughter to use at school. I had originally started looking at Kindles. I like to read and thought those would be great, but after researching I discovered I could get a whole lot more for a whole lot less. Why get just an ereader when you can have that AND the apps AND the net? Exactly. The tablets arrived one day ahead of schedule, which was great. The manufacture packaging was simple, but secure. The actual shipping packaging, not so great. The box had a rip in it, and one side looked very similar to an accordion. Out of the box, this tablet is very sturdy. It doesn't have a generic feel to it at all. The buttons are nice, great screen, and an overall feel of a more expensive tablet. Friends have even commented on how they would like to have one after seeing how nice mine is. The tablet comes with a wall charger, USB plug, and a screen protector! That was a nice bonus! The manual however, is quite worthless. My advice on that is to just play with the tablet, I did and was able to figure everything out fairly quickly. I also ordered 2 Sandisk Mobile Ultra microSDHC 16GB cards for added storage. Both work amazing! I wasn't sure which card to order, given the SD vs SDHC, as not too many reviews were helpful on this & I am new to the tablet world. However, it says right on the card packaging \"Ideal for Android smartphones and tablets\", so I chose this one, and it works perfect! The tablet recognized the card right away. After plugging the tablet in to my home computer via the included USB, I was able to transfer photos & music with ease. Now, some of the reviews I read said they had trouble connecting to Wifi... Not the case for me. As soon as I turned the Wifi on, it recognized 4 different Wifi connections for my location, and I was sitting outside of a friend's house. One of those connections was hers. I typed in her password and I was connected, with a great signal too! I went to the Play Store, and made a new account, and downloaded SEVERAL apps. They all work great! Then I browsed the web, no trouble there either. Very responsive tablet. I bought a stylus pen to help with clicking on the small stuff as my fingertips seem just a tad too big for some stuff. Some of the other reviews also said that the screen was \"cloudy\", it's not. This isn't an Ipad, but it still has a great screen. Don't let a few bad reviews keep you from purchasing this tablet. The speakers are also pretty great, so I don't know why a few people were complaining about that either. I think some people just have to find something to complain about. My 16 yr old loves this tablet! She's a tech junkie, so if she's impressed, it's pretty great! I haven't had any lagging problems, or not responding issues either. Everything downloads just fine. Now, I've only had this tablet for 2 days, and no issues so far. I will update if anything should arise. But my overall opinion would be if you're looking for an inexpensive tablet with all the bells and whistles, this is the one. It does practically everything an Ipad does, and at a fraction of the cost. I give it 5 stars! It's pretty fantastic! Buy it, you'll love it!!***Update*** After using this tablet for almost 2 weeks, I wanted to add that the Kindle app is FANTASTIC!! There are TONS of free Kindle books on Amazon too! The battery has around 3-4 hours of charge, not bad. There is only one disappointment so far, and it's not with the tablet... the official Netflix app for Android has been updated and the updated app doesn't work. It's not the tablet, it's the app. When the app is repaired, Netflix should work without a hitch. Everyone is having the same issue, but I really wanted to stress that it's not the tablet. Crackle works just fine. I have watched full movies on the tablet through Crackle without any problems.

Basically a full featured iPad at 1/5 the price. No notable flaws; allows me to read books on the go, listen to music and browse the internet at high speeds.

There are a bunch of other reviews, but I will just highlight what I like the best and what I don't like of this small, but not bad at all 7\" tablet, keep in mind this is a budget tablet good for WiFi navigation, e-reading, accessing social networks, playing and maybe very casual MS office files editing.Likes:+ Good, responsive capacitive screen+ Charging time around 4 hrs+ Android system, 4.0.4 version, menus are pretty intuitive+ Micro SD port (up to 32 Gb)+ Sound level from the speaker is decent, includes headphone output and a physical button to increase/decrease volume+ Screen rotation works pretty good+ Able to download apps and games from Google Play channel from scratchDislikes:- No HDMI output (I know it is too much to ask for the price range, but the technical information stated it included one)- Only 1 mini USB port- Only 1 camera (front)- No SIM card port- Instructive is pretty much uselessAt the beginning I had problems to link to my WiFi router and since I read some complaints on this from other reviewers I thought I had received a bad unit... but after searching the web I found some comments related to using all caps for the SSID and password, changed my password to CAPS (I *think* it was originally configured that way, duh!) and voila!The tablet came in a box labeled \"Android\" all over it, included the battery charger and 1 std USB to mini-USB cable. Included the  screen protector from the factory (disposable), but no extra screen protector. I am still looking for a protective case that fits this tablet.*** EDIT 11/28/12 : Finally found a case that fit this tablet almost perfect. The Tursion tablet has almost the same dimensions - but not the connectors layout, beware - as the Kindle Fire 7, and since this case has openings on all the sides (all connectors remain clear and it does not cover the camera), it fit very good: YooMee Black Amazon Kindle Fire 7 Inch Android Tablet Leather Case Cover Folio with Multi-Angle Stand and Hand Strap (Black)(NOT Compatible with Fire HD)Also got a screen protector (includes 2) that fit very good (even the camera cut out fit quite right): eForCity Transparent Clear LCD Screen Protector Film for HTC Flyer (Twin Pack)...More or less 10 bucks for both: what a steal... hope this helps.All in all, if you don't want to spend +250 on a 7\" tablet, this is a very good option, with the basic features at a great price tag... Enjoy!*** EDIT: 11/12: Tablet still working fine, however after falling from the bed (it was inside its case, from about 2 feet tall) it showed a message telling that it needed to be reset... apps installed were lost and a couple of files that were downloaded, other than that, it seems to be working still fine. The main point here is: be gentle with it, keep in mind it is kind of cheap solution, I think it is not designed to survive even light abuse.", "Title": "Tursion tablet...

All were good tablets in there own way and work just fine and exceeded my expectations.  I just wish I would have discovered these tablets first.  I was only able to order 3 of these as they were the last 3 of the nine.  Not only was the price much lower than the other slightly more expensive tablets but these tablets were able to accept all the apps that I wanted to preload to each.  For example these tablets are able to install both yahoo messenger and the video plugin while the others were not.  Some of the more expensive tablets would not allow the install of a couple of the Angry Bird apps while this tablet loaded all of them.  I own an iPad 2 and I am tempted to get one of these myself.  For $80 I just might. Yes, it isn't as responsive and not up to par on the quality of a iPad 2 but what you would get for $80 vice $800 you can't go wrong with this tablet.

I did a very thorough review of tablets to find this one as I did not want something expensive (iPad), fragile (iPod Touch), or overly-proprietary (Kindle, Nook, Nexus).  While it does take some time to learn how to navigate the screens and actions (it is NOT as intuitive as an iPad), it is PERFECT for my eight year old. I have loaded movies and music on the SD Card--everything plays fine, no problem. I have downloaded content from Google Play (Angry Birds, Turbo Grannies, Wreck-it-Ralph, Kindle, Nook, etc.)--all apps work, no problem. Now, the speaker is certainly not great; but for better sound, use headphones. Also, the WiFi antenna range is weak, at best; but, I don't not plan on having my son accessing the Internet in his bedroom any time soon. The touchscreen is not great, but I am using a screen protector. Additionally, there's not a perfect case that matches the buttons and jacks for this tablet. I just purchased an generic folding cover that is adequate. Finally, on the downside, the charger is VERY unique to this tablet and cannot be misplaced or easily replaced--so keep it close.I have NOT used the tablet for streaming movies (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon), so I cannot comment on that function. But, as I mentioned, the wireless range is minimal, at best. So I would imagine that to get good streaming quality, you would have to use the tablet in the same room as your wireless router. I have also NOT used the HDMI connection.Overall, for my son, this is a great product. I would definitely recommend it to folks wanting to purchasing a tablet for their young kids, but not wanting to spend a fortune.", "Title": "Very Good for the Price", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Author": "Wolfyforever", "ReviewID": "R1KT6GOSQ7KXDL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For eighty bucks this is a fantastic tablet.

Now on to a realistic review after 4 days of use.Pros:1.  This little tablet is impressively fast.  It is running at an average of 1.2 GHZ and it may actually go to 1.5 GHZ if an appliation demands it.  I've played a couple of games that seem pretty intensive for a tablet and it runs smoothly.2.  It connected to my home network with absoluely zero problems and it connected at 150 Mb/second.  Also connected at the network where I work at the same speed.  What's with the negative comments about WIFI on this thing?  I think the people writing the negative reviews should probably steer clear of computers in general.3.  Wifi signals on this thing show higher than both my smart phone and  my laptop computer, so it's got a great wifi card.4.  Video looks great on this thing, especially if you rip an HD DVD.  Beautiful. No, not an \"eyebright\" screen, but to my eyes, movies look fantastic.5.  It was $85.99!  I got this tablet, a keyboard/case (haven't received it yet) and a 16gb memory card for something like $102.00!Note:  The micro SD slot works fine and this tablet recognizes the card just fine - BUT you have to push that sucker all the way in!  The reviews stating that \"it won't recognize the SD card\" are most definitely from people that aren't used to the little spring-loaded slots and don't realize that if the card is inserted properly, it is FLUSH - not sticking out at all.Amazon AppStore works great on this thing, as well as the Kindle program for Android.  I've downloaded 2 games and 7 books and they all work/look fantastic.Cons?:I had one issue where the battery meter read 26% and the thing would shut off suddenly (out of power).  I charged it back up and the same thing happened.  I downloaded a program called Battery Calibration from Google Play and followed the instructions - still had a problem, so I ran the thing completely dead again and when I plugged the charger in and got it charged enough to boot again, the battery meter properly read 3% charged instead of 26%.  I also downloaded Battery Doctor so that I could perform full-cycle charges occasionally to extend the life of the battery. Anyway, now when my meter reads 20% or so, it really is at 20%.  Not sure exactly how this was cured, but I listed the steps I took for the hell of it.  This is similar to \"bump-charging\" a cell phone to get it to a \"true\" 100% charge.This still won't connect to my work VPN. Not the fault of the tablet, but Cisco Anyconnect for Android just doesn't work properly - so I will have to lug my laptop on business trips if I want to connect up to my work's network.  Not much of a con, but an FYI.  I don't understand how Cisco can release their own tablet that runs Android, but still not have fixed their program to work with higher-security VPNs.  So I guess the only \"con\" is that this isn't a Windows tablet.  :-)Now, I understand this in't the most technically savvy review on the planet, but I can honestly say that most of the people complaining about the WiFi and the SD card just don't know what they are talking about.  There was one review stating that \"it doesn't really have a USB port!\"  I can assure  you that it does (a MINI-USB port).  Adapters are cheap if  you require standard-sized USB for some gigantic keyboard...So far, I'm a very satisfied customer.  I'll update if the thing takes a crap on me (like I thought it did during the battery issue).  As for now, I have no problem at all recommending this, especially for a Sub-$90.00 price.***P.S.:  The screen ISN'T scratched!  It comes with a very think plastic screen protector that is very hard to see, but it's there!  I had the same first reaction as many people who think it came scratched and sent it back, but had the sense to look a bit closer and see that it is just a screen protector (with 2 VERY thin pieces of tape that say right on them \"please remove before using application.\"11/20/2012 update:  The strange battery issue is still there.  I'll be watching a video or surfing the internet (Wifi connection is still superb, by the way), and at 26%, it will shut off like a plug was pulled.  This is a strange calibration issue that I haven't been able to solve.

Finally settled on a Kodak 8\" tablet case but the tablet sticks out a half inch on each side width wise.Response time seems very slow and the screen freezes constantly.  Several times it just shut down and reset itself while I was in the middle of something.  I can understand this sometimes but I have probably used it about 30-40 hours total and it's done it about a dozen times.Currently it is useless to me.  The plug on the AC/DC charger is so thin, my dog bumped my arm while it was charging and it snapped in half.  Only replacements come from China, searched everywhere local and find nothing compatible.  So, after I wait a few weeks, I will have a charger.

I didn't want to spend too much since she is only 9 years old and can't do much more than play a few games, take some pictures and maybe get on the web a little.  I purchased this one specifically b/c it had most of the things that I was looking for including Google Play store already installed.Well, you do get what you pay for.  The first day I got it, I tried getting some things installed and realized that if you have the tablet plugged in, the touchscreen comes alive...by this I mean that no matter what you are trying to select, it selects something else.  I finally unplugged it and it seemed to be fine.Within a week, the tablet had locked up and would not work.  We have now returned it to Amazon and are awaiting our refund.The worst part is that this was a gift for my daughter's 9th birthday and now she'll have to wait till I can afford a better tablet b/c I don't want her to have to go thru this again.", "Title": "Get what you pay for...", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Author": "Viktor", "ReviewID": "R1RPVQ18158UHS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tablet is super slow. the video chat isnt good it lags.. the camera gives bad quality pictures.Im not happy with it at all it also dies quickly and doesnt charge while is on DO NOT BUY IT!~", "Title": "Bad..", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Author": "robert lee samuelson", "ReviewID": "R16BCGOPGRDMGC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this junk froze on flashing android after less than 2 months. i could never get it to load my netflix account. the manual is virtually useless as it is mostly unintelligible. about the only use i got out of this was playing the preloaded solitaire. i'll never make the mistake of buying anything from tursion again. where i was initially very satisfied with my amazon purchasing experience, the past four months has been a disaster of undelivered,defective or incorrect orders.", "Title": "you get what you paid for", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Author": "Papa007", "ReviewID": "R3QVZWX98UBWIS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tablet seems decent on the outside, but once you start downloading anything, it gives authentication errors with the wifi no matter how much you try to connect/reconnect.
