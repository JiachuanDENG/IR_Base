I was unsure, wondering if the reported flaws were consistant throughout it's lifespan. But I will say now that I've had a chance to play around with it, it really is an incredible piece of technology, especially for people who are new to tablets and want to get their feet wet.As the case with the Kindle Fire HD, the HDX has a forked variation of android. This means that they are slower to update and their choice of apps will be limited. But this doesn't really mean that it's a terrible downside, especially since you have more access to amazon features, something that most android tablets do not provide enough of. The user interface itself is fairly easy to navigate, but limited in customization due to it's OS being heavily modified by amazon. As mentioned previously, if you are new to tablets, you can't go wrong with the HDX, in either of it's models. If you aren't used to technology in general, then this tablet will be perfect for you. It teaches you how to operate the tablet, which swipes do what and so forth. If that doesn't convince you, then the new mayday might do the job. When you press this button, you can communicate with a member of amazon's technical support team who can temporarily take control of your tablet to show you how to get from point a to point b. The difference between stock android and the modified android OS (aka Fire OS 3.0 as amazon calls it) are obvious, starting with the carousel. The carousel itself is a tray of apps and media that you use or prefer to use the most. Though I do love it, my only complaint is that I wish I could modify what gets added to it, so I could have more control over it. Below the carousel are your installed apps, which I absolutely adore, especially since stock android forces you into multi-home screen configuration (which I hate).The choice of apps may be few, but the selection of media is massive to say the least. If you live in north america, then you may know from experience that some videos, books, and music simply aren't available in the google play store. I have to be honest though, I never really did care much for google play's selection of apps, so having a limited selection really isn't that bad. Amazon offers a free app of the day though, so whatever app that is offered for free may vary from a free to paid variation. So downloading it will mean that you will have that app forever if you snag it. So the answer to the question \"what do you get out of the amazon ecosystem?\" is this, their entire cache of media, which is nearly perfect. Some movies and episodes might only be available for rent, but that is still more then what you get with google play. Let's be honest here, when you are buying a tablet, you aren't buying it for what isn't available in another person, but what is available to you. With amazon's x-ray, any x-ray enabled song gives you access to it's lyrics. X-Ray enabled movies and television episodes give you access to which actors play what and things of that sort, allowing you to find out who that one actor is through the help of IMDB. Books give you access to characters and which parts of the story they might show up in and so on. Keep inmind that while HD, HDX and paperwhite owners will find themselves enjoying x-ray, non-amazon tablets do not have this feature. If you have prime, then you will find yourself with the option to download prime-enabled movies and episodes. Having access to prime's library really is something to write home about, especially if you can't stand netflix. I have yet to fully test out the prime-enabled features, but I can safely say that prime owners will LOVE the HDX. The downside to this is that you can only download a handful of their videos (in my experience). But never the less, instant video is still a worthwhile feature to consider for prime members.If you have access to children of any sort (be they through babysitting or your own grandchildren), then freetime will be the answer to some of your problems. You can grant them special limited access to the tablet, which can be very helpful I'd imagine. But considering that I don't have kids nor do I babysit, I wouldn't know. So this is strictly up to you in how you prefer freetime. Playing a song, reading an e-book, or watching a movie is what the HDX is designed for. It offers incredible HD-quality graphics and stunning audio to make your experiences enjoyable. With specifications that are equal to what the nexus 7 offers and considering that there is a 64gb varient (which I own), it is the perfect media-consumption tablet to bring with you on vacation.If you use the internet frequently enough, then you will have nothing to fear! The HDX has a decent email client and web browser (aka silk). Silk is comparable to the stock android browser and should you not want to use the various side-loaded youtube apps, you can still access youtube via Silk and the quality does not suffer in the slightest. The email client does what any email client should and sticks to it, checking and deleting emails. Though I will admit there is a lack of \"select all emails\" option, but this hardly matters to me. Being able to check my email is all I prefer. The calender (or day planner if you prefer) is simple and to the point, proving that not every feature has to come with forty or fifty functions.If you choose not to pay that extra 30.00 to remove special features, you are treated to a lockscreen with ads. I understand that should you pay to remove the ads, you are treated to a handful of features. But having ads on my kindle is nice, since it gives me access to new sales and I like to save money if I can help it.In the end, if you like stock android and long for it's customizability, then don't get an HDX. An HDX is for one group of people, fans of the amazon ecosystem, people who are aware of it not being similar to a stock android tablet and are fine with it. This tablet does well at what it was designed for, media consumption. Which honestly, is something that I prefer to be honest. I have a nexus 7 here and it didn't offer HALF of the functions that are found on an HDX. There is no having to pay over 20.00 to fix the problems present in stock android and thanks to mirror cast, you can use your HDX to stream movies to any mirror cast-enabled device.

When given the choice between this and the Paperwhite, I chose this one due to the ability to use as a regular tablet when I'm not reading.Pros:- The picture is absolutely stunning, especially when watching tv/movies. The picture is vibrant, clear, and sharp.- It's faster than I thought it would be, including powering up and down. Much better than the third gen Kindles.- I'm able to play games like Candy Crush Saga and Wheel of Fortune without any issues.- Can access Netflix, Hulu +, and other tv apps!Cons:-The battery doesn't last as long as I had hoped when playing games but it's still better than playing them on my tiny smartphone.- The weight of the Kindle, while lighter than previous generations can feel heavy after using it for a while. This isn't a huge \"con\" since there are those tablet pillows I can buy to alleviate the need for me to hold it while I watch shows or read.- Every now and then, especially when the brightness is turned all the way up, the screen vibrates which can cause dizziness. It only lasts for a moment at a time but it can get annoying when it does it more than once an hour. When I have the screen dimmed it doesn't appear to have that vibration problem.Overall, this is a fabulous buy, especially for those of us who were able to get a holiday deal on it. Even full price, it's worth it. The Nook was looking good simply because it has access to Google Play and Chrome whereas the Kindle only uses their own proprietary shop (Amazon App Store). But after reading reviews from experts and consumers it seems the Kindle is still the better tablet. Besides, the way Barnes and Noble is heading, they may not be around long enough to support the new Nooks into the future. At least Amazon seems strong and doesn't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon so the Kindle will be supported for years to come.I highly recommend this for anyone older than 10 years old. Even with the parent controls on the Kindle, I would still choose Nabi and Nabi, Jr for kids under the age of 10.", "Title": "Love My Kindle Fire HDX", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1ODI2KL0Q7YAJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can I say about this device.

From a hardware perspective the HDX is outstanding and an attractive alternative to the Nexus 7 if you don't need GPS, NFC or wireless charging. On smaller tablets I prefer the Kindle form factor as I find it easer to hold in any orientation without worrying about accidental screen touches/activations. When purchased I assumed root access and perhaps an alternative ROM would eventually be needed. Turns out a different launcher (Apex or Nova) and a few side loaded apps from 1Mobile were all that was required. Didn't even need to root my HDX which technically voids Amazon's warranty. The \"Mojito\" operating environment is more flexible than earlier Amazon/Fire ROMs; most Android apps run perfectly with exception to the Play store (admittedly a biggie) and some Google creations. I can live without those. And I still have easy access to Prime movies and a few native Amazon apps that I happen to prefer.

But before I get to what drags the score down for me, the good stuff about the Kindle Fire HDX:- Clearly more than a reader.  The hardware in this is powerful and easily high up comparative to other tablet-like device of this size.- Battery life is great so far.- Fantastic screen quality; reading, browsing the internet, using apps like netflix, tumblr, etc., all look fantastic- Sound is also very good, headphones and speakers both- Ads are very unobtrusive (if applicable to your kindle), only appearing on the unlock screen.- Like advertised, works straight out of the box (obviously if you have linked a previously existing amazon account to the kindle)- Big name apps from the amazon store work perfectly. Netflix, Tumblr, Pintrest, Pandora, Skype, Steam, Sonos, BBC, NPR, Twitch are some that I had no trouble quickly installing and using. The email integration is great, and the goodreads integration is absolutely fantastic.- Most of the settings and features are very intuitive, and when using for the first time there will typically be very basic, quick tutorials.- A great deal for the price.- If you own Amazon content in their cloud its a matter of seconds to access it. And if you have Prime, the kindle is a no-brainer.All in all a great device. However there are a number of limiting factors and mild annoyances that build up to a loss of a star for me. The good news is that many of these can be fixed; the question is whether they might actually be fixed. Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store. This is useful in some ways, as you can control apps from your amazon account remotely, but also limiting in others. Compared to the Google Play store the selection is lacking. Although it should be mentioned that this may be partially be design, since there are many apps that do not work (yet) on this kindle's version of android.  Even so, apps can be side-loaded onto the device if you have basic technical know-how. For example, the Humble Bundle App works perfectly on my kindle. To be fair a lot of apps are pretty much crap, but I'd like to have the options for more, albeit mixed with some quality control.- App permissions can sometimes be downright creepy, i.e. a stupid game or simple app having access to data  that it clearly does not need to function and you would rather keep personal. I understand that this is not strictly Amazon's responsibility but rather that of the third-party developers and the owner of the kindle, but its worth mentioning here.- The placement of the only physical buttons, the power and volume buttons, isn't as intuitive as I would like. I find myself accidentally pressing the wrong ones from time to time. I suppose that I might just have to get used to them though.- I would've liked the option for a mircoSD slot, but I guess we live in the age of the ~cloud~. The 16 GB isn't really 16 GB, which is par for the course. But its even less than you might think, you only get 10.6 GB. Unless all your content is on or going to be on your amazon account, spring for the 32 or 64 GB model.- The 7\u201d version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.  Not really super important unless you want it.- The Carousel is plain stupid. This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well. The intended function is to quickly pick up what you had been doing previously, and for reading books this is still useful. However for everything else it isn't very. In particular if you load up things (like drm-free books via usb) they ALL appear as new on the Carousel, and you can only remove them one at a time. If there was someway to customize it, like so that everything new did not appear and you could lock in which apps you wanted to appear on it, then it might be functional, but as it is I ignore it completely unless I want to get back to the last book I was reading.- Some options for organizing books would be helpful rather than just sort by title/author/recent and displaying covers. An option for alphabetized letter sections would be nice, as well as some indication of a scroll bar to the right hand side.- One of the first things I did in my settings was turn off letting things automatically detect where I am located. I have wi-fi only, and I don't really need it on, plus nearly everything asks for it which just kind of creeps me out. But, and this is the most annoying thing, every single time an app or website requests it I get a pop-up asking me if I want to enable location-based services. Let me repeat this: Every. Single. Time. And a lot of apps will consistently ask. So at least once every 5-20 minutes, depending on what I'm using, I will be interrupted by this pop-up asking me this question even though the answer is pretty much always no. Which I thought was, you know, the point of me disabling it in the settings to begin with.

After exactly a week spending with it, I have couple of issues which in my opinion were the deal breakers and with me ending up deciding to return it.So here's the list of good & bad:Disclaimer: The Kindle Fire was at it's latest firmware during my use & tests. No, I am not on payroll of either Google or Apple. I am just an tech geek who owns various devices and wants to see Kindle Fire tablet fix it's Achilles Heels for good.(GOOD)1) Device is extremely light and comfortable to hold.2) It looks & feels gorgeous.3) The display is one of the best. I already have a ipad2 with me and I enjoyed watching movies on the Kindle Fire to be honest.4) It's very fast when it comes to streaming stuff.5) One of the best speakers. The bass and clarity is amazing.6) Got just the apps to get you started.(BAD)1) The power and volume buttons on either side are badly placed and poorly designed in the sense that, you can't differentiate which one is which by just feeling them. I had to keep turning it back to see if I wasn't pressing the power button. Many a times during the first couple of days I ended up pressing the power button instead of volume. So if the lights are off, you will be groping in the dark for those buttons.2) The wifi suddenly loses connection and shows an x mark in spite of it being connected to the wifi network per se. But, it won't go to the internet. The only solution is to reboot the device, after which the x mark on the wifi goes away and everything is rosy once again.3) The sound suddenly stops working. It happened to me twice and both times, the reboot was the solution. I felt like I wasn't using an Android tablet, rather a Windows OS for a minute.4) I am sure the above issues are software bugs which can be fixed in the next firmware update. But, after shelling out 200$ one expects some basic functionality like Wifi & Sound to work without a hitch every other time. These are the things which can't be overlooked. I can overlook the limited app store,but not basic stuff which we ought to take it as granted.5) This is one is not a deal breaker, but wanted to lay it out there with the hope that Amazon will listen to it's loyal customer. If you are looking to side-load Google Apps(G+,Maps,Hangouts,Gmail,etc) with the exception of Youtube, you are out of luck. The youtube app too is just barely functional in the sense that you cannot sign in to your account. That's out of question. I am not impressed with Amazon's closed ecosystem policy even though I understand it's business reasons. What might be good for business in short term might hurt the company in the long term. I feel, Amazon has handicapped such a capable & powerful hardware by limiting the software ecosystem. Every person on the internet,whether Amazon likes it or not uses Google Services one way or the other and by alienating that user base, Amazon not only is slowing the adoption of this beautiful tablet, but also losing lot of customers to Google nexus.", "Title": "Capable hardware,but software handicaps it.I liked it, but couldn't love it enough to keep it.Returning it.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Author": "Sherrie L.

I think what I like the most is that it operates as advertised which is actually hard to find a device sometimes that does this. The blue edges are there for reading and some web pages but they are minor and if this is what it takes to get the colors this thing puts out I'm ok with it. The screen is the wow factor when I show it off but behind that is a great device. I don't know if I'd get the 8.9\" HDX as I still wouldn't mind owning an iPad but compared to the iPad Mini this was just a better value IMO.", "Title": "Works as advertised=Excellent!", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Author": "mystormydog", "ReviewID": "R38ZEG28EKO7B4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The device is great, bright clear screen, easy to read, great as a browser and to play games.

Hands down, this is also the loudest tablet, especially for the size, that I have ever encountered.The primary two problems I have revolve around the screen and the design of the rear of the HDX. The blue haze along the borders of the screen are fairly prominent when surfing the internet and when using any apps with a white background, detracting from the clarity of text and images along the sides of the screen. I am also finding it difficult to hold the tablet in a comfortable and stable manner without constantly shifting the position of my fingers due to the sloping rear edges of the device. The iPad Mini and the original Fire HD are just so much more comfortable to hold for any length of time. Unfortunately, the HDX will be going back.", "Title": "Good for the price, but not great", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "ProductID": "B00CUT8AJM", "Features": null, "ImgURL": null, "Name": null}}
