{"Reviews": [{"Author": "R S", "ReviewID": "R2GATC2JQQF16T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got my iPad a little over two months ago. It's a nice device that can do lots of stuff, but I guess the problem for me is that it doesn't do anything my laptop/iPhone can't do, there's plenty of stuff that my laptop can do that my iPad can't do, and the things my iPad can do, it can't do as well as other machines.Apple's marketing for the device gives you many impressions. For example, that the iPad is thin and light, and therefore easily portable. That the iPad \"puts the internet in your hands\", giving you the ability to browse the whole internet with swipes of your fingers. That it's \"magical and revolutionary\". That $499 is an incredible deal for all of this. Unfortunately, the longer I own my iPad, the more I drift to the conclusion that none of these claims are true.The iPad is certainly thin, no thicker than my first-generation iPhone. It's fairly light, at 1.5 pounds, much lighter than my laptop or even my netbook. The question is, does that make it any easier to use? And the answer is no. The bottom line is that the iPad is still a 10\" device, and once you take into account that it needs to have a case to be protected, it becomes thicker and heavier. (By the way, Apple's case for the iPad is going to run you about $40.) I'm a student that lugs around 10lb textbooks on a daily basis. It doesn't make a difference to me whether the computer in my backpack is a 4.5lb laptop or a 1.5lb tablet. The iPad is no more portable than a laptop.When in use, the iPad won't seem like a thin and light device. Unlike a laptop, which can rest on a desk or your lap, you have to pretty much constantly hold your iPad at the angle that's best for you, and since you need one hand to interact with the device, the job of holding it will be delegated to the other hand. This becomes tiresome after a very short period of time. Although I like the idea of being able to watch a movie on Netflix or read a Kindle book for iPad for extended periods of time, this really isn't feasible. Both of those activities are better-suited for a laptop (or a TV/paperback if you're old-fashioned). If Apple could make the iPad less than a pound, it would greatly help. You could also buy a stand for the iPad,[...]. There goes another $30.So the iPad is no easier to carry around than a laptop and its weight makes it difficult to use for extended periods. So how does it perform when you're actually using it? It does fine for almost all tasks. Netflix videos load quickly, movies rented or purhased from iTunes look fantastic, music from the native iPad applications or Rhapsody or Pandora sound great, etc. I do wonder, though, if the touch interface used by the iPad is really logical. The touch interface in the iPod touch/iPhone makes some sense, because it allows the screen to be much bigger (instead of having many small buttons). On the iPad however, constantly flicking the screen doesn't seem as intuitive. Scrolling through a long list of musical artists for example takes much more grandiose hand movements than it does for an iPhone. Am I saying the touch interface doesn't work well, or can't be fun? No, but I am suggesting that using a mouse or track pad for a screen this large might make more sense. The touch interface of the iPad is not compelling. When using Safari I often think that my laptop can browse the internet much easier.Typing on the iPad is another problem. While the on-screen popup keyboard is a decent size (about the size of the keyboard on my netbook), trying to do serious typing with a 2-dimensional interface is tough. Again, it's easy enough to type with your thumbs on an iPhone because all keys are within easy reach. But if you try to type on the iPad at anything above 40 words per minute (I type 110 words a minute on a proper computer), you will make myriad mistakes that Autocorrect won't fix. The popup keyboard also has the unfortunate side effet of obstructing a third of the screen, making everything feel cramped. Also, you frequently have to interrupt your typing to access a symbol that's much easier to access on a real keyboard. Overall, typing on the iPad is a frustrating experience. Typing up comments on a blog post on Safari might be doable; don't even entertain for a moment that you might be able to type up an entire document on the iPad. Of course, you can buy an external keyboard for the iPad which would make text input a lot faster and easier, but then you have the problem of how to hold the iPad and type at the same time. If you want to go this route, Apple's keyboard will set you back another $70 for the wireless keyboard and $80 for the keyboard dock.I will touch upon one final subject, the apps. It's really amazing what you can do with an iPod touch or iPhone with the thousands of apps available for those devices. My iPhone is at once a phone, text messaging device, calculator, voice recorder, camera, MP3 player, video player, pocket computer, game player, metronome, etc. On the iPad, the apps aren't as impressive. A laptop can already do all of those things for free, so it doesn't feel thrilling to pay $3.99 for a simple metronome app in the App Store, or $7.99 for a word processing app when Open Office is completely free. The iPad is really quite a limited device in what it can do, and again the touch interface more often is a hindrance than a compelling benefit. I bought a music composition app for $12.99 that's absolutely dreadful; I wish I could get a refund because it's now a worthless placeholder on my home screen.  Finally, games on the iPad are often awkward because of the size of the device. Devices like the Sony PSP and the Nintendo DS are designed to fit into your hands nicely. The iPod touch is small enough to work as a gaming device. The iPad is too large and not designed for gaming at all, even simple gaming. For example, the game China Town Wars is quite fun on the iPod touch, and you would think that the generous screen of the iPad would make it even more fun. Unfortunately, you have to stretch out your fingers to even reach some of the controls, greatly limiting the fun potential. Games like Doodle Jump which force you to physically move the iPad quickly get tiring because of the weight of the machine.Ultimately, I think what people want from the iPad is an exciting and easy new way to browse the internet and consume media, but the interface that's used by laptops and computers is by far the superior way to do those things. The iPad has made me realize that I never had a problem with the way my laptop functions, and that part of the reason the iPhone works so well is because it fits into your pocket. The iPad tries to bridge the gap between the two, and the result is an anemic compromise. You get neither the portability of the iPhone nor the power and ease of use of a laptop. On a related note, 16GB of storage memory for a device like this is pathetic. My music collection alone is 40GB, and movies are at least 1GB a pop. You can get a more expensive iPad with slightly more memory, but at that point, the iPad becomes more expensive than half-decent laptops, and you have to start wondering when you have to give in to reason.I would give the iPad 1 star, but I'm giving it 2 because of the build quality (the aluminum backing is nice and the touch screen does work very well), and the battery life, which is sufficient so that you don't need to carry around the charger with you if you decide to take the iPad out. The iPad starts up from sleep in just a couple seconds, app load times are shorter than program load times on computers, and the sound quality from the speakers is better than most laptops. The iPad looks and runs smooth; it loses no points on presentation.As someone who owns a laptop and iPhone, I have failed to find a groove for my iPad. There's never a time when I think \"My iPad can do this better than my laptop or phone.\" If you don't have an iPod Touch or iPhone, get one of those instead of an iPad. If you don't have a laptop, get one of those before you get an iPad. A netbook costs only $285 these days and will give you 10x the storage, more RAM and processing speed, a bigger screen (10\" vs. 9.7\"), a physical keyboard, a webcam, etc.The iPad is an interesting device, but can't currently compete with the form factor of a laptop or handheld iOS device.", "Title": "I haven't found a \"groove\" for my iPad", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Author": "Deej", "ReviewID": "R131H2VAZNT6IA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First let me start off by saying this review is from MY experiences. With that said, I was thinking of getting a netbook b/c I have a 17\" notebook which is heavy and difficult to carry around on long or short trips. I decided to get the iPad instead knowing the flaws like no Flash websites, no USB port etc. What I have found is that 100% percent of the reviews I read prior to buying failed to mention a lot of small detail left out for the average user. I don't own an iPhone or iTouch so I may mention features that are already familiar to people who own these devices. There are many apps but only a few are any good and most of the good ones you have to pay for. I purchased a game \"Super Monkey Ball 2\" for iPad and it looks and plays great! I tried the Netflix app and to my delight I was able to stream a movie and it looked really good. Now keep in mind that these new TV/Blu-ray players that have netflix streaming, you have to have an unlimited Netflix acct to stream movies and I have the 2 at a month plan so this is A+ for me. Now I can sit on the sofa or in bed and stream a movie. Sometimes the wifi signal is not strong when using the net and you will get a timeout msg that reads \"Safari Cannot open page because the server stopped responding\". Also, for those of you who haven't heard some of the iPads have connectivity problems when re-connecting to an already established wifi connection. Apple says only 2% of iPads have this problem. Either I have really bad luck or Apple is low balling the percentage as I have this problem with my iPad and I purchased it on day of release. It's really annoying and you either have to wait like from say 10mins to 2 days to re-establish the wifi connection. It's unpredictable.Now for PC Users, you can NOT charge this device from your computer while syncing. You will get a message next to the battery level that reads \"not charging\". I went to the Apple store to complain and the workers had never heard of this problem. I had to investigate and figure out that the iPad users I spoke with in the store were Mac users. The employees at Apple really don't know jack about the iPad except for what you've already seen and read. It's very frustrating and I fault Apple for being over-kill on the secrecy (sp?) of the products. Finally I read the manual and it specificly states that the iPad must be charged from the wall charger. If you are like me your wall outlets are filled to the max. I was going to return it and was told that a 10% restocking fee would apply which is $50 so I kept it.LIKES:I like the Google maps app. I got directions and put the device in the car and it holds the map/directions even though I lost the wifi connection. When I got lost, all I had to do was drive to Micky D's and get a free wifi connection and even though there isn't GPS in the wifi model, it will map to your current location which is great. I found I was only 6 blocks away from my destination. I have a problem reading the small type in Thomas Guides (CA residents know what this is) so being able to enlarge the map made reading the streets a pure joy.The iBook store will let you sample read any book you have an interest in. The sample comes in the form of a download to your bookshelf. You can enlarge the font but you only have two sizes to choose from. The backlit is great b/c I sat on the sofa reading a book without the need of extra light and the room was completely dark. The page turning is very fluid and instead of swiping you have the option of just tapping the screen and the page will turn superfast.It's great for using in the bathroom on the toilet and I know some of you do this, I've seen the photos online! lol I have also used the internet radio while in the shower. You sit the iPad on the counter and turn it full blast. Full blast is not distorted but it has it's limitations. If your bathroom has a fan, you won't hear it while showering. I was driving to work on the freeway and was listening to an audiobook with the iPad in the passenger seat with the windows rolled down since I don't have air conditioning. It was a lost cause b/c traffic drowned out the volume of the audiobook.I downloaded the digital copy of the latest \"Batman\" movie and it looked and sounded great!Though you can't multi-task yet, you can listen to songs you've preloaded on your iPad from the speaker and still browse the net at the same time.It's great using the iPad at the dinner table instead of lugging and proping my 17\" laptop on the table. Hardly takes up any room on the table.I love the calendar as it has an alarm that goes off even when the iPad is powered off. I totally forgot an appt I had until I heard the alarm on the iPad and read the msg.The iPad fell off the counter about 3ft to a carpeted floor and did not break and still works 100%! Not on purpose mind you, I'm not that stupid. lolWhen you remove the iPad from the box it has a think plasitc wrapping around it. Keep this! As I found that the iPad doesn't resist fingerprints as claimed. However, I found that keeping the plastic sheet on the iPad will protect it from fingerprints and it's still fully functional. You could also buy a screen guard but this is the ghetto screen guard as I like to call it. Hey, I saved money. Plus you can easily remove it and put it back on when needed.DISLIKES:I do photography so I was excited to find you could load photos on the iPad. What I don't like is that you have to do it from iTunes and sync the folders to your iPad. You cannot delete photos directly from your iPad even though you can click on a specific photo and a delete button will appear but when you touch it, nothing happens. I read the manual and it confirmed you cannot delete from the iPad itself.The manual itself is not included with the iPad, you have to read the manual from the Apple website for which the iPad has a built in fav link to the manual. the thing is if you are having a problem and don't have a wifi connection, forget reading the manual.There is a youtube app and videos stream really fast with hardly any waiting. You cannot rate vids using the youtube app even if you are logged into your acct. Everytime I would press the rating, nothing would happen but I notice the youtube website has been revamped to only include a like or dislike button. The youtube app hasnn't been updated to reflect this change. If you go to the youtube website and login, it took me 10mins to load and play a 2min HD video.Even though it is also an eReader, the iBook app has to be installed. It's free but what it doesn't do is sync ibooks you have purchased from other sources so don't think you'll have a one-stop iBook shop. Also, very few books on iBook. Don't think just b/c a book is popular or from a known author that you will find it on iBook. For instance, they have no iBooks by noted author, Maya Angelou who wrote and read President Clinton's inaugural poem.The keybooard takes some getting used to. While it is QWERTY you have to keep your fingers in the air like pretend typing and extend each finger to the letter you want but eyes must be kept on the keyboard or you'll easily type the wrong letter as a standard keyboard you can feel where the keys are. Also, there is something called predictive text where you will start typing and a word will pop up underneath your word it will show a word it thinks you are typing. Luckily the people at the Apple store explained to me how this works. If the word that pops up is the word you are typing, then you hit the space bar and it will insert or complete the word you are typing. The thing is if you are abbreviating a word and not looking it will insert the wrong word. For instance I was leaving a comment on facebook and I typed \"OMG\" but when I hit the space bar the iPad inserted \"OMB\". I didn't notice until I left the comment.This device has a copy and paste function which I understand is on the newest iPhone, well this function is annoying b/c it pops up all the time when I'm not trying to copy anything and I know no way to turn this off. It fills the screen with the sheer blue coating that prevents you from doing anything until disable it which I have to exit from the page and return.Most apps or pages allow you to enlarge the font on the screen or do the finger stretch thing but some don't and if you don't have the greatest vision could be hard to read.  Mostly I find this on the iPhone apps I installed on the iPad.The search function on the iBooks app leaves a lot to be desired.  You can only search exact titles or authors. If you want a subject matter like \"gay\", the results will not bring up books on that topic. You have to know the specific name of the book or author.It has one speaker so watching movies with the speaker on won't give you stereo but if you plug in headphones, viola! stereo sound.In summary if you are on the fence, wait for the HP Slate or 2nd generation iPad which will have built-in multitasking which should arrive mid-summer. If I like the HP Slate then I will sell the iPad but I find the more I use it, the more I like it despite it's flaws.

Netflix has really stepped up the available offerings, too.~there's a KINDLE app now and you can get books from Amazon that the iBookStore doesn't have.

OR  the apple has a few worms. . .", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Author": "Chris A. Kantack", "ReviewID": "RKMINUXIWV6Q5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here's an update to my original review.  I bought the iPad on April 3rd (first day it was available).  Best gadget purchase I've ever made.  The iPad is my first Apple purchase. Prior to the iPad, I didn't feel that Apple's products were worth the money.  With the iPad however, not only did Apple make a great product, but they priced it quite competitively. I'll list below first what I love about the iPad, then where I feel the iPad falls a bit short.Here's what I really like about the iPad: 1.  Instant on capability to the Internet.  With the iPad you don't have to wait long for it to boot up.  When the iPad is completely off, it takes  about 15 seconds to start the device.  There is also a \"standby off\" which uses virtually no power and  allows \"instant on\" capability.  2. Superb web browsing experience.  The iPad comes with Safari, an excellent web browser.  I'm especially impressed with the way I can zoom  in on a page at any size.  (Text size is completely variably-sized, allowing you to fit web pages and text  perfectly with the screen.)  Pages render very quickly (faster than on my many PCs) with no problems.  True, there is no support for Flash but I've found that to be a very minimal \"hardship\" as the iPad has  other free apps (like YouTube) that compensates for lack of Flash.  4. Bright, easily readable and navigable screen  Though not perfect: (I wish it were not glossy), the iPad screen is excellent.  It's 9.7\" size seems  just right and the multi-touch interface works flawlessly.  The way I can intuitively scroll down on  a page makes web browsing and other document reading a real pleasure.  Font support is not extensive but  what fonts are available render beautifully.  The iPad can be read easily indoors or outdoors provided  you are not in direct sunlight.  5. Decent speaker sound and wonderful headphone sound.  The iPad can generate reasonably loud (if not high quality) sound from its built-in speakers.  Of course  it sounds wonderfully if using headphones and/or you choose to feed its audio into a home stereo system.  In addition to the built-in iPod music player application, there are several \"streaming radio\" apps  available that allow you to use your iPad as an \"internet radio\".  6. Huge library of new and existing applications.  There are already thousands of applications written specifically for the iPad.  The iPad also does a  decent job of playing 95% of existing iTouch/iPhone applications.  With over 150,000 programs available,  there are applications already available for just about anything you can think of many of which are free.  My application list includes, streaming internet radio, video players, card games, and news/weather  sites. I've also downloaded the iBooks application which is an excellent book reading program.  Many  free books are available as well as a good selection of current titles.  Another great built-in app is \"Maps\". \"Maps\" is incredible, not only in its ease-of-use but in its ability  to show your current location.  True, the WiFi only iPad has no GPS but via WiFi signals the iPad can  often compute your approximate location.  7. Great battery life!  Even if you use it to play movies constantly or listen to non-stop internet radio, you'll  get around 10 hours or more use per battery charge.  With the lastest software update from Apple, battery  life seems even better.  Even after several months of regular use, I'm getting 10 hours or more of use  per charge.There are some ways the iPad could have been made better.  Here are the not-so-good aspects about the iPad:  1. Glossy screen has its drawbacks.  My #1 concern before buying the iPad was, \"Will I be able to put up with the glossy screen?\".  Indeed, now  that I have had my iPad for 3+ weeks, my #1 complaint is the glossy screen.  Under certain lighting  conditions (outside in the shade or watching dark movie scenes indoors or out), the reflections on the  iPad's glass screen become a real annoyance.  A matte like finish on the glass (like what you would find  on most high quality computer monitor screens) would be a huge plus.  2. Awkward to hold without a case.  When I bought my iPad, I also picked up Apple's $40 iPad case.  Glad I did as, without the case,  the iPad is not very comfortable to hold and can easily slip out of one's hands.  With the case, the  experience is entirely different.  Apple's rubberized case makes the iPad comfortable and very easy  to hold onto.  It also provides the iPad with excellent protection and allows you to prop up your iPad  when at a table.  If you buy an iPad, buy it with a case like Apple's that allows you to use the unit  without having to remove it from its case.  The $40 Apple case seems pricey but I wouldn't take my iPad  anywhere without it.  3. Not a stellar \"WiFi performer\".  I've had no difficulty using my iPad around the house or at work.  But compared to my Acer laptop, the  iPad's overall WiFi performance is weaker than I'd like it to be.  The number of hotspots it can detect  at any given location is only a small fraction of what my laptop can detect. Also, occasionally I'll go to  a restaurant (say McDonald's) that has free WiFi and for some odd reason I cannot get my iPad to connect  even with a strong signal present.  Overall though, I've found the iPad to have a very reliable (if not  very sensitive) WiFI capability.  4. On-screen keyboard a bit disappointing.  Though I feel there is plenty of room for it, the on-screen keyboard does not have the number keys on the  same display as the alphabet.  One has to constantly toggle back and forth between keyboards when entering  alphanumeric data.  I hope Apple fixes this in a future software update.  5. Kind of a heavy unit.  1.5 pounds may not seem like much.  But prolonged use (several hours at a time) of the iPad can cause one  to have sore wrist/hands just from holding the unit.  The longer I've had my iPad the less it's weight has  bothered me.  Perhaps one day, with newer screen technology, Apple can move away from using so much glass  and lower the weight of this unit to under 1 pound.I've had my iPad for 3 weeks and have been using it extensively for web surfing, TV viewing, PDF reading, music listening, and game playing.  The performance of this device is amazing.  Almost every operation and function responds instantly to your command.  This truly is a versatile device that I'll be using for years to come.I've been waiting many years for an affordable tablet PC that could do what the iPad does.  My wait is over.", "Title": "The first affordable tablet computer worth buying!", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Author": "J. Flood", "ReviewID": "R30GIGSNY94PPE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought the 32G Wifi and been using it for about 10 days now.  This is a review of what the iPad actually IS.  It's not a lot of other things so it's kind of silly to complain about that.  Don't buy it if you want to do something it currently can't do.  Hardly a reason to trash it. We are a mixed Mac/PC family with 3 students scattered from elementary school to high school.  This was bought as a gift instead of a Macbook with the enthusiastic consent of the 13 year old who will be the primary user.  It is still probably riding the initial rush any new \"toy\", but I can tell you I'm seriously contemplating buying another when the 3G version comes out.  The second would be a pure luxury purchase admittedly.  This first one though is definitely going to be over subscribed for the foreseeable future as far as I can tell. To begin- It's a fascinating piece of technology.  It would probably make a great primary computer for someone who doesn't really need a real desktop or laptop most of the time.  (Grandparents, etc.) Going forward I'll recommend this instead of the Mac minis I've steered people to over the last couple of years. So far we've only gotten the black cover from Mac as an accessory.  It synced easily with our existing iMac and iTunes and immediately uploaded the existing iTouch apps.  I also bought the Pages and Numbers apps for 10 bucks each.  I downloaded both the Kindle app and iBooks to compare.  I also added NPR, Netflix, The Weather Channel app, and the 14 dollar Elements Book/App.  I synced his playlists and tossed on about 500 pictures from last year and this year.  I'll delve a little deeper into most of these.The Screen- The screen is very impressive.  It really makes the device what is it obviously.  Then again it sucks up fingerprints to an amazing degree.  Cleans up easily though and you adapt pretty easily to the change.  I can't see how to avoid this problem when you're touching the screen constantly and still expect a flawless picture.The E-readers-  iBooks wins on the pure look and feel aspect.  It may just be a temporary effect, but reading in iBooks just felt more like reading a real book.  Kindle wins on the amount of books and cross platform compatibility.  I think I trust Amazon more at this point to keep any purchased books in a format I can count on for a longer period of time.  I have to admit, I'm not fully confident in either company's willingness to port this format 10 or 15 years down the road.  I'll probably stock up on any free books in iBooks for now and purchase anything I need from Amazon's Kindle store.  I haven't sat down and read a full book \"cover to cover\" yet, but I've done some lengthy stretches with both apps.  Please don't hate me, but I found reading on this to be more enjoyable than reading on a Kindle.iPhoto-  Pictures look amazing on this.  I was very easily able to set up slideshows and pair them with tunes from iTunes.  Most of the shots I used were a little over 5mb originally and ported with the ability to zoom in close quite clearly.  I included 1 shot of us standing next to the 20th Maine monument at Gettysburg.  While not really in view in the original shot, I was able to zoom in and read the individually inscribed names very clearly.  This app really wows people with the clarity of the screen/photos.  The sound is pretty good for the size of the device but not amazing.Safari (Browser)- I'm familiar with and use Safari regularly at home so I found the web experience to be normal for the most part.  I noticed occasional blanks where I guess flash apps would be, but I'm more of a news reader.  I haven't spent a huge amount of time surfing on it, but it seemed fine when I did.  No complaints from the other family members.Netflix - This was a surprise.  I didn't realize how well this would work.  We were watching The Office within a couple of minutes and the screen is big enough that two can watch and still have it be an immersive experience.  Of course not everything on Netflix is available for instant view, but it's a free app and we're already members so I can't complain.  This was very easy to setup and I'd recommend trying it to anyone.Pages- this the Apple version of Word and on the iPad it's the light version to boot.  That said, it a pretty nifty little word processor that he's used to do homework already.  You have to sync it to iTunes and then open the doc with the full version of Pages or Word.  Here I have a pretty big beef with Apple.  I've got Pages 08 which I bought in late 08 as part of iWorks.  To sync you have to have Pages 09?!  Word 97 is supported but not Pages 08?  I happen to have Word for Mac so it wasn't a big deal but I was really ticked off at the time.  You might even be able to export as a .doc and then load into Pages (didn't think of it at the time) but I don't know for sure.  Either way I can't believe Apple wouldn't support this out of the box.  Anyway, it worked out fine even if it wasn't terribly intuitive.  Going forward he can do it on his own with no problem.Specialty Apps - NPR/Weather Channel - I can easily see people getting a little out of control in designing their own apps for no real reason.  Both of these were free and pretty well executed though.  There are many of these out there but I had read reviews on both of these so we started with them.  I imagine we'll add and delete apps frequently over time.The Elements: A Visual Exploration- A very impressive educational e-book app that was highly recommended and that I spent a lot of time playing with and reading.  This was a little pricey for an e-book, but it was also rebuilt as app to take advantage of the iPad video capabilities including 3D (haven't gotten the glasses yet).  It's really another wow factor app when showing the app to people.Pro's.  Undeniable cool factor right now (that will fade, I know). Beautiful executed form and basic functionality. Reasonable cost factor for the level of functionality COMBINED with the ease of use and intuitive UI. No wifi connectivity issues so far. Light weight.Con's  The things it doesn't have - camera specifically. The Pages 08 incompatibility. Learning curve for some basics functions Printing more cumbersome than it needs to be.This is the longest review I've written by far for Amazon, especially considering I didn't even buy the iPad here.  I thought it was important though to get a fairly evenhanded review (yes, I know I like Macs) out there from someone who has actually paid for and used an iPad.  It is not for everyone.  If you have a Kindle already there's no reason you shouldn't keep it and continue reading with it.  If you're an Apple hater because of their DRM/closed garden, I totally understand.  If you're a power PC or Linux user you'll probably have something you can tool around with to your heart's content shortly.  For a pretty large group though, I think this is a very viable option to do a lot useful/fun things without traumatizing your already overworked friend/relative who's also your IT guy.", "Title": "Rate it for what it is, not what it isn't...", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Author": "SeaKeithRUn", "ReviewID": "R2K4CBJB89H64O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased an iPad for my wife who loves the instant on, the very portable form factor and the many uses for this device provided by the multitude of varied Apps that you can purchase for iPad.I had heard about the scuffle that Apple and Adobe were going through around Flash support for the web browser but didn't think the issue was of much consequence.As my wife and I have been using the iPad it is becoming very apparent to us just how much Flash is used on the internet. It infuriates me that this device can't perform such a basic function (simple internet browsing) without stumbling over Flash and forcing me to go to my home computer to finish the task.What was Steve Jobs thinking?

I will try to respond.The iPad is an amazing entertainment tool. It will soon be muchmore than that.For those with iPhones and iTouch iPods, you will not be as dazzledas those who have been deprived (I have a Blackberry, trust me, I know).All will love this device, but the is always a price.

Ali \"Relentless Pursuit of Technology\"", "ReviewID": "R1163TL0NF65OS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like many others, I too was faced with the delimma of buying a netbook v. an iPad. I spent a lot of time researching the products and spent my $ buying both an iPad and what I consider to be the very best netbook on the market today - The Sony Vaio X (unfortunately, Sony has just stopped selling the Vaio X!).Let me clarify up front that the iPad simply blows away each and every netbook you see in stores like Best Buy in the sub $500 range. Whether it is design, performance or build quality you'll regret buying one of those netbooks for an iPad. So here is my Sony Vaio X v. iPad comparison.1. Cost:iPad 64 GB wi-fi: 699 (3G wasn't available). But equivalent pricing for features would be + $130 (for 3G) + $ 40 (case since the screen on the ipad is exposed) + $30 for VGA connector + $30 for SD card + usb adapter = $930 (still missing camera).Sony Vaio X(64 GB): $1299 (includes Verizon 3G inbuilt)GAP: iPad Appox $300 cheaper2. OS:iPad: iphone OS - instant on, app store, multi touchSony Vaio X: Windows 7 Professional - powerfulAdvantage: Depends (personally I prefer Win 7 for most things)3. Design: Surprisingly in terms of weight and thickness both are about the same. However, the carbon fiber body on the vaio x is gorgeous! The Vaio X is NOT like any other netbook in terms of how it is built.Advantage: Tablet v. traditional notebook. Again, tablet is better for media and web browsing. Traditional for productivity software like MS Office.4. Battery: The Vaio comes with a standard 2 hour battery which is blown away by the over 10 hours on the ipad. However, the Vaio also includes a 12 hour extended battery. But this battery increases the weight of the Vaio to 2.5lb, making it about an inch thicker (at its widest) and a pound heavier than the ipad.Advantage: Slightly to the ipad, unless you don't care about the extra 1 lb weight added by the XL Vaio battery.5. Features: Vaio wins this hands down with much better array of expandable memory slots, 2 usb ports and ethrnet cable slot and included VGA port, front facing camera and ability to connect an optical drive if needed (I have a super slim usb powered dvd drive). The ipads biggest advantage is the app store, which is more of a software rather than hardware feature.6. Screen: ipad's IPS LCD wins this one hands down. On paper the larger, higher resolution LED backlighting Vaio looks more impressive, but the better viewing angle and high quality glass on the ipad screen makes it much easier to read text and watch movies etc.7.Performance: The biggest advantage of the ipad is that you don't have to wait 60 seconds before you can start using it. Also,the ipad is much faster at connecting to a wifi network.8. Others: While the iPad gets a lot of attention, so does the vaio x. The fan on the vaio x can be a little distracting when it is on. Overall if I think of the intangibles such as the variety of apps on the app store, the speed at which you can turn on the device and start browsing the web, the email client, the photo viewer app etc etc...the ipad is just a much more compelling device. Last but not least the ipad simply destroys the Vaio or any netbook when it comes to gaming! The ipad is an amazing gaming device. If you haven't tried it....you're missing something.MY FINAL ANALYSIS: If I didn't have an iphone or ipod touch I'd say this would be a no brainer. The quick access to email and the internet when compared to a netbook like the vaio x is just too great of an advantage for me. When you have to wait for a device for 60 seconds to wake it up from hibernation and remember to put it to sleep so that it does not drain the battery it's just not as convenient as the ipad. Also the screen on the ipad is just amazing....However, I own BOTH an iphone and an ipod touch. Therefore for me the Vaio X is a more useful device. I also have an ebook reader, so while the ipad is a fantastic ebook reader it would be duplicating another device that I already have. I have decided to return my ipad (I am a day away from the 14 day return period) and it will cost me $70 for re stocking and another $50 or so I spent on ipad apps. Hopefully, I'll be able to use some of these apps when I upgrade to iOS4 in the near future. But $120 was the price I had to pay to know for sure that I don't need an ipad (right now). Of course IF my Vaio X were to die, I'd get an ipad in a heart beat :)", "Title": "Pros and cons of an iPad", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Author": "Terrybfla", "ReviewID": "RADBH7SFPQ72P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my iPad in May so this is a 7 month review.In general, I dislike Apple for the restrictions that they place on their hardware, interfaces and software (especially iTunes).  Loyal PC/Windows user since 1985.  I generally subscribe to the open-source mantra \"If you can't open it, you don't own it.\"  I have only personally owned one other Apple product (the clip iPod shuffle which I liked for its size, simplicity and durability).  I have never owned an iPhone and though my wife has an iPod Touch I was never a big fan of that.  I have heard reference that iPad is a big iPhone or Touch...possibly as I never fully explored either of those two options.With all that said, I absolutely love my iPad.  I did not think I would and was looking towards a Kindle or Sony E-Reader when I got the 64g/3g as a gift from my wife.  I will not rehash the specs or the features...instead, this is what I like and dislike:What I use it for:- Time Wasting: #1 use.  This year I had to spend lots of time in hospital waiting rooms.  This was a Godsend!!  Movies, books, games, Facebook and email.  It kept me from being too bored anywhere I know I will be waiting : Airport, DMV, Dr Office, Parole Board, Parent-Teacher meetings...- Reading: In bed at night, at the gym on the elliptical, on the plane.  The reader is a good one.  I have lots of ePubs and it handles them very well.  Magazine PDFs look great.- Web Browsing: I prefer Atomic vs. Safari and the browser works well.  Miss Flash, but not terribly.- Facebook: Using the Friendly app due to lack of Flash conflicting with the picture uploader FB uses.  Easy to use and quick.- Games: At $0 to $5 (for most game apps) the iPad is an ever changing game platform.  I probably have bought 50+ of them by now.  Get bored?  Get another cheap.  Sure a PSP functions better, but try cycling through 50 games in a PSP...big $$$ and trips to the store!- News: USA Today, NPR, CNN, SkyGrid and Instapaper are my primary news apps.  I review them in the morning on the elliptical at the gym...no way to do that easily with paper.- Travel Apps: Flight Tracker, Weather, GPS, Maps, UrbanSpoon, Goby, etc.  All useful when traveling.- Crossword Puzzles and Words With Friends: hooked on both these apps.What has it replaced?- Calendar/Contacts: Synced to my online and Outlook calendars it acts as a planner substitute.- GPS: in the car using the $3 Motion X Drive GPS.  I like it better than the one integrated into my car (that I paid more than $3 for).- Books & Magazines: Like going on vacation with a library without the bulk.- HP 12c Financial Calculator: Expensive app ($12) but one less thing to carry.- Laptop:  Not a true substitute but pretty close for much of what I used it for - especially for traveling (browsing, email, picture storage, etc).  I have not fired up the laptop since I got the iPad.- MP3 player: I use it, but I am not wowed by it.- Smart Phone: Possibly...not sure on this one yet.  The phone can do most of what the pad can do but it is SO small!!- VCR/DVD: We have a TV connection cable and it becomes a portable video player for travel.Like- Build quality:  It's heavy and well finished. It feels solid and looks sleek.  The Kindle, E-Reader, and other readers do not measure up.  Even the Galaxy (which I view as the closest substitute) does not \"feel\" as good.  Not very scientific...but it is what it is.- App Store:  With 300,000+ apps, the app store seems to have at least one app to do whatever I am looking to accomplish.  THIS is the key to the iPad (and probably iPhone and Touch as well, though I confess ignorance here).- Size:  I am 47 and now need glasses for reading.  The screen size is great.  Can't imagine squinting at a SmartPhone screen for some of these functions.  Typing is very easy compared to a smartphone though not as easy as a PC.  About the same as a small laptop.- User Interface Experience:  Smooth, seamless, instant response.  Very, very well polished.  Have played with Android devices (Galaxy Tab and Droid X) and don't see the same polish.- Camera Interface: Basically an SD card reader for the iPad.  Backs up my camera easily.Dislike- Size:  Need a \"man-purse\" or \"European Should Bag...it was a gift!\" to carry it.  Most of the time I keep it tucked under my arm.  It is also pretty heavy to hold and read a book.  I keep it propped up somewhere to do read extensively.  But...heavy = build quality.- No Flash:  Should play it.  No reason not to.  I personally have not experienced a lot of problems with this but I do not frequent youtube or gaming sites.  I see it on maybe 15-20% of the sites I visit and generally can work around it.  I am told HTML5 is the cure...we'll see.- No Camera:  Should have one (or two) and should shoot video too.  Bad oversight.- Charging:  Though battery life is OK (I must charge mine every night), the 10Watt charger is annoying.  Wish the standard 5W USB would work.- Cases:  Yeah.. you will want a case.  2 options - minimalist or protection.  I use the Apple minimalist case and like it, but it does not offer much protection and the viewing/display options are limited.  With more options and/or protection, size becomes even more problematic.- Photo Album:  I can move my videos, TV shows and Books around...why can't I organize my pictures!?!?!  More of an oversight than a flaw but annoying.What to buy?- Want an eReader?  Look at the file formats they can handle and the hardware quality (controls, viewing, etc).- Want a tablet (I think this is the genre)?  Look at the apps and the ability of the hardware to handle them well.  This is the key to the whole experience!!  Software that works well with the device, which can be downloaded on demand and managed in modules. Apple appears to have done this well.In summary, although not previously an Apple fan, I really am impressed by my iPad.  I liken it to my first digital camera (a gift device that I also did not want) which changed the way I viewed and used photography.  The iPad fills a gap in lower end mobile computing that I didn't really even perceive was there until I got it.  The Apple control/oversight is both restrictive and enhances the user experience.  So far, I have found it to be more useful than detrimental.  Like my pocket digital camera, I take the iPad with me most everywhere.Hope this helps.", "Title": "Very pleasantly surprised", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Author": "L A Dutton", "ReviewID": "R1XMEKY3NEG96N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The apple iPad has replaced my laptop, mp3 player, potable DVD player and eReader when I leave home.

The sound is great when using earphones, ear buds or external speakers.  But the fact that there are over 200,000 apps, something for everyone, is incrediblle. I have the Wi-Fi only version which I use at home, hotels and Wi-Fi hotspots. I decided that the 3G AT&T; monthly charges were a little to pricey for my pocket book. Watching videos and movies on the LED backlit screen is of great quality, beating even some of the HGTV's. I love the fact that depending on what you are doing, you can turn the iPad either horizontal or verticle. The keyboard is of good size, not like the tiny one on the iPod. I find that the 32GB flash drive is quite sufficant for me. I have approximatly 1200 songs, a couple of books and 3 or 4 movies stored on it with room left. This is a nice little 1.5lb bundle of joy. I don't leave home without it!", "Title": "A Perfect Replacement to Lugging a Mess of Other Electronics", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Author": "Holger van de Linde", "ReviewID": "R1DIE9NYGM3Q8H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a German customer and my English is not perfect so I apologize for that in advance. I have bought the English version of the IPod 64GB. Well, a lot of things have been said about the product's features and how great it looks and all. Time to point out some negative facts and reasons why i would not buy an Ipad again.I noticed that people praise the product based on their first impression rather than on actual every day experience.Here are some disturbing facts about the all new and shiny iPad.-Overpriced! If you consider that you can buy a netbook for half the costs, which outperforms the iPad in just about every way this latest Apple toy is clearly overpriced. Ok, it's not a netbook and it's not a laptop. But hello? One wonders why Apple's profits have skyrocket in recent months! A retail price of (maximum) 500 USD would just about be acceptable. But 800 USD for a product that offers less features than the late IPod 4th Generation is a joke.Unlike the iPod 4G, the iPad has no still camera and no video camera. It's also impossible to do Skype calls at this time. The obvious benefit over the iPod is obviously is  the big screen and as a result from this, the better resolution and picture quality.-Another major drawback: Apple does not allow iPad/iPod users to view flash content. Yes, that's right! If you want to watch a video on the internet that requires Adobe's Flash Player, your outta luck! And since 75% of all internet videos use the Flash Player, this is a major setback!According to Apple, the use of Flash Player would lower the performance of the iPad/iPod and also would lower resources to a rather low level. Excuse me? If am i paying 800 bucks for a so called \"premium product\" i get to decide which content i want to play and not Apple!Here we go again, with the comparison to the cheap but solid netbooks of today! All the netbooks can play Flash content, not to mention the other countless applications users have become to appreciate such as Skype or web bases games. Netbooks have more disc space to offer, you get to decide what programs/applications to install and so on. They also offer a real keyboard and countless plugs which are essential today. What does the iPad have to offer?Obviously no USB, no HDMI, no mic, no firewire etc. And again, for double the price over a modern netbook that is!But the list of flaws goes on even further. Many of the apps that you can download from the apps store and iTunes are loaded with bugs! I recently purchased an eBook and after it finished downloading i tried to open it only to get the following message thrown into my face: \"failed to load book because the requested resource is missing\".That was it for my first reading experience. I am still unable to open the book and i now have to contact iTunes for further assistance.If Apple wants to sell Computers to the mass, they need to re-think their price strategy. If you want to buy a protective hard plastic case, or a similar  nylon cover, you end up paying between 20 and 80 (!) USD. That's insane, knowing that the production costs for an iPhone/iPad plastic shell are in the range of 25-40 cents!Wake up Steve Jobs, success is one thing but endless greed will always keep you under the wings of big Bill Gates, who remains to supply 90% of all Computers to consumers around the world.

I was looking for a device to read text books in pdf format. I was looking for a device with at least 9.7\" display. The Plastic Logic device doesn't seem to be coming out any time soon and I wasn't sure about the Iliad. I was on the edge  between the Kindle DX and the Ipad. I checked out the ipad and looked at some pdf's and was concerned about the display size, practicality of zooming in every time and prolonged reading on a back lit screen.After much deliberation (and research) I bought the Ipad. I unpacked the box at around 4pm. I couldn't put down the device until 2 am! It took all of 5 minutes to connect to my 802.11B Linksys router (it negotiates the WEP/WAP, key number and simply expected the Password/Key that I had used for security). I have worked on many high end LCD monitors but I have never seen a display so plush! My jaw literally dropped when I saw Magazine covers on zino (its a free app). The choice of applications on iTunes is mind boggling. At first I was sceptical about watching movies at this size. But the Netflix app rendering is so smooth, I felt like I was watching at 1080p on some high end SONY Bravia. Wall Street Journal , although expensive, is laid out so well that if other papers followed suit, it will bring the demise of their physical circulation immediately.Battery life is another thing that is so surprising. I had the device on, almost constantly, for almost 10 hours, and the level fell barely to 80%.Finally what really blew me away, is the finger swipe movement. I have never used an Ipod touch or Iphone before, so this was new to me. It is extraordinarily accurate and smooth and beats 20 years of Mouse development! The virtual keyboard is perfectly sensitive.Oh, and yes, I downloaded the GoodReader app and finally got around to reading my pdf text books. The screen is a bit small for reading text books with tables and network diagrams, but the pdf reader has a great margin-crop feature. Using this feature in landscape mode, with constant zoom, reading the most complex pdf becomes a breeze.

I have a nice PC, and an iPhone, but I have never owned a laptop. I needed something with some portability that would allow me to have a good e-reader, do some light Excel and Word document editing, and some internet browsing around the house. I have an infant son and it is not convenient to always have to be in the office doing things that I can now do downstairs on this unit.This is amazing. I have a router that is at least 5 years old and I haven't had any problems with the iPad (or my year old iPhone 3GS). It works remarkably similar to the iPhone, except it is obviously bigger. I have PDF textbooks for class and it was simple to email them to myself, open and save them in iBooks. There were no formatting errors, nor was there any for .doc files that I converted into Pages. It was much simpler than I imagined. Actually, until I looked closer at buying this, I didn't even realize I had the option to convert .doc and .xls files into usable files on any Mac unit, so that was the clincher for me. The internet is very fast and easy to navigate. I synced it with iTunes, had my PDF's, a few .doc files imported, email set up, some music and photos transferred within 30 minutes and I did some homework on it.As an afterthought, I have a huge collection of sheet music that I am going to scan into PDF format and transfer to the unit. I can just set the unit on my music stand; the back light will serve me well.This is a near perfect unit. I got the 16 gig wifi unit because I already have a big music archive on my iphone, I don't need my entire photo archive with me everywhere I go and if I am going to watch something while traveling, a few good episodes of the Simpsons will be fine. I will probably just read on it anyway. If you have an ipod or iphone I don't understand why you would need 3G and a huge storage space. This is a great supplementary computer for me and having used it for a little bit I know a MacBook will be my next purchase.Also, the bluetooth keyboard works great. Wall Street Journal app is incredible too. The only problem with Apple are the huge lines and wait times while at their retail stores.I read a lot of reviews and I have not yet experienced the Wifi connectivity problems that others have complained about. Like I said I have an old rabbit ear style router, and it is upstairs. I have been using the iPad downstairs, on the far end of the house and I am getting full bars.

A ton of programs of course through the Apple app store. So why not 5 stars. There are two things that bother me about this device. It has major issues with downloading games from the ipad app store app. Why that is I don't know. I have tried and least 3 games and ended up just downloading them on my main laptop and syncing. Easy enough but why the extra step?. I never had problems with iphone like this. Second of all it does not do flash video. Apple stupidly made a decision not based on customer needs but based on a stupid conflict with Adobe. Flash is still widely used throughout the internet and its a pain to not have this capability. You can use Cloud Browse app as a work around but its clunky and not worth the hassle. On the positive side the battery life is great. The ipad is the beginning shift to major laptops having touch capabilities and I would not be surprised to see lets say a macbook air with  boot capabilities to run both ios an mac os as well as windows 7. Stay tuned Apple has some tricks up its sleeves but for christ sakes get flash to work on this device. At over 600 plus dollars there is absolutely no reason it can't. Steve Jobs is stubborn.

Then reality crept in, and for a while it seemed like I had purchased a very overpriced netbook without a keyboard. But with the Kindle app for reading and Netflix for movies, it was really great for those two uses. And then more apps came on board, iTalk for recording meetings, Goodreader for opening all those different file formats, Atomic web browser with all the features missing from Mobile Safari, plus more. And the games. All those games. My PS3, Wii, Xbox, and PSP are collecting dust. Games on the iPad are great, getting better, and relatively cheap, usually under five bucks, compared to fifty or sixty for console games.There came a day when I realized that I hadn't touched my netbook or laptop for weeks. I still lugged the netbook around, mostly out of habit, but I never used it. Things were easier on the iPad. And faster, overall--I could turn on the iPad, load an app like Mail or Facebook or weather and be done with it, and have the iPad back in the bag in the same time it would take my netbook to completely wake up (not just for Windows to show up, but to get to where I could actually run a program). Plus, the iPad seems to have endless battery life. Plug it in every few days, and it's fine. I've become used to seeing 5% battery left and not instantly saving everything and looking for an electrical outlet. 5% is plenty of time. Also, if I have to type something long, which the iPad is pretty poor for, you know what? I use my desktop computer. There isn't really a use when my laptop is a better choice than either the iPad or my \"real\" computer. But I have big fingers, so I find the keyboard on my netbook to be only slightly less useless than the iPad's virtual one, and my laptop to be a poor substitute for the full-sized keyboard on my desktop.The only things I don't like about the iPad after using it for these many months are: The weight. About half the weight would be good. And the AT&T; 3G. It is essentially useless where I live. I unsubscribed and turned it off for good after about a month of frustration. If and when there's a Verizon 3G iPad, I'll think very seriously about getting one.Overall, I love it. I use it constantly.

Then, in April after they were released I tried a couple of them at a univerity and immediately felt that I must have one.This is the kind of device I have long waited for, a fantastic tool for reading technical manuals and books, access to internet, weather radar, GPS information, e-mail, etc. Having communications available anywhere anywhere I can get wifi or AT&T; cellular is more than just a novelty for me, it has become important and useful. iPad is a surprisingly good tool for writing. Some really excellent apps, like the iAnnotate PDF reader, which is vastly better than the Adobe reader (and it allows you to create your own bookmarks and annotations in the PDF.) In summary, the iPad redefines what a personal computer is for me.Addressing some concerns I and others have had:1) It requires you to have a PC or Mac so you can initially set it up, and you need to connect to your PC to perform some kinds of operations, like setting up some e-mail accounts.2) Eye strain has not been an issue for me, and I use it mostly for reading. The display is fantastic.3) The keyboard seemed at first glance like it would be horrible. This is not the case at all. I am surprised at how good it is, and I can touch type with it efficiently when using the wide screen, or use it in Blackberry fashion when using the narrow screen.4) There have been some usability issues on web sites because not all of them support the iPad yet, at least not fully. There seems to be an effort afoot to replace Flash with a new standard, but meanwhile many videos cannot be viewed because the iPad does not support Flash.5) Magazine subscriptions are not widely available for the iPad.6) I am a life-long \"book person\", and have had bad previous experience with electronic books and PDF documents. I must honestly say that reading with the iPad has been superior to using a physical book in all ways but one: the ability to pre-read the book quickly, and as I use it more, I think I will find ways to approximate the value of a good preread. It's truly amazing. I have not tried the latest Kindle and similar devices, but I assume they are comparable to the iPad in readability and responsiveness.

I purchased the 64-Gig Wi-Fi version on day one and immediately had problems with it. I arrived at my hotel from my business meeting at about 5pm and wanted to play with my new toy. It took 3hrs to sync my 50 Gig iTunes Library because it kept crashing, it was nightmare because it kept finding \"corrupted\" files during the sync process and crashing - these are files I purchased in iTunes and had to DELETE before the sync would work and to make matters worse I can't re-download those files, so if I want another Digital copy of Terminator - that work, I would have to buy it (even though it had always synched fine before). It's why I loathe DRM. The hotel that I was in only used a hard wired connection, so I had to go down to the lobby to use the WiFi and set up all my apps which wasn't cool. Due to the lack of multi-tasking it took almost two hours to set up my apps like the Kindle, Marvel, etc. Because I could only download one book at a time and I had to sit there and watch the download progress bar. It was almost 11pm by the time I finally got everything setup.At the Airport, I didn't want to pay $10 for two hours of WiFi (another reason I hate WiFi only devices, most places charge too much money for it and it rarely works well), so I tried to watch a couple of movies and the screen completely washed out in the \"bright\" light. I couldn't see any movies that were \"dark\" like Harry Potter, Xfiles, etc.  After one day of minimal use this thing had Smudges all over the place, it looked ugly when turned off. Luckily the smudges don't really show when it's turned on.The real trouble started when I got home. The thing refused to stay connected to my Verizon Fios network. Every time it woke from sleep not only did I have to reconnect but I had to re-enter my Network ID, reading web sites became an exercise in frustration because it disconnected literally every 2 or 3 minutes. And a lot of Apps simply \"crashed\" the second the connection was lost. So it failed miserably at it's most basic function. I found it to be too big, heavy and uncomfortable to actually read in Bed, I actually had to lay it down in landscape mode with a little prop stand provided by the iPad case to read it. If I had to do that, I'd might as well use a laptop. I'm assuming I would have gotten used to holding if I had more time to play with it, but I only had an unreasonable 14 days to return it.When Apps work, they were beautiful to look at and use - Plants Vs. Zombies, Marvel, Comixology, ABC, Yahoo (surprisingly amazing free app), Kindle, Zinio, etc. The Apps is why you get this. The problem is a lot of these apps are way too much where they are .99 or 2.99 on the iPhone, they are inflated to $10 and up on the iPad. The price inflation is ridiculous, especially considering most of these apps won't work on your iPhone. I'd be willing to pay $7 or $8 if they worked on both.For a device that's $900 (it's only worth purchasing the 3G 64 Gig Model - you will fill up the 16 and 32 gigs quickly when the apps are averaging almost a gig), it's damn difficult to actually get my files onto the device. I have a bunch of Comic book .jpgs, word docs, etc. that I would like use, but have yet to figure out how to actually get them on the device. I broke down and bought the Pages App because that was supposed to make it easy, but it did nothing to help me get my files over. So that was a waste of money. Apple just screwed over iPad users by delaying the release of the SDK 4.0 that brings multi-tasking until this fall.So yes, I returned the WiFi version, I'm tempted to get the 3G version but $900 is just too much for a device that's only based on potential, and not what it actually is today. It also kills me that I kind of miss having it and I would be rewarding Apple for making the WiFi version so Gimpy that I'm forced to purchase the 3G when I already know how bad AT&T;'s 3G is.", "Title": "Wait 3G Version, Not Worth The Money, WiFi didn't work", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Author": "mnl", "ReviewID": "R2W6LWZ0CESKZ9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i ordered an ipad1 from IMG Direct through amazon and it came today.  the ipad was DOA (dead on arrival); it would not start regardless of the type of reset i tried.  the ipad is a 3G device but there was no sim card in the tray.  when i looked at the box, the original serial number was scratched off the barcode label, telling me that the vendor had sent another (broken) device instead of the one that was originally in the box.i have returned the product to amazon and requested a refund.  it's a miserable business practice to ship defective, incomplete and altered products, especially when the vendor clearly knows what they are doing.", "Title": "defective, incomplete product w altered serial number on the box", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Author": "TTN", "ReviewID": "R1MM73BWT22UPC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me first start off by stating that I am not the biggest Apple fan when it comes to their OS. I have always been a tech geek and love all things tech; so with that said I usually like trying everything. I purchased this iPad 64 during it's first month of launch and here are my thoughts.Hardware: Like with all Apple products, their hardware is always top notch. The design is very seamless and everything just blends together well. If you own any of the iPod Touches then you will be right at home here, even down to the scratch prone back. In terms of weight, the iPad feels light initially but after a few minutes of web surfing or book reading you will soon realize that you're holding a 9.7 inch screen device. Not to say that its heavy, it just takes a little getting use to. I've read many reviews where people complained about the large screen bezel, but I rather like it because it gives you more real estate to hold the device comfortably without accidentally triggering the touch screen. Final verdict on hardware? It's worth every penny.Software: Here is where my love-hate relationship with Apple starts. I have never been a fan of their computing OS or their mobile iOS. If you own an iPod Touch (which I own 2), then the interface is identical. Although there are a few tablet optimization on the iPad (like the calendar and email), I don't think its enough to justify this purchase if you already own an iPod Touch. In term of usage; pretty much everything I do on my iPad I can also do on my iPod Touch. I think the software has potential and will grow as the developers create more tablet centric apps. Final verdict on software? If you have an iPod Touch, been there done that.Overall use: So what do I use my iPad for? My iPad actually get heavy usage, I work in an ER and I consult patients on a daily bases. I use my iPad to input and extract data during my consultations. Extremely useful and handy in that regards. I love the ability to have my iPad boot up instantaneously (as appose to my lap). Being able to talk to my patients and swipe and flick through my forms is almost effortless. I also use my iPad to create art work using SketchBookPro. There are times when I have to contribute to text book chapters and a figure or diagram is needed. I actually create and draw those figures on my iPad and import them to Photoshop for final touch ups. I think being able to do these 2 things makes the iPad purchase worth while.

This computer ABSOLUTELY fills a niche.Good:Easy to lug around in a bag, or in my car, or into a store, to a meeting, wherever.  Very light and portable.I can VPN to my MAC, use it as a remote control for my TV, read PDF books on it (love doing that), play games, and I am finding new cool stuff everyday.

It is nice to have a computerish device with connectivity anywhere, like at a store where you want to do some price exploring.Best:  Screen.  Unbelievable.  I put a few movies on here in case I fly or use the netflix app and it looks great.Bad:No multitasking.  Apple needs to speed it up, but it's coming. You shouldn't do any heavy multitasking but one thing that is annoying is I had a timer going and logged into another app.  Forgot about it and expected it would still go off when I logged over, but it didnt.No Flash.  Hasn't been very inconvenient yet.  Anyone who has taken any course in web design is taught that you design two sites - one for awesome computers and one for those people who replace a computer every 10-15 years.

When I wanted to get a tablet I decided on the ipad since the reviews were mostly through the roof, with the exception of a disgruntled customer who bought a used one and is mad at the seller. I also wanted to try an Apple product out and see what all the shouting was about.Now that I have had the device for over a month I can tell you that it is well built and solid. I like the simplicity which some might find limiting since unlike my Droid phone, there is only one main button for navigating in and out of applications and a volume control & on/off switch. That's it. The virtual keyboard is plenty large enough for most tasks but is really not designed to replace a laptop computer... yet. I have the ipad first generation 64gig so there is no camera and that's fine with me.The nitch I typically use this device for is reading e-mail, reading news stories, watching Netflix movies and playing games. It usually does these functions flawlessly. I didn't get a case since it adds to the bulk. I keep it stored/protected in a thin cotton bag that doubles as a screen wipe. I know I know, some may find this sacrilegious, especially Apple heads. Like I said the device is solidly built. A friend of mine commented that the ipad is just a big iphone or ipod touch. I don't know, I don't own either.The only negative I have found is that some apps require an additional step to load into the ipad. A text window appears telling me I have to go to the Apple App store from my desk top computer, link my device to the desk top and finish loading the app into the ipad from there. I haven't done that yet but why the additional step with some apps? Can someone explain that to me? All the apps I want to add to my Droid phone can be done in one step by simply going to the Droid market place. If you are considering a tablet, the ipad is a good choice.

I tried to teach my dad how to use a PC to do basic web surfing, it is almost impossible.

As long as you have iBooks app installed, you can open the attachment on your email using your iOS device and it will automatically put it into the iBooks app.-Internet - is great for web surfing.  Its instant on when ever you want to look for something on the web, very convinient.  Fun when you are watching tv shows, you can look up trivia or information.-Online Shopping - Amazon has an app and many other retailers as well.-Find reviews - example we use the Yelp apps often to find reviews of resturants in our area.

I know a few people who lost money to fraud when they use the PC for transaction.

I would love to tell you a nice story of all the fun time I had waiting in line talking to all the people waiting to get one. But my Apple Store in Atlantic City had no one waiting for it I walked in picked mine up paid and walked out no line at all.Well jumping ahead 8 months to today my Ipad goes every where with me, to work, shopping to the doctors out to eat it is like my new best friend (gee I may need to get a real life). At first everywhere I went people were like \"is that really an ipad I have yet to see a real one in person\". They were amazed as I showed off my Ipad my sister was in awwe and was second guessing buying her daughter a nook until I told her the cost of the Ipad.The unit melts into your life you find your self reaching for it to do everything. If I am in the kitchen cleaning or cooking I watch shows from netflix on it. Sitting on the couch I scan the news while watching TV. In bed before going to sleep I play some quick games or read a book. It really fits nicely into your life allowing you to do some many things so quickly and easly.With the latest upgrade the added combined email mailbox is great reading mail is quick and easy. some of the apps I use each day are:PandoraEmailApp AdviceSafariTodoABC NewsABC PlayerYahtzeeScrabbleGoodreaderAnd belive me there are many more in fact this holiday EA put almost all of thier titles on sale for .99 each. Now that beats a PSP or GB game price hands down. Battery life is outstanding I use it all day and it stays charged.Now some of the downside of the Ipad. Keeping the screen clean can be a full time job. Storing shows or movies on the ipad quicking fills your Ipad up. If I am on a long trip and need to have a lot of videos with me I take my Archos 7 which has 5 times the storage space of my ipad 160 gigs. I had my Tivo transfering tv shows directly to my Ipad and it quickly was filling up. Syncing is another issue it takes a while to sync your unit in Itunes and working with phots on your unit is not easy if you sync folders with your pc then you cn not delete any photos from your ipad. You can also not really take notes on your ipad unless you can type really fast on the touch keyboard handwritting notes has a very long way to go on the ipad.And again we are back to my pet peve WHY IS THERE NO VIDEO PLAYLIST ON THE SYSTEM. Before the update there was a work around but now that is gone you like watching music videos you get to listen to them one at a time. If you read any of my other reviews of products like this you will know I hate when a simple function is left out like this.So yes even with these short commings I love my Ipad and no I am not sorry It does not have a camera on it I have a phone that has a camera.

Use it for what it's intended for and get over it.Lack of Flash can be annoying, but that shortcoming wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I don't miss it.I own a netbook. It's been sitting on my desk for months, unused. Video stutters, internet is difficult to use, audio is terrible, battery life is weak.  And that's after upgrading to 2gb of memory.In other word, it's not better than my iPad and I'm selling it.The biggest plus of my iPad is convenience.  It's always on and ready.  I rarely use my computers anymore.So, if you do some due diligence and actually find out what an iPad does, you should be able to make an educated decision on whether it's for you or not.I don't believe a windows based tablet can come close to functioning as nicely as an iPad. An Android tablet might.I don't think I'm the only one happy with these, close to 1 million have been sold.  And that's before the 3G models have hit the shelves or sales outside the US have started.Ya, Steve Jobs really messed up with the iPad.

I love my Ipad and yet, I'm still not totally sure what it is. Is it a laptop? Is it a pc? Is it a phone without being a phone?I still don't really know, but I do love it. It's not too heavy, it has decent graphics, it has a great charge time. I can only speak to what I use it for and that's gaming, movies, reading and writing:First, writing. I have written several books on my laptop, which always got super-hot because that's how they are. The iPad NEVER gets hot, so great! I do hate virtual keyboards though, so I got a Rockfish case/keyboard to go with my Ipad and if you write, check out my review on it. Having that case/keyboard has really brought my iPad use full-circle. I love it.As for movies, my review on that part is mixed. My favorite app ever would be Netflix. I pay about 10 a month for their dvd / online membership. When I try to watch Netflix movies on my Ipad, sometimes I get stalled movies a little, sometimes a lot, but I do get stalled every single movie I watch.I also love to watch ABC, which is a free app. I LOVE IT. I can watch my Cougar Town and even my soap if it were worth watching ;0)Also, I play games. So does my son. There are THOUSANDS of free games (apps) and I love them on the Ipad. I have poor eyesight and it's so much easier to see them on the Ipad than on Ipod etc. We love Skeeball and Angry Birds, and lots of others. The fact that there are sooo many free apps makes it worth the Ipad price alone, I think.Lastly, reading. I have mixed feelings on this. I love reading without a book, something I never ever thought I'd say. I love the feel of a book! But now, a book feels archaic. Old. Out of style. I love reading on my Ipad. The only thing I do not love, is that other readers like Nook etc have that INK setting where it looks just like a real book. The backlight on the Ipad sometimes gets hard on the eyes, so it's really a love/hate thing for me.I hope this review helps some folks decide if they want to get an Ipad or the 2.

So far no issues regarding the item, its use or convienience. Not sure what MaxP. below was expecting when he slammed this product. If he wanted the features of a PC, maybe he should have gone that route instead of assuming they would be similar in an iPad. Research is the key with purchasing any electronic device in today's tech crazed world. Anyway, my problem is regarding the warranty. I bought the product in November 2010 as a Christmas gift for my son. The iPad arrived quickly and when my son opened it on Christmas morning he was overjoyed. It performed (and still does) as advertised. Now the issue: when my son attempted to register the item through Apple, he was unable to do so because the serial number did not match the date that I purchased it. After speaking to Amazon's customer service and Apple, it was determined that the purchase date in Apple's system for that serial number was actually 46 days prior. It seems that the vendor (GO4COMPUTERS) actually \"purchased\" the item on the date as shown in Apple's database. So THAT is the actual date that the warranty began, NOT the date that I purchased it. So effectively I have lost 1.5 months of a 1 yr warranty! I do not suspect that there is any intent to deceive by the vendor, but they were unable (unwilling?) to do anything about it. Apple will not change the date nor will Amazon. In summary, although I rate the product itself at 5 stars, I feel that some \"shine\" has been rubbed off this Apple product purchase due to the warranty issue.

I expected to use it mostly for movies, pictures and email, but I have had it for a 3 weeks and am using it all the time.  I also have an iPhone and some have call the iPad a glorified iPhone.  In some ways it is, but it does much more, although it still can't make calls.  I find it easier to use, and of course easier to see, than my iPhone.  I downloaded an application that allows me to view and edit Microsoft Office Exel and Word which now has made my old computer start to collect dust.Yes, there are some websites I can't view completely due to not having Flash but so far, it's been a minimal issue.  The iPad is easy to turn on and off and to set the airplane mode when flying.  I bought a few extras to go with my iPad, such as a case with an adjustable stand and a bluetooth keyboard.  Both are necessities to me.  And of course the apps are plentiful and useful.  My only caution about the \"free\" apps is that many aren't really free.  They might be a 30 day free trial or you need to upgrade (for a fee) to make them work best.  They often don't tell you that in advance, or at least I didn't read far enough in the description.  I did download a hidden object game and really like how easy it is to enlarge the picture on the screen. I haven't uploaded my iPod yet, but it will be nice to have my music on my iPad when I'm traveling. I can also download books from the Kindle onto the iPad which will save me from carrying another device.Overall, the iPad is getting used much more than my laptop computer.  I just got back from a 3 day camping trip, and the only electronics I brought was my iPad.  I have the $25/month plan from AT&T; so I can either use the AT&T; 3G or any public wireless to connect.

It is the perfect device for the consumption of content. (I don't read books outside in open sunlight.) I am happy now to store tons of magazines and books, without the requisite piles of paper in my home, and the ability to take those books and magazines with me. I love to watch movies via the Netflix app and TV programs via the ABC app, in addition to iTunes rentals and purchases. (I tried the Hulu Plus app but the Hulu library for the iPad app differed from the library available if you watch on your computer. That was unacceptable for me.) As a graphic artist and photographer, the iPad is a perfect device to display images/designs to clients and some photographers are able to wirelessly transmit images directly from the camera to the iPad, allowing clients to view images as they are being taken. Amazing.I have not had the wifi or syncing problems cited in other reviews and I have owned both a wifi version and a 3G iPad. (I prefer the 3G device for its hardware GPS. The wifi version is able to give you your approximate location but \"close enough\" was not satisfactory for my usage. If you're traveling and need the GPS function in say, a moving car, you'll need the 3G data plan unless your car is equipped with wifi, which is unlikely.) Some complain about the lack of an SD card slot but I have no problem with the optional Camera Connection Kit, which provides both a plug-in SD card reader as well as an USB port (which can be used with your own USB card reader or even USB headphones or mics).While I use the onscreen keyboard when necessary, I prefer to use the Apple bluetooth wireless keyboard. I do not miss Flash on websites. (I usually click through flash intros anyway.) I don't miss the lack of a camera because, as a photographer, I've never been happy with the results of a camera with the optics/resolution limits required to install it on a phone/mobile device. I find the device's attempts to correct my spelling annoying (if I don't watch, it will change both my first and last names). And while the iPad response is snappy, no multitasking or ability to run programs in the background made using the device just a bit inelegant, having to always end one app to start another.The lack of multitasking changes with iOS 4.2. While not yet available to the general public (it is slated for release this month), I couldn't wait and installed the Golden Master release (almost ready for prime time) and it has transformed my device into something more along the line of \"magical.\" Switching back and forth between open apps speeds up the process completely. A double-press on the iPad's home button reveals the multitasking menu, screen orientation lock, screen brightness and volume sliders and play/pause controls. While I don't have a new AppleTV, I can send audio items to my Airport Express with speakers attached through AirPlay. I have not been able to preview AirPrint (where you'll be able to send iPad documents to some printers) as it requires a Snow Leopard update for my desktop computer that is not yet released. In the meantime, I had no problem emailing items I wanted printed to a computer but look forward to seeing if AirPrint will have the same effect on printing what AirPlay has on streaming content.While other tablets can claim to be more capable (a Windows tablet can run full-fledged Windows applications and this able to do many more things) none will be able to compete with the elegant interface and ease of use that the iPad presents. Apple's iOS is designed for mobile devices, taking full advantage of the Apple multi-touch interface, making the iPad the most intuitive tablet you'll ever find. If you're interested in video chatting (and using Apple's Facetime), I would wait until iPad 2.0, which will likely be announced in the first quarter of 2011. For myself, I'll leave the video chatting to my phone or laptop. The iPad is perfect for my use as is.Printing, which also comes with iOS 4.2, is still not available to me to preview as it requires a pre-release Snow Leopard update to my laptop computer. While it poses no problem for me once the SL update is released, I might be upset if I found out, after the fact, that in order to get the full function of the iPad, I need the newest Mac OS release.

Students can, for a relatively small fee, have a research tool in their hands.This gem lets students research the worlds online literature, create an e-book shelf with the obvious access to volumes of books within each of their shelves, and create reports from these sources (can attach a keyboard), and present findings to the class via projector or world via the internet. It feels like a self containing research unit.

Other in this form have also listed more technical disadvantages - so be sure to roam these.

Unless you really love touch screens.  The touch screen is about the only thing the ipad really does well.  Apple built its reputation on making great operating systems that were far and away the most user friendly in the business.  No hassle computing.  And true to this spirit, the ipads touchscreen really does open up a whole new world of possibilities to make operating systems even more user friendly.  Apple has done great job of highlighting this potential in the ipad.Unfortunately, what the touch screen has given it, apple's new-found shortsightedness has taken away.  This is not a machine for surfing the web and if you buy one, mainly with that purpose in mind, you will be quite disappointed.  The main reason is the ipad will not run flash player- A technology that is ubiquitous on the web, and something that apple has intentionlly decided not to support.  This means a good portion of web pages that you are used to running flawlessly (on windows and apple OSX) on browsers like Firefox, Chrome, IE, or Safari will simply crash Safari for the ipad.  So if you buy this machine, you won't really get the world-wide-web, you'll get the apple-wide-web. Steve Jobs has commented how flash will (eventually) become unnecessary with HTML 5 and that's why they don't support flash.  Well, maybe...I think it's appropriate to quote John Maynard Keynes here.  Apple, \"in the long run, we are all dead,\" and would love to surf the real web on a great tablet today!Unfortunately, this approach to Flash is sticking with the spirit of the machine in general.  Consider you can only get Apple approved apps at the Apple appstore (unless you want to hack the machine and jailbreak it).  With this machine you ultimately are pushed content that Apple has chosen, rather than given the ability to find the content yourself in an unencumbered access to the jungle of the web.It really sad to see Apple go down this road.  I grew up on Apples and have always paid the extra money for that, oh so friendly, user experience.  It's too bad that a company started by \"two guys in their garage\" with a vision of great computing has turned into a corporation with a vision of higher returns to the shareholders.  The world would be a better place if Apple just stuck to making the best operating systems in the world and forgot about the whole business of trying to own as much of the world wide web as you can stake your claim on.", "Title": "Don't buy an ipad.... unless", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Author": "Jeffery A. Lewis", "ReviewID": "RURUJRCFKGUA8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There has been a lot of hype about iPad being a Kindle killer. There are three reasons why the iPad will not make a good book reader. You should be aware of these reasons if you are buying the iPad expecting to read books on it.Reason 1) You will want to read outside and the iPad will not look good outside. Lets face it. Readings a novel is relaxing. Reading outside on a beatiful day is really relaxing. An ebook has to address reading outside. iPad has an LCD screen which will wash out in sunlight. Devices like Kindle and Sony Reader use e-ink technology, a completely different rendering technology, that actually looks better in daylight.Reason 2) iPad is too heavy. The iPad weighs 1.6 pounds. That's about 26 ounces. A Sony Reader and Kindle weigh about 9 to 10 ounces. The iPad weighs almost three times as much. You should be able to hold an ebook with one hand suspended in the air. This will maximize the number of comfortable positions you can achieve with the device. At 1.6 pounds, you will find you cannot hold it up for long with one hand and will have to rest it on something. This severly limits the ergonomic possibilities for the device. You may think this is not important, but you should not overlook how important this is for the reading experience. As matters go, the iPad is not a good device to watch a two hour movie on. Since it is heavy, you will tend to rest it on your lap. That will force you to look down on it. Two hours of doing that, your neck will be sore.Reason 3) Battery life is too short. Ten hours seems like a long time, but for an ebook, it is a hassle to keep it charged to just read, especially when you are on the go. When you toss a small 10 ounce Kindle in your suit case before leaving for a week vacation, you will not have to take the charger, and you will not have to be concerned about plugging it in at the hotel. Devices that use e-ink use power to render the page and to say on standby, but do not use power to leave the page displayed. E-ink devices essentially sip power compared to LCD technology that has to constantly backlight the screen and constantly render the screen. This takes much more power.In iPads defence, iPad could be the better device to read a newspaper. You generally don't read the paper for very long, and you don't read a newspaper linearly like a book. Beautiful layout, color, and multi-touch input could lead to a better newspaper experience. Plus a newspaper is updated daily. An easy way to get daily editions is essential to reading a paper.

My evaluation?  An outstanding device.  I use it in three principle areas; a book reader, entertainment i.e. games and for work.  I'll talk about each in turn.As a book reader.  Very easy to use and easy to read. I downloaded the Kindle and Barnes and Noble apps so I have access to three separate bookstores and can download books from all of them.  The Ipad thus is much more flexible than dedicated readers that allow access to only a single bookstore.As a game machine.  If my grandkids are around, I can't use my Ipad because they are queued up to get a turn.  I have apps that the three-year-old can use, the four-year-old can use and other apps the older ones can use.  The amazing thing about the younger ones, is that the apps are educational and they love use them.  I enjoy the apps the older kids use, namely Doodle Jump, Angry Birds and Plants vs ZombiesFor work.  This is where the Ipad really shines.  I'm an author.  I spend hours each day chained to my computer in my office writing stores or revising them.In addition to writing/ revising stories, there are other business aspects of writing.  A brief list includes creating new characters and plots, writing blogs, marketing work, email responses etc.  In the past I had to stay at the computer or use a pad and pen if I worked away from the computer. Now I use the Ipad and I'm freed from the desk and computer.  It makes writing and creation a pleasure.  I'm writing this review while sitting in a recliner in the TV room.  Earlier, I worked on a different writing project outside on the porch.Overall, I have to say that the Ipad changed my work habits and improved them.  It fitted  almost seamlessly into my work.  How seamlessly, is amazing, but then I'm an Apple fanatic and I expected nothing less from the Ipad.  To be clear, the Ipad doesn't replace my computer; it is an adjunct to that computer, but one that gives me a large measure of freedom.As you might suspect, I give the Ipad five stars out of a possible five.

S. Alsuhaim", "ReviewID": "R3RZV8USNZGSFW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got a chance to hold and play with the iPad that one of my student brought to me. I am not an apple fanboy, I just evaluate gadgets and buy what works for me. My first impression when it was announced is that it would be nothing but an iPod touch on steroids. After evaluating the iPad and playing with it for an hour, I still have that impression. The iPad has an upgraded processor and memory. It is faster, it has a good battery life. For the one hour I used it, I only lost about 5% of battery. It does not feel awfully big or heavy, but it is not something you carry in your pockets.At $499 for the 16GB/Wifi, there is a great potential offered by the bigger display of the iPad when compared to Touch screen netbook. Please note that 16GB on this iPad are solid state with no moving parts.The only reason why I would buy or recommend such a product is to use it to take notes during classes for students. If you can get a stylus and proper software to take notes, the iPad would really shine at a great value. I would recommend the cheapest iPad if you are on a budget.The screen is clear, and feels nice to browse the web. I reviewed the 64GB/Wifi model and I picked up a decent wireless signal while I was in the university's lab, which was placed in a basement. I heard complaint about signal quality.The virtual keyboard passes with A+. I tried to use it like a normal keyboard and I typed a couple of random sentences with no errors. It sure won't feel like a normal physical keyboard, but I think it is possible to hook wireless keyboard to it (which beats the purpose of getting the iPad)PROS* Virtual keyboard is very usable with minimal mistakes.* There is a great potential of the bigger screen. The possibilities are endless: Drawing, sketching, note taking. I actually I got to impress my student with a quick anime-style drawing.* It is not only a toy. You can use it for education. Children can learn in a fun way, and also adults may use it for note taking. Provided that apps would be available for those purposes.* Battery life is great. I read reviews saying that it even exceeded Apple's expectation.* More apps and things to do than Amazon's kindleCONS* The lack of a camera on the front really cripple the potential of the iPad (and the iPhone, iPod touch as well). You can not make video chat session using an iPad (nor iPhone or iPod Touch). Imagine if you can make Skype calls using the iPad!* Connectivity with other devices requires iPad dock.* I only use this for an hour, but I believe using it for too long will strain one's hand. One could consider using it on a table instead of holding it with one hand.FINAL THOUGHTSI advise people to only buy this if they think they will make a good use of it. Please keep in mind that you are buying a tablet computer. I wouldn't buy it in a heartbeat. I would still keep evaluating its uses that best serve me.", "Title": "Feels better when you hold it in your hand", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Author": "Matt Goodwin", "ReviewID": "R1PW9XV8SCNWCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Who doesn't love a tablet, especially an ipad.

I was familiar with most of the features because I have the Ipod Touch and iPhone 3G. With the Ipad you get the best internet experience on any mobile device period. Of course what would the Ipad be without the actual Ipod which plays music, video, and podcasts. You get wifi but I recommend spending a little more for the iPad 3G which means you can use your iPad anywhere besides wifi spots courtesy of At&t.; The price of their data plans for the ipad are very affordable when compared to most other data services. The 3G models have GPS for location-based services, which means you get more accurate directions than the wifi only version. The App Store turns your Ipad in to a entertainment powerhouse. With the app store you can add apps that fit your needs. From games to business you're bound to find something that you will like. You get an amazing book reader with the ibook store, and if you download the amazon kindle app you get another great ebook reader app with many more books to choose from. It is still kind of bizarre to think I can watch a movie, listen to music, surf the internet, play games, read a book, write and read email, get GPS directions, watch you tube videos, check the weather, and even use the iPad as a phone over wifi with the Skype app. My favorite iPad apps are Netflix, abc player, pandora, Amazon kindle app, shazam and a few others. The apple iPad 3g is truly magical and is light years ahead of the competition with its ease of use and versatility. Sure there are things that can be improved (add a camera, add more internal memory and support adobe flash), but that's with anything. When apple finally releases it's update for iPad this fall which will include the ability to multitask (among many other cool features) it will bring a whole new functionality in to the iPad. I cant wait to be able to listen to pandora in the background while i surf the net or read a book.Like it or not the iPad is a revolution and created a whole new device category and will do for tablets what the ipod and iphone did for mp3 players and cell phones.", "Title": "iPad will make your life easier and keep you entertained non stop,", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Author": "Gary", "ReviewID": "R2WSTBCEB7A6QX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My review is based upon the iPad wifi, 32 gb. I have had it about 11 months.If I had to sum up the iPad in two words it would be \"needlessly disappointing\".  On the surface, it has everything except removable storage. It is fast, can surf the web (sort of), plays video and music, and has apps out the wazoo.  However, it has MAJOR limitations including the lack of removable storage, no real file management system (I don't count syncing video, music and pictures through iTunes as file management), and the much lamented lack of Flash support.I had hoped to be able to use the iPad for work. I am an attorney and wanted something very portable, but big enough to read, that I could use to transport PDFs and other case documents. Apple says \"there's an app for that.\" I tried several including MobileMe, HD Air, and Goodreader. They will allow you to move files to the iPad and view them, but moving multiple files is dicey and takes an inordinately long period of time. The bottom line is that as a substitute for a laptop, the iPad is not ready for prime time.I am not a computer programmer or a web programer so I dont know the technical merits of Flash over HTML 5. What I do know is that about every other web page I have viewed has Flash content that can't be viewed on the iPad. Because Steve Jobs and Adobe are feuding, this does not appear likely to resolve any time soon.  This is a big time deal breaker for me. I don't like the \"there's an app for that\" solution -- who wants to have to jump back and forth between a half-dozen apps and Safari (the Apple web browser) to do what you should be able to do on just a browser?Another major drawback is the very limited print functionality. Don't buy the hype. AirPrint works with only a small number of HP printers. If you don't own one of these expensive printers, forget printing.The aforementioned problems could be fixed with software, but Apple refuses despite customer complaints. In fact, they have raised customer disrespect to an art form by releasing the iPad 2 with the same limitations.On the pro side it has all the features you would expect of an Apple device. It has a great music player. Videos are superb and with an optional av cable, the iPad can output movies to an HD TV.  I am not a fan of iBook, but the Kindle app is great. In fact, I prefer reading books on the iPad over the Kindle 3 (I like back lighting).My recommendation on this product (and also the iPad 2) is don't buy it unless you can live with the limitations I have noted. The Motorola Xoom has better hardware and purportedly will support Flash in the future. It is more expensive, but might be worth the wait.", "Title": "Could have been great", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Author": "Nelson2013", "ReviewID": "R1ATW9RR68F454", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this as a gift and I am very grateful and happy for the thoughtfullness of my boss.Video and photo displays are great.

I thought it would be good for traveling and it was an interesting toy.  I got to take it on a trip to Vancouver in August.  It worked out great.  I got Zinio so I could get a bunch of magazines to read on the plane.  The screen is good (would have said very good before the iPhone 4 came out) for reading and the magazines came out sharp.  Watching a movie on the plane with an iPad is great.  The large screen and the smallness of the iPad overall make it easy to leave on the tray.  The trip was adhoc and we had a rented car to drive around the area.  I had TomTom for navigation but it didn't seem to work on the iPad.  Luckily I had TomTom on my iPhone.  I don't know if it is something wrong with the iPad or the software.  I had a hotel for the first two days of our trip.  After that it was always easy to get on wifi at the hotels we stayed at.  I got data roaming for the trip.  Had no problem using Roger's network in Canada.  The iPad makes it easy to change travelling plans.  For instance I hiked along a river to see a fall when a jet boat went by running the rapids.  Looked like fun and after thinking more about it looked it up at a park bench.  We found the company running the boat and took it the next day.  We went to Victoria and it was nice even waiting for the ferry to look up what we should have done before waiting for an hour for the ride.  Wifi and cellular were great in Canada.  Flash was an issue for only one site and that was for WestJet checkin the night before leaving.  I thought luckily the hotel had a internet kiosk but it was running Linux and Flash wasn't running on it.  At the airport I literally saw some display for the flight times running Flash displaying errors.  I cracked up.  WestJet did end up being easy to get around.  They actually have a mobile site and you can check in there without Flash.  I did that though on my iPhone.  Don't know if I could have gotten to it with the iPad.  I didn't try.  1Password with Dropbox is a great combination to keep passwords around so that you can check things on your trip.  I take a ferry to work every day.  I use iAnnotate to read pdf documentation after checking out the WSJ.  I use it every day during the week.

If you download movies to watch at a later time you will need wireless again to sign in to watch. I got the iPad in March specifically to watch movies on the train. I downloaded 3 to watch. I was all comfy ready to watch one and it wanted a password. Well, the train doesn't have wireless so no movie(no stations have it either...believe me, my husband and I tried). So if you are planning on downloading your movies to watch later somewhere without wireless it will not play. I find the whole thing ridiculous, that you need 5 seconds of wireless to sign in again just to play them, but have been told \"sorry, that's just how it works\". I have had the iPad2 now for 3 months and tried again on Thursday but let the movie play a few minutes and then hit pause thinking that was all I needed to do. Went somewhere without wireless and sure enough they wanted me to sign in again to play it. Another 4.00 down the drain. Now iTunes won't return the money I have wasted on trying to get movies to play and Apple won't take the iPad back. So I am stuck with a 500.00 item I can't use and 40.00 in movies I never got to watch or had to cram in a short period. Once you start a movie it is gone in 24 hours so if you start it and plan to continue later in the day but can't find wireless it will drop off. Also, be aware that iTunes has no phone customer service so if you ever have any troubles you have to write them and then wait 24 hours(as your movie disappears) for a reply. The reply I got was to go to two links which had nothing to help me. I have an iMac, iPod and iPhone so really didn't need an iPad except for movies. Guess I will try and sell it on eBay. You know what Apple told me to do? Get a 3G network....haha. I already pay over 200.00 a month  for the two iPhones in our home. I don't want to spend all that money just to watch movies. I think Apple has lost this longtime customer over how this was all handled. I realized today that it is all about money and they don't care about customer service or loyalty.

In the store, it seemed so sleek and sexy that I didn't pay attention to its major downfall.  Namely its sleek and sexy without substance.  While you get 10 hours of battery life, you are stuck with the battery because it can not be replaced.  What happens in a year or two when it only gets 8 hours of life and then less and less.  Essentially you get a giant ipod touch that can not be taken apart, upgraded, or have any other modification done to it (not really a computer in my book).  No peripherals such as a USB input or any other way of connecting to anything other than another computer (which by the way you will need to sync or even start the thing initially) unless you want to fork over more money.  At first, the on screen keyboard was OK but progressively, I realized that it was next to impossible to write even moderate sized emails in any span of time consistent with a modern lifestyle.  Nor can you do any sort of actual work on the thing: no multitasking and when I attempted to work on a couple of google docs it toke me forever to make even small changes.  Some counter that you can just get the additional keyboard dock but that's another $80 and isn't practical for everybody to carry around.  While I very much enjoyed web browsing in the touch screen format, I must admit that it was a different web.  Without Flash support, many of the sites I normally visited were not the same.Now for the good parts: it is really fun to use for media consumption, playing games, reading (inside not outside), and it makes people jealous that you own it.  Also, the app store are releasing many really innovative apps for the iPad.  After a week, these pluses were not enough to outweigh all the minuses above and I returned it.

I like my Ipad. Interfact is very similar to the Itouch. The screen is HUGE, it's faster, the audio is much crispier and louder, a bit heavy but all in all, it's a very solid product. A lot of people say it's a big version of Itouch. In a way, I would say yes but performace wise, it's way way different. There's that sense of speed and stability that goes with the Ipad.

It is nice for recreation, but that's about it. It in no way can replace a laptop or desktop. Also, as many people have mentioned, it really is just a larger version of the iPod Touch. I really expected more from this device, but what I got was less than I thought would be mandatory. There's a video editor for the iPad, but there's no camera? And then you have to be near a public wi-fi to surf the internet unless you want to shell out an extra couple hundred dollars for the 3G edition which you have to buy a 3G plan to use which means even more money.If all this wasn't bad enough, the iPad pretty much lost most of its portability. Sure it can fit in your backpack better than a laptop and can fit in a manila envolope (not sure why you'd want to put it in a manila folder, but you can), but if you don't have a backpack it's kind of a pain to lug it around. You can't put it in normal pockets and it's awkward to just hold all of the time. It can be used for all of your media, which is a plus, but why would you want it too? You might as well just get an iPhone (not an iPhone 4 though since they're still having issues with that, but that's for another review).I'm sure that there will be plenty of people who will love this device since it is an Apple product and it does have a few traditional dazzling Apple features, but I think that this device is a waste of money and you should only buy it if you have absolutely no need for several hundred dollars. If you buy this to replace an MP3 player or a laptop, then you're in for a sad surprise. Who knows though? Maybe I expected too much with thinking that the iPad would be technologically on par with other modern electronics and that Apple would have some better way of carrying it that a cheesy pouch or in a backpack. If my review were based on any of these I'd give one star, but the iPad does a good job with its interface and it still has the large app database that Apple fans love so I gave it one more star. I know Apple can do better and chances are that the iPad will probably be another Apple series where they make very small changes in between each product and make a fortune. The next iPad will probably have a camera, but won't shoot video.

But they did not give any clue whatsoever of the new product, neither did the retailers like Amazon, that surely knew what was happenning.

I posted my review on ASUS netbook when it was out at $399, saying it worth $199. That is the price of it in 6 months. For iPad, the cost to produce is about $250. So $350 should be a reasonable price. Note that you have to pay for wireless providers. It is not even close to a laptop, for sure. Will I get one? Probably, but not at this price. Oh, I am sure Apple's CEO is happy that you pay for his dinner. He did a really good job, though. I actually likes a color digital device to read magazines/books, but not that small.
