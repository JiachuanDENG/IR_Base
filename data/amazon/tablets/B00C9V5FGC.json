I got this to make my life as mobile as possible and cut down on the insane amount of paper that I use.Frankly, there are no capacitive stylus that can equal Wacom digital stylus technology. I agree that the price is way steeper than the Nexus 7, but remember that the Nexus 7 is subsidized by Google. Compared to the Ipad mini, which sells for about $70 less, this tablet is way worth the money. Never mind the specs being better on this than the Ipad mini. I am talking about the cost of getting a Wacom digital pen and tablet for the price of $70.With this I am able to use Epic effortlessly. I can take notes as I talk to patients, take handwritten notes when I am in class, sync it to every cloud service you can think of, record lectures as I take the notes and play it back, convert handwritten notes to typed notes (need to have good handwriting) etc etc.Really, the S pen has sooo many uses. The ability to take a screenshot and edit it on the fly is something I use nearly everyday. This tablet may not completely please artists but for everyone else, there is no equal.As for build and design, I have no problems with Samsung's plastic build. Nearly everyone throws on a case for their tablets (or phones) now a days. You DON'T even feel the plastic back that everyone whines about. Glass back breaks. Aluminum or polycarbonate backs glaringly highlights every scratch or defect. All adds to the weight. Plastic backs hides scratches and as I said, when you put a case on, you never even touch the plastic back again.Battery life lasts me the whole day. On average I get about 15 hours with about 3-4 hours of on screen time before I get down to about 20%. Probably could be better battery life, but since it lasts me the whole day without needing to find a charger, I am ok with it.Still runs 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. I hope they upgrade it soon, but no rumors as to when.Conclusion: Buy this tablet if you have any interest in replacing paper in your daily life.", "Title": "I have replaced paper!", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RKPF921YAUHAF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am currently in pharmacy school and this tablet has made taking notes a breeze. Most of our teachers post their powerpoint slides as a pdf file. I use an app called EZ PDF Reader on this tablet to annotate them during class. The pen is so precise and lets me take notes as well as if I were taking them on paper. It also makes it easy to always have access to my notes as I upload them to dropbox. If I don't have a pdf to take notes on, I have found an app called Papyrus that mimics lined paper perfectly.I debated between the 8 inch and 10 inch versions of the Note not knowing if the 8 inch was going to be large enough to take effective notes. With the high resolution screen and the precision of the s-pen though it has worked well.The tablet is also fast. It has been able to handle everything I have thrown at it from multitasking, to intense graphics games, to streaming video. I also love the fact that I can have two apps open side by side (a feature that is currently only available on the Note series from what I understand)! I've used this feature to have something like a website open on one side while I take notes on the other.In short, I highly recommend this tablet to students who would like to ditch taking paper notes to save space and have ready access to their notes at any time!", "Title": "Great for School", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Author": "Oauzzie Youtube", "ReviewID": "RUO6GNJM4CL8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's absolutely a great product. It will set the example for future technology to come.The productivity on this is incredible. I use it for note taking. The cameras just suck. Pretty soon there will be tablets just like this with S-Pens, HD screen resolution, 8 megapixel and 3 megapixel cameras, and probably some 3D features. The screen resolution on this is absolutely great and handwriting is very natural, though. Ignore the complaints.Trying it first at Best Buy is what I recommend. I decided to buy from Best Buy, & no Play Store credit was included as promotion from Amazon might suggest, but I still got the DropBox credit and around 5 dollar in store credit with new BB card).I Highly recommend the MoKo Slim Cover Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 inch GT - N5100 Android Tablet, Black (with lip Stand, Integrated Elastic Hand Strap, and Stylus Loop(Payed $5.99 and it's definitely a 5 star product!)Hope I helped :)", "Title": "Good.

It\u2019s a bloated and unnecessary launcher. While Samsung has toned down some of the Fischer-Price \u201cmy first tablet\u201d icons a bit, I still don\u2019t like manufacturer launchers of any kind\u2026 nor do most users. Optimize the standard Android OS for your hardware, allow for direct updates and let the user tailor their experience to their liking!!! HINT: That\u2019s why people buy Android.I\u2019ve installed Nova Launcher Prime because it\u2019s fast, highly customizable, can use most icon packs from ADW and Go (if you\u2019re into that sort of thing) and allows me to run my entire tablet from a single home screen and well-organized app drawer.[...]S-Voice is a problem. It\u2019s not SIRI. It\u2019s not Vlingo. It\u2019s not Google Now. It\u2019s not as integrated as Samsung thinks and it\u2019s not good. The solution is simple as all you have to do is use Google Now. While S-Voice does plug in to the Samsung apps very well, the problem is that the Samsung apps aren\u2019t as good as what they\u2019re designed to replace.The words of Jesse Pinkman allude to a serious problem: \u201cMAGNETS, BITCHES!\u201d Often found in \u201csmart covers\u201d that automatically wake up your tablet, they automatically destroy the GN8\u2019s magnetically-driven hardware that allow the S-Pen to work so well. They create dead-spots in the screen.The solutions are many: find a cover that uses weak magnets, which is to say: spend the extra money on the OEM cover; for the same price as the OEM cover, purchase the protection overkill of the Otterbox Defender case made for the GN8; hunt for a case that doesn\u2019t use magnets and still offers good protection.THE MEDIOCRE:The price is another problem: at $399, it\u2019s pretty steep for a small tablet not running iOS or Windows 8RT, both of which are much more integrated into the professional environment the GN8 is designed to serve. While the S-Pen is incredible, and its integration makes it a steal when compared to the thousand dollars you have to shell out for a Surface Pro, most people aren\u2019t the kind of users that will actually get a value-added experience with it. My suggestion is to go with the N7.2\u2026 or Galaxy 3 Tab 8.0\u201d, which still comes with great perks and allows you to control your TV (more on this later).Granted, the GN8 comes with a ton of perks as long as you buy it by 30 September 2013 [...] and it is on sale at Staples for $329.99 (at least it was when I wrote this review).There is also another price work-around to be considered: buying refurbished. At $299.99, you get all the perks of the special promotion and you don\u2019t have to pay sales tax (it\u2019s used). By the time I factored in all the tax savings and perks, I paid a bit less for a GN8 than I would have for the only other affordable tablet that could meet my needs: the second-generation Asus Nexus 7 (N7.2).This isn\u2019t your typical \u201cused car\u201d version of a refurbished item. The packaging is complete, the device looks great and honestly\u2026 in my experience, the failure rate for factory-refurbished equipment has been lower than that of new equipment.Not to mention it\u2019s better for the environment AND the domestic economy when you consider Samsung does their refurbishing right here in the United States.You get a decent 90-day warranty you can extend if you want to. I root every Android device I buy, which voids most warranties, so this isn\u2019t a major concern for me: you pay your pennies and you take your chances.By the time everything was tallied up, I purchased a refurbished GN8, spare chargers (both for a car and AC wall charging), an OTG micro USB to USB adapter (more on that later), a folding Bluetooth keyboard, a case and ChromeCast for only $15 more than I would have paid for the GN8 alone, with California sales tax at my local Staples.In-Depth: The 96hr ImmersionThe last four days have seen my experience evolve from fascination to ham-fisted frustration to my girlfriend literally being pulling me away from the tablet by my ear because of blood-blasted (\u201cblood-shot doesn\u2019t begin to describe it) eyes to now, at this present time, actually feeling an emotional connection similar to the one I feel with my lovely and well-trained dogs.Samsung has come a long way with their packaging over the last decade, coming close to the unboxing experience Apple products have soiled the electronics market with. I know that the \u201crecycled\u201d materials a bit of propaganda, but I like the message the propaganda sends.The first thing I noticed is that the GN8 feels as good in the hand as it looks in the box. It really is a beautiful device, taking full advantage of the slick design that has made Samsung\u2019s Galaxy line so successful. It is much lighter than the solid feeling tells the sense of touch it should be and is a very high-quality product when it comes to materials and finish. However, the back is a little too slick to use without having anxiety over dropping it, but a person that uses a tablet without a case probably has advanced-stage syphilis as well\u2026 and aren\u2019t worth knowing.I\u2019ve read some reviews that have attacked the use of polycarbonate for the body, saying it feels cheap. There are no signs of poor build quality in this tablet. The same can be said for the GN8\u2019s most significant competitor: the N7.2. Both feel solid without feeling chunky.As far as durability is concerned, it should be noted that polycarbonate is used in things like safety glasses and bullet-proof windows for a reason: it\u2019s strong and can take a beating. Metal is cool and feels good, but it also dents and arcs, destroying delicate electronics. The GN8 is also built with the second generation of Corning\u2019s Gorilla Glass, so durability of the device itself should be excellent.The same can\u2019t be said for the metal foil laminate of the bezel around the GN8s camera in back, which is already starting to chip a bit from setting it on my desk when charging. Samsung should have used the same material they did around the perimeter of the GN8\u2019s shell.When combined with a portable Bluetooth keyboard (a must if you\u2019re serious about getting the most out of your tablet purchase), the entire package comes in at roughly a pound.This has been a blessing, because my typical load for a day in the field includes the following: a DSLR with two lenses, assorted filters, an extra battery and USB, HDMI and component cables; a prosumer point and shoot with an extra battery; a stereo microphone with pop filter and table-top tripod, USB cable; a portable solar panel; eight rechargeable AA batteries (to run my mic, mobile phone, flashlights, a portable scanner, the GN8 should it actually run out of power, and a STERIpen water purifier- sometimes when I write that I \u201cwork in the field,\u201d I\u2019m being literal); assorted equipment to clean and maintain my camera equipment; pens, markers, highlighters and a notepad; a simple grooming and first/last aid kit (it\u2019s important to make sure fingernails and calluses are taken care of when meeting clients); a waiter\u2019s wine opener, Chapstick, gum (because it\u2019s important to be able to celebrate a new acquaintance whenever you meet her); condoms (because I\u2019m an optimist); a cigarette lighter (for what comes after the bottle of wine); a flashlight; a head light; the aforementioned scanner and water purifier; my glasses; cables and power adapters for my phone and GN8; Bluetooth headsets; a Kobo Glo with a few hundred books on it (nothing will ever replace e-ink); a pair of gloves; a small knife; a pair of gloves; a small tripod; two liters of water; and before getting the GN8: a bit seven pound laptop, 1.5 pound spare battery and a one-pound charging brick\u2026 all packed into a strained assembly of water-resistant fabric that is considered a \u201cpersonal carry-on item\u201d!Most of this equipment is used at least two or three times a week (even the water purifier when I\u2019m hiking or don\u2019t trust the tap water), and I only want to eat, shower and dress in the morning, so doing a different load-out every day is impractical.What I\u2019ve found over the last week is that I can do about 95% of what I need to do, when I need to do it, with the GN8\u2026 and it has taken my typical load-out from a shoulder and back abusing 28 pounds to a \u201c comfortably feather-weight\u201d 17.5!RELEVANT LUGGAGE TANGENT: While a backpack would carry my daily load more comfortably, satchels are mandatory for quickly accessing photography gear. Also, the FAA lists backpacks as \u201cluggage,\u201d whereas a satchel, as long as it fits within the maximum allowable size, is considered a personal item akin to a purse or briefcase regardless how much it weighs.The display, which is slightly larger (by the ruler) than the N7.2\u2019s, is wonderful once it\u2019s been optimized for text and reading. Understand that it is a two-step process to make the GN8\u2019s screen really earn its praise. First, turn on \u201creading mode\u201d in the drop-down settings menu. Then, go into device settings under the display submenu and check the box that optimizes the display for text. It makes reading mode an enjoyable experience rather than a gimmick.With those tweaks, the display is so good, I actually prefer the GN8 to the N7.2 when it comes to reading Flipbook and PDFs\u2026 but I\u2019ll still be using my Kobo Glo for long periods of reading e-books.For gamers, the GN8 may not have the pixel saturation of the N7.2\u2019s tremendous display, but it isn\u2019t lacking. About as heavy into gaming as I get is Bard\u2019s Tale, and it looks and plays great on the GN8 with the high-definition graphics pack. More intense games will make the GN8 stutter a bit, as its graphics processor is a bit dated. However, you\u2019re not going to be interested in the GN8 if you\u2019re only looking to browse the internet, play games and stream movies: this is not your recreational user\u2019s tablet.There\u2019s also a price to be paid for the N7.2\u2019s cutting edge technology: glitches. Google it.In addition to an enjoyable reading experience, the GN8 has something the N7.2 should: physical buttons that eliminate the need of assigning precious screen real-estate to navigation icons. These physical keys located away from the screen make the actual display area of the GN8 about 20% larger than the N7.2 with its virtual keys that take up a significant chunk of room on the display. Samsung, like Apple, gets why people instinctually enjoy having a dedicated home button: it makes life easier, even if some technophiles consider them the cumbersome tools of luddites. The dedicated keys make a lot of sense on the GN8: if you\u2019re interested in a device that has been designed around a stylus, you appreciate the touch-feely attributes of the entire Galaxy line\u2019s design.That stylus is a major benefit for people like me: content publishers that need to be able to import, edit and publish multimedia from remote locations. While sketching is great for fun or to make mind maps of projects, the S-Pen isn\u2019t just about Paper Artist. I\u2019ve found very good uses for the S-Pen when paired with the GN8\u2019s impressive hardware.The S-Pen is a great device, and I understand why people justify the expense of the GN8 with the statement \u201cit\u2019s all about the S-Pen\u201d after using the N7.2 with an aftermarket device. The S-Pen is a bit too thin for me to use for long periods, but I actually prefer navigating around the home screen and most applications with the S-Pen instead of my finger, especially Photoshop Touch (more on that later).This isn\u2019t a major problem because the Note is designed to take\u2026 notes. The S-Pen integrates well when digesting information-heavy PDFs, allowing the user to highlight section of text, make notes and quickly integrate and organize them within S-Note.Making the process even more efficient is MultiWindow. The MultiWindow feature is one of the advantages unique to the Note line that Samsung has made better than in the last generation with smoother control and more available applications that support it. Of course, I would like to see even more applications support it because everyone uses multiple windows on their bigger computers, so everyone knows how much of a productivity advantage the capability is. It\u2019s a no-brainer application designers need to integrate into their apps.When a beautiful display optimized for reading and highly integrated to the S-Pen input and interface, then empowered with MultiWindow and gestures like swiping the screen with the flat of the hand to take a full screen shot (or circling text and images with the S-Pen\u2019s button depressed to capture smaller items), I have a hard time believing that any other device could be better for the task of heavy research and study. The GN8 is the honors graduate student\u2019s wet dream.And there\u2019s good news for GN8 users after grad school. To schedule life, S-Planner almost became what I use to work with my Google calendars. It\u2019s a fluid and seamless way to do almost everything I need to do with my schedules, but it has one glaring fault because instead of being its own application, S-Planner is not much more than Google Calendar with S-Pen support and a new skin. Unfortunately, S-Planner has all the limitations of Google Calendar when it comes to scheduling.Instead, I\u2019m using another pre-loaded GN8 application for most of my scheduling needs: Awesome Note HD (though I still prefer the endless scrolling agenda list of Business Calendar\u2019s widget, found here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=netgenius.bizcal&hl;=en). Awesome Note HD, like the now-dead Astrid, allows me to set repeating events by the days that need to elapse. Granted, this is a feature I use to do things like remind myself to change the house\u2019s HVAC filter, replace the head on my electric toothbrush and give my lovely dog her heartworm and tick medications. While pedestrian, all of those tasks are dependent on the amount of days lapsed and important to me.Note to Samsung: form a partnership with Awesome Note by folding S-Planner and S-Note into a Note-tablet specific version of their application.The GN8 is loaded with a 4,600mAH battery that keeps me moving and producing in the field for my entire day. In the week I\u2019ve had it, I have never have to recharge the GN8 before bedtime, and I\u2019m not a light user.This is my GN8\u2019s typical day: I start out by sending and responding to emails in the morning for about an hour during my commute, generally using a folding Bluetooth keyboard or Google\u2019s voice recognition input through a Bluetooth headset. Once I get to where I\u2019m going my day is spent capturing and creating content, editing content between meetings and giving presentations at my client\u2019s offices. On my way home, I participate in social networking, play video games or try to get ahead on media projects that are either rushed, delayed or personal. After my commute, I\u2019ll use the GN8 to manage shopping and errand lists on my way home, and once I get home I use the integrated Peel application to control my television and DirectTV!Speaking of the IR blaster, it won\u2019t allow you to \u201cbump\u201d files and contacts to other devices like the N7.2\u2019s NFC feature. Some have listed this as a detriment, but NFC isn\u2019t going to be used in the environment that the GN8 is designed to excel in. Professionals may bump contacts with their phones, but I\u2019ve never seen anyone do it with their tablet\u2026 and I\u2019ve seen A LOT of people use A LOT of tablets.However, with the IR blaster found on the GN8 (and not the N7.2), it is a tremendous asset to be able to control monitors and most other devices with the same device you\u2019re running a presentation from. With ChromeCast and the IR blaster found in the GN8, I\u2019m ready to rock a presentation in most modern offices within a minute\u2026 and that makes a great impression when dealing with prospective clients that don\u2019t have a lot of time to waste.That\u2019s not to say NFC isn\u2019t good technology. It\u2019s great on a phone, but I\u2019m not going to dig out my tablet every time I want to purchase a latte and apple fritter\u2026The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d for media professionals because you buy a whole lot of bangs with the same buck. When the ability to set up and control presentation equipment in seconds instead of minutes (or even hours with older stuff) is combined with a massive fuel tank that supports a full work day of use without a recharge, outstanding performance, high-speed connectivity, better productivity, a wonderful display, light weight and a slick design, the GN8 becomes more than a really cool tablet. The GN8 does most of what any mobile professional needs it to do for as long as they need it to do it while saving weight, money, time and, with the S-Pen, it also saves my clients from the indignity of signing my invoices with their finger.THE BONUS EDITION:This is what you spend the $25 Google Play credit on if you want to get the most out of the GN8\u2019s unique features that make this tablet the best small Android tablet on the market:The S-Pen and Adobe\u2019s $10 \u201climited\u201d port of Photoshop [...] go together like peanut butter and jelly. I know that there are capable applications out there like Snapseed that will allow most people to do almost everything they need to make their photos pop for Facebook and Pinterest. But I\u2019m not blogging about food trucks or touching up selfies: I do stuff with images, video and sound for a living. If I can have Photoshop and do the high quality creating and editing on the go, I\u2019m buying it\u2026 and honestly, it\u2019ll do at least 95% of what I need it to do, so when compared to the exponentially more expensive desktop application, Photoshop Touch is one of the century\u2019s best deals.In addition to that, a $4.99 license for Clesh [...] gives me the ability to edit videos on the go. It works well for most of my needs, though some more complicated projects still require my sedentary equipment because I don\u2019t have much patience. I wouldn\u2019t recommend Clesh for a smartphone, but on larger displays and the extremely fast WiFi radio built into the GN8, Clesh is a wonderful application that makes the most of the GN8\u2019s hardware and S-Pen.To round it all out, Audio Evolution Mobile is available for $6.99 [...] and allows me to connect my ZOOM audio recorder to the GN8 via an inexpensive OTG USB adapter. It captures much better audio than the microphones mounted on the GN8, and it allows me to capture, edit and package complete audio tracks while working from my couch or on the long Metro ride home. The S-Pen makes grabbing and piecing together tracks one of the easiest experiences I\u2019ve had, and I have complete control over the entire capture process when doing podcasts outside my normal studio.Compared to the desktop interface, I prefer to edit my audio on the GN8 for a few reasons. First is the S-Pen interface because it makes clicking and scrolling and dragging so much more fluid than the mouse. The second reason has to do with quality. I can listen to it through my car\u2019s audio jack or Bluetooth, through wired headphones, Bluetooth stereo and Bluetooth mono headsets. This allows me to make sure it sounds okay across all formats my audience is likely to use without having to suffer the indignity of Microsoft\u2019s Bluetooth client.Since I have an OTG cable, I need an app that will help me bring files to the GN8 from its native location, and that\u2019s the excellent Nexus Media Importer available at the Play Market for $3.99 [...]. If I don\u2019t have to hassle with swapping MicroSD, I don\u2019t hassle with swapping MicroSD cards, and I\u2019ve already paid myself back a few times with the amount of time and frustration this application saves me.To get all those files organized and uploaded to where they need to go, I use the Total Commander file manager [...] and the FTP Plugin for Total Commander [...]. Both are available for free at the Android Market and are the best applications I\u2019ve used for my needs.For those not keeping track, the above applications cost a total of $25.96 and make the GN8 one of the best editing platforms I\u2019ve ever used. So far, I haven\u2019t witnessed the 1.6GHz quad-core Exynos processor struggle with the demands of editing or creating professional-level multimedia content. Even if it is slower than a high-quality desktop, I save more time with the S-Pen than I\u2019ve wasted on rendering.If I need to access a more powerful system, Samsung and Dropbox have teamed up to give GN8 purchasers a free 50GB upgrade. The WiFi radio that comes with the GN8 is one of the fastest I\u2019ve used, and I\u2019ve moved large files over both public and private hotspots in about the same amount of time my laptop takes. Granted, this is a snail\u2019s pace when compared to a direct line into a cable network, but for WiFi performance, the GN8\u2019s performance impresses.Also, the GN8 has one of the best GPS radios I\u2019ve used on ANY device! Navigating with GN8 and Google Now takes about 15 seconds less than trying to do the same thing through the dedicated navigation systems I\u2019ve used in most cars! It is truly amazing how much work Samsung put into getting the GN8 to work well before releasing it to market.You can\u2019t say the same thing about the N7.2. Google it.Combined with Splashtop, all I have to do is upload the media to my Dropbox account, log into the app, wait for my desktop to pop up and tell my hard-core unit at home what to do. While I\u2019m meeting with clients, doing work or commuting, my bigger projects are rendering on their own. I can log back in to Splashtop to check the progress of the project from anywhere in the United States, and when it\u2019s done I can use Splashtop to send it back to DropBox and have my client preview it.TECHNO-TANGENT WARNING: Even though it\u2019s more difficult to set up, I prefer the older Splashtop Remote Desktop HD on sale for $8.99 because I can use it any time I want on any network I want without having to \u201crent\u201d it by the month.

If programming settings is too difficult, or you find Google\u2019s servers too slow for things like gaming, you can use the new and improved Splashtop2: [...]", "Title": "The best extra money I almost didn\u2019t spend for a refurbished item.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Author": "taka13", "ReviewID": "RGA1PFDQUNN0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My OG 10.1\" Asus Transformer TF101 was showing its age, and so it was time for a replacement.  I was looking for a more portable tablet that I could take to school or anywhere without the bulk.  After reading reviews and testing store demos, I narrowed it down to the Nexus 7 2013, Tab 3 8.0, and Note 8.0.  I'm no fanboy to any OS, but the iPad mini was never in the equation simply because I was in the market for Android not iOS.  The decision was tough, but for my needs the Note 8.0 edges them out.With all the Nexus 7 2013's great price and high specs, I just couldn't get past the screen size.  The high resolution display has sharp text, but a tad too small for my liking on full web pages and PDF's.  In landscape mode text was comfortable, but viewing height felt narrow.  Coming from rarely having to zoom on a 10\" screen wasn't helping either.  Even though the Nexus 7 is fast, sleek, and updates quickly I wasn't willing to give up 3\" of screen.So all that remained was the Samsung Tab 3 8.0 and Note 8.0.  After comparing these further I decided to take the plunge on the pricier Note 8.0 for the increased horsepower and S-pen stylus.  Overall I am very happy with it, despite my few gripes with it.  Transitioning from 10\" to 8\" was painless and found that I wasn't missing the larger screen at all.  The display is surprisingly vibrant and crisp considering it's not an Amoled or IPS tier screen.  Like others mentioned 8\" is the way to go for mobility, weight, comfort, while retaining a sizeable screen.  Text size is better than the Nexus 7 in full web pages and PDF's requiring little to no zooming.  I don't use the Wacom stylus as much as I thought, but it's amazingly handy when you need it.  Performance is snappy and tackles everyday tasks to moderately intensive gaming with ease.The only gripes I have, which I've learned to accept, are with Touchwiz, home buttons, and battery life.  Samsung's interface is bloated and looks a little cartoonish to me.  Without rooting I disabled the Samsung apps and features I didn't use, and added a launcher like Nova with minimalist icons for a better look and feel.  Occasionally mine will freeze for a second and then keep going like nothing happened, which I blame on Touchwiz.  It doesn't bother me much since it doesn't occur often, plus it's still ten times better than my old tablet.  Handling the tablet in landscape took some getting used to since it's easy to hit the back and menu buttons on accident, but one benefit is that it doesn't take up any screen.  Also battery life is acceptable not great; with moderate use, some tweaking, and its superior standby, it will get you easily over a day.  Hopefully the 4.2 update will help the battery and performance like it did on the 3G/LTE variant.Although the Tab 3 8.0 performs well in its own right in my opinion the only reason to get one is if you financially cannot or do not want to spend the difference for the Note 8.0.  Even still with Amazon's pricing and $25 Google credit (till 9/30), that brings it down to about a $50 difference, plus you get a faster processor, more ram, and s-pen features.If Google made a Nexus 8, I probably wouldn't be writing this review; however until then Samsung stands alone in the 8\" Android category, not including cheap tablets.In the end all three are great tablets, but the 8\" screen, S-pen, and performance on the Note 8.0 fit my needs the best.", "Title": "Nexus 7 2 vs Tab 3 8.0 vs Note 8.0!", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R15FH7UA21UV9P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that I did not buy this tablet at Amazon. Having said that, after using it for about a week, it has proved to be an excellent tablet and comes with features that you don't find in the competition.Most people who have an issue with this tablet are concerned about the price. While that concern is legitimate, it is misguided due to the fact that it compares this tablet to the iPad mini. To start, the iPad Mini is exactly the iPad 2, except with a smaller display, which makes it two year old technology. It is powered by an anemic (by today's standards) dual-core 1 Ghz A5 CPU and a paltry 512 MB of RAM. By contrast, the Note 8.0 is powered by a quad-core 1.6 Ghz CPU and 2 GB of RAM. It is not the fastest CPU currently out there, but it is miles ahead of the A5. I am fairly on top of current technology, and I can't think of a single tablet in any form factor that has more powerful hardware. Absolutely not the iPad Mini or the iPad 4. And the obvious difference is that the Note 8 has a pen-capable display, which is not found on any competing 8\" tablet. Now, I am not trying to claim that either the iPad mini or the Note 8 are overpriced/underpriced because I simply don't know, but I am trying to point out why the higher price of the Note 8 is justified.The other issues that people seem to have with this device is the plastic housing and the screen resolution. While it would certainly be nice to have full 1080p, I can say that the screen on this tablet is excellent. I would not consider the screen resolution to be a drawback in this device. To give you a comparison, the 13.3\" display in my MacBook Pro has the exact same resolution as the 8\" display in the Note 8. It is very sharp. As far as the plastic vs aluminum housing goes, let's put it this way; every iPad or iPhone I've seen in use was shrouded in a thick layer of plastic, rubber, or leather, and chances are good that you'll be buying a case for this tablet as well. The housing should make no difference to most people, and arguably plastic is more durable. You drop a metal tablet, you'll either dent it or bend it. It's permanent damage. You drop a plastic tablet and it may just absorb the impact better, w/o significant cosmetic defects.As far as my experiences with it go, I have had absolutely no problems. The tablet is very fast and fluid, screen is plenty bright to even use in direct sunlight, and battery life is adequate. I can't give specific details on battery life yet, but from what I can tell so far, I should be able to get around 8 hours of screen time and maybe more. It of course depends on a lot of things. Browsing for example will use more battery than reading an ebook, likewise watching videos will use more battery. The biggest battery drain is the screen, so if you are using it at max brightness, expect significant battery drain. That goes for any tablet.So, should you buy this tablet over the iPad mini or the Nexus 7. Well, they are both cheaper, and if you are already invested in the Apple ecosystem, it may make more sense for you to go for the iPad. The Nexus 7 is very cheap by comparison, and rightfully so. Despite being powered by a quad-core CPU, the Tegra 3 is not anywhere near the speed of the Exynos chip in this device. You can look at benchmarks online if you want, but I have another tablet with the Tegra 3, and the Exynos CPU in the Note 8 blows it away, benchmarking nearly twice as fast. And you can really tell the difference in regular use. Of course the Nexus 7 is also a 7\" tablet. The only way I'd recommend the Nexus 7 over the iPad mini or the Note 8 is if you're going strictly by price. Otherwise, you really have to decide whether or not you need the stylus. If all you want is to watch movies, read news, and play games, you have no use for the stylus. If you need note-taking capability or precision touch capability, this is the tablet to get. The Wacom stylus is not simply a finger replacement, it is a precision tool for handwriting, drawing, or designing, and it works extremely well.", "Title": "Excellent tablet for those who have use for the stylus", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Author": "LuckyAL", "ReviewID": "R1B4STG3UIFZUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This highlights some of the Apps that are \"NEED TO HAVES\" if you make the wise choice of buying this tablet.  With the Note 8 and these Apps, I haven't used my Desktop since.NEED TO HAVE Apps for the Samsung Galaxy Note 8mazec3**This App replaces your keyboard and enables you to hand write in every App, email and on the internet using the S/Pen.  Most people have difficulty reading my hand writing and yet this App is able to consistently convert it into text. I find that hand writing with mazec3 on the Note 8 is noticeably faster than tapping or swipping on a keyboard.  With this App and the Note 8, you'll get more done than you could on any other tablet.**It is worth noting that the Samsung keyboard does have a native handwriting recognition mode built in (you can find it in the keyboard's settings).  However, instead of writing continuously, you can only input a couple words at a time.  It's reliable - but it will slow you down.Polaris OfficeThis App comes pre loaded on the Note 8 but I am highlighting it to urge you to use it...because it is so amazing.  I have tried several Apps to create and edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents-nothing comes close to Polaris Office.  It is extremely easy to use and the editing tools closely mirror the Office Desktop Software.  So far, I haven't found anything that I used to do on my desktop that I haven't been able to do with Polaris Office.  In fact, when combined with mazec3, I prefer Polaris Office to the desktop.G CloudThis App backs up all of your files including documents, music, contacts etc... Just install it on all your devices - including your old tablet, then back-up all your files and you can easily download any of the files on the Note 8. I also use Drop Box, but the reason I love this App is because I can easily get my music from my past and present devices onto my Note 8 and my documents are backed up daily so I can't lose anything.mSecureThis App stores all your passwords and log in information.  What makes this App stand out from the pack (and will save you time) is that from mSecure in a click or two you can instantly login to your favorite Websites-without having to open your browser, type in the URL, and type in your login info... mSecure does all the work for you.  I also used to use the same 2-3 passwords over and over.  With mSecure, I now have unique passwords for all my logins using their password generator.  I no longer use my desktop to login to online banking or web applications... it's faster and easier on the Note 8.I hope this gives you a better idea of what is possible with the Note 8.

I tried the small first and it seemed to be okay, but I thought maybe I would like a bigger screen, so I returned the small one and got the bigger one. After a couple of weeks, I realized just how limited I was using that device and found myself using my phone more for browsing, playing games, etc. Plus, I like to put movies on mine to watch when I'm bored at work. I had a hard time getting videos on the kindle. It would tell me it was in the wrong format, when It wasn't. Anyway, I returned both of those and went for the Samsung note 8. I already had the Samsung galaxy 3 for my phone, so I knew that I would know my way around it. I have had it for a couple of months now and I love it. I use the stylus all the time because it really is intuitive when it comes to figuring out what you've written. Let me tell, I have horrible hand writing too. I love the split screen and have used it multiple times. The only thing I wish is that there were more options for the split screen. Like opening 2 of my favorite apps at the same time. Only certain apps will work with the split screen and most of those are the ones Samsung put on the tablet. The Samsung calendar is fantastic and the size is perfect for me. I realized when I bought the larger kindle that I had made a mistake because it didn't fit into most of my purses. The note 8 is big enough to be very functional for me, but small enough that it's very portable.

Due to (and some provided by) my job, I have an ipod, ipad, a windows laptop, a macbook pro, and only recently I've gotten into android products, and I have to say that I love the openness of android.First of all, when I got the note 8.0, I have to say I both loved and mostly hated it; hated it because of all the bloatware and useless (to me) apps that Samsung puts on the tablet; I loved it because of the wacom pen, which is very precise. Moreover, you can use ANY wacom tablet pen with the tablet, not just the small pen that comes with the note. I use a very nice wacom pen from an old Fujitsu tablet pc. I have the Wacom \"Penabled Tablet Pc Eraser Pen\" which is nice as well and is large almost like a regular pencil. The pen can easily be used to take notes in class, especially with LectureNotes (which I used on a daily basis).To get rid of the bloatware, you can get an app called Clean Master from the android app store and if you open it up and go to app manager, you can disable (not uninstall) all the useless preinstalled apps (there is a category that says \"completely safe to disable apps\" and you just disable them, one after another). Of course, you can also go to app manager and do the same, but Clean Master makes it so easy. This is OK and it left a fairly nice tablet without a lot of the bloatware.However, I ended up voiding the warranty because I rooted the note 8.0, then I installed a custom recovery (Philz touch), then I installed cyanogenmod 11. Now I have to say that I absolutely love the note 8.0; it's my favorite computer. The wacom pen works perfectly, and the tablet is 100% pure with no traces of bloatware whatsoever and it runs smooth as silk. (The original Samsang had over 50% of the ram being used even without installed apps running, while with cyanogenmod 11, only 17% is used.)I would have never written this review, except that I did install the custom ROM (cyanogenmod 11) and the Samsung works like the dream tablet I've always wanted.

The Note 8 is comfortable to hold in the portrait and landscape position. I found the galaxy 8.9 and especially the iPad to be awkward and cumbersome to hold. In the landscape position I found it difficult to cover the entire space of the iPad and tab 8.9. I did like the size of the nexus 7 but chose to sell mine on Glyde to upgrade to the note 8. The Note 8 feels very comfortable to hold despite it being plastic. I do not have a problem with plastic phones or tablets because I always put a screen cover and case on my devices to protect them.SOFTWAREI was not a fan of Samsung's earlier renditions of its Touchwiz interface on my galaxy tab (8.9). In fact, I still think that stock android is ideal but I just install the nova launcher app (see link below) and run that on top of Touchwiz which is the main reason to go with an android device, customization! I had toiled with the idea of purchasing the Note 8 because I thought it was overpriced. So after a trip to BB, I tried to force myself to get an iPad mini but still felt like I was using the same operating system I had on my iPod touch from 4 years ago. Apple might get better apps at first but they all migrate to Android eventually and Android has so many customization apps available it is hard to get bored. Apples control issues will be its undoing imo, and have severely limited what these devices are capable of doing. Does Samsung copy Apple? I think they do copy some aspects of Apple like the messaging app and touch keyboards looks eerily similar and the presence of a home button. I think Apple makes superior looking devices but Samsung and Android have superior software.DISPLAYThis is another reason I chose the Note 8 instead of the iPad mini which I also think is the perfect size. I strongly considered waiting for a retina display to come out for the iPad mini but could not justify moving backwards to an iOS device. Also after I put a iPad retnia display next to the iPad mini I did not notice enough of a difference to justify the added bulk and expense that comes with the retina display. The display on the Note 8 is absolutely gorgeous! It is one of the most vibrant screens I have ever seen.MISCThe s pen is an added bonus but the addition of an micro sd card slot that is not hidden inside the device is another reason not to overlook the Note 8. Both of these options make photo editing easier in my opinion. I have a micro sd card adapter in my camera and all I have to do is pop it in the Note 8 and photos are loaded into the gallery. The s pen is cool but I have not had enough time with the device to review its effectiveness. The multiscreen ability of the Note 8 is one of its better features. It has a limited amount of apps that function with the multi screen ability but all of the main ones like chrome browser, facebook, maps and all of the samsung apps function.  I purchased the device at BB and made sure they price matched the Amazon price.CONCLUSIONI can honestly say that I am completely happy with my purchase and despite the high price of the Note 8 I feel that I did not want to compromise with my tablet.

It is a great product and me being a big android fan, I can confidently say it can't get any better ... oh well almost !!! The only negative thing I can say about it, is its inability to deal well with large pdf files. I think this is a  problem for android in general, and this is one of the areas where apple is still superior. Opening and skimming through large pdf books on apple devices, for example an ipad mini ,is much more fluid and you don't have to wait for pages to load even when the processor is actually weaker on paper than samsung's processor. I frequently use this tablet for reading and for the most part it does the job but recently I got a large book (around 220 MB) and the device had major problems with it. I tried several ebook  readers to open it and I noticed variable performances between them but none was perfect. The best reader which gave me a very fluid performance comparable to the one I saw when I opened the pdf on an ipad mini was the kindle application, I was happy but again the kindle doesnt have all the options provided by my favourite readers.As a summary, I highly recommend this tablet, it is superior to apple in most aspects except for the one I just mentioned, so I think the manufacturers should work on that.", "Title": "Great tablet ...but", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Author": "Jen", "ReviewID": "R382FJF13OQ4F8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start with what bugs me, which isn't much with this tablet.The placement of the home keys... This is just something I'm going to have to get used to. It's nice that Samsung created fixed home keys vs using the android screen home keys. Only there at the very bottom. Every time I'm holding in portrait mode my thumbs keep hitting the return and settings key. Trying to hold it avoiding those keys feels awkward. I don't have tiny hands so this is going to take some getting used to. Also, when it's in landscape mode I forget the home keys are fixed and have to get used to using them with my left hand or right (depending on what orientation I have it). For people who have never owned an tablet before they wont know the difference. For seasoned users, this will take some retraining.The camera is fine in portrait mode, but landscape it a bit awkward as well.Aside from those two issues, I'm totally in love with my Note 8. I'm just going to list the thing I love, since there are many detailed reviews already on this.Size: I've owned 10.1 and 7.0. This is a happy medium for me. I love my 7.0 but the extra inch is nice. Although I would have been happy with it at 7.0 as well. It fits in my purse well and doesn't weigh it down too much. My 10.1 inch always felt heavy in my bag.Multi-screen: Very cool feature. You can easily view multiple windows at the same time.Stylus: Never used one before and this is really cool. It's like using a pen on your tablet. Real easy to use. Only draw back is the home key the tablet is too hard to use with stylus, so I have to press it with my finger. Not a big deal for me though.Built-in apps: This tablet is designed for readers, note takers, web browsing and so, so much more. Samsung's built-in apps are really great. I've only had the tablet for less than week so I haven't had time to play with everything. However I from what I've used it's great for journaling and note taking. One of the main reasons why I wanted this tablet so I wouldn't have to buy anymore paper journals and do all my journaling on my tablet. Of course other tablets can take notes as well. It's just different with they stylus and the apps Samsung has provided.Micro SD: 64GB, that's all I'm saying. I've added on and it reads perfect. Yes, this tablet comes with free 50GB of space with Drop Box, but that's only for year. And what do you do when you want to access a file (pics or music) when you're offline? The added 64GB leaves me so much space to add my pics and music I'm set. My only wish is that Samsung/Google allowed for apps to be stored on the card as well. As with older version of Android used to do.Camera: Front and rear are great. Only when in landscape mode the home keys kinda get in the way. Again just some retraining for people who are used to having the home keys in the screen.Display: Love it. Took this to the beach. I had to have the brighten on the highest, but I was able to see it perfect. The reading feature is great too. Much easier on the eyes.Extra home screen: Every time you plug in your headphones or pull out your stylus you get a customized home screen that you can adjust how ever you want. So for example the stylus home screen has apps for notes and the headphone screen has apps for music and videos. With each screen you're able to add additional apps or remove them.There's so much more this tablet can do I can go on and on. The price is a bit too high. I can see it at even $50-$75 dollars less.

This was an afterthought to an ongoing adventure with the to-date miserable Dell Venue Pro 8 stylus*.  The Note 8 will update itself to Android 4.2.2, which is good news.  And although it appears only the 16GB version is out there now (at least in Wifi only) you do have the option to install apps to the MicroSD card.  The 8\" form factor is, in my opinion, a better size for note taking with the pen than a 10\" or 12\" tablet, although they are likely preferred for those with artistic tendencies.  This will be a productivity tablet for me.  Using Papyrus and the included S-note, I am very happy with this device.  It is a touch tablet until you need the pen, and a pen tablet when you want to take a note.The limitations of no native pen support in either Evernote or Onenote is disappointing, but not a show stopper for me.  Several pen apps will export or sync to Evernote, although so far I have found that integration is not as tight as you might hope.  But, Samsung did a very, very good job of the pen implementation here and if you are going to look to the tablet more than you look for what the tablet sends to your laptop, this is your device.The screen resolution spec is on the low side, but it is not noticeable.  I have found that in these 7-8 inch tablets, high end resolution specs may be overkill at least in everyday productivity tasks.  Comparing an iPad Retina, Venue Pro 8, and Nexus 7 2013 the only practical difference I see is screen brightness, rather than resolution.  Basically, I can illuminate a large room with the Dell or Nexus, but all are acceptable in normal usage.  Outdoors, you will favor the Dell or the Nexus.  So basically no complaints about the screen at all but I wouldn't mind a brighter one.So my conclusion here, if you need a pen-input productivity tablet and are happy keeping most of the information \"on tablet\" don't hesitate.  If you need Onenote with pen input, go look at the Asus Vivotab and the Windows world, or anticipate the hoped for \"Surface Mini\" later in 2014.-------------------------*Update on Dell Venue Pro 8.  Dell, without any request from me, send me a new revision active stylus.  Bravo Dell. The new version seems very usable with onenote, although it is a step down from the s-pen as expected.

He \"Cryora\"", "ReviewID": "R32GDBRUKHDIKX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's probably the one of the smallest tablets out there that has a Wacom digitizer.  I personally felt like I should have gotten one with a larger screen (like the Note 10.1), since I'm physics student.  The writing is not as precise as pencil on paper, nor as fast (it has a small but noticeably latency).  My best analogy would be that the precision is somewhere between a sharpy and a ball pen.  Still, it allows me to save paper.  If you want a tablet for drawing, you might want something larger too, unless it's just for fun.Still, I reckon the small size of the tablet has its perks.  Its battery size is half that of the 10.1, and the battery life is only a few hours shorter.  So while it might not last you as long on a full charge, it takes less time to charge it.  Usually an hour or two is enough to get the Note 8 from almost 0% to 100% battery life.  You get more battery life per hour spent charging it compared to larger, battery hungry tablets.For the purposes of keeping memos, however, it's pretty awesome.  Everything is digital, so you don't have to worry about having a mess of disorganized flash cards or post-its around your desk.  Cutting and pasting is not that smooth, but possible.The Android OS is iffy.  While it's a nice combat OS that allows widget customization and multiple pages for your home screen, it lacks the same productivity as a Windows (especially if you're used to Windows).  You'll probably have to go out of your way to find apps that allow you to convert one file type to another.  Some apps won't even allow you options to open from, or save to a directory, but rather require you to \"share\" it via Google Drive or some other method.  Organizing files is certainly less efficient because of this.  You'll also have to go out of your way to find apps (sometimes pay for apps) to allow the same functionality that you can get for free on Windows, like writing programs in C++, and the capabilities will still be limited (console applications).  It does come with Polaris Office, which allows you to create document, spreadsheet, and presentation files, albeit with derpy compatibility with MS Office.  Sometimes symbols come out wrong, or the formatting is not conserved.The tablet screen, imo, is large enough to view full web pages (as opposed to mobile versions of the same pages), since it does have pretty good resolution.  Plus you can always zoom in if things are hard to see).  However, you'll have to go out of your way to make Youtube videos work on Desktop mode.For the Note 8 - No support for Java.  No gyroscope.  No flash (for taking pictures).  :(The back camera protrudes out from the back surface.  Solution - get a case.The IR blaster sucks (my TV won't detect it).The GPS is hard to use (Google Maps requires online connectivity, so either save an area of your map for offline use, or get an SMS version of the Tablet).  There are navigation apps, but the free open source ones have missing streets, while the more complete ones will cost you.  I've personally stuck to using a dedicated GPS device.There is a slot for micro-SD card.  You can also buy an on-the-go device to connect the micro-USB port (same port for charging) of this tablet to a USB flash drive, or SD card.  :)The bottom line is it's a great tablet for the price.  It does everything that any other Android tablet does (with the exception of serious gaming) and has an S-pen.  The screen size may not be ideal for doing math problems or more advanced art projects, but it gets the job done.  A lot of the neat features (Java, Gyro, Camera Flash) aren't present, but the tablet is compact and has a quick battery charge time (though not necessarily life, but enough to last you about a day per charge).  It does give you the Office capabilities, but specifically for spreadsheets, I much prefer working on Excel on a laptop or computer with a mouse (and a larger screen).", "Title": "Great tablet for the price", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Author": "Jersey Girl", "ReviewID": "RDCMFQ9W62QOA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the summer of 2013 I bought a 7 inch Tab 2, mostly for reasons of price.  I then experienced some buyer's remorse after I saw the Note.  I waffled back and forth because it seemed self indulgent to purchase another tablet so soon.  Then I caught a good deal on a Black Friday promotion and took the plunge.  I am so glad I did.The S-Pen really is worth it.  I tried after market styluses with both my Tab and my Ipad and they didn't have the precision (these devices also lack the digital layer that enables the S-Pen to function).  My work requires that I read and mark up PDF documents on a frequent basis.  Being able to do this with the S-Pen turns a chore into something resembling a pleasure.  The S-Pen is very accurate and my notes are legible.Other improvements over the tab are a slimmer profile device, a MUCH longer battery life, and a better screen.  It is fast enough for my needs.  I also appreciate the expansion slot so memory can be added economically.  The big apple gouges a bit for extra memory, IMOIf I were looking for a tablet for fun and leisure, I'd go for an ipad because of the more intuitive operating system and the greater array of apps, and for streaming digital content.  However, if you want to use a tablet for work as well as play, I don't think you can beat the Samsung Note series of tablets.  The multi-screen capability (while limited) is another big plus.

(I still have a \"dumb phone.\")  I was all set to get a Kindle Fire, thinking it was a good starter tablet, since all I really wanted to do was read books, do a little internet surfing, e-mail, and maybe watch a few videos.  I read enough negative reviews that it made me think twice, and after seeing the 8 inch screen size on the Samsung in a local electronics store (not too big, not too small, just right!), and playing with the stylus for drawing and note taking, I was sold, even though it was more than I planned on spending.  The designer in me was also attracted to the white bezel and slim, lightweight design.I love the home button on the front, the menu button to the left of it that brings up whatever menu goes with the application you have running in front, as well as the return arrow that takes you back to where you were (very helpful for someone like me used to windows). Learning my way around the features was a lot easier and more intuitive than I expected, it's enough like Windows that I think I've figured most of it out in a much shorter period of time that I thought I would.I'm also using it for things I never expected I would like or need, things like opening e-mailed faxes I work off of every day, rather than printing them out, so this will eventually pay for itself in toner and paper saved.  One of the first applications I added was Kindle, and I've already downloaded a couple books, I'm actually reading more as a result because being able to enlarge the text makes it easier for my not so great vision.  I don't think it works within the Kindle app, but this tablet has some kind of reading feature that allows for adjusted backlighting and I think contrast with the text to make it easier.  Within the kindle app, though, I'm still able to dim it enough in the evening, for example, that it's not too much strain on the eyes.  For me it's fine, since I don't typically read for more than a half hour to an hour at a time, at most.Also LOVE the drawing and note taking feature, and I've sketched some designs in S-Note using different colors and pen/pencil/brush types.  No more scribbled notes, sketches and ideas getting away from me on my desk or the bottom of my purse.I still sometimes struggle to adjust to this screen size after being used to a 24 inch monitor, but I'm getting used to it and I'm so glad I bought this thing.  It's definitely more than a toy.  I just wish I hadn't caved and bought the ESET antivirus software that the sales guy insisted I needed, since I found a free Antivirus app in the Google Play store.

While this device is plastic, it feels solid in the hand, and the plastic makes it light and very easy to hold in one hand.

I use it as a day planner, the S-pen is surprisingly accurate and relatively natural feeling to use once you get alittle bit of a hang of it... there is still a lot of S-pen functionality left for me to learn, but it's so cool to be able to take notes and schedule a calendar without digging through notebooks, and paperwork.I just figured out how to use the Peel app to run my TV... it's just basic functionality(volume/channels), but what makes it pretty awesome for me is that it's also a fully functional TV guide. I'm only viewing over-the-air television, so unless I buy some form of TV guide I'm left to surf through the channels to figure out what's on.

I definitely did not want an ipad. To me, it's just a glorified smart phone and toy that's not very smart and not much fun to play with. Apple limits the amount of real work and enjoyment one can get out of it.When selecting a note pad, I looked for something that I could be productive with ( particularly with documents and such) whilst having the \"oomph\" that it takes for some reading and perhaps a movie every now and then. Not everyone who is in business,  thinks business all of the time. Not everyone who enjoys leisurely entertainment,  wants to be entertained all of the time, either.The spen is something I don't think that I'll ever want to give up.

On the other hand, if you plan on writing digitally, it's perfect. I use it for all my notes and homework at university. I've never had any complaints about performance or battery life. (In fact, I rarely get it below 50% in a day). The stylus is very accurate. The size seems perfect for a tablet. Much bigger, and I might as well use my laptop, but any smaller and it would be hard to use. It even fits in my coat pocket! All the Samsung junk is a bit annoying, but you can disable most of the things through the Application Manager in settings.Some tips if you want to use it for taking notes:  - I find the app LectureNotes the most capable Android application for note-taking. The full version is $5 I think, but when you just bought a $300 tablet, what's another 5? It easily lets you import PDFs to write on, and you can export as PDF to print to share. By using another application called DropSync, it will sync all your notes to Dropbox (which you get an extra 50GB from buynig this tablet), viewable on your computer.  - I bought a separate stylus to make long writing sessions more comfortable. It's the \"Bamboo Stylus Feel for Samsung Galaxy Note\". Be sure you get the one with the product code CS300UK2, not CS300UK, because it will not write accurately.

I did go out and purchase the \"stylus with eraser\" for this tablet, because that is just plain cool.", "Title": "Perfect For Me", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R9T3SOJ2B13F5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "People are comparing this to the iPad mini and the Nexus 7, but there is no comparison, as this comes with the S Pen digitizer stylus. It is a premium price for this feature, but I love the S Pen, I'm sick of capacitive styli, and I was willing to pay for this feature. If you aren't interested in having a digitizer stylus, then there are a host of 7-8 inch class tablets for a lot less money. If you want a tablet with this feature that's less that 10 inches, this is your baby.I don't find the resolution to be a problem with any but the smallest fonts, and the system is powerful enough to be fast and fluid in every way. Other people have covered pros and cons fairly well, so I'll add some other things I noticed:The Note 8.0 uses the same Micro USB cable and 5V 2 Amp charger that came with my Galaxy Note 2. I'm used to the proprietary connection on larger tablets, so this was an unexpected perk.There's a lack of cases out there right now for this size device, but I have a Timbuck 2 sleeve for my old Kindle 2 that fits perfectly. The inside dimensions of the sleeve are 150 mm by 222 mm (5-7/8 inches by 8-3/4 inches), and it fits perfectly. You could probably fit it in a case with the inside dimensions of 140 cm x 212 cm, but you'd need some depth to the case (a sleeve that tight might not fit).Update 1 4/24/2013For reference, I've also owned the Asus TF101, TF201, and TF700 tablets. I currently use a Galaxy Note 2 phone; previously I've used a Galaxy Nexus, Droid 3, and Droid X. My impression of the Note 8 is based on comparisons to the other Android devices I've used.Now that I've had this for several weeks, I absolutely love it. The size is perfect for taking with me to work, it's light and easy to hold for hours. The S Pen takes some practice to learn the commands, but now I can take a screenshot and make notes on it in seconds. The S Note app is the best I've used for handwritten notes, the palm rejection finally makes it so I can use a tablet as a notebook. You can import PDFs or images and make notes on them, and you can export them back out as PDFs or images. I've used the split screen a few times to make notes while I watch a video lecture, that feature is very nice.Battery life is excellent for a tablet. I get about 7-8 hours of screen time use before it hits 25%-30% (my cutoff for plugging it in). Screen use is streaming Netflix, browsing the internet, playing games, etc. Standby uses almost no power. I haven't let it sit unused for more than 8 hours, but the battery drop is minimal. I did set WiFi to turn off when the screen isn't on, this helps out battery life on any Android device.I've turned off the motion detection and eye detection. The eye detection had trouble with my eyes, maybe because I wear glasses?The included IR apps are pretty useless to me. We don't have cable on our TVs- we use streaming services, BluRay, and gaming consoles. I have two Samsung TVs, one from 2009, one from 2010. Neither worked well with the included IR apps. There is an app on the Play market that is compatible with the Note 8 IR blaster (Touchsquid Samsung). At $19 for the home version it's expensive, but then I realized that the Logitech Harmony remote I bought a couple years ago was four times the price and died in 3 months. So, I bought the app, and while it has a huge learning curve, I can control my TVs, DVD, BluRay, Xbox360 and Roku devices with the Note. Very cool.For the control freaks out there, the Note 8 rooted in seconds using Framaroot with the Aragorn exploit. THIS VOIDS THE WARRANTY. Unless you explicitly know why you want to root, don't do it.The entire system is fast and fluid. There's no issue with opening a YouTube link, watching the video the switching back to the browser or app. My poor formerly beloved TF700 Infinity has barely been touched since I got the Note 8, because it had big problems with fluid transitions. Bluetooth connections to external speakers (Jawbone Jambox) and headphones (LG Tone HBS-700) keep the audio in sync with the picture, another problem that my TF700 could never overcome.The Samsung keyboard is AWESOME! I love the swipe input and one-hand mode. Swipe input on tablets can be hit or miss, depending on the keyboard, but the Samsung keyboard in one-hand mode is small enough so swipe inputs can be done quickly. Also, it will automatically open handwriting recognition when the S Pen is pulled out. Previously, Swype was my keyboard of choice, but the Samsung keyboard is the most functional and comprehensive stock keyboard I've ever used.I continue to see reviews comparing this to the iPad Mini and Nexus 7. I stand by my assertion that there simply is NO comparison. Neither has expandable storage, digitizer stylus, or IR blaster. The stylus and IR blaster are not must-have features, but they are 100% worth the price difference.

I personally dont use the pen that much, but I tend to find it easier to write things than type then out on a tablet keyboard.

It is my go to tablet. I have an older iPad (2nd Gen) that is still up to  date, but  this Samsung has a lot of advantages over the full sized iPad. First, the Samsung Note 8.0 has an SD slot and I can add additional storage space for a very small cost. Second, the size, this tablet is the size of the iPad mini (I have a full size iPad). The Note 8.0 is much lighter, smaller and it fits in my purse. I can access my work e-mail via the touchdown app (not a huge fan of the app, but it is what my employer requires and it functions), I can easily connect the tablet to a wireless keyboard, and it is easier to read a book on the Samsung Note 8.0 than on a full sized iPad.A second important comparison. My husband bought a Verizon Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for me as a gift. It was $100 more than the regular Tab 2 because it was compatable with Verizon and this Note 8.0 cost  $100 more than the Verizon Tab 2 and it is not 4G LTE. Within 11 days I maxed out the  Tab 2. The Tab 2 has 1GB of  RAM and this was not enough to support all of the things that I wanted my tablet to be able to do. The guy at Best Buyin the  Samsung department told me that sure I could switch and use my iPhone 5 to access the internet as a hot spot when I was not near Wifi, but that it would  not  be  very fast or as smooth as the Tab 2. I paid the additional $100 and upgraded to the Note 8.0 any way. This was  the best decision!!! This tablet is so much faster than the Tab 2!!! I am so happy that I made the switch!!!In the end, there are some things that I prefer to do on the iPad and based  on the  technology there are some things that just work better  on the Apple iOS than on Android, but  if  had to pick between the ipad or ipad mini and the Galaxy Note 8.0 I would pick the Note 8.0 hands down.I hope this helps you and if you have any questions I will do my best to answer.9/29/13 - the other day I tried to watch an Amazon instant video  only to find that Flash would not work and even though an Amazon video android app exists it will not work on this or other Samsung devices. I was going to drop this by one star but this appears to be an Amazon decision, not a Samsung decision. It appears that the only Android device that will work is the Kindle Fire. Unfortunately Amazon will let this app work on Apple devices just not other Androids. This is frustrating, but ultimately I decided this was an Amazon issue and not an issue with the device.

But the fire only whetted my appetite for a 'real' android tablet--I.e., one not so buried in the kindle ui, so I bought a galaxy tab 2 10.1. It was very convenient and fast, but not so handy as the fire had been. In fact, I liked the fire so much that I've given three of them as gifts. Meanwhile, I kept being tempted by the note 2, thinking it would be a better all-around device than my tab. I love being able to draw and make notes as well as surf and watch and write. When the ipad mini came out,  I considered it, but it just didn't feel quite right in my hand, and I had become a devoted fan of the android os by then. So, I was hoping Samsung would make a note 7.0, doing all the things I wanted but costing less than the note 2. After all, there's wifi nearly everywhere now.When I heard the next note would be an 8.0\" device, I almost went ahead and bought the 10.1 version, thinking the 8.0\" size would be nearly as big a hand full, so why not have more real estate to doodle on,especially Iin the duel screen mode.But, the introduction day for the note 8.0 found me at Bestbuy, holding the note 8.0, which is enough different in proportions from the ipad mini to make all the difference. The greater pixel density more than makes up for the 2\" smaller screen than the 10.1. And, it's noticeably faster,  at least than the tab 2.After 2 months of daily use,  I am as pleased as I have ever been with any purchase. The battery lasts all day, and it's just a very pleasant little device to carry around. It's hardly heavier than my kindle touch, which seldom leaves the house now . It's surprising easy to see the screen in most light conditions. The keyboard is an easy size to use with one or two hands, and it has the best hand-writing recognition I've yet found, alhough sometimes it decides my capital letters are numerals.The major drawback is that I wish Samsung had immediately introduced it with more memory.Would I recommend it to a friend?  Not necessarily. If you just want to surf the net and watch movies or play games or listen to music, then there are several 7.0 tablets out there at much lower prices.

I've had no issue with the back button as some people have stated, and the feel of the pen is so close to actual writing that I have almost gone to it all the time for my email and note taking. I put on a Minuguard clear screen protector and find that it gives just the slightest drag on the pen to make it feel like writing on paper.I had been going back and forth between this item and either the Kindle Fire HD or the Nexus. If you want to use the pen, have a rear camera, and card storage, then this item is a no-brainer. If you want something to consume media, then the Kindle Fire HD has the best screen I have ever seen in this size package. The Nexus was the least expensive, was easy to carry also, but I was hooked on the S-pen of the Note and needed a camera for my work.With all that said, the only thing holding me back was the $399 price.

The Note is fast and has a vivid screen.  I got the wifi version only and upgrading it was very easy.  Several goodies came with the Samsung Note registration, like $25 to use at the Play Store and $50 to use at Samsung WatchOn.  If I had known this, I would not have agonized nearly as much about spending the money for this tablet.The only downside was that the screen started to fail after a week and showed colored blocks.  I thought the upgrade or some app was the culprit.  Samsung support was good and after trying a few things, I ended up resetting the Note back to factory settings.  This seemed to work for a few days and then the issues started again.  I worked with Samsung support and saw that pressing the screen was now making it change colors.  Now I knew this was a hardware issue.  Support sent me a link to print the label and shipping was free.  It took less than a week to get the Note fixed and returned (fortunately I live close to a service center).  The Note has worked great since.  One other downside was that I added a 64GB micro SD card and forgot to remove it before sending it in.  The card was not supposed to be touched but it was removed and not returned.  I called Samsung and they promised to send an AMEX gift certificate that will basically cover the cost of the SD card.

Photo shop touch is not here unlike on the 10.1 and video editor isn't either,  video editor is available via samsung's app store (free) and photo shop touch through play store for a very high 9.99! One of this units highlights is the ease of charging through micro b usb , it's always been a hassle on 10.1 with it's proprietary cable to charge with anything other than a wall adapter!

This is my second Galaxy Note 8 device, as the first device arrived with defects and was returned.

Six months later, I purchased the Galaxy S III and I was captivated by its potentials.  Upon reading the specs and various reviews for the Note 8.0 Wi-Fi, I was impressed.  The first notable item was replacing the 30-pin proprietary charging plug with the micro USB which effectively simplifies the process!  The second element was the dramatic improvement to the S-pen over the 10.1 which makes writing smoother and elegant.  The convenient storage and accessibility when needed in the body of the tablet enables it to be ergonomically clean.  The size of the Note 8.0 is ideal - not as \"small\" as the 7.0 or a large as 10.1.  One word can easily sum it up - mobility.  Yes, it not a direct replacement for a laptop or ultra notebook but, it certainly gets about 90 percent of my work done.  The third factor is the Smart Stay which keeps the screen on as you are looking at it.  This feature negates you from having to constantly touch the screen in order for it not to time-out as in the Tab 2 7.0.With regards to the display of the screen, it still manages to be vivid despite it not being an Amoled.  Colors appear to be true, natural and not washed out when watching movies on Netflix and Vudu.  The processor is fast as I have not experienced any lags and the transitions thus far have been flawless which also makes multi-tasking a great asset to this tablet.  The only negative comment would be the battery life.  It is anticipate that with the 4.2 update this should improve.

One Note is OK as well but I'd rather have the option to convert my handwriting to text when I want to, not all the time.

Otherwise, it is an excellent upgrade to an older one.  From what I've used of the iPad mini, the Note 8.0 is a worthy competitor (IMHO).I won't bore you with a list of specs that you can find online with a simple search.  I'll give you what I liked and didn't like.  Everyone's experience will be different.  As always, I encourage you take a list of what you intend to use the tablet for then make a trip to your local store and testit out for yourself.These are my initial impressions:What I really like about it...-Lightweight, yet sturdy in feel.-Bright, vivid colors.  Excellent resolution.-S Pen is excellent for drawing/handwritten notes-Size is perfect for holding with one hand.-GPS-Powerful processor and plenty of memory.  Haven't had issues in video playback with a dozen apps running.-mSDHC allowing the OPTION to carry around a multitude of files and apps-Responsive touch screen.-Includes Polaris Office-S Calendar seems to work better.-My Note 2 S pen works on this as well and vice-versa.-Samsung includes a Swype like keypad.What I didn't necessarily like...-Sound is so-so, as expected from a tablet this size and this thin.-Price.  Comparable to the iPad mini in spec and price...SUMMARY:  If you're looking for a well constructed tablet that provides Play store access, a stylus for that tactile experience, excellent video and extra features such as GPS and mSDHC AND have $400 to boot, then this is your tablet.

Performance is flawless and I have experiences no glitches of any kind.  I got the Samsung note mostly because of the note/stylus feature and also because, unlike almost every other tablet out there, it has an SD slot so you can add up to 64 GB more storage.  By comparison, the iPad mini with 64 GB of built-in storage will run you about $500 and if the note feature of the Samsung is important to you then you will be missing out on that too.  So when you compare this tablet with others, make sure you are comparing machines with the same features or the comparison will not mean much.My only regret is that I didn't just go ahead and get the 10.1 (2014 edition) version since the 8.0 can be a bit small at times.  The trade off is the fact that the 8.0 is a bit more portable and of course lighter but I think I would have rather have traded the slight loss of portability for the extra screen size.  If you are considering an 8\" tablet, give this some thought.  Its not like you can put the 8.0 in your pocket anyway so you don't lose a whole lot by stepping up to the larger size (other than the increased price, of course.)

Joab\"", "ReviewID": "R3L6P2YO6EPUSX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I went into this tablet with the highest of hopes. I really wanted an Android tablet that could truly replace my trusty iPad.When I opened the box, the first thing I noticed was this beautiful white plastic and glass staring back at me. Looks nice. I picked it up, and it felt good in the hands, so i plugged it in and let it charge before turning it on.Once I turned it on, things became messy. I noticed an inconsistent user interface even upon startup. Some screens were obviously Samsung designed, while others were obviously designed by Google. The Samsung screens asked me to sign up for a Samsung account. I figured I better do that, I'll probably need it later. After sign up, it then prompts me oddly as to whether I want to backup and/or restore from my Samsung account. Being a brand new account, there would be nothing to restore, so I selected \"backup\". It then warned me everything on the server missing from my device would be erased if I continued. How disjointed.I was approaching the end of setup, and it now asks if I want \"easy mode\". Wait, what's easy mode? There was a oddly worded explanation that I really didn't get, so I went ahead with easy mode. I knew this would be different than my experience with the Nexus 7, since that device is a \"true Google\" device and I had heard there were some differences.As it came up to the desktop, I was impressed with the screen quality. I feel like it was definitely a little better than the iPad mini's, but maybe a little over saturated on the colors. I tried out a few of the in-device apps and felt underwhelmed so far. I bought this with a primary desire to write notes using the stylus; I found the stylus not much better than my Bamboo stylus for the iPad, although it was easier to write with. However, my hand kept hitting the back and even with the stylus in my hand, it kept bring up this menu. I found a trick online to turn the device upside down and use it that way, and that definitely made things better.I wanted to use Sketchbook Pro, so I purchased and downloaded that from the Google Play store. It worked well, but nothing tremendous. The pressure sensitivity seemed off; it was either light or dark, and there didn't seem to be a lot of pressure levels in between. Having used Bamboo and Intuos tablets before, I expected better from a Wacom digitizer.I tried out the handwriting recognition in place of the keyboard; I found that to be extremely unreliable. If I have to stop after every word to make sure it recognized it correctly, then it is useless. I will admit, my hand writing is rather atrocious, but not completely illegible. It would present words that weren't even close to what I wrote sometimes. Other times it put extra periods in.It was really cool that when I was at the home screen, it would present a notes screen when I took the stylus out if its holder. To me, that was awesome that it was designed to detect that.The voice on their Siri/Google Now replacement, S-Voice, is atrocious. It sounds like someone was running Siri down a drain and threw on the disposal unit for good measure. I would have preferred it just default to Google Now instead... but I couldn't find anything in the settings to minimize the awful Samsung supplied layers.I would say my biggest concern when buying the device also turned out to be my most obvious as I held it. It had a good weight, nice and light, but not too light. However, every time I shifted my hand a little, I heard a squeak. I couldn't figure out what it was at first, so I went into settings to figure out what was making the noise. Turns out, it was the plastic rubbing against itself at the seams. Unfortunately, this plastic device was flexing and bending and squeaking like nobodies business. I am not adverse to plastic devices, as I own a Nokia Lumia 920, but this was horrendous. The back with slight pressure would push in slightly, and just holding the device or picking it up caused the squeaking of the plastic. I felt if this was a under-$300 device, this type of build quality would be acceptable... but to charge a $70 premium over the iPad mini and to have such poor build quality to me was unacceptable.I didn't like this device, but I am certain it is a good device for some. My ideal device is a true Android Jelly Bean interface, a solid construction with no squeaking seams, a good responsive active stylus, and a consistent interface. Right now, that just isn't this device, or any Android tablet on the market right now. I really wanted an excuse to leave the iPad behind, but this wasn't it. I look forward to the device that wins me over.", "Title": "Close, But Not There", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Author": "Ms N. Boone", "ReviewID": "R1ISZWNAFKYN6C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE:I own the iPad 3, the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7\" and this tablet.  Unless streaming Prime movies on the Fire HD 7\", the Note 8 had become my \"go to\" tablet, while my poor iPad sat ignored.  I did ultimately buy a Kindle Paperwhite 2nd Gen for reading, because tablet batteries run down too fast if one is a heavy reader.  My Galaxy Note 8 is still working perfectly, it's still quite a nice tablet, and it's still the best (perhaps only) option if you desire pen functionality.Despite my abysmal Samsung customer service experiences, I actually broke down and replaced my iPhone 4 with a Galaxy Note 3, and it is amazing. As in BEST.  PHONE.  EVER. So these days I rarely use ANY of my tablets.  I use my Note 3 for pretty much everything except reading eBooks (love my Kindle Paperwhite), and of course my PC is for more intensive tasks.The pen functionality in the Note 3 is superior to the Note 8.  Assuming second generation Note 8 models incorporate that improved pen functionality/integration and offer a higher screen resolution, they could very well be the 7-8\" tablet to beat.  I personally recommend waiting for the next-gen Note 8 if you're in the market for a penabled 8\" tablet. If you also need a new phone, get a Note 3 and see if you even feel the need for a tablet at all.  That said, Amazon tablets are wonderful (especially if you are a Prime subscriber) and I frequently recommend them (Fire HD or HDX depending upon budget) to friends and family.  I also still feel that if one doesn't care too much about the pen, Amazon tablets are a much better buy.Original review:If you really want the \"penabled\" experience in an 8\" form factor, this is the only way to go - if you can get over the risk and hassle of having to deal with Samsung's incompetent customer service, their frequently buggy (and poorly maintained) web site, and the premium price charged for a content consumption device with disappointing screen quality (only 189 ppi).That said, features aside from the pen that recommend this product include:- The extra screen real estate of an 8\" screen over a 7\" screen- The ability to use Samsung's \"split screen\" Multi-view mode (only works for certain apps)- The bundled apps; some of the S-Pen apps are quite nice (I confess I rarely use them), while others are simply bloatware that permanently eat your storage space unless you root the device.- $25 Google Play credit - IF you can get them to fulfill it.  It took me months, multiple attempts to register, and finally contacting them four times via various methods.  No FaceBook to publicly call them to task, no love.- 50 GB Free Drop Box (limited duration of two years)- Micro-SD slot - although bear in mind that you won't be able to actually install most applications there unless you root your tablet (I have not).  Still, nice for music/movies/photos/eBooks.If you don't feel the pen or dual-app/split screen functionality are \"must haves,\" then honestly, save money and consider the Kindle Fire HD 7\".  It has a better screen (216 ppi), better speakers, better battery life AND it costs WAY less (plus, free eBook loans with Prime!). Amazon has always treated me well, so I have nothing but praise for their customer service.  If the Kindle Fire HD 7\" isn't pretty enough or you don't like the Amazon App store (and don't want to root), consider the iPad Mini.  Still compromising on the screen (it's even slightly worse than the Note 8 at 163 ppi - shame on Apple!), but it's also somewhat less expensive, has a beautiful, svelte aluminum body - and Apple *also* has amazing customer service.  I can't speak to the customer service, but the (sorry Amazon) Nook HD is also a nice 7\" tablet, actually has the best screen in the 7\" form factor (243 ppi), Google Play Store access (no rooting required, although it's possible if you desire), includes a micro-SD card slot, and is going for fire sale pricing.  On the minus side, the Nook HD has a proprietary charge port - but you can stock up on spare charge cables with all the money you save.If you plan to read a lot of eBooks and don't also have or want an e-ink reader, consider going for the Kindle Fire HD - or better yet the higher PPI Nook HD (you can always download the Kindle app) - your eyes will thank you for it.", "Title": "4.5 Stars for the Tablet itself, 1 Star for Samsung Support", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Author": "Lopro23 \"Lopro23\"", "ReviewID": "R1ATPX59NJL26H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had to return this tablet mainly because of the cost/benefit ratio.

There is such a great feel to the touchscreen and the way it allows you to move back and forth within the applications. However, as much as I wanted to like this product and learn how to work it I continue to have difficulty. I purchased it approximately two weeks ago and have worked with it for short periods everyday. The purchase was made so that I could keep it at the office and watch my favorite show on Amazon Prime during lunch break. (I can do this on my IPAD) as well as take notes during meetings.I quickly found watching my programs on Amazon Prime wasn't an option as you need Adobe Acrobat in order to watch TV, movies or video particularly from Amazon Prime (almost unlimited TV, movies with my $80/year membership). Unfortunately, this system isn't compatible with Adobe. So, I tried searching the internet for a fix and found a suggestion to download \"MX Player\"  which would supposedly give me the ability to play any video. Oops, didn't work....still can't play TV or movies unless I purchase them from Google Play. Okay, so nix that. How about I concentrate on the note taking feature with the app S Note. I figure I can still use the pad to take notes during our companies endless meetings.Well, the S Note application would be wonderful to take notes in if I could just figure out how to work its many features. The basics of writing on the pad are obvious. But, getting too much further than writing and flipping to a new page starts to get a little more complicated. So that's when I started looking, in earnest, for a user manual since my search through the internet wasn't yielding much help. Voila, I googled and found the user manual on-line by searching through Samsung's website. (It was hidden pretty deep). Once I found the on-line manual, I also realized there's a user manual on the pad itself. However, since theres no \"search\" option on the Samsung Galaxy Note I didn't actually \"find\" the user manual - I just happened up on it. Okay, so I started browsing through the user manual and found the following helps for S Note: Select a note template, Compose notes, Insert multimedia files, Using productivity tools, Browsing notes, Viewing notes. Great - but nothing on how to Save a note, Change the name of a note, Save to a particular day, event, etc. So that if I need to find my notes from a particular meeting I'm still not sure how to do this. I tried to change the name of a note and couldn't do it. Neither the on-line user manual nor the Samsung user manual helped me with this very necessary feature. While that's frustrating enough,  I'm sure there are even more features I will need help on that hasn't even occurred to me yet - and I don't have time to muddle through and find out how to use the details of this system by trial and error.There are many neat features on this pad. If you have time to play around and figure it out then go for it. If you have $400.00 to spend though, I would suggest an Ipad or Kindle Fire. Either will give you the features you find on this system plus more.
