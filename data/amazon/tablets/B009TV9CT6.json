Will fit in pants back pocket or in my case any pocket of my cargo shorts.  If you want a Jellybean Tab with mobile data this is the one.  Lightning fast with massive storage.  No camera and no phone just ready for work.  Loads all your apps, synchs all your stuff from phone or PC.  Email synchs effortlessly.  Like any Tab it likes to consume electrons from the battery but it charges fast on the a/c charger.  I got an ATT add-on data plan (250 M for $15/mo) but use my network mostly.  If you're on the road and need a full-function Tab this fits the bill.  Big screen, easy to read, great graphics.", "Title": "Full function Tab that fits in your pocket", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Author": "Paul Krash \"pkr45h\"", "ReviewID": "R2T3KVST6TFOV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "just a note for all you nexus 7 shoppers, they only have 3g connections available, *not* 4g no matter what the retailer says.  there are no current plans to have 4g anytime this year (2013). other than no 4g, the Nexus 7 is about the most perfect tablet I've found, and it fits in a large jacket pocket, or easily a packed backpack, and it doesn't weigh much.  it is very responsive and battery life is excellent.  requires a free gmail account for full access to all features.  you can check hot mail, yahoo and other mails with various apps and the built in apps. highly recommended.best,PKrash", "Title": "nexus 7s do not have 4 g! other than that, perfect.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "Kamal Ghazi", "ReviewID": "RA3Q9J28ZXLXH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only wish that I could use Skype with camera with audio in the tablet.

I had previously a kindle fire and loved it, but this is other level! is fast has a front camera, decent speakers and all the easiness of pure android device. The only \"cons\" I have found on it is the phone app is not activate it on the system (actually I've read some versions does it, mine doesn't sadly and I think most of them) and I believe is not a big deal since I'm not willing to switch my phone by this tablet, but given my data plan includes phone minutes, doesn't hurt to have the ability to it if necessary, otherwise it will be 5 stars rate", "Title": "Works like a charm!
