I am a Mom with a passion for quilting and sewing who just wanted a tablet for a great price. I don't give a flip about having to have the latest Apple product and I own an Android phone. So, the direction for me was simple. I did a lot of research though because I am on a budget. I kept seeing the same name pop up in many reveiws for the Le Pan II so I researched it at length. It seemed to have all the features I needed and many I have no idea what to do with. I have had my Le Pan II for three weeks so here's what I know:1. The battery life is great lasting for many hours playing the free music from Google while I sew! I simply search for music I enjoy, download, and play! So very easy! But, I did follow directions and charge the tablet for 8 hours before using the first time.2. The on/off button is easy to use if you follow the directions of holding it down for a few seconds when it has been turned off. Hold it down a short second if it's just sleeping.3. Connecting to Wifi was a breeze and seamless...I just followed the prompts.4. It has amazing map accuracy but unlike my phone it has to be connected Wifi to get the Google Maps.5. I have no idea what light spillage or dead pixels are but I don't think I have any. It has never locked up and plays videos with out pausing.6. The sound is very clear and loud even nested inside the Targus Case.7. I find the serial plug into the tablet works just fine and because it has USB charging/wall plug I can plug it into my lap top to transfer documents and pdf sewing files.8. I could have bought it from Best Buy but the price was better on Amazon.9. The instruction page that comes with it is very brief but I printed out the Pdf instruction file and it covers a the rest and is easy to read and follow.10. This tablet is super fast and responsive and so far it has surpassed my expectations.Anyway, I have surfed the internet, bloged, watched videos, read Pdf files, books, have checked all my Email accounts on one page for easy viewing, I am still learning new things this tablet can do.", "Title": "Perfect for me!", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Author": "Pink Breadsticks", "ReviewID": "R2E5GV3LI8I5CG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update after 6 months:Use of this quadrupled by many more friends and family members. I can never keep the battery charged long enough to use it myself. So the charger cable finaly wore out a month back and it was easily and quickly replaced free of charge with no hassle by the manufacturer. The new cable is designed better and I feel it should last for years. Customer service is beyond compare. And here is the real deal that makes this the best tablet you can buy. I came home a while back and my tablet screen was shattered. I dreaded what that meant for my family. Hey we lost our pride and joy here. I contacted the manufacturer in the hopes of purchasing a replacement screen and be able to afford the cost. I feared the cost would be near as much as a new tablet. The company never even asked me what happened or offered me options for repair service. They just said \" no problem\"  \"send it back\" \"we'll send you a new one\" and they did rather super fast and I will be forever loyal to this manufacturer. Any other product they produce will become a member of my household. Now imagine any other tablet pc competitor when you call and tell them you have a cracked screen? Better have your cedit card ready huh?My opinion is based upon daily heavy use of this tablet pc. When I say heavy use, I mean many different users of all ages & experience for many hours at a time. And in all types of environments. This tablet has been stepped on, dropped, rained on, and even jumped on by the family pet. It has been operated at high & low temperatures.Now my initial reaction, not ever having much experience with a full touchscreen tablet pc (only my phone) was amazing. The thing that amazed me the most, (and still does) is the ability to have the whole world in the palm of your hands or fingertips with GoogleEarth. It was the best app I downloaded. Even my aged relatives who have been technilogically impaired or scared of computers took right to this thing and didn't want to give it back. There was no need for dexterity with a mouse since their fingers controlled the action.As for battery life, I realized with more use the battery seemed to drain more and more quickly after the first 2 weeks. But now at 6 weeks the battery seems to have found some new life and is holding up better than when first used. Although I must say I do not like the heat generated by the charger. It gets too warm for my tatse so I continually have to keep a check on the plug while charging.Also, I realized as an added bonus that my Motorola Karma pc cord fit perfectly in the charger base and allowed me to charge my phone with no issues.As stated by another user there was a ghost light up in the upper top left corner of my screen upon initial use. This light has spread somewhat and a new ghost light has showed up in the opposite corner after 4 weeks of use. It has to be quality control issue when the screen was sealed since I also have 2 tiny black specks sealed into my screen from the factory. Maybe they made these things too fast or for whatever reason, it's internal operating system makes up for the blemishes.It opens, streams, and downloads movies, webpages etc FASTER than my Sony Vaio PC. I have never experienced such instant speed while surfing the net. I noticed I was continually losing wi-fi connection but determined it not related to the tablet since all tests from other wi-fi sources in the house lost connection at the same time.Applications install & unistall instantly with no effort or trouble. I love how you open your fingers to make pages, words, or photos larger or squeeze them together to make smaller. And that you can have more than one home screen. Even though it's not actually a phone you can make calls via google talk and even video calls which we tested. Awesome!I found a case Lucky Brand Ipad Silicone & Flip book Style that fit this perfectly. The silicone case has a notch I cut out for the charger port and it made my day!I agree the power button is too small and very annoying and hard to operate. But now that I have this, I wouldn't trade it for nothing! I don't think I have been interested in the desktop or laptop since this arrived. Actually I never thought about using anything else to connect once I used this thing. It's brilliantly designed, inexpensive compared to other tablets, user friendly, loveable, and so much fun!Maybe if it was an official ipad the kids wouldn't have been allowed to carry it around so much or it wouldn't have been left in the middle of the floor. But then it would have been put high on a hog, and always been taboo for our family. This thing becasue of it's price was treated differently and in so doing allowed us to realize it full potential and worth! So when it was stepped on we cringed, but didn't get hysterical. When it was left in the rain we gasped but didn't lose our breath. When it was dropped on the concrete time stood still but we didn't seem to notice. And when the dog jumped on it and tried to dig a hole in the screen we just laughed and patted him on the head! Honestly, it has held up well and suffered no visible damage. So when the kids come in from their mud fight and want to use the tablet to take a pic of themselves I'll be sure to wash it off along with children afterwards!", "Title": "6wks Heavy Use Review! Very Surprised! 6mo w/ update", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Author": "Ted Rosauro", "ReviewID": "RCY4HIADC0PD7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With specs close to the Ipad, the LePan TC970 is an excellent buy for half the price. And now that Walmart has a price rollback, I made the decision to compliment my smartphone with a tablet. The biggest difference between these two gadgets is the screen size and resolution, everything looks bigger and more visible on the tablet. But that comes at a price of portability, it is meant to be used indoors and sunlight will make the screen totally unviewable. But other than some minor complaints, this table is worth every penny.Here's a list or pros and cons that I've managed to collect in the short period of usage, I've spent most of it downloading apps and enjoying the new features and capabilities of my new toy. One reason I bought this is to install the Skype software which provides for voice and video conversations throughout the world. So with that said, let's go on with the list:Pros, The Good:Price - Amazon's price beats everyone.Quality - Much, much better than the cheap competition.Size - Just right and very slick, the dust cloth comes in handy.Ipad Screen - The 9.7 screen and 1024x768 res is a standard for tablets.Fast Wifi - Wireless connection and speed are both easy and fast.Working GPS - No antenna cables here, the built in chip works like the phones.Working Bluetooth - Great for pairing headphones and file transfers.512mb memory - Not the stingy 256mb found on other models.2g internal memory - More apps to load, no more out of memory messages.32g SD card max - You want more storage, just buy a 32g micro sdhc and you're set.AccelerometerAmbient light sensorFront facing camera and microphone for video call/chat.Settings behind status bar dropdown, very convenient.2g internal storage expands non-SD apps capacity. A big plus for apps that cannot move to SD.Ambient light sensor controls screen brightness. Saves the battery.Screen is very sensitive to the touch, a fly could probably land on it and cause unpredictable results.Most apps designed for the Ipad will probably feel at home on the LePan because of the same screen and resolution.Cons, The Bad:No manual, learn by trial and error. I haven't checked the [..] website yet.Very narrow handles cause fingers to touch sensitive screen.Accidental hit of back button very annoying. Wish those handles would extend out for better grip.Comand button lights not controlled by ambient light sensor, hard to see in the dark.SDHC chip slot location very awkward, huge closure tab gets in the way. Bad design.Hardware buttons are not labeled, must grope to locate.Back button should not be too sensitive to the touch, it will exit the app in progress. Extremely annoying.Still lack compatibility with some tablet apps due to hardware and software differences. Mostly video games that demand faster graphics chips like the Nvidia Tegra. Also the later version of the Android OS provides more features found in more expensive tablets.", "Title": "Great Gift For The Holidays", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Author": "CK \"CK\"", "ReviewID": "R24U5U1604N1BH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This tablet is great but has WiFi issues.  Tried on several networks, always connects way slower than all other devices on same network.Youtube is especially painful.  On a friend's network, me having this tablet and my friend having an Ipod, we started at the same time the same Youtube video (me in standard definition 360p, and my friend in HD).  She was almost done with the HD video, and I was still in endless initial buffering of my 360p version.I would love to love this tablet, but what's the point if WiFi is not working well.Buyer beware!

It is a very nice unit, I especially like the microphone button built into the virtual keyboard.  I bought this for my son, I have an iPad2.  This does everything the iPad2 does except perform well on the network.  As a senior engineer of XXX, I am well schooled in WiFi and understand the technology.  I have tested the throughput on 4 different Access points.  What I notice is that when connected, the connection speed rarely matches the actual connection speed ( not a problem with other devices). As an example it will show 1Mbs when in fact my iPad2, my 2 lenovo laptops and my HP laptop all connect at 54Mps.  Even when it does connect at 54Mbps, the actual throughput using several tools and test sites ( speedtest.com / speakeasy.com / Vudu speedtest...) rarely exceeds 1 MBps.  In fact, the upload speed is normally faster.  I read through the FAQs, spoke to LePan tech support, this is not an issue on my end.  I have tried WEP, WPA ( I would not reccomend this- the Le Pan does not see a constant signal vis WiFi alalyzer available from amazon marketplace) LEAP and open.  All exhibit the same on both my home and work networks.  I have on occasion seen it spike to 5-6MPs, but it is rare and I cannot pin point what it is that allows it to occasionally ( 1-25 maybe connects) to download at the capability of the access point and network allow.  I spent 10 hours changing settings, routers, turning off GPS, encryption, channels, downloading updates, stood next to the Access point, you name it, I tried it.  I sure hope they fix this as its is a clear winner for the price ( I did not but it through Amazon as they are on backorder).If you don't care about streaming high quality video and connection speed is unimportant- you cannot go wrong with this.  As another person pointed out, the CaseCrown case fits perfect and is on sale now.  I cannot give this the 5 stars it deserves becuase of this poor download speed issue, it is a deal breaker for me.  IF Le Pan does not come through before my 30 day window is up, I will be returning this for another brand.  Its inexcusable to offer a new product when the original had WiFi connection issues and now this one suffers from WiFi performance issues.  Who tests this stuff?

Hopefully they provide an upgrade to the OS soon. I guess the dead pixels on the display come with the rather low price point. Something's gotta give.Hope this helps to make your buying decision.

I was only wanting to spend around 300 on a Tablet..it was starting to look like a lost cause finding one that would do/have everything I wanted for that price.  Then I found this LE PAN 2!!!!  I'm soo thankful for all the reviewers here on Amazon for their wonderful reviews...you guys rock!!!  I see NO reason to spend a couple hundred more bucks on any other tablet and this one will do it all.My le pan came in yesterday and I did what lots of peeps suggested...let it charge completely before trying it out.  I never would have thought this tablet would be so resonpsive.  I touch something and instantly it does it.  The touch screen is right on.  I'm using it now to write this review...even on Amazons small search box, tapped it one time and it hit it right on.  The keyboard has no lag time, I type it does it.Switching between websites is just as fast as with my laptops.  Every web page I've thrown at it, it loads it right up.  I'm not having any of the WiFi issues that others are talking about.  Every time I've checked my connection it was on 54m...only one time it showed 36, but both my kids were on their computers watching YouTube vids, so don't know if that had anything to di with it or not??The android market is great!! Lots of free games/ apps on there.  They all downloaded as as fast as my iPod does apps with iTunes.  I tried a few YouTube vids myself on this and only one of them stopped to buffer one time...not a problem...press pause wait a bit then resume...no biggie!!Used the connector that came with it to hook it up to my laptop to see about adding some music...no problems there..loaded right up.  Haven't tried any loading any movies onto it yet though..not really sure what format they should be in??  Is it mp4??  If someone knows, please leave me a comment to let me know.I really don't see why people are complaining about the finger prints on this tablet...I mean, really...it IS a touch screen...it's going to get your prints all over it.  It only takes a few seconds to wipe it clean.Again, most of their more negative reviews for this tablet is because of WiFi issues...I have had none...so not for sure what the problem is for others??All in all a great tablet..if you can get your hands on it...Buy one!!!!", "Title": "Great Tablet!!!", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Author": "simplerRev", "ReviewID": "R5HXOBWCZN970", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off just let me say I have been wanting to get my hands on a tablet for months after my girlfriend got an IPad 2.

The screen is sharp, web browing is quick and easy.  Videos stream clear and fast.  I love the fact that the adroid market offers so many free apps for pretty much anything you are looking for.My Conclusion of the matter is:I would rather have this tablet over an Ipad and it was 50% cheaper than the least expensive IPad 2 on the market as I got mine for $250.00.

Only cons I have are minor and easily fixed if the company wants to do so. Android 2.2, only 500mb internal ram with 2GB sd card, and screen locked in landscape mode on Home Screen. I upgraded to a 16GB sd card so now have ample storage, and flashed a new firmware from the maker that improved screen responsiveness even more.

I wanted to order the leather case with the keyboard that amazon recommends buying for this tablet, but i believe the keyboard is only compatible with a usb port.

I am actually contemplating returning the unit, it has a bright spot of light about 1/4\" wide on the screen in the left center of screen like the tft screen is worn away there, so starting off with a defect. I come pre-biassed because I bought a Asus EEE Transformer Honeycomb tablet and ordered the base laptop for it. I was online and saw this, because I could not justify spending almost $600 on a tablet + base so I was going to return the ASUS. However after comparing the 2 I have to say the ASUS wins hands down. The ASUS is only $399 (without base), this one is $349. I do not like Honeycomb and thought I would get a tablet with Froyo but the ASUS screen is SO MUCH MORE CRISP. I will say the screen is very crisp and has VERY wide viewing angles on the Le Pan, but any video I play I see pixilation and bluryness as the processor is not a dual core. The quality of the resolution on the Le Pan is not as good. I do have a fast N connection and get better video on other tablets. The ASUS pad has it's own issues with video and I hate Honeycomb so far, but I cannot justify spending $50 less and getting a tablet (Le Pan) that is NOT widescreen (9.7) 4:3 ratio and so far has no real history or support. I dont want to be stuck with a tablet that 6 months down the road, the company will not exist or support updates. I will say the unit does play Angry Birds well, so other games should not be a issue. As others have said Netflix does not play out of the box. The few things this tablet has going for it, is long battery life, GREAT viewing angles, it DOES fit most generic ipad cases very well and it is fairly light with good build quality. I dont know why they chose to put the charger port at the top of the unit though. Overall the unit is good if you just want something that works and fairly good quality that mimics the ipad shape.

I purchased my tablet on Feb 3rd and received it around the 10th. I decided to wait a little while before making any comment to see if the tablet might produce some glitches after regular use. So far there have been no glitches noticed.I originally owned the Samsung 7 inch G-tab. The Samsung had all the bells a whistles but the reduced screen size was a major disadvantage for me because I wanted to use my tablet to read from during sermons and speeches. My first experience with the Android tablets revealed that the tablet functions were basically the same as my android cell phone. They basically will not do anymore than your phone is capable of doing (just a larger screen). The tablet really doesn't work well (for me) when trying to produce projects like papers, art, video editing, spread sheets, or Power Points. You can do some manipulations on projects, but nothing serious. The biggest advantage of the tablet for me is portability, screen size verses a phone, gaming, reading, videos, and making presentations. Armed with this knowledge I sat out to find the best tablet for the money.After hours of research (in my humble opinion) the La Pad tablet is by far the best for my wants. The picture quality is above reproach. The processing speed outstanding. The screen resolution... fantastic. The 4.3 screen layout is preferred over the 16.9 aspect ratio, unless you are looking at a movie. Basically, what I am trying to say is that this tablet will serve you just as well if not better than any other at twice the cost.Last words...I would advised you to educate your self before making any purchase. Write down the most important purposes for your purchase, determine if it can really do what you need it to do and to the extent needed, and then find the best product for your hard earned dollar.", "Title": "Great Tablet for 4 months", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2YVSOVJCLK5UQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Everything good that has been written about this tablet is true, but ....the firmware implementation of WIFI communications is not robust.

I guess they are working it it.BACK TO GOODWith that said I must admit that it is an amazing tablet.  Its fast, responsive,  oh yeah and it automatically corrects my spelling when I type, whey 2 go Le Pan.

That is the biggest reason I purchased the Le Pan because it was less than half the price.  It is a similar size to the iPad and I like its size compared to the smaller 7 inch tablets.  It feels more substantial and has a solid build quality.  You can  use it to run Netflix, Amazon Prime videos, and it runs just fine on other video sites like Youtube.The biggest complaint that I've seen about this tablet is that it is running Android 2.2 (one of the most stable of the Android operating systems) and that it cannot be upgraded.  Initially that worried me too until I started looking at the Android marketplace and found that most Android apps and games will run on Android version 1.x .  I had to think to myself that by the time Android 2.2 becomes outdated, I'll be able to buy another more current tablet again for around $200 or so bucks and still have paid less than $600+ today for a 32gb iPad 2 which will also be obsolete by the time my Le Pan is...hmmm...makes sense to me to own this tablet with an upgraded 32GB mini SD card for under $250 than to pay over double that price for an iPad or any of the other 32 GB Android tablets currently on the market that are priced much higher.This tablet easily handles email, video, music , android games, and microsoft office applications with an office app.  I'm even writing this review by speaking it into the android speak to text application.  I do not know of another tablet that can do everything this one can for this low of price and I searched everywhere.By the way, it's awesome to have a tablet in standby mode (It can go a couple days in standby before needing recharged) that you can quickly turn on to jump online or check email!  For the money it really is a no-brainer.  If you want to switch out the micro SD card for a larger one,(comes with a small 2GB card)just copy the contents of the 2GB card onto one that is up to 32Gb in size and voilla you're ready to go.Also the Targus Truss Leather Carrying Case for Apple iPad works well with the Le Pan if you're looking for a cover that fits well, plus it has a built in stand.", "Title": "Doing what a Tablet Should", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Author": "David P.

(And it does have them) this device is very prone to Freezing. There is a reset button on the back of the device under power that will get you running again.Sometimes you might run into an issue with it freezing if you connect it to your pc (Also Your PC will not charge your device it must be from the 2.0A wall charger an ipad charger outputs about the same and a ipad cable can work if you shave down alittle of the plastic sides ON THE END OF THE CABLE not the device alternatively inside the power jack on the lepan there is a tiny metal tab that you can bend back and the normal ipad cable will fit without shaving anything.) If you go under settings/application/development and check mark (Stay Awake) that should stop it from freezing from usb to pc hookup.Some users have had the device go to sleep and not want to turn back on (Sometimes the lepan needs you to press and hold the power button the hit the reset before releasing the power) under settings/display/screen timeout set it to 30 minutes and put it to sleep manually.For those of you who now have a paper weight (Device won't turn on no matter what and you're out of warranty) this device seems to have a weak battery jack. My lepan was second hand and I was having all sorts of issues (Device was freezing it would not charge fast/right had problems turning on etc.) I decided just to check the battery. So I got a little Philips head and flat head screw driver (Under the micro sd tab THERE ARE TWO SCREWS THAT MUST BE REMOVED carefully disconnect the back cover from the lepan I find the far end (Away from the power button) to be the easiest place for me to start (The hold switch and volume key can come out so be careful) the battery jack is located on the side the power button is.

However, price is not all that matters with these things and it really depends on what you use it for and overall quality.I don't regret the purchase, but people who are used to consumer ready products and don't like to hack, figure things out, etc should stick with Galaxy or iPad.Advantages:- Great price- Solid qualityDisadvantage:- Lack of accessories. Even basic ones such as USB OTG or HDMI connector.- Touchscreen sometimes has trouble with pattern unlock (this may be more my product or my fingers though)- Lacks back camera (I didn't think this would be a problem, but it's something I would like to see). I knew this buying it though and it's negated with the price.General:This is very well built. I'm pleased with the way it feels and it works as I expected (if you have an android phone, it's basically a big giant phone). I had no problems installing Android Applications. Any disadvantages with the software are inherent with the software and not with the tablet.The manufacturer's website is very sparse with information. If you want any significant information you have to search for it and find what others have to say about it.Performance:I use it mostly for PDF reading. It's pretty slow for large files on any number of reading devices. However, it displays small files very well. I use it for double column journal articles and it's big enough (for me) to read it in \"fit screen mode.\" This is true of both Adobe Reader, Aldiko, and one other reader I forgot the name of and have since uninstalled.I installed an unofficial version of VLC player (noneon version) and it works great. No complaints there.Software:It's pretty bare... but that's how I like it. Unlike my Samsung Epic 4G, it's not filled with bloatware and I can install many of them.This is a big plus for me and I've installed all the applications I normally like without any bugs.Applications (known) that I use that work great: Google Voice, Skype, Kindle Reader, Aldiko, Facebook, Firefox, eBay, VLC, Tivo, Wikipedia.The Adobe Reader does strange things when you change stretch/zoom in view settings. For me, if I change it while reading a PDF it escapes out and goes back to the main adobe file selection screen. This may be software though.Networking:It doesn't accept ad hoc connection (unless you root it). I found out this is common to most mobile devices not just Le Pan. The device doesn't seem to have a problem finding my network at home but it does seem to have a hard time finding new networks when I go to Starbucks, Barnes and Nobles, etc (or other restaurant with free Wifi). It's not a huge problem, but it takes a while to find new networks.Bluetooth is slow... It's slower transferring files than my Samsung Epic 4G and a Treo. However, I don't do much with Bluetooth anyway and the mouse I installed works fine and was easy to install.Accessories:Horrible support. This is a relatively new product and it's not from one of the big manufacturers, but it misses some of the basic accessories that they should have made pre-launch. I can say this because I'm an electrical engineer and I've checked their the circuit diagram they submitted to FCC,... there should be no reason they shouldn't have had their HDMI adapter ready at launch.Does not have a 30-pin connector to USB connector. I would have liked to see them come outAlso, regarding accessories, they are difficult to find. You have to send an e-mail to customer support and pay $10 shipping to receive a cable.Their products aren't compatible with any other tablet device. Some iPod chargers work if you shave a piece of plastic off though.Summary:Overall, if you can do without the HDMI or connecting to external USB devices this is an excellent product. The company promises to bring these out, but many new companies break promises.

The overall speed, ease of use, memory utilization and general operation is outstanding. There are, of course, some down sides, but these are minor compared to the overall operation.  The quick start instructions fail to tell you that you have to push the power button twice, holding it the second time until it buzzes, to start the tab when the charger is plugged in, this is not true under battery operation. The WIFI tends to be intermittent but this improves with on time. Like all computers, it freezes at times, but defrosts itself with patience, one trick I found to speed this is to flip pages. The included apps, while pretty basic, work well. As is true of most touch screens, fingerprints seem to appear out of nowhere, but are easily removed with the provided dry cloth. The camera being only on the front side is great for video phone calls or video messaging, but not for taking pictures or video, although no worse than the cell phone I have that has the camera only on the outside making video calls a pain.

Purchased this for my wife.  Received on January 21st.  Charged it up, turned it on and it immediately recognized my network.  Typed in the access code and was off and running.  Brought the Le Pan II to my sons house and it immediately recognized his network, also.  It worked flawlessly on both networks.  My son was blown away by this unit and now wants one.  And, he is a long time Android user.  My wife brought it in to work.  One of her colleagues has already ordered one and another is seriously thinking of doing the same.Response time is as good as her Pentium dual core notebook.  Videos from Youtube, Netflix, Crackle, games, etc. all stream smoothly with no hesitation.  I have not experienced poor network connection, jerky or buffering video issues that a couple of posters have mentioned.  And, I'm pretty fussy.  Any issues I have experienced were application specific and had nothing to do with the Le Pan II.  There is a minute amount of bleeding in the corners from the LEDs used to backlight the screen.  But it is not noticeable when playing any video content.  I have the same effect on a 22 inch Samsung LCD TV.  This is truly not even worth mentioning.  But someone raised this point in a previous post.  Placed a video call using Tango.  Video and audio synced well.  The video coming from my sons end was not great, but he has a low res camera and he was in a dimly lit room at the time.  Will have to try again under better conditions.  As others have stated, this unit has a quality feel and the screen is incredible.  Nice touch sensitivity across the entire screen.  The fact that it has GPS capability without the need for 3G network connection is a nice bonus.  It's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capable.  Battery life is great!!!

The tablet showed up from Amazon, and it seemed to do okay for about two months (30-days after the 30-day Amazon warranty expired). I took a chance on this tablet, know this device could be unstable, but I knew I wasn't going to use it very often. As it turns out, I did begin to depend upon it greatly, 6-months after my purchase, it just stopped working. I called Amazon and they referred me to the manufacturer.First things first, let's get the tablet review out of the way. As I said, it seemed to do okay the first 2-months, and then it became unstable. I understood that this operating system was not upgradable to Gingerbread, and I was okay with that.When I say it was unstable, I mean it lost internet connection frequently, forced closing apps, browser issues, etc. I understand that apps can be unstable on any device, but the most annoying was how it would lose internet connection from my Wi-Fi every time I used it. I would have to go through an 8-step series of steps to get back to where I was on the internet after losing connection. My daughter who also has an Android tablet (EVO view) did not suffer the same issues while using her tablet at the very same time. During the time I have owned this device, I have had to perform over five factory reboots.Let's say you were okay with the fact it is a low quality device, maybe you think \"well, it's less than $200, you get what you pay for\", you would be right! The only problem with this is that the customer service for LePan, which is who Amazon referred me to after explaining that there was a manufacturer alert for this product, is equally as unstable as the device they manufacture! I am still not sure why Amazon does not send out alerts on the products you purchase from them, after all, they send you everything else under the that have nothing to do and sometimes everything to do with products you purchase from them.Anyway, Amazon gave me the customer service number to contact LePan, and it took several phones to get through the first time. It was an automated voice recording (not a touch-system), and either it would re-loop the recording over and over again an insane number of times (in English, as well as Spanish), and the finally putting you out of misery by hanging up on you. You should know that during my time dealing with them for three weeks now, I have had repeated situations like this occur.At first, when getting a hold of a human, I explained what was transpiring and they referred me to their web site to fill out a claim form. The only problem with this is that my tablet no longer worked and I did not have access to the internet anymore! The representative explained that the device would have to be replaced, and that I would have to arrange and pay for the return of this device. Just so you are aware and you do not heed the advice in this post, it was over $26 to ship.The first night of making contact with them, my daughter came by with her laptop so I could set up a case to begin the process or the line of communication so I thought. It has been three weeks now, and I still do not have a replacement tablet. I found out through UPS (who are just as bad as LePan), that they had in fact delivered the defective tablet to LePan on the 10th, and still no tablet or sign of a tablet. I have written numerous times within their case system. So far, my inquiries have been met with either silence or silly questions like, \"what is your shipping address\", and in todays phone message \"we have some more questions\". You should know that when I filled out a case, I put in my shipping address, when I shipped the device back; it was tied to an RMA, which included my shipping address. When I shipped the device back, I included a manifest that contained my RMA, the Case # and my (drum roll please) .... Shipping Address!Your take away from this should be: Do not purchase this product because it is poorly manufactured and the vendor is irresponsible and unreliable.You should know that I do not have a negative view against everyone and everything. I am a little baised towards UPS and prefer Fed-Ex or USPS. I purchased from Amazon because of their liberal return policy. DO NOT COUNT ON THAT FOR THIS PRODUCT. I will still purchase from Amazon, but I will try to purchase the more expensive products in person, locally. I have recently purchased and IPad 2 that I am really loving now.

We did not have any issue with Wi-Fi and speed, as reported by some. One star subtracted because of battery (it drains quicker than I expected, and it takes way too long to re-charge).  Camera is also not so good (using it with Skype), but I did not expect anything special.Other than that, Honeycomb is still not as robust operating system and some applications can crash from time to time, but that does not have anything to do with tablet itself.Overall, this is very good alternative for more expensive tablets. For those that are still researching, I can definitely recommend (and by the way, 7 inch tablets are just not big enough, even for casual users).Update (June 14th 2012):Many had problem with this tablet not powering up. I would like to share work-around for that issue, since I experienced it too.Likely cause: It looks that if you leave battery to drain completely, tablet will not be able to charge properly.Effect: As a result of above, tablet appears as dead, even if plugged in chargerWork-around: Use reset button (you will need to use something sharp to press it) to reset tablet while plugged in charger. If needed, unplug and plug charger again.Above works for me, and I can always recover from this issue. Of course, this is kind of annoying, but if you make sure to regularly charge tablet, and not letting it drain completely, it will work just fine.

It is decently powerful, and though it's a bit smaller than most of the 10.1\" tablets out there, you don't miss the extra real estate. My only complaint is that the 32 pin connector is proprietary, so if I ever lose it I'm out of luck - unless I can modify an iPad connector to fit. Some notes:- The GPS is surprisingly accurate. I had this thing tethered to my HTC Incredible (rooted, installed Cyanogenmod 7 - highly recommend doing this), and when I fired it up while sitting in a parking space at my local Home Depot, the blue arrow was over the exact space I was sitting in. I tried it in a few other spots and it was within a couple of meters every time.- The honeycomb interface is slick. Most apps designed for handsets will scale nicely on honeycomb,and a few seem to know they're on a table and adjust their layout accordingly.- You might as well order the HP slate case that everyone else is getting. You won't find a decent quality case at your local big box stores that fits this unit. Get the screen protector too.- Update 3/5/2012 - Yes, you can use an iPad/iPod connector. On the tablets receptacle for the adapter, there is a small metal tab. You can carefully bend this back. it will only very slightly protrude above the openning, and won't interfere with the connector. You can get data and charge all on the same cord. Android coexisting with iOS technology?- Update 4/6/2012 - After using this tablet for a few months, I am still completely satisfied. It is equally adept at work or play. One quirk I discovered: You can't see certain apps in the android market. This is because while it comes with a Market (or \"Play\" as it's now called), the makers of the Tablet haven't registered with the open handset alliance. Therefore, they're blocked from downloading apps. The fix for this? You can \"side load\" apps - eg download them as an APK file, move them onto the tablet and install them that way. You won't be able to get updates from the market for side loaded apps. You'll need to root your tablet, then edit the build.prop file to change the fingerprint of the tablet to something else. This will only affect your market apps, and won't bother anything else. However, you may wind up loading incompatible apps, which can be inconvenient of they cause your tablet to malfunction.", "Title": "Excellent Product", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Author": "B.

I am the \"techie\" in the family and saw how much enjoyment my kids were getting from their iPod Touches that I decided I wanted one myself - just to play around with.  Then reality sank in and I remembered how expensive they were and how I hated typing on them and viewing things on them with my 47 year old eyes.  I quickly vetoed that idea and then ran across this tablet one day.  It was something I thought was the best option for me.While it is not as slick as the Apple products, it is slick enough for me.  I have been able to make use of free apps that I use on a daily basis that help me be more productive both at home and work (I work from home).  I use dropbox, goodle docs, open office viewer, documents to go, springpad, evernote, skitch, mint, youtube, facebook, pandora, sugarsync,flixster, astrid tasks, remind me, assistant, kitchen timer, stopwatch, voice recorder, alarm clock plus, the weather channel, habit streak, gmail, mobo task killer, chore checklist, angry birds, jewels, word search, words with friends, lose it, workout trainer, food planner, adobe reader ,etc.  I am finding I am using this tablet more for productivity reasons (work & reminders) that it probably has already paid for itself in the many little ways it has helped me out.Using the Mobo Task Killer frequently after opening a lot of apps, helps me keep freezing issues at bay for the most part.I wake up with alarm clock plus which lets me customize how I want to be awaken.  I prefer a gentler way of waking up as opposed to standard alarm clocks that wake you up by scaring you to death with their loud buzzing.  Upon waking, I can quickly check the weather with the weather channel app so everyone in the family immediately knows how to dress.  No more turning on the tv and waiting for the weather report to come up.  Time for work, it is a great complement to my pc because I can reference pdf documents on the tablet as I do my work on the PC (thanks to dropbox and adobe reader), and I can check email quickly and easily as well.  Dinner time, I can reference a recipe on the tablet as it stands it the Targus case I got for it (for the HP Touch-fits well), and cook up something new for the family.  After dinner, relax and do some light surfing, reading, video watching, or game playing all while sitting comfortably on the couch.  I've even used the navigation app once just to see how it worked and it works just fine in one direction anyways.  I still print out instructions from my pc, but it's nice to hear a play by play as well.So I got this tablet thinking I would probably never use it all that much, but now that I have it I am using it every single day and for so many reasons.

Some reviewers on here have complained about wifi speed issues, but I've had no problems at all (there may be some lemons out there). You'll want a case for it since it's not easy to hold. It's very well made with a brushed aluminum back...but it can slip out of your hands very easily.The touchscreen is very responsive, no slight delays like I've seen on youtube reviews of the older TC970 (this is the TC979 aka Le Pan II). For smooth app install/purchase, make sure you have a google account.I was listening to music with the installed Pandora software last night through headphones and it sounded wonderful! Some have complained about the external speakers, but what do you expect with a small device like this? Most people use headphones or mp3 players for music anyway. You can easily plug in bigger external speakers like people do with mp3 players via the headphone jack or even bluetooth.Pros: Bright screen, excellent resolution, 4:3 aspect ratio (perfect for web surfing), micro SD card slot for expanded storage up to 32GB (buy one with a a full-size SD adapter or a USB plug that reads micro SD for file transfers) Kingston Flash Card Reader MobileLite G2 USB 2.0 Multi-card Reader FCR-MLG2, not too heavy, Android 3.2 upgradable to 4.0, bluetooth. Plays videos smoothly. Half the price of an ipad.Cons: No USB slot or jack to read thumbdrives, 30-pin connector with no dongles that Le Pan advertises that'll will work for devices such as USB, HDMI & so on (maybe that will change with firmware? Le Pan???) minus 1 star. Fingerprint magnet, a little slippery to hold without a case. Sound not very loud in speakers (there are EQ apps for that though). I have a dead pixel that creates a faint line across the top of the screen. Hoping that won't bother me any worse. A slight bit of light bleeding in the corners on black screens...not very noticeable...but at least it didn't cost $600+!I highly recommend this tablet. If only they would start stocking it again!***UPDATE 1/27/12***I've decided the dead pixel creating the faint line across the screen bothered me enough to do an RMA exchange with where I bought it. So, I'll be tabletless for a while...hope I can handle it :PAlso hoping the new tablet won't have any wi-fi issues like some here are having.***UPDATE 3/01/12***Got the replacement tablet a few weeks ago.Works perfect so far (no dead pixels, wifi works great).

It was missing the SD card, there was no manual/instructions included and the tablet had obviously been previously handled because it was covered in fingerprints. It performed horribly - constantly needing to be reset. I was very disappointed and returned the tablet to Walmart with the intention of purchasing a different tablet. My husband however had since read Le Pan reviews and was confident that if we tried another one from somewhere else it might be different.So I bought a Le Pan from Amazon and it was like a completely different product. Everything that should be included was there and there have been absolutely no problems with it a month later.My husband is a techie nerd and he loves the Le Pan.

On the negative side, it is running Android 2.2 and takes quite a bit of fiddling to get a good collection of apps.

I don't know why because everyone else seems to think this thing has an awesome battery. I have to say, however, that I am satisfied with this purchase so far. I have netflix for movies, pandora for music, comicat to read my comic books, dolphin hd browser for surfing, and kindle for reading. All work great and in high resolution. For news I have Huffington Post, Techcrunch, Pulse, and CNET. They work great, too. Youtube works. The only thing I found lacking was the games. Bejeweled 2, Angry Birds, Cardshark, Peggle, Where's My Water and Cut the Rope worked fine. Other games like Scrabble, Fruit Ninja etc would crash, display half-screen in cell phone mode or in low resolution. Unfortunate, because the screen is so nice and touch is so responsive. For what I need it to do, read books, magazines and comics and maybe listen to some music and watch a video every now and then, I give it four stars.

We were looking for a tablet for my 87 year old mother.. Basic needs were, large easy to see screen, ability to do email, web surfing, and skype.  Did not want to spend $500 on an iPad II ... Good product but just too expensive for this situation.  Originally had what we thought was a great deal on demo model Motorola Zoom at a local retailer but when the time came, the price was higher than we agreed, etc, etc...So we walked and then had to find a solution quickly... 72 hours to be precise!  Started searching online... what did we do before Amazon, eBay, etc.?..Found the Le Pan TC970 ... Met our criteria with a good sized screen.  Limited to Android 2.2 Froyo but I'm reasonably confident my Mother wouldn't know Froyo from Frodo so no worries there... Older simpler interface is actually a good thing in this situation.  Got it online with rush delivery for around $225 and was really impressed.  Is it bleeding edge tech? .. No.  Does it do everything the low to mid range tech level user wants?...YES!  Nice screen and touch sensitivity is good.  Sound is O.K. ... I have a HP Touchpad which has the \"Beats\" sound system and is IMHO the best sound but wait .. It's a tablet not a boom box!  Plug in some ear buds and it sounds as good as a $500+ tablet.  Connected to WiFI out of the box with no issues.  E-mail setup easy.  Latest version of Skype works .. Minor glitch with video on the Le Pan end only for the first 5 seconds, then works great.  Browser is great.  All other functions work as described.  Power connector is a Apple iPad connector and plugs into any USB power source.  All the apps I downloaded from the marketplace worked great.  My 87 year old mother has mastered receiving and sending e-mail, browsing so she can find an listen to Andrea Bocelli singing, and even got Skype vodeo chat working though she keep covering the camera with her thumb :-)For the price, this is a great product.  I don't understand why this product and manufacturer doesn't get more media coverage .. IMHO this is the iPad rival .. Only slightly heavier than my wife's iPad II, great fit and finish with nice sturdy feel (not plastic), does almost as much (and plays flash!), and is half the price!I beleive the new Le Pan II is now out and there are some other models in the pipe from this manufacturer...

I was considering the iPad, but the price was out of reach for me. I happened to stumble accross this one here on Amazon. I read the reviews, watched many videos on YouTube and decided to take the plunge and order it. I thought why not give it a try? Amazon has great return policies. I considered the fact that it was a tablet, and a brand name I had never heard of, so I bought the extended warranty for it as well. I am a Tech, so I figured I could fix it if it broke, but the $60 price of the warranty was a no brainer.  I am very pleased with the overall quality of it so far. It's fast, the screen is great, and it's internal memory is expandible up to 32gb. The build quality is solid and I like the aluminum back. The only thing I found was a little flimsy was the power cord end where it plugs in to the Le Pan. It felt like the plastic end was a little thin and hollow feeling. It picks up my wi-fi signal very well. There is no lag when watching You Tube or Netflix.The only real downfall I see as of right now is the lack of accessories.

I made the purchase on Feb. 8th 2012. Right out of the box it had charging problems but after left charging for over 24 hours it worked fine as long as it was always charged.

No games were ever played on it. It was well taken care of. Well fast forward to 6/25/2012 6:44 PM. My wife hands me the tablet and says it is falling apart. I look at it and the screen is popping up and on the bottom edge the seam is coming apart. I first attempted to call the warranty hotline and was told that all operators were busy and to file a claim online. Well I did that at the e-mail that was provided on their warranty page. I sent a picture in with the email and was referred to open a ticket through the website. I did that and was given a response that the sent my case was being sent to their corporate office.

I would like to talk to someone in person so one of your operators can explain to me why you will not honor your warrenty. This is stated on your website.1.

HOW LONG IS THE PERIOD OF COVERAGE?This warranty is valid for service as follows: one (1) year no charge for parts and labor from the date of purchase.3.

All I want is for you to help fix this problem under your warrenty. I can take close up pictures of every inch it. I do not know why the center of it started to come apart.

If you would like to pay this fee to have your tablet replaced we can process an RMA for you. Please let me know how you would like to proceed from here and if you have any questions.Thank you John L. Collins on 6/28/2012 2:09 PMOkay in the picture you have please indicate where you see pry marks. In the thousands of cases you handled if someone prys apart the case made of plastice there would be pry marks. The only place on the case that is coming apart is shown in the picture. As I have indicated before there is no damage done to the case. The screen came popped up because of.the buldge at the bottom of the tablet. I am smart enough not to pry open a 4 month old tablet. Heck even my 5 year is smart enough not to do that. please tell me of any other way I could have done this and not show ANY damage.LePan Support on 6/28/2012 1:08 PMJohn,Our apologies that you feel this is unjust. Having issued thousands of units, fielded thousands of support cases, and replaced a number of damaged units, none of the previous cases have ever fallen apart as your tablet has. This decision was not made lightly, and we consulted the highest of possible authorities within the company. Their determination was that your tablet appears to have been mishandled, and someone likely attempted to pry the unit open. We can reach no other conclusion based on the picture that you have sent. Once again, our apologies that this is not covered. We can offer you a replacement for a fee of $150. We do appreciate your business, and apologize for not being able to offer anything further. John L. Collins on 6/28/2012 12:58 PMPlease tell me your definition of accidental damage. My definition is that some type of accident has to occur. The tablet has not been mishandled, dropped, thrown, kicked, or any other kind of action that would damage it. There are no scratches, scrapes, chips, or any other damage marks on yje tablet. No games are played on it. It is kept next to my bed where only my wife uses for reading and Facebook. I will not spend $150.00 to repair this when it should be covered by your warrenty. If you will not stand by your workmanship then the only accident on my part is trusting your products and your company. Please decide if you want to keep me as a valued customer and honor you warranty or that you are happy with taking my money this time and the review I will write on Amazon about this product amd your company.LePan Support on 6/28/2012 10:30 AMHello Customer,unfortunately the kind of damage that you've described is not covered under our one year limited warranty, which does not extend to accidental damage.

If you would like to pay this fee to have your tablet replaced we can process an RMA for you. Please let me know how you would like to proceed from here and if you have any questions.Thank youLePan Support on 6/27/2012 4:18 PMJohn,Because we are unable to determine whether or not this is manufacturing error or user error, we are forwarding your case to the corporate office.

The only thing I see wrong is I might need to cut 2 small speaker holes in the inner pad that holds the tablet... but I'll wait to see how it sounds in the case first.I got mine for $3.21 but it looks like when they started getting lots of orders from Le Pan owners they raised their price to $15.21But even at the higher price I still think it's better protection then those folios because it zips closed all the way around. It's very slim and adds almost NO weight to your tablet.I hope this wasn't too long and it helps save someones tablet[...]here is the video of guy testing this case...[...]", "Title": "Need a great case/stand for your Le Pan?

I have had NO PROBLEMS with it other than some of my dislikes from my ealier post.Since writing my initial post, my son (3 years old) watched movies which we transfered over from our computer for much of our 10 hour trip to Ireland (waiting in airports and flights) and it still had about 30% battery life with no additional charging needed. I am sure running wifi and bluetooth would significantly reduce this. Looking for a cheap tablet for entertainment and that you don't mind your kids using, this is one way to go.I have found the apps in the android market for word processing are a little clunky and unfortunatley as a teacher in a school that uses Microsoft Word, the interchange is not so smooth all the time. I can work much quicker (editing, creating, inserting tables, diagrams, etc) using my Lenovo ThinkPad and therefore have not actually used the tablet for work.Initial Reivew (First Few Weeks):Picked this up as a Cyber Monday Week deal from Amazon ($150). Purchased this for more of an entertainment tablet, but still to do a little work email/word processing, etc. Price went back up to $250. I would imagine price will keep dropping after December.Pros:- Cost- Netflix, Facebook, and other apps work great- Came with ICS installed- Easy work around to download and install Adobe Flash Player- Solid build for a cheap tablet- Bluetooth and wifi works as good if not better than my iphone 4, no problems so far as others report.- Easy connection to computer through bluetooth direct connect and also through supplied transfer cable.-Not good/Not Bad:- Battery Life (not the same as other tablets, but I adjusted the setting and can get 6 hours or so of heavy use -- wifi, websurfing, bluetooth (keyboard), netflix and email no problem. But for my needs, I can't imagine needing 6 hours of heavy use very often with out being able to plug in and charge.Cons:- No USB port for plugging in keyboard, USB flash drive, etc. (This was big for me, but have quickly gotten use to the fact that I need to use work arounds).- Tablet WON'T charge connected to USB port in computer.- Hard to find case (see below) and the cases I could find were more expensive compared to same brand for ipad.- Costly replacement cable, planning on being very careful of mine.Note: BEWARE of keyboard/case combinations that Amazon links with the LePan. I read many reviews before buying and many of them either do not work or need modifications. I purchased the Kensington Universal Pro Keyfolio (bluetooth) case and keyboard. A little costly but I have been very happy with this addition. Had it set up in minutes and my tablet works great with all ports/buttons open while fitting snug in the tabs. Maybe not as snug as other brands, but I have not had any slippage or felt uncomfortable with it. It is also easy to pop out when you want just the tablet.

I have had no problems with wifi connections and have tried at about 5 different locations with various types of routers. All apps I have installed seem to work fine. I did have to reinstall Skype once because the video did not work first time around.I added a 32 gb sd card (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G60AD6/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00) which works out fine for adding movies, music and pictures.

For example, after activating from standby and reaching the unlock screen with a pattern, I tried numerous times trying to swipe the correct pattern.  However, for some reason, the touchscreen would never \"maintain\" the line I tried drawing while swiping over the circles.  The line would always \"breakup\" before I could finish the pattern for 4 circles.  It seemed to be skipping from one circle to the next without any continuous connection.  This happened for about 5 minutes, until it finally read my finger swipe correctly and unlocked.  Frustrated, I decided to try a password lock instead of a pattern.  So I put the tablet on standby for a while, reactivated it, and tried putting in my password via the keyboard.  However, whenever I pressed a key, it would read it as double, sometimes even triple (e.g. pressing the 'd' key once, would result in 'dd' or 'ddd' being entered into the password field).  This happened with all the other keys I pressed, and continued for several minutes, until it stopped doing it all of a sudden and was finally able to put in my password.  Frustrated again, I turned off any lock.However, not being able to control the unlock screen with finger swipes wasn't the only issue after returning from standby.  Whenever I tried to use pdfs after returning from a long standby, I could not control scrolling or zooming.  Anytime I tried scrolling, it would zoom in and out.  This would continue for several minutes until it would finally function normally.So it's pretty clear that with my tablet, something happens to the touchscreen functionality after it's been in standby for a while.  I always had to wait several minutes after activating from standby for the touchscreen to work properly.  The touchscreen keyboard must be \"reloading\" during that time, or something.  But yea, this is unacceptable for me.  I tried doing a factory reset as well as downloading the new firmware, but it still kept giving me the same problem.  I really wanted to enjoy this tablet since everything else works decently, but this one major flaw with the touchscreen has led me to return this tablet.I've been anti-Apple for the longest time, but after trying out the ipad 3 and its retina display, I think I may take the plunge and get it.  I had narrowed my tablet choices to only 4:3 format because my main uses are reading pdfs, textbooks, and magazines, and it looks like the ipad is the only other option out there.  Also, that retina display makes pdfs look amazing, especially small font on documents.

My nephew's tablet had to be returned to LePan for service last month, after 3 months of use. A month later, it is still not back from the manufacturer.  Calling this company is very hard to get through to -- actually almost impossible.  The times that we did get through we were told they were totally backed up.

A brief Google search will get you started. I was able to switch everything over in about an hour.Second, the battery life for this thing is amazing. I charge it so infrequently that I'm often taken aback by how much power it's not using in between charges. I can't even remember the last time I had to plug it in, though I tend to charge it up anyway just in case the zombie apocalypse happens while I'm at work and I need to locate safe houses on my way to the capitol or something. Anyway, if you're looking for a tablet that can do better than \"maybe 6 hours on a single charge if you're lucky\", this is the way to go.Other pros include surprisingly powerful speakers, good Wi-fi reception even with a low signal, an acceptable screen for the price, and so on. Although I wouldn't say it's designed specifically to be ergonomic, it's still comfortable to hold. Pretend it's a Dualshock for maximum grip comfort.Not much to say when it comes to negatives. Since it's not Honeycomb, actual made-for-tablet-app support is somewhat spotty. About half of my apps notice it's a tablet anyway. The other half just run in regular mode. I've yet to have this be a big issue, but I do wish I could use all the new tablet apps out there. Other than that, the glossy screen smudges easily, which is what you signed up for when you get a tablet in general I suppose. Customer service is limited from what I hear, although it's not like Android is really complicated enough to warrant its necessity. Overall, no dealbreakers, but some downsides.Note to those who bought this, I've found Acase Premium Leather Slimline Carrying Case for Apple iPad and HP TouchPad (Black) to be the best choice for a case.

I did download Look Out Security  & Adobe Flash -  2 very MUST HAVE apps toProtect your Tablet  & Adobe Flash to get the most out of your tablet Pc.I wasn't able to do the update, but everything was working just fine.  I spoke with Customer Service (Very Friendly, and Quick Response the couple times I had spoke and emailed them) Customer Service said there wasno reason for me to do the update if it was working fine.  I agree, its been working just fine.I downloaded several apps for my son, so he could actually start using it right away on Christmas Day.I did discover that I had Yahoo Messenger and Facebook both running in the background and I didn't realize that, and it made my mic stop working.  I went into the settings and stopped running those 2 apps (which I thought I had already closed) Turned the Tablet off and back on, and the mic has worked fine every since.  My son downloadedSkype and Skyped with his Friends.The case Amazon had suggested that go with this Tablet,(  10.2\" Synthetic Leather Case with Keyboard and Stylus Pen for ePad and aPad (Black)) didn't work.

However, I thought to myself that these are probably just made right across the street from the Chinese company that builds the IPads using the same labor pool.  I've had an IPhone for years and I have to say I like Android better.There's been some people who wonder about the lack of being able to upgrade from froyo, but this is really a minor issue.  Is it really that important to you to spend an extra $150+ on an operating system that most people won't know the difference in the upgrade?  I've used IPad's and I've used this Le Pan and I can honestly say that I'm struggling to see how anyone can equate paying the premium for an Apple product now.  Yeah, sure there's a few reviewers with defective TC 970's, but do you honestly think you're immune to getting a lemon if you go with an iPad?  The way I see it, you can purchase three of these to everyone iPad and that's a huge price difference.In conclusion, if you're an everyday user, you'll never know what you're missing on an updated operating system-sure tech people could distinguish the nuances (the kindle fire/nook tablet uses a much more restricted OS to put it in prospective.)

The new firmware upgrade (available at the Le Pan website) seems to have fixed that issue for me, so I can move seamlessly from one hotspot to another without having to restart.  The wireless signal strength also seems to be improved.  I've added a 32 gb microSD card and the Elsse Premium case (requires some mods to expose the ports, but it's only $9).

It does feel a tad heavy, but not terribly so. The packaging did leave a little glue on the backside; it took about 5 minutes of rubbing to remove it. I have read about freezing issues, so far I have not experienced that. I did email Le Pan's Customer Support asking about the firmware upgrade; they responded the next day with the answer.Apparently there is a new version of this which allows you to upgrade to new Android (this is stuck on 2.2 without heavy manual work) not sure what other advantages it has.I have a little experience with an iPad and this is a little smaller and I think a bit heavier. The screen is not quite as nice and I think the camera is much worse. Other than that I don't see much operational difference.

After that it was much better, but the Wifi still didnt work right and there were a number of other bugs.  Le Pan released a firmware fix for these problems.  The firmware fix was poorly identified and it was unclear whether or not it was for this tablet. It turns out that it was for the Le Pan II as well as the Le Pan S, but I was unable to update my tablet because the recovery was broken.I tried to call Le Pan support, but was cut off mid call twice and after that there was no answer.  I opened a trouble ticket from the Le Pan support website and recieved an immediate response stating that they would replace my tablet and asking for my address.  I responded with my address and then heard nothing.  I tried to go back to the Le Pan support site, but the link to it no longer worked.  Le Pan support was simply gone.After two weeks of this crap, I contacted Amazon and told them that Le Pan was not supporting the warranty on my tablet. Amazon was gracious enough to accept a return of the tablet even though it was well outside the Le Pan return policy. Amazon applies a restocking fee to all returned items after the thirty day window.  I only needed to contact Amazon and remind them that the item was defective and the restocking fee was also refunded.What have I learned from all this? Never buy a Le Pan product.  Since all this I discovered that there are a number of inexpensive Chinese tablets that being made in the same manufacturing facilities as the well known brands. Many of these brands are well known Chinese brands that have an excellent reputation. I have preordered an Ainol-Novo Captain for $220. It should be shipped in March. The specifications blow away most of the tablets available in the US.

Unfortunately,  I had to return the Tablet.  Here is why:  The LePan  2 Tablet, would work fine at my workplace but fail to perform at home.  While at work, I could download all kinds of videos from various sources like ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC.  At home,  the videos would not download for more than 2 or 3 minutes before stopping.  I even called AT&T; and had my internet speed upend to 6 mbps.  But alas, it did not work.  However, it would play YOUTUBE and NETFLIX just fine.  I have 3 laptops at home feeding from the same old router and they all work fine even with a lower mbps.  But the LePan 2 was being very selective at home on which videos would allow me to play.  Strange, because at work it really worked fine.  I was told that at work the Tablet works fine because we are super wired here at my workplace while at home, the LePan 2 Tablet might have some kind of bug in the Honeycomb system that makes it act like that.  Well,  for the price of this limited experience  I can buy  a laptop that will allow me to vision and play just about anything I throw at it.  Too bad, because the Tablet was kind of nice.  If you are happy just to use it as a great E-Reader, or casual video watching on YOUTUBE or NETFLIX, go for it.  It is great.  But if you are like me and want to enjoy the whole spectrum of videos available on the media system out there, then I would think twice before making the purchase.  I hope this has helped you to make up your mind about this very nice but limited Android Tablet.  LAST UPDATE AUG.15, 2012.  I have returned the LePan II Tablet and Purchased the Lepan older model TC970.  It is now on sale for $130 LESS than the Lepan II and works just as good as the most expensive version.  One thing I cannot do with the older model vs the LePan II, is that the older Lepan does not play the Smithsonian Channel .......Other than that, it is not worth the extra $130.

Two of them actually, one for each of the kids (10 years old and 13 years old). They had been begging me for a tablet, and I absolutely WOULD NOT pay over $200 for a tablet for a child. So, of course the iPad was out of the question ;-) I had done a TON of research on tablets at or below the $200 price point. I knew that for my tech saavy kids who both have android smart phones and love them, they would need to have something that at least had the \"feel\" of an iPad with things like great graphics, ability to play tons of games and of course the capacitive touch screen (NOT the resistive). For those of you who have no clue what those things mean (like me when I first started looking at tablets), basically the resistive version requires a harder \"push\" on the screen to register what the user wants to do and can be used with gloved fingers, stylus' etc. The capacitive ones are the \"cool\" ones according to my kids, that register the users intended action with a slight touch giving you the nice \"flow\" when flipping screens, easy launch of apps etc. Really, capacitive vs. resistive is a personal choice. I've used both and have no issues with either one, although I too prefer the capacitive version.So, after days and days of research, I learned that most of the tablets out there below my afore mentioned price quote had resistive screens instead of capacitive, low memory and had no SD card slot, and did not play well with apps, videos etc. Since the kids use their tablets mostly for game playing and/or video watching while on road trips, those were pretty high up on my list of important functionality.As other reviewers have mentioned, I too was wary about an new company that I never heard of. After reading all of the pros and cons, I decided that for the price, this tablet would give me the most bang for my buck. Now, almost three months later, I'm EXTREMELY pleased with my decision.First off, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the look and feel of these tablets. My mother-in-law has an iPad and she let me play with it over Christmas time, and I actually prefer the Le Pan to the iPad in terms of the overall look and feel. It's sleek, light weight and has a beautiful screen. It feels like a quality product right out of the box. I think my husband was surprised at the overall appearance and quality feel of the tablets. I'm not sure what he was expecting, but he was impressed like I was.Understanding that the Android OS 2.2 version that comes on this tablet is NOT designed specifically for tablet use, overall, their tablets have run just fine. They have had to reset their tablets several times (one of them more than the other), and the younger one seems to be having trouble with lots of apps being forced closed lately. I suspect that rather than a tablet/manufacturing issue, she's downloaded some apps that are not compatible with the OS running on the tablet. We've recently uninstalled, then reistalled several of her apps, and it's now running just fine. I keep asking my hubby to root it like he did with their phones, but he just hasn't had the time yet. I also suspect that after he does that, we will see even more improvement with the tablets functionality, even though doing so would void the warranty. Again, they were fairly cheap for tablets, and they are for young kids. If they crash on them, then they can start saving to buy the tablets they want when they get jobs :-) The only reason that this review is not 4 stars is because of the need to reset and the recent force close issues. Again, I don't think they are the tablet or companies fault, but I just can't rate it 5 stars without being 100% what the cause is. Overall, most apps play well, amazon video plays just fine, as does YouTube. I have not tried Netflix or Hulu, and probably won't since we don't use either of those programs. Also, I added some music files to their tablets and it plays those just fine as well. They love being able to play music from their tablets when they have friends over. Often they will take the tablets downstairs, turn on the music and have their own little dance party! They are kids, so they are fine with the sound. In my opinion, it could be better, however, I was actually pleasantly surprised with it since I had been expecting MUCH worse based on reviews. On sound only, I'd give it a 31/2 out of 5 stars.Actually, I think my husband was a bit jealous since the tablet he has and paid $1000 for doesn't have the capacitive screens like the kids do LOL. He was skeptical of my choice when I originally purchased the tablets (he is the \"techy\" one in the family) and really wanted me to get them from a known company. Since then, he's conceded that I made the right choice. To be fair, however, we have not had to contact Le Pan directly, so can't speak to their support response times or capabilities.I'm in the market for a tablet myself now, and am trying to decide whether to get the Le Pan II, or wait for the Le Pan III to come out.

One of the things I do need to say is that if you have any issues, there is an update for it that seems to fix them.  I had looked at probably 30+ tablets, many that were cheaper, but not as up to date (one at Big Lots that was $89, but only had Android 1.5).  I had considered the Kindle Fire, but the main thing that turned me away from that was not being able to add a memory card to it.  I have been surprised so many times with this tablet, being able to play some Facebook games on it, having the full Android market, and the camera isn't too bad.Pros:PriceSize (doesn't feel like there's wasted space, like an Ipad)Can play most Facebook gamesAccess to full Android MarketCons:Without update, almost not usable when battery gets lowFingerprints show up bad (though at the right angle, almost not visible)Speakers are a bit roughI definitely recommend this tablet to anyone that has been wanting to get one, but does not have the money for an Ipad or other \"name-brand\" tablet.

I also ordered the HTC Evo 4G tablet, which arrived in 2 days so the wait wasnt as painful.That said, I can safely say, this was money spent well. Ive used it for 3 days now, and its holding up to the LePan promise. I used the Len Pan 1(android 2.2), and it impressed me. The Len Pan 2 holds up the quality of hardware and performance. The body feels sturdy, the grip feels comfortable and the software HUMS on the 1.2 Ghz processor. The upgrade to the RAM is a huge benefit, Android 3.2 is animation intensive, so any 'extra' RAM is 'good' RAM.Pros:  Handles Honeycomb 3.2 very well, no lags, no delays  Auto orients to any alignment. The Evo 4G has only 2 alignments(not the end of the world, but useful when operating the tablet whilst charging)  Larger buttons, making the touch-unfriendly Honeycomb 3.2 slightly easier to work with  Better microphone and camera for video call  Gorgeous Display, like the flagship Le Pan  Impressive Battery life. The HTC is 7 inches and guzzles battery life. This one sips for hours.Fixable Cons:  WiFi - Keeps dropping. ***THIS IS A HONEYCOMB 3.2 ISSUE***. I faced the same issue on the HTC, changing from DHCP to Static fixed the problem  Unnecessary widgets running. You can disable these from the settings menu  Skype flickers when beginning a call. Doesnt happen on the HTC. Le Pan needs to fix this, before it becomes an issue.Cons:  Weight is still good enf to make your wrist hurt if u hold too long.  Touch sensitivity needs to be adjustable  Speakers need more juice, video chatting shouldnt always need a pair of headphones  Hard drive space is not 8GB-with-a-pinch-o-salt. More like 6.5GB-with-a-pinch-o-salt. Pretty big 'pinch-o-salt' IMHO.  Insufficient support and extended development timeline for next upgrade. Deal-breaker for those not keen on 'self-helping'I still believe its worth the $280 I spent. Infact, better!

Unfortunately, after three months of use, my third Le Pan TC 970 tablet died.  Amazon replaced this tablet for me twice and I had hoped that after three months of great use from this third tablet, I finally had a tablet that was problem free (NOT SO MUCH!).  Unfortunately, a few months seems to be the life span of these tablets, based on some other reviews I've read and my own.  Feel free to read my comments below, but as my final review, save your money and by a tablet from a more reliable manufacturer.  And by the way, when I finally reached Le Pan, instead of honoring the one year warranty on the TC 970, they wanted me to send them $80 for the Le Pan II.  Obviously, my answer was no.UPDATE:  3/23/13.  It is now 3/23/13 and so far, so good.  My 3rd Le Pan tablet is working great (so far), no issues whatsoever.  Please note that it is now 2 1/2 months since I contacted Le Pan regarding tablet #2 and they still have not responded.  Thank heavens Amazon stepped up to the plate.  It is also now well after the Amazon 30-day return period so any issues will have to be addressed by Le Pan, but based on their lack of response, and though my current 3rd tablet is working great, I will have to leave my rating as a 1.  I will always be a very happy Amazon customer and I keep coming back.  Wish I could say that about Le Pan.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:I purchased this tablet based on the hundreds of positive Amazon reviews and also some very good reviews on Youtube.  The price was great and I also wanted the larger size (9.7\") instead of a 7\".  Well, I received my Le Pan TC 970 tablet on 12/24, it worked great until it died on 12/28.  I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement the very next day 12/29 (of course, I returned the 1st tablet to Amazon).  Well, I've had ongoing problems with the second Le Pan TC 970 tablet.  More than 50% of the time, I would press an app (any app) up to 5 or 6 times before it would finally work.  Not just one or two apps, but pretty much any app.  I also had problems with the android keyboard.  Whenever I had to type, I would also have to hit a key anywhere from 5 to 8 times before it responded and instead of a particular letter or number I wanted, an option list of that same letter or number would open with accents over the letter or fractions instead of a number.  Press the X key to close the option list, then a letter or number, and the same thing would happen, over and over and over again.  Instead of my contacting Amazon, on 1/7/13, I called Le Pan and though the voice message said it would be a 7 or 8 minute wait for a live support person, I waited for over an hour and no support person ever answered.  So, I sent an email the same date to tech support informing them of the problems and the 60+ minutes wait on hold with no response.  4 days later (1/11/13), Le Pan finally responded saying they would send me an RMA # (no apology for the 60+ minute wait on hold and no name of the person who responded to my email) to replace my defective tablet.  As of today, 1/16/13 (9 days after I first contacted Le Pan), I have not had either a phone or email response from Le Pan with the RMA #.  So, I called again, the voice message said it would be an 11 minute wait for a live person, and 60+ minutes later, I was still on hold then hung up.Please note that my complaint is not with Amazon at all as Amazon has been wonderful.  With no response from Le Pan tech support with the RMA # and no one answering at their customer service/tech support line, I called Amazon, explained the situation and the lack of response from Le Pan, and Amazon, not Le Pan gave me the option of a refund or sending me a 3rd tablet.  Amazon is the greatest, but I wish Le Pan had responded as it is their responsibility to handle this matter, especially since my tablet has a one-year warranty.  Because of so many positive responses, I'm willing to give a 3rd tablet a try and have returned the 2nd Le Pan tablet.

I expected a lot of problems because of the price, but I have not had any real problems. The Wifi problems were fixed with the update, and beside a couple of times I had to restart it, it has been awesome. The tablet is extremely fast for a tablet thanks to the top of the line specs. The ability to use an SD card is very much under rated. You can add 32gb to the tablet without having to pay hundreds more. Here are a few things I have noticed about the Le Pan II Tablet:PROS:1.) Amazingly Fast. Almost Instant responses on everything I do. The Processor is one of the fastest you will find for any price.2.) SD Card Slot= Alows you to expand the memory by 32gb without having to pay hundreds more like on iPads. You also can interchange cards with movies and TV shows without worrying about filling up your hard drive.3.) PRICE= The best price I have seen for a tablets with this size screen and processor.4.) Screen = Same size as iPad. cant find a tablet this new with same screen size for the price. You can watch movies at angle. I cant tell any difference between watching a movie starring right at the center of the screen vs watching it with my eyes looking right at the side. On my laptop I am constantly trying to adjust the screen position to get a clearer image. Images are extremely bright and clear. HD looking resolution for movies. Love the Color.5.) Dont have to mess with iTunes6.) BATTERY LIFE= I was amazed with the battery life i got with this tablet. I watched more than 7 hours of netflix without having to dim my screen or recharge. Recharging seems to take a long time though.CONS:1.) App Store= tons of apps but just not the number of apps that you can find on ipad but more than you can find on a kindle fire. It still has all the major aps you can find on apple store like netflix, pandora, kindle app, AutoCAD, Facebook, Twitter, and many many more. TONS of games for kids though.2.) Speakers = Speakers dont seem to be that loud even with the sound on max. I normally use ear phones anyways so that has never been a problem with me.OVERALLYou cant beat the price for the quality you are getting. The tablet upgrates to Android Ice Cream Sandwich. It is hundreds and hundreds of dollars cheaper than ipad and matches it on ever spec and more. It is just a little over the price of kindle fire but with a much larger screen. It is cheap in price but definitely not cheap in quality. I cant believe I dont see more of these out there.", "Title": "Best Tablet I have ever used + Best Price", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Author": "JT", "ReviewID": "R20IA9IQ5URMMR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using the Le Pan tablet for about 3-weeks now.  First off, I have an HTC Evo cellphone that runs Android 2.2.  And this Le Pan runs Android 2.2.  So right out of the gate I was pretty familiar with how to run this Tablet.  But, Android 2.2 is not really designed for use in tablets (there is a newer version of Android designed for use by tables).  So for Android 2.2, not all Apps work well on the table; examples:  Words With Friends is not usable on my tablet and I haven't figured out how to adjust it (the bottom few rows are cutoff on the tablet screen), my son reports some of his app games don't work on the tablet, but luckily for my son all the Angry Bird / Angry Frog / Angry Dad games work great on this Le Pan tablet.In terms of the brand I have never heard of Le Pan.  I even googled their name and there is almost no info out there.  Documentation that comes with the tablet is very sparse as is info on the web.  Maybe the info will increase over time.  This type of info is somewhat important for me because I'd like to know if this tablet will be upgradable to the newer version of Android software designed for tablets.  Also this would help me try to make tweaks/fixes to such things as Words With Friends screen size. +My pros:  Does seem to have good build quality (feels solid), Android Market appears as a standard icon and has been easy for me to download apps, screen display is nice, was easy to get up and running and synch to my home wireless, battery life seems decent, takes micro sd memory card so you can add bigger size. -My cons:  Power Button is very tiny and pain in the butt to turn on and off, sometimes the screen will turn back on for no reason, the 4 Android buttons are backlit but only for a few seconds - so if I'm using this thing in a dimily lit room I can't see where the buttons are and I can't figure out how to adjust the backlight timing (I googled around alot trying to figure this out but no luck), the charging cable is kind of a strange size (would prefer standard usb cellphone charging cable), relatively anonymous company so not sure about future support and info (eg; can I upgrade to newer android software, etc).Now compared to iPad, my friends iPad seems much slicker.  His iPad is faster, screen seems brighter, and everything seems integrated together more.  But then again part of this is just the nature of Apple's closed ecosystem vs Androids open ecosystem.Overall, I give this 3.51 stars (rounds up to 4).  It is a usable tablet, and better to use around the house for me than my Android 2.2 cellphone because the screen is bigger.  But, I deducted 1.49 stars for the cons I mentioned above as well as the fact that at $350 this is a bit pricey in consideration of the cons I listed and other Android options that are out there.

Let me mention that it comes with a single page cheat-sheet and that's it. So, I turn it on and lo and behold, it's relatively easy to configure. Took me about 20 minutes to get it hooked up to wi-fi. For me, that's pretty awesome. Like I said, I'm not a techie. I also began to download games pretty easily.Like another review said, that sound is a bit tinny. It would do well with a 'mega bass' or something like that.Once it crashed on me while playing lots of games at once.

That is what I've been saying to my Apple Fanboy friends since the iPad came out.  Honestly, if it weren't for the Vine program, I would not have gotten a tablet.My first impression, out of the box is, I'm impressed.  It seems to act just like my Android phone.  It is very responsive for a 1GHz cpu.The instructions that come with it are non-existent, a card with where the buttons are.  Their support page gives a URL error.  Their FAQs has no entries except for the specs.Cons:* The sound is very tinny.  It is not very good, especially compared to my friend's iPad.*  No rear facing camera.  So this is only good for chat.  Can't really take pictures or use a scanner app.  A little disappointing.* The auto-brightness doesn't work very well for me.  I think it makes the display too dark under all lighting conditions.* It cannot play trailers from apple.com/trailers.* The system tutorial in Settings->About Tablet doesn't work.  It just returns to the previous screen.* Android 2.2 is not designed for tablets.  Google said this.* The wireless can use 802.11n but only the 2.4GHz band and not the less cluttered 5GHz band.* My biggest complaint is that both the on/off and the volume buttons are very hard to use.  They are too small or too recessed.Pros:* The display is very nice and a good size.* Price, though I think they could have sprung for more than a 4gb card.  Even my phone came with 8bg card.* Battery life seems real good.  I've been using it for over 3 hours over two days and it is at 56%.* The Android system is a plus.  I hope it can be upgraded to 3.0+*  It comes with the Kindle app installed and ebooks look real nice.  I do still like my Kindle better since it is so much lighter.* Touch screen is very sensitive.  I find if I press too hard, it doesn't work. But of course that kind of sensitivity can be bad too, because I press things I don't mean to all the time.Some other notes:  I tried Firefox mobile on it.  It doesn't feel like Firefox and the password manager doesn't allow for a master password and that made me nervous.  Also flash did not work with Firefox, so I removed it.  I do not like the generic Browser on Android.  So I will be looking for a new one.I installed the \"Hackers Keyboard\" from the app store and really like that.  No more hunting around for special keys, they are all there.I played some games that required interaction of the touch screen and the motion detections system.  Both worked very well.You might think from all my cons that I don't like this tablet, but that is incorrect.  Most of the cons are nits.  If you are looking for a device that you can sit on the couch with, browse the web and check email, this is it.  It would be nice if the speakers sounded better (I'm looking for an equalizer app) and if the buttons were easier to use, but this is a very nice device for $350.Update 5-30-11As of today, I would NOT buy this tablet.  It does somethings nice, but many things including Netflix don't work and Le Pan has not plans to upgrade this to Andriod 2.3 let alone 3.0 or above.  They make a nice tablet and plan to release another 9.7 with 3.0, so I would wait.Update 7-24-12Now that I can, I've changed the rating to 2 star.

There are numerous issues that are really frustrating for everyday use.Wi-Fi:It connects to Wi-Fi very well but for some reason the highest speed you'll ever get is 1mb/s while my phone (also Android) seem to have no such restriction. This is quite frustrating as streaming movies suddenly can be troublesome and downloading large files (such as games) can be a big big issue. Another issue I've recognized is that it feels like this device always gets the lowest priority when it comes to connecting to routers. What I mean by this is that even though I connect both my laptop and the tablet to my school's network, there are times when the tablet just gets absolutely turtle-speed (imagine 1 minute wait time just to open a webpage) while my laptop works slower than usual but not annoyingly so (10 seconds to open a webpage).UPDATE:According to a comment of this review, newer Le Pan II tablets do not have this issue. Also, an update was released around 2 weeks after this review came up that fixed the Wi-Fi issue. You can update through lepantab.com's website.Freezes/Shutdowns:Occasionally, the tablet just shuts off or freezes (the first happens more often). It happens most often when there's a lot of stuff going on as if there's no safety net for how many applications can remain open. That said, sometimes it just shuts off without reason too. I really have not figured out why it happens.Not Stable:While this kind of goes into freezes/shutdowns issue there are also times when there are slowdowns and the tablet runs slower than usual. It is definitively not as reliable as other tablets out there.Support:Le Pan (the company) has a history of promising updates and not follow through with the updates. When I say history, I'm being a little bit unfair as it only happened once (with TC970) where a Gingerbread update was promised but then later said \"was not possible\". I bought Le Pan II without knowing this information and was quite excited for a Ice Cream Sandwich update but there has been no words about this update at all ever since it launched. History repeats?UPDATE: An firmware upgrade that fixed WiFi issues were released (although it was 4 months after release). Also, ICS upgrade has supposedly been spotted and supposed to be released at the end of May but this is NOT official (i.e. this information did not come directly from LePan)Minor issues:The following things I knew before hand so I consider it my fault for not knowing the severity of the faults so I thought I mention them just in case. Ok, the glare on the screen is BAD! It's almost unusable outdoors on a sunny day. The screen h/w ratio, size and resolution is not common and thus there are some applications that acts a bit weird (though most works fine). Front camera feels kinda muddy, it's not crystal clear despite a decent resolution. Oh and no rear camera, I didn't think it would matter but I found an application that would allow me to take a picture and write notes as well, which would've been very useful to me as a student.Last words:Despite all my issues, I think it's a decent tablet. It works generally okay and most apps are compatible. Watching movies and reading books is great (except for outdoors as noted above). If the tablet is compared to the terrible tablets, it comes out on top. If compared to the good tablets, it comes out at the bottom. I regret my purchase but not enough to sell the tablet and buy a new one. However, if I were you I would definitely look elsewhere. I personally would look at the Acer or Asus tablets, they should be very close to Le Pan II's price now and has marginally better specs (like larger internal storage and possibly rear camera).", "Title": "Don't recommend, weird stuff happens.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Author": "An", "ReviewID": "R1Q9927PKFIY1X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This Tablet doesn't work, the internet never work, is on and off all the time, it a lot of problems.", "Title": "This Tablet doesn't work", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Author": "Bhee \"Bhee\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q9LNOYIA86IU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "** Original Review **This tablet is pretty easy to use and I love the size of the screen.

She has an aging laptop that she used for surfing the web so this is a nice, inexpensive replacement that lets her surf the web, play games and read books, at a fraction of the cost of an iPad or other high end tablet. I have been able to compare the Le Pan with an iPad 2 that I borrowed from work. I have used the iPad for a while now, and the Le Pan has several advantages:-Price. Can't say more.-You can load flash websites. It seems with the iPad I have to open up a lot of websites on the computer (online banking, etc never seem to work right)-More free/cheaper apps. By comparison, apps for iPad tend to be more expensive/fewer free apps available (and the free ones are full of ads)-Has built-in GPS (haven't used it much)The Le Pan 970 has some disadvantages:-It does freeze, it seems everyone has a different experience. This one locks up every few hours, especially if using one program (e.g., reading a book or playing a game) continuously. As others have pointed out, I upgraded the firmware right when I got it but the Le Pan still freezes. She keeps a paper clip handy all the time to reset it. Or, you have to remember to close out of the app you are using periodically, although that is not a guarantee.-It is not quite as fast as the iPad. Loading websites, zooming in, etc. takes a second or two longer. Maybe the iPad is faster because it ignores the flash content in many websites.-The camera is backwards. I use Skype with the iPad and it works beautifully, seems with the Le Pan a lot of people report issues.-It runs the somewhat dated version of Android that according to others, was meant for smartphones. So, a lot of websites open up in the mobile version, which can be annoying.All in all, a good tablet if you're on the fence and if you are like me and don't want to spend a lot on a tablet--especially considering that for the price of an iPad you can buy quite nice laptop that lets you do a lot more and get work done. But this is a great tablet to check email/facebook/news while eating breakfast, read a book on a boring day at work or play angry birds. But, only 3 stars because of the fairly frequent (about once daily) freezes.UPDATE August 2012: The freezing got so bad (she had to have a paper clip in hand all the time), she had to send it in to LePan. The customer service is terrible, it took about 6 weeks to get it replaced. 3 Months later, the replaced tablet freezes less often, but still locks up unexpectedly and behaves erratically once/twice a week (apps won't load, websites freeze up) even after rebooting.

Other than the smudge-magnet screen, I have no complaints.  My review title is based more in the view of tablets in general, and perhaps Android in particular.  You see, the thing does not seem to do anything I am interested in doing, or conversely, it does only those things I am not interested in doing. While it easily set up a Gmail account, which I did not really want, it is unable to set up a Yahoo Mail account, which I desperately did want.  While I wanted to increase my productivity, without email this thing is really just a hunk of plastic and aluminum. I have also failed (about 20 times) to get an Amazon Apps account set up.  Interestingly, neither Yahoo nor Amazon have been any help at all.I have already paid for and downloaded a number of productivity apps (through the Google Market that comes in the Le Pan), but they are moot without the email.  If you like Android and tablets, this unit is excellent.  I, however, am going to stop hauling this thing back and forth to work; it is simply a time waster.06.01.2012:Most of the issues I mention above have been corrected; I have Yahoo Mail.  Unfortunately, I have grown to dread using this tablet.  I type a lot, but the virtual keypad here is so sensitive that I hate using it.  Also, the unit seems to have weak WiFi reception.

A Atrix Android phone, so I really didn't need a tablet, but this one was so reasonably priced, and I was curious about reading books on one, but didn't want a Kindle that you have to use a light to read at night in bed. And iPad's were just way too expensive. I got it right before Christmas, so haven't had a lot of time to add a bunch of apps, but LOVE IT. I read in the bathtub, so was worried about that, but a gallon zip lock fits it perfectly (just in case I get water on it). And am loving reading it there and in bed at night. Have used the GPS (google maps) and may look in to a better one, but live in small town, so it isn't really something I need much. It opened up, and looks just like my android phone, so felt right at home. I used to have an iPhone, but traded up to Android. I'm nearly 68 years old, but have alwyas been a geek, so I like the control that android gives me, over a controlled iphone or ipad. So for only about 4 weeks of ownership.. I have to say its a great deal! Its fast, has a beautiful screen and resolution (same as iPads) at a fraction of the cost. And with Amazon's Square Trade 3 year warranty, because its under $200, that was only $29 bucks!

For the price paid, I was not totally satisfied with its performance.  I returned it and bought the previous older model of the  LePan  Android 2.2 Froyo for only $130.  This older model is just as good as the newer more expensive one.  I am so totally captivated by it.  First of all, just bear in mind it is not an Ipad or a Samsung  Galaxy Pad, but neither is the price.  So with that in mind,  do not expect somersaults out of it.  It has a beautiful bright almost 10\" screen.  It downloads and plays many movies and tv shows from Netflix, Youtube, TV.com, NBC Nightly News, The Rachael Maddow Show, Newsy, CNN, CBC/The National, (Canadian nightly news show), Crackle TV, PBS, C-SPAN/Washington Journal.  In addition it is a great EREADER.  I have been able to download many national and international Newspapers, and magazines like Time magazine to mention one.  It has a full Android Market already built in, and Amazon Kindle as well.  Connects to GMAIL, YAHOO MAIL and FACEBOOK.  Also I have downloaded Google Earth and already came with Google Maps and GPS.  It has a voice recognition device to let you browse the internet with your own  voice.  Downloaded Orbitz, Kayak,  Hotels.com, Amazon, Wikepidia and many more useful gadgets.  This original older version of the Lepan Android 2.2 Tablet, is a really little jewel.  If you are like me and will use it only for mundane entertainment, you will not be disappointed  with it.  On the other end, if you need a school or college type of Tablet device,  I am afraid you will have to look into higher priced Tablets like the Samsung or Ipad.  Better yet,  at that point, I would get a small 12\" Laptop that will work better than any high priced Tablets, and would be much cheaper as well.  But again, if you like me want something to entertain you on the go....You will be very pleased with this great Tablet.  You will not go wrong.  BTW....When the Tablet is fully charged....It will last for about 8hrs.

Ordering was easy and it arrived quickly, in about 2 days. Very impressed with look and feel, speedy and easy to use. I noticed I was not on my laptop as much and the Le Pan was great for Facebook, email, web browsing. Like others I read earlier reviews and was eagerly awaiting the release of ICS, that would round out the rough edges of the Le Pan on Froyo. Very disappointed that it now sounds like this won't be happening.After 3 months of using the tablet daily, on Thanksgiving day the tablet just would not turn on. I opened a ticket on Lepantab.com site and was impressed that support replied in about an hour. After trying their suggestion the Le Pan would still not power on, so the next day I was issued an RMA and had to pack and ship to CA for repair or replacement. Since it was at my expense I picked UPS ground shipping and that took the tablet a week to get back to Le Pan. The same day the broken unit was received they shipped out another tablet. The replacement also took a week via UPS ground. I was lucky that I had backed up my apps about 3 weeks before the crash so in about an hour most everything was back up and running. So far the replacement is running, just as well as the first one. Just waiting for the day it becomes a paper weight again. I hope this happens prior to the one year warranty running out and that Le Pan is still in business. Although if no OS upgrade is offered I think customers will abandon Le Pan and pick a reliable established name brand.Still a fan of Android and very happy with Froyo on my phone. BTW my phone shipped with Donut, phone company skipped Eclair but did offer the update to Froyo....that is good support and standing behind your customers and products.

Other users reported on internet forums that they received email from Le Pan support stating that they will not release drivers to the public.I emailed support regarding driver availability and received no response at all.That being said there are unofficial drivers for the previous model of this device (970) that has been hacked to work with LP II. I have not tried them and can't comment on how well they work or if they can be used for doing software development on this tablet which was my intended usage (I am talking about development of regular Android apps that do not require device to be rooted).3) Source code for OS has not been published.
