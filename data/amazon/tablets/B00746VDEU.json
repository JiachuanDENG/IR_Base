John \"military mom\"", "ReviewID": "R2RJXRJDDT2YON", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is going to be a short review since I'm basically comparing both versions of my iPad. I have both versions, receiving my iPad 3 via FedEx this morning. So I've had a little time to compare them side by side instead of reading all the great things the iPad 3 can do online etc.The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was that the packaging was no different than the iPad 2. The only difference being that it states 32GB 4G on the new iPad (3) instead of 32GB 3G on the iPad 2. Set up was very simple. There was no need for me to connect it to iTunes which I dreaded. It came 80% charged and all the steps needed to connect and set up your new iPad is actually done on the iPad without you needing to connect it to iTunes.Edit: Just realized that this means that for those who have a windows based PC and don't want to install iTunes, all you need is an apple ID. In order to get one you can go to appleid.apple.com. Once you have that you can purchase all you need from iTunes without the use of a computer. Great for those who also don't own a computer although in this day almost everyone has one. :)The clarity of the new iPad is a lot clearer compared to the iPad 2, (I've uploaded a pic but you may not notice it since it still has the plastic on that it came with). It's also a little heavier than the iPad 2. I did notice though that my ATT signal is a lot stronger on the 3G version compared to the new iPad. I have a lot more bars. If that's going to be a problem then I'd suggest getting the iPad 2 unless you're just going to be using the WiFi option.Here's my pros of the new iPad. The 5mp rear facing camera compared to barely existent one on the iPad 2. Sure you're still not going to get pictures you can send in to National Geographic but it's a lot better than before. If you want it to just use as a camera you're still going to be disappointed. The retina display makes your screen pop and sure makes it look a lot more vibrant. The processor is supposed to be a faster but I really didn't see much of a difference when going from page to page on the Safari built in browser. Both iPad have the new iOS 5.1 software.If you have the money I'd grab the new iPad (3) but if you don't I'd stick with the iPad 2. You'd still be getting a great tablet no matter which one you chose.", "Title": "ATT Signal stronger on 3G version (iPad 2)", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Author": "Melissa Smith \"Melissa Smith\"", "ReviewID": "R2V1ZVV6UI0D2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my iPad for a few days now and have really put it through its paces.  While it lacks the connectivity options of so many android tablets it more than makes up for it with its innate functionality.  The on screen keyboard is nice to type on--in fact I'm using it right now to type this review.  The app market for iPad is without a doubt far better than android--and to be clear I use to be a diehard android tablet fan who scoffed at the idea of owning an Apple product.  The retina screen is gorgeous but like any tablet, it is a fingerprint magnet.  I have been able to find apps to let me side load ebooks not purchased through Amazon.  The Kindle app on iPad is wonderful--every book has its right cover, etc.  I purchased the 64 gb version and I am so glad I did.  iPad apps are much larger to take advantage of the retina screen.Some people have mentioned that the tablet gets warm or hot--I have found after a full day of intensive use that the tablet got no warmer than any android tablet I have ever used.  I have used the tablet outside to read and play games and as long as the sun is not directly on the screen I was able to see it very well and I had the screen brightness just past the 50% marker.  The battery life has been excellent.  I charge it overnight (it does take longer to charge since Apple didn't provide a better charger) and then I can get all day use and still have about 10% left at the end of the day.", "Title": "Goodbye android and hello iPad", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Author": "Brachiatecub", "ReviewID": "R1G18J39TQEGQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've wanted an iPad since the first one came out, but I've been holding out since I haven't actually had money for one before. Until now! Having had an iPhone for about two years now, using the new iPad has been really easy. It is the same basic concept. Tap. Tap. Tap.The battery life is insane! I use it from the minute I wake up (Around 8) till the second I got to sleep (usually midnight). It does not replace a full fledged computer, but it takes a lot of its responsibilities. Facebook, twitter, Internet browsing, email...I do almost all of that on here now.College life is also easier now. I can check my classes using the black board app, write papers with pages...I've had this for 5 days and it is already a part of my life.People complain that they don't have a smaller version. I'll be honest, I was worried about how big this thing was when I bought it, but now, I can't imagine it being any other size.Graphics really are tight and smooth, and I have yet to overload the device.Yeah, I may be in the honeymoon stage with my iPad, but I'm still in that stage with my iPhone too so...yeah. Just buy it!", "Title": "Not a \"Must Have,\" but certainly nice to have!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Author": "D. Miyao", "ReviewID": "R2LW0OP2OHU9GE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up my iPad this morning from the Apple store here in San Diego and have played with it all day.  I got the white 32gb 4g Verizon version.  I bought the Verizon version because you can still use it all over the world as it does have GSM built into it unlike the iPad2 Verizon version, and in San Diego the Verizon LTE is at minimum 4 times faster than AT&T; faux G and the mobile hot spot feature is included in Verizon's data plan whereas AT&T; it is not.  I am a AT&T; customer otherwise and I really like them as a cell provider(I know I may be in the minority on this one).A little background on me - I love gadgets.  I love to get them as soon as they come out but I try to be as unbiased as possible.  I have owned a few tablets, all of the iPads now, the Kindle Fire, the Motorola Zoom and a couple of other droid tablets not worth mentioning.  I have owned all of the iPhones, the Motorola Atrix, Dell Streak 5, Samsung Focus when windows mobile 7 was launched, and a couple of other droid devices, again not worth mentioning.  I use Windows 7 at work, but am all OSX at home.  I have the Macbook Air(2011 version) and the Mac Mini (2011 version).Just a quick recommendation if you don't want to read a long review.  Yes the screen is that much better.  No, the iPad3 is not that much faster than the iPad2.  It feels slightly heavier and thicker, but if you use a case, which I'm sure a lot of you do, it doesn't matter.  If you have the iPad 2, it probably won't be worth the upgrade unless doubling your resolution is important to you.  As of right now, only 42 apps are optimized for the high resolution screen.  The Amazon Kindle App does look spectacular, but it is still a backlit screen which will cause eye fatigue/strain for some people.  I would recommend the iPad 3 if you are upgrading from the first version, if this is your first tablet, and if you don't like droid tablets.It goes without saying that Apple products are really easy to use.  I have seen 3 year olds use the iPad with more ease than talking and I have parents who are technologically backwards but still manage to navigate their iPhones and iPads very easily.  In general most people like this about their mobile devices, although some people want the ability to hack their phones/tablets to get more out of their device(droid products).  I see the benefit to both, but I am a fan of the easier of the two.  I still think Apple has a significant advantage over the competition when it comes to software.  If you want simple, with access to thousands of apps stick with this device.I know that the iPad is not the cheapest device, but in general I believe you get what you pay for.  The Kindle Fire is cheap and is accessible to way more people simply due to the fact that it is only 199 whereas the base model of the iPads is 499.  If the Kindle Fire is your first tablet and you have never owned any other tablets it is a great starter.  But once you have used the iPad, you will get used to the larger display, clearer resolution, smoother rendering of videos, and no lag in between tasks.  I have found that all droid products have a lag to them that I never notice with Apple mobile devices.  I even find windows mobile 7 to outperform droid.  I showed the iPad off to a few co-workers today and they loved the new Retina display.  They were amazed at how clear it was and a couple of them even went on to order their own.  It really is the biggest improvement. If you have an iPad 2, it may not be a significant enough upgrade to justify the cost, especially since the resale price of your used iPad 2 has significantly dropped with the price drop on the iPad 2 still being sold by Apple.  I do have a friend who is a graphic designer, and once she saw the iPad3 vs the iPad2, she ordered herself the new model because she couldn't go back.The Verizon 4g is really fast.  I ran a speediest today and was getting 6-10mb/s download and 2mb/s upload in my area of San Diego.  This is way faster than any current device I own that connects to a mobile network.  My iPhone 4s on AT&T; averages 1mb/s down and 1mb/s up in the same testing spot.  I really like that the mobile hotspot feature is built into the data plan whereas with AT&T; it is allowed(I'm guessing this will change though for them to stay competitive with the competition).I do love the iPad3 for my own use.  I don't think I can go back to using my iPad 2 so my nieces will probably get my hand me down.  I am a early adopter and have been told many times that I waste my money on these expensive Apple products.  I have have been called a Apple fan boy, but I personally have tried all three major platforms so I think my review is maybe a little more unbiased than some of the other 5 star reviews.  Sorry RIM, I think you are on the verge of death.  I know there will always be Apple haters, and by all means everyone should have their own opinions.  But for me, I personally recommend Apple mobile devices to everyone I know and even those same people who said,\" you waste your money, I will never need an iPhone\", are now current iPad users and iPhone users and the speak as if they were the first ones to discover the iPhone.  The lines speak for the products.  They get longer and longer every year and the products keep improving.  Many reviewers complain that the upgrades to each iteration of the iPad/iPhone isn't significant, but that is usually said even before the product is released to the general public and within 2 months everyone forgets about the previous generation.If you are on the fence, you can feel comfortable trying the iPad by purchasing it because if you don't like it, I can almost guarantee right now that you will get your money back if you were to sell it via Amazon, Craigslist, or eBay.  If not, I'm sure you know someone who will take it off your hands for free.  It is very typical of gadgets to have a really bad resale value even if you have only used the product for 1 month.  But because Apple only has one generation per year, and never discounts their products, they tend to hold resale value better than the competition.I hope my review helped you come to a decision and if you get the iPad3, I hope you love it as much as I do.  Oh yeah, I also use my iPad a lot for my work.  I am a chemist and there are a lot of useful apps for me.Edit - 3/18/2012I did get an iPad that has a slight yellow tint.  I have seen this issues a few times with the white iPhone and Apple will exchange your iPad in the store for this defect.  I have yet to experience this with the black iPhone.", "Title": "Still the best tablet, best display, not too much different from the iPad 2.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Author": "busapp \"busapp\"", "ReviewID": "R3G3HNAPCERPBX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you are a PC, windows, and Word user, and if many of your video and other files are made on a PC using word, and PC based software, you should be aware that Apple has made it very difficult for you to move your files over to the Ipad, organize them, and use them effectively.  The file setup for the Ipad is rudimentary.  For example, the Kindle has a much better interface, allowing you to transfer documents and organize them easily.  Many of us are document intensive, wanting to read word files, pdf files, essays, briefs, and other documents.  This is difficult using an Ipad.  The screen, slow motion, and trendy apps on the Ipad are really great.  The engineering is superb.  But Apple still does not know how to appeal to the document intensive professional who mainly wants to review documents, read large word files, and share material between PCs, Word, and the Ipad.  File sharing is possible using the Ipad, but it is difficult, and you are in for some real learning time, trial and error, downloading various apps, signing up for Icloud and Itunes, figuring out how to interface, transfer, etc.  Instead of making this easy and intuitive, Apple has made this difficult.  It is as if Apple hates any other supplier, and does not encourage you to use any other devices except Apple devices and software.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of documents are created in a PC and Windows world.  This makes life difficult for Ipad users who have many documents in the PC and Windows world.", "Title": "Great in many areas, poor in others", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Author": "G. Davis", "ReviewID": "R117D3NHSMBVPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Great screen (Retina Display) 1080p video recording and 5 megapixel camera. While it does get finger prints it does not get them that bad. Battery lasts a long time for a tablet, Fast A5X processor, great apps at decent prices and most apps have free version to try. The white version looks elegant and professional. Facetime is awesome. It also comes with a free 5GB icloud service for back up. The  WiFi reception is very good.  The speakers produce great sound and the games look awesome! There is so much to list! It is slightly little heavier than the Ipad 2 makes it feels more durable. iOS 6 coming soon!Cons: Does get kind of warm compared to Ipad 2, location of the volume rocker, didn't come with any accessories, something simple as some headphones would have been nice or a cleaning cloth for the screen. ITunes can be more expensive than songs you can purchase from Amazon (Sometimes a dollar more for an entire album).This is my first Ipad. My wife had an Ipad 2 from work so I had something to compare it to. I have been an avid android user for years. The most recent tablet that I own was the Acer 100 Iconia. It was a great tablet for the price. My wife really wants me to go Apple so we can do more things together for fun or facetime when she goes out of town. Ipad 3 simply works. It is a beautiful machine and If I was not a gamer, I would have sold my PC and try out their computers as well. I am one of those people who always gave Apple a hard time (though they are overpriced still). I have the WiFi non 4g version. I tether it to my Android phone on a 3G network (LOL) and still able to browse the web, listen to music and play at a decent speed. The color on the screen just pops. Everything is so crisp and clear. Not only do games and other apps look great but reading anything like Flipboard or books are fantastic. The words are so easy to read on the eyes and are very sharp. There is so much to do. Rent movies; buy music, apps that help to bring the creativity out of you. There are plenty of accessories that you can purchase for your Ipad. It did annoy me that for the price you paid for this great tablet that it didn't come with anything but a couple of Apple stickers.  I was expecting at least a pair of headphone to use while lying in bed watching a movie or listening to music while my wife sleeps. The appstore is great. The one improvement on the appstore would be that when you download an app that it would be nice if the appstore would stay open instead of going back to the screen to show you the download. At the moment FaceTime can only be used on WiFi but with the iOS 6 you will be able to use it over a 4G network. I opted not to get the 4G version because I do not think it is worth paying $200 more to get the feature. Especially with the new Iphone 5 that will come out on the 4G network you can just use the tethering option and save some money over all though you will have to pay for the service. Though I have had only three days with this Ipad, I can't seem to put it down. I even take it to work and never brought my android. The ipad simply works. I was into rooting my phones and tablets, changing my ROMs out on a regular basis and have gotten to a point that I do not care about doing that kind of stuff anymore. I love simply just turning my ipad on and enjoy my experience. If  you are looking for a great tablet and can save for it. This is the one to get. If you are on an Ipad 2 it may not be worth it to you to", "Title": "My First Ipad", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Author": "D. Belmont \"belmonster\"", "ReviewID": "R3RNMNZIG27KEJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I love this thing. The screen resolution is beautiful, it interacts beautifully with my AppleTV, and I was able to find enough productivity/business apps that it's not just an $800 gaming platform. I even bought a good dashboard mount ( here on Amazon - search for Kropsson 900 - so its great for navigation on long car trips (you *must* have the 4G though - I started out with a Wi-Fi and a Verizon hotspot, but your location isn't tracked real-time on Wi-Fi, so it was useless for that particular application).However. I'm finding that the battery life leaves a lot to be desired. I actually took the first one back because I thought there was something wrong with it. Not so much - it simply drains very quickly. Just since I started writing this review, it has dropped by 2%. Oh - there's another 1%. It doesn't charge when it's plugged into your computer (not sure if that's specific to this one), and even the charger itself makes a difference. I've got a number of cables in various places around the house that I use to charge (kitchen for when I'm cooking, living room for when I'm reading, bedside for overnight charge, etc.) and I've found that the older cables charge so slowly that they're essentially useless. The dashboard mount has a place that you can plug a charger into to help with cord management, but going through that, the battery usage when using the navigation app (Waze - highly recommended) out-paced the charging ability of the mount. When my iPad was plugged directly into the cigarette lighter, there was no change - battery didn't go down, but it didn't charge either. I couldn't play music at the same time, or it couldn't keep up then either.Somebody else mentioned that the back of the iPad gets hot. I also found this to be true. The Apple store explained that it's because the battery is larger - obviously that's necessary because it sucks up so much juice. It's now gone down another 5% since my last mention.Bottom line, I still love the thing. It's damn cool. There's a lot you can do with it. But keep a charger handy.  It just dropped another percentage point.", "Title": "Love it, but bettery drains quickly", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Author": "Ryan P.

I received the iPad 3 16GB (wifi only) model as a gift two months ago and it has been working flawlessly and I love it. I love Android devices too, however, I had a bad experience with the one I bought and I regretted not spending the extra $100 on the iPad earlier.Pros:I have had zero problems with the iPad. The display is very bright (but I usually keep it at a low setting). The whole device is built to feel very durable and responsive. My previous tablet, every time I tapped the screen, I felt like I had to be extra careful because it always felt like it was so delicate and would shatter. The battery life lasts for three days for me on average, even with a decent amount of game playing. It's easy to set up. Has a lot of accessories you could find for it with no problems everywhere.. even in a street stand in NYC. I also haven't had the problem where it heats up easily even with games.It is fast and the experience of using it is very smooth. It shuts off quickly, turns on quickly, loads apps quickly. I love the multi-touch gestures. I can switch between apps with no lags and no freezes.Cons:16GB should be sufficient, but sometimes I feel like these apps are huge and will deem this 16GB model as \"not standard\" anymore. In fact, three games I downloaded raged at the 500-550MB size. And since the storage isn't exactly 16GB, it leaves me with even less space. You could always use cloud storage for other files like photos and music, but you'd always have to have internet to access those files so try to leave the least used stuff in cloud storage.I'll also have to admit that the iPad does take a long time to charge. I think it took about 4 hours to charge, two days ago. Another con is that it's a bit heavy and a bit thicker. It's not very noticeable compared to the iPad 2, but for general use and holding it up to read, it does get tiring, so this might not be the device mainly for extensive reading with one hand.There's also no SD slot where you can expand memory, but then again, I realized many other tablet manufacturers stopped doing that also. I don't mind anyway as I feel like the SD slot would just ruin the design of the iPad.

It only does one thing well but it does it better than anything else.  Its light. The battery lasts for *weeks*!

It is my first iPad. I do own an iPhone 4S, and I did briefly purchase an iPad2 back toward the end of January. However, I took it back because I expected that the display would equal to that of my iPhone4, but it was not. I heard there would be a new one coming out in the spring, so I returned my iPad2 within one week of purchasing it. I only played with it a day or two, and so glad I did return it. The new iPad was more than well worth the wait! :)Words simply cannot describe just how intense the screen resolution is, and how vibrant the colors are. Simply SPECTACULAR!! Stunning! The speed is excellent, the photos are crisp and clear, and if someone has a small piece of fuzz on their hair, for example, it will clearly be seen in their photo, as was such with one photo that I took! :)I own a white 16GB Wi-Fi only version.There are a few issues that I have experienced, however, and also read on the Apple Support Forum that others are also experiencing. I also took my new iPad to my local Apple Store yesterday to ask some questions.First, the new iPads heat up. This is due to the new and larger battery. I was told at the Apple Store that this is nothing to be concerned about. Some, although not myself, claim that their new iPads are actually too hot to touch. I have not experienced that. Mine does get extremely warm, but, nowhere near too hot too tiuch. So, you may want to beware of that, and purchase a Smart Cover to fold and hold your iPad with. (It's a good idea to have one to protect your screen, also! :))I have also experienced issues with iTunes, and read others have, too. ITunes simply \"kicked me out\" when I tried to look at movie information, not even trying to download a movie. It kicked me out and returned to the home screen. It did this several times. Tried the re-boot, but still kicked me out. Others have reported problems with downloading content from iTunes, as well. I don't know why this is happening. I heard that one possibility could be that with so many new iPad users, all trying to sync and download, that it is causing these issues. Or, it could be a glitch that will need to be corrected by Apple. Just don't know. I'm not worried about it though, because I feel confident that it will be resolved in one way or another.The battery seems to drain pretty quickly. Especially for me because I crank my screen up to maximum brightness. :) And, so far, my new iPad takes an INCREDIBLY long time to charge. I was told at the Apple Store to be sure to let the battery run all the way down before charging, and that after a few times doing that, this will improve. Time will tell! I've read others also are experiencing this issue. I bought a 6 foot charger at the Apple Store yesterday so that I can plug in and charge, and still use while charging it. I found out that it is completely safe to use the new iPad (or any iProduct) while charging, so, that is very helpful to me.I am in love with my new iPad, and am VERY, VERY happy with it. I recommend to all. :) It is truly incredible, and better than I ever imagined it would be. :)", "Title": "Simply Spectacular!!", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Author": "Jacob Cox Jr. \"ACC Solder\"", "ReviewID": "R2WHQW0CZO8HYT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The problem with Apple products is the absolute abismal customer care for their products. For the product price, you'd expect more than to have your account disabled with no reason provided. \"Your Apple ID has been disabled.\" That's all you get. Just Google it! I spent hours going through the reviews of people trying to find out how to get their accounts reinstated. Finally, I found the link. No number to call. I was told to reset the user name and password. Done! No good. Work week starts. Phone goes back on the backburner. Try again a few days later. Same results, but someone emails me back this time. Tells me to go to the \"provided\" link and try again. Done! Same result. Someone else emails me. I changed my credit card info some time ago. That was it. I need to go to the ITUNES store and manage my account. Oh. That sends me back to reset my account yet again. I did manage to stumble across a number, finally. 1-800-myapple. I call it. A virtual person answers the phone. Had to find my serial number. 40 minutes later, yes, I timed it, a human answers the phone. He's friendly. He confirms my serial number and apologized for my wait. Apparently they can tell how long I've been on the phone too. Bad news. He has to forward me to the security folkes. Looks like that is going to take another 20 minutes. Do I mind waiting? Oh. I could be grading papers or doing something productive, but why not. Let's wait! That's where I am now in fact ...still waiting...58 minutes and 24 seconds later...I just don't think apple products are worth it. The apps are what makes them productive and fun, but when they cancel your account, you can't update your apps and you certaintly can't add new ones. I can't help but wonder how many people are out there whose Apple products simply aren't working all because the customer service is so bad. I suppose the 1 hour and 6 minutes I've been waiting now should provide a clue. My first apple rep--I haven't spoken to the second one yet, told me there's a lot of people trying to get their accounts fixed.

I'm petty. On the other hand, the assumed eventual availability of OnLive cloud gaming was one of the major reasons I invested in the tablet with the highest resolution on the market. I don't need a 2048x1536 pixel display for eBooks, though it certainly doesn't hurt, and my video collection is all 720P or lower(thanks all of the way back to my iPod Video and later my Palm TX; I've owned three Android tablets and a couple Android phones before deciding I was sick of fragmentation and delayed/blocked updates, so please understand what follows reflects PRIOR EXPERIENCE with touchscreens, not infamiliarity). What did I expect to give me my pixel per pixel money's worth? HD gaming, and no I don't mean junk like Angry Birds HD.My second concern stems from the fact that I have tiny hands, so when I tap or hover on a word and can clearly see both the line above and the line below, with whitespace, around my finger, I expect the choices presented to be based on that word(usually select). Instead, often I am asked to select a word or even forced to a link on an adjacent line or column! On the rare occasion my cursor materializes within a word(during proofreading) I am forced to treat it as a fluke! As there is no cursor control from the keyboard, and the cursor still ends up before whatever characters I want to delete or after where I need to make an insertion! Additionally, any time the delete key is hit twice in a row I lose the first half of a word anyways, and the spell check never suggests simple words like \"the\". Often, the screen is so imprecise that I end up with v's, b's, n's or m's where I meant there to be a space, and vice versa! I can only surmise that Apple didn't spring for a high resolution touch surface to match the Retina display.This brings up another concern that I neglected to mention before. I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE THE IOS KEYBOARD!! Its bad enough the imprecision I mentioned before carries over to when I try to \"type\" in landscape mode, or even when zoomed in in landscape, but being forced to use the Apple style QWERTY both precludes the use of my thumbs AND two hand typing when the iPad is used as a tablet instead of, IDK, a LAP-pad(shocker, I prefer to stand or lie down while using my tablets, I have a netbook for the office chair experience, and even that lets me type two handed laying down with my wife and kids on the couch or in bed at 4am!). The nature of the touch screen means I must use ONE finger for a task meant for ten digits or risk worse typos than I've already complained about, and so just two paragraphs brings on RSI symptoms when I have never been diagnosed with such and few times in my life experienced such pain! All because Apple won't let users pay for or select Swype, T9, MessageEase, DVORAK or even throwbacks like Graffiti!My most painful regret is choosing to write this review on my iPad.

There are differences between the devices, but the two devices share many similar qualities as well. If you have not bought an IPad, I highly recommend it. I have the wifi plus Internet on both of my two devices. I also have a steel case made by Logitech that is a Bluetooth keyboard. With this keyboard the IPad 2 completely took over for both my MacBook Pro (2011 model) and my dell.So, there are many things that are the same about the IPad 2 and the IPad 3. They look identical next to each other. They are the same size. They both fit my Logitech keyboard which is also a snug case. When turned off, the two devices are indistinguishable. Also, the apps seem to work on both although some of my apps seem to be a little off. For example, on WeRule the buildings have earnings that you need to click on to collect. On the new IPad, you have to click to the side of the buildings, and the picture seems to have trouble loading. Hopefully, the apps will update soon fixing these issues. The features on the two IPads really seem the same.There are a few differences that I can see on the two devices as soon as you power them up. First of all, the picture on the new IPad is very crisp. There are more details. It is hard to explain the difference. I only really see it when I put the two screens next to each other. When you put them side by side, the difference is striking. The movies and graphics look much clearer and impressive. Another difference is in the speed of the devices. I can see that the new IPad is faster. It runs certain apps faster like Plants vs Zombies. It loads apps faster than the IPad 2. Again, this is a very small difference only seen with the two together. The camera does take a better picture on the new IPad 3 than the IPad 2, but it is nowhere near what I would be happy with. I do not use either one for this except to FaceTime, and I do not see me changing that with the new IPad 3. My IPhone 4s has a camera that far exceeds the IPad 2 or IPad 3. If you do not have an IPhone, I am sure that you could find a much better camera for less than a hundred dollars. I plan to test it out more, but my first look did not impress me at all. The pictures were fuzzy. The new Internet does seem faster on the new IPad 3 as well. I have 3G on the IPad 2 and 4G on the IPad 3. In my area, the only Internet is 3G, but I swear the new IPad is faster. The Internet just seems faster.Honestly, I bought a new IPad 3 only because we wanted another one for my husband. I'm not sure if there are enough differences to say that I would get rid of my IPad 2. I was very pleased with the IPad 2 that I bought at Best Buy with their protection plan. I also bought my IPad 3 at Best Buy with the protection plan. It was $135, and it covers accidents as well. It covers if you crack the screen which I like alot. The people at Best Buy activated my 4G for me, and they were extremely helpful.Edited 3-20-12- a couple additional thoughts- the voice dictation is a feature that I'm not very impressed with. It is a good idea, but I would rather just type with my keyboard rather than have to go back and correct mistakes. The battery does not last as long as my IPad 2. I am using the new one exactly the way I have used the old one for the last year. The difference is about an hour less battery with the IPad 3 because of the improved display I guess. Another thing that I recently noticed is that the new IPad 3 weighs a little more. I only notice this after reading for a few hours on it. I started getting tired of holding it which I never did on my IPad 2. Also, I noticed that I have to slow down my typing on the touch screen on the IPad 3. I got pretty used to a fast pace typing on my IPad 2. The same pace on the IPad 3 leaves out letters. I only mention this because it happens quite a bit. I slowed down my speed, and the problem went away. Sometimes the autocorrect catches it, but other times it doesn't.Edited again 3-27-12 I just found out that Best Buy totally screwed me over when I bought my New IPad from them. The day that I bought my IPad; I was told by three Best Buy sales employees that I had to activate my New IPad in the store through them. In fact, I was taken out of my line to pay, which would have taken 5 minutes and put in a line that made me wait for an additional 30 minutes. I asked the employees if I had to activate it there since that was not the case with my IPad 2. I was told that I could not activate it on the IPad itself. Come to find out that this is a big lie/ scam cooked up by Verzon and Best Buy. If you activate your New IPad at Best Buy, you are set up with a post paid plan. There are people saying that Best Buy gets a kickback from Verizon to screw you over in this way. It is similar to a cell phone plan except that you do not have a contract. Well, why am I griping??With a pre paid plan that you set up directly on your New IPad, you can:1. You pre pay. So if I only want one month then I can pay for that one month and that's it. If I want another month, it is fine. If I do not, it is fine. On a post paid account, you do not have a choice. You are billed for each month and if you go over your data you get charged overage fees and if you leave and come back you get activation fees.2. On a pre pay plan set up directly on your IPad, you do not have any activation fees. If Best Buy activates your IPad, you have a 35.00 dollar activation fee. You also have this fee if you do not wish to have Internet for a month or two. You come back, and Verizon charges you another activation fee.3. On a pre pay plan you can access your account directly from the IPad. If Best Buy activates your IPad, you can only access your account through the Verizon website ( which is a total nightmare) or by calling their customer service ( which is another nightmare) trust me on this. I have been dealing with them all night.4. On a pre pay plan you have the choice of 1g of data for 20.00 dollars a month. If Best Buy activates your New IPad, you only have 2g for 30.00 or 5g for 50.00. This is what I was told by 2 Verizon customer service agents tonight.One good thing that I found out about my New IPad was the personal hotspot. I don't know why I never saw this before today. Oh, it is because if you activate your New IPad at Best Buy, the personal hotspot is not in your general settings menu until you turn it on. I think you go to general then network then turn on personal hotspot. This is really cool. You can then use your iPad's Internet as WiFi for other devices. We tried it with our IPad 2(worked beautifully) iPhone( worked beautifully). Because of this feature, I changed my opinion. I would upgrade from an IPad 2 to the New IPad. Just please do not let the people at Best Buy activate it. I am a Best Buy silver reward zone member, so please do not think that I am a Best Buy hater. This is the first time I have ever had an experience like this with Best Buy, but I will not trust that store ever again.", "Title": "IPad 2 vs IPad 3 IPad 5 Stars-Best Buy 1 Star", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Author": "sampson", "ReviewID": "RL6HR7T9CQTB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the newest ipad over the weekend and will be returning it in a few daysThe retina display is overrated.

Playing a video or audio file in one window or tab?  Don't look at anything else!  As soon as you do, 99% of the time your playback or whatever stops.  And, if you switch back, the very idea that it might hold onto that data seems to be a foreign concept.  Download a 200 meg PDF file, read thirty or forty pages, then check your email.  Coming back to that tab leads to your iPad basically saying, \"Oh, you weren't done with that?  Well, we'll just have to re-download the whole thing from scratch!  And, even though it would be incredibly simple for me to do it, I didn't bother to remember where you were at.\"Flash, Java, and JavaScript. \"Why would you want to play anything like that?  Stephen Christ did not approve of such heresy!!  Therefore, you do not, either.  Therefore, you have no need to see them, use them, or have me acknowledge their existence on websites.

Praise Steve!!\"And before anybody replies and says that you can eat apps that will run flash movies, yes, those do exist.  However, either you have to pay a monthly subscription fee for them or you have to become the software equivalent of an AMWAY distributor to keep using them.Wi-Fi vs cell connection.  I purposely bought the model of iPad that had a cell connection, and, unlike a number of other reviewers, I haven't yet had any trouble with that cell connection and I do like the navigation software, but, given that Wi-Fi is generally free and cellular data generally costs money, wouldn't it be somewhat reasonable to default to using the Wi-Fi if there's a connection available?  Or have a place where I can set a preferred order to access these things in?  Oh, not in Blessed Saint Steve's world!  I have to turn my cell connection completely off anytime I'm using wi-fi, or it'll just keep pulling data over the cell.This damn touch keyboard.  Enough has been said about that in other places, but let me assure you, it's true.Keeping the screen clean.  If you're using programs that require you to input a lot of stuff or you're typing a lot, be prepared to clean your screen off every twenty to thirty minutes.  I just use a paper towel that I always have sitting by my iPad, so that's not too bad.  It's still an annoyance, though.Finally, how reflective this screen is.  Working against a white background isn't bad, but if the background is darker?  Well, looking straight into the iPad screen is like standing eighteen inches away from a mirror and trying to watch a t.v. program being shown on the glass.  Maybe this is supposed to be some kind of symbol that Blessed Saint Steve, Hope For All Mankind. Is watching over us, I don't know.  What I do know is it's annoying as hell.I could go on, but I think I've made my point.I'm just hoping that, when my financial situation improves to be able to replace this embarrassment to progress, I'll be able to borrow a hunting rifle from a friend of mine, and, with five or six rounds, put this iPad out of my misery.Who knows?
