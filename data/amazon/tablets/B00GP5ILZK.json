The screen is not very bright and you can not use it in a brightly lit room or outside. I tried explaining tbe problem with the screen to the seller but they are not very knowledgeable about their products and were no help. They offered for me to ship it back so they could look at it but they wanted me to pay for shipping on the broke item they sent me. I can barely use the dam thing since a portion of the screen doesn't respond to touch and is completely useless. I WOULD NOT recommend this product to anyone. I would save a little more $$$ and buy a decent tablet. A one star rating on this product is to high of a rating IMO.", "Title": "POS...Don't buy!", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Author": "melissa rowe", "ReviewID": "R350Q5757HF7VX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it awesome worth price had no problems. worth getting i check whole bunch before this one but doesn't come with hdmi cord", "Title": "cool product", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$69.99", "ProductID": "B00GP5ILZK", "Features": "CPU: AT7021 Cortex A7 1.3GHZ ANDROID 4.1\nGravity: 360 degree gravity induction\nStorage Device: 8GB, Memory: 512MB,Support external TF card, maximum capacity of 32GB\nLCD: Size 9\", TFT LCD The capacitive touch screen 5 points\nBattery: 3.7V/3800mA rechargable battery,stand-by time: 5-10H,By Wifi about 3-5H", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51w5%2BHrvpGL._SX300_.jpg", "Name": "SVP\u00ae 9 Inch Dual Core ANDROID 4.1 8GB Tablet WIFI 3G HDMI 3D E-book Google Play Store capacitive Touch Screen Tablet PC 9\""}}
