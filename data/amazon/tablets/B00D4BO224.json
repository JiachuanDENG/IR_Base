I was looking for something as flexible as possible, but I really wanted to have a good video service for off-line viewing as well as on-line.  I wanted something that I could use in the gym, moving vehicles, etc.  I checked out various tablets before making my decision and I definitely made the right one.  People in stores don't know much about Amazon's products and really only want to sell iPads and other Android tablets, especially Samsung.  The Samsung Galaxy note is a great tablet, but no other video service is as good as Amazon's and you can't get it on other Androids.  I have watched videos via both streaming and after downloading and it works really well both ways.  I've streamed video at home where I have 30 MB/sec service and at a place with about 1 MB/sec service and was surprised at how well it worked even there. I have a Prime membership, and that makes the Fire even better.  It was very easy to set up my home email on it and that works well too.  The Silk browser works well and so far I've experienced no problems as a result of it not supporting Flash.  If a website has small type, you can zoom with a stretching motion with your fingers as with some other tablets.  We have a 2013 Samsung smart TV and the second screen feature works exactly as advertised - pretty cool.  I haven't tried the WiDi/Miracast feature yet and also haven't tried to import other music yet, but will do so soon.  The battery lasts as long as they say.  Also have the origami cover and like it a lot as well.  I've briefly tried Officesuite Professional 7, but so far only to view a Word document (docx) and that worked fine. Personally, I'd much rather use a laptop for any serious work than any tablet on the market, but at least this gives some ability to work if you need it.  The build quality seems excellent (for the cover too), the screen is great, and the sound quality is great.  With its quad core processor, it is very responsive and natural to use.  I haven't found anything negative yet. I'm extremely happy with it.", "Title": "Fire HDX is a great product!", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "meowloricat", "ReviewID": "R1QY1Q7MZ7LGTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it! Fast, easy, clear. I own second generation kindle and this new kindle fire 8.9 HDX. Bought the 32 with special offers.  Wasn't sure if special offers were taking up memory.

Admittedly, this is my first kindle, and it has not disappointed. Video is beautiful, web surfing is way better than my ipad(2), it has a great interface, which may take a bit to get used to, but certainly doesn't detract from the devise. I find the interface design perfectly suited for both the size and functionality of the kindle.  I have the 8.9\", 64gb ad-free version. Opening/closing apps, browsing the Internet, reading, etc respond extremely fast to the touch. I have had a really hard time picking up my ipad since purchasing the HDX (I write this review on the ipad, however, due to my wife reading on the HDX). We also bought the hardback/leather flap case as well, which fits on in seconds, no fumbling with clipping it in place, and is equally easy to remove if necessary. I find this to be a fantastic product; not only is it well worth the purchase price (it feels to me like you get more than what amazon just advertises about it) but also the time invested in using this devise since we've had it! I would highly recommend this to anybody who's looking for a different tablet to try, as well as anyone who uses Amazon's services (prime, streaming video, cloud, etc); I've found their interaction through the kindle HDX to be quite enjoyable.

There are some really great things about it and some not very great things about it.Owned Gadgets:Kindle PaperwhiteSero 7 ProNexus 7 2012Ipad 2Iconia A500Pros:*The biggest plus is the screen.  This is the first HD device I've owned and it makes a huge difference.  I browsed the web, read books, etc. and it felt and looked great.  I then picked up my iPad 2 to do some similar things and it was blah.*Speed and smoothness!  It's much speedier and smoother than any of my other devices.*I actually like the OS.  Quick access to most used apps, recently used apps, and content tabs on one page.  It's very different from iOS and Android which use folders and pages to organize apps and content.*Having it tapped in to the Amazon ecosystem is great (I'm a prime member).Cons:*My device has rebooted 7 or 8 times for reasons I can't figure out.  Some reboots were before I loaded any other apps and some after.  I've had reboots opening settings, silk, and camera app.  Some happened while I was in the middle of a show or listening to music.  Kind of frustrating.*This one doesn't bother me as much, but there's a slight flicker to my screen when going from a white background to a darker like the home page.  It's like it's trying to dim down as if it was doing an auto-brightness adjustment and finally settles (I never use auto, I just manually change brightness if I feel like I need to so I can better conserve battery).*App selection is limited and at least one app, Splashtop one of my faves, doesn't work as well as on iOS and Android.Neither Here Nor There:*There is no quickoffice app that gives you editing abilities like I thought there would be (I read all of the product info I just misinterpreted it.  Why advertise office \"reading\" software as a perk, right?  So I just assumed.)  This didn't bother me much as I've always used and even prefer Kingsoft Office which is free and works just fine on the hdx.*There is no Youtube app and Youtube on the Silk browser stinks.  The videos look worse than on my low res iPad 2.  However, I found a tolerable third party app that gets the job done.I am keeping an eye on it and I'd be interested to know if anyone else has experienced any of my cons.

While this tablet is, in my opinion, currently without equal as a media tablet, I was surprised to find that the in-built Office Suite did not have the ability to *produce* anything - it only has document viewing capability, meaning that you cannot edit/author documents such as spreadsheets using the built-in Office Suite. The line that misled me (and numerous others) was this:\"Stay productive on the go with ultra-fast web browsing, built-in Office Suite, plus e-mail and calendar support for Gmail, Outlook, and more.\"Kind of difficult to 'stay productive' with an Office Suite that can't actually produce anything!Please be aware that if you are expecting fully functional Office Suite productivity with this tablet (word processor, spreadsheets etc), it is NOT included, and you have to pay for additional app(s) to enable full Office Suite functionality, albeit some for as little as $5.This review is intended to help those who, like me, require that functionality in a tablet, and would prefer to know these facts *before* purchasing the tablet.

The advertising for the Kindle claims that it can receive e-mails and Office Docs. Turns out the Kindle won't open any Office docs if they are mailed to my normal business e-mail address. According to the tech support person I reached through the live chat feature, any e-mails with Office attachments have to be sent to my '@kindle' e-mail address with the word 'convert' in the subject line! This is quite impractical when receiving files from customers and clients - it means I have to e-mail them back and request they send the attachment again to a strange address - extremely unprofessional. The support persons other suggestion was to receive the mails at my computer and then froward them to my kindle e-mail address - kind of defeats the object of a tablet as it means I have to carry my laptop with me anyway.

My only complaints being that is quite heavy in the hands when reading books or magazines, and it is a little bit on the slow side when multiple apps are running in the background.So I decided to do some research on the latest (greatest?) tablets on the market. I am not a fan of the Apple ecosystem so the iPad (mini or other) was out of the question. My wife as the 2nd generation Kindle Fire and loves it...me not so much. It's good for what it does, but I'm not a fan of the Kindle overlay on top of the android OS. I had a feeling that this newer version would be similar, but I wasn't sure so I decided to give it a test drive.First let me say that this tablet is super light-weight! It makes my Xoom feel like a 10lb dumbbell. Not only is it light, but it is very thin (maybe even thinner than the iPad Mini). The tablet is super fast and smooth. There was absolutely no lag as I switched between screens and apps. Surfing webpages was effortless and there was little to no load times. The tablet is an excellent media device and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is already using or thinking about signing up for Amazon Prime.Well why 4 stars then?! As with the original Kindle Fire and all of it's newer versions, I just can't get into the customized layout that Kindle has ontop of Android's OS. I am one of those people that absolutely hates the \"Kindle Carousel\"! I much prefer a clean and simple interface that I can customize to my liking.I would give the tablet 4.5 stars, but that wasn't an option. All in all I would say that the new Kindle Fire HDX is about as excellent a tablet as one can buy (if you like that crazy carousel) and I would certainly recommend it.", "Title": "This tablet WOW'ed me...but,", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Author": "Michael Bigger", "ReviewID": "R27MXEH871LH3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Bought 2 * 32 GB for my kids and 1 *64 Gb for myself, all wi-fi, 3 Origami covers)The big drivers for this tablet are its light weight, the amazing screen quality and resolution, and its speed (fast with no lags). I haven't used Mayday, so I can't comment on it.The device's weight and how it feels in your hands makes me want to hold the device without a cover. I bought one Origami cover initially and I will go against the current and state that this is a great cover because it is a breeze to take the device in and out of the cover; As simple as putting and removing a magnetic strip on a fridge. I want to hold the device in my hands because it feels great and it is super light. For me the cover is great for protecting the device when not in use. A great deal of effort goes into making a tablet feel good in the hands, why should I not enjoy it? My kids like the cover so much, I ordered 2 additional covers.The screen is amazing. DisplayMate did a tablet screen study. You can check the metrics at [...] Just amazing...Some tidbits...The Fling feature, Goodreads, ...: We really like the latest software upgrade to Mojito. It includes the \"Fling\" feature in the  Amazon shopping app. You can create a placeholder by flinging the picture of a product you are browsing to the bottom of the app for future reference. This feature improves the shopping experience.Goodreads, the reader social media platform is excellent.Some people have complained about the limitation on Prime Videos...To that I say Amazon offers some sweet deals on videos for purchase. I have no hesitation buying a few movies in addition to downloading some of the free stuff Amazon makes available for us. The value is unbeatableArea for improvement...Goodreads should be integrated in the tablet like it is on the Paperwhite.At full brightness, it gets hard to reads black text on a white background...not a biggie but I wish the text would pop out more.Superstar product, highly recommended.", "Title": "The Drivers Making the HDX a 5 Stars Product", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Author": "Shopper", "ReviewID": "R3KJ1HN7DFOXH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the display!

Pulled it out of the box and I have to say for the first time in 4 years Apple lost a product competition to me.  This thing is lighter, cleaner, and just overall better in almost every way.Now before all the Apple haters jump on me for this review hear me out.  Yes I know your precious little iPad does integrate directly into iTunes and transferring of Movies, Music, and Pictures is a snap.  However, this box does all of that too for anyone who know's how to use a PC or a Mac.  I personally have this attached to my 17\" MacBook Pro now and transfer all my stuff with a single click as well.Pros:Amazon is finally giving me a \"Usable\" OS for the tablet market.

The screen resolution and color is dazzling.  Connect to the Internet, play downloaded games or music, read books, or take photographs or video - it does it all.My suggestion - buy an e-book user manual, install the Kindle Reader app for PC to your computer, and then download the manual to your computer (we bought \"The Kindle Fire HDX User Guide\" by Charles Tulley ($2.99)).  Take the time to read the user manual BEFORE you futz with the device.The Kindle Fire HDX is pretty intuitive..... any tech-savy teenager or twenty-something will figure out the basics in just an hour or so.  But, if you want to save yourself grief, read a user manual and find out how to do things correctly.  That way, you won't end up with a frozen or goobered device,  the result of doing something horribly wrong (like a bad sync with Windows Media Player).Users should also be aware of the re-boot process..... holding down the on/off button for a full 20 seconds;  it will back you out of many (if not most) problems that you'll encounter.Finally, bookmark the Amazon.com \"Help\" and \"Help Forum\" sites for Kindle Fire HDX on your computer.  The answer to just about any question, and solution to just about any problem, can be found on those sites.Overall:  Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\"......  it's just amazingly excellent.Final Thoughts:  You really need security software on any device that connects to the Internet.  We downloaded the free ESET Mobile Security app from the App Store.  If your Kindle has 3G/4G wireless capability, the ESET software also provides an anti-theft feature.  If your Kindle is only WiFi capable, consider the free Locked and Found (Geek Squad) app to remotely lock and help you recover your device if it is ever lost or stolen.", "Title": "Amazing", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Author": "CookieCocoChanel \"KMH\"", "ReviewID": "RVRMSHW51JAM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My second kindle fire has 64GBP.

It is faster than any of the others.  It has a display unmatched by others.  The resolution is so good that I do not have to put my cheating glasses on to read the screen.  If the screen output is too small a little expanded pinch enlarges it.  All together usage boils down to needs.  While 16GB is fine now, I can see where it would not take too long to need 32GB and while I do not now have a need to use the Kindle for a phone it could very well be handy at some later date.  The cameras are far better than several dedicated point and shoot cameras I use although it is not quite as good as the Coolpix 820 but that's an unfair comparison.  The Kindle's internet is so much faster than my desktop and laptop computers are.  In short it is a growing element on each of us here and we thoroughly enjoy using it and its applications with a positive outlook for tomorrow's adventures.Original comments:I have had this Kindle for only a few days and I have found it to be better than I imagined.  It is fast.  It has beautiful resolution and it is so good that I do not have to wear glasses to read the written words or graphics.  It is light and easy to hold.  Battery life is better than many of similar size.  The front and back cameras do a surer job and with its High Definition output I was astonished at the quality of the pictures.Right now I am simply getting to know the Kindle and it is a pleasure to keep its company.  It pairs quickly with Bluetooth and connects faster.  WiFi works well and has not kicked me off yet.

The only reason for 4 stars is the lack of Google Drive (Google Docs).  If I can sideload this and it works, I will change to 5 stars.  I don't care about the other Google Apps because the Kindle offers good alternatives for e-mail and calendar.  I also do not use Google Books or Music.  I purchased the 16gb model because I get all of my video entertainment from Netflix via streaming.  I am heavy into Kindle Books and keep most of my books in the cloud (keeping about 50 on the device at one time).  I downloaded FBReader for ePub books and may sideload Nook Reader because my wife is a Nook HD+ owner and may need access to her Nook library.  I do know about Calibre e-book management software but complicated books such as 3000 page bibles with thousands of internal links do NOT convert well from ePub to Kindle.The hardware is OUTSTANDING, the price at $50 off was OUTSTANDING and the \"Walled Garden\" is more of a nuisance and not a deal breaker at all.

The weight of this tablet, as compared to the new iPad Air, for instance, is incredible. When you compare the two tablet's weight versus their volume, the HDX would be equal in weight to the one pound Air if it weighed 15.5 ounces. But it doesn't; it only weighs 13.1 oz!Thinness? The iPad air only has a two one hundredths of a millimeter advantage.The screen is just flat out brilliant. Watching movies and playing app games on this tablet is superior to everything else I own.The last thing I would add about the specs is that the more I use it, the better I like the size. I have a 10\" Nexus 10, a 9.7\" iPad, an 8.0\" Samsung Note, and a few 7\" tablets. For the combination of size, weight, and useful portability, I like the 8.9\" of the HDX best.BUT, the most important thing about this new Kindle tablet is the increased usability. It just flies through everything and all the moves I want to make are much simpler, more intuitive than the 8.9 HD. My various Samsung devices have massive tricks and features, and the iPad on the new iOS is interesting, but neither works as easily as the new HDX. The only device that compares favorably to this in usability is the pure Android experience on the new Nexus 7... but it came with touch screen weirdness.Finally on the \"pro\" side, my 64 GB cost $20 less than the iPad Air's 16 GB tablet, and their 64 GB cost is $220 higher.Cons?

I asked if they had looked at their own webpage and the 40+ pages of customer comments on the WiFi issue, the customer service rep would not validate.  But yet she said that they are a company that focused on reading and listening to their customers' comments and feedback.  Contradictory.  When I asked for an response, she said she would investigate and respond.  Here is their response ...\"I'm sorry, Amazon.com does not comment about rumors or speculative news reports.

The 8.9\" was PERFECT for me. Not too big, but bigger than the \"mini\" tablets. The weight was super light and easy to hold, and the feel of it was great. The back was sort of rubberized which was nice. The display was beautiful and the sound.The Cons however, were too much to get over to consider keeping it. The product does not allow for much customization as far as wallpaper, screen saver, icons, etc. I couldn't put things where I wanted them. I also was not happy with the operating system itself. It was almost too user friendly. The system ran quickly, but just not \"up to par\" with other current systems out there. I have a Samsung Galxy S4 phone, and couldn't stop comparing the two. My biggest complaint though, is that is does not allow many of the most popular \"normal\" apps available. I was aware before purchasing that they did not have the vast amount of apps as on Google Play or the Apple store. However, I couldn't believe that I couldn't even download Dropbox! One of the main reasons for getting a tablet was for me to put work files on it when I travel. I was going to use Dropbox for this. I couldn't do it! They also have blocked most Google branded apps. So it did not sync well with my Google accounts. They had a gmail app, but it wasn't up to date with the newest style so things would look different from my phone to my tablet.Overall, just very frustrated with the Operating system setup, look, and the lack of apps. Also annoying that you have to pay extra to REMOVE the ads! I had to return it. I ended up buying the brand new Samsung Tab Pro and LOVE it.

I got the Verso Marrakesh Genuine Leather Cover for that, and love it so much.  It has worn around the Kindle and looks like a well worn vintage book.But with the new Amazon Fire TV, and loving it, I decided to go all out an upgrade to the larger 8.9\" HDX, and so glad I did.  The interaction between the two is awesome.  I love the screen swapping and basically using the Kindle as a remote.  The \"second screen\" is awesome when watching movies and tv.  Since Amazon owns IMDB, it literally pops up information on each actor as they appear, as well as various info in all scenes.  Like a non-intrusive commentary.  No more \"who is that actor\" as you just look at your HDX and there it is.Since 2011, I have collected thousands of free apps via Amazon's app store.  They give at least one app away free every day, so the value of the apps I have make it well worth the investment to get the largest storage available of 64GB.  But I love being able to listen to my 51,000 songs stored on my Amazon Cloud and listen on the Cloud player taking no device space at all.All apps and functions are blazing fast and quite a jump from my 2011 Kindle Fire.  I also have Apple's iPad, iPhone etc.  But the HDX is all about the Amazon experience for me.  I'm quite embedded with products and services by Amazon, and you cannot beat their customer service.  Which I have to also say that the HDX customer service feature called MayDay is quite amazing.  When setting it up, I had a question, and you click MayDay and an actual person appears on your screen.  They can see your screen and help you with anything, or show you features right in front of you.  They talk you through it, or you watch how they do it.  All while seeing who you are talking to in a video box in the corner.  They don't see you, but it would be an interesting option.I have the HDX on all day.  Either on stand-by or full use, I get a full day of use at home or travel.  I would say at least 10-12 hours of use.  I just charge when I go to bed.  I feel like I use the Kindles more than my iThings, but both serve different needs.  However go all out and go for it.  A great investment.

It is wonderful to know that I have that option.  There are changes, some of your Apps are in your cloud & take a few minutes to download to your new Kindle. Frankly I thought this was nothing to get excited about. Though some found it insulting. I found that some Apps can stay in the cloud.

I think it\u2019s a great device for a first-time tablet owner, but ultimately I think it falls short as an IPad replacement.I have first generation iPad that has become virtually unusable. There is nothing physically wrong with it \u2013 it just crashes continually because its memory can\u2019t keep up with \u201cadvances\u201d in operating system and apps since I bought it three years ago.  This problem plagues earlier generation iPad\u2019s and Apple\u2019s response is \u201cEOL\u201d \u2013 the device is end-of-life and they won\u2019t support it; buy a new one if you want one that works. I think Apple meant \u201cSOL.\u201dNot enamored with this attitude, I looked for an alternative and thought I had found one in the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. Great specs, beautiful display, most of the apps I wanted  (I thought) in the Amazon app store.  And cheaper (although it is a little smaller). And I think Amazon\u2019s a great company so I ordered one.The display is beautiful, and it was a huge pleasure to watch video on the device. I like my viewing on a big screen and never watch much on a tablet, but I had a bunch of waiting-around time the weekend I got the Fire HDX and binge watched some shows from Amazon Prime (Luther, Sherlock, Alpha House). Download was easy, video was terrific, and though I originally thought it was just a gimmick, I LOVE the X-Ray feature on the Fire HDX. Sound is good, too, although I mostly used headphones.I also love the cursor control when typing text on the Fire. A slider appears under the text box that lets you precisely place the cursor for editing, much easier to use than Apple\u2019s.The device was snappy, but not eye-wateringly fast, as I expected upgrading from the original iPad.I don\u2019t use a ton of apps, and before I bought the Fire I checked that a couple I use regularly on the IPad were available for the Fire in the Amazon App store. But being available doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the same. For example, on the iPad I have the paid version of Words With Friends, but the only one available for the Fire is the ad-based version, which pops up an ad after every move. It also sometimes  will not let me escape from the ad without exiting the app.  Very annoying, and I would be willing to pay a couple bucks for the upgrade, but it\u2019s not available. I also use Zite (an online magazine) quite a bit \u2013 again, the Kindle version looks different (not a big deal) but also frequently hung up when I tried to play video from within the app.I also surprised to find the lack of customization available on the Kindle. Really, I can\u2019t put my kids\u2019 picture on the home screen or lock screen? I can\u2019t put shortcuts to web pages on the home screen? Well, maybe I can do that, but if so, I have no idea how, which brings me to another point of frustration \u2013 finding information on how to do things on this device.As far as I can tell, all Kindle devices come under the same user forum on Amazon. Whether you\u2019ve got an original Kindle, an HDX, or any of the e-reader and Fire devices in between, all the discussions are in one big lump. Makes for a lot of wading through irrelevant material to find what you need. For example, I was trying to figure out how to put a bookmark to a website on my home screen, so I could just tap that icon and go straight to that webpage, rather than firing up the Silk browser and then navigating to the website. Can I do it? I don\u2019t know. I found instructions on how to do this, but they were for an earlier Fire tablet (or browser version?) and the instructions didn\u2019t track to what I was seeing on the HDX. Eventually, I gave up. I also gave up on finding a comprehensive user manual for the device \u2013 the only one I could find on Amazon was a .pdf of the quickstart guide, and the \u201cUser guide\u201d on the device is almost as bare bones. Yes, I could have tried the Mayday feature but I really don\u2019t want to fire up an A/V connection and talk to someone every time I have a question about the device.Ultimately, the tablet didn\u2019t do \u2013 or didn\u2019t do as well \u2013 some of the things I was used to doing on my IPad, and the time I was investing in figuring all that out just wasn\u2019t worth the price difference between the HDX and the iPad. So, hating myself, I reluctantly bought an iPad Air and am returning the HDX.If this were my first, tablet, I think I would be very happy with it. In fact, we bought a Fire HDX 7 for my 11-year-old and she loves it.

Might not seem like a big deal to some, but I'm so used to swyping on my android, tapping away at the keyboard slows me down.  On my old kindle, I gave up on accessing email, doc applications, and even writing reviews :)  There's also a voice recording function.

While I still wish someone could come up with a stellar app to import all my books into some type of folder or collection hierarchy, this feature is still an improvement.Audio books are now part of the menu instead of having to run them through the Audible app.  Not only do they download faster, they run better.Technical specs aside...part of what makes a great device is the UI/UX.... little features that improve usability and overall user experience are critical, and Amazon really did nail it with this device.", "Title": "Amazon really nailed it with this device", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Author": "CW FISHER \"stars for connie\"", "ReviewID": "RBVJ5SX5SIKUF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third kindle and I am enjoying this one very much.

None of them discloses that you will have to pay $15 to get rid of them, even when you click on \"learn more\".Amazon claims that these ads don't interfer with the use of the tablet, but they do. They popped up several times  while i was playing Fruit Ninja and actually paused the game.We called Amazon customer service and at first the rep said that we didn't read carefully all the fine print. We told him that we got it from Best Buy, because the same model was $40 cheaper than Amazon, and they had no information anywhere about these \"special Offers\".  He was understanding, waived the $15, told us to restart the device and they were gone!That's the reason I will give only 4 stars. The sellers should be more upfront about these things.Otherwise, it was very easy to get started, since I had a first generation Kindle Fire HD. As soon as I entered the account info, everything got automatically uploaded. E-mail was much easier to set up that the previous model, and it now supports Outlook. Good camera, not I would really be caught taking a picture or a movie holding a big flat thing in front of me :).

I own an ipad 4 with retina display and a google nexus 7 as well as having a windows phone and having had an android phone in the past. I like all variations of tech and prefer to be immersed in all instead of being ridiculously close minded and loyal to only one. Each has its own merits.  I bought the Kindle for my kids because they have the option of the lending library and I can control their time on the device. I have an amazon prime account, which in this case, is a plus. All of my already owned apps via the amazon app store were automatically downloaded as well as any kindle books I've purchased in the past.  The amazon app store does not have near the breadth of the apps that the ipad is but they have the major ones for game playing including ones the boys really like like minecraft pocket edition, angry birds go, etc. The most limiting app store would be that for the windows phone. Not the case with this device. You can also buy amazon coins on amazon so you have purchasing power for any apps in the store and depending on how man you buy, I believe you can save up to $10. Assuming you are going to spend that much on apps. It's not good towards books.  The OS on the kindle is good. It is lightning fast, has all of the settings at your fingertips and I've had 0 problems so far.  It holds a charge as well as the ipad with consistent use and the charging port is easy to access and secure. I'm still getting used to the buttons on the back but I like that I cant accidentally hit the home button. I actually have to go for it. The nexus 7 is disappointing as far as battery life goes and the charging port. Within two months of having the nexus, I had to ship it off to have the charging port replaced. The ipad I've replaced twice due to a malfunctioning home key and the wifi not working at all. I have cellular service on the ipad but do not on the kindle. I almost wish I did to see how well it functions.  Kindle has an incredible photo editing program. The photos it takes are as good as those the ipad takes (I don't expect much from tablet devices) and I was shocked to see the variety of editing features the program offered without having to buy an extra app. You could make a meme, add stickers, crop, etc. Many things as well as sharing features. Kindle is not compatible with instagram yet, which is a shame. It just became compatible with windows in December of last year. Hopefully this will be resolved soon.  Also, the Kindle has the unique and convenient feature (like the nexus 7) of typing by swiping the word across the keyboard. It is amazingly accurate, fast and easy to use once you practice once or twice. Because of the size of the screen and the touch accuracy, I've used it often on the Kindle if I've needed to type.  The only truly disappointing thing for me which may sound trivial is the fact you cannot personalize the background or lock screen. I paid the extra $15 not to be inundated with commercials because ultimately this is my device, not Amazon's to sell stuff to me. Even if they are great offers, I shouldn't have to feel like I have to buy something if I want to turn the thing on for the kids, etc. There is a pin lock screen available, just like the ipad. It does not have facial recognition or pattern offered like the nexus 7, though.  Mostly, I have been satisfied with this device. I have no real complaints and I care about performance and the visual screen first. The screen is beautiful. I like looking at it better than my ipad. The reason I got the ipad over a year ago was for the screen. Now they have better options. However, I like my ipad for the apps.  For kids, for reading, for those with an amazon account, this is perfect!  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

I found it difficult to even find a telephone number for Amazon so I could call someone to tell me how to use the tablet.  I complained to Amazon about the lack of not having a company or someone locally who could help teach me how to use the table.  I was really frustrated because I wasn't able to take good pictures with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 since it didn't have a back camera.  Oh, but baby!  Extra! Extra!  Read all about it! I know somebody really loves me because I got the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as a Christmas present! Let me tell you now about my new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  I am now the proud owner of a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and every time I use this tablet, it's a new day with a new play!  Kindle Fire has stepped up it's game!  I can take great pictures all day long because it now has a front and back camera.  I now am a believer, that for the price, IPADs don't have anything any more on Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. I love using the May Day which have live people showing you how to navigate the table.  The May Day People are fun to talk to and make me feel at ease. The Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is much lighter.  I really love watching movies on my Kindle.  I like the new, improved \"Contact List\" app. The one disappointment with the new Kindle Fire HDX is the \"Office Suite\" that was advertised as being a integral part of Kindle Fire HDX 8.9  which doesn't seem to exist.  I'm not sure this app exist because there isn't an \"Office Suite\" icon on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  It's been confusing as to why the \"Office Suite\" is not on the tablet as advertised.  May Day People weren't able to explain to me in a manner that I can understand why the app icon is not on the device and weren't able to clearly explain how I should use this app. Not having the \"Office Suite\" icon app on my new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is the only area where I feel slighted because that is one of the main reasons I purchased this new tablet. Otherwise, I most definitely am very satisfied with my new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  One other thing, Kindle Fire has also improved with the number of great movies and books that can be obtained if one purchases \"Prime Time\" each year. This is the first time I've purchased \"Prime Time\" since I began getting Kindle Fires. I am glad I paid the prime time fee because I've seen some great movies on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. It's so much fun watching a movie on my Kindle while I'm lying in bed! With the Kindle Fire, one is able to store music in the cloud.  One last thing, on this past Sunday, when I visited my sister who was using her Kindle Fire HD 8.9 while I used my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, we could differently see the big and improved differences in the newest tablet.

I had an older version of kindle and was able to transfer all the folders and books easily.  I found adding my purchases and maneuvering between folders and screens easy.It did take a couple of days to get used to the screen as my old one was the Kindle DX - not backlit.  The new kindle means I don't need to have extra light which was a major selling point for me.The battery life seems quite long, I can generally get nearly 2 full days of reading before having to charge.

I would consider myself a power user that must push the boundaries of making a device do what I would like it to do.  I rooted my Nexus 7 so I can use apps like Titanium Backup Pro, etc.  However, I was getting tired of needing to root and deal with that headache and just get a device that works.  The Kindle HDX is a beautiful device and interface.  I have enjoyed it so far, but there are a bunch of App compatibility issues that I immediately ran into.I'll keep this short and maybe revisit and expand after I have had more time to settle in with this device.Pros:Beautiful display and I\\interfaceIntegration with Amazon contentHandles about 80% of what I want to do with a tabletBook reading has been pleasant so farSpeakers and audio sound really good coming from a tabletCons:Locked into Silk BrowserLast Pass seems a little weird - not tied to Silk Browser - uses an embedded Dolphin browser I believe - wish this was integrated into Silk with a plugin or somethingNo Google integration - you don't know you miss it until it's not there any moreLack of GPSApps in the Amazon app store are not the same revision as current ones in the Google Play storeThings like Candy Crush - since its an older version, I'm missing features I get on my Google based devicesStuff I purchased in Google Play I cannot easily get to Kindle Fire or if I do it might not be supported (if I sideload something)Price.  Due to being so locked in to the Amazon marketplace, I feel this device should be priced lower or I wouldn't have a problem paying more if more of my apps worked out of the box.In short, there are challenges that need to be overcome on a directional level from Amazon.  I'm not sure why developers or Amazon are not keeping Apps up to date or what is preventing developers from moving to the Amazon Marketplace, but if I were Amazon I'd be addressing these issues.  If I had more compatibility and flexibility I wouldn't have such a problem losing a few apps, but the percentage is too high for me to give a 4 or 5 star review as the current device and platform sit.Companies that try to limit what we want or can do with these devices are going to pay the price, by losing users and sales.  It seems Amazon is following Apple's model more closely than Google's.  I'm happy with a mix in the middle.  Considered sending this back to Amazon but I'll wait it out some more and see how things go.

I was fortunate to be invited to try it by Amazon for 30 days free. Light, easy to carry and FAST! Much faster than my iPad. Screen is beautiful and far superior to the Retina. I compared the Kindle side by side and WOW! Dolby speakers to boot, so you know the sound is going to be better than most other tablets. I had an Android phone before, so I already had a good understanding of the OS. That being said, here are some things that could be improved. The OS is not as fluid or as intuitive as Apple. Not a surprise here. And the battery life is NOT as advertised. The iPad can last up to three days with light to moderate use. The Kindle will run all the way down the night before, charge all night, and before 9 AM, the battery will be depleted 10%. So, I strongly dispute that claim about battery life. I have not used the Mayday button yet and didn't even know about that feature until the Kindle arrived. I really like that part of it and I think that it sets the Fire apart. It's nice to have instant help if needed and I think that Amazon is on to something here. Also, if you have Prime, this is your device. For videos, your watch list and all access to anything Amazon offers is literally at your fingertips. Same goes for shopping. It is quite easy and dangerous!

I've been on the fence about tablets for a long time, I consider them more of a novelty than a need and I thought this was the perfect opportunity to make up my mind. The HDX is a very attractive device, it feels good in your hand and the rubbery material looks great. It's also extremely light, The screen has an incredible resolution and looks outstanding when browsing and playing around. The sound is also excellent as well. There were a few things however I wasn't too impressed with. The Silk browser is meh at times, the app store is lacking, the buttons are located in weird spots, and the OS is just too integrated with Amazon. The OS isn't hard to get used to and the set up is easy but after about 3 days of use the novelty kind of wore off for me. It's an excellent device but I don't see the real need for it. It doesn't feel like the tablet would be able to do anything else but browse the web, read books, and watch movies. For a device that is close to $400 that isn't enough. I would rather spent the extra money on the Surface 2 which at least gets you Microsoft Office. I'm giving it four stars because I feel the device has a great build, great screen, is light, and does what its suppose to do very well.

It's ok.  I also own an ipad and I'm trying not to compare the two but it is hard not to.  I agree with other reviewers that the amazon AppStore is lacking.  The kindle will play amazon movies without a hitch including prime if you are a member. I've needed mayday 3 times.  Twice for problems with downloading apps and once because of a problem with the camera.  The answer every time is reset the device.  Every time! Which doesn't work by the way.  One major annoyance is that when using the rear camera while in a magnetic case there is an animation that blocks your view.  It tells you to slide up your device.  The kindle basically doesn't want to be in a magnetic case while taking a pictured. However, since the magnetic case doesn't interfere with taking a picture it is just annoying while I blocks your view.  I hope that it will be removed in a future update.  At the very least, there should be a setting option that allows you to remove the reminder alert from the middle of the screen.  Other than that, the kindle is fine.  You just need to be conscious of the (limited) market you are buying into.", "Title": "Software could use an update, but it's ok", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "M.

The lack of apps, due to Amazon's greed I'm sure, makes this less of a media tablet and more of an overpriced digital reading device.

I went for a refurbished Kindle HD. I was not happy as i had Apps crashing issues. I bought this when it went to $339 sale 2-3 weeks ago. As usual prime shipping i had it in 2 days. The color and picture quality is so vibrant. The sound is breath taking. Much better than IPAD mini or IPAD i have had. I am a prime member and it is a bonus that i could download my rental and certain prime videos. I have already bought kindle book rental for month of April. I also downloaded 2 books which is a free offer for kindle owners. I also love Kindle free time for kids and i can set the timings on weekdays and weekends. I do not need to monitor as the kindle shuts it off. I have not had a chance to experience May Day service but i am sure it is revolutionary. Amazon has decent number of Apps but would be great if they had google play available. I have HBO Go, directv App, ESPN app all working perfectly fine. It comes with a charger unlike the other Kindles which is a huge plus. After i bought it went on sale with a extra 10% off for PRIME members and i contacted CS reps and within 5 min i was refunded. So i ended up paying $305. Great price for this power house!

Well, I setup 3 of these for my wife and kids and while I found this tablet lacking on the technical/features side (I prefer Windows 8 tablets for that matter,) my wife and kids loved it, ironically, for these same reasons. Since it is a locked-down, and watered-down version of Android, it is not overly overwhelming in features, making it easier to use for kids and non-technical people. So this tablet fills this niche perfectly. And the 4G LTE option makes it a great portable tablet on the go (travel/beach/school/etc.)To nitpick, I'm surprised Amazon didn't add wireless-ac and Bluetooth mouse support in this hardware refresh, To nitpick even more, a 13MP or even 20MP rear camera would have been more attractive than 8MP for this price range. I also found its charger, though very cute and small, is also very slow, specially if the Kindle is charging in sleep mode and not in shutdown mode. For that slow charging, maybe Amazon should have added wireless charging as an added feature to cancel out this shortcoming (it will still be slow to charge, but at least it will be a convenient wireless charging :-) ) But this is all nitpicking;  this a 5-star product!If I were to pick the one thing this tablet shines most at, it is, not surprisingly, on the (Kindle) e-reader side.

I like the integration with Goodreads, you can quote directly from your book to GR, similar to Facebook. There is also a way now to select and copy and paste text from ebooks using the google search tool.Your Goodreads review shows up at the end of the book. The font inside book menus is still way too small and light gray, hard to read (definitions and translations, love the translator too). There is still also no way to customize the screen when reading except for the three colors they had before. I downloaded a screen dim app to dim the screen while reading and use sepia and that seems to help reduce eye strain.I also tried the whole whispersync thing through Audible. It's expensive and confusing but nice if you like to listen to books. The speaker could be louder, but it does have a headphone port.The text to speech works awesome.You can also take a screengrab jpg file by pressing and holding the volume down and power off button at the same time.The only thing I don't like is the lack of Google Apps. You can't even sideload them, it's very proprietary. If you are Amazon friendly, it's no big problem, but it will be annoying for i people to try to switch over.

The ipad, iPhone, and other I devices are not on my desired list.Amazon doesn't allow many Google apps to be installed such as maps, chrome, gmail (app) that work much better than the substitutes that are at their app store.  The browser app Silk they provide is really terrible.  When you use it to visit the Google search site, it really bogs down to almost not working.  If you use the Netflix app, it hardly works, just spins its wheels.What is disappointing about the Fire HDX is that I had expected the device to improve with time but it hasn't.

I recently got $11+ Kindle book with charts and they showed up so small you would need a magnifying glass to see them.  The important info in these charts was unreadable on the HDX.  I had to download the book to my old Samsung tablet so I could expand the material and read it.Other than that one drawback, the HDX is a great tablet.  Very speedy processor, unequaled display.  If you can live without being able to use the pinch-to-expand feature most of the time, then you will be very happy with the Kindle HDX.  BTW, enlarging the print size in settings did not make the material more readable for me.

It is very fast, downloaded videos, music and books well and the screen is beyond description. Took a little while to adapt to it, from other kindle, but the instant help was fantastic, dare I say awesome? Hate that word as it is overused, but in this case, adept. The little girl that helped us was on the line in less then 10 seconds and answered our question, in less time than that. I had tried to get my answer using the FAQ's but could not find it, but the instant help was a God send. All the required screen movements were outlined by the tech guru. I had to laugh at my wife, as we could see the teckie on our screen as she assisted us, and my wife was standing behind me naked and quickly dived away, as she thought the teckie could see us too. I told her not to worry as the view was only one way. Well, I hope it was only one way, or if not, the teckie got a great view. Believe me, this 8.9 HDX is one great device. If you buy it, you will not be sorry. One more thing, the large storage is a must.
