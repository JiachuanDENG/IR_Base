This is being used as 7\" tablet for work and home, where I'm reading PDFs, websites, multiple email apps, music playback, etc. I'm not using it to play complex games or stream 1080p content or higher. I wanted a tablet with a very good screen, but didn't want to spend $500+. The MemoPad HD 7 has 1280x resolution which is what I was after, it makes a big difference. It's very bright, clear and crisp. Excellent quality screen. Battery life was my next big need. This thing has lasted me 3 days of random use with still half a battery to go. It just sleeps when I'm not using it. I leave WiFi on the whole time too. The 10 hour rating, sure, but I'm using it for days at a time between charges so far with my usage (email, websites, PDFs, etc). I'm sure streamed video would take more battery faster. Keep that in mind. So for those kinds of uses, this thing delivers everything with a bright screen and a long life battery for $150 which is way less than the expensive stuff but does the same job basically.If you want something for complex games and intense high definition streaming playback, pay for a more expensive device probably. This is not a substitute for a work station or camera. It's basically a really pretty e-reader, but with very wide open Droid and Google parts/backing. If you just want something to run apps, email, websites, some music, etc, some random youtube, this will do it without needing to pay $300+ more for the same stuff with a big name.", "Title": "Eat your heart out i-mini and nexus.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Author": "J. Harley", "ReviewID": "R22HWX1DUBU3N5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Given the price point and specs, I was very eager to compare the MeMo to my 32GB last gen Nexus 7.  I wish I could compare it to the newer Nexus but last gen will have to do.The MeMo comes packaged pretty much identical to the Nexus 7 with the tablet, micro-USB cable and AC adpater included.  Although the quality of the plastic body isn't exactly on par with the other Asus tablets, it's far from what I would consider cheap feeling, esepcially at this price.  I have the blue model.  The only complaints I have with the body is the placement of the power and volume buttons as well as the USB port.  The design of the case causes a tiny overlap of the back panel around the entire tablet.  This is because the back panel is larger than the front panel.  The overlap doesn't bother me during normal use, however, the placement of the power and sound buttons on the right rear behind the bezel make them a little awkward to find by feel. Although I don't have a case yet, I can only imagine a case would make things a little more cumbersome.  Asus also decided to place the USB port on the top of the tablet which also seems awkward considering the standard location, including on my Nexus 7, is on the bottom.  I often pick the MeMo up and try to operate it upside down based on the plug orientation if it's charging.  I guess I just have to get accustomed to it.The display is beautiful.  Colors are nicely saturated and text and graphics are sharp and bright.  The 1280x800 resolution keeps text sharp even when zoomed in.  Asus includes a calibration tool to further fine-tune and enhance the display if desired.  There were no dead/stuck pixels or noticeable light bleeding along the edges.  The screen doesn't feel like it has any type coating nor do I believe it's Gorilla Glass, although I wouldn't expect either option at this price.  There is a fair amount of friction when swiping on the bare screen and fingerprints accumulate quickly.  I plan to purchase screen protectors to resolve these issues.Performance is generally good on the MeMo.  I don't really notice any difference between the Nexus 7 and MeMo HD during normal operation.  Non-demanding apps like financial, weather, email and social networking apps run just fine with no lag or performance issues.  Less-demanding games like Subway Surfers also run perfect, even when the action speeds up to a frenzied pace.  Where I do encounter trouble is with CPU-intensive games like Asphalt 7.  Asphalt ran on the MeMo but with a slow choppy frame-rate that was noticeably inferior to the Nexus 7.  Even the cut scenes were choppy.  My suggestion is to step up to the Nexus 7 if you are an intense tablet gamer and usually play resource hungry games.  Battery life seems a hair better than my Nexus 7.The front camera resolution is 1.2MP but nothing to write home about.  Pictures appear a little fuzzy, especially in low light.  The front cam video can be set to 480P or 720P and does a decent job when used as a web cam for social video conferencing apps like Skype. The one biggest advantage the MeMo has over the Nexus 7, is a 5MP rear camera which is pretty good.  Still photos and video are acceptably sharp and accurate.  ASUS throws in a ton of features for both still and video formats including creative filters, preset modes, adjustable resolution (video only is adjustable on front camera), exposure compensation, white balance, panorama and HDR, and more.The biggest difference between the Nexus 7 and the MeMo HD is the fact that the Nexus comes with plain vanilla Android.  No extra software is included.  The advantage of plain vanilla Android is that you always stay frequent with the latest Android updates first because it comes directly from Google instead of the manufacturer.  My Nexus is on Android Jellybean version 4.3 while the MeMo is still on Jellybean 4.2.1.  In addition to the above mentioned camera app, the MeMo comes pre-loaded with a ton of pre-installed apps and widgets in a similar looking but slightly different version of Android.  It's not the bleeding edge latest version of Android like the Nexus but is still more recent than most other manufacturers.Overall, unless you routinely use apps and games requiring gobs of horsepower, the MeMo HD is an excellent low-cost tablet.  It's basically a less expensive Nexus 7 with a little less horsepower and memory but makes up for it with useful pre-installed apps, a micro-SD slot and rear facing camera.", "Title": "Excellent Low Cost Alternative", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "NutRoll", "ReviewID": "RM7JHH3RUBM9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've bought 3 of these.  So far they work great.  One is for me, and the other two are for my kids.  I'm in IT and use tablets on a daily basis.  I've used the iPad, Surface, and the Note.  It's not going to be high end like those 3 devices, but for the price you get a good tablet.  I would say the battery lasts (constant use) about 6 to 8 hours.  This can very depending if you are just reading or playing movies and games.  The screen is very responsive.  The only suggestion I have is get a screen protector, because the screen likes to show figure prints.  With the screen protector, you don't have this issue.  The only con I can think of is that it doesn't have a auto brightness, but that hasn't been an issue for me.What we use them for:- Read Kindle books- Watch Netflix and Plex- Take video and pictures (doesn't take bad pictures) No Flash- Check email- Surf the web- Control my Roku's- Vmware View- RDP Client- Mind CraftIf you are getting it for your kids.  There are some nice apps included to protect your kids.  I set them up with my account, and then use the applocker to prevent them from using the Play Store to purchase anything or making any setting changes.  It also has a parental software, but I haven't use that yet (I use opendns of web filtering).Regarding Amazon.  When I first bought this tablet it was priced at $150, but then a week later dropped to $120.  Amazon was great and refunded me the difference.

I have the older model as well that I purchased in May 2013. This one is so much faster and the screen is excellent. What a great value with all the features you'll need.

Why buy a Nexus 7 when you can get this?", "Title": "HD 7 ROCKS!!!", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Author": "B.L.", "ReviewID": "RMN7E379TLTY9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In many ways, this little tablet is a lot like the Nexus in its styling, which isn't surprising since it was made by the same people.On the question of the case, it honestly doesn't feel cheap to me. I also don't really spend much time in physical contact with the back of the tablet, because I keep a cover on it the vast majority of the time.Asus added some software to it that's actually pretty nice. One of the items they put on gives you some cloud storage to use to augment your tablet. It looks like that lasts for a year. Of course, unlike the Nexus line, you can also use a microsd card. (With the revelations about spying on the Internet lately, I think more people will be valuing microsd cards over using cloud storage.)One of the features that really doesn't get much attention for this device is the option of using Miracast. I used it with Actiontec SBWD100A01 ScreenBeam Pro Wireless Display Receiver for WiDi Laptops/ Miracast Devices and was able to very quickly have my tablet screen mirrored to my HD television. This was nice for putting videos up that I wanted to watch on a bigger screen, and for showing off some pictures (particularly to a couple of aging family members who need things to be BIG so they can see them).Miracast basically takes exactly what's on your tablet screen, and puts it on an HDTV (there are some that have this built in, or you can get a separate receiver and connect with HDMI). This is different from something like Chromecast, in that your tablet has to be actually playing the videos or whatever you're doing (where the Chromecast device will take over your Netflix stream if you tell it to). On the other hand, the Miracast approach lets you mirror _anything_ that can show up on the tablet screen. This means no limitations based on who wants to provide special apps or whether they'll give special approval to have their content put on a TV via a mobile device.I've found the performance of this little Asus to be very good, considering its price range. For some people, the extra you'll spend to get up to a 2013 Nexus (or something comparable) won't seem like much, but it IS roughly a 50% additional premium over the base price of this tablet, so that's really not a small difference by comparison.This will run a whole range of apps and games. I'd imagine it'll struggle with the absolute top of the heap Android games meant to be run on devices that cost at least twice as much, but that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. For day-to-day purposes, I've been using it around the house and I took it with me to a technology conference over the weekend (using it as my primary device during that time) and it was easy to carry around and to do everything I needed to do.Note that this won't get Android updates as fast as Nexus (it currently runs 4.2.2, while Nexus is at 4.3). However, many people haven't realized this yet, but Google is working toward having most of their functionality-boosts for Android distributed without having to go through device OEMs for special builds. This will make it less important to be sure that you're buying from a manufacturer that's serious about updating quickly.For the vast majority of people (who want to check email, go to social networking sites, play Candy Crush, and that kind of thing), I'm very comfortable saying that this will be able to meet their needs and the price point is very good for what you get. I truly don't think most people will see enough of a performance boost from going with something more expensive that it's actually worth the money. This is a great buy.", "Title": "Solid Offering From Asus", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Author": "A. Stanton", "ReviewID": "R2V97OHIASSZX4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had the Asus Memo Pad HD 7 for a few hours but so far I'm very pleased.  The tablet seems very well made.  I haven't noticed any creaks or cheap-looking parts.  It looks elegant (I have the blue back) and feels well balanced in the hand.  I like its light weight and appreciate the size of the bezel - not too large to look awkward or too small so you have nothing to hold onto.  Some of the reviews I read mentioned problems with the build quality but I don't find that to be the case at all.I really like the HD display.  The colors are rich (not overly saturated but definitely not \"washed out\" as some reviews have stated) and the text is very sharp.  Setup was a breeze.  The WiFi works very well - web browsing is at least as fast as my PC.  Sound quality is good for such a small device.  And I am very impressed with the cameras, especially the 5 MP rear camera.  Even indoor shots look good.  The camera also produces sharp, colorful 720p videos.It will take awhile until I'm familiar with all the HD 7 has to offer but so far I haven't encountered any negatives.

It has so much going for it. But about every 5 to 10 minutes, it would turn on for about 5 seconds and then turn off.  This was especially frustrating at night with the tablet next to the bed on the nightstand.Also, the SD card would randomly unmount and then remount. It made watching a movie difficult as it would unmount the card several times through a 90 minute movie and each time, we would have to find the place where the movie had just quit. We are not sure if these two problems are related.We returned the original and Amazon sent a replacement but within a week, it also suffered from the same problems. We are also returning this one in exchange for a Nexus 7 (2013).Original review:Wow!  Where to begin.  Just a note on our background for perspective.  In our family, we have a Google Nexus 10, Samsung Note 8, Samsung Galaxy S3 and a Samsung Note 2.  I have also used an iPad extensively for training purposes.  We just purchased the Asus Memo Pad HD 7 for my son who just started college.Asus has come a long ways in the last couple of years.  My wife received an Asus notebook computer for Christmas last year and it has run great for the last 9 months.  When we saw that Asus released the Memo Pad HD 7 for $150, I was intrigued and decided to take the plunge.  My son has been using it for the last 6 days and he is very impressed.  We visited him yesterday and I got to see the Memo Pad for the first time.  I was impressed and here are my thoughts.A little bit about resolution and pixel density.  Apple settled on a resolution density of about 260 to 270 ppi because, as they claimed, the human eye can not differentiate the pixels at higher resolutions.  That begs the question of why Google released the Nexus 10 with a resolution of 300 ppi.  The extra resolution may be waste but they got a lot of mileage out of it claiming the highest tablet resolution.The first thing I looked at on the Memo Pad was the screen.  OK, it does not have as high of resolution as my Note 2 or the Nexus 10, but honestly, it doesn't matter.  Why?  Because I could only tell the difference when I looked really close at very small characters on the screen.  And I had to really look for the difference.  So how high of resolution is practical?  Well, I could tell a slight difference when the tablets were about 5 or 6 inches from my face.  But I don't use tablets this way.  I usually have them about 12 to 18 inches from my face while using them.  At that distance, I honestly could not see the difference in clarity and sharpness.I have looked at the new Nexus 7 and it has a very nice screen.  But I couldn't help asking myself why I would pay an extra $130 more for the Nexus 7 (32 gb version).  I would gain a slightly better screen but would only be able to tell the difference at unrealistically close distances.  But I would loose storage expansion since the Nexus does not have an SD card slot.  By the way, while visiting my son, I wanted to copy a couple of movies to his device.  I could not do it with my Nexus 10.  I had to use my Note 2 to copy the movies to his card, put the card back into his Memo Pad and voila, he had the movies.  Sadly, this is not an option with my Nexus because it does not have an SD card slot. :(Some reviews have complained about the location of the power and volume buttons.  Asus moved the buttons further toward the back, more on the back radius of the device instead of being on the side.  Both my son and I love the new position.  When the buttons are on the side, it almost requires two hands to push the button, one to hold the tablet and then the other to push sidewards on the button.  But by moving the buttons farther towards the back, all that is required is a \"pinch\" with your thumb and finger to engage the button.  From my perspective, this is genius!  I love the button placement.My son installed Google's new replacement for \"Talk\".  It's called \"Hangouts\".  Basically, it's Google's version of Skype and allows video conferencing.  It worked perfectly on my son's Memo Pad HD 7 but my Nexus struggled with the sound.  The sound was choppy and the volume was very low.  A little research revealed that this has been a problem with the Nexus 10 for about a year. It will never make sense to me how Asus can get the application to work flawlessly on a $150 table while Google can't even get it to work correctly on their flagship product, the $500 Nexus 10!  It works great on every other Android device that we have.  But the Nexus 10 couldn't handle it!The camera on the Memo Pad HD 7 seems adequate.  I don't use the cameras on the tablets because my Note 2 has a better camera than any of the tablets.  I always have my phone with me but I don't always have a tablet.  Camera's on tablets are not a big deal to me.The only real negative to the device is that it has no ambient light sensor so the screen will not automatically dim or brighten depending on lighting conditions.  However, I am not sure how much of an impact this actually has.  On my Nexus 10, outside in bright conditions, the brightness never goes to maximum automatically.  I always have to go into the settings and manually set the brightness to max when I want full brightness.One last note on the cheap feel of the tablet.  I don't see it.  Sure, the iPads are always touted for their great build quality and feel.  I personally prefer the lighter weight of the Nexus 10 over the iPad.  The aluminum is cold.  The rubberized back of the Nexus is warm and easy to hold.  The Memo Pad HD 7 does not have the grippy back like the Nexus but it doesn't feel cheap either.  It is slightly thicker than what I would prefer but that is almost a non issue.  I even commented to my son that if Asus simply charged $200 more for the device, people probably would stop commenting on the cheap feel.  They simply have the perception that it must feel cheap because the tablet is so inexpensive!The only three cons that I see in this tablet are:1. SD card size is limited to 32 gb.2. No ambient light sensor.3. Does not have wireless charging.However, every one of these negatives is overcome by it's price.  Asus has created an incredible tablet at an unbelievable price.The bottom line is this.  I know that Asus will soon be releasing the Memo Pad FHD 10.  It will be very similar to the Memo Pad HD 7 only with a larger screen.  The price will probably be somewhere between $300 and $400 and should have Miracast (wireless display).  If I were to sell my Nexus 10 and buy the new Memo Pad FHD 10, I would gain an SD card slot and may even put a little bit of change back into my pocket!  I'm seriously considering it! :)", "Title": "Life is good.

First thing you notice is how light it is - a good bit lighter than the previous MeMo pad.  It is even a little bit lighter than the Ipad Mini.  The next thing you notice is the beautiful screen resolution. Videos are up there with the Fire and the crispness of the print in ebooks is very close to the print on the high resolution Ipod touch 5.  This is a wonderful tablet that allows for a lot of customization.  You now also have the ability to designate where you want your default main storage to be - device or SD card.  You have the ability to set your power saving mode to turn off wifi automatically when you are reading your book and turn on automatically when you move out of your book. You can change the color intensity/scale of your screen. It was easy to set up and wifi has a really good strong hold - no dropped signals so far.  The camera does a very decent job - I think better than the Ipad mini. I didn't notice the back of the device or the screen  being more of a fingerprint magnet than any other device though I am waiting for a screen protector to arrive. The lowest light setting is still not low enough for me but then the Screen Filter app is pretty good at helping to lower the light intensity. I gave it a full charge last night and sitting with wifi on overnight it only lost about 3 percent where the previous Memo would drop a lot more than that.  I bought it mostly to have all of my ebooks from all sources (Kobo, Sony, Amazon, Nook) on one device and to be able to carry it with me all of the time (Ipad mini is too expensive to do this without worry). So for what I bought it for - it is wonderful.  I'm still playing with it but I don't think my opinion will change other than to go higher.

These are really good tablets at a premium price.  The Nexus FHD is a great tablet and affordable; however it has a few bugs to work out and I refuse to buy a tablet with no expansion (MicroSD card) slot.  (Yes, Apple, I am speaking to you too!)  This is the Nexus 7's big downfall as well.  Sorry Google, I don't want everything I have to be living in your cloud.  Some things I want to carry with me!The Samsung Note 8 is a great tablet at a premium price.  Sure it has handwriting recognition, but really, it's just not a good value at $379 to $399!  The Samsung Tab 3 8 is a great 8 inch tablet and that extra inch of space (diagonally) is really kind of nice.  But Samsung wants $299 for it.  C'mon guys, its good, but not that good.

The charger is not a smart charger.  Consequently, you cannot just leave it plugged in.  If the charge on the Asus MeMO 7 gets too low, it has issues with charging.  I had to use a high quality (Apple IPod) charger with a micro HDMI cable to get my unit to charge when it discharged so much that it would no longer charge with the Asus charger.2. No magnetic sensor for auto on and off with a tablet case.3. The back is a slight bit slippery (smooth, not textured).  You need a case to hold this rascal.  Otherwise, keep a good grip on it...4. Only 1GB internal SDRAM.Observations:To keep it affordable you get a lower screen resolution than the Nexus 7 FHD - I hardly notice it.To keep it affordable the processor is a bit slower (but still quad core) and you only get 1GB of RAM memory instead of 2GB - (well you get what you pay for!!!)Suggestions to ASUS to improve this tablet:1. Give us a smart charger with this tablet!2. The MeMO HD 7 needs a sensor to turn the tablet on and off when a tablet cover is used.3. Give it some texture on the back of the tablet to grip it a bit better.4. Find a better place for the power button!  I'd like a power button on the front of the tablet for easy reach, but I guess it is cheaper to have a solid piece of glass on the front of the tablet. Maybe put the power button on the top of the tablet in the future for easy access.5. The obvious stuff - give us more internal memory (32GB), a higher resolution screen and an extra MB of RAM memory (up to 2GB) when you can do it at a good price.6. The cost of your case is a bit high. Other manufacturers are offering leather and leatherette cases that seem more practical to me and at a better price.I really want to thank ASUS for making an affordable tablet with some great features!I heartily recommend that you buy this tablet!  At this price, you won't be disappointed!!  I absolutely love it!For those of you who are considering an 8 inch tablet:I recommend you look at the ASUS MeMO 8 for $199.  There is also the Dell Venue 8 for $179.  Recently the Samsung Tab 3 8 has dropped to $249 which is still a bit high, but if you can find it on sale for $229 or less, it would be worth considering.", "Title": "Great tablet at an affordable price!

I considered getting a case then figured why pay 15-25% of cost of the tablet for a case? I can just replace the tablet.It does everything I want: browse internet, watch internet videos on most sites, android apps...I still need to set up for e-reading.Browsing and use speed are sufficient--I haven't had any serious performance hickups that have made me feel that it would be worth it to spend more $ for faster perfromance. Then again, I am not editing excel, powerpoint, or video...just consuming content.Many options between the ASUS installed apps, Google branded apps, and everything available on android/play. In many cases many there is overlapping in uses/purpose among these 3, so you have many options to choose from.I compared to other known brands under $150. The Walmart 7\" (was it HiSense?) which had a mini-HDMI port but only 8gb, no expandable memory, and I think worse screen. Also compared to the Kindle Fire HD and I think the Memo HD had faster performance (and I liked the idea of sitting outside the Amazon pay gardens).One cool feature is the ability to set up several user profiles so different family members can manage their own desktops, apps, and profile logins. The downside is that it appears to install duplicate copies of apps if both users install it (ie 2 copies of Facebook app). This might eventually affect storage capacity but with 16gb I'm doing ok.One small issue was that, at first, I had trouble using earphones. The earphone jack would not enter all the way into the plug--even with a somewhat above normal amount of pressure. Therefore sound would cut back and forth between the speakers and earphones as connection with the half-inserted jack was made and lost. After a few uses, I was annoyed enough that I decided that I would just force the jack all the way in and return the whole thing if something went wrong. Well, it worked and the plug has been normal ever since--a normal amount of pressure to insert and remove and sound is 100%.All in all pretty good--but I would have loved a mini-HDMI", "Title": "Awesome", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "philip murphy", "ReviewID": "R3T812Y6CY7IR5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a great tablet except for one thing.

The reviews that talked about the merits of the tablet itself are the ones I paid attention to. One thing that seemed to fuel my purchase were the constant comparisons to iPad minis and Samsungs. I know in some aspects, comparisons must be made to make a judgement, but the ones that put down the Memo Pad because it wasn't an iPad were ridiculous. This will be a review based on personal experience with the Memo Pad HD.Over the last month I have thoroughly enjoyed myself. I worried about using a 7\" tablet because I was used to a 10.1\", but it was so heavy! Once it died it was the perfect reason to look into small form factors. Having a smaller budget to work with and knowing what I wanted in a tablet left me with a small group to choose from and this Memo Pad was always at the top.Here's what I like about it:-The 7\" size is a perfect fit for me. Fits in my bag nicely and doesn't add much weight. I can hold it in my hands for a long time without my hands, arms or shoulders getting tired. I have wrist and shoulder injuries and can't hold much weight for long. I bought a case for it and I love that too. It fits perfectly with access to the buttons and camera without having to remove it. It's great!-The speed. The quad-core processor was a huge factor in my decision to buy it. I didn't see another tablet in this size with a quad-core processor AND all the other features I was looking for in my price range.-The memory. 16 GB with 32 GB expandable where my 64GB micro sd works and shows up just fine.-The sound is awesome for such a tiny tablet. Louder than my laptop!-The battery life. It's excellent. Heavy usage all day after a full charge and I never need to charge it more than that. I just plug it in before bed.-HD quality. It's high res screen is evident as every color is bright and vibrant and can be even more enhanced with the built in software.-And finally, it's hot pink....HOT PINK!! :)But there's no HDMI output? ... Not once since I've had it have a had the need for one. Not once.Games play great on it, graphics are amazing and sound is outstanding. It's really fast and it hasn't disappointed me yet.

Quad core is pretty useless if it only has 1 gb of ram--it produces a bottleneck.I bought two and one of them immediately started having a battery problem.  It would charge fine but if you restarted or powered it on without it being plugged in, it would report as having 1% battery left and then shut off.  It was incorrect because the tablet was indeed charged 100%.  You had to make sure you turned it on while it was plugged in for it to report correctly.  I contacted Asus and they wanted me to send it in for warranty service and we would have to be without it for a couple weeks.  This wasn't going to cut it because we used that one for my autistic son and he wasn't going to tolerate it being gone (he wouldn't have understood why).  I wanted Asus to charge me for a new one, let me return that one, and then have them refund the money upon receipt of my return.  They were not willing to do this--a major lapse on their part I feel.  Even though it was after the initial 30 days, a VERY helpful Amazon rep sent me one OVERNIGHT and let me return the malfunctioning one.  Yay Amazon!Now the replacement is having similar battery reporting issues.  It had powered off for low battery last night, I plugged it in while off for a bit, then turned it on.  It reported that it was charging and was at 7%.  It remained as 7% for an hour!  I tried different cables and chargers, still would not increase.  I turned it off and let it charge for a bit while off.  When I turned it on it reported having 40%.  It was charging the whole time, but the meter was not changing.  I have a different battery app on it and both were reporting incorrectly, therefore I must assume it must be something about the hardware around the battery.I really hope this doesn't get to be like the one I returned.  My son relies on this tablet and I hate worrying if it's going to reliably charge or not.  I have to check on it like it's a baby.  Very silly.Otherwise, the screen is good...good responsiveness.

This is the last time I buy Asus! The specs look great for this tablet but in the end its not worth it. It has everything I wanted: GPS, bluetooth, IPS screen, plenty of storage, quad core cpu. I bought this tablet to replace a generic tablet that I use in my car that doesnt have GPS. Primary use has been connecting to 4g, streaming music via bluetooth to the stereo. For that function my generic tablet works GREAT, never have any problems with it, but I wanted GPS so I bought the Memopad.Problems started when trying to connect this to my Virgin wifi 4g hotspot. After less than a minute the connection would freeze. It would say it was connected but it wouldnt transfer data and give network errors. My other devices (phone and Acer laptop) have no problem maintaining the connection to the hotspot. After hours of trial and error the only way to make this work was to disable wifi security on my hotspot. I did this and then the tablet would stay connected. What a terrible work-around, but I could live with this.Next was syncing the bluetooth to my car stereo, which wasn't a problem. But once the bluetooth is connected the tablet displays \"bluetooth has stopped\" errors every few minutes. This is really annoying when trying to use google maps for nav. Nothing I could do would make this error stop, except disabling bluetooth altogether.After a full charge, which surprisingly only took 1 hour, the tablet lasted for about 2. Far cry from the 10 its advertising. For my purpose wouldnt be a problem because I would keep it connected to the charger at all times anyways but buyer discretion anyways. For full disclosure the screen was on most of the time of this 2 hours which probably drained if fast but it advertises up to 10 hours! 2 hours is just long enough for one movie - which you would be using the screen the entire time for anyways.Now I cant even get it to turn back on! The screen is black and plugging it in to charge doesnt bring up the battery charge indicator anymore. Since this is a very common charge plug (samsung style) I have many chargers laying around but none of them work so that's ruled out. I have let the tablet sit for most of the day hoping it would recover but no luck. Dead as a nail leaving me no choice but to return it. Sad because Ive only had this thing for two days. Actually I should be happy that it died now instead of in a few months outside of the warranty.This is my 2nd bad experience with an Asus product.

Everything was great and I really loved this tablet, then it started losing the wireless connection constantly.  My computer was working so I guess the tablet is not working anymore.

Luckily Amazon refunded my money on 31st day of return period. This is the first device I have owned that gave up on charging so quickly.================================================================================================================Memo pad is great value. I really like the screen and weight of this tablet. I use it mainly for reading offline during the train commute but also use it for light browsing at home.The first unit stopped charging within 3 weeks. Amazon promptly replaced it. The second one survived the charging test but showing issues related to Wi-Fi. Someone had noted that the tablet has weak Wi-Fi radio. Well it's the same for me. I am sitting at a point in my house where all my devices are showing maximum Wi-Fi signal strength. Wheeras the memo pad is at the least level.I have an iPad and couple of smartphones in my house that move around the house but never show weak(lowest) Wi-Fi signal.The problem does not end there. The tablet drops connection every now and then. I don't know if it is because I move around in the house (as far as I know there are no dead zones in my house) or its the tendency of the hardware. It's quite frustrating at this point. It could be a defective piece also but my confidence levels have gone very low. I can't deal with WiFi issues for a device that is mainly WiFi.Asus has done well with the software. The android version is not bloated and gives enjoyable experience. Battery is good but can't be compared to the beast like iPad.

It is fast enough to handle all of my casual gaming needs and works great as a kindle alternative. The reason for my three stars begins here.  I finally got to put my rooCASE on it today and then my wife noticed a problem.  She saw an artifact right in the middle of the screen!  At first she thought she had scratched the screen protector but upon further investigation (and removing the screen protector) I found out that this \"artifact\" indeed is a defect in the screen and not the protector or glass.  I am regrettably shipping it back tomorrow for a full refund and will be looking for another tablet to suit my needs.
