It initially had some power and wireless issues, but, as a previous reviewer said, use a screen dimmer and blanker app and you'll get better battery life and less heat. My wireless issues went away with a reboot too. Hey, I thought ya didn't have to do that with Linux! Oh yeah, it's \"almost Linux\" - aka Android. Oh well.  Mine came with Android 4.1, so I'm that much more happy with it. It definitely needs a protective case though.  The screen is a bit better than OK. Once dimmed, it's quite usable. It plays movies clearly without any fuzz or jitter. It surfs the web (well, Firefox does...) It comes with all the USB plugs you'll need too. The sound is a bit low - but clear. Hey, whaddya expect from a speaker the size of a tictac?  The battery life is its defining characteristic. It's short. Unless you bring a charger, it ain't gonna be entertaining you with movies while you're out deer hunting... It does, however, come with a bunch of irritable birds installed. Boy are they fun!  So, for the price of dinner for two at an midscale sit-down restaurant, you get a tablet computer.

Though I had to upgrade to a later edition of Adobe, I can do what I needed with no problem. For the price, the tablet works just as well, if not, better than a friend of mine's kindle fire. It has the same features but without the heavy cost.I also purchased a case with the keyboard and a USB splitter, and the USB is able to support both a keyboard and a mouse, and you can use it just like a laptop computer. (Once you get used to the small keyboard).This is my first tablet, I've always used apple products and It was not difficult to take this out of the box and figure out how to use this.Overall, I'm quite pleased with this product, and so far, it's living up to my expectations for an electronic device.", "Title": "Does more than what I expect.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Author": "Sophie's Manager \"Javier\"", "ReviewID": "RP19X905OA3N8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet has a great potential to provide your recipient a chance to own a great tablet at a great price.

Vidolov", "ReviewID": "R22RRTY8UQE3QE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Pros: Thin, lightCons: Very poor qualityThe item arrived very fast and the price was good, but the device quality is really bad. Examples: the gravity sensor that is used to change orientation doesn't work. I installed a few apps that track it and they detect the sensor, but confirm that the sensor simply doesn't work. As result, the only way I can use the device is as in landscape mode.The accelometer detects some of the movements, but has very low accuracy/sensitivity. The device cannot distinguish whether headphones are plugged in or not. In Skype you need to switch to speaker manually at each call, as it defaults to non-connected headphones. Camera is bad too, but it matches the expectations.Finally, the externals: the charger doesn't even go all the way in and a big metal piece is sticking half way out. Obviously, they used charger for a different device. The glass of the screen is not glued evenly, so it looks like it has peeled off on some edges. I wouldn't recommend.Update: I gave it to my relatives overseas and they now say that the screen cracked while the device was left charging. The charger didn't even fit well, so I won't be surprised if it has overheated due to wrong charger being shipped with the device. Unfortunately, I cannot even return it, as the device is on the other side of the earth.", "Title": "Bad quality", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Author": "Bert", "ReviewID": "RS8VMF4W3BYCN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The device arrived packaged well and looked good enough. It powered on with no troubles and was surprisingly responsive. The viewing angles are pretty awful; in landscape mode, it looks mostly fine, but in portrait mode you don't get much viewing angle to work with. If you tilt it to the side by about 30 degrees the colors will fade out on you. All in all, the hardware seemed to be par for the course for a $70 tablet. I was not disappointed nor was I blown away by the hardware; if I was simply web surfing it would probably be fine. I didn't try streaming any videos with it.However, there is some problem with the OS that doesn't let all apps work correctly on it. I was planning on using this as a dedicated Pandora alarm clock by using Tasker and Pandora to automate it. For the price it would have been a great deal, but Tasker wouldn't run at all. It would install from the Play Store just fine, but would always return an error when attempting to run- it wouldn't load at ALL. I Googled around a lot, and it appears that this type of thing is a common problem with certain tablets. It has something to do with not having the Google Maps libraries installed, and no matter what I tried it absolutely wouldn't let Tasker start up. I am returning this tablet and going with a brand name I recognize.Summary: It may or may not run the apps you want it to. Build quality is decent, but I wouldn't expect it to hold up well to daily usage in the long term. Light usage should be fine. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this tablet as I don't know if it has the OS installed correctly or not, so any apps that I would want to run may not work at all.", "Title": "Barely works- not all apps will install and work correctly.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Author": "John Chladek", "ReviewID": "R2TF9J9PA8P2QY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The price was reasonable then the other tablets out there.

I am able to get onto the internet and pretty much look at anything. My only real issue is the music. Seems it fills up fast with the music which is one of many reason why I wanted it, So I can put music on it. And for some reason it doesn't recognize the music. If anyone knows if you can change that please help me out. If there is an app I can store music on instead that would be great. To free up space. But so far so good. I have most of the apps I would want downloaded. I can skype, kik and anything else. It's like phone without actually being one. Which is cool. Would be cool if it connected to something outside my home so I can be on internet all the time. but that would probably cost me money. I give this product a 5 star anyway.  I am still getting to know it. Again my only problem is the music fills up fast. I'm not able to put all the music I want on it. And it lists most of the music as unknown. They're off CD's. Hope you enjoy it. I recommend buying one. I'm not a fan of the I products. I'm just not. I see a lot of off branded stuff that works just as great. Like this one. the 7 inch through me off. It's a lot bigger than I had imagine. The touch screen makes me feel like Ironman with being able to shrink stuff and move all about.

I was able to get a screen protector, keyboard case, and an adapter, four styluses, and the tablet for all under 90 dollars. The tablet is blue as the seller I had picked stated it was blue. It came with Android 4.1.1 Jellybean. When I first turned it on I was kinda disappointed that it was a bit slower then I was expecting but I had fixed that by downloading Nova Prime Launcher which allowed me to change the home layout, hide apps, etc. I put a 32GB SD Card in the tablet to put the games on the SD card to save memory which also helped a lot. I downloaded a task killer and taught him how to use it to save battery life. I know it states this tablet has about 5 hours of battery life well that's a total lie. It's got about 2 hours, but for the price and how fast it charges back up It doesn't bother us. Its got a one year warranty which is another reason why it's a great buy.

I got this for my mom and for the most part is a nice tablet. Screen is nice, way nicer than I expected. Its responsive to the touch but the machine is a little slow...but this is a cheap tablet so no surprise. Plus I have been spoiled by faster computers. It seems to charge fast and the battery life really isn't to great. probably just get a couple hours. You can still use it if its plugged in and charging if you must. My major complaint is the speaker volume its barely audible. It may be ok if you are in a very quiet place or use decent earbuds but not good to set on a table closeby and listen to Pandora or anything. I may return over the sound volume thing not sure yet. It was disappointing. I will update later if anything arises and feel the need.

I am comparing it to my $199 Kindle Fire.  Perhaps not a fair comparison, I get that.  Out of the box it is much lighter and has a feeling of cheapness compared to KF.  The power cord does not insert all the way, which seems like a malfunction, but it does work.  The battery is much less adequate, running down in less than two hours compared to over 4 for the KF. The display screen is very dark and not able to be lightened sufficiently to be what I consider adequate.  KF is brilliant in this category.  Frequently it misbehaves and needs a total reboot to get it to work at all.  About every other day with this problem.Positives:  It works.  For one third the price of KF you can get a working tablet.  It has Google Play, which means my 8 year old can download and play all the games that Amazon won't let us get on Kindles.  It has a front facing camera (KF does not) so presumably Skype should work, tho I did not test that.  It gets gmail without issue and it can browse the web adequately.Bottom line--After seeing the great display on KF, I would never be satisfied with this.  But I will keep it for my daughter, and she loves it.
