It's a brilliant device. It is the perfect size for an iPad. It fits comfortably in my hand, and yes, i can even fit it in my pockets still (but I'm a 6' 4\" guy so ladies don't expect the same) The keyboard I type this review with on screen is perfect for typing with thumbs. No need to stretch at all, but the buttons aren't like the iPod or iPhone where if you're not careful you'll mistype frequently. The screen resolution is gorgeous, and I love using this as my contact book and planner. Web browsing is very fast but here's where we come to the issue.If you do a search on Google and Apple forums, you will find a lot of complaints that the iPad Mini won't stay connected to WiFi. The iOS 6.0.2 update was supposed to fix this, but it has not. I find my iPad will connect to the router just fine, but it won't always connect to the Internet. I can have three bars of WiFi reception and still not be able to pull up a web page, use my apps, etc. I have found one person who said he solved this by manually inputting the router data, but I still need to try this. More likely I'm hoping that the first batch of these iPads were \"lemons\" so to speak and I'll go to the Apple Store and try to exchange it. I haven't had this device for even a week so hopefully they'll allow me to do so.I am thinking sometime down the road Apple will patch this. But until they do, I simply can't give it the Five Star review I want to give it. I will update this if I find a solution.

The entertainment values coupled with the productivities boost make iPad a worthwhile purchase. For iPad mini however, the competitors are real and decisions are harder than ever before. It maybe the most promising tablet of today but does it deserve your hard earned cash?Below is my observations after using it for some time:-perfect form factor. Feather weight, incredibly thin yet feel substantial.-good for games that require lots of maneuverability.-huge number of existing high quality iPad apps available for iPad mini.-most ideal ebook reader period.-act as a portable digital album with enough real estate for detail showcasing.-perfect for work use. Much lighter to carry and pass around showing demos etc.-less awkward for camera use.-less awkward to pull out in the middle of a bus ride and watch a movie.-sustain much longer period of holding without hand straining.-one hand holding. not quite one hand usage but feels great to be able to hold comfortably in one hand.-bring everywhere, use anywhere. almost pocket sized and serve well as nightstand and desk accessory (alarm clock, desk weather display etc).-perfect travel companion. ultra long battery life. easy to pack, carry and use at all times.-perfect notetaker/notepad. In meetings/conferences, easy to carry around and write on.-perfect for children. it may be mini but the most ideal iPad in terms of size and weight for them.minor negatives:-would prefer bigger screen for mindless browsing.-retina hd for video playback won't hurt.-easier to mistype in portrait mode.-some games just look better on the bigger iPad.-Apple may screw us by releasing a retina display iPad mini with the same price early next year.-not an inexpensive tablet. Costs almost the same as a slightly used iPad 3.-complements but does not completely replace the iPad. May need to carry both in same cases.So who should rush out and buy iPad mini now? Road warriors and avid book readers will most benefit from the perfectly sized iPad mini. It weights only 10.88 oz (0.68 pound) which is at least 10% lighter than the nearest 7\" competitor (nexus 7), not to mention much thinner (a ridiculous 30% thinner) and with a larger screen to boost! the most current iPad with its 1.44 pounds, is more than double the weight of mini which maybe significant if you are holding and carrying it all day. gamers may be slightly disappointed since it is equipped with the old A5 processor chip and the non-retina display (1024 x 768) is less than ideal when compared with the current retina (2048 x 1536) iPad. However, the screen resolution is very much comparable to its current 7\" competitors where 1280 x 800 pixels is the norm. But keep in mind that the iPad mini processor (dual core 1.0 Ghz 512mb RAM) is the weakest among its peers (nexus 7 quad core 1.2 GHz 1GB RAM, kindle hd dual core 1.2 GHz 1GB RAM). I doubt any one will notice the difference but performance geeks may beg to differ.I am also a bit disappointed that the iPad mini with its much smaller size and lower screen resolution, does not have significantly better battery life compared to its bigger sibling. I was also hoping to see a micro usb and hdmi port, but that didn't materialize.Photographers rejoice! With its perfect size, we can finally find reasons to use iPad mini as a camera as well. Its 5 MP rear camera resolution is adequate for taking casual pictures as it has the same resolution as its more expensive sibling. Shooting 1080p videos is also supported which is great. It feels really comfortable holding the iPad mini for shooting videos given its ample screen size in an ultra lightweight package. iPad mini beats out all its closest competitors, including google nexus 7 and kindle hd as they have 0 MP. they don't come with rear facing camera at all! Unfortunately wifi-only iPad mini does not come with GPS, otherwise Garmin, watch out! It would have make a perfect portable navigation system. Its the one area where nexus 7 has an edge as it has both NFC and GPS built in. NFC (Near field Communication) is an amazing piece of technology that allows us to use our mobile device as credit card payments and even transferring of data or images to other NFC-enabled devices just by touching. I hope Apple can consider adding this to their future products as this would make iPad mini even more awesome. iPad mini however has a 64 GB storage option (which I recommend) and 4G LTE connectivity option which are not available among its rivals. Mini tablets cross shoppers may also find the iPad mini physical appearance much more appealing. While kindle hd and nexus 7 do feel good in my hands, iPad mini feels even better as the build quality is undeniably more superior. Who doesn't like the sexy unibody aluminum build? The huge library of available iPad apps is also a deciding factor since only a fraction of android apps are designed for tablet use. There is no objective way to measure it, but I just found Apple iOS more user friendly than the android so it maybe more appealing to broader audiences.Now come the most interesting part. iPad mini maybe all great, but does it justify the premium? more specifically, should we pay an extra $130 for it? after all, 7\" kindle fire hd and nexus 7 come at $199 whereas iPad mini is listed at the $329 starting price. to make things harder, is iPad mini too expensive even compared to the new iPad which comes listed at $499 which btw is only 52% more expensive with significantly better specs. With mini tablets especially, physical properties are extremely important. 10% lighter and 30% thinner coupled with 35% more viewing area compared to its 7\" rivals, iPad mini scores huge points in this area. Apple iOS ecosystem with its huge library of high quality iPad apps may add some bonus points as well. All these makes paying an extra $130 worth it. Assuming similar depreciation of 35% like the iPad 3 after 8 months, savvy shoppers who could afford to wait, can get an absolute steal at $215, which is very much comparable to its rivals prices. Comparing iPad mini and iPad is much harder since the new iPad is significantly more powerful with a much larger screen and weight. I would think they target slightly different market and each complements  the other quite well without cannibalizing each other. However, if a retina display iPad mini ever comes out, I won't be surprised if more people choose it over iPad as their only tablet.For people considering trading in their iPad 3 for a mini, a significant drop in text quality may have to be expected. There is no noticeable differences to me while browsing images, however while reading large blocks of text, the drop in text quality is quite pronounced. Text appeared to be fuzzy and less crisp (especially in foreign characters where each character has more strokes), when compared to the razor sharp and clear text in retina display. For me personally, it is a tradeoff I am willing to make for extreme portability with almost identical features.Some people may criticize Apple for essentially releasing the same product year after year, just in slightly different form (may go as far as the original iPod). They are completely missing the point. People just have totally different feelings and emotions, and most certainly unique experiences interacting with different variances of the product. I certainly have as much fun playing with my iPod touch as my iPad mini. I can't wait to hear stories about how people interacted with their mini in ways they haven't done it before. I am sure we can always find novel creative ways to expand the use case scenarios for our beloved iPad mini.Besides practical reasons to owning it, there are aesthetics reasons too. iPad mini is just so beautiful to look at as it is indeed a piece of engineering marvel. I see iPad mini as the perfect travel entertainment device where as iPad is the perfect home entertainment device. Happy hunting!", "Title": "Is iPad mini a worthy purchase? Read on to find out!", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Author": "David Perez", "ReviewID": "RR4RP1OIUXXIS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the 32gb LTE version and I am VERY satisfied with my purchase. I have the iPad 4, but wanted something smaller that was a bit more portable for traveling. I am so glad I made this purchase as it met my needs with overwhelming excitement. First, the size makes it feel easier to use for day-to-day activities such as web surfing and checking email. While I can do this with the iPad 4, the mini makes the user experience greater as there is less to tote around and is much much lighter than the iPad 4. After holding the iPad 4 for 30 minutes, it begins to feel like a brick. Holding the mini for 30 minutes doesn't even begin to tire out each of your arms from holding it for almost any period of time.Regarding the screen, it shows beautiful vibrant colors compared to the latest-gen iPad's. Owning both and comparing them side-by-side, I cannot tell the difference in quality while watching the same content on each of the units simultaneously. While I'm sure \"retina display\" is better in one way or another, it's hard to discern with the human eye as to the visual difference between the two. It's like comparing a 720p and a 1080p TV at 10 feet away - both look the same in regards to picture quality because the human eye cannot see the difference. For those that can \"see\" a difference, you must be holding the unit extremely close to your face (closer than just reading distance) or the \"retina display is better\" claim has tricked your mind into thinking you're seeing something that's simply not there. All of my family, including my young children, cannot tell the difference when watching movies or reading text. Even the content on my iPhone 5 seems a bit fuzzy, however when I pinch and zoom, it all goes away. The same is true of my iPad 4 which relates to the iPad mini. Don't let anyone fool you, the picture is gorgeous.As far as the LTE is concerned, it's lightning fast, however it will depend on your area. I can connect at 32mbps down and 9.5 mbps up in my area which is faster than my home broadband connection. I have no trouble hooking up to LTE and I always have a constant signal around my city. In addition, I have zero problems connecting to any wifi source. Here's the link to my screen capture from Speed Test: [...] I have a an iPad 2, iPad 4, iPhone 5's and the iPad mini. Across all platforms, the performance is fantastic albeit the performance on the iPad 2 is much slower in comparison to the mini, even though it has the same processor. My test is Sky Gamblers which plays a bit choppy on my iPad 2, but plays exactly the same as on my iPad 4 with an A6X processor.I added an Otterbox case and it nearly doubled the size of the unit. But WAIT!!!! This is a GOOD thing. It makes the iPad feel extremely comfortable in your hand and you will not lose grip as you may with the unit by itself since it's so thin and sleek. I have Otterbox Defender cases on all of my products mentioned above and swear by them. They are the best investment I've made in regards to accessories.In conclusion, this is one helluva product and I'm glad I purchased it. Do NOT be discouraged by the \"retina display\" hoopla that makes it seems as this is an inferior iPad. It's not in any way, shape or form. Using an iPad 4 to compare performance, the iPad mini mimics the exact performance that the iPad does, for the exception of programs opening about a half-second slower. I can definitely live with that.

I paid just as much for it as I would have directly from apple, so I was not expecting any troubles. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I turn my new iPad mini on and the screen immediately begins flickering and has white streaks through the screen. Garbage. Absolute garbage. Also, this store is unable to do exchanges through amazon, so in order for me to get a working iPad, I now have to take the time to mail the defective one back, wait for the money to be put back on my account, and then place another order (from a different store obviously). I am extremely disappointed.", "Title": "Do Not Buy From This Store", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Author": "Y. Zhou", "ReviewID": "R3ACF2HMPTS97M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "HiBefore I give you the review, let me tell you about my background. I am a college student who is very into tech. I've owned many tablets, and even more phones. I buy them used and sell them used, so I swap between a lot of devices. It's a bad habit, I know, but I really want to find that perfect device.Tablets I've owned:-iPad 1,2,3-Galaxy Tab 10.1-Nexus 7 (2012)I bought the iPad mini because I recently bought an iPhone 5 (from Nexus 4) to compliment my Macbook Air. I always went with Android devices because of how cheap they were, but I decided to splurge on an iOS/Mac ecosystem and see how well they sync together. I chose the iPad Mini because I think that the original iPads are too big. Also I like how thin the bezels are for the mini.So now you know why I bought the mini, here are my list of Pros and Cons.PROS:- Display. Yes I know, it's not retina, but it is still an IPS display. I would take an IPS display with 720p over any other display with 1080p. It's vibrant, colors are sharp. A retina would make it even better, but for me it's not that big of a deal.- Size and weight. So slim and light it's sexy. This is the main reason I picked this Mini over and iPad with retina. All the old iPads I've used, I never find myself using them often because it's tiring to hold them up for anything longer than a few minutes. WIth the mini, it's much easier.- Build quality. The main reason I've always envied apple users, their products are always such beauties.- iPad specific apps. Android tablet apps are just scaled up versions of phone apps, which makes the experience very dull. On the iPad, many apps have iPad versions, which uses the screen real-estate much better.- Internet. Browsing the web in safari is much better experience than on an Android tablet. It's faster, smoother, and everything just fits on the screen.CONS:iTunes. The lack of file management in iOS. This is the MAIN reason I'm having such a frustrating time on the iPad.  I like my iPhone, but dislike the iPad because of iTunes. It boils down to what I do on my iPhone vs what I do on my iPad. On the iPhone, I generally use it to go online, call/text, take pics, siri, youtube, email, etc. Very common stuff. On the iPad however, all I really do is read ebooks and watch videos. Given that, the reason I dislike the iPad is that it relies on iTunes way too much. I can't simply drag and drop video/ebook files into the ipad like I can do with any android device, I have to sync through iTunes. That itself is not that big of a deal, EXCEPT that iTunes only recognizes SOME of the very common files. For example, I have a lot of TV series saved on my Computer. Mostly all TV series files and some movie files are in AVI format, which is an extremely common video file type, but iTunes does not support it. If I wanted to get those files onto  my iPad, I'd have to convert the entire collection from AVI to MP4 individually, then drag them into iTunes, then sync it up with my iPad.Lightning. It's rare, and very expensive. Basically all the microUSB chargers I have are useless now. Not many people have the new 8pin lightning cords lying around, so you're SOL if you go out without your cord and your iPad dies on you. With android devices, there are microUSBs all over my house and in my car, so do most of my friends, so it's no worry. Also the lightning cords are very expensive. Often $20+. MicroUSBs, on the other hand, is often less than $2. The only clear advantage I can see of owning a lightning is that you can plug it in any side you want...big whoop.Lack of stereo speakers. Since I watch videos on it all the time, I wished it had stereo speakers like the Nexus 10 and the new Nexus 7.CONCLUSION:So there's my reasons. I am not a fanboy of android nor apple, they both have their pros and cons. The iPad is still the best tablet to browse the web for, which is probably what a lot of you will do. But if you're like me and sees yourself watching videos on it and reading ebooks, and has a huge library saved in your computer, then you might want to get an android tablet.", "Title": "Coming from Android, geek perspective.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "Jeremy Floyd", "ReviewID": "R2JD6ORJRM14S0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Whether this is your first iPad or a replacement to an aging iPad, then you should consider the good, bad and the ugly before adding to your cart. I replaced a 32GB 1G iPad with a 32GB wi-fi mini. So, of course, the mini adds some features right off the bat that make it a major improvement over the 1G, but most importantly, this device travels with me more often than my previous iPad ever did.The GoodThe size! The mini seems perfectly designed for two thumb typing. Even with split-screen dock keyboard, I always found the on-screen keyboard to be cumbersome and difficult.Siri on the iPad is quite convenient as a desktop accessory and a mobile feature.The BadWhen compared side by side with Samsung or the Amazon Fire HD, the device doesn't stack up with display, audio, and peripheral input. This is the bad that everyone points to and there are some features lacking (some of which will not be resolved in future versions).The lightning connector - having apple devices for over a decade has many 30-pin connectors laying around the house. Now we have to lightning connectors in the house, so they are in hot demand. The connector doesn't always fit firmly, so sometimes I check the device to a disappointing 16% charge.The UglyThe display doesn't bother me as much as others, but the lack of retina display has bothered a number of owners. Of course this will be resolved soon.In the end, I would buy it again, and I don't have any regrets knowing that improved features are on the way.", "Title": "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of the iPad Mini", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "Margaux Paschke", "ReviewID": "R3AB1PD2PV51H7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very non-technical review -- the newest version of the iPad rocks with its portability. This iPad mini easily slips into a purse or jacket pocket making it easy to carry around for either a female or male. You get all of the perks of the regular iPad with the extra benefit of being able to carry it around with you everywhere. Simply amazing!I love my iPad and use it more than any other electronic devise but I mourned its lack of portability. The iPad's size is great for watching tv, movies, reading books or light document work but a hassle to carry around. I had to dig out my huge purse to carry it around anywhere and the weight and size was cumbersome. This iPad mini is slimmer, lighter and smaller and oh so convenient to take with me when I leave the house.The smaller size does impact my document usage but since I use it mostly for entertainment, this is really minor for me but will affect those who use the iPad for work. I keep hearing the iPad mini lacks the same power (slower processor) as the iPad but I don't feel it. I've played games on it, watched videos, etc. without any noticeable difference. Maybe power is an issue with heavy document usage? I did deduct a half star for the lower screen resolution than the newest iPad while keeping the price tag around $350. Seriously?  The lower resolution is not so much apparent on iTunes purchases but more visible on home video or other sourced digital media.How does Apple seduce me into wanting their newest product (although, I'm proud so say I avoided their siren's call for the iPhone 5) and after using it, making it the newest best thing I cannot live without? Husband says it makes the regular iPad positively clunky and almost archaic but I think it's more sinister - it makes me appreciate the iPad for home use and the iPad mini for away-from-home use. Great, now I've used up my gift allowance for all of 2013....but you won't find me complaining this Christmas, birthday or anniversary because the iPad mini is worth it!Overall, if you can splurge this is the one thing you really want to spend your money on.

Later, I was at the apple store with my sister while she got her iPhone 5 fixed, and I picked up the mini for the first time. Not only does it feel much more classy and expensive, it was thinner, lighter, and had a perfect screen size. The keyboard is so easy to type on, I'm actually using it right now. When I am using it in public I get a lot of comments because some people haven't seen it yet!

This will be probably considered biased, being that I have way too many Apple products to count (iMacs, macbooks, mac mini, iphones, ipods, ipads etc..) so if you're not a fan of the truly brilliant company that is Apple, then you probably don't want to read this review.When I first heard of the mini coming out, I thought it was a joke, like really? Isn't that what the iPod touch is for? But when you go and hold this iPad, you truly see the difference between it's brothers and competition, and realize it is a great product in and of itself. The size of the screen is perfect, big enough to enjoy pictures / video, thin and light enough to toss in a bag on the go. I have the big brother New iPad, or iPad 3 or 4, whatever the heck they call it, and this is definitely a great individual product, and not just a scale down.I do have an Kindle Fire HD 7\" and the iPad Mini is wider and longer, so the screen is a bit bigger. It looks great, feels great in your hands, even though I would recommend a case for it to add some girth, because even though it does feel great naked, it just seems way too easy to drop and slip out of your hands.What more can I really say?

True, it looks sharper than the iPad 2 at first glance, because the pixels are spread over a considerably smaller screen, but still, when you hold it close at reading distance, you can see the pixels, and the Retina Displays on the other iPads have conditioned me to expect NO pixellation - just sharp, sharp viewing even with nose almost on the screen. If sharper viewing is what you want in a 7\" tablet, you will have to get the Google Nexus 7 or the Kindle HD Fire - Displaymate, which specializes in monitor calibration and reviews, grades both of those competitors higher than the iPad mini. (I will post the link to the Displaymate review in \"Comments.\")But neither the Nexus 7 nor the Kindle HD Fire has perfected the overall \"user experience\" like Apple, or has so many useful, and highly-tuned, Apps.Also, iPad minis are flying off the shelves. Most adults are buying minis for themselve, but a sizeable chunk, like me, are buying them for their kids since they only cost $29 more than the iPod Touch, the previous kids' favorite.Why, if the mini is just shy of perfection and we know (strongly suspect?) that Apple will, indeed, introduce a Retina Display mini next year, is it nevertheless such a big hit this year?Well, first of all, you have to hold it to believe it. It just feels so _right_. The mini is remarkably thin, just like the new iPhone 5 and new iPod Touch (5th gen). This slimness translates into really light weight, and the more squared edges translate into much easier holding. It is considerably bigger, in terms of surface area, than most other 7\" class tablets, but holds just as comfortably in the hand and makes other 7\" class tablets feel clunky and cheap in comparisonApple favored the books and web browsing experiences over movie/tv viewing. The screen is close to 4:3, so 16:9 movies/tv end up being letterboxed. But since the Apple has more square inches of viewing surface than other 7\" class tablets to begin with (the Apple is actually 7.85\" on the diagonal), the net resulting picture is about the same actual size as the \"full screen\" version on other 7\" class tablets.The smaller size with much lighter weight totally changes the viewing/reading experience. Hold it in one hand while you lie in bed and your wrist doesn't feel strained from the weight of a full-sized iPad. With two hands you can view or read for hours, just like on an e-reader.If this had a Retina Display, I'd give it 5 stars, and wish I could give it 6 or 7, it's THAT good.For kids (who read a lot less, and play games a lot more), this IS 5 star, right out of the box. An amazing 10-13 hours of battery life; a good screen, the Apple App universe. It is MUCH better proportioned for kids' smaller hands than the full-sized iPad (which probably feels to their hands like a 12.5\" would feel to us).In terms of hardware, this has the same zippy processor as the iPad 2, but a vastly upgraded camera on both the front and back. The front is now HD FaceTime, the back is 5 megapixels with autofocus (but no flash). It has SIRI. It has 16gb, which should be fine for a lot of \"fat\" video games; the $299 iPod Touch has 32gb, but that is positioned more as a portable media player with emphasis on \"music.\"My 8 y.o. daughter uses this to watch Netflix, watch Amazon Instant Video, do dental surgery (there is a kids App for that? good grief and shades of Little Shop of Horrors!), practice foreign languages, etc., etc., etc. Formerly she borrowed her mom's iPad 2, but she much prefers this, though I can't tell whether that is because it's her \"own\" or because it works better (but she didn't complain that I didn't get her an iPad 2, and that would have cost the same price - iPad 2's were discounted this season, while minis were not).There is a lot of speculation about why Apple didn't come out with a Retina Display on this one out of the box. Here are my thoughts:1. Apple sold a LOT of original iPads and iPad 2s and there wasn't really \"consumer demand\" for the Retina Display on the iPad 3. This was more a technology \"push\" from Apple than a \"must have\" from consumers. As more e-readers transfer their allegiance from reflective \"e-ink\" e-readers to tv-screen style tablets, though, Retina Display or its equivalent is more and more of a \"must have.\"2. Current Retina Display technology on larger devices - above the size of iPhones - calls for really, really bright LED's behind the screen - the \"aperture\" or \"tiny window\" for the pixel is so small on the larger Retina Display screens that you need a stronger light to illuminate it (the transistors have to fit in the same \"cell\" as the display pixel, which is why the \"aperture\" is relatively as well as absolutely smaller). So you need more lights, or larger lights, PLUS a bigger battery to generate all that light. This is why the iPad 3, and even the iPad 4, got heavier, fatter, and ran hotter than the slimmer, cooler iPad 2.- Now there seems to be new screen technology emerging that might solve some of these problems, but apparently the \"yield\" (usable to unusable percentage of production) is very low on the larger versions of these screens (and Apple apparently has a screen shortage even on the lower-tech iPad mini screen).3. In terms of actual usage patterns, some reviewers are reporting they prefer the smaller, lighter iPad mini over the sharper, but larger and heavier, iPad 3 or iPad 4. Yes, they know the screen colors are more accurate on the full-sized iPads, and the screen resolution can't be beat -but what they prefer hauling around is the mini. The mini screen is sharp \"enough.\"4. Early adopters are mostly adults. But based on how my kid has taken to the mini, this is THE computer device the industry has been predicting since the '70's - the computer that will transform education. And, I think, play, at least if you consider it \"transformational\" if kids spend all their game time on a tablet instead of on a Wii or DS etc. Personally, I think there is a real possibility these tablets will change Nintendo into a niche player and drive Sony out of the portable market. I do believe hard-core gamers will stick with  xBox and Playstation, but the market for the mini is potentially much larger than the market for console players. The number of additional kids owning these will more than off-set the number of adults who hold out for a Retina Display. For kids - this is perfect, as is.I am completely fussy, and even I am tempted by the mini. As much as I KNOW Apple will solve the technological and size and weight problems with a mini Retina Display in the near future - in less than a year - I still would like to have one now, because it is so easy to hold and use. I want my kid's iPad mini in a way I NEVER wanted my wife's iPad 2 (I actually preferred the Touch to the iPad 2). It is THE ideal sized cafe/travel tablet/reader, and after spending many, many hours with Android (4.0, 4.1, 4.2) on the MUCH better priced Nexus 7, I STILL prefer the iPad mini.So I can review this - I \"borrowed\" my kid's mini to do so - but I'm going to fight the good fight to resist getting my own.

The latest generation of Apple products has really brought production quality to a new level. The mini is ridiculously thin and light, build quality on this is a generation or two ahead of the the iPad retina. This is one of those products you really need to pick up and handle to really appreciate.The display is not retina quality, but it's easily better than the iPad 1 or the iPad 2. Colors are good and brightness is good. I really like that they were able to shrink the bevels on the sides, it keeps the mini portable enough to slide in your pocket in a pinch. It's not comfortable in the back pocket of your jeans, but it fits there for short trips or if you need a hand in a hurry.I haven't pushed performance enough yet so it's hard to say where it sets with regards to that. Trying out a few videos I didn't notice any lag or missed frames and the actual UI is smooth and responsive. Because it's screen is lower resolution, you can still play iPad games on it with a good frame rate.Sound is surprisingly good and loud for a product this size. The only downsize to the sound is the fact that the stereo speakers are placed near each other on one of the narrow sides of the device. In cinema/ landscape orientation, the sound is on one side or the other. Even in portrait orientation, the stereo effect is not great. I tend to listen using headphones so I'm not sure it's a huge issue. It's a 3.5 star sound system, great sound, but frustrating placement.The lightning adaptor is a nice upgrade. You do lose access to older accessories, but it's quicker to use than the 30 pin adaptor (or microUSB, but that's another story). Charging is fast, 30 minutes to top it off which is awesome.------Update ------After a few weeks of use, I've only grown to like this more. It's so small, it's easy to tote along everywhere. I've been doing some photo editing on it and it works fairly well, but sometimes when you are trying complex edits or trying to undo a bunch of things in a row there is a bit of lag. I still haven't noticed the lag on video playback some of the other reviewer mention, but again I don't use YouTube very much.------Comparison Shopping ------The iPad mini shines when:* Apps are a priority (in my case, access to a few specific iPad only apps is a big showstopper)* Weight and portability are a important* You want the rear facing camera (The iPad 4G has this too)* You have invested in Apple accessories* Ease of use is a big concern* A solid, well engineered product appeals to youThe iPad 4th gen shines when:* Reading is your biggest use, the retina display is fantastic and the mini doesn't compete.* You want a future proof product; the A6X chip is a scorcher compared to the mini and it is almost certain to be supported longer.* The bigger size is an assetThe Nexus or the Kindle Shine when:* Price is your biggest concern* Nexus has built in GPS and NFC (though navigation is limited unless you get the 3G version)* You are using it exclusively for web surfing, reading PDFs, and watching videos.* Hack-ability and open-ness are important* You are invested in the Google or Amazon's eco-system", "Title": "Best iPad Mini Ever", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Author": "Susan \"Susan\"", "ReviewID": "R151BWXP7YT4A8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I pre ordered my iPad mini and have been using it several weeksI travel a lot.

I've owned every iteration of the iPhone and iPad that's ever come out.  In Black and White.  I wait online and install the system updates (now OTA) the minute they are released.  I tell you this so you will know that I'm really fond of Apple's iOS products.So when the iPad Mini came out, I had to get it to supplement my new, new iPad.  You know what?  It has just not excited me.  It's really not that the 1024x768 resolution is bad, after all, with a smaller screen size, the pixel density increases slightly, but its certainly discernible from the retina display of the new iPads.I just find that the form factor is not so significantly different that I'm amazed and delighted by how much I can do with a smaller device.  Nor am I bowled over by its price.  The stereo speakers are there, but no more noticeably louder than my full-sized iPad with only one speaker.  It's really just there.  In other words, it's more of the same and does not give me the satisfaction of an all-new device.  Now, as I mentioned, I love iOS, and the new betas for iOS 7 will definitely spark some more life into this device, but as I look back and forth between my new, new iPad and my new iPad Mini, all I can do is shrug and say, \"Meh...\"Besides a retina display, what can Apple do to make me espouse the iPad mini as \"magical\"?  It's not hard... I want a louder set of speakers (my wife's 7\" Kindle Fire HD has a booming set of speakers), native apps that not only replace or duplicate the ones on a full size iPad, but rather supplement them so if the two units are together, the functionality increases.  For example, what if any two iPads placed next to each other could extend the screen size?  What if I could place my iPad mini next to my full sized iPad and during Facetime, the iPad mini could show my own face full screen while the large iPad showed the other person's (instead of it being in a little window)?  Finally, they should drop the price by another $50-$75 or, god-forbid, increase the new full sized iPads by $100 to differentiate the price points.Right now, this fanboy is not the world's biggest fan of the iPad mini.  Will I keep it?  Of course, but just until the next one is released.  I have to own each iteration of these devices after all.  However, am I feeling more than just a bit lured by the new Google and Asus tablets...? You'd better believe it.  I'm looking for different, newer, better, more innovative.  One more version, I tell myself... but for the time, I won't recommend an iPad mini if you already own the full-sized iPad.  It's a downgrade.UPDATE: February 2014Now that I also own the iPad Air and Retina iPad Mini, my conclusion is that Apple is starting to fall from grace.  The build quality of the devices continue to be among the industry's very best but innovation seems to have slowed to a near halt.  One more generation of iPhones, iPad and Apple TV for me coming up and if I'm no longer impressed, they will then have lost my business, but more importantly, my brand loyalty.

After my poor experience with the Nexus 7 I went with the overpriced iPad. I love my iPhone, but wasn't looking to essentially get a bigger version of it (with a wi-fi only model). While they are very similar devices, I have found unique uses for my iPad. First off, there are an excellent selection of apps, a huge advantage the App store has over Google Play. I have one for taking handwritten notes, organizing my notes, performing sit ups, scanning documents, reading articles, books, and comics, utilizing Google Drive, dating and playing some games. Android devices have many of these features, but not the quantity or quality.The iPad itself performs well. Switching between screens and using the new iOS 7 changes have been fine. Of course, there are some changes I do not like, but that's not particular to this machine. I prefer the mini sized iPad versus the normal size for holding and travel. It's light and doesn't take up much space. The screen is wonderful for reading and takes decent pictures.Overpriced it is, I still think it's a great tablet.

I have a MacBookPro & an iPhone 4S, 16 GB. A priority for me is having products that do what I want understandably, reliably & w convenient, knowledgable & quick tech support if needed. I have found Apple products are that way so didn't even consider any other brands.I find that the specs for this & the iPhone 4S are somewhat similar--processor, camera, etc & I got the 16 GB version for both.I was using my MacBookPro for business & to show a presentation at the table. But, while very light for a laptop, it still was big to carry around.I find that now I don't even turn on my Mac every day. I can browse email & the web & a lot of apps just fine on it.Since I'm new to the iPad, I wasn't sure just how useful it would be. Well it is. It makes a good e-book reader. Although only have a couple so far. I got the Kindle app since one e-book I wanted needed that format.I also is a very nice size to carry around w me. I got a new purse that is not large but has a pocket on the outside into which the iPad mini in its case just fits.I also like that I can do iMessages on all 3 of my devices & while I can do things on the iPhone, the iPad mini is much easier to read & type on.I bought the Belkin case at BestBuy that looks like a pad folio w snap in holder for the iPad. So its not totally obvious that its an iPad, looks nice & both protects & provides a nice stand for it that works well on table or on my lap.I'm also using my iPad mini rather than a hard cover bible for church, using the YouVersion app. The combo is agile enough to jump around to different passages & easier to carry.As one who is a touch typist, I was concerned about whether I would need an external keyboard, but have found that I can type pretty well on it. Not quite usual fingering--more like several finger typing but have been able to use it to take notes at seminars & meetings. This using the Pages app. I also have purchased the Keynote Ap thinking I would use it, but really use the free Slide Shark to handle a co presentation.  I'm thinking of purchasing the Numbers app. Need to review how to sync the Apple apps between the mini & my Mac.As far as connectors, don't have the myriad of Apple accessories that some are concerned about. I had previously gotten the InCase car charger from the Apple store for my iPhone (after the one I got at Walmart quit working after 8 mo). This is the kind that is in 2 pieces so one plugs into the car power outlet & then any usb plug can plug into it.  So if my iPad Mini needs charging, I can use its cord to plug into the outlet & charge in the car.Also, I bought it at the Apple Store & since I had One to One through my Mac, I could use it to learn my iPhone & my iPad. Unfortunately having recently moved to Portland, OR, the Apple Store is way across town so not as convenient as I was used to. Haven't been there yet. I need to go as sometimes I tap to close a Safari window or click on a link w no response. So should get the touch screen checked (as I did w the touchpad on my previous MacBookPro where they find certain portions not responsive & fixed it, quickly.Speaking of the Apple Store, I like the fact that I have that resource--even though now its less convenient than it was.  This is 1 reason that I like Apple products. If there is an issue,  I remember w other devices (Windows computers & Windows phone) where the service was not very good. My windows phone had major issues (couldn't properly handle daylight savings time & other issues). Verizon people were nice but didn't really help so got runaround & some never did get answers.  They knew a lot of basic stuff, but now w smart phones, they can't know all of them well.Also previously w a device from 1 co & OS from another & then other apps, I have gotten the run around w each blaming the other & being caught between them. Or maybe not even blaming the other but having to make multiple contacts to get an answer.I have found Apple Stores to be on top of things & their service turn around time is very fast--several times faster than they had promised.The other thing w Apple products that I have found is that they just work. I've had hardware & software failures w other computers & phones. I got my iPad Mini I think in early March. Working fine. My iPhone 4S is 22 mo old & working fine (they had to do a reset & upgrade to iOS6 1 time, quickly taken care of at the Apple Store).So for me, having products that do what I want, reliably & w tech support that quickly takes care of any issues that may arise is very important. I had not found that level of reliability & tech support w other products. I expect the same level of continued reliability & service if needed w my iPad Mini.", "Title": "Constantly using my iPad mini, reliable Apple product", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "A Guy in Indianapolis", "ReviewID": "R3J5LJI5PL2B7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Lightweight but solid-feeling.

The iSight camera takes fantastic photos, and through Photo Stream (enabled on your device) you are able to share up to 1000 photos with others on your network. (Beautiful video quality too!  Get the Action Movie FX app to have a lot of fun posting to Facebook.)  The iPod touch 5th does have the iSight camera too, but a 4\" screen, which for me is a tad small to see and edit photos as I would like to do.The mini's 7.9\" screen size is very functional for 'on the go' email, photo viewing, games and makes reading my Kindle books (free Kindle app available) much more enjoyable.Overall dimensions of the device make it very slim and lightweight, making slipping it into my purse or backpack a breeze.Height:7.87 inches (200 mm)Width:5.3 inches (134.7 mm)Depth:0.28 inch (7.2 mm)Weight:0.68 pound (308 g)The Apple iPad mini pairs easily with Bluetooth devices like keyboards and headsets too.  I don't really see the point in pairing with a keyboard, as with this screen size typing up a term paper is possible - but not likely.  However, pairing with a stereo Bluetooth headset to enjoy a movie or listen to music works really well and makes for fun entertainment during the morning commute. (Assuming you're not driving!)Facetime (720P) works well on the mini, as does emailing - assuming you have a solid Wifi connection; 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi (802.11n 2.4GHz and 5GHz). NOTE: Many apps and functions of all iOS devices, depend upon Wifi to be enabled and to have a solid connection before they will work correctly.Good news for anyone who wants to enjoy this device.Like the iPad, the mini has accessibility features that allow users with disabilities to use the device.

So purchasing anything Mac is having to learn to do things differently, of course as far as compatibility with apps, etc.  This is a treat for my senses and I love it.  I am just starting to scratch the surface with all that you can do with this product to begin with.  I graduated just before computers started to be used in schools and became the norm for the generation after me.  I learned on an Apple but haven't been able to afford them since. I am good at learning as I go I am not afraid to press the a button and ask questions later to get to where I want to be so I do travel somewhat dangerously but for me that is how I discover the best things on an unknown device.  Push and read directions late is my motto.  Haven't ruined anything irreparably as yet.It is more enjoyable for me and I do understand the price range in comparison to my experiences it does seem fair.  I do think that the Mac offers a much cleaner, organized, classier, user friendly....etc. etc. version above the competition.  I had no idea that the things I can do on this even existed technologically so that should tell you I'm somewhat jaded from lack of my limited tech frontiers and how much things have really changed since 1984 when I graduated.

I will admit I was the main person saying how stupid it was for apple to come out with an ipad mini and I was wrong!

When I went to the apple store I looked at the ipad mini and ipad 4 and I didn't notice a severe difference between the retina screen and ipad mini screen. I love my mini it's so light weight and I put it in my purse and literally take it every where. I use to do the same with my ipad 2nd generation but it was very heavy. If you're looking to buy something that is portable light weight and to replace anything that you already have this is it. I'm a college student and I use my mini more than I use my laptop...I have my textbooks on it write papers read powerpoints listen to lectures and record my teachers in class on it. I also read books magazines and watch tv and movies on it as well as playing games and sketching. \"addicted to sims and cut the rope\". My roommate and I have figured out how to do so much on these ipads that we barely use a computer or paper anymore. I would highly recommend this ipad to anyone.

When I was growing up, there were few gadgets around to satisfy my gadget need; however, since I have reached my \"golden years\" there are gadgets galore.  My first electronic gadget I bought when was when I was in college - the second time.  A chemistry class was making my little ole numbers-handicapped brain spin.  Then along came the Texas Instruments calculator...WOW, it ran on batteries and figured out things for me.  I was in heaven and so began my love of electronic gadgets.  As a professional I had a plethora of electronic gadgets at my disposal (and I still did anesthesia with a calculator.)  The gadgets did get more complex, and expensive, as I got older and I do have a \"thing\" for laptop computers and have owned several...I prefer to surf in my lounge chair, with the computer in lap, my feet up, and a tv show in front of me as opposed to sitting at a desk, etc. Then I planned a trip to Europe this year.  I wanted to be able to communicate with the folks back home without having to tote my laptop, so what to do.  Well, BINGO...you got it.  I needed an iPad!  And where do I go to purchase all my best \"Good Gadgets\"???  To my laptop and Amazon of course!!!  Didn't take long before I located my sweet, little, cool, white, handy-dandy, baby who computes from my lounge chair and any place else with wi-fi...and she weighs much less than the laptop, even fits in my purse.  With Amazon in charge and freebie electronics actually providing the product for my purchase...WOW, what a deal.  Amazon's usually lightening fast, but I had my little, cool, shiny, new, white, baby in less than 2 days - all securely packed and ready to rumble.  And so we have continued to do sending messages/pictures home from Europe, playing games (which I never did before), and reading my fav magazines...SUCH A DEAL!  Give them a try!
