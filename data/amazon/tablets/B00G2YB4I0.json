Amazing product.  I have an ipad 4 and this in my house now.  The size and weight of this is terrific, though the comments about the brightness being less and the screen feeling a little cheaper rang true to me as well.I am also having the memory loss issue on the ipad air some have mentioned.  First, there is an ipad 4 in my household and it is also 16gb and, having passed it down to a family member, was very happy with it.  That said, the 16gb Ipad 4 has about 13.5 gb of usable space prior to loading anything, while the air somehow has 12.8.  Not really a big deal.  However, I have noticed my usable memory dropping dramatically (500 mb) on the air when doing streaming or using facetime.  I don't recall that happening on the ipad 4.  The memory does not recover afterwards, even after days and seems to continue to drop 100mb every other day even when I'm not using it.  It is not the apps or newspapers loading, as I pulled a lot of stuff off to check it.  I'm a light user of apps and don't store content, so 16gb was enough in my prior ipads, but on this one I'm getting worried. I was able to free the memory back up, but only after doing a full restore of the ipad as new and letting my cloud stuff stream back.  I really don't want to have to do full restores every few months.  For those interested, when connecting to itunes, it is the \"other\" category of memory that keeps expanding.  Tried calling Apple several times, but all they could offer was to do the restore.", "Title": "Nice, but some issues.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Author": "RUSH46", "ReviewID": "R3TO3MYT3N3189", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this specifically to download and use some speech therapy applications for my wife who had a stroke.

That's great. I'm a dual user. I love my PC products and Android and I love my mobile Apple products as well. I don't take sides or at least only when it concerns the best bang for the money at least. I've been using iPad's since I bought my mother her first one at release (she is disabled and iPad's (or tablets in general) are wonderful tools for those less than capable of using a keyboard and mouse. I also fell in love with it , the design was just amazing , the feel was great and the capability was very impressive when you consider at that time tablet's were barely around at the consumer level. Seeing the look on her face made it worth every single penny. Prior to getting the iPad she suffered a horrible infection and was hospitalized for 4 months fighting it , nearly losing her life in the process. She lost the capability to stand and only has use of her left hand now (with about 80 percent capability) and couple that with MS and you get someone who can't really use a mouse and keyboard setup easily.I wanted to state that before what I'm sure I will be accused of being a critical troll about the latest iPad version compared to a recent Android tablet I bought.Now onto the experience thus far with this new iPad , here is a list of what I like :1. LIGHT. Seriously , incredibly light. I can hold it in one hand very comfortably and its not meant to be held in such a way for the regular Joe ( I got big hamhocks for hands). I love it when technology trims up as it shows that its forward march is continuing without pause.2. FAST. Even over the iPad 4th generation this lean machine is even faster at multitasking which is good because it will help versus the recent Android tablet I bought which is a multitasking god.3. THIN BEZEL. If there is one complaint I have for the consumer electronics of the world in general its that we haven't done enough to remove overly large bezels from products. I hate them. I find they are a waste of real estate but I also realize that this is part of the technical limitation and the need for space for various reasons (board hardware , batteries and so on). The iPad Air's bezel is at least half of all previous iPad's. Very much appreciated Apple.Those are the biggest reasons to buy an iPad Air and they are really good ones in my mind. If you already own an iPad 4th gen though I don't think they are enough to justify the upgrade unless you really want the reduced weight (the iPad 4th gen is a pound and half while the iPad Air is only a pound flat).Now to the cons. And there are some that are very concerning and especially so if you tend to treat your products poorly (many people do..) :1. THIN PIECE OF GLASS. So while I realize that Gorilla Glass 3 is very impressive and amazing tough for its extremely thin profile .. I also feel its wildly out of place with a product like the iPad. People who buy iPad's and especially families tend to treat them pretty rough. I've seen children as young as 4 drop a 3rd gen iPad like a brick onto hardwood and it remained intact without a mark to bare. This new iPad Air has a very thin piece of GG3 that helps reduce the weight (and I would imagine the cost of manufacturing for Apple) but its recently been shown in several Youtube videos that when it comes to endurance its actually pretty fragile. Its very easy to crack it and especially so if it lands on its side. So while all the previous generation iPad's had a nice thick piece of glass to help protect the product this new one .. does not. It also sounds hollow when you tap it. And for some that drives them crazy. I don't mind this as I know its glass and not plastic like some \"claim\".2.COST. Since Apple did so much to slim down the cost of this new iPad and they used the EXACT same guts as the iPhone 5 (with a different layout and power profile) and yet they also trimmed down the battery size then how come this isn't any cheaper? The iPad mini is supposedly Apple's response to critics about the fact that its always the same price in each iteration. Apple , Android has fantastic alternatives now and the Google Play marketplace is becoming quite a fleshed out competitor , its time to start taking Android more seriously as a competitor and stop living inside your own eco bubble.3.SUB PAR HARDWARE VERSUS PRICE. Even with a new 64-bit chip (which isn't supported very well but that will change) the iPad is quite a puny product in terms of hardware specs. NOW BEFORE YOU FREAK OUT.. I know that Apple has optimized it heavily and that living in a very closed ecosystem (versus Android) gives it this advantage HOWEVER.. for what you are paying for you should be getting more. 1GB of RAM for instance? That's what I expect in a mid to low end smartphone these days. I can imagine those who complain (and have for a while now) about the random crashes because of running of memory would really love an extra 1GB of RAM for the iPad. I would also imagine it would do wonders for those who love to open programs by the truckload and not have to worry about random crashing errors due to running out of memory.Could you imagine a quad core A7 chip with 2 GB's of RAM? That beast would sing and you could do even more with an iPad that powerful. I would bet that when Apple moves towards 4k resolution that we will be getting those exact specs to run at that monster resolution but still I would have loved that right now.So my remarks about a recent Android tablet purchase.. I bought a Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and I just have to say its a real beast and outshines Apple's best in many ways. The resolution is higher (2500x1600) and it comes with the S-Pen and S-Pen software plus an office suite of apps. Now the Note Pro 12.2 is made for business applications the price of it versus 64GB iPad is about a hundred more. But for that hundred more you get massive hardware support , with an OTG USB cable you can connect external hard drives to it , you can also add memory through SDXC cards (up to 128GB's) and Samsung's Touch Wiz is getting quite mature and really offers a very set of apps. Not to mention the screen size of 12.2 inches versus 9.7. However the iPad beats it in terms of weight , the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 has a massive battery (but it lasts about 11 hours with heavy use) and the weight puts it into a class that speaks more towards laptop replacement that competitor to the iPad. However you can buy the non-pro versus for $100 less (you won't get the S-Pen) and still a get a monster solution.Android's tablet app market is getting better and better each week and there are plenty of apps that support landscape mode without issue. One thing I always thought Android did better was application scaling , something Apple could learn from frankly. The Galaxy Note 3 Pro in my mind is a Android finally getting its ducks in a row and Apple is going to have pick the pace to keep with Android's MASSIVE market share which is over double what Apple's is now.THAT BEING SAID.. I'm keeping the iPad Air. I love the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and its just a great tablet but I don't really have need of its business level features. But if I were going to recommend a tablet for a business minded individual I would recommend they go for it because it blows the iPad away for business use. The free office app it comes with is more fleshed out than MS Office for the iPad and the extra screen real estate is a big bonus for anyone attempting real work on it. But for a guy like me the iPad has an easier to consume profile and that's what I really love about it.If you intend to buy this product however (the iPad Air) I HIGHLY recommend you buy the Apple care warranty. You will be extremely glad you did with this powerful but more fragile new version of the iPad.", "Title": "The best tablet on the market when you consider the ecosystem and support.

For me the decision wasn't so much which to buy but rather which one I wanted. Originally I got the mini to replace my kindle touch because of the price and the pocketable size. Ultimately I ended up with the air. Here's why:Grip: despite the very comfortable dimensions for 1 handed holding of the mini the extra thin bezel proved problematic. The palm rejection tech is supposed to be quite good but I found it unreliable and for those times I wanted to gets.  Eventually I always wanted to get a hold of it with  the bezel between my thumb and forefinger but either ended up with a thumb right in the middle of whatever I was watching or a hand cramp.Real estate: getting smaller means text is smaller especially on we pages In portrait mode. You can set the text size up for dynamic type but it doesn't work everywhere and when if does work and you change to landscape, then the text is far too big for the screen. Furthermore, in games where part of the screen is used for the controls I ended up wishing for a larger screen.Keyboard: the keyboard ended up being the main reason I went for the Air. While it is surprisingly good on the mini (really it blew me away how good the keyboard was in the mini) typing at that size for any extended period is taxing and it just can't compete with the Air if you plan on writing any amount. Furthermore, using the GarageBand keyboards are fairly awkward on the smaller screen. Unlike the accessory keyboards for the full size iPads, I found the external keyboards for the mini were actually much much worse than the onscreen keyboard.Pocketability: the mini fit quite nicely into a jacket pocket, in the climate where I live jackets are only really feasible about 3 or 4 months out of the year. Other than that it needs bag of some sort, which is really the same situation I'd be in with an Air.Weight: this made the choice the hardest. Holding the iPad mini feels like hardly anything at all. The iPad air feels considerably heavier. That affects everything you do with the tablet and the entire interaction with it. Fortunately it's mostly a matter of perspective. Put down the mini for a day and all of a sudden the air seems  quite light.For me the decision was made for the larger version but what about options?Cellular of no cellular? The free 3G on my kindle touch has gotten me out of a scrape more than once and having access to a no-strings-attached internet connection is guaranteed to come in handy at least once during the lifetime of your tablet. $130 is a lot to spend though, especially if you have a smart phone and free tethering on your plan. Originally I went for the wifi version for precisely this reason. However, the ability to tether is dependent on the carrier you happen to be using. Should you switch phones, carriers or plans or simply lose the phone while traveling tethering May no longer be a option and it's never going to be as convenient as simply opening the settings on your iPad and activating a plan. In addition you also gain the ability to use gps with a cellular modem and gain the benefits of enhanced find my iPhone accuracy in the event that it's stolen and the thieves know enough to keep it off wifi. Finally though, the possibility of a free 200 mb per month with t-mobile and the ability to switch carriers at will ended up pushing me to get the cellular version.So, after having initially been interested by the mini, a lot  of research, even more indecision and having bought, lived with and sold multiple versions of this thing I can safely say that the iPad Air with cellular is the  version I'd pick. If you don't plan on typing a lot with it though or watching movies, go for the mini.", "Title": "Air or mini, cellular or wifi?

Others about the brightness...indeed I do have it cranked all the way up but the brightness is nowhere as bright as what is found on the Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition, nor the iPad4 and my most recent purchase the Samsung Note 8. All 3 when cranked all the way up are much brighter than the iPad Air.I will be buying the new Google nexus 7(even with all the GPS and multi-touch issues) for the upcoming holidays but even in the store, that too seems much brighter...I am very dismayed at this lack of brightness from the Air but it is still more than adequate for indoors. I have not tried it outdoors nor will I as this is not my \"outdoor\" tablet...lol.I like Apple and the tight integration of their apps and the reason many including myself continue to buy their products. I do feel the price for this latest iteration is them trying to make money at our expense. WHO HERE DOES NOT KNOW IN THEIR HEART THAT APPLE IS TRYING TO GET IN ON THE CHRISTMAS RUSH AND PUT THE AIR AND THE NEW MINI WITHOUT THE FINGERPRINT FEATURES FOUND ON THE NEW IPHONE...COME MARCH MAYBE APRIL, APPLE WILL UPDATE THE IPAD AIR TO INCLUDE THAT FEATURE.I will continue to buy Apple mostly because their store has apps that are better, with more choices and work extremely well with their devices. I think this product is a 3 1/2 Stars at best and mostly for the size and weight reduction that is very significant. I feel the \"glass\" is too thin but seems to be durable as I have really been typing a lot on it as well as playing several games that require a lot of tapping. I am very happy with the size reduction but feel the brightness is not up to par with other new tablets or the iPad4.Recently the Safari browser has been \"crashing\" a lot over the past week in that when you tap on a hyperlink, the browser will basically disappear off the screen. None of the tabs close but it just disappears and returns you to the home screens. I also am finding the browser will get stuck/freeze for several minutes before resuming. I have several calls in with apple support and they are looking into the issues.Other issues is the VIDEO app, if you play a video via streaming not downloading and leave it somewhere like the middle or so on, it actually reduces your available memory by the amount you have watched from what I can glean. IT IS LIKE DOWNLOADING THE MOVIE TO THE POINT YOU HAVE WATCHED IT TO EVEN THOUGH YOU SELECTED THE STREAMING LINK. If you do this with several movies, you can basically wipe out your free memory. I find it difficult to clear the buffer and have basically learned to tell the app not to display any movies then to display movies then play the movie but move the slider to the beginning and press stop playing then done. Of these many steps I eventually clear the buffer but I am not sure which of all these steps actually is what does it if any!Oh lastly, the WI-fi is fantastic.FINAL RATING IS 3 1/2 STARS...MAYBE 4 IF NOT FOR THE BRIGHTNESS ISSUE.First I own iPad 2 and 4 and Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition.I like...not love...the new iPad Air as it is faster both in operating the software apps and graphic intensive apps. The apps continue to be fantastic for all the pads not just the Air.Apple did a great job on the weight but FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE NEW SCREEN IS NOT NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS MY iPad 4 NOR DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE GLASS.As I type this review on the Air, the \"cheap tapping\" feel of this glass leaves me wondering how durable this glass is. It feels thin and makes a tapping sound not found on the more solid glass on my other two iPads.Oh I am keeping the Air for the faster processors but feel Apple has put out a product whose screen will not be as durable as prior pads.I can see it flex when I push down on it with minimal effort and have some light distortion when I press down like old type LED TVS.Apple over prices their products because they can and really did so on this iteration of their iPad. In my estimation the glass feels like plastic and the brightness is much diminished when compared to my iPad 4 and so must have a higher profit margin with all these cost cutting that resulted in a new iPad that for all practically purposes is just faster but not as solidly built as prior pads.Time will tell on the screen and maybe this is the way all tablets are headed to achieve the weight reduction and thinness. I love the ability to hold the Air in one hand comfortably for much longer than any of my current tablets. I am OK to sacrifice the glass quality as long as the touch screen does not suffer or long term screen reliability.I wish Apple would splurge and include a 6 foot charging cord...OMG $600 for 32GB and the cord is so short still after all this time...lol.", "Title": "light, fast and easy to hold but...", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "Zhiyi Li", "ReviewID": "R2SP6AKRCXBNXT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got the item 8 days later after I ordered it, fair enough.

First, try to buy the product through Amazon.  If you get lucky you will avoid 38+ dollars in taxes.  In my state I get charged that anyway.  I bought mine a few weeks ago and I now regret my decision.The ipad Air, full size not the mini, is expensive for what you get.  The much talked about retina display really isn\u2019t much better than Apple\u2019s or Samsung\u2019s normal display.  I take a lot of photos and even at full zoom I can\u2019t make out much difference.  The Apple ipad Air does NOT come with an SD card slot, and if you want to upgrade from 16gb to 32gb you will be looking at over $100 additional dollars.  Many of Apple\u2019s competitors have the SD slot and cost less.Apple sells an SD card \u201creader.\u201d  You can download from the card to the ipad but NOT the other way.  And the ipad SD card reader will run you $30 plus dollars.  You must buy other $30+ dollar accessories if you want to use a USB memory stick for example.  I purchased a non- Apple SD card triple reader (USB and SD for example) for about $9 dollars.  The machine complains at me but it still works (but, once again, it only loads to the machine not from the ipad as a normal SD slot does).An SD card reader would have been easy to install as part of the iPad, and this gives their competitors an edge, especially when one is taking photographs and trying to download them immediately to examine on something other than a 2 inch screen.  As I shoot RAW (large files) photos with my Canon this inability to use an SD card is a real pain.Downloading music from Amazon to iTunes isn\u2019t any picnic either.  My wife has an android device from Dell running Jellybean and she downloads everything with zero problems.  Plus, she has an SD card slot which really helps.  Her screen is as sharp as mine.Finally, the OS systems.  Jellybean has about a million apps written for it while I have about 200 - or that is how it seems to me.  Her system is faster than mine AND her system is intuitive and mine is not.  I\u2019ve had to read over the Apple manual for ipad three times trying to get things done.  Maybe my largest gripe is I bought the Apple thinking several Apple machines could sync up and trade information easily including photographs and music and documents.  Wrong.  I\u2019ve tried numerous syncing ideas and none of them work.  I started using Pages (an Apple word processing program) instead to Word to get it to transfer.  Finally, I saved it to the cloud and managed to get the document to the other machine.  Photographs that are in the photo stream do transfer; however, getting the photograph into the stream when it was not automatically placed there by the ipad doesn\u2019t work.  And finding photos to look at in the ipad, when the ipad did not take the photo and the photo is on another machine (with the photo stream on and home sharing on) the photo still does not come up.  Very frustrating.After using the ipad and watching and using Jellybean and Android in action I think the Android devices are a much better deal.  Get one with an SD card slot.  I am certain Apple has designed their machine so the user cannot get extra storage on the machine (as an SD slot would allow) and must buy a more expensive machine if they handle large files.  If you like buying music at Amazon good luck getting it to iTunes onto your machine if it is an Apple (Yes, I have Amazon cloud player).  My wife got her music downloaded in about a minute.  It took me an hour to get one of Mozart\u2019s songs I had purchased downloaded to my computer.In retrospect, since the programs do NOT sync up as advertised, the machine has little storage unless you pay an enormous additional price, the retina display is not revolutionary, and the number of programs are minimal compared to Android I wish I had purchased an Android.  Samsung seems to be on the cutting edge there, although my wife\u2019s Dell is performing just fine.", "Title": "Poor Product", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Author": "Oscar Crumby", "ReviewID": "R1LFVGKI48DRB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a tablet.

Those reviews are biased and only bring up the minor upgrades from the old ipad and base the comparisons off of those few things. And the only two really bad things they had to say about the ipad Air was that it didn't have a fingerprint scanner and it didn't come in gold. The 80's called and they want their gaudy flashy gold bling back.Most of these reviews will only focus on those points and will not mention all the other advantages the Surface 2 has. And for the few reviews that do mention the other features the Surface 2 has, they still favor the ipad because the camera was nicer or more apps. Really?I will use the Surface 2 as comparison because it will show how ridiculous the bias is regardless of capabilities.What the reviews usually leave out or down play.Surface 21. Full office software. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote.2. Wide screen optimized for wide screen movies. When held in portrait when you are surfing the web for example, you get a a longer list so you don't scroll as much.3. Sd slot. Easy to download or upload data on the fly.4. 3.0 USB so you can easily backup files to a hard drive and not have all your eggs in one basket. Or transfer files with anything that has a USB plug and also charge your phone. Ipad? No, unless you have the adapter and you can't charge your phone.5. Can print to almost every printer.6. Hdmi port7. Flash support so you are not limited browsing the web.8. Built in two position kickstand.9. Thin keyboards that double as covers. Can get them background lit, flat, with real keys, and a new one coming out with built in battery to recharge your Surface at the same time on a charge. Battery in tablet is good already though. Some say that you need to buy a keyboard to make full use of the Surface and adds to the cost. Ridiculous. You do not. It will make life more easier though if you are working on a spreadsheet or word document. With an ipad you don't need one because what use would it be for? Sure there are apps. but they are limited to what you can create or edit. You have to do major creating and editing on a computer first and then hook up the ipad and transfer it.10. Hook up to your t.v. or another monitor and drag an open window to the second screen.11. Do a split screen on the tablet.12. Run multiple tasks at the same time in the background like listening to music, watching a video and doing something else like typing an email or working on an a office document in split screen mode.13. Wirelessly sync with your xbox and play games on your t.v, stream videos, pictures, etc.14. Drag and drop files.15. Can set up individual separate accounts on the tablet and have parental monitoring updates and deciding what child can do on the tablet.Now these are not all the Surface 2 offers. I am finding new things still.The ipad Air is basically the same ipad as before with minor tweaks. It's faster and lighter. Still does the same thing as before, nothing new.ipad Air1. Powerful processor. For doing nothing new. Future fingerprint scanner? Tablet will still only run apps. as before.2. Lighter and thinner is negated by the cases to protect the ipad and without a keyboard.3. Upgraded camera. Put it down, your annoying the people behind your trying to see the wedding or play. Use a real camera.4. No USB or sd slot. Need adapters for just about everything. And with the Surface 2 you can plug the unit in when it is dead and keep on using it and still do things via the sd card or usb cables. On an ipad you can't do both. You either charge it or plug in an adapter to the only port the ipad has do to something. And if it is dead, you have to wait until you charge it first. Also you need to bring all the adapters and keyboard with you vs the Surface 2 of which all you need is the power cable. And the cover/keyboard is so thin it is negligible in bulk and weight. And justifying that the ipad has third party keyboards is not valid. It is a separate bulky keyboard and the ipad does not support mouse functions. You are stuck with third party hardware that is Apple specific whereas with the Surface you can use anything that supports micro SD or USB. And having to buy all these accessories tofor the ipad.will not be cheap. People gripe about the Suface cover/keyboard costs too much. Well to buy a seperate cover for an ipad will cost $40.00 and it will flop around and a non intergrated keypad will cost $100.00 that you have to carry seperatley.5. Having to convert simple files with Apple software a hassle.5. Tons of apps. Android not far behind. And Microsoft growing. How much apps. does one need?6. What good is the Reina display if it isn't widescreen? Picture is actually smaller than 9.7 with the black bars.7. Only compatible with Apple products i.e. cant print unless it is an AirPrint printer or stream to t.v. unless Apple t.v.8. Slightly upgraded camera. Put it away! Your blocking my view! And people with a 4.8 inch phone look ridiculous? At least they are not carrying around the perfect sized iphone for one handed operation along with a 9.6 tablet that takes two hands. Kind of contradicting.The ipad Air has more negatives than positives, so how can it be better? Android tablets have more features even than the ipads. I guess if you want one just for games and apps, then an ipad or a higher end Android tablet might suit your needs. People are not weighing in that the Surface 2 can do more than just play games.Now back to the Surface 2. There was a slight learning curve to understand what all the gestures do. It didn't take long though. Look it up on youtube and you will pick it up real quick along with a lot of tips and tricks of what it is capable of. There different ways to open, close, move, split screen, multitask, etc.The tablet feels a little heavy in the hand if you had to hold it I admit. But the two position kickstand works pretty good on the lap as I didn't think it would. I don't have to have a cover to add to the bulk to double as a kickstand also. And even if I put on one of the super thin keyboards they would add very little weight or bulk and they snap on and off without any hassle.The boot up time takes a little while when completely off, but remember it is opening real office programs. When in sleep mode it opens up quickly.I went several days at a time of casual use and in sleep mode without charging and it still had a charge.The tiles are nice because it is real time data so I can glance at them without opening up an app. for email, weather, etc. On Apple you have a bunch of icons and you have open it up, Android you can use widgets.With a real browser and Flash I can use full websites rather than a mobile version. And also it is a lot easier to open multiple tabs when surfing the internet unlike some tablets where it is a pain to pop back and forth between tabs.As I mentioned above it is nice to have the split screen because my kids can research on the web on one side and write their paper on the other side while listening to music of which they shouldn't be.The only two cons I find on the Surface 2 so far is that the power cord is only about 58 inches long. You have to be really close to an outlet of some sort.And the main con was that the software and backup takes up about 16 gigs so you don't have the full gigs of memory stated. So might have to get an sd card. Yes other tablets you only lose about 2 gigs, but remember they are pretty much entertainment tablets only and can't do what the Surface 2 can do.If you are waiting for a ipad Air Pro to come out. Don't be surprised if it doesn't come with a Retina display, finger print scanner, nice camera, etc. You will have to wait for the Pro S, Pro S1, etc. to get one feature at a time and not several at once. I mean come on, cant even throw in a simple camera flash. The ipads shouldn't even be placed in the categories of tablets that can run Office software. There should be a category for Dumb Tablets that only run apps, a category for Smart Tablets for those that can run fully functioning office software and not just limited mobile versions, and Extreme Tablets for ones that can run full blown Office suites.If your a die hard Apple fan, please back up your arguments with something valid other than ipad rocks or a childish angry comment. Because if you do, it will prove my point.", "Title": "So revolutionary they can't even throw in a camera flash.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Author": "G.

First of all, it took over six hours just to set up the iPad Air, because it wouldn't receive the information that was being inputed. Very frustrating. After three calls to Apple tech support, we finally got the set up finished and were able to use the unit. Next, we were told that the SIM card from our cellular data provider would work with the iPad Air. It did not. So, my only option was to pay AT&T; or any of the other three providers $50 per month for cellular. That's a rip off. It's no coincidence that all four of the cellular providers available for the iPad Air charge virtually the same high price for coverage. So, the IPad Air is very pricey for a tablet, it's very time consuming to set up, the cellular coverage is very expensive. So, we returned it and got our money back. That was the best decision I made in regards to the Apple iPad Air.", "Title": "Don't Waste Your Money!!!", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "Don from VA", "ReviewID": "R3UR5Z6N0MZDOZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife.

I will review it later.  I rated this model 3-stars simply based on their past history with other iPads (we have an earlier version and we are extremely pleased with it).  If the iPad Air is anything like their other iPads it will be a hit with us and it get a higher rating than 3-stars.", "Title": "Ordered the wrong one", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Author": "Philip Walter Bonsell", "ReviewID": "RXBWTZZSD232R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hello.I just got one of these tablets from Apple. I assumed I'd like their products as I had a high opinion of them as a company. Most of these reviews are full of how great they are and tech data. I'm 52, I'm not dumb, I can work a PC, I've got a BMW, a Bang and Olufsen system, a couple of homes and the rest.Well it's an education; we're all used to be expected to work stuff right out of the box, but if you're an apple novice, if you don't have a smart 'phone (I know that's putting me in a minority but why would I need one when I've been out the workplace for ten years?), if you still use CD's for music and DVD's / blu ray for films, well take my advice and don't bother. A nightmare to set up, impossible to put right if you get it wrong; mines back in the box three hours after delivery and there it will stay. I'll put up with windows instead.For all you guys who want to do loads of stuff, well good luck to you. I just wanted Amazon, Google search and my mail live on a screen next to my seat in the living room and was prepared to spend $500 to have that in a nice package. It didn't deliver, and no I don't want to have to go around to my local Apple store and ask some guy pursuing an alterative lifestyle how to do it. Much easier to make do with the $150 Acer notebook, even if it does need to be on a mains lead most of the time.Farewell Apple; if it had worked I'd have bought a pricey Mac, but that ship's sailed and I'm $2000 ahead.Phil", "Title": "Don't assume you'll like an ipad", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Author": "Sandra E.
