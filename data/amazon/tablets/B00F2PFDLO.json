Following the user manual, I bought a micro-hdmi to hdmi cable but the connection did not work.  My son suggested that I order a \"mini-hdmi to hdmi\" cable which I did, and it worked.  I wonder why the need for this kind of cable (mini-hdmi to regular hdmi) is not mentioned in the user manual.  It would satisfy the customer more if this cable is delivered along with the tablet.  With a wide screen and audible volume, I have proven that the tablet is good for streaming movies from Netflix, Amazon Instant Video & Hulu Plus, checking e-mails from my Yahoo & G-Mail.accounts, and playing music collections with the use of micro-sd memory cards.  These are the only functions that I have tried.  I am slowly trying the other aspects, like adding and removing apps, storing and removing data, etc., more comments to follow.

It is better than expected for the price.  However, after only one month, it is now starting to lock up.  First time, it did so when I was reading a pdf file.  I've only downloaded a few apps.  I also locks up at the login screen.  Might have to do with it updating every time I start up and it asks if I want to close the program or wait for it to respond.  The other day, I started the unit up and walked away for a few moments.  When I came back it was dead.  Couldn't bring it back to life until I depressed the reset button just above the mic.I've worked professionally on Kindle tablets (all models) and now on one model of the Verizon tablet.  And I see the same issues that I'm having  So, I'm still ruling out a mere software issue.  I know code can still be sloppy on all these free apps out there.  So that's where I'm troubleshooting for now.  But, it does leave the thought in my mind that it might just be cheap hardware.  (You get what you pay for, is the saying).As soon as I figure it out.......more to follow.CheersUpdate to Review:  Now 5/28/2014.  Love this tablet.  Turns out that the issues that I was having were entirely software related and due to how many apps were updating on boot.  After resetting to defaults and carefully choosing apps I wanted, now no problems.  Soooo, it was something I did to hose the operating system in the first place.  We also bought another Noria for our daughter.  Both now going strong.
