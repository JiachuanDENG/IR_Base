{"Reviews": [{"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1AVF6VFAVF5T4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a former 1st gen iPad user that was in the market for an update.  I chose to move away from the iPad because I found that I'm a fairly basic tablet user that walked away from the itunes network a few years ago.For music I had transitioned over to Spotify & SiriusXM.  For movies, Netflix & Amazon Prime.  For reading, Kindle app, but with the iPad I was not able to fully utilize the Prime membership advantages.Further, my iPad was quickly becoming obsolete because Apple didn't allow for it to download the latest iOS updates so within 2 years of ownership some of my iPad apps were constantly slow and/or crashing.  This was the straw...After shopping around for approximately 30 days I ended up purchasing 2 tablets for my household of 4 - the 2nd gen Nexus 7 32gb and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" 32gb.  (By the way, I picked up two 32gb tablets for about the same price of one 32gb iPad mini with retinal display)Pros of Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\": Size, weight, display (unbelievable), sound (those little speakers work really well, including virtual surround!), and the speed on Amazon Network.  Being an Amazon Prime member, this machine is really, really slick.  From the home screen you can easily shop, access games, apps, books, music, videos, etc., etc., etc..  This is combined with their carousel feature of recently accessed programs, books, etc..  I have to add that pulling up a video from Amazon was lightening fast.  This can't be said for the Netflix app.Which leads me to the Cons of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\": This tablet crashes - without warning - but I've only experienced the crashing when using apps outside of the Amazon ecosystem.  But when the Netflix app crashed on me yesterday it required me uninstalling the Netflix app, restarting, then adding the app back for it to work again.  Also, streaming music via bluetooth, which is all I do anymore (Spotify is a truly fantastic service that gets better everyday), can be tricky.  The bluetooth pairing struggled a bit the first time I tried it, but has since locked on seamlessly.  However, the Spotify app is a very stripped-down version compared to Apple's and Google's.  So much so that it is missing some pretty significant components that I will truly miss.  Further, last night after I paired it with my stereo system and launched a song on Spotify, it crashed.  When streaming SiriusXM at times there are gaps in the songs where the streaming fails a bit.  Maybe a system update will correct a lot of this (fingers crossed)?I understand that they are different machines in many ways, but comparing the Pros of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" to the Nexus 7 - the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" wins.  The Nexus 7 can't compete with the specs, particularly if you are a Prime member.  As a Prime member, I really get a kick out of the extras I get by also owning a Kindle.  The book lending alone is a truly fantastic perk.  Also, the display and sound on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" are truly remarkable especially when you consider that the device weighs so little!However, if you're looking for an all around tablet that will work both within and outside of the Amazon ecosystem (Spotify, SiriusXM, Kindle, and Netflix apps specifically), I'm sorry, but the Nexus wins.  I have yet to have an issue with crashing.  Pairing to bluetooth - no issues.  Streaming music and movies on the apps mentioned - no issues.  And by the way, I'll stream music for entire days without an issue.To top it off, rumor has it that Nexus is planning a Nexus 8 launch before the end of the year (the \"8\" referring to an 8\" size).So, needless to say, I will be weighing the pros and cons of trading in my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" for a Nexus 8 if that day comes.  iPad, however, will not be considered.UPDATE: Amazon let me return my HDX for a new one and the crashes have ceased.  Also, Spotify has been updated (finally), but the bluetooth streaming still struggles.  That being said, I love my HDX and have changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars.

Siepel", "ReviewID": "RZNMRJUKQ48P7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've waited a long time to purchase this tablet, waiting for one with both front and rear facing cameras and trying to save up enough Amazon points so that I could afford it. Finally, this December my hubby and I ordered one as my Christmas gift. Christmas day I pulled it out of the box and everything worked perfectly. However, early January I went to turn on my new Kindle in the morning and nothing. Dead. I followed the suggestions given on the Amazon website, but to no avail. Called customer service, and they end up sending me a new Kindle. I was truly bummed that my new device was faulty, but Amazon's customer service was excellent!So, after playing with my second Kindle and reading other reviews, here are my thoughts on this device.1. I love most everything about this Kindle, the light weight, the features, etc. Things that drive me a little crazy include the fact that the power and volume buttons are on the back.  It is awkward to feel around for the volume button while you are watching a video or whatever.2. Mayday is helpful but a little creepy. So, I was trying to figure out how to open Word documents that were sent as attachments via email. I had purchased the OfficeSuite Professional App and had no problems opening documents sent via Yahoo mail, but couldn't figure out how to use it for Gmail. I pushed the Mayday button and right away had a customer service rep online. He walked me through the issue. At first I thought \"This tech is so cool. He can see/control everything on my Kindle,\" followed by, \"Oh, that is kind of creepy.\" Not that this is any different then was Dell or any other computer customer service can do with your permission on your computer, it just struck me a little weird. BTW, contrary to other reviews, you can open email attachments on this Kindle from both Yahoo and Google mail servers.3. I love the video quality when watching something on this device, but not sure why they did not include an HDMI outlet so that you could watch on other devices, like your TV.4. Having Amazon Prime is definitely worth it, you just need to be aware of its limits. We have had Amazon Prime for years and use at least one of its features almost daily, whether it is free shipping, the free movies/TV, or checking out a free book from the Kindle collection. Amazon's new feature lets you download some (that should be capital SOME) Primes movies and TV programs.5. I have yet to find a cover/case that I really love for this device. I have the Amazon Origami case and the MarBlue Ultra Lightweight Origin Case for Kindle Fire. Neither have all the features I am looking for, like really good protection. If you have any suggestions I would like to hear them.6. I will probably continue to read books mostly on my Kindle keyboard e-reader. I work on a computer during the day. When I go to read at night I find the back-lit screens really bother my eyes. I have read on this Kindle just fine, but I prefer the size and screen of my Kindle e-reader for long stretches of reading.7. I would recommend setting up some parent controls, even if you are the only one using your Kindle. Once you turn on the controls you can go into the settings and choose the controls you want to use. For example, I want my Kindle to ask for a password before a purchase is made or a video is watched, just in case I accidentally hit a button or my kids happen to be using it.8 If for any reason you have to return your Kindle, I was  told by a customer service rep to deactivate the Kindle from your account for security reasons, even though the first thing Amazon does it delete all information on returned Kindles.9. I wish there was a charging indicator light. You plug the thing in and there is no way of knowing if it is charging or is fully charged.", "Title": "Love it, even though I already had to return one for a replacement.

High resolution, fast and compatible with most of the apps on our cloud. We love it. We love having our books, movies (prime), music, games and apps all on the cloud. All accessible to our devices and smart phones.EmotionWe love it. By \"we\" I mean me, my wife and our 5 year old daughter, who has been using it since she was 3. She would have been using it earlier but we didn't have one.ConstructionIt is very thin, very fast and elegant. More-so than the HD version. The original Fire, which is highly functional, seems very primitive by comparison. Now one of our original Fire's broke. Amazon was kind enough to give us $75 credit on it. For this we are very grateful.FunctionalityMy wife is a Database developer and has resources that help her with her job.I am a musician. I have wonderful books, a 4 track mixer, can write notes, take video notes... browse the web, run apps, games, movies. it is beyond my wildest dreams and I am very impressed. At this stage in my life it takes a lot to impress me, but this has a lot.My daughter has tons of games (minecraft, reading apps, etc) that she adores. The worst thing is we have strive to limit her. Now the kindle will do that for us, but we still reserve the right to do that. She's very careful with her \"Piggy\" as she calls it. This is based on an early application (2 years back) that featured a \"Piggy\". Well, she loves it. We all call our kindles \"Piggies\" because of this.LongevityI don't know how it will hold up. I pray it will last years. I can see using it for years if it does. I can't imagine what Amazon's engineers will come up with in the coming years. It's yet another reason to fight to stay alive. I am amazed by technology. I rank this right up there with innovations such as the Kemper and almost the cell phone. It's just amazing and a game changer. IMHO, easily the leader in it's field.Tech SupportAmazon's tech support is top notch and second to none. They make a mistake they'll break their backs to fix it. If carriers make a mistake they do their best to make it right and then some. They don't have to, but this reinforces good-will and makes us come back to them time and time again. We love amazon. This product is tied to amazon and their success and quality shines through in this product. They deserve all of their success.Originality and other tabletsThere are many tablets on the market. The key competitor is the iPad and the two are very comparable. The iPad's keys to success are it's larger screen and it's elegant programs. It's weakness is it's cloud is too proprietary compared to the Kindle. I have two iTouches and like the elegant, well designed programs, but dislike iTunes. The Kindle beats the iPad in every other department. The Kindle HDX is less expensive, the programs are usually on par or close to Apple, and the resolution is actually higher on the HDX. The HDX also boast a faster quad core processor. This might be negated by the higher resolution of the Kindle but the difference is negligible.VerdictBoth. I would be happy with an iPad and a Kindle. If I had to choose one it would be the Kindle. Amazon has found a way to worm themselves into our lives and our hearts. Their relatively low priced kindle, great shipping, excellent selection of everything has done it. They are part of our culture with south park making episodes based on UPS/Amazon deliveries and so forth. It's a huge deal and probably the beginning of something larger than we can imagine. The only thing is, as Amazon grows, will it maintain it's integrity to itself and it's customers -- not sell out to corporate and powerful investors.", "Title": "The laptop of the future is here.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Author": "Johnny Kenehan \"Johnny Kenehan\"", "ReviewID": "R2KYT5ZTNXB0WX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Kindle for my wife for Christmas; ordered it the 23rd and had it the 24th!  The unit is just unbelievably thin and sleek and it was fully charged out of the box.  It is an amazing unit, fast response, fantastic screen and then there is the live help.We had some problem getting the smtp settings right, just wouldn't work.  This is certainly not Amazon's issue, but an issue with finding the right settings for my internet provider.  In desperation, I thought I'd try the live help but I didn't hold out much hope, it was just before midnight on CHRISTMAS DAY!  After LESS THAN FIVE SECONDS after pushing the button, Deborah popped up in a little window and asked me how she could help.  I immediately looked to see if I had pants on ... but she said only I could see her!She was GREAT.  Took us about 10 minutes and I was up.  It was so cool seeing her draw on my screen and point to the needed settings.  I just could not believe the customer attention I got.  Damn, if I could give 10 stars I would!!!!  Amazon, you've really done it this time.  Even had the Kindle been less than stellar, I wouldn't have minded knowing my wife or I will always have the help we need.  BTW, YouTube videos played immediately and just as expected.

If you want the tech specs, you can read them on the page for the tablet. So I won't repeat them here. I have and have had a number of tablets including the iPad AIR, iPad 3rd gen, iPad 7\", Nexus 7, Nexus 7 2nd gen, Galaxy Note, Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy Note 8, and an Asus 10\" (I don't remember the model). So I am very familiar with the different models and operating systems.I had a Kindle Fire Hd 7\" that I sold because I didn't like the carousel, and getting to apps that I wanted to used wasn't convenient. The color, resolution, and sound were fine for my purposes to watch Amazon movies and to uses some apps, but it was cumbersome as compared to other android tablets that I had. Apps couldn't be grouped or organized as they could be on other tablets, and every app used was added to the carousel making the carousel lengthy and virtually useless.I decided to give the Kindle Fire HDX a try in hopes that some of the disappointments I experienced with the Fire HD were resolved. I have had the Kindle Fire HDX only a couple of days, but so far, I am impressed with the improvements. It still has the carousel, that can be useless if you use a number of apps or new apps are added - all are added to the carousel. Those that you don't use often have to be remove, one-by-one, manually. It would be nice if adding apps to the carousel was an option so that only most used apps could be added. (Hint to Amazon).On the plus side, you can now view all of your installed apps and execute them by swiping up in the screen. You can also group your apps into collections, or folders, and name the folders. In addition, apps in the apps view can be arranged in a way that makes sense to you by dragging and dropping them into position. In this matter, the Kindle Fire HDX function much more like other android tablets and is a huge improvement over previous versions of the Kindle Fire. This versions offers much more user control for organization and usage of the tablet.A couple other improvements that are obvious to me are the resolution and the crisp true colors. The colors on the screen really do \"pop\". In comparison to other tablets that I have, the touch response is extremely good, and the accuracy of the on-screen keyboard has been flawless. In addition, moving from the carousel to the apps screen and going from one app to another has been very smooth. There is no lag at all.I did have an opportunity access Mayday, that is reached by clicking the \"?\" icon. I used this at 3am, and go almost an immediate response. The representative was very helpful and answered all of my questions. I did find out that many of the Google apps are not compatible with the Kindle Fire HDX because developers have not made them compatible. They hope that this will change with future updates to the OS. In my experience, developers of apps have most developed the iPad apps and then the Google apps. The Google apps never seem to be quite as good as the iPad apps. Now that Amazon has developed  a very capable tablet, maybe developers will start to create more apps that are compatible. This is yet to be seen. In the meantime, users of the Kindle tablets are pretty much limited to apps available on Amazon other than a few Google apps that may be compatible.At this point, I would recommend the Kindle Fire HDX tor android flexibility, the improved display, and for use with Amazon Prime deals. I will update this review as I get more experience with the features of this device.", "Title": "A great improvement over the Kindle Fire HD", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Author": "Steward H.", "ReviewID": "R144K5Y0T0A88P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While being very satisfied with our Kindle Fire HD 8.9, we were pleased to upgrade to the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 when Amazon offered the four payment plan. We purchased both of our Kindle Fire 8.9's with 32 GM of memory, without the special offers feature.We want to emphasize that the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is a very fine tablet, and if you do not have the extra funds to purchase the HDX 8.9, you should purchase the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 while they are still available from Amazon for $229. The two are very close in the quality of still and video graphics. At this price, they are an incredible bargain.Nevertheless, we were very pleased (amazed might be a better term) by the new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. In the following commentary, keep in mind we are comparing the HDX to the HD 8.9.The new HDX 8.9 is noticeably lighter to hold, yet retains the solid build quality of the original 8.9. As far as still graphics are concerned, the colors are more vivid, contrast is even higher, blacks appear even blacker. In short, the display is amazingly impressive!  Comparing the two tablets side by side, it is as if the original image is being viewed through a very slight polarizing filter on the original HD 8.9.As far as viewing Video content, we noticed very little difference between the two tablets, with the original KF HD 8.9 perhaps having a slight edge. Both are excellent, movie picture quality varies widely. If you are a Prime member, try The Robe, or Contact if you want to see just how good the video quality truly is. The soundtrack on Contact showcases the sound quality possible with these tablets.The rear/back facing camera is fun to use, color is quite accurate. The camera is effective in relatively low light situations with low \"noise\". If high picture quality is required, we would recommend using your digital camera.The sound quality seems to be slightly better on the new model, which might be due to the altered position of the dual speakers. If you are watching a movie, you will definitely want to use high quality lightweight headphones. With these, the sound quality is very impressive.The New Silk browser is greatly improved.  Internet browsing is significantly faster with snappy response.Battery life is significantly improved, we noticed at least a 20% increase in useable battery life.Overall, the new Kindle FIre HDX 8.9 has managed to improve an already excellent screen image,  provide slightly better sound, added a useful rear/back facing camera, while being significantly lighter in weight.There really isn't anything we would describe as being negative with this tablet. Some icons, apps, and text appear slightly smaller in size because of the increased screen resolution, and one of our apps did not run properly on the new Kindle fire. If a reset is required, one must now depress the power button for a full 20 seconds, release, and repress the button to allow the kindle to reset. We only experienced one lockup requiring a reset, which we are sure was software related.If Amazon is still offering the four payment plan, there is no better time to purchase or upgrade. If not, we still are impressed enough to spend the full $444 for the 32G KF HDX 8.9, without special offers. (If you opt for 16GB and special offers, the price is less).

However, I had seen some of the reviews referring to how light the HDX was and my husband was like, well my little tech junky would you like that for Christmas. I of course did some research on the forums and said yes.  Now, one caveat, if you get frustrated with not being able to get a specific app you really want, be sure to go to the forums, I have not yet found an app that I couldn't get one way or another so I'm very happy with this light little unit.

The Kindle Fire HDX could possibly be my favorite of the three (although they are all excellent devices).1) LOVE the form factor.  It's unbelievably light and makes the iPad Air, which I was previously amazed by, feel chunky in comparison.2) Fast processor and zippy graphics.  No lag in the user interface.  Everything loads up instantaneously and even graphically demanding games like Riptide GP run as smooth as butter.3) Great Amazon interface that gives me access to my Amazon Prime videos and video library (which I do not get on my Nexus).  I own many movies and TV shows in my Amazon library and it is nice to have access to these, as well as the dozens of Kindle books I own.4) Kid friendly options like Kindle free time offer tons of content for parents to let their kids enjoy.5) Mayday option is pretty cool.  I tried it out twice when I had some general questions about Kindle Fire OS and the representatives were friendly and helpful.  I never had to wait more than 10 seconds for a representative to appear.Here is how I would compare the devices:vs iPad AirI can do anything on my iPad Air that I can do on my Kindle Fire HDX, plus I have access to all of my Apple content.  The app environment is MUCH richer for the iPad then it is for the Kindle Fire HDX as there are many more apps and especially many more tablet optimized apps.Having said that the Kindle Fire is significantly cheaper and is also lighter, and Amazon pretty much has everything you need in terms of Apps, books, and media content.  So I would say that the Kindle Fire HDX is a poor man's iPad Air that is almost as good and would satisfy the great majority of consumers.  I also prefer the slightly smaller form factor and lighter weight of the Fire HDX.vs Nexus 7The Nexus 7 has a better app environment through Google play.  However, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 has access to the video content from Amazon Prime and a bigger screen, more storage, and more powerful graphics and CPU.  I honestly like the HDX 8.9 better and would choose this between the two if I could only have one.  The Nexus 7 is still a great tablet though, especially for the price.

Your Kindle books (many free ones), your Android apps through Amazon app shop, Prime Instant Video streaming (ironically available on iOS but not Android).

My only criticism is that setting up the device can be a little confusing and at times frustratingly challenging, even for a seasoned computer user like myself. But I guess that is due to its Linux based Android operating systems, the inner workings of which only a seasoned Linux user would find anything less than esoteric.

However, I have had some hiccups with service quality worth noting.The big issue is that the device would not download anything a couple of days ago, with everything just hanging in the queue. I hit the Mayday button, and someone eventually called me back. This was the second time I used Mayday, and the second time I was shifted over to someone else on a different platform. So, to be clear: Mayday is not a tech support service, but what you use when you can't figure out how to crop an image or something else simple. Considering the considerable amount of promotion around instant customer service via Mayday, this is a massive limitation and is the reason for one of the missing stars in this review.I received a phone call from an Amazon rep immediately after getting off the line with the Mayday rep, and this phone interaction lasted more than an hour. He made an earnest effort to help, but it actually made the problem worse. See the attached video - which I made for an earlier and considerably different draft of this review - to see what happened. I actually lost access to my book library. I eventually fixed this myself, by resetting to factory default. But, this then required more than an hour of re-customizing my device.On top of this, five graphic novels I purchased for the Kindle are only downloading in low-resolution files, making them look outright blurry. This appears to be a software issue, since a service rep was able to download higher res files to his device. It is automatically pushing these five - and just these five - titles to my device in inferior quality. I did both a Mayday call and an e-mail about this about two weeks ago, with no resolution, and no follow-up until yesterday.A very friendly customer service rep called me last night and took notes on both the major problem that led to the reset, and the graphic novel issue. He is still researching the latter.I hope that these are temporary issues that are just coming with a new launch and that I will be able to add another star to this review soon. However, until I can get content I paid for at a reasonable quality and go a few more weeks without having to reset my device (note: I never had to reset my original model Kindle Fire in two years of ownership), I am hesitant to enthusiastically recommend this, despite the awesome hardware.Note: This review is almost completely rewritten from the original post, reflecting some responses from Amazon.", "Title": "Amazing tech, but deserves some hesitancy", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Author": "Chow", "ReviewID": "RS7WXHXW7G2P3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What an improvement over the Kindle Fire HD!

In fact, it still works.  My son inherited it.Anyway, I was ready for something bigger, faster, able to do more, but not as heavy or big as my laptop.  So, I started researching, and quickly narrowed the field down to either the Lenovo Yoga Tab 10 (my laptop is a Yoga 13, which I LOVE) or the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  I had just about decided to save the $100 and get the Yoga, but there were a few things that kept nagging at me on some of the reviews.  The Yoga's processor lagged when it tried to do too much, the screen resolution was sub-par compared to other 10-inch tablets - those were the big two.So, finally, I bit the bullet and spent the extra money for the Fire HDX 8.9 - and I'm SO glad I did.This machine is so much faster than my old Kindle Fire, and pretty much anything else I've tried.  The screen is big, bright and crisp, making graphics just jump out at you.  The speakers are wonderful - loud and clear  The Wi-Fi works very well.  I have had no issues connecting to my network, even all the way across the house - meaning the signal has to travel through at least 5 walls.The battery holds up pretty well for me.  I have had the tablet for 8 days, and it is just now charging for the second time.  As a caveat, I have been at work for much of that 8 days, but I'm pretty sure that even on my off week, I should get 2 days per charge or so.  Now, I also bought a 11,000 mAh external battery pack at the same time I bought this, and I HIGHLY recommend the one I bought ( B00DUTVOU8 ).  I would really love a bigger battery (or a case with built-in battery), but it works just fine as-is.I have a co-worker who is an Apple aficionado, and he was impressed by the picture and sound quality.

Then I read a review comparing the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" to the Air, and was sold.  I love the extra size to make print larger.  An external keyboard did not work out for me, I need to hold the screen too close, and printing is still unexplored.  The young, sharp-eyed engineers decided that with the improved screen resolution they could decrease font size(!) of system text, like settings and messages.  Fie on them!  But web sites are easier to read.I tried the online help feature, and it is wonderful.  A helpful tech showed up in a postage stamp size window and we discussed my problem, I had accidentally turned on an awkward keyboard option, and she drew a red circle around the screen key to long press to turn off the option.  Great!Reading more closely about settings, I discovered I could turn off auto correct on keyboard entry.  That plus using a stylus makes writing on a Fire much easier.I am very pleased with this little computer.  I still need to find out about printing or maybe about storing files on line so I can access them from phone or Kindles.  I would be tempted by a larger one, too, within limits, but this one will do for some time.", "Title": "Love it!", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Author": "Richard A Schauer \"Jack Shadow\"", "ReviewID": "R2T3VDDD71VN3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A gift for wife.

I had been using the 8.9 Fire HD model and I really loved it.  I decided to upgrade because we are so often away from WiFi and I wanted the 4G LTE model.  The issue for me was that once I received the tablet, it was only then that I was made aware that this tablet will only support 4G not 3G at all(Verizon).  I live in an area with 3G and I travel to remote areas where I am lucky to get even a 3G signal.  I let Amazon know how disappointing this was and they kindly refunded the $100 I paid to get the 4G enabled tablet.  I was grateful but I would not have traded my Fire HD in the first place for just another tablet that was WiFi enabled.  Yes the graphics are better than the old tablet and yes there is now the ability to use Miracast technology so streaming is wireless with the use of a dongle I purchased, but this new tablet has issues.  I am writing this review on my laptop because while trying to type the review on the Kindle, it, for no good reason reloads the web page on which I am attempting to type, requiring me to start the review over and over again.  I fianlly gave up and decided to use my computer instead.  This issue has plagued my tablet since the first time I turned it on.  Generally it is only annoying but when you are typing and you have to begin a long review again, it becomes more than annoying.The books, music and video download with no problems and reading works seamlessly.  I did learn that with 3MG on my wifi I can stream a movie or TV show as long as it isn't in HD.  I will keep the HDX and live with the web page reloading issue but if you already have a Kindle Fire HD I would recommend keeping it.  Mine worked flawlessly 100% of the time.  I agree with some other reviewers that this device was rushed to market before all of the bugs were identified and corrected.  I am hopeful that software updates will remedy what ails my tablet.", "Title": "Not everything is as advertised", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Author": "Circe", "ReviewID": "R28WSLXN6UWIQY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm so excited to have the new Fire.

Vera", "ReviewID": "R19I6IWACT3FK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were early adopters to almost every single Kindle ebook reader, and we picked three of the original Kindle Fire 7\" as soon as they were announced. We eventually moved to the 7\" HD and last Christmas I got my wife the 8.9\" HDX because she wanted a larger screen.Our son had an iPad 2 as a Christmas gift in 2012 and my company issued me a second iPad 2 sometime in 2013. He likes his, but has already gone through one warranty repair for a bad GPU and three insurance claims for cracked screens (Walmart has an amazing warranty extension plus insurance, it's insane). My work iPad 2 hasn't broken yet, mostly because I don't use it. I hate the damn thing. It is slow, it is heavy and it is weird.And my hate for the iPad 2 got worse when I got the 8.9\" HDX for my wife because while the screen was smaller, the device practically weights nothing. And the screen is amazing. So I got myself one too.I actually like this thing so much that many times I read with it instead of using my PaperWhite. The PaperWhite is now used mostly when I am out of the house. If I am at home I rotate between the 8.9\" HDX and the PaperWhite. It is light enough that I can read or watch movies in bed, something I can't do with the iPad 2.Cons: Very hard to locate the back buttons by feel. In the 7\" HD I was used to run my finger along the edge (this is in the dark) until I felt the headphone jack, but now I have to feel for the speaker grille, which tells me if I am holding the device right.  Yes, I could turn on the lights, but the idea is to turn on the device without waking up my wife.Durability: it is too early to tell, but mine has already survived a nasty fall that would had murdered my iPad 2. I had the 8.9\" HDX on the holding tray on a treadmill, I knocked it over, it landed on the treadmill track, BANG, it bounced, landed on the hardwood floor, BANG. Not a scratch.Screen: fantastic. Photos look like glossy prints. Video looks incredible, no slowdowns at all. Reading is much more pleasant than on a 7\" Kindle Fire (for reading purposes you can't compare the original Fire to any of the e-ink Kindles), and nicer than the 7\" Kindle Fire HD (not by much, but it is better). I never play games but my wife seems to spend hours playing games on hers, never a complaint except mine whenever I see a new order for Amazon coins.Chassis: really nice, I like what Amazon did except that they could have added some kind of marking one could use to locate the buttons by touch. The buttons are better placed than on the HD 7\". And it weights nothing, it is amazing how light it feels.Software: Not a problem unless you depend on Google-branded apps. If you aren't joined to Google at the hip, then you won't feel much of a difference between this and a pure Android device. You can side load without jail breaking, or you can jail break the device and risk warranty issues later, but that's up to you. I believe that for most people this is very handy, especially if you are a Prime subscriber.Sound: I prefer headphones, but my wife uses hers with the built-in speakers exclusively, and they sound very nice.Value: Even tacking a 2-year square trade warranty+insurance policy, and even taking into account that you won't get Google-branded applications, this is a fantastic deal. I expect to pick up a third one as soon as my son's 7\" HD runs out of its warranty extension.", "Title": "I hate our two iPad 2s", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Author": "Marsha Goddard", "ReviewID": "R6YL0CKKNALRU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My new Kindle Fire is great!

Broussard", "ReviewID": "R3FLLUB1BLGMXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided that my older 2012 Kindle Fire HD 7 wasn't big enough for my fast changing school needs.  As technology is progressing, more and more of my classes are offering ebooks or online access to supplemental software/programs.  This semester 2 of my required books were only available as an ebook.  I did purchase them for the Kindle Fire HD 7, but it was a pain to use them.  I had to zoom in and out to see different areas of problems and pages and read ok.  Being accounting themed books, I was doing a lot of zooming and scrolling and shrinking to see the whole problem I needed to do for homework.  This of course took up a lot of time.  I also only got my Kindle in 8gb at the time and I was running out of storage room for items I wanted at all times on my kindle (music, movies, books, etc).  So I decided with my school refund I would apply it towards the Kindle HDX 8.9.What a smart move!  I have only had this 2 days and I am in love.  Even though it is \"8.9\" inches bigger, it seems to me like double the size.  I can see 1 whole accounting problem on the same page in a font that is easily to read.  Makes my homework much easier to get done.The screen clarity is much clear.  This was not a huge importance to me, but a big plus.  HD movies are crystal clear.  On the Older fire I had the HD movies were a smudge blurry.  In addition, it processes much faster.  I feel like my old kindle fire was \"dial up\" and this is \"cable'.The sound quality is impressive.  I feel like I was sitting in an i max theater watching an episode on prime last night.For the size this is very light.  Yes it weighs a few ounces with the case on than my previous fire, but overall when I hold it in my hand (most likely because of the larger size and more balanced weight) it feels lighter.  I got the Trident case to go with it.  (If you go with that case I do suggest a zippered tablet case in addition just to protect the screen.)The onscreen keyboard is much easier for me to use vs previous model kindle fires I have personally owned.The front and rear cameras are amazing. The rear camera does take some very nice quality photos.  I had a fun time today going around the apt complex snapping various shots.It is very nice we can download some of the prime movies and shows now to watch at a future date when we aren't or may not be connected to the internet (or maybe a really slow connection).I did go ahead and get the 64 gb.  I was going back and forth between the 32 and 64.  But honestly for the $50 difference, I knew I would be happier with 64.  I have many cd's and movies that I purchased.  I travel via train and plane often so like to load the kindle up with enough movies/music for the trip.  My parents are 7 hours away, so depending on what deals I get, I either fly or take amtrak.  It's nice to have the room to put enough entertainment onto the kindle for the trip.  My grandparent's don't have decent internet (they are still dial up) so I put enough for the length of my trip when I travel to them.  And with technology going towards e books I do have the room to put all my school books on there.I am not disappointing with my purchase at all.  When I have more funds I will be ordering a second for my roommate. She was eying one long before I gave it though.  Just made it into PTK (International Honor Society for 2 year colleges) and she got me a nice gift when I got into PTK, so I figured would be well worth a gift for her.  This would make a very nice gift for a graduating high school student or someone in college.  Like I said, technology for college is going towards all electronic.  All of my classes had e book options this semester...but 2 classes I could only get e books.  I am going to rent the e book for the other 2 classes just so I don't have to lug heavy books to/from school any more.The only one downside I want to share is Amazon put the $500 charge on my account as a \"hold\" and then charged again when shipped.  I was a little upset by this as I\"m still 2 days later waiting for that \"hold\" to clear.  I have ordered hundred of times off of amazon over several years and never has this happened.

Watched 1 on way to destination..was wonderful! On the way home I could NOT get the Kindle to play the 2nd movie, I couldn't even get it to play the 1st movie again.! aarrghhh!!  I have a cover that has a hole for the camera lens so I do not have to take the Kindle out of the case to take a picture, but everytime I take a picture I get this notice that I must lift Kindle out of case to take a picture, and this \"box\" will not go away, so I have to take a picture with it in the middle of my sight. The picture comes out without that box..but it is very irritating, I tried to use \"Mayday\" to tell them all of the above, but only got in about 5 mins and got cut off, (I have very good internet service) I tried two more times and it just said I could not connect ?!?!  The Kindle also died for 2 days, don't know what happend, I put it on the charger and left it for 3 days, Now it works fine..?!?
