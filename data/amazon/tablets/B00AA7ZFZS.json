I actually rooted it first thing, and put a skin over it. Once that was complete, it was as good as a regular tablet. With that being said, this is not a powerful tablet by any means, but gets the simple task done. Does lag with graphic intest games, sometimes booting does too. I liked the black alot better, some reviews were saying the white one will actually have fadded color and wash out after some time.Speakers gets pretty loud, i can feel the machine vibrate at times. The dim setting is pretty good also, unadvertendly did it once and thought it was broken because of how dark and \"unresponsive\" it was.Keep in mind, i did not purchase this tablet for reading purposes, hence I cannot comment on that end.
