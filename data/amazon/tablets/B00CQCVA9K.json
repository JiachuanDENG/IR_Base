No problems when keeping it plugged in.My only criticism is responsiveness.  Pretty much any icon I click on, I have to wait about 3-5 seconds for response.  Since this was purchased as an extra tablet for my 2 toddlers (who like to fight over the ipad to watch netflix at bed time), I've had a time trying to convince them to be patient and wait more (the iPad is obviously instant).  This, in itself, isn't too terrible.. but if the buttons get pushed too many times while \"waiting\", the unit has to be rebooted to work.

After reading the reviews, I thought they were going to be a great buy but much to my surprise, they didn't last.  After receiving them, I opened them to check them out and everything seemed fine except I kept hearing a slight humming sound while they were powered on.  I was immediately concerned, but it was so close to Christmas that I didn't want to risk sending them back for an exchange and end up not receiving them in time for Christmas.  It didn't take long before I realized that I probably should have.They have all of the features that I was expecting, but within the first 4 hours of my granddaughter opening hers, she dropped it one time.  The screen cracked and it completely stopped responding to touch.  I sent it back for an exchange, but was only able to get a refund.  In less than a week, I had to return my grandson's tablet as well.  After the first couple of days, the screen turned all blue and it stayed like that for at least 2 days.  It eventually came back to life, but that only lasted for another day before it was completely gone.  So after less than 7 days, I arranged to send his back for a refund as well.The reasons I gave it a 3 star rating instead of one star has nothing to do with the product itself, although the colors are rather cute.  But it has more to do with the excellent customer service regarding order processing, shipping/delivery, and returns/refunds.

That was my first mistake not reading thoroughly as I usually do and not buying within the United States. The tablet was slow doing anything,the battery life seemed to be short,there is no reset button to try. The settings menu for example looking up battery use you couldn't tell where you stood it says like 40% and then it would die. But, that wasn't the biggest issue as had it for a month and now it's completely dead. Now, if we go with just a bad tablet it happens and or something about the seller and overseas I can't answer about this tablet as it gets rave reviews which is why I bought it. One big positive I can say is the Amazon A-Z Guarantee. Make sure you have it. I asked them to step in when I was only having trouble before totally dying and I believe in less than 24 hrs. it was resolved and I received a full refund.  Another big positive to have on electronics from Amazon is the Square Trade Warranty. It's worth the extra money. I have had to use it in the past on another item and that is also everything you read on reviews. Easy,fast,amazing. Trying to be fair.

They love them so much, I now have to pry the zeepads out of their hands to get them to come to dinner.  This is NOT the same calibre tablet as the Kindle Fire HD or the iPad, or Samsung!  The screen is not HD, the touch sensors are sluggish, the processor is not fast and the battery life is relatively short.  That said, it works perfectly in the twin's small hands and gives them access to games and a camera AND it has the capacity for more memory.  I am happy give them this much power for less than $100.
