I just received the new Fire 8.9 which I ordered without advertisements. At first glance it is just bigger and heavier. But it has more storage, has a better screen, Bluetooth and a cool mosaic photo display when in landscape position. Yes, I have read the specs and know there is more under the hood but I don't care as long as it works well. I do like the layout of the new carousel and favorites better. I also like that it is harder to move the icons around in favorites. I like to put them in my own order but on the first Fire they would randomly skip across the screen by accident. One big OOOPPPS Amazon made is with the new case. If you are watching a video and you have the cover opened to support the Fire in the landscape position you cannot leave it plugged in. I am sure other companies will get on that soon. I do love the magnetic cover that turns the Fire on and off. I was horrified that there was no 'FLASH' because I watch several video podcasts that are still in flash. However, there is a flash work around. Go to your account, help, forums on the right and type in flash for Fire 8.9. There is a nice lady that has that all organized for you. You basically download a free app (ES File Explorer)  then download an old version of Dolphin Browser to the app and then the flash for Dolphin. It works perfect. Today as I watched my flash video podcast I was amazed at how good the video is on the new HD screen. Also, I actually think my music sounds better on the Fires so I take one to the gym instead of my iPod. I use AblePlanet noise cancelling headphones and ear buds and both are really really good. Good luck with your new toy.April 2013 Update - I loved this Kindle Fire but sadly in December it died on me and I had to return it. I hope to get another one soon.", "Title": "Gorgeous Screen, Better Sound & Flash Work Around", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1VHHUDZGFGWAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my fire hd for over a week now and i love it.  I`ve also had a kindle keyboard and original kindle fire.  Was not sure about purchasing the fire hd 8.9 at first but decided i wanted to try the larger screen so i pre-ordered it.  I never did use the kindle fire one handed so the larger size of the fire hd doesn`t bother me.  I love the hd screen and larger size.  Fire hd feels very well constructed.  I found it very easy to use but that may be because i had the kindle fire and so was not a first time user.  It should still prove easy to use for someone who is new to kindle fire.  Fire hd is very fast for surfing the web and watching prime instant videos.  Display is incredible with hd content and sound is good for a tablet.  I really like having the hdmi out port so i can connect it to my home theater.  Some have complained about no charging light like the original fire so you can`t tell when it`s fully charged but while that is an annoyance it`s not enough for me to ding the fire hd in my review.  Be careful how much trust you place in the overly negative reviews.  A lot of them seem to have been written by, a - apple fan boys who feel threatened and so surf the internet writing negative reviews of competing products, b - people with unreasonable expectations i.e. did not fully read product description before purchasing, and lastly, c - people who are not reviewing the fire hd at all but are leaving negative reviews because they have a bone to pick with amazon.  Lastly, just a thought about the lack of apps complaints.  Amazon is a merchant not a developer, it is up to the developers to make sure their apps work with the fire hd.", "Title": "kindle fire hd 8.9", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Author": "Paul S. Remington", "ReviewID": "RUGXCVSU1KKXY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review discusses whether or not to buy a Kindle in place of a different platform, such as an iPad.  It also discusses the pros and cons related to purchasing a new 8.9\" HD Kindle Fire as an upgrade to the old Kindle Fire.Maybe you're one of those who would like a tablet, but aren't entirely sure which one to buy.  Should you get an iPad, a NOOK, a Kindle, or some other tablet?  It's a big decision.  In the end, there is not one right decision, just the decision that is right for you.  Only you can make that decision, so I'll tell you our experience and you can compare that to how you think it might fit into your decision.Right now you're considering a Kindle from Amazon, and I won't say you're making a wrong choice.  The advantage of the Kindle is its price and how well it integrates Amazon content.  Being an Android-based device, there is an enormous amount of app support.  Not as much as Apple supports, but for most people, there's enough support to satisfy what you want to do.My wife has an iPad and I have a Kindle.  She loves her iPad, but she admits that there's nothing that she does on her Apple that she can't do on the Kindle.  Most everything she does on her iPad, she can also do on my Kindle.  She chose the iPad because her niece and sister have one and she wanted a similar device so she can map her apps in line with theirs.  I support her reasoning and it makes total sense.  She's Chinese and has language-specific apps she uses.  So, when making your decision, write down everything you feel you would like to do with the tablet, then research what native programs and downloadable apps there are that will enable you to do what you want on the tablet's platform (Android, Apple, etc.).  The Kindle is a lot cheaper than the iPad.  This is a major selling point some use to justify their choice of one platform over the other.For me, the Kindle is a more logical platform.  I love Amazon content and am an Amazon Prime member.  I have over 40 CDs I've purchased on Amazon and they all reside on the cloud (server-side storage my Kindle accesses wirelessly).  I've purchased a small library of books and love to browse their massive arsenal of products.  I feel like the Kindle was made for me.If you're like me and have already purchased a Kindle Fire and are considering upgrading to the new 8.9\" HD Kindle Fire, I can tell you it's a nice upgrade, but it's not perfect.So here's my list of cons for the new HD Kindle Fire.The Web browser on the 8.9\" HD Kindle, called Silk, doesn't support Flash.  The iPad also doesn't support Flash.  Some will tell you that you can't use Flash on the new HD Kindle Fire.  This is not true.  You have to install a different Web browser and do a few configuration steps to get Flash installed and working.  If you research this on the Web, you can locate instructions on how to do this.The old Kindle Fire came with a wall charger; the new HD Kindle Fire doesn't.  Charging is done very slowly using a USB cable connected to another device.  You can purchase a fast charger, but this is an extra purchase.  If you have the charger from your old Kindle Fire, you can use that also, and it'll charge much faster than the USB charger.  In fact, that old charger will charge as fast as the new \"fast\" charger for the HD Kindle Fire (sold separately).  If you're upgrading, you might want to save your money and just use your old charger.The old Kindle Fire had an LED on the power button that turned green when the Kindle was fully charged and Amber when it was still charging.  The new HD Kindle Fire doesn't have any LED, so you don't know the true state of the battery while it's charging.  There are apps you can purchase to help with this, but out of the box, the new HD Kindle Fire is not as convenient in this regard.I've had a few problems with the HD Kindle Fire not powering up after a charge.  This has happened three times in six weeks.  The first time, I called Amazon and was put through quickly (on a Sunday, I might add) to a technical support representative who instructed me to press and hold the start button for one minute, then let go, then press it again.  This forced a reboot of the device, and when it powered back up, everything worked great.  I was impressed with the rapid and helpful customer support.  I'm not sure what's causing the HD Kindle Fire to occasionally not power up, but the fix is a quick one and it happens rarely.Here is my list of Pros for the new HD Kindle Fire.The audio quality is excellent, for a tablet.  Don't look for any booming bass or ear splitting volume, but compared to the old Kindle Fire, it's a substantial upgrade.  The new HD Kindle Fire has surround sound audio processing that mimics wrapping the sound around you.  It actually works.  Watching movies or listening to music, there's an enhanced stereo effect that is a noticeable upgrade to the old Kindle Fire.The full-HD video quality is nicely enhanced on the new HD Kindle Fire.  If you look very close, you can see the individual pixels, but at a respectable distance, the video quality is much more uniform and smooth, colors are vibrant, and the video quality is richer.Wireless access I've noticed is much better.  I'm able to measure a 10dB to 20dB increase in wireless strength during side-by-side comparisons with my old Kindle Fire.  I've read others state they don't notice a difference, and perhaps that relates to the wireless router they have or where the router is situated, but I notice (and can measure) a difference.  Using the wireless bars on the GUI, my old Kindle Fire always displays three bars in most locations in our home while the new HD Kindle Fire displays four bars.The screen is noticeably larger, which is definitely a nice upgrade when watching movies, browsing the Web, or typing on the screen.  I still prefer the smaller Kindle Fire for book reading.  It's sized more like a paperback, but I do plenty of reading on the 8.9\" HD Fire also, so it doesn't detract from my enjoyment.I see a tablet like a tool in someone's tool chest.  Each tool has a specific function and each person needs to find the tool that's right for them.  For my wife, her tool is the iPad.  For me, it's the Kindle.  Which is it for you?", "Title": "Considering whether to upgrade or buy a Kindle?  Perhaps our experience can help you decide.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Author": "G. Denick", "ReviewID": "R15HQZ08L79SUE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own and have previously used a regular Kindle for reading, which I preferred using over traditional paperbacks. The Fire HD, remarkably, is even BETTER to read from - which came as a surprise to me, since I assumed it would not match the reading experience of the regular Kindle. I find the bright screen of the Fire HD to be marvelous to read from. I experience no glare, and can read for prolonged periods of time with no issues whatsoever. The screen can be read in any lighting condition, since it's so bright. For some people, it will be a tad TOO bright, but I believe you can adjust this in the settings. I'm not quite sure if I like this unit better than my 7\" Fire HD, but it's a toss up- they're both stellar. If you're going to use it primarily for reading books, the 7\" may be the best fit, but the 9\" would probably be better for heavy use of Netflix and/or reading of comics and magazines.What I really love about the Fire HD's reading interface is how it makes me a BETTER reader. How? A number of ways. First of all, I love the feature that lets me highlight passages that I like by simply running my finger over them, making them easy to revisit at a later time. I used to enjoy highlighting passages in traditional books, but I was generally too involved in my book to get up and go look for a pen - so I skipped it. Additionally, one of the Fire's functions conveniently stores all highlighted areas, so you can easily go back to your favorite parts (as well as having a simpler \"bookmark\" feature). You can even \"share\" the passages you like on social networks, if you're into that sort of thing. All of these things were possible with the regular Kindle e-reader, but with this tablet, they're 100x easier (thanks to an intuitive, responsive touch interface), and I actually find myself USING the features (all the time).The Fire HD also retains the ability to change the size of the font you're reading, quickly and easily. Again, this is something that the previous Kindle could do, but I find it much more intuitive with the touch controls. Once you get used to the way the device works (which doesn't take long), everything becomes second nature.What else? Page turns are smooth and seamless (something the original Fire stuttered on). Turning pages is incredibly slick - you don't even get that brief \"black flash\" that the regular Kindle performs to refresh its pixels. In fact, you can even PARTIALLY turn the pages, just like in a real book! You turn pages with a quick swipe of the thumb. But if you keep your thumb on the screen/page, you can gently begin to turn the page forward/backward, and hold it where you want. Very useful, if you quickly want to go back to the last sentence or two you read on the previous page, or peek ahead to see if you're near the end of the chapter.I also find that I love having color in my Kindle. Although reading is primarily a black and white affair, it's great to have color when you're perusing the covers of the books in your library, as well as when you're seeing the occasional picture. I generally read novels, but I've perused comics and picture books, and the Fire HD delivers in stunning fashion.Speaking of that color screen (and it should be mentioned that cramming 720p resolution into a 9\" screen is a technological marvel), video is also outstanding (something that I also couldn't do on my previous Kindle). It's really fun to read for a bit in bed, and then catch a quick episode of \"Parks and Rec\" on the Netflix app. It doesn't look quite as sharp as it does on my 40\" 1080p Samsung (understandable), but it looks darned good, and I feel like it might get even better with downloaded movies (as opposed to streaming). I watched a trailer for a Batman movie on the demo unit at Staples, and it was incredible- it's what sealed the deal for me. The sound on the Fire HD is everything it's been hyped to be, coming through crisp and loud. I also like the placement of the speakers, because if you hold the tablet with both hands, it bounces off of your palms and comes right back at you (although you can still hear it just fine, no matter how you hold it).The Fire HD has some faults - the charging time is painfully slow with the included USB charger, the power button is ridiculously hard to find, and the surface of the back is a bit too slippery. But these flaws are easy to overlook, considering all that I get in return from my Fire HD. It truly makes me look forward to reading every night, and it's a lot of fun to build and browse my digital library (I'm currently collecting Newberry Medal winners - and the ease with which I can quickly download these should also be commended).

Howard \"Kindle Ho\"", "ReviewID": "R1PFUG5AI2U3S1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading so many asinine 1- and 2-star reviews, I thought I should go ahead and get my review out there.  And before anyone has a chance to question it, though this is not a verified purchase, I DO own this device.  My folks were kind enough to let me purchase this through my Dad's account, and pay him back over time.  But anyhooooo, about the device...The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was how thin the Fire was!  The original Fire, though I absolutely love mine, was rather blocky.  My new baby was charged up, so I turned it on and checked out the picture.  Absolutely freaking beautiful!  Before I really played with it, I plugged it in and charged it up.  No, a charger was not included with it.  But I READ the product description and knew that, so I had already ordered the quick charger, even though I already had other chargers.When it was pretty quickly charged, I got down to some serious playing.  I have to admit that I am totally blown away by the beauty of the picture.  I don't own any other HD devices, so I was not prepared for just how gorgeous the images would be.  I was easily able to explore the Fire, as the quick tutorial explained what was needed to get started.  I loaded a number of books, lots of music and apps, and some pictures.  I am thrilled that this device can be loaded with my personal pictures.  It was extremely easy to do through the cloud.  And they look fantastic!I checked out the sound.  Dang, Green Day and Pink sounded absolutely awesome coming through the Dolby speakers!  No, it doesn't sound like a Bose sound system, but come on....this is a tablet.  I think it sounds fabulous.  Haven't tried it with headphones yet, but I will.I then played on the reading app.  Love it!  Though I do most of my reading on my Kindle Keyboard and Paperwhite, it will be very easy to read on this device.  Everything was crisp and clear...I especially like the sepia background; it's very easy on the eyes.Now we come to the apps.  No, not all of the apps I had on the original Fire would load onto the Fire HD.  Nor did I expect them too.  And I frankly don't care.  If I want to play them, I'll play on the original Fire.  Rooting?  Side loading?  Huh?  Nope, don't even want to attempt that.  I'm very pleased with the content I can get for my device from Amazon.  I bought this tablet for entertainment purposes.  And I know as time goes by, more apps will be adapted to work for the Fire HD.  The 8.9\" screen makes such a huge difference when playing apps.  I no longer worry about going blind playing Mahjong on my smaller screen!I then decided to check out some TV episodes I bought.  Copper looks fantastic on the HD screen!  I also checked a Prime movie - X-ray is such an awesome idea.  No more going crazy trying to figure out who is playing a particular role; I just look it up without having to go to the web.  Watching movies is truly a beautiful experience on the Fire HD.  I haven't used HDMI (did I type that correctly?).  I don't have an HD TV.  Besides, I like to watch on my 8.9\" screen.My Yahoo and Hotmail e-mail accounts were easily set up.  I like the e-mail app on the Fire HD better than the one on the original Fire.  I went to the browser and put my favorite websites on and bookmarked them.  This device is much faster than the Fire.  I will admit that the browser locked up and reset a few times.  I'm using a stylus, and sometimes I tap more than I should (which I did on the original Fire because I had to).  I'm getting used to the screen, though, and it's happening less as time goes by.  And I have had tabs not respond; but they recover so quickly, it's a total non-issue for me.I believe Amazon Prime is a MUST if you own this device.  Besides the free shipping on millions of items, you WILL want the free Prime TV shows and movies to get the most out of your Fire HD.I highly recommend the Fire HD 8.9\" 32GB with no hesitation whatsoever.  I mentioned some of the asinine reviews I read and would like to touch on a few points.  If you read the product description, you will know what this device can and cannot do.  Unless you live under a rock, I don't know how anyone doesn't know that Adobe no longer supports flash and is no longer used on new android devices.  And I can't say I know absolutely for sure what flash is, but I know I don't miss it!  Same goes for the device not coming with a charger; it's not listed in what comes in the box, and it has been discussed here more than once..  Someone said his Fire HD had sharp edges.  Eh?  Still trying to figure that one out!  The edges of mine are very nicely rounded, thank you very much.  There's no forward facing camera!  Call me crazy, but if I want to take pictures, I use a camera (or my cell phone if it's a \"photo emergency\").  Reviews have downgraded the device because of packaging or delivery times.  Sorry, but what does that have to do with the performance of the device?  There were also the reviews that were not reviews of the Fire HD, but were plugs for their favored Nook or Apple devices.  Then there are the defectivebydesign mindless Zombie reviews.  No comment.  But my favorite bad review was the guy who couldn't stand touchscreen devices.  Then why the heck did you order one that you KNEW was a touchscreen device?!?!?!Get one of these babies for yourself and check it out.

AMAZON PRIME EXPERIENCE:I have Amazon Prime, and I am a pretty devoted customer. I use Amazon quite often for purchasing goods and for watching movies/shows, so I wanted to take advantage of the Prime experience with Amazon's own Kindle Fire HD product.2. 8.9\" PERFECT SCREEN SIZE:It has the perfect screen size. It isn't too small like the 7-inch tablets, and it isn't too big and bulky like the ~10-inch tablets.3. BEAUTIFUL RESOLUTION1920x1200 with 254 PPI. That's almost like IPAD 4's RETINA Display, but almost half the price.4. DUAL SPEAKERS DOLBY SOUND SYSTEM:The only tablet with dual speakers, and with the legendary Dolby.5. PRICEPrice was relatively cheap. Although, competitive tablets are reducing their price to try to compete.After a few days of use, I was able to pin-point the PROs and CONs of the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", or at least my specific Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" device.PROS:1. Screen Resolution: Absolutely beautiful2. Sound System: Possibly the best sound system of all tablets. Plus there's an app to boost the volume.3. Amazon Prime Experience: Easy to use to watch Amazon Prime movies/videos and Amazon MP3 Cloud music4. Screen Size: Perfect for me5. Amazon Support: Great customer support to answer  any Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" questions or issuesDespite all that, I believe my specific Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" was defective. First of all, when my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" was delivered, it was delivered without a box and protective airbags, it just came by itself in the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" black box. I found my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" black box in the dirt in front of my house and it was pretty badly beaten up on the edges and sides. When I opened it everything was there, but my info card/manual was already taken out, but my Kindle was still in the plastic wrap and the USB was still under it.After one day of use, I noticed some bad things about my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". This included:CONS:1. Battery: Device would get REALLY hot after a few minutes of use (After 20 minutes of use playing the Oregon Trail game app, my Kindle's battery was over 118 degrees Fahrenheit according to the Battery app). My device even automatically shut down one time. Also I only get about 6 hours of battery life (instead of the promised over 10 hours) with moderate web surfing ONLY with default 70% brightness.2. SILK Web Browser: Absolutely crap. The SILK browser for my Kindle was really slow, and it lagged my whole device. Swype typing was about 1.33 seconds slower than my finger speed, and pulling the top notification/setting bar down was really blocky. SILK was incompatible with several webpages, and could not finish running any browser tests. On several occasions, SILK automatically closed on me while I was browsing, and I lost the page I was on because it restarted back to SILK's homepage when I reopened it. Also does not have Adobe Flash Player.3. Processor Speed: My processor speed was pretty rubbish. My phone (Atrix HD) runs faster than my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, and my phone isn't even that fast (has same dual core 1.5ghz though). Very blocky and laggy on several apps other than the home screen carousel.4. Carousel: This isn't a defectiveness, but it is a CON. When I download apps that are not from the app store, the app's picture on my carousel is very pixelatedRecommendations and Tips:- Download Dolphin Browser, it works a lot faster and you can get Adobe Flash Player on it. Also better quality everything.- Recommended Apps (not from App Store, google around for it): Dolphin Browser, ES File Explorer, Adobe Flash Player 11, 1Mobile Market gets you YoutubeI have contacted Amazon about my specific Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" device and they are sending me a replacement. I will update this review a few days after receiving the replacement.", "Title": "Promising, but mine seemed defective", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Author": "gtucker7848", "ReviewID": "R1P2E854T5MTJX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Disclosures: I have owned every Kindle product from the first generation E-reader. Additionally, I have owned and temporarily used an IPad, an Asus Transformer tablet, and a Samsung Galaxy Note tablet. I currently use, and very much enjoy, a Motorola Xoom tablet (second generation). With all that said, here are my thoughts on the Kindle Fire 8.9\" tablet (16g, without special offers, no LTE).Pros: My first impression upon holding the tablet is that it is extremely thin and light. The footprint size is almost identical to an android based 10.1\" tablet, however the screen size of the Kindle Fire is only 8.9\". This creates a very large bezel around the Kindle Fire, but the trade off is that the Fire is much thinner (only half the thickness of my Xoom tablet) and therefor much lighter. The rest of the hardware is limited and strait forward. A USB charging port, a volume rocker (nice upgrade from the first generation) and a small and somewhat hard to locate power button. Many reviews complain about the power button, but I rather like it. the fact that it is small and somewhat stiff means that it is not easily triggered by accident. Additionally, there is a utility grade front facing camera (meant to be used as a web cam for skype, which is pre-loaded on this tablet), as well as dual dolby speakers on the back of the device. The speakers are absolutely the best I have ever heard on any tablet, bar none.The software remains geared towards Amazon content consumption, with several very nice upgrades from the first generation model. First, the menu options have been expanded, and now include audiobooks, games, photos, and shop. As always, all content is stored for free in the cloud if you pay for prime membership (only $80/year). The on board productivity apps, including email, calendar, and contacts, sync seamlessly with all your active accounts, including Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Outlook,Twitter, Facebook, etc. The overall user interface is basically the same, with a couple of nice additions. First, the favorites section is no longer a book shelve format, instead being accessed by a star icon available at all times. The navigation tools are always available with a swipe from the right bezel, and the settings and notifications bar are always available with a swipe from the top bezel. One very nice addition is in the music application. You can now leave your music or playlist on all the time, and control it through the notification bar. This is a very quick and easy way to control your background music. The newsstand application is simply amazing, as usual, and makes similar offerings from Apple and Google seem pedestrian and silly. Additionally, Amazon has included more settings within the books application (such as different font styles and background options) which make this tablet very functional as a e-book reader as well. The whisper sync and Xray options are as advertised and basically still in development mode, with only a limited amount of content currently being able to take advantage of them.Cons: The main user interface, basically a giant carousel, is really out dated. With the menu options available across the top of the device, and the favorites icon easily accessible, Amazon really should come up with some home screen widget options for this caliber of tablet. Additionally, the battery life on this tablet is average at best, and it takes a ridiculously long time to charge. From 10% battery life remaining, it takes a full 4-5 hours to receive a full charge, and this is using the fast charging adapter (sold separately?!?!). My Xoom tablet has better battery life, and fully charges in less than an hour.Overall: First, let me take a moment to comment on some of the product reviews I have read for the Kindle Fire 8.9\" tablet. You not knowing how to use the device, or not fully researching the specifications of the device, does not make this an inferior device. Additionally, you having an outdated wireless internet connection does not make this a slow device. And finally, not having access to 800,000 apps (think about that for a second), does not make this a useless device. YOU GUYS KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!!This product is completely as advertised. If you use Amazon prime, or have a content collection through Amazon already, this is an absolutely great tablet. Within five minutes of unboxing the device, you will be set up and ready to go. The apps that are available will likely include everything you already use from an independent developer. Netflix, Hulu, Snag, Pandora, Pulse, Flipboard, HBO go, News Republic, Tune in radio, Evernote, its all here. If you have purchase your content through Apple or Google, why are you even reading this, this tablet is not for you. Additionally, if you need a tablet for heavy work related productivity requirements, this is not your device. You need to be reading the product reviews for a Windows 8 device instead. If you want to watch movies and TV shows, listen to music, read books and magazines, check your emails, browse the web (including Google's mobile website and Youtube videos, which are supported), skype with friends and family, browse and share your photos, and play some fruit ninja, then this is as good a tablet as you will find in today's market. Throw in the $300 price tag, and the unmatched free content offerings available through Amazon Prime, and its a no brainer!Finally, I am very familiar with Amazon tablets. If you're considering buying one, but have some questions I'd be happy to offer whatever help I can.

Snyder", "ReviewID": "R3JLRRNWI56BBI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have my new kindle and I played with it all weekend to rather mixed opinions on it.  I've had 6 kindle devices since the initial K1 and this is by far the most versatile.  As far as Amazon content goes, it works very well with them and has pretty good user interfaces to search that content.Here are some of my initial thoughts on the device:PROS* The fonts and covers on books are incredibly sharp.  The book library and store interfaces aren't much different from the one on the original Fire - it just has a much better resolution.* In streaming video, it's much easier to flip back and forth between Prime and regular movies without having to backtrack first.* It weighs about the same as the original Fire but it's much larger so it's thinner with the weight distributed across a larger area.* It has a camera - even though I would have preferred a back facing one - that works well for video conferencing.CONS* Silk still opens duplicate tabs when restarting the browser and it continues to crash at times so to that degree it's the same as that on the original Fire.  It seems to work better on pages with numerous updates like Google+ but it still needs a bit more work so it feels similar to a desktop experience.* Silk takes an extra tap now to get to bookmarks.* The original Fire had a wood grain background - this one is just black - there is just the carousel against a blank background.  The wood grain would be appreciated (if one can't choose from a set of backgrounds) to make the device seem more visually interesting when on the home screen.* They've increased the number of places where they advertise to you.  I'm dissatisfied that I have to pay extra to turn off 'special offers' while also having to turn off the 'also bought' feature on the carousel.  These are both correctable but I dislike that the application defaults to advertising to me.* I've had some trouble with my Fire waking itself up after I put it to sleep - and with it turning itself back on after I power it down.

Easy to say - you don't get to five without liking the product.Worth the $15 to lose the Special Offers start-up screen, but in their own way the specials appearing below the carousel are impressive - they're dependent on which carousel item is in the main spot. I'm sure I'll tire of them, and my prediction is that there will be a way to get rid of them in the near future - anybody else remember how awful the first-generation carousel was at initial launch?Obviously, Amazon is using this device to encourage shopping, but after opening my first book on this device and seeing it rendered so well, I was sold. I have a background in typography, and this device set the type perfectly. When type is set perfectly, it's easy to read and all you have to concentrate on is the book.The double Wi-Fi antennas make this faster than any other Wi-Fi device in my household. Kudos for that idea. Sound is good, this version has Bluetooth and so I can use my already-owned Bluetooth speakers. All my Amazon content showed up as available for download, and in my case that's nearly a hundred books.Screen graphics are great - colors are rich and details well rendered. A step up from the first generation Kindle Fire.HUGE improvement in battery life. First generation was a battery hog; this one is WAY better. I've ordered one of the faster rechargers for it, so there will be a lot less recharging needs. The Amazon case is a great addition. It protects and shuts the screen off as you close it. Then it opens the screen back up when you open it.I'm very happy a week in, and my first generation Fire improved over the year as more apps were released for it and older apps updated.

They already had a desktop up the stairs and I had installed a router to give them wireless.  I wanted something for them to use downstairs such that the stairs would be less of a barrier.This looks to fit the bill.Also, the camera will be something I engage too although I haven't yet.

On the top of my Kindle is my name and next to it the words are \"4th Kindle\".  I liked the Kindle from the onset and they just keep getting better and better.There is no reason to go over the features because several others here have done an excellent job of that.  I will simply tell you that there is not much to criticize with this product.  Amazon has really done a great job and at a great price.  I am in a position to help others who are confused with computers or tablets.  I've spent time with many of  the other brands but, I will state loud and clear that I love this Kindle compared to many others.I did read the negative reviews here and some if not all made me chuckle.  No, there is no instruction booklet to read, it is all on the Kindle itself and it is not difficult to find.  The negative reviews made me wonder if any research or product reading was done before they ordered their Kindles.  The objections and dislikes I saw are all a matter of using the Kindle or going online and looking for the answers.  The Kindle forum here on Amazon is a wonderful place to visit and get help or good advice.Five stars plus is my vote.  If I had a wish for just one thing it would be to have a little mark on the screen where the on/off button is.  I agree it's not easy to find even though it is dead middle of the case but very imbedded.  I never turn my other Kindles off by mistake but I did manage to do it twice with this one.  Perhaps when my case/cover arrives that will be put to rest.  Heck, maybe that's what Amazon had in mind?  Most of the new covers turn the Kindle on and off automatically.

Excellent screen, Dolby stereo sound that is second to none. Perfect size for reading. And the price!  You get so much more for your money than an Ipad!  Once you install google market on this, the apps are endless.  A lot of people complain of the limitations of this tablet, like the limited app store.  But there are workarounds that will open up the potential for this tablet.  For example, after installing google play market on this, I've got all my google apps (gmail, maps, google+, youtube), and numerous other apps running on this bad boy.  In researching for a tablet, I was looking at many different tablets including all the android tablets (7inch and 10 inch).  I ultimately decided on the 8.9 because of its perfect size for reading, in particular books, textbooks, and medical journal articles.  Highly recommend this tablet if you like to read and use Amazon services.Update: I just wanted to address some of the common complaints I see in other reviews.1. Lack of Flash Player: News flash! ALL ICS android devices do not support Flash.  It has essentially been discontinued by Adobe. Ipad never had flash. If you want Flash, install Dolphin Browser and the Flash apk.2. Lack of Android Apps:  You have two options here.  1. Sideload the Apps: Just install whatever app you want from apk file (don't have to root)  or  2. Google Play market: If you want access to all the Android apps, then you need to install the Google Play Market. It may be possible without rooting it but I haven't tried it myself (I rooted mines).3. Ads - they just appear on your lockscreen and no where else. It's not a big deal.4. No AC charger - You can use any of your micro-USB AC chargers from your other devices (ie tablets, phones).  It's a standard universal micro-usb charging port. If you don't have any, they are cheap and only a few bucks to buy.Final words:  If you want an ipad, just buy an Ipad! This is first and foremost an E-reader tablet, that is meant to be used in Amazon's ecosystem.  This is a great deal at $299 ($200 less than the cheapest Ipad 4) and with some workarounds, you can turn this into a full-blown tablet that can rival any Ipad experience.", "Title": "Excellent!", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Author": "Shawn W", "ReviewID": "R2B3XS5XQ72SYZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased one at $249 during Amazon's promotion. I got it two days ago and I'm not extremely disappointed with the product and Amazon's customer service.Pros:+ Really nice screen, and it feels nice to touch. Nook HD+ has better viewing experience but Fire HD+ has much better touch experience.+ Can watch Amazon prime.+ Loud speakers+ Content viewing is supposed to be good, but my unit is super slow.Cons:+ Very slow, laggy - I will talk about this in detail later+ Speakers are rear facing so you can't watch a video in bed properly.+ Hard edges hurt my palms+ Locked Android so you need to root it and run Google apps and have full Android experience.+ Can only support one account.+ Silk browser is slow and all you are viewing will be recorded by Amazon for Ads targeting.+ Input is poor. I wish I could install other input methods in android.So let's talk about its slowness. It's slow in almost all aspects. Book reading, web browsing, Video watching, app running (e.g. flipboard). When I read a book, page flipping has 1-2 s delay. It even feels slower than my paperwhite! Web browsing is slow but I guess it's because Silk redirected your URL to Amazon server first. The most important thing is bad video experience because Amazon prime is the only reason I bought this tablet on top of my other Android tablets. I tried 3 TVs/movies, all of them froze at about 5 min into the play. It's only the graphic that is frozen. Sound is still going on.I'd imagine this is a defective device as how can a new Android device with 1.5G duo core CPU be this poor? Even Nexus 7 can do better. So I contacted Amazon for a replacement. The first one ask me to restart the device, and I told her that I had already done that. Then she asked me to factory reset, and wait for 48 hours to see!!! I'm an IT expert and I know this is bulls***. It was late at night so I didn't spend much time carrying on the chat. The second day, I called again. Amazon customer service is just pushing me around, from this department to another. They put me on hold for more than 20 minutes to transfer to amazon instant video team, can you believe that?! I got a defective device, you should just fix it for me. I have no time to help your team debugging devices.Anyway, I thought the above is my unit's problem so I'd have given it a higher rating, but according to Amazon's response, they don't think it's a defective device. Wow, if Fire HD+ is like this, it doesn't even worth $100 to me. What's use of it if you can't watch HD TV and read a book smoothly? My old Galaxy Tab 10.1 is even better than it. I'm so angry with the whole experience. Even if I bought it from Best Buy, I could get a replacement easily by telling them that I'm not satisfied.

Some of the negative reviews are beyond comprehension and just plain silly, but with some merit. I now own the 8.9\" Fire HD and my wife has the 7\" Fire HD. She finds the smaller unit a better fit for her purse, since I don't carry a purse, the larger unit is perfect for me. It also is a bit smaller than the 10\" tablets and perhaps the ideal size for those wanting both an e reader and a good internet tablet. We are both extremely happy with our purchases. With my HD I have easily been able to connect with the apps I use either through the Kindle store or directly through the web. Email connection with my Comcast account took 30 seconds to activate on the Kindle. It was easy to sync with my Google calendar and IGoogle and I had no problem sending documents from my PC to the Amazon cloud. For example, I uploaded the digital manual for my new mini cooper to the Amazon Cloud and opened it up on my KIndle - easier to read and find things than on the print version. I have had absolutely no problem with wifi connection, speed has been way beyond adequate, and of course the screen is beautiful. As an e reader, pages are clear, crisp, and page changing is fast. I'm very pleased with our purchases,snd also, I appreciate the reasonable pricing on these machines.As for the criticisms posted on this review site, yes I would have liked an included charger; the lack of flash has not interfered with any of my tasks; having an external charging light would have been nice, but I will survive; my fingers very easily find the power and volume buttons; why would I want to use a 9\" tablet to take photos; maybe Amazon could have included a bit more written documentation, but all you could ever want is in the Kindle itself or on the web support pages. I got rid of the \"other buyers have recommended scroll\" through the updated software; the other ad thing on the lock screen is on my soon to be deleted list for 15 bucks, but isn't as annoying as some people claim (except for Mickey Mouse appearing several times); delivery of both Kindles was before the expected delivery date.If you want more bells and whistles, need to have access to every app in the universe, need every device you own to be capable of taking pictures, can't live without a blinking charge light, and prefer written documentation, the Kindle Fire HD may not be for you.

Two Kindle Fire HD's", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Author": "MattIM", "ReviewID": "RDE8RHXSS2W7O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Full disclosure: my first tablet is an iPad. I have used this tablet everyday since I bought it 2.6 years ago. It continues to serve me very well. It is a simple, elegant, and well created device. From the very beginning, the first app I acquired was the Kindle app. I have read many books on this Kindle app. About a year and half ago, Apple and Amazon changed the terms of use and acquisition within the Kindle app. You could no longer purchase a book from the app. You had to go to Amazon.com to buy a book and it would then synch to the app. I did not have a problem with this change but it did throw an extra step into my book purchasing process. It was not enough of a bother to abandon my iPad and get the Kindle hardware.When Amazon announced this product back in September 2012. I was curious about it. It looked pretty sleek and it had the media buzz about as equal to the release of a new Apple product. I started reading about it all over the internet and @ Amazon.com. So I formulated my rationalization plan on acquiring this new device:1.  The screen had to be as good as my iPad screen.2.  It had to enable me to acquire Amazon product easily-->very interested in Amazon Prime.3.  It would be a back up device for my other tablet with cellular access when wifi not available.I ordered the Kindle Fire HD (KFHD) 8.9 4G/32gig tablet on October 26, 2012 and it was delivered on 11/29/2012, one day earlier than Amazon advised. The KFHD arrived by US POST! But it started somewhere in the USA handled by FedEx. The packaging was superb. Too bad you had to rip the package to get into the device, as it makes a beautiful box otherwise.The KFHD had enough power to launch BUT during the set up process, it does advise you to plug it in. **When I ordered this device, I was warned that it did not come with a charger. I don't know how people miss that advise. In Amazon's way, it tells you that people who purchase this item also bought a charger, screen protector, and a cover/case. I'm glad that a charger was not included. I have three chargers for my iPad and I can use these chargers to plug in the KFHD's cable. Good idea Amazon-->one less device to throw away or store somewhere.The set up process was really easy. The KFHD already recognized me!! And it stepped me through the process of connecting to my home WiFi. Right after that process completed, the KFHD stepped me through the process of signing up for the 250MG/12 month introductory 4GLTE AT&T; cellular data.  ***A lot of negative comments about this cellular data is unwarranted, IMHO. AT&T; is a reputable company, the set up process to access their network was very simple. Why people had problems filling out what is in essence an application form that consisted of Name, Address/City/State/Zipcode, email address and credit card is beyond me.I am speculating that since AT&T; has been the cellular provider in past iterations of the Kindle, adding other cellular data providers would probably require hardware changes as well. For example, AT&T; and Verizon do not use the same cellular technology. Giving a poor review to the KFHD because you cannot choose your cellular data provider is like going to a bread store and demanding to buy meat. For you iPad owners, we now have a choice of buying a branded AT&T; or Verizon or Sprint iPads. Amazon would need to do the same if they were inclined to spend time to negotiate similar deals with other providers.Now, onto the device itself. The screen resolution is really good. It almost compares to the Retina screen on the iPad (3/4th generation). I can see a difference between the KFHD screen and the iPad but if I didn't have the ability to compare it would be very difficult. The KFHD's home page is easy to navigate and to scroll through every thing I have accessed on it. I have to double tap on my iPad to do the same thing. I like having my iPad apps in folders, but I can grow to like the simplicity of the KFHD's presentation.I am a little bit puzzled about aquiring apps outside of Amazon. Apparently you have to go into settings to enable this function. And then you have to go to Google+ Play to get other apps not in the Amazon app store.Amazon's browser is different. You can access other websites but the speed of acquiring those websites seems a lot slower. But faster on the KFHD than an iPad. If you want to go backwards on the screen you are reading, the back button is on the side and not embedded in the window.There is a star icon that if you press it, gives you a list of favorite apps that you can launch without going to the home screen.The sound is certainly a lot richer than the monotone iPad. I watched a 15 minute segment of a movie on the KFHD, picture and sound was very realistic. I can get the same sense on my iPad but I have to plug in earphones to the iPad.The KFHD form factor, its size and weight, is easier to hold over a longer period of time than doing the same function on my iPad.In summary, the KFHD is a very good device to acquire and use Amazon Kindle products. It is certainly a lot more reasonably priced than comparable iPad products. The 4G cellular data is a bargain compared to the the US$14.95 250 mg per month AT&T; subscription on the iPad. I hope this 'introductory offer' will continue for as long as I own this device. The screen and stereo sound are attractive. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a tablet to read books, watch TV/Movies, and browse websites. This has met all my requirements. I cannot rate it a five star device because there is no technology available that would merit such praise.

Here's an update that I have to post:IF YOU USE FACEBOOK A LOT, DON'T GET A KINDLE FIRE HD. There is a major issue which at this time seems unresolved.  The Kindle Fire HD will only allow a few recent news feeds to be displayed (like maybe 15 to 20).  The last few will be displayed shaded in blue and you can't load any more of them.  So if you want to scroll down to something that you saw an hour or so ago, forget it.  The only work around that I found was to change the user agent to \"desktop\" instead of \"android\" in settings, but that makes some posts with pictures too big to view. One suggestion from an Amazon moderator on the Kindle Fire User's Forum was for us users to contact Facebook and make them aware of the problem.  It seems to me that Amazon ought to be the one to take such an initiative, since it is Amazon's modification of the Android platform that has probably caused the problem.UPDATE OF UPDATE (2/2012): The Facebook issue is resolved in the both the Facebook App and the Facebook site within Dolphin Browser on my Kindle HD.

The main reason for that is that Google play app store is not accessible on it and the Amazon app store is just not that good at this point in time as it does not have all the apps. Thus you need to know how to access other app stores like getjar etc. It will also help if you know how to sideload apps.There are a lot of articles on the net which provides you tips and tricks to get most out of this great device. I would recommend the following apps.1. An app like es file share that lets you explore the contents of your kindle. This will help you to find the apps which you can download from other app does our forums. Once you download the apps using ess file share you can find the downloaded apk file and install the app.2. Dolphin or chrome browser. I am not impressed with silk and find dolphin to be a better choice. Chrome is my second choice as it syncs all my activities from other devices but to install chrome and other google apps you will have to a little bit of research.there is a post on xda developers forum which provides step by step instructions to install google apps without rooting your kindle.3. Google apps. As i said in the point above kindle does not come pre installed with Google apps, so you will have to download them using the instructions on the net. The email client that comes puree installed sucks big time with gmail. For me it will stop syncing and i will have to remove and re add my account. Also it does not had a lot of other features provided by google gmail app.I will also advise a user guide like the one by Shelby Johnson. It has step by step instructions to get the most out of your kindle.It might sound like you have to go through a lot of hoops to get all your favorite stuff on it, but that actually is a plus point for me as it shows me the power of open source world (again different people will have different opinion about that but that's my personal opinion) and i can choose what apps i want and which ones i don't and i can get the apps from multiple sources rather being tied to just one.I will also recommend Adobe reader app over the default pdf reader. It's a free app and provides great features for your personal pdf files.Of course the default book, video and music apps for the content downloaded from Amazon app store are great.So in a nut shell the hardware on this tablet is great while the pre-installed software is so so. But the deficiencies of the software can be easily rectified using the other available alternatives.

After using the product, I have tried all 5 of my needs and have been impressed with the performance in all five categories.Most consumers don't stop and think what they actually want from a product - they just buy whatever has the best specifications (best screen, Gorilla glass, largest memory, fastest processor, blah blah blah...) This is not the smart way to be a consumer. If you want an apple, you don't need to buy an apple orchard. The Kindle is a product aimed at a specific set of use cases. If you are someone who likes reading, reads textbooks in PDF format, likes ridiculously fast web browsing, and wishes to sideload APKs, this is the item for you. If you want something smaller than 9 inches (not useful for reading PDFs), or something that has widgets and the Anrdoid interface, or something that has cloud storage that isn't amazon products, or something that is clearly stated in the product description as not being a service that Kindle Fire provides... then don't buy it.If everyone who bought kindle, read everything in the description and bought the product based on what it does well, this item would have no less than 5 stars. Every Android application can be installed on the Amazon Kindle without the Google Play Marketplace by simply directly downloading the APK and installing it.If you want an item for these five things, there is absolutely no better product on the market. I can't believe how lucky I was to find something that perfectly suits my consumer needs. I'm sure Kindle Fire HD \"8.9 does other things well, but I don't care about them.

Weller \"Multi-tasker\"", "ReviewID": "R1WTN41CNFYUP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 4G does everything it's been advertised to do, and it does it well.  The images on the screen are crisp and detailed, and the sound is gorgeous, even without earphones.  You can play an MP3-recorded  Bruckner symphony on it, without earphones, and get a very decent rendition (with earphones you'd think you're smack in the concert hall).  The Silk engine is quick and reliable, so going online is a cinch.  As a reader, it has resolved the problem of reading Tables on the Kindle, not only because text is easily readable, even if small, as a result of the bright background and the high resolution, but also because the Fire HD has a feature that allows you to focus on a Table section and enlarge it by tapping.When I first got my device, in late November of 2012, I had problems receiving email from a non-preinstalled provider (Earthlink in my case) but the problem was resoved around Christmastime with the latest software update (version 8.1.4) and, since then, I've had no problem receiving email from Earthlink (Hotmail and Yahoo have never been a problem).  Incidentally, the very annoying deficiency that plagues the first-generation Kindle Fire, and even the Kindle Fire II (non-HD), i.e., the inability to target a text search, has been resolved in both the 7\" and the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD.So, the device truly delivers.  Amazon, on the other hand, is still behind with some issues.  For instance, the Kindle Fire HD can't yet install or read reference works, such as dictionaries, which are readily available on other Kindle readers, such as the Kindle Touch or the Kindle Paperwhite.  This limitation unfortunately robs the Kindle Fire HD of the bragging right to being  a \"work and play\" gadget.  But not everything is lost.  The Kindle Fire HD has a nice feature that allows you to both listen to and at the same time read an audio book.Though I still depend on my Kindle Paperwhite (or my beloved Kindle Touch) for some specific consultation functions, I have found the Kindle Fire HD to be a superior mobile device for enjoying almost everything that Amazon provides in the way of consumer content.  Even por those consultative functions that are still only available on other Kindle readers, I can still rely on the Silk engine and, a bit less efficiently, connect to Wikipedia or to other online sites and get my questions resolved. Since mine is a 4G-capable device, the online option is always available (though expensive) anywhere, WiFi or no WiFi.Finally, I'd like to emphasize that, as a machine, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 4G is beautifully compact and streamlined.  Though larger than any other Kindle, it is still easily portable, and its more ample screen offers many advantages.  I have the magnetized cover, which allows you to sart the device or to put it to sleep by just opening or closing the lid, and this feature (also available for the Kindle Paperwhite) makes everything quick and easy.For the above reasons, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 4G deserves an unqualified thumbs up.  Get it and enjoy it!  By the way, I believe that the 64 gigabyte option is worth the extra $100 but that the Special Offers may prove distracting (so, I parted with $15 and had them removed).", "Title": "The Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" 4G Certainly Delivers And Some", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "RCJ5OIAZK4C5U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will start off by saying we have an iPad2 at home and have been iPhone users since day one, I was very skeptical about buying something not only Android but modified Android at that.

No Charger!!! I read this and knew it, considering I have 4 iPhone and 2 original Kindle chargers this was 100% a non-issue for me and anyone who reads the description would know this is the case.2.) No Flash! Sorry to inform but Flash is no longer supported on mobile devices as it is basically on its way out, you can't get mad at the Kindle because the sites you visit haven't been updated.3.) Ad's! The lock screen ad doesn't bother me at all, the much complained about recomendations can be turned off the in the software and are gone.Display:Fantastic! The screen is so crisp and great I love it!Operating System:I would prefer a more open version of Android but the Amazon OS has been very stable and quick with -0- issues since unboxing, is it 100% as smooth as the iPad-no it isn't but it is very close and for the price difference it is a non-issueContent:As always Amazon content is awesome, I have subscribed to a few magazines and they work great on the larger screen, I have not gotten Prime yet but plan to soon.Apps:I read alot fo complaints about the lack of apps, I found there were so many I didn't know what to get and I suspect as more and more Fires are sold more developers will port over existing games and apps.Summary:If you want an iPad, get an iPad-you aren't going to buy one for less than $300 and for less than $300 you aren't going to get 100% of the capability-I am sorry but that is how it is, if you need a device like I did for web surfing, reading, games and nothing really heavy or involved then get the Fire, I don't think anyone who knows going into it what they are buying can complain about it!", "Title": "Great Device For The Money!!", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Author": "R.

I went ahead and ordered the 32 GB Kindle Fire HD 8.9\". I was in sticker shock, of course, as it came out to a good $500 when I added Poetic KeyBook Bluetooth Keyboard Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9 Black (Support Auto Sleep/Wake Function)(3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic)and the warranty and a decal (for when it's not in the case).  But what the heck, you only live once, right?  I was extremely excited to receive it, and with the Amazon Prime Student 2 day shipping, it came in the mail exactly two days later.  The sleek black box contains the Kindle, a USB cord, and nothing else- but I'm a repeat Kindle customer, so I have plenty of micro USBs lying around the house.  The quality of the micro USB charger you use does seem to make a difference however, as some of my chargers didn't work at all (though they were working on other devices just fine), while others charged pretty decently.  I would say, after having my Kindle for a couple of days now, that it is worth it to purchase the rapid charger that Amazon offers you for $9.99 when you add the Kindle to your cart.Just a word of warning...a full charge lasts me quite awhile, but I like to charge it to 100% when I do charge it, and that takes FOREVER on a regular micro USB.  When I turned it on, I was pleasantly surprised to see how the carousel was already customized with some of my favorite books. The carousel can be easily changed to what you use, read, listen to, or watch the most often.  My carousel is a mix of the email shortcut, the Amazon Silk(that's Amazon's web browsing brand, for want of a better description) shortcut, which shows a pic of my last page visited, some game apps, and my favorite books.  The carousel is very responsive, and it changes functionality depending on whether you are in landscape or portrait mode. In landscape mode( my favorite mode) you see your carousel on a black background, and a row of options across the top that are shortcuts to music, video, books, apps, etc.  In the bottom right hand corner is the star button, which allows you to look up your favorites, though those might already be on your carousel.  In portrait mode, the carousel is obviously narrower, and across the bottom, for every item on your carousel, you see \"Customers Also Bought\" and a row of pictorial suggestions based on those selections.  I didn't notice this when I went to look at a display of the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" at my local Best Buy.  One of the reasons I was so eager to purchase the new Kindle Fires is that I'm rough on electronics; I have accidentally damaged three kindle keyboard editions by leaving them in bad spots, where the screens were pushed on (mostly by dogs on the couch) a tad too hard, rendering them useless. The gorilla glass of the Kindle Fire is nice and sturdy- though I am glad that I purchased the 2 year warranty, just in case.  Fingerprints/smudges can be rather annoying to look at when the kindle is off and all you see are your prints marring the pristine black of the screen.  But I don't often stare at my kindle when it's in standby mode, so I don't consider it a big deal whatsoever.  But I thought I would bring it up in case that does bother other people thinking about buying this.  I was SO surprised at how fast the downloads and web browsing and toggling are on this Kindle.  It's freaking WONDERFUL. You just don't get a grasp of how fast this device is when you are looking at it in a retail store.  I did have a one or two times when Silk wouldn't load at work, but it quickly resolved itself. No different from network issues on a computer, so it didn't phase me whatsoever.  I would definitely suggest that if you are someone buying this for school, to go to the pull down menu at the top of the kindle screen, click on the more button and then onto the device link. Add this devices personal email address to your email accounts, so that you can directly email the device documents from Microsoft Word. It might work with the whole Microsoft Suite, but so far I've only tried Word.  This way it shows up quick and easy in your documents, and its' SO easy to use.  Before I figured out how to use the documents, I kept having to go to the drafts folder in my yahoo email to look up the text I wanted to read.  I'm a full time college student, as well as working full time, and I needed a device that was powerful, easy to use, and that had some great browsing, organization, and research capabilities. With my Kindle Fire HD, I can read critical analyses, Wikipedia the author of the book I'm reading, add homework to my calender, and watch lectures online, all without taxing the device.  I would definitely suggest getting a Bluetooth keyboard, as the typing, while intuitive, doesn't really lend itself to getting notes down quickly.  I'm enrolled in a winter semester (mini-mester)class and I'm really looking forward to keeping updated on class assignments, reading textbooks, and using Evernote to load notes for use later, all from my Kindle Fire.  And with the 32 gb model, I'm confident that I won't run out of room anytime soon.  I am glad, after seeing how many books I have in my Cloud drive, that I got the 32gb model rather than the cheaper 16gb model.  I've had this for almost a week now, and I'm feeling really confident that I made the right choice.  If you've already invested in the Amazon universe, and you need a tablet for school, or work, or play, I would very highly recommend this device.  I'm not too impressed with Amazon Prime's selection of free movies, and I probably won't purchase the full edition of it unless the library grows rapidly in the next 6 months. But Netflix works pretty well on the Fire, as well as Hulu Plus, so I wouldn't say that Prime's light offering of movies/tv to stream is that much of a hardship.Sorry if this review is too long, but I tried to review this for the things I would want to know, personally.

Thanks to all the other reviewers for taking the time to help us all out.  I want to post a short review that may outline a few things others have missed or glossed over.A VERY sincere thank you to Amazon!  After years of back and forth between Amazon and various advocacy groups Amazon has surprised THIS user with a wonderful gift.  I did not expect it and frankly had heard that Amazon once again was going to forget about their visually challenged users.  Not  so!After years of waiting for Amazon..... they finally have accessibility options on the Fire.You can have voice over turned on with explore by touch.  FINALLY.  It also offers a voice guide and an orientation lock.For those of us with vision issues this is a BIG deal.  If I did not have the free accessibility programs that come free on every Apple device I would be lost.  I am heavily invested in the Amazon eco system and read often using the kindle for mac application and activate my voice over and listen to my books.  Conversely I am also heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem.  I chose Apple because of the totally free accessibility features.  If I used a PC I would have to buy a program that cost almost $700.00 just to do the same things I now do for free on my iMac.  No I am not saying apple is better....this is about accessibility for all people.  It is about preserving and protecting the rights of the millions of people who are different in some way than the so called normal person.I have both the 4G LTE 64gb and the WiFi only 32gb.As expected their is no real difference between the two.If you need more storage ,I do, and if you want to be able to do basic Internet activity while mobile ,I do, then the larger capacity 4G is a good choice.Setup on the ATT network was fast and easy.Out of the box the initial startup on both was very easy.  Once joined to my network it downloaded the latest OS and rebooted.The WiFi signal is in fact very good...or I should say the WiFi reception is very good.  I can travel from the front of my house to the far reaches of my backyard and still get a fair signal.  In the house the 5.0ghz signal is strong and consistent.The screen is magnificent.  The clarity and smooth operation are a real joy.  Sometimes if I have too many things happening with it..... i.e...... downloading an Audible book.... downloading some music.... and still attempting to use an app or read a book the device will have a little hiccup.  That however is very rare and easily managed by not trying to do everything at one time.My wife uses Medscape at the hospital and it looks great on the 8.9 screen.  It only took 15 minutes to download all of the required content for this app to work.I am amazed at how fast my content downloads over the WiFi.  I was able to add 30 audible books and 300+ books in a matter of a few hours.  The audible books took the longest.  I found that if I left my devices plugged in to ac and turned off the auto sleep function....my content downloaded a lot faster.If you are using the text to speech application you will be pleased to know it sounds great..... over the Dolby speakers.I also have found that if I turn the brightness down to a minimal level.... using Sepia mode with font at largest I can top light my Fire with mighty bright light to simulate a more Pearl Ink display.  I so this due to the extreme eye strain I suffer when looking at a bright light.......  I was amazed to find this works.  It might look a little strange but who cares!I mount my Fire on a Bookholder stand and use high powered glasses to be able to read the larger print on the Fire.  I do wish they made a couple of larger fonts... maybe later???So to sum it up.  Thanks to Amazon.  I truly thought you did not care about us.  I have been reading on blogs for months about how you would not do anything for special needs folks.  Now you have proved them to be wrong.UPDATE:  Using full accessibility options I have found the tablet easy to use.  The voice clearly tells me where I am on the screen. To open a book I move my finger over the menu to find the word book.  I hear it say book..... then I double click and the book opens.  To open the menu I use three finger swipe up to open and down to close.  Two fingers to change page.  Text to speech is at the bottom..and will open if I tap at the bottom of the screen.  I think I will try some bumps to see if they first will stick and second will not effect the display.  I have one good eye at 20/400 so I can use that to find a lot of things...but I want to know more..... could a totally blind person use bumps on a touch screen.  Will give it a try.  Wish I could get my hands on a few of the textbooks amazon is wanting to sell to schools....would like to see if they are accessible.When using Explore by Touch, use the following gestures to navigate:Unlock your KindleWith two fingers, swipe from right to left near the bottom of the screen.Open the Quick Settings menuWith two fingers, swipe down from the top of the screen.Scroll through items in the carousel and content libraries on the Home screenWith two fingers, swipe to the left or rightTurn pages in a bookWith two fingers, swipe to the left or rightDownload or open an itemDouble-tapMake menu selections onscreenDouble-tapThe Explore by touch also works with your music.  It will state where you are and also give you the artist...then the track name etc...IF you are blind or visually challenged like myself...and would like to discuss this NEW change please feel free to email me.

I also watched a few HD movie previews from flixter that looked and sounded spectacular.Ease of Use: I am very used to android-based items, so it was very easy to jump into. Even for an apple user, I think the transition would be pretty much instant. The people giving this product negative reviews because it doesn't include an instruction booklet really need to get with the times. If you can't figure this thing out in 15-20 minutes, you have no business with a tablet.Build Quality: Device feels very solid and high quality. My issue is the buttons and the placement of the buttons. They are very flat and somewhat difficult to find. There is a volume button, and a button to shut off the screen (which also shuts off the device when held down). There were many times where I wanted to turn something up, but accidentally turned it down or shut the screen off. Kind of annoying.Web Browsing/Typing: Web browsing is fun and very smooth with this device over Wi-Fi. Pages load quickly and video playback is instant without any buffering or image quality issues. I walked around the house playing YouTube videos and got pretty far away from my Wi-Fi router without any changes in video playback. If you are just looking for a device that is small and able to surf the net with ease, you will definitely enjoy this despite a few issues noted below:- No flash. I knew this ahead of time, but you do not get flash on this device in case you didnt know. I found this to be slightly annoying, but not too bad. A lot of flash-based websites will simply direct the tablet to the mobile version which makes a big difference for some websites while remaining mostly the same for others.- Typing is SLOW. It is a major pain to type something long like an amazon review. SWYPE is AWFUL on this device. This is the major, major flaw. There is no auto-capitalizing, and no auto-spacing. I figured I would be able to swype a paragraph rather quickly, but since you have to hit the space button every time you swype a word, it gets to be very annoying and time consuming. What is the point of swype when you have to stop and hit space every time? For a end of 2012 android device, I thought this was a major mistake by Amazon.Apps: By far the biggest issue with this tablet. App selection is awful, as are the quality of some of the most popular apps. Most people know that Amazon runs a modified version of Android and does not have access to the Google Play Store. I knew this when I purchased the item, but figured it wouldn't be THAT different. I was wrong. App selection is extremely small, and most of the apps are dumb things like chess or puzzle games (not very useful). Popular apps are less functional and seem hastily made for the Kindle Fire. Facebook is among the worst apps for this device. The layout isn't user-friendly, and it has less functionality than a typical Android Facebook App. If you are used to Facebook functionality on a computer or Android phone, you will be disappointed with Facebook on the Kindle Fire HD.Most of the functional and popular apps you probably have on you Android phone are not available for the Kindle either.Ultimately, this lack of apps made me decide not to keep the Kindle.Overall:If you just want to use the internet, watch videos with fantastic image quality/sound, and buy things from Amazon then this tablet will be an excellent choice for you at an excellent price. If you enjoy flash-based websites, full Android functionality, access to Google Playstore, or want a computer-like tablet experience then you will surely be disappointed. You can purchase movies, albums, and typical Amazon items very easily with this device. Amazon lets you have unlimited cloud-based storage for all of the media you purchase from them which is a nice feature. The Kindle Fire HD came off to me as a very smart way for Amazon to sell more merchandise rather than being a fully functional tablet.Pros: Display, Sound, Web-Surfing, Media-Consumption capabilitiesCons: No flash, no expandable storage (even though you do have unlimited cloud storage for Amazon purchases), typing is awful, small selection of available apps, some of the most popular apps are non-existent or poorly madeAfter returning this item, I am continuing my research into a new tablet and am beginning to lean toward the Nexus 10 for an extra $100.00", "Title": "Just wasn't impressed", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Author": "Dean H Ravin", "ReviewID": "R2U5JDL1TNTWZY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My  Kindle HD8.9  has  very short battery life, even in sleep mode it rapidly discharges it's battery.

Amazon refused to credit back the money for the movies my son purchased, and if I returned the merchandise I had to pay the shipping for the return. I also ordered a season pass for Teen Wolf II for my daughter, and it kept deleting off my account for almost 4 months, and I had to purchase the season through ITunes so my daughter could watch them as they released.

I call this review before and after because over time some of the features I loved have changed.Initially when I got the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" I was in love, the screen was beautiful, sound quality was amazing and it was so user intuitive. I'm a major media consumer so there was no other device for me. Movies looked gorgeous, books were crisp to read and songs sounded like I was in a concert hall. I could fill a medium sized conference room with my music. It also was light enough and the screen was large enough for me to study for hours on it. With a few simple apps I could review lecture notes and practice past paper questions. As another Christmas approaches I can't help but think back to where my device is coming from and compare that to where it is now.Now I still love my kindle, no other device allows me to share books and media with my family the way kindle does. They were all purchased by the same person so we can see what each person has read and share media on cloud. I just wish that the quality of the device had remained the same. My audio is inconsistent, the volume can audibly be heard to change in intensity without me adjusting the volume. In fact the device sounds muted overall compared to what it was initially. Every now and then the volume will chip in and sound as loud and clear as it once was but that happens infrequently. Another problem is that occasionally images remain on the screen even after I've switched to another page. This is particularly distressing because I end up with one image overlapping the other. I also can't predict when it is going to happen so for weeks I may enjoy good visual and then a couple days of overlapping images.I still rate this device as 4/5 because it has truly lived up to my expectations of it but the quality deteriorated. In fact as I typed this a spot on the screen that corresponded with the 'I' on the keypad became unresponsive for a few minutes. Go figure. If I wasnt such a lover of books I would probably rate this device lower...I honestly just wish my device would go back to working the way it used to and I don't have the money in my budget right now to get the HDX. Hope this review proves helpful and that Amazon will take note so this doesn't keep happening.-", "Title": "Before and After", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Author": "Snoopy1", "ReviewID": "R2HXFKQN2325XA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The decision to go with an Amazon Kindle Fire HD (8.9\") tablet versus an iPad or other tablet was admittedly heavily influenced by the amount of media that I had purchased from Amazon over time.  However, I still did my homework before I made the purchase including playing with both side by side for over an hour.  Since the iPad is the benchmark everyone seems to use, I will make some comparisons to that tablet.  First of all, the cost for a comparable tablet (I purchased a 32GB model) was considerably less for the Kindle Fire HD.  You only get the single camera with the Kindle Fire and the screen is smaller (8.9\" versus 9.7\" for the iPad) which wasn't a big factor for me.  What was a factor is that the Kindle Fire is lighter and a bit thinner, has dual Dolby speakers (compared to one for the iPad) and dual WiFi antennas.  The resolution on the new iPad is exceptional, but then again so is the Kindle Fire.  You need to compare them side by side to see if there is enough difference to justify the added cost of the iPad.  Battery life is advertised as about the same (11 hours for Kindle, 10 for iPad).  There are some minor design glitches on the Kindle Fire HD that have been covered in other reviews.  (1)The location of the power switch is not only hard to find, but you find yourself accidentally touching it frequently and turning off the tablet. I partially solved this problem by taking a silver marking pen and placing a dot next to where the power button is so that you don't have to turn the unit sideways to look for it and you can avoid it more easily with the dot marking the spot.  (2) the connection for the power cable is located at the bottom of the tablet (if you are holding the tablet horizontally).  If you are watching a movie and want to have the power cable connected, the plug rests on the surface which crimps the wire a bit and can't be good for the plug and wire.  I place two paperback books under the tablet at about the height of the plug which keeps it off the surface.  Obviously when you use the tablet on battery which is probably the majority of the time, this isn't an issue.  I have watched about 10 movies since I received my Kindle Fire and I must say that I am very impressed.  I have a high speed wireless internet connection (18 Mbs) and the movies are delivered without any pauses or jerky motions.  It is just like watching a movie on TV.  The sound is very good and the picture is truly HD quality.  Navigating around the Kindle Fire takes some practice.  The Help pages that Amazon provides are worth printing off for reference but still do not provide a full user's manual.  With time, I found that I liked how the screens were displayed and moving between the Amazon cloud and items loaded on the device a snap.  While it is not all totally intuitive, it doesn't take long to master the major steps to get through books, movies, etc.  Email was a little harder for me.  I have AT&T; (Uverse) email and there were some issues (for example not syncing contacts) that you won't face with something like gmail.  Finally, I saw a lot of comments on the case that is custom made for the Kindle Fire HD (about $54).  I didn't care whether it looked like leather or not.  I wanted something that had a custom fit look and protected my Kindle.  It does that.  The material it is made of looks more like a polycarbonate material and the cost is probably higher than it should be, but so far, I like it.  I have very little slippage problem when I stand it up on a hard surface.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone that isn't an Apple fanatic.  I was all prepared to consider the new iPad, but I just didn't see enough difference that mattered to me to justify the added cost, but then each of you has your idea of what features matter the most.", "Title": "Despite a few minor design flaws, the Kindle Fire HD is an exceptional tablet", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Author": "AnnS", "ReviewID": "R2GL8BMGQ6OE37", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third kindle and I am happier than ever!

I have used Ipads frequently, and have an Iphone so I'm used to the operating system so going that direction seemed the most logical however they are just so damned expensive.

I liked the idea of having both the front and rear camera as well as the ability to download videos for prime in order to watch them without wifi, but decided I would try this first and upgrade in the future if I thought it was neccesary.

If you do your research there are plenty of \"must have\" apps out there that let you get the most out of your kindle fire.  I would also highly reccommend that you have an Amazon Prime account, otherwise you won't be able to fully utilize this tablet.You have have read reviews complaining about the advertising, that had me somewhat skeptical to begin with, but the complainers neglect to mention the advertisements are only on the locked screen. Whenever you turn on the kinle you see an advertisement and an unlock Icon. Once you swipe into your home screen there are no more ads to worry about. To me this isn't a big deal, and occasionally the ads are very interesting, such as a book or movie that Amazon wants to reccommend.As far as screen clarity, I can't tell a difference between this an ANY of the Ipads I have used (I haven't used the newest Ipad air yet) and the resolution is crystal clear. The volume is impressive for a device this size, and its amazingly light weight. I was suprised by how little it weighed when i first picked it up. The battery is impressive, when they say it lasts ten hours they mean it. I watched 6 hours of a TV series from the netflix app over 2 days without charging it, and still had about 20% battery life left.If you are new to the world of tablets and aren't going to be a \"power user\" this should be more than enough for you, and at a price that is much better than most of the other's out there.

I have purchased 5 for myself and at least 6 for friends and family.  I like this product.  I also own two iPads and still think KINDLES are amazing.  With that said, after I purchased the Kindle listed above, I found I had some 'issues' that I didn't have with any of the others.1) The charging port (I am not terribly computer literate, so forgive me if I use the wrong terms...) is on the left side of the KINDLE.  It makes it difficult if you want to use the KINDLE while it's charging because you can't open the cover easily.  And, if it's closed when you start charging, you can't open the cover completely because it gets caught up on the cord.  The charging port is comfortably on the bottom of all my other KINDLES.2) The camera takes a picture facing you with no way to turn it out.  If I want to take a picture looking at something, I have to maneuver myself so that I'm twisted around looking at the screen so I can see if I'm taking the picture I want or simply aim and shoot and hope I get the picture I want.  The pictures are beautiful.  The configuration to take a picture, no so great.  I use my iPad to take tablet pictures.3) The power button on the bottom of the Kindle is narrow and close to the body of the KINDLE so it's hard to press and I'm never sure if I pressed it correctly.  (This is unlike the other KINDLES that have a nice little round button that you can feel comfortably and can tell when you press it.)  Unfortunately I have spent too much time pressing, waiting, pressing, waiting, pressing, waiting until the screen lights up.  I like the little easy to feel, easy to press buttons.  I also have some nerve damage in my fingers which make turning on the KINDLE a little more difficult.4)  The 4G LTE 'function'???  I thought this would make it possible to pick up the internet in locations where you can't get Wi-Fi, like you can get cell phones.  So far, not so much.  I've been disappointed.  I can see the bars (or icon) lit up indicating I have the 4G LTE service available, I think, but can't get the internet or anything else that I can't get on any of the other KINDLES.  Also, I'm paying a monthly fee for the service and don't think I'm getting my money's worth.  I probably won't continue this service when my current contract expires.  Note:  I am virtually ignorant regarding the 4G LTE world so I may simply not understand what it is, what it does and how to use it.  I'll give you that, so this comment may simply be exposing my ignorance.  But that's okay.  I'm fairly certain there are others of us out there who don't understand this stuff.  \"Hi to you all!\"I believe those are my 'issues'.  I am still sold on the KINDLE products and have continued to buy KINDLES for friends since I purchased this one.  I will continue to be an exuberant customer and talk up the product to everyone, but, the most expensive, fanciest one turns out to be the one I like least.Still, BUY A KINDLE, THEY'RE THE BEST!!!  You can't get a better quality or cost efficient product of this type anywhere.  Oh yeah, and your customer service is the GREATEST.  You can actually understand the folks who man your phones.  Yea!Happy KINDLE Shopping.  I don't think you can go wrong with the whole line of KINDLE PRODUCTS.

It would not download ANYTHING and constantly would start with the \"orange circle\" during videos - it was 12 times in the first two minutes of a show I had DOWNLOADED.  So, Amazon is okay, we will replace.#3 - this was GROSS.  The screen was so FILTHY and GREASY that I had to clean it three times to get it even to an acceptable point.

Then the color of the screen was a very dull BROWN (and no, I'm not color blind), the software update was really out of date and it would not allow me to update it.  Plus, there were features MISSING on #3 - and of course, it again didn't download.  So, Amazon is okay, we will replace with a \"new one that will be perfect\" - it arrived today.#4 - software is out of date but I have since learned how to do that myself.

I waited over a week to do this review because I didn't want it to be compromised due to my overall excitement. I was tied between a kindle fire HD and an iPad mini. After doing some research and making my pro/con list, kindle won due to its affordable price, I even got the 32GB. I am a huge fan of amazon and already own a kindle keyboard. Not really a fan of apple, the only apple product I own is an iPod touch that I got over 4 years ago.The display of the kindle fire HD is AH-MAZING. I was blown away at the crisp display. It makes everything look good, even the font! I find myself watching movies/shows on it rather than my 46 inch screen TV because I am just mesmerized by the display. There are plenty of apps. Since I don't own many apple products I don't have anything else to compare the apps too, but I am satisfied with what is given. Reading on the kindle fire is amazing as well, I am an avid reader so this is a huge plus. Upgrading from the kindle keyboard to the fire's back light did take some adjusting but after a day or two of reading I was comfortable with it. It has pretty cool features too such as seeing how much of the book is left displayed on the bottom of the screen and it also states up many more minutes till the next chapter! As well as some other new kinks. The speakers are nice and clear, although I wish they were a bit louder, I understand it's not suppose to be a stereo but slighter volume would of been a plus. The web experience is very nice, but it does lack flash. I heard there is a way around that, but it doesn't bother me (yet). Since I got the kindle (about 8 days ago) the web page crashed only once and that's because I had a lot of things going on at once (7+ pages open + pandora)...They don't include a charger in the package which I think was a HUGE mistake on amazons part. The Amazon Kindle Power Fast adapter is a NECESSITY unless you want to wait 16+ hours to get your kindle charged. I used my other kindle adapter and only had it changed at 50% after 9 hours and drained to 15% after two hours of use. The very next day I went and got this charger, now it takes 6-7 hours for a full charge and the charge can last an entire day to two days depending on what you are using the kindle for.Since I got the kindle fire HD I also signed up for amazon prime to get the full experience. There are plenty of free shows and movies to watch!

I use it as my portable computer.  I take it with me into the kitchen and I can listen or watch various webinars or other programs I subscribe to. I hook it up to a speaker system in order to hear it better, although the speakers in the Kindle are much better than the ones in my Kindle Fire.I use it to check my email, and I can also easily respond to my email because I bought the Belkin Keyboard and Case, so it's much easier to type on it than with the virtual keyboard.One thing I DON'T like is that it isn't designed to be able to use Flash, and I use that a lot to access the videos in the webinars.  I was finally able to access Flash using a work-around. I had to go to YouTube to find out how!  I ended up downloading Dolphin as my browser so I could download Flash. I now have it and it works great, but it sure seems like it should have been integrated into the Kindle from the beginning.I love the portability of the Kindle, especially since I use it as a computer much of the time.I also love that this model includes the text to voice feature, so I can have my books read to me while I'm working in the kitchen or driving.It's easy to use, and easy to get around. I find it quite intuitive.  I wish there were better instructions that came with it, but I was able to download a Kindle book of instructions for a small price -- about $2.99 I think.

To me it's like buying a record player that will only play one label's records. Here's why Amazon won me over:- I can sideload apps. Barnes and Noble forced my switch from a Nook Tablet to the Kindle Fire when they updated their device to block sideloaded apps. I hate being chained against my will to a company's logo, and being told what I can do with my own tablet. If you've invested in a library for the Nook, you can read those books on your Fire via the Nook app. Most other apps I've tried that for whatever reason are not in the Amazon app store seem to run fine.- I can sideload legally purchased content I ripped/stripped myself, and it's easy. If you're up for learning how, you can find a way to get all your existing content onto the Fire, with covers that show on your shelf, etc.- Amazon is simply the best online bookstore. If you have Prime, with all the accompanying perks, you'll be very happy with Amazon's content on other fronts. And with free shipping you can save a lot of money on ordinary purchases.- The performance of the Kindle Fire hardware is excellent.

I wanted to get her a tablet that had a great HD screen, was easy to use and wasn\u2019t too expensive. My mom is not tech savvy so I thought getting her a higher-end more competitive tablet (ipad, surface, etc.) would be a waste because she wouldn\u2019t use it to its potential.She absolutely loves it!!! I spent time setting it up and helped her understand how to use it. This does not come with a paper manual, but it has a quick tutorial when you start it up and there is a manual on the tablet if you need one to use.`The Short Answer:Yes, I would recommend this tablet to someone who is:a.New to tabletsb.Someone who is not tech savvyc.Someone who wants an excellent eReaderd.Someone who casually uses computers and would like to have a tabletDon\u2019t get this tablet if you must have the latest and greatest in apps (the app store is limited & no Google play store) or you want an android tablet that you can customize to your own preference.I would also let someone know while recommending this tablet that it does NOT come with the wall charger only the USB chord to connect to a computer to charge and the charging time can be a long time. But if you want to wait and see if you must have it or need it I have seen them for sale at the big box stores that sell kindles (I saw it for sure at office depot and at best buy), so if you don\u2019t get it, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to get it should you decide it\u2019s something you need.Also, it comes with ads that show on it and you can remove them for an extra $15 either at the point of sale or later. Since this was a gift, I left the ads on there (as I understand some people don\u2019t mind them while others are very against them) but I did include an amazon gift card so if my mom wanted to remove them she wouldn\u2019t have to spend her own money.How I decided on this tablet:I did some research online \u2013 the biggest selling point was the screen. I figured that my mom would use it more to read books and watch movies & TV shows, she may play some games from the app store but nothing too complex.The next thing I did was go and find one to try out at a major box store. I watched some movie trailers and played some games, went through the demo, read some paragraphs got on the internet and it was wonderful for what it would be used for. I wanted to get a good idea of how it would function and run so that when my Mom got hers and we fired it up I would know if it was working fine or not.I cannot stress \u201ctry it before you buy it\u201d enough.  If you aren\u2019t sure or do not have any experience with tablets go to the store and try them out!

Not so sure we will make it that long, so here goes.When everything works properly I love this pad. Just the right size, great sound and good color.Battery life is OK some of the time but can be inconsistent. That is the first problem. I have gone to bed without charging, as I thought there was plenty of power left, just to wake up to a dead unit. Charges pretty quick, but I like to be able to use it first thing when I get up.The second major problem is the browser. It constantly tells me tabs are not responding and offers to restart them. Most of the time there appears to be no problem with what I am viewing, but the notification pops right up in the middle of the page blocking what I am reading. Sometimes this will happen several times while attempting to read a single paragraph of text.Finally the pad will sometimes just freeze. This mostly again seems to be related to Silk when using the browser directly or when redirected by some apps. Keep in mind also that there are limited apps available and many do not seem well developed to work with the Kindle Fire or it's browser.In the last month or so all of these problems seem to be getting worse so that is why I thought it wise to review at this time. We still have some good days but the devices performance is just too inconsistent to warrant more than 2 stars.Update 7/31/13After writing my review I was contacted by Amazon customer service. They had some suggestions and talked me through them. They said they would call back in a few days. They never called back. What they had me do wiped all my data from Silk. Their suggestion to turn the device off to save battery just makes the pad less convenient to pick up and use and has done nothing to improve battery drain in use or efficiency in charging. The final problem has been that frequently when using Silk the pad will just reboot.Now the good news. Did a little online research and found that some Google apps can be side loaded. I now have Google Chrome for my browser and the Maps app. I'm not a big fan of Chrome but it does sync with Chrome on my PC and android phone. The pad no longer reboots for no reason. Still get an occasional freeze but rarely.I would consider adding a star if I had not been required to fix all this myself. Also the battery problem has not improved much. I am trying the new battery saver app for Kindle but so far I don't think it's doing much. I'm also using the new Mobile Desktop app and love it. You still have to go through the carousel to get to it but from there it's great.If this thing makes it to a year I might add a star yet.

I came into it knowing about the issues that most people write/complain about (charger, flash etc)-ScreenThe screen is all its cracked up to be. Colors are vibrant, text is crisp. Viewing web pages is a pleasure, as it watching videos or reading books.-SoundThe Sound is fine. No one will mistake your KF for a home theater system but it sounds fine and really, what else can you expect from a tablet.-DesignYes, the button placement could be better. The tablet was clearly geared to be held landscape because the buttons are on the short side, with the micro-USB on the long side. I would suggest putting the volume and power on different sides on the next generation and making them slightly bigger. That being said I can still work all of the functions with ease. As stated above the screen is excellent and the processor seems good enough.-InterfaceAs anyone who reads this should know, KF runs a customized Android (ICS) interface. I'm not too fond of the carousel but I can make it work. It would have been nice for Amazon to give us more options for the layout (ie no carousel, change the layout of the tabs or drop some).-AppsNo there is no google store. It's no surprise, Amazon makes no money on the hardware, so they need to be the one selling you apps. It doesn't have all the android apps that I want yet. I suspect it will eventually. To me, this feels like early android in that regard. I have side-loaded Dolphin, Flash and Youtube. I highly recommend the Dolphin browser. If you don't like Silk, google how to get Dolphin-Web browsingPages are rendered quickly and easily on Dolphin. I have reasonably fast internet and have seen no real difference between page loading on my laptop vs KFHD-TypingTyping by and large works fine. It is certainly not a physical keyboard but its a lot easier than typing on my android phone.-Overall-This is a solid 4 star tablet. If Amazon works on increasing available apps and working out the bugs I could give it an extra .25 star. Ditto for more customization. But in the last 2 weeks I can count on one hand the number of times I took out my laptop. That should tell you how well the KF is working out for me.BTW I would *not* pay to remove ads. The ones that appear on your homescreen, you can remove for free in settings.

Well, this review isn't one of those.I never thought I would say this...as I really have tried so hard to avoid being one of \"those people,\" but after using the Kindle Fire, it's safe to say, yes, I am an Apple person.Right now I am using the iPhone 5, and the Kindle HD 8.9, and there is just no comparison when it comes to the quality. The following is a brief bullet pointed list of problems I have with the Kindle, that I do not have on the iPhone:- The glare. Oh god, the glare!!! Isn't this device advertised as being better than the iPad when it comes to glare? I don't see how that can be possible, because looking at this screen is like looking in the mirror. That is how reflective it is. And if you should want to watch a movie or tv show that's primarily dark, well good luck, because you're basically going to be staring at yourself for the next hour or two. IT IS TERRIBLE!- Startup. Start up is sloooooooow. I mean, this thing takes minutes to start up. And even then, once it's actually started, it's gonna take another few minutes to wait in order to pull up any of the apps, otherwise they will just freeze and/or crash. Best thing to do when you want to use it is press the start key, and then walk away and come back in another 15 minutes. Then you should finally be good to go.- App availability. It's really unfair to yourself to ever purchase and Apple product and then get a device that is going to use an android app, because let's face it - we all know there are a million more apps for Apple. That said, I thought there would still be a decent enough amount of apps to choose from on the Kindle, being that Amazon owns the other half of our world. Nope. Not even close. I looked up the apps I have on my Apple, and only was able to find about 1/8 of them. Let me repeat - about 1/8. That is unreal, and frankly, unacceptable. The entire device is built around apps, therefore one would expect there to be a decent amount.- App functionality. The few apps I have been able to find and download regularly freeze and crash, and are generally much slower than Apple apps to start up. Some of them were in fact so unreliable that I ended up just deleting them.- Customizable options. Ummm, yeah...there aren't any. At all. Being somewhat tech savvy, I enjoy the ability to greatly customize my devices. I choose different backgrounds, different start up screens, password protect my devices, etc. That I have found, you can do NONE of that on the Kindle. You're basically stuck with that glaring black background, and that stupid \"carousel\" app display.- Sound. The sound stinks as well. If you want to watch or listen to anything, just plan on having to turn the volume up all the way. And that's in a quiet, child-free household. If you have children or a loud house, just plan on not being able to hear it at all.- Buttons. If you can find the buttons, good luck pressing the right one. Half the time I press the shut down button trying to press the volume because they put all three of them right in a row.

I had read dozens of user reviews in advance and really, really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, probably because I was not yet familiar enough with it, relying on it caused me to miss a crucial email and a long-awaited meeting. This one was my bad, not Kindle's.Back home, I started using it more and found it difficult or impossible to access the online versions of my mail subscriptions. A magazine sample downloaded from Amazon Kindle site froze at 48% and did not let me advance. First star lost. Accessing my Gmail account was still cumbersome -- second star lost. For me, it was best for reading books: the vertical page size is about the same as a paper book's, and an off-white background selection is easy on the eyes.Now comes the function that dropped the third star: it goes dead frequently and is a hassle to revive. The first time it happened, the user guide was useless and online instructions did not work. I had to contact Kindle Help who walked me through it on two calls, one hour apart. The second time around, I followed the steps that Kindle Help had shown me. Again, it took an hour to revive it. Too labor intensive for me! I want something that comes to life when I plug it in to recharge it. Preferably something with a clear on-off button and a power indicator like my laptop and my phone.Kindle Fire may be an excellent tablet for most users, just not for me. I need something that makes it easy to read my newspaper and magazine subscriptions and access email. It also has to be available when I need it without an hour-long multi-step revival process. I guess I have been spoiled by the ease of using and recharging cellular phones and laptops. After eight months of intermittent use and comparing notes with savvy friends, I have concluded that an up-to-date smartphone and a 13-inch notebook will bridge all my needs, and I no longer even need a tablet.

Kindles are proof of how computers are becoming a thing of the past. For example, desktops were replaced by laptops in terms of popularity because laptops are smaller and more portable.

The Kindle is easy to use with options for everything on the home screen.

I can hardly stand watching youtube or other streaming vids from the internet because the picture quality is grainy and blocky (?). And that is with using high speed wifi internet in my house!

However, when the Kindle Fire (with the backlit feature) came out, I thought I'd give it a try.  I've now purchased several... for myself, my kids, and my parents.  IKindle Fire in general:  It's so nice to be able to read in bed with the lights out, buy a book at 10 pm, and not have stacks of books sitting around cluttering up my shelf.  I love listening to the music as I lay in bed with my preschooler.  And it's just handy to have everything.... games, apps, books, music, etc. in one place.Kindle Fire HD 8.9:  This is the best one yet!  I didn't think I would like the bigger size, but I do.  And it's got numerous additional features over the Kindle Fire... including easier online access and my favorite, Kindle Free Time for my preschooler, which allows you to set limits on videos, apps, and general play and provides a ton of content for my 4 year old in a controlled environment.

I switched to the Kindle Fire 8.9 HD because of the way magazines and newspapers are formatted (i.e. clear index and perfect reading layout of each article), the ease of emailing in PDFs and then reading them in Kindle or the Adobe App (where they automatically show up), and the ability to easily hold the 8.9 in one hand without a case.  If you have a laptop and an iPhone as I do, the new Kindle 8.9 is a perfect in between for users who read a lot.  And if you want some tunes while you are reading, Amazon's music product is pretty good (not to mention plenty of storage options for those who want some movies or TV handy for plane rides).Since I plan on sticking with the Kindle 8.9 platform for a long time, I do look forward to a few improvements on version 2.0.  First, I think the processor is a touch slow, especially using the Silk browser - version 2.0 should make Silk feel \"quick\".  Second, I wish Amazon had MOG quality downloads available for music (or even the MOG app available).  Over time, Amazon certainly wants to be a leading seller of music/streaming and, after listening to hi-quality MOG or Apple Lossless, the Kindle 8.9 tunes sound a bit lame.  Lastly, while I love the Kindle reading products, there is less you can do with an article than on iPad - Kindle needs more tools to forward, post, copy, and highlight.  Sure some of these are available for some products (like highlighting in Kindle books, for example) but the Newsstand offers almost nothing (you can't even save articles anywhere).So it's a great reading device - great enough to make me swap out an iPad Retina - but it's my guess/hope that v 2.0 will be the ultimate (for me anyway).", "Title": "Great tablet for readers", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Author": "Barbara J.

The built quality looks and feels good and the device has a nice rubberized back that feels good in the hand. The user interface and functionality of the Kindle uses an Amazon software overlay, but the user experience feels very android-like once apps are installed.I noticed that PDF's and PPT files lag a little on the device. Sometimes I have to touch the screen multiple times to get the home button to appear in order to exit the PDF viewing program. Most other apps have run well with little hiccups.My only true complaint is that my screen has dead pixels. For most people a dead pixel is unnoticeable, but it is annoying for users who view a lot of PDF's or read books with a white background. I constantly find myself wiping the screen trying to get rid of speck. I called Amazon and was sent a replacement Kindle which also contained a dead pixel, this time in the center of the screen. Most companies allow a certain number of LCD display defects to pass through inspection since LCD's are an expensive component to replace. With the Kindle priced so attractively I understand that quality control would be set with tolerances that allowed for small variations that most consumers wouldn't notice or be concerned with.In short, I like the device. I think it's great addition to add to the Amazon ecosystem, especially if you purchase a lot of content through Amazon. I like the price point. Is the Kindle as good as an Ipad? Most would say no. Is it more than half as good as an Ipad? Certainly. And considering the price point it is a much better value.Are the components for the Kindle sourced cheaply? Probably- most device components are. Will this result in dead pixels on your Kindle screen? So far for me it has.I will call Amazon today and see what my options are. If I can't get a device I am happy with then I will return.

You won't go wrong with any tablets that these companies offer, they're all wonderful devices. That said, I would have preferred a Nexus 10, but for a college student's budget, the kindle fire was an easy choice.If there is anything that the Fire falls short in, it would be the app selection. I mean, nothing really critical is missing (except for YouTube seriously Amazon get a proper YouTube app already) so it isn't really detrimental, but there are a few apps I wish Amazon offered.Other than that, everything works flawlessly. As a previous reviewer stated, the position of the micro usb port is a major pain, but little I can do about it. Books, movies, music, apps, games; the Fire can do anything the iPad can, despite what the rabid fanatics tell you.The true power user will probably want to invest in a Nexus, but for the money, this is a great media consumption device. I wasn't looking to replace my brand new laptop anyway. I can manage my emails, check mission critical websites, and get most of my day to day activities done fine on my Fire. It's my best morning coffee buddy.Also no, it does not come with a charger, but I knew that beforehand because I read. That college education sure comes in handy, don't it. If you do not do your research, do not whine to all in sundry about information widely and readily available. Also they aren't expensive and are sold at many brick and mortar stores.Well that wraps up what I have to say about my favorite toy. Take it for what it's worth to you, and happy surfing.", "Title": "Why the kindle fire is my tablet of choice", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Author": "Adore Yourself", "ReviewID": "R3KUWJ0VJGRVYM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I actually got tears in my eyes today at the amazing beauty of my Kindle. It truly is amazing. I have Amazon Prime and was sick in bed today and it was a sheet joy to have the Kindle to help me get through the day in bed. I was stunned at how simple and easy streaming shows was on the Kindle, I watched episodes of NOVA today seamlessly. I also am impressed with the sound and picture quality. It did not feel like I was using a small device at all. I love how the cloud makes it easy to get my books from my old Kindle and music I bought in the past into the new one. I think the Prime idea with the streaming content is going to get bigger and bigger, perhaps even upending the entire cable tv market and Netflix. I cancelled Netflix this week due to the Amazon Prime offerings...on the whole, this device is wildly impressive. A large clear HD screen, pretty high quality sound, and great amounts of content, from apps to music to tv shows to books...this is an entertainment system that fits into your hand!! Also, this week I used the camera at Malibu and the quality is amazing! The yellow on the flowers on the hills was stunning both in person and on the pictures I took with my Kindle. I was able to easily transfer the pictures to my laptop and was also able to email some of the pictures to a friend without any problem from my Kindle too. I never listen to music on my ipod anymore and listen to it on my Kindle. I also no longer play Solitaire on my iPod and play it on my Kindle instead. I am liking a lot of the applications for Kindle too, ranging from turning the screen into a playable keyboard to showing a map of the night's sky. So far, I am thoroughly pleased and even impressed, with my new Kindle. I like the touch screen, that is nice and most of the navigation of the Kindle is pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it.On the downside, I did not like and felt it was manipulative to make it so only music bought on Amazon could be easily put onto the Kindle, and that I had to download a special uploader which seems to have problems as well, giving a notice with every upload that it may not work...but was able, with some hassle, to get music from my computer onto the Kindle, but it should have been as easy as moving the files from the laptop to the Kindle but it was not. (You are supposed to be able to transfer the files easily but I was not able to get that to happen.) There was this weird third step of having to download their special app then having to upload your music from laptop to the loader then back to the Kindle. I would like to encourage to not be like Apple...I still, 3 years into owning my iPod, cannot figure out how to get music onto my iPod!! And it pisses me off. Still, the Kindle made it easier to get music onto my Kindle than iPod music uploads have been.The biggest complaint I have re this Kindle is the Silk browser is unstable and I really cannot use this Kindle for much in the way of web use. I can look at static pages, without interactivity. But almost none of the things I need to do can be done online using the Kindle. It seems to not allow you to look at pdfs and even tho I downloaded an app from Adobe to read pdfs they still are not being read...I do a lot of research on ProQuest for instance, and I cannot see any of the articles using the Silk browser. Additionally, it does not seem to work with Flash!! I cannot play any games on Lumosity, for instance, on the Kindle due to some kind of Flash issue and when I tried to find an app to fix this, I could not find it. With no ability to see pdfs or Flash websites, or no way that is obvious to me (and I am in a graduate level tech/design degree program, so I am no idiot when it comes to tech), it severely limits the utility of this device as it applies to the web. Also, the Silk browser freezes up constantly. It needs to be improved. I would have preferred a more stable browser such as Firefox. Almost every time I go online to any site other than Amazon's stores, it freezes and when I do get to websites, they are very limited when the pdfs and flash do not work. It is also unclear whether we are charged money to transfer documents to this Kindle. I believe on my old Kindle they charged us if we sent documents to ourselves. I am unclear if I send documents to the email address of my Kindle HD if I pay for each upload and I wish they would make that clear somewhere. On the whole, though, I am wildly impressed with this Kindle. I really beg Amazon to avoid the pitfall of Apple of making things only work within the itunes store for the ipod making it nearly impossible to upload anything else to the device. I do not like the additional steps to upload my own music onto the Kindle and hope Amazon moves away from that type of thinking on its devices. I hate Apple and avoid their products due to the way they make them so incompatible with everything else. I resent it. I hope Amazon realizes this device has so much utility, enough for them to not have to play games re content. Let us upload our own content plus things we bought at Amazon, with equal ease.I highly recommend this device. It has enhanced my entire life for a month now. It has become my #1 music, movie, game center and favorite camera to boot! Not to mention my primary reading source. Great screen! Great sound! Great utility!

Overall, the experience has been good.  When I first received it, the silk browser would not load.  It kept saying that there was a fatal flaw and that the browser needed to be restarted.  The only problem is that every time I restarted it, it gave me the same error.  This is detrimental to the kindle overall, but it is not a problem for me.  I simply side-loaded Dolphin (my preferred mobile browser) onto my kindle.  As a lover of the original kindle fire, I was pleased with the changes I found on the new HD.> The sound, for a tablet, is outstanding.  True, it is not booming, but it is true stereo sound which is pretty impressive for a tablet.> The HD is beautiful, but that was not the greatest selling point of the screen for me.  With my first generation kindle fire, going outside was out unless I could find a shady spot or if it was really cloudy.  I *LOVE* the anti-glare screen incorporated into the new HD.  I can sit outside in direct sunlight and still see my screen.  This is a great thing!>The \"ads\" that show up on the lock screen are no big deal.  I just do not pay them any mind when I turn my kindle on.  I do have to say that, even though a lot of people seem to complain about the recommendations offered on the home screen, I actually find myself scrolling through them.  They show you games/apps/books that you may like based on the app/book that is front and center on the home screen.  I do not worry about my kids or myself accidentally purchasing, that is what my password lock is for.>My favorite pre-installed app on this new device is Freetime.  I wish that I could download it on my first generation (I have two kids).  For $3 a month my kids have unlimited access to children's videos, games, apps, and books!  The videos need a wifi connection, but once they access/download an app or book onto the device it is there in the freetime app.  This was a great little discovery when I was stuck at the doctor's office with my toddler a few days ago.  There are literally HUNDREDS of choices for them.>I also really appreciate the fact that I am no longer allocated a miniscule amount of space for apps.  My kindle comes with 13 Gb's of free space, and if I want to allocate all 13 gigs to apps and games, that is my prerogative. It drove me nuts that I was only allowed 1.17 gigs of space out of 6.5 gigs of free space for apps on my first generation.>I **DO NOT** like the placement of the USB port for charging.  The reason is that I like to say in bed and watch movies while going to sleep at night.  I can not use the case to prop the kindle up in landscape mode and charge the kindle at the same time.  I like the placement of the USB port on the first generation much better.  This one little thorn in my side is the main reason that I am only giving this product four stars.>I played with the camera a little bit.  I was not really impressed with it.  I do like how it uses the screen as a flash, but the pictures always seem to come out grainy.  I thought that it was supposed to be an HD camera.  Hey, and how about a video camera option??

I have just received my Kindle Fire 8.9\" HD (without 4G) a couple hours ago!  I work in the IT and Data Management fields, love electronics and many devices.  I will be able to honestly and thoroughly review this product for those of you out there still looking to buy one or be informed.Packaging -  The packaging used to hold my Kindle Fire was typical Amazon style.  It came in it's own 'Kindle' box with the manifest attached.  While I worry about this, I can say my device is without defect and it seems their box is more protective than it seems.  I also must say I like that they use recycled material that is also further recyclable... very 'green' of them and it's appreciated from a passive standpoint.Directions -  I must say this is splitting hairs a little... but I am dissappointed that they don't provide at least some basic instructions as to whether you can start charging it right out of the box or not.  I assume that the battery needs to be fully charged and then fully used until it dies and then fully charged again to charge all possible cells thoroughly?  I know some phones were like this, and still are in some cases with other devices too.  Right now I'm trying to charge it and then after that I will see what the battery life is initially and report it, and then charge fully after death and then see what it is after a complete recharge and report it too :)Accessories -  I don't know if most people order accessories right off the bat or not, but I made sure to buy a good screen protector and leather folio/bluetooth keyboard case for mine.  I recommend Tech Armor's Lifetime warrantied HD screen protectors.  Since the Kindle Fire HD already has anti glare built into it's glass, no need for matte types of screen protectors.  Matte types take away from the crispness of the HD screen anyways.  I also recommend MoKo's Bluetooth Keyboard Case... it is of great quality, and after tons of research of the other brands, this one had the reviews that made me feel safest with the stitching, compatibleness with ALL of the function buttons, and charging time and more.  Other than that, it's up to you... but I'd say these two are a must!  Check them out!Feel and Initial Reactions -  This device is heavier than I expected, but that is no complaint!  It feels natural, almost like it is in that sweet spot for a device to not be too heavy and not too light.  I was actually worried of dropping it because it's not as grippy as one would think or expect either, and I didn't want to touch the screen until my protector was on it either!  It is just the right size though, and fits in your hand well.  It's very thin, cool to the touch, and it's display is absolutely marvelous!  The colors are deep and sharp, but not too bright.  THe brightness is sensitive I will say, with half way down being almost unreadable in any indoor lighting.  I am making use of the auto brightness to help save battery while keeping proper reading brightness readily set.  It's also responsive, easy to use.  The on screen keyboard and feel to manipulate the OS takes a few seconds to get used to, but that's to be expected as I have only iphones in my house, and the first generation Kindle Fire which is sluggish and drull compared to this one.  The advertisements aren't that bad... honestly, who cares?  I'm sure there's an easy way my IT mind could find to take those out, but I did save money with them being there so I'll prolly leave them there for now.Features -  With everything making an attempt to be separate, but all be synced together at the same time... it's no surprise to see Facebook and Twitter instantly be found on this device upon setup.  Especially since I have both accounts and have shared items on the webpage with them (Amazon.com).  The dual WiFi antenna and dualbands make it really speedy compared to my iphone 4S's wifi speeds, and even here at work where our mobile network gets bogged down... it's almost expecting too much out of itself in regards to the warning I got that the network is slow and that I should update in the background upon setup (haha, it actually finished fast... it's too hard on itself!).Overall -  I am very pleased and I cannot wait to keep you all updated with my further review updates!  I love the service of Amazon.com, I love their products, and I love the features they offer with their devices.  I know I sound like a fanboy, but I am not often completely pleased like this (as I always find something that could be better)... and I assure you, I may just yet still find something on this tablet.

The screen is fantastic, clear and very crisp. I have even used Netflix and Amazon Prime to watch movies/videos, and the sound is very loud & clear. It has the surround sound effect. I LOVE to read, and when I read, it feels like a real book. The web browser and everything else moves very quick and easy, I haven't experienced a lag of any kind yet! Sure, It didn't come with instructions, but in this day in age, everything you need to know about anything, can be found online. It is very user friendly and initial set-up took about 5mins. I am a previous owner of a blackberry, an android smart phone, and now I have a iPhone 4s, and a Macbook Which I love! (This is my first KF, btw) True enough, it did not come with a wall charger, I was about to be charged $19.99 for the charger, until I called amazon and told them, about the promo I saw, and they immediately changed the price to $9.99. And my previous android charger, works just fine. So far so good! I have also bought a Malware Case, Screen Protector, 2-yr Protection plan and the wall charger. Which I all love, and haven't had any issues with. All together, with tax included I spent under $460 for everything. iPad is nice, I used one before, But I WILL NOT pay $200-$300 more for it. KF does/has the exact same thing, minus the two cameras, free engraving etc. I'm only giving it 4 stars, bc it doesn't have the Google Play store, I was fully aware that this device wouldn't be flash capable too.

I've had it for approximately one month and my husband is joking about how it is 'glued' to me.  Literally, I find it hard to part with it!  I have all my music at hand with Amazon's cloud, all my books, and can easily view almost any movie I wish by accessing my Netflix, HBO, or Amazon accounts.  How nice to have your whole digital library travel with you!Although I almost bought the smaller 7 inch, I'm glad I decided on this one.  It seems like the perfect compromise between the larger Ipad and the smaller tablets. Its more weighty, but I can appreciate the extra screen space and think I would have been frustrated with a smaller one.  Its nicely thin, its battery life is decent, and I've had no bugs surface yet. Getting used to the interface was very intuitive.  I do have 'Special Offers' version and don't find the ads to be a problem.I am amazed at the sound that comes from this little device-  especially pleased with the way Dolby digital can immerse you with  sound seeming to surround you.  The picture is also super-clear and I've had no problem connecting to WiFi and getting a decent signal.  Movies run great and smoothly.  As to Apps, I've found some great ones that are keeping me way too busy, and although the selection may not be as great as the Ipad has available, I'm sure the market will improve, increase, and blossom.The reason I went with the Kindle Fire HD was the good reviews its been getting and the attractive price... but Amazon's good customer service that I've enjoyed over the years definitely was a big deciding factor.  This Kindle has so far been problem-free, but I did have a small sound issue that was my fault in not understanding the controls fully.  In the Kindle's help files it gave me a choice to have Customer service call me to resolve my issue.  No sooner did I click on that then my home phone rang with a polite & helpful Amazon customer service representative asking if I needed help!  I didn't think I could be more of a fan of Amazon's customer service, but now I think I worship at their feet!!Areas that could improve on this Kindle (Nothing is ever perfect, mind you!):1) sometimes I find the 'touch' controls to be too sensitive when I am scrolling- especially albums in the music section.  Wish there was more of a border/neutral area to swipe so that I'm not constantly opening albums when I just want to do a gentle scroll.2) Shopping is way too easy...(I don't expect they would even want to change this, LOL)3) Sound and on/off button IS sometimes hard to access easily, although having a cover that turns it on/off is a plus...4) Wish it was lighter in weight (as I want to carry it everywhere)  It fits nicely in my pocketbook, but it IS a weight to carry around after a while.I rarely write reviews, but had to this time because I love this little device so!

I did not like the fact that being only roughly 4 yrs old Apple has decided not to support it anymore with ios updates. This will eventually make my apps worthless as some already were becoming because they required the newer ios.With that said, I decided to look into the Kindle Fire HD 32gb. What I discovered was that it did everything that I previously used my Ipad for. Sure the App store is more limited but the trade off for me anyway was getting a Prime membership so I could use the instant movies/TV shows, borrow a free book a month and upgraded shipping. I really like being able to stream shows while I ride my exercise bike and the Kindle does a fantastic job of that.The other consideration was the Kindle Fire HD has a way better price point. I just could not see spending so much money again for an Ipad that might one day in the near future not be supported again and become nothing but a paper weight.I'm impressed with the picture quality. Streaming works flawlessly. Apps work great. Speakers sound good and produce enough volume. Syncing your Kindle with new Apps or updates is easy and learning how to use it was simple and straight forward.Cons: Battery life seems short. I've improved it some by reducing the screen brightness. Charging is really slow. I am using a 5w charger. Maybe I'll give the 9w Amazon charger a try to see if that speeds it up a bit. 19.99 seems overpriced though.I do miss being able to customize my lock screen and other screens. Oh well, not really a big deal. I did not pay the 15.00 to remove the Ads. They really are not intrusive so I will save the money.Again, the App store being limited is a con. So you need to consider that and look over Amazon's App store to decide if you can live with that. I also think the App store needs more Apps that are made for Kindle Fire HD and not just Android phones. Hopefully it will continue to grow!Suggestion: If you are looking for a cover for your Kindle try the one Amazon makes. I just got mine and it is well made, slim and works well doing the auto on/off. You can also easily fold the cover back and it is still slim in your hands. For me, this was important because I read a lot of books and I did not want a bulky cover.Bottom line: I love my Kindle Fire HD 8.9!

My experience with the updated Silk is much better.  It hasn't crashed once and it seems considerably faster.  Since I purchased the Kindle a few months ago, I have gotten more familiar with the web interface, but it still isn't as intuitive to use as those on my Android phone  or iPod browser. I changed my rating from 2 to 3 stars based on the updated Silk software. I would probably give it 3 1/2 stars as I really enjoy the tablet, but I only use it for a few things.  I don't use it for emails or web browsing as much as I would like since it's not completely user friendly, but at least it doesn't crash anymore.My original review follows:I bought a certified Kindle HD 8.9 with expectations that I would be using it primarily for watching movies and TV shows.  I should preface my critique by admitting that I'm a huge Amazon fan (and stockholder), and take a neutral stance when it comes to product reviews.  With that, I feel the Kindle HD 8.9 is a very flawed product, especially with respect to its software and interface.I have pretty much given up using the Silk web browser, as it freezes continually. My ipod touch and android phone work more reliably than the Kindle for browsing.  Further, it seems  Silk is much more invasive when it comes to tracking activities, e.g., \"Individual Website Data\" settings are difficult to view and clear.  I certainly would avoid doing any financial transactions with Silk (note: I'm not a tech head, so perhaps others may find an easy work-around, but Silk just \"feels\" less secure than surfing on Chrome or Safari).The screen and sound are top-notch, and while Amazon over-hypes the quality of sound, it is clear and amplifies more than other tablets. Hi-fidelity it is not, but that's appropriate given the size of the device.  The screen isn't as vibrant as an Apple screen, but it is ample for viewing almost everything.  For photographers viewing pictures, note that the Kindle screen doesn't have a neutral white balance.  Pics are sharp and vibrant, but color accuracy is off a bit- biased slightly to a green hue (on min, at least).Books looks great, but the device is a bit heavy (especially with a cover) for hand holding for any length of time.I requested a return on the item after experiencing stunningly bad web surfing, but begrudgingly decided to keep it due to the relative positive book and movie viewing experience.  Early May, Amazon said their web developers were working on fixing the issues with their Silk browser in the \"next few weeks,\" but I haven't noticed any improvement as of 6/20/13.If I had a do-over, I think I would have chosen a Nexus, Samsung or Apple Mini, but given the reasonable refurbished price for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and its capable book and movie delivery, I'm semi-content for now.Last, the \"Ad\" version seems very user friendly - I don't find it annoying at all; in fact I hardly notice it, so I would delay spending an additional $15 to remove the ads when purchasing, and remove it later if you find it obtrusive.", "Title": "Great for books; okay for movies; browser improved but just okay", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Author": "SCRN soccer mom \"soccer mom\"", "ReviewID": "R39IJIGL6VJ0HA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally ordered a refurbished Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" wifi only and it was great but decided I really wanted to be able to use it anytime, anywhere.

We have a house at the beach and I take it there with me when we travel as it so much more convenient than dragging along my laptop.  I especially love to watch movies on it and the quality of both the picture and the sounds is amazing.  I actually have 2 Kindles...one of the older, smaller ones plus this new one so I can have one charging as I'm using the other one.The only complaints I have are for some of the buttons/functions.  I had a hard time seeing and finding the off/on button plus the volume button as they are recessed into the side of the Kindle plus being black the disappear for me.  I bought a case to use with my Kindle which makes it much easier to use as it turns on/off when I open and close the case plus the buttons are much easier to see on the case as it's a lighter color.I don't like the charge port being on the bottom of the unit as when I'm watching movies I like to keep it charging and the cord at the bottom gets in the way.

I received it as a gift. I used it occasionally. I knew someone more interested in it than I was. Yet, I was not willing to give it up until I looked into this HD 8.9\" model. I really liked what I saw. From the day it arrived, I have gone nowhere without it. It has become such an integral part of how I do things. It has been the tool I did not know I was looking for. It's like carrying a personal office manager, research library, on-the-go resource environs, all your leisure time beneficial stuff, an audio & visual entertainment center, and more. Bring your Microsoft Word and Excel work with you. For this, there is OfficeSuite Professional 7 and other apps. Let your Kindle become your \"note-catcher!\" Do even more with Evernote. What PDF files do you like to keep handy? \"Send-to-Kindle\" those articles, memos, and other snips that cross your desk each day to read later. No longer let them pile up on your desk. Be overwhelmed at how DejaOffice can synchronize and simplify your office, laptop, and home computer calendars, contacts, notes and tasks (I gave up working with Outlook.com). You too will love doing all you calendar work, etc. on Kindle. Do your email. Text! Let WeatherBug for Kindle Fire check the weather. Get your news. Watch the Markets. Organize your Spiritual Life. Carry meditations and other prayers, or services like iBreviary or subscribe to Divine Office - Liturgy of the Hours Audio & Text Catholic Christian Prayer. Read the Bible, it's easy and cheap: Bible: New American Bible, Revised Edition 2011 (never mind all the rest that you can read). Carry your scholarly resources. Enhance your office with the New Oxford American Dictionary. Read the Classics! Write! Read audiobooks. Carry plenty of them for trips. There's 32GB. Use Bluetooth to make use of this in your car, with your home stereo, your desktop, or with a great headset (my favorite, for years, has been the Plantronics Pulsar 590 Bluetooth Stereo Headset) -- you can even pair a full-size Bluetooth keyboard. Of course, there's the Web! And surprisingly, this is all done with WiFi and not a subscription to a 4G network. You can also have the convenience of having complete wireless access to your Kindle via WiFi File Explorer PRO.Surprisingly, this is what I have been doing with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Tablet in less than 4 weeks and it feels like I'm just getting started.

It is easy on the eyes and displays even color text and photos flawlessly.  However, beyond that, it is a disaster.The means of navigating through a given book is slow and inexact, causing significant delays and frustration in finding any particular location in a publication.  Further, the only options for listing the books on the Fire 8.9 are full color mini-covers of each book or a somewhat smaller 'list' format that displays the books in small horizontal bars with an image of the front cover and a text description of title and author.  In either case, it is necessary to physically scroll through the titles (which are arranged alphabetically) to find any specific book.Once a book has been located, navigating within the book is equally slow and frustrating.  One must basically use a tedious scrolling through each individual page by pulling a finger across the screen either from right to left or left to right dependent on which direction in the book one is moving.Further, there is no reasonable means of grouping books, as was available on the DX, either by category or author.  It is equally difficult to delete a book that one no longer wishes to maintain on the Fire 8.9.With some major revisions, this may one day be a superior electronic reader.

Amazon designed the Fire HD to confine you to their system and limited storage to encourage subscribing to Amazon Prime for the cloud . You learn quickly any content there is lost if your subscription to prime lapses  . If your not open to that you more then likely should just buy a smart phone from Google ,  Microsoft's  Shadow RT , or at least a non modified Android entry .To say the makers of devices do not get along is a understatement . Google and Apple does not recognize the existence of the Kindle so you can't purchase from their ap store as a kindle owner nor are their conversion programs to convert them to useable . You can get around many of the shortcomings of the Kindle fire except for the lack of applications for which their is little motivation to write . Myself I believe the 7 inch model is the best deal as it is 1/3rd or less the price and you can use text to speech on books or increase the font size of print to solve the smaller screen size . Being able to just carry it on your belt or in a purse is priceless the 8.9 inch tablet really needs a 10.2 laptop case . I bought the one from case logic for $13 roughly and it fits the keyboard from Amazon basics perfectly  .You cannot upgrade the devices memory so buy as much as you can afford . I am so upset at myself for buying the 16gb model . It didn't take long to fill the memory up once you put on antivirus , some pictures , and video is a real resource hog . So far I have not learned how to add a flash drive . If I find a workaround for that I would be much more satisfied as I could free myself from the cloud . It was a nice find to use the Dolphin Browser for flash and Calibre on a desktop to download and rewrite books in the kindle format AZW3 .I hadn't read a book in years having bad eyes and suffering from severe chronic pain yet I took to it right away with the kindle . I wanted to use this while traveling but I now find my banks do not have applications that work with the kindle so it is merely a reader and video player limited to wifi though with Dolphin I can use the internet and purchase at most stores. I passed on the 4g since I saw how restrictive ATT was with a throttled data plan as well as expensive . Nothing short of the Sprint unlimited  plan would be acceptable for use . Someday someone will have satellite service you can plug in through the USB and I can't wait . Would be a great space for Hughs , Dish or even Garmin to enter . Would be nice if you could use a remote tuner just to access news and weather when off grid but so far I have not found a hint anything exists for that .So this is a nice machine but very limited and more for those who want to watch video where wifi exists and read lots of content of which not all is available for the machine  . Plan on using a small laptop bag or purse and not hanging this from your neck , or belt . Get ready to come up with endless work around's to become independent and if you use your device daily you will more then likely need to charge it nitely .That brings up another concern which is having to dock it to the micro usb port which are prone to wear out and or break contacts . I have had trouble since laptops were developed with charging connections on daily use machines . Paying cash to have them fixed is often 50% of the cost of the device . If the tech has changed you just scrap them .Well these are my thoughts outside what others have written or reinforcing issues previously discussed . Get ES Explorer , Dolphin ,Antivirus , Flash , plus Overdrive for library books with EPUB TO EWZ3 converter for kindle to read them with  Calibre for your desktop to download via usb and find free content . Take care will update after I have owned this for a while and learn more about work around's that are necessary and beneficial . I believe my next device will be a advanced smart phone with text to speech and banking abilities that works with Sprints unlimited data and access plans  . Very sad my institutions found designing apps for Amazons modified Kindle  OS not worthwhile but Google or Apple are covered . I wonder how the shadow rt devices will fair ? Though for those that use Fidelity Bank / Brokerage they do have a application that many speak very pleasantly about . That's a huge benefit for many who wish to use the tablet for day to day business when on the road and can control their fears over security at coffee shops , airports and other wifi hot spots away from home . Enjoy .Update : I think after trying the video content I can no longer complain about feeling like I am forced to join Amazon Prime . The truth is it is a great deal with the cloud . This device is sold very inexpensively and their is enough free content and applications available to keep one busy forever . This truly is a wonderful deal and is reintroducing me to reading on my terms . While wifi is not everywhere you can download content to view wherever you may be . My next mission to find a application that can download my newspapers while I sleep as it is docked charging . The possibilities are as endless as the kindle communities imagination . Oh and after trying Amazon Primes free video content I think I will cancel my Netflix . That will actually save me money and it is nice if you must stay at a hotel if they have wifi you can watch free amazon content . I opted to renew the prime though I do comparison shop before blindly committing to amazon for a purchase . It is hard to do but you have to be honest and figure in the cost of driving too and time for purchases elsewhere . The main problem is it is so easy to purchase items you do not organize your purchases as well as before since prime has no incentives to do so built in . I do like the add on items but wish it was easier to add something in as long as it hasn't shipped yet then delete then reorder taking a chance your previous item won't be sold to someone else or out of stock if you do .

It's not a 5 because my other two Kindles (an original and a recent model) display books just as well but they weigh a lot less and they don't rotate the image if I roll over in bed (yes, I know that the rotation can be locked.)As an Amazon movie viewer this is a 4.5 star.  The only weakness, as a personal movie viewer, is that the sound, although amazing for its size, is still a little weak in some cases. Maybe it deserves a 5 star but I may be feeling a little negative due to the other weaknesses.Then there is \"Everything Else This Thing Is Supposed To Do.\"  Mostly 1 star.E-MAIL:  The built in capability for email handling is terrible.  I found an app which is workable for sending/receiving and since I'm fortunate enough to have a provider whose services include good sorting, folders, archiving, etc., that part is fixed.  However, wait until you try to \"type\" an email.  SWYPE is cool but gets really old, really fast.KEYBOARD:  Nah. The screen keyboard is for Twitter posts and IM -- not for anything remotely like notes, data entry, or anything that you might want to not have vanish when your finger accidentally brushes some spot on the screen.  Plus there is not workable copy/paste or search or any of the other rudimentary text handling features that have been around since the Apple II and DOS 1.1  And, the prompted-word/auto-correct feature is good for several years of Facebook jokes: \"Look what he typed!\"By adding a Belkin Blue Tooth keyboard there is a bit more utility (I'm using it to type this) but that still doesn't give you CTRL feature capability that you're used to with any real computer and the select/copy/paste type functions are still pretty kludgy.BROWSER:  Oh, my blessed Flying Spaghetti Monster!  What a piece of crap.  The browsers coming out of the various university backrooms in the 1980's were more fully featured and stable than this thing.  I've spent a good bit of time looking and cannot find one that will load and run on this HD 8.9.  Wow ... and I \"used to\" do a fair amount of Internet work.  How do you invest all of the time and money into something like this machine and then load something as brain damaged as this browser into it?SOFTWARE:  There is none.  Zero.  Nada.  Oh, \"Apps\"?  You mean those games or pieces of pseudo-software that are featured on Amazon and on the online store? (which quite often tells you that \"Your device is not compatible.\")  First, everything that I've looked at is (to be polite) \"snoopware,\" which might not quite qualify as malicious spyware but you have no way of knowing.  Almost everything I've looked at wants you to permit the app's creator to have full access to all of your data, contact lists, history, etc.  Everything on your machine.  That'll happen ... not.Word processor?  Nope.  Spread sheet?  Nope.  All the app review areas are full of people commenting on them being snoopware AND, THIS IS IMPORTANT, almost all of them require that you be in a spot with WIFI access while using them.  Other reviewers complain that trying to create or manipulate files for use on office machines either does not happen easily or at all.Come on Amazon.  I don't give a dip about free or $14.99 apps.  I've paid hundreds of dollars for real software and would pay that much for an \"office suite\" of software to make this book reader into a really useful part of my life.For the Facebook users out there, don't bother trying to use the app that comes with the brain damaged browser.  You'll put a bullet through your new Kindle.  There are apps available which make the experience a little better but, compared to any regular computer, it is still hard to live with.TOUCHSCREEN:  My touchscreen experience is fairly limited but this one seems to work as advertised.  The problem is ... to what end?  Selecting bits of screens or highlighting text is stupid with a touch screen. Gimme a mouse.  Zooming with finger tips?  Cute.  Not much better than with a mouse wheel.  Spinning the carousel?  Where's the utility vs., a desktop of icons?  Drilling through menus and lists?  I have to tap more than once, frequently.  I never ever had to click a mouse more than once to execute a selection.  Gimme a mouse, unless I'm standing up or on the go.  For my uses, that rarely happens.  Maybe I'm not part of the HD's target consumer base.OTHER STUFF:  Well, I didn't look at the specs well enough and had no idea that there is no provision for any type of direct data transfer, like an SD card slot.  Cripes, the little junk video cams from China have micro-SD slots.  They can't be that expensive. So, for us old fossils without blue tooth cameras and the latest of the latest phones, what are we supposed to use?  The USB slot?  Ssssslow.For something without a fan or a hard drive motor, the battery life sure isn't very impressive.  I get about 5-6 hours of simple online time -- NOT using intensive processor features.  My guess is that a streaming movie or heavy graphics game will eat it much faster.I guess I won't go on because there are so many other reviews that this may never be read by anyone.  Just close this out by saying that it's a nice Kindle but as a former netbook user, I wish I had my netbook back.Update September 2013:Well, I've given it well over 6 months now and none of my opinions above have changed.  If anything, I'm way more negative about touch screens than before.  I've become much more swype proficient and now use it for short twitter-length stuff but really think that swiping or thumb stabbing is stupid compared to keyboard use unless you're keyboard challenged and can't touch type.  Insofar as selections, edits, copy/paste and accurately moving around a computer environment, touchscreens are a cute novelty which has no place in serious work.  I guess if you've never worked a keyboard, keyboard shortcuts and a full featured cordless mouse then you might think a touch screen is pretty slick.

So of course when I saw the student prime deal for $70 off the Kindle Fire 8.9\" HD, I knew it was too good to pass up! I should point out that I have an iPhone 4 but I am in no way one of those people who thinks everything Apple is better just because it's Apple. Anyway, I setup my Kindle Fire and let it charge for a bit. Then I downloaded one app. I was hanging out with a couple of friends after work and during our discussion, I decided to search for something on the web...this was when I learned my \"great deal\" so great after all. I did one search using the laughable web app, silk. The app crashed multiple times, froze, and then I even got an auto reboot. I don't have anything on my Kindle yet and I can't even do a web search? Don't worry, I had my 3 year old iPhone to use. So there I was telling a group of people how excited I was about  my new Kindle Fire and they get to watch me put my frozen Kindle down to use my old iPhone to do a web search. On a lighter note, the ads aren't so bad...Update (9/11/13):  It's been a couple of weeks since I received my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" and well, it's ok.  I received an email today from Amazon regarding my review.  Basically, they responded to my horrible troubles with Silk by clearing the app data and then doing a device restart.  So, you're telling me that in order to get a brand new item to work properly, I should have cleared all of the app data and done a device restart when I received it (you know, brand new)?  Wow.  As far as the device goes, it's alright.  I have had some videos crash and it's not exactly the most user friendly (Sorry Amazon, you wanted to design something anti-Apple, and you did, but you neglected one of the most important things that people love about Apple (being really user-friendly)).  I don't hate the device like I did that first day, but I can't say I love it either.

I originally used the first gen for quite a while before \"upgrading\" to the HD 8.9. I am a working professional, but I primarily use this tablet for college textbooks.II was excited when I received this kindle as a gift in Nov. 2013. I spend hours each week reading through textbooks, highlighting, and taking notes. The larger screen was greatly appealing to me b/c I do not exactly have the best eye sight. Also, I would frequently take my old kindle to work to read whenever I had a break. Right off the bat I noticed some unfortunate drawbacks to this tablet:1. The battery life is abhorrent. My original kindle fire could last for days without requiring a charge. However with this tablet, I need to keep it on the charger whenever I am doing homework. I can still take my kindle to work to read, but there have been a number of occasions where I sat down to catch up on a chapter only to find my kindle at 3% battery life because I didn't leave it on the charger the night before. In other words, with this kindle you have to really remember to always leave it on the charger.2. The touch screen makes my life miserable. I can't tell you how many times I have sat here touching a word, zooming in, zooming out, having the screen freeze, restarting the kindle, and then beginning the process anew just in an attempt to highlight a sentence. I often feel like I would have been better off spending the extra money to purchase the actual textbooks rather than the kindle editions so I wouldn't spend 10 minutes trying to highlight two sentences. I also have trouble trying to get the home button to pop up. Rather than having the little home screen show up, I usually end up turning the page multiple times before actually getting the home icon to show up. For reference, I did purchase the amazon tablet stylus, so I am not trying to do all of this with my finger. I am using a stylus and still having issues.3. Advertisements. My original kindle fire did not force me to look at ads. This one does. I don't feel this is necessary. I'm not using my kindle to shop. I'm using it to study, so I do not need these kinds of distractions.The only pro that I have for this kindle is the screen size and resolution. It is nice in comparison to the original kindle fire. However screen response and battery life are complete poop. If you are looking to purchase this kindle for the sole purpose of just reading books from home, you are probably fine.If you are a student or professional who frequently reads on the go and/or utilizes the highlighting function, look into another kindle b/c this one is not the one for you.", "Title": "Not great for college students, reading on the go", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Author": "Lucinda", "ReviewID": "R2887KPQIA84YQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought my first Kindle 8.9 HD because I had read by its description, that it was much faster than the Kindle Fire.

I wanted to return it then but decided to give them a chance to fix the problem with no luck.

My daughter found that button and all she had to do was tap it, effectively wiping my Kindle out of all apps, books, movies, etc. I had to download everything again and basically lost all of the saved data for all of my games.

The reasons I say this is first off the 8.9\" has a front facing camera for Skype and if you download a certain editing app you can access the camera itself and the newer 2013 doesn't even have a camera. The screen is actually a huge difference from the 7\" if you compare them side to side, the 8.9 is such a bigger screen. My sister even wants to return hers 7\", She said, (\"It Looks like a toy next to yours\"). lol :) Also the screen resolution for the 7\"  is only 1280x800 vs the 2012 8.9\" is 1920x1200, so the screen is so much more beautiful and clear than the \"newer improved\" version.

Both picture and sound quality are amazingly good and provides an enjoyable experience.  I love using the Kindle as a book and I can travel with it, taking with me, dozen of Kindle books.  That is AWESOME!  This is my second one, since after almost a year, my first Kindle (same model) began to freeze quite often.  Several times a day, It would just stop working.  After I tried all the fixes available on the Amazon website, I contacted their technical support.  After a few tries to fix it, the technician volunteered to send me another at no charge and gave me a label to send back the old unit free of charge.  I LOVE AMAZON!  When I got the new one, it was already loaded with all my old contents and I used it without trouble, up until the last few day.  It now freezes, but only occasionally.  That's just enough to make me uneasy about this units future.However, I have two other concerns.  First and foremost, it is not capable of playing Flash Player videos, which constitutes about half of the videos available on line.  This is very frustrating because there are lots that I want to play, but the Kindle is not compatible and Amazon told me that there are no plans to change that.  Since they are otherwise, so accommodating to the consumer's needs, that seems odd.  Secondly,I am a subscriber to Acorn TV.  While it works on my apple computer, it does not work on my Kindle.  I am not really sure if this issue is one and the same (to not being able to play Flash Player), but if this flaw is addressed, I will gladly give the Kindle 5 STARS.", "Title": "I LOVE IT!

The Kindle has a few things going for it when compared to the iPad.1) PRICE! - The kindle is so much cheaper than the iPad and this is probably what leads so many people to it initially.2) Android! - I've never been a fan of IOS, and the Android operating system has always been more user friendly in my eyes.3) Free books - When you have a Kindle & you're a member of Amazon Prime you get access to a huge library of free books.-Now that we've gone over the pros, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the cons and how to avoid them.1) Amazon tries to lock down their products. - Yes the iPad is similar, but Amazon does it more and if you don't root it's extremely annoying.2) Again, unrooted, you're forced to use the Amazon appstore instead of the google play store. This is a problem if you've previously purchased apps on the Play store and expect to use them on your kindle. - Again - Root your Kindle!3) No GPS!? - The iPads all have GPS for use with sky maps, maps, and apps that need a location to be used.. To save money Amazon left this out... It gets annoying on sideloaded or rooted apps sometimes.-Most of the problems you'll experience on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 can be avoided/gotten around by rooting.

We bought our four kids ages 7, 5.5, 5.5, and 3.5 iPods for Christmas because they were constantly wanting our iPhones and the iPad. The problem is, though, that the kids became even more annoying - constantly asking for new apps. With Kindle Fire, parents can pay monthly (it's like 6 or 7 dollars per household per month) and each kid gets their own profile, fully stocked with Kindle's library of books, videos and apps. When you click on the profile, you are automatically locked in, and it looks just like any other profile, you can click on books, or apps, or videos. Amazon stocks the profile with age appropriate content, based on birthday. Parents have the option of adding to the content if they want, or removing content, if they want. And, the kindle gives them time warnings and locks them out after the designated time.  Last night before dinner, my 7 year old was reading his library book about the sabertooth tiger. He then had a lot of questions about the La Brea tar pits. We found a documentary on the internet and he, our 5.5 year old and our 3.5 year old were able to watch it while we cooked. It was awesome. Now, of course, you can do this with the iPad, iPod or iPhone, but I sure like handing them the kindle with their Profile already selected!", "Title": "Kindle Fire HD bests iPod and iPad with its Kindle Free Time profiles for kids!", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Author": "zach", "ReviewID": "R287IF1EAECMGT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really love the Kindle Fire HD and what made it even better was when I received it in the mail all my apps, programs and music was downloaded for me.

When you push the ON button and \"Kindle Fire\" lights up on the screen, do you just wait till the screen saver shows up, or do you push it again?  Why is it sometimes so hard to close the book you're reading and get the Home icon to show up?  Is it slow, or am I just impatient?  Should you always go to Home before touching the OFF button?  Is it better to plug in in each night and let it charge all night, or is that too long to leave it plugged in?  Is it better to charge it frequently or to wait till it is very low?

The HD picture is awesome for movies\\videos\\games\\etc.  The sound is an improvement from the 1st Gen I had but could still sue some tweaking - love to see the speakers make it to the front somehow.  They are currently on the back side which means the case can cause some interruption in the quality of the sound.  If you use it without a case you have to be careful where you set it to not block the speakers.  The only other change would be the camera - it is currently located on the front (for use with Skype)which makes it very difficult to take pictures and videos are out....  They need to enable to camera to flip like the iPhone so you can use skype or take pics\\video.  If those changes were made this table would be a 5 star piece of equipment.
