It is very frustrating as I live and work in China and Amazon can only repair and ship it within the USA.  On the other hand, it comes with a one-year warranty.  Its a sleek and cool device with awesome potential but I dont like the touch screen malfunctioning so soon. I was advised by Amazon help to reboot it by holding the on/off button down for 20 seconds.

So we bought it, and watched her call for help the first time and it worked perfectly. The person was polite, and (oh so) patient with my grandmother, showing her how to use it on her screen. I couldn't recommend that feature enough.As someone who works in IT, and an avid Android user, for the device itself: 4.5 Stars/5.With the assumption that you are OK with Amazon's closed wall of apps, and are a Prime member, here's my review:PROS:-Blazing fast. Stupid fast. (I owe a Nexus 7, this is faster)-Simple interface.-Everything works. No wifi-issues, no screen issue, it works as advertised.-The Mayday feature. It just works. And someone responds in under 30 seconds.-Buying stuff (apps, books, mags) is super easy, and is presented nicely.CONS:-Customization: little to none. Device settings are limited, and while I get the design philosophy of simple, a little too simple for my android-tinted desires to control my device.-Interface, while simple, is non-linear. Can be confusing at times. Like the tabs up top, and then the side tabs go to (sorta) the same place, and then the different media stores within the tabs, and from there... I don't even know, it gets confusing.-Not as many apps as Play Store/iOS App store, not really a complaint more of a wish for more of Play Store's apps.

If you play games or watch movies, it is not noticeable.  However, if you read books or web pages, then it is very noticeable.  It is distracting, unpleasant to view, and bothersome.  The previous generation HD does not suffer this problem and is a far superior reader.I spoke with tech support who was courteous and friendly (as always).

Seemed a little glitchy at first start up (initial software update) but smooth sailing since then. Bright, colorful, fast, easy to use, etc.I had an Ipad 2 and sold it on craiglist after 10 months. Meh. Big, clunky. You needed 3 hands to use it. I bought each of my kids an Ipad Mini original. Expensive and nothing special. This is small and light and affordable. Completely different product.Various reviews complain how limited the apps are. I mean if 800k apps will guarantee your productivity, more power to you. I keep it to about 50 apps and all are important. Only thing lacking is no Facetime for apple user friends and family but no biggie.I strongly considered the Nexus 7. I have friends who love the original. The shape is just a little off and weird. It was a toss up. Happy about my Kindle choice.My coworkers have gawked at it all day. I wish the LTE option under ATT was cheaper so I would have bought that option but probably wouldn't have really gotten my money's worth.Other than that fancy Apple logo, this is a much smarter bet. Toss up with the Nexus 7 but this shape is better. Can't see why you would regret it.Lastly, I read a little bit with the blue ring glow against the white background (making headlines with the blue glow) but I don't see what the issue is. So minor not even worth the nitpick.Enjoy your new Kindle Fire HDX!", "Title": "First Ever Review - Love It", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Author": "Phuong Ha", "ReviewID": "R2JUK2I68311BW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sorry for the cheesy Survivor reference. But the search is really over. After weeks of reading, waiting and wanting, I finally came to a conclusion that not only have allowed me to sleep better but it also has allowed my wife to search better, surf better, and feel better.So, here is the low-down on the research I did prior to finally buying the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" vs. the iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7\" or 8\" or 10.1, the Samsung Note 8\" or 10.1, the Nexus 7\", and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.First the iPad Mini. She has the iPhone and I did before trading for a Samsung Note 3. We have tons and tons of apps bought from iTunes. But, truth be told, the pricing made me crazy. You get old technology for cheaper than the rest (last year's iPad mini) with lower resolution but cheap. But cheap to Apple is almost the same as the other tablets. If you wanted the new A7 chip then you had to pay for it with your first born. I was tired of being brain-washed into the Apple Cult so I opted out from the iPad Mini. Look and feel was okay but you needed to buy too many accessories to make it feel safe and secure and yes, cool. So no to Apple.Second, the Samsung Tab 3 and Note tablets. After switching to the Note 3 phone, I loved the pen and the many options Samsung added to a phone with an awesome screen resolution and size. So it was natural that I looked at the Samsungs as an option. But upon close inspection here's what I found.All are great screen resolutions, look and feel. All have access to the Android App store so that's no problem. In fact, most apps that cost me rent money on iTunes, was free in the Android Store. But, here's the deciding factor: price compared to processor speed. If you wanted a good price, you had to settle with last year's model or a not-so-up-to-date model. This went for the Note tablets as well. So, in order to keep up with the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" or 8.9\" you had only the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 version but that meant over the $500 mark. All the other Samsung models either ran off of the older dual-core processors at 1.5 GHz or you could fork over the money for the faster quad-core 1.9 GHz. So no to Samsung.Then of course there was the newly printed Nexus 7 but again, the processor speed was 1.5 GHz quad-core Snapdragon Adreno 320 GPU. Fast but not the fastest one out there. Liked the feel and look of it but really, why use not put in the best processor and make it outstanding. But, I think it was to keep the price competitive. This was the closes one I would have gotten next to the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" or 8.9\". So no to the Nexus, sorry Google.Finally, it came down to the 7\" and the 8.9\". Considering I was getting for my wife, who has smaller hands, wants a tablet but one that feels snug in her hand without giving up screen size. I decided on the HDX 7\". If I would have gotten this thing for me, then I would have again gone with the Fire HDX 8.9\" because it has the Snapdragon Adreno 330 GPU 2.2 GHZ quad-core meaning that it has the fastest processor out there that will eventually last you the longest when it comes to technology.It basically boils down to the fact that technology now is at the speed of quarterly sells. They have to make products that can be introduced according to marketplace sells and holidays. Each new lineup will have a faster and slimmer look.I decided on the Kindle Fire HDX for 3 main reasons: 1) the processor speed is the fastest one I could find. It will last for awhile. It will keep up with everything we throw at it. 2) Price was a major deciding factor. But it was decided eventually on Cyber Monday when I bounce on it for the extra $50 bucks off at the lower price of $179.00. For what you get relative to the price, no doubt this was a no brainer. 3) the look and feel. The rubber back feels really nice and has a soft yet safe feel to it. You don't feel like it's going to drop out of your hands. When holding it from either landscape or portrait views it still feels nice. It has a nice size edge so your thumbs can still grip the tablet with interfering with any open apps. The speed is super fast and responsive. And with Google Gmail integration, again, a no brainer.Overall, truly an awesome tablet. Sorry for the long review. But, after doing so much research on a tablet, I figure I would pass it on.", "Title": "How Can I Convince You, What You See is Real.

When the HDX model came out late last year, I was interested in some of the features particularly the stated improved screen, not that there were complaints about its predecessor's readability! When amazon offered the HDX on an  incentive payment plan, I couldn't resist so clicked the purchase. It arrived a day earlier than advertised, an auspicious beginning, and was packed in recyclable cardboard which pleased this Tree Hugger greatly. The minimalist box for the device was likewise showing consideration for the environment which still affording a design tour d' force. a simple decorative sleeve houses the box in which the Kindle nestles along with the power cord and adapter, plus a small, plain set up sheet for the beginner.This edition of the Kindle Fire is noticeably thinner. I did have some difficulty plugging the cord into it as it goes in at an angle, whereas the other model was a straight shot. Finding the power button, changed from the bottom next to the charging cord to the back of the device, was likewise confounding briefly but other than that, I'd have to say... it was all a piece of cake, and of course the amazon cloud had already registered this newest Kindle along with preparing to download all the eBooks etc. Couldn't be much easier than that.In the case of the Kindle Fire HDX, I'd have to say, it is truly a refined device in all regards and justifies the purchase. I strongly recommend getting one of the Kindle eBooks on the Fire HDX to speed up the use of your new device. I found it enormously beneficial in both cases, throughout time. I am currently using the Kindle Fire HDX & HD Complete Guidebook published March, 2014.As a further satisfied purchaser of the device, may I state that while I am a bonafide Apple User, I still prefer the Kindle Fire (HDX) for eBooks and definitely for the value that amazon provides in pricing them.", "Title": "A Surprising improvement to the Kindle Fire HDX", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Author": "Brad Shea", "ReviewID": "RF92BO14OA20C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have FIVE Kindle Fires in this house.

I'm not sure if this is because my Galaxy S4 is just enough (in terms of size) for me to do most of the things I need to do or if it is because a couple things about the HDX Fire that annoy me and thus got me to use it less.First, the charger it comes with is just too slow.  I realize the original charger is a 'slow' version and a 'fast' charger is sold separately, but the slow should not be a snail crawl charger.  Also, the Kindle crashed on me.  I called customer care, they helped me quickly reset the device to factory settings and it seemed to have fixed it.  I am concerned I have a defect though.  Regardless, they say I have a warranty and can get it replaced anytime within a year (I hope this stands true).  I'm always gun shy to exchange things quickly because OEMs tend to send you a refurb for your new device.These two items make the device a neutral buy rating for me.

Firstly I will address the many issues people tend to have with this device and comment on my personal situation.Wifi - Setting up Wifi at first was a little shotty as my router had to be reset a couple of times to allow it to access the kindle. At random times it seems like it drops wifi but this happens infrequently and isnt all that annoying unless it is during a video.Blue Tint - This is noticeable on my device on white screens but perhaps I wouldnt have even seen it hadnt I read so many reviews on it. It really doesnt bother me all that much and I turn the kindle to dark view when reading anyways. Unless yours is really bad I think this is just people nitpicking.Battery - So far it has been pretty strong. I watched a lot of media on this device and I have seen it last anywhere from 7-12 hours. I have noticed it depends on strength of wifi and screen brightness mostly. I watched 4 episodes of Justified last night and it only dropped about 25-30%.App Store - This is one of those things that people can research pretty indepthly before purchasing the device, so why people complain about it is beyond me. They are missing some key apps outside of google play store but many of them can be sideloaded using 1mobilemarket or an equivalent. I have noticed the apps through amazon are generally a version or two behind but its not a deal breaker.I understand you cant do this on an ipad either, but I wish you could rename apps. I hate when I download an app from Amazon and it has a weird name and throws it off alphabetically when I am looking for it.Now for the positives:Screen - The picture on this device is immaculate. Watching media is very crisp and enjoyable even on the 7\" device. The colors are accruate.Speakers - The speakers are very good on this device, much better than expected. It is perfect for watching on your lap, table or bed. They dont get too loud but I have never, as of yet, needed to watch something with them a full capactiy.Media - One of the key selling points is the ability to download videos to the device for offline viewing. I have noticed that the xfinity app allows you to do the same thing that Amazon has promised w this device. There are not many great movies to download and people are upset w this through Amazon Prime Video, however the list of tv shows is exceptional. They have a lot where you can either view/download the videos to the device. Amazon prime is strongly suggested if you were to purchase this device.Reading - Reading is a delight on this device. Very crisp and sharp and I love that you can download overdrive and rent books via your library. The Amazon Kindle Lending library is very weak and if you are considering this as a reason to buy then forget it all together.Overall I am very impressed with this device and at $229 ($179 on cyber monday) it is definitley worth a buy. It is more of a media consumption device then a tablet so to speak. I notice that when I am using it I seem to run out of things to do on it, unlike an iphone/ipad but still I think it is a great device for the budget conscious buyer.", "Title": "An entertainment device", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Author": "J.

The screen is amazing - better than the iPad by far and pretty comparable to the Nexus 7 I use. She uses it for reading, Facebook, Pinterest, and a few other apps.

My wife wanted to change the background to a picture but apparently that feature is not implemented for some odd reason. She also wanted to rename it from Kindle #2 but apparently that is not allowed either. I think the tradeoff in being easy to use might have overstepped a bit here, as asking to put your own pictures on as a background shouldn't really be an issue, nor should renaming it to be more personally named be such an issue either.

Now the reason I wanted the smaller screen was because when I read my books I want to really feel like im reading a book sized object which is a better fit for me and makes a difference in my reading. This dissapointed me alot because I spend alot of extra money to pay for the 32 GB to take pictures on it but I cant really take any pictures of use with the front facing camera. The rear facing camera would make my 32BG purchase choice more useful. SO that was extremely dissapointing.  #2 when playing games on my kindle about 50% of the time the game will start flashing slightly but enough to really annoy me and make me think that something might be wrong with my device. But when calling mayday I was basically told to just call them back if it happens again but in reality it doesnt matter because of course you would have to catch it at the right time in order to show the may day people what you're talking about. The flashing that happens during the game is a random act and not something that can really be shown unless catching it at the right time which is unlikely.other than those two things, I really love my kindle as I do amazon but the two issues stated above really bug me since I really support amazon and have probably influenced 7 people at this point to buy Kindles as well as the prime membership within the past few years and probably only felt maybe 80% satisfaction from my current kindle.", "Title": "I Love my kindle but just a few small annoyances", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Author": "Carol E.

My previous kindle charged quickly even in use and had an amazing battery life!  I even called customer service and they said there's was a problem with it. Guess what? When I was sent the new one it worked just as bad as before.My next issue is What happened to flash player?!  My old kindle has it! And now when I go to watch certain shows I used to watch or when I go to amazon to view a product video I can't view it anymore!!Next ..  i used to watch the network apps such as the cw ect..  on my previous tablet and still do with no problems. but when i watch them on my HDX they time out whenever the commercial break happens, I have to actually exit the app ,go into my wifi , turn it off, and then back on again to get it to work! Once back in i have to fast foward to where i left off ! This is something i also asked about when in called customer service and was told it was the kindle and my internet. if this were true then why does it work perfectly on the old kindle? Again got the new HDX replaced and still have same issue to this day. It's not my Internet !  I've even been to places that only use one device in there home and have way better internet than me and my kindle still does this !

The reason I only gave it  4 stars is some of the features that come with it don't work as they should. The first one that comes to mind is the speech to text. It works very sporadic. One in three times it will work. What I do like is when it does work it's pretty accurate as far as words. I guess I am somewhat disappointed because we have an IPad and there is no comparison between the two. (In my opinion anyway) the iPad is a lot easier to navigate around on, speech to text always works as well. The touch sceen on the iPad also works a lot smoother and is more accurate.

Weigel \"Donna Weigel\"", "ReviewID": "R3GNMV4OBSOTS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a kindle before the Kindle fire ( and I waited for the HD version) that I loved but was becoming limited since I also wanted to convenience of checking email and going on the internet, following links in a ebook etc.  I was so in love with my regular kindle and was a reading fool on that thing. I had a relationship with it. Let\u2019s face it, I slept with it more than I have any man. Lol.  Giving it up and moving on was not an easy decision.Kindle vs Kindle Fire HD vs Fire HDX.Kindle:  Love the light shining on the book rather back lit.  It is far less stressful reading.  The gray background allowed me to read forever easily.  I loved how easy it was to organize books. However, it had become limited.  I couldn\u2019t really surf the internet, magazines and pictures wouldn\u2019t work on it well and it was black and white.  Pretty sure you know the rest.Kindle Fire:  I don\u2019t by the first of anything because it will improve and become cheaper.  The biggest issue with the kindle fire was it didn\u2019t have a reader and I do use that often.  The front page was a bookshelf which is ok but couldn\u2019t organize like the reg kindle.Kindle Fire HD:  I hate the carousel on kindle fire HD.  It\u2019s a circle of icons in which the last thing you opened goes up there.  Want it or not.  You can delete from the carousel but something else will pop up there that is on your device. It has a set number of icons it wants there and it will keep it filled.  Grrr.  I wish it would just go away.  I liked how I could organize my books on the regular kindle.  That said, there are apps that make that happen so it makes life easier. You know there HAS to be an app for that!  Over all the organization isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s simple to use.  My six year old can use it no problem. But then again, kids are born knowing these things today.  Being back lit vs light shining on the book isn\u2019t as easy to read as the original kindle was.  The back light can be adjusted way down which is a plus. I don\u2019t think this is a big issue to most people.  I\u2019m dyslexic and having dimmer light on the gray background rocked!  I could be a reading fool.  I can\u2019t read as long on this.  As I said though for most people that probably isn\u2019t an issue.  After my withdraw from my original kindle I love this one.  SO much more you can do with it!!  The battery doesn\u2019t last like the original but we are doing WAY more with this one than just read.  AND naturally there is an app for that!!!  There are battery savers that shut down what isn\u2019t needed and does make a difference in battery life.  Considering with I do however I think the battery isn\u2019t bad. I play music and a game at the same time or music and read, music and read.  I am asking a lot! I was use to the other battery lasting for weeks.  One plus is my phone charger works for the kindle.  I\u2019m just overall too happy with the upgrade to Kindle Fire HD.HD vs HDX.I got the HD with Ads because I didn\u2019t care to pay to not have them. I\u2019m really glad I did that.  I like the ads.  There were some movie and TV trailers that I would have otherwise missed.  Product ads you never know but they aren't annoying at all.My son bought the HDX.  He loves it.As far as I can tell the big difference is with the HDX you can have Wifi and cell towers.  Oh and the live help.  I asked if I could upgrade because it came out right after I bought my HD. The answer was no, I would need to sell it myself.  I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t need to use cell towers.  Some might where they live but I don\u2019t.  As for live help, once you learn your kindle do you really need that?  I didn\u2019t for the price difference.  Last I knew it was a good $200 difference.  I\u2019m sure the price will go down, the HD will be priced at peanuts and it will all balance out in time.  It seems about a year is when the big price change happens.Good luck with your new decisions!", "Title": "Kindle vs Kindle Fire HD vs Fire HDX", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Author": "Juan Pablo", "ReviewID": "R1MBQBC0JCA59Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A very smooth tablet.

Our daughter has been able to find most all the apps she was looking for.  I think as the Kindle continues to gain traction, the developers will obviously go where the customers are.

I tried with all my power to like the Kindle. But in the end, I will be returning this device. The hardware is excellent, and the user interface is pretty good as well. But odd behavior kept occurring. The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger. It continuously rebooted all day long. Nothing I did would stop the boot loop. Finally when I got home and plugged it into the charger, it booted back to the UI. I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times. It's more of an annoyance than a problem. There are other odd things that I can't recall at the moment. But ultimately, it's the battery life that prompts me to return the Kindle. Fully charged at 100% and left over night will find the device down to 88% without use. Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours. Not heavy usage either, playing Candy Crush then browsing Facebook will do it. One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge. Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%. Meanwhile, my Nexus 7 was at 14%, plugged in at the same time and was at 100% the next morning. I just can't have a device that I am constantly worried about keeping charged all the time.

They pushed out some updates to me, gave me pointers on how to ensure I am on the tablet version of common websites (since videos won't work on all of the regular sites), and ABC published an updated app for viewing episodes. Now I am largely happy with the Kindle's ability to watch streaming videos. The only downsides I have experienced is the Hulu is not available (you can access hulu plus but not the free site), the volume/sound projection abilities don't seem as good as some of my other devices (like my ipod), and you can only have one window/tab open at a time.

Also have a full-size iPad which is a great size for watching movies in bed, but really too big/heavy to play games.  The original Kindle Fire has only 8 GB storage (partly taken up by software) so I wanted another smaller tablet.  It was between the new Kindle HDX or the new iPad mini.  One thing I didn't like about the iPad mini (besides the price tag) is that the bezzle on the long sides is so narrow, it is hard to hold the device without getting your thumb on the display (which screws up games).  When I saw the HDX on sale on Cyber Monday, I grabbed it.It's fast, thin, light and easy to hold for long periods of time.  I can't believe how light it is compared to my KFire! There are several design changes, such as the ability to show the percentage the battery is charged in the little icon in the top right corner. You have to swipe down from the top of the display to access settings and other utilities.  I got the 32 GB version, so there is plenty of room for games and other apps.  I did download a Prime Instant Video to watch off-line, but I don't like the small display for watching movies.About that display -- I compared the HDX to the original Fire, looking at the same page of a book that has alot of white space on it.  White is a color, and like all colors, it can be \"warm\" or \"cool.\"  A cool white is \"bluish\", and a warm white will be a little yellowish.  When I compared the 2 kindle displays for a book, I was shocked to see something I never noticed before.  On the original Fire, the white is \"cool/bluish\" and there is yellowish tint seeping in around the edges of the pages of the book I was comparing!  This never bothered  me; as I said, I never noticed it.  On the new HDX, the opposite is true --  the color white is warm (yellowish) with the blue/purple (that so many have commented about) seeping in around the edges of the book.  I doubt that this will bother me, and I feel that the people who complained about this and sent back this beautiful little device because of it, need to get a life!  BTW, the page on the HDX doesn't look yellowish to me at all; it is only when compared side-by-side to the original Fire that you can detect the different tints to the white color.I love playing games on the HDX, as even fast running games (such as my favorite Temple Run 2) work without stalling.  And, I got Temple Run Oz (finally) which was not compatible with the original Fire.There are some design features I don't like, such as the way the charger sticks in at an angle.  But charging is very fast using the included charger. My only real issue now is the battery life.  I am currently charging it up, and I am going to see if I can get anything close to 10 hours of \"mixed use\" on it.  (Yes, there are ways to extend battery life, such as turning off wifi when not using it.  Search on the internet for other tips.)Edit about battery life:  I usually find that when products are advertised as \"up to X hours on a single battery charge (depending on settings, usage, blah blah blah)\"  I usually get half that. What concerned me about the HDX was that I had fallen asleep with the HDX unplugged, watching a PREVIOUSLY DOWNLOADED movie (a 2.5 hour movie downloaded in \"better\" quality; after it finished, the display went into sleep mode)-- the next morning, the battery was showing only 35% charged from fully charged the night before.  Since many people posting on the forums with battery problems were told to do a \"hard reboot\"  I tried that then fully charged the battery again (luckily, charging is pretty quick.)  Downloading music, and letting the display go to sleep mode, the HDX lost only about 10% per hour.  But as soon as I picked it up and played some games for a little while (like Temple Run 2) the battery much more rapidly depleted (this is with wifi turned on, as music was simultaneously downloading).  Then I recharged it, and again tested that same 2.5 hour previously downloaded movie -- with wifi turned off, \"airplane mode\" turned on, and brightness set at about 70%, the battery drained from fully charged to 65%. So, finally, I downloaded a 2 hour SD quality movie to my HDX, and going from fully charged, with wifi off, and brightness lowered to about 50%, the battery went to 88%, losing only 12%.  Yes, a big improvement over my original KFire which lost double that, 25%, under the same conditions.When I got my HDX it was about 70% charged.  Looking in the settings, I saw that the software was up-to-date.  I was able to download content, read, and play games, without the HDX turning itself off and rebooting (as many have complained of).  The next morning, I saw a notification that there had been a software update -- one thing that was changed is that you can now put apps and books into \"collections.\"  Not only that, but apparently my HDX \"synced\" wirelessly with my iPad Kindle reading app, where I had already put some books into collections.  Those same books now appear in collections on my HDX without my doing anything. Thank you Amazon.I give this 5 stars, certainly in comparison to the original Kindle Fire.  In general, this HDX is spectacular and the price is great.", "Title": "Great Small Tablet; Love It!", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Author": "Byzantine Dixie", "ReviewID": "R1T5JCVH9SIFRY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been straddling the Apple / Android fence for a while now, with one foot in both camps.  But the time came to declare allegiance.  Music and video purchases are less and less dependent on hard media like CDs and DVDs and are becoming more and more cloud based.  Which cloud\u2026that was the decision to make.So Amazon came out with fireTV\u2026and I took the plunge and decide to go with Amazon for my video purchases.  I have been a prime member since its inception\u2026and it is the first place I go to when I am looking to buy something.  I love Amazon\u2026probably in an unwholesome way.With that decision behind me I was now free to find a device to take entertainment with me when I travel for work.  Do you have any idea how long and painful it can be to copy DVDs into digital files to take along when traveling\u2026I simply did not have the patience to convert all 14 seasons Dallas!  I needed a device that would hold a number of videos to get me through at least 2 weeks overseas at a time.  Reliable streaming overseas is generally not an option for a variety of reasons.And so I bought a Kindle FireHDX (64MB, no ads) and have been absolutely delighted\u2026I seriously couldn\u2019t be happier.  It is so FAST\u2026compared to my android ASUS transformer tablet.  The video quality is beautiful.  The sound is great and it is extremely simple to download videos\u2026even Prime videos\u2026to take along on my travels.Of course, nothing is perfect.  There are some disappointments but they are relatively minor.1) Battery life is disappointing if wifi is not disabled.  That has been my experience.  I will lose 15 \u2013 20% overnight if I leave the wifi on.  With the wifi off\u2026battery life is very good.  If there is an option to turn off wifi after being asleep for a while\u2026I don\u2019t know about it yet.  Long term, hopefully something like this will be developed in a software update.2) Lack of a mini HDMI out.  I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.  When I realized too late that it had no HDMI out, I bought a Tronsmart miracast device.  It will work but not as smoothly or easily as a simple cable would.  I think the miracast is not quite ready for prime time yet.  It is not the end of the world if I can\u2019t hook up the hotel TV.  Watching directly from the Kindle works well.3) Apps\u2026need more.  I once had a Blackberry Playbook.  What awesome tablet that was\u2026really.  Fine quality device, perfect in every way\u2026except for the limited number of apps.  Amazon has to make this a priority.  And the apps need to work beautifully\u2026like they do on my iPhone (see, I said I had one foot in both camps!)4) Flicker.  I notice a disturbing flicker with one of my apps.  Haven\u2019t let determined if this is strictly a single app issue or if it will show up elsewhere.  I\u2019ll update later if it is more than just this one app.All in all I feel this was a most self-indulgent purchase\u2026it is such a sweet device and the perfect travel companion.

I was so excited when it arrived. I put on the screen protector, put it in it's case, set it up with my acct information. I was in awe of the look and feel of it. It is beautiful! The picture and sound are amazing too. If you love Amazon, this is probably exactly what you want!I went into the situation blind. I read a lot of kindle books so I thought the Fire would be great. I didn't understand that a tablet would block you from using specific programs they deem competition. I use Google Music, I pay for unlimited music each month. It never occurred to me that I wouldn't be able to stream my music over my tablet! It doesn't make any sense to me! My HTC phone, which uses google, lets me download Amazon apps so why wouldn't Amazon let me use Google?!I went into chat with an Amazon rep to find out if there was anything I could do to get my music on it. They said no, they were sorry. They said I was free to buy music from them tho. Of course I am but I don't want to buy every stupid song that pops into my head. I'd go broke!And they don't offer anything like unlimited streaming that I could switch to.In looking through the kindle apps, I also learned that the Google apps that are offered (maps, gmail) had horrible ratings with comments that they don't work at all.I am a HUGE Amazon fan. And even through this, I am a loyal customer. But I am  so deeply disappointed. I am disappointed that they have chosen an isolationist approach to their product. Having my music available to me would not have taken any dollars away from them. I still would have bought my books and movies through them. Probably a lot more than I do now. I don't buy my music thru Amazon, I buy it thru iTunes. I always have and I always will. I keep my music on Google Music. I use the unlimited music to hear new songs so I know if I want to buy it or not. By not letting me stream music they've lost book and movie purchases. They never would have had much music business from me. Maybe some, bec I might be too lazy to use iTunes. The thing is, I have my way of doing things. I use many products. I don't want to feel contained or limited or be forced into changing for literally a BAD BUSINESS decision by Amazon.I wanted the kindle bec I thought it might be nice to use in the kitchen or around the house specifically for entertainment purposes. Reading, music, movies, tv shows. A sort of all purpose entertainment center. Like they advertise. What they don't say on their product page is that you won't be able to use Google services. It should be very specific for people like me who are new to the tablet world. I bought a case and protective covers and the warranty.  Amazon is charging me money for the returns and some of it can't be returned. I feel like they withheld important information and now I am paying the price for it.I did some research last night and decided to go with the second generation Nexus. It will stream music, allow Amazon apps and it has a cute keyboard.  They don't force me into using them exclusively!Amazon is really on the wrong side of this!!", "Title": "What a heartbreak!

Why would anyone want to limit themselves to the offerings at the amazon App Store with such a great little tablet?  Kindle Fire HDX is just a version of Android with an Amazon makeover.
