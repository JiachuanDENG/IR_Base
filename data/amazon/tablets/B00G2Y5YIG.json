Remember what your mom and dad explained to you was the reason for that public humiliation?  Because they liked you too!  The same principle applies to all the competitors that say bad things about the iPad.  It's because secretly, they want to BE the iiPad.You can buy a competitor's product, but any way you slice it, it won't even begin to measure up. Just remember, every time they say something negative, they are really saying how much they love the iPad.  Nothing else compares to the bright screen on the iPad Air, or the way that it feel resting ever so lightly in your hands.  It just feels right.And that is what Apple has done so right.  It never wavered or varied based on the negative opinions of other companies.  It never even responded to them.  On the playground Apple walks away without a scratch, without trying, and without lifting a finger to respond to any other tablet's challenge.  It doesn't have to.  And everybody loves it.

First off, the iPad arrived slightly scratched from shipping. I contacted amazon and decided to settle on getting a partial refund as I didn't want to go through the hassle (international customer) and also the item was working well and the scratch marks were on the back which I decided would be covered by a case anyway. However, after a couple weeks of (light) use it developed a blue line across the screen. I am sending it back. I wont buy another iPad from amazon though because what I have come to realize is that the warranty starts from the date the seller purchased the product meaning that I only have a few months left on this warranty. I'm just glad I figured this out sooner rather than later. Excellent product overall and great customer service from amazon in sorting out the issue.-Update- I have since received my refund and purchased a new iPad from Apple. What I realized immediately was how differently this one was packaged. The one I ordered on amazon did not come sealed and did not have plastic on either the screen or the back. Plus I had mentioned before that there were scruff marks on it. I strongly suspect that the original iPad I purchased here was not new as advertised.

And if you are using this for the sole purpose of creating, sharing, and presenting documents, maintaining your schedule, and taking a few photos. That's great. However, I  tend to watch a few movies, but considering that I only actually have 12 GB of memory after software, large apps like pages and keynote, books, and few photos (less than 100) are taken into account, I can only put one on at a time, which gets a little old after awhile. The fact that apply doesn't allow expanded memory like memory cards still frustrates me to this day because you never know what you may want to put on your tablet in the future, and this leaves you no room to breathe. I hate the restrictions and the only real reason why I decided to get the IPad over the Samsung Note series is because the app store is incredible and much more versatile. I will certainly NEVER get another IPhone after having a Samsung galaxy unless Apple introduces the expanded memory.Anyway, moral of the story: Ipad Air is sleek, light, fast, functions well, has a great display and app store (that just being Apple in general). And if you REALLY have your heart set on this, I would genuinely think twice about the memory you choose. I don't regret buying this, it has served me in more ways than one.

I have tried to use Android and Windows, but I keep coming back to the Apple world.  I just like Apple's products.  I got an iPad Mini for Christmas, but decided to trade up to the Air because I wanted a larger screen.  I use my Air mostly for internet use.  I am doing online college courses, and find that I can access my coursework easily using the Air.  I also love how I can load the Amazon Video app and watch Prime on my iPad or Airplay to my Apple TV.  I love that I can sync my iPad to my computer for backups and to organize music and videos.  Now for the caveat.  Apple needs to increase the basic memory for these.  I could not afford to pay another $100 for the 32 gb Air.  16 gb does not last very long!  I want more memory!!  The available memory is more like 11-12 gb because the OS takes up the rest of the space.  Apple may never put a memory card slot in the iPads - they should, they could make it proprietary and sell them for a good markup, (not $100!) then they would make more money on volume sales!  At the least, they should start iPads with 32 gb.", "Title": "Super tablet with one caveat", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Author": "Jerry Palmer", "ReviewID": "RIYHW5RDGX42W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own or have owned several different tablets... IOS, Android, Windows... and I like them all.  I am not in one camp or the other as I believe device ownership is a matter of personal preference, need and usability for varied needs. That being said, I really to like the iPad Air.  It is light, fast and just plain reliable.  While IOS may be a bit closed when compared to other operating systems, I find myself using the Air a bit more then other devices for general use.  The display is great for consuming content and this iPad does so with nary a hiccup. The difference in size and weight from previous iPads truly makes a difference if you tend to be very mobile.  In addition, if you are turned off by the smaller size of the iPad Mini this is great alternative as it is so thin and light in comparison to previous models.  I came to this one from a 1st gen Mini.  I was very happy with the size of the Mini and (having owned a 1st gen iPad) was a bit concerned that the I would no longer be comfortable with a full size iPad but that has not been the case with the Air.If you are a storage hoarder and need  to carry all of your content with you, the 128GB device is the way to go. It is quite pricey but if you are willing to pay the price you will not have to worry about making room for new content.Overall very satisfied with this device.", "Title": "Reliable and fast...", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Author": "Frances Murray", "ReviewID": "R2OCMA2C72ZTPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Love it ,works juust as I new it would ,Pictures come out so clear and watchng netflix on it is like having a TV with you", "Title": "Apple ipad air 64 gb", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Author": "R.

I got it the day it came out in stores. It starts with the ultra-sharp exterior. If you loved last year's iPad Mini, you'll feel right at home with the Air. Apple essentially built a larger version of the Mini with the Air, by slimming the beveling of previous iPads to achieve a sleeker framework.The lack of heft makes the Air just a little more comfortable: An LTE-equipped Air weighs all of 1.05 pounds. Wrapped in a comfy and protective Apple Smart Case, the Air weighs 1.368 pounds, still lighter than a third-generation iPad by itself. Despite the lack of size, the Air is no less tough. It's sturdy and not at all easy to bend.The Air feels that much more like an electronic magazine. The Retina display, once the standard for all screens but also facing more competition this year, helps that; reading text and viewing web pages on that crystal-clear, pixel-dense screen is the same joy it was when Apple first built Retina screens into its tablets early last year.If this is all Apple did, it would likely still be enough to keep it on top. But the iPad Air does far more, starting with the new processor powering the entire experience, the A7. The same dual-core, 64-bit A7 chip that debuted in the iPhone 5S is in the iPad Air; and initially, this seems like a disappointment. In theory, you expect something more in Apple's flagship tablet, something a bit more powerful, with perhaps more graphical horsepower.In practice, you won't notice a thing. Web browsing and apps still handle as snappily as ever, even if you have a gaggle of things running in the background. Top-tier games such as Infinity Blade 3 continue to deliver. A pleasant surprise is also how quickly some of the beefier games, such as Anomaly 2, loaded, compared to previous iPads. You'll move into and out of levels just a little bit more swiftly, and that helps make the entire gaming experience more friendly and natural. It's hard to know what this really means for Apple gaming, but don't rule out the possibility of more console titles being ported to the iPad.Apple realizes the limitations of the 64 GB storage too, offering a new 128-gig model. You'll pay a more-than-average-laptop premium here ($799 for the WiFi-only model and $929 for an LTE version), but the improved storage is intriguing, especially for those planning for a game-heavy future. I can now easily and comfortably load all the music and movies onto the iPad Air that I want and still have plenty of room left over for games such as XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Civilization: Revolutions.Battery life is steady, even if it's not mind-blowing. Apple claims the iPad Air can get you 10 hours on a charge, and that's definitely true. Even when using Apple's navigation for a long trip to Washington, I easily got through a day without needing to charge; and more casual usage, such as Web browsing and email checks, is no problem.The Air's lone shortcoming is that it lacks the fingerprint identification technology that debuted on the iPhone 5S. But I'd be hard-pressed to claim that this was some glaring omission; every other tablet you're going to use this year lacks such tech, and I've never seen that tech as an absolute must-have.The resulting tablet is as pleasant to use as they come, and it's backed by some consistently solid software. Android has made a tremendous run over the past few years, and a plethora of both Android and Windows Mobile devices are truly intriguing this holiday season. But if there's one consistent shortcoming on those devices, it's the up-and-down support of operating systems.It's hard to know whether this Android tab or that will support Google's latest OS, but that's almost never a problem with iPads. iOS releases are generally consistent and stable, the lone knock on Apple being its lack of Android-like customization.And while the Apps Store and iTunes are also battling competition from Microsoft's stores and Google's Marketplace, Apple's setup continues to set the bar, managing to be intuitive and easy to use and enjoying more and more high-profile digital releases.", "Title": "Apple is the Best!!!!", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Author": "Amy Leftis", "ReviewID": "R9JQAS7K7K0PK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Much faster than the original ipad.

After a few days of using the iPad Air and iPad 3 I can tell that an upgrade would not be worth the hassle of putting my older iPad on ebay and making up the difference which would be around $300 I guess (I have the 16 GB version) . Actually, a lot of professional reviewers online recommend exactly this: don't upgrade if you already have either an iPad 3 or iPad 4.The difference in size and weight is (slightly) noticeable when you are picking the device or holding it in your hands. The thing is that I never just hold my iPad in my hands when using it (and I do use it a lot!). Most of its weight goes either to the desk when I am at my desk, or to my lap if I am in my chair, or to my chest if I am on my couch. Which means I am basically using my hand(s) to balance the iPad not to support it. In such situations extra 7 ounces is not a big deal at all.If you are using your iPad differently (for example, playing games a lot) then you might appreciate the iPad Air better. Also, if you just want to have the latest and the coolest iPad then of course that would be worth it too :)Seems like Apple is following the same pattern with both the iPad 2 and the iPad Air, mostly squeezing the same device in a smaller package. This is not good enough for me. I waited until the iPad 3 came out to upgrade my iPad 1 (yes, Retina display was totally worth it!) and I hope that the iPad 6 will be worth an upgrade. But I am not getting into the hassle of replacing my iPad just to get a little bit thinner/narrower and lighter.Making the decision to return the iPad Air got even easier when I realized that its screen has a noticeable yellow tint which makes my iPad 3 look a bit bluish which I like better.Good bye, iPad Air, and lets hope that Apple will be able to impress even the most conservative of us with the iPad 6 in October 2014! (Speaking of being conservative, I am still using IOS 6 on my iPad - it is better to be safe than sorry! :)", "Title": "For those who are still thinking about upgrading from the iPad 3", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Author": "Harold D.

It is lighter, thinner, narrower, faster and has stereo speakers. Its almost half a pound lighter which really makes a difference when holding the ipad in your hands for long periods of time. I no longer need to use my ipad stand. Typing and holding it in portrait mode are much easier. People with larger hands will be able to hold the ipad with one hand very easily. Performance is also much improved with new A7 processor. Apps open, close and switch faster than on the ipad 4. Wifi is now double the speed with the double mimo antenna. For those who have supporting routers loading web pages, downloading apps, books, videos, music is much faster. The new stereo speakers are much loader and have more bass than on the previous ipad. The stereo affect will only be noticed when holding the iPad in portrait mode. This is a shame since you wont enjoy the stereo affect when watching a video or playing a game in landscape mode. Also the speakers are very easy to muffle if you cover one or both of them on the right side in landscape mode. The main flaw of the ipad air is its lack of 2GB of ram. When browsing and having more than a few tabs open this is very noticeable. The tabs have to reload when switching back and forth. This also becomes an issue when switching between apps that are open. Both the ipad 3 and 4 had 2GB of RAM. The only reason I can think of why apple decided not the upgrade the RAM is to make customers upgrade to the next ipad. The other downside to the ipad air is the fact that its running ios 7. ios 7 for the most part is in improvement over ios 6. It is faster and has more features, but, it also has many bugs that still need to be fixed. Even with 7.04 installed I still experience rotation issues. The ipad doesnt auto rotate when switching between portarit and landscape mode. This issue occurs atleast once a day. Mainly when the multitasking gestures is enabled and auto rotation. There are many threads on apple discussions forums about this issue. I thought at first my ipad was deffective even made an appointment to see a genius. I was told there was no way to test the hardware but was offered a warranty replacment. I decided instead to exchange the ipad and the replacement also had the same issue. I have to add also my ipad 4 had the same issue also when I updated it to ios 7. I hope apple fixes this issue in 7.1. This is very annoying and not something I expected from apple. The ipad air also doesnot have the ability to run 2 or more apps at one time which both the new samsung note 10.1 2014 and Microsoft surface tablet can do. I did try the samsung tablet briefly and found the screen and speakers much better than the ipad air's. The ipad still is the best larger tablet on the market because it has a huge selection of tablet apps and it gets the apps first before any other platform. I also love the battery life on my ipad air. I was getting about 15 hours of usage on my ipad 4 with the brightness at 35% and about 5 notifications with browsing and email. Now with the ipad air I am gettting more than 15 hours. Anywhere from 16-18 hours of battery life depending on my usage. The new ipad air is must have for gamers, power users and people who take the ipad on the go. If you can wait the next ipad will defeintly have 2GB of RAM and wont have as many bugs. There is also a good chance a new ipad will be released in the next 1-2 years which will be larger in screen size and more powerful named the ipad pro.Update after owning for more than 4 months: Apple just released the 7.1 update. My iPad Air is finally stable, this is what ios 7 should have been from the start. There are no more crashes, reboots and the auto rotation issue is fixed. I am still giving this ipad 4 stars since it took apple more than 4 months to fix these issues. Also the ipad lacks 2gb of ram, there are no widgets, thrid party keyboards, expandable storage or way to run 2 apps at once side by side. The iPad Air is till the best 10 inch tablet on the market. It beats any android or microsoft tabelt currently on the market in the 10 inch category. Also it has the most tablet apps.", "Title": "Almost perfect besides the lack of RAM and some iOS 7 bugs", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Author": "Diane Allen", "ReviewID": "R95SPR015HRY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What an amazing ipad!

In hindsight, I\u2019m glad I did otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have bought this tablet.Before deciding on the iPad Air I considered the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7. The Microsoft Surface wasn\u2019t an option since I really don\u2019t like the operating system or customer service and I wanted my tablet to last longer than a year. Samsung wasn\u2019t an option after the torture my Galaxy S3 put me through, which also ruled out Android, which then ruled out the Nexus 7. Some people are a fan of Android but I find it to be slow, unreliable and choppy. The aesthetic design isn\u2019t my favorite either. But these are all a matter of personal opinion and experience. :)The Kindle Fire HDX looked great at first, but in the end I decided it wasn\u2019t for me. I\u2019m a writer and a student so being able to edit documents on the go is my main concern. I have an iMac so this unfortunately made using the Kindle for these purposes a little more difficult for me. While I can edit and share most documents on my iMac, including Microsoft Office, I primarily use Pages which isn\u2019t available on the Kindle. I just don\u2019t care for either Microsoft Word or Google Docs enough to use them all the time. Also, I never use the Amazon store to watch movies or shows or download music so that feature wasn\u2019t appealing to me. I took a trip to Best Buy to try it out just in case that made me change my mind. This actually solidified my decision against it. While the Kindle Fire did feel surprisingly solid, I didn\u2019t like the position of the buttons, smaller screen size (although the screen quality was pretty awesome) or the thick boarders around the screen. Again, all of these are a matter of preference.When I went to try out the iPad Air I was surprised by how much lighter it felt than the previous model iPad. I also liked the flat back and thinner edges on the side. It made using it easier for small handed people like me. The larger screen size made typing on the tablet much easier in those rare instances I might not have my keyboard. Keeping my documents in one place is amazingly simple and I like the applications I use for writing and classes. Also, iTunes U is just awesome!The only drawback for me is the price: I paid $300 more than I would have with the Kindle Fire HDX. I don\u2019t think this is outrageously expensive, considering the larger screen, better hardware, operating system and customer service-- not to mention iTunes U-- but I do think the price could be lower.While there are other great tablets out there, I really enjoy my iPad Air. Electronics are all a matter of personal preference anymore anyway. If you don\u2019t like a device, don\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s that simple. :)", "Title": "I\u2019m glad I did otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have bought this tablet", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Author": "Nik", "ReviewID": "RUSB2R1PF1O2T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this brand new iPad Air 64 GB from TechGiant(Amazon).

I loved my ipad 2 had it for 2 years it never skipped a beat. But know that I have the ipad air it's in a whole new ball park I wouldn't even say that the ipad 2 is even close to the ipad air. Performance wise I do a lot of multi tasking and it doesn't even break a sweat. The picture is brilliant very clear and crisp. The size and structure are amazing light and beautiful very sharp. It fits in your hands like a glove. It has a great camera for a tablet you wouldn't believe the pictures I have taken with this thing I get a lot if compliments all the time. As for its competitors the samsung note 10.1 2014 edition, the structure of this ipad blows it away. Know Samsung has its own perks that Apple doesn't offer but I would still say its a fair superior product then the note. That being said I do own a galaxy s4 smart phone and I absolutely love it I just prefer my phone to have a bigger screen,and it has it's other perks as well. mainly the galaxy gear watch sealed the deal for me.

Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about. If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game). Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\". Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems. It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay. Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together. The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online. Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading web pages. As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the Daily Mail Online).* Reading Books. It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages. Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films. I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Watching TV. With the free BBC iPlayer app you can catch up or download BBC programs* Reading and replying to mail. I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos. Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games. From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio. With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.* Listening to music. I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* Editing Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents using FREE App \"QuickOffice\" (owned and supported by Google).* Editing Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents (Office for the Apple) on the FREE Apple apps.* The list goes on and on.Update: You can edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents (plus Pages, Numbers and Keynote) on the iPad (although I'd recommend an external keyboard - see below). It's definately powerful enough, although I'd not expect these apps to cope with REALLY complex document layouts. Great for general letter and document writing though.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus 7 which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen. If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay. Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet. A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen. Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air. Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference). Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options. The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store or John Lewis (which I would highly recommend), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory: Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc). However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+\u00a380 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air). But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads. Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out. Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular: Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about. This will add an additional +\u00a3100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card. This means (for an additional \u00a37-15 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move. Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover. Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it. There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen. Apple charge from \u00a335 to \u00a365 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from \u00a310. Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard (\u00a325-80), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor). I'd recommend the Logitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Greyand the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard - Black although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully. For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone. Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip. Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including+ iMovie - edit and publish home made movies+ Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad+ Pages - Word processor+ GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit+ iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat. As \"Which?\" magazine (in the UK) put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested. Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart. If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Title": "Incredibly light, fast and beautiful.

At 467g the Air redefines computer portability and is so lightweight it's hard to tell whether you're carrying it in your bag or have in fact forgotten it, without looking to check. The Air has a fast A7 chip and the screen is a useful 9.7 inches; it's a breeze to use. The design of the graphics is so intuitive that any child or technophobe can master it and feel at home in a few minutes, which makes it the perfect entry-point into IT for someone who has so far avoided computers.One of the clever things Apple have done is the creation of the individual `Apple ID' which means once you enter your ID & password your iPad, iPhone, iPod and Mac immediately share all their files, and everything you created or stored on one device becomes available on them all: photos, music, reminders, address book, documents are all shared. This is probably the most brilliant idea ever in the IT mass market to create brand loyalty among consumers and `locks you in to the corporation for the duration'.Now, the bad news: the software crashes from time to time necessitating a reboot, which is annoying and inconvenient. This fault is acknowledged by Apple, as the software has a few bugs. Also the wireless reception is not all it might be, as it sometimes (mysteriously) fails to connect to even a moderately strong signal.Apple's pricing structure does not reflect the cost of manufacture but is driven by a market segmentation strategy, so the price really cranks up if you want an iPad with more memory or which can use the GSM phone network. The best value is the 16G Air without Cellular, which only connects to the internet via WiFi. 16G is a lot of memory by the historic standards of portable computers and you'll only find it insufficient if you want to store a lot of big files like films or powerpoint presentations.You'll need a carrying case to protect it (scores of different designs are available) and maybe a keyboard, which if you're doing a lot of writing and document creation rather than just surfing the internet is the one essential accessory, as without a separate keyboard the usable screen area is reduced in size. Around one million downloadable apps for Apple devices means you can personalize your iPad and make it into more or less whatever you want. The Air design is aesthetically a work of beauty in its simplicity, cleanness of lines and proportion, and despite some irritating niggles is a pleasure to own and use.", "Title": "The future is a breeze", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Author": "joedc831", "ReviewID": "RAIJ37X44JFHX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "They have a 10-15% restocking fee for returns that is not easily found on Amazon's website.

It's tv quality display unlike the laptop or regular computer screen that is not visible if you are standing off to the side or too far away.I still hate touch screen tablets preferring the keyboard control of laptops but I have no regrets about this family purchase.  It does load internet pages faster and it does have the best display I have ever seen (but we are not a high tech wares household).  You can see the images from different angles from distances unlike how you need to position yourself to view a laptop screen.  So basically the high price can be somewhat justified in that for the price of a really good laptop - you can get a tv quality screen.  If the iphone had come out with a bigger screen like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, I wouldn't have supported the purchase of this device and I would have been wrong about that but my brother has been sick and this makes him happy every day when he holds it - he smiles to himself.  After a few weeks of holding it carefully in a plastic bag!, we finally got the nearest perfect case for it: the i-Blason Apple iPad Air / iPad 5 ArmorBox Kido Series Light Weight Super Protection Convertable Stand Cover Case (Black).  I wanted the Speck handyshell of the Tylt stand but I as wrong.  The iblason folds under making it sturdier and better especially on a bed.We have screen protectors on front and back because this looks like the iphone 5s in that it is prone to scratches.We went with 64 gb after deciding on the 32 gb because nevermind Apple's profit margins, it was worth a hundred dollars more to prolong the life of this device.  Hopefully, this will be the only ipad we ever own.  We know people who still have their one and only ipad 2.This is another nonremovable battery so don't overcharge it.  You need to break out the included adapter because it's designed to be powerful enough to charge this ipad.  Iphone adapters will probably give you the message that the device is \"not charging\" after lighting up for a few seconds with the charging symbol when you first plug it in.It is thin but it is like a hard wafer - so it still FEELS thick in some ways - but it turns out one pound FEELS heavy to us so we didn't mind putting a fat case on it and ruin the thinness of it.  For the first few weeks without a cover, it didn't feel like that comfortable in the hand but then neither did the iphone 5s without a case.Holding something thin like the Air or the 5S does not make the device feel grounded but I definitely do not prefer the ungrabbability of the laptop - it is always a chore to haul a laptop.I don't doubt after living with the Air that Apple will be putting out much bigger Ipads in the future - it's the grab and go quality that is the selling point and we need bigger screens - this will then cut into Roku's competitiveness because Apple WILL put out an Ipad that is just large enough to make owning a tv set nonessential - it just needs to be bigger enough to be a few feet from the eyes.  Apple TV has real competition in the Roku but a bigger Ipad would not only be a laptop killer but it could make flat screen tvs less important.***********you can stop reading if you just need to decide if this is a good device - it is.  It also happens to be exponentially more expensive than Android and Windows tablets.The Apple walled garden feels BIG - it doesn't feel like the Android one which makes you feel like you went the a la carte route - you got a removable battery and removable memory with your device and you're feeling clever about saving money but the trade off is that you always have to scramble and you are NEVER SURE that you got everything covered (think of Apple as frustrating and expensive American citizenship as opposed to being a citizen of the European Union - Apple SUX!)  Android is missing apps and you notice when shopping at apps that it doesn't feel like the Apple App Store on the device - it doesn't feel like you have almost internet-size reach within the Apple universe.  It doesn't give you the feeling that you are receiving the goods first.  Android updates can be wonky and there is no accountability there - Samsung just apologizes if bad code screws up their phones that you now own and those updates with the unappetizing names that only sound good in theory but are all frankly, DREADFUL foods are never guaranteed for your particular device.  It feels like there is no recourse, no genius bar, nothing if there is malware or some other software problem.I'm not happy at all with Apple because of the nonremovable battery and the tough luck attitude if you plunk down way too much money BUT I can't trust the Android products at all BY THEIR VERY NATURE.  Google themselves won't refund their own branded devices after 14 days.  Am I supposed to head out to their California headquarters and beg for some customer service?  It doesn't matter if Apple stores don't make the majority of the sales  - they indicate a commitment to the customer.I'm always afraid Samsung is going to fold when it is no longer profitable for them - chaebols do do that.  I honestly don't think Google and Motorola are seriously interested in taking away from the Appleverse.  The Appleverse is the alternative, the break time from working on Microsoft computers.I would think the Android devices after they stopped getting updates would be as useful as the gameboy or nintendo ds toys in the back of the drawer somewhere.I'm not an Apple fan but I don't think Android has a shot despite offering removable batteries and memory sometimes which are extremely important especially for work-related data.*****************************The Apple Store lets you buy gift cards or coinstar receipts to pay.  Sony wants your credit card information even after they \"got\" hacked and released all the credit card information of its accounts.  Microsoft is only slightly better.  It's arrogant to force us to lose our financial privacy and security to access a device that we paid for.****************Who do you want to have access to too much of your personal information?I don't want ANY Of my stuff on ANY cloud especially if it is work related.  The internet-enabled devices are getting way more myserious, inaccessible and way slicker in the way they are not providing a description of what they do, how they do it, what is entailed, etc.  It's all ... hazy like a CLOUD.The internet access and the access of the apps to the owner's information makes me very uncomfortable which is why I see this as an entertainment device and not a work one  - it is impossible to look under the hood and control this thing - it takes the user for the ride - we are NOT in the driver's seat with these devices but that is also another reason to go American (that means Windows, Android Motorola/Google or Apple) and Apple and Windows are the ones with more closed systems but they're not perfectly secure.I think Siri indicates that not only are they recording our voices but they digitized them and broke down our voices into code not for recognizing our COMMANDS - but that means Siri could probably say something you never uttered in your voice.  The touchscreen could have been a fingerprint collector all along and the camera - well, I'm sure it is always on.**************Apple's litigation against Samsung is big news this week and if Samsung has been allowed to make money (it may be the only competitor who has something to show for its efforts) then it may have been in on it which means it can shut off the lights on their android devices and just sell big appliances because Apple's legal wins have huge implications.  It let competitors (usually foreign) copy (mostly for android - the name \"android\" doesn't really invite confidence thanks to Blade Runner and I, Robot) and if Apple is now suing Samsung successfully for copying - that means Apple didn't strike until there was something they could get back financially and it also means that Apple can damage you enough so that all your years of efforts will be for naught.  Those sunk costs - that's the poison.So I wonder - what if Apple sues in the home countries - the ban is for Samsung sold in the US.  What would Korean courts do about a lawsuit by Apple in Korea?  Does that make Sony Experias vulnerable in Japan?  What about Nokia now owned by Microsoft in Finland and in Italy one of Nokia's strongest markets?  What about the touchpad controller on the Playstation 4?Three days from the anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Comedy Central is reairing South Park episodes on 12/4/13 in this order:HumancentiPad - not only about the actual war crimes committed upon civilians and POWs by Mengele and Unit 731 but also about Apple's originality AND their dominant attitude towards their rightsfollowed byA Song of Ass and Fire which reiterates the claim made in Black Friday that the selling point of the Playstation 4 is the touchpad interface.Apple can pull the litigation trigger at ANY TIME and because they already won with Samsung, Sony's attorneys are not going to be able to drag out much of the issues of the lawsuit so that the Playstation 4 can sell for as many years as its predecessors.Holy Moses.", "Title": "fast, great display, expensive - the professional reviews aren't wrong - especially about how there is not much new to say", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Author": "Timothy M.
