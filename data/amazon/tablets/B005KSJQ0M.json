Then you power up the tablet, then record your video. Then you power down, remove the mic, and power up and watch your video.It causes a momentary short when you insert the plug when the unit is powered up, which shuts down the recorder.Other than that, I like it. SD slot and USB and removeable battery are good.", "Title": "Good tablet.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "ProductID": "B005KSJQ0M", "Features": null, "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41zPVbGlyBL._SX300_.jpg", "Name": "Toshiba Thrive At100-002 10.1\" Tablet Pc 16 gb Wifi"}}
