The Wi-Fi is weak, even in the same room as the router. There also is no way that I have found to upgrade the OS. The touch sensitivity on the screen is so sensitive that you just have to get close to the letter, and most the time you get double letters. It works ok to watch youtube videos, and check email, but not much else.", "Title": "Not too good", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Author": "desiree dopwell", "ReviewID": "R2I8BDVJKROXF2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product is excellent for the kids.
