{"Reviews": [{"Author": "SINnWo", "ReviewID": "R3L803F8ISPTDF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my TF300 for a few days now.  Based on reviews here, I'll start by stating what I have and have not experienced based on other's feedback.I have not experienced the screen flickering issue.I have not experienced the volume of force closes like most people.I have experienced issues with Google Play (Market) not responding.There is a little bleed at the bottom corners of the screen, but not as bad as others have stated.The back of my tablet has very little give, so maybe those who can bend it had ones with manufacturing defects?The screen does show finger prints/smudges after use, but what smartphone/table doesn't?  My fix for this was to put a matte finished screen protector on.  Reduces glare too.Yes, very little accessories for this guy, but cases will be coming out soon.  I pre-ordered the TF300 dual view rooCase from Amazon.  Really all you need is an extra charger, memory card, and the keyboard doc if that suits your needs.Here are my pros and cons:PROS:1.  Great value for the price.  Can't beat what you get for $390.  Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 doesn't have the same horse power as the TF300.2.  Screen is great from my perspective.  720p native screen, good resolution.  Didn't have issues with video or pictures and no color saturation.3.  Volume rocker and power buttons are in the right place with the right exposure and feedback when pressed.  You'd be surprised how many other tablets do a crappy job with wobbly buttons or buttons that are not exposed enough.4.  Battery life is superb.  With 2 hours of usage watching live tv, doing work email, calendar updates, downloading apps, and customizing the tablet, only 19% of the battery was used.  Screen brightness was set to roughly 40%.5.  It's fast.  If you want to compare how fast it really is in person, go to Best Buy and send 2 pictures from your smartphone via bluetooth to some other tablets.  Open the gallery and look how fast it renders your pictures for the first time.  Then repeat on the TF300.  I didn't find anything out there that really compared.  Picture/Video rendering is one of the most processor intensive tasks you can do on a tablet.6.  GPS WORKS AND PINPOINTS YOUR LOCATION QUICKLY.  A co-worker of mine tested in the car while we were driving and tethered to a Galaxy Nexus for data.  It took 28 seconds.CONS:1.  After booting up, it takes roughly a minute for everything to become fully responsive.  Pretty annoying.  I know this can be fixed in a software update.2.  Google Play app force closes and waits too much.  Should be fixed in a software update.3.  Stock Email widget doesn't work.  Says App is not installed when it is, it's part of the Android OS and the Email app works just fine.  Should be fixed in a software update.  Big issue for me.4.  Not much bloatware, but there are still a few apps like Zinio that I want to uninstall (not just disable).  Should have the option to do that without needing to root.Few other pointers:1.  CHARGE IT FIRST.  It doesn't need to charge a full 8 hours, but at least give it 3 hours before determining if it is dead.  Mine arrived with 13% battery life.2.  Before you do anything, turn on WiFi and download the latest firmware update.  It's available for a reason.All in all I really like this tablet.  I've been in the market to buy a tablet since November of last year and skipped out on the Prime.  I believe I made the right choice.  4 stars because of the stock email widget not working out of the box.  Otherwise, I'd give it 5 even with the minor issues I've had.  Read other tablet reviews, you'd be amazed at how crappy other company's release software for their tablets.UPDATE: A new firmware update rolled out today May 18.  Fixes Google Play issues and overall performance of the tablet.  I am updating this review from the tablet.  Much smoother. Email widget is still broken so 4 stars still.UPDATE 2:  Factory reset fixed the email widget problem.  Thankfully I had Google backup turned on so everything restored quickly and effortlessly!

Russ \"Doc Brown\"", "ReviewID": "RJGNISFHQZBFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been the best investment I've made so far! Ill just get right to the pros and cons.Pros:*Excellent at playing .m4v HD bluray rips with no lag whatsoever! Even hooked it up to my tv via the HDMI port and it was a breeze!*Connected my external harddrive (ext. HDD > powered usb 3.0 hub > USB kit ASUS USB Kit for Eee Pad Transformer TF101, TF101G, TF201 & TF300 Tablets > the tablet) and it played the movies from it as well. Tested AVI, MKV, M4V, WMV, MOV with no problems.*With the harddrive connected, I was able to connect a keyboard and mouse too!*The stylus which I already had, works as expected. Makes Draw Something a bit easier.*Battery life is better than I expected!!! WITH all the things I had hooked up to it, played about 4hours worth of movies and when all sudden done, not even half of the battery was drained!*Tegra 3; the graphics are amazing! But there is a lack of games that are any good. Id like to see a good ol RTS instead of some sort of castle defenders type game.*Sound quality is OK with the inboard speaker, but with headphones or audio output thru HDMI is NOT lacking at all!! the M4V bluray digital copy of Iron Man 2 was FANTASTIC on this device!*Security: It has the option to encrypt your data and have you enter a pincode when you boot up to decrypt the data. Also options when you lock the screen for pattern/pin/passcodeCons:*The Web Browser, yep, just like everyone else, and with every android device just about since 2.3, its a bit sluggish on here too. Its not enough to be a deal breaker for me, but it does get frustrating when it crashes.*Glare, the screen has a horrible glare when your outside or there is a light behind you. Does give it a nice sleek shine.*A few older apps crash, only because they haven't been written for ICS so that's not a deal breaker for me.*System slows down when multiple apps are using resources. IE AndFTP transferring files while Pandora, Facebook and a game are running. I suspect it has something to do with the I/O handling. Dunno if its hardware or software side tho. Not the greatest at multitasking but were past Windows 3.1 or Android 1.2 ;)*Lack of Accessories. I'm waiting around for a good hard case to put this thing in as I'm afraid to break it! Its SO FLIMSY! as for now I keep it wrapped in an old sweater packed in an old laptop bag.Tests to come:Skype--I have no friends :/ So maybe someday i can test out how it handles video conferencing.Gamepads wired and wireless.--Such as the xbox controller for windows. Ive read that this tablet does support a wide variety and a few, VERY few reports that the xbox 360 gamepad for windows DOES work on the Transformer series.ODB2 diagnostics and a full fledged in car setup.Anything else, just ask and I can test it out.As the writing of this, there is no support for Windows OS as the bootloader is locked. Microsoft is working on support for the Tegra 3 processor in Windows 8 and ASUS has unlocked bootloders for the past Transformers. So its not out of the question yet.Final verdict: ITs worth the price!", "Title": "I dont know what ppl are complaining about.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Author": "Dee", "ReviewID": "RK3KSUWHIF4B3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got my cool, red 32GB TF300T on September 17th.  Was super excited and at first loved using it.After about a week, the touchscreen would occasionally freeze and require a reboot to get going again.  Annoying, especially on a brand new device, but not critical.  However, the touchscreen issue became more frequent.  Before long, a reboot wouldn't get it going again and I had to cold boot Android.  That did work, for a while.Three weeks in, the touchscreen froze completely and no amount of rebooting, cold booting, or even letting the battery drain and recharging it would get it going again.  What I didn't realize was it was already past the return-by date.  Yes, you only have TWO WEEKS to return a defective unit, after that it's send it for repair and hope for the best.  I must have missed this when they didn't include a copy of the warranty in the box and when the link to the warranty for my product in my region was broken on their website.I called Asus customer support and they gave me an address for a local repair center.  I was willing to try, so I went and they took it in.  The repair took twice as long as they said it would, but it was returned with a replaced main board in apparently working condition.  Kind of a major repair needed there on a three week old product, but okay.Got it home and noticed two weird things: 1, it was running some kind of diagnostic ROM (it had diagnostic apps on it and there was a red border flashing around the screen sometimes.  Looked in the settings under tablet info and it said the system was running something called open-english-epad-a-bunch-of-numbers-testkeys instead of Android 4.0).  The next day, the battery stopped charging when plugged in, and the day after that the frozen touch screen issue recurred.  Totally dead, unusable device.  Again.I wrote to the Asus customer loyalty email address describing exactly my customer experience and increasing lack of loyalty to this brand and received a phone call recommending I take it to a different repair center.  They were also going to call ahead and tell them I was coming over.I took it to repair center #2.  They were indeed expecting me, they took the tablet in and asked if they could do a factory reset.  I said sure, but asked that they make sure to reinstall Android 4.0 ICS and NOT update to Jelly Bean because I'm not sure I want it yet.  OK, no problem, they said.I waited half an hour and they reset it and said it was working now.  I looked at it and checked in the settings, finding they had updated it to Jelly Bean even though I'd asked them not to.  They told me it was ICS that caused the problem and to accept the update.  I said no, I would update it if and when I chose to, and it was not their decision.  Besides, why would ICS be causing the problem when thousands of TF300s are running ICS just fine, and this particular device failed while running ICS AND their weird diagnostic ROM?  They finally agreed to roll it back for me and took it back in, returning 15 minutes later to say it was going to take 5 hours to download and flash the original ROM back to the device and could I come back tomorrow.I returned the next day and was told that the touchscreen failed again before they could reinstall ICS.  So, not exactly the ICS software issue they thought it was, huh?  Now they were going to order a new touchscreen and install it.  Right about now is when even the most patient customer is looking for a replacement device.  By this time I was getting pretty skeptical about their ability to perform a successful repair, but I agreed again to let them try.  They thought they could get it done by the following day and they would call me.The following day they did not call me, so I called them.  The lady told me they had not replaced the touchscreen, that they still believed it was a software issue and that they wanted to send it away for extensive testing.  Essentially they had no idea what the problem was, they also had no idea when the unit might be returned to me.  I said no.  I was not going to accept this software theory. It was obviously a defective device with hardware problems.  I said please repair it correctly ASAP or give me a new unit.  I was TIRED of waiting to use my tablet and TIRED of this seemingly endless servicing.  She said she'd call me back tomorrow.Again they did not call me back, so I went in today and asked them what was going on.  Now they're back to replacing the touchscreen, supposedly today or tomorrow.  Who knows whether or not this one will work.  I've asked them repeatedly to replace the device, but apparently that window closed two weeks after I received it.  No exceptions.  I'm left feeling that, even if there are an additional hundred failed repairs, they will not stand behind their product and replace it.I have had this device now for two months.  It has worked correctly for about 10 days.People have said that we should rate the device, not experiences with duds etc.  But I feel this experience is important for people considering purchasing this product.  There's some pretty serious evidence on this site and others that suggest this tablet has unusually poor quality control and perhaps is made with unreliable parts.  Even still, the specs are good and those without hardware issues love their TF300s, so cool.  No big deal.  This might be a one-off.  I'd probably agree, but with a customer service department that has no problem putting people in repair limbo and will not, under any circumstances, replace a defective unit returned less than a month after purchase, are you willing to take the risk?  In my experience, setting fire to $400 would have been faster and less frustrating because I sure haven't received a device I can use yet.I recommend you don't buy a TF300.  If I had a re-do I'd buy a Samsung.  Possibly it might be smart to stay away from Asus altogether, I can't say for sure.  All I know is that I won't buy any of their products in the future.Good luck,DeePS:  If you already have one and it gets glitchy, return it ASAP and hope it's soon enough to get a replacement under their micro-warranty.  Also, hope the new one isn't sketchy, too.  If it failed after 14 days and you have to go the repair route, all I can say is good luck.UPDATE:The screen has been replaced and is now working (mostly) normally.  There's a bug here or there, like a minute ago when I was typing and long strings of \" P\"s were randomly being typed into the body of my text.  I'm just going to pray like crazy it's no big deal because I REALLY don't want to go through the glacial service process again.Should I ammend my review?  Add stars?  I really don't think so.  The time between purchasing this device and being able to use it was two and a half months.  That's a serious fail.  And, I paid full price for a new unit and the one I received is now refurbished with at least two major parts having been replaced in some dusty Chinese repair bay (not racist, I live in Shanghai).Poor quality control, barely adequate warranty, difficult service scheme, really poor customer experience.  My review stands.  They should have replaced the unit for me after the first failed repair.  I don't recommend you take your chances with this device.If I had a do-over I'd go with Samsung.", "Title": "I Could Forgive the Bugs if There Was ANY Customer Support", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Author": "Keith LeDuc \"leduckut\"", "ReviewID": "R3CEAWBWWO4ZME", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok. Here goes.First of all, I am going to do a comparison to the Toshiba Thrive because this is the only other tablet I have owned and have previous tablet experience with.Second, I have only played with the unit for one evening, several hours, but only one evening so far. But, that said, I feel I messed with it enough to dispell alot of other reviewers complaints about the unit.Do you realize that alot of you are just too darned picky for these electronic gadgets these days? You expect that they should all be just perfect and perform to maximum specifications, especially if you have to pay say over about $200 for a product, you expect it to be GOLD! Come on people.I have now experienced what most of you are complaining about concerning \"light bleed\" and I can't believe that some of you actually returned the unit just fot that alone. Again I say...come on people. To compare it with the Thrive, which had no light bleed to speak of, I only noticed it when the screen first came on and is at it's brightest but once the background loads and the rest of the icons, the screen is beautiful! I don't get why so many of you return  your units just because of this issue! As long as there is something being displayed on the screen, and I kept mine set about half the brightness in doors because really, it was too bright beyond that. I tried letting the auto brightness configure it but in my darker bedroom, it kept setting the screen too dark and I found it much more pleasant being able to set the brightness manually. Now, with that said, alot of you complained about the colors appearing washed out compared to other units. Huh? I compared the screen with my Thrive...noticed NO difference. One has to remember that if you crank up the bightness all the way, then it tends to brighten the colors to a point where thay may appear to be washed out. So, maybe most of you need to not be so critical and just deal with turning the brightness down a little. I have yet to try it outside in the bright sun but as I have mentioned in other reviews, ANY LCD/LED device these days that is trying to be viewed out in the sun is almost impossible. I have my smart phone set to auto brightness so that when it is in the sun, it brightens the screen all the way up so you can at least see it enough to tell what is going on. But, you are talking about a brightness that causes warmth to our skins and can cause fires in other areas of the world and can give a person 3rd degree burns. So, my question is, how in the world does anyone expect their electronic devices to be able to withstand offering enough brightness to beat out the power of our sun??? Again...too critical.So, enough on the issues of the display for now.When I plugged the unit into the charger which by the way, mine came with about 5 feet of cable, as most of you were complaining that it only came with a 2 foot cable, when 5 feet is about standard people, anyway...the tablet automatically came on, booted, and after entering various information on the screen, it went immediately into a system firmware update. I was happy about that being all the reviews I read on problems with earlier firmware. Then once I entered my Google information, it immediately downloaded and updated all my google apps from the Google Play Store. That was kind of cool except I don't necessarily like all of them but I guess I will manually uninstall the ones I don't use at a later time.As far as the re-booting and problems with apps running, I must have used to tablet for a good 6 hours just clicking on and playing verious apps and didn't have a problem with not a one! I even did some internet browsing with the standard browser and really didn't see a hitch or a glitch that most of you mentioned. The only other thing I wanted to mention is I found the charger seems to get awfly warm. I hope that isn't a future issue as well. So, maybe it's just my luck and I ended up with a good tablet and not a malfuntioning one or maybe, as the days and weeks go by and I have a chance to check it out more, then I will come back and update this review.As far as the person or people complaining about the speaker? WOW! I mean, I am disappointed that it, they, are only set on the right side and not split on both right and left sides of the unit. But, with that said, even as tablet sound or specially compared to my Thrive and my cell phone, I found the sound to be full and rich much like a full sized stereo speaker. I was shocked but amazed at the sound. Asus really excelled engineering the sound to come out like it does. On the Thrive where the two speakers are seperated at the bottom of the tablet and especailly if you rest it on your body like lying on your bed with it on your stomach, the sound gets muffled and distorted. It also is very tinty and very cell phone sounding. But not on this tablet! Very full sound for a tablet and I can't complain at all. As far as the person complaining about covering the speaker(s) with your right hand...well for one, don't hold it that way. For another, I found that if you are able to hold it in a way that you can cup your hand around the speaker, much like I do with my cell phone, the sound is trajected towards the front and you can get really good and louder sound that way. But with this tablet, it truly isn't necessary.I hope I don't end up with a tablet, as some of you mentioned, that ends up rebooting all the time and has apps that can't run after some time. That is the worry that almost kept me from purchasing it. I wished at times some of you more critical people wouldn't write reviews because your opinions aren't close to how the unit actually functions and other people can't get a good idea of what the possibilities of the unit may have beyond a LITTLE bit of \"light bleed\".I'm only annoyed a little bit by the lack of instruction manuals these products provide for the consumer these days. The only thing included in the box is the tablet, the charger and cable, a soft cloth for the screen, and two small pamphlets, one in english and one in other languages. And, for a tablet with no media drive, you can't load a CD with a PDF file inside to read. No, you have to find that on line and download it and then make sure the Adobe Reader is up to date.I will miss the idea of being able to pop off the back panel, as with the Thrive, and change the color or being able to replace the battery. Actually the cover on the Thrive was a little difficult to pull off but once you did, snapping it back on was pretty easy. The Thrive did also offer standard USB and HDMI ports but to connect it to a computer, it could only be read when connecting it to the mini USB port so I guess, unless connecting it to a USB drive, the full size USB isn't really necessary.Other than the things I mentioned above, I feel it's a good solid unit. People complain about it being made out of plastic instead of metal. Again....WAY too critical. I didn't feel it felt flimsy at all and it was easy to hold onto. What isn't made out of plastic these days??? Even an item that is made or coated to look like metal...ISN'T METAL! I actually tried to bend it as some of you said mentioned could be done and I felt you must have had a way too tight grip on it because it doesn't really slide out of your hands that easy. Again...do I need to say it? If you are holding it so hard that you are actually squeezing in the corners, as I felt it wasn't really that easy to do, then you have some big hands and need to loosen up a bit!And to the person that complained about it being a fingerprint magnet? CLEAN YOUR HANDS before use! Have any of you owned any touch screen devices before? You either need to use a touch pen or stylis to avoid fingerprinting it. I found that this tablet doesn't show the fingerprints any worse than touching the Thrive or my smartphone, and that is after extensive touching icons and extensive sliding and moving my finger around. Besides, it does come with a soft screen cloth. Take a minute and wipe it off. It's either that or get a screen protector that doesn't show the fingerprints as much. But, be careful with that because, as with the Thrive, the Toshiba branded screen protectors, when removing them leave an indefinite sticky film behind on the glass which is very difficult to clean off. I ended up bringing mine to my work where they used and soaked the screen in the product Goo Gone and I don't know what else to clean it off. After a few hours they brought it back to me like new. Needless to say, because of that experience, I WILL NOT be using a screen protector on this unit, as long as I can stand it.Other than those things, I say I would recommend this table to a friend. Go ahead and buy it and try it. You just might like it. (Provided you get a good working unit, that is!)UPDATE! I know this was already a long winded review but I just wanted to leave a short update.I have used to tablet for over a week now. Other than the issue with the original browser now crashing, even after a system firmware update, I still feel the tablet is awesome. I did download Google Chrome Beta which seems to work just fine. A note to ASUS, I don't feel it's right for the company to expect users to download another browser if they are having issues with the stock one crashing. They should be doing the right thing and researching a fix for this issue. For me, updating the firmware didn't work. I thought it was going to be stable but the browser still crashes. I haven't had any issues with other programs crashing, even ones I used on my Thrive, with the older Android system, 3.2 I think. Everything seems to be golden, except for the browser. I also don't feel I'm getting the full usage out of the battery as advertised. That is even with some days of not very much extensive use that the brightness on the screen set to auto to dim in low light situations. Which I feel the video hardware should work oposite that way....the screen, to me, should lighten in low light situations and darken in very bright lighting situations. But, as I stated above, you also need a very bright screen in the sunshine in order to see the screen. Who knows. But other than that, it's a great tablet!", "Title": "I really really like it.

Brand new it ran fine, but every Asus update has slowed it down. It is now frustratingly slow and unreliable. I don't dare try to use it with a client as it NEVER works right when I really need it. I've done a factory reset and reloaded my apps twice and still it runs no better. I contacted Asus and they said to put only the apps I really need on it. That is a hugely stupid response when you tout a quad core processor and 32GB of RAM. I work for a tech firm and all the folks I asked about that agreed as to the incredibly bad response. If you add the one- and five-star ratings together, nearly 23% gave it one star. Would you buy any appliance or car that is hated by more than 20% of its owners? My Samsung Galaxy S4 runs circles around it. Avoid this tablet and Asus in general and you'll be happier. Why do I still have mine?

I used to use an ASUS netbook for school, and it was replaced by this tablet/dock combo.Performance: The tablet performs exceptionally well, and it hasn't really had a problem running any program I throw its way. Great for playing games, and all of the regular social networking stuff (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Flipboard, etc). I also used it for school work, and never had a problem. I used open-office or Polaris to open PDFs, powerpoint slideshows, and word documents with no problems. I typed up reports and was even able to edit notes in powerpoints during classes and I never really missed anything. I've even used this thing for a few presentations and it has never let me down (Micro-HDMI port and those cables can be cheap if you know where to look!).The real benefit though, is the battery life. With the dock, this thing can be used for about 14-16 hours continuously without having to charge. This is, to me anyways, unheard of! I have NEVER had to take the charger out of my home when taking this thing around with me. Even if you forget to charge it the day before (or even 2 days), you can squeeze out a 3rd day of heavy usage at times and you wouldn't have a problem.Wifi is pretty good, and can sometimes pick up a signal as good or better than my phone (I've used iPhone 4s, GS3, GS4, HTC One S, Z10, etc). Speakers also work really well, and can be fairly loud. When I go on trips, my friends use this to play music and we're never left wanting more.Good but not great: The screen. Great resolution, clear and bright colours. BUT, when you take it outside (or it is in direct sunlight) it can be difficult to read. For indoor use, this isn't really an issue, but for the rare and odd time I'm outside and happen to want to use the tablet, it isn't quite as bright as I'd like it. Still usable, but maybe could be better. I'm sure for the higher model (Transformer Prime), this isn't an issue, so this isn't really a complain as much as a wishlist item / suggestion.After a year of constantly clicking in and out of the keyboard, I haven't noticed any signs of wear. Still clicks in cleanly, and removes just as fast. The switch mechanism is flawless, and I can't think of a better system. Even holding from the screen and dangling the keyboard, there is really no give; great job on the design there!Keyboard is pretty good for the size, and I've never had a problem with it. This may be because I've used 2 netbooks prior to owning this tablet, so your mileage may vary in this regard. I would recommend trying it first if you've never used a keyboard on a 10inch laptop, because I'm sure some people out there may not like it or find it usable. You can also disable the trackpad, which I do on a regular basis, because sometimes just reaching out and touching the screen is faster. That being said, the trackpad does support gestures for scrolling and what-not, so if you feel like keeping your screen finger-print free, that's a suitable alternative for you.One thing that deserves special mention, however, is ASUS constant support for this tablet. In the year that I've had it, this thing has received updates REGULARLY! Something that is unheard of in most of the Android community, but something that I would commend ASUS for. Whenever a new version of Android comes out for the new nexus device (Nexus 4, 7, whatever) it seems like only days later the update will come to this tablet. Absolutely phenomenal support from these guys, and I would not hesitate to buy more devices from them in the future. In fact, I will probably almost exclusively buy devices from them now, seeing as my 3 year old netbook is still being used everyday by my little sister and has yet to have an issue with! There are already about 900 reviews for this product on Amazon, but ASUS earned my support here so I have no trouble in recommending them to friends and family.", "Title": "Great for the value, not much could be improved!", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Author": "D. Yanes \"ChowKaiDeng\"", "ReviewID": "R2LF1OYB9J6I0I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is almost a 1 year later review. I've got one of this for my wife and a Nexus 7 (v.1) for myself. We both use Nexus 4 smartphones, so this house it's pretty much full of Android devices. Many of my comments will compare this tablet against my Nexus 7 since they are both very similar tablets: except for the screen (similar resolution but the Nexus 7 has more ppi density than the ASUS TF300), the both have the same RAM and similar CPU/GPU speed and performance.OVERALL DESIGNAlthough I prefer the Nexus 7 smaller form factor, the ASUS Transformer it's definitely better for watching videos. The speakers on the ASUS TF300 are WAY MUCH BETTER than the Nexus 7 and the screen size is really great for this kind of tasks.Screen is very responsive but I feel that the plastic/glass surface is placed too far away from the LCD screen, so the touchness is \"different\" from other tablets or smartphones that I regularly use. Of course, this is a very personal feeling and it doesn't interfere at all with the responsiveness of the screen.The body of the tablet is very comfortable (rounded corners and smooth lines) and has a very decent design. Materials are good and resistant and is very well assembled (the Nexus 7 is not assembled as well as this). The tablet itself is not too heavy.The surface on the back has a concentric circles pattern which is really cool for improving the grappling, but is not nearly as good as the back of the Nexus 7 that has a different kind of material which emulates the feeling effect of a driving glove. My wife hates the back of the ASUS TF300 (we all have our obsessive-compulsive disorders) because of the noise that their fingernails make against it, but nevertheless, if you are like us and buy your device along with a case (strongly suggested: for this tablet, we got the Poetic StrapBack Protective Case for Asus Transformer TF300 along with a MoKo Invisible Screen Protector Films for ASUS Transformer Pad TF300) you won't notice any of this since the case covers the back of the device.Buttons are well placed and very easy to press.Charger is small and cable is long enough (another improvement over the damn short cable of the Nexus 7) to use the tablet directly hooked to the wall socket.SPEED AND PERFORMANCEFor a tablet originally released on May 2012 (I'm writing this review on September 2013) its overall speed is very good but not the best on the market. I'm talking about 1 or 2 seconds (sometimes) while loading apps or half a second while switching apps. Maybe it's a software issue, because this ASUS TF300 is currently running Android 4.2.1 (still, one of the latest) while my Nexus 7 it's a little faster (just a little) and runs on the last 4.3.Just to make sure: this IS NOT A SLOW or crappy generic tablet. It's a very good one but is not the fastest you could get. Comparing the ASUS TF300 with My Nexus 7, I feel the same as comparing my Nexus 7 to my Nexus 4 (the Nexus 4 is faster than both tablets).Videos and typing tasks run smooth. No lags and it doesn't hang. We don't play too much games on our tablets, but they run smooth as well (even heavy 3D games).HDMI, CAMERAS AND MICRO-SDFor me, the three main features of the ASUS T300 over the Nexus 7 are the Micro HDMI port, a rear 8MP camera and the Micro SD slot. I can't talk about the Micro HDMI port and Micro SD slot because we haven't used them, but it's really great to know that you can get more of your tablet, like connecting it to a Video Beam for a lecture or presentation (or just to watch a movie on a bigger screen).We got the 32GB model, that is more than enough for most of the tasks that you'll want to do on a tablet (that's the reason we haven't tested the Micro SD yet). Compared to the Nexus 7 8GB, this is a major diference: I'm constantly out of disk space with my 8GB tablet and have to clean old files / unused apps constantly.The rear camera is the second major improvement over the Nexus 7 (v.1) that doesn't have a rear camera at all. Of course, this kind of devices are not made to use them as photo cameras, but you can certainly take pretty decent photos and record HD videos. The front camera in both devices are pretty much the same low quality and work mostly for videochats.BATTERY LIFEMy wife is not a heavy user as me with her tablet, but the ASUS TF300 definitely has a great battery life. She never runs out of battery while on the street, neither do I with my Nexus 7.ADDITIONSIf you type A LOT in your table and use it for work, you could get the ASUS Transformer Pad Mobile Dock TF300T which is phisycal keybord that can be attached to the tablet, converting it on a full Netbook (and extending the battery life as well). We didn't bought it (it's on our Wishlist), but the reviews are pretty good.OVERALL CONSThe first thing I really don't like about this tablet is its lack of a standard Mini USB port, both for charging and connectivity. All of our other gadgets use the same USB port, so it's very easy to exchange cables or even chargers, and if you are somewhere else and need to send a heavy file to a desktop PC, it's always more comfortable and fast to do it over a MiniUSB-to-USB cable that most people have on their desks, rather than WiFi. Of course, you can always carry your own cable and charger with you.The second thing that this tablet could have, it's a magentic sensor to turn off the screen while using protective cases. My Nexus 7 has this function and it's really great to be able to close the case cover that automatically turns off the screen. With the ASUS TF300 you have to manually switch the screen off (or wait until it goes off automatically after a few seconds).CONCLUSIONRight now, this tablet it's still a pretty good deal if you wan't the save some money. Compared to the Nexus 10 -which is somewhat  on the same price/specs range- the ASUS TF300 it's about 20% cheaper, and compared to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 it's still cheaper (and with better specs). I think ASUS made this tablet to last for at least a good 3 years.This tablet is really goodfor reading, browsing the web (always over WiFi, because IT DOESN'T HAVE A SIMCARD SLOT FOR 3G ACCESS), typing and watching videos. You won't be disapointed.If you are more towards the Nexus 7 idea, then you could save even more money. But, in this case, after 1 year of use and the lack of rear camera and limited disk space / no micro SD slot, I strongly suggest you to get the new Nexus 7 v.2 (FHD), which solves the camera and disk space problems of the Nexus 7 v.1. Just notice that if you are accustomed to 10-inch tablets, you may feel the Nexus 7 too small. Personally, I like it over any 10-inch tablet, precisely for it's easy to handle size and lightweight.Most important: anything yo do, just don't get one of those cheap generic tablets.

I am not experienced in technology or computers/tablets. But you must get this tablet if you are tired of sitting at the PC all the time and especially if you are like me and tired of looking at the tiny screen on your Blackberry (yes, I said Blackberry). I am anti-Apple after having read an article in Playboy about the company and their financial shadiness. This was previously compounded by my personal desire not to follow the herd and rumors of Jobs' trying to monopolize the ebook world.The only thing that I do not love about this tablet is that I have not figured out how to get the Adobe Flashplayer to work on it. (and yes, I don't want to use GOOGLE) Of course, I have not enlisted the help of any tech guru's on this matter, yet. So I am still holding out hope that it can be accomplished.I bought the matching keypad...LOVE. (Great screenshot button on it!) I also bought a matching case that seperates for the keypad detachment!! Of course i also purchased a wi-fi router for the home and a usb stick (TONS OF MEMORY! on the stick and tablet capability)I pretty much keep my tablet on the cord whether the keypad is on or off, so I can not speak of the battery life. But I am betting that it will do the time specified in specs.I have not seen any \"light spots\" on the screen. I do not even notice the fingerprints on the screen until the tablet is asleep or off. (It did come with a little wipe rag, which does the trick with a few swipes)The tablet was easy to connect my MSN and Hotmail accounts to. I also found it easy to set Bing  (blasphemer!! lol) as my internet search engine.  I have not figured out how to get rid of bookmarks that I don't use or care to, but that may just be my technical savy at work.The apps are constantly improving so there a few pesky updates, but they all download quickly. My co-worker gushes aobut how he can control his entertainment center for his home on an Android app so i bet that you could too!) I am not big into games but a few days after getting the tablet I was shooting zombies and feeding JAWS! But I still tend to go to socializing and other internet sites on the original pages instead of using the apps...Basically, BUY IT! You won't be sorry, I'm betting.  lol (oh and PS there is a previous reviewer named Micheal who seems to be very skilled at answering any questions you have :)  )***EDIT 12/23/2012***[...]*scroll down to FLASHPLAYER ARCHIVES FOR ANDOID 4.0* select the first link to 11.1 for ANDROID 4.0 (11.1.115.34)*downloadI believe this did the trick. I dont remember what i was trying to use the flashplayer on. but i believe it was a website with a video on the page. And that worked after i downloaded this player.:)On a side note, it took quite a while to figure out how to cut-n-paste the link here. *phew* That could be a bit easier. It is a combo of using the mousepad on the detachable keyboard and selecting copy or paste from the scree.  aaargh. But of course i am used to windows cut-n-pasting with the mouse. Just have to do it a few times to get used to it, probably. Also, note that my capitalization lacks a little...keyboard it a little hard to get used to after having mostly only used a full sized PC. But I had same issue when work gave me a laptop for a while.  :(***EDIT 02/21/2013***I am noticing light leaks on the left edges of my screen.

So it definitely has to be a hardware issue. Having not treated the tablet roughly and having had it in a case since I started using it I would have to say that I just got a ticking bomb that just went off.If I rest the tablet flat with my hand in the middle or on a table it seems to freak out. If I hold the bottom left corner (when horizontal) it seems to function fine. However I can't hold it like that for long as it isn't comfortable. Once I release that corner it freaks out. Faulty manufacturing has to be the issue here.Asus customer service (after jumping through a few hoops) can't guarantee the will fix or replace it for free so having to ship this device back to the US via FedEx with damage insurance and then paying shipping cost back seems like a big gamble. The money would likely be better spent buying a new a completely different table from a different manufacture in the near future.That said I cannot recommend this or any other Asus product to anyone, *especially* if they live outside of the United States. The review is left at two stars because I purchased two of these tablets. One for me and my girlfriend and her's seems to still be working fine for now.-------------------------------EDIT 26/2/2013: For the last week the tablet has suddenly decided to launch applications on it's own or even type random letters while I try to use the keyboard to send a message. It's not limited to any one application as it even tries to re-size videos while I am watching them through MX Player. Even after doing a factory restore with limited application icons on the screen it will now try to change the wallpaper, which is suppose to happen when you tap and hold on the home screen. Seeing as I am not doing this it just seems the tablet has started to freak out.On checking forums it seems many others have had this issue after use and also straight out of the box. My tablet has not been dropped or damaged in anyway recently, so there is no known cause for this other than possible hardware issues. It has had the latest firmware update for a while with no issues until now.Thankfully I have not had the cracking screen issues some warned me about, but with the tablet randomly acting up after just a few months of use I can't safely recommend that anyone buys this or any other Asus tablet until this issue can be resolved. Unfortunately in checking with Amazon's return policy I am only able to get a partial refund, which could be nothing much at all.-------------------------------OLD REVIEW:Everyone loves the new iPad(3), but not everyone can afford one. Also some people want to do more with their tablet than Apple allows. You know stuff like connect external devices, transfer files, watch various video formsts and add more storage space. If you fall under that category then the Asus Transformer TF300 is the tablet for you.The TF300 is the budget version of the Asus Transformer TF700, which is their premium tablet. However the most major changes are that the back is made of a very sturdy and ribbed plastic rather than metal and the screen is not as bright as the TF700. the TF700 is 600nits of brightness and the TF300 is 300nits. What this means is that it's difficult to use the TF300 outdoors or anywhere that there will be lots of glare. The screen resolution is also slightly lower on the TF300 at 1280 by 800, but it's no slouch buy any means. The screen quality is beautiful and you can easily use it indoors at half the brightness. However if you feel a strong need to use your tablet outdoors in the harsh daylight you will need to fork over an additional $100 for the TF700.Performance wise you honestly won't have to go any higher than the balanced setting if you are playing simple games, reading books, playing music and surfing the web. However you can switch over to high performance for graphic intense games and other apps but your battery life will take a hit, depending on what you are doing. There is an energy saving mode, which by default the tablet switches to when the battery power gets to around 15%. This option I wouldn't recommend as it can cause the screen to flicker various brightness levels while watching video. Some people have complained about this tablet flickering and honestly this likely is the reason why. Thankfully you can choose not to use that setting and also set the tablet to not go into that mode when the battery is low. Battery life seems to be more than enough to go two days before charging it with light use. Heavy users that game, watch videos use wfi, bluetooth, GPS and connect external devices (like hard drives) will be able to make it through the daylight hours before they need a charge if it's set to balanced power setting. Having not tested high performance I cannot honestly say how long it would last.Currently this tablet comes with the Android Ice Cream Sandwich OS, but once you connect it to a Wifi network it will automatically download Jelly Bean. Thus far under Jelly Bean there have been far less issues with how the tablet performs and the OS is much more user friendly. That said the default web browser can crash and I've experienced this only once so far, but closing the browser app an resuming takes seconds to solve that issue. However I can't say if this is an OS issue, a buggy app or a  bad coding on the specific website. That said you will find that some sites will still default to mobile versions, which has nothing to do with the tablet and all to do with web developers mainly focusing on building pages for the iPad experience and not Android. Hopefully they will correct this in the near future.The build quality seems to be very good. It feels sturdy and the material used don't feel cheap. Even the plastic used on the rear of the device feels well crafted and not cheap. Plus the tablet will likely be put into a case for protection so any complaints abut the use of plastic rather than metal are trivial. Much like the folks who complained abut the iPhone 5 metal casing being easy to scratch. Protect you investment with a case and you will be fine.The 8 megapixel rear camera is a decent performer, but don't expect photos and videos to be as crisp as ones from a DSLR or a point and shoot. It's basically great for quick snapshots in fair lighting conditions. If it gets to dark or of there are very bright and dark areas that you are photographing you will see the camera's limitations. That said if you can get a hold of and HDR app you should see better results. There is no LED flash so low light photography is a no go. With the 10\" tablet form factor taking photos will seem a bit clunky. 7\" is more ideal, but as always a DSLR camera is what you use when you are more serious about getting that winning shot.With the USB attachment you can connect external drives directly to your tablet and transfer files back and forth without the need of a computer. The Android file directory makes it very easy to copy and paste and create new folders. Also if you are the kind of individual who loves to customize your device then the TF300 with it's vanilla Android OS will fit your requirements like a glove.So if you are in the market for a price friendly 10\" tablet that doesn't cut corners to get the price down, and delivers quality performance, then the Asus Transformer TF300 is the most ideal solution for you.", "Title": "Stay clear of this faulty tablet", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Author": "TIMOTHY R.

Timblin\"", "ReviewID": "R3DVG4T1HKVOR7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Greetings..thank you all who take the time to read my review.  I bought my Asus Transformer tablet about a week ago, and love it, owning a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0\", and my Samsung Galaxy S II..the Android OS really isn't a problem.  I had been looking..looking for a tablet PC not the iPad, or any of its subsequent off springs, didn't want another 7\" tablet either, mine is great, I use it daily, but I wanted something that had not just great computing power,something that can handle a ton of apps too.  More to the point..amateur radio apps..I am a ham radio operator, and after giving my pristine Acer 10\" netbook to our adopted daughter as her laptop died a horrible untimely death.  So..for her birthday I gave her my 2 year old used maybe a dozen times a pristine Acer One 10\" netbook with an external CD drive for her 28th birthday.But I digress..this is about the Asus TF-300 Transformer tablet, not about Acer netbooks is it now.  What I like on my TF-300 tablet..the screen size..its the same size as my netbook, I can get the multifunction docking station for my Asus TF-300 and in all actuality have a high end net book PC.  Just because it works on the Android OS doesn't make a bit of difference.  Another like..man..I can sync this up with not just my phone, but my other 7\" tablet, and I can add files from my Windows 7 laptop to my Asus TF-300, or vice versa.  So I can be in the know..every where I go.One of my dislikes, and I know its minor..but there is no 3G capabilities with these type of instruments.  When OH when will the manufacturers of these new high end tablet PCs add in 3G capabilities?  It wouldn't take up any more room, there would be negligible additional cost, so I ask..Hey Asus, Sony, Lenovo..all the rest of you makers and shakers, when ya gonna add 3G to these tablets? There..that is my nit pick, I really have no other issue with this tablet.  I will say this..I loked at the TF-300 Prime and wasn't impressed.  For an additional $200, you get a metal case, a bit better in the graphics department, some software upgrades..thats it.  Can't do it, not on a day when the flesh is weak, I buy and sell ham radio gear..the consumer electronics biz..isn't.  I have a feeling and after more than 10 years of buying and selling electronics..I kinda know what stuff is worth.  True..for the most part, if you buy from the nice folks here at Amazon..y'all can get a hell of a deal.  But, if you go to the mall, or any of the big box stores and get one..like I did, I gave $399 for mine at Best Buy, and was very happy to do so.For all intents and purposes, the Asus TF-300 T, the multi-function docking station you have a very, very well equipped net book. With all the wireless printers, the printer apps you can find at the Google Play store, plus Cloud printing, web hosting, PC/phone syncing, you will have in your hot little..or big..depending upon the size..hands a great tool, movie house, gaming arcade, word processing, and any other use you may find for it.  So..go to your favorite brick and mortar store, find a tablet you're interested in..take one for a spin..you might just like it.I will offer up a bit of advice and then I will let you kind folks get back to what you were doing before I came along.  Its this..in real estate, in buying or selling its location, location, location. With tablet PCs..its research, research, research.  Research what ever tablet your heart desires, pick 2 or 3 other that most closely meet what your expectations in a tablet are.  Compare each of those to the one you want, you may find that what your original idea of a tablet was..may change, for maybe an additional $50, you might be able to get an even better tablet than what you had first planned on.  Do your research, it took me 6 months of looking reading up on, playing with different tablets, I looked at Samsung, Lenovo, Toshiba, tablets, but when I found this Asus TF-300 it blew me out of the water.  I knew of Asus, as I had built PCs before using Asus motherboards, but never knew they were into the tablet scene.  Took my Samsung Galaxy S II out of my pocket looked up Asus tablets and their ratings on CNet and was even more blown away..WOW Asus has tablet PCs..and they're good..people like em.  All I'm sayin..do a little research folks, it well could save you a good deal of cash.  Last item..most of y'all have seen these..for lack of a better word..tablet pc..the price tag is any where from $99.99 to $119.99.  If all you want is an e reader  it may be all right.  But for anything else..do yourself a favor, put another $100 into the pot and get yourself a real tablet..not saying thy're not, just saying.  If you have to save a month or 2 longer to get what you need, then save another month or 2.

Denetclaw", "ReviewID": "R3GA24GZHX5KFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a windy review...  The TF300 is a excellent tablet for many reasons.First of all, I'm thankful for purchasers that have submitted reviews to give me a grasp of what to look for in a tablet (both good and bad).  I spent some time reading reviews of tablets that were out there to get an idea of what qualities to look for.  My wife has a Acer Iconia 100a which is solid but already a generation out (at least).  At first I wouldn't even pick it up because the idea of apps was so foreign.  I'm still in my PC world. Within the last 6 months I began seeing the value in being able to load books, articles and documents onto this kind of device.  I also saw the value of a camera that takes decent pictures.  I did enjoy the interface with my car's USB for music and audio books.  Oh and kids...  Childrens games that are interactive are invaluable.  I was won over to the idea so I began exploring.I'm in my 40's and things are changing.  The 7in screen is getting to be too small, so I started my search in the 10in screen.  I saw the Xoom and was contenting myself with the idea but my nephew told me ASUS was the way to go, so I switched gears and began to look at what was there.  There was Samsung, Toshiba, Motorola, Acer and Asus in the android running.  So many options.  I decided to open my eyes to the Ipad since the last generation is now in price range.  I read a little and decided I was too old fashioned and settled into the PC mindset.  I've got a laptop (w/vista) at home and my phone is pay-per-minute w/a querty keypad.  Android was more familiar and closer to my computer logic.  See you later Ipad.  The Kindle HD had a huge discount and was very tempting, but the lack of gps and camera on back lost that idea quickly. I like gadgets with lots of optional gadgets.I began researching and words like IPS, 'rooting', nits, and ICS intimidated me.  I didn't let that stop me because if it is important, I will persevere.  I hit online reviews at Cnet and Egadget to help me along the way.  After a point the running came to current technology.  Which chipsets and processors would be around for the longest?  I narrowed my seach to the quad core offerings because each of them had the 'ice cream sandwich' operating system (OS) and were upgradeable to 'jelly bean'.  Upgradeability.  My wife's Iconia was upgraded to 'ice cream sandwich', but is not upgradeable to 'jellybean'.  Product support for a few years to come is an important aspect.  Price was also very important.  I like the convenience, and that is what these devices are, convenience.  At $500, I began seeing replacement laptops for my antique of 2007.  No, no, I won't go there.  So in the running were the Acer A700, the Toshiba Excite 10, the Asus TF300; ...and the ASUS TF700 and the NEXUS 10...  Oh wait a minute where did that $500 thing go.  The new generation of vivid screens and memory and power were starting to blur my vision.  Getting back to the three nice priced Tegra 3 quad cores.  All seem similar on paper, the Toshiba Excite has a flash for the camera and two speaker stereo sound and gorilla glass.  The Acer A700 has the vivid 1920x1200 display, no flash and two stereo speakers.  The Asus TF300 has a 8.0MP camera, only one speaker and no flash, but is $50 less than the competition.Getting into some details, the Acer was reviewed to get hot, and the Excite and Asus were very similar in their offering, so price won out in that case.  I read that the ASUS is has less preloaded apps to deal with.  I also read that the Asus was faster at processing that the other two on various apps.  Battery life, they are all reviewed around 8hrs.  All of these shaped my understanding of what was there.  In the end price won out for me.Now for the driving...I got my tablet, immediately charged it before turning it on.  I then affixed a purchased screen film protector and slid it into a leather case to protect it.  I powered it on and watched and waited.  It took nearly a minute to power up.  My wife's starts up in similar time.  Once it started, I input my wi-fi passwd and when it got signal it almost immediately began downloading new firmware.  No issues with connecting with Wi-fi, almost immediate.  This took nearly 20 minutes and with a restart the 'ice cream sandwich OS' was gone and I had 'jellybean'.  I had read reviews about 'ice cream sandwich OS,' and it having issues of freezing up and the loaded browser freezing up and asking you to wait or cancel.  I also read of the virtual keyboard not being as attentive.  I have to agree with these assessments as my wife's tablet suffers that.  The 'jellybean' does correct a lot of those issues and the browser is quicker and doesn't freeze up the same way and the keyboard is attentive.  I did as others suggested and loaded another browser - Chrome which helps the 'ice cream sandwich' a bunch.Touchscreen and SD CardThe Asus TF300 has a very good touch interface via their WXGA-IPS... display.  I like how easy it to select, click on and move items.  I can't speak of the Toshiba or Acer A700, but it is worlds better than my wife's tablet.  My age comes out here, but I couldn't get the Micro SD 32 GB card to work.  There was no selection to send pictures there, on downloading, there was no option to select this.  I online chatted with Asus (it does take some patience, so be ready) and they got me to my solution quickly.  There is a 'File Manager' app which lets you look at the tree menu of your tablet and SD card.  You have to find the file location and manually move from your tablet to the SD card (the file tree was similar to that of the pc system).  Initially I thought it was inconvenient, but quickly recognized the value and ability of being able to customize your files.  I like that.  My wife's doesn't let you do this.  In moving files, no matter where you move it, the tablet recognizes the location.  In my exploration I found the loaded Polaris Office to be an excellet app and I found that the Book app renders downloaded .pdf documents clearly. Other apps brought them in faded and grainy.Viewing and soundI adjusted the brightness to see just how bright it could be.  In comparison to my wife's it was quite alot brighter.  In reviewing it was supposed to have 400nits of brightness (I'm not sure what that is, but I understand it to be brighter than average).  It is quite bright and in the evenings I usually dim it down for comfort.  In direct sunlight it is hard to see, but is visible.  Clarity, it is clear enough with details showing through on movies on netflix (won't try to compare with HD level of the Acer A700).  I would say it is clearer than my 720p HD 42\" flat screen up on the wall.  View angles, it is viewable at almost all angles up to nearly 180 degrees, but it does decline in clarity as you get away from 90 degrees.  My wife's is only viewable from 3 sides, the 4th goes nearly black, yet on one of those sides it stays clear and sharp nearly to 180 degrees.  Interesting.  As far as light bleed on the edges like others have said, it is almost non-existent in darkness, so no bother there.  The sound, it is louder, clearer and fuller than my laptop computer; not in stereo (as claimed), no bass or treble control, no surround sound (my wife's has Dolby with surround option and bass/treble control).  Nothing to brag about, but pleasant when listening to, much like the sound from my cell phone.GPS, camera, and wifiI turned on the GPS in my living room and it picked up our location within 30 seconds and was accurate to the room I was in on the map.  It is as quick as my office garmin and fairly sensitive.  The wifi is quick and has decent range and can detect out to about 1200ft away.  The camera is nice and takes good pictures.  Clarity depends on the amount of light.  In incandescent lit rooms it gets grainy.The app worldI'm learning everyday what is out there on google store and amazon apps.  It is nice to be able to install an app and if I don't like the entire app is removed, as shown by the memory storage decreasing.  Unlike on a pc, where it removes the program, but the software is still in your computer.Overall it is fast, about as fast as I can click.  It has 3 performance modes that are easily accessable.  I don't do any gaming so the economy mode works well enough for me and saves on battery life. I'm going to enjoy my tablet and have already loaded books, articles, bibles, music, pictures, and maps.  I'm ready to take my show on the road with one thin device rather than a library of books and cds.", "Title": "A very good tablet!", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Author": "Robert L. Schlessman", "ReviewID": "R3G8BKA2I98ADR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tablet because my son has the TF101 and is very pleased with it. But I opted to go with the faster quad core processor and more storage. Needless to say, I am not disappointed. Within a couple of hours I was up and running with all of my email accounts synced to the tablet and my Calendar updated. The Kindle app is great and my entire libray of over 300 ebooks available at the touch of a finger. The overall operation is fast and responsive. Android 4.0 is quite impressive, though it does not support flash player as thoroughly as previous versions. I had to manually download and install Flash Player since Adobe no longer provides support starting with Ice Cream Sandwich.I don't use the docking station so I cannot speak to the problem many have mentioned concerning cracked screens. And the lack of compatibility with some Facebook games is not the fault of Asus or Google but rather Adobe, as mentioned above. Not an issue for me since I don't play Facebook games.As a note of comparison, I had previously tried both a Galaxy Tab II 10.1 and a Galaxy Note 10.1 and returned both. The Tab II was sluggish and glitch. The Galaxy Note was impressive and very responsive but $100.00 more than the TF300. I found the TF300's performance and features equal to the Note's for a lot less money.So in summary, the Asus TF300 is everything I could possibly hope for in a tablet and then some. Perhaps there are some drawbacks to the docking station but I have no plans to use it in that manner so it isn't an issue for me.UPDATE - 4/28/2013: I have had this tablet for several months now and am even more pleased with it than in the original review. I have since unlocked, and rooted it allowing me to flash a custom ROM and kernel and overclock it. BE AWARE! DOING THIS VOIDS THE WARRANTY! But I purchased a no questions asked extended warranty from Wal-Mart when I bought it so it wasn't an issue for me. It is even covered if I drop it or spill something on it causing damage.I also do not recommend modifying it if you are squeamish about doing anything of a technical nature. But the upside is I have control over what apps are on the trablet and the custom ROM runs faster that the stock ROM even without overclocking.

So the only devices I can compare are my HTC Incredible 2 and my Samsung laptop. That being said, this is a neat device. Overall I can say it is good at most tasks.The physical is very nice. It seems very sturdy but light weight. The back is attractive but the texture is a little strange. Seems like the ports and buttons are in very functional places.The software seems more than a little buggy. Many applications frequently take a long time to respond. I get the \"wait or cancel\" message regularly. I have found that a few apps in the Google Play store say they are not compatible with this device, although not many, and have not yet been able to get Amazon MP3 cloud player to work.The default browser has closed randomly, but third party browsers don't seem to be any better. Opera mini works the best but doesn't support Flash (no thanks). The keyboard has a \"swype like\" feature that is useful but doesn't work in certain programs. Maybe that's on purpose. Editing text after it has been typed is more than a little frustrating. It doesn't seem to let you touch where you need to edit. It registers my touch but then moves the cursor to another random spot.I cant say I have been super impressed with the processing speed. I read many reviews that just raved about it. I expected it to be more responsive with the hardware they used.It has also reset itself a few times although once was for a firmware upgrade.I have not tried the docking keyboard yet.The screen and display are marvelous. No complaints there. I'm sure there some difference in the higher resolution models, but this display has well surpassed my expectations. I watch Netflix on it all the time. No problems.I've had it for a little over a month now, and as I said earlier, not bad, but not great. Certainly cant argue with the price.UPDATE 8-21-12Did a \"cold reboot\" and that fixed a lot of the little buggy problems. Also Asus upgraded this model toJelly Bean last week. Seems like it just hums now. Really pleased with performance. As I said before this does a lot of things well. Great with just about every app I've tried on it. There is a great built in app for screen sharing with computers on my home network. Many of the other built in tools have been helpful too. Since the upgrade it just \"feels\" more like I thought it would. Battery life has surpased my expectations.Highly reccomended.

I'm pretty picky about my electronics and after checking the specs and reviews on the other offerings out there, chose the TF300T. The first unit I got had an issue with the casing by the headphone jack. It appeared as if the case wasn't properly seated, or that the headphone jack bulged just a bit too much preventing the back from properly seating. That one went back within two days and I got my current unit.I had none of the nit-picky complaints of some other tech users (eg. light bleed) because quite frankly I don't give a crap about that. Just need to be able to get my content and have a solid user experience. It's been two months and the tablet has been randomly rebooting. Not once or twice a day, with heavy use, a few times a session. My sessions are about 3 to 4 hours long. This is infuriating to say the least, and there is no pattern to the reboots. It happens sometimes when using google to search, launching different apps, checking email - just totally random. This is unacceptable for a unit that we all paid a premium price to obtain.Another issue I've observed is the touchscreen will launch apps and select items even before you actually touch the screen. In some cases your finger may be within a quarter inch of the screen but not touching, and it will fire off whatever it hovered above. Let's I'm in the google play store trying to decide what to get. It will launch you into items which you didn't mean to select. Ah.. ASUS, this is an issue!Let's talk battery life and performance. If you want any kind of decent battery life you have to sacrifice the performance. Don't let the specifications entice you. To get close to the ten hours ASUS advertises you have to set the unit on \"battery saver\" mode which brings your performance on par with the supposedly lesser OMAP 4430 processor in the Galaxy Tab 2 , Kindle Fire, Lenovo S2109. I'm certain these tablets don't crash and have the kind of stability issues I'm seeing. What's the point of having a screaming processor if you can't fully enjoy it with decent battery life? Very few apps are written for Tegra 3, most are written to support the majority of devices so should you shell out the extra bucks and deal with stability issues when they will run just as well on another device - sans issues?

Noonan \"jim94510\"", "ReviewID": "R146A2BD80KWIG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is truly a beautiful, sexy, and powerful piece of Android sweetness.  The Tegra 3's 4+1 cores rules multi-tasking, handling streaming tunes from Google Music, showboating in Google Pluse's Hangouts, while downloading a video - all without a blip or hiccup.Look & Feel:At 10.35in by 7.12in , and at a tad over 3/4in thick, it fits nicely in one hand.  Even for an older, geeky couch-potato, it's no effort to balance the 2.60lbs tab and dock combo; tab only is 1.40lbs. Even though the body is molded plastic, it feel solid. The nice concentric-circle embossing adds to a secure feeling, and no fingerprints. Comes with a microfiber cloth for the glass screen.Screen:This is not an iPad.  The 10.1in. WXGA screen (1280x800) is an IPS panel; not the Super-IPS of the Transformer Prime, or Infinity, so using this badboy in direct sun will be a chore at best. However, if you intend to use this indoors, or on a shaded deck, this backlit LED is up for the job. The nearly 180-degree viewing angle is great with friends next to you. It's the perfect size for 35,000 feet! It collects fingerprints fast! The 10-finger touch support is great when using gestures, (ie: 1,2 & 3 finger swipes)Wireless Connections:WiFi is robust and steady. Excellent mobile hotspot recognition, when you need to tether to your 3G/4G data plan.It's easy to burn up your 3.5GB data with the larger screen.My home router limits me to \"G\" band, so 802.11(n) should knock your socks off!  I use an older WRT54GL and still pull 31mbps on the deck. The new dual-band router should be here next week.Bluetooth handled both file transfers and a mini-mouse flawlessly, with is nice for those with larger fingers. I get 100 feet with JayBird Freedom bluetooth headset.OS & Software:This is nearly pure Ice Cream Sandwich, with little in the way of propriatary launcher. Tegra 3 was made for ICS, and with four cores and 1GB of DDR3 ram, it zips around without a studder. Coupled with the 12-core GeForce GPU and 1080p video is outstanding.ASUS includes additional software including \"SuperNote\" note taking software. Pretty cool! Let's you add pictures, video, and finger doodles to your notes in notebooks. \"Kindle\" and Google's \"Play Books\" compete for e-books; \"Zinio\" & \"Press Reader\" for magazine and newspaper subscriptions. \"MyLibrary\" consolidates all your books and various subscriptions. \"Polaris Office 3.0\" to handle your pre-Office 2007 (doc, xls, ppt) documents.For your wireless home theater, ASUS has \"MyNet\" for streaming digital media to any DLNA device connected to your network. The mini-HDMI works great for any HDMI TV. Also included is \"MyCloud\", which not only provides 8GB of lifetime storage for music, videos, documents, and photos - anything; it also allows remote access and control of connected PC and Mac systems.Storage:On board is 32GB of storage, more than enough for some serious rocking games, especially those made specifically for the Tegra 3. The microSD slot can give you another 32GB. The dock has an additional full-size SD card for a third 32GB; and a full-size USB for flash drives, USB hard drives, card readers, etc. If you're a fan of cloud storage, ASUS, Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon, Carbonite, SkyDrive, Sugar Sync, the storage is nearly endless.Battery Management:One of the biggest issues for portables is battery. If you're diligent about switching power modes, you can squeeze 12-13 hours out of the tablet alone. Switching to power saver uses the chip's fifth core for low powered syncing chores and maintenance. Normal will handle multi-tasking email, streaming music, and browsing easily. and power mode will process the latest games and Netflix without breaking a sweat. Also shutting down radios when in sleep mode helps conservation as well. I get about 7.5 hours when video-conferencing, downloading, and streaming music ... can't beat that.Final Thoughts:For a legitimate iPad alternative, you can't beat this tablet. With the additional dock, you have one badass netbook when you need something a bit more, including an additional 4-5 hours of battery life. The additional $149 is absolutely worth it. Also ASUS sells a 40pin to USB adapter that will allow the tablet alone to use full-size USB, but the dock has that capability built-in.UPDATE:Announced today (July 17, 2012), ASUS advised their Transformer tablets will qualify for Android 4.0 (Jellybean) updates.

This is really a good tablet, it does all the jobs a tablet should do, but not confined to those. It is so good that i have to leave a comment here.This is my first tablet, but i have played with new ipad for a long time (one of my family members owns one). Of course new ipad has a more sleek outlook and better resolution.other than these two feature, i think tf300t totally out-wins the new ipad. The performance is much better, especially graphical operations,thanks to the nvidia tegra3. Also, the operating temperature is much lower than the new ipad.Equipped with the latest 4-core processor, tf300t runs almost all the apps i can find smoothly. I am a graduate student studying physics and most ofthe time i read papers on my laptop. I found reading papers (pdf format as well as djvu) on tf300t is more comfortable. The screen is large enough for a standard letter-sized document, and the brightness is very good in various environment. I recommend a free app called Orion viewer, which is very professional and reads documents ultra fast. It comes with built-in kindle viewer, whichis also very sweet.For web browsing, the built-in browseris a bit unstisfactory as mentioned in other reviews. The dolphin browser is the best replacement. It runs very smoothly, and once i got used to the gesture function, it is as fast and convenient as browsing webpages on my laptop. It also supports all the webpages that i usually read. In sort, it is just like my laptop, but with much less weight. Very easy to carry around, without even noticing its weight.It takes all my music and videos; plays fullHD movies flawlessly. I recommend VX movie player as well as dice movie player. Photo and camera quality is okay, not very impressive though.The battery life is about 8 to 10 hours of normal ussage. Good enough fora normal day use i think.I forgot to mention that the screen glass is not as hard as the best commercial grade, such as its brother Transformer tf201. I did not count this as a flaw though; you get what you pay for. Also, it can be easily resolved by applying a screen protector. I bought Poetic ProFilm Screen Protector Anti-Glare for Asus Transformer TF300 (3-pack) and Made By Poetic, it does its job without affecting the transparency---you wont even notice. I also bought Poetic Slimbook Leather Case for the Asus Transformer TF300 Black with Build In Stand (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic)(Has Open Slot for Charger Port)(Business Card Holder is Plus), very classic outlook and it does it job.In conclusion, considering the price and performance, i think tf300t is the one of the optimal choices of tablet.

I had my laptop, and my smart phone, and couldn't see how a third device could fulfill me any more than what I already had. Enter the Kindle Fire. After many months of hinting/cajoling/begging/whining I made sure my wife got a Fire for Mothers day, which of course required some setup by me, and I said to myself, \"Self, this is almost a really good device. With a bigger screen, a little more storage space, and a little more customizability, this would be awesome.\"I almost made a misstep. I very nearly purchased a refurbed Motorola Xoom, but fortunately did my homework, and landed on the Asus Transformer Pad as the device for me. The hardware packaged inside the Transformer Pad appears to be unmatched in a dollar/performance comparison with any other tablet currently available, and the package itself is very attractive to my eyes. The features available both software and hardware wise have seen me using my laptop much less, and my tablet much more. So far I have purchased a very nice, and inexpensive case for protection, and the dock/USB adapter. The USB adapter has allowed me to connect storage devices from USB thumb drives, to a USB floppy drive - and they all just work. I connected an XBox 360 controller USB wireless adapter, synced a controller, and it worked. Every app I've thrown at it, works. The video editor \"Movie Studio\" works. Battery life is phenomenal whether the Pad is on, or off. Threw in a 32GB MicroSD card and loaded it up with music, and again, everything works. Overwhelmingly, I have had pleasant experiences with the Asus Transformer Pad TF300T, and am looking forward to a long time enjoying my purchase, especially if I can ever bring myself around to getting the keyboard/dock to go along with it.Of course, not everything is roses. For completeness sake; a list of the foibles that I don't care for.The dock connector: I would much prefer a standard micro USB connector - since that's what every other device I have uses for charging and communications.The speakers: Sound quality is great, but with the speakers right next to each other there's no stereo separation. Which begs the question, why have two speakers?The MicroSD card has popped out once. I don't think it will be a problem in general, but I did manage to hit it just right once to unintentionally pop it into the ejected position.Charging: Due to the large battery, it only charges correctly when connected to high voltage/USB3 connections.The internet Browser: As mentioned elsewhere, the browser does \"hang up\" for several seconds many times just before the page completes loading. Not every time, but it can get annoying.It's too big to use comfortably as a reader sometimes - like laying down to sleep - this is the one area where the Kindle Fire comes out ahead.None of these issues I have are anywhere near deal breakers, and most likely there will never be a device that is perfect, so my recommendation is definitely to buy if you're in the market. Again, I am very satisfied with my nearly four-hundred dollar purchase, and in comparison with the similar devices I've seen (the \"New\" iPad, Galaxy Tabs, Kindle Fire), I think my Transformer Pad takes the cake.", "Title": "It's hard not to like", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Author": "Randall Harp", "ReviewID": "R3KRDF275JZXR6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tablet is everything that I love about my Android smartphone in a larger, more user-friendly format.

I love android and I believe Asus really took advantage of the ICS layout and really brought out the best with it. Two reasons I really love android are brought out in this tablet: 1.Asus built some simple yet useful widgets(I love widgets) 2. Multi-tasking/App-managing really shines with ICS and is great for a tablet. You can end or switch between apps very easily and even change music w/o having to leave your current position simply tap the bottom right-hand corner.  Power management with the TF300 is great as well, with this tablet being so powerful that it can be used for gaming it was necessary for Asus to put in an easy-to-use power management profiles that you can easily switch between. Battery life on this tablet is great lasting easily all day with off-n-on use. One thing I really believe is a con is the front-camera; it makes me sad that I'm yet to see a tablet that has a good front-camera so that I can easily skype with my friends and family. They complain that the image is pix-elated. Below are some of the reasons why I purchased this tab over the others.Storage:Plenty of storage on this device for music, videos, pictures and whatever else you want and great cause it has a micro sd port!Battery:It was a decent battery life I'm not a hard user with it but I use it frequently I took it off the charger this morning and after reading on the bus for over 30 minutes, playing music for an hour while surfing the web and receiving and sending a dozen emails, I'm halfway through the day and still 85% battery life. For the price its great, if you want something a little extra go with the Asus Transformer Prime, that has an over 3 hours more of extra battery life(according to the engadget.com battery test).Processor:This is the first series of tablets to sport the Tegra 3 processor, that's 4 cores!! To be honest as we all know though, it's not just about quantity but quality. This tablet maximizes the use of those 4 cores. In the 5 days of me using this tablet I have experienced slowing when I decided to test how many widgets and apps I could run before it started slowing(by the way that was on power saving mode as well, which reduces the processor speed)Display:The Display is great, makes reading fun. I have noticed a bit of glare issue but that happens with all displays, honestly have not noticed that much; I can still read just fine while on the bus and the sun shining on me. The automatic brightness only adjusts when you unlock it so if you have your tablet on and are moving in-n-out \"dark/light\" areas it will not adjust. But even on the lower brightness settings I can read just fine.Note-taking:The note app that it comes with works great, I bought a stylus as well and it makes it a lot easier for input. My brother got the keyboard dock and I did notice that the cursor(when the track-pad is in use) is sometimes registered as a \"touch\" on the screen, creating unwanted lines or spaces (this did not happen 100% of the time, hence sometimes).Keyboard Dock:I already lightly touched on this but at first I was not interested in buying this; yes it would be great to have a few more hours of battery life and yes it would be nice to have a keyboard to type with. But I was concerned that it would be too big for the battery or not big enough for the keyboard. My brother purchased this dock and I was able to test it out. I liked it! The keyboard was still big enough to type on, yes you have to get used to it but it's no Everest, it's more like hill. The size is great, just as or smaller than your average net-book.Price:When I bought this tab it was 385 and it was worth every dollar.Overall:I love this tablet and I recommend it to anyone who is looking to buy a tablet.

I am a pretty big technology freak and love having the latest and greatest so when this came out, especially at the price it came out at, I had to have it. I also bought the keyboard dock that is compatable with it and it works perfectly well together with it. I am not new to tablets, I own a Acer W500, I briefly owned the Acer A500, the nook color and the iPad 2. I also bought 4 different phones in the last year because of this electronic addiction I have, but I really believe this tablet is a fine piece of electronic.I did notice the light bleed, at first I was worried especially since it does get worse if you flex it, but after using it for quite a while, i don't notice it at all.The back is not the worlds most sturdy thing but i think it will work out fine. As expected, the screen is a fingerprint magnet, the cloth they provide works surprisingly well though.With the keyboard I think this is as close to a laptop/netbook replacement as it gets.Pros:-Nice and light-Runs games flawlessly-With keyboard, writing is easy-Amazing Capabilities-Screen is bright (I know that the Prime does have Super IPS +)-Long battery life, especially with the keyboard battery.Cons:-There is that lightbleed + flex-Having the hardest time trying to find a stable browser as they all seem to crash, not frequently but enough to be annoying (Tried everything- Chrome, Dolphin, Boat, Firefox, Stock ,ended up with Maxthon for tablets)- It's pretty sharp around the sides and can start to hurt after a while when holding it.Hints- If you have a good stable internet connection, the best way to do any office editing would be to get Onlive desktop and use it with the keyboard and you instantly have an awesome computer that can edit Microsoft Office stuff perfectly-Plugging in a controller (such as a wired Xbox 360 controller) in the USB slot on the keyboard makes this thing a dream to play games on such as GTA 3 or Shadow gun not to mention N64.. going to test if PSX will work on this tablet-Like others have said, if using the keyboard, learn where the mousepad toggle is.Summary- This is an awesome tablet at an extremely reasonable price. I highly recommend it to anyone, especially those who like to tinker around with electronics. Even being 6'6 and 210 lbs, the keyboard works fine for my fat long fingers.

It lasts me through an entire day of on and off usage with pretty liberal power settings as long as I let it auto-sleep after a few minutes of non-use. I highly recommend that other users let it charge a full eight hours the first time, and then let it fully drain and fully recharge 2-3 times rather than partially recharging it afterwards)I've had this tablet for nearly a week now, and I'm exceptionally pleased with my investment. It handles 3D rendering without a hitch or hiccup, and has by and large been entirely stable, consistent and efficient. (You can bet I'll update this review if it later fails to be) It easily hooks up to a desktop PC via USB for file transfers without any unnecessary dancing around with sync applications, though those are still usable if one wants. The power cable is a little loose where it anchors to the tablet, however.It does, unsurprisingly, come with a fair amount of Asus and Google bloatware, but there is at least one gem hidden among that. There's a free copy of the Splashtop HD desktop streaming app, hidden away as part of the \"MyCloud\" app, tucked away in there, which is incredibly useful and works really well. This is something to be aware of, as some owners of this tablet have ended up buying Splashtop without knowing it's included free due to the way it's integrated in the MyCloud app. You also get 8 GB free on some cloud storage app, but as far as I can tell, you can't freely choose which folders to sync to it like you can with services like Dropbox, making it a bit unappealing even if the generous space allotment is nice. You just get a single sync folder that you have to move or copy your files to instead, meaning you have to either keep them in there or have two copies of everything. Blech.The screen is very glossy and can be a little dim (especially with automatic brightness enabled, which will err on that side to save battery power), and can be nearly impossible to make out in bright, direct sunlight. If you're getting a screen protector, one with a matte finish to offset the reflectivity might be a good choice if you're going to be out in direct light much. Indoors it's fine though, and looks fairly nice. Also, the battery power doesn't seem to be living up to the advertised lengths - but the instructions also advise going through several cycles of fully discharging and recharging the battery (after the initial eight hour charge-up), and I've only done this once. Apparently it hits its stride once it's gotten \"broken in\" this way.I am very new to tablet ownership and have little to no basis of comparison for my experiences. I know so far I've got no real complaints except those minor ones outlined above. Everything works very well otherwise, from the GPS to the Wi-Fi to the software. As well as a similarly priced tablet? I can't say. But I've richly enjoyed my ownership experience - and the ability to remote in to my home desktop and effectively carry it around portably via Splashtop has proven to be a massive unexpected bonus.

Also, there is some light bleeding around the edges (however, that never really bothered me).  Lastly, the screen picks up fingerprints and smudges like none other!As for the software, it sometimes hangs up on programs (though I feel that is the developers' fault), and every so often when I turn it on, it appears to have fully shut down.  When paired to a Bluetooth keyboard, it sometimes does not stay in sync when the device is woken up, requiring the device and the keyboard to have their Bluetooth turned off then back on.

The Tegra 3 processor rocks in it handling anything I've tried on it even in the maximum power-savings mode. The screen is beautiful and bright. It might not be as impressive as the newest iPad screens, but it is still a beautiful screen. Headphones jack, micro SD card slot, and micro HDMI connections round up the most commonly needed connections/ports for a tablet. The sound is rather impressive as well for a compact device, and is by far better than any audio I've heard come out of a laptop let alone something smaller.Battery life is great. My niece and nephew played Angry Birds in Space and some other games draining 50-60% of the battery over the course of 4-5 hours over the weekend. The claims of 8hrs or more for playing videos or music seems very likely, as the games kept the screen on like a video but also required more processing power to run than a video. Playing music with the screen off should result in a much longer playtime.Love Android 4 (AKA Ice Cream Sandwich), which backups settings such as wireless connection passwords to your Google account. I have Android 4 on my phone, which I've connected to various wireless connections at work, home, friend's and family houses.

I like how the tablet feels when I'm holding it, the grooved texture grips well and plastic feels sturdy.  It did slide off my bed and scrape the bed frame leaving a nice scuff on it though.  Asus didn't mess much with the lovely Android 4.0 experience, so it's coupling up with my Galaxy Nexus quite well.  They added some items to the notification bar and put a few of their apps on it, but that's about it.  It's a bummer that they couldn't make due with a more standard connector, but I understand that micro USB probably wouldn't have worked so well for the dock.Since the first time I saw the original Transformer I was very curious at how well the keyboard dock would work and whether or not it would be more beneficial or detrimental to the product.  I feel like Asus has worked a lot of the kinks out and did a good job with the integration.  I've really considered the Transformer Prime since it started getting the ICS update, but at the same price as an iPad, couldn't quite justify it.  But, this more budget friendly TF300T is a good compromise to the Prime with it still having a Tegra 3 and 1GB of RAM.My perspective, in looking for a tablet, is mostly that it is a toy and that's why it's taken me 2 years to finally purchase one.  This tablet offers a few features (through the keyboard dock) that make it more versatile than others.  The keyboard dock essentially makes it an Anroid running netbook, complete with a full size USB port and SD slot.  I can upload pictures from my camera, use USB keyboards and mice, and access files off of flash drive (even office files with Polaris Office).

This is basically the Prime with some budget parts (IPS and not IPS+ screen, etc.), I don't have little plug adapters to lose, I have a battery extending keyboard and it all comes in a stylish little package.  I'm very happy with my TF300T!Update (1 month of ownership) - as noted above, screen bleed started to appear after a week or two of use, I considered returning it, but it is only noticeable in the dark and the reason it is less expensive than the Prime is due to more inexpensive components, ie plastic case.

Also, the viewing angle is much better than the gTablet.* Docking option - I don't have this yet, but I may upgrade and get the dock as an almost-laptop-replacement (e-mail, facebook...)* Size - it's much thinner.* Soft keys in ICS - the buttons on the gTablet are really hard to see in the dark (or impossible; I ended up doing it from memory of where they are).

When you compare it side by side to the tf201 it feels cheaper, and looks like the poor cousin to the tf201, but in saying that, this one actually works. The wifi has better reception than my Galaxy phone, so Asus have definitely fixed that issue.The screen is actually rather good. Its not as bright or crisp as the 201 (or the 700 when ever it comes out), but unless you have the two side by side, you seriously can't tell. There is no reason to bag this thing for its screen. Yes, some tablets have better ones - and some have worse too.The plastic back looks and feels a little cheap, but then again it is quite cheap. I guess they had to reduce costs somewhere. But unless you're comparing it directly to the 201, again, you won't really notice it.The functionality is as good as any tablet I've used. There is an issue with the browser crashing occasionally, and I've downloaded 3 browsers and they all do it occasionally. I really feel this is an ICS issue, not Asus. Hopefully updates will solve what is only a minor issue. Android really is going from strength to strength, but its not perfect yet.I seem to get about 6 hours out of the battery, which is reasonable. That's mostly web and email use. I don't have the patience for playing video games, so I can't help you there regarding its performance.The best thing Asus did was to put a micro SD slot in it (although a full size slot would have been nicer as a companion to a camera while out in the field). It seems Asus is the only manufacturer who actually make a usable tablet for the real world, rather than following the Steve Jobs school of design which seems to be to make sure the purchaser never has any control over their device, or what goes on it.I bought this on Amazon, half expecting to send it back due to all the negative reviews. But it seems that apart from a few quality control issues, Asus have done a good job. I guessing the Apple fan-boys are alive and well (and active) in the 1 star review section.I've now ordered the SD card reader (come on Asus, give us a full sized slot next time), USB reader, and a spare charger as this thing is with me more often when I travel than my computer. I'm also questioning my desire to purchase the 700 when it comes out. I like my toys, but I fail to see how it could be 300 dollars better than the 300 is.

This time I read an article in consumer reports that compared it to the 500 dollar ipad. They said it did everything the ipad did at a fraction of the cost, and went on, and on about how great this thing was. So..............I bought it. When It came, I got a real nice surprise in that it was supposed to have a 32 gigabye hard drive. When it came, it had a 64 gig drive. I was smiling like a dead pig laying in the sun shine on a hot day. About a week after I bought it though. I noticed that a couple of minutes after I turned it off. It came back on, and rebooted itself. It stayed on for a minute, then shut down, and a minute later, rebooted again. While it is running, if you just run you finger over the start button, (your supposed to hold it down for 2 seconds to work it) it will immediately go black like it has shut down. If you barely touch it again it immediately lights back up, telling me that it wasn't shut down, but maybe had gone into the sleep mode. All this on, off, on, off crap has made this thing unusable.I normally, if I get stuck with something bad, I just take my medicine and live with it. This time, for $298.00, pulled up the info on it to see about returning it. Amazon has a really good return policy. Guess what?? on this particular item, the return time limit was two days, I think it was. That should tell you something about Asus, I think.  I have been tracking down reviews on Asus products of all kinds, and came away with the knowledge that their policy for doing the right thing about problems with their merchandise really sucks. People are moaning and groaning about everything that Asus makes, saying that they can get no satisfaction on anything.I'm as hacked off with Consumer Reports as I am with Asus over this. The CR magazine was a small, cut down free one that just came unsolicited in the mail as an advertisement for CR.  Free stuff is always no good, so I guess free advise is the same way.I took it to my computer repairman to try to fix it...........nope, it is a throw away thing as all tablets are I found out. You can't even open it up without tearing it up. If it was just the off on switch that was bad, I could replace that with any kind of off on switch. I don't care what it would have looked like.I am to the point now, that every time I pass by it, I am tempted to very gently lay it on the floor, then jump right in the middle of the screen with both feet.

A family member had this still in the box and let me try it out with the keyboard, very generous of them.  I charged it and set it up with my accounts.  The screen resolution is great but is very glossy.  I remedied this with a matte finish screen protector I cut to fit and that made it awesome to use in meetings under bright florescent lighting.  The keyboard is outstanding and is every bit as capable as the major fruit brand tablets.  The battery life with the tablet by its own is sufficient to get me through a business day.  With the keyboard attached with the added battery it will last forever and I can go 3-4 days between charges with moderate use.  I have since sold my older fruit brand tablet and purchased this from my family member.  Having the ability to expand memory and a standard USB port on the keyboard really sets this apart.  I can easy snag and share files from colleagues thumb drives or SD cards.  I suggest a matte finish screen protector for this item to help with the glare.I have read some reviews of individuals tables rebooting at random.  I have been using this as my sole tablet and even replaced my laptop in most cases.  I have not had this issue.

I had a Samsung tablet that I barely used because it just didn't do what I needed it to do.  I had looked into the Transformer tablets before I bought the Samsung but it was a little more than I wanted to spend at the time.  When I stumbled across this bundle for a really good price I went ahead and ordered it.  10 minutes later I tried to cancel but apparently Amazon was faster than me and I didn't beat it.  When it arrived I almost didn't open it and just sent it back.  Curiosity got the best of me and I did.And dang it, I love it.  This is what I want in a tablet.  The keyboard dock turns it into almost a netbook so that you can type well without lag or connection problems (Something I had with every keyboard I tried to pair with the Samsung).  The dock also gives it more battery life to run off of.The screen is nice and the sound is ok (I'll give Sumsung props on sound... it is a bit better than the ASUS here.)  Unlike the samsung which seemed to lag on most everything but the simplest of games, the ASUS is pretty quick.  Some web pages are a little slow to load, but quick enough that I'm not frustrated with them.  Let's face it, this is a tablet, not a powerhouse computer and it's not going to be as fast.  And that's ok.This thing isn't filled with a bunch of junk software like the Sumsung was either.  Sure, there are some things on there from Asus and such, but nothing like with the other.  A+ to Asus for keeping the bloatware to a minimum.This is the only tablet I've seen with the USB connection as well, so you can drop a thumb drive or connect it to an external drive if need be.  Nicely done Asus.The cord they sent with it to charge is stupidly short.  Seriously Asus.  This was a good idea how?  I ordered another one.The ASUS weather program has never worked.  Even after upgrading the OS.  I don't know why.  It always just says unavailable.Honestly, those are really the only negative things I have to say about it.  I wanted something that could take the place of my netbook when I traveled or went to work and this does the job nicely.  I've had it a few weeks now and have been very pleased with it.  I did do the OS upgrade as mentioned before, but I didn't care for the newer interface so I swapped back to the other one.  Happy they gave you the option between the two instead of just overriding the old one like others... *cough*samsung*cough*As long as it holds up I'm a happy camper.  Very pleased with it and just recommended it to a friend who wanted something like I did as a matter of fact.  This is a great option for those who wantnetbook/laptop functionality but still want a tablet.2-12-14We happened to have a slow shift at work the other day and I spent nearly 8 hours straight watching Veronica Mars.  The battery/dock was NOT fully charged and I still had charge when I was done.  Sometimes the picture or sound glitch, but it varies with the things I watch.I've had it reboot itself a few times, which is insanely irritating.

If you're interested in buying a tablet for its advantages of size, weight and portability, you now have several alternatives to the default purchase of the IPAD including this ASUS 32gb TF300T.In an attempt to overcome the annoyance of using an on-screen keyboard, the ASUS has a detachable keyboard dock - a brilliant idea which mostly works well, but the disproportion in weight between the tablet & keyboard means some users might find it less than stable on a table top. If you're using it in a less formal setting (like lying on a sofa) it's OK.Battery life is very good particularly on the power-saving settings. This is important because the whole idea of a tablet is to use it like a phone, on the move away from a power source, so few people will ever use one connected to the mains. One caution: when first charging out-of-the-box, we couldn't get any life from it at all - not even a charging light, and it took some fiddling around to get it to finally accept charge. Since this initial problem charging has been trouble-free.The screen doesn't quite have the clear resolution of the IPAD but is very good and more than adequate for a 10.1-inch portable. You can connect multiple-USB devices like a laptop and have the usual big menu of free Android aps to choose from.pfd is fine but it won't do adobe flash player and won't run MS outlook programs, so you only have webmail. The browser is surprisingly good with a fast connection, video & in-built speaker acceptable though it won't fill a room with music.Overall I think the ASUS is a good alternative to a laptop if you want a device predominantly for web surfing, media & webmail. The detachable keyboard is a great innovation & removes the objection many people have had to the fiddly & frustrating onscreen keyboard of the IPAD. However:* It won't replace a Windows or Mac notebook for speed, or run business software like Sage, or Autocad, or even MS Office; but if a browser and media player is predominantly what you want, it's great* It's not that much cheaper (if at all) than a much more capable budget notebook* It's not that much lighter or more portable than a lightweight notebook either* On the other hand it's not as pocketable as a smartphoneOf course, in a couple of years the market will look different again & the tablet as we now know it may be obsolete, replaced with some device infinitely more capable with half the size and weight. For now, the ASUS is a good buy but not a great one, provided you can live with its limitations.", "Title": "ASUS TF300T gives IPAD a run for its money, but does it really beat a good notebook?", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Author": "Karen", "ReviewID": "R3L7ICGWN8B1LF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a great tablet at a great price and I found it in the Asus Transformer TF300.

I first push/hold the power button as the manual mentions, but nothing happen. Then I plug it in to charge, and try to turn it on again, still no luck. Based on some other reviews here, I know that mine is DOA.The reason I still give it a 3 stars solely because the service the Amazon provides. The shipping is lightening fast and replacement is already in process. Even though it is a bit disappointed of not be able to play with my first tablet, things happen and Amazon makes it so that I don't feel worse.I have heard that many others have the same problem of DOA with this tablet. This only decrease my perception toward Asus brand image. Hope the replacement wont be a disappointment as well.Will update my input when I get the chance to play with the tablet.----Update 05/12--------Turn out, it was my terrible mistake to quickly jump into the conclusion that the tablet is DOA. After leaving it on charging for 30 minutes, the tablet boost up without any problem. So I think that if you think that your unit is DOA, try to keep it charge for 30mins then try power it on again. I think that with all the problems that I have read on the internet, it makes me become too fast to think that it is defected without even give it a shot.First impression, just as many other reviews, it is light, and a bit small from what I thought. Keep in mind, this is my first tablet, ever, so my thoughts were based on the pictures I have seen. The plastic feel on the back is good and I have no problem with it.The only negative comments I have so far is the fingerprint magnet of the screen and the charging port on the tablet give you a feeling that it would break easily. When the port is plugged in, it feels very loose and I hope it won't break accidentally too soon.----Update 05/22--------3 days later from when I discovered my mistake of DOA, I found out that the tablet produces some clicking sounds when I use my fingers to slightly press the bottom (where the connector is). So I contacted Amazon and replace it with another one.2 days later, my screen (left side) started to flick as many others in the Transformer's forum indicate. However, I researched and found out that it is due to firmware, not hardware. I soon received an update from Asus and the screen has not flick ever since.My only draw back, so far, is the lack of its accessory. I ordered a anti-screen protector from a seller on Amazon. Despite the description say that it's custom made for TF300, it's not. It's for TF201, the Prime. But the seller admitted it and give me refund.

Was really expecting a great experience with quad-core and ICS.  WiFi is good but many web pages \"hang\" on loading and you get the wait / close box.  Pushing the wait usually makes them available quickly.Color rendition is mediocre.  I have a color calibrated desktop system that I use for PhotoShop CS and the photos that I loaded to the tablet from my PC show washed out compared to my desktop, although I can tolerate it to some extent as I will just be using the tablet primarily for field storage.  A software fix could be done to let us custom change the color temperature and contrast if we choose rather than just one setting.  Using a Class 6 microSD card for external storage and the tablet takes a LOT of time to complete the image load from the card to the screen.  Expected a faster load time from a quad-core processor, but again, I can tolerate it as they are large .jpg files.Polaris Office, while nice, does not load properly on my tablet.  When it comes up, it shows a screen very similar to file manager, not the screen that I have seen in reviews where it comes up to a choice between word/xcel/power point programs.  I can get to them from the \"file manager\" with several \"clicks\" but I have tried other tablets where a different screen comes up.  Don't know if it is just the version that I have (3.0 where a galaxy tab that I tried out this afternoon had 4.0).  Won't really use it that much but would be nice to have it correct and can find no way of changing the boot up sequence of the program.Screen is a total FINGERPRINT MAGNET.  Possibly the worst I have seen in a tablet.  Have had the Thrive and Galaxy Tab for myself and my wife has an iPad2 (the cleanest for fingerprints I might add)While I am far and away NOT an Apple fanboy, I am impressed with the iPad2 in that it will load websites faster (tested with the wife on same sites), the build quality is much better and whatever the coating is on their glass, it is great.  All that being said, I hate not being able to move files the way I want to, not the way Apple demands that I have to and I also do not want to have to be tethered to iTunes.One other gripe, and it is common with Android, why can we not get a music player that will allow uploading of playlists.  I despise having to upload music and then have to manually create playlists and even then it is a 50-50 shot as to whether Android will properly recognize them correctly.

I got it after trying a friend's iPad. Since I've an android phone, normally I wanted an android tablet and I guess I was never a fan of apple's \"hermit kingdom\" policy. Bought it for $299 which I thought was excellent considering the hardware was comparable to the iPad, the OS I'm afraid wasn't. The android version tailored by Asus for this tablet is definitely not as fluid as the iPad or the android OS in my phone for that matter. First of out of the box, it could not play flash videos in sites like say... Yahoo! With a little research I was however able to make it play flash in such sites by following instructions from a site I got off Google and downloading and installing a piece of software. The whole process wasn't terribly difficult but I figured, I shouldn't have to do that in the first place since people normally buy devices like this for that purpose. Then there is the problem with streaming videos through the stock YouTube app and YouTube with the stock browser and even with Google chrome, some videos will just take forever to load and will stop to again buffer. Some videos though will be flawless, which is odd to me since I never have this problem with the android in my phone (android ver. 2.3) also its an older HTC phone with far inferior hardware than this tablet and streaming though Verizon FiOS, which leads me to believe that Asus' software is the real problem here. Browsing is also often painstaking since websites will delay loading and will freeze while doing so prompting it to show a little box asking you if you want to close the app or wait. This I'm afraid happens quite too often to ignore. And now the real problem which prompted me to write this review, the tablet recently will not turn on after going to sleep even with a fully charged battery. This happened 4 times already and I had to call Asus' tech support twice about the problem. We were able to work it out  and the solution was pretty simple but they could not offer me an explanation as to why this is happening but a simple research through Google reveals I'm not alone. Some people's tf300t and not a lot  i should note have had the same problem as mine. These are just some of the issues I thought I had to share here for others considering to buy this tablet. On the plus side, the screen is wonderful. I'm into dslr photography and the details of my pictures on the screen is just amazing. Listening to music is also quite pleasing with the stock speakers. And lastly the tablet is very sleek, thin and light. But honestly if I have known the issues with this tablet before I bought it, I would have spent a little more and got a Samsung tablet instead and no I will not recommend this one to my family or friends.

The bottom line is it's hardware is fine but ADB does not work in the bootloader (i.e., no easy full backup of the system) and attempts to pair with my Lenovo smartphone lead to bootloops after the next restart and turning Bluetooth on.* * *This is my first tablet but I also use an inexpensive Android 4.0.3 phone that proved much more stable in my experience. Same is true for my ASUS netbook, and that was the reason for choosing TF300T. In my opinion, its hardware is decent for the price and is probably not flawed in my device. Yet while its failure to handle some videos might be attributed to software players, three bootloop crashes in a couple of months are most likely caused by ASUS firmware and imperfections in (its version of?) Android. Most disturbingly, none of the problems could be solved by any means other than a full wipe.Two of the crashes occured each within a day after updating ASUS firmware (with hardly any 3d party software installed or ASUS applications disabled). In the first case the tablet restarted endlessly, in the second it got stuck at ASUS logo while loading the system. The third bootloop occured a few minutes after a restart, when the tablet was not in use and the only application launched was the default Android Bluetooth connection.I am an experienced problem solver in other systems yet TF300T forced me to waste quite a few hours of forum reading and experimenting with recovery options - all to no avail (currently I do not intend to root or unlock the device).Asus email support was remarkably insulting both in its complete irrelevance and in further robotic persistence to remain utterly inadequate. This rating would have been 3 stars if the representative had demonstrated any inclination to actually read my message. Compiling a detailed and well-structured description of the problem + my initial troubleshooting was a complete waste of time. Since I reside outside US, sending the device for warranty repair or exchange is not a practical solution at this point.To sum up, my tablet charges fast and works reasonably well for a while but is not reliable in certain usage scenarios. I believe the hardware design of this model is OK but the Android firmware has been problematic so far.

It is just the right size for watching videos/movies, and playing games, and reading books or articles is a breeze. You can use the screen alone as a touch-screen tablet or dock in on the keyboard and use it as a small laptop.  While the keyboard is surprisingly heavy, it is still light enough to travel with. I DO have to adjust myself to typing on the keyboard, as my reach tends to extend the placement of the keys, but it is nothing too hard to live with. The built in mouse pad is a nice touch, as attaching a mouse or lugging a wireless mouse around would be bothersome and just one more thing to keep up with.  The tablet fits nicely in the case I found at Wal-Mart for $10, but of course there is no room for the keyboard. Ideally I will be able to find a case that allows the tablet to dock on the keyboard while in the case, for easy transportation.  The screen clarity and image density are more than adequate for my needs, but someone like my overly alert boyfriend would want something with better HD qualities. However, I am very happy with the image quality.  I have had fun playing with my tablet and adding apps...so far I have only surfed the net a few times, but I have added about 6-10 apps, played games, read books through my Amazon Kindle app, and routinely visited sites like Facebook and Pinterest.

I will caution anyone purchasing this tablet that you will have to exercise patience when it first arrives. Mine would not turn on until I had charged it for 8 hours...after which it turned on no problems.

The camera is the highlight of it in which it works great with no embedded Flash. I worked for two hours after  unboxing  with the original  Ice Cream Sandwich  OS in which the speed was amazing , but after updating to Jelly Bean 4.2 the same day, I saw a decline in response time specially while browsing with the stock browser.  I reset the  tablet, but the Jelly Bean would stay on it after the update even after the reset. Android will give you the opportunity in the settings to use the 4.1 Launcher which feels more like the friendly Ice Cream sandwich interface , but still no improvement in the Performance and the speed of the tablet  is noted.  The response time, and performance is still acceptable after the update, so no significant issue is noted except couple of ultimate freeze in which I had to restart the tablet,  But it's sad to see such a wonderful product has issues with Android 4.2 , so I hope the Next Android OS would be a fix for the Asus Transformer .I'm also not a fan for the location of the speaker, why is there a Mono speaker located on the back of the tablet ?  the Mono speaker's sound is fine , but why on the back specially when many people use the protective case which covers the speaker ?Another problem noted is with the Light Sensor. It's not sensitive enough, and always under the normal conditions set the light to the lowest possible setting, only in the actual dark , it will raise the brightness from the lowest settings. I don't know if that's the problem with my table or all the Asus TF300 , but I had to turn the feature off and use the manual brightness adjuster.So I'm taking one star off as the result of the stability and speed issues with Android 4.2 , Location of the Speaker, and light sensor  otherwise everything else is perfect so far.

Weird- When the tablet is docked to the keyboard, it's a tad bit weird that the speaker is on the right side.

With the connection of the laptop dock, it really feels as if it's a full-on netbook.  I have an Asus EE netbook and really feels almost no different, except that it has all the benefits of Android. And with Chrome now running on the laptop and the ability \"to request desktop site\" when you're going to web pages, it adds to the feeling of being a netbook.I bought the tablet and keyboard dock for the purpose of using it as a tablet to take notes on at work (replacing my aging HTC Flyer) and as something with a big enough screen that when I travel for work, I can easily view files, etc.  And of course, it allows me to use all of my personal Android goodies.From a hardware perspective, it has 2 SD card slots (one on the tablet & one on the laptop dock) as well as a USB slot for native USB support, and a mini HDMI out cable too.I did debate between the TF200/201 and this device, but at a $100 cheaper and a few items fixed in the 300, it was just the right choice (although it is a slight bit heavier than the 200).Can't say enough about this device, very, very pleased with my purchase!

Lawrence", "ReviewID": "R64WF57IPMYIF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I picked this tablet up on Saturday and couldn't wait to get it home and have some fun. After waiting patiently for several months for this to be released.  This model is replacing the original Transformer the TF101 and not the TF201 Transformer Prime even though some say they took what was wrong with the TF201 Transformer prime and fixed it for this model.  I think of this tablet as a hybrid of the prior 2 tablets.  The repalcement for the Transformer Prime is coming out later this year and will be the TF700 Infinity Pad.  I will first go into the pro's of this unit in no certain order, and it is possible that a Pro can also be a con.PROS:Keeps the slim profile of the Transformer Prime and the 10 in screen and connection capabilities of both.Plastic body instead of all-metal chassis.  Some will see that as a con, but, I don't becaue it allows the wi-fi to have a better reach and stronger signal with no GPS issues.Nvidia Tegra 3 quad core processor which also comes with a bonus core to do low level tasks such as email to help with battery life.DDR3 Ram with 10 inch IPS LCD 1280x800 screen with bluetooth and WiFi.Weight.  The tablet only weighs 1.3 pounds.Sofware.  This comes with ICS right out of the box, and updated immediately with a minor update once activated.  Asus is the king of updates so you know you will get updates before everyone else. Cough...cough Samsung.  I belive this will be one of the first tablets to get Jelly Bean once it's made available.  Also Asus does not load this tablet down with too much bloatware, and no skins.  You get a very close vanilla android experience, which is what most people prefer.Benchmarks.  The benchmarks are off the charts on all test that I ran, and comes close to the Transformer Prime scores.Power Modes.  Asus provides 3 modes.  Power save mode, balance, and Performance mode.  This takes advantage of the 4 plus 1 design of the Tegra 3 processor, with a 5th core that engages druing periods of low processor activity.  So, you can change the tablet to power save mode while travelling or doing low level tasks that does not require all of the processor as say playing a game.Nvidias Tegra Zone.  On Tegra only devices you get acces to tegra optimized games that you will not normally find in the Google Play Store.Camera/Video.  It is by far not the best camera, but, is better than most other tablets I have used, and since most people do not use thier tablet for pictures, I do no think it will be a issue.Pricing, at $349 for the 16GB and $399 for the 32GB Asus came out swinging with top of the line features at a budget price.  The closest competitior right now with a Tegra 3 would be the new Acer Iconia Tab A510, but at $70 more for the base model and $50 more for the 32GB.Dock.  This is one of the real beauties of the Transformer is the capability to add a dock for $149 transforming your tablet into a netbook increasing the battery life also.  By making a dock the Transfomer does allow for longer emails and it is now possible to get some work done using your tablet, and it does act as a screen protector when it is closed.  You can also add a bluetooth mouse and you get a full-sized SD card slot along with the tablets MicroSD card slot.  The dock will also act as a second battery that charges the tablet while attached and you can charge both through a single cable when the tablet is inserted.As you can tell, there are a lot of pros about this tablet on paper, but do the specs on paper match real life use.  We will see with my review below.After only a few hours of setting it up just the way I wanted, and downloading all my apps, the tablet started randomly rebooting.  I though ok, just a minor hiccup and something to keep my eye on, but then the browser kept randomly closing and locking up. When it would lock up a little menu would appear and ask me if I would like to wait or close, I typically pressed wait and after a few seconds it would start back up again.  I tried several different browsers from the google play store thinking it might just be the stock launcher, and I found it to do the same thing.I also found the app market very slow to load also, which should not be happening on a tablet with these specs. My Epic 4g Touch never has this issue, and neither does my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 or 7.0 or Ipad 2.  I also found the screen to be washed out, especially in the app market. It was difficult to read text.  Also, when scrolling up and down the text and pictures would get reall blurry and then you would have to wait for the screen to catch up and the text and pictures get clear.  I also had issues trying to scroll up and down, once again, not very responsive.I often found myself having to touch the screen repeadly to register my selections, it felt like I was touching pure plastic and I often had to touch the screen 3 or 4 times to get it to register my touch. Which was also a knock on previous models.  Asus definitely cut corners on this model and the Prime TF201 is a much better tablet as long as you get the newer models that were made. You also have to keep it on full brightness or the screen gets to dark to use, and at full brightness it makes the screen even more washed out.If this was only $249 I could have lived with these issues, but at this price point you are better off with the Galaxy Tab 10.1 or their new model coming out in a few Weeks.  I also found the overall build quality to be very cheap and if you press on the back to hard you can see the screen bleed, so you might want to be very careful if you carry this in a backpack especially with no gorilla glass.It is possible the model I got was defective because Asus has always had very suspect quality control, and there are other reviews out there stating very similar issues.  So, maybe there are great tables out there, and some that are not, but, it would be hard to recommend this tablet and have to return it 2 or 3 times to find one that works great when there are other options out there such as the new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 that will be available for pre-order on May 4th and unless they change the release date should be May 15.I had decided to return the tablet but instead decided to do several factory hard resets and try again.  I did notice now the tablet runs a little bit smoother, but, every now and then when you open a app or the browser it will lock up and give you the option to wait or close, especially when performing mulitple tasks like downloading 3 or 4 apps and surfing the web.  Once again, with the specs of this tablet, that should not be a issue, but, I will give it a few more days and see if it gets better or if Asus states there is a known issue with a fix on the way.  the bottom line is when the tablet works, it works great but the periods of sluggishness can be frustrating.", "Title": "My Tablet Review.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Author": "Crush KD", "ReviewID": "R2LU2RFGZNMXX4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is Hands Down the best deal on a Tablet EVER!!!!!TEGRA 3 - CheckAndroid Ice Cream Sandwich - CheckExpandable Drive space - CheckKeyboard Dock - CheckPrice Point vs New iPad - Check, Check, CHEEEEEEECCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKCompetition - Only it's Siblings.....Hahahahahahahahahahaha", "Title": "WHOMSOEVER Complains about this Tablet Should Be Flogged.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Author": "Jillie422 \"Jill\"", "ReviewID": "R21K9VWPIKXLG2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This piece of trash has been in a drawer or at the shop more than we've used it in the months we've had it.

Both tapping and/or pressing on text fields on a web page or on the tablet setup screens often failed -- the sceen would not accept my input.  Sometimes the tablet would mysteriosly bounce the cursor to a different position on the page so that it became impossible to correct wrong characters or choose another field.  The onscreen keyboard has limited keys, including no Tab key!  Another issue is that the icecream 4.0 o/s on this tablet only permits google email setup.  I tried to find online support to find a method to set up a different email program but apparently that capability only existed on earlier versions. Plus the only technical support for this product is a user forum -- Asus does not provide technical support either online or by phone.  Hated the experience!  In fact, I'm changing my initial rating from 3 stars to 2, because writing this review reminds me how unpleasant this whole out-of-the-box, plug-and-NOT-play experience has been.Additional note:  the color choices on Amazon are Blue or White and I ordered Blue; however, the tablet delivered to me is Black.  Not sure if the mistake is Amazon's or the shipper.Update:  I purchased an iPad 2 and am very happy with it:  The out-of-the-box set up experience with Apple is great, easy, up and going, just like you expect; the Android Asus Transformer doesn't come close in comparison.

So I let it sit for 3 hours and finally it turned on.. everything was honkadory until the wifi kept dropping.. this happened all day long! I even did a factory reset to see if it would fix the problem.. the factory reset actually opened up more problems...1. The speakers started making weird white noises2.

One of the primary reasons I chose the asus over the Ipad was because of adobe flash.  Little did I know that when I went to websites that utilized adobe flash the web browser would just close out of nowhere.  Not every time but I would say at least 75%, if I got lucky it wouldn't happen.  I would then have to go back to the home screen and initiate the browser again.  Sometimes the page I was on would still be there while other times I would completely lose the page and any information I had on it.  I ignored the problem for a few days but after a while it was just frustrating always having to restart the browser.  I thoroughly enjoyed everything else about the tablet and I wanted to stay on the android platform but I may be soon joining my wife in the apple world.

It cannot hold a charge for more than a day. If I fully charge it and then set it aside, the next day it will be dead. Android is terrible. It is laggy, it will turn itself off randomly, there is a constant delay between pressing the on button and actually seeing the lock screen, and every program crashes consistently. I wish i had gotten an iPad!!!!!! Avoid like the plague!UPDATE 5/20/12: I received a replacement unit and have had a completely different experience with it. I have had it for about 1 week and have only experienced 1 random restart. Hopefully this will continue to be the trend with it and it becomes even more stable after the firmware update. The build quality is noticeably better than the 1st unit I received, which leads me to believe I had received a unit that was rushed out of the factory. In anycase, I am now happy with my purchase and hope Asus makes sure to keep the quality consistent with what a consumer expects when making this type of purchase.-------I preordered the TF300 as soon as I saw it available on amazon. I had considered the prime but had ofcourse heard of all the connectivity issues and anticipated that the TF300 would have those issues solved. And I was right, no connectivity issues. Now its just a whole lot of other things. The list:1. Touch screen stops working. I am browsing a website and suddenly I can no longer scroll. I know its only the touch screen because I can plug it into the dock and use the cursor. The first time it happened it fixed itself after about 5 restarts. The second time I just let it sit. And currently it is sitting next to me useless because the touch screen is once again unresponsive. Unacceptable.2. \"_____ has stopped working\" is a common message you will see from every app you try to run. It is almost a surprise when I dont see this at least once per use of the tablet. Unacceptable.3. Camera pictures are sometimes distorted or just show green. It is annoying to hit the camera button and have to pray that the camera will initialize. When it works the pictures and video are great. But often the camera app is too slow to be useful. Unacceptable.4. Finally worst of all: Random Restarts. This will happen at anytime without warning. It occurred mostly after less than 10 minutes of streaming Pandora but i have experienced it while using the browser, playing a game, checking email, and trying to get flash to play. This tablet is without a doubt the most unreliable piece of junk I have ever used. And I wanted to like it! UNACCEPTABLEFinally, the construction does feel cheap. The plastic is textured nice but in terms of flex it cannot compare to any aluminum tablets.To any Asus Rep: Are these all software issues? Is there a fix coming? I performed the factory reset and the tablet performed great for about 3 hours and now its back to its old tricks. Why would you release such a shoddy product?!?To any potential customer: STOP! I know it looks cool and the price is amazing. But believe me, this is not worth the trouble. I dont know what your alternative is but this is not the great deal it appears to be.

I've read nearly every review posted since I bought the device, and I'm amazed how many reviews here offer a non-critical love affair with the TF300.  Please people, if the review looks like it was written by a professional reviewer, it's probably nothing more than a carefully placed advertisement.  I also suspect that there's an army of people working for Asus voting up these fake reviews, and voting down reviews coming from real people who have actually spent some time with this device.Let's get to the point.  There are some things to like about this tablet, but in the end there are some dealbreakers.Pros:  (with keyboard dock)- Incredible battery life.  With the dock I'm easily getting 15 hrs, which is unbelievable.- The keyboard really is quite good.  If you're comfortable typing on a 10\" netbook, you will be fine with the transformer.  One important caveat: find the key on the dock that disables the trackpad and use it regularly.  If you don't, your pointer will inevitably jump all over the screen as you type and sooner or later you will throw this thing against a wall.- A tablet + keyboard combo that doesn't rely on bluetooth, so you can use it on an airplane.  That's actually unique in the marketplace right now, so well done Asus.Pros:  (whether you have the dock or not)- Ships with the latest android OS, ICS 4.03.  I find this latest OS from google a pleasure to use.  If you live in the google ecosystem as I do, it is very nice to have native apps for gmail, calendar, maps, docs, google drive, etc.  As long as we're comparing this to the new ipad (which is inescapable considering it's dominance in the tablet market), don't forget that Android has an open file system, which is very useful when you're trying to use this as a netbook / laptop replacement.- Device runs very cool.  No heat like you typically get from a laptop, so you can take it into bed with you.  Even the new iPad can run pretty hot, but I've never felt any heat coming off this device.  Major win.- Encryption - you can set a numeric PIN or password to decrypt, without it the device won't unencrypt save for a factory data reset.  Cool feature if lost or stolen.Now, here's why I do not recommend this tablet:1) \"Browser is not responding.  Would you like to close it?  [Wait / OK]\"  Be prepared to see this regularly while you use ANY browser.  (Browser, Dolphin, Maxthon, Opera, Firefox - I tried them all - Chrome being the worst.)  This gets very tiresome.  All the browsers were slow save for the Maxthon browser, which became unstable after a day of use.  I'm sorry people, but the browser is the \"killer app\" on a tablet or netbook, and I need it to work.  This is what a quad-core \"tegra 3\" tablet gets you?  Yikes.2) As mentioned in other reviews, let there be no doubt:  The screen SUCKS.  If you have any experience with the new ipad, you'll probably find this screen to be laughably bad.  1280x800 display with colours that wash everywhere vs. 2048x1536 on the latest ipad.  Videos look terrible.  Do I have to use iOS just to get a decent screen?  Come on Asus.  Just listen to the critical reviews here:  people are reporting dead pixels, yellowish tinges and light bleed.  My device actually shipped with no noticeable defects but I have zero confidence in its long-term durability.  And there's no other way to put it, I don't like looking at the screen.  It's vastly inferior to my smartphone, my laptop and my first generation ipad.  Will I spend a lot of time using this?  No.3) Cheap plastic-y construction: the pad and the dock flex all over the place.  If you want something tough, this isn't it.  Another reviewer mentioned that you can see the colours on the screen distort when you apply moderate pressure to the back of the pad, and yup, sure enough, they do.  What if you accidentally put pressure on this thing in your backpack?  Great, let's buy an expensive aluminum case and add another 5 pounds to my backpack, no thanks.  I need something that's portable and durable that I can take everywhere, not another decoration for my apartment.4) Not a dealbreaker for most people but it is for me: this is no audiophile device.  Lossless music files + player pro + dsp pack + Shure SRH440's = very average listening experience.  Allegedly the Tegra 3 uses a lower quality DAC than the Tegra 2.  No Wolfson chip so no Voodoo Sound app to save it.  Oh, and the volume doesn't have smooth scrolling, so the volume goes up and down in chunks, which I detest.Conclusion:  Back to Worst Buy...  The main dealbreakers being the poor browsing experience and the flimsy construction.  Unfortunately, as much as I love android I just don't feel this is a good purchase long-term.  I see this device lasting 6-12 months maximum.UPDATE:I lasted 3 weeks with this device.  I've decided to return it, and wait for the Transformer Infinity, which is expected to have a better screen and more solid construction, and - hopefully - an improved browser experience.  To give credit where it is due:  the transformer is amazing as an instant-on note-taking device.  It is my preferred device for email, calendar and google drive.  It just doesn't cut it for web browsing however.  Despite two firmware updates in 3 weeks, the browser is still unacceptably slow.  If you expect to do web-browsing, this is not the tablet for you.", "Title": "Do not drink the kool aid...  slow browser and cheap construction do not a 5 star product make!", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Author": "Dr C", "ReviewID": "R252Z889IQ9QWF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought from CompUSA, not Amazon.

The issues are waaay too deep to get into here. However, below I've tried to summarize my frustrations about this company and this product:1. There was some over the air firmware update and update to the new version of Android that wasn't communicated to customers ahead of time.  The result of the update is a system whose data ports are now buggy (odd) and a touchscreen that has completely stopped working making the tablet useless. Troubleshooting gets nothing accomplished.2. It took many, many, many times of trying and extremely LONG, LONG, LONG waits (had to hang up a few times to try later) to get an actual person on the phone to assist me.  He was rude to say the least but also very apathetic to my needs. He gave me directions to do the same troubleshooting I'd already done on my own that didn't work (I told him this and he didn't care).  I went through his erroneous directions until I realized that he didn't know what he was doing.  When I finally figured out he was trying to get me to do what I'd already done, I tossed his directions out of my mind and just executed the function on my own (this took like ten minutes of frustrating conversation to get through).  Of course the reboot didn't work so then he asked me to just wipe the data.  I didn't want to because I would lose all data of course and the connectivity ports and touchscreen made any attempt to back up my data impossible.  I went ahead and wiped the data (sniff, sniff) which basically cost me both past and future time and money.  My touchscreen began working for about ten minutes then froze again (what it's been doing since the firmware/software update).  This whole process so far has taken about 32 days from the time I noticed a touchscreen problem (I waited a couple of weeks since the blogs indicated Asus would likely fix this issue quickly over the air and since I had heard the customer support was bad) to the time I was able to talk to a representative and wipe the data.  Now I guess I have to go through the pain of calling back and sending the product for repair.  I'll update on how that goes.3. Researching the blogs and gadget websites indicates that software and firmware problems are a recurring theme for Asus.  Apparently in January 2012 owners of this same tablet also went through frustrating technical issues.  I have read that everything from system crashes to hdmi and usb port malfunctioning occurred then too.  That was the icecream sandwich update I guess, and I'm guessing this one is what they call \"JellyBean\" or something like that.  Looks like Asus technology is just sub-par and/or that Asus and Android rarely if ever communicate.  It has been hard to find good info on Asus tech problems which means that they probebly try hard to keep problems like mine quiet.  Thank God for bloggers.4. Sort of unrelated, but perhaps not, my docking station also went kaput during this same firmware update time.  It cracked and popped open slightly on one side like something inside disengaged and came aloose.  Of course I dared not try to depress it back into place.  I left a review on that too...I find it amazing how these products cost so much but break like they're made in China...I guess I should research if they were...the lady I spoke to on this issue from Asus was also rude and unenthused about her job.  When she put me on hold (for a long time) the recording about the warrenty information conflicted what she told me, and she was unable to provide data on pricing.  Why did I ask about pricing?  Because she said that it was strange that that happened to my docking station and that if THEY determine the break was MY fault then they will contact me to notify me that they must charge me for the repair.  It felt like she was saying that I'm a liar or something.  I mean, this item isn't expensive enough for me to tell this dumb of a lie...Since the docking station is only about $130 I questioned whether sending it off to possibly pay for my own repair was not worth the time and money since apparently I have to pay for my own shipping to get the item repaired as well (that was the warrenty contradiction I was talking about so she or the company itself is the liar).  Sending a $130 electronic item and insuring it to make sure the shipping itself doesn't cause damage is itself expensive these days.  I ended up paying for that and crossing my fingers that they don't try to charge me.  I'll update this with the total cost of repairs including shipping when I find out, but back to my point--Why can't they at least estimate pricing when they tell people they may have to pay for the repair?  I guess because they have to do diagnostics first, but I guess what I'm really trying to say here underneath it all is that the lady from Asus gave me the feel like she saw me as her adversary and took an adversarial approach to the docking station issue.  I like being treated like a paying customer when I call tech support and not like I'm going to have to fight.Bottom line:  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you don't mind frustration (and wasting time/money) everytime there is an update, but I'd still caution that for so much money my gut feeling is that these products are made cheaply.  Of course this is my layperson opinion based on my own experiences, and perhaps I happened to get a lemon tablet AND docking station, but logic and the laws of probability makes that unlikely.  I'm going to see if Asus fixes everyting completely then try to sell the tablet and docking station both during the Christmas season.  I just want rid of the headache and wish I could tell Asus to keep the tablet and refund me.  I have a few friends with other products that seem to work much better, but unfortunately they don't have all the features that Asus does which is why I took  a chance and went with Asus in the first place.  I have decided to wait another year before attempting another tablet purchase...it seems the technology isn't quite there yet no matter the company.OK, so I'm obviously frustrated and a little mad, but to their defense the tablet is pretty cool when it's not malfunctioning and when you have connectivity.  It's just that those are two HUGE hurdles that overshadow the coolness of the product.  I actually like the tablet and hope they get their crap together in the not too distant future.  Honestly though, I'm secrectly hoping Google/Android will come out with a good competitor before then.UPDATE- Was out of town for a week and when I returned (as of Oct. 1) my screen seems to be working again without pause...(so,so glad).

I charged it about 7 hours and it was good to go. I was forced to upgrade to ICS after playing with it for an hour, and I have to say I haven't noticed any changes or improvements.  The plastic back does have a cheap feel in comparison to the TF201, however performance appears to be the same. The TF201 has a better screen and very weak wifi (The iPad 3 has the best screen).

Price target was encouraging, and so was good availability throughout retailers and e-retailers.  I placed an order, did not receive any delay response, and it arrived right on time.  Then the horror struck yet again.+Good:Speedy, mostly jitter free performance.Good size of built-in storage, complemented by microSD slot.Wifi works, range is good, and so is GPS.Blue (only color at the launch) plastic back with good amount of texture.  I know some people took a hack at this as \"cheap\", but I am not sure about that.  Prime's metal back was bit too slippery for my liking.Quite thin, similar dimension to Prime.-Bad:First hour is painful due to seemingly endless amount of updates all huddling at once.Dock connector.  It has bit of cheap feeling to it.Speaker.  Single slot, on one end.  It is ok on portrait mode, but weird on landscape mode.Contrast, or lack thereof.  Display looks washed out in high brightness, and simply too dim at low brightness.--UGLY!:Quality Control, Quality Control, Quality Control.  My God... does anyone at ASUS know a thing about Quality Control?  Do they have a factory full of lint floating everywhere?  Yet again have I been struck by stupid display issue.  With Prime, it was stuck/dead pixel.  With TF300, my first one had lint stuck in between outer glass layer and LCD display.  Needless to say, I was seething.  Yet another round of return-and-exchange debacle.  amazon made this painless process, but I was not a happy camper.Light bleeding.  This is bit of toss up as it is mostly noticeable when screen goes dark, but it is present and does not require keen eye to identify it.  I suspect that ASUS might have gone even cheaper route than original Transformer on display assembly as I haven't seen original having this many complaints on light bleeding issue.  It does not ruin your movie experience nor is it enough to make it unusable, but what bummer.Rumor mill is busy chirping about ASUS/Google superpad in few months, and I thought about staying put in order to wait for one, but after seeing new batches of tablet and playing briefly with Samsung Galaxy Pad 2 7.0 (only downside being 1024x600 resolution), I was more than ready to give tablet another try.

Was worth returning and getting giving back the lemon (those things happen)  I'm still very happy with it.Update:  Amazon was amazing about returning and sending a new one.  This time, without a thought, it turned on.  I'm enjoying using this tablet.  I really like the flexibility of turning it into a netbook with the keyboard. I'll be testing it out this weekend at work and next week when I am away from my laptop completely.  It charges up very fast and works for quite a bit of time.  Overall, I'm very pleased once I got one that turned on! :)I was really excited that this finally got to my house today.  I went to get it out of the box and to plug it in thinking that it would need charged.  Charged till it was \"green\" , unplugged it, and there was nothing I could do to turn it on.  Press and release, press...s and release, And then the HOLD it down till it comes on method.  So maybe I think I need to charge it longer... which i do and then I plug it into the dock and charge the dock and the tablet at the same time.  Again, they finally show green lights (which I assume means charged)  nothing happens any way I try it.  So, right now they are plugged in...and will be all night.

The tablet's appearance, responsiveness, functionality, sound, and display are all reasonably good.  For me as a first time tablet owner who also never uses a smartphone, it requires some getting used to.  But, overall, I am pretty  satisfied with the purchase.There is one problem, however, with the GPS.  If I set destination and driving direction at home before my trip, the GPS does its job flawlessly.  Once I am outside, say at my destination and would like to return home or go to a new destination, the device has not worked a single time after quite a few attempts over different days and hours.  The device would still identify my location through the satellite.  But it hangs with the message of \"getting driving direction\" after I enter needed address.  Once I return home, it acts as expected again, which made me wonder maybe this GPS requires WiFi connection to set driving direction.  If so, that would be a major disappointment.Some other reviewers mentioned GPS function and no one seems to have similar issue.  I thought perhaps it is a user error and I sent an inquiry to the ASUS technician who responds to reviews at this site.  The person helped me with a few other questions (thanks for the prompt response!) and suggested I could try power off.  It did not solve the problem, unfortunately.  If anyone has suggestions, I would greatly appreciate them as I hate to return this machine which otherwise works quite well.Update 13May2012 -Apparently, typical tablet users do not expect this device to function out of box like a standalone GPS.
