For Apple haters, no amount of praise for iPad will convince them. Now, if you want a stylish, slim profile iPad alternative, stop right here as Thrive is all that iPad is not, some in a good way. Thrive is got to be the thickest tablet on the market by a mile but the thickness doesn't really detract from what it can do.  Compared to iPad:1) Screen:  Elongated compared to others but is bright with good resolution. Tie for now.(I hear Apple is scheming for a better screen on iPad3...)2) Operating System: If you have an Android smartphone, it will be familiar to you.  In terms of intuitiveness and ease of use, Apple wins here.3) Availability of Apps: Apple wins since they had a significant head start with over 100,00 apps but Android market is catching up.  I can pretty much find all the comparable apps I need in Android market.4) Design: Apple. Case in point, even minor thing like the charger design, Apple - elegant; Thrive - the thing is huge, like the brick that come with most laptops.5) Build quality: Apple by a slim margin (they're all made in China)6) Sound quality: Apple kicks everybody's butt here, including Thrive, although Thrive sounds better than other tablets.7) Flexibility/Expandibility: Thrive, hands down. Thrive has a SD card slot, full size HDMI port as well as mini and full size USB port for ultimate connectivity to computers, monitors and TVs.8) Camera: both have front and back cameras but execution and usability is better with Apple.9) Special mention: Thrive is only Tablet on the market with user replaceable batteries; it would definitely matter if you are going to keep this thing for more than 5 yrs. as most Lithium ion batteries peter out after about 5 yrs of use.  By then, all others including iPads will be expensive door stops. But then again, who keeps his/her smartphone more than 5 yrs? I guess that's the idea behind sealed batteries in these tablets, Toshiba excluded.Also, why doesn't other tablet makers come out more with 64GB drive units like iPads? I can see Apple charging what they charge as they are the market leader, but all other tablet makers including Toshiba seem to be stingy with internal memory.  8GB is ridiculous unless you are going to use it strictly as an e-reader. Sometimes you don't want streaming video; you want to download movies, pictures and videos to watch later. Even 16 and 32GB is not enough sometimes.  Kudos to Toshiba for adding a SD card slot but you if you aspire to charge what Apple charges, then you ought to pack more internal memory for the same price.

I had researched the heck out of tablets and decided on this one because of the user replacable battery, the full sized ports, Consumer Reports and user reviews.I have watched Netflix videos with no problems and the picture is crystal clear.  I have synced all my Android Marketplace and Amazon App Store apps.  If there was an app that wasn't compatible from my phone to the tablet, there was an upgrade or replacement available.  All the apps, that I have used, work wonderfully.  I have had zero problems with battery life but I also haven't power used the tablet yet.  With minimal, but daily use, the tablet has been using its first charge for the last week.I was a little taken aback when I actually got it and put it in my hands.  It is big but not cumbersome.  I like the grip and have decided that I MUST have the Green Apple one.  The screen rotates in all four directions, not just three like my smartphone.Since having an Android phone, I already knew the basic and really enjoy playing with my new tablet.  I'm 100% sure that I have not used it to its fullest capability, but I'm going to push it and see how it goes.I did download the Symantec task killer and that seems to help a lot.  There's a bunch of crap that runs in the background.  I have 32GB on my phone and haven't come close to using it, but with the functionality of this I can imagine filling it up.I would highly recommend this product!", "Title": "Great piece of equipment!", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Author": "Tech person123 \"tech person\"", "ReviewID": "R3UTXIGZWC9SHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although this tablet is not as small as some tablets, such as the ipad or galaxy tab, but I am using it often as a laptop replacement.  I like streaming music from online radio, my amazon cloud drive, or music on the device and connect it via bluetooth (easily) to Soundfreaq SFQ-1 Sound Platform Bluetooth Wireless Audio System.The main deciding factor for getting this rather than an ipad was the built into sd card and usb card slot.  On the ipad, you have to buy those externally and honeycomb 3.1 is a very smooth and quick operating system.  Also, Toshiba has sent me numerous updates (security or otherwise) and so that shows their dedication to their products (which was not true of my HTC incredible phone).  I mostly use this for web browsing, news reading (via pulse app, my favorite) or reading my digital magazines.Pros: sd card reader, usb slot, honeycomb user interface is quick and sleek, using it with zinio ereader to read my magazines (no paper anymore!), comes loaded with helpful laptop replacement softwarecons: speakers are a bit weak", "Title": "Great to use", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Author": "Batman_&&&", "ReviewID": "R3JTTTFI1ZADHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We been using this device for several weeks and appreciate the quality, port connections, size, Android OS, ease of use, and fun to use.

How long will it take to get it back? Weeks? Months?Data ports are a must to connect your PC's USB, Thumb Drive, Extra Memory SD card. Well, the 16GB or 32GB memory just got bumped up by 16GB, 32GB or 64GB easily with an SD Card slot.This tablet has it all. I saw someone say it's thick.. Thick? That's crazy.. The difference is soooo slight. I guess two sheets of paper is thicker than one, but would you notice in a tablet?Definetely get the portfolio cover,,, It acts as a stand on your table to you can easily view the screen and type or whatever.

The main reasons for my decision were, Full Size USB/HDMI/Mini USB ports, big storage options, removable SD card, removable battery, excellent reputation of Toshiba.  As it turns out this tablet has pretty much made all my other laptops obsolete.  I use it all the time.  With the flexibility of having 32gb internal, full size SD card (I bought SDHC 32gb from Kingston but you might want to look into SDXC) or using an external hard drive or flash drive for storage this unit is easy to take with you anywhere.  In fact on my next trip I am going to leave my laptop at home.  One thing to know, your SD card and external drives must be formated exFAT or they won't work.  Took me some time to figure that out.Media files for the most part play with the installed software but of course you know that to play everything you will need to get others from the android and amazon markets.  MX Video Player seems to work the best with most files.The Thrive has a GPS chip inside and it works quite nicely with google navigation.  However since it doesn't have 3g capability you will not get traffic updates but it still works fine.Everyone always talks about the Galaxy tab as having a better display.  In my opinion, doesn't seem that much better to me and the port layout on the Thrive is definitely better.  You will appreciate that if you take a close look at the galaxy tab and compare it to the Thrive.Battery life seems just fine.  I really have no complaints because I don't notice a big drain unless I watch lots of video from my external USB disk drive.  For normal surfing, apps and games the battery lasts a long time.  I bought two chargers since an additional one was not too expensive.  I really like the rubber grip feel of the back cover too and it sits nicely on my Sole Treadmill.  So that means that the Thrive also will help you lose weight.  Authors Note: actual results may vary from person to person regarding weight loss due to tablet purchase :)I use google talk for video conferencing, that is the one that works right now.I put a skinomi screen protector on it first thing.  I am really happy with that.  Square trade warranty was available at a good price, did that too.Last but not least the amazon app store works great with this.  All the apps I purchase for either my smartphone or this work great and the service of having all my digital orders stored up in the amazon cloud is really convenient because I can buy it on either unit and install it on the other.There are 2 excellent forums for this device (thriveforums and toshiba support forums) and you should look at those before you buy as well to be well informed.Even with the new Thrive on the way I think I would still be more interested in this one and buy it again.", "Title": "This is an awesome Tablet better than the Galaxy tab in my opinion", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Author": "gadgetman", "ReviewID": "R2WE1PWJBO0D7W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic piece of hardware. The clincher for me was the full size USB port.Prior to buying this I had read mixed things about the tablet powering an external hard drive. This tablet is reading a 1 TB Western Digital My Passport external hard drive no problem.  The drive must be formatted in exFAT or FAT32 for it to read.  NFTS will not be read by this tablet.The Toshiba File Manager makes finding and organizing your files a snap.USB keyboard worked immediately upon plugging it in. No special settings required.Also paired with a Logitech Tablet Keyboard for Android 3.0+ Logitech Tablet Keyboard for Android 3.0+ (Keyboard-and-Stand Combo) (920-003390)The tablet has done everything I have thrown at it so far. The screen has a beautiful picture quality and the battery life has been decent so far.The tablet is easy to hold and not overly heavy. This tablet cannot be compared to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 or the iPad 2 in terms of size because this tablet is meant for a different niche of the market. This tablet is for people like me that want the ports, and the ability to do different things with our tablets. The ports are well worth the slight difference in thickness as compared to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 or the iPad 2.I did the firmware update right away and there have been no issues whatsoever with the tablet waking up from sleep.I would recommend this tablet to anyone who wants the ability to customize their tablet and almost endless possibilities.", "Title": "Powerful Tablet", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Author": "C.

It just seemed all about Steve Job's vision, not mine. I thought it sucked that all my time was spent getting my music and pictures to work the Stevie Way and having the nonstop spamming from iTunes.Also the limits of (1) no input / output other than iTunes (2) no possibility of adding more memory (3) very slow processor speed  (4) I never felt anything about an iPad was intuitive to me. Finally, the patronizing and condescending attitude of several Apple folks in trying to get their help in dealing with issues their product had was irritating also. The iPad to me, just felt like a nerd's answer to a real world challenge.While looking at alternatives I came across the Thrive. Add memory up to 128 gb sd card (I'm told), dump in music and pictures by just plugging in a usb cable, finding the tablet, open the window and drag your music and pictures onto it. Take that Steve.After a couple of hours of playing with the Thrive( without a manual) I had it 90 % figured out. So many cool ideas like all my book marks in a window on my primary screen. Web sites ? Just book mark and there they are.  Don't need that one any more ? Drag it to the trash can. Speed ? On decent WiFi this is mostly as fast as my HP laptop. The color resolution is great and initially it feels like the battery life is better than my iPad. It does recharge in a fraction of the iPad time. Like 90 minutes to full. I haven't really worked with the camera yet, but a couple of quick shots looked good and the zoom was awesome.The only criticism I have is of the speakers. They are so bad, but just plug in your ear phones and party on.Also, the battery is user swapable. I will probably pick up a cheap non OEM spare when available (not now) but the OEM is about $80. Call Apple and tell them you need a battery in your iPad. AHAHAHAHAHAHA !At this moment, the competition hasn't quite caught up with the Thrive's accessories so prices on screen protectors, cases, holders and chargers aren't rock bottom yet, but I expect they soon will be. They are still very reasonable, just not give away. You can change out the back cover to six different colors for $20 (each) if that's your thing.In total, I would grade the iPad a 3 star based on how it made my life more complicated, not less. If I could give the Thrive a 6 star, I would. Seriously, this might not be your dream tablet, but it's mine. Toshiba Rocks.

It is the perfect sum of it's parts. I love the full sized SD card slot and the full sized USB. I plugged my desktop and my old laptop into the Thrive and both were immediately recognized.

I now only use my laptop when I need to edit Word or Excel documents and do other software editing because android versions of Office tools are hard to use with their text box entry and on screen key board all of which is very jumpy and not really convenient to use. Video camera on thrive is not so good in doors, but then again this is not a video device.All in all i am spending most of my time on Thrive now, because like many I use computers for surfing web and watching video content - 90% of the time.Having gone to electronics store I checked out many tablets before settling on Thrive as it has one of the largest screens, ports, replaceable battery and lowest price in class. Of course it would have been nice to own a very slim Galaxy or an iPad2, but I was not willing to pay extra $200 for privilege of paying for extra costs of advirtesement campaign for those two.

In summary of owning this thing for the last year and a half, I purchased it for the hardware, but was disappointed by the software. After a 100 dollar price drop within a few months, that did sting a bit. I had it for about a year of OTA software updates that fixed the SOD, and also found out that the audio aux quality was poor due to software, not hardware. In closing, I DO NOT recommend that if you decide to purchase this ill fated product that you upgrade to 4.0.4 or Android ICS through Toshiba's OTA. It will boost overall performance and fix the audio aux problem, however the wifi browsing speed has slowed to a crawl and the \"Sleep of Death\" has returned. Also with this update they \"lock the bootloader\" which means that once the warranty expires and Toshiba no longer supports it (like they really ever did during the warranty period), you will not be able to root the device to extend its use by flashing further updated OS. I never though I would root myself, but ever since I OTA the ICS, I regret my decision.*********************************************************************************************************************************************************ADDENDUM*** on 7/18/11Just like another positive poster did, I am going to have to add a \"CON\" that will make my star rating a \"3\" if you look this up on multiple forums, you will find that after a brief period of time in sleep mode, you will not be able to wake it up unless you do a hard reset. This is very annoying. I plan on keeping my tablet for the reasons listed below and with hopes that a firmware update will fix the problem, BUT I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE ELSE BUY THIS TABLET UNTIL THERE IS A GUARANTEE THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN FIXED.***********************************************************************************************************************************************I began searching for a tablet because the use of PDA's has now become long gone to the world of smart phones and tablets. The primary use of this tablet was to act as a PDA and install Epocrates, Medscape, etc to assist with school and clinical rotations, and got allot more than I bargained for.I own a Ipod, and cannot stand the exclusivity of it where it only will play AAC file formats and can only use I tunes to transfer files. I also use an Ipad at work, and the back of it, as sturdy as the metal is, is very slippery without a skin on it and the touch is less responsive than I would like. Also another downfall of apple is that there is no option for expansion.I have had my thrive for a week now and I love it, the possibilities of it's use are endless.The \"wide screen\" display allows me to watch movies the way they are intended. Also, when you rotate it vertically, you can use your thumbs to type on the keyboard, which is not so easy on the \"square\" tablets.With the right apps, it will play any movie and music file formats. I decided to expand the storage with a 64GB SDXC card, to which I now have a decent amount of my favorite music and movies on the tablet with some room to spare.With the HDMI, Full SD, and bluetooth capabilities, I am able to connect a keyboard, mouse, and watch it all on my HDTV. As soon as I plugged in the mousefrom my desktop, a cursor appeared immediately .Data transfer is easy, and does not require an \"I tunes\" program. SD, thumb drives, and every one of my external hard drives are recognized (those who do not know how to format to exfat on windows 7 need not apply.)The rubberized backing is comfortable and negates the need for additional accessories.The Honeycomb operating system is fast, and I love the multiple \"desktops\" in which I can organize school apps on one, entertainment on another, weather and news.....etc.The Wifi receiver works well, for I still use a basic five year old Belkin wireless router and the web surfing speed does not suffer a bit.The only cons I have found so far is when attempting to remove the back cover to access the battery, I feel like I am going to break the connectors every time I do it, and have no intention of buying a spare battery to switch back and forth, unless the first one dies.I have nothing to report concerning the battery life at this point, because I have not used it outside the house yet and usually keep it plugged in to save the battery.Is this tablet heavier and thicker than the others, yes but that does not bother me. The extra ports that the other tablets lack is more than worth the extra bulk.

Connected the charger and 10 - 15 minutes later, I am now upgraded to ICS. If you buy this tablet and you are on Android 3.2, updating to 4.04 is a breeze. I gave this tablet 5 stars for the following reason -1) Full size ports and SD card slot. Finally, a tablet that gets it right! (remember - SD card needs to be formatted as exFAT - FAT 32 will not work)2) Very smooth and fluid operations. While both GTAB and Thrive may use the Tegra dual core chipsets, Toshiba seems to have gone the extra mile to really make the system work as it should. There is no comparison in performance between  the two tabs.3) Screen is very good.4) Back has fantastic grip. Rubberized and textured. Less chance of having it crash to the ground.5) Replaceable battery (and back) - not that I care about a replaceable back.Things I don't like -The bright indicator lights. Wish there was a way to dim them.Some reviewers hav mentioned \"How Heavy\" this is. No - no more heavy than Xoom.

I knew that an Android device what is what I wanted and did not bother looking at other operating systems. I have had the Thrive for about 4 months now and am very pleased. The Android operating system has proven to be both user friendly and technically superior for my needs. I have had no occurances of the device sleeping or freezing or malfunctioning at all. I find the voice recognition feature to be very useful, it is the best of any device I have used no matter what the operating system. I chose the Thrive because of the full size USB ports, the clear display, the removable back, and the features that it has. To me it does not seem too big or too heavy because I recognize that you give up some thinness to get full size USB and HDMI Ports. I find that I use the USB, HDMI, Ports more than I thought. The full size SD card has proven to be most useful. I can easily transfer files between my laptop and the Thrive by quickly changing the card. I have been very pleasantly surprised by the battery life of the Thrive. I can easily get 8 hours of use out of a full charge and it seems to last forever in standby. My only criticism are the speakers. I recognize that you cannot get full rich sound out of a small device, but the the speakers are very tinny and weak.

Just go check out some app reviews in the \"Android Market\" and you'll find that some of the other more popular tablets, like the Galaxy are listed more often with bad reviews of apps because the app doesn't work with their proprietary architecture, and application of the Android Operating System. There are inconsistencies and incompatibilities in some of those other devices.2)  In my experience, my Toshiba has had NO PROBLEM running any app that doesn't have universal problems. But, by avoiding those apps that have less that 3 to 4 stars or better, I have rarely had problems. And the problems are fixed quickly by the developers because they're universal problems and they update them quickly.3)  I have had absolutely no mechanical problems with this tablet and have used and appreciated the full sized ports on this device. I also love being able to add another GB of Secure Digital (SD) card slot, compatible with SD, SDHC, and SDXC media. Just be careful and make sure you ***unmount*** your Toshiba from your computer before disconnecting it from the USB port, or you could damage the SD card, especially the 'micro' cards. Also, if you remove the SD card from the Toshiba, be sure to ***unmount*** from the tablet as well. When the SD card is installed, there is an icon in the lower right shaped like the card. Just tap on that icon and a pop up offers the option to dismount the card. It's that simple. The trick is... Remembering to do it.4)  If you've read the reviews suggesting an unusually fragile screen? I wouldn't be too concerned. Granted, it's not the \"Gorilla Glass\" I've read about and would really like, but I've had NO problem with mine. Of course, I avoid leaving it on the dash in the car in extreme heat or cold. I have a case to help protect in and to use as a stand. And, I'm careful not to put undue pressure on the device in any way. As far as resolution. The only thing that might be better is the iPad or iPods. But without Adobe Flash, you can't get the streaming video like You-Tube. And I've enjoyed using You-Tube too much to sacrifice it.I truly hope this is helpful.Walt B", "Title": "Owned it 6 months and still ECSTATIC", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RXOXQFG4W1SJF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I investigated tablets for a long time, trying to decide which one to get.  I finally narrowed it down to the Toshiba Thrive because of the external storage options.  I wanted a full size USB as well as SD card options.  This has both, as well as micro USB and the HDMI ports.  I use the USB port to hook up a USB expander and I hook up my keyboard, my mouse and when I use one--a flash drive.  I use the SD card slot as well.  I knew that I would be using my tablet like a laptop, so I wanted those options, that's why the other tablets didn't appeal to me.  I also like to have external storage, I don't like to be forced to save my data in a \"cloud\".  I got my tablet (the Toshiba Thrive 32gb) about a month ago, and I am so happy with it.  I have been able to do everything I wanted to so far.  I was thrilled with the idea of having a laptop-like device that could sync with my phone, therefore all of my apps, contacts, info. etc. was easily available on my tablet, literally within minutes I was up and running.  All I had to do was download my apps and voila--I could access all my \"stuff\" on either my tab or my phone.  I can print my docs wirelessly to my home printer as well.I must say, if you are like me--and want some control over your devices and their functionality--this is the way to go!  Each day I use my tablet more and more, it is so awesome, the functionality is great, and the big screen is great!  I don't even need my glasses to see it!  Bonus!!I haven't used the camera, as I keep my tablet in the faux leather keyboard case, so it's not really accessible, but let's face it, a 10 inch tablet is a little too big to be lugging around as a camera!  I use my phone for photos.As far as internet, I tether it to my phone's hot spot, it works exceptionally well.The tablet itself is a little heavy, and a little thicker than the newer models out there--this is because of the full size USB port I believe, but if you're looking for lightweight, you're gonna have to go with something newer and more expensive, but less flexible.  You just have to weigh your needs/wants in a tablet.  When using the tablet out of the case, it is really easy to hold on to because of the rubberized backing, you don't feel like it's gonna slip out of your hands.Honestly though, if you want something with all the port options this has, you will not be disappointed because all of its features measure up.A great buy for the money.

It's really hard to impress me that much. As such, the Thrive did. I've got it set up with the free Hacker Keyboard app to emulate a desktop keyboars when not using my Logitech Bluetooth keyboard, and use the PenGo stylus for drawing. Stellar experience any way. I'm typing this review using the keyboard app, as a matter of fact, and can type almost as fast as on a standard keyboard.Pros:- Great battery life. Don't know the hours measurement,but I use it almost contstantly every day and charge it at night. Charges in flash.- Works very well for taking notes, which is what I got it for. Plays games pretty well too, but that's not why I bought it.- Got a factory refurb and it looks and performs like new for $100 less- Protable, lightweight, easy to use- I can even do programming on it using a Terminal program, even ssh to the Computer Engineering servers to do my homework. With the Bluetooth keyboard, it might even be better at it than my 12\" HP tablet pc laptop.- Rotates all four directions... confused the heck out of my boyfriend for a few minutes :DCons:- Freezes occasionally. Fix this by just holding the power button until it shuts off and the LED blinks once, then power onas normal. Had to do this six or seven times so far.- Refused to boot after one of the above resets, but I just held the volume up key while powering on and cold-booted and it worked.- Sometimes when locked, the power button won't wake it, even with the lock slider set to off- Even on a 10\" screen, no soft keyboard will be comfortable enough for long periods of use. Get a Bluetooth keyboard. Trust me on this.- Not many cases for it that I like, but I'm picky. I wanted a silicone skin like I have on my phone, but that still allows use of the multimedia dock. No luck.- Fingerprint magnet. Solved by using a stylus, but that only works as long as you aren't typing on the screen.All in all though, I'm very impressed and the pros greatly outweight the cons in my mind.", "Title": "Wow", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Author": "Tarjita", "ReviewID": "RI74T851H6V8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE LOVE LOVE.

It was a refurbished unit and had a very attractive price of only $285 including shipping. The tablet is spotless and performs very well. I wasn't sure about buying a refurbished unit but am happy I did since it was only $285. That's about half the price of a 16GB iPad and $100 less than buying a new Thrive.Besides the low price, another reason I was really drawn to this unit was the ports: full USB, HDMI, SD card. I love that I can hook it up to my HD TV HDMI and stream anything from the internet to my TV. I also LOVE the full SD slot. That's a really useful feature for me. I can take digital photos with my digital SLR and then pop the SD card directly into the Thrive and start browsing my photos instantly. That's a HUGE feature if you're traveling and want to view your pictures on a larger screen and not have to lug around a laptop.I've had it for about 2 weeks now and am really loving it. I've downloaded tons of apps and they all work well except for a CNN app that seems to crash sometimes when I open a video. No big deal though as I have plenty of other news source apps to choose from.One little glitch I found early on was in the File Manager app. If you are browsing photos on an SD card, you cannot swipe the screen to flip between photos. If you tap the photo, a little toolbar appears at the bottom with a \"Play\" (slideshow) button, forward and backward arrows to browse to the next or previous photos. None of this works unfortunately. I called Toshiba and spoke to a nice woman who admitted the bug and said it's easily remedied by using the Gallery or the Media Player app. Using Gallery is my preferred method. The swiping and animation it shows as it flips to the next photo works perfectly as well as the slideshow feature. The only thing I don't like about this is you can't adjust the timing between photos in slideshow. The File Manager app had a timing slider from 3 - 10 seconds, however that didn't work of course.I wish the storage management options had a setting for storing pictures/videos taken from the device camera to the SD card instead of the system storage. My Blackberry has this option and it helps save a lot of memory.Another little glitch is that videos taken with my digital camera can't be played through either the Toshiba Media Player or the other video app that are installed by default. I had to locate a third party video player app on the Android Market and that works well. Don't know why the Toshiba apps can't play a simple .avi video from my camera, seems like a pretty basic expectation.I just received a nice cover case that I ordered from Amazon Moko(TM) Leather Folio Cover Case with Multi-Angle Stand for Toshiba Thrive 10.1-inch Android Tablet (BLACK) and also ordered and put a green back on Toshiba Thrive Colored Back Cover for 10.1-Inch Tablet - Green Apple (PA3966U-1EAG) . Both are really nice and work well. Word of warning though regarding the Moko case, it is NOT leather, it's a fake plastic leather but still very nice. Don't know how they get away with advertising it is real leather. It fits the unit perfectly though and I really love the multi-angle feature. You can adjust it just about any angle, as the bottom of the case has a small velcro strip and the inside of the case is the soft \"hooks\", so you can easily adjust it to any angle that works best, this is fantastic. I've seen other cases that have only 1 or two angle settings.I'm really happy with this device other than the minor bugs I've mentioned above.

I now speak my email while the Thrive types it for me.  You must remember to have a slight pause between words.  Words that sound the same but spelled differently do confuse the tablet (to, too, two) and may need to be typed in.  Just like a smart phone, you need to check before you send.Tuning on maps brings up your current location.  I was pleased to find that voice recognition works with maps.  I was able to select maps; touch the microphone button and say \"Tampa, Florida\" and the map quickly appeared.  Then traveling to Central America I was pleased to find that it had the map of the small mountain town of Boquete, Panama.  It included locations of some important places.  My Garmin GPS did not have all the roads that were on the Thrive.  Why did I pay $150 for the inferior Garmin map?  It also has a digital compass that helps you navigate. I plan to try it out on other locations outside the USA and expect good results.Two problems:1. The cameras are on the middle left side when you hold the tablet in landscape mode.

I was new to the tab world and like most people all I had really heard about was iPad this and that. Granted the iPad is a nice, thin product but it limits a user who is looking for a tab to use as a laptop stand-in. That's what I love about the Thrive, it has so many ports that u can hook a many accessories to it, ie. Keyboard, mouse, HD TV. To top that off, Toshiba a gives you an SD card slot that makes the memory aspect of this tab limitless.Now the Thrive is a little thicker and bulkier than the iPad, but what do you expect when they've given you these expansion possibilities. Apple makes you BUY all these adapters if you want to be able to hook up external devices.Let me say a few words about the bluetooth feature. It's great! I have been able to download files from my computer and phone so easily. The Office Pro app is so wonderful to use to look and edit you MS Office documents.  Speaking of apps, I have an Android market phone and when I set up my Thrive it automatically downloaded the same apps I had on my phone. That was a real time saver.I have my tab in a portfolio that has a built in keyboard. Typing on the screen is better than typing on my phone, but I still like the feel of an actual key. The keyboard did take a little time to get used to because it's smaller than a laptop keyboard, but what a great combo to have a portfolio cover with a keyboard at ur disposal. Which, by the way, props up the tab to give you the look and feel of a laptop.??????The only reason I did not give the Thrive a 5 is because it is a little chunkier, but if thats the worst con of this product then we're in great shape. I would HIGHLY reccomend that you purchase a stylus because they make navigation more efficient and helps keep those annoying fingerprints off the screen.I enthusiastically reccomend this tab to someone who is in the market for one.

Pre-ordered the Thrive June 13th, the first day it was eligible for pre-order. Also, I love Toshiba as a company. With that out of the way..The Thrive is a fantastic device. I haven't read any of the other reviews, so I'm probably going to repeat what they've said, but oh well. Starting with the physical device:- The screen is very responsive and slick, although you will notice finger prints after minor-moderate use (I notice mine after a couple hours of playing games), but that's to be expected from any touch-based device. They wipe away cleanly and easily with a cloth.- While people seem to say that the device is heavy and bulky, I disagree. I think that the size is perfect, and I have had no problem with my arms getting tired after (literally) holding the device for hours without setting it down (side note: it is a great enough device to want to use it for hours at a time without setting it down.)- The standard hardware set (Tegra 2 processor, 10.1\" screen, 1 GB RAM) works very well with Gingerbread (Android 3.1 OS). Everything is responsive and I've had no issues with the device being too slow or getting overloaded (and I have not overclocked the processor yet.)- One of my favorite features are the ports: full USB, mini USB, and full size HDMI. The USB supports keyboards, flash drives/external hard drives formatted under FAT (a future OS update will likely support NTFS, as well.) The HDMI port allows me to very easily hook the Thrive up to my HDTV, which I do every night to watch some shows online to fall asleep.- The contours on the back of the case make holding the tablet feel natural and easy. The extra grip keeps the Thrive from slipping from your hands (I've had mine since July 13th, and have not dropped it once.)- The battery lasts for approximately 7 hours of continuous use (roughly), although I haven't had any problems with the battery life. Even if I did, it charges to 90% in an hour. However, in order to do that, the Thrive (unlike, I assume, every other tablet on the market) charges with an AC adapter, like a laptop, rather than through a USB connection. So you need a power outlet or a car adapter to charge it, rather than just a USB connection, but in my opinion the super fast charging makes it worth it.- The 16 GB version I have, plus the 16 GB (full size) SD card means that I basically have as much space as I can possibly ever need. (Be careful with SD cards; some require a little hack to get them to work on the Thrive/PC, which requires taping over a small hole in the card. Google it if you have any problems; takes minutes to fix and causes no problems.)On the software side:- The android market has responded very well to Android 3.0/3.1, thanks to the Xoom and Tab leading the pack by a couple of months, putting many great games and apps out there to keep you entertained.- While there are many great apps that are compatible with the device, the reality is that this is not Apple and what works on one device won't necessarily work on another. You will have apps that (randomly) force close, and ones that you can't even install on the device because a company (see: HBO and Hulu) refuse to give you the option to get it to work yourself until they develop an app specifically for that OS and device.- Android 3.1 runs very smoothly with almost no hiccups. The setup of the home screens allows you to place hundreds of apps/widgets across the huge screen, although it does currently lack the ability to create folders. While there aren't really any reasons you need to create a folder since you have plenty of space on the home screens, I find it a bit odd that it doesn't even give you the option.- The included Toshiba File Manager is fantastic. I've used it to browse the internal HD as well as the SD card, and I find myself using it almost daily to clear up downloads and folders that like to stick around after an app is uninstalled (unfortunately, some apps still do that. Hoped that would end once you get off the PC, but what can you do.)- The Toshiba App Place is an interesting app to find some properly developed and supported applications, but it's still very sparse and almost everything has to be paid for. Additionally, the interface for it is fairly clunky, most apps don't have photos of the app in use (just a logo that is bannered across the top and an icon for the app), and they are oddly subscription based ($9.99/month) rather than a one-time fee.Problems/bugs/glitches:- One of the main problems (which, allegedly, is going to be fixed next week) is a sleeping bug. When you turn the device \"off\" (push the power button once to black the screen, or let it sit for a few minutes and it does it itself) it actually enters a low-power sleep state. Sometimes, randomly, when you go to wake it up, it just doesn't wake up. The LED lights up like it's on, but the screen stays black and requires a hard restart to be operational again.- To my surprise, Toshiba has locked down the device a fair amount. For most users, this isn't likely a problem. However, I would like to uninstall some of the bloatware (included software that does nothing but take up space and annoy you, usually running in the background) and to run a custom version of Flash so that I can watch Hulu videos (one of the most important uses for a tablet, in my opinion), but Toshiba does not permit the user to uninstall the application, and it can't just be overridden. Although, many of the folders are hidden as they are considered \"system\" folders, which disallows you from editing some of the files for certain applications (if the app wasn't made to run on 3.1 and needs a little tweak, why can't I just edit a config file and do it myself?).- To continue with the above, rooting the Thrive is still in its infancy. The above wouldn't be much of a big deal if I could just root my device, get superuser access, and just do what I want on the device, but that is currently not an option (well, not unless you want to run the risk of soft-bricking your device (someone had said that since all the editing is done from the boot manager, it can't actually be fully bricked, but you can end up wiping the stock ROM, making it unable to be used for anything until you install a new one or recover the old one.)It might sound like that are a fair amount of negatives with the device, but it's much easier to point out what doesn't work than what does work. And overall, the Thrive works amazingly. It's by far been my best purchase in the past 12 months, if not longer. If you're looking for an android tablet that works great and has one of the best companies behind it, the Thrive is for you. I have a roll up USB keyboard that I can just pack with me wherever I go. Set the Thrive up on a stand, plug in the keyboard, and I basically have an ultra-portable computer/gaming device/web browser/movie and TV show viewer. All in all, I would give the Thrive a 4.8 if I could, but because of some current issues am forced to round it down to a 4. That being said, if you purchase the Thrive, you will not be disappointed.", "Title": "-Love- this tablet", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Author": "Mitch10 \"mitch10\"", "ReviewID": "R1FC4LMM193G30", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I pre-ordered on Amazon so got the Thrive on July 11.  Overall, I am very pleased and won't repeat in detail all the merits of the tablet but instead briefly describe what I especially like and a couple of faults that prevent me from giving it 5 full stars.On the plus side; I use a usb keyboard for taking notes in meetings but found I can semi-touch type on-screen with the tablet on a table; this was an unexpected surprise.  Dolphin HD browser works great and very much like a laptop experience in terms of rendering and speed.  I've even streemed some movies from Amazon with total stupefaction.  If I'm using the Thrive for checking email, light surfing and a game or two, the battery will last a full 2 days. Documents and PDFs render quite nicely on the Thrive and I can even work in spreadsheets comfortably.Now for the 2 quibbles. Sometimes applications will shut down unexpectedly.  This most likely is app-specific Honeycomb issues, but there's no way to know for sure just yet.  Second and worse.  Although it's nice to have regular OS updated due to having stock Honeycomb 3.1, the last one came with the dreaded \"narcolepsy\" syndrome.  I.e. it doesn't always wake from sleep without a hard reboot.  This only stared after the second update.  I have no doubt that Toshiba will fix it soon, but till then it is annoying to wait 30-40 seconds while it boots up.UPDATE; I've been using the new update that fixed the narcolepsy.  It did the trick, but unfortunately did not fix other issues.  I'm leaving the rating at 4 stars.ISSUES1. The tablet still wakes itself up for no apparent reason.  Yesterday it was doing it quite often and it drained the battery quite fast.2. I'm having trouble hot swapping SD cards.  I find that I nearly always have to reboot to get it to recognize a card.  I don't have that issue with other Android devices.3. I still have problems with some programs including Market shutting themselves down while other like Flash just stop working altogether.  I'm not sure if that's due to the hardware or just Gingerbread.4. Unlike the Galaxy tab and my LG Android phone, I don't see a way to clear all notifications.  I have to clear each one manually which is annoying.PLUSES1. Videos play even better; I enjoy streaming content to the Thrive!2. I purchased a second battery and it makes it even easier to take anywhere.3. I found that reading email from the Thrive is actually easier than from a computer.  I read several accounts daily and K9-Mail as well as Kaiten Mail work wonderfully!4. The Thrive hasn't had any issues picking up wifi signals on several networks.

Being able to tether my phone to the tablet is a huge bonus that allows me to go online even if there is no wifi available.

Unfortunately, my 3 year old laptop was starting to need a bit of replacement - the battery was going, the video card was bugging out and lets not even mention the sticking keys... So it was shopping time...I began the search with low end laptops for blogging and basic web marketing - which lead me to machines with far less power than what I had. So, I started using my Android powered phone more for the blogging end and found that it worked quite well. I shifted my search from a new laptop to an Android tablet and the Thrive was one of the last I considered.With the super-light Motorola Xoom, the Samsung Galaxy Tab, the powerful Asus Transformer and the Acer Iconia all in the early running, they all seemed like the better options for one reason or another. Then I found the Thrive ([...] as it was just coming to market.The screen was sharp, the colors were brilliant, the internal memory was adequate and despite the reviews, the size was just right for my hands. Since making the purchase, I have used it to back up wedding shoots on site and view images instantly (the resolution is a  bit low for anything but previews, but it's still very good for those). I also use it to edit quick images in Photoshop (the new Mobile version for Android is great on a tablet) and backing up images is a snap with my camera being able to plug in to the USB slot on the side or using the full SD card reader at the top.Overall, the Thrive is a great piece of gear, but before you order ANY tablet, please check out a few at stores. You might find you like the 'bulk' of the Thrive or maybe you want slim like the iPad or Galaxy.Future Proof: I don't think anyone should buy and electronic item today 'expecting' it to be updated at all.

It is heftier than most other 10.1 inchers out there, and i never feel like it's going to break. It's withstood a drop from 4 feet off the ground with no visible markings and no hardware malfunctioning. The combination of full and micro sized USB ports and full-size HDMI port make it the single most versatile piece of technology I own, which is saying a lot. I do a lot of work with digital camera and videographic equipment and the ability to interchange SD cards has proved invaluable. I find myself capturing HD footage or images with a DSLR or some other handheld device and with a split-second removal of the SD card it can be mounted in the THRIVE which can then be used as a widescreen viewer of a whole slew of file formats in real time.On the negative side, as previously mentioned, it is heavier than one might guess for a tablet. It's no ipad and it's no samsung tab in terms of girth and weight, but in functional comparison I feel like I'm going to snap those other two tablets across my knee when their loading times are slower than I'd expect for a next gen piece of tech. BUT, with how much I use the THRIVE on a daily basis (6-10 hours depending on my work load) the weight bearing down on my wrists has pushed me to pay a lot more attention to the waning strength and stamina in my forearms and hands. I've had the THRIVE for about a month now and I can already feel it \"getting lighter\" after so much time spent with it. But in the beginning the weight was very noticeable.I also experienced a problem with the THRIVE freezing up when it would hibernate during the first few days I had it. At the time I was in the middle of changing broadband providers and after a little forum perusing I found other people had had this problem too and most thought it was related to wifi circumstances. I changed the settings to hibernate the THRIVE after 30 minutes of on time and that seemed to alleviate the problem. I never actually let the 30 minutes expire, I just push the sleep/power button on the side to put it to sleep, but it was kind of a pain to figure it out in the first place, though i haven't had a single problem since.All in all, if you're looking for a solid, reliable, versatile tablet, it doesn't get any better than the THRIVE. Other tablets offer varying features in one form or another, but if you are one who prioritizes the functionality of your new tech purchases, not the appearance or status of owning an Apple product or some other product that's highly marketed, there is no better tablet than the THRIVE. It's connectable. It's upgradeable. No other tablet on the market can simultaneously connect and stream information through 3 different full-sized ports and cast your viewable images in full HD on an hdmi-compatible TV.It is a techie's dream. 5 stars.", "Title": "Toshiba Thrive", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Author": "He_Art", "ReviewID": "R7YBNC0H856UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a solid 10 inch Android tablet.When I say solid, it is by no mean light nor thin.

You get a full-size USB port, mini-usb port, full-size SD card slot & full-size HDMI port. The HD dock gives you two more USB ports and one HDMI port, so you could plug a mouse, keyboard and hard drive into the Thrive at the same time and theoretically drive content to two monitors. Toshiba has included a file manager, so that when you plug in your external hard drive, you will be able to view all of your files in a very easy to read interface. There is also support for MS Office documents and the usual productivity apps from the Marketplace as well. Not only that, but Toshiba has included a full-functioning media player that supports Windows Media files, either audio or video. This means that you will not need to convert files for playback on the Thrive from your Windows PC. This is the only Android tablet that does this, until the Lenovo Thinkpad hits the market on Tuesday.With the Thrive and upcoming Thinkpad, you can actually be productive on a tablet and these are the only two examples of Android tablets that you can say that about. The only bummer here is that for some reason, the Honeycomb Netflix app does not yet support streaming on the Thrive, but I'm sure it will be coming shortly.

On top of that my wife has stated she no longer wanted a tablet, as she couldn't see a use for it.  I almost returned it, but decided she could do so if she really didn't want it.Those fears were unfounded.  As soon as she got it she was overjoyed.

The rubber grip back is fantastic and even our die hard ipad owner friends said they would like that feature as they have almost dropped theirs numerous times.  Toshiba did not load bloat ware on this device. Out of the box the OS looks clean and is very responsive.

The file access to internal memory and full size sd card is easy but a little disorganized, but once you figure out the OS (esp the long click) it becomes much better. The same can be said about the full size usb slot. The keyboard is well laid out, one of the better of the Android devices I've seen, and it has Swype tech that works quite well. It is as fast, maybe faster, than the other devices that I looked at at the time of purchase and the docking stand is a worthwhile addition for charging, viewing, storage and many other reasons.The complaint about having to reboot after sleep seems to have been fixed in an ota update. It hasn't happened to me. Other than that, the rubber back gives excellent grip making it extremely easy to handle, though I've put a skin over the whole case from Gellaskin.com which, despite the ribbed back, looks great and stays on.Another complaint I've heard about is about the size. This for me is probably the biggest feature of this tab. When my kid dropped it after after getting over excited about some game he was playing, I was able to open the back and reseat the battery pack! That alone justified choosing this device over the other slicker \"looking\" sealed devices.The cameras work fine and the video is satisfactory, but I don't tend to use them much. It also works fine with Skype, though you have to hold the tab extremely still or the image blurs. I don't know if this is due to the device, limitations of Skype, bandwidth, or some combo of all three, but adds another reason to have the stand.The only real drawback for me is the old school power chord. It looks like overstock from an old laptop. A little disappointing (again,a reason for the stand; I can hide the chord but still easily charge the tab). Another minor complaint is the little led's. They are a little bright and can be distracting, but I've gotten used to them now, so, meh... If they really bothered me I could always cover 'em up.The only other complaints I have are with Android, and thus have nothing to do with the device itself.

Mostly.Despite its bulk, there's something about having some heft to it that makes the thing feel more solid. Granted it can make your arms ache after a while of holding but it doesn't feel like it'll snap in half if I hold it too hard either. That 32GB of internal space (the model I got) helps quite a bit, though I'd recommend getting a large SD card to match as well; you're going to fill it up quickly if you play games or download movies on it like I do. Between a laptop and this, it was a close call, but the Thrive won out on the grounds of portability and the fact that the battery can last for half a day at a time if you don't do a lot of web surfing/video watching on it.Only things keeping it from perfect 5/5 are:1) I didn't root right off the bat. Feel stupid for upgrading immediately, as that blocks out a lot of stuff I could do and use otherwise. Still love it to death; just a bit saddened that companies feel the need to block off so much access just because they can - especially since Toshiba doesn't really support the Thrive anymore :< 2) Needs better HDMI-OUT support. Looks blocky and pixelated when I hook it up to the TV.3) Stock browser is absolute bollocks. Minor complaint, really, as there are workarounds that are easy enough to get hold of.and 4) Seems to lag horribly and/or crash with some videos (basically any video site that's NOT YouTube). That might be related to me not getting it rooted, but whatever. I can deal with it.NOTE: Don't be a dunce like me and just upgrade the firmware immediately; take time and figure out how to root (opening access to the \"Super\" account, basically the equivalent of a Windows Admin account) your Thrive.

My document library and picture library are completely installed there.  The only thing that's not there is the book library because Aldiko won't use an external SD card in many installations, but with 16gb internal it's not an issue.The only negative is that I'd agree with several that the volume just isn't there when playing music.

It is a smidgen on the heavy side, but again, this is relatively unnoticeable in everyday situations.Pros:- A huge array of input options, including full-sized USB, micro USB, full-sized HDMI, and full-sized SD card slot. The full-size SD slot is SDXC-compatible (right now I have a 64 GB SDXC inserted and it's wonderful!).- Standard power jack. Also, comes with a long power cord, about 10 feet long.- Non-slip back cover, great for those with butterfingers (like me).- User-replaceable battery (however, the battery-life is relatively short).- Microphone works well (I list this as a pro because one of the other tablets I had, the Asus Transformer, had a nearly unusable microphone).- Physical rotation-lock switch.- Haptic: Provides vibration capabilities.- Low power consumption in standby mode (left it on all night and lost only about two percent).Cons:- Power, volume, and screen-rotation lock switch are somewhat difficult to manipulate because they are small and stiff to the touch. The power switch is especially stiff.- The camera is mounted in the middle of the one of the short sides. This means, in video chats you will be slightly off-center. Also, it's easy inadvertently touch the camera lens cover.- Lights indicating power, battery charging, and wifi on the bezel are sometimes distracting, especially when watching movies.- Relatively short battery life due its small battery.", "Title": "A solid tablet with great connections.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer \"Texas Quilter\"", "ReviewID": "R1TW4Q44TZU7YY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Toshiba tablet is the best, bought his and hers for Christmas, tablet offers such a variety of activities, we are definitely enjoying using this Toshiba tablet.

I have also though to use it as ebookreader for special cases (primarily PDF magazines, or handbooks). Now, I am still in the discovery state. But, it is difficult to tell some new issues about a one year model This is a refurbished, 32 GB model, and this is better than expected because of the write only external SDcard. I also bought some accessories: USB network adapter (Plugable USB 2.0 to 10/100 Fast Ethernet LAN Network RJ45 Adapter (ASIX AX88772 chipset)), Moko holder, some cheap pens, and a screen protector. The tablet works as expected, but it has some serious weaknesses. The battery life should be longer, now 4-5 hrs seems to be not the maximum. Difficult to find the switch on in dark. The USB slots and power slot could be better on the side and not the bottom (portrait mode). As an ebookreader it is not a good choice. I usually go to sleep in 15 mins of reading due to the lcd screen. Multimedia works nicely, even the quality of speakers is acceptable. The touchscreen works well with fingers. With pens there are challenges, but that might be rather a sw issue than the tablet, because some programs uses it smoothly, some others not. The G sensor works nicely, which is particularly important when USB network connection is used. The camera function is a joke. If you want to use the full resolution you have to pay for it! And, it is strange that message is hidden now (because of no other option, I would pay for it). GPS works nicely, although the voice direction could be better. Some linux options (like console, ssh, etc., at least on a non rooted machine) are not really working, but I do not know this is how much tablet specific and how much android. The registering of tablet icon is useless. It is a one time activity, but link (icon) removal is not obvious. The four screens seem to me not enough and perhaps user created extra pages would be useful to avoid the very crowded screens. There is no free office suite (I know that it is not this tablet related). This is a real problem, because sometimes it would be nice to correct something (presentation or doc). The nonfree programs do not worth the price at all (none of them!, based on the trial versions). I have tried the bloated one also (read only mode is free) but that is worse than a bad joke, I surely will not buy it. Free apps for taking notes (as pictures) are nice and easy to write by hands. The virtual keyboard is less convenient. It is difficult fond a good PDF reader too. It is necessary to mention some Toshiba related issues. Fortunately, I have not needed to contact with the customer support, so it increases positive points. But, there are issues what are reducing the satisfaction. It is full with bloatwares. Without rooting they cannot be removed. The SD card is mounted as read only. And still Honeycomb and not ICS! These are very disturbing. I cannot believe that at Toshiba only so bad sw developers are working, who have not been able to port ICS for almost a year. And now it is still a promise only. But, it might happen that that some stupid managers are in the background, and for them the selling is more important than the users satisfaction.  The Toshiba market is strange and probably useless. I could not deduce its purpose. The only free program what I downloaded as test, does not run. Because of the irresponsiveness of Toshiba for software versions I do not expect more from the nonfree programs, too. Accessories: The USB network adapter is nice, although there are places to improve it. It is recommended for everybody for the case of  non wifi network. Moko holder is worse than expected and described by users. It seems to me that is a little undersized by 1-2 mm. Without alternatives, it is recommmended to  buy the cheapest one. I did not expect too much from the pens (not Toshiba, < 2 USD), but those are at least completely filled. Some sws are well working with them, some others not completely, but as a pointing device it is OK, writing fingers seems to be better. Although, I ordered and received a screen protector too, I have not mounted it. First I want to get experiences as is. Finally, the screen is from glass, and normal use cannot cause damages. Briefly, I am  very happy to have this tablet, and I do hope the problems mentioned by others will not appear.

I got my husband a Ipad 2 for Christmas and is it not my favorite, matter of fact very last on my totem pole.

Harley", "ReviewID": "R15W2MQCM1BUMP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After comparing several Android tablets at a local store, I decided the numerous full-sized ports on the Thrive was too big a feature to overlook.  Thrive didn't have the best looking display (that title goes to the Galaxy tab).  The Thrive's display seems a little washed-out compared to the Galaxy Tab, but it's not a bad display by any means.  In fact, if you didn't have a Tab next to it for comparison, you probably wouldn't even notice. The body is also a little thicker than the other tablets but not ridiculously so.  Besides, I'm not particularly obsessed with getting the thinnest possible tablet.  I'll let the Voss water drinking crowd obsess over aesthetics and thinness, I just want a good performing tablet.  The rubberized back offers great support, something I found lacking when using my iPad without a case.  By the way, this is not an iPad replacement, it's a companion; same way I have an iMac and a PC.  I figure I'll get the best of both worlds and the Thrive definitely delivers on the Android side. The pricing is also aggressive as I paid 99-cents more than the price of a Kindle fire for this during an Amazon Black Friday lightning deal.  Factor in a high-speed 32GB SD card for roughly $38 and I'm rocking a 48GB 10.1 Android tablet for well under $250.  I realize that is special pricing but it does make purchasing this that much sweeter.The Honeycomb Android OS is fast and responsive, although still not quite as fluid as iOS.  There is that occasional lag which I attribute to all Android devices.  Any Android owners willing to be truthful know exactly what I'm referring to. I compared performance  among several Android tablets including the Thrive and tablets from Asus, Samsung, and Lenovo.  The Thrive was just as responsive as the others.  Based on what I've found, I don't think there will be a noticeable gap in performance among Android tablets until the Transformer Prime is released soon.  I also hear the Android Ice Cream Sandwich OS revision is supposed to address a lot of performance issues and make the Android OS smoother. The only question is if it will run on all of the current tablets or if everyone will it require beast tabs like the upcoming quad-core Transformer Prime.  In the meantime, Honeycomb is mostly stable with only the slightest of occasional hiccups and the Thrive functions well with it.  The cameras are standard fare, meaning nothing to write home about.  The front facing is adequate for apps like Skype, Google+ or other videoconferencing needs.  The rear camera takes higher resolution snaps and HD video but I still have no plans to ditch my dedicated digicam or camcorder.  The ports work as advertised.  This feature is AWESOME!!  Toshiba even includes a built-in file manager, so you don't have to buy an app to explore files on external storage or the device itself.  The ports make it much more laptop-like than the other tabs.  Plug in a flash thumb drive and view files, photos, etc.  use a full size HDMI cable to play HD content.  Stream Netflix or anything else via the HDMI to a large screen HD TV.  So far, YouTube, Netflix and video streaming work fine for me on the Thrive.The Thrive has a removable back panel (which can be swapped with optional different color panels) and a replaceable battery.  I don't really go for super-long stretches away from an outlet, so I doubt I'd need a spare battery, however, it's great to know that if battery life suddenly shortens or it doesn't charge properly (as I experienced with my Android phone in the past), I can replace the battery and make it goods as new.The Thrive might not be the thinnest, sexiest, or even most powerful Android tablet, but for the price and the features, it's the best geared toward power users looking for real connectivity options.

The touch only operation was initially much more difficult than having a mouse and an actual keyboard.  After 6 weeks of use, efficiency/ease of use has increased a lot but there are still major problems.  Here's a sample problem.  Msnbc news videos are listed vertically on the tablet.  Usually, one can navigate down the list by lightly touching the page and flicking your finger upward.  However, OCCASIONALLY, even the lightest touch has caused the video parallel to where i touched to start playing RATHER than my being able to navigate down the page to select a different video.  A different but related problem is that sometimes the lightest accidental touch will cause a webpage or app to close, sometimes non-retrievably.  At other times, you have to press or touch several times to get it to do what you want.  The Android 3.0 User Guide has a number of mistakes in it, e.g. where it tells you how you're supposed to delete downloads.  On the upside, the download speed is good, and the video quality is great.  The 5 MP camera on front and back is a good camera.

In the interest of full disclosure, I didn't actually \"buy\" this tablet as I won it as a prize in a contest. I currently have the 16GB model of the Thrive.First off, this thing is huge. It's massive. If you haven't touched it before, quick run down to a store and play with it...it's probably a lot larger than you think. I hadn't actually used one before I got mine and I was a bit taken aback by its size.  You're not going to win any beauty contests with this sucker, and it only gets worse when you add a case to it.  That being said, it didn't take long for me to get over its girth.  The battery plate's rubberized texture makes it pretty easy to hold.  And Toshiba's main claim for the girth is the addition of the SD card slot and full sized usb and hdmi ports.  Honestly, the trade in size is well worth not having to carry around separate adapters for hooking up memory cards, usb drives and hdmi cables.  The only place Toshiba misses the mark with regard to ports is the inclusion of a mini usb port instead of a micro usb port.  Not sure why they did this, but I'd much rather have the micro so I could connect more newer devices to it.As of this review, the Thrive has been updated to Android 3.2, but the one you receive may still have the original 3.1 software on it.  I'd suggest going to settings, about, software updates to download any existing updates before you get too involved in playing with this.  Also note that you'll want to do some research if you're big into rooting and custom roms, as there are reports about the latest factory update breaking some of the rooting techniques.Toshiba provides a mostly stock 3.2 experience with some added benefits. The best enhancement is their inclusion of a file manager that allows you to easily browse through the contents of your Thrive, SD card or USB memory stick.  This is so easy, in fact, that if you're price sensitive you could easily consider going with the 8GB or 16 GB versions instead of the 16/32 GBs and buy a SD card to make up the difference in space.  The SD card port and ease of the file manager makes it a breeze for managing media (essentially videos for kids in my case) on the device.The Thrive's cameras are what you'd expect on a tablet: adequate but not amazing. They're not going to replace your point and shoot, and it's a little awkward taking photos holding the tablet, but it's great for capturing a quick pic or using video chat.The HDMI port mirrors your tablet on your TV or other screen.  It's pretty much plug and play, but I've noticed that the picture quality can vary a bit.  However, this feature, combined with the SD card slot, turns the device into the ultimate picture slideshow as you can quickly display pictures on the TV by swapping out the SD card and using the HDMI out on the TV.  Note that if you do this, don't try to browse through the pictures via the file manager.  The Thrive will show all pictures on the SD card as a folder in the gallery, and this is the best place to flip through pictures. In the file manager, you'll have to click on each picture individually instead of viewing a slideshow.The battery on the Thrive is \"so so\" in my opinion.  It's not as great as other tablets out there, but it will still make it a good ways on a charge. The battery is actually replaceable, so you could buy a spare if you really needed one.  Also, the Thrive charges via a proprietary cable that looks a lot like a laptop cable, so you won't be charging this sucker off your computer if you forget your charger.The last thing I'd like to touch on is the Thrive's Android 3.2 software.  As of this review Toshiba has not released any date for an Android 4 (Ice Cream Sandwich) update.  I found the Thrive to lag a bit, especially when using the browser.  It's not the smoothest device out there, but there are definitely worse tablets on the market. An upgrade to Android 4 should improve this device's user experience.  The main drag with this device's software, however, pertains to its start-up/boot time. Be prepared to wait about a minute for it to turn on and be ready for use. That might not seem long, but when you're staring at that screen it feels like an eternity.Overall, I give the thrive a 3/5 rating.  It has its issues with software and size, but also some great advantages with the many useful ports. Its combination of size, boot time and battery life make the Thrive a tough sell as a commuting device as it provides few advantages over a net book or laptop.  But, if you're looking for a couch tablet that has great flexibility in storage/ports/video connectivity, and you're only planning on travelling with it occasionally, it could be the perfect fit for you.", "Title": "Good, but not great", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Author": "Barb Lodge", "ReviewID": "R3PKIKUAX8PX6E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Screen is scratched, cracked.

I'll skip the specs part because you can read that below.Arrival:The quick/getting started guide does a nice job of outlining the where all the buttons are. I went ahead and took the back off so I could see how I could change the battery. Very easy to do and there's a cover lock button that makes it all very easy. There's a great wizard that fires up when you first turn it on that walks you through WiFi setup and Google account login. I added all 4 of our family accounts for myself, my wife, and 2 daughters. The Gmail app has real nice quick select option to switch between accounts so we can share the device with ease.Speed:Lightening fast for everything. Screen swiping, apps opening, screen orientation switch, you name it. No lags anywhere which makes it a real joy to use.Apps:I downloaded a few of my favorite apps from the Android Market like Astro, Pandora, Swype (I'm in the Beta program), Angry Birds, Battery Left, and so on. No issues whatsoever. I do know that some developers have done better than others adding features that support the larger screen on a tablet vs. a phone. I have an old Android Phone which is Froyo 2.2 so I'm not sure if it's the new 3.1 Honeycomb OS or the Toshiba touches but there are some great widgets that I don't have on my phone. The Bookmarks widget is very cool and places the home page of all your bookmarks in a scrollable window on the desktop - very cool.Copying Files:I hooked it up with the included USB cable to my home PC and copied over some music in MP3 format, some movies in MP4 format, some pictures in JPG format and it was super easy. The home PC recognized the device right away and I was off to the races. Everything played fine on the nice Toshiba Media Player app that the tablet came with - very nice because it handles ALL media. There's also a really nice File Manager app which makes it easy to see and manage what you've copied. I used my 16GB USB flash drive to copy over a few files and it also worked perfectly. I tried plugging in a 170GB external hard drive to copy some more movies over and I'm sorry to say this did NOT work. The tablet froze and I had to hold down the power button to do a full re-start.Simulcasting:One of the things I really wanted to be able to do was simulcast movies played on the tablet with my 60 inch HD TV. I used this HDMI cable BlueRigger High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet 6.6 Feet (2m) - Supports 3D and Audio Return [Latest Version] that I ordered from Amazon when I ordered the Thrive. It worked perfectly! In fact, once you hook up the cable, everything you do on the tablet shows up on the TV. The kids played Angry Bird while we watched on the TV. I can see us on vacation playing videos we make and pictures we take on the TV in the hotel room since most of them now have HDMI inputs.Form Factor:Like everyone else, I'll mention that it's a little thick but I love the rubber-like textured back which makes it easy to handle. I'll give up super thin for all of the connectivity in a heartbeat. I did buy this 360 case Toshiba Thrive Portfolio 360 Case for 10.1-Inch Tablet (PA1495U-1TWC)which is so far working out really well. I like that it can stand the tablet up in portrait or landscape mode.Battery:Pretty darn good. We've been messing with this thing a ton and I'm still working off the original charge. I do shut it all the way down when I'm done so I know that helps quite a bit.In Summary:I did my homework and I'm not disappointed at all. This is a great tablet for people like me that hate \"Apple Jail\". My kids don't want to put it down but my wife makes them.ORIGINAL PRE-HANDS-ON REVIEW:I've spent quite a bit of time looking at 10.1 inch tablets and I have some very specific needs that Toshiba has nailed.- Wireless-N Wi-Fi networking and Bluetooth with connectivity to peripherals; I don't want to get forced into another expensive plan from a wireless carrier (Xoom, are you listening?). I can always tether from my existing Droid phone.- Full-sized and mini USB ports as well as an SD card slot; I can easily transfer files including a bunch of MP4 movies I have to the tablet and I can expand the memory with an SD memory card (Samsung, are you listening? Asus, you were close but I needed to buy the keyboard I don't want to get the USB port).- HDMI output; One of the things I want to do is use my tablet to play MP4 movies and simulcast them on my 60 inch flat screen TV in full 1080p mode (Samsung can't do this).- User-Replaceable Battery; I have a spare battery for my Droid phone and every time I've used it I could not help but think \"what would I do without this\". It's just such a great option to have. Plus, as mentioned in an earlier review, eventually these batteries die.- Honeycomb 3.1; I want the tablet OS not the smartphone OS (Sorry Asus, you almost had me).I hope they release it soon and don't price it too high because I really want one.", "Title": "Toshiba Thrive Hands-On Review - Awesome Tablet", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Author": "J.

That includes SD card support, USB slots, HDMI port, and most importantly, a replaceable battery.  The Toshiba Thrive has everything I ever wanted in a tablet so I pre-ordered and received it yesterday.To my dismay, I am returning it today to Amazon because I cannot get the device to detect my phone's wifi Hotspot.  My ipod touch, my laptop, and even my digital camera can all see and connect to my phone's wifi Hotspot.  But this tablet cannot even \"see\" it.  After trying tirelessly to detect my wifi, I finally came across an app, WifiManager, that can \"see\" my phone's hotspot.  When I tried to connect, it tells me that \"ad-hoc\" network are not supported on Android.  Are you serious?  All of my other devices can connect to this \"ad-hoc\" network and Android cannot????  WifiManager also links me to the Google Android Issues Forum:  Issue #82 - wifi- support ad hoc networking [...]It turns out that this issue was reported to Google back in 2008 but they never fixed it.  So if your internet connection is via an \"ad-hoc\" network (most likely any Mobile Phone WIFI Hotspot), this tablet will not work with it.  I bought this tablet strictly for mobile computing.  I was hoping to use my phone's wifi hotspot for internet connection with this device.  But since this device cannot detect or use the hotspot connection, it's basically unusable for me.  If anyone reading this know of a solution, please comment.  I did see some posting about a hack requiring rooting the device but I am not comfortable rooting or hacking it.I give this tablet 5 stars for having all the hardware I ever wanted in a tablet but 0 star for Google Android OS for ignoring the most basic requirement for mobile internet connectivity.  That averages out to 2.5 stars but I'll round it up to 3 stars.  If all other devices can use an ad-hoc network, why can't Honeycomb?  As much as I hate iShackle products, I have no choice but to get an iPad.  This is very upsetting.  Thanks for nothing Google!  I was so looking forward to owning this tablet and you really disappoint me.Got some great feedback from various people indicating that they can connect to their mobile phone's hotspot.  So, this likely only applies to phones that use the ad-hoc network.  I was using my Windows phone to create the hotspot and it uses ad-hoc network.  From the comments below, it sounds like you may be able to connect using an Android hotspot phone.  You should try your connection at the store before purchasing this product to make sure your phone works with this tablet.", "Title": "Good Tablet but OS does not connect to mobile phone wifi hotspot", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Author": "SSG Ausborn", "ReviewID": "R3F8TWWNABGJW6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you use a debit card they will charge you the $190 up front and will not be able to reimburse you.

With that in mind I have about 1gb left for apps and with the rest of my apps I have run out of space, try updating apps when out of space.......argh.  So why didn't I just get an SD card and move the apps over to it?  I bought one but not a single application can be moved over to it, even apps that I KNOW for a fact should be able to move to the card (Nexflix) for example...nope.  APP2CD does not allow it and Norton Utilities will not either.  So, I can't even update Google Currents for \"current news/tech stories\", it says my memory is full, guess I can delete some of the books but I don't want to and I don't want to play the game of \"do I like this application I installed last week enough or do I delete it to make room for this new app in the market, it looks cool\".  I am VERY upset.  If you plan on installing applications with big footprints or games that take advantage of the Nvidia chipset you better think twice.  One final note, in settings/storage it shows I still have over 2gb of space left, that is not app space it is picture/doc/video space.UPDATE: You cannot uninstall Kaspersky Tablet Security.

It had all the features I was looking for - all the ports, the right proc, Android 3.1, etc.And it was missing a feature I failed to check: pre-stressed glass (like Gorilla Glass). It also included 3 bonus \"features\" I had hoped not to see: lousy customer service, incompetent repair, and parts price gouging.  Lets take these one at a time, shall we?1. Lousy Customer Service: So one day my son drops the device no more than 2 feet flat onto its rubberized back on soft linoleum.  And the glass cracks. I called Toshiba to see if they might help me, as the product was purchased at full retail price just 2 weeks earlier.  The case and the tablet with tax came to ~$750.  Nope, the manager said they help no one under any circumstances when the glass cracks.  They assume it is always the customer's fault.  If you drop the tablet 1 inch and the glass breaks - your fault.  If the glass breaks when you are holding the product, or when you are taking off the back cover - your fault.  Don't laugh - there are numerous reports of Thrive glass breaking with no external stress.So Toshiba takes no responsibility in using cheap glass on a product they imply is \"tough\".  In fact, the opposite is true.  I told a friend about my Thrive experience, and he explained how his Xoom (which *has* Gorilla Glass) had survived being flung across his concrete garage after being forgotten on his SVU roof.  Compare this with reports Thrive screens cracking from *being held*.2. Incompetent Repair: So I considered sending my product in for repair.  Turns out the glass cost ~$200 to repair to start, or ~$310, at their discretion.  And then I found numerous posts on how poor and slow the repair was.  I decided to forego this adventure, so I ordered the parts to repair it myself.  $62 for the glass, and $10 for some replacement sponges.  At least I could live with that ...3. Parts price gouging: So what does an amoral company do when it releases a defective product?  Issue a recall and fix the defect?  No, Padawan, what do you think this is, Automotive?  Toshiba seizes the opportunity to maximize shareholder value by leveraging its awful product quality to gouge the consumer!  Remember the parts order I mentioned in (2) above?  Well, TWO WHOLE MONTHS after I ordered those parts from the Toshiba USA authorized parts dealer, the order was cancelled.  Why?  Because Toshiba \"reconfigured its supply chain\" and discontinued the glass.  But wait!  All is not lost: now I can get the same order with a $160 bezel + glass assembly, and the $10 sponges.  After shipping, the replacement cost therefore is nearly $200 for the glass, not counting my labor.  These days, I can buy an entire tablet at that price!If it weren't for the poor quality glass, the lousy customer service, the incompetent repair, or the parts price gouging, I'd recommend this product.  As it is, I'd recommend you look at a 10.1 tablet from Acer, Asus, Motorolla, or Samsung.

The tablet is heavier, which means, the bigger they are, the harder they fall, which means it's not as fun toting the tablet around. Portability is compromised.2) Speaker quality. In my testing, the sound was not very loud, it's tinny. And in fact my unit was defective because of the left speaker which eventually stopped working altogether. Was the low sound quality the result of the fact that my Thrive was only working with one full speaker, vs two? Maybe, but I don't think this aspect of the Thrive improves much with both speakers restored. (I am currently awaiting a replacement, but that's a different story. -I purchased my tab from elsewhere.)3) Speakers location. The speakers are on the \"bottom\" of the tablet, in landscape mode. Sure you can flip the thing over so that they face on the top, although one will run into problems when opening apps that use landscape natively and you find yourself having to flip the tab back over. The reason the locations make for bad design is that often the tab will be resting on something - your lap or your desk, where the speakers will be covered and therefore muffled. The sound on the Thrive is already relatively poor - it doesn't help to have the speakers covered as well. This is either a major flaw or a small annoyance depending on how you see it. (And because the tab is cumbersome, you'll NEED to rest it on your lap -- or risk dropping it!)4) Camera location. They are on the left side. On an Android tablet, the left hand does a lot of work. This means you'll be getting a lot of greasy smudges on the lens, both the front and back. And, again, sure you can use the tablet in portrait mode, or flip it over again in landscape and have the camera lens on the right side, but, again, this creates a different annoyance, eg, in portrait both speakers are now on one side only.5) Camera quality. The Thrive has a 2mb front and 5mb rear-facing camera. Seems good but videos taken with Thrive camera are adequate but just don't seem all that great. Don't expect to turn on the camera and be looking into a mirror.6) USB ports. - What? Isn't this the pro, nay, THE SELLING POINT, of the Thrive? Yes. But I list it as a con because a regular user such as myself with ordinary external harddrives, who doesn't use thumbdrives, will not be able to connect the Thrive to those harddrives. The Thrive does not recognize harddrives not formatted in exFat32. And it takes a long time for the Thrive to scan those drives that are in that format. So, the Thrive, championed for its connectivity, especially in comparison to the Ipad and Galaxy Tab, has ports that are pretty much useless. This is a major FAIL and can't be overstated. Until Toshiba releases updates that corrects this, this con is, IMO, the biggest one. It's a \"con\" in more than one sense.Pros:1) Fast charge time. From 5% to 99% charge, the Thrive takes a little more than an hour.However, its battery life was not more than 6 hours, that is with regular usage (in my hands at least - Youtube browsing, web browsing, app downloading, live wallpaper).Other reviewers claim 10+ hours. I have to wonder what they are doing with their tablets, if anything.Otherwise, the fast charge time kind of makes up for it.2) SD card slot. If you buy only the 16 gb version, you'll be fine because of that slot.3) User-replaceable battery. This is huge. All rechargeable batteries die. Some sooner than others. A replaceable battery is a huge selling and re-selling point. It gives the Thrive longevity.4) The Toshiba File Manager is an app in the Thrive that enables the user to browse files in memory very much like one would a PC. From what I understand, this is not easy to do in other Android tablets.5) User-replaceable back plate. There are 5 different, attractive colors. The feel of these back plates give substance to the Thrive. And because it's replaceable, it's disposable if it's ever worn in anyway.6) Ease of use. The Thrive operates smooth enough. Though I do find its battery life lacking, I am able to do what I normally do on a computer - execute programs, web browse, watch videos, play games listen to music -- with little if any lag.7) Looks better than most other Android tablets. This is subjective to me. But I just like its styling better than, say, the Asus Transformer, or, say, the Blackberry Playbook. But then again, the Thrive's styling is kind of related to many of the cons and annoyances I've noted with it.Overall, the Thrive is a capable tablet with a good enough speed and good enough screen- a screen better than my laptop and HDtv, in fact. But look elsewhere if you need a tab with adequate stereo sound and look elsewhere if you're looking for a light tablet you can use with one hand and don't have to worry about dropping or smashing into a wall.", "Title": "Portability is its selling point, yet it can't connect to anything...", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Author": "Amjedi", "ReviewID": "R3UZO98SEJ8QYY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the tablet but the apps pale in comparison to Ipad & Droid phones! I purchased the Thrive tablet because I like Toshiba computers and I love my Droid phone.  I assumed that at a minimum, the tablet would have the same apps that the phone has - WRONG!

Toshiba also brags about the superior quality of the picture when watching videos but you can only watch videos that you have stored on the tablet.  I don't want to store DVD's on the tablet; I just assumed that they would have apps for streamed media: (e.g., Netflix, Xfinity, HBOGO). This was a MAJOR disappointment.  I had major discussions/arguments about buying the Thrive over the Ipad with Ipad users and the one argument they kept giving me was that the Ipad had superior apps.  At the time, I thought this would not be a problem since I like the apps that I have on my Droid phone & assumed the tablet would have access to the same apps.

It is remarkable in that since the latest update, it seems to not be working properly.

The thrive has a user's guide link on the front screen, but it is an online link.  That meant no guide to hook up to the wireless.  I have an android phone so was familiar with the interface, but it seems putting the user manual on the system would have been painless and made life easier for customers new to the OS.I figured out how to get online, now I need to download the user's guide.  My thrive was a gift, so I don't know the model number.  No problem right?  Wrong, going to settings, about tablet, gives me a product version number and a name of AT105.  But the user manual cannot be accessed until I give it a product number of AT105-XXXXX.  I do not know the xxxxx so I have to go online on a different system, type the product number I found in system info into Google and have it tell me the product number I want.I finally get to enter the product number and go to a site that allows me to download the manual, unfortunately, having no user manual to tell me otherwise, I tap the link.  It turns blue and then back to white, nothing else happens.  Several tries later, I tap and hold the link, now I have some options.  Open, Open in new tab, Save link, copy link url, or select text.  None of these intuitively tell me to download or save file. So I try open.  So far it has been ten minutes and that apparently failed.  I decide on Save link, a window briefly opens saying starting download then disappears.There is a statement on the site that says \"Once downloaded, you'll find the User's Guide using the File Manager app.  Navigate to the download folder, touch the \"Thrive-AT-100_users_guide_062311.pdf\" file and open it with QuickOffice.  Remember, I still don't have a user's guide to explain what all that means.Now I finally get to the document.  As far as I can tell, there is no way to turn the page.  You scroll through a large document being careful not to shoot past the page you are looking for.  On the iPad, I swipe a finger, or if I am truly lazy just tap the edge of the screen I want to go in and I am on the next page.  This document requires me to scroll up and stop the scroll manually.  Annoying!!!Oh well, I need to register it now.  I tap register, it wants the serial number.  Back to settings about tablet, but there is no way to cut and paste the serial number so back to the PC, open notepad, type the SN then back to register and input the Serial number.  Imagine my dismay when I get this message in bright red letters, Internal error(RM101), please try again later or call 1-800-457-7777.So I call Toshiba customer support center.  Oh boy, I get to talk to the phone mail system.  I hate talking to the computer!  Once I get past the electronic sentry I get a guy that obviously does not speak my language as a primary one.  He wants my name, phone number, email address, yada, yada, yada....We finally get to my issue and he repeats everything back that I said and asks me if he understands my issue.  Then he puts me on hold to ask someone else what that error code is.

I can design and build computers, and develop software for them, that being said I think I know about computers and tablets.It's been 2 weeks and I believe its time for me to review this tablet.-Before I purchased my toshiba thrive, I've read so many positive reviews about it, and after owning a couple other tablets (which I will talk about) I figured Toshiba must have nailed it.I was wrong.-What makes Toshiba Thrive \"different\" than the other tablets?It has a full size USB and an HDMI outlet, do you really need these outlets? depends, most of us own both computers and a some sort of media center at hour homes, so don't let HDMI outlet fool you, having full size USB is okay but it is not like you will be using it everyday. It also has an user replaceable battery, you see this is 21st century we don't use these gadgets for more than 2 years anymore, back then in 90s we could use the same phone or PC for 3+ years, no more.  So why would you wanna replace the battery on a tablet? Toshiba is selling their battery for thrive for 69.99, sounds like its a good deal? well it is not. Apple will replace your iPad's battery for 105, and iPad's battery is about 2.5x times bigger than the thrive's battery (capacity wise). So the next question would be; does it worth having a tablet 2 times(almost) thicker than an iPad 2 just because you can replace the battery by your self? I would say No.Before talking about the battery life and performance I'd like to talk about Thrive's built quality, because that is one of the reasons I returned my thrive yesterday.-Built QualityI don't know what other reviewers were thinking when they wrote their reviews but Thrive has a cheap feel, it's not well built. I'll tell you why, first of all since I'm in the design field, I can tell that Toshiba didn't spend enough time to design this tablet, they rushed this to the market and  hoped to get a place in android tablet market, anyway like some other reviewers stated, the glass is not well glued, the bezel around the screen is lower or higher than the screen, like it's not at the same level with the glass, unless you push down the glass with your fingers. The \"chrome\" bezel around the cameras kills the tablet, like it's so cheaply made you see that sort of chrome plastic on cheaply made auto accessories, they could at least use some sort of brushed metal, chrome is not that popular anymore. The back cover is a joke. I have no clue what toshiba was thinking when they came up with that back cover, it has rough edges and the quality of the plastic is terrible, and instead of HUGE Toshiba logo, they could've put a nice THRIVE (very idiotic name for a tablet, and LG had a cell phone called thrive so I don't know why they picked that name, like T1 would be a better name for their first tablet with android os) logo on the back with a small Toshiba logo under it or somewhere. I even had a chance to buy other colors, got the silver cover on amazon and the blue one from best buy, they both look very cheap, and not worth 20 bucks. I'll put it this way, a 99 dollar refurbished amazon kindle looks and feels better than a 399 thrive, that little e-reader is very well built, and it doesn't look like you made it at home. (thrive lovers don't hate me, if you don't believe me, go hold a kindle or a Samsung Galaxy 10.1)Now you may be thinking that I'm just exaggerating what I wrote up there, well I'm not, I compared thrive with iPad, iPad 2, Galaxy 10.1, Xoom, Playbook. Asus Transformer, and Acer Iconia. I was fortunate enough to own and use all of those tablets I listed there, and still have the iPad 2.-ScreenToshiba claims their screen on thrive is superior, hmm I guess they haven't seen the screen on Samsung Galaxy 10.1 or the BB Playbook. There is simply nothing special with Thrive's screen and I don't like the vertical view on it. Galaxy 10.1 sure has a better screen.-PerformanceJust like many other honeycomb tablets toshiba has the nvidia tegra 2 cpu and 1 Gb ram,  thrive works just like a Galaxy 10.1 or a Xoom, never had any frozen screens or anything, so no issues with the performance.-Battery lifeVery impressive, I was able to surf/chat/watch stuff for about 11 hours, good thing about thrive's battery is, it can  be fully charged in about an hour, which really makes it special.-Hold and feelIt really is nice to hold it, you don't really get tired even though its somewhat heavier than the other tablets I have listed up there, the rubberized back feels good in your hands (wish it wasn't cheaply built), but unfortunately it feels cheap, its not the tablet you'd be proud to use during a business meeting.-Honeycomb on thrive (Operating system)Honeycomb is okay, since it works flash and great apps, it is the best OS on tablets (for now). User interface is a joke though, can't say I like the menus or the clock when you wake up your tablet. One thing that bothered me was Thrive came with so many junk apps and I wasn't able to remove them. Anyway unfortunately this is not a pure android tablet (like motorola xoom) meaning it gets its system updates from toshiba through toshiba service center app (very unnecessary), so while xoom is running the latest version of honeycomb, thrive users are stuck with 3.1 still.Like many other reviewers said it used to have the this problem causing users to reset their tablets after their tablets go to sleep because they refused to wake up from sleep, its fixed with the update toshiba released so its not a problem now, Honeycomb on thrive is still a bit buggy, but will please the regular users for now. Oh almost forgot, still no Netflix or Hulu support, that is a deal breaker at this point, after all who wouldn't like to watch Mad Men on their tablets before going to sleep?-AccessoriesThrive has like no accessories, toshiba has this case for thrive, which makes your thrive look like its a Britannica encyclopedia (not lying with the case it is almost as thick as a Britannica). So unlike iPad 2 or Galaxy you won't be seeing so many accessories for thrive, the dock (50 something dollars) works okay but not necessary and does not come with the charger so its somewhat rip off. Bluetooth stuff works great with thrive, I was able to use apple's bluetooth keyboard with it with no problems.-ConclusionIf you are planning to buy an android tablet and spend your hard earned dollars on something you'd like to enjoy while using it and be proud of it, thrive is not the tablet for you, if you are working at a construction site or a general contractor, toshiba thrive can satisfy your needs (not because its durable or anything, the rubberized back and thick design make the thrive suitable for construction site, where looks don't matter) but if you are using it at home or office then you might wanna go with another tablet, I know I will sound like a fanboy but for now the best android tablet is Samsung Galaxy 10.1, its very well built and looks nice. You also might wanna check the Motorola Xoom out, for 449 its a bargain, it has 32gb built in memory, and it's almost as good as the Samsung Galaxy 10.1.Also I'm not even talking about Acer Iconia or Asus EEE transformer as they are not worth talking about, they are both cheaply built, and I don't really support companies that mark up their prices then lower them according to their sales, like you could get an Acer Iconia for 399 from target about two weeks ago, and get a 100 dollars gift card with your purchase to spend on groceries or whatever you want. Same with Asus, transformer's price changes almost everyday its like stocks. This is somewhat frustrating because I'm sure nobody wants to see their gadgets for less than what they paid for them, that is what I like about Apple, iPad has been 499 (cheapest model) forever now.Anyway  I am rating thrive 3 stars but if they lower its price to 299 for the 8gig model and 349 for the 16 gig then it would deserve 3.5 stars.Last but not least, Sony will be releasing their tablet on September 16, it seems like its gonna be one of the best Android tablets, but I really don't think it will be better than the Galaxy 10.1 or Xoom, it won't have gorilla glass (they said they would make the tablet heavier), so the screen will get scratched if you don't have a screen protector, which I'm sure you wouldn't wanna ruin the design of a beautiful tablet with a screen protector, also it comes with Honeycomb 3.1 so they are already behind Galaxy 10.1 and Xoom, but its still worth checking out.Thanks for reading, and rating, you can leave your questions and comments, I'll make sure to reply.And I apologize for any grammar, or spelling mistakes I have.

I write cursively and wanted to find something to replace all my notebooks, without sacrificing my writing. The Thrive lacked in two major areas: First, it did not have any apps that even came close to resembling note taker hd that has been out for a while for the iPad. Second, and even more important, is that like many others have mentioned it will go to sleep and then not wake up without a manual restart.Therefore, even though I was willing to wait for an app to be developed, I was not willing to A) loose all my notes in the middle of class if it went to sleep, and B) have to sit there and wait for a full restart when I need to quickly jot down something the professor just said.Because Toshiba had known about the issue for at least a few months, according to the dates of the reviews at the time, I was concerned that they were not in any hurry to fix it.

I have an apple iPad and read the reviews online regarding the Thrive.  I liked what I read as well as the price so I bought it.  When my mother opened it at Christmas she was absolutely thrilled...until she started attempting to use it.  I thought she couldn't use it because she was my 67 year old mother so as I was trying to help her, I noticed the problem did not lie with her.  The apps are impossible to find.  Switching from one screen to another is easy because it did it automatically right when we were in the middle of something and didn't want to switch.  Also, it turned off all by itself whenever it wanted and right in the middle of things.  When I searched for the Facebook app, it told me it wasn't available in the app store.  The app store only had about 20 apps that were easily findable.  The Apple iPad puts this little tablet to complete shame.  I ended up returning the Toshiba and gave my mom an iPad which she absolutely adores.  It is a million and a half times more user friendly than this Toshiba.  My friend also bought her mom the Thrive and she, too, returned it for the exact same reasons.  My friend's mother actually had to have a girl with a degree in software engineering help her find apps for the thing.
