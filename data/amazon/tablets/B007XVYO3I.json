It is easy to navigate.  We were able to download the free games easily.  Nice thing is that we have bought two (pink for my daughter) and since each tablet gets games were were able to download and the games go onto your library, you can download all the contents to both tablets.  I had to replace my original tablet because the system did not turn on  (screen was black but you can hear the sounds).  I was able to switch out with no issues.", "Title": "Nice Tablet for my 3 going on 4 year old", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R27YIE2D40QXQL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The innotab is great but I was meaning to buy the innotab 2S.

He really enjoyed playing with it and didn't realize he was also learning.  He seemed to really like the camera and video options.  Love that you can move the camera to be forward or rear facing!!!  What a grea idea.  I feel this should have come with an ac adapter, since you have to buy the vtech brand it was rather costly.", "Title": "great learning tool", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Author": "BrainQuest", "ReviewID": "R8KF6I2PYGY27", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this for my nephew & he loves it!

My toddler is loving the games and books and the shows were easy to download so he can watch those too when all else fails.

That's why the ability to add movies, and music to the InnoTab will keep them busy for a while.  I put a 32GB SDcard in the tablet and loaded it with kid friendly songs and their favorite movies.  It was perfect out of the box.  I took it to a friends house to have her three year old try it out for me.  She played with it for hours on her own with only a few questions.  She enjoyed it so much that my friend is getting her one of her own.", "Title": "Movies and Music make this a winner", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3UBMSLFZU6ZKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Better Value then some of the other kids tablet type toys the apps are 2.99 and up so it's got a better value there too.", "Title": "Daughter loves it", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Author": "inxs", "ReviewID": "R1JLXB06IUV61X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Firstly the inno Tab would not let me load the program  from the computer to update the software and load the program this took two hours to sort out . Next the supposed two free apps downloaded the vanished into oblivion  and I wrote to the company for an explanation and I got zero reply. Apps run from $2.99 to $4.99 and the four batteries required  will last one day of use. One must purchase a power cord  or you will be paying for batteries every other day and the apps are as bad as \"apples\" lock on the market. Personally I think this item is pure hype created by a lot of people who think cash is an never ending commodity to keep your kid quiet and out of the road, I for one intend sending this back to Amazon  as I think it is pure rubbish !", "Title": "Too much Hype", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "ProductID": "B007XVYO3I", "Features": null, "ImgURL": null, "Name": null}}
