With the screen facing away from the sun, however, reflections of myself and the scenery behind me dominate the screen and make it difficult to read the text.	-4.772
However, the potentiometer was very sensitive and at first I over adjusted so that the pen was writing on the screen when it wasn't even touching the glass.	-4.990
Thus, unless you are looking directly at a right angle to where the pen is touching the glass, the image on the screen does not appear where you expect it to appear.	-5.116
