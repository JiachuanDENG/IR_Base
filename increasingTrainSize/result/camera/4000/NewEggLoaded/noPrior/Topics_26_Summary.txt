This camera has it all and can do it all, and for damn near 1/2 the price of its competitors.	-5.261
The good thing was, I hardly needed to use it even at night because it was so amazing at adjusting to the setting.	-5.396
This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings.	-5.436

Lens are somewhat limited at this point, but with lenses adapters the possibilities are endless.	-4.974
With a pancake lens like the Sony 16mm, the weight and size approximates an XZ2 or LX7.Also, when you point this camera and the pancake lens at a person, there is no "DSLR intimidation" and frown....	-5.080

Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*	-4.520
