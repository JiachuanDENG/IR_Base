And well, after trying several apps, I must say that best for writing are: Quill, Write and Papyrus.	-4.486

I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet.	-4.781
According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.	-4.836
But if you are working with it alone you will see that it is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.The camera is by far one of the weakest things in the tablet.	-4.848

This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.	-4.375
While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-	-4.624
I purchased a 32GB micro SD card to increase storage space for my videos.	-4.669

I am also disappointed that you can't shrink windows down to a single bar at the bottom of the screen like you can in Microsoft Windows for PC.	-5.175
Switching from one window to another merely requires a tap on the window you want to work in.	-5.300
And if you can't find your window, just hit the windows icon on the bottom and it shows a list of open windows.	-5.305
