In evening events like volleyball and soccer, I used ISO 800 and 1600 to still get fast shutter to stop the action.	-4.784
(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.	-4.971
The images are superb, the start up time and shooting speed are fast!	-5.019

I got this with my sony card and it was expensive but worth every dime.	-5.271
I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.	-5.361
The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.	-5.473

My only problem is that I have polarized sunglasses, and when I wear them, I can't see the image on the display screen.	-4.993
Very stealth with the flipout screen.	-5.026
You can customize 3 of the buttons on the back of the camera, and that helps tremendously, but there are still several things I wish were more readily available without fumbling through the menu.There is no viewfinder so you must frame your photos using the LCD screen, which can be difficult in bright light.	-5.064
Product: B005IHAIMA, Topic: 15
I can either have a viewfinder of a flash on, not both.	-5.075
If you buy the viewfinder then you cannot use the enclosed flash while the viewfinder is in use.	-5.211
With the latest firmware update, this is a great camera.	-5.585

Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*	-4.272
If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.	-5.356
I also noticed the same exact spots when is happened to use iso 100 and 1 second shutter speed.	-5.508

The help menu does really help with basic use of the camera.	-4.840
With that being said, the touchscreen menu is rather fool/idiot-proof because there are instructions on each menu and even helpful tips on how that function would be useful.	-4.997
