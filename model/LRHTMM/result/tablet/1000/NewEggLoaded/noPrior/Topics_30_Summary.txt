With some googling I discovered that I'd neglected to set the GMT time field.	-5.743
Also there is a pretty decent handwriting recognition software (the stellar Ink program) which does a good job of "learning" your handwriting over time and recognizing it and turning it into typewritten text (personally, I hardly ever use this feature though).Almost none of this is available on the bundled S-Note software, nor anything else I could find in Google Play.	-5.917

This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.	-4.605

I haven't decided yet whether to activate Dropbox or switch to SugarSync.I've had a few issues and was surprised to find Samsung Customer Support not very helpful.	-5.402

Blows the iPad AND Nexus 7 away.	-4.270
Yes, the iPad has a screen that is a bit more vibrant, but unless they are sitting side by side you will NOT notice the difference.	-5.078
But from the demos I have watched I think it will be fun!A few things to consider though before purchasing...first, the camera doesn't take the greatest pictures.	-5.425

I do not own any Apple or Android products, so I wasn't tied to either company.	-4.887

That is one thing the ipad seems to have over Samsung is the devices seem a little more resistant to trauma.	-4.754

I compared prices and specification and of course Amazon price won!	-4.833
Product: B008DWG5HE, Topic: 21
I guess I will again have to hunt for myself to see if I can find specs.I don't know whether Samsung is inexperienced in the tablet world and their customer service isn't up to speed, or they are reacting to all the litigation issues with Apple, or both, but I'm disappointed that I'm having to figure things out myself.	-5.654
*edited note*: For some reason, my customer image for a sample sketch isn't showing up for this product.	-5.846

Nice Unit.	-4.754
Still feels a bit plasticy, not as nice as ipad.Software - Everything seems to run without any hiccups, more polished and less buggy than what I've seen on Asus tablets.Let me know if there are any other aspects you'd like to get feedback on to help you make your decision on this tablet.	-5.422

While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-	-4.990
