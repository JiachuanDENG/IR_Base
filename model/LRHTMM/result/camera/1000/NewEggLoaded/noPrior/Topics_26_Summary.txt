You can put the focus precisely where you want it, which is great when shooting wide-open.	-4.393

No auto ISR on Manual mode (some DSLR's will let you do this).Overall,	-4.421
Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.	-4.483
The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.	-4.512

At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.	-4.695

My next camera will probably be a Nikon or a Canon, from a company that actually takes pride in their cameras.	-4.524
I have to explain that the camera has already been sent in for that issue and that the problem is something else.	-5.028

I am not a photographer, just a picture taker who appreciates good image quality.	-4.872
Still, it is a good quality lens that I am happy using, though at a higher price point (5r, natch) I might grumble more about the slowness/sharpness.I found the grip on the camera and the general feel to be good and had no problems in this area.The screen is pretty good in bright light.	-5.086
In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.	-5.160
Product: B005IHAIMA, Topic: 15
Excellent camera for the price.	-4.170
Lets get too the point  !	-4.274
This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings.	-4.591

I fiddled with the menus and took about 100 pictures and the battery retained less than about 30% of capacity.All in all, I was sorely tempted to keep this camera only for the superb images it produced but it would be silly for me to have one camera for "good" pictures and another camera for "features."	-5.201
Not great, but pretty good.	-5.217
only issue I have with it is a lot of features require you to go through the touch screen.	-5.355

At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.	-5.484
The following items were included along with the camera: warranty card, paper manual for the NEX-3/NEX-3C/NEX-5/NEX-5C, software disk, neck strap, usb cable, battery and charger and flash accessory with its respectable case.FIRST IMPRESSIONSI knew this camera was going to be small and compact, but when I took it out of its protective bag, it was even smaller than I anticipated.	-5.728
I inserted the memory card into my laptop and was able to confirm that the images turned out good.	-5.898

The camera is so good with low light that I almost never use the flash, but because the flash comes with a little plastic case that attaches right to the camera strap, the flash is always handy if needed.The bottom line:  I LOVE this camera, and though the menu is cumbersome I'd still buy it again because the low light capabilities are awesome.	-5.367
Sony threw in the 55-210mm lens (grateful!), and it has saved me at the school plays and a Memorial Day NY Mets game.	-5.370

Maybe its because of the high res sensor and the lens requires focus tuning or something.	-5.313
It matches this small and light camera with a small and light lens that is sharp and has a decently large aperture at F/2.8.	-5.349
The lens is a little bulky but hasn't been an issue.	-5.452

They both involve the screen flickering about 1/2 second after you turn the camera off under different circumstances.	-4.705
You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.	-4.770
You buy a $600 camera and the stupid developers can't even implement sequential file numbers for video files--only photos.	-4.822
