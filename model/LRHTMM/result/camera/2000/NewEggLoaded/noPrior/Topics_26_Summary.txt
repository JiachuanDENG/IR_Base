So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?	-5.146
Battery lasts for a while.	-5.299
Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.	-5.305

If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.	-5.293
I inserted the memory card into my laptop and was able to confirm that the images turned out good.	-5.642
There are pictures that you'll take that you will think are in focus by viewing the monitor that will be ruined by motion blur upon viewing on your home computer.	-6.024

Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*	-4.643
I can set the aperture to the minimum with Auto ISO but then the camera will favor something like 1/60s.)	-4.705
No auto ISR on Manual mode (some DSLR's will let you do this).Overall,	-4.801

Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.	-4.835
Possibly small ones.Battery life is pretty weak.	-5.595
No more guessing and losing the perfect shot (happened so many times!) because 1/4 remaining battery equates to 2 percent!This is the first time that the auto modes actually work for me.	-5.821

Defective after Sony Repair.	-4.328
Sony is finally acknowledging the problem just not saying what it is and if the fix will completely fix the problem.	-4.476
Who knows, and at this point, who cares.After one more call to Sony, they said they would have a technician call me, but so far, no one has called.	-4.646

Not exactly efficient, but at least the menus are not hard to navigate or use.The Bad:Battery life - Perhaps I am spoiled, but when I go out for a whole day of shooting pictures and video, I expect the battery to last the whole day.	-5.254
A 14mm lens would equal 28mm on a full frame.	-5.444
This should be equated into the total cost of ownership if a viewfinder is important to the consumer.The battery life seems good for now.	-5.538

Tap the screen to focus during movie (haven't tried it for photo--haven't tried it because touch screen so new to me on a camera).	-4.688
