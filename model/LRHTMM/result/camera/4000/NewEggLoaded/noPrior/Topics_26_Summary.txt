Having the two cameras set up differently means not having to fumble around trying to change menu settings btw auto and manual while on a shoot.	-4.122
It's simple, just switch to the Menu mode and then select Brightness/Color and ISO setting is right there.	-4.538
The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.	-4.572

Using this with Eye-Fi card, battery last about 160-200 shots.	-4.641
But you probably already know that so I thought I'd mention a few of the cons... none of which would make me downgrade my rating, but could be important to you.CONS (The pros would take too long to write):- The battery takes FOREVER to charge, it took an hour on a new and empty batter just to get enough charge to format my SD card, overnight for a full charge.	-5.844
My Canon batteries charge from empty to full power in under 2 hours.-	-5.975

After it focuses you can also manually fine-tune the focus to your object.	-4.761
The images are just as great, both in contrast and sharpness, when paired with old manual focus lenses once you get the focused right.	-4.829
The camera is great.	-4.858

This should be equated into the total cost of ownership if a viewfinder is important to the consumer.The battery life seems good for now.	-5.309
This happens using a (spare) battery used in the NEX-5.	-5.415
This issue is probably worth taking up to 1/2 a star off the rating of the lens itself but not worth making a stink over or even worth returning it.The camera, with the adapter and either of the lenses, transformed into a small DSLR.	-5.606

Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*	-4.567
Switching modes is requires several button pressesLowlight auto focusing slow and very unreliableTouchscreen interface nearly useless.	-5.323
(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.	-5.329
