They both involve the screen flickering about 1/2 second after you turn the camera off under different circumstances.	-4.910
The first way is handheld, and using its rear LCD screen.	-5.321
The screen turns blue and flashes 'camera error'.	-5.426

I use my manual lenses on M or A modes, but have been using several of the scene modes where it will adjust shutter speed and ISO and other parameters to give you their scene shot.	-4.854
