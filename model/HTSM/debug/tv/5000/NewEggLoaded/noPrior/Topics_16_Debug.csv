4693,1,1,"i recently had a sony in which i had reacurring problems with.come to find out there was a recall and sony would not fix it.they tried to sell me a new tv at a discount but in reality it was the same price i could of picked it up at best buy.did some research on it and then that one was recalled because they were catching on fire.done with sony tvs.but any way my parents had picked up a samsung 7500 series which made it a no brainer to pick up a samsung.glad i did the 7100 series has done nothing but impress me the more i watch it.it is the next model down from the 7500 but difference is really not noticeable.a few features maybe.i have watched a few 3d movies and it seems as expected and in hd feels like you could pop your head inside the tv.resident evil afterlife was a dumb movie till i watched it in 3d where things were actually coming out of the tv.hd this tv is so clear its amazing.any non hd channels its not going to shine.i cant really comment on the online or internet surfing.i have a built up pc for entertainment and gamming running threw my entertainment system for years.sad thing now with smart tvs is there catching on and now there is a market for online entertainment so its not free any more.but any way as far as pc gamming for the pc geeks out there.all i can say is wow.max settings 3d tombe raider crysis ect.turn on the 3d calibrate pc nvidia and you will see these games in a whole new light.i did give it a 4 star because its not perfect but nothing major.sound is mediocre but then i have a pretty good surround set up but still would like to use tv for dialog and center channel.sometimes hard to hear the dialog over the action.another thing is 1700 dallar tv and it comes with cheezy 3d glasses.need some that block out any glare from the sides.i want 3d goggles that wrap around your eyes blocking out every thing but the tv.best thing about the purchase i think is i picked this tv up for 1175 at best buy but i do recommend getting the warranty.so that s another 250 for a 5 year geek squad warranty.",-1,0,2,0.408955,0.088007
