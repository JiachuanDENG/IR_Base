0,2,1,Automatic capture mode has so far easily handled all the subjects and situations I have tried it on, even ones that didn't work with for previous cameras I have used.,0,1
0,2,2,Image Stabilization managed to produce usable although slightly "misty" pictures (as seen on a 17" laptop full screen) in dim light using a 300mm (actual) lens hand-held; the camera adjusted the ISO to a much higher than normal value so as to use a high enough shutter speed to make it work.,0,1
0,2,3,This is an excellent "point and shoot camera" with almost any other features needed for those impossible artistic shots.,0,1
0,2,4,A little too small for my large hands but I think I will get used to using it.,1,0

3,2,1,I've had it about 3 months and I'm really pleased.,0,0
3,2,2,I'm amazed with how nice the photos turn out.,0,0
3,2,3,The color and light balance in the photos is excellent.,0,0

4,2,4,Not the fastest autofocus but sufficient, high iso good up to 1600.,1,0
5,2,0,If you are anything like me, then you want an extremely capable and rugged SLR but don't want the bulk of the Semi-Pro SLRs like the Nikon d300 or Canon 50D.,0,1
5,2,1,Compared to these beasts, the Pentax K7 is small enough to not leave behind when you are hesitant to bulk up your travel bag or backpack.,0,1
5,2,2,Pair it with a Pentax Pancake lens, and you've got the Ferrari of SLR's.,0,1
5,2,3,You're getting built-in image stabilization, a 100% viewfinder, built in HDR, full weather sealing, a 3" high res screen, electronic level finder, quiet shutter, and excellent high ISO images that don't look smeared over from excessive noise reduction.,0,1
5,2,4,I recently traveled through Europe with a K7 armed with the 15mm Limited lens, and the capability to shoot indoors at ISO 1600-3200 and a stabilized 1/5 second shutter speeds with such a small combination of body and lens is nothing short of miraculous.,0,1
5,2,5,It doesn't fit in my pocket.,1,1
6,2,0,-solid construction
-top-grade viewfinder and screen, you really notice coming from a K100D for example
-packed with all the menu options youd expect of a pro/prosumer SLR, including bracketing, interval shooting, etc
-feels good in the hands, good weight to it,0,0
6,2,1,-video mode isn't perfect, you can't set the shutterspeed or sensitivity, however you can lock it in place, resulting in sometimes awkward but not impossible video shooting
-menus aren't as visually refined as competitors, but just as functional,1,1

10,2,4,Pro-ish movie mode.,0,0
10,2,5,Not the greatest auto focus but more than passable.,1,0

10,2,7,Has features most might not use or need.,1,0
10,2,8,Seems like you pay a lot for the swivel screen but its a darn good one.,1,0

11,2,1,High ISO means nothing when the result is garbage.,1,1
11,2,2,I actually owned two of these, after returning the first one.,1,1
11,2,3,It wasn't a fluke.,1,1
11,2,4,The average consumer might not notice this, but a professional should.,1,1
11,2,5,And manual mode only produced very average results at best.,1,1
11,2,6,Indoors with all the lights on, it would jump up to ISO 1600 (full auto setting).,1,1
11,2,7,Yet, in a side by side comparison, my XTI would sit comfortably at 400 ISO.,1,1
11,2,8,Manual settings with the exact same lenses between the two produced nearly identical images.,1,1
11,2,9,The 60D was not perceptibly better.,1,1
11,2,10,For a brand new camera to produce results similar to, let alone worse than, a 6 year old camera is hugely disappointing.,1,1
11,2,11,Auto focus was not great either.,1,1
11,2,12,Images weren't crystal clear.,1,1
11,2,13,Colors not defined well.,1,1
11,2,14,Video is still not advanced enough yet to be more than a gimmick.,1,1
11,2,15,Manually focusing video is frustrating.,1,1
11,2,16,Makes the video feature almost useless.,1,1
12,2,0,amazing features & outstanding photo and video quality.,0,0
12,2,1,Canon quality it phenomenal.,0,0
12,2,2,pricey, but you really get what you pay for.,1,1

expensive cameras but are accessible via menu  instead of direct control.,0,1
17,2,2,Auto adjust is fast enough to catch just about any kind of action in any light 
and compact enough to use as an every day camera.,0,1
17,2,3,BTW - the D3100 is the same camera inside as the D3200 but at a lower 
price.,0,1
17,2,4,The price here is about $200 overpriced compared to most well known online camera shops.,1,1
18,2,0,It's just a great starter level DSLR, it takes a stunning pictures and a beautiful 1080p video, buy it if you gonna use it for family profissional pictures, or you want to start in the photography world with a cheap and great quality DSLR.,0,0
18,2,1,the only problem I guess is it doesn't have a Microphone jack.,1,1
18,2,2,However I used an alternative way to record my audio with a separate audio recorder.,1,1
19,2,0,This camera takes stunning photos even on the auto settings!,0,1
19,2,1,But to take some really gorgeous photos you can just play around with the settings.,0,1

20,2,0,Nice photo quality.,0,0
20,2,1,Good to use for photoshooting,0,0
20,2,2,Microphone is terrible and there is no external mic input jack.,1,1

21,2,2,- Takes great pictures.,0,0

21,2,5,I did considerable research and found this to be the best bang for the buck.,0,0

22,2,0,I picked up one of these puppies a few weeks ago for my study abroad trip in Taiwan.,0,0

22,2,2,The lady who sold me this camera also threw in a free lens cleaning kit along with a $10 haze/UV protector.,0,0
22,2,3,Awesome bonus as well.,0,0
22,2,4,The 18-55mm VR kit lenses are excellent for taking everyday photos and can also be used for light macro shots.,0,0
22,2,5,Night shots, however, it does a great job or making a completely dark area bright if you set up a few settings via Manual mode (search up "tips for DSLR" into You Tube)

In Aperture mode (the mode I prefer), I use an F number of either 3.5 or 5 to easily blur out the background from the subject I'm focusing on.,0,0
22,2,6,Along with an ISO of either 400-1600 in quite mode, I get sharp and stunning results.,0,0
22,2,7,Comparing the D3100 to its predecessor, the D3000, there is not much difference in build quality as the two cameras are both made of plastic and rubber.,1,1
22,2,8,The D3100 still has a burst rate of 3FPS, which is the same as the D3000.,1,1
22,2,9,But however, this is still an entry level DSLR so it's completely understandable.,1,1
23,2,0,Good to its word the camera is water and outdoor proof (I live in the rainy PNW) and it handles rain and cold very well.,0,0
23,2,1,So far underwater pool pictures are good Good wide angle lense, however see cons.,0,0
23,2,2,Easy to use, but read the manual.,0,0
23,2,3,Lots of different settings, small and lite.,0,0
23,2,4,Good LCD screen.,0,0
23,2,5,As other reviewers have noted the image quality is fair to poor in most light conditions.,1,1
23,2,6,At wide angle, if there is any bright light on the side your image will be cloudy, off and have fractures in it.,1,1
23,2,7,The colors at night using the flash are un clean and high noise rate.,1,1
23,2,8,Thankfully I have Photoshop and can clean up many of the images.,1,1
23,2,9,(yes, I read the manual and know how to take pictures).,1,1
23,2,10,The lack of optical or image stabilization has now been shown to me to be a critical factor, sormething I won't make a mistake again on a camera.,1,1
23,2,11,I want the ability to take a camera and shoot in differnt light conditions, especially a high end digital camera such as this.,1,1
23,2,12,Eats and I mean eats batteries.,1,1
23,2,13,Figure about 75 shots per charge.,1,1
23,2,14,A second battery is not an option but a necessity.,1,1

24,2,0,Very nice features like 10 mp 5opt zoom 28mm wide angle.,0,0
24,2,1,Everything worked for the most part BUT...,0,1
24,2,2,After testing movie mode I heard a cracking noise in back round of all the movies I made under extremely quiet situations, I knew right then and there I had to go through the hassle of sending this thing back,not kool at all.,1,1
24,2,3,The camera itself was kinda cheaply made but the pics was very good.,1,1
25,2,0,Internal lens mechanism - no dust or pressure (I broke my first camera by accidentally pressing the on button in my pocket)

Waterproof ... need I say more?,0,0
25,2,1,Amazing macro ability and great quality, especially for the form factor

High ISO of 6400 (I could not ask for more... well I could but even 1500$ camera's don't give more that this for now.. heck most don't even give that much yet!),0,0
25,2,2,If I want manual control or a super zoom I go over to my DSLR, this is not what this camera is made for and thats ok.,1,1
25,2,3,It does what it is supposed to do and does it great!,1,1
26,2,0,First, the price.,0,0
26,2,1,Second, the pictures are very good.,0,0
26,2,2,I mean for that price, I did not expect something extremely amazing, but the pictures are more that just good enough.,0,0

27,2,1,Many top end cmaera don't have this feature.,0,1
27,2,2,Also with it being compatible with my 30 year old pentax K-Mount lenses it was like getting a $6000.00,0,1
27,2,3,camera for less than $60.00,0,1
28,2,0,Easy set-up, nice functionality,0,0
28,2,1,No time-stamps, The motion detection simply takes a picture every interval, it doesn't detect motion at all, changing the location doesn't help, changing the sensitivity doesn't help, the camera emailed me 350 pictures of a blank chair in the course of two hours.,1,1
28,2,2,What good is this!,1,1
29,2,0,Comes with Secureview Pro software 2.01.,0,1

29,2,2,This one has the worst picture of all the cams I have, the new version firmware is missing a very important feature which is time date stamp overlay on the 121wn 1.2.2 build 23 firmware.,1,1
29,2,3,Video/Audio *Camera Overlay Setting is just gone!!!,1,1
30,2,0,Good build quality and features for the price.,0,0

31,2,2,then turned connected my android phone to my home wireless.,0,1

32,2,4,SecurView Pro on the PC is kind of garbage.,1,1
32,2,5,I just stick to the web browser when viewing on the computer.,1,1
32,2,6,Unfortunately to get the full functionality of the website viewer you need to use IE.,1,1
33,2,0,Setup was quick (I used web setup)
Wireless 11n worked flawlessly
UI is responsive and seems stable
iOS viewer app,0,1
33,2,1,IR LEDs only effective out to 60cm (work at 850nm)

34,2,0,Great Camera !,0,0
34,2,1,Works wired with very little problems.,0,1
34,2,2,This is why I had bought this product so I could monitor my backyard (it is useless unless I use a 250ft cord).Technical support ?,1,1
34,2,3,Well I was chatting with a nice lady from a very poor connection in another country who you could hardly understand even with English.Hopefully I will get a USA bound support for this otherwise,1,1
35,2,0,When I saw a camera bundle for $100 less than just the camera and body on any other website, I was scared it would be a scam.,0,0
35,2,1,Thanks for proving me wrong!,0,0
35,2,2,Everything is functional and works great, and shipping was super fast, thanks to being in a state nearby.,0,0
35,2,3,Absolutely would buy again,0,0
35,2,4,The quality of some of the add-ons is a bit cheap, the screen protector is a universal sheet that you have to cut, and doesn't account for the curved edges of the camera's display.,1,1
35,2,5,The flash and camera bag seem to be a bit cheap in quality (the bag is vivitar, so relatively consumer-grade.),1,1
35,2,6,But you can't beat it for the price!,1,1
36,2,0,Good video quality,0,0
36,2,1,Doesn't have the capability of emailing motion detection via yahoo or google making it virtually worthless or security.,1,0

37,2,4,Too flaky to pay full price.,1,1
38,2,0,- Low cost

38,2,1,Worked for 5 minutes then only displays white image.,1,1
38,2,2,Tried reset, different computers, etc.,1,1

40,2,0,Fairly good wirelaess range.,0,0
40,2,1,Motion Detect sensitivity does not work.,1,1
40,2,2,When motion detection is enabled, the camera sends hundreds of emails in just a couiple of minutes indicating a "motion event".,1,1
40,2,3,The adjustment for the sensitivity of the camera appears to be non-functioning.,1,1
41,2,0,Makes a good web cam, but thats not what I was looking for.,0,1
41,2,1,Will only work when connected to my computer.,1,1
41,2,2,Does not work with my wireless network and won't even work when connected with an ethernet cable to my network.,1,1
41,2,3,I know price is reasonable, but even at this price point, no one should have to invest hours of their time to install something such as this.,1,1
42,2,0,Good picture quality, nice using it with the iPhone/iPad app,0,0
42,2,1,Impossible to set up for remote monitoring, won't work beyond my own network.,1,1
42,2,2,And the motion detect either sends a continuous stream of images via email, or doesn't work at all.,1,1
42,2,3,It shouldn't be this hard.,1,1
43,2,0,Once you get it running, the menu's and options are all well explained enough to make the use of the product easy and reasonably trouble-free.,0,0
43,2,1,Overall I'm pretty happy with this purchase.,0,0
43,2,2,The software absolutely requires you to use IE.,1,1
43,2,3,If you don't have a computer that has IE that would definitely be a reason to look elsewhere.,1,1
43,2,4,Image resolution is a little low, but I knew that before purchasing the product.,1,1

47,2,8,There was no warning that the battery was low as screen showed full battery bar but would shut down and fail to turn back on.,1,1
47,2,9,VERY SLOW time between taking a picture and the ability to shoot again as camera stores picture to card.,1,1
47,2,10,Seemed like seconds when wanting to take second shot right away.,1,1

49,2,7,camera is slow to react sometimes (millisecond delays, but noticable).,1,1
49,2,8,this camera is not ideal for shooting sports events because there is a short delay between pressing the shutter button and capturing the picture.,1,1
49,2,9,it also takes about a half second to save photos at max resolution.,1,1
49,2,10,biggest con for me was the use of a non-standard usb port. it does not use a typical usb mini connector.,1,1

56,2,6,Outstanding startup and focus speed, face dectection works, the movie mode is perfectly adequate.,0,0
56,2,7,Fuji dropped aperture & shutter priority modes from F31fd.,1,1
56,2,8,The manual mode is limited to basically exposure compensation.,1,1
56,2,9,However, there is a great selection of predefined shooting modes (scenes).,1,1
56,2,10,Get accustomed to their settings and you'll be able to approxmiate the full manual control very nicely.,1,1
56,2,11,I also would like to choose JPEG compression quality, rather than make do with the factory set one.,1,1

62,2,0,Lots of different modes to choose from, nice and small and lightweight, turns on quickly, easy to use and navigate the menu system.,0,1
62,2,1,You have to take the battery out of the camera to recharge (unless you buy another accessory), I found the LCD quality to be quite poor (even on the bright setting), and the quality was not very good.,1,0
63,2,0,Great picture quality out doors!,0,0

66,2,12,Memory card slot is separate from the battery compartment.,0,0
66,2,13,After taking literally hundreds of shots (many of the same thing multitudes of times) this camera just isn't consistant.,1,1
66,2,14,Indoor shots are grainy, grainy, grainy.,1,1
66,2,15,The camera struggles to focus indoors and compensates by using a higher ISO.,1,1
66,2,16,Anything over ISO 200 is pretty much useless but that's not uncommon in a point and shoot.,1,1
66,2,17,Outdoors this camers fares infinitely better.,1,1
66,2,18,The bundled Fuji software is useless, I like the MS wizard much better, it's faster and doesn't automatically move the photo's into the Fuji folder (without asking) where it's much more complicated to do any adjustments or cropping.,1,1
66,2,19,The USB door and the battery door both seem somewhat flimsy.,1,1
66,2,20,Time will tell.,1,1
67,2,0,Price is right.,0,0
67,2,1,Outdoor pictures come out great.,0,0
67,2,2,The battery life is around 500 pictures or more depending on use.,0,0

67,2,5,Indoor pictures come out a bit grainy and yellowed in natural light.,1,1
67,2,6,The flash is almost too bright for indoor pictures.,1,1
67,2,7,I had the camera glitch saying "Memory Full" once an SD card had filled.,1,1
67,2,8,It would no longer take a photo.,1,1
67,2,9,After formatting the card, buying a new card, trying everything - I almost gave up.,1,1
67,2,10,I stumbled onto a fix - I removed the card, turned on the camera and took a picture into its internal memory.,1,1
67,2,11,This cleared the Memory Full lockout, and I could use SD cards again.,1,1
68,2,0,Great Camera for a terrific price!!!,0,0
68,2,1,The macro setting is what I bought the camera for since I like to take a lot of pictures of the flowers and fish that I catch.,0,0
68,2,2,No problems with my computer finding it, but didn't come with an install disk so some computers might have trouble finding it.,1,1
69,2,0,10x Optical Zoom, 7.1MP, wide array of shooting options (including manual shutter speed controls), ergonomic design fits comfortably in your hands and feels "sturdy and balanced", SLR-like design, entry-level price,0,1

70,2,3,Slight lag in button push and picture take on some manual settings NO other cons found yet,1,0
71,2,0,Great  "Prosumer" dig.,0,1
71,2,1,camera for the price (and it's now about a hundred $ less than last year's average price).,0,1
71,2,2,7-megapixels, 10x optical zoom lens (38-380mm in 35mm equivalence), a lot of exposure modes, takes SD and xD cards, takes very good movies with sound (and you can even zoom while shooting movies).,0,1
71,2,3,Uses 4 AA batteries, so you're never far from spares (but get a set of 2400 NiMH rechargeable batteries for better use).,0,1
71,2,4,It can capture 3 frames in under 2 seconds in "Top 3"mode and continuously at about 2 second intervals in "Long Period" mode.,0,1
71,2,5,A ISO range of 64 to 1600 (but shadows start to get a little noisey at 400 and highlights at 800).,0,1
71,2,6,Any negatives I have are more: "I wish it had" than real cons.,1,0
71,2,7,I wish it had a "bulb" setting to give a little more creativity to the user.,1,0
71,2,8,(it has a 4 sec.,1,0
71,2,9,to 1/1000 shutter range)
If you don't want to use the large (2.5") rear LCD, for framing your shots, it uses an eye level electronic view finder (EVF).,1,0
71,2,10,Either of which are always on and can be a power usage concern - although, battery life was still pretty good.,1,0
71,2,11,I used the camera on and off for a day and captured about 170 pix using 2400mAh batteries.,1,0
71,2,12,I wish it had and optical eye level view finder, but then there would be parallax problems with the 10X zoom and the cost of linking the optics to the view finder would surely add a lot more to the price (keep saving for a DSLR if you want features like that).,1,0
71,2,13,Image color is very good, but... areas of high contrast - say where the sky meets the trees - has some bluish purple fringing.,1,0
71,2,14,Still, the images I took that were under even contrast or those at sunset were awesome!,1,0
72,2,0,A lot of features for the price, it's nice and hefty as well so it keeps steady.,0,0
72,2,1,The larger shots always turn out grainy, it might be something I set wrong, but I doubt it.,1,1
73,2,0,This little camera blows any compact  digital camera away in terms of image quality.,0,1
73,2,1,6 MP might sound like not enough to newbies with no clue about digital cameras and sensors....do some research!,0,1
73,2,2,This camera has outstanding high ISO capabilities  and will blow any compact away @ ISO 200 and up.,0,1
73,2,3,Newer model out right now Fuji FinePix F31fd.,1,1

74,2,2,The best thing is you can tweak this thing all day long.,0,0
74,2,3,Small, light, quick and the biggest kicker this is under $130.,0,0
74,2,4,Had to tweak the audio some.,1,1
75,2,0,Very good picture quality, comparable to canons that are almost 3x the price of this one.,0,0
75,2,1,Also, great features for something in this price range.,0,0
76,2,0,I strapped this cam to the front of my RC helicopter to film from the air, well one day my heli stopped working in mid flight and CRASHED in 6 inch grass from 60ft with the camera on board!!!,0,0
76,2,1,The only damage was the little plate on the dial poped off, I couldn't find it but the camera will show you on screen what mode you are in when you turn the dial.,0,0
76,2,2,The pics are extremely crisp, but as with all cams it is best if you use a tripod.,0,0
76,2,3,A 2gb SD card gets me 1000 8MP pictures, but only 16 mins of high quality video.,0,0
76,2,4,The battery pack lasts a long time, and its really nice not to have to mess with AAA's and AA's.,0,0
76,2,5,The mic on it sucks for video recording, low volume.,1,1
76,2,6,ALSO the stupid cam freezes my comp if I try to use the cable to connect the cam to my comp.,1,1
76,2,7,I have to remove the memory card each time and use a card reader to retrieve my photos or vids.,1,1
76,2,8,AND the SD access is next to the battery which is right next to where it mounts to a tripod, so you have to remove it from the tripod to gain access to the SD card.,1,1

84,2,1,Sliding cover on the front of the camera fingerprints easily and occasionally the lens gets fingerprints on it when the camera is being turned on or off; the LED buttons can be challenging to operate if you have pudgy fingers; pictures in low lighting aren't as great as they could be, but they're still decent (I haven't played around with the various ISO settings, yet),1,0

91,2,6,It's a bit small for my hands, but manageable.,1,1
91,2,7,The included USB cable is proprietary, so you can't use a standard one to connect to a computer.,1,1
91,2,8,It is also fairly short.,1,1
91,2,9,The USB cable connects in the bottom of the camera, so the camera must be laying down while connected to your computer.,1,1
91,2,10,I specifically got it for a 2700 mile road trip and was disappointed that it stopped working with the lens stuck in the extended position a few hours into the first day.,1,1

97,2,5,Very high res images.,0,0
97,2,6,Simple design.,0,0
97,2,7,Not a good first digital camera for people that arent very "tech-savvy".,1,0
97,2,8,Buttons have several uses (because theres like 4).,1,1
97,2,9,So overall it's not the most user-friendly for people with not too much experience.,1,1
97,2,10,But if you have had a casio in the past you should have no problems.,1,1
98,2,0,High pixel count, great video quality, good battery life even with external gps, works well with inexpensive battery grip if using the live view more.,0,0
98,2,1,can zoom live view to focus video, face detection focus mode works well for video.,0,0
98,2,2,Love the controls, that are similar to d300 for me, which I was looking to upgrade.,0,0
98,2,3,Ton's of features.,0,0
98,2,4,I like that it can take my older "d" lenses that lack motors.,0,0
98,2,5,the Eye-Fi pro card works well with it and is cheap enough.,0,0
98,2,6,custom menu!,0,0
98,2,7,Very heavy.,1,1
98,2,8,especially to carry all day, specially with grip.,1,1
98,2,9,Size can be intimidating to your subjects but they get used to it.,1,1
98,2,10,Very difficult to focus hand-held, sharp/without blur compared to D300 due to higher pixels and heaviness of camera and it's more apparent when reviewing later than on camera.,1,1
98,2,11,I think I would have liked to have the D810 60fps 1080p mode.,1,1
99,2,0,Resolution will no longer be an issue.,0,1
99,2,1,Test the pixel noise at high ISO in full sunlight;  there really isn't anything there to speak of.,0,1
99,2,2,Auto focus is always better than I can do manually.,0,1
99,2,3,Auto color balance has always been correct.,0,1
99,2,4,Battery life has been great.,0,1
99,2,5,Resolution is so sharp that the apparent depth of field has shallowed so much that nearly all normal photos need to be taken at f16 or higher.,1,1
99,2,6,Grease in shutter forced me to get a pro cleaning when I was sloppy cleaning the sensor myself.,1,1
99,2,7,With a great lens, I have no excuses for poor photos other than myself!,1,1
100,2,0,Build Quality, Image Quality, Uncompressed HDMI-out video, dual card slots, battery life, Accurate focus tracking, wide range of customization options, no shallow DOF loss due to FX sensor.,0,0
100,2,1,both of the dual card slots could be SD even though CF has higher potential throughput (not many CF cards have higher throughput than SD currently and CF is alot more expensive), slower burst rate than competing models (although the product is not positioned towards sports photographers), heavy, huge images (slow to upload onto traditional HDD RAID array despite CF card having 120 MB/s read), need expensive flash memory to take full advantage of features, only one Fn button, built in flash feels a bit flimsy for a professional model.,1,1

102,2,1,Lots of features.,0,0
102,2,2,This is a very nice camera for studio and architecture shots.,0,0
102,2,3,I was really impressed with how many pictures  i thought were garbage at first, but I was able to recover (shooting in raw)  and actually made them look good to really good.,0,0
102,2,4,Heavy, loud shutter.,1,1
102,2,5,The other down side is mostly due to high resolution; working with large raw files is rather intensive and quite noticible (iMac, Core i7/16GB).,1,1
103,2,0,This was my very first digital camera and the camera that introduced me to photography.,0,0
103,2,1,Although I've upgraded to a DSLR, I still keep this one around "just in case.",0,0
103,2,2,Not being able to manually focus, but this is just a point and shoot so that's understandable.,1,1
104,2,0,Excellent specs -- 3" LCD screen, 5x optical zoom with wide angle, 10 MP, good menu system,0,0
104,2,1,Fuji's quality control and repair, small and light to the extent that it's a bit hard to operate some controls and to hold it steady for shooting,1,1

109,2,1,Beautiful colors, good contrast, nice transitions.,0,0
109,2,2,The internal memory of 512MB is more than adequate but....,0,1
109,2,3,no USB cable provided so you cannot upload to the gratuitous memory- adding a cable would have been nice.,1,1
109,2,4,Inputting the SD card is a little awkward however this is very minor.,1,1
109,2,5,I found that on some of my resized photos do not display correctly (colors completely messed up).,1,1
109,2,6,They display fine on my computer and any photo display program I use (Picasa, Adobe, Windows Pic Viewer).,1,1
109,2,7,This might just be an incompatibility between the resizing program and the photo frame.,1,1
109,2,8,I resized using Picasa and they displayed ok.,1,1
110,2,0,This frame has a nice, simple design without a lot of wasted space around the border or an illuminated logo.,0,1

110,2,5,No menus or setup.,0,1
110,2,6,Plays from internal memory cards or USB drive, even a USB powered harddrive.,0,1
110,2,7,The interface is very simple, which is mostly good.,1,0
110,2,8,But it is a little to simple.,1,0
110,2,9,For instance, there is a switch that controls how long each picture shows.,1,0
110,2,10,It also controls which transition is used.,1,0
110,2,11,So if I want the pan and zoom transition I have to set it to 10 seconds.,1,0
110,2,12,5 or 60 seconds are the other choices with thier own transition.,1,0
110,2,13,A little more flexibilty would have been nice.,1,0
111,2,0,Nice frame, does not look cheap like some of the "off" brands.,0,0

113,2,10,Poor flash and color were the issues.,1,1
113,2,11,I now own a Canon SD1100 IS.,1,1
113,2,12,I'm not sure what type of product testing Fuji does before launching a new product.,1,1

117,2,1,Has great potential but...,0,0
117,2,2,Lets start with the small ones.,1,1
117,2,3,First, mode switch to the upper left of the view finder is easily bumped, which will totally change the camera operation.,1,1
117,2,4,Canon has a $150 modification that puts a lock on it.,1,1
117,2,5,$150 for something that should be done at the factory?,1,1
117,2,6,Second, getting into the video mode is not easy or intuitive.,1,1
117,2,7,In fact, without the manual, I don't think you could get into video mode.,1,1
117,2,8,But thats just nits to pick.,1,1
117,2,9,The imagery is junk, 90% of the shots are soft at high enlargement factors.,1,1
118,2,0,Loving this camera!,0,0
118,2,1,Great build quality.,0,0
118,2,2,Low light ability is amazing!,0,0
118,2,3,Pretty much holds true to all the great reviews I have read.,0,0

118,2,6,Glad Canon includes a decent software package, including remote control software.,0,0
118,2,7,Really happy to have Full Frame!,0,0
118,2,8,Color rendition is better than Nikon.,0,0
118,2,9,HD video is pretty slick, although not a feature I see myself using much.,0,0
118,2,10,The auto focus system on the 5Dii is noticeably sub par compared to the Nikon D300 or D700.,1,1
118,2,11,Although that isn't a big deal for my subject matter.,1,1
118,2,12,I am really missing the on demand grid lines that Nikon and Fuji offer, have to change the screen on Canon.,1,1
118,2,13,Also miss the voice memo feature, have to step up to a 1 series to get that on a Canon.,1,1
118,2,14,Custom menu is nice, but Fuji has a better menu system.,1,1
118,2,15,Canon includes a better software package than Nikon, Fuji has better tethered software out of the box.,1,1
118,2,16,The 5Dii has impressive color, but still lags Fuji's color straight out of the camera.,1,1
118,2,17,Also prefer Nikon's thumb wheel much better.,1,1
118,2,18,Rubber flaps on the side ports are clunky when using multiple ports at once.,1,1
118,2,19,Live Mode hasn't been as useful as I had hoped.,1,1

121,2,0,Full Frame, HD Video, rugged design, clear LCD, included lens is L grade, IS USM.,0,0
121,2,1,People calling 21.1MP a con is inappropriate.,0,0
121,2,2,Again, A) you can downgrade if you want, B) you already know that's what you're buying, C) It's full-frame, why not capture with high mp.,0,0
121,2,3,I had to RMA my first one, the glass was loose after ~100 photos.,1,1
121,2,4,Newegg was not only quick, but courteous, and efficient, 

Calling price a con is inappropriate as well.,1,1
121,2,5,You already know the price, this is the price of the product.,1,1
121,2,6,The included lens is a pro as well as a con.,1,1
121,2,7,Although it makes a nice walk-around lens, with this caliber of camer-body, I'd say Canon should consider variations of included lenses and adjust price accordingly.,1,1
121,2,8,Package it with a Wide Angle, package it with a Macro, and adjust the price correspondingly.,1,1
122,2,0,Great camera, it's easy to understand why this unit has been the must have sidearm for all professional photographers for the last few years.,0,0
122,2,1,The Mark II adds noticeable image quality over the regular 5D.,0,0
122,2,2,I have the old 5D chassis and still use it, and once I have gotten used to the newer unit's LCD display, the old 5D looks small and cramped.,0,0
122,2,3,HD video, but I don't use the feature that much.,0,0
122,2,4,The live view is probably a function that most professionals won't use, but it's fun to play with.,0,0
122,2,5,I feel like it might be negatively affecting the sensor to keep it open that long, especially with my expensive glass.,0,0
122,2,6,mono mic on video mode, but it's actually still pretty good.,1,0
122,2,7,complicated menu to get into live mode, and then from there to shooting live video.,1,1
123,2,0,* Great menu, Canon thought this out well
* Lens that comes with the bundle is phenomenal
* Video is superb, will support 60fps soon
* High ISO settings are ridiculous in a good way.,0,0
123,2,1,Yes, shooting 6400 iso will make grain, about the same amount of grain my 30D has at 1500.,0,0
123,2,2,* Full frame!,0,0
123,2,3,* VERY solid build
* Metal Body,0,0
123,2,4,* Specific video modes aren't straight forward enough.,1,1

124,2,0,Camera showed up on time with everything in the box.,0,0
124,2,1,Works great.,0,0
124,2,2,Not that in to cameras so it was somewhat challenging to use initially but with a bit of reading and help from the camera 'guide' button I've learned how to use a lot of the features and can take some really good pictures.,0,0
124,2,3,Everything was perfect.,1,0
125,2,0,I bought this camera to replace my D700, I required the video in a full frame dslr.,0,0
125,2,1,Everything about this camera is great!,0,0
125,2,2,Amazing ISO and worked perfectly with all of my full frame glass,0,0
125,2,3,The autofocus points are straight from the d7000 series so during low light it is a bit off, other than that none!,1,1
126,2,0,65 point AF, all cross type.,0,0
126,2,1,you can autofocus with a teleconverter down to f8.

20.2MP is good enough for anyone's needs.,0,0
126,2,2,ISO usable up to about 10,000 (depending on your needs.,0,0
126,2,3,just for family gatherings?,0,0
126,2,4,10,000 still looks pretty freaking good, but for paid work id say keep it below 6,400.,0,0
126,2,5,autofocus while recording videos.,0,0
126,2,6,live view autofocus is infinitely faster than my first camera (1100d)

easy to use controls.,0,0
126,2,7,I could go on forever, but these are the points that quickly come to mind.,0,0
126,2,8,completely blown away by this camera.,0,0
126,2,9,no video autofocus while at 1080 60fps,1,0
127,2,0,Forgive my being flippant, but I doubt anyone looking at an $1,800 camera back is going to give any weight to comments from an amateur, or at least shouldn't be :-).,0,0
127,2,1,My experience is aligned with the professional reviewers: particularly strong for sports or nature because of the fast AF system and low-light performance.,0,0
127,2,2,For better or worse it is a full-sized DSLR, so it is bulky and heavy.,0,0
127,2,3,With good lenses you can capture some amazing images.,0,0
127,2,4,Size and weight,1,0
128,2,0,I know it's a good camera,0,0
128,2,1,Got it yesterday and played with the settings for 20 minutes then took the battery out to charge it.,1,1
128,2,2,Battery showed fully charged 3 hrs later so I unplugged it.,1,1
128,2,3,I left the battery on the desk right next to the camera then went to work.,1,1
128,2,4,I come home, pop the battery in, and nothing....it doesn't power on.,1,1
128,2,5,Had my Canon EF 28mm f/1.8 on there when it did work.,1,1
128,2,6,Even tried my Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6,1,1
128,2,7,I don't have another battery to test until my package arrives in 2 days.,1,1
128,2,8,If  it doesn't work, then camera will be RMAd.,1,1
129,2,0,Great - small,0,0
129,2,1,Transmission interference for distances greater than 25 feet.,1,1
129,2,2,Not a clear picture even after focusing,1,1
130,2,0,Takes great pictures.,0,0
130,2,1,The "auto" setting was great for just about all the outdoor photos I took on my vacation to the Colorado Rockies last week.,0,0
130,2,2,I'm still figuring out the rest of the functions, but for essentially using the generic setting right out of the box, I was immensely pleased.,0,0
130,2,3,Battery life seems good.,0,0
130,2,4,I took 200+ photos and it isn't complaining about low battery yet.,0,0
130,2,5,The screen is pretty cool.,0,0
130,2,6,You may not be able to tell from the pics, but the LCD screen folds out and rotates.,0,0
130,2,7,This lets you protect the screen during normal use and also lets you get shots at all kinds of interesting angles (you can fold the screen out so that when you're taking a pic of yourself you can still see it).,0,0
130,2,8,Also, zoom is pretty good, at 6x optical and 1x, 1.5x or 2x digital.,0,0
130,2,9,It does take 4 AA batteries.,1,1
130,2,10,So far this hasn't annoyed me as much as I was afraid it might, since it seemed to have no trouble running as long as I wanted it to on the original 4.

The picture files are kind of huge, though you should expect that out of a 12 megapixel camera (by huge, I mean 2-3 megs on the low end, up to 8-9 on the "superfine" resolution).,1,1
130,2,11,Basically, get a big flash card (I'd recommend 500 meg, at the very least).,1,1
130,2,12,Also, the catch on the battery/memory compartment cover isn't that great.,1,1
130,2,13,When the batteries are installed, it can be a little bit of a chore to get the cover closed.,1,1
131,2,0,Great camera, simple to use and fast fast fast!,0,0
131,2,1,Biggest plus is that it is able to use the big boy SD cards.,0,0
131,2,2,I looked for hours trying to find something online that said it was compatible with the HC-SD.,0,0
131,2,3,I bought the 16GB card and it will hold 3000 shots at the highest quality and res.,0,0
131,2,4,Drop either one down a notch and it will hold 10,000.,0,0
131,2,5,Heavy...,1,1
131,2,6,But I was expecting that from other reviews.,1,1
131,2,7,I use mine underwater mostly so it really isn't an issue for me.,1,1
131,2,8,The battery door is just plain stupid design.,1,1
131,2,9,Not enough for me to not buy it but Canon should do something different in the future.,1,1
131,2,10,It is tricky to close and you need to have a light touch and patience.,1,1
131,2,11,The whole light leak thing is annoying...,1,1
131,2,12,I haven't noticed anything but my camera has the dreaded fith ZERO and I need to do something about it.,1,1
131,2,13,I have glanced at the canon site and it doesn't have the little mark that says it has been fixed.,1,1
131,2,14,Wish someone at Newegg would weed these things out.,1,1
132,2,0,High-ISO capabilities
Face detection is cool.,0,0
132,2,1,SDHC (though I don't have a card yet)
Dolica case and Kingston card bundled for free

Plenty to play with,0,0
133,2,1,Red-eye can be a problem in "Auto" mode.,1,1
134,2,0,Swivel screen, Image Stablization, 12MP!,0,0
134,2,1,I love this camera, the view screen is big, and the swivel is a must have once you get used to having it (I had the A80 and got attached to that feature for unique shots).,0,0
134,2,2,The Image Stabilization is simply amazing, all you need to do is make sure to keep the camera moderately still and you can get great pictures without flash even in medium light.,0,0
134,2,3,There is one problem with it I've discovered.,1,1
134,2,4,There is a certain distance you need to be from your subject for the autofocus to work, and if you're close to the limit the camera will often struggle if you force center focus.,1,1
134,2,5,I'm hoping that a future firmware upgrade will fix this.,1,1
134,2,6,Also, to catch fast moving objects you have to use the "kids and pets" dial setting, which I didn't use for a while because I was not shooting "kids and pets", but once you figure that out then all is well.,1,1
135,2,0,Compared to other camera's in its class, the picture quality stands above them all.,0,0
135,2,1,This is based off my experience with the 10MP model previous to this one.,0,0
135,2,2,I have two issues with this camera.,1,1
135,2,3,AS OTHERS HAVE SAID, the battery door is a horrible design.,1,1
135,2,4,My camera is trash now  it will no longer latch in a manner that gets good connectivity.,1,1
135,2,5,Since it takes AA batteries you have to use this door all the time and once I noticed the an issue with the camera locking up sometimes and not being able to turn on, it wasn't more than a month of limping it along before it wouldn't power up at all.,1,1
135,2,6,The other issue is the video recording leaves something to be desired.,1,1
135,2,7,It seems as if it was just an after thought they threw in to get more sales.,1,1
135,2,8,Its very grainy and jumpy.,1,1
136,2,0,Coming from someone who's last camera was a 2.1mp, This camera is great.,0,0
136,2,1,The quality is almost real.,0,0
136,2,2,Comes with a 32mb flash card when each picture is 4mb?,1,0
136,2,3,Definitely recommend buying an extra with it.,1,0
137,2,0,Good quality pics (jpeg).,0,0
137,2,1,I can't even duplicate the quality of the camera's jpeg pictures using photoshop and raw images with CHDK firmware!,0,0
137,2,2,I'm afraid the battery/memory door will wear out because when shutting/opening it seems to rub really hard against the batteries.,1,1
137,2,3,And both the memory and batteries are accessed thru the same door...,1,1
138,2,0,Takes Great pitures (If you have a Tripod and or a steady hand).,0,0
138,2,1,Has a ton of manual features.,0,0
138,2,2,A large fold out screen.,0,0
138,2,3,It is easy to use and it's not paper thin (Sorry I have big hands).,0,0
138,2,4,It holds 4 batteries, "if you get the Duracell 2700's you will forget about charging this thing and not worry" it takes an 8Gb memory card which I have filled up about 4 times now and still don't need to charge the batteries.,0,0
138,2,5,It shoots great video with excellent sound quality as long as you DON'T USE THE ZOOM.,0,0
138,2,6,And on that note on to the CONS.,0,1
138,2,7,I expected better from $300+ Canon!!!
ZOOM-ZOOM-ZOOM!! Don't even bother with the zoom.,1,1
138,2,8,I have tried 6 ways from sunday to get a clear picture with any amount of zoom.,1,1
138,2,9,This camera is VERY touch when it comes to it's zoom I don't care how you have it set.,1,1
138,2,10,I've read the manual twice went to a couple of blogs and adjusted all of the setting thinking it was something I was going wrong.,1,1
138,2,11,If you use the auto settings and no zoom it takes GREAT pictures!!!,1,1
138,2,12,And I wouldn't exactly call it a point and shoot camera, it's more of point, hold your breath, wait 5 Sec., then shoot.,1,1
138,2,13,If you are going to use any ammount of zoom with this camera unless you are a surgeon, or have a tripod, expect a large ammount of noise in your pictures.,1,1
138,2,14,Also beware of attachment lenses and adapters!!! Don't do it!!!,1,1
138,2,15,If you planning to buy attachments with this camera, just buy an SLR and be done with it.. Bigger learning curve, but alot less head-aches.,1,1
139,2,0,Great camera.,0,0
139,2,1,I had smaller cameras that did not capture the shots I was looking for.,0,0
139,2,2,This one seemed to "get it right"
I also like the video quality,0,0
139,2,3,Avoid digital zoom (But this is true for ALL cameras)  Just use the Optical zoom and you will be fine.,1,1
139,2,4,This model does not recover from water damage well.,1,1
139,2,5,No fault to Canon but other digital cameras have dried out and worked after submersion.,1,1
139,2,6,(I had a kayak mishap and this one was submerged for quite a while before I got the batteries out),1,1
140,2,0,I would not recommend this camera.,1,1
140,2,1,I have been a Canon EOS buyer for over 20 years.,1,1
140,2,2,But this 40D is the worst Canon camera I have ever owned.,1,1
140,2,3,It has been to Canon for repair 3 times and every time they say it is fixed, but it is not.,1,1
140,2,4,I have two professional photographers who have used my camera that agree, this is something wrong with this camera.,1,1
140,2,5,Canon support is useless if you have a problem.,1,1
140,2,6,The will just blow you off until your warranty expires.,1,1
140,2,7,Search the web for 40D soft images and you will see what I am talking about.,1,1
140,2,8,This series of camera has issues.,1,1
140,2,9,And from what I have read, the 50D is not any better.,1,1
140,2,10,Do yourself a favor and buy Nikon or Sony.,1,1
140,2,11,Canon EOS cameras are only good if you can afford the $4000 cameras.,1,1
141,2,0,Bought for my wife (amature photog) to upgrade from her Digital Rebel (7 years old).,0,0
141,2,1,She loves it.,0,0
141,2,2,Only complaint is that it is a lot heavier but that is monor compared to benefits,1,0
142,2,0,The 40D is already legendary for it's amazing features and quality.,0,0
142,2,1,This camera not only offers excelent picture quality and features.,0,0
142,2,2,It also has several ways to customize its menus and selectors for fast and easy switching between shoting modes that ajust to the conditions of the shot.,0,0
142,2,3,If you are a serious amateur fotographer or a semi-pro this is the camera for you.,0,0
142,2,4,Also if you have any EF-S lenses.,0,0
142,2,5,Many profesionals have this camera in their bag because its versatility and speed.,0,0

144,2,1,Camera pooped out after two months (continual error message), but exchanged it for a new one, no issues now.,1,1
145,2,0,All specs that this camera has are all PROs, but if you compare it to lower models XTi XSi 30D there are several things that make it better, how its built, faster fps, faster buffer, bigger screen, LiveMode, very customizable,0,1
145,2,1,accessories for it are not cheap, especially good lens (like L series),1,0
146,2,0,Live view, good resolution, priced well against competition, dust features, 14 bit DA gives better gradiation that previous models, BIG LCD, Quieter shutter.,0,1
146,2,1,No contrast detection AF in live view (to use AF the mirror has to swing down and the LCD goes black during focussing) A bit heavier than the 20 or 30D,  LCD is nice and big, and very clear, but it does not seem that accurate, color seems a bit cool, highlight priority function bumps lowest ISO from 100 to 200 and seems to adversely affect WB.,1,1
146,2,2,Auto WB no where NEAR as accurate as Nikon D300.,1,1
147,2,0,Favorites menu!,0,1
147,2,1,Auto ISO in all modes

Neutered auto ISO range only goes up to 800 ISO.,1,0
147,2,7,I would love if it allowed me to adjust!,1,0
148,2,0,The camera has most of the features found in Canons more advanced models with a bright 3" LCD on the back.,0,0
148,2,1,While it can do a lot at ISO 100 the weaknesses are hard to spot unless you have used it for six months.,0,0
148,2,2,With the Canon EF 100-400L this camera is good enough to photograph wildlife.,0,0
148,2,3,Wide angle lenses will work but don't fill the viewfinder well.,0,0
148,2,4,The auto-focus works for short distances and manual focusing in live-view makes tack-sharp pictures with a remote trigger.,0,1
148,2,5,Av and Tv mode work the best over the full auto.,0,1
148,2,6,The grip feels sturdy and the camera body weighs just enough to carry for several hours without wrist fatigue.,0,0
148,2,7,Hot spots/stuck pixels at high ISOs, poor AI-Servo auto-focusing, takes slightly blurry pictures with super-telephoto lenses, inaccurate auto-focus with Canon's long lenses, dark viewfinder, poor battery life and slow shutter speed in low light.,1,1
148,2,8,If the ISO is over 400 image quality will start to degrade.,1,1
148,2,9,The lack of auto-focus assist points make taking pictures of birds in flight very difficult.,1,1
148,2,10,Auto-focus with Canon 'L' lenses is not spot on and require manual focusing for tack-sharp pictures.,1,1
148,2,11,My biggest gripe is the full auto 'point and shoot' mode disables almost all the menu options in the camera.,1,1
149,2,0,I did not like the item.,0,0
149,2,1,I returned and bought the different items.,0,0
149,2,2,The services, the helpers, the operators and the processes are all excellent.,0,0
150,2,0,The 40D has all the features you'd expect from a professional DSLR.,0,0
150,2,1,Image quality is outstanding and it has a very nice large LCD for viewing shots.,0,0
150,2,2,The camera is also very fast, shooting speed is impressive and is relatively quiet.,0,0
150,2,3,White balance tends to get a little tricky.,1,0
150,2,4,Shots in manual mode tend to look over-exposed when light meter indicates proper lighting.,1,0

152,2,2,It's a Canon !,0,0
152,2,3,This is the 4th 40D body I have owned over the last few months for various reasons.,1,1
152,2,4,The latest and from what I am finding out, quite common is a serious problem with horizontal banding when shooting at high ISO's (Over 400) This is the 2nd body to exhibit this to varying degrees.,1,1
152,2,5,Other than that it's the camera I reach for every time.,1,1
153,2,0,Wonderful (5 eggs) camera for the price if it would work.,0,0
153,2,1,I bought  40d from from newegg.,1,0
153,2,2,It shoots blurry images.,1,1
153,2,3,I'm no amateur, worked as a professional photographer in a  studio (used 5D - for sport photography, 30D in studio, 20D, 350D, 450D).,1,1
153,2,4,I thought it's just me (seeing things), then my friend (also a photographer) told me it too blurry... i made some test with high details (leaves, bar code).,1,1
153,2,5,Blurry.,1,1
153,2,6,It's not a movement problem at all.,1,1
153,2,7,It is a focusing problem.,1,1
153,2,8,Something with the sensor i guess.,1,1
153,2,9,I quickly researched  online, several other people have the same issues.,1,1
153,2,10,Going to send it back to newegg for exchange.,1,1
154,2,0,Simply great pictures!,0,0
154,2,1,This camera offers plenty of flexibility to get the shot you want.,0,0
154,2,2,It offers an auto mode that can give former point-and-shoot owners excellent photos while they learn how to use the "creative mode" settings.,0,0
154,2,3,Other newer DSLR cameras have higher megapixel count, but the raw files will be proportionately larger, and the benefit very small unless you're making posters or doing some significant cropping.,0,0
154,2,4,Plus the latest cameras in this class are all more expensive, so you need to make the judgement for yourself if the added features are worth all the extra cost.,0,0
154,2,5,Newegg's price on this camera is very reasonable (low), and their service is excellent!,0,0
154,2,6,It's pretty big and heavy to lug around, especially with a zoom lens.,1,0
154,2,7,I find it worth the tradeoff.,1,0
155,2,0,Great build quality and picture quality, very fast, easily the best camera I've ever used.,0,0

156,2,5,The camera died with an Error 99 after only a month and a half.,1,1
156,2,6,I had to ship it back to the manufacturer and they don't do RMA.,1,1

157,2,0,Big, heavy, feels professional.,0,0
157,2,1,Great picture quality, lots of options.,0,0
157,2,2,Menus and controls are well placed and easy to reach.,0,0
157,2,3,I specially like the continuous shooting mode, up to 6 frames per second until the buffer is full, in my case is like 13 pictures shooting raw.,0,0
157,2,4,The highest ISO, 3200 is very noisy, almost non usable.,1,0
157,2,5,Although, in order to use it, you have to dig in to the Cfn settings and enable it.,1,1
157,2,6,The screen is hard to see in very bright sun conditions.,1,1
157,2,7,As soon as I order it, Canon announced 50D, with more resolution, longer zoom kit lens, more ISO and better weather seal.,1,1
157,2,8,I read the review (dpreview.com),1,1
157,2,9,and sample pictures look rather noisy, but judge for yourself.,1,1
158,2,0,Easy to use quiet shutter takes amazing photos.,0,0
158,2,1,The lens is great and takes beautiful close ups.,0,0
159,2,0,I can't say enough good about this.,0,0

159,2,2,This camera has worked in every situation I through at it.,0,0
159,2,3,I didn't buy it from NewEgg because they didn't have it yet but NewEgg has never let me down on a purchase.,0,0
159,2,4,This is a great camera for pro photography or entry level.,0,0
159,2,5,It is well constructed and when I compared it to the current pro full frame DSLR's it has come out on top almost every time.,0,0
159,2,6,I love how easily it hooks up to all our studio equipment.,0,0
159,2,7,List of Highlights: Fantastic picture sharpness, fast focus, great low noise at higher ISO, built in focusing system for lenses that don't have it built in, colors ver accurate, lots of options for pro studio shooting and equipment, lots of customization, 2 user settings (I use one for landscapes and one for portraits), RAW + JPEG is nice and can be split between two SD Cards, Fast continuous shooting, easy access to contro,0,0
159,2,8,Not really cons but I felt I should mention: 
Heavy but not a con because I know it has solid construction like the pro cameras which add to the weight and it is well balanced once you through a good lens on it.,1,1
159,2,9,It would be nice to be full frame but that would make it a  different kind of camera and a very different price range.,1,1
160,2,0,*Low-Light improvement

164,2,1,+ modeling flash

164,2,2,Not all that much better than a D3100 or D5000
+ A lot of specification hype / marketing overload
+ shutter release button felt better on the D5K
+ ISO performance claims seem a little over the top,1,0
165,2,0,Lots can be said, and has been elsewhere (dpreview, etc.).,0,1
165,2,1,Bottom line, however is this:

This is the best low light photography currently on the market.,0,1
165,2,2,The camera is capable of clear, usable pictures a ISO 12,000, and even 25,000.,0,1
165,2,3,With the right lens, this basically means taking hand-held, no flash, frame-able pictures in candlelight.,0,1
165,2,4,Beyond that, there is a long list of features to mention.,0,1
165,2,5,It gives everything one would expect from a $1200 DSLR body, but noteworthy are things like:
- dual SD card slots, the 2nd one settable as realtime back-up of 1st, or as expanded space
- HD Video capability with your best SLR glass and autofocus
- 16MP at 6 FPS, 14 Bit RAW files
- HDMI, USB and various AV outputs
- multiple ways to change settings, including dedicated buttons, dual logically used multi-purpose spinners, and a nice INFO screen
- Spectacular color handling, with more wide-ranging and subtle in-camera capabilities than ever before.,0,1
165,2,6,- I'm out of letters - go read othe,0,1
165,2,7,Price/capabilities trade-offs are always tricky, and Nikon has done a good job of focusing on features more than a price point.,1,1
165,2,8,Still, a couple of things could have been done, that weren't
- Still in USB2 mode.,1,1
165,2,9,- no 1-button 100% zoom capability.,1,0
165,2,10,Standard feature on my old D200, but missing here.,1,0

170,2,2,I have a D2X and D200 and a lot of good Nikkor glass.,0,1
170,2,3,I am 6-7 years behind the curve in DLSR bodies, so I am very excited what the Nikon  sensors (not Sony sensors in the D2s and 200s) can do.,0,1
170,2,4,I also have large format printer and print quite often.,0,1
170,2,5,Not shooting for money anymore, so I saved 750 over the D7000.,0,1
170,2,6,I usually go for the motto get it right the first time but that would mean getting the D3 and I do not have $6000 lying around or even 3K for the D300.,0,1
170,2,7,The image capturing is good enough and I have 24" prints to prove it.,0,1
170,2,8,Video is better than any handycam I've used.,0,1
170,2,9,Not good for older lenses, that's my only beef.,1,0
170,2,10,And the manual operation is not that great.,1,0
170,2,11,But my D2 and d200 still works.,1,0
170,2,12,But really, I bought this camera so I can shoot video.,1,0
170,2,13,My wife is happy too.,1,0
170,2,14,Also the color is not as neutral as the other high end models.,1,0
170,2,15,A 55-200 was part of the deal and to be honest that works better for video work any way than the big 2.8 lenses.,1,0
170,2,16,I am sure one can argue about the autofoucs and the exposure database but it is 750 dollars.,1,0
170,2,17,I have not dropped it hard yet but the plastic body may be suspect.,1,0

182,2,3,scene mode is quite useful and works better than auto mode for each scene that i have tried.,0,0
182,2,4,video mode is excellent!,0,0
182,2,5,20fps at 640x480 with good audio recording makes it useful for actually making some home made videos!,0,0

182,2,7,kind of hard to operate with just one hand, especially due to the location of the zoom in/out buttons.,1,0

184,2,3,I've also gotten really good battery life out of it.,0,0
184,2,4,I ordered the red one but it looks more pink than red.,1,0
185,2,0,One of the best cameras I've ever owned some of the learning curve is a bit wonky at first with this thing but otherwise the pictures come out nice and I have to do very little tweaking in photoshop unlike with my old Canon.,0,0

189,2,1,I am learning all the iso, shutter speed, aperture, etc and my photo quality is getting better! it is fun and easy.,0,0
189,2,2,It only comes with the body and lens (and battery, charger, and some cords for connecting to computer..).. you will have to buy the tripod and camera bag separately.,1,1

Extremely high picture quality
Decent kit lens considering you get it for "free"
Excellent battery time
Good value considering the quality of this camera... it's expensive, sure... but that's the price you pay for DSLR,0,0
191,2,1,No real cons I can think of.,1,1
191,2,2,Doesn't have some of the on-camera filter modes and effects that the higher end D5x00 series has, but then again, they are much pricier.,1,1
192,2,0,some what quite focus moter (very important when recording video because the mic will pick that up when recording) great out door camera for taking lanscapes and sporting events.,0,1
192,2,1,horrible in low light, contrasting/ close up shots... thats only because the mega pixels are all jammed togeather leaving the outer edge of your subjuct blurry and misscolored.,1,0
192,2,2,for example if i took a picture of a baseball up close you can see a blurry red ring around the white part.,1,0
193,2,0,Many features and a good manual.,0,0
193,2,1,lcd screen- when reveiwing pictures that don't look good through the lcd screen, never received wifi adapter and don't know who to notify about this.,1,1

194,2,1,Very pleased with service and shipping.,0,0
194,2,2,If you guys are gonna offer freebees such as a camera case you should at least make sure the camera will fit in the case.,1,1
195,2,0,I moved from my p&s to this camera and it was amazing.,0,0
195,2,1,The image quality is great for beginners, but the kit lens wont do for someone looking to become professional.,0,0
195,2,2,The controls are very easy to use and get used to.,0,0
195,2,3,Live view works well for looking at your scene and getting the exposure and aperture set up so you don't take 10 shots of the same thing before you get it right.,0,0
195,2,4,Kit lens is okay, but at full zoom (55mm) there seems to be a little trouble with focusing.,1,0
195,2,5,It's always blurry.,1,1
195,2,6,The lens also does not have a distance meter, making it hard to focus properly sometimes.,1,1
196,2,0,This camera awesome, gives you more control and more creativity.,0,0
196,2,1,Exelent picture quality.,0,0
196,2,2,I have purchased several cameras from New Egg but this one is the best.,0,0

196,2,4,Hard to find Remote control for this camera.,1,0
196,2,5,The KIT DOLICA Bag absolutely not for Canon XSi / XTi, it's so small for this camera, I can't even close Zip.,1,1
197,2,0,I did a lot of research prior to deciding on this camera and I believe it is the best choice in the general sub 1000 dollar price range.,0,0
197,2,1,Don't worry about the "plastic" body--it is actually stainless steel covered with polycarbonate and very sturdy.,0,0
197,2,2,This camera has many of the features of the higher priced Canon models while remaining lighter in weight and less expensive in price.,0,0
197,2,3,The image quality is outstanding.,0,0
197,2,4,I recommend getting a Canon Speedlite to go with it at some point as this increases your shooting options.,0,0
197,2,5,This camera has awesome capabilities but you need to know that there is definitely a learning curve if you are used to point and shoot cameras.,1,1
197,2,6,P&S cameras do a lot of in-camera processing automatically whereas with a DSLR you have to make many of these decisions.,1,1
197,2,7,This gives you more control and more creativity but also more chances to make mistakes.,1,1
197,2,8,I have purchased several books about digital photography, and have just ordered a video tutorial so that I can go beyond the basic modes.,1,1
197,2,9,I have had the camera about a month and have not even begun to understand all of its capabilities.,1,1
197,2,10,I take most pictures in automatic or program mode right now while I learn more about manual mode and the many controls and choices that this camera offers.,1,1
198,2,0,I got into photography last year and wanted to get a DSLR (my point and shoot wasn't cutting it).,0,1
198,2,1,After browsing around, I decided to either get the XTi or the XSi.,0,1

198,2,4,I have yet to try landscaping or macros, but I'm sure I won't be disappointed when I do.,0,1
198,2,5,You'll end up wanting to buy extra, expensive lenses for it.,1,1
199,2,0,A little bit bigger than the XTi for better grip, little bit lighter than the XTi and it came with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens the IS really helps.,0,1
199,2,1,Feels plasticy than the XTi, but I guess thats the trade off for making it lighter.,1,0
200,2,0,Quick auto focus.,0,0
200,2,1,Nice kit lens.,0,0
200,2,2,Easy enough to use in automatic with good results and robust enough to learn more advanced options.,0,0

203,2,1,I've had this camera since early January, and ever since, I haven't stopped taking pictures!,0,0

203,2,3,Only two I can think of is the strap it came with, fairly uncomfortable.,1,0
203,2,4,The other is that the kit lense does not let in much light, but I knew this beforehand.,1,1
203,2,5,I plan on spending a few hundred to upgrade the lens by this summer.,1,1
204,2,0,Very good camera for the price.,0,0

205,2,3,None at this time.,1,0
206,2,0,The camera itself has alot of pros as other people has said.,0,1
206,2,1,The cons however, i have to explain,0,1
206,2,2,Basically ordered this.,1,1
206,2,3,As advertised it was supposed to come with a W/EF-S 18-55mm F/3.5-5.6 IS Lens.,1,1
206,2,4,Ordered from newegg.,1,1
206,2,5,They shipped the camera without the lense.,1,1
206,2,6,Then they claimed it doesn't come with a lens.,1,1
206,2,7,After much hassle was able to get  a refund, and  had to fight for a shipping cost refund considering they shipped me  a product I didn't order.,1,1
206,2,8,I ordered one with a lens and didn't get it.,1,1
207,2,0,When used with good quality glass and in the right hands, this camera can take images of exceptional quality.,0,0
207,2,1,The kit lens included suffers from some of the shortcomings of less expensive lenses; however, is very sharp and functions surprisingly well.,0,0
207,2,2,This camera is light, smaller and very easy to use.,0,0
207,2,3,As expected, the XSi may lack a some features of more expensive DSLRs, but is quite well equipped for an entry level camera of this type.,1,1
207,2,4,It would be nice if the 3" LCD screen were higher resolution.,1,1
208,2,0,I dont think you guys would believe me if i said i got this brand spanking new for 420 bucks... but w/e

great picture quality
12.2mp great for cropping...

208,2,1,I have huge hands... so the grip is kinda funky...,1,0
209,2,0,Bought one of these because my brother-in-law has a similar but slight older model.,0,0
209,2,1,The crisp pictures are great without any of the blur that you get from the typical digital camera.,0,0
209,2,2,Fairly intuitive use with a nice setting for the fullest of automatic picture taking.,0,0
209,2,3,Yet other modes allow the fullest of control..,0,1
209,2,4,Not sure how these features compare to other cameras in this price range, but there is no video taking mode on this camera.,1,1
209,2,5,Also, the 3" screen does only shows settings for the automatic picture taking modes--you'll have to look through the viewfinder to take pictures.,1,1
210,2,0,I got it for a good price and am mostly happy with it.,0,0
210,2,1,One problem I have found is that at extreme zoom shots it gets a little blurry.,1,1
210,2,2,I have this problem only once in a while.,1,1
210,2,3,I also didn't like that I had to download the users manual as it didn't come with one.,1,1
211,2,0,It takes pictures and is at a good price.,0,0
211,2,1,The quality of the pics are pretty good.,0,0
211,2,2,Shutter delay is a little weird but not a problem and also as others have said, the battery door can be a little difficult to open (nothing to grip, you have to slide the button down and somehow pull it back),1,1
212,2,0,Camera is easy to use and takes some amazing pictures.,0,0
212,2,1,Very pleased with our purchase and the fact it came with a free 2gb mem stick is even better.,0,0
213,2,0,Excellent camera.,0,0

214,2,0,Large LCD display, good size, takes good photos,0,0
214,2,1,Deep seated menus, delay between shutter press and when it actually takes the photo,1,1
215,2,0,I LOVE this camera.,0,0
215,2,1,It even makes sound movies.,0,0
215,2,2,The ease of use and quality of the photos and movies is astounding.,0,0
215,2,3,I can't believe that something with these capabilities costs so little.,0,0
215,2,4,My last camera was a Ni_on which cost three times the price and was no where near the camera this one is.,0,0
216,2,0,Wanted the Powershot A470 for Macro close up ability to replace Powershot A540.,0,1
216,2,1,Camera was DOA right out of the box.,1,1
216,2,2,LCD showed Blue Screen or Black/Grey with static.,1,1
216,2,3,Swapped memory, batteries, etc.,1,1
216,2,4,I expected a working camera with Macro capability, what I got was a waste of time and I had to run out and buy a camera locally to replace this item.,1,1
217,2,0,Under $100.00 for this camera, and it is a huge improvement over the 8 year old camera it replaced.,0,0
217,2,1,I don't use it for much other than just random photos, and it is just what i needed.,0,0
218,2,0,Works great and takes very nice pictures.,0,0
218,2,1,The price is very good for a camera like that.,0,0
218,2,2,Batteries seem to last a decent amount so it's not bad at all.,0,0
218,2,3,Sometimes it takes several seconds before you can take another pictures but it's not that big of a deal.,1,1
219,2,0,Newegg delivered on time.,0,0
219,2,1,This thing is another fine manufactured piece of crud.,1,1
219,2,2,I bought this for my wife for Christmas.,1,1
219,2,3,She was very gental, took a couple of photos, then it displayed the dreaded "lens error please restart the camera".,1,1
219,2,4,From there out, it would display that message and shut down.,1,1
219,2,5,I saw only good reviews here, so I thought I better warn people.,1,1
220,2,0,Great little camera with good quality pictures and nice features.,0,0
220,2,1,Quits working if you drop it 6 feet onto a hard floor.,1,1
220,2,2,Don't do that.,1,1
221,2,0,Very clear pictures, smooth video motion, minimal wait between taking pictures, macro mode produces clear close-up pictures, transfer media to computer is fast, recognized by XP and can be used with installing any software.,0,0
221,2,1,This camera was not around when I bought my last digital camera 6 years ago.,1,1
222,2,0,It produces good pictures at 7.1 megapixel.,0,1
222,2,1,All the expected menu options and functionality at this price.,0,0
222,2,2,Come on, are you going to find a cheaper camera with this quality?,0,0
222,2,3,The included memory card is laughable.,1,1
222,2,4,I take sixteen pictures and have to offload them to take more.,1,1
223,2,0,Excellent Prosumer equipment with professional results; long battery-life with quick recharge; lightweight but reasonably rugged; a workhorse; fast shutter speed; huge LCD with live view; Setting menus very easy to read; Produces stunning results.,0,1
223,2,1,Live View shooting is sluggish.,1,1
224,2,0,-First glance: Compact, light weight DSLR.,0,0
224,2,1,The grip is a little small for large hands but feels natural enough after some use.,0,0
224,2,2,-Shooting in manual exposure is a breeze with this camera.,0,0
224,2,3,ISO, aperture, and shutter speed are all within a finger's reach from the grip leaving you other hand free to fiddle with the lens/depth of field preview.,0,0
224,2,4,-9-point AF is really a plus for getting the subject in focus in the frame you want without cropping later.,0,0
224,2,5,-A whole slew of white balance options, customizable contrast, sharpness, color tone, and saturation.,0,0
224,2,6,These are great if you don't have time or the ability to post process.,0,0
224,2,7,-Exposure metering has been accurate for me both in low light and on sunny days.,0,0
224,2,8,(Spot metering options for getting shadowy areas correctly exposed).,0,0
224,2,9,-Exposure bracketing works great for creating HDR lighting photos.,0,0
224,2,10,A good buy if your looking to get into professional photography!!!,0,0
224,2,11,Image stabilization (IS) not built into the body.,1,1
224,2,12,You have to buy IS lenses if you want to enjoy the benefits IS brings.,1,1
224,2,13,AF in live mode is great for still shots.,1,1
224,2,14,However, quick AF flips the mirror which is noisy and takes time.,1,1
224,2,15,Cannon built in a live view focus mode which does not flip the mirror but still manages to seek a lot and sometimes not achieve as good of a focus.,1,1
224,2,16,Live view is not for moving subjects!,1,1
225,2,0,got it in 2 days, took it out of the box, went and bought a Canon 50mm 1.8 and starting shooting away!,0,0
225,2,1,took some pictures w/o knowing anything and they came out great!,0,0
226,2,0,Good IQ with low noise at the low to mid ISOs (100-400).,0,1
226,2,1,Spot metering that was absent on the 400D (it's about time!).,0,1
226,2,2,Lightweight, but body feels solid.,0,1
226,2,3,Very responsive startup, menus, playback, etc.  SD storage, which is nicer than CF as SD cards and readers are ubiquitous, unlike CF.,0,1
226,2,4,And, of course, the Canon lens selection, supporting both EF-S and EF lenses.,0,1
226,2,5,12MP on a APS-C (1.6x crop) sensor causes a few issues.,1,1
226,2,6,First off, high ISO performance is marginal at 800, and ISO 1600 is almost unusable.,1,1
226,2,7,The smaller pixel size also causes lenses to become diffraction limited at f/8.,1,1
226,2,8,Another thing I dislike is that the body isn't weather sealed--you'd need to get the next model up (D40, D50, etc.) with the magnesium alloy body for that.,1,1
226,2,9,The aperture button is in an awkward place if shooting in full manual mode (though if using the battery grip and shooting in portrait mode, it's in a much more convenient position).,1,0
227,2,0,Image Stability, Auto-Focus.,0,0
227,2,1,Good weight, not too heavy, but solid enough to keep the camera from moving.,0,0
227,2,2,Doesn't come with a lens.,1,1
227,2,3,No memory card included.,1,1
227,2,4,The built-in PC connection is very slow, get a card reader.,1,1
227,2,5,It's a small hassle to remocve the card when you want to upload pictures to your PC, but it does it MUCH faster if you do.,1,1
228,2,0,This cammera is great for entry level, the higher frame rate and resolution compaired to the XTi are worth it if you have the extra funds.,0,0
228,2,1,the auto settings are very inteligent if you are intimidated by SLR cammeras but want to take amazing photos.,0,0
228,2,2,but at the same time, if you want an amazing camera but cant afford a 40D this is a great alternative.,0,0
228,2,3,the manual settings are great and easy to adjust on the fly. it has two very handy quasi manual settings, one where you control apature, with auto exposure, and visa versa.,0,0
228,2,4,i find these settings very handy for great control of image quality with out too much time wasted between shots.,0,0
228,2,5,i am most impressed with its ability in low light.,0,0
228,2,6,my point and shoot is also 1600 ISO, but it can not even compair to what this camera can do in low light.,0,0
228,2,7,night shots of the city are beautiful and clean.,0,0
228,2,8,battery life is amazing, and charger works very quickly.,0,0
228,2,9,i am somewhat disapointed with the white balance settings on the camera, i find images dont always translate to true color under certain lighting conditions.,1,1
228,2,10,this isnt a huge problem with raw format its very easy to adjust color in PS,1,1
229,2,0,Good picture if in bright light.,0,1
229,2,1,Wireless range is as described.,0,1
229,2,2,Cannot use in low level lighting.,1,1
229,2,3,We have had trouble stabilizing the picture.,1,1
229,2,4,Every few seconds gives a burst of "static",1,1
230,2,0,Well...it looks kind of neat...at least that's something.,0,1
230,2,1,I have the cheap-o wired Swann camera (SW211) and I like everything about the wired model better.,1,1
230,2,2,Cheap feel, low build quality, plastic camera housing, SEVERE 2.4ghz router interference, terrible range, terrible on-screen interference.,1,1
230,2,3,If you walk between the camera and receiver, the screen 'jumps'.,1,1
230,2,4,Horrible low light performance.,1,1
230,2,5,There's not a battery adapter (the wired model has one) so placing it in a truly 'remote' location isn't really a viable option.,1,1
230,2,6,Also, the swivel mount is so loose that the weight of the camera itself is too much for it to stay in a given position for very long at a time.,1,1
230,2,7,I would suggest recommending this camera only to someone you truly dislike.,1,1
231,2,0,Entire system is compact.,0,0
231,2,1,Controls are clear and easy to use on the base station.,0,0
231,2,2,Image quality is good (as compared to other very small detectors).,0,0
231,2,3,User replacable base station antenna (clockwise thread, standard pitch),0,0
231,2,4,Antenna on back of camera is flexible but not positionable and small (roughly like a large rubber coated pine tree needle).,1,1
231,2,5,Dip switches for setting transmit frequency are built into the power connector cable hard-wired to the camera.,1,1
231,2,6,(Included manual referenced different hardware version of the same part number, online documentation had the correct info)

287,2,1,Canon does have good glass.,0,1
287,2,2,Major plus is the silent, functional, zoom when doing video.,0,1
287,2,3,Stereo mics work well and , I believe, zooms with the lens at least in some of the action videos I've shot it seems as if they have.,0,1
287,2,4,I have video taken from across the lake, at three quarter full zoom, of some friends Ice surfing and the mikes pickup the sounds of the skates very well and it's between 1/8th and a 1/4 mile away.,0,1
287,2,5,Shot without a tripod and the image stabilization worked incredibly well.,0,1
287,2,6,Camera has a hot shoe (rare) and with a good flash it should take flash pictures much quicker than with the built in flash.,0,1

288,2,9,* Every camera with a compact sensor has issues with dynamic range.,1,1
288,2,10,I'm not docking an egg for this because it's expected in this class of camera, but just pointing it out.,1,1
288,2,11,You won't get SLR performance from this.,1,1
288,2,12,* The lens cap doesn't attach very well and has no cord to attach it to the camera, so it would be easy to lose.,1,1
288,2,13,* No RAW mode, but you can add that yourself with the open source CHDK firmware expansion (google it...),1,1

Shots in low light are tricky,1,0
292,2,0,Ease of Operation, Canon technical support, numerous features,0,1
292,2,1,The camera accompanied by an instructional DVD would shave days and weeks off of the learning curve,1,0
293,2,0,Nice Camera!,0,0
293,2,1,does a great job.,0,0
293,2,2,I wanted a bit better version of that camera so I bought the T6i.,0,0
293,2,3,I wasn't disappointed!,0,0
293,2,4,It too takes excellent pixs,0,0
293,2,5,One needs to "tweak" this camera and get the settings just right.,1,1
293,2,6,The auto focus puts you right on the intended shot but it does leave the peripheral area a bit fuzzy even though its on the same plain and distance.,1,1
294,2,0,Great camera, fast to turn on fast to shoot, I can get 2-3 days off of one charge if I turn off the camera when not in use.,0,0
294,2,1,Canon makes great cameras.,0,0
294,2,2,the double on position on the camera has always confused me, would like a locking position for the buttons on the back while im on patrol i find my plate carrier hitting the buttons on the back, once without me knowing i took an entire patrol in black and white, needless to say that was ruined.,1,1
295,2,0,I've owned this camera for over a year now, and like all those that came before it, the 50D is an impressive machine.,0,0
295,2,1,It finally gives the photographer a good reason to make the jump from the 20/30/40D line.,0,0
295,2,2,Canon took the XXD line out of the dark ages with this model.,0,0
295,2,3,Features like LiveView seems comical on DSLR, but it is very handy if handed to an amateur or grabbing a shot where you cannot look into the view finder.,0,0
295,2,4,The weather sealing is pretty nice.,0,0
295,2,5,Shooting in rain and snow, the 50D didn't experience any issues.,0,0
295,2,6,The CMOS sensor has a serious pixel density issue.,1,1
295,2,7,Canon made a mistake trying to pack 15.1MP into such a small sensor, therefore many of the pictures come out very noisy.,1,1
295,2,8,Moving from an XTi to a 50D (with the same lenses) has nearly eliminated my ability to take long-exposure night shots without experiencing significant amounts of noise.,1,1
295,2,9,The noise removing features on the camera only go so far and requires 1 second of correction for every 1 second the shutter was open.,1,1
295,2,10,(30 sec exposure takes 30 sec to remove some of noise.),1,1
295,2,11,Utilizing L lenses has not corrected this issue either.,1,1
295,2,12,The noise problem alone has made me regret the purchase.,1,1
295,2,13,Read up on DPReview for more info on this problem.,1,1

298,2,1,i paired these with 50mm f1.8 + canon 17-85mm IS USM + tokina 10-17mm fisheye.. amazing.. 

i sold my XSI and got the 50d, and i'm glad i upgraded.,0,0
298,2,2,it has much more features than XSI, and def, performance is much better.,0,0

301,2,2,The viewfinder is TINY!!!! T I N Y!!!,1,1
301,2,3,I have a 5d and an a 3 and a 1v, and this viewscreen is too tiny to manually focus by!,1,1
301,2,4,I'm an experienced pro photographer and I can't be sure of my own focus without switching to live view mode and confirming I have the subject in focus.,1,1
301,2,5,It works fine if you shoot it on autofocus mode or if you use a consumer lens with a huge depth of field f/4+, but if you are using the prime series lenses like the 35/1.4,,1,1
301,2,6,50/1.4,,1,1
301,2,7,or 100/2 you will not be able to see clearly enough to manually focus!!!,1,1
301,2,8,This camera is not one you want to depend on when trying to get wedding shots in a dark reception hall!,1,1
301,2,9,Superb picture quality, but severely hampered if you plan on doing any manual focus at all.,1,1
302,2,0,even with my limited camera experiance, this thing rocks! the controles are quick to learn, and the automatic settings work great.,0,0
302,2,1,The creative settings are amazing when you figure out the shot you want.,0,0
302,2,2,If I had formal photography training my shots would be better, but I'm learning.,0,0

303,2,1,We price checked several other sites and stores and could not get half the stuff this package comes with for the price.,0,0
303,2,2,great deal and quick shipping,0,0
304,2,0,I always preferred canon cameras over all other brands and miss my Canon AE1  Program but don't miss the expense of film cameras for sure, this one has all the features and then some for what I use it for which is mostly scenic on trips across this great country, plan to take plenty of pictures on our 3 weeks vacation in a couple weeks and will see Yellowstone YIPPIE, I miss the mountains.,0,0
304,2,1,Put a 32GB card in this and at highest resolution that gives over 5,000 pictures so that is good deal I do not need at highest so will kick it back a notch and have more pictures, The video portion is simple enough to use  as is the rest of the features of this camera once you get used to it.,0,0
304,2,2,Nice wide carry strap that doesn't dig into your neck and it is lighter than my old Canon camera and don't have to keep changing film, flash auto pops up if needed for darker indoor shots it flashes a couple times to be sure it gets focus right then takes shot PERFECTION I love it,0,0
304,2,3,the price is still too high on DSLR cameras but that is something we have to deal with for now,1,1
305,2,0,Great for beginers,  As this is my first DSLR i love this camera.,0,0
305,2,1,I use to use a Canon Powershot a590 IS, So Upgrading to this was easy.,0,0

308,2,0,This is my first DSLR canon and I have had it now about a year.,0,0
308,2,1,I am very happy with the quality so you can't go wrong there.,0,0
308,2,2,Although this camera is only 12.2 mp it's still enough for what I want to do now and the price was great.,0,0
308,2,3,I like the lens that came with it (18-55 mm) and now want to add the 55-250 IS telephoto.,0,0
308,2,4,My shots are mainly nature oriented but I have taken some indoor pics as well and they came out great too.,0,0
308,2,5,You can do alot with this camera as there are alot of different settings to work with and the built-in flash works well also.,0,0
308,2,6,I have to say you can't go wrong shopping with Newegg because I always get very good service from this company and most of the time their sale prices with free shipping cannot be matched locally!,0,0
308,2,7,I would definitely recommend this camera to someone who is just starting out with DSLR.,0,0
308,2,8,Just love it...,0,0
308,2,9,Only one con and that's I wish Canon would "always" include the 3  filter lenses so you wouldn't have to go and buy them separately- as this is an important accessory for the camera.,1,1
309,2,0,Awesome quality, that the videos even lag out my 7 year old tower :3
Guess it's time for an upgrade.,0,0
309,2,1,not really a con, but for those looking to take moon shots,
you'll need to get a tripod, and a IS lens of at least 250mm, to see any decent craters or pop marks on the surface :),1,1
310,2,0,Great sharp pictures.,0,0
310,2,1,Fast shutter speed.,0,0
310,2,2,Kinda bulky and heavy.,1,1

311,2,1,Also works with a ton of lenses I tried,0,0
311,2,2,Wouldn't mind a faster shooting rate.,1,1
311,2,3,1080p video shouldn't just be a T3i feature,1,1
312,2,0,-Inexpensive 
-Auto Detect feature
-3 HDMI inputs
-Remote control included,0,0
312,2,1,Only con I can think of is that there is an optional power supply but does not include an power adapter.,1,1

313,2,5,Easy to navigate after you use it for afew minutes.,0,0
313,2,6,If it 'worked as it should' it would be a 5 egg product, keep that in mind, This is a great camera if you get one that works all the way.,0,0
313,2,7,As Always, Newegg Shipping was awesome and fast.,0,0
313,2,8,Power Button Is Hard To Hit At Times, especially for women with nails.,1,1
313,2,9,One VERY IRRITATING ISSUE is that when we plug the camera into the computer the camera shuts off making it impossible to transfer, I unplug it from the computer and it turns back on, plug it in and it shuts off.,1,1
313,2,10,In my mind this means the camera's broken, it worked at first, we were able to transfer about a dozen pictures, and works perfectly at all times except now when we plug it into USB it shuts off.,1,1
313,2,11,When it is plugged into usb and we try to start it, it just cycles its startup screen, never fully powering on while connected to PC.. I'm very disappointed that Kodak would produce a camera with Problems like this.,1,1
313,2,12,I will post a 2nd review if I find a way to resolve this problem, without this issue this Camera is a 4-5 egg Camera.,1,1
314,2,0,The camera is red and cool looking and the shipping was free.,0,0
314,2,1,Never been so dissappointed with a product.,1,1
314,2,2,I would have thought that being a 14megapixel camera, that the pics would be sharp, clear, and awesome.,1,1
314,2,3,I should have researched more before buying this camera.,1,1
314,2,4,Looking at other online reviews with google, i realize that I messed up when i ordered this camera.,1,1
314,2,5,The pics are NOT sharp, and there seems to be a spots on the pics.,1,1
314,2,6,I assumed that the lense must be dirty, but after wiping lenses with soft cloth, I am still getting little circles showing up on the pics.,1,1
314,2,7,The camera interface and the buttons on the camera are less than desirable, very cumbersome, and awkward.,1,1
314,2,8,Next time I'm going with a sony or Cannon.,1,1
314,2,9,Please dont waste your money on this camera, as you would be better off getting a cheap no name camera.,1,1

317,2,1,Mediocre for indoor flash, indoor photos are grainy.,1,1
317,2,2,Noise visible in shadows in all but ASA 100.,1,1
317,2,3,The Vibration Reduction is not true optical image stabilization, but it applies postprocessing to the image to remove blur along the direction of motion that was sensed in the camera.,1,1
318,2,0,Fairly nice bundle but the case isn't that great.,0,0
318,2,1,Very poor picture quality.,1,1
318,2,2,6 meg shots are compressed down to around 1.7 megs.,1,1

319,2,1,Good size and simplicity for a 'point & shoot' camera.,0,0
319,2,2,Lots: very poor picture quality - could not match my 6mp Kodak - costing $74, bought 2 years ago.,1,1
319,2,3,12mp shots are uniformly fuzzy; 6 mp are somewhat better but still far below the quality of my older camera.,1,1
319,2,4,Settings are okay, on-line manual is strictly for info only with no help in debugging problems.,1,1

320,2,1,I shoot a lot of pictures.,0,0
320,2,2,I require my camera to:

320,2,3,Its very fast - can shoot picture after picture - no waiting time.,0,0

321,2,3,After having this a month and fiddling with the owners manual and every color option I got the color for still images somewhat manageable.,1,1
321,2,4,The Autofocus is another story for still images.,1,1
321,2,5,It will attempt to autofocus and get everything sharp looking, but 1 second before snapping picture it blurs slightly then snaps the photo(even on a tripod).,1,1
321,2,6,I tried everything and the only thing left for me is to read the owners manual and see if I can resort to manual focusing and never use auto again.,1,1
321,2,7,The HD video in this camera seems to work fine.,1,1
321,2,8,If I had to do this again I wouldn't buy this camera.,1,1
321,2,9,Battery Life is a dismal if shooting continuous HD VIDEO.,1,1
321,2,10,You'll get about 20mins max on fresh batteries.,1,1
322,2,0,Lots of functions,0,0
322,2,1,Terrible pictures.,1,1
322,2,2,1) color is off, many pictures have a bad color shift, many are washed out
2) fuzzy, far too many pictures come out blurred and fuzzy
3) drains batteries, might work for an hour then needs new batteries, try to record motion and it indicates batteries are too low, even with new batteries

Getting a good picture out of this camera is a struggle,1,1
323,2,0,1.) A CMOS imaging chip.,0,1

323,2,17,If it warns you that you should be using a flash and you don't wish to, than the camera will recalculate the image settings by slowing the shutter speed, raising the ISO to get you a grainy image but that control is left up to you.,0,1
323,2,18,Alkaline batteries ARE a con.,1,1
323,2,19,NIHM batteries work great with this camera.,1,1

324,2,4,1.) A CMOS imaging chip.,0,0
324,2,5,Always considered to be step up from the much more prevalent and less expensive CCD sensors.,0,0
324,2,6,2.) 16 MB max image data size (4608 x 3456 pixels, that's a lot).,0,0
324,2,7,3.) 14x Zoom lens with a wide angle start.,0,0
324,2,8,This is such a big deal to me to have built in wide angle zoom lens, this one starting at a very nice 25mm.,0,0
324,2,9,This is what most small point and shoots can't deliver.,0,0
324,2,10,The wide angle start.,0,0
324,2,11,Also, the built in Macro setting of this lens delivers outstanding close up images.,0,0
324,2,12,The world is breathtaking from 1/2 an inch away.,0,0
324,2,13,4.) USB 3 interface.,0,0
324,2,14,Excellent for moving those 1080P videos.,0,0
324,2,15,5.) 1080P recording!,0,0
324,2,16,Even this cameras bigger brother (the Coolpix L810) is only 720P.,0,0
324,2,17,6.) AA batteries.,0,0
324,2,18,Able to pick up a pair anywhere and keep going (but there is a real downside to this.,0,0
324,2,19,See Cons).,0,0
324,2,20,7.) The flash will not (can not) pop up on its own.,0,1
324,2,21,If it warns you that you should be using a flash and you don't wish to, than the camera will recalculate the image settings by slowing the shutter speed, raising the ISO to get you a grainy image but that control is left up to you.,0,1
324,2,22,8.) HDMI output.,0,1
324,2,23,The movie quality is excellent when shown on a large screen HDTV.,0,1
324,2,24,No shutter or f stop based manual settings.,1,1
324,2,25,One must choose from one of the scene modes but this is okay for me.,1,1
324,2,26,Once you realize each scenes built in settings you can still choose to use a scene that has more relevant shutter and f stop settings for the image you really want.,1,1
324,2,27,For example the Fireworks scene hold the lens wide open and slows the shutter speed but that setting could be used in the daytime for a specific effect.,1,1
324,2,28,The AA batteries are convenient but this camera sucks the power from standard alkaline batteries rapidly.,1,1
324,2,29,So the convenience of AA batteries is both good and bad.,1,1
324,2,30,I have to get a better NI-cad charger to realistically power this camera.,1,1
324,2,31,Rechargeable lithium would of course be the best batteries (and the most expensive).,1,1
324,2,32,No uncompressed jpg and no RAW settings for file saving.,1,1
324,2,33,When you have a CMOS imager that's 16 Meg you would prefer to save that file as near to virgin as possible.,1,1
324,2,34,No SD/XD card shipped with teh camera so I got this from Newegg SanDisk Extreme 32 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 45MB/s.,1,1
324,2,35,It's fast and very high capacity and a camera like this needs something like this or equivalent card.,1,1
324,2,36,They're not expensive.,1,1
325,2,0,1) Very nice display.,0,0
325,2,1,2) Aesthetically appealing.,0,0
325,2,2,3) Small for a telephoto with good optical zoom.,0,0
325,2,3,4) Flash features are rich for a snap-shot.,0,0
325,2,4,5) easy to hold on to.,0,0
325,2,5,6) Good resolution and video feature works well.,0,0
325,2,6,7) Plenty of scene operation modes for a novice to get the picture they want in most situations.,0,1
325,2,7,I needed to shoot through a patio screen and it kept AF'n to the screen putting my subject out of focus.,1,1
325,2,8,I was able to play with the scene filters to try and eliminate the AF issue but still would end up with a somewhat blurred photo.,1,1
325,2,9,If I could have turned off the AF easily I could of taken a good picture, however I didn't see a work around.,1,1
325,2,10,Now this is not uncommon with snap-shots and I'm use to using a professional SLR/DSLR camera.,1,1
325,2,11,Also  when in full telephoto mode I also had fuzzy pictures.,1,1
326,2,0,I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift.,0,0
326,2,1,She loves it.,0,0
326,2,2,Nikon quality says it all!,0,0
326,2,3,Sharp clear photos, even in low light or bright light environments.,0,0
326,2,4,This makes my sixth Nikon purchase.,0,0
327,2,0,Perfect for everything I do.,0,0
327,2,1,Tinker with a couple of settings and you can get awesome colors from normally boring subjects.,0,0
327,2,2,This particular lens is also great for the price.,0,0
327,2,3,18-135mm is often more than enough wide angle and zoom.,0,0
327,2,4,Go for an 18-200mmVR if you can afford it, but this makes a great solution for a do-all lens if you can't.,0,0
327,2,5,I would recommend this camera to anyone.,0,0
327,2,6,I use it almost daily, and it has given me excellent results.,0,0
327,2,7,I use it along with the lens included here, a 70-300mmVR, and a 50mm f/1.8.,0,0
327,2,8,I would also recommend these lenses to anyone interested in expanding their range without spending your life savings.,0,0
327,2,9,Often overexposes, but this can be corrected with a -.3 or -.7 exposure compensation.,1,0
327,2,10,Might need more in low light, but that's your call.,1,1
327,2,11,Also, the lens vignettes a little (has darker corners), but it's not really noticeable unless you're shooting the sky or a blank wall.,1,1
328,2,0,This camera is simply amazing.,0,0
328,2,1,I've been using this for my graphic design business taking my own stock photos, as well as photos for clients, merchandise, people, landscapes, and more.,0,0

328,2,7,Detail is crisp and clean.,0,0
328,2,8,18-135mm Kit Lens is excellent.,0,0
328,2,9,LCD is 2.5" very nice!,0,0
328,2,10,When croping pictures, the 10.2 MP is short of amazing.,0,0
328,2,11,3 pics/second burst shooting.,0,0
329,2,0,Camera's quality and ease of use is a 10, ability to control everything you need is superb as well as the lense included is amazing.,0,1
329,2,1,You will not be disappointed.,0,1
329,2,2,None at this time...  Of course we always wish it costs less but you do get what you pay for...,1,1
330,2,0,A decent value IF you never require servicing on this camera.,0,0
330,2,1,Good picture quality and easy to use.,0,0
330,2,2,It is a Gray markey body, meaning the appropriate tarriffs or taxes have not been accounted for and therefore Nikon USA will NOT touch it if service is required.,1,1
331,2,0,Great camera - wonderful package!,0,0
331,2,1,The accessories were well thought out and worked well with the camera.,0,0
331,2,2,Flaw in camera body - resolved quickly by Marketplace dealer - EC Dealz.,1,0
332,2,0,Camera takes great pictures will still need several months to explore all the features though,0,0
332,2,1,So far not finding to many cons when i transfer the photos i get 2 files per 1 in my chosen format and one in Nikon's format for their software... not really a con though,1,1
333,2,0,Took to an event in the bright hot sun over the weekend.,0,1
333,2,1,Photo quality/clarity was superb.,0,1
333,2,2,A lot of buttons to understand.,0,1
333,2,3,I wish it came with a more complete owners guide.,0,1
333,2,4,I've looked up settings and advice online and fumbled some.,0,1
333,2,5,Still not sure what the best settings are but I'm so very pleased with the clear crisp photos and the fps.,0,1
333,2,6,Super fast shipping with every item displayed.,0,1
333,2,7,Weight takes some getting use to and a "DSLR for Dummies" guide would help.,1,0
334,2,0,I love this camera.,0,0
334,2,1,Great entry level camera for any photographer looking for a great DSLR.,0,0
334,2,2,I did not buy mine here, but own the same camera.,0,0
334,2,3,Came with 18-55 and 55-200 Nikkor lens.,0,0
334,2,4,MF/AF are on both the lenses.,0,0
334,2,5,Enjoy the manual modes on camera.,0,0
334,2,6,Shutter speed up to 1/4000 of a second is good for shooting in extremely sunny conditions, and has a long exposure for those dark shots too.,0,0
334,2,7,Only that I do not fully understand all its uses yet,1,0
335,2,0,The body is awesome.,0,0
335,2,1,Really simple, intuitive interface.,0,0

335,2,3,Photos are crisp and the color is rich.,0,0
335,2,4,The lens is excellent for a consumer grade lens.,0,0
335,2,5,You really can't get a better bang for the buck.,0,0
335,2,6,The body feels like it was meant to be held, you're not holding the camera as much as it is an extension of your hand.,0,0
335,2,7,There's no contorting to get to commonly used controls.,0,0
335,2,8,There is no auto-focus motor on the body, therefore the camera cannot auto-focus if you aren't using a lens with an integrated motor such as the Nikon AF-I or AF-S lens.,1,1
335,2,9,This isn't really a problem since they're really nice lenses, and with Nikon's VR (vibration reduction) technology, there's really nothing to dislike about them.,1,1
336,2,0,This is great camera!,0,0
336,2,1,Very compact, and picture quality is perfect!,0,0

337,2,5,Great entry point DSLR.,0,0
337,2,6,HCSD is extremely important on a camera > 6 MP.,0,0
338,2,0,Crystal Clear pictures.,0,1
338,2,1,From the first picture you will wonder how you lived without it.,0,1
338,2,2,Steep learning curve for all the features even if you shot 35mm film with a good camera.,1,0
339,2,0,This is by far the best camera I have ever owned, it was preeceded by two SLR film cameras from Pentax over a 30 year period.,0,0
339,2,1,I have lots to learn.,0,0
339,2,2,It didn't come with a Telophoto Lens at this price.,1,1

340,2,1,as usual newegg's hipping and packaging is tops.,0,0
340,2,2,i'd recommend this camera for any one looking for a really nice entry level digital slr  or for those like me who use the 35mm slr camera and wanted to go digital and needed one that can also use thier existing lenses as  any lens can be pricey,0,0
341,2,0,Light yet robust construction, a superb kit overall.,0,0
341,2,1,Auto modes are quite adequate, even on horrible light conditions.,0,0
342,2,0,This camera is amazing.,0,0
342,2,1,As a photography amateur, I really like the features.,0,0
342,2,2,The body is light and features easy to use.,0,0
342,2,3,My lens is canon EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM, thus heavier than the body but no big deal.,0,0
342,2,4,If you are looking for a small and good SLR, this camera is for you.,0,0
343,2,0,Sensor allows for video autofocus
very small, lightweight
durable
all current, standard Rebel line-up features
Touchscreen
High ISO range,0,1
343,2,1,This camera is a crop sensor like all the other rebels.,1,0
343,2,2,Know the difference between 1.6x crop sensors and full frame sensors before you buy a DSLR, as it has an effect on focal length when buying lenses.,1,0
343,2,3,This also has a somewhat different layout of buttons, it takes a little bit of work to get used to if you use lots of different cameras
Weight is so light shots can sometimes be shaky,1,0
344,2,0,Very fast to start, very fast on shutter release.,0,0
344,2,1,Metering and auto focus is spot on and works like a champ.,0,0
344,2,2,Overall, this camera just works.,0,0
344,2,3,For the beginner to advanced, it has all the features one could need to take stunning photographs.,0,0
344,2,4,Well, other than any sort of artistic flair to bestow on the user.,0,1
344,2,5,The only real con I have is that certain Nikon compatible AF lenses don't allow auto focus or auto metering.,1,1
344,2,6,I own two older Quantarray AF Nikor lenses that I thought should work with the AF and meter systems, but neither do.,1,1
344,2,7,Basically, if you have a collection of older Nikor AF lenses, I suggest testing them before you buy this camera.,1,1
344,2,8,Honestly though, if you buy this camera you need to get the Nikor VR lenses, they are more than worth the money.,1,1
344,2,9,All Nikor F mount lenses will work manually with this camera.,1,1
345,2,0,Very fast to start, very fast on shutter release.,0,0
345,2,1,Metering and auto focus is spot on and works like a champ.,0,0

346,2,1,Compact, good for broad daylight pictures.,0,0
346,2,2,Nothing great, very mediocre performance,0,0
346,2,3,- Picture quality is poor -in terms of color, sharpness and light
- Very long shutter lag - almost a second.,1,1
346,2,4,- Lots of out of focus pictures
- You will end up waiting for the flas to charge,1,1
347,2,0,Compact, lightweight, works with SDHC cards, connects easily with Vista Home and my WinXP laptop...takes decent video as long as you are in good light.,0,0
347,2,1,Connects easily to my Plasma screen for incredible slideshow.,0,0
347,2,2,Well worth the small bills for this one.,0,0
347,2,3,I do not use their software, so I cannot comment on that.,1,1
347,2,4,Could use a protective case.,1,1
348,2,0,Alot of great features and superb picture quality.,0,1
348,2,1,This 7.1 MP camera takes pictures that look better than those of some 8 amd 9 MP cameras.,0,1
348,2,2,Nikon is bar none the best digital camera maker out there today and this camera is proof of that, all the options, all the features and all the bells and whistles you would expect from a far more expensive camera.,0,1
348,2,3,High quality, low price would more could you ask for?,0,1
348,2,4,It could use a bit more zoom, although 4x digital is adequate at this price point, you could always use more zoom.,1,0
349,2,0,Price.,0,0
349,2,1,Very poor image quality.,1,1
349,2,2,I thought the Nikon name was enough but this camera doesn't live up to the Nikon name.,1,1
350,2,0,My wife is a professional photographer and I'm a semi-pro (definition: pro = my wife makes her living as a photographer, semi-pro = I work part-time as a photographer).,0,1
350,2,1,We go into the camera department of a big box store with the intention of purchasing a Canon 40D.,0,1
350,2,2,We see the Nikon D300.,0,1
350,2,3,After 90 minutes of playing with both cameras side by side, the Nikon is clearly our favorite with a more intuitive control and feel.,0,1
350,2,4,Nothing quantitative here, the Nikon camera just felt right.,0,1
350,2,5,Unfortunately for the big box store, they had sold out of this camera, 2-3 week wait for backordering.,0,1
350,2,6,Newegg had the camera in stock.,0,1
350,2,7,And we saved over $300 going with Newegg.,0,1
350,2,8,Nikon professional tech support is useless.,1,0
350,2,9,We had been Nikon professional photographers for 15 years with our F5 film cameras.,1,0
350,2,10,Had all Nikon lenses and accessories (maybe $20K worth).,1,0
350,2,11,We had asked Nikon tech support some very specific pre-sale questions on their digital cameras - they were jerks.,1,0
350,2,12,We had asked Canon tech support the same question and they were awesome - knowledgeable, friendly, and impressive.,1,0
350,2,13,We were so angry with Nikon that we had agreed between us to sell all of our Nikon equipment and buy Canon if we liked the Canon cameras.,1,1
350,2,14,We did like the Canon 40D very much (nothing bad to say).,1,1
350,2,15,We just were blown away by the Nikon D300.,1,1
350,2,16,You really need to actually hold the high end cameras in your hands before ringing up the cash register.,1,0
350,2,17,Holding the two cameras side by side changed our minds - it might change your mind too.,1,0
350,2,18,Camera touch and feel is a very personal decision - you can't learn about this by just internet shopping.,1,0
351,2,0,Like the previous review, enough raves about this camera elsewhere.,0,1
351,2,1,Could have saved maybe 20-30 bucks buying elsewhere but I know and trust NewEgg.,0,1
351,2,2,If anything goes wrong with a product, their policies are fair.,0,1
351,2,3,BTW, NewEgg, you have it backwards: "Once you know, you NewEgg".,0,1
351,2,4,As usual prompt shipment and fast delivery.,0,1
351,2,5,The battery lasts a long time.,0,1
351,2,6,The sofware package is complete allowing USB tranfer to PC, previewing a folder's pics and Capture NX to make digital lightroom adjustments.,0,1
351,2,7,Not really a con but if you are moving up from a simple digital camera to this low end pro camera there is a steep learning curve.,1,0
351,2,8,I have had it a month and only scratched the surface.,1,0
351,2,9,It's like moving from a simple small car to the space shuttle.,1,0
351,2,10,There are more user settings than I ever thought were possible.,1,0
351,2,11,If the camera is held with lens straight up/down there is some 'zoom creep' in the 35-200 range.,1,0
351,2,12,Per Nikon that is normal and unavoidable.,1,0
352,2,0,Kind of silly to be reading reviews for this thing here when their are dozens of camera sites that rave about this beast of a camera.,0,1
352,2,1,If you try and take picture of yourself the flash can blind you temporarily.,1,1
353,2,0,Superb resolution; very 'crisp' prints; brilliant colors even on the normal settings; dust reduction; built like a Mac truck; HUGE LCD screen; ISO as high as 6400; Live View modes; Active D-Lighting; Nikon Creative Lighting; this list goes on and on...,0,1
353,2,1,No full frame; it is very expensive jumping from the Amateur DSLR class to professional.,1,0
353,2,2,Don't stop with the D300; go after a few more higher end lenses too...you can't go wrong...only broke.,1,0
354,2,0,It's not amazing how far this body has come.,0,0
354,2,1,The pixel's are of finer detail than any Canon and it blazing 11 fps in DX crop mode is unmatched.,0,0
354,2,2,I can't believe that someone would put this in "P" or program mode though.,0,0
354,2,3,You are the boss and with the amazing onboard options, just give yourself a chance to use this.,0,0
354,2,4,Anyone who complains about that this should be 21 mexapixels should stop and think?,0,0
354,2,5,First there are softwares like photoshop and Alien "Blow up" to name just 2 and other interpolation software that can easily resize your "12mp" picture into billboard graphics!,0,0
354,2,6,I rather have this amazing 12mp that a "lessor"21mp camera.,0,0
354,2,7,Remerber pixels are not equal and this camera's as with the D2x's are not only in my opinion superior that the competitions.,0,0
355,2,0,Photo color is excellent, noise level is low, very high ISO settings for action shots at basketball games, matrix metering and subject area recognition the best I've ever seen.,0,0
355,2,1,12.1 megapixels; should've been 21.,1,1
356,2,0,Takes very nice pictures right out of the box.,0,0
356,2,1,Has the auto-focus motor the D60 and lower lack.,0,0
356,2,2,Nice weight and size.,0,0
356,2,3,None that can't be changed in the menu.,1,1
357,2,0,This camera takes a really nice clear picture right out of the box.Im a novice and its really simple to use,Its just the right size too.Some of the higher priced cameras are way too big.,0,0
357,2,1,My package musta been opened b4 I got it.Id hate to send it back ,and it seems to be working fine so Ill stick with it.Also,1,1
357,2,2,It was unable to add inches to my manhood,but this I will have to deal with!,1,1
358,2,0,Great camera.,0,0
358,2,1,I just wanted to get something fairly cheap that took good pictures, and this far exceeded my expectations.,0,0
358,2,2,The movie mode does not record sound,1,1
359,2,0,It looks nice.,0,0
359,2,1,Everything else, this is a 12 mp camera in print only, the display rates it at 3.1 to 11.8 depending on the size you select.,1,1
359,2,2,It takes the WORST pictures I have ever seen, my old 2mp camera outdoes it, my PHONE outdoes it.,1,1
359,2,3,The photos are blury, full of video noise and frankly, awful is giving it too much credit.,1,1
359,2,4,I took the first one back, 2nd is just as bad.,1,1
360,2,0,This camera is pretty amazing, takes photos at 11.8 MP (not the advertised 12.4).,0,0
360,2,1,Great price for what you get though.,0,0
360,2,2,So many feature that I am now prepared for whatever my kids throw at me(picture wise).,0,0
360,2,3,I really wanted to give this a 5 egg rating due to the quality of the product and the speediness of the eggs shipping, but with the info saying 12.4 MP, the box saying 12, and the Camera telling me 11.8,1,1
360,2,4,This camera also resisted my Windows 7 x64 at first too, it took some time for the drivers to load correctly.,1,1
361,2,0,nice large screen, battery keeps on going and going and going, just can't wear it out.,0,0
361,2,1,shutter opens when in your pants, slower time to shoot,1,1
362,2,0,WATERPROOF!!!  SHOCKPROOF!!! Pocket friendly.,0,0
362,2,1,Perfect for camping, beaches, canoing/tubing, bar hopping!,0,0
362,2,2,This is my new compact camera for parties and walking around.,0,1
362,2,3,It's average quality for a compact camera.,1,1
362,2,4,You pay for the features, only buy this if the features sound good to you.,1,1
362,2,5,You still need an SLR if you want excellent photos.,1,1
363,2,0,Amazing pictures, Panoramic photos w/ xD card, easy controls and pretty useful guide when you need some help.,0,0
363,2,1,In low light, the camera takes about 3-5 seconds to focus before taking the picture.,1,0
363,2,2,This can lead to the wife who received the gift not being to happy with the gift.,1,0
363,2,3,The pics are pretty good for the most part in low light conditions though.,1,0
364,2,0,Underwater pictures and video look amazing.,0,0
364,2,1,Very easy to use and menu screens and settings are easy to setup.,0,0
364,2,2,Battery last a long time and you can easy power of camera by flipping the front slide.,0,0
364,2,3,I really don't see anything wrong with this camera but if i could change a few things.,1,1
364,2,4,I don't link how you remove the battery to charge the unit.,1,1
364,2,5,You must bring the charging base with you on trips so you can recharge battery.,1,1
364,2,6,Also camera is a little large but it has to b to make sure all the parts are encased in a airtight seal to avoid water damage.,1,1
365,2,0,Shock-, water-, and freeze-proof is nice because I'm big on mountain activities.,0,0
365,2,1,It's compact (deck of cards) so it is easy to pack or carry into any situation.,0,0
365,2,2,It reliably takes very nice pictures (DSLR quality) IF you learn how to use it.,0,0
365,2,3,The menus are fairly simple but extensive, which is a gripe for some people but I didn't mind taking the time to learn how to use my new $300 toy.,0,0
365,2,4,The "auto" mode works fairly well for most photos in normal light.,0,0
365,2,5,There are a number of "scenes" to select from that will adjust the camera's setting so a specific situation (snow, action, candle light, fireworks, etc); I like these and I was impressed with how many scenes the camera offers (23 of them, I believe).,0,0
365,2,6,Beyond that the menus can be used to adjust the settings for the camera almost as specifically as you would for an SLR.,0,0
365,2,7,I'm not a fan of the weird lens cover which is also an on/off switch.,1,1
365,2,8,It's good because (obviously) it covers the lens and keeps it free of debris or smudges, but whenever I have it packed in my pocket or backpack it has a tendency to pop open, thereby turning the camera on.,1,1
365,2,9,I've killed a few batteries because of this.,1,1
365,2,10,It isn't as big of a deal if you turn on the power saving, but I don't care for the power saving feature because you have about 15 secs to take a picture before it shuts down on you.,1,1
365,2,11,I wish they would have added a setting that allows you to deactivate the on/off switch feature of the lens cover, but if it's there I haven't found it yet.,1,1
365,2,12,Because of this one annoyance I'm wondering if I shouldn't have gone ahead and spent the extra $50 to get the 1030SW.,1,1
366,2,0,Build quality seems pretty good and doesn’t feel cheap.,0,0
366,2,1,Lots of shooting modes to help get the type of picture you’re trying to take.,0,0
366,2,2,10MP and fast 3X optical zoom.,0,0
366,2,3,Easy to use interface.,0,0
366,2,4,Very slow performance (power on and auto focus).,1,1
366,2,5,Indoors and low light proformace is very slow.,1,1
366,2,6,Image quality is questionable, daytime pictures are pretty good, but nighttime/low light pictures are pretty bad.,1,1
366,2,7,Battery doesn’t last that long so be sure to pick up a spare.,1,1
366,2,8,Tap function is a nice concept, but doesn’t offer enough choices and sometime it isn’t responsive.,1,1
366,2,9,No optical Image Stabilization, the digital Image Stabilization is quite useless as it only increase the ISO which makes your pictures grainy.,1,1
367,2,0,*Works great in the water/ Took into the shower and took amazing photos of the water hitting the surface of objects.,0,0
367,2,1,*Works great in the daytime, captures everything that you can phyiscaly see with your own two eyes
*Works great in the dark, has a niffty led light to show you at night or in a dark room what you are looking at.,0,0
367,2,2,Also has a sensor built into it that takes out bright objects and makes them dimmer so it looks more real in the end photo.,0,0
367,2,3,*Has many cool features i spent a whole day messing with the panaram mode, you take the first picture then it guieds you along for the other 3 pictures to creat a very wide 3-4 picture panaram view / AWESOME and works great.,0,0
367,2,4,*practiced dropping it on many surfaces and still works fine, even concret from about 6 feet up (head level) had a guy bump into me over lanoleum and he freaked out when i dropped it but long story short we had a good laugh.,0,0
367,2,5,There arnet many cons to this camara, if i had to pick something that annoys me i whould have to say its the tapping feature they should have thought that one through better but i give them a (A) for effort, inovators they are.,1,0
368,2,0,Camera works really well, I was torn between this and the D610.,0,0
368,2,1,I chose this camera simply as a budget buy.,0,0

368,2,3,Its fast, quality is fantastic and the wifi is a huge bonus.,0,0
368,2,4,Battery life is awesome, and it is full featured.,0,0
368,2,5,The camera is well built and feels like a professional grade camera.,0,0
368,2,6,The kit lens is one of the better kit lens I have purchased, not as sharp and fast as pro grade lens, but a very good lens for the price.,0,0
368,2,7,Wifi app could use some more features.,1,0
368,2,8,It only works with mobile devices, it will not sync with a laptop.,1,0
369,2,0,It's still a decent price for what you're getting.,0,0
369,2,1,They leave the fact that the two additional lenses are made by Vivitar and not actually comparable with the D7's body without an adapter, so you're going to have to buy another product that will likely lower the autofocus capabilities of the D7.,1,1
369,2,2,The all-or-nothing return policy and the obstacles the site imposes on any customer questions is just the icing on a disappointing and terribly expensive cake.,1,1
370,2,0,Canon 7d speaks for itself
All the items included were very useful.,0,1
370,2,1,A well thought out package.,0,1
371,2,0,-LOTS of pros

-Does every thing I need a DSLR camera to do
-Originally got this for a college class but use it almost everyday
-Very high Iso
-20.1 mp looks amazing in full frame
-Full zoom don't take away from the quality,0,0

372,2,5,Battery life is extremely long (took a two week vacation, tons of videos, no recharge was needed).,0,0
372,2,6,Picture grade is absolutely amazing (even shots of the sun with proper filters).,0,0
372,2,7,LCD adjustable for different shot angles.,0,0
372,2,8,The eye piece has a sensor that detects if you are trying to use it.,1,1
372,2,9,When it detects that you are, it shuts off the LCD.,1,1
372,2,10,When taking pictures in difficult angles or in the dark, this sometimes gets annoying.,1,1
372,2,11,Also, the eye piece and the LCD are too level with each other.,1,1
372,2,12,So, when you use the eye piece, your face is ALWAYS touching the LCD.,1,1
372,2,13,Using stuff like sun block gets all that oil on the LCD.,1,1
373,2,0,This is a really great camera especially for someone just starting out.,0,0

374,2,3,The 20 megapixels are monstrous.,0,0
374,2,4,i looked around, although rather quickly, and in my short judgement time, I felt that this camera was better than the Nikon d3200.,0,0
374,2,5,Other people are using the Nikon in my photo class, and the colors on this are way better.,0,0
374,2,6,This camera should have been over $1,000.,0,0
374,2,7,The only real negatives that I can think of are, and again, I'm no expert, but that it has a bit of a lightweight feel with the thin plastic of the body.,1,1
374,2,8,That means that the camera can be less expensive.,1,1
374,2,9,Also, in low light, a cream colored room came out as slightly pea green on automatic settings.,1,1
374,2,10,I am learning how to adjust colors manually.,1,1
375,2,0,Price, price, price.,0,1

376,2,2,Professional.,0,0
376,2,3,Most of the camera seems to be made out of plastic, making it lightweight which is a pro, but shall i say, "cheap" feel, even though i am not calling this a cheap camera, whatsoever.,1,0
377,2,0,Canon makes a great camera.,0,0
377,2,1,This is really nice camera, it is my first DSLR camera.,0,0
377,2,2,But I also have had a Canon FTB 35mm camera, which is a very nice camera that I purchased in Japan.,0,0
377,2,3,This DSLR is sweet like all the different functions or options the camera has.,0,0
377,2,4,Like the HD and 35mm options.,0,0
377,2,5,I know I'll get many years of use out of this Canon.,0,1
377,2,6,My old Canon FTB is 40 years old and still takes great pictures.,0,1
377,2,7,I do miss taking slides, but they no longer make slide film anymore.,0,1
377,2,8,So this new Canon is a big upgrade for me.,0,1
377,2,9,I got the combo package and the Vivitar tripod spider is useless with this Canon camera.,1,1
377,2,10,It is way too heavy for that type of tripod.,1,1

378,2,4,There may be a work around for this but I haven't looked into it.,0,1
378,2,5,What they don't tell you on the box (unless it's in the really small print) is your router needs uPnP to use the Panasonic operated viewnetcam.com,1,1
378,2,6,hosting site to access this thing on the web.,1,1
378,2,7,My DSL modem/router (Westell 2200) provided by Verizon does not do this.,1,0
378,2,8,After many hours of trial and mostly error I was able to get it working.,1,0
378,2,9,I had to 'borrow' a neighbors network to see it because I couldn't access my viewnetcam address on my own home network.,1,0
378,2,10,You might think I would be happy; problem is it stops working giving page not found errors after a few minutes of successful viewing.,1,0
378,2,11,Registering again with viewnetcam.com would often restore service for another few minutes.,1,0
378,2,12,What's maddening is the Maintenance page clearly shows my camera web address, the error log is clear and my account on the Panasonic website shows active.,1,0

385,2,5,I also had to spend MY MONEY on shipping to return it for repair and then waited 3 weeks until I got it back.,1,1

389,2,2,Set-up isn't exactly streamlined.,1,1
389,2,3,The instructions aren't great either, but they also aren't terrible.,1,1
389,2,4,Probably took me half an hour to get the whole thing set-up and begin streaming to my iPhone.,1,1
389,2,5,The software it comes with is the trial version and won't export recorded videos.,1,1
390,2,0,Found a workaround for the Subnet limitation.,0,1
390,2,1,Basically simulating a small network for the camera.,0,1
390,2,2,It would be a lot eaier if they just allowed all traffic to the camera or at least had the option to turn off the firewall so other subnets could see the camera.,1,0
391,2,0,Image quality is not bad.,0,1
391,2,1,This camera will not work if you have multiple subnets, it only works if you have one router with one network.,1,0
391,2,2,All I needed was a cheap network camera and due to the programming of the firmware, this camera will not work on my network.,1,0
392,2,0,For a cheap IP camera, this is a pretty good deal.,0,1

393,2,4,so I can Panasonic tech support.,1,1

396,2,2,At 20mp shots, it's still fast but don't expect it to be as fast as 10mp camera,1,1

398,2,0,This camera takes great pictures in the bright sun light.,0,0
398,2,1,It is light weight and has a great design.,0,0
398,2,2,This camera is way too much in cost for the quality of pictures it takes if the sun is not shinning brightly.,1,1
398,2,3,I am more dissapointed in the fact that when I contacted new egg about trading it with another (different) camera they refused.,1,1
398,2,4,I knew I could not get my money back but was not happy about not being able to do a trade in.,1,1
398,2,5,If you take pictures where it is not very bright then the camera will take a few seconds to get the picture you are trying to capture and for as long as you have to hold the camera still you really need a tripod if you do not want a blurry picture.,1,1
399,2,0,Great ISO range
Great continuous shooting speed
Kelvin WB settings
More functions than I can list!,0,0
399,2,1,I haven't discovered any cons yet!,1,1
400,2,0,• High build quality (magnesium alloy, as opposed to plastic), feels "right" (hard to describe good build quality, but you know it when you see it)
• Good value for "low level professional" camera (cheaper than D300S at the time of this post, has more features)
• Dual SD card slots can expand the number of shots you can take or use as an instant backup
• Excellent image quality if paired with good glass
• Light weight
• Offers the same features as professional level cameras (i.e., mirror up, takes a cable release, 6 frames per second, takes excellent video)
• Commonly-used settings (ISO, white balance, exposure compensation, flash compensation) are buttons, not options in the menu
• Body-only version, so you don't need to have the kit lenses (which aren't bad, but it's better to save your money and buy good glass),0,1
400,2,1,• Slow buffer (it goes 6 frames per second, but only for a second or two in raw--it has to write to the card before it will let you take more photos) As I don't do sports photography (at least for a living), this does not matter to me

• Crop sensor--for a few hundred dollars more, you can get a full-frame sensor with similar features.,1,0
400,2,2,But you'll need full-frame lenses.,1,0
401,2,0,A LOT of camera for the price.,0,1
401,2,1,Produces excellent images.,0,1

402,2,2,Performance wise is suitable for landscape photographer or portraits photographer, Excellent DSLR, two thumbs up!,0,0
402,2,3,Continuous shooting mode performance goes down after about 20 shots in a row.,1,1
402,2,4,Then goes about 1 or 2 pics/second.,1,1
402,2,5,While Canon 7D is great for sport shooting, you'd never miss a shot with that machine, but not with Nikon D7000.,1,1

403,2,1,Tons of options.,0,1

404,2,3,It can shoot in raw format and the images are incredible!,0,1
404,2,4,I got it with the 28-300mm lens, also from Newegg and am going to aquire a 10-24mm soon.,0,1
404,2,5,Unfortunately Newegg doesn't carry that particular lens, so I'll have to shop elsewhere for that.,0,1
404,2,6,The only cons I can think of are it doesn't come with any memory card, but I bought a couple for the 2 card skots from Newegg, so I gi=uess I'm good there and I don't think many cameras come with memory cards these days anyway.,1,0
404,2,7,The manual is really detailed, about 325 pages detailed, but this thing is just about a computer with a lens attached!,1,0
405,2,0,This camera I purchased last Dec when introduced.,0,0
405,2,1,I've owned all three of the top three in one year, by far the best for Macro, image stability and ease of use when set on default.,0,0
406,2,0,Small but works great for the price, nice case with belt loop, silicon cover fits like a glove.,0,0
406,2,1,This is a great camera for the beach and hiking, you don't have to worry about it getting wet, I was out in the rain taking pictures.,0,0
406,2,2,Nice to see a 2gb card comming with the camera.,0,0
406,2,3,Play back sound not that loud.,1,1
407,2,0,great photo quality; takes better pictures than my canon sd1000.,0,0
407,2,1,i'm usually not a fan of the scene settings, but this camera takes some of the best sunrise/sunset pictures i've seen from point and shoots.,0,0
407,2,2,camera gets great battery life.,0,0
407,2,3,i found that i typically get at least 200 shots per charge.,0,0
407,2,4,lens is made of scratch-resistant material, but is not otherwise protected.,1,1
407,2,5,probably not an issue, but is mentally distressing nonetheless.,1,1
408,2,0,It can fit in a shirt pocket, or front pocket pretty easily.,0,1
408,2,1,The battery doesn't take much longer than two hours to charge.,0,1
408,2,2,Also, the included battery charger is like a little brick, so it's easy to pack on a vacation.,0,1
408,2,3,It takes pictures fast, and the included memory card holds about 400 pictures at the highest quality 10 megpixel setting.,0,0
408,2,4,Face detection technology in this is really nice, it can detect up to four faces, but sunglasses might give it a hard time, however, the face detection mode is totally optional.,0,0
408,2,5,It takes SD cards or SDHC cards, which are easy to find.,0,0
408,2,6,The Scene Recognition Auto mode (or the other, Regular Auto mode) makes it easy to take nice pictures without hassle.,0,0
408,2,7,It's small enough you might lose it.,1,1
408,2,8,In water it sinks like a rock, but you can use the included float strap to solve that.,1,1
408,2,9,To connect it to a computer, you need to keep the unique cable that it comes with.,1,1
408,2,10,The SR Auto mode (it's not the default option, don't worry) drains the battery faster, since the camera is constantly analyzing the scene, and adjusting sensitivity and aperture settings.,1,1
408,2,11,It doesn't use AA batteries, so if you run out of power on the go, you might think to buy an extra NP-45 battery.,1,1
409,2,0,Camera is/was excellent.,0,1
409,2,1,Enjoyed it immensely the first and only time I used it.,0,1
409,2,2,As my first photo event ended, I felt a slight tug on the strap and I heard the crash before I knew what was going on.,1,1
409,2,3,Then I was staring at the remains of a lens, a camera body, and an external flash that were now laying all over the concrete around my feet.,1,1
409,2,4,Invest in a real strap WITH CLIPS!,1,1
410,2,0,Very Poor resolution.,1,0
410,2,1,Not even worth the plastic it was placed in.,1,0

411,2,0,The pictures are very clear, portable all in all its a very nice camera for its money.,0,0
411,2,1,Menu is little harder to get use to,1,1
412,2,0,Solid build, feels great to use.,0,0
412,2,1,Helps me take wonderful pictures.,0,0
412,2,2,Of course, it deserves to be paired with a good lens such as a 28 mm f/1.8 or 40 mm f/2.8.,0,0
412,2,3,With such lenses, it can capture incredible images.,0,0
412,2,4,None except the mediocre kit lens.,1,0
413,2,0,Easy to use, amazing versatility, all-in-all the Rebel line are the best consumer cameras available.,0,0
413,2,1,Price.,1,1
413,2,2,(I know I'm supposed to leave price out of this but it's literally the only Con about this item) 

As a Rebel from 2 generations ago (current model is the Rebel T5i), this is vastly overpriced at $699.,1,1
413,2,3,The Canon on-line store currently has the same model with a zoom lens for $50 less.,1,1
414,2,0,Articulating LCD screen,0,0
414,2,1,poor low light focusing, poor low light high ISO image quality, poor center focus on flat surfaces, terrible buffer performance after three continuous shots, noisy shutter(mirror slap), noisy motor recorded during video usage, non-user friendly controls through menu systems vs buttons.,1,1
415,2,0,The 135mm lens is amazing!,0,0
415,2,1,super clean and clear pictures.,0,0
415,2,2,the canon interface is easy to use, as per usual.,0,0
416,2,0,Fast, Reliable, Easy to use even for a beginner.,0,0
416,2,1,Many features for pros.,0,0
416,2,2,Mine came with a lens which is somewhat too soft when i use the zoom - sometimes the telephoto end just unscrews by itself when the camera is hanging (lens-down) on my neck.,1,1
417,2,0,None that I can tell since it's never worked.,0,1
417,2,1,Canon's warranty repair service,1,1
418,2,0,Easy to learn to use for someone new to DSLR.,0,0
418,2,1,The camera body has some high quality lens which can upgrade to future camera bodies.,0,0
418,2,2,The programming options are easy for me to use, and monochrome in particular looks excellent.,0,0
418,2,3,It's also easy for me to play with aperture or shutter speed depending on the need.,0,0
418,2,4,I used the camera in Yellowstone and the only problem was the cheap filters I bought to go with it.,0,0
418,2,5,Seems kind of silly on my part to spend $1400 on camera equipment and $1.99 on filters.,0,0
418,2,6,Does great (for my expectation) at capturing wildlife.,0,0
418,2,7,I have many good photos of birds in flight captured at a high speed... image is crisp.,0,0
418,2,8,I am not a professional and this is my first non point and shoot camera (though it has a point and shoot mode).,1,1
419,2,0,Extremely versatile and powerful camera.,0,0
419,2,1,Images are fantastic on auto mode and the ability to quickly interchange lenses is incredible.,0,0
419,2,2,Moving up from a point an shoot, I can see the difference is night and day when it comes to photo clarity and light.,0,0
419,2,3,In addition the ability to be able to rapid-fire photos (with a fast memory card) is clutch for catching the perfect shot.,0,0
419,2,4,Obviously the lack of a lens shouldn't be a surprise given the listing says "body only," but be prepared to spend an additional $100 minimum for a lens.,1,1

421,2,6,Zoom is also surprisingly good.,0,0
421,2,7,What an upgrade from my old 3.1MP Kodak DX3900.,0,0
421,2,8,The power button is very close to the shutter button.,1,1
421,2,9,This has been a problem because I have hit the power button and shut off the camera several times instead of snapping the shot.,1,1
422,2,0,Very high and clear picture quality.,0,0
422,2,1,Shoots in RAW.,0,0
422,2,2,Many controls to get a more advanced shot.,0,0

422,2,6,Macro/Normal mode. 2 custom settings as well.,0,0
422,2,7,Can manually control ISO physically on the camera, and shutter speed/aperture control's are easy on the lcd screen.,0,0
422,2,8,Semi-noisy pics in low light such as indoor situations after ISO 200, but will take better pictures with better indoor lighting.,1,1
422,2,9,Some what grainy after ISO 200 in low light.,1,1
423,2,0,Very high quality pictures.... Soooo many options.,0,0
423,2,1,Not a con so much, but it is going to be some learning curve to master all the features.,1,1
424,2,0,I am a Canon Power Shot G9 with 12.1 mega pixels of lusciousness and 6x of unigravitational optical zoomage.,0,1
424,2,1,Stretching with supreme charisma, I have every option an amateur photography + some bombdigity video recording abilities.,0,1

425,2,1,Good quality feel.,0,0
425,2,2,The pictures on high are 3k X 4k large, 12 meg, and take a lot of space in drives and sticks of memory, however, luckily, the new stuff is larger, heh.,0,0
425,2,3,With this, you can be creative as you like to a certain level above my ability, or use the auto modes and take great pics, it has all the preset like night portrait, fireworks settings, snow/beach etc.,0,0
425,2,4,The only con I have found is that the noise level is pretty high for an semi-expensive camera, above 400 ASA equiv is nothing you would want to make a large poster of, but I do few posters.,1,1
425,2,5,This is due, I believe, to the 1/1.7" sensor size at 12 meg density.,1,1
425,2,6,When I bought I knew this, so it is not a surprize, but don't think you will get clear as DSLR results, tho I would be hard pressed to tell the diff in a comparison with 8X10 prints.,1,1
426,2,0,This is an amazing camera!,0,0
426,2,1,I bought it to replace my larger Canon G6 and I really love it - it is small enough to carry in a belt case but has every feature of a pro-sumer camera.,0,0
426,2,2,Even better battery life than the G6 (with smaller batteries) and a really great LCD.,0,0
426,2,3,I have not experienced any problems with the LCD on my camera.,0,0
426,2,4,The lens / filter adapter from Canon for this camera is plastic and doesn't lock to the camera correctly.,1,1
427,2,0,Excellent sharpness, great macro, RAW files, short start up time.,0,0
427,2,1,Great for underwater photography.,0,0
427,2,2,Acceptable ISO 400.,0,1
427,2,3,ISO over 400 is useless.,1,1
427,2,4,Wide end not really wide, which is only 35mm translated to 35mm format.,1,1
427,2,5,It can be solved buying wide angle lens converter for additional $$$.,1,1
427,2,6,Using external flash mounted on hot shoe cause quite serious delay between pressing shutter release button and actual flash fires (about 1 second tested only with NIKON flash).,1,1
428,2,0,The video function is surprisingly good, it adjusts exposure with respect to available light.,0,0
428,2,1,Big 3.5" screen, should buy the screen protector to preserve the beauty.,0,0

428,2,6,So far I am very happy with this purchase.,0,0

431,2,9,I have set up 2 systems at 2 different locations and when setting up 1 or 2 cameras on the same circuit, I had good results.,1,1
431,2,10,When installing 3 or more cameras, however, I have had several issues with the cameras either not being detected at all or dropping off from time to time.,1,1
431,2,11,I plugged all the powerline network adapters into the same extention cord and ran long network cables to all the cameras to fix the issue but this defeats the whole purpose of powerline networking now, doesn't it?,1,1
432,2,0,Well, there just isn't enough good to say about it.,0,0
432,2,1,For the money, at this time, it is just beyond amazing.,0,0

432,2,5,I don't care for the new battery door.,1,1
432,2,6,I don't like the release mechanism for the data card door either.,1,1
432,2,7,The MB-D11 multi-battery grip is just too expensive.,1,0
432,2,8,A great accessory, but too expensive.,1,0
433,2,0,its water proof, what more do you want?! Right out of the box, and into the kitchen sink (first test) I can't wait until summer to take this thing wakeboarding (with a big yellow float tied to it),0,1
433,2,1,for a 10 mega-pix camera...,1,1
433,2,2,I dont know I guess I was expecting more... its also a little on the bulky / heavy side, but thats just because its made out of METAL... this thing should last a LONG time.,1,1
434,2,0,Awesome Camera, it's waterproof, has good optical zoom.,0,0
434,2,1,Doesn't use a standard mini-USB cable, but a smaller connector, while this saves space it's annoying to have another cable to deal with.,1,1
434,2,2,The Image Stabalizer option doesn't have the option to be always running or when the picture is taken unlike in my Canon SD-700is,1,1
435,2,0,Water proof to 30 feet, most are only 10 feet, that could break in a swimming pool, snorkeling would be dangerous.,0,1
435,2,1,This camera give a lot of room for depth judgment.,0,1
435,2,2,Focuses and takes pictures very fast.,0,1
435,2,3,Small and compact very sturdy,0,1
435,2,4,wish it floated lol, wouldnt want to drop it snorkeling or something, probably attach a boat key float or something to the wrist strap,1,1
436,2,0,Awesome pictures under water... take any where and go, no worries at all.,0,0
436,2,1,Friends are all jealous... camera takes great pictures...not professional, but for someone that just wants to take pictures, its great,0,0
436,2,2,just a few little things that i wish were different: No flash for video camera mode, would be nice; have to take battery out of camera to charge; special USB cable to connect to computer.... my old Olympus was just a mini USB...,1,1
437,2,0,It works!,0,0
437,2,1,But it doe a great job of keeping out the water and it is shock proof.,0,0
437,2,2,I would not normally mention ease of operation but my three year old actually uses this camera.,0,0
437,2,3,Hard to find anything in this price range that is water proof.,0,0
437,2,4,I thought the trade off for a water proof camera would be accepting a lower image quality.,0,0

437,2,10,I love Olympus point and shoot cameras, I have three.,1,1
437,2,11,However, the one thing I hate is that you do have to remove the battery to charge it.,1,1
438,2,0,Great picture, almost as good as my Olympus E500 SLR.,0,0
438,2,1,It has survived everything from being beat against rocks and submerged in rivers on hiking trips to being beaten with me in a mosh pit.,0,0
438,2,2,XD cards dont have a very large capacity compared other formats, but it still will take over 400 pictures on one card.,1,1
438,2,3,And with the micro SD adapter you can get some larger capacities.,1,1
439,2,0,I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old who both use it.,0,0
439,2,1,They have dropped it several times and it doesn't phase it.,0,0
439,2,2,We also took it to the pool and it shot flawless video and photos.,0,0
439,2,3,Picture quality is great for a point and shoot.,0,0
439,2,4,Menus are fairly intuitive.,0,0
439,2,5,I wish it used compact flash or SD cards.,1,1
439,2,6,Xd carsPicture quality is not as good as my Nikon D300, but it's a point and shoot.,1,1
439,2,7,It's a little small to hold, but perfect for my pocket.,1,1
439,2,8,There are some adjustment modes, but it lacks manual control over aperture and shutter speed.,1,1
440,2,0,Solid built camera
great features for taking in water and the elements
has a cool video setting that will record and buffer up to the PREVIOUS 2 seconds of footage BEFORE you press record,0,0
440,2,1,Menu system really lacks that of Canon and Nikon.,1,1
440,2,2,Non standard mini-usb plug
uses xdPicture card for storage and not SD
video feature mentioned above is only good for 7 seconds.,1,1
441,2,0,a great camera that has many features that many compact digitals don't have with many capture modes in case you dont really know how to take good pictures of fireworks (like me.)  i was most interested in the waterproof aspect and im pleased to say that the only limiting factor in taking pictures underwater is the clarity of the water.,0,0
441,2,1,in the clean pool i work at ive gotten great action shots of dives and flips, as well as portraits and such.,0,0
441,2,2,the manometer (pressure guage) is very cool and the camera remembers the depth aany picture was taken at.,0,1
441,2,3,the lcd can be hard to see when the ambient light is very bright, and even harder underwater.,1,1
441,2,4,the menu can be cumbersome to navigate through,1,1
442,2,0,Pros: Small, rugged, waterproof, easy to use for most simple point&shoot shots, good pics (not as good as my DSLR shots but then it goes where the DSLR can't) & good videos w/sound.,0,0
442,2,1,Cons: Uses proprietary battery & memory card if you want unlimited video (annoying but minor), no optical viewfinder for those rare times the LCD display washes out, battery drains quickly when transferring pics to computer (I suggest the optional DC power supply & adapter, adapter should be part of the basic camera kit but isn't).,1,1

444,2,8,This software does a good job managing, converting and editing images from this camera.,0,0
444,2,9,This software can convert to various image formats and resolutions.,0,0
444,2,10,And has not slowed down or harmed my XP Home computer (not spyware/bloatware),0,1
444,2,11,The 1/2.35" CCD image sensor is relatively small and for low-light situations can produce noisy pictures if short exposures are made.,1,1
444,2,12,For bright daylight use, the screen is not bright enough and it’s hard to frame pictures with this camera.,1,1
444,2,13,The Li-50 battery is a proprietary size, expensive to replace and relatively difficult to locate.,1,1
444,2,14,Does not come with an xD memory card.,1,1
444,2,15,xD memory cards are confusing if you are not experienced.,1,1
444,2,16,A 2GB xD Type-M card is OK for still photography.,1,1
444,2,17,For video capture, xD Type-H memory cards are necessary.,1,1
444,2,18,Type-H memory cards are hard to find.,1,1

445,2,3,At the end we had taken more than 1800  (not typo, yes 1800)  All but a few dozen turned out fantastic!,0,0
445,2,4,Compared to Professional Grade DSLR cameras the pictures may be slightly fuzzy, or have a yellow hue.,1,1
445,2,5,Turning off the auto white balance generally will fix the yellow problem.,1,1
445,2,6,As for the fuzzy pictures,  You can't notice it with the naked eye, even on an 8x10 enlargement.,1,1
445,2,7,Only con... focus is a little slow in 15 feet of water (but what do you expect?),1,1
446,2,0,Good opportunity take underwater pictures and QVGA movies, but not a long time...,0,0
446,2,1,At the First day of my Hawaiian vacation all black color been washed out with ocean water without any efforts from my side.,1,1
446,2,2,On Third day I already looked for another underwater camera and did write letter to Olympus Repair Service ( 6 days ago - no answer yet).,1,1
446,2,3,Nothing :(( just a small protection shield on lens been dropped down ( clued off) when I had snorkeling on water ( no any dive been done deeper then 5-6 ft) and water from all Pacific ocean leaked into camera, because this small protection shield cloaking seal which protects electronic board.,1,1
446,2,4,What I felt those time  - you 'll better never feel.,1,1
446,2,5,And definitely, first idea was to write the letter to Olympus team.,1,1
446,2,6,Probably it happened before Christmas, I got a wrong idea that Great Olympus Santa will send me another camera and I will happy like a child...But, I'll tell you a secret - there is no Santa in Olympus ( and probably in the world as well).,1,1
447,2,0,great picture quality, amazing underwater photos, extremely tough exterior, lens is good, works in saltwater as well as freshwater with no need to worry about corrosion (as long as you follow directions including rinsing of the camera after use within an hour) overall a spectacular buy,0,0
447,2,1,optical zoom could be better,1,1
448,2,0,I find the picture/video quality to be pretty good.,0,0
448,2,1,Its a slim camera that obviously feels very durable.,0,0
448,2,2,The zoom isn't that bad considered its all internal.,0,0
448,2,3,I went diving in the Bahamas with this thing, and it broke within 10ft of depth (rated to 33ft).,1,1
448,2,4,I had to send it back to get fixed (pay for shipping), and had to buy a new battery which wasn't covered under the warranty.,1,1
448,2,5,It seems to be working fine though now.,1,1
449,2,0,Water proof, shock proof, freeze proof, ninja proof, beer proof.,0,0
449,2,1,It takes super huge pictures (10.1 mp is nice!), has some neat-o features, and is durable as all get out.,0,0
449,2,2,Get the super huge 2gb m+ flash memory card, and you'll be able to take hundreds of pictures on the highest setting, or thousands on the lowest!,0,0
449,2,3,The little LED light is super helpful.,0,0
449,2,4,Battery runs out fairly fast, so you'll want to use the power save option (although this may cause you to miss a photo opportunity), and the battery must be taken out of the camera to be charged (no power cord).,1,1
449,2,5,The auto-focus kind of sucks, but what would you expect with a point and shoot?,1,1
449,2,6,The panorama also doesn't work quite as expected--you're better off with a good eye and some Photoshop skills.,1,1
449,2,7,Screen is kind of hard to see in strong daylight.,1,1
449,2,8,Delay from pressing the capture button to when the photo is shot is kind of slow--like most digital cameras.,1,1
449,2,9,Remedy this by using the hi-speed shutter setting.,1,1
450,2,0,This is my second Olympus digital camera and all I can say about the Stylus 1030 SW is that its SMOOTH.,0,0
450,2,1,The features are amazing (compare the features to any other digital camera and you will see that the Stylus 1030 SW is the REAL DEAL) and I will test the durabilities here in Afghanistan.,0,0
450,2,2,I had the the Stylus 730 and it fell from about 4ft and the LCD monitor crack.,0,0
450,2,3,Olympus has a winner in the Stylus 1030 SW.,0,0
450,2,4,The Stylus 1030 SW is money well spent.,0,0
450,2,5,NONE at the moment but if it doesn't stand up to the environment of a Marine in Afghanistan, you will know.,1,0
451,2,0,This is my new favorite camera, we purchased this for a trip to Hawaii this summer.,0,0
451,2,1,Performed flawlessly.,0,0
451,2,2,Underwater shots were full of color and very clear.,0,0
451,2,3,I'm very much a klutz and have dropped this camera more than once, very rugged.,0,0
451,2,4,Even survived a canoe trip with the boy scouts!,0,0
451,2,5,Autofocus is a little too slow in low light situations (not totally unreasonable performance).,1,0
451,2,6,The lens is a little "soft" for my taste, but slight sharpening with photo editing tool produces brilliant pictures.,1,0
452,2,0,Takes awesome pictures.,0,0
452,2,1,Lots of features.,0,0
452,2,2,Camera is very solid and has a good feel to it.,0,0
452,2,3,LCD screen is great.,0,0
452,2,4,Battery life is great.,0,0
452,2,5,Underwater pictures turn out fine.,0,0
453,2,0,I've Now owned this camera for 3 years, and it has done me well.,0,0
453,2,1,I have dunked it, dented it, froze it in harsh Montana winters and taken long underwater adventures with it.,0,0
453,2,2,The photo quality is superb, even for a compact camera.,0,0
453,2,3,The zoom is adequate but small.,0,0
453,2,4,The controls are well laid out and the menu navigation is easy to use.,0,0
453,2,5,I have a 2GB M+ card and have only filled the thing twice since owning it.,0,0
453,2,6,The battery gave out before I ran out of space.,0,0
453,2,7,I picked up an extra battery for about $15, so that's not an issue any longer.,0,0
453,2,8,If you read the manual and understand the settings, you'll have an incredible pocket camera that happens to be daily life proof (and kid proof and weatherproof).,0,0
453,2,9,The camera does suffer one fairly large flaw.,1,0
453,2,10,There is a loudly audible 'clicking' noise when taking videos.,1,1
453,2,11,It clips out the sound in the scene and makes watching the videos a bit obnoxious.,1,1
453,2,12,It really isn't a con, but you have to be absolutely meticulous about the USB and battery door openings.,1,1
453,2,13,It only takes a hair or a piece of sand (which is almost never near any natural sources of water!) to get in the seal and make it no longer water proof.,1,1
453,2,14,I know that this is what happened to mine (after 3 years) and I'm sure that is what happened to other reviewers complaining of it not being very waterproof.,1,1
453,2,15,I didn't baby may camera, but I made absolutely sure that the seals were clean before closing them and taking it into the water.,1,1
454,2,0,Haven't owned it that long.,0,0
454,2,1,Screen is bright and vivid.,0,0
454,2,2,xD M+ memory cards do not fit most computer's memory card readers.,1,1
454,2,3,No card adapter was provided so there is no easy way to pop the xD card out of the camera and into a computer.,1,1
454,2,4,You need to buy xD M+ cards to record video.,1,1
455,2,0,A very compact and useable camera, the controls are quick and intuitive.,0,0
455,2,1,A fairly fast startup time means  I miss less shots.,0,0
455,2,2,I use this camera in the outdoors on hikes and when I need to be lightweight.,0,0
455,2,3,It fits that niche perfectly with good battery life and of course the waterproof and shockproof features.,0,0
455,2,4,Less than stellar image quality.,1,1
455,2,5,When outside the sun casts a reflection across the viewfinder, which also shows up in the final image.,1,1
455,2,6,If I use my hand to shade the lens I can minimize this, so I guess its a good thing you can shoot with one hand.,1,1
455,2,7,I'm used to using a Nikon dslr, so using a point and shoot with its limited controls is disappointing, but I knew that going in.,1,1
455,2,8,I wish there was a saturation setting I could bump up a bit.,1,1
456,2,0,This camera has many pros to offer.,0,1
456,2,1,It's a 10 MP, low noise (with proper ISO settings), moderate zoom, small, and of course, water, crush, freeze, drop proof.,0,1
456,2,2,It is a rugged little camera that can take a good beating.,0,1
456,2,3,I've taken it to an amusement park, with a water park, and attempted to abuse the camera.,0,1
456,2,4,It came through 2 days abuse without a single blemish.,0,1
456,2,5,I had no fears of water ingress.,0,1
456,2,6,The batter managed to last all 10+ hours of use (granted I didn't keep it 'on' all 10 hours).,0,1
456,2,7,When used with an Olympus M+ XD card (2 gig), I was able to shoot panoramic shots, and many 5 min.+,0,1
456,2,8,videos.,0,1
456,2,9,The image quality isn't going to match a full-frame CCD dSLR 10 MP camera.,1,1
456,2,10,Then again, if you need that kind of quality, don't expect it from a non-dSLR camera.,1,1
456,2,11,There IS a price to pay for that kind of quality.,1,1
456,2,12,This camera performs exceptionally well, for the size of the camera and the size of the CCD chip.,1,0
456,2,13,You have to read and understand the camera quality settings before getting 'great' shots.,1,0
456,2,14,Also, there isn't single camera in thie category that will perform 'perfectly' in low-light situations without indepth knowledge of what you're doing, and a tripod.,1,0
456,2,15,That being said, this camera exceeded my expectations for night shots at the amusement park.,1,0
456,2,16,The ONLY con I can give this camera is that it does not have full-manual control.,1,0
456,2,17,Then again, I purchased this camera as a point and shoot.,1,0
456,2,18,If I want fully auto, I'll lug my dSLR.,1,0
457,2,0,This little baby worked as advertised.,0,1
457,2,1,I spent most of the time in the water along the Seven Mile Beach in the Caymans and took fabulous pictures while snorkeling and in the pool at the hotel.,0,1
457,2,2,Underwater shots were magnificent!,0,1
457,2,3,You need to order the Olympus XD M+ (Plus) memory cards to record videos longer than 10sec.,0,1
457,2,4,I took a lot of videos to and had plenty of memory left on the 2 gig card to take over 1000 pictures!,0,1
457,2,5,Zoom could use some improvement.,1,0
458,2,0,What a cool little camera!,0,0
458,2,1,This thing takes very nice shots both on land and underwater + underwater video!,0,0
458,2,2,Compact, tight feel, good battery life, lots of pre-configured modes.,0,0
458,2,3,TOTALLY WATER PROOF!,0,0
458,2,4,Nice big screen.,0,0
458,2,5,No big deal breakers here.,0,0
458,2,6,Coming off an older Canon that used AA batteries, I don't like the proprietary battery.,1,1
458,2,7,Now I have to keep track of the charge, but the trade off is a small size.,1,1
458,2,8,One minor design flaw that I see is  that the back of the camera is completely flat and flush with the screen.,1,1
458,2,9,This camera is billed as a shock/water proof unit, inviting heavy use.,1,1
458,2,10,If you leave this camera face up and it slides around, it runs the risk of scratching the screen.,1,1
458,2,11,It should have been recessed by 2-3 mm.,1,1
458,2,12,Some nice accessories (floating strap, rubber camera wrap) only available through Oly.,1,1
459,2,0,I have had many cameras and this one is by far the best.,0,0
459,2,1,It is great for throwing around and taking to beach.,0,0
459,2,2,It works great in water and out!,0,0
459,2,3,There are so many different options and settings.,0,0
459,2,4,It is perfect for taking just about any sort of picture.,0,0
459,2,5,It fits right in your pocket.,0,0
459,2,6,The only tough thing is the zoom does not go that far.,1,1
460,2,0,Put on an lcd protector and a sleek silicone skin.,0,0
460,2,1,I'm ready for Memorial Day in the Rocky Mts.,0,0
460,2,2,I've had a Stylus 300 All Weather for the last 5 years.,0,0
460,2,3,It has worked great.,0,0
460,2,4,I've taken over 5,000 photos.,0,0
460,2,5,It still works great.,0,0
460,2,6,I was ready for an upgrade.,0,0
460,2,7,Video with sound,,, These cameras are worth the extra money.,0,0
460,2,8,I've ATV'd, boated, hunted in extreme conditions and they keep on working.,0,0
460,2,9,You need to order the Olympus XD M+ (Plus) memory cards to record videos longer than 10sec.,1,1
460,2,10,I didn't know this and purchased 2 x 2gb M xd chips.,1,1
460,2,11,I only could find them on the Olympus webpage to order, ordered 2 x 2gb M+ at $38 a peice.,1,1
461,2,0,NewEgg has the  best price on this camera  at 340$ vs the usual 400$.,0,0
461,2,1,Rhe 1030sw is overall a great upgrade to the 770sw.,0,0
461,2,2,The most obvious pro of the 1030sw is its extreme durability and seamless above/below water transitions.,0,0
461,2,3,The controls are much faster and smoother.,0,0
461,2,4,One feature that drove me crazy on the 770sw was the video mode had to be selected each time you turned the camera on.,0,0
461,2,5,I can leave the 1030sw in video mode for quick follow up videos, or switch back to pictures in an instant.,0,0
461,2,6,The 1030sw easily fits in my pocket without worry of bouncing it around to much.,0,0
461,2,7,3.6 zoom is pretty nice considering its all inside the camera.,0,0
461,2,8,The beautiful anodized green finish tops everything off!,0,0
461,2,9,Cons...,1,1
461,2,10,Only a 3.6x zoom is a downside to some.,1,1
461,2,11,However being a 10.1 mega-pixel camera, I rarely zoom in anyways.,1,1
461,2,12,Another con would have to be everyone will want your camera, considering my 770sw was stolen, trust me I know!,1,1
462,2,0,The seller is very honorable resent one of the small lenses with out any issues.,0,1
462,2,1,i'm happy with my order.,0,0
462,2,2,no cons,1,1
463,2,0,My first DSLR a lil disappointment...,0,1
463,2,1,Deliver (5-7 days) the tracking wasn't that accurate, Package arrive after 9 days except weekend... it was a open package someone just tape it up with a clear tape, the package was missing a 1-Extended Life Replacement LPE8 Battery.,1,0
464,2,0,I bought this over similar cameras for the articulated (fully tiltable) LCD display panel which lets me take pictures of kids and pets at their eye level, or overhead event pictures in crowds.,0,0
464,2,1,Not used a LOT, but excellent when needed.,0,0
464,2,2,And almost indispensable for extreme closeup (macro) photography.,0,0
464,2,3,I am getting clearly superior images compared to my previous non-DSLR cameras.,0,0
464,2,4,The D5100's extremely high pixel count is valuable when using very high-resoulution lenses.,0,0
464,2,5,I generally recommend AGAINST pixel-count comparisons, but with this camera and Nikkor lenses, you CAN see image features being resolved even when they are magnified so individual pixels are distinguishable.,0,0
464,2,6,Other DSLRs are comparable, but this lets me use my ancient Nikkor F vintage 1970 (and newer) lenses, It is relatively light and compact for a DSLR, which is a plus for me.,0,0
464,2,7,VERY fast shooting.,0,0
464,2,8,Fantastic autofocus.,0,0
464,2,9,Fun in-camera effects I thought I'd never use.,0,0
464,2,10,If you are accustomed to a "Point & Shoot" camera, be ready for a nuch bigger and heavier camers.,1,1
464,2,11,Borrow one for a couple of days to make sure it fits your life style.,1,1
464,2,12,It can use old Nikon F lenses, but requires "AF-S" lenses for full functionality.,1,1
464,2,13,Some features of more-expensive models were removed to reduce manufacturing cost, some only for marketing reasons.,1,1
464,2,14,No deal-breakers, but a bit annoying.,1,1
465,2,0,Best price I have seen for this excellent camera body.,0,0
465,2,1,If you are a newbie in higher level photography, Think this through.,1,1
465,2,2,This camera body has no lens.,1,1
465,2,3,That is as I want it, because I want a more versatile lens than the 18-55 mm zoom everybody else's kit includes.,1,1
465,2,4,The combo Newegg offers includes a 70-300mm zoom.,1,1
465,2,5,If you buy this, you will also need to buy a main lens in, say, the 24-50mm range.,1,1
465,2,6,The Nikon 18-55mm is a decent choice.,1,1
465,2,7,You will very seldom mount the 70-300 unless you are specializing in something like nature or sports photography.,1,1
466,2,0,Fast, precise auto-focus, outstanding low light performance, solid construction, dual CF card slots, unique situational focus modes, dual processors with one processor dedicated to focusing.,0,1
466,2,1,Canon has an $800.00 rebate good until 03JAN2015 on the US spec 1DX.,0,0
466,2,2,Expensive, complex, full-size camera.,1,0
467,2,0,This camera does a lot of things and is a bit of a jack of all trades but a master of none.,0,1
467,2,1,If there is one thing this camera can do better than most is high detail in low light situations.,0,1
467,2,2,Night time shots with hardly any lighting?,0,1
467,2,3,Not a problem at all and as a matter of fact the camera enhances what the human eye can't see 10 fold.,0,1
467,2,4,For instance, take a shot of a zoomed out ultra wide shot of the city and the stars you can't see show up clear as day with this camera.,0,1
467,2,5,Truly a fun camera and for the price being at the low end of the full body cameras out there it is well worth it.,0,1
467,2,6,Action shots are not this camera's strength at all.,1,0
467,2,7,Sure you can get some good shots but overall it is not a great action capture camera.,1,0
468,2,0,This is everything you would come to expect from a quality DSLR, and is a fantastic jump forward from the Rebel I was previously using.,0,0
468,2,1,The level of control, as well as the quantity and richness of the various make this camera great first upgrade for those interested in doing photography as "more than a hobby.",0,0
468,2,2,The setting controls can be a little difficult to use as so many features have to be crammed into so few buttons and dials.,1,1
468,2,3,While I like Canon's scroll wheel for quick and easy access through various settings, and for photo reviews, the learning curve to use these settings quickly and efficiently is somewhat steep considering their intuitive nature.,1,1
469,2,0,First off, ordering this camera from Newegg was a GREAT DEAL.,0,0
469,2,1,Not only did I get the camera I wanted, but I got an AWESOME camera bag and a 64 GB card with it for free.,0,0
469,2,2,So thank you Newegg!,0,0
469,2,3,The camera itself is so awesome.,0,0
469,2,4,I'm a videographer and used to work on a Canon t3i, but this just blows my footage away.,0,0
469,2,5,I love everything about it!,0,0
470,2,0,I bought this camera to replace a t3i which could not manage low light scenes even when using a Zeiss 35mm 1.4f lens.,0,0
470,2,1,Using the same lens on this 6D body has taken my photography to a whole new level as photos look better and I can actually take low light shots at high ISOs with relatively less grain.,0,0
470,2,2,You can change the white balance temperatures manually (in Kelvin).,0,0
470,2,3,This is a feature which was non existent on my t3i but is absolutely needed if you want your photos to reproduce the colors you see with your eye.,0,0
470,2,4,I am using a SanDisk microSD card with an adapter to full size with this camera.,1,1
470,2,5,Although the microSD card is rated class 10 and 60MB/s I find that this camera hesitates between photos.,1,1
470,2,6,I suspect its the adapter which is causing problems but I will have to deal with it since I need the microSD card to fit my surface pro 2 for photo viewing.,1,1
470,2,7,I think this is my fault but it is something to consider,1,1
471,2,0,The full-frame has allowed me to make some macro shots that were not possible with other cameras due to the increased depth of field.,0,0
471,2,1,GPS is a great feature.,0,0
471,2,2,GPS causes the battery life to be shortened, but I'll just have to keep an eye on battery level.,1,1
472,2,0,Performs incredibly well, with all the bells and whistles.,0,0
472,2,1,Images are superb, processor is fast, and the HD video functionality is excellent.,0,0
472,2,2,Wireless capabilities and built in HDR are nice new features.,0,0
472,2,3,Can't record video through the wifi utility, despite having live view.,1,1
473,2,0,Picture quality, low light use, good price, full frame,0,0
473,2,1,Only 11 AF points, SD card with only 1 slot.,1,1
473,2,2,No CF card like 5D mk3,1,1
474,2,0,I bought this camera because it has most of the features from the Canon 5D Mark III, with a fraction of the cost
- Excellent Low Light performance (thanks to the full framed sensor, opposed to Cropped or ASP-C sensors)
- 4.9 FPS shooting speed (not amazing, but fast enough)
- 1080p 30 / 720p 60 video recording
- Comfortable grip and logical button placement

The 24-105mm f/4.0 lens is fairly versatile.,0,0
474,2,1,There's very noticeable chromatic aberration, vignetting, and geometric distortion, however, these are easily corrected in post production (Programs like Adobe's Camera Raw even has built in profiles for camera corrections)
Professionals/pro-sumers know that prime lenses are sharper, yet if you don't know what you're shooting, this isn't a bad place to start.,0,0
474,2,2,- Moire/ Noise from video
I need to do more testing/ shooting but I'm finding a bit more noise from textures/ moire in the video footage (only a con if you need the footage to be perfect, otherwise, the video footage is beautiful)

- One downside is the Focusing/ Autofocus speeds.,1,1
474,2,3,It is not terrible, but do some research if you are shooting sports/ fast moving subjects.,1,1
474,2,4,- only one card slot (SD UHS-1 speeds)- no Compact Flash Card Slot
  SD card speeds are fast enough, this is not a huge con for me

- no headphone jack for monitoring audio,1,1
475,2,0,Excellent full frame camera.,0,1
475,2,1,Weight is acceptable, and it can be held by one hand.,0,1
475,2,2,Of course, if you're using those massive L lenses then even two hands won't be enough to hold those lenses comfortably.,0,1
475,2,3,The 6D is a solid performer in daylight and lowlight.,0,1
475,2,4,It can handle high ISOs without any issues.,0,1
475,2,5,We're talking about 25000+ ISOs here.,0,1
475,2,6,Of course this will also vary in your lens.,0,1
475,2,7,Those wide aperture L lenses will provide you enough light in lowlight.,0,1
475,2,8,The 6D also takes great video movies, though I haven't tested that feature fully because I'm more into photography.,0,1
475,2,9,The 6D menu is easy to navigate.,0,1
475,2,10,Honestly, I have read the manual from cover to cover, but I haven't tinkered all the features in the camera (Make sure to set the copyright information right away and register your battery in the system menu).,0,1
475,2,11,I focus more on practical usage.,0,1
475,2,12,The WIFI feature is a nice addition along with the iPhone app.,0,1
475,2,13,It's like having a viewable remote, though I don't use it often.,0,1
475,2,14,I bought a separate remote switch controller since it's simpler to use than enabling WIFI and running the iPhone app (it's not that really complicated but the separate remote switch has the better tactile feel).,0,1
475,2,15,I haven't used GPS much for fear of draining my battery (now that I have extra two more Canon batteries, also ordered in NewEgg), I think I can now safely enable it.,0,1
475,2,16,In the final analysis, the reason why you would get this camera over other models are the following:

* Canon-brand.,0,1
475,2,17,* It's a full frame camera and not an APSC.,0,1
475,2,18,* Your existing lens set.,0,1
475,2,19,If you've heavily invested in Canon lenses already, then you definitely need to get a Canon body
* The cheapest of all Canon full frame
* You value video but you don't care much about Moire patterns in video (5D Mark III handles Moire patterns far better)
* Weight is lightweight compare to the more expensive full frame camers
* New sensor and better ISO handling than higher Canon full frame models

All other reasons are secondary.,0,1
475,2,20,By the way the included kit lens, 24-105 L, is a superb well-rounded lens.,0,1
475,2,21,It won't disappoint you.,0,1
475,2,22,That's another reason to get this package.,0,1
475,2,23,The negatives:
* Video is susceptible to Moire patterns
* No mic jack out
* No integrated flash for controlling external speedlites (Yes, that's right.,0,1
475,2,24,You want an integrated flash for controlling external speedlites and not because of the light.,0,1
475,2,25,Integrated flash are weak),0,1
475,2,26,* Video is susceptible to Moire patterns
* No mic jack out
* No integrated flash for controlling external speedlites,1,1
476,2,0,Very easy to set up.,0,1
476,2,1,No cable runs to worry about.,0,1
476,2,2,Brightness selector works well.,0,1
476,2,3,Can't invert image for upside down cam mount.,1,1
477,2,0,The picture quality is excellent; I have a 1 gig memory card and can take a bunch of 30 second videos and pictures.,0,0
477,2,1,The Lens cover after about 250 photos started to not open all the way and it can be open manual but it is a pain if you do not check to see if it is open before taking a picture and the lens gets dirty from touching it when opening it up.,1,1
477,2,2,The picture delay is slow it can take up to about 2.5 seconds before you can take another picture.,1,1

478,2,4,It's amazing.,0,0
478,2,5,Batteries run relatively quickly, but I guess it's a common problem for many digital cameras and shouldn't be a consideration.,1,1
478,2,6,It's worth it.,1,1
478,2,7,You will need rechargable batteries anyway, so no problem at all.,1,1

479,2,3,I don't know if this is a common problem of not.,1,1
480,2,0,great camera, such a low price, my favorite part is all the manual settings, by using the aperature, and shutter speeds i no longer have to use a flash and can really see the beauty of a picture, and the manual focus makes it possible to take pictures with character, but if that doesnt flot your boat it also has point and shoot.,0,0

491,2,4,Can also see a histogram to check if you may need to retake the pic.,0,0
491,2,5,Didn't see a way to transfer files from the camera directly, It wanted to use the camera as a Twain device (like a scanner) so the 3mb pics take of 30mb...  Work around was to just use a card reader instead of plugging camera into computer.,1,1

498,2,0,Working with a JVC Pro HD video camera for work all day I needed something to capture all of these events for myself plus a little fun on the side.,0,0
498,2,1,This camera offers all of the fun features like color selection and miniature mode that folks always seem to want but the main thing I enjoy is the sheer speed and clarity.,0,0

498,2,3,The sky is the limit on your creativity to just experiment and have fun.,0,0

543,2,1,I mostly let the camera pick its own settings, but it's great to have the options of setting things myself.,0,0
543,2,2,Horrible delay after taking three pictures in a row, due to Kodak making the bad decision of processing all photos taken in automatic mode.,1,1

587,2,6,It's the best camera I've owned.,0,0
587,2,7,These are not picky, but they are cons.,1,1
587,2,8,The memory card slot is in with the batteries.,1,1
587,2,9,This protects it, but also makes it a bit inconvenient to get at.,1,1
587,2,10,The thing eats batteries (like all digital cameras).,1,1
587,2,11,I recommend getting a charger (I bought the Powerex one and it works GREAT).,1,1
588,2,0,I got this as a gift, and it's an amazing camera, I totally love it!,0,0
588,2,1,I've gotten some really beautiful pics with this baby.,0,0
588,2,2,hmm... one time it messed up with detecting the remaining battery life.,1,1

588,2,4,Of course, I've got the rechargeable batteries you can buy with it.,1,1
589,2,0,Good picture quality, nice lenses and great zoom.,0,0
589,2,1,To be honest, for this much money I was expecting much better quality.,1,1
589,2,2,My brand new verizon trio cell phone takes pictures that nearly match the resolution of this camera for less than 1/10th the price.,1,1
589,2,3,Furthermore, I compared the quality of this camera's pictures printed out to the ones that I had developed at W*l-M**t from a disposable camera and they were comparable to say the least.,1,1
589,2,4,Spend the money elsewhere.,1,1
590,2,0,As of early September 2005 this is the very cutting edge of digital camera technology in a 35mm based format.,0,1
590,2,1,The quality of the build, the image sensor producing stunning resolution and the full range of controls and options makes this a camera without peer.,0,1
590,2,2,A full size sensor allows the use of wide angle lenes at the full width of their view.,0,1
590,2,3,It also allows narrow depth of field which smaller sensors do not.,0,1
590,2,4,Lastly it allows you the option of cropping images without signifcant sacrifices in enlagement options.,0,1
590,2,5,System is said to be water proof, like very briefly "under water proof", but I've decided not to test that feature with my camera.,0,1
590,2,6,If you are considering this camera you should know that it performs best with Canon's top level "L" lenses.,1,0
590,2,7,I recommend the 16-35L, 24-70L and the 70-200L IS to get the very best image quality.,1,0
590,2,8,Also note that this is a heavy camera built on a milled out solid Magnesium shell.,1,0
590,2,9,It is big and heavy, not ideal for taking vacation shots.,1,0
590,2,10,The sensor is delicate and somewhat difficult to clean.,1,0
590,2,11,Dust is attracted to the sensor since it is charged and switching lenese introduces dust to the mirror box and the sensor during exposure.,1,0
591,2,0,Unlike Alpha 143, who can only dream,"puts his cell phone camera to shame", what a putz.,0,1
591,2,1,I actually sold my Canon Film collection, of over 40 classic camera from the 50's-80's, and spent the money on this, as well as a 4G Ultra CF Card.,0,1
591,2,2,It will probably take me 6 months to totally master this camera.,0,1
591,2,3,I have taken 100 images so far, just to play with the settings, and the printed digital images, on quality Canon heavyweight glossy paper, rival, and exceed anything I ever accomplished with my beloved Canon match needle 1970 F-1.,0,1

593,2,0,Can't beat the image quality.,0,1

597,2,1,It was always my belief that a camera had to have a substantial body mass to be dependable and of high quality.,0,1
597,2,2,It is light in weight, perfectly ballanced, and superb in structual and optical quality.,0,1

602,2,1,For $289 and No tax for Utah Free Shipping This camera get a 6 out of 5 stars for that amazing deal for a camera that has great picture quality, it has about half the size sensor in it than a full frame SLR camera, Full frame being that of the standard 35mm, so it has a 14-42mm lens but that equals a 28-84 mm lens because its half the size of a Full Sensor.,0,0
602,2,2,Normal point and shoot cameras have about 1/10 the size sensor of a full frame camera.,0,0
602,2,3,This camera was such a great deal that my girlfriend got one and my good friend also got one.,0,0

602,2,5,None for that kind of money.,1,1
602,2,6,Sure the camera is only 8 out of 10 as good as the Sony nex series(based on picture quality of Sony being a 10) but its more that half the cost, If this camera came out at 289 all the reviews would have gave it 5 stars because how can you rate something bad when its more that half the cost of the competition with 8 10ths the picture quality.,1,1
603,2,0,Tilt and Pan, easy to hook up like all Night Owl cams,0,1

608,2,3,This package really does have everything and I love the photos I am getting with the camera.,0,0
608,2,4,The zoom lens was great to have for long distance shots, and although it is heavy, it's well worth the effort.,0,0
608,2,5,The review screen is large enough to get a good idea of your shots and it also displays needed information about settings, battery life, amount of pictures taken, etc.,0,0
608,2,6,Having the lenses, filters, two SD cards, tripods, bag, etc. all in one package is fantastic for those who are upgrading.,0,0

608,2,10,The five star rating is well deserved despite the one caveat below in the cons section.,0,1
608,2,11,SD card reader.,1,1
608,2,12,I used the usb cord to upload photographs to my computer until just this past week.,1,1
608,2,13,My 32gb SD card has over 2000 photos on it, so this took a while and I decided to try the card reader that came with the package to be able to download faster.,1,1
608,2,14,The card reader made the 32gb SD Card unusable and unreadable.,1,1
608,2,15,I lost all of my photos stored on it (fortunately, most of them were already downloaded to my hard drive, but about 200 recent ones were lost)  and I am unable to use the card in my camera.,1,1
608,2,16,I googled the card reader and contacted the company after I read others reviews of it ~ apparently this is a common problem.,1,1
608,2,17,I have not heard from them and I'm now out a 32gb SD card which was only about 1/2 full, as well as the loss of photos.,1,1
609,2,0,Just absolutely love the camera and the additional products in the kit.,0,0

610,2,0,- you pay for what you get, good camera w HD pictures for a good price
-10x zoom and 10Mp resolution this is actually what got me to buy it,0,1
610,2,1,the video function has a problem; I don't know if it specific to the item I bought or it's a general feature in this model but when trying to zoom while recording the picture is never focused, the camera tries to focus it but always stops at a point where the picture is out-of-focus.,1,0
610,2,2,if I don't use the zoom the video is perfect but it's a big loss, I think, to have 10x optical zoom Being enable to use it,1,0
611,2,0,10x Optical Zoom, a great feature.,0,1
611,2,1,slightly larger than those slim cameras.,0,1
611,2,2,This camera fits better in my hand.,0,1
611,2,3,Quality increases over time at the same price point.,0,1
611,2,4,This replaced my Z885 but had a better zoom and higher resolution as well as the slightly larger size.,0,1
611,2,5,Does use the LR6 rechargables (2500ma batteries).,0,1
611,2,6,Movie mode is pretty good but needs a decent light source.,0,1
611,2,7,They can come out grainy otherwise.,0,1
611,2,8,Added a button just for the flash capabilities so you don't have to go into menu mode to manipulate the flash.,0,1
611,2,9,This was listed as an easy share camera but it did not use the Easyshare III Camera dock like my z885.,1,0
611,2,10,My fault for not looking at that a bit closer.,1,0
611,2,11,Also could not reuse the VR6 dual lithium batteries I had for the Z885 (guess the wife gets more rechargables for her Z1285).,1,0
612,2,0,Excellent turnaround, as usual, from Newegg.,0,0
612,2,1,Received my Panasonic DMC-G2K, via UPS, in one day!,0,1
612,2,2,From the online reviews, this is supposed to be a great camera.,0,1
612,2,3,The camera, that I received from Newegg, was manufactured in CHINA.,1,1
612,2,4,Compared to a colleagues "made-in Japan" DMC-G2K (purchased through Panasonic Direct), the made-in-China G2K (outwardly) appears somewhat cheapened.,1,1
612,2,5,Instead of paying a hefty restocking fee, I have decided to sell my Chinese-made G2K to another colleague ... at a slight loss.,1,1

615,2,0,I have been taking photos since the '60's and have been using digital cameras since 1997 and currently own a high end Nikon D70 DSLR.,0,0

615,2,2,This works perfectly.,0,0
615,2,3,It is true point and shoot for the beginner, but has the capability for user settings when/if the user advances that far.,0,0
615,2,4,It is not subminiature, but is quite small enough to drop into a pocket, and easily into a purse.,0,0
615,2,5,One big advantage is that it has a focusing light for lowlight pictures.,0,0
615,2,6,Quite a few cameras in this class do not have that, and it is essential unless you never shoot in low light.,0,0
615,2,7,This ensures your low light pictures are always properly in focus.,0,0
615,2,8,The only con is that the screen is pretty small, but since even the largest screens are not really any good for viewing, I don't find it a problem.,1,1
615,2,9,It is more than adequate to check exposure and composition.,1,1
615,2,10,And you can zoom into any section of the picture to check focus.,1,1
615,2,11,I don't find it much of a negative at all, but potential buyers should be aware of this one slight drawback.,1,1

Their own rechargeable batteries don't work with their camera.,1,1
619,2,5,I'm returning this when I get back from vacation.,1,1
619,2,6,At the rate this thing is eating through batteries, I'm out another $30 in AA batteries plus the cost of the charger and Ni-MH batteries.,1,1

622,2,3,I was not looking to get this but when I received a 20% off promo, I checked all other websites to see if the price had dropped and it had not.,0,0
622,2,4,So I jumped on the offer as it was a very good business decision.,0,1
622,2,5,Been playing with it and I made a good choice, a camera that will last tech wise for 5 years.,0,1
622,2,6,The reason for the 1 egg, is because shipping.,1,1
622,2,7,I received the box that was 4 times the size of the product.,1,1
622,2,8,When I picked it up the product inside the box slide till it hit the sidewall.,1,1
622,2,9,I then opened up the box to reviled one 8 inch piece of packing paper (newspaper would have been thicker) so basicly the product was slamming around in this overside non correctly packaged box.,1,1
622,2,10,If this was a cable or other non power or breakable item I would be fine, however a $3500 camera packaged like this, shame on the person and the quality control dept.,1,1
622,2,11,for allowing this, and believe my its not one person that does this, this is the company that allows it to happen.,1,1
622,2,12,I should have known as last year I ordered a hard drive and same thing, big box no packaging.,1,1
622,2,13,I was hoping that it was resolved but I guess not.,1,1
622,2,14,I first made sure the camera was working and so far no issues, I am worried that it might have to go into repair sooner than normal because of the way it was shipped to me.,1,1
623,2,0,We just got this camera a few days ago, best of all, FROM NEWEGG!!,0,1
623,2,1,I wont get into the Canon vs Nikon debate, I've got far too much Canon glass to worry about the grass on the other side of the fence.,0,1

626,2,1,High noise at high ISO, my one and only disappointment.,1,1

630,2,2,format is in quicktime instead of mpeg like described.,1,1
631,2,0,Couldn't decide between the SD630 and FX50 but went for Panasonic and I found it to be very fast, big 3" LCD works great outdoors and indoors, colors are accurate compared to my old Olympus, love the photo software that came with the camera, love the construction and feel of the camera..I don't regret the buy, it was a very good upgrade from my Olympus.,0,0
631,2,1,Noise is the only problem I found to my dislike.,1,1

632,2,6,Wish Panasonic would have packed a bigger memory card (16MB Stock).,1,1

633,2,1,We've had this camera for one month and have used it extensively.,0,0
633,2,2,The software is not particularly intuitive but is not hard to figure out.,0,0

635,2,2,The camera takes great pictures and navigating the included software is simple.,0,1
635,2,3,Every camera should include a basic case.,1,1
635,2,4,Getting a camera out of the box without even a simple plastic and fabric sleeve to keep it safe in is goofy.,1,1
635,2,5,But that isn't a unique problem to this camera.,1,1
636,2,0,Excellent image quality, big LCD.,0,0

637,2,1,Big LCD screen, Tons of preset features that you can just point and shoot, very light and Good price for the feature it offers.,0,0
637,2,2,Battery don't last long if you have LCD on all the time.,1,1
637,2,3,CR-V3 battery that came with it last longer than normal AA battery but very expensive.,1,1
637,2,4,Can't make the camera stay at SHQ mode.,1,1
637,2,5,It will switch back to HQ when shut off the camera (if anybody know how to make it stay at SHQ please let me know).,1,1

638,2,1,I've had this camera for about 6 months now and have put it through it's paces.,0,1
638,2,2,It works wonderfully with the Xd H1Gig card.,0,1
638,2,3,I really would suggest this camera to anyone if you don't want to take the jump to the professional cameras that require the add on lens but still want beautiful shots,0,1
638,2,4,The Optical zoom is only 3X but you can get an add on lens to add another 1.7 zoom.,1,0
638,2,5,Still get decent shots just when you're trying to take pictures of something afar it gets annoying sometimes,1,0
639,2,0,The best part-8MP!!,0,0
639,2,1,The color quality i get out of this camera is amazing, just by point and shoot too!,0,0
639,2,2,I really like that it has a lot of manual settings but i am an amateur so i need to learn more about those settings.,0,0
639,2,3,it is nice and small and it takes images in raw format which is a really superb feature.,0,0
639,2,4,The 3x zoom leaves you wanting more, but fortunately there is an adapter tube yuou can buy and olympus offers some extra lenses but you can buy a different adapter (with the proper threading) and get a lot more options for lenses.,1,1
639,2,5,One thing i do have to give a thumbs down for is in low light well regular house light at night on automatic w/o the flash creates blurry photos, and i'm sure this can be upgraded in the firmware, but i really don't like the onboard flash...which is another good reason that it has a hotshoe and an L brace you can buy for it...onboard flash just seems too contrasty for my likes, maybe if we all email olympus and tell them to upgrade the firmware for the low lighting lol.,1,1
639,2,6,also the xd card is pricey compared to others (thankfully you get one free) you'll probably want a gig card though, i read somewhere that said they were capable of making them up to 8 gigs in the future but you'll pay less for this camera than an 8 gig card...and xd has slow transfer rates.,1,1
640,2,0,I own a digital print shop that specializes in large posters.,0,0

640,2,2,I work with professional images all the time  and it usually requires a lot of time to prep them for large out put.,0,0
640,2,3,To get a camera with the price tag and get a noiseless image that flawlessly up sampled 11x to 257 Mbs and not go soft says everything,0,0
640,2,4,I wish it had a  5x optical zoom.,1,1
640,2,5,But for most people the size of the image will allow them to digitally zoom and crop in their computer.,1,1

641,2,1,The image resolution is excellent.,0,0

643,2,0,This Panasonic Lumix is my sixth.,0,0
643,2,1,I enjoy it more each day that I use it.,0,0
643,2,2,The manual focus, and the zoom range, are both located on the lens barrel.,0,0
643,2,3,They move with superb smoothness adjusting the best optics in the business.,0,0
643,2,4,The proof is in the p[ictures that it takes.,0,0
643,2,5,The image stabilization allows me to take accurate pictures at 1/6 of a second when hand held.,0,0
643,2,6,I also own a tripod, but mostly it stays home.,0,0
643,2,7,The white balance is accurate no matter the light conditons when auto is selected.,0,0
643,2,8,It is sturdy, well built, and the extra weight is purely a plus.,0,0
643,2,9,Love it!,0,0
643,2,10,This camera will be a keeper for many years to come.,0,0
643,2,11,I began with a Cannon Tl. and then moved to a Nikon F-3 many years ago.,0,0

644,2,1,Manual controls.,0,1
644,2,2,Looks and feels like a SLR camera.,0,1
644,2,3,Comparing to an SLR is not a fair comparison because you are getting a product that is a third of the price you would pay for the combination of camera/lenses in the SLR format.,0,1
644,2,4,Also some conveniences of this camera over SLR are that you won't have the problem with dust or carrying a load of lenses to accomplish the same task.,0,1
644,2,5,A variety of settings.,0,1
644,2,6,Lens goes from 2.8 to 11.,0,1
644,2,7,Sensor is small.,1,0
644,2,8,Panasonic put 10 Mpx where there can only go 6 or 7. Maybe in the future they can make the sensor larger but that is almost impossible when you have a 12X Zoom.,1,0
644,2,9,Look at zoom lenses in SLR format that are only a 3X or 4X and when zooming out you get darken corners in your photos.,1,0
644,2,10,Therefore I think the size of the sensor is a trade off for the convenience of having a good powerful zoom lens.,1,0
645,2,0,Very nice looking camera and I love it so far.,0,0
645,2,1,The specs of it are awesome, but most of the reviews online don't give it any justice.,0,0
645,2,2,Anyone giving it lower than 4 or 5 out of 5 stars or lower than a 7 or  8 out of 10 just doesn't know how to use a camera properly.,0,0
645,2,3,10.1 MP, 12x Optical zoom with 21.4x extended zoom, hot shoe for external flash, swivel screen, manual zoom and focus, lens hood, and the flash has excellent range.,0,0
645,2,4,This camera is comfortable to handle and is well built, and easy to use.,0,0
645,2,5,The menus are easy to navigate through and pretty self explanitory.,0,0
645,2,6,The pictures are amazing quality and the zoom, auto-focus, and image stabilization work really well.,0,0
645,2,7,The strap it comes with is fairly thick and doesn't flex well with the stationary strap mounts on the camera.,1,0
646,2,0,Great zoom range and control.,0,0
646,2,1,Gorgeous pictures in bright conditions and highly customizable through manual settings and programs.,0,0
646,2,2,Due to its small (CCD) sensor, pictures in low light are extremely grainy.,1,1
646,2,3,I wish Panasonic would have opted for a larger image sensor rather than pixel-stuffing, but nobody asks what size the sensor is- MP sell cameras.,1,1

647,2,3,Fairly intuiative layout.,0,0
647,2,4,Even at the lowest compression (not Raw) mode the pictures turn out a blurry mess.,1,1
647,2,5,Sized down to a resonable resolution this compression is virtually unnoticable.,1,1
647,2,6,Raw mode eats up a 2gig card pretty quickly.,1,1
648,2,0,12x zoom, saves in RAW, focus rings are nice,0,0
648,2,1,Camera is big!,1,1
648,2,2,The picture quality isn't as good as I expected it to be.,1,1
648,2,3,Even shooting in RAW the pictures then inside are grainy expecially under low light.,1,1

650,2,1,The camera is extremely well built, and all the buttons are place rather nicely.,0,0
650,2,2,Image noise is the biggest talk about this camera, and IMO the noise is not a concern unless you view pictures at 100% on your computer screen.,0,0
650,2,3,Otherwise pictures taken from this camera are well exposed, and sharp.,0,0
650,2,4,The manual zoom is a new thing for me, coming from cameras that require a button push to zoom.,0,0
650,2,5,It's more accurate this way, and makes you not want to go back to button zooming.,0,0
650,2,6,This camera takes advantage too of high-speed SD memory cards, so getting one for this camera should be a must.,0,0
650,2,7,Overall I'm satisfied with this camera, with a 35-420mm zoom at this price range you can't go wrong.,0,0
650,2,8,Highly recommended!,0,0
650,2,9,Camera doesn't come with cord for the lens cap, so you will have to purchase one in order to prevent losing the lens cap.,1,1
651,2,0,Very pleased with the shots I have taken so far.,0,1
651,2,1,Not as bulky and as heavy as some DSLR's.,0,1
651,2,2,Any camera can take good pics outdoors, but the real test is using your macro and taking pics indoors.,0,1
651,2,3,They were great pics!!!,0,1
651,2,4,I have read many good and bad reviews about this camera.,1,0
651,2,5,All I have to say, find me a camera that has all perfect features..

658,2,3,At 65 mph my wife was taking pics during a road trip and they all came out very clear.,0,1
658,2,4,depending on settings you can take pics instantly or with a bit of lag you get a better quality pic.,0,1
658,2,5,For a non-pro i would have to say this camera offers a little bit of everything.,0,1
658,2,6,Battery life wasnt amazing, a fully charged battery last about 2 hours of continuous use i.e. large display being on taking pics here and there.,1,0
658,2,7,Probably better than traditional AA's but wasnt impress by any measure, this doesnt really take away from the overall rating i gave it, just a warning that and investment in an addtional battery isnt a bad idea.,1,0

663,2,7,Manual wasn't as clear for the advanced features.,1,1
663,2,8,As most people have stated, higher ISO settings really degrade picture quality.,1,1
664,2,0,The Online Shop promised:

668,2,0,huge screen, no more lens swapping, real movie mode, tons of scene modes, quick to start, focus and turn off, compositional grids to reduce those crooked shots, image stabilizer to further reduce out of focus shots, sd card goes right into my wii (no sdhc) for slideshows.,0,1
668,2,1,lighter in some of the manual modes but can be compensated for through plentiful supply of scene modes, mic is weak in movie mode and more suited for adding commentary, definitely buy a screen guard, some shots can be overexposed but it's clear in the viewfinder and the exposure button is right there.,1,0
669,2,0,Lots of great features packed into one camera: 10x optical zoom, 28mm wide angle lens, and 3" LCD.,0,0

677,2,8,I really like the "Scene" function that allows you to select from multiple pre-set settings that suit your specific need.,0,0
677,2,9,Really covers many of the popular things people like to take pictures of: portraits, fireworks, starry sky, motion, etc.,0,1
677,2,10,I used a card reader on my old computer to read the pictures because I couldn't figure out how to make Vista x64 work with this camera.,1,1
677,2,11,The drivers that came with it don't really help, so if you have Vista, expect problems.,1,1
677,2,12,Hopefully, they will release some kind of update soon.,1,1
677,2,13,Also many people have complained of no viewfinder... but unless the sun is glaring directly onto the screen, this is generally not an issue; don't know what the fuss is about, I usually use the screen anyway.,1,1
678,2,0,Flawless operation.,0,1

680,2,1,No viewfinder.,1,1

680,2,4,Viewfinders do NOT washout in sun like the LCD screens.,1,1
680,2,5,Most viewfinders have optical adjustments so people with contact lens or glasses can see through them fine.,1,1

688,2,4,There is a 3x optical zoom, and zooms to 12x digitally, and works well at both.,0,1
688,2,5,The image stabilization helps significantly, and even shaking the camera wildly to exaggerate, I got a sharp photo 1 out of 3 times.,0,1
688,2,6,The digital zoom well exceeded my expectations, the detail is sharp, though a bit noisy as expected, it’s gotten much better than my previous experiences.,0,1

696,2,3,Clean the lens contacts".,1,1
696,2,4,This thing is BRAND new, there is no way its dirty, I've checked to ensure its clean and i don't even want to risk trying to clean it yet, I can hear the unit readjusting its self, twitching and even in the view finder the image stutters around.,1,1
696,2,5,I'm forced to turn the camera off and on to get it to connect again to even take a picture.,1,1
696,2,6,But after reading the manual and looking online I'm now sure this was a total dud.,1,1
696,2,7,The other lense has worked fine and its what i've primarily used which is why i didn't get a chance to test this one very much to find this defect.,1,1

697,2,4,Other reviewers.,1,1
697,2,5,If you are rating, you don't take two eggs off because of stock or shipping issues.,1,1
697,2,6,You are trashing the reputation of a brilliant lens for no fault of Canon!,1,1
697,2,7,It is quiet compared to the non-USM equipped lenses, but can be heard.,1,1
697,2,8,Thank G*d I use off-camera mics for video.,1,1
697,2,9,(I can't believe you just made me edit that...)

699,2,2,I own 5 canon lenses and this is by far the sharpest.,0,0
699,2,3,I considered buying the canon 70-200 F/4L and borrowed one but the only advantage I found of the 70-200 was that the focus was slightly faster.,0,0
699,2,4,I took dozens of pictures with both lenses and compaired the two at 100% crop and sometimes the 70-300 was sharper and sometimes the 70-200 was sharper.,0,0
699,2,5,I am by no means trying to knock the 70-200, its an incredible lense and great value.,0,0
699,2,6,In my case I decided to keep the 70-300 even with cost not a factor.,0,0
699,2,7,The 70-300 obviously has the extra 100mm of zoom range, and IS of the 70-300mm vs continous F4 kinda cancled each other out.,0,0
699,2,8,You will not be disappointed with this lense.,0,0
699,2,9,Many of my best photos are with this lense and the shapness is extremely impressive.,0,0
699,2,10,If you are trying to decide between the 70-200 F4L and this lense you cant go wrong either way.,0,0
699,2,11,None that I have found and I have had this lense for two years.,1,0

702,2,0,Long focal length, F-stop that matches the new L-series lens without the added cost.,0,1
702,2,1,Build quality is much better than the cheaper 300mm zooms on offer, plus this one has IS, which is great at the longer range when light is less than optimal (seemingly all the freakin time).,0,1
702,2,2,The focus seems to hunt more than the 18-135mm stock lens on the 60D.,1,1
702,2,3,The front element rotates with focus.,1,1
702,2,4,Images are not nearly as crisp as the 70-300mm f/4-5.6L,1,1

706,2,4,Features and function controls are a PITA to find.,1,1
706,2,5,advanced controls, settings, & menus are NOT intuitive, (took me 5 minutes to figure how to use manual focus, and never did find how to use Digital zoom!).,1,1
706,2,6,The manual included is for basic use only, with no index.,1,1
706,2,7,Supposedly there is a complete manual on the CD-ROM.,1,1

707,2,1,Perfect for those of us who want more than a typical point-and-shoot but don't want to learn all the ins-and-outs of an SLR.,0,0
707,2,2,So far, out of the 500 or so pictures I've taken with the camera, 90% were taken in auto mode with auto flash and face recognition on.,0,0
707,2,3,Pictures look absolutely fantastic.,0,0
707,2,4,Great zoom abilities and I'm very happy with the few macro pics I have taken.,0,0
707,2,5,The LCD is clear and the menu interface is easy to understand and navigate.,0,0
707,2,6,The viewfinder is also impressive and I prefer to use it over the LCD.,0,0
707,2,7,Battery life is better than I expected.,0,0
707,2,8,Took the camera out for a weekend, shot about 150 photos and the battery life still showed over half full.,0,0
707,2,9,I've taken pictures in forests, mountains, beaches, and in the backyard.,0,1
707,2,10,They all look wonderful.,0,1
707,2,11,I've also used the video mode a few times... works very well for taking short clips when a pic just isn't enough.,0,1
707,2,12,Still a learning curve involved.,1,1
707,2,13,There are a lot of modes and I try to use them as required, but honestly Auto mode works great for most situations.,1,1
707,2,14,Some modes, like "twilight", have long lag times as the camera tries to adjust itself.,1,1
707,2,15,The proprietary Sony transfer cable is a little difficult to get connected to the camera port.,1,1
708,2,0,The H7 is a winning combination of the Face sensing technology from Sony's high-end SLR camera series, 8.1 mega pixel, versatility in settings and modes, and ease of use.,0,1
708,2,1,This camera has more versatility than any other digital I have ever owned because it combines high shutter speed shooting and intelligent continuous auto-focusing.,0,1
708,2,2,The lag time is the lowest (meaning its the fastest camera) that I've used.,0,1
708,2,3,It can quickly focus on fast-moving subjects by predicting where those subjects will be in the frame.,0,1
708,2,4,This predictive technology also helps to reduce shutter lag, the time it takes for the camera to focus and shoot.,0,1
708,2,5,The DSC-H7 features powerful Carl Zeiss 15x optical zoom lenses for up-close shots of big plays on the field.,0,1
708,2,6,Sony’s new face detection technology can identify up to eight faces in the camera’s LCD frame, and automatically adjust white balance and flash as well as focus and exposure for correctly exposed, sharp photos.,0,1
708,2,7,Proprietary battery (costs $50) instead of AAs.,1,0
708,2,8,Grip is awkward and feels like 1/3 of an SLR is missing.,1,0
708,2,9,ISO above 400 produces odd colors at fringes.,1,0
709,2,0,Awesome camera.,0,0
709,2,1,I had used other people's SLR cameras and fell in love with them.,0,0
709,2,2,I never had the opportunity to grab my own until this company (through Newegg) put the SL1 on sale for $479.,0,0
709,2,3,I had my heart set on Canon since that's the only brand I've ever owned.,0,0
709,2,4,I already had a tripod, bag, and cleaning tools.,0,0
709,2,5,This camera has everything I expected and more.,0,0
709,2,6,I'm learning new things everyday, and I love all the custom settings - and there are a TON.,0,0
709,2,7,Even out of the box, your shots will be ten times better than they ever were.,0,0
709,2,8,Love the presets, and the ability to adjust the settings under them.,0,0
709,2,9,Great 3" screen that is very crisp and detailed.,0,0
709,2,10,I still mistakenly use the buttons sometimes to navigate, forgetting it's a touchscreen.,0,0
709,2,11,Solid neck strap, great lens cover, and the battery charges very quickly.,0,0
709,2,12,Overall a great purchase, but for the price - I just could not pass it up!,0,0
709,2,13,This isn't really a con, but if you're used to using the camera on your phone or a point-and-shoot, be ready for a steep learning curve because this is a professional camera.,1,1
710,2,0,- Easy to grip despite the small size, plus the light weight is nice if you are someone who carries a lot of things around
- Awesome pictures (quality kicks ***) + the 18-55mm lens that comes with it is great for starting
- Auto focus is exceptional, but I find myself using MF frequently anyways
- Kicks *** in light areas, does an exceptional job in low light areas
- White balance options are kewlsies
- Records video at 60 FPS which is a great feature if you want to slow down footage,0,0
710,2,1,- Battery life is not that long (about 3-4 hours), had to buy an extra 2 batteries.,1,1
710,2,2,Battery drains quickly ESPECIALLY when filming.
- Uhh.. idk can't really think of anything else, it does what it camera does!,1,1
711,2,0,This Camera does everything that I need it to do and that is take perfect shots.,0,0
711,2,1,Also being able to swap out lenses here and there is a plus.,0,0
711,2,2,its a sweet piece of work that has good craftsmanship.,0,0
711,2,3,the design is perfect fitting in your hands where it needs to go comfortable.,0,0
711,2,4,its fast to take pictures and accurate as the photographer using it.,0,0
711,2,5,I have no cons,1,0
712,2,0,I purchased this to shoot interviews and green screen movies in HD, i.e. not a lot of movement and fixed focal length.,0,1
712,2,1,It’s light, as far as DSLR’s go and the focus motors are dead quiet.,0,1
712,2,2,One thing I did not know when getting this is that it does not have a motorized zoom i.e. you have to twist the adjustment on the lens.,0,1
712,2,3,The auxiliary audio input works great.,0,1
712,2,4,I am using it with a wireless Sony mic and it is nice and clear.,0,1
712,2,5,I also use the HDMI out to go to a LCD monitor while shooting and that works well also.,0,1
712,2,6,It displays the live feed coming from the camera and also around the edge of the frame it displays the modes and settings you are using.,0,1
712,2,7,The only thing that is not so great is the auto focus.,0,1
712,2,8,It easily gets confused if someone turns away from the camera.,0,1
712,2,9,To resolve this I focus the camera before shooting then switch to manual focus.,0,1
712,2,10,This is just a switch on the lens.,0,1
712,2,11,It says it only shoots for about 10 min but it just starts a new file after 10min you can keep shooting.,0,1
712,2,12,i.e. if you shoot for 25mini you wind up with 3 files.,0,1
712,2,13,Auto focus sucks for video, but fine for stills,1,1
713,2,0,Great pictures
Small, but works great for regular sized hands
Canon,0,0
713,2,1,None that I can find within the 1st week,1,1
714,2,0,Excellent image quality.,0,0
714,2,1,Video quality is amazing as well, and the auto-focus is silent when shooting.,0,0
714,2,2,The touchscreen is a great feature; touch a person\object on the screen while in video mode and the camera will track that person as they move around, keeping them in focus.,0,0
715,2,0,Takes very nice pictures, took grand-kids out to state park got some really nice shots.,0,0
715,2,1,Easy to use in the auto modes, just stating to learn some of the more manual operations.,0,0
715,2,2,This really is not a con because I was aware that it would take me some time and use to learn but many many options.,1,0
716,2,0,This is the best full frame camera for the money.,0,0
716,2,1,It's been out for quite sometime now and it still holds up very well with the new ones that just came out this year.,0,0
716,2,2,21 MP RAW is awesome.,0,0
716,2,3,You can post process the sh*1 out of them.,0,0
716,2,4,Has very good low light ISO.,0,0
716,2,5,You can probably shoot up to 1600 ISO with minimal noise.,0,0
716,2,6,Very good build.,0,0
716,2,7,It's weather sealed so you can take pictures in the mother natures elements, but I did hear that it doesn't work too well in the freezing cold.,0,0
716,2,8,Video recording sucks because you can only record 10 minutes.,1,1
716,2,9,Auto focus can be slow at times.,1,1
716,2,10,The whole auto focusing system is out of date.,1,1
716,2,11,File sizes are huge.,1,1
716,2,12,You'll need to buy an extra hard drive or 2 to store your images.,1,1
716,2,13,It has slow burst speed of only 3.9 fps so this camera is not that good for action shots.,1,1
717,2,0,excellent image quality!,0,0
717,2,1,shutter sounds nice :), upgrading from a 5Dc and its really worth it!,0,0
717,2,2,full frame is the only way to go on image quality and dynamic range, colors are crisp and pictures sharp!,0,0
717,2,3,video is a plus but really haven't tried it that much, I'm an event and wedding photographer for 4 years now and getting this one will also be a plus on me :),0,0
718,2,0,Great camera, great pictures.,0,0
718,2,1,Slow shipping, package with case and memory card is a joke.,1,1
719,2,0,Built for use!  150,000 click shutter, powder coated magnesium body, weather resistant seals, a batter that goes and goes and goes and goes, sits in the hand like it was molded specifically for me!,0,0
719,2,1,Image quality is unreal!,0,0
719,2,2,This thing resolves like a Medium Format camera with the right lenses and a knowledgeable photographer!,0,0
719,2,3,The detail is insane compared to my 7d and xxd series bodies.,0,0
719,2,4,It's true!,0,0
719,2,5,You can shoot at 1600 all day, and 3200 and even 6400 when you need to and still get superb resolution and very manageable noise.,0,0
719,2,6,Get to know RAW if you are serious, but what this thing can do with almost no available light is incredible.,0,0
719,2,7,It's not as fast as my 7D.,1,1
719,2,8,The focusing system is not up to the standard my 7D set.,1,1
719,2,9,The center point is great though.,1,1
719,2,10,Focus points always visible in the viewfinder.,1,1
719,2,11,i bet we'll see a mark 3 with the focusing system and advanced features from the 7D

Price.,1,1
719,2,12,Canon definitely wants only serious photographers to have this kind of image performance.,1,1
719,2,13,For my work, it's ideal though.,1,1
720,2,0,At $2000 this full frame Canon camera body rocks.,0,0
720,2,1,Fantastic resolution and ease of use.,0,0
720,2,2,Heavy to shoot with all day.,1,1
721,2,0,Image quality is the best available in the DSLR form.,0,1
721,2,1,Downsize the 21mp images to the same smaller size as the 12mp Nikon D700/D3 and you get lower image noise.,0,1
721,2,2,Same noise levels as the Nikon D3S with better color, tone and sharpness.,0,1
721,2,3,The included DPP software is THE raw image converter.,0,1
721,2,4,Combined with the Canon lens line; you have the DSLR winner for overall image quality.,0,1
721,2,5,Wish features included Auto ISO parameter controls, dual CF/SD card slots.,1,0
722,2,0,- Great controls (though switching from Nikon to Canon DSLR's I found myself fumbling with some of the toggle wheels until their use became habitual).,0,0
722,2,1,- Excellent build quality; very sturdy; for a high tech piece of electronics, it can stand quite a beating

- Great support community out there (whether through Canon or the civilian/professional community)

- Superb footage for such a (relatively!),0,0
722,2,2,cheap camera

- Premiere Pro CS5 (and others) now allow straight editing of the h.264 codec so no downtime for changing file types,0,0
722,2,3,- Poor audio quality (high automatic gain)

- I shoot video, and yes this is a DSLR, so it's not exactly built for the ergonomics of filming, so extra accessories are highly recommended

- You'll need to spend about as much on your lens (or two) as you did on the body alone...no point in putting so-so glass on such a spectacular piece of equipment

- No 60p recording; h.264 codec leaves something to be desired (great having a full sensor, but the codec can really take away from that) SOMEHOW, SOMEWHERE, I hope someone can rewrite the firmware so that RAW data can be streamed from the camera.,1,1
722,2,4,which brings me to my next point

- No RAW footage and no 1080p HDMI out for external monitor,1,1
723,2,0,Full frame, full sized sensor.,0,1

723,2,10,Sensor sensitive in low light.,0,1
723,2,11,Weather resistant, has good weather sealing.,0,0
723,2,12,Expensive, but worth it.,1,0
723,2,13,Heavy.,1,0
723,2,14,Can't use EF-S lenses,1,0
724,2,0,This is a robust solidly built camera and the quality shows.,0,0
724,2,1,It's also a weather resistant (NOT weatherproof) camera so you can use it in bad weather provided you use the appropriate 'L' lens with it.,0,0
724,2,2,Focusing is fast and accurate.,0,0
724,2,3,Also the camera menus is very easy to learn.,0,0
724,2,4,Since it is robust and solid, it's on the heavy side compared to the polycarbonate bodied cameras such as the 60D.,1,1
724,2,5,If you use this camera with an 'L' lens be prepared because it really gets heavy.,1,1
724,2,6,Depending on your stamina hiking with this lens will be a bit difficult in the long run.,1,1
725,2,0,I normally shoot with my Canon 5D for important stuff and have an assortment of "L" lenses.,0,1
725,2,1,But when I want a low noise, pocketable compact for casual shots, the F31 is without peer.,0,1
725,2,2,It is noise free up to ISO 400, very usable at 800 and acceptable at 1600 for small prints at 4x6.,0,1
725,2,3,Don't bother with 3200.,0,1
725,2,4,The battery last for 580 shots on one charge!,0,1
725,2,5,And the lens is ultra sharp from corner to corner.,0,0
725,2,6,And the flash has the unique ability to "throttle down" so that subjects close to the camera don't get washed out by the flash in the auto modes.,0,0
725,2,7,The semi-manual Aperture and Time Value controls are nice for those who enjoy more control as found on dSLRs.,0,1
725,2,8,But there is no true Manual or M setting for both aperture and shutter speed together.,0,1
725,2,9,Many dSLR owners have this or the Fuji F30 in their coat pockets.,0,1
725,2,10,Trust me...it is THAT good.,0,1
725,2,11,Fuji will probably replace this with an 8 Megapixel chip which will never be as low noise as the sensor in the F31.,0,1
725,2,12,I wish the lens was wider than 36mm at the short end.,1,0
725,2,13,28 would have been perfect.,1,0
725,2,14,The menu system is not very as user friendly as those of Canon and Panasonic but is much improved from my Fuji F10.,1,0
725,2,15,The XD cards are limited to 2 Gigs and are more expensive in general and slower then similar capacity SD or CF cards.,1,0
725,2,16,The newer F40 can take SD as well as xD but is NOT a replacement for the F31 as it doesn't have manual controls.,1,0
725,2,17,And it lacks image stabilization which is now availble in most cameras from Canon, Nikon and Panasonic.,1,0
725,2,18,But the high ISO clean pics make up for it.,1,0
726,2,0,I'm not a fuji fan, but I just checked the dpreview review and this thing made the c**non camera look like a blurry toy!,0,1
726,2,1,xD card.,1,0
726,2,2,really a show-stopper for some people.,1,0
727,2,0,I've had this little jewel since early this year and have had the pleasure of using it for all sorts of things.,0,0
727,2,1,At college I found out in the lab it will even take a great picture through the microscope eyepiece!,0,0
727,2,2,The photos are so clear even when enlarged 8x in a photo program they're amazing.,0,0
727,2,3,The only thing that bugs me is that you have to keep changing the AA batteries.,1,1
727,2,4,Face it each photo averages 1.5MP which = a very clear picture!,1,1
727,2,5,Easy to change!,1,1
728,2,0,Great camera the family all uses it, and they all love it.,0,0
728,2,1,Takes killer pictures.,0,1
728,2,2,Hard on batteries, invest in rechargeable batteries.,1,1
728,2,3,Doesn't hold many pictures if you use the higher image settings.,1,1
728,2,4,But hey, I guess that's to be expected from a digital camera, right ?,1,1
729,2,0,Excellent Camera - easy to use - takes great pictures.,0,0
729,2,1,Small and easy to carry in your shirt pocket.,0,0
729,2,2,Might want to purchase the Olympus XD 1 GB Picture card ($25 from Newegg).,0,0
729,2,3,Uses 2 AA batteries which is a definite plus.,0,0
729,2,4,None -- great camera for the price.,1,0
730,2,0,looks nice,0,0
730,2,1,picture quality not as great as i thought 7mp would make.,1,0
730,2,2,also pictures just seem blurry sometimes.,1,0
731,2,0,I love the simplicity of the plug and play interface with my Windows XP Operating System.,0,0
731,2,1,The camera has excellent features.,0,0

731,2,4,You must feed the beast's insatiable appetite for batteries.,1,1
731,2,5,A small price to pay for the quality of the pictures though.,1,1
732,2,0,Bought this camera to do quick pix of work we do at our shop for both posting on the internet and to print out photos clients send us.,0,1
732,2,1,Easy to use, easy to set up, intuitive menus, make this a nice basic point and shoot digital.,0,1
733,2,0,Good price for what you get.,0,1
733,2,1,Takes nice pictures.,0,0
733,2,2,The onboard memory is a joke, you can take less than ten good quality pics before it's full.,1,0
733,2,3,Get the 1 gig card for it, that what I did and now I can take several hundred of the best quality pics.,1,0
733,2,4,Also the battery life sucks, either get some rechargeables or get a lot of throwaways because you will go through them in no time flat.,1,0
734,2,0,Small size, and easy to use.,0,1
734,2,1,I had a Kodak DC5000, that this is replacing, and the pictures are 100% better, even at the low quality settings.,0,1
734,2,2,12MB internal memory.,1,0
734,2,3,You will DEFINATELY need an XD card.,1,0
734,2,4,Video quality is not that great, but I wasn't expecting it to be.,1,0
735,2,0,Quality images and easy to use.,0,0
735,2,1,I loved the camera design etc., until I actually used it!,1,1
735,2,2,It came with 2 AA batteries that were literally dead in 5 minutes!,1,1
735,2,3,So I used my digital camera rechargable batteries that I used on my prior came without fail only to have the life sucked clean out of those in under 10 minutes!,1,1
735,2,4,Buying new batteries are not even worth having this camera!,1,1
736,2,0,Takes decent pictures.,0,0
736,2,1,Battery life is Terrible!,1,1
736,2,2,I got about 8 to 10 pictures taken and the batteries died!,1,1
736,2,3,FujiFilm suggested rechargeable batteries no lower than 2500mAh.,1,1
737,2,0,Not sure of the differences between the 9000 and the 9100, but I'm sure it's small.,0,1
737,2,1,Unbelievable camera for the price.,0,1
737,2,2,The image quality is wonderful compared to the Canon Rebel EOS 8mp that my friend owns.,0,1
737,2,3,We just went on a trip to Ireland, and lots of my pics turned out better than his!,0,1
737,2,4,Takes some getting used to with the blur you get in photos, especially if you are new to photography.,1,0
737,2,5,This is eliminated when you familiarize yourself with the settings.,1,0
737,2,6,I was able to take some shots of a beautiful waterfall, giving it that flowing water effect, without any filter lenses just by slowing the shutter speed and hiking the f-stops up to 10. wish I could upload the pic!,1,0
737,2,7,The lens is actually pretty good for feeling a little light, but the body makes up for it tremendously.,1,0
737,2,8,It's more or less feels like the Canon in the hand.,1,0
738,2,0,I finally choose this camera.,0,1
738,2,1,And I am not disappointed at all!,0,1
738,2,2,I went into a dark room (about 9 pm) at night and just with the moonlight coming in took a photo with the flash!,0,1
738,2,3,You couldnt even tell it was dark in the room!,0,1

740,2,8,Macro and super macro is a real strong point for this camera,close ups of flowers give a true color and extreme detail that is amazing.,0,0
740,2,9,With a 4gb CF card, over 900 pics at the highest setting.,0,0
740,2,10,A little slow to focus in low light, but still better than most.,1,1
740,2,11,A little noisy in iso 800/1600.,1,1
740,2,12,Like all digital cameras you need a steady hand or tripod in low iso.,1,1

Very fast focusing in good light
Clear and bright EVF.,0,0

742,2,0,Without reservation, it is the best digital camera I have owned.,0,0
742,2,1,The mechanical zoom is a huge plus.,0,0

743,2,1,Max @ ISO-1600
Many cameras on the market sold today Ship with Un-Natural Amounts of HIGH Color Saturation & Un-Natural Amounts of HIGH Contrast & HIGH Sharpness - As Default Setting )
This makes for good "Eye Candy" straight out of the Camera but places Stiff Limitations on what can be done in Post Processing... Which is Where MOST of the PROs live.,0,1
743,2,2,These can be Pumped Up inside the S9100 ALSO but Fuji - Wisely ( imho ) sets these to Normal or UnBiased by Default...,0,1

745,2,5,I finally gave up and was unable to take any picture of the spider that was worth keeping.,1,1
745,2,6,Since the spider is so small you need to be close and the further you get the smaller the spider got.,1,1

791,2,10,(not a bad thing) just make sure you have quicktime to view.,1,1
791,2,11,HD mode is nice, but in low light environment despite the mode you're in, you'll have alot of "visual noise" in video to compensate for lack of light (high light situations are amazing though).,1,1
791,2,12,HD mode quality is amazing, but the performance feels lacking, I can definitely detect video lag when panning the camera quickly in HD mode.,1,1
791,2,13,Needed to buy the lithion battery charger and 2 high powered packs from e.ba.y - (only 20 bucks but still) would have been nice to come with the camera.,1,1
792,2,0,The zoom goes far beyond what I could of even imagined(plus very clear for being so far), great image stabilizer, clear & crisp pictures, only takes 2 AA batteries, easy to use, easy to carry.,0,0
792,2,1,No cons soo far & I don't believe there will really ever be one.,1,1
793,2,0,Takes great outdoor shots.,0,0
793,2,1,Cheap for 10MP cam.,0,0
793,2,2,kodak in general.,1,1

794,2,7,Oh, and of course I got it a day early, only 2 days of waiting!,0,0
794,2,8,That's what I love about Newegg.,0,0
794,2,9,Bit slow coming on, and processing, but I'm not a Pro, so it's fine for me.,1,1
794,2,10,Not any real cons I can think of.,1,1
795,2,0,Quick reaction time, as one should expect from an SLR-like camera.,0,0

795,2,2,Feels professional.,0,0
795,2,3,Superb video, excellent image quality.,0,0
795,2,4,Macro mode isn't as good as Olyumpus.,1,1
795,2,5,Needed more file options, particularly uncompressed format like .tiff.,1,1
795,2,6,Had a peculiar problem converting the Quicktime.,1,1
795,2,7,Only comes with a proprietary disposable camera battery, rather than the Li-Ion/charger kit common today, will add an extra $35 down the road.,1,1
796,2,0,Love this camera, such good quality!,0,0
796,2,1,Wifi destroys battery life,1,1
797,2,0,Good build quality, incredibly compact format, intuitive and easy to use.,0,0
797,2,1,There's nothing a GoPro does that can't be found in another camera somewhere, but everything's just put together exceedingly well for the price point.,0,0
797,2,2,The adhesive pad mounting points that come with this will probably rip the plastic off your helmet/dashboard before they come loose, though I don't know how well it'll hold up in the sun in a hot car.,0,0
797,2,3,I wish there were more picture resolution options, particularly for the time lapse.,1,0
797,2,4,At the only-resolution-available ~2MB a picture, it fills up a 64gb card inconveniently fast for serious cross-country-drive time-lapses.,1,0
798,2,0,Comes with all the items you need to capture amazing videos.,0,0
798,2,1,I used a lot of the 2.7K 30fps video on a trip to Hawaii and it handled sand, water, rocks, and mud perfectly well.,0,0
798,2,2,The quality of the video and photos is very good too.,0,0
798,2,3,It's a great way to capture experiences that you wouldn't dare subject your DSLR or other camera to.,0,0
798,2,4,Battery does not last long.,1,1
798,2,5,You will want to buy some extra batteries and a charger.,1,1

799,2,1,I recently put my GoPro thru its paces on a long fishing trip and walk along a hiking trail (nature trail) and it captured excellent quality video the whole time I had it turned on!,0,0
799,2,2,I really enjoy this camera and look forward to using it a LOT more!,0,0
799,2,3,No cons what so ever!,1,0

800,2,0,Versatile, fast, creative, unbelievable image and video capture.,0,1
800,2,1,Easy to operate.,0,1
800,2,2,No ends to the ability to create exiting content.,0,1
800,2,3,Created great videos right out of the box.,0,1
800,2,4,No experience required.,0,1
800,2,5,Easier than a standard SLR.,0,1
800,2,6,Battery life is a little to short.,1,0
800,2,7,Most venue it is probably fine mine use requires a longer operating life.,1,0
801,2,0,I was very excited to get a GoPro as I wanted a small camera to take places and also use for recording guitar lessons, being able to attach it to the headstock of a guitar and get a shot down the guitar fretboard.,0,0
801,2,1,The camera is small.,0,0
801,2,2,And when you order accessories, it seems everyone sends you lots of clear cases to put the camera into.,0,0
801,2,3,The video quality is very good, although the outer edges are distorted.,0,0
801,2,4,This may be nice on a surf video, but if you're documenting anything for accuracy, it will leave you disappointed.,0,0
801,2,5,The price of the camera itself is good.,0,1
801,2,6,It's all the accessories you need to buy to make it useful that adds up.,0,1
801,2,7,Here's where I have issues with the GoPro.,1,1
801,2,8,Right off the bat, there is no viewfinder so if you want to see what you're recording you need to purchase the optional viewfinder.,1,1
801,2,9,The camera operates VERY HOT.,1,1
801,2,10,You will not want to hold it in your hands, let alone stick it in your pocket without a plastic cover.,1,1
801,2,11,Thus, you must put it in a plastic cover (included with camera), but that adds a lot of bulk to the camera, so now it doesn't fit in my pocket.,1,1
801,2,12,So for handheld, discreet filming, this isn't a good choice.,1,1
801,2,13,The old CISCO cameras, FLIP, ere really good at tossing in a pocket and staying cool, but they are not available anymore.,1,1
801,2,14,The distortion on the edge of the image is very noticeable.,1,1
801,2,15,If you are a picture fanatic like me, this will likely bother you.,1,1
801,2,16,The camera takes some getting used to to operate.,1,1
801,2,17,And the buttons to film are so sensitive I have filmed the inside of my jacket or pocket many times, arriving to a place I want to film only to find that the battery is dead and the Micro SD card is filled.,1,1
801,2,18,To get the real value of the camera you must buy accessories.,1,1
801,2,19,Plan on purchasing a viewfinder, a spare battery, at least two clips, a battery charger, and then a case to put all these accessories in.,1,1
801,2,20,The sound is not great and if you put the optional viewfinder and case on it, the sound is downright terrible.,1,1
802,2,0,I was looking for a camera body to invest in as an initial foray into photography.,0,1
802,2,1,I had used point and shoots before but was never satisfied with the noise they often had.,0,1
802,2,2,The Nikon D5500 was as pricey as I was looking to go for something to learn on and I have to say that I'm not disappointed I bought it.,0,1
802,2,3,The images that it produces are crisp and visually match what I'm viewing with my naked eyes.,0,1
802,2,4,It also cycles quickly which means I can shoot a quick succession of shots without having to worry about the buffer being filled mid series (though I'm sure the class 10 card I'm using helps).,0,1
802,2,5,It's a fairly light body, somewhere around 1lb and has good ergonomics for my hands.,0,0
802,2,6,It never feels like it's going to slip and my fingers aren't cramped.,0,0
802,2,7,The TTL metering is done well, with it being spot on in most shots.,0,1
802,2,8,There are situations where it can be wrong for what you're trying to do with a certain subject but I've read that is a common occurrence with custom style shots.,0,1
802,2,9,I haven't found any real cons just yet, I've only logged 20 hours on it in the month or so I've had it.,1,0
802,2,10,My only real dislike thus far is the button placement.,1,0
802,2,11,On this body the function button is on the left side near the flash button.,1,0
802,2,12,This might not be an issue depending on taste but I have it set to allow for ISO control via the control wheel and would have prefered it be placed around the aperture, shutter release and command wheel cluster.,1,0
802,2,13,It isn't a massive problem, just a slight inconvenience with how I hold the camera when shooting.,1,0
803,2,0,It's Christmas Day...turned on the movie mode to get some footage of my 3-month old grandson and his first Christmas and the camera went nuts.,1,1
803,2,1,Fragmented LCD viewer...purple bands across the screen taking up two-thirds of it.,1,1
803,2,2,I have had it with this Fuji model.,1,1
803,2,3,This time it's going directly back to Fuji.,1,1
804,2,0,Bought for the great zoom and megapixals to replace my lower zoom camera that quit working.,0,0
804,2,1,Great for personal use, can't wait to use it in every way.,0,0
804,2,2,Great camera for the price, beautiful lcd screen, and it can record also.,0,0
804,2,3,Zoom seems great.,0,0
804,2,4,Recommend!!,0,0
804,2,5,No lens cap, requested one from Fuji, np.,1,0
805,2,0,Refurbished product was clean and looked fairly new.,0,1
805,2,1,Gave the camera a thorough work over on taking pictures and the pictures were exceptional.,0,1
805,2,2,The 'SR Auto' that is on the Fuji line is exceptional and for the amatuer gives very good 'point-and-shoot' pictures.,0,1
805,2,3,The HD video was superb shown on my 1080p monitor.,0,1
805,2,4,The 28x zoom on the camera takes nice pictures once you really steady the camera and get your hand shakes eliminated.,0,1
805,2,5,I took one of someone about 30-40' away and looked like I was right next to them.,0,1
805,2,6,The 'macro mode' on this camera just about gave me the fingerprints on the item (I thought there was a smudge on the lens).,0,1
805,2,7,I have relied on Fuji for quality digital pictures because of the quality of their lens.,0,1
805,2,8,Bare bones refurbished product.,1,0
805,2,9,No lens cap, no manual (just provided on the CD and have to print it out).,1,0
805,2,10,I understood this when purchased because it was stated.,1,0
806,2,0,This is now the third S3400 I have received and this time it functions perfectly!!!!
Zoom is nice and smooth...no internal rattling...pictures are sharp...(as sharp as digital pictures go)...you still have to tweak them.,0,0
806,2,1,I use Corel's PaintShop Pro Ultimate X3 to bring them up to film camera quality.,0,0
806,2,2,The camera is a little on the large size so it's heavier then my S700 but thats a good thing.,0,0
806,2,3,The LCD screen is large and color, contrast and brightness are excellent!,0,0
806,2,4,The lens cap was shipped seperatly by Fuji at no cost!,0,0
806,2,5,Low light video is grainy and the camera has a hard time focusing in that situation but video is nice in normal lighting scenarios.,1,1
806,2,6,You still don't get an owners manual but Fuji says if you want one to contact them and they will ship you one...usually at no cost.,1,1
806,2,7,An owners manual is supplied on the software disc you receive with the camera but printing it out can be costly as well as being very large (8.5"x11") .,1,1
806,2,8,Who wants to carry that around with the camera??,1,1
807,2,0,Seems solid enough at this point-in-time, bought this unit to replace my S1500 Fuji.,0,1
807,2,1,Am satisfied with the Panorama feature, it appears to work as slated most of the time,0,1
807,2,2,NO LENS CAP,1,0
808,2,0,This one does not rattle...a definite pro!
Good solid frame...large...easy to handle and beautiful 3-inch LCD screen.,0,0
808,2,1,Takes excellent, sharp photos in macro mode.,0,0
808,2,2,Has an EVF (electronic view finder) which is very helpful when using the LCD is not desireable.,0,0
808,2,3,Using the EVF helps to eliminate camera shake.,0,0
808,2,4,Uses AA batteries...a definite advantage over proprietary Li-Ion batteries.,0,0
808,2,5,I used to use good alkalines but have gone to high capacity MNHi, rechargeables.,0,0
808,2,6,Much cheaper in the long run to use.,0,0
808,2,7,NewEgg as always, replaced the defective one fast with shipping at their expense both ways!,0,0
808,2,8,Like the original one, this replacement did not come with a lens cap!!,1,1
808,2,9,All Fuji cameras come with lens caps so I don't know what's going on here!!!!!
Zoom function is still a little clunky but nowhere near as bad as the original.,1,1
809,2,0,No Pros at this time...see below.,0,1
809,2,1,Recieved today...
1: Just thrown in it's factory box wrapped in thin cellophane...no protective foam anywhere!,1,1
809,2,2,2: Something is loose inside...when you shake the camera gently you can hear it rattle.,1,1
809,2,3,3:The lenses make clunking noises when zooming in or out.,1,1
809,2,4,4: No lens cap, lens cap tether cord, owners manual or batteries were included like they should be.,1,1
809,2,5,This is definitly not the standard of quality Fujifilm is known for.,1,1
809,2,6,I own the S700 model which has been perfect since day one, have used it extensively for a number of years, and was hoping to upgrade to a higher resolution model camera but this particular one is highly disappointing.,1,1
809,2,7,I have been issued a RMA for it and hope the replacement has the quality Fujifilm is normally proud of.,1,1
810,2,0,Easy to use and takes great pictures.,0,0
810,2,1,Very disappointed.,1,1
810,2,2,My daughter had this camera for less than a year, approx 10 months, and it now does not turn on anymore.,1,1
810,2,3,She called the help line to troubleshoot problems and was directed on how to reset it.,1,1
810,2,4,However, that did not work.,1,1
810,2,5,Paid approx $99 for the camera and the replacement warranty is $10 cheaper.,1,1
810,2,6,I didn't get the replacement warranty because of the added expense.,1,1
810,2,7,I now know that if a replacement warranty is going to cost that much the company doesn't have faith in their product.,1,1
810,2,8,My daughter googled the issues with the camera and found others with the same problem.,1,1
811,2,0,Reasonable price, decent pictures, decent zoom, decent manual options, pretty good battery life.,0,1
811,2,1,Manual under/over-exposure control (which helps balance some of the cons).,0,1
811,2,2,Slow lens; camera needs tons of light or a sloooow shutter speed to operate well.,1,0
811,2,3,Automatic settings only really do well in bright daylight, or with the flash enabled (which is tied to the slow lens).,1,0
811,2,4,Instructing the camera to under-expose by 2/3 a stop generally allows enough leeway to take reasonable natural-light-only shots indoors and outdoors (in less-than-full-sun daytime weather), but requires some post-processing work.,1,0
811,2,5,No RAW shooting.,1,0
812,2,0,So far it's been a great tv I also have been using it as a monitor and it has great quality and is in great shape for a refurbished product.,0,0
812,2,1,Did have a small broken part on the stand but it did not effect anything at all and seeing as I'm not going to use the stand no big woof.,1,1
812,2,2,Also I do wish there were a few more options when it comes to screen resolution and hooking it up to a computer.,1,1
813,2,0,Decent enough videos, quick recovery time while taking still images compared to our digital camera purchased in 2005, light weight.,0,1
813,2,1,Horrible quality to pictures.,1,1
813,2,2,Grainy, dead appearance to pictures - whether taken indoors, outdoors - bright and sunny - with the flash it doesn't matter.,1,1
813,2,3,We have our older model Canon powershot A520 camera purchased years ago that takes much crisper pictures with less noise than this camera.,1,1
814,2,0,The reason I purchased this camera is that it has a view finder.,0,1
814,2,1,There are no other inexpensive cameras that have one that I could find.,0,1
814,2,2,A view finder is a great asset and it is too bad the manufacturers have been leaving it out.,0,1
814,2,3,Great price ($79) and the quality of the photos is what you would expect from a point and shoot.,0,1
814,2,4,For those who want to use the extensive features take a look at the manual that is on the CD or download it from Canon.,0,1
814,2,5,The printed manual has  around 50 pages the PDF version has 150 pages.,0,1
814,2,6,The recycle time for the flash is a little slow which effects time between shots.,1,0
815,2,0,4x Optical zoom, Viewfinder, simple controls, very reasonable price.,0,0
815,2,1,In low light settings I noticed that the picture seemed grainy on the LCD, but fortunatly didn't show up in the photo.,1,1
816,2,0,Has a viewfinder, uses 2-AA batteries, nice size for handling.,0,0
816,2,1,Fairly inexpensive.,0,0
816,2,2,A nice looking camera.,0,0
816,2,3,Below average image quality, lacks sharpness, pictures tend to be grainy at ISO above 80.,1,1
816,2,4,Colors a bit washed out.,1,1
816,2,5,Even the LCD display is pretty grainy to look at while composing a picture, and not very pleasing.,1,1
817,2,0,The camera itself takes nice pictures, the colors are great and the resolution is excellent.,0,0
817,2,1,Small and fits in one's pocket.,0,0
817,2,2,Most of the features are automatic which is good for those who don't know much about photography but still want nice pictures.,0,0
817,2,3,I already bought three of these cameras.,0,0
817,2,4,Fast enough for a point and shoot camera.,0,0
817,2,5,Cheap!,0,0
817,2,6,Plastic body makes it look a little cheap and seems not very compatible with the excellent performances.,1,0
817,2,7,Limited settings and one has to rely mostly on automatic setting.,1,1

820,2,2,The response time of the shutter is awful.,1,1
820,2,3,When you press the button it takes forever to snap the picture, sometimes you have to hold the button a couple of times for it to take the picture.,1,1
820,2,4,It is very light and cheapy feeling.,1,1
821,2,0,Light, no need for AA batteries and such.,0,0
821,2,1,Comes with recharger.,0,0
821,2,2,Various colors to choose from?!,0,1
821,2,3,The picture quality on this camera is terrible.,1,1
821,2,4,It claims to be 16mp but that just can't be true.,1,1
821,2,5,I compared my old 6mp camera to this one and could not see a single difference in image quality.,1,1
821,2,6,The zoom is terrible as well.,1,1
821,2,7,If you try to zoom and take a picture, the only thing you'll get is a blurry picture.,1,1

825,2,0,1) decent picture quality, 5x optical zoom, good color reproduction
2) AA battery support
3) SDHC support
4) SD card slot has own separate door 
5) user-friendly menus
6) many scene modes, interesting stitched-panoramic picture mode,0,1
825,2,1,1) horrible (!!!) battery life (see below)
2) too thick to stick in pant pockets
3) no RAW picture mode, very little control over image compression
4) not little manual control for all but the most novice users

Now, coming to my main gripe:

This camera is a power hog, to the point that it is almost useless with NiMH.,1,1
825,2,2,Using various NiMH batteries (2000-2600 NiMH) will discharge in the camera within 2-3 days, even if simply stored and no pictures are taken.,1,1
825,2,3,If I take approximately 20 pictures on a fully charged NiMH set and then leave the camera alone ... within hours (approximately 8-10 hours), the batteries will have been depleted.,1,1
825,2,4,If taking pictures, you cannot get more than about 50 pictures per fully charged NiMH set.,1,1
825,2,5,On forums, it appears that this is a very common complaint.,1,1
825,2,6,Apparently, Kodak doesn't consider this to be a problem and their solution is for consumers to buy the expensive CRV-3 or even more expensive Kodak KLIC (rechargeable Li-ion) battery set,1,1
826,2,0,Great pictures, large LCD screen.,0,0
826,2,1,I made the mistake of buying this camera sight unseen and without reading the reviews.,0,0
826,2,2,First, the good:  takes wonderful pictures.,0,0
826,2,3,I had an olympus 3.2mp 10x optical zoom camera.,0,0
826,2,4,this one beats it in all modes I've tried including the super macro setting for ultra close ups.,0,0
826,2,5,It takes 2 AA batteries.,1,1
826,2,6,Nope, rechargeable Nimh won't work.,1,1
826,2,7,Not even the high capacity ones; too much power draw.,1,1
826,2,8,Yeah, the $2 each AA lithium battery.,1,1
826,2,9,The reason it eats them is the large LCD display on the back is the ONLY way to take a picture; there is no viewfinder.,1,1
826,2,10,The LCD washes out easily in moderate or brighter sunlight.,1,1
826,2,11,Second, the delay time to store the picture is ridiculous.,1,1
826,2,12,I’ve tried faster SD cards to no avail.,1,1
826,2,13,If you want to take more than 3 pictures within 10 seconds (count to 10; it’s a long time…), this is not your camera.,1,1
827,2,0,Great picture quality, very flexible, decent video options, high zoom, cheap.,0,0
827,2,1,The few quarks I've had don't constitute removing an egg.,1,1
827,2,2,It doesn't have a viewfinder, but I knew that before I got the camera.,1,1
827,2,3,Also, once or twice it's gone through a set of batteries within 30 shots, but I'm guessing its a problem with the batteries rather than the camera.,1,1
827,2,4,Finally, controls are kind of awkward when coming from a Canon camera,1,1
828,2,0,simple to use and light weight great camera fantastic pictures taken when the corrct setings are used .,0,0
828,2,1,I recommend reading the book and following the instruction together works great.,0,0
828,2,2,At first glance it looks cheesy and plastic but when you look clser and pick-up the camera you realize that it is anything but cheap.,1,1
828,2,3,Great value,1,1
829,2,0,It's a lightweight, but also plastic body, relatively small 12X optical zoom camera w/ 8.1mp.,0,0
829,2,1,You have to use the large LCD display to take pictures.,1,1
829,2,2,ALSO, as a result the battery life is ~30 pictures (yes, THIRTY) under normal usage for a NiMh 2350 mah pair of batteries and less than that for name brand, high quality heavy duty alkalines.,1,1
829,2,3,There is NO WAY the single pair of Kodak batteries will keep this thing for 500 shots under normal use.,1,1
830,2,0,This camera takes really nice pictures right out of the box.,0,0
830,2,1,The setup is very easy and the button orientation is very user friendly.,0,0
830,2,2,I especially like the zoom lever location out front.,0,0
830,2,3,This camera adjusts to varied lighting and location conditions with ease.,0,0
830,2,4,The 12x zoom is superb and produces some really amazing details.,0,0
830,2,5,The manual explains the various features nicely.,0,0
830,2,6,The panorama mode is a nice feature and seems to work well for me.,0,0
830,2,7,Overall, this camera will be a nice fit for most users.,0,0
830,2,8,The time it takes to process a pictures seems a little long but that be due to my SD card being a bit slow.,1,1
830,2,9,I'd recommend getting one of the high speed SD cards and try that.,1,1
830,2,10,I've had the camera 'freeze' once when taking a picture.,1,1
830,2,11,Not sure why, but turning it off then on again seemed to remedy the problem.,1,1
831,2,0,Good point and shoot.,0,0
831,2,1,Great price.,0,0
831,2,2,Very light weight.,0,0
831,2,3,Battery cover is a  little flimsy.,1,1

832,2,1,- Takes awful pictures if there is low lighting, even with the flash.,1,1
833,2,0,Price.,0,0
833,2,1,Terrible picture quality.,1,1
833,2,2,I took many pictures in different locations with this camera along with my old 6 megapixel Canon from 2006 to do a side by side comparison and the old one is way better.,1,1
833,2,3,I exchanged this camera twice, so ended up using three of them and all three were terrible.,1,1
833,2,4,I have only owned and bought for my family Canon digital cameras (6-7 of them).,1,1
833,2,5,I'll buy again a Canon, just not this model.,1,1
833,2,6,The colors are saturated and unrealistic.,1,1
833,2,7,At the same time there's an abundance of light in each picture making them look somewhat faded.,1,1
833,2,8,The third thing I noticed is that the pictures look very two dimensional.,1,1
833,2,9,Depth is lost to a great degree compared to my other digital cameras.,1,1
834,2,0,easy to use right out of the box, quick charge, lots of setting options, great pictures, wide angle, lots of megapixels, lots of battery time,0,0
834,2,1,takes a little time to learn all the settings,1,1
835,2,0,It takes great pix and easy to use out of the box.,0,0
835,2,1,Like the LCD screen size and the 5X optical zoom and red eye reduction.,0,0
836,2,0,Purchased for my wife and she is taking super pictures inside and out.,0,0
836,2,1,Focus is prefect.,0,0

836,2,11,Light and small.,0,0
836,2,12,We did have to return the first unit as I did not focus properly and pictures were fuzzy.,1,1
836,2,13,If yours is not focusing properly send it back.,1,1
837,2,0,Light weight and compact.,0,1
837,2,1,The basic functions were easy to figure out before looking at the owner's manual.,0,1
837,2,2,Everything you need to transfer the pictures to your computer.,0,1
837,2,3,The 5x zoom is nice to have, but as expected with that, you need to keep the camera as still as you can to prevent blurred pics.,0,1
837,2,4,I got this with a combo deal ,and saved a few dollars on the combo package.,0,1
837,2,5,The camera is compatible with a variety of memory cards.,0,1
837,2,6,There is a card reader included as is an adapter to work on most wide screen TVs.,0,1
837,2,7,It wasn't free.,1,1
837,2,8,No memory card included.,1,1
837,2,9,It's not worth taking off an egg.,1,1

841,2,3,Outstanding price for the quality.,0,0
841,2,4,Buttons feel a little cheap.,1,1
842,2,0,I bought this camera for my employee's to photograph offending vehicles.,0,0
842,2,1,Works great and the software made it so it required little training to show them how to upload the pictures.,0,0
842,2,2,Low amount of memory, not an issue for the workplace, but if you bought it for a vacation or trip... get a memory stick to go with it.,1,1
843,2,0,I originally bought this camera because Kodak has always been devoted to higher quality.,0,0
843,2,1,The price was great, the picture quality is great (even in the dark), and it is lightweight and easy to use.,0,0
843,2,2,I love all of the different picture setting options this camera has, and how easy it is to set.,0,0
843,2,3,Overall a great camera for the price.,0,0
843,2,4,Overall, I have found absolutely no flaws in this camera.,1,0
843,2,5,The only thing I don't like is how the hook for the wrist strap is on the top right-hand corner of the camera.,1,1
843,2,6,I would rather have it down on the bottom or in the middle even, but this is just a preference and does not affect the operation of the camera.,1,1
844,2,0,Look, I'm going to be honest here, I don't know anything about digital cameras.,0,0
844,2,1,However, I can tell you that I get appreciable photographs and Video/Audio recording out of using mostly the automatic settings.,0,0
844,2,2,Outdoors on a sunny day, a high percentage of my photos turned out pretty great, and I could probably do even better with practice or manually setting the options.,0,0
844,2,3,Video recording is pretty hard on the battery, but that's probably typical.,1,1
844,2,4,I haven't tested extensively, but you could probably snap photos (outdoors in daylight, without flash) all day, but I'd estimate 45 minutes of just video.,1,1
845,2,0,Navigating through the camera is fast with an easy to follow interface, camera itself looks cool, pictures look great, large LCD screen -- steal for 100$.,0,0
845,2,1,Didn't come with a memory card but hardly a con about the camera.,1,1
846,2,0,Mostly I like the size and weight of it, slightly larger and heaver than others.,0,1
846,2,1,It allows for a decent grip with a place for my thumb.,0,1
846,2,2,Easy to hold and fingers don't accidentally press the wrong button.,0,1
846,2,3,Menus are good and there is dialog on screen for each of them.,0,1
846,2,4,Features and specs are comparable for the price range.,0,1
846,2,5,I like the battery included which eliminates the longevity problems and expense when using AA or AAA cells.,0,1
846,2,6,I'm using a 16 gb memory card and it holds more pics than I'll shoot in a year or two.,0,1
846,2,7,The mem card is a class 10 fast and it actually is pretty fast in high res.,0,1
846,2,8,Cam starts up quick.,0,1
846,2,9,I did not install any of the provided software, just notice that it reads as an external drive in Win7 and grab the images off it, then delete them from inside the cam in the same window.,0,1
846,2,10,The screen is definitely hard to see in very bright daylight - I've got it adjusted to a darker exposure in order to get a true blue sky.,1,0
846,2,11,Like all the point and shooters I've seen (not really a problem with just this one) the image is very contrasty and the sky washes out if the shadows are well exposed and if the sky is blue then the shadows are a bit too dark.,1,0
846,2,12,If I really want the image, I'll use photoshop to correct it and so I tend to underexpose them a little.,1,0
846,2,13,To be honest I really do miss the subtlety of old school film emulsion.,1,0
847,2,0,Good size.,0,0
847,2,1,Good quality.,0,0
847,2,2,Good pictures.,0,0
847,2,3,Battery life ok.,0,0
847,2,4,Nice interface.,0,0
847,2,5,Uses not so common cable for USB interface and charging.,1,1
847,2,6,But you can find the cables ok.,1,1
848,2,0,Plenty of features including rapid shot.,0,0
848,2,1,Great lifetime on the li-ion battery!,0,0
848,2,2,Purchased on black friday for about $90, what a steal!,0,0
849,2,0,Feels nice looks good on the outside.,0,0
849,2,1,I bought it through Newegg!,0,0
849,2,2,First off I would like to say that I am somewhat of a digital camera connoisseur.,1,0
849,2,3,I have owned many SLR's and point and shoot.,1,1
849,2,4,I bought this camera to replace an older Olympus point and shoot that I just flat out wore out.,1,1
849,2,5,It was the best point and shoot I have ever owned.,1,1
849,2,6,I got this out of the box charged it up and started taking pictures.,1,1
849,2,7,I noticed that the pictures were very grainy big surprise being 16 mega pixel my old one was 8 mega pixel and those pictures were 100 times better quality.,1,1
849,2,8,I figured it was due to low light conditions so I went out side, same thing.,1,1
849,2,9,I kept trying took about 150 pictures and ran the battery down.,1,1
849,2,10,I recharged the battery and it only let me take 15 pictures before the battery died again!,1,1
849,2,11,I wish I had bought a canon they have NEVER let me down.,1,1
849,2,12,I would like to return this camera but my 8 year old son destroyed the box :(,1,1
850,2,0,It's a very small compact camera.,0,0
850,2,1,It has a very wide screen and is very easy to use right out of the package.,0,0
850,2,2,It recharges using the USB port which is also very nice.,0,0
850,2,3,The pictures are pretty good.,0,0
850,2,4,Gave me some great pictures of the Grand Canyon and the Hoover Dam however.... (continued in the Cons section),0,0
850,2,5,I had a lot of problems focusing in anything other than daylight.,1,1
850,2,6,Some of my pictures from vacation are very fuzzy.,1,1
851,2,0,Can not get over how small these things are getting.,0,0
851,2,1,This one is not much bigger than a credit card size, SO if you have larger figers or have issues with small buttons, make sure this is the best one for you.,0,0
851,2,2,LARGE view screen, nice and bright.,0,0
851,2,3,Easy to use and install software.,0,0
852,2,0,Excellent focus,very large lcd screen, much lighter than my HP927, charged quiclky,0,0
852,2,1,Not as sturdy a camera, definetly need to be careful with lens,1,1
853,2,0,It takes HD video, but don't forget you'll need Kodak's dock  (not a big deal, in fact a nice product).,0,0
853,2,1,The stills are excellent too, it's "brainless" mode picks the best setting for what it believes you're doing, and it does a fair job doing so.,0,0
853,2,2,It's price for a 12MP camera and HD video is pretty good.,0,0
853,2,3,The optical zoom is of great quality.,0,0
853,2,4,Has some sophisticated features not well outlined in the manual.,1,1
853,2,5,Should have a dock included.,1,1
853,2,6,Screen not terribly huge or extremely high quality.,1,1
853,2,7,The digital zoom aspect is awful, images are horrible when it's employed.,1,1
854,2,0,HD quality pix with panning shots for wide screen shots in picture mode.,0,0
854,2,1,Good price for the feature, so far the best out there.,0,0
854,2,2,Video quality is good only when you have the right lighting.,1,1
854,2,3,Considering it's a digital camera, this doesn't bother me that much.,1,1
855,2,0,I believe this camera is great, it has a decent amount of megapixles, the price was my reason for buying it in the first place, and for point and shoot photos, it's great, some someone with average knowledge of camera's this one works great.,0,0
855,2,1,it's a little bigger then the new slim camera's, and so there is a limited amount of placed you can put it,1,1
856,2,0,I have had this camera for less than 2 hours, and think it is a very good choice for the casual photo taker.,0,0
856,2,1,I have recorded video, and taken photos, and the quality is awesome!,0,0
856,2,2,The picture and video quality on this camera are great.,0,0
856,2,3,This is a good quality camera for a basic/advanced user.,0,0
856,2,4,Some of the other viewers mentioned that this camera displays an "impressionist" sort of painting of an object that isn't in the camera's focus, but that I think is to be expected in this price range.,1,1
857,2,0,Takes nice clean shots and is easy to use.,0,0
857,2,1,Im satisfied with my purchase.,0,0
857,2,2,An excellent buy from Newegg, which included case,camera & 2 GB SD card.,0,0
857,2,3,Cant beat the price.,0,0
858,2,0,I couldn't have picked a better choice for my first digital camera.,0,0
858,2,1,I definitely got more for my money with this toy :) The selling point of this camera was 12MP and capability to record short video segments.,0,0
858,2,2,80 minutes (using an 8GB memory card)!,0,0
858,2,3,The audio is awesome on it as well!,0,0
858,2,4,My pc doesn't like the software the camera came with nor does it like USB ports, but that's just my pc.,1,1
858,2,5,It works fine on my fiance's pc...so it's not really a con.,1,1
858,2,6,I just put all my photos on the memory card.,1,1
858,2,7,The only other con I have is when I turn the flash off and take a photo, most of the photos are blurry, as if destabilizes, but that could be 'cause I'm still learning about the camera.,1,1
859,2,0,This camera is inexpensive for a 12MP camera, and it will take some decent quality outdoor shots.,0,1
859,2,1,Where this camera really falters is lighting.,1,1
859,2,2,This camera seems to have bad optics or a subpar CCD, as light will be your enemy.,1,1
859,2,3,Anything with less than super-saturated lighting (outdoors) will cause your images to lose all fine detail.,1,1
859,2,4,All indoor pictures, even when well-lit and with the flash on at modest distance (6 feet) will cause you to get more of an impressionist painting than a picture.,1,1
859,2,5,The pictures will be made up of small splotches of color, annihilating detail areas and edges.,1,1
859,2,6,Because of this, pet fur, hair, and other fine details are captured more as smudges than what they really are.,1,1
859,2,7,I tried to live with it, but this pitfall is proving most depressing.,1,1
859,2,8,I will probably be returning this model for something else.,1,1
859,2,9,I don't know what yet.,1,1
860,2,0,Price IS great.,0,0
860,2,1,Picture quality perfect, records great video, sounds ok on it to,,0,0
860,2,2,Hard to hold steady when shooting,1,1
861,2,0,inexpensive 12MP camera with HD video and 5x zoom.,0,0
861,2,1,Surprisingly compact, the photos online don't do it justice.,0,0
861,2,2,This may be a 12 mp camera but it's pictures lack the sharpness of my 7mp canon.,1,1
861,2,3,Of course I paid $400 for the canon four years ago.,1,1
861,2,4,There is no way to adjust the compression or to take photos in RAW format so you're subject to what ever compression Kodak decided to use for the camera.,1,1
862,2,0,Small but not tiny size with good zoom, great resolution pictures, good image stabilization, good video (with 4GB SDHC Turbo takes half an hour of video of 1280x720 HD), powerful flash (took good picture in complete darkness from 10 feet away).,0,0
862,2,1,with price range Vs. capabilities it makes it one of the best choices to buy.,0,0
862,2,2,SOFTWARE!!!! IT IS AWFUL....,1,1
862,2,3,I had freezes during 50-60% of upload, lost few pictures during transfers(good thing they weren't important), too painful to use unless you print pictures at home I guess, but I prefer professional quality prints, so had to uninstall whole thing right away.,1,1
862,2,4,Best choice is to get USB King$xxn SDHC card reader here on newegg which will make fast, seamless transfers and no lost pictures and you can use your favorite software to edit or print them.,1,1
862,2,5,Also it doesn't have case but with this price range I'm not surprised.,1,1
863,2,0,My kodak c813 was in great shape when I got it today.,0,0
863,2,1,I paid $8.30 for three day shipping but it took five days for me to get it.,1,1
863,2,2,I think its unfair to have to pay for a service I did not recieve.,1,1
863,2,3,I think you should offer a standard shipping for people especially if it takes the standard to get your purchase anyways.,1,1
863,2,4,I was very disappointed with the dilervery.,1,1
864,2,0,I have to have a time/date stamp for my job.,0,0
864,2,1,Zoom works very well.,0,0
864,2,2,Mine didn't come with a strap, probably just mine but it is still a con.,1,1
864,2,3,LCD display could be better.,1,1
865,2,0,Bad design.,1,1
865,2,1,As you will read in other reviews, this model is prone to dying very short in it's life.,1,1
866,2,0,very good camera for the price.,0,1
866,2,1,Works well in video mode basically making a cheap camcorder out of it.,0,1
866,2,2,I own a 2 MP and 5 MP Kodak already and also a Panasonic 7 MP.,0,1
866,2,3,Out of those I've always preferred kodak as the color correction on photos has always appeared better to me and this camera lives up to that.,0,1
866,2,4,Like my other kodak cameras this one is battery hungry, so I don't leave the batteries in it because it will drain them down.,1,0
866,2,5,Not a big deal though resetting the date and time each time I use it.,1,0
867,2,0,Yeah this is a pretty good Point and shoot camera.,0,0
867,2,1,If you're looking for a camera for family photos or something to carry around and you don't care for 'professional looking pictures' then this is a pretty good camera.,0,0
867,2,2,I really never had any problems that some of the others were talking about.,0,0
867,2,3,Battery life seems pretty good, quality is good (dropped it a bunch of time, turns on every time) and the pictures come out pretty good too.,0,0
867,2,4,The video is in quicktime format, not my favorite format.,1,1
867,2,5,Sorta a hassle to convert the video format every time to upload it to sites like facebook or youtube.,1,1
867,2,6,Plus there's a lack of customization (no aperture/shutter speed option in the menu) and the F-number can only go from F2.7 to F4.8, not ideal for landscape photography.,1,1
867,2,7,Also the auto-focusing can get annoying as it usually focuses in on something I don't want it in focus.,1,1
867,2,8,Yes it lacks those things but seriously..for $70 you can't complain.,1,1
868,2,0,works great.,0,0

874,2,1,Exceptionally quick flash recharge times (maybe fastest on the market).,0,0

874,2,8,My 2004 5mp Pentax Optio 555 takes much sharper and all-around superior photos than this 8mp camera.,1,1
874,2,9,Poor accessory package - no battery charger (charge from USB cable), no video cable - to show photos/video on TV, either download and burn to disk or buy $100 docking station.,1,1

875,2,3,The only con is of course the USB charge cable, however I don't have many problems with it because I am near my computer most of the time.,1,1
875,2,4,However, I have found an ac adapter that the USB cable plugs into so that you can charge it from an outlet, and those are on Kodak's website for like 10 bucks.,1,1
875,2,5,Regardless, the cable will still charge the camera.,1,1
876,2,0,After reading numerous reviews on multiple sites, I have found that this camera can charge through a usb port.,0,1
876,2,1,Although this camera comes with a usb cable, IT DOES NOT come with a regular charging power cable.,0,1
876,2,2,So unless you plan on always having a computer with a usb 2.0 port handy, you have to buy a charger separately.,1,1
876,2,3,I find this a major inconvenience.,1,1
877,2,0,I didn't want one of those flimsy cameras the I'm always afraid I'll drop.,0,0
877,2,1,The controls are very easy to work and understand.,0,0
877,2,2,The pictures are just awesome.,0,0
877,2,3,The software that comes with the camera is nice and easy to use.,0,0
877,2,4,You can use the software to transfer the images from your camera and then upload them to almost any web site such as WalMart or Walgreens.,0,0
877,2,5,For the price, you can't beat this camera.,0,0
877,2,6,Awesome pictures, great battery life, and super easy to use.,0,0
877,2,7,When you wrap all that with the price and a free 1GB SD card it's a done deal.,0,0
877,2,8,The only con I can see is that you don't get the A/C adapter for it.,1,1
877,2,9,It's not that big of a deal.,1,1
877,2,10,You just have to charge it from a computer.,1,1
878,2,0,Bought it for my mother- doesn't match up to my girlfriends s700 fuji, but not a bad camera for the money.,0,1
878,2,1,lots of red eye- but easily removable.,1,0
879,2,0,I got this camera on a whim for my trip to Hawaii as a entry level point & shoot digital camera and it has far surpassed my expectations.,0,0
879,2,1,Ultra-compact size, fits easily in your pocket.,0,0
879,2,2,8.2 MP takes great sized pictures.,0,0
879,2,3,Large LCD allows for easy picture previewing.,0,0
879,2,4,More features and presets than you would expect.,0,0
879,2,5,Very intuitive and easy to use.,0,0
879,2,6,Definitely best camera in it's price range.,0,0
879,2,7,No wall charger means you have to charge from your computer, but not a big enough inconvenience to lose a golden egg.,1,1
880,2,0,Small Size, clarity of photos, ease of use,0,0
880,2,1,iso, lack of advanced settings (although not expected),1,1
881,2,0,The camera took some great photos.,0,0
881,2,1,I loved the overall design and the fact that the still photos are HD quality.,0,0
881,2,2,That makes a great screen saver on my HD tv.,0,0
881,2,3,Huge LCD screen for maximum viewing.,0,0
881,2,4,After owning the camera for 3 weeks, the display kept turning blurry on me.,1,1
881,2,5,It got to the point where I couldn't see through it and since there is no view-finder it rendered the camera completely useless.,1,1
881,2,6,However, this had no impact on the photos taken just to see what would happen.,1,1
881,2,7,As the other reviewer mentioned, the USB  only recharging method.,1,1
882,2,0,Rechargeable battery has good life.,0,0
882,2,1,Lots of options for setting camera for diferent scenarios (portrait, action, candlelight, sunset, etc.) 8.2 MP pictures are very nice on screen.,0,0
882,2,2,LCD is clear and big.,0,0
882,2,3,No 120VAC charger.,1,1
882,2,4,must be charged with computer USB port.,1,1
883,2,0,Great little camera as far as picture quality.,0,0
883,2,1,Easy to use.,0,0
883,2,2,Nice features such as the pan-and-stitch panoramic and different filters.,0,0
883,2,3,While I understand that cameras are fragile by nature, I would expect that they would be tough enough to take a 3 inch fall on hardwood floors.,1,1
883,2,4,Unfortunately, it didn't.,1,1
883,2,5,It knocked the retractable lens out of alignment and won't retract.,1,1
884,2,0,good quality pix.,0,0
884,2,1,plenty of options (video looks good, can take two or three pix and stitch them together in panorama, different kinds of picture modes, can take clips of videos and turn them into pix, can crop pix on camera, timer, edit clips of videos,).,0,0
884,2,2,good zoom (my older cameras lost quality when zooming - this camera does too, but not nearly as much.,0,0
884,2,3,there are two phases of zoom - optical, which doesn't lose barely any quality at all, and digital, which loses some quality).,0,0
884,2,4,delete, menu, and review (pix) have each their own button - convenient.,0,0
884,2,5,not as skinny as i would have hoped - about the width of one's thumb.,1,1
884,2,6,for me, the up and down arrow buttons on the nagivation circle were kind of hard to press.,1,1
884,2,7,plus, the battery does not come with its own charger, so you either need to plug it into the wall with an adapter or to a computer with an included usb cable.,1,1
884,2,8,also, it doesn't havve its own carrying case.,1,1
884,2,9,plus, fingerprints can get a little annoying on the screen.,1,1
884,2,10,make sure you hold camera as still as possible when taking pix - otherwise its a little fuzzy.,1,1
885,2,0,Small, compact,0,1
885,2,1,Blurry, grainy pictures on any setting,1,1
886,2,0,This camera was very easy to use and comes in great colors.,0,0
886,2,1,For a person with a limited understanding of technology, this camera was the best.,0,0
887,2,0,Pictures are better than I expected.,0,1
887,2,1,Look like film pictures.,0,1
887,2,2,Read some mixed reviews and decided to try it anyway, glad I did.,0,1
887,2,3,Very crisp, real looking pictures.,0,1
887,2,4,I guess if you're a professional you're not going to like it for one reason or another.,0,1
887,2,5,If you're an average user who wants impressive photos to the amatuer eye you can't go wrong.,0,1
887,2,6,Wasn't free?,1,1
888,2,0,Light weight,0,0
888,2,1,The resolution is very bad.,1,1
888,2,2,Its says it is 8.2 MP but the pictures with this camera are worse than a 1.3 MP phone camera,1,1
889,2,0,It's a small camera with a bunch of megapixels, apparently.,0,0
889,2,1,Very easy to use, good options, and good button layout.,0,0
889,2,2,pretty good video quality, but again, not as good as i thought it should be.,0,0
889,2,3,Although its just a small screen, its hard to tell if you just took a good picture or a bad one.,1,1
889,2,4,yes, the batteries that it comes with run down really quickly, but who cares, some cameras dont come with any.,1,1
889,2,5,As for the feel of the camera itself, its all plastic and feels like a toy.,1,1
889,2,6,and even though i do like the button layout, they feel flimsy themselves.,1,1
890,2,0,Takes great pictures right out of the box.,0,0
890,2,1,It's small enough to pack away anywhere.,0,0
890,2,2,The video is great with HiDef quality and detail.,0,0
890,2,3,I have not had a problem with batteries as long as I prepare.,0,0
890,2,4,I have bought a charger and 4 lith nicad batteries.,0,0
890,2,5,With an extra pair...I can take a days worth of pictures with great detail.,0,0
890,2,6,I love "Monster" Batteries and the automatic charger.,0,0
890,2,7,They are hard to find ....but the best!!,0,0
890,2,8,The stabilizer feature doesn't work very well.,1,1
891,2,0,Excellent Video.,0,0
891,2,1,1080i, and its perfect.,0,0
891,2,2,Stills are good quality as well.,0,0
891,2,3,we use it as point and shoot primarilly so we have not used alot of the manual features, be we are satisfied.,0,0
891,2,4,12mp pictures are hard to e-mail...2 to 3 max per email.,1,1
891,2,5,OOPS! Doesn't talk back (I like a bad attitude in a camera),1,1
892,2,0,This camera takes great pictures and for the price its a steal.,0,0
892,2,1,The 12 mp really shows on poster prints.,0,0
892,2,2,The screen is low resolution, but not really a big deal because the pictures are what count and they are good.,1,1
893,2,0,I have owned the camera for a couple weeks now and found the camera extremly easy to use with a lot of nice features.,0,0
893,2,1,It seems to write images to memory fast and upload via the provided USB cable fast.,0,0
893,2,2,I installed a 2 gb SD card which you will need to store a reasonable number of the 12 mp images.,0,0
893,2,3,The 3 picture panarama capability works well and is easy to use.,0,0
893,2,4,I found two major problems with the camera.,1,1
893,2,5,First, when shooting scenery, distant objects are not sharp and clear as one would expect for a camera boasting 12 mp.,1,1
893,2,6,And second, and probably the most important is the battery difficulties.,1,1
893,2,7,The manual says one can use Ni-Mh, lithium or AA rechargeable types.,1,1
893,2,8,I found I could take only a dozen or so photos with fully charged 1600 ma NI-Mh batteries.,1,1
893,2,9,I called the Kodak Customer service and was told that Kodak only recommends the Lithium batteries.,1,1
893,2,10,"Use those those and all problems go away" so they say.,1,1
893,2,11,Anyway, batteries seems to be a problem.,1,1
894,2,0,Other than the great price per Mega Pixel and the ability to take HD movies, you can use the zoom while in movie mode.,0,0
894,2,1,I do not have a camcorder anymore so now ths camera fills the gap nicely.,0,0
894,2,2,The camera also is fairly compact.,0,0
894,2,3,The digital image stabilization is not all that effective.,1,1
894,2,4,I do not have experience with optical stabilization so I do not know how well that works by comparison.,1,1
895,2,0,The resolution of pictures is great (it should be - it's a 12MP)!,0,0
895,2,1,One of the best features is the HD video capability - those videos turn out really nice and clear.,0,0
895,2,2,Although the videos come off in QuickTime format, you can watch them in both Windows and Linux using VLC Media Player (free) whereas the QuickTime on my computer is messed up and won't play anything.,0,0
895,2,3,The camera boots up really slow.,1,1
895,2,4,From the time I hit the power button until it's ready to take a picture, it's between 7 and 8 seconds.,1,1
895,2,5,That's terrible compared to other cameras I have owned (1-2 seconds).,1,1
895,2,6,I don't know if it has something to do with the A-DATA 4G SDHC Class 6 memory card I use (I hope so!).,1,1
895,2,7,Get yourself some good rechargeable batteries (Sony) because the non-rechargeable Kodak AA's that come with the camera are pretty weak and only lasted me about 100 pictures plus a couple minutes of video.,1,1
896,2,0,This camera boasts the lowest $/MP cost i have seen.,0,0
896,2,1,The ultra iso mode takes amazing shots in low light/night situation.,0,0
896,2,2,HD video capability is a very promising feature that i have yet to try.,0,0
896,2,3,It's also really good looking--the black on gray is very sleek.,0,0
896,2,4,The perfect touch function reworks pictures on the camera, with great results.,0,0
896,2,5,No view finder (who cares?).,1,1
896,2,6,Does not include rechargeable batteries.,1,1
897,2,0,Great camera.,0,1
897,2,1,I am running XP SP3 and Windows recognizes the camera through the usb port.,0,1
897,2,2,You don't need a card reader or the Kodak software to read the SD card or internal memory.,0,1
898,2,0,I like the slimmer design, lightweight and decent picture quality.,0,0
898,2,1,Shoots a green beam towards object before taking photo.,1,0
898,2,2,I imagine the green beam is a range finder of some sort and assist the camera during focusing.,1,0
898,2,3,Can be a distraction and the result is that most snapshots resulted in the persons eyes closed due to the beam in their eyes, before a flash, and is rather annoying.,1,0
898,2,4,Also, ISO is only automatic from 64- 400 and although the specs specify manual ISO is selectable, I found that a button is depressed for ISO, but the actual ISO 
Also, pay attention to the battery and the apparatus to the charging adapter, which I didn't care for.,1,0
898,2,5,The lcd displays a somewhat grainy picture.,1,0
899,2,0,Nice Camers with 12mp Great for basic functions and picture taking nothing special,0,0
899,2,1,The LCD isnt the greatest but the photo's come out real nice if you take the time to set up the camera correctly,1,0
900,2,0,Ok I don't know much about digital cameras but I like this one!,0,0
900,2,1,Theres 1 button you push and it brings up most of the settings for different types of shots, and of course a menu for other things like lcd brightness, ISO setting, etc.  1 button to push to cycle through flash settings.,0,0
900,2,2,1 button to push to switch to video mode... you get the idea - its easy to use.,0,0
900,2,3,No optical viewfinder which is a bummer but I dont need one since I got this huge lcd screen showing me what I'm pointing at.,1,1
900,2,4,Also, I hated having to use their stupid software to transfer pictures but I have the hang of it now so its pretty quick.,1,1
900,2,5,I do wish, though, that you could just install the transfer program and not all the extra junk for editing and sharing.. thats what photoshop is for.,1,1
901,2,0,great camera, excellent photo quality.,0,0
901,2,1,Newegg packaged it well in shipping.,0,0
901,2,2,have not noticed any problems or flaws.,0,1

901,2,4,screen is nice and crisp and clear.,0,0
901,2,5,cant think of anything that could need improving,1,0
902,2,0,This camera takes amazing pictures.,0,0
902,2,1,It works great with my 16gb HCSD card.,0,0
902,2,2,Video is great as well.,0,0
902,2,3,USB interface requires the Kodac software to be installed.,1,1
903,2,0,I was just wondering what is the largest capacity flash card this camera supports?,0,1
903,2,1,I have only been able to find 4gb cards.,0,1
903,2,2,Also once you have your pictures in the Kodak software, can you then transfer them to other drives and manipulate them?,0,1
903,2,3,I need to get a high resolution camera to take texture pics for videogame development, but I want to make sure I get what I really need.,0,1
904,2,0,First let me say thanks to Newegg customer service.,0,1
904,2,1,I ordered this from Focus Camera the first time and after ordering I read the seller reviews (my fault) and was horrified so I tried to call Focus and got a recording saying the would be closed for the next week for some unknown holiday.,0,1
904,2,2,So I called Newegg and they canceled the order for me and gave me a full refund, they bent over backwards for me (thanks again).,0,1
904,2,3,I then orders from Adorama and received it in 4 days in perfect condition.,0,1
904,2,4,Very versatile, from point and shoot to completely manual it takes great shots.,0,1
904,2,5,This camera has it all, 8 different focusing modes (I only need 2), 4 metering modes, continuous shots, remote shutter release and it all work great.,0,1
905,2,0,Solid feel, great construction.,0,0
905,2,1,A multitude of options and settings.,0,0
905,2,2,More than enough features and quality for the beginner and or amateur photographer.,0,0

906,2,0,Beautiful colors
Sharp Images
Lightweight
Fast autofcusing
Decent kit lens
Tons of configurable settings
Excellent value for money,0,0
906,2,1,Interface and settings can be intimidating for first time users,1,1
907,2,0,It takes great pics.,0,1
907,2,1,I was interested in taking night sky photos and the D5200 and the D3200 have very high test ratings for low light, so this Nikon was an obvious choice over other brands.,0,1
907,2,2,And 39 autofocus points is a plus, too.,0,1
907,2,3,Battery life isn't bad either.,0,1
907,2,4,Menus are less intuitive than other brands, but not also not too difficult to navigate.,1,0
908,2,0,Light weight, manual mode controls are easy to remember, great quality,0,0
908,2,1,18-55 lens is an ok lens to start with, but not fabulous.,1,1
908,2,2,Flash button is awkwardly placed.,1,1
909,2,0,I love this camera, my old one was a D80 and this is a real move up and I love the ease of use in the menus.,0,0
909,2,1,Set up is a snap and I love the viewer on the back of the camera.,0,0
909,2,2,You can swivel it around to make it easier to see what you are shooting when you lift it over your head or down low.,0,0
909,2,3,No cons this is a great camera out of the box if you are going to buy this product be aware that you are going to need a new DX or AF lens for it old lens will not autofocus.,1,1
910,2,0,Once you fighter out how to operate the Camera this a BLAST to use.,0,0
910,2,1,I love it ; its a dam good camera,0,0
910,2,2,the only thing I did not like about is it dose not come with a  SD card,1,1
911,2,0,Great zoom.,0,0
911,2,1,Good controls for fine tuning the settings.,0,0
911,2,2,Did not come with a battery charger like the previous model.,1,1
912,2,0,Super sharp pictures, lots of features, great zoom, absolutely superb quality in any light settings.,0,0
912,2,1,Probably the best SLR-Like camera's you can buy for this price, or even a little more.,0,0
912,2,2,Did not come with a rechargeable battery, the battery that is included in the package is just a high quality single use battery.,1,1
912,2,3,Once its dead, you gotta buy a new battery, or buy a rechargeable one.,1,1
913,2,0,The camera features Schneider-Kreuznach lens and 12X optical Zoom.,0,0
913,2,1,It can use 2AA, a rechargeable battery or the type of battery included in a box.,0,0
913,2,2,You can manually adjust almost everything in your way when shooting photos.,0,0
913,2,3,You can also shoot any moving objects/people.,0,0

913,2,6,The ISO settings are Auto, 64, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1600.,0,0
913,2,7,I gave this camera the 4 stars.,1,0
913,2,8,Kodak is pretty bad about including any necessary accessories such as an AC adapter and a rechargeable battery.,1,1
913,2,9,Why AC adapter?,1,1
913,2,10,By using it, you can try to learn all the functions all night long without wasting a battery or two.,1,1
913,2,11,BTW, the battery included in the box looks like rechargeable but it is NOT!!,1,1
913,2,12,I also bought a compatible dock kit by Kodak.,1,1
913,2,13,It includes a rechargeable battery but be aware..the battery included in the Kodak Dock kit is NOT compatible with Z712 IS camera though the box says the "KIT" is compatible with the Z series.,1,1
913,2,14,I have talked to a Kodak CS rep and he told me the battery is included as a free gift and you have to buy the compatible battery, $29.99 at the Kodak Online store or $42.99 at the BXXX XXX..why?,1,1
913,2,15,He said the box meant to say only the dock station is compatible with Z712 IS.,1,1
913,2,16,I mostly use the Photoshop just to edit pics and noticed some noises in ISO 400.,1,1
913,2,17,The 800 and 1600 on this camera are totally useless to me.,1,1

915,2,0,I've used 2 of these 30Ds for sports photography, and one I have well over 100,000 pictures on.,0,1
915,2,1,When these came out the 5 frames a second is what caught my eye.,0,1
915,2,2,I've shot low light dance performances with a 70-200 IS lens at 800-1000 ISO and sold a lot of pictures "they where crisp and clear" now that I'm talking about it I took 13,000 pictures in 2.5 days.,0,1
915,2,3,Now I figured the low light..... Dancing I would have to trash half ....I kept over 10,000 pictures (and sold them too).,0,1
915,2,4,I have shot NFL,The Masters Tour,Nascar with my 30D's.,0,1
915,2,5,Now I have the 1D Mark III and keep a 30D as my side camera and the other 30D is in the bag as a backup,0,1
916,2,0,I have used the 30D for over a year now and have gotten some great pics from it.,0,0
916,2,1,L glass is of course the best choice.,0,0
916,2,2,Camera has worked flawlessly.,0,0
916,2,3,I just bought a 40D and would suggest that if you can justifie the added cost that you buy it instead.,0,0
916,2,4,Better all the way around.,0,0

917,2,2,Price?,1,1
917,2,3,I don't know of any real cons.,1,1
917,2,4,Maybe the fact you end up spending lots of money on lenses and stuff, if you're like me :),1,1
918,2,0,I have used this camera on a school newspaper for a school year, with many different lenses, and all I can say is wow.,0,1
918,2,1,It's image quality and responsiveness is unparalleled at this price point, and overall it's a stunning package.,0,1
918,2,2,The 30D has a huge screen, larger than almost any other DSLR out there, it has very easy to navigate menus.,0,1
918,2,3,The camera has some heft, but to its credit – it feels solid and comfortable in the hand, and makes a very pleasing shutter sound, as if it had no intention of ever falling apart.,0,1
918,2,4,In a school newspaper environment, lenses get exchanged very frequently for different sports/etc.,1,0
918,2,5,which means that there's wear and tear on the lens mount ring.,1,0
918,2,6,Sometimes a bit of grease or metal grindings will settle into the mount and make for a nasty hand washing if you happen to touch it.,1,0
919,2,0,Dual-dial system is best I've used- allows you to change two different values simultaneously, among aperture/lens speed/exposure, vafious info chart displays and histogram options are great when viewing, and of course the wide variety of Canon accessories.,0,0
919,2,1,5 FRAMES PER SECOND.,0,0
919,2,2,It can get a little awkward to move both the large dial with your thumb and the small dial with your finger at the same time, but as far as I know no other camera even lets you do this so it really isn't a con.,1,1
920,2,0,Besides the obvious technical advantages over other cameras, this camera feels great in your hands.,0,0
920,2,1,The shutter sounds and feels great when you press that little button and the picture comes to life in the LCD.,0,0
921,2,0,Great camera.,0,0

922,2,0,I"ve been using it for more than 6 months and decided to write a review.,0,1
922,2,1,It works fast, very good for sports photographer.,0,1
922,2,2,I upgraded from Fuji S7000, so it's a big different.IF you buy the right lens, the image turns out sharp and focused.,0,1
922,2,3,If you buy cheap -low quality lens.. the results will disappointed.,0,1

930,2,10,I'm glad I didn't.,1,1
930,2,11,I guess a con would be that the batteries that come with the camera only last for about a half hour (30 shots).,1,1

960,2,17,The otherwise sleek and fast interface forces users to press buttons 6 times just to activate the 2 second self timer.,1,1
960,2,18,The camera is so light that it tends to shake on a tripod when the shutter is pressed down, so the clunky self timer interface makes night and low light photography a chore.,1,1

976,2,7,The trip was irreplaceable and It annoys me that I could not get the quality of picture that I had hoped.,1,1
976,2,8,Again the camera is fine but the false sense of what the kit had is why I give it 3 eggs.,1,1

977,2,6,It's not that big of a deal except in my case.,1,1
977,2,7,All of my cards are standard SDHC cards, so I'll be taking a bit of time switching out.,1,1
977,2,8,Understand, it utilizes a MICRO SDHC CARD only.,1,1

979,2,1,Look at the picture of the box if you need proof.,0,1
979,2,2,It's a Samsung, NOT a Sony.,0,1
979,2,3,Just balancing out the misguided first review,1,0
980,2,0,Sony quality is generally good.,0,0
980,2,1,Where is the advertised Front LCD Screen?,1,1
980,2,2,Looks like the pictures don't match the product description.,1,1
981,2,0,Front LCD Screen , good for hand held group picture include myself  !!
Wide lens helps too,0,0
981,2,1,takes a few buttons to enable flash if front LCD screen is on.,1,0
982,2,0,High resolution for great image clarity and detail.,0,0
982,2,1,Easy to use.,0,0
982,2,2,Ergonomic; doesn't feel like it wants to slip out of your hand (important for an expensive camera).,0,0
982,2,3,Very easy to set up software on PC and transfer images.,0,0
982,2,4,While it is not slow when compared to most other digital cameras, the shutter delay (from the time you press the button until the picture is taken) is not fast enough for me.,1,1
982,2,5,The delay between pictures is also far too long for me.,1,1
982,2,6,I did not time them, but I did research enough to find that it is comparable to most other digital cameras in its class.,1,1
982,2,7,In order to avoid this, you would probably have to spend a great deal more, or sacrifice things like image quality (9.0 Megapixel).,1,1
983,2,0,Solid construction.,0,0
983,2,1,Comes with batteries, charger, cords, memory card and excellent paper manual.,0,0
983,2,2,Very low noise images with well above average color and clarity.,0,0
983,2,3,Useful and easy to navigate menus and shooting modes as opposed to 20-30 silly and useless modes.,0,0
983,2,4,Full manual control over just about every setting (nice).,0,0
983,2,5,This camera has racked up many editor choice awards, top picks, best buy (consumer reports) as well as the best digital camera award in europe.,0,0
983,2,6,LCD is a bit small.,1,0
983,2,7,The included 16MB xD card should be a 256MB, but if you shoot for the web, the 16MB card will hold well ober 100 images.,1,0
984,2,0,Very easy to use and understand.,0,0
984,2,1,Photo quality has been good.,0,0
984,2,2,When taking a photo, camera seems to be a little loud and hesitant at times.,1,0
985,2,0,Compact and nice to operate.,0,0
985,2,1,I like the RAW file format support, fully manual control as well as a number of other options,0,0
985,2,2,Does not work well with Alkaline batteries, must use the include rechargeable Ni-MH batteries,1,1
986,2,0,I was looking for moderate zoom and wide angle with low noise.,0,1
986,2,1,As a user of the Fuji S602Z I was aware of the advantages of the 2/3 rds inch CCD and looking back in my 10000+ digital photos -- the Original Digital Rebel and the Interpolated S602Z stand out by far as the best shots.,0,1
986,2,2,I realize that 9 megapixels in the place where 3.3 used to be is going to lower the s/n ratio, but Fuji's more elaborate signal processing make this a very low noise camera.,0,1
986,2,3,It is even useable at ISO 800 in lower light.,0,1
986,2,4,This is a camera worth twice the price at the current $326 selling price.,0,1
986,2,5,XD memory -- I almost didn't buy because of this one thing, then I noticed that it is just a little higher on average than other formats.,1,1

987,2,3,Uses AA batteries and comnes with a charger for them.,0,1
987,2,4,RAW kinda sucks off this camera.,1,0
987,2,5,Maybe too dumbed down for serious photographers.,1,0
988,2,0,Nice and small, large screen, faster than average cameras.,0,0
988,2,1,I find the quality to be somewhat lacking, even for a small camera like this, and it would be nice if it had a usb port to connect directly to your computer instead of having to use a dock.,1,1
989,2,0,Very nice pictures, xD picture card, great value for the money.,0,0
989,2,1,Rechargeable battery would be nice, but still a great value.,1,0
990,2,0,This is just to alert those of you who are looking for higher image quality than the usual point and shoots.,0,1
990,2,1,This camera has the larger 1/1.7" sensor rather than the 1/2.3",0,1
990,2,2,sensor that is used in most other Canon powershots.,0,1
990,2,3,I have the Canon G-9 that also uses the 1/1.7" sensor.,0,1
990,2,4,It takes noticeably better lower noise photos than my regular point and shoot Canon with smaller sensor.,0,1
990,2,5,Now, the G-9 is a few years old at this time, so there could have been a lot of advances made in that time.,0,1
990,2,6,But I believe that there is still a noticeable difference.,0,1
990,2,7,I think that the newer G models use the 1/1.7" sensor still, except for the newest $800 G1X that uses a big 1" sensor almost as big as the DSLR cameras use that cost thousands.,0,1
991,2,0,This has the larger sensor than the run of the mill point and shoot Canons.,0,1
991,2,1,I have used my G9, which uses a similar sized sensor, for about four years and it is great for portraits and snapshots as well as panaramas.,0,1
991,2,2,But I still carry my small point and shoot for family outings and keep the big one home.,0,1
991,2,3,This also has a F 2 opening on the lens iris which many people love as it gives good low light photos without flash and lower noise.,0,1
991,2,4,Lets in more light.,0,1
991,2,5,Called being a "FAST" lens, cause it makes you use a faster shutter speed for the same amount of light.,0,1
991,2,6,F2 is pretty fast,  enough to not have to take flash in museums usually.,0,1
991,2,7,Those two items are worth the money right there, and it also has much more improvements over a regular small camera, like RAW pictures, which are what it sounds like, unprocessed, uncompressed data photos you can work on yourself rather than have the camera process.,0,1
991,2,8,Also it has the latest Digic 5 photo program to make little things better.,0,1
991,2,9,The larger the sensor, the better the picture.,0,1
991,2,10,There is less noise and better contrast and pop.,0,1
991,2,11,Wether this is is important enough to you to spend the extra money on is up to your budget.,0,1
991,2,12,But you do get a better picture from this camera than you would from a $150-$190 camera with a 1/3 inch sensor.,0,1
991,2,13,Just be aware the difference is slight and may not be noticed by all who view it.,0,1
991,2,14,But if you are debating whether or not to go with a large DSLR or a small point and shoot, this is a good inbetween.,0,1
991,2,15,It is small and you might lose it, whereas a big DSLR is never to be lost in its big bag and all the lenses.,1,1
991,2,16,I really can't think of a reason to buy a big camera, unless you need to take professional pictures of highest possible quality, which most family pics are not.,1,1
992,2,0,I bought it for two reasons: 
1.) AWESOME LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY
2.) 1600 x 1200 Resolution pictures with high compression (low KB size images)
3.) LONG BATTERY TIME

In simple words, I use camera for taking a lot of pictures and sending them through emails and for that I need small size picture but quite large resolution I require min.,0,1
992,2,1,1600 x 1200 and my max size is so far: 569KB min size: 102KB and average size: 260KB STILL SAME RESOLUTION: 1600 x 1200
Now the very low light photos: I absolutely hate pictures done with flash so I am ABSOLUTELY A M A Z E D with pictures done in low-light, they look just as a human eye can see it.,0,1
992,2,2,If someone would ever told me that this camera is capable of delivering such an images under such a circumstances I would not believe it, now I know it can
Battery hold a charge for more than week (with a very frequent use of flash light) but obviously constant use of LCD 
I Truly am grateful, Thank You Canon,0,1
993,2,0,Light and compact, it's a decent take-along when you don't want the heft of a DSLR.,0,0
993,2,1,Images are solid, RAW shooting is good; I don't feel like I'm losing everything from my DSLR.,0,0
993,2,2,I like the super-fast burst mode if I ever have a good reason to use it, and the exposure bracketing makes up for a nearly useless HDR feature.,0,0
993,2,3,Good color JPEGs, pretty quick turn-on-to-photo response.,0,0
993,2,4,HDR is worthless without a tripod.,1,1
993,2,5,When so many other brands have HDR auto-alignment built into the camera.,1,1
993,2,6,GPS auto-logging eats the battery; I'd rather use my phone for GPS logging and then use a program like Geosetter to sync.,1,1
993,2,7,This is written in other reviews, but the firmware's requirement for ISO80 for exposures over a few seconds is baseless and stupid.,1,1
993,2,8,Makes it impossible to take any star pictures or any decent night-time picture.,1,1
993,2,9,I hope they can tweak this in a future firmware update.,1,1
994,2,0,Great upgrade from the S90
Plenty of great features (slow motion, tilt shift video / pictures) 
Excellent low light photography
Large LCD,0,0
994,2,1,Pricey
LCD broke with very little stress
GPS is a battery hog,1,1
995,2,0,**This review is for the RAW images only**

This camera has the best manual control relative to its size, the auto-focus is spot on, and the noise level at ISO 800 - 3200 is manageable with software (Lightroom 3/CS5+), the photos that develop from this little beast almost put my Canon 50D, and 1D to shame.,0,0
995,2,1,The control rings are so useful in capturing the photos that YOU want, and not what the camera THINKS what you want.,0,0
995,2,2,RAW Images look horrible on the 3" screen (due to the fact that the images themselves can't be read by the s100) but open them up on your computer and you will simply be BLOWN away.,0,0
995,2,3,The video quality of this camera is INCREDIBLE, FULL HD at 24p, and it looks like a legitimate Hollywood movie.,0,0
995,2,4,The battery life while shooting RAW (no flash) gets me about maybe 80 to 100 shots; but if one is going to spend about $400 (at the time of writing this) on a camera, one should be able to afford a spare GENUINE Canon battery.,1,1
996,2,0,Tons of features, can use in almost any situation easily.,0,0
996,2,1,HDR has to be used with a tripod, too bad it isn't able to be held by hand or adjusted in camera to change the exposure times for each picture being taken.,1,1
997,2,0,Small - It is a compact camera after all.,0,1
997,2,1,Well Built - Surprisingly solid and hefty.,0,1
997,2,2,Much better than the SX230.,0,1
997,2,3,Larger image sensor than your typical compact.,0,1
997,2,4,Only 12 MP but the larger sensor has better looking pics than a 16 MP with a smaller sensor.,0,1
997,2,5,Ability to shoot RAW.,0,1
997,2,6,Enough manual controls if you're into that.,0,1
997,2,7,Somewhat short battery life.,1,0

998,2,3,-Strong Flash,0,0
998,2,4,Most common issue on this camera is the Zoom error, and very easy to fix too.,1,1
998,2,5,To fix this just turn off the camera, turn glently the zoom until it's fully out (you will hear a click).,1,1
998,2,6,Turn on the camera again, and thats it.,1,1
998,2,7,I have got this error like 3 times since i got this camera and always work, no need for sending the camera to a repair center.,1,1
999,2,0,This Camera really is nice.,0,0

1000,2,4,Good looking images.,0,0
1000,2,5,Camera developed a problem similar to another user here.,1,1
1000,2,6,"Tree-rings" or "thumbprints" begin to appear over the images.,1,1
1000,2,7,Outdoors, images have become very washed out.,1,1
1001,2,0,This camera takes good pictures,0,0
1001,2,1,This camera has been back to company 3 times for repairs due to "zoom error".,1,1
1001,2,2,The lens will lock up  and the company doesn't like to talk about all the problems with the zoom.,1,1
1001,2,3,Read the forums and users will tell you of the frequent "zoom error" lockup problem.,1,1
1002,2,0,took great pictures, and the color boosting was great.,0,0
1002,2,1,It took only a few mins to figure out how to use it, but had enough fetures to play with for weeks.,0,0
1002,2,2,After a few hundred photos, small lines started to appear across the images.,1,1
1002,2,3,This became very frequent and now more than half the image is nothing but these white lines,,1,1
1003,2,0,It works well, does good low light shots which is rare for this class of camera, and takes good pictures.,0,0
1003,2,1,The autofocus and image stabilization work great.,0,0
1003,2,2,Every time you take the battery out for charging it resets everything.,1,1
1003,2,3,This won't be a problem if you buy it with a charging cord, which I did not do.,1,1
1003,2,4,I bought it used.,1,1
1003,2,5,It could use more modes for different situations, and it takes a few seconds to get the autofocus settings just right.,1,1
1004,2,0,Excellent low-light sensitivity, Great results from standard settings in most lighting conditions, good battery life, easy to use controls and fits nicely in average hand, nice fit and finish, low distortion at all focal ranges, good sharpness on edges of images, chrome setting gives nice color saturation and adds to many lighting situations.,0,0
1004,2,1,Non-standard battery, no usable memory card included (though 1GB cards are very inexpensive nowadays), metal casing gets slippery when hands are sweaty -rubberized grip would have been nice, no case included, battery charger requires battery to be in camera in order to charge it, average "purple fringing" in high contrast areas, LCD size is good, but resolution is average, no optical viewfinder -you must use the LCD or "guesstimate" thus reducing battery life.,1,1
1005,2,0,I take lots of indoor shots in variable light.,0,1
1005,2,1,Indoor portraits are fine with a flash, but the available light results are dramatically better than other major brands.I get some occassional camera shake in low light when I am not careful.,0,1
1005,2,2,Just got a Z5fd for my wife - best all-around compact on the market, but F10 still outperforms in low light.,0,1
1005,2,3,I always use a card-reader for painless transfers and the battery does 300+ pics - again best in class performance.,0,1
1005,2,4,Solid camera and exceptionally well-made.,0,1
1005,2,5,Could use a few more manual controls.,1,0
1005,2,6,Focus flash can be pretty bright.,1,0
1006,2,0,Absolutely great low light performance.,0,0
1006,2,1,The noise levels at ISO 1600 are less than other cameras I have had at at ISO 400.,0,0
1006,2,2,Very, very long battery life.,0,0
1006,2,3,Very well built.,0,0
1006,2,4,Very pocketable.,0,0
1006,2,5,Propietary connection for USB cable and battery charging, though you can buy a card reader and get an additional battery and battery charger pretty cheaply online.,1,1
1006,2,6,Purple fringing in high contrast areas.,1,1
1006,2,7,No optical view finder.,1,1
1007,2,0,Well all i can say about this camera is not only is it easy, smart, and long lasting, but the amount of pics you can take at once is unreal.,0,1
1007,2,1,charge time is not so bad either.,0,1
1007,2,2,the only thing that you have to watch out for is the screen.,0,1
1007,2,3,It's so big that it may be easy for somethinng to leave a mark.,0,1
1007,2,4,the only bad thing about it, but it is hard to find a camera RIGHT NOW that is good, is the low light pics.,1,0
1008,2,0,I bought 7D from Newegg and can never use it without Error 20 showing up.,1,1
1008,2,1,When I received it, it stopping working with Error 20 which cannot be fixed by ourselves.,1,1
1008,2,2,I did not have time shipping it to their repair center and waiting for a quote for fixing this problem coming with this brand new machine.,1,1
1008,2,3,The only thing I could do is to buy another cheaper camera body from a local store, from which I can return a defective item easily.,1,1
1009,2,0,Good frame burst (listed as 8, more like 7).,0,0
1009,2,1,Build quality is excellent.,0,0
1009,2,2,Poor high ISO performance (compared to new models), uses expensive CF cards instead of cheap SD cards, annoying and mostly useless poppy uppy flash.,1,1
1010,2,0,Still fairly small compared to a full-frame camera so it's easier to take it with you.,0,0
1010,2,1,Durable, tons of available lenses, great low light, decent video, fast, great quality shots.,0,0
1010,2,2,Has up to 30 second automatic shutter speed, and a bulb mode to take super-long exposures if you're into star trails.,0,1
1010,2,3,You must manually focus during video recording.,1,1
1010,2,4,Uses a crop sensor (a pro and a con depending on your needs.),1,1
1010,2,5,Not as easy to learn to use as an entry-level camera, because it gives you the feature set of a professional level camera on the entry-level 1.6x crop sensor.,1,1
1011,2,0,Durable fast, billiant in low light.,0,0
1011,2,1,12,000+ shots and still running strong!,0,0
1012,2,0,Great ergonomics and a very well designed arrangement or functions on the body.,0,0
1012,2,1,Wonderfully large, 100% coverage viewfinder, the BEST viewfinder I have ever looked through.,0,0
1012,2,2,I loved having all those auto focus points.,0,0
1012,2,3,1.6X crop factor found on the APS-C sized sensor isn't a plus to some users, but it adds to the strength of this camera for the sports photographer where you could often use a little extra focal length.,0,0
1012,2,4,Pictures are VERY sharp with great contrast when paired with decent lenses.,0,0
1012,2,5,Built in flash triggering system.,0,0
1012,2,6,Weather sealed magnesium body - very durable while remaining fairly light in weight.,0,0
1012,2,7,Noise is this camera's biggest fault.,1,1
1012,2,8,Honestly this camera produces more noise than I thought possible.,1,1
1012,2,9,I found tons of luminance noise populating my images of birds shot at the lake with ISO 100 on a clear blue sky.,1,1
1012,2,10,After noticing this I payed closer attention to my images and became very disappointed with the camera at all ISO settings.,1,1
1012,2,11,Shooting a burlesque event in a darkly lit club with my fastest lenses produced unbelievable amounts of chroma noise.,1,1
1012,2,12,Chroma noise is to be expected in situations like this, but this camera was on a whole other level.,1,1
1012,2,13,The noise made people's faces look like a freckly red and green mess.,1,1
1012,2,14,Processing some of the noise out forced me to take a hit on sharpness and I wound up images I just didn't enjoy looking at.,1,1
1012,2,15,The 400D had softer images of course being a 10.1 MP camera, but finally the noise was under control.,1,1
1013,2,0,The very best Canon for bird photography due to quality, resolution and the 1.6 lens multiplier.,0,0
1013,2,1,The video is great, not quite the same quality as stills, but close enough to look very good in a slideshow next to the stills.,0,0
1013,2,2,The case has survived nearly two years of very hard use, including on beaches, boats, rain ... sheltered as much as possible, but strill used under these conditions.,0,0
1013,2,3,Shooting eight frames per second at 1/2000 sec is great for capturing birds in flight or sports events.,0,0
1013,2,4,The video does not focus after recording is started.,1,1
1014,2,0,You get what you pay for!,0,0
1014,2,1,Compared to the T3i, camera is rock solid, a little heavier, but IMO better especially if you have a longer lens.,0,0
1014,2,2,The camera just sits steady in your hand.,0,0
1014,2,3,Excellent color, crisp photos, 8 frames per minute.,0,0
1014,2,4,Pick the camera for the body you need.,0,0
1014,2,5,Then buy one good lens and grow into other lenses over the years if constrained by a budget.,0,0
1014,2,6,Advice I was told but didn't want to believe up front.,0,0
1014,2,7,The other benefit for me was card format (compact flash).,0,0
1014,2,8,T3i is good, the viewfinder pops out and rotates.,0,0
1014,2,9,Caution though: Max video on T3i is 4 GB.,0,0
1014,2,10,Max video on 7D is the size of the compact flash memory card.,0,0
1014,2,11,This is the 7D kit I opted for.,0,0
1014,2,12,Kit lenses on the T3i and T2i are worthless (low quality - not worth it).,0,0
1014,2,13,No offense to newegg (love them) but pricing wise, Canon, Nikon, and Sony all moving to standard pricing from the mom & pop store to big box.,0,0
1014,2,14,Recommend finding a good local camera store, feel/play with the demo's they have and get their expert,0,0
1014,2,15,Absolutely none.,1,0
1014,2,16,Forgot what I was missing compared to P&S (Point and Shoot).,1,1
1015,2,0,Takes awesome images!,0,0
1015,2,1,It supports a super-fast high speed shooting mode, has an amazing customizable auto-focus system and supports different settings based on the physical orientation of the camera (portrait or landscape for instance.),0,0
1015,2,2,Great viewfinder that auto-illuminates the overlay display in low light conditions.,0,0
1015,2,3,Very good shots at extremely high-ISO without anywhere near as much noise as my last camera.,0,0
1015,2,4,Customizable menu for those options you change most.,0,0
1015,2,5,BIggest con?  Kit lenses.,1,1
1015,2,6,I wish I'd bought this without the kit lenses because it didn't take long for me to purchase pro grade lenses that covered those zoom levels.,1,1
1015,2,7,The kit lenses aren't bad, but they are consumer grade lenses.,1,1
1015,2,8,Only does 3 shot auto-bracketing, but there's workarounds for doing 6 shot bracketing for HDR work.,1,1
1015,2,9,You MUST study how to use this camera - if you just take it out of the box and expect it to work like a point and shoot you'll be sorely disappointed.,1,1
1015,2,10,The auto-focus options alone are enough to confuse the novice.,1,1
1015,2,11,I've owned it for months and still learn something new every photo shoot.,1,1
1016,2,0,initially I was considering DSLR between 7D and 60D.,0,1
1016,2,1,Almost bought 60D because that flip LCD looked so cool!! also same 18 MP, but after considering body construction and shooting speed, I decided to go with 7D. after using it, now I am convinced that I've made a right decision.,0,1
1016,2,2,bought 3 other lens, waiting to get an additional 35mm 1.4L lens which will be so nice!!,0,1
1016,2,3,hmmm if you are loaded go with 5D? just few hundred $ difference at right timing.,1,1
1017,2,0,Incredible features, even more incredible pictures.,0,0
1017,2,1,GPS geo-tagging is helpful.,0,0
1017,2,2,A great step up from my old Sony Alpha 55 (a great camera itself).,0,0
1017,2,3,I love this camera!,0,0
1017,2,4,No tethering (why did they ever drop that feature?), noise picks up at higher ISOs,1,1
1018,2,0,I shoot sports, tennis events and at 8-12 frames a second, this camera has no competition until you get to the Canon 1dx at $7k.,0,1
1018,2,1,Smart camera, will take 3 bracketed shots and combine them for best image.,0,1
1018,2,2,Takes 3D images and outstanding video.,0,1
1018,2,3,Sony makes Nikon sensors btw.,0,1
1018,2,4,limited lens selection but 2 I can suggest are great.,1,0
1018,2,5,Tamron 18-200 3,5-5.6, is inexpensive,compact and does a great job and Sony's own 70-200 f2.8 is pricey but rivals any Canon or Nikor lens and still costs less.,1,0
1019,2,0,Review based on firmware 1.06

Amazing camera for semi-pro's or photo enthusiast that currently has 0 investment with Nikon or Cannon.,0,0
1019,2,1,No other camera TODAY in this price range offers the speed this has, 12fps (and with a ScanDisk Extreme UHS-i, i'm able to flush the buffer quicker to get back to 12fps).,0,0
1019,2,2,Glad i went with the a77, the body is built SO well and the grip is very comfortable on long holds

the non live view is a NON issue.,0,0
1019,2,3,Seriously, every pro review i've seen say if they were stuck with an electronic view finder, this is the one they want.,0,0
1019,2,4,I live by it and my negative to is is that i dont get to use the 921k LCD screen most of the time :(

This isn't your daddy's "kit lens"..its not uncommon to have a lens cost more than cameras but NEVER has a kit lens cost $800!,0,0
1019,2,5,I tried to find where they scratched the "G" off...

Its a sony, so the Video is top notch!,0,0
1019,2,6,at the time of this review;

* unable to snap photo's while recording movie

* without using a very high end media card, the flushing of the buffer is slow.,1,1
1019,2,7,(specially at full quality Raw=Jpeg 12fps)

* the screen articulates well HOWEVER i wish it would swing out to the side for self photos

* i''ve used many Sony Adv Point & shoots and i miss how on the a77 as you turn the dial, it doesn't display what selection your at on the LCD or in the View finder.,1,1
1019,2,8,Meaning your in manual mode but now you want to go into manual video mode, you have to remove the camera from your eye to see the dial, or get used to counting in a direction ;)

* dedicated movie button, my problem is Sony only half thought of a problem.,1,1
1019,2,9,While in photo mode, you can hit this button to start recording movies BUT when in movie mode, you can't take pictures with the shutter button?!?!,1,1
1020,2,0,Build quality is very good
View finder is amazingly sharp
The feel in your hand just works
Menu system simple and user-friendly,0,0
1020,2,1,The only con after almost a year of use is
that more firm ware updates are needed
sooner.,1,1
1021,2,0,Fancy camera but has some significant problems.,0,1
1021,2,1,1.,1,1
1021,2,2,Over and under exposes pictures
2. Flash pops up when not needed
3. Flash pops up and then doesn't fire when needed
4. Movie mode didn't work for some reason.,1,1
1021,2,3,5. Couldn't register online, so called in and ended up taking quite a while on the phone.,1,1
1021,2,4,6.,1,1
1021,2,5,After spending hours on the phone, and the Tier 2 Support person didn't call back as he indicated, I called a few times and finally found out the camera needs to be sent in for repair.,1,1
1021,2,6,I understand that this will take approximately 1 1/2 weeks total time or so.,1,1
1022,2,0,-Flip-out Screen
-Kit 16-50mm f2.8 lens
-Image stabilization in camera 
-HDMI out
-OMLED viewfinder
-Video Quality is Superb.,0,1
1022,2,1,-Deep-red AF illum
-Manual focus assist (when the camera is set to manual focus, the focus of the image is highlighted in red, in realtime, in the viewfinder.),0,1
1022,2,2,-Battery life
-Auto White balance seems off, suggest you set it manually before shooting.,1,0
1022,2,3,-Slow start up time,
-Sluggish menus
-single sd/no Compact Flash.,1,0
1022,2,4,-Smaller lens collection
-Takes a moment to orientate oneself to the camera after using a Canon or Nikon.,1,0
1022,2,5,but its fully customizable so that helps.,1,0
1023,2,0,I didnt buy this camera through Newegg but it had very good image qualities.,0,0
1023,2,1,The video mode actually recorded sound which was a huge plus.,0,0
1023,2,2,The buttons were very user friendly and so was the on screen menu.,0,0
1023,2,3,Very portable size.,0,1
1023,2,4,No viewfinder (i believe thats what its called).,1,1
1023,2,5,You can only see the picture your taking through the LCD screen and because of that I had to get a newer camera when my LCD screen cracked, if it would've had a viewfinder, it could've still been operational with the broken screen.,1,1
1024,2,0,Very user friendly.,0,0
1024,2,1,Easy to use.,0,0
1024,2,2,Heavy.,1,1
1024,2,3,Can't autofocus when recording on HD Video mode.,1,1
1025,2,0,I've paired it with a Tamron 18-250 Di II A18NII zoom lens, a Nikon SB-600 Speedlight and a Patriot Iris 16GB SDHC Flash Card.,0,0
1025,2,1,What this baby will do is just amazing.,0,0
1026,2,0,What can I say about this incredible piece of optical and electronic technology.,0,1
1026,2,1,Uses all Nikon lenses, Light, totally customizable.,0,1
1026,2,2,many shooting, exposure, flash, metering, aperture, speed modes to cover any situation.,0,1
1026,2,3,The auto mode is a good compromise for most offhand shots.,0,1
1026,2,4,Most experienced amateur photographers will use the aperture priority mode.,0,1
1026,2,5,The pictures from this camera are stunning and rival my old F with manual lenses.,0,1
1026,2,6,Took me about 10 hours to learn the commands and options.,1,1
1027,2,0,Pros: Excellent Image Quality
Feels great in my hands
Very Responsive
Loaded with Features,0,0
1027,2,1,Honestly cannot think of any at this point.,1,1
1028,2,0,Just look at all the 5-star (5-egg) ratings.,0,0
1028,2,1,The advantages over the less expensive options would be higher resolution LCD, an extra control wheel, ability to add battery pack with vertical controls, 4.5 fps, built-in focus motor to make use of auto-focus in older Nikon lenses.,0,0
1028,2,2,Battery life is excellent.,0,0
1028,2,3,Maybe price.,1,1
1028,2,4,If you are looking to dabble with a DSLR, you might be better off with a D5000 and kit lens.,1,1
1028,2,5,To really make use of this camera, carrying several lenses does the trick (each at its own price).,1,1
1028,2,6,Weight.,1,1
1028,2,7,This is not a pocket camera and expect neck pain if you are going to try to use it as one.,1,1
1028,2,8,It is meant to shoot pretty much the entire time you are carrying it.,1,1
1028,2,9,Again, a D5000 or something else smaller similar would be more comfortable around your neck all day.,1,1
1028,2,10,Video.,1,1
1028,2,11,It's only real purpose is to use "live view" which is nice when you can't look through the regular viewfinder; it is not a video camera.,1,1
1028,2,12,Flash.,1,1
1028,2,13,The built-in flash pretty much stinks.,1,1
1028,2,14,I don't think I've ever really used it other than to see how bad it really was (but that is typical of ANY camera's built-in flash that I've ever seen).,1,1
1028,2,15,Get a hot shoe mount flash.,1,1
1029,2,0,- Ergonomic design
- Outstanding LCD

1033,2,1,I have a D70s as well and am a wedding photographer.,0,0

1033,2,4,It is going to make weddings a breeze to shoot now.,0,0
1033,2,5,Does not take compact flash memory.,1,1
1033,2,6,This is only a con if you have a bag full of compact flash cards.,1,1
1034,2,0,Controls appear be well thought out, finish seems nice.,0,0
1034,2,1,Got the wrong charger cord - could not even charge the battery AND NO MENTION WAS MADE ON THE PRODUCT PAGE THAT THE CAMERA DOES NOT COME WITH A FLASH CARD AND YOU CANNOT USE IT UNTIL YOU GO BUY ONE!!!! WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF THAT INFORMATION WAS NOTED ON THE PRODUCT PAGE SOMEWHERE???? WHEN I CALM DOWN, GET A FLASH CARD AND THE CORRECT CHARGER CORD, I WILL SUBMIT A MORE THOROUGH REVIEW OF THIS CAMERA.,1,1
1035,2,0,This camera has nearly everything on it that 95% of people would EVER need.,0,0
1035,2,1,Maybe if I were a professional photographer i MIGHT would get a higher end camera with a full frame sensor, but I don't think anyone can tell the difference anyway (I can't),0,0
1035,2,2,ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm................................................................................

Other people get intimidated when you ask them to take a picture of you.,1,1
1035,2,3,So many people are like "Oh man, I don't know how to use your camera, man"  JUST LOOK THRU THE VIEWFINDER AND SNAP THE PICTURE!!!!  "What's a viewfinder?",1,1
1036,2,0,UPgraded from a D40 to this camera works great.,0,0

1042,2,1,but read on,0,0
1042,2,2,Ok, while it does work out of box.,1,0
1042,2,3,The Camera's quality is REALLY poor.,1,1
1042,2,4,And I don't mean the picture quality, I was talking about the actual Camera Quality, in about 4 months of ownership, 2 of the cameras are filled with WATER.,1,1
1042,2,5,Seriously?,1,1
1042,2,6,This is NOT the first time I'm getting Security cameras(for friends, work), this is actually the FIRST TIME that 2 of the 4 cameras failed within 1/2 year.,1,1
1042,2,7,Well it's not cometeply failing, I can see the water got inside the camera and if I take it apart and clean it, it will probably work again.,1,1
1042,2,8,But why would I want to do that when a system that cost about 1/2 the price works for more than a year already?,1,1
1042,2,9,one bad thing buying from Newegg is unlike Am ma SON(filter blocked the word), which allows you to replace it even after 30 Days, No such thing on Newegg.,1,1
1042,2,10,Now I have the option of going thru Samsung's painful RMA process, or just keep the 400-500 bux expensive paperweight and get something else.,1,1
1043,2,0,Really nice looking pictures at 16 Mega Pixels.,0,0
1043,2,1,I mean REALLY nice! (at this price point),0,0
1043,2,2,The memory aboard the unit is so low, you will get only about 3 pictures lol.,1,1

1044,2,1,Uses the standard En-EL3e battery that is shared with other models (D80, D90).,0,1
1044,2,2,This purchase will more than pay for itself, provided you have a photography business.,0,1
1044,2,3,It's kind of heavy compared to a D80 or D90.,1,0
1044,2,4,Definately has more bulk and I will likely get tired of holding it taking action pictures 8 hrs a day.,1,0
1045,2,0,its fun when it works,0,0
1045,2,1,broke within 3 months.,1,1
1045,2,2,i did nothing wrong to it, i was out took a picture, turn it off, within 5 min i turned it back on to take another picture.,1,1
1045,2,3,the whole time it was in hand, and it came up lens errror and never worked since and nikon wouldnt fix it,1,1
1046,2,0,great picture for a company that hasnt paid it taxes in 5 years.,0,0
1046,2,1,but i needed a cheap camera and...... i bought it,0,0
1047,2,0,Got it for $29.99 on BlackFriday deal.,0,0
1047,2,1,Very impressed at first with camera, especially considering the amount paid.,0,0
1047,2,2,Decided to get the GE X500 refurb deal as well for $89.99 as my hands are big which makes control of this camera harder.,0,0
1047,2,3,Gave this cam to wife who took it with her on a trip to Alaska.,0,0
1047,2,4,So after having taken about 30 test photos fine at home, upon arrival in Alaska, camera was dead.,1,1
1047,2,5,Brand new 1.5 Volt Alkaline batteries lasted for maximum of 5 minutes, 1.25 Volt 2900mAh fully recharged batteries did not even sustain enough juice to retract the lens.,1,1
1047,2,6,All signs lead to battery shortage, which might have been original reason why this was a refurbished item.,1,1
1048,2,0,Exceeded expectations for a 30 dollar camera promotion.,0,0
1048,2,1,I like the dial wheel on top of camera instead of having to switch modes thru menu only.,0,0
1048,2,2,Pictures so far seem good and in focus but with any point and shoot, a steady hand is always good.,0,0
1048,2,3,Camera has lots of features and is fun to use.,0,0
1048,2,4,I could nit pick but for 30 dollars it's more than I expected and does the job....good job GE,1,1
1049,2,0,I just got this today ,needed a still shot camera to post some pics in a forum to sell a RC truck ,needed some detailed photos , and this camera did great , easy to use ,anytime you access a function an icon comes up on the LCD screen to show you the changes made , has a slide scale in the screen to show instant zoom setting, and i haven`t tried all the other functions yet but for $43 plus ship this is well worth the money, and i never worry about things breaking ,I`ve been a NewEgg customer for a long time and they have the best customer service and return policy i have ever seen online.,0,0
1049,2,1,From my limited use so far and from basic visual inspection i see no cons to speak of yet.,1,1
1050,2,0,It looks based on features deceptively like a real camera.,0,1
1050,2,1,In just over 100 day and night, macro, full tele, and normal field of view shots, zero showed the resolution of an image of the spec'd resolution, and many were extremely bad.,1,1
1050,2,2,This camera more often than not focused at the wrong distance.,1,1
1050,2,3,The ISO, aperture, and shutter selections in firmware based auto modes were nonsensical and caused avoidable blur or very noisy CCD sensor chroma noise, beyond already poor quality of the sensor.,1,1
1050,2,4,The optical vibration reduction often instead caused doubled images (and eats battery fast).,1,1
1050,2,5,The quality and performance of this model is so bad that it's better to choose between a cel phone or pocket camera, or go up to a legitimate name brand bridge camera that works as its spec's suggest.,1,1
1050,2,6,EXIF data says this model was contract manufactured by General Imaging Co in China.,1,1
1050,2,7,It fails the most basic function of a camera to produce usable image quality, and so none of the features that sound good on paper matter.,1,1
1051,2,0,beautiful pics, fast shutter, low learning curve to navigate the menus,0,0
1051,2,1,biggest, having to manually push the button to open the flash up.,1,1
1051,2,2,and a fully digatal user guide, would have liked to had a manual to take with me when i wanted to change something if i couldnt remember,1,1
1052,2,0,Camera takes nice pictures many settings.,0,0

1054,2,2,Once in a while, the time between photos can be a lil long (4-5sec.),1,1
1055,2,0,I bought this camera just prior to a trip to WDW.,0,0
1055,2,1,It was easy to use without reading the manual.,0,0
1055,2,2,It took excellent pictures as long as nothing was moving including me.,0,0
1055,2,3,After some experimenting I got some excellent low light shots and fireworks shots, althought you have to compensate for lag time.,0,0
1055,2,4,Also I dropped it several times with no apparent effect.,0,0
1055,2,5,Very slow flash recharge time.,1,1
1055,2,6,If your taking pictures that require flash you had better be able to control all aspects of the shot.,1,1
1055,2,7,I found that I missed several good shots because of waiting several seconds fo the flash to recharge.,1,1
1056,2,0,Excellent pictures,
Good battery life with alkalines,
Compact,0,0
1056,2,1,No viewfinder, so can be difficult to view/frame photo in bright conditions,
Rechargeable battery life average to below average,1,1
1057,2,0,Ther are lots of options for the images, but I liketo use it mostly for quick snap shots.,0,0
1057,2,1,The image program does require some reading if your a novice.,1,0
1057,2,2,I kinda picked up some of the useful features after a couple sessions.,1,0
1057,2,3,The red eye reduction settign on the cameradoes not seam to work, so I used the program to fix it.,1,0
1058,2,0,Great camera; bought it for my wife as a gift - half an hour after receiving the camera she was able to take photos - not difficult at all.,0,0
1058,2,1,We have an APO military address; ordered the camera from Newegg and they shipped the parcel via FedEx; FedEx does not deliver to APOs; therefore the parcel was returned to Newegg and they gave me a refund.,1,1
1058,2,2,Then I ordered the same camera from another company for the same price; they shipped it via US Postal Service Priority Mail and I received the parcel within five days.,1,1
1058,2,3,We never received an explanation from Newegg about their method of shipment.,1,1
1058,2,4,If you have an APO address beware, you will not receive your parcel from Newegg.,1,1

1067,2,1,Camera sporadically throws a "card protected" error.,1,1
1067,2,2,No the card is not protected, you have to reset the camera to get it to work.,1,1

1071,2,3,10 shots/sec worked on the tour bus and GPS revealed where each show was taken.,0,0

1073,2,11,Love the High ISO mode for low light pics without flash.,0,0
1073,2,12,Got a free 1GB Pro Duo card with the camera...Thanks, Newegg!,0,0
1073,2,13,Aside from the flash pics, most shots are super clear and bright with beautiful color.,0,0

1073,2,15,Red eye in all flash pictures, but easily fixed with PP.,1,1
1073,2,16,Dust particles will appear in all flash photos as little UFO's in your picture.,1,1
1073,2,17,As long as they aren't covering the subject or faces, I don't mind too much, but they are somewhat annoying.,1,1
1073,2,18,Shipping was a little slow...almost 3 weeks.,1,1
1073,2,19,I live in Italy, but my past Newegg orders got here in less than 10 days, even from CA.,1,1

1074,2,7,4,Simplicity to the operation of the camera is great.,0,0
1074,2,8,People complain about missing manual settings and file types, this camera was not geared for pro photographers.,0,0

1074,2,10,Their cameras cost well over $4k, this is only a couple hundred, stop comparing the two!  5, Water-proof case is available.,0,0
1074,2,11,This is great for taking pictures buy the pool or shallow ends to beachs, but be careful in the ocean:)  6, Includes a setting for 16:9 1080p shots!,0,0
1074,2,12,7,Movie clips are great & you can zoom during filming!,0,0
1074,2,13,1,Even though the battery life is great, it does suck that you have to use a lithium battery owned by Sony.,1,1
1074,2,14,My other bigger Sony offers AA's and their has been a couple times I had to run and grab a set from a local store because my recharables died.,1,1
1074,2,15,2,Because it is compact, they have a proprietary port that includes the USB & A/V cable in one.,1,1
1074,2,16,So if your at a friends house and he doesn't have a Memory card reader and you forgot your cable, you will have to email it to him later.,1,1
1074,2,17,Its a shame they couldn't include a specific port for usb mini like other cameras have.,1,1
1074,2,18,3,Really strong flash.,1,1
1074,2,19,(help cause a lot of the red eye)  You would get better battery life and less red eye if the flash wasn't so strong.,1,1
1074,2,20,You really need to remember to stand back about 10 feet when using the flash, specially in a closed area.,1,1
1074,2,21,4,This is just a gripe but I hate it when companys release their own battery with a charger and then offer to sell you another charger that does it in 1/2 the time!,1,1
1075,2,0,1. Camera's ccd sensor take crisp, vibrant photos.,0,0
1075,2,1,2. Image stablization really saves most of my photos from being blurred and unrecognizable.,0,0

1075,2,3,Cable also has hookups for TV and includes sound.,0,0
1075,2,4,4. Ginormous LCD screen is great to review shots and weed out the bad ones.
5. Built in Macro function is great.,0,0
1075,2,5,Saves me from buying a $500 lens for my DSLR.,0,0
1075,2,6,1. Camera only takes photos as JPEG's, no RAW.,1,0
1075,2,7,2.,1,0
1075,2,8,Even though it is set on fine detail and large file mode, resolution is at 72dpi.,1,1

1075,2,10,Picture quality starts to degrade after 8x10's or larger.,1,1
1075,2,11,3. Must remove the battery in order to charge it in the battery charger.,1,1
1075,2,12,There is an optional charging cord if you wish to purchase it.,1,1
1075,2,13,4.,1,1
1075,2,14,There is no one button feature to change the exposure setting or metering.,1,1
1075,2,15,Must be manually changed each time in the menu.
5. MS Pro Duo [small version of a regular MS stick] is not a widely accepted memory.,1,1
1075,2,16,Find myself using the adaptor way too much in order for it to fit in most, if not all, memory card readers.,1,1
1075,2,17,And memory is still expensive, byte-for-byte, compared to other memory types out there.,1,1
1076,2,0,great camera overall.,0,0
1076,2,1,amazing display.,0,0
1076,2,2,Ease of use.,0,0
1076,2,3,decent picture quality [even without flash and image doesnt get much blurry as with other ultracompact cameras].,0,0
1076,2,4,great battery life.,0,0
1076,2,5,most people says the camera is fairly small.,1,1
1076,2,6,i find it to be somewhat thick for an ultracompact.,1,1
1076,2,7,Wish they had more optical zoom and manual features and voice recording {casio EXZ-750, EXZ-850, EXZ-1000 have tons of manual features and voice recording}.,1,1
1076,2,8,slide cover adds extra thickness to the camera; sony should drop the slides and use a cover right on top of the lense to decrease the thickness of the camera.,1,1
1077,2,0,You will have this camera with you so you will be able to capture all the images that usually get away.,0,0
1077,2,1,Because of its wonderfully small size it is easy to carry constantly.,0,0
1077,2,2,I've always had a larger camera before now and would leave it at home because it was hard to carry around - so I missed many shots where I said "I wish I had my camera with me.",0,0
1077,2,3,Now that won't happen!!! Yeah!!!,0,0
1077,2,4,Not only that, but it takes great pictures!,0,0
1077,2,5,I bought it for a trip out west and came home with almost 800 photos, of which only 2 or 3 were blurry.,0,0
1077,2,6,And those were my fault due to a shaky hand.,0,0
1077,2,7,I love the ease of use and the fact that I can always have it there when I need it.,0,0
1077,2,8,Shots taken in the dark can be a little noisy but the convenience of this small camera outweighs this.,1,1
1078,2,0,I was going to buy this camera ans as soon as Newegg see people are rating the product, they raise the price.,0,1
1078,2,1,Newegg raised the price.,1,1
1079,2,0,Much smaller then I expected.,0,0
1079,2,1,Takes great pictures and has alot of different modes and functions.,0,0
1079,2,2,The  screen looks amazing!,0,0
1079,2,3,Plenty of different modes including: fireworks, snow, beach, twilight, etc.,0,0
1079,2,4,When taking pictures at night, without going to a different mode,    its a little hard to take pictures  because the screen is so dark, but this doesn't take away from the camera,1,1
1080,2,0,I decided to get this camera over the N1 touch screen because of the many reviews online.,0,1
1080,2,1,Also to change the settings on the N1 can be a challenge because of the touchscreen, for example to change the flash it takes 3-4 different taps/screens whereas with the T30 you only need to touch the button twice.,0,1
1080,2,2,Sony has drastically improved low light picture taking, I was at a performance and I was able to take amazing pictures even with a unsteady hands.,0,1
1080,2,3,MAKE SURE TO GET THE EXTENDED WARRANTY THROUGH NEWEGG BECAUSE SONY SUCKS AT REPAIRING, MY DIGITAL CAMERA BEFORE THIS WAS NEVER PROPERLY FIXED BY SONY!,0,1
1081,2,0,Checked out the competition, the only contender was from Can** and
it was too small and felt like a toy.,0,0
1081,2,1,This things takes superb pictures.,0,0
1081,2,2,Excellent and fast autofocus.,0,0
1081,2,3,Don't know what others are talking about, maybe they should read the man.,0,0
1081,2,4,or take more time to pratice.,0,0
1081,2,5,The only gripes I have are:
1. Flash charge too slow.,1,1
1081,2,6,Does not matter to me, as I hate using a flash anyway.,1,1
1081,2,7,2. Battery life is okay.,1,1
1081,2,8,The tradeoff is you only need 2 AA batteries.,1,1
1081,2,9,Expect 300+ shots out
of a fully charged set.,1,1
1082,2,0,The movies are better than my JVC DV, and twice as long.,0,0
1082,2,1,This supports up to 32 gigabyte cards.,0,0
1082,2,2,I got a 4 GB card to work nicely.,0,0
1082,2,3,The clarity of the photos matches the Nikon D80 easily.,0,0
1082,2,4,The zoom should be called a hyper zoom.,0,0
1082,2,5,The camera hooks up to the computer and acts as a USB hard drive.,0,0
1082,2,6,There is a wall adapter you can get (you will need it because the batteries last about 45 min shooting continuously) (you can video up to 3 hours of video in one setting.),0,0
1082,2,7,It's nice to have such a fantastic zoom and clarity on video for a change.,0,0
1082,2,8,The focus mechanism takes forever.,1,1
1082,2,9,During a performance, my photos only included the performer's backs (they turned after I clicked shoot).,1,1
1082,2,10,I held down the focus button half way, then clicked all the way and it still took over two seconds to shoot.,1,1
1082,2,11,(it would refocus every time, although the manual says otherwise.),1,1
1083,2,0,I really love this camera its light and easy to use, I just took it out of the box put the batteries in and I was set to go.,0,0
1083,2,1,I love the zoom on the camera that was one of the reasons why I picked this camera or I would have bought the sony T-50.,0,0
1083,2,2,The pictures I took outside were great I could even see the LCD screen without any problem with the sun being out, and in doors the pictures were just as good too.,0,0
1083,2,3,I went out this week and bought a camera bag and more batteries and a filter to protect the lens and a memory stick.,0,0
1083,2,4,And with everything I bought and what came  out of the box I put into the bag and its so light to carry I know I will be bringing the new camera everwhere I go just to use it.,0,0
1083,2,5,too bad my video camera will be sitting home more now.,0,0
1084,2,0,Great camera for novice/non-professional photography.,0,0
1084,2,1,This camera takes fantastic out of the box pictures, and can be adjusted easily.,0,0
1084,2,2,The video camera is excellent as well.,0,0
1084,2,3,The camera can theoretically support up to 32 gigabyte duo memory sticks.,0,0
1084,2,4,I added a San Disk 4 GB card which works well.,0,0
1084,2,5,Sony will tell you it cannot support greater than 2 GB, but that is because Sony does not make greater than 2 GB.,0,0
1084,2,6,The camera can copy about one photo per second to the computer.,0,0
1084,2,7,Also, get the SONY double AAs.,0,0
1084,2,8,They are a special voltage and rating (2500 I think with 1.2 volt.),0,0
1084,2,9,Otherwise, you will replace the batteries every 20 minutes.,0,0
1084,2,10,This camera will not even fire-up with regular batteries.,0,0
1084,2,11,The Sony batteries literally last three to four hours of constant use.,0,0
1084,2,12,They take six hours to charge with the provided charger.,0,0
1084,2,13,Buy at least four to six batteries.,0,0
1084,2,14,It also lets you see what you photograph through the lens.,0,0
1084,2,15,The 3" LCD hardly affects the battery life compared to the eyepiece LCD.,0,0
1084,2,16,This is not an SLR camera, which means that even though it is rated over 400 ISO, don't expect your photos to be crystal clear.,1,1
1084,2,17,They will be "grainy" in low light.,1,1
1084,2,18,The only effective difference between this camera and the H1 is the LCD display size.,1,1
1084,2,19,The 7.2 vs 6.0 mega-pixel  really does not matter except for outside well lit photos.,1,1
1084,2,20,There is not much difference because of this camera's focus.,1,1
1084,2,21,It has poor control over manual focus, although the auto-focus is very precise.,1,1
1084,2,22,This camera is fantastic at being point and shoot.,1,1
1084,2,23,The video camera part is much better than my JVC DV camera, taking MP2 video at 30 frames per second at 640x480 for the entire duration of the memory stick (4 gig).,1,1
1085,2,0,I have previously owned the mavica floppy model and most recently the mavica CD-R model.,0,0
1085,2,1,They always took awesome pictures and were reliable when they weren't dropped.,0,0
1085,2,2,they were self explanatory to use and Sony has not let me down with this camera.,0,0
1085,2,3,It takes awesome pictures and is just as easy to use.,0,0
1085,2,4,I figured out the buttons in seconds, navigated the setup menus, piece of cake.,0,0
1085,2,5,I am a techie by day, but I would recommend this camera to anyone.,0,0
1085,2,6,Sony has not let me down yet!,0,0
1086,2,0,I bought my H5 a few monthes ago.,0,0
1086,2,1,I have taken it to colorado and new mexico; the pictures were nothing less than outstanding.,0,0
1086,2,2,From the darkest of dark to the brightest day, this camera can make the best of everything.,0,0
1086,2,3,The 3" screen is also nice and it has a high resolution.,0,0
1086,2,4,The image stabilitzation works great; I took a picture of a moving AWAK plane in the sky at 12x and it was crystal clear.,0,0
1086,2,5,The shutter speed settings are handy, I have taken cool 30 sec.,0,0
1086,2,6,pictures of the milky way to 1000/sec pictures of Nascar.,0,0
1086,2,7,This camera is BIG, you have to carry it by a strap.,1,1

1087,2,5,The flash is so powerful it washed out subject.,1,1
1088,2,0,Fast Startup, Fast focusing, Easy to use, and overall takes very good pictures with a lot of settings and options available.,0,0
1088,2,1,Nice lightweight camera for it's size.,0,0
1088,2,2,Even though this camera is somewhat bigger than many the placement of the buttons takes some getting used to.,1,1
1088,2,3,In use, it's easy to accidently hit a button and change the camera's settings.,1,1
1088,2,4,Also the purple fringing that has been reported at high zoom settings is real and in some situatons quite prominent i.e.,1,1
1088,2,5,I took a close up picture of my wife and it looked like she had blue eyes instead of brown!,1,1

1090,2,4,The pictures DO get distorted at night.,1,1
1090,2,5,-Big one- The USB plug is at the bottom, which means you have to choose which side (the front or back) to lay the camera on when plugging it in.,1,1
1090,2,6,If you choose the back, you risk scratching the screen.,1,1
1090,2,7,If you lay it on the front, the lens deploys when you unplug the USB, and that strains the motor.,1,1

1092,2,4,Love it!,0,0
1092,2,5,The only thing bad I found about this camera is when shooting at night.,1,1
1092,2,6,The camera comes with settings for at night, but they blur almost everytime if not using a tripod.,1,1
1092,2,7,Its fine at night if you use the auto foucus setting instead of the night settings.,1,1
1093,2,0,The 7.1 MP [effective], TINY size, tons-o-features, built in memory, high ISO, adaptive capabilities [lenses, etc],0,1

1094,2,8,however you can still do the iso and so on.,1,1
1094,2,9,They made this digi soooo small it uses all proprietory plugs and i could not use my exsisting sony mem stick with this i had to trade with my friend to get his mini mem stick.,1,1
1094,2,10,oh also it uses a nice lith battery but you cannot use AA if it runs out.,1,1
1094,2,11,oh well the battery last longer than i need.,1,1
1095,2,0,This was my first digital camera purchase, and thus fay I've felt pretty comfortable with the basic functions:  taking photos, uploading images, choosing features, etc..  I've read the manual, and it was pretty straight-forward.,0,0
1095,2,1,The battery takes a couple hundred photos before the charge begins to decline; but I'm planning on purchasing an additional battery.,0,0
1095,2,2,No case or power cable included.,1,1
1095,2,3,There's built-in memory, one battery and a wall charger included in the package.,1,1

1097,2,4,Took a trip to Austria and took 650+ photos and video clips with about 750 mb to spare.,0,0
1097,2,5,Kinda thick but with all the features and zoom, you can't complain.,1,1
1097,2,6,The only downside is you can't zoom in/out once you start capturing a video clip.,1,1
1097,2,7,Battery life wasn't bad if you're not constantly reviewing stuff.,1,1
1098,2,0,I didn't buy this camera here at Newegg but this camera is awesome camera.,0,0
1098,2,1,Better than my old Nikon 5.1 megapixel.,0,0
1098,2,2,The pictures are crystal clear and the video quality is pretty good too.,0,0
1099,2,0,Nice looking camera.,0,0
1099,2,1,Lots of features.,0,0
1099,2,2,Hopefully, Newegg will be up to their usual selves and replace it quickly,0,0
1099,2,3,LCD screen failed almost immediately (but is turned on, can be seen faintly if placed under very bright light).,1,1
1099,2,4,And then the zoom jammed and could not be put back in service.,1,1
1099,2,5,From then on hardware error code upon start and camera out of commission.,1,1
1100,2,0,great quality pictures, easy to use, big lcd,,0,0

1102,2,2,I bought the 2gig memory upgrade and can have over 600 pictures or over an hour of very high quality video.,0,0
1102,2,3,Fit and finish is very high-end, solid, feels great in the hand, perfect weight, makes it a joy to take pictures.,0,0
1102,2,4,Couldn't be happier,0,1
1102,2,5,Absolutely none!,1,1
1102,2,6,I feel like I got a tremendous deal, best value for money out there!,1,1
1103,2,0,Very long battery life.,0,1
1103,2,1,Easy navigation between modes.,0,1
1103,2,2,The screen displays a small description of the mode so you don't have to just go by the small picture.,0,1
1103,2,3,Shoots pretty decent video with sound.,0,1
1103,2,4,None yet but I haven't experimented with too many motion shots.,1,1
1104,2,0,Excellent battery life, super-fast start-up time!,0,0
1104,2,1,Shot over 300 pictures at a wedding and didnt even use half the battery life.,0,0
1104,2,2,HUGE display at 2.5"! Manual features appreciated - great user interface describes what each mode is used for.,0,0
1104,2,3,Video works well with good quality.,0,0
1104,2,4,Instead of a soft LCD screen, it has a hard plastic over the LCD screen which causes it to scratch very easily.,1,1
1104,2,5,Also, the review button is a bit cumbersome - small and up in the corner next to the tiny optical viewfinder.,1,1
1104,2,6,However I got used to it very quickly after using it a few times.,1,1
1105,2,0,Very happy about this camera.,0,0
1105,2,1,Nice colors, sharp pictures.,0,0
1105,2,2,Excellent features for this price.,0,0
1105,2,3,I found the ISO 1000 totally useless.,1,1
1106,2,0,Doesn't cost much, has a sleek and small design.,0,1
1106,2,1,The camera has too low of a shooting speed.,1,0
1106,2,2,I took it to a collegiate track meet and found a lot of the photos blurry.,1,0
1106,2,3,Other times I'd attempt to take a shot of someone running but the camera took too long to shot.,1,0
1107,2,0,- Compact
- Easy to use
- Rechargable battery
- Long battery life
- Great picture quality
- Large LCD display,0,0
1107,2,1,- Proprietary flash memory format
- Play button for viewing pictures is small and difficult to press.,1,1
1108,2,0,just not feel good about this camera.,1,1
1108,2,1,might spend more money to get a canon.,1,1
1109,2,0,Ultra-slim design, 2.5 LCD screen, 32mb built-in memory, up to ISO 1000, fast start up time, looks great, built-in menus are good for those unknown image settings (on the rotary dial), image quality, optical viewfinder,  also good for videos,0,1
1109,2,1,Big screen means more prone to scratches, 32mb isn't enough so that means buying a memory stick, lag when flash is on, rotary dial gets out of position easily, highest video quality needs a big memory stick, ISO 1000 has too much noise, memory stick/battery slot is on the weaker side, plastic build may feel cheap at times, the playback button is above the screen, making it common to smudge your thumb all over the screen,1,1
1110,2,0,This camera is pretty nice.,0,0
1110,2,1,The quality of the photos is excellent (I'd hope so for a 6mp camera), and the camera itself is sleek in design.,0,0
1110,2,2,Light weight, small dimensions.. you get the gist.,0,0
1110,2,3,I purchased a 2gb Memory Stick Pro DUO which holds around 370 compressed, 6mp pictures.,0,0
1110,2,4,The only thing that irritates me about the camera is memory stick/battery slot.,1,0
1110,2,5,The cover is so flimsy, I'm afraid I'm going break it every time I open it.,1,1
1111,2,0,great picture quality, colors, LCD.,0,0
1111,2,1,All the basic stuff is good.,0,0
1111,2,2,I find the focusing is quite slow and sometimes does not focus even in decent lighting.,1,1
1111,2,3,The focus lamp helps but not always.,1,1
1112,2,0,Great pictures.,0,0
1112,2,1,Great Video.,0,0
1112,2,2,Ease of use.,0,0
1112,2,3,Requires dock for syncronization rather than ordinary USB cable.,1,1

1114,2,0,Newegg was prompt and their price is competitive.,0,0
1114,2,1,The camera is user friendly in my location.,0,0
1114,2,2,I am deployed in Iraq and needed a good camera that I could use one handed.,0,0
1114,2,3,It fit the requirements for that.,0,0
1114,2,4,But it has problems in less that 45 days,0,0
1114,2,5,Camera has lost the ability to download pictures.,1,1
1114,2,6,After several attempts to work with Sony and their Instant message help desk and ending up frustrated and of no help what so ever.,1,1
1114,2,7,all from my location in IRAQ 
The camera took good photos but I can't down load them from the camera through the cradle provided by Sony.,1,1
1114,2,8,It is not a software problem.,1,1
1114,2,9,I tried a friends camera and everything worked.,1,1
1114,2,10,I could not get Sony to pay attention when I told them that.,1,1
1114,2,11,They just read thru their script about turning the camera on  and so forth.,1,1
1114,2,12,Lastly the only way to download  when on the road is to carry all of the charger cradle and cords with you.,1,1
1114,2,13,They have no usb cord to use on the road.,1,1
1114,2,14,Or buy more equipment and pull the memory out of the camera.,1,1
1115,2,0,This camera has a great size, great image quality, and great video quality.,0,0
1115,2,1,I was looking for something that could take good videos and good still images, all in one package.,0,0
1115,2,2,This camera is definitely the thing i was looking for, it's not big either.,0,0
1115,2,3,It's a perfect size.,0,0
1115,2,4,I paired this up with my 2GB MSPD, and wow, i love it.,0,0
1115,2,5,Not too many, just get a memory stick and you're good to go.,1,1
1115,2,6,That's probably the only con i can think of, that it doesn't come with at least a 64mb stick.,1,1
1116,2,0,In case it isn't obvious, this camera is all about style.,0,0
1116,2,1,The week I got it, I took it with me to a party, keeping it in my pocket at the beginning of the night.,0,0
1116,2,2,Towards the end I was snapping shots and video of everyone, and I do not think I missed one person who did not compliment how "cool" it looked or asked me how much I paid for it.,0,0
1116,2,3,I of course told them to check out Newegg for the best price!,0,0
1116,2,4,The quality of these pictures with the appropriate settings are amazing!,0,0
1116,2,5,I thought my old dsc-p52 3.2 mp camera had good enough quality for me, but I now have a new standard.,0,0
1116,2,6,I did some up close shots of my mouse and keyboard to see how fine the detail was, and whenever I had a steady hand, the results were very satisfying.,0,0
1116,2,7,I really love that I have a high quality camera and mini "camcorder" in the palm of my hand whenever I go out, and don't want to lug my DVD300 around.,0,0
1116,2,8,This camera is very versatile, especially when paired with a high capacity memory stick duo!,0,0
1116,2,9,I thought the camera quality would be better, but I just had too high of an expectation.,1,1
1116,2,10,They aren't bad by any means, and can definitely replace an old camcorder's quality.,1,1
1117,2,0,Great quality pictures, more MP than you're ever likely to need, Leica lens.,0,0
1117,2,1,Camera has a solid feel to it and looks professional.,0,0
1117,2,2,Intelligent Auto mode is noticeably better than regular point-and-shoot modes of other cameras.,0,0
1117,2,3,Other modes give you somewhat more control than some comparable cameras for more advanced users.,0,0
1117,2,4,Excellent for macro photography!,0,0
1117,2,5,720p HD video recording.,0,0
1117,2,6,SDHC support.,0,0
1117,2,7,Great camera overall.,0,0
1117,2,8,This is the one I'd take when I don't want to haul the SLR but still want quality pictures.,0,1
1117,2,9,Can get some digital noise in higher ISO modes, as all compact digital cameras.,1,1
1117,2,10,This one might be a little worse than some in low light without flash, but I don't have that much experience with other cameras.,1,1
1117,2,11,For casual shooting the flash works fine, otherwise a small tripod will solve most low-light issues.,1,1
1117,2,12,Be aware though that the tripod mount is all the way on the side of the camera, which may cause the smallest tripods to topple over.,1,1
1117,2,13,No viewfinder might disappoint some people but wasn't a deal-breaker for me in a compact camera.,1,1
1118,2,0,Leica Summicron optics, excellant wide angle capability, and terrific menu varieties.,0,0
1118,2,1,Manual controls, and the ability to  add a Leica spotting scope if you want some extreme high-quality zoom; 2000-3000 mm if  your feet are too-sore for letting your walking do the zoom.,0,0
1118,2,2,The smaller size is a huge plus from bulky dslr's.,0,0
1118,2,3,Leica optics can attract any image faster than  other makers of optics, regardless of the aperature used.,0,0
1118,2,4,Panasonic makes Leica optics affordable.,0,0
1118,2,5,After 40 years,  I am finally able  to get off the Nikon/Cannon bandwagon.,0,1
1118,2,6,I shopped elsewhere, because Newegg is just now marketing the LX-3.,1,1
1119,2,0,What great glass; the sharp, f/2 fast, 24mm wide lens is a standout at any size and true stunner on a compact.,0,1
1119,2,1,Smart features like user-settable auto-ISO limits, live historgrams, and aperture priority mode shooting make this a true photographers compact, but it still works great as a pure fully-automatic point-and-shoot.,0,1
1119,2,2,RAW capture, manual control, and outstanding build quality compete the package.,0,1
1119,2,3,While very small, the camera is still not really pocketable.,1,1
1119,2,4,The adapter tube for filters adds considerable bulk.,1,1
1119,2,5,The lack of an optical viewfinder exacerbates battery life issues, and the accessory viewfinder is absurdly expensive.,1,1
1119,2,6,Manual controls are a bit awkward.,1,1
1119,2,7,The optical zoom is limited, so you you find yourself making much use of a long zoom this might not be the right choice for you.,1,0
1120,2,0,This is a great camera period.,0,0
1120,2,1,Any small camera takes a while to get used to, so don't be so quick to judge this one.,0,0
1120,2,2,I use it in the mountains and on building job sites.,0,0
1120,2,3,Great depth of field with fast F2.0 24mm lens, excellent LCD screen, good white balance, decent flash, LOTS of manual controls, good battery life, and good OS features.,0,0
1120,2,4,This is not a con so much as a feature request: The only thing keeping this camera from a 5 star rating is the short optical zoom.,1,1
1120,2,5,Here's hoping the LX4 bumps it up to 5x of so.,1,1
1120,2,6,Like any P&S, in bright snowy conditions, its hard to see the screen controls (particularly if you wear polarized sun glasses).,1,1
1120,2,7,Like any small camera, its almost impossible to shoot with gloves on ... even thin liner gloves -  the buttons are just too small when conditions are cold.,1,1
1120,2,8,Have not shoot any video with this camera so can't say much about that.,1,1
1121,2,0,Zoom, can save in RAW,0,0
1121,2,1,Worked for about 200 pictures then started having exposure issues in all different modes.,1,1
1121,2,2,Problems got persistently worse as more pictures were taken.,1,1
1122,2,0,We bought this camera because our dog destroyed our older camera.,0,0
1122,2,1,It is a very good camera, slight barrel distortion at close up, wide angles.,0,0
1122,2,2,Awesome battery life.,0,0
1122,2,3,Very easy to use for beginner or hobbyist.,0,0
1122,2,4,Lots of features.,0,0
1122,2,5,We are not a "home video" family per say, but  we do like having short videos shot with our digital camera.,1,1
1122,2,6,Our older camera had decent video quality but great sound.,1,1
1122,2,7,This camera has excellent video but very poor sound.,1,1
1122,2,8,I am quite disappointed with that because it is such a great camera otherwise.,1,1
1123,2,0,Great zoom, clear photos, great lens, long battery time, lots of manual options, lots of preset options as well.,0,0
1123,2,1,1/2000 sec shutter speed max, 60sec exposure time max.,0,0
1123,2,2,720p HD video.,0,0
1123,2,3,Good close up/macro capability.,0,0
1123,2,4,Lots of other pros I can't think of right now.,0,1
1123,2,5,Works well with Raynox 250 super macro lens.,0,1
1123,2,6,Maxes out at 8f but that's not horrible for a compact/point and shoot.,1,1
1123,2,7,The sound is extremely muffled sounding.,1,1
1123,2,8,Camera doesn't come with lens converter for add on lenses.,1,1
1123,2,9,This review is for the product itself.,1,1
1123,2,10,That's why I gave it 5 stars.,1,1
1123,2,11,For shipping, I paid 27 bux for next day fedex and it took 5 days to receive it.,1,1
1123,2,12,Newegg reimbursed me 20 bux of the shipping cost though.,1,1
1124,2,0,Superb photos; superior Leica designed lens with true 27mm wide angle; excellent optical image stabilization; effective face recognition algorithm; very light weight; RAW+JPEG capability, custom white balance settings; very good battery life; large and bright LCD screen and decent EVF; HD Video recording; improved sensor for low light sensitivity (still not as good as DSLRs due to the sensor size limitation but heckuva lot better than previous generation models); tons of features.,0,0
1124,2,1,Subjectively, the construction of the camera doesn't feel as stout as the comparable models from Fujifilm and Canon, but at this price, it's a terrific bargain for all it's features and I would cut them some slack about perceived lack of heavy duty build.,1,1
1124,2,2,Low light sensitivity can still be improved upon and there are some concerns regarding poor service reputation with Panasonic company.,1,1
1124,2,3,It's annoying to take off the lens cap before turning on the camera but it's same situation with other superzooms.,1,1
1125,2,0,I have the black version and this camera is great.,0,0
1125,2,1,From the minite u flip the ON switch you realize where your money went.,0,0
1125,2,2,Everything you touch is quick and responsive.,0,0
1125,2,3,Sure there are cheaper point and shoots that get the job done but trust me if you like your camera to respond the precise second you tell it to this is the one.,0,0
1125,2,4,Menus are also quick and responsive.,0,0
1125,2,5,Battery life is massive I could easily take over 400 full resolution pictures on a single battery.,0,1
1125,2,6,And this camera makes it easy to do so.,0,0
1125,2,7,Like other reviewers have said the Auto function is great.,0,0
1125,2,8,It quickly detects faces, or if u need to open the flash etc.,0,0
1125,2,9,It doesn't come with a second battery.,1,1
1125,2,10,Even though one can take a lot of pictures on one battery, the camera makes it so easy to do so that one battery might be insufficient for some.,1,1
1126,2,0,This is a big step up from our 4 year old Olympus.,0,1
1126,2,1,It turns on instantly.,0,1
1126,2,2,Continuous shooting modes work well.,0,1
1126,2,3,The flexible of the lens is amazing.,0,1
1126,2,4,Both the wide angle and telephoto are very useful.,0,1
1126,2,5,It is smaller than I expected and much lighter than I expected.,0,1
1127,2,0,I researched this camera heavily before I bought it.,0,0
1127,2,1,Camera is very light for the size.,0,0
1127,2,2,Intelligent Auto settings are accurate and fool proof.,0,0
1127,2,3,The pictures are sharp and clear even with the digital zoom at full extension.,0,0
1127,2,4,Price was very reasonable considering the huge number of features.,0,0
1127,2,5,Leica lens is excellent  It has many features of a Digital SLR without the painful cost.,0,0
1127,2,6,Lens cannot extend with lens cap on which means that before turning on the camera, remove the cap.,1,1
1127,2,7,Bulky but with a super-zoom, wide angle lens what do you expect?,1,1
1127,2,8,Watch the white saturation when taking indoor flash shots.,1,1
1128,2,0,I did weeks of research before purchasing this camera.,0,0
1128,2,1,I wanted something that takes quality stills, that is small enough for mountain biking, hiking, etc...,0,0
1128,2,2,Honestly, you'd think the pictures this machine takes were from a big camera - because of it's DSLR sized sensor!,0,0
1128,2,3,It takes great low light shots because of the big sensor and mirror-system.,0,0
1128,2,4,Its a tad heavy, which I LIKE, because it doesn't and shouldn't feel cheap.,0,0
1128,2,5,Solid construction, immaculate LCD screen, great starter lens, great battery life, great in-camera processing - for stuff like amazing panorama landscape shots.,0,0

1129,2,1,Oh, and the shutter makes it sound like a big boy camera.,0,0
1129,2,2,Lowest ISO is 200 (though not a noticeable issue), accessories are ridiculously priced (e*Bay for the win!!), has a proprietary accessory port, doesn't support the Sony Remote Commander  (grrr),  no 1080p video, but see below.,1,1
1130,2,0,A lot of features for a low price,0,0
1130,2,1,Broke after 2 months of normal useage with no entry of water or other damage, just stop working after one day of dry usage,1,1

1131,2,2,And takes clear video.,0,0
1131,2,3,This camera fell a total of 17 inches fro ma shelf on my desk above my computer monitor to the main desk surface and broke.,1,1
1131,2,4,The screen would not turn on.,1,1
1131,2,5,Fuji fixed this for free.,1,1
1131,2,6,Still photos are grainy and low quality.,1,1
1131,2,7,If you do manage to get a clear photo the noise takes out all the detail in the photo.,1,1
1131,2,8,My old 10 MP kodak takes better photos than this does.,1,1
1132,2,0,Found that the camera takes great pictures, have taken it on several snorkeling and boating trips, worked brilliantly.,0,0
1132,2,1,For a compact point and shoot, it performed as advertised.,0,0
1132,2,2,The viewing window on the rear of the camera is not protected in any way, and after several vacation trips, this glass is showing wear, scratch marks and possible deterioration.,1,1
1132,2,3,This hasn't affected the quality of the photos, but is noticeable when using the camera.,1,1
1133,2,0,Decent pictures, resistant casing.,0,0
1133,2,1,Never tested the waterproofing but it looked legit.,0,1
1133,2,2,Despite being a "tough" camera, the lens has no shutter or cap.,1,1
1133,2,3,I started seeing tiny scratches on it after just a couple of days using it at my work.,1,1
1133,2,4,Cameras usually always have shutters, so I don't think twice about laying it face down on a desk (it's supposed to be rugged after all...),1,1

1135,2,4,Much to this camera, a newer user might be intimidated.,1,1

1140,2,0,Easy to use layout, lots of features, Light wieght and small can fit in your pocket no problems, pictures show up excellent.,0,0
1140,2,1,Even though pictures show up good in daylight, it really sucks for taking pictures at night, and it takes a little to long for the picture to snap once you press the shutter button.,1,1
1141,2,0,- Nice ergonomic layout

1142,2,1,I have used in in low light, bright light and everything in between and the scene selection sets it all up for you with perfect results.,0,0
1142,2,2,No viewfinder and the LCD screen can be difficult to see in bright daylight.,1,1

1144,2,0,I got the drivers & Adapter installed.,0,1
1144,2,1,Here's what I did:  Executed the Autorun from the CD, clicked Install SuperDVR, kept the default install location.,0,1
1144,2,2,Eexecuted SuperDVR, I get a splash screen, and then error “The operation completed successfully.,0,1
1144,2,3,Then I noticed that Device Manager shows yellow exclamation icon for TD3101_3104 Video/Audio Card.,0,1
1144,2,4,Executed Install Drivers from Start -> Programs -> SuperDVD.,0,1
1144,2,5,Then I decided to plug the Adapter into a different USB port.,0,1
1144,2,6,I use the Wizard to get the adapter installed, then it asks for TD3101_3104AV.sys file (it is located in C:\Windows\System32\drivers).,0,1
1144,2,7,After the install, the Wizard pops-up again (I guess once for the audio, and once for the video).,0,1
1144,2,8,Executed SuperDVR, program loads successfully, but still no video (used 2 different cameras, and tested each of the 4 video input ports).,1,1
1144,2,9,I have a blue screen with “Video Loss” in the center, I can change the settings and bunch of other stuff.,1,1
1144,2,10,But still no video.,1,1
1144,2,11,There's stills some kind of bug cause once in a while I get message “USB card has removed” and the program quits.,1,1
1144,2,12,Running SuperDVR again gives me “Incorrect Version” and program won't load.,1,1
1144,2,13,At this point I rebooted, and I still got “USB Card has Removed”.,1,1
1144,2,14,Then I decided to move the Adapter to a new USB port.,1,1
1144,2,15,Had to do the Windows new Hardware Wizard (twice), and I'm back to the blue screen with “Video Loss”.,1,1
1145,2,0,has 4 video inputs.,0,1
1145,2,1,Easy to find drivers on the manf.,0,1
1145,2,2,site (but the drivers don't work).,0,1
1145,2,3,Usually with cheap electronics it takes an eternity to find the drivers, but this manf.,0,1
1145,2,4,sells; so that's a plus to know that SABRENT somewhat cares about Linux users.,0,1
1145,2,5,But this Video Adapter has no Linux drivers.,0,1
1145,2,6,Does NOT work.,1,1
1145,2,7,I've tried with Ubuntu Linux, Windows XP (2 PCs), and Windows 7; nothing works.,1,1
1145,2,8,Can't remember, but on the off chance that it got installed, when running the program I would get "Execution Completed Successfully, error: 0000", or something like that.,1,1
1145,2,9,Ironic, how can something be distressful when you get an error; I guess the error executed successfully.,1,1
1146,2,0,Under $40, USB, 4 video, Left and Right Audio...,0,1
1146,2,1,1 egg is as low as I can go?,1,1
1146,2,2,This will not work with Windows 7, don't even bother!,1,1
1146,2,3,It does not seem to work with Windows XP either.,1,1
1146,2,4,I even downloaded the drivers from sabrent site, didn't help.,1,1
1146,2,5,W7 had a nice BSOD during one attempt at installation.,1,0
1146,2,6,The software just says "Install failed..." and XP can't find a driver, the hardware may not work.,1,0
1146,2,7,Well, it does not work.,1,0
1147,2,0,Small, light, big screen, high resolution, wide angle lens,0,0
1147,2,1,The incredibly long shutter lag means the subject has long since lost interest or moved out of the frame.,1,1
1147,2,2,The camera insists flash is required for the average light levels of the classroom, but balances the flash very poorly.,1,1
1147,2,3,Photos, even in decent light, have dark backgrounds and bright, flash lit subjects.,1,1
1147,2,4,If you force the flash off, you're guaranteed to get blurry photos unless you're outside on a sunny day.,1,1
1147,2,5,I haven't had any problems with the build quality, but it feels cheap and doesn't seem like it would survive a very large hit.,1,1
1147,2,6,Overall, the lens isn't particularly sharp, exposures are poor, and the shutter lag is frustrating.,1,1
1147,2,7,My smartphone takes better photos.,1,1
1148,2,0,This camera takes great pictures and is very easy to use.,0,1
1148,2,1,I bought it on an email special for $75.,0,1

1148,2,3,I love the fact that I can put it in my shirt pocket wherever I go and take great pictures whenever the occasion occurs.,0,1
1148,2,4,It doesn't come with an sd card, but I had a 32ghc card that holds tons of pictures.,0,1
1148,2,5,I've read other reviews that complain about this camera and I just don't understand them.,0,1
1148,2,6,The HD video it takes is awesome.,0,0
1148,2,7,Sound quality is good also.,0,0
1148,2,8,I've heard complaints about battery life so before it even came I searched around and got 2 more batteries with an external charger that works on a/c and auto power and the whole thing only cost me $7!
14 MP with 10X optical zoom and super low price.,0,1
1148,2,9,How can you go wrong?,0,1
1148,2,10,The only con I can think of is that when you use the zoom while making videos it doesn't record sound, but as long as you intelligently use the zoom while recording videos, it's not that bad.,1,1
1149,2,0,Great pictures, easy to use, fast start times.,0,0
1149,2,1,Easy to handle,0,0
1149,2,2,It eats batteries even when not turned on.,1,1
1149,2,3,I have use rechargeable and regular AA, it eats both.,1,1
1149,2,4,I will put new batteries in and take a few pictures.,1,1
1149,2,5,Two weeks latter, I will turn on the camera and it will be dead.,1,1
1149,2,6,I need to take the batteries out to make it work.,1,1
1150,2,0,Incredible pictures, almost 3-d, high megapixel count for easy cropping; best lens on any camera under $1,000, except equal to other  higher end Kodaks; great mp4 movie mode with zoom; small; well built; no lens cap to get in the way; great scene choices; SD cards, rechargeable AA batteries; etc.,0,0
1150,2,1,No dedicated on/off switch like the Kodak Z612; no image stabilization; no viewfinder.,1,1
1151,2,0,Pros:
1. Price is outstanding.,0,1
1151,2,1,2. 5x optical zoom.,0,1
1151,2,2,3. Small size.,0,1
1151,2,3,4. Manual control of aperture and shutter speed for advanced control (if wanted).
5. 8 Megapixle.,0,1
1151,2,4,6. Movie mode takes much less space than most of competition, and produces great clips, thanks to mp4 encoding.,0,1
1151,2,5,Cons*:
1. High ISO settings not the best as a lot of detail is lost at ISO 400 and 800.
2. Color is not very accurate, a little too bright and 'punchy'.,1,1
1151,2,6,To some it looks great to purists, a little artificial.,1,1
1151,2,7,3.,1,1
1151,2,8,No image stabilization.,1,1
1152,2,0,Nice features and ease of use.,0,0

1153,2,6,It also automatically determines the best composition for photos with green lines on the screen.,0,0
1153,2,7,The panaroma mode allows you to take three pictures next to each other and it will automatically stitch them together.,0,0
1153,2,8,There is absoulutely nothing wrong with this camera.,1,0
1153,2,9,It is amazing and I use it daily.,1,0
1153,2,10,Unless you're a serious photographer, this is a flawless camera.,1,0
1154,2,0,Great pictures, Easy to use, perfect for the average Joe.,0,0

1155,2,0,Awesome picture quality.,0,0
1155,2,1,Great bang for your buck!,0,0
1155,2,2,I love the panorama mode, and it also takes very descent videos.,0,0
1155,2,3,The quality is much better than I anticipated.,0,0
1156,2,0,Takes excellent pictures under most conditions.,0,1
1156,2,1,The video is also better than expected even on a cloudy day.,0,1
1156,2,2,Takes photos faster than my Nikon 7600 which means more shots.,0,1
1156,2,3,Just packed with features.,0,1
1156,2,4,The "green" led for focusing is a plus because it doesn't scare the animals like the red one does!,0,1
1156,2,5,And it is only momentary and not as bright as one person had mentioned.,0,1
1156,2,6,Don't know of any.,1,1
1156,2,7,The battery power actually lasts much longer than it does in my Nikon 7600!,1,0
1157,2,0,camera takes consecutive pictures very quickly,0,1
1157,2,1,the automated software on this camera is terrible.,1,1
1157,2,2,the week i owned this camera it did not take a single picture not worth deleting.,1,1
1157,2,3,i was able to maually change settings to get decent pictures, but this took as much as 5 minutes for each new enviroment.,1,1
1157,2,4,the pixels on the lcd are as large as my fingernails making pictures unviewable,1,1
1158,2,0,I have previously taught photography, including large format work, at the college level and am very demanding.,0,0
1158,2,1,The optical quality of the Kodak z760 is very high and in fact demonstrably out-performs more expensive cameras with theoretically higher sensor resolution.,0,0
1158,2,2,Noise level is very low under daylight conditions.,0,0
1158,2,3,Good manual control capabilities in all areas except manual focus (most of the time either the macro or infinity settings will solve problem focus situations).,0,0
1158,2,4,Auto exposure and auto color balance work well and auto exposure bracketing is an easy way around tricky lighting situations.,0,0
1158,2,5,Although not fancy, the Kodak z760 performs better optically than most comparable cameras that I have reviewed and is one of the best buys in this price range.,0,0
1158,2,6,Enlargements up to 13"x19" show excellent detail, color and low noise.,0,0
1158,2,7,Shutter response time can be quite fast although picture to picture speeds are a little slow.,0,0
1158,2,8,None, really, except for the lack of a RAW file format capability.,1,1
1158,2,9,In fact, I bought a second one as a spare.,1,1
1159,2,0,This camera has a really decent battery life with the included Lithium-ion battery pack.,0,1
1159,2,1,You can pick up other battery picks with even higher capacity for relatively cheap if need be, and the charge time is 3 hours, which isn't bad.,0,1
1159,2,2,The user interface is of course, easy to use and well thought out.,0,0
1159,2,3,Screen is good size (over 2 inches) and doesn't drain as much battery as you would think.,0,1
1159,2,4,Picture quality is terrific, especially in outdoor invironments with good natural light.,0,1
1159,2,5,I thought the flash may have been just a little weak for indoor invironments considering the quality of everything else on the camera, but being a full-fledged professional camera, this one has a lot of ad-ons to buy (one being a flash extender).,0,1
1159,2,6,Camera has different color scenes as well as a custom setting for your own presets.,0,1
1159,2,7,Includes all the little things you'd want in the box to get started.,0,1
1159,2,8,A usb cable, an RCA cable, a battery and charger, a lense cap, software, instruction, etc.,0,1
1159,2,9,I'm not what you would call an "expert" when it comes to cameras, but I felt that the flash was just a little underpowered.,1,0
1159,2,10,Also, I would have really liked for the optical zoom to be 5X instead of 3X, but considering the price, that's really not much of a con, and once again, you can by lenses that extend the optical zoom...or just buy the Z740, which has one less megapixel, but 10X optical zoom.,1,0
1160,2,0,Great Autofocus System.,0,0
1160,2,1,Everyone 7D Canon has made is defective.,0,1
1160,2,2,Canon should issue a recall.,0,1
1160,2,3,Eventually, the camera will stop communicating with any original camera battery.,1,1
1160,2,4,You will have to ship it to Canon and they will charge your $210 to fix it.,1,1
1160,2,5,Google "Canon 7D will not communicate with battery" and you will see that this is a widespread problem.,1,1
1160,2,6,I have been using Canon camera for 30 year but now considering switching to Nikon.,1,1
1161,2,0,I have only had this camera a week and I can tell already that this is a huge step up from my old Canon XTI.,0,0
1161,2,1,The colors pop even in low light at high speed shooting my son playing football.,0,0
1161,2,2,The cost is well worth the upgrade.,0,0
1162,2,0,Excellent AF, brilliant image quality and also comes with an amazing set of features including fast continuous drive, HD video (1080:30p), great battery life and a size and weight that makes great for bird and wildlife photography or a day at the beach.,0,0
1162,2,1,The 100% field of view in the view finder is also a very noteworthy pro.,0,0
1162,2,2,You'll have so much fun with this camera that you'll never want to put it down to enjoy the scenery.,1,0
1163,2,0,I do not own this camera, but as an amateur who just bought the t2i and now am selling it to upgrade to this camera, I have some good advice.,0,1
1163,2,1,Pictures from great lenses only look great when they are in focus.,0,1
1163,2,2,While it is possible to achieve that focus with the t2i, it can be hit and miss.,0,1
1163,2,3,I often find myself using the more accurate center point and recomposing.,0,1
1163,2,4,That's not to say that I haven't gotten some crisp, brilliant pictures out of it.,0,1
1163,2,5,The problem is that I've missed an unacceptable number of good photos.,0,1
1163,2,6,Not full frame.,1,1
1164,2,0,1) Shake Reduction
2) Dust Shake
3) Weather Seal (most <$1000 cameras don't have it)
4) 10 megapixels
5) 3 frames/second - You can shoot JPEGs at 3 f/s until your card fills up
6) Kit lens is pretty decent
7) Compatible with any K-mount lens
8) Build quality is awesome
9) 2.5 inch LCD
10) RAW
...The list goes on...,0,0
1164,2,1,The bottom line unless you're willing to dish out $1100+ you won't find a better camera.,1,1
1165,2,0,Very affordable, high end camera,0,0
1165,2,1,Lens options are limited compared to big 2,1,0
1166,2,0,This alows for stunning image quality where it counts, smooth tonal gradations, and tack sharp images.,0,0
1166,2,1,The 18--55 lens that comes with the kit is one of the best I have ever used.I have 15x22 prints, taken with this outfit and printed on and Epson 4800, that will blow you away.,0,0
1166,2,2,It is much better than my Nikon D2X, which recently found a new home!!This camera and lens combo are the best value on the market bar none.,0,0
1166,2,3,Disclaimer** All images that I have produced using the GX-10 and 18-55 lens were shot in Raw mode, I don't shoot Jpeg.,0,0

1167,2,1,It is kind of frustrating trying to get photos in good focus.,1,1
1167,2,2,It is sometimes difficult to push the shutter just right half way to let the picture focus.,1,1
1167,2,3,I end up pushing it too hard and having to try to redo the picture.,1,1
1168,2,0,It boots up quickly and the display is bright.,0,0
1168,2,1,The viewfinder is a nice feature to have in this class of point-and-shoot camera and those high-capacity SD cards are inexpensive and readily available.,0,0
1168,2,2,As are the AA batteries.,0,0
1168,2,3,The menus are easy to navigate and to use.,0,0
1168,2,4,Windows XP recognized the camera right away without installing the included software.,0,0
1168,2,5,Lower resolution shots were the best.,0,1
1168,2,6,I was expecting virtually perfect pictures, but even my most carefully exposed shots were flawed.,1,1
1168,2,7,Shots taken at the highest resolution were the worse.,1,1
1168,2,8,They were very grainy and lacked vivid detail.,1,1
1168,2,9,Colors were not brilliant.,1,1
1168,2,10,The battery door is easy to open accidentally if not handled carefully.,1,1

1170,2,2,The battery/memory card cover opens easily.,1,1
1171,2,0,A decent camera for the price.,0,1
1171,2,1,I don't need a professional camera so this camera works for me...,0,1
1172,2,0,I'm writing this second review because even after a month of service, this camera is just excellent.,0,1
1172,2,1,I used it on Ubuntu 7.10 and it was recognized instantly; thus the photos were successfully downloaded to the computer.,0,1
1172,2,2,The price I got it for was about six dollars cheaper with a free 1Gb card as of this writing.,0,1
1172,2,3,I have taken many photos while in Egypt and they came out great.,0,1
1172,2,4,This camera has so many useful features I cannot have enough characters to list them.,0,1
1172,2,5,And the case and 1Gb card that comes with this camera at no extra cost is an absolute steal!,0,1
1172,2,6,to list any cons for a camera at this price is just insisting insanity...,1,1
1173,2,0,Camera works great.,0,0
1173,2,1,It's very cheap (I got it for only $99.00, not including tax and shipping & handling), excellent resolution, worked on my ubuntu 7.04 system perfectly.,0,0
1173,2,2,Watch out for the battery release since it's pretty difficult to occidentally open it.,1,1
1174,2,0,Takes excellent pictures, very easy to use.,0,0
1174,2,1,Fits nicely in my pocket and syncs easily with my computer.,0,0
1174,2,2,By far the cheapest of any comparable cameras.,0,1
1174,2,3,Zoom is a little weak at 3x. Included batteries only lasted two days.,1,1
1175,2,0,6.1mp is a huge plus for this price.,0,0
1175,2,1,The zoom is great, and all of the options on this camera are amazing for the price.,0,0
1175,2,2,you can touch up photos, edit videos you've taken, etc. on the camera!,0,0
1175,2,3,great battery life if you have rechargeable NIMH batteries.,0,1
1175,2,4,No case.,1,0
1175,2,5,The microphone is a little weak, but no biggie, after all its not meant for great video.,1,0
1175,2,6,internal memory is very small, but go buy a cheap 256mb SD card and you'll get over 150 picture's worth of space.,1,0
1175,2,7,Also, the software isnt the greatest, but it works.,1,0
1176,2,0,Good quality and easy to use.,0,0
1176,2,1,Takes great pictures for the price.,0,0
1176,2,2,The battery compartment is easy to nudge open accidentally.,1,0
1177,2,0,From what I experience, it can take a few falls no higher that a normal desk.,0,1
1177,2,1,I fell in love with the megapixels and at the time I bought this it seemed like an amazing price for the pictures.,0,0
1177,2,2,Flimsy feeling, too light, friends commmented that it was fugly.,1,1
1177,2,3,Not alot of features.,1,1
1178,2,0,Easy to use interface, blinding AF light, video capability, f/2.8-8.0 range very nice for a Kodak.,0,0
1178,2,1,Its lightweight, and the option to switch between LCD and EVF on a whim is very handy.,0,0
1178,2,2,Blinding AF light, ISO range of 64-400 makes setting up night shots a little tricky.,1,1
1178,2,3,The control knob often accidentally switches from aperture priority to shutter or manual at the slightest touch which can be quite the annoyance.,1,1
1179,2,0,Big resolution, 7.1 MP, can capture quite a lot of detail.,0,1
1179,2,1,I like the colours on the Kodak, they're not faded or too bright.,0,1
1179,2,2,Nice big 2 inch LCD,0,1
1179,2,3,No Image stabilisation.,1,0
1179,2,4,Can't use the 10x zoom without IS, all teh images are blurred.,1,0
1179,2,5,This is the killer reason for me not to keep this camera.,1,0
1179,2,6,What was Kodak thinking?,1,0
1180,2,0,Own several of these cameras and they work great with making good pictures up close or from a distance.,0,1
1180,2,1,Could use a larger camera bag,1,0
1181,2,0,good camera to take pic anywhere, it does the job.,0,1
1181,2,1,was not looking for anything high end.and the kids can use it.,0,1
1181,2,2,looks like it could break if you drop it.,1,1
1182,2,0,Good camera, excellent quality pics, except when zoom,0,0
1182,2,1,Feels too lightweight, 8mb internal memory,1,1
1183,2,0,Camera takes good pictures as long as there's enough daylight.,0,0
1183,2,1,Light weight, and easy to download pictures into your pc.,0,0
1183,2,2,Flash isn't good enough to take clear pictures at night.,1,0
1184,2,0,Very comfortable camera to work with.,0,1
1184,2,1,Things are very logical.,0,1
1184,2,2,The 18-135 mm STM lens does not provide high image quality.,1,1
1184,2,3,This was expected, despite the hype and $550 price.,1,1
1184,2,4,In fact, images are comparable, and sometimes worse, than images taken with old Canon EF-S 18-55 AF lens.,1,1
1184,2,5,Especially bad are images at F=35 mm, at all apertures (compared to old lens).,1,1
1184,2,6,Marginally better images are obtained at F=18 and F=50 mm.,1,1
1184,2,7,Increasing the zoom range twice had a negative effect on image quality.,1,1
1184,2,8,Battery life is less than one would expect, even though the battery is not small.,1,1
1184,2,9,Uses an old sensor, likely from 2009.,1,1
1184,2,10,There are a few bugs in flash's working.,1,1
1184,2,11,The flash tends to fire while switching settings on the camera.,1,1
1185,2,0,touchscreen is SO much faster than the t3i
higher iso
different shutter mechanism than the t3i (T4i sounds just like the 60d, not cheap like the T3i.,0,0
1185,2,1,I think this is the biggest pro, and the main reason I was leaning to the 60d over the t3i... so glad I waited for the t4i!)
stereo mic is actually not bad - big improvement over the t3i
stm lens is amazing
the digic 5 sensor does seem to give better color and image quality / but it is only slightly better
same body style and layout as the t2i and t3i, so older battery grips and accessories with fit nicely.,0,0
1185,2,2,5fps and 20 shot burst at 18mp is nice.,0,0
1185,2,3,at lower res with a fast sdcard, you can shoot until the card is full.,0,0
1185,2,4,this lens is so worth the extra money.,0,0
1185,2,5,shooting video without it is pointless.,0,0
1185,2,6,using this to shoot - among other things - green screen with a teleprompter.,0,0
1185,2,7,The picture quality is amazing - and the progressive capture is a big step up from the interlaced of the prosumer camcorder I had been using.,0,0
1185,2,8,the stm lens is a bit slow, and not happy in low light.,1,0
1185,2,9,but the 25600 iso, f3.5 and a 1 second shutter will get you a 4pm shot at 2am. the grain is surprisingly minor - though VERY noticeable.,1,1
1185,2,10,the audio recording is pretty bad still.,1,1
1185,2,11,the mics are better, but the preamps in the camera are not designed for GREAT quality.. only GOOD quality.,1,1
1185,2,12,pick up an external audio recorder to help with the audio.,1,1
1185,2,13,works well with the new canon 600ex-rt speedlight, but it really should have a built in radio transmitter.,1,1
1185,2,14,It's been a decade... the pro's should have had it 8 years ago and it should be in consumer level cameras by now.

the lens weighs almost 2x as much as the camera
the strap stinks.,1,1
1185,2,15,grab a speed strap - they are worth it.,1,1
1185,2,16,same body layout as previous models, so larger mounting plates - like a manfrotto hexagon - block the battery door.,1,1
1186,2,0,The picture quality is great and with a 1 gig memory card in it I never worry about having enough space.,0,0
1186,2,1,as mentioned, there is a long wait between pictures, especially with the flash, but I upgraded from a very old 1.5 megapixel camera so this is nothing new.,1,1
1186,2,2,Overall I was quite happy with the camera until I found out just HOW fast it eats batteries.,1,1
1186,2,3,I took it to a new years party with a new set of energizer max batteries, got quite drunk and started clicking away.,1,1
1186,2,4,Half way through the night and the batteries died.,1,1
1186,2,5,When I got home and unloaded the memory I had only taken 72 pictures!,1,1
1187,2,0,Pictures are always clear, video function works fairly well.,0,0
1187,2,1,Simple interface.,0,0
1187,2,2,This camera functions very very very very... very slowly (for a digital camera).,1,0
1187,2,3,There is a gap of more than two seconds from when the shutter is pressed until when the picture is taken.,1,1
1187,2,4,Also, you cannot take many pictures in a row.,1,1
1187,2,5,If you try to take 3 pictures in 1 minute, it probably won't work.,1,1
1187,2,6,You must wait about 15 seconds between pictures, which has become VERY annoying for me.,1,1
1187,2,7,Also, it drains battery very quickly.,1,1
1188,2,0,Love this camera..Bought it lastnight as an early X-mas gift got ready for a night of trying to set it up.. Didnt happen Right out of the box we were taking video and snapping pictures.. Printed the pictures right from the dock with 1 button!! Exetremely easy to transfer pictures to the computer with Windows XP..had no need to install the softwear.,0,0
1188,2,1,Video is unlimited length until the card runs out of room..Dock also has a USB port for a flash drive to save pictures if no computer is available,0,1
1188,2,2,Just a couple personel cons..Video format is saved as Quicktime.,1,1
1188,2,3,(I personally do not like Quicktime) Internal memory is used before smart card (may be just a setting),1,1
1189,2,0,overall great camera.,0,0
1189,2,1,only thing, you cant zoom in and out during a video, only before hitting the record button.,1,1
1189,2,2,and you can't use the digital zoom, only the optical.,1,1
1189,2,3,and this isnt that big of a problem.,1,1
1190,2,0,This is a great camera.,0,0
1190,2,1,The pictures are so crisp and clear.,0,0
1190,2,2,There's several features that comes, like the lighting effects and screen settings.,0,0
1190,2,3,Also, the recorder on this camera is awesome.,0,0
1190,2,4,The videos don't lag and are good quality for a portable camera.,0,0
1190,2,5,I haven't found any yet.,1,0
1191,2,0,Takes awesome images, video quility is great.,0,0
1191,2,1,has alot of great settings, I think maybe to many! view finder is nice and big.,0,0
1191,2,2,price of a 5 meg digital is great!,0,0
1191,2,3,isnt that comfortable in the hand.,1,1
1191,2,4,I dropped it within the first 5 min I had it, luckyly I had the wrist strap on.,1,1
1191,2,5,wrist strap should be a little longer, ment for girls hands.,1,1
1191,2,6,I cant get it to micro focus at all and sometimes it has a hard time focusing on your subject.,1,1
1191,2,7,the worst though is having to remove the battery to charge it (need dock) cause you have to input the time and date each time you recharge.,1,1
1192,2,0,Easy to use.,0,0
1192,2,1,Lots of modes.,0,0
1192,2,2,We actually use the scene mode often because they have some onscreen descriptions and the pictures come out much better.,0,0
1192,2,3,Nice pictures inside and outside.,0,0
1192,2,4,Pretty fast between pictures.,0,0
1192,2,5,Lithium battery lasts a long time.,0,0
1192,2,6,We bought a larger extra battery and between the two I don't believe I will ever run out of juice, I am happy I never have to count on AA's again!!.,0,0
1192,2,7,We usually send our pictures to the local photo shop (wal-mart, walgreens, etc.) via the internet and get very nice quality pics in 4x6 format, so it is nice that kodak built in the 4.4 megapixel setting (this is the size of the picture you actually get printed out), no waste of memory.,0,0
1192,2,8,1)  I don't like having to take the battery out of the camera to recharge.,1,1
1192,2,9,This has actually turned out to be less of a hassle than I would have thought.,1,1
1192,2,10,I will add that even though the battery has to be removed to charge, the camera has held the date and time in memory.,1,1
1192,2,11,2)  I don't care for the Kodak software.,1,1
1193,2,0,Everything! Awesome battery life, excellent internal memory, so many settings!,0,0
1193,2,1,GREAT for novice photographers.,0,0
1193,2,2,A little big... and the software is a little complicated at once.,1,1
1194,2,0,The rechargable battery is great, finally no more AA's, it takes plenty of shots on one charge.,0,1
1194,2,1,Plus I got an extra battery, which is actually bigger, pretty cheap at newegg also.,0,0
1194,2,2,Lots of scene modes, which I do actually use, and they do actually help.,0,0
1194,2,3,Very happy with the camera.,0,0
1194,2,4,The rechargable battery has to be removed to be charged.,1,1
1194,2,5,This is not really that big of a deal condidering at least it has a rechargable battery, which I am very happy with.,1,1
1195,2,0,This is the second camera I have purchased through Newegg and I wouldn't buy one anywhere else.,0,1
1195,2,1,That said .. I love this camera!,0,1
1195,2,2,One of the things I especially noticed is how much it stores .. I've gone to school plays and taken 5 or 6 videos along with a bunch of still shots and still had room left for more.,0,1
1195,2,3,I've had no problems with it and I've  only just begun to learn all the things I can do with it.,0,1
1195,2,4,Thank you Newegg!,0,1
1196,2,0,Newegg price is great.,0,0

1197,2,0,Exellent point and shoot abilities for novice photographers.,0,1
1197,2,1,Fast response.,0,1

1198,2,2,Pictures come out nice and clean.,0,0
1199,2,0,Nice, light, cheap camera which will be great for anyone starting out.,0,0
1199,2,1,You can view through the viewfinder or you can look at the display panel on the back.,0,1
1199,2,2,When you use the zoom, you have to use the display panel; you cannot see the zoom through the viewfinder.,1,1
1200,2,0,Excellent for technologically challenged.,0,1
1200,2,1,Neat and simple, well organized interface.Easy to use.,0,1
1200,2,2,Quality is good enough for day to day stuff.,0,1
1200,2,3,Has USB and SD card interface neatly tucked in the camera.,0,1
1200,2,4,Software is annoying and bulky.,1,1
1200,2,5,Quality is not comparable to other 3 megapix cameras.,1,1
1201,2,0,+ Newegg is teh Pwns,0,0
1201,2,1,picture quality is bad, lots of digital noise (probably from bad compression), like other reviewers said it eats batteries, options are lackluster, quite thick & heavy, plastic thing over lens is tacky, etc...,1,1
1202,2,0,If you are looking for a basic camera, this one is perfect!,0,0
1202,2,1,The pictures are very high quality, especially outdoors.,0,0
1202,2,2,Simple menus and controls, cute design, superb software, easy transfer to your computer, a large LCD screen, and a very low price are some of the many pros of this little camera.,0,0
1202,2,3,The main con is the lack of optical zoom; this can be a bigger pain than you would expect.,1,1
1202,2,4,Another is the lack of sound with videos, but whatever, if you want high quality videos you're going to need a camcorder anyway.,1,1
1203,2,0,Perfect starter camera for my 13 yr.,0,0
1203,2,1,Excellent pictures and best price I could find on the web.,0,0
1204,2,0,The prints that we have had processed look good for what we paid for the camera.,0,0

1204,2,4,Very few features.,1,1
1204,2,5,It eats batteries like crazy.,1,1
1204,2,6,your very basic point and shoot.,1,1
1204,2,7,Did I mention that It eats batteries like crazy?,1,1
1205,2,0,Works with Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.,0,1
1205,2,1,Pictures are saved in JPG format rather than RAW which makes pulling them off easy.,0,1
1205,2,2,Supports SD Cards.,0,1
1205,2,3,No optical zoom, a little bulky, uses AA batteries.,1,1
1206,2,0,Good camera for the price.,0,0
1206,2,1,Great number of megapixels, batteries are included, takes great Get it if you're a poor college student like me.,0,0
1206,2,2,The only cons are for the camera itself.,1,1
1206,2,3,There's no direct zoom button, you have to press a different button to access it.,1,1
1206,2,4,Took a while to figure that out.,1,1
1206,2,5,The LCD is a little pixellated, and the photo gets weird too when you zoom in, even before taking the photo.,1,1
1206,2,6,This is because the physical camera doesn't zoom in, i.e. the lens doesn't move.,1,1
1206,2,7,It's all done by the computer.,1,1
1206,2,8,The controls are a little sketchy, but I'm used to Nikon, I guess.,1,1
1207,2,0,Very awesome camera, inexpensive, and high quality - color-filled and large pictures, especially for this price.,0,0
1207,2,1,The zoom on the camera isn't too powerful, and when you do you zoom the pictures turn out a little pixelated, until you resize them down a little.,1,1
1207,2,2,Better to just not zoom (and just get closer), and just crop the picture later.,1,1
1208,2,0,At the time, this became cutting-edge for what it could do.,0,1
1208,2,1,I used this a lot on the mountain during my professional skiing years.,0,1
1208,2,2,We did things on the fly.,0,1
1208,2,3,This camera took a beating.,0,1
1208,2,4,It's served its purpose and still continues to give beautiful shots with lots of color.,0,1
1208,2,5,I do have a 'con' for this camera.,1,1
1208,2,6,Over time, it doesn't like batteries anymore.,1,1
1208,2,7,It eats them up in minutes.,1,1
1208,2,8,Sometimes, the optical lens won't come out.,1,0
1208,2,9,Sometimes, I just get a red blinking light.,1,0
1208,2,10,It takes a lot of work to get it to function.,1,0
1209,2,0,Decent point-and-shoot camera
Good battery life with rechargeables.,0,0
1209,2,1,Powerful flash, though at times, a bit too much.,0,1
1209,2,2,A few additional thoughts on the Kodak C340… Apparently, Sony Cybershot optical zooms also makes lots of noise.,1,1
1209,2,3,I have experience with many Canon, Fuji and Nikon digitals and have never heard one as mechanically noisy.,1,1
1209,2,4,This isn’t peculiar to the camera I own, as I’ve noticed it in another one.,1,1
1209,2,5,The picture quality is lacking, mainly due to the processing on-board.,1,1
1209,2,6,Digital zooming does degrade the quality, as it does in any camera, but the poor processing exacerbates this issue with the Kodak.,1,1
1209,2,7,If your intent is to use the 5mp capabilities to allow for cropping and enlargements, the results will likely disappoint you.,1,1
1209,2,8,These points having been made, it’s still a decent little point-and-shoot camera.,1,1
1209,2,9,Similarly priced models from other manufacturers are still a better value.,1,1
1210,2,0,This camera has many options for every type of condition.,0,0
1210,2,1,It's durable and reliable, and can connect to older easyshare printers with USB.,0,1
1210,2,2,One problem that I have gotten with is that I had to return the camera because of a screw loose inside it, only to get a new camera with the same problem.,1,1
1210,2,3,Kodak will come through with fixing it though (1-year warranty).,1,1
1210,2,4,Oh, and don't use the LCD if you don't need to (sucks up battery)!,1,1
1211,2,0,Great value.,0,0
1211,2,1,Camera takes high quality pics, and has lots of different modes (such as portrait and closeup, which do make a difference) and different options (file sizes, white balance, etc).,0,0
1211,2,2,Takes great outdoor photos.,0,0
1211,2,3,Small, lightweight and reliable.,0,0
1211,2,4,White balance indoors can be a pain, it always seems off.,1,1
1211,2,5,Depending on the type of light faces come out very red.,1,1
1211,2,6,This can be corrected to a degree with white balance settings or not using the flash in a bright room, but lack of a manual manual white balance makes this impossible to eliminate completely.,1,1
1212,2,0,I've always used Kodaks and I like them.,0,0

1213,2,4,format.,1,1
1213,2,5,Zoom is mechanically noisy and doesn't instill confidence in its construction.,1,1
1213,2,6,Exposure in "auto" mode can be all over the place.,1,1
1214,2,0,Inexpensive, clear pics at high resolutions, user friendly, small & lightweight, very nice LCD screen, lots of picture-taking options,0,0
1214,2,1,I've had several digital cameras, and all of them have been hard on batteries.,1,1
1214,2,2,Use the LCD screen sparingly and it will vastly improve battery life.,1,1
1215,2,0,Lots of nice features.,0,0
1215,2,1,Great for first time buyers scared or uncertain on whether they could use a digital camera.,0,0
1215,2,2,Not quite the picture quality you'd expect from a 5MP camera!,1,1
1215,2,3,My Nxxxn Coolpix 3100 (3 mega pixels) took clearer better resolution pictures.,1,1
1215,2,4,Too bad it crapped out after just under two years.,1,1
1216,2,0,Great camera, it takes awsome video too!,0,1
1216,2,1,The battery lakes forever to drain not to mention its rechargable!,0,1

1217,2,4,It supports SDHD card capacities up to 32 gig.,0,0
1217,2,5,Video is 640 s 480, 4:3.,0,0

1217,2,8,Zoom mode when taking videos is digital only, not optical.,1,1
1217,2,9,This is probably how it's able to run for nearly 2 hours on a single charge.,1,1
1217,2,10,There's a USB cradle (model CA-32) that'll charge and download pics at the same time without needing to open the camera.,1,1

1217,2,12,There are plenty of European vendors that sell it.,1,1
1217,2,13,NewEgg doesn't carry it.,1,1

1226,2,9,I'll never go back to a 3X digital camera again!,0,0
1226,2,10,There are too many ++pluses++ to let the few "cons" spoil the camera.,1,0
1226,2,11,Here are my mild concerns:

1.,1,0
1226,2,12,Not the longest lasting battery.,1,0
1226,2,13,Kodak specs 135 pictures before needing a recharge.,1,0
1226,2,14,That may be true if you are taking the pictures and NOT viewing them on the spacious viewing screen.,1,0
1226,2,15,If so, and if you use the "touch up" feature to make your excellent photos even nicer, - well, you will sacrifice battery life.,1,0
1226,2,16,Make sure you take your charger with you when you travel!

2.  Custom camera interface.,1,1
1226,2,17,The V610's interface is a "non" USB standard.,1,1
1226,2,18,The box is supposed to come with a V610 to USB adapter to allow you to mate up with USB cables to a PC or to the video input of a TV.,1,1
1226,2,19,My "new" box was missing this crucial adapter.,1,1
1226,2,20,Kodak was responsive enough to correct the error and send me the $8 adapter free of charge.,1,1
1226,2,21,Overall, both complaints are trivial, but the short battery life can be annoying if you are not prepared.,1,1
1227,2,0,For the price you are paying for this you are getting a great deal.,0,1
1227,2,1,The Camera takes great high quality videos and Pictures for the price you're paying.,0,1

1228,2,2,After having the camera for a week, it quit working.,1,1
1228,2,3,It would not turn on and stay on.,1,1
1228,2,4,I kept getting low battery signal.,1,1
1228,2,5,I would have thought that I wouldn't have to get a new camera repaired this quick.,1,1
1229,2,0,I was amazed at the picture quality going from a 3.0MP camera (purchased on Newegg) to a 5.0MP.,0,0
1229,2,1,I honestly did not know that 2 MP would make sure a big difference.,0,0

1231,2,4,no camera case.,1,1
1231,2,5,flash is a bit weak, probably holds it back the most.,1,1
1231,2,6,feels a bit cheap, but that's probably just my preference.,1,1
1232,2,0,* Great price for the feature set,0,0
1232,2,1,* Short useful battery life.,1,1
1233,2,0,I have owned many digital cameras over the past 8 or 9 years... but this camera is about the best value for the money that I have ever bought.,0,0
1233,2,1,This is also a very easy camera to use.... even beginners should have no trouble learning the controls.,0,1
1233,2,2,Battery life is a little short when you are taking pictures with the flash... but that is to be expected with any camera that only uses two AA batteries.,1,0
1233,2,3,Just carry a spare set of NiMH rechargeable batteries.,1,0
1234,2,0,Reasons I bought it: 3x optical zoom, uses AA batteries, uses SD memory, small pocket size.,0,1
1234,2,1,I got this to compliment the Olympus I have that is bulkier (10x zoom, larger LCD).,0,1
1234,2,2,The Kodak has a nice simple interface the rest of my family can easily use.,0,1

1238,2,0,Great camera, takes good pictures, good motion pictures.,0,0
1238,2,1,Nice clarity, even takes decent video!,0,0
1238,2,2,The pure size of it, it's too big to throw in your pocket like a normal sized digital camera because of the 10X zoom capabilities.,1,1
1239,2,0,Menu system is easy to use.,0,0
1239,2,1,Picture quality is great for the size of the photo; people often think I have several more megapixals.,0,0
1239,2,2,Uses AA batteries (handy when travelling around the world), like 10x zoom,0,1
1239,2,3,Prefer to have a viewfinder, but that's the price of 10x zoom.,1,1
1239,2,4,A little large, but again that's due to the quality of the lens and AA batteries.,1,1
1239,2,5,Not a party or pocket camera, more of a light travel camera.,1,1
1240,2,0,By itself, this is a great camera, but you can also buy it in a bundle.,0,1
1240,2,1,The bundle includes a Series 3 Kodak Photo Printer, Rechargeable batteries, the camera, connection cords and a 10-page sample pack of paper.,0,1
1240,2,2,The camera charges when docked on the photo printer.,0,1
1240,2,3,The prints are as good as film cameras and better than some of the prints you can have made at stores.,0,1
1240,2,4,The charge on the batteries lasts for several hundred photos.,0,1
1240,2,5,The camera is pretty simple to use even for a novice.,0,1
1240,2,6,The menus are clear and understandable.,0,1
1240,2,7,In night shots, the LCD displays grainy pictures, but when it flashes, the picture taken is clear.,0,1
1240,2,8,You have the ability to customize settings (ISO Speed, White Balance, etc.) as you would on your film camera if you want.,0,1
1240,2,9,Also, you can take a burst of images; either four at a time or three at a time.,0,1
1240,2,10,I haven't found any problems with this camera.,1,1
1241,2,0,Ive had problems with digital cameras in the past so was always afraid to invest a little cash into one.,0,1
1241,2,1,But I must say for the price this camera is a great deal.,0,1
1241,2,2,I finally have ridded myself of the red eyes in my 3 year old with crystal clear pictures.,0,1
1241,2,3,Its has a nice LCD screen and all the picture modes are nice as well.,0,1
1241,2,4,No cons other than it doesnt come with rechargeable batteries, but most cameras dont anyways.,1,0
1242,2,0,Great optical zoom, pop-up flash, great functionality and adjustability.,0,0
1242,2,1,Does not include a rechargable battery.,1,1
1242,2,2,Even my little point and shoot Kodak included a rechargable.,1,1

1244,2,0,Great camera.,0,0
1244,2,1,This is our first digital camera and I am impressed.,0,0
1244,2,2,Does not have all the features of higher end cameras, but enough to do alot of things with.,0,0
1244,2,3,The pictures are very impressive, very clear.,0,0
1244,2,4,My Father has the 740 and his has a few more options, but the pictures are clearer on this one.,0,0
1244,2,5,You have to purchase the dock station separately, as opposed to some of the Kodak's com with them.,1,1
1244,2,6,Not really a con since you can still use the usb, but if you do not have a photo printer, then you have to purchase one.,1,1
1244,2,7,It would probably be better anyway.,1,1
1245,2,0,Amazing and I have no regrets buying it.,0,1
1245,2,1,The 18-55mm lens that comes with it works well, but you'll probably find yourself replacing it in the near future, but don't let that stop you from getting the T4i with the lens, it's still nice to have around.,0,1
1245,2,2,If you're just entering photography and you want a high performer for a low cost, buy this DSLR.,0,1
1245,2,3,When you're using the touch screen you'll inevitably get smudges on the screen, just keep a microfiber cloth in handy at all times.,1,0
1246,2,0,Excellent image quality, especially when cleaned up a little in Photoshop.,0,0
1246,2,1,Lens is very versatile and very high quality.,0,0
1246,2,2,This camera does best in good light and with low ISO settings.,0,0
1246,2,3,RAW format is very useful in Photoshop CS2 and in PS Elements 5.  Avoid the EasyShare software and just use a card-reader.,0,0
1246,2,4,Sharpness is nearly as good as the large sensor Sony R1, which costs about three times as much.,0,0
1246,2,5,Handling, balance and ease of use for beginners is very good.,0,0
1246,2,6,All manual and advanced features are pretty easy to use.,0,0
1246,2,7,burst mode and auto exposure bracketing work well.,0,0
1246,2,8,RAW file option has a workable exposure bracketing mode as well, which is unusual for a camera in this price range.,0,0
1246,2,9,This is a very under-rated camera that should be better known.,0,0
1246,2,10,It is very highly rated and recommended by many of the dedicated digital camera review sites as among the best buys and best in class.,0,0
1246,2,11,Manual zoom is nice and very wide angle to moderate telephoto.,0,0
1246,2,12,Manual focussing and movie mode good.,0,0
1246,2,13,Processing and writing files to disk is too slow.,1,1
1246,2,14,However, fast manual zoom does compensate somewhat.,1,1
1247,2,0,If you want all the bells and whistles of a SLR without the high cost and huge size, the P880 is for you.,0,0
1247,2,1,I love it's high quality lens - it's even wide angle!,0,0
1247,2,2,The LCD is very large and the picture quality is amazing.,0,0
1247,2,3,I love that I can add an external flash via the hot shoe attachment and that you can get additional lenses with the lens adapter.,0,0
1247,2,4,It was also very important for me to be able to record video with my camera - and this one can do it.,0,0
1247,2,5,I am also excited to use this camera in a photography course since it has fully manual control options.,0,0
1247,2,6,Just a few:
- The write speed to the memory card is not very fast.,1,1
1247,2,7,This causes me quite a bit of annoyance when I am trying to immediately review a picture after taking it or when I want to immediately take another picture after just taking one.,1,1
1247,2,8,The slow write speed causes a "processing" message to come on the screen and I have to wait about 5-10 seconds before it goes away to continue with what I was going to do.,1,1
1247,2,9,I've emailed Kodak about this and we'll see what they say...
- The auto focus (or whatever it is) is always working when the camera is on and it's pretty loud.,1,1
1247,2,10,This only really bugs when I'm taking video and you hear mechanical sounds in the background.,1,1
1247,2,11,- While the LCD screen is nice and big, there are not enough pixels.,1,1
1247,2,12,The images on the screen seem grainy.,1,1
1248,2,0,This camera is the best crossover between a compact digital and an SLR digital.,0,0
1248,2,1,With a PASM-C dial, manual zoom, manual focus, there is not much left out.,0,1
1248,2,2,PASM indicates Programmed, Aperture priority, Shutter priority, and full Metered manual.,0,1
1248,2,3,The C allows for three PASM presets.,0,1
1248,2,4,Cycle times are about 1.2 seconds.,0,1
1248,2,5,This camera is fast.,0,1
1248,2,6,The 24 to 140 MM zoom does not appear to be "super zoom" but with the 1.4x Scneider Kreuznach auxilliary lens the telephoto renge goes out to about 200 MM.,0,1
1248,2,7,24 to 200 is fine for me.,0,1
1248,2,8,Maybe the 0.7 Sheneider Kreusnach wide angle will work with the P880, taking me down to 16 MM.,0,1
1248,2,9,The 2.5" LCD screen is a bit grainy.,1,0
1248,2,10,Big, yes.,1,0
1248,2,11,But it works.,1,0
1249,2,0,Lots of manual control, and a wide angle lens makes for some great shots.,0,0
1249,2,1,The auto mode is pretty good for novices such as myself, and will help you get good pictures while you get used to the manual settings.,0,0
1249,2,2,So far I'm impressed with the battery life as well, I've takin several days worth of pictures and the battery indicator hasn't changed.,0,0
1249,2,3,But then again I'm not using the flash all that much.,0,0
1249,2,4,I'm also impressed with its ability to take pictures in low light without the flash, occasionally a picture will come out blury, but i contribute that to my lack of experience.,0,0
1249,2,5,According to reviews, it has a slow write speed to the SD card.,1,1
1249,2,6,I usually leave it in 8MP standard JPEG and it isnt really that slow, but i could see where taking alot of 8MP RAW files, at ~20MB, could be a little annoying.,1,1
1249,2,7,2 reasons i gave it a 4
- The JPEG mode resets itself to Standard when you change modes
-The only way to transfer the pictures to a PC is the Kodak SW.
Im used to dragging images from a usb device to a folder.,1,1
1249,2,8,Given the kodak SW makes it pretty easy to organize the pictures into dated folders, It feels a little bloated and resource - hungry.,1,1
1249,2,9,My plan to get around that is to get an SD reader and just pop the card in to transfer the pictures.,1,1
1249,2,10,I was really hoping there was a way to put the camera into a usb disk mode, the kodak SW runs as a service so you really cant just open the SW when you want to transfer files, kind of a pain, but oh well,1,1
1250,2,0,Newegg was prompt with their service as alway's,0,1
1250,2,1,piece of junk, don't waste your time or money, camera fail's to download into computer, software will not load properly, mine is now in the trash.Have had it for 1 month, tired of pulling my hair out.,1,0

1255,2,0,Awesome small compact cam, ITS REALLY TOUGH!,0,0
1255,2,1,It withstood a SLAMMING on the pavement (a mad girl) and i took it snowboarding with me and i fell on it numerous times, and it even laid in the snow for some time and still works perfectly!,0,0

1258,2,4,Picture Quality: Excellent quality, even when you use the 3X Optical zooms
Video: Video Quality isn’t too bad, it gives you the options.,0,1

1258,2,7,CONS:

1258,2,8,Your images can be added into the Kodak program very easily, but it’s difficult to extract them out of it.,1,1
1258,2,9,-Short battery life, but extra batteries for this Kodak model are affordable at $20.00 each.,1,1
1258,2,10,-Can’t transfer pictures out of their software very easily, requires some computer knowledge.,1,1
1258,2,11,-How to side step Kodak software listed above: 
1.  Select the custom option to just install the dock and card reading software off of the CD on your system.,1,1
1258,2,12,2.  Click the Easy Share button on the dock pad should bring up a simple generic interface to copy the images into “My Pictures” folder.,1,1
1259,2,0,i picked up this camera today, it right out the box it was amazing.,0,0
1259,2,1,i poped in the new 1gig kingston card in there and recorded 30 minutes of video without any error, nice and clean quality.,0,0
1259,2,2,the pictures are amazing.,0,0
1259,2,3,and it does come with usb.,0,0
1259,2,4,i recommend this camera to everybody!!,0,0
1260,2,0,I cant belive it can actualy take 30min of video on a 1GB stick as good a quality as a video camera.,0,0
1260,2,1,Its small and light about the size of a pack of cigs.,0,0
1260,2,2,The video cuts out after 1:30min it says the memory card is to slow to write too.,1,1
1261,2,0,Very cute, light, tiny, nice screen, convinient menu, fine software.,0,0
1261,2,1,Good quality video, nice pictures.,0,0
1261,2,2,No USB port on the camera!,1,1
1261,2,3,Extremely upset!,1,1
1261,2,4,16MB internal memory instead of 32 MB as promised.,1,1
1261,2,5,No optical viewfinder, but don't really need.,1,1
1262,2,0,Good Camera, nice large screen.,0,0
1262,2,1,Imaging-Resource.com has a full review of the similar Kodak v550.,0,1
1262,2,2,No USB port, the camera uses Kodaks proprietary EasyShare Dock port and Huge Docking Station for recharging and transfering pictures.,1,1
1262,2,3,Without the software and proprietary dock it is unable to tranfer files to another computer (unless it takes SD cards).,1,1
1262,2,4,This is unacceptable for a camera designed for traveling!,1,1
1262,2,5,By contrast the canons have tiny battery chargers and standard USB ports.,1,1
1263,2,0,The user interface is very easy to understand.,0,0
1263,2,1,Very small.,0,0
1263,2,2,Easyshare program is very easy to use.,0,0
1263,2,3,Dock makes it easy to charge and share photos with my PC.,0,0
1263,2,4,Case is inlayed with metal; very stylish and strong.,0,0
1263,2,5,Good weight to it and is balanced.,0,0
1263,2,6,My older kodak camera was a little more forgiving(less chance of blur), but with all of the new cameras with higher megapixels, you have to be more steady.,1,1
1264,2,0,As with any compact camera, this one is hard to hold still, but the image stabilization goes a long way to make up for that.,0,0
1264,2,1,Image quality is fine for consumer-grade photography.,0,0
1264,2,2,In addition to fully automatic and manual controls, it has a wide variety of "scene" modes, which are basically pre-sets optimized for various conditions (sports, landscapes, close-ups, etc.)  On a recent vacation, I used the timer and long-exposure setting to take a fantastic shot of the Hong Kong skyline at night.,0,0
1264,2,3,The big LCD makes photo review easy.,0,0
1264,2,4,Battery life is short.,1,1
1264,2,5,While on vacation, I was lucky if I got a full day's use out of the battery.,1,1
1264,2,6,I attribute this (in part) to the power drain from the big LCD.,1,1
1264,2,7,Eventually, I learned to disable the LCD between shots.,1,1
1264,2,8,Also, the flash seemed pretty ineffective, as it overexposed the foreground and underexposed the background.,1,1
1264,2,9,Fortunately, the image stabilization allows you to shoot without the flash most of the time.,1,1
1265,2,0,This is one of the best cameras for its price range I have used, you can crop on the camera, and the software for it is very intuitive, and well developed.,0,0
1265,2,1,The only thing wrong is that I forget to bring it with me.,1,1
1266,2,0,Huge 30"x20" pictures, The 2.5" High deffinition LCD is great, I can tell if the picture is in focus or not just with the LCD on the camera.,0,0
1266,2,1,Very small camera, It really is smaller than a deck of cards!,0,1
1266,2,2,The Easy-Share software hasn't been able to work on my computer from the CD or from the web download, I've tried all of the trouble-shooting guides online trying and get the software installed but still nothing.,1,1
1266,2,3,The auto focus has a little trouble focusing at under a foot.,1,1
1267,2,0,This is my first digital camera and it's so easy to use!,0,0
1267,2,1,The pictures turn out great also!,0,0
1267,2,2,Highly reccomend this camera!,0,0
1267,2,3,Not as small as some of the others out there, but that's ok!,1,0
1268,2,0,We have the same printer with a cheaper Kodak camera.,0,1
1268,2,1,I just wanted to say that I love this printer.,0,1
1268,2,2,My wife does not normaly like using the computer to print pictures.,0,1
1268,2,3,She wants me to print the pictures.,0,1
1268,2,4,This printer with the included Kodak software makes printing pictures a breeze!,0,1
1268,2,5,And they turn out just like photos from the store!,0,1
1268,2,6,Even the "ink" is very simple to replace!,0,1
1268,2,7,Also, the combo comes with a rechargeable battery, so the dock charges the camera any time you set it on the dock.,0,1
1268,2,8,With our old camera, we had to reset the date every time we charged the batteries, because we had to remove the batteries.,0,1
1268,2,9,With a Kodak and a dock, you never have to reset the date.,0,1
1268,2,10,This may not be important to you, but I cannot tell you how many pictures we have that include the wrong date!,0,1
1268,2,11,Now with Kodak, no problem!,0,1
1268,2,12,More expensive than taking your card to the store for processing.,1,1
1268,2,13,But, with the convinience, it's worth it.,1,0
1268,2,14,Make sure to get the big package of paper at Costco.,1,0
1268,2,15,No screen, but it uses the camera screen, so this isn't really a problem.,1,0
1268,2,16,The Kodak software does require that you be an administrator on a Windows XP or Windows 2000 machine.,1,1
1268,2,17,It will work when you are not an administrator, but it will pester you about it every time you boot.,1,1
1269,2,0,This is an excellent combo.,0,0
1269,2,1,The camera has great resolution and is very easy to use.,0,0
1269,2,2,It takes awesome pictures.,0,0
1269,2,3,The printer is great with very high quality prints.,0,0

1270,2,4,They claim the autofocus is great, but I can't substantiate that.,0,0
1270,2,5,Died stone cold dead after <1 year, during a shoot.,1,1
1270,2,6,Also, not great for video shooting - no headphone output, no AC power supply, only records 30 mins before stopping without notifying you, the WiFi function isn't available in video mode, etc.,1,1
1271,2,0,Let me start off by saying that this is my first DSLR Camera.,0,1
1271,2,1,When I got it I was very disappointed by the images I took and this was due to me not understanding the camera or photography.,0,1
1271,2,2,So if you find yourself in the same boat please consider that it might be the case that its not camera that's taking bad images.,0,1
1271,2,3,This camera comes with wide variety of features unlike point and shoot cameras I have owned in the past.,0,1
1271,2,4,I'm not gonna go into details what those features are as there are many places on the internet where you can look up more detailed specs, all im gonna say that pictures look amazing.,0,1
1271,2,5,They look professional grade and I get people who tell me all the time that images are great.,0,1
1271,2,6,Video is great too however I would love if it was capable of 1080p at 60fps.,0,1
1271,2,7,If you are buying this camera you are probably trying to get into photography or its just your hobby, either way I suggest buying a body only and than getting a different lens on the side.,0,1
1271,2,8,The lens that comes with the camera is ok but nothing to brag about.,0,1
1271,2,9,Its just cheap lens.,0,1
1271,2,10,So dont spend your money on it.,0,1
1271,2,11,It should come for free with the camera.,0,1

1278,2,3,Comparable to Canon D6.,0,0
1278,2,4,Nikon 610 is generally a better camera and most of the extra's for Canon D6  can be added on as accessories to Nikon 610 (GPS, wireless).,0,0

1278,2,8,Does not come with fancy extra's like GPS or wireless phone app control.,1,1

1279,2,0,Many megapixels
Big full Frame - biggest reason for purchase
small batter (in size) still lasts long,0,0
1279,2,1,No wifi built in, biggest con at this price it better make bacon and more importantly i expect the wifi to be built in rather than buying an external adapter.,1,1

1280,2,8,Will submit updated review when I have a fully working device.,1,1

1289,2,0,I actually do not see anything good about this product, except my increase in knowledge that manufacturers like kodak can make horrible things like this "camera".,0,1
1289,2,1,Product is advertised to be a 14MP camera but does not even deliver up to 10MP, as a professional photographer I can say.,1,1

1295,2,5,Only real con is that Olympus uses proprietary USB-connectors.,1,1
1295,2,6,They look identical, but standard USB cords don't work.,1,1
1295,2,7,There's no apparently good reason for using non-standard connectors when standard ones work fine.,1,1

1325,2,7,Those are in the day shot.,1,1
1325,2,8,At night, the panasonic show very little noise because Panasonic has noise auto smoothing while there is visible noise with the Canon that the dots look worser close up than Panasonic.,1,1
1325,2,9,The photoshots were so similar, it's hard to decided which to buy but I ended up getting the underdog...Why?,1,1
1326,2,0,This camera takes excellent pictures in Automatic mode and Automatic-without-flash.  Color balance/contrast is superior to the Canon model line, especially in low-light conditions.,0,0

1330,2,11,Battery seems short lived per charge but its not much bigger than a book of matches.,1,1
1330,2,12,The ND / manual focus button seems a bit flimsy but that might just be because the other parts feel so solid.,1,1

1336,2,1,Anyway, the Panasonic is working as well as I was expecting.,0,0
1336,2,2,I mainly bought it for the 12X optical zoom, which will extend to 18X if you don't max out the photo size; at least they claim it's zooming to 18X so I suppose it is.,0,0
1336,2,3,99% of my photos are for computer viewing, I rarely print , so setting to a smaller file size was no big deal to me.,0,1
1336,2,4,I've taken 200-300 shots with zoom and I'm quite pleased with the results.,0,0
1336,2,5,Using the zoom with macro has produce some extraordinary pix of bees and wasps sucking pollen from flowers in my backyard.,0,0
1336,2,6,I imagine hardcore camera buffs would find plenty of flaws but to an average  guy like me who wants something beyond point and shoot but is too cheap to shell out more than 300-400 bucks it's nice.,0,0
1336,2,7,I don't know if there's something wrong with the camera, or if one of the 12 million settings is the problem, but no matter what file size I opt for in the setup menu my photo files always turn out to be exactly half that size; files set to 5MB come out as 2.5MB, 7MB end up 3.5MB etc.,1,1
1336,2,8,Like I said I'm not sure if I'm setting something wrong or what, the photos all look good to me though and I'm not concerned with printing so I'll probably just live with it.,1,1

1340,2,1,video is kind of grainy but the added audio makes up for this.,1,1
1340,2,2,Did have some weird "white" issues when pics are taken at dusk and dawn transition, it's a known issue and a firmware upgrade from the manufacturers website improves it but does not completely fix it.,1,1
1340,2,3,It's a very minimal issue IMHO.,1,1
1340,2,4,It usually clears up after a burst of pics are taken and the "timeout" period of 1 minute has elapsed.,1,1

1344,2,0,-Dynamic Range of the sensor is great for the price (see DXOmark) and better than Canon for Landscapes
-Flip out screen is worth upgrading to this camera for-- allows for better angles, screen preservation when traveling, and use of tripods (don't listen to Ken Rockwell, you need a tripod for some things)
- If you set up the controls right, you can adjust ISO, aperture, and shutter speed just as easily as the D7100, IMO
- This thing is super small and light relative to other DSLRs
- WIFI means your camera connects to your phone-- not to the internet.. Still, this replaces the need for a remote!,0,1

1348,2,6,I'm actually using one of these to shoot portraits in my small studio.,0,0
1348,2,7,I went from a discontinued 7D and the new Sony does create clearer images with very detailed RAW files.,0,0
1348,2,8,I immediately noticed the pictures needed less post production work to correct and clean up.,0,1
1348,2,9,I held my breath and bought one of these  when they came out.,0,1
1348,2,10,I don't reget the purchase, might buy another soon.,0,1
1348,2,11,If you already have Maxxum lenses then you are all set since they fit this camera!,0,1
1348,2,12,No vertical grip from Sony yet.,1,1
1348,2,13,Noise present at higher ISO's, but WHO uses them??? Everybody knows that the highest quality shots are made with the ISO 100-200 range.,1,1
1348,2,14,I'm tired of persons posting reviews when they never actually own the item they are complaining about.,1,1
1349,2,0,This is an add-on to my previous review - everything stands except:
the Canon lens tests versus some other and in part vintage and el-cheapo lenses can be found at
www.16-9.net,,0,1
1349,2,1,I slipped on the URL the first time around - SORRY!,0,0
1349,2,2,None, except a little more noise at high ISO than Canon or Nikon, but still better than any Olympus DSLR, and can be dealt with.,1,0
1349,2,3,This camera actually preserves more detail instead of mushing it at the cost of detail, so the noise is a trade off!,1,0
1349,2,4,See the reviews at www.dpreview.com,1,0
1349,2,5,If you're getting into this kind of gear, it is time to figure out more about image processing anyway :),1,0
1350,2,0,I do NOT own this camera, but I have played with it and have to correct some simply wrong statements made by another reviewer here.,0,1
1350,2,1,In-body shake reduction can of course not be observed through the viewfinder, this is a very stupid comment!,0,1
1350,2,2,The shake reduction actually does work, and on my Pentax K100d it makes a clear advantage and testers have found the same for the Sony A100

The NICE thing about sensor activated anti-shake is that EVERY lens gets stabilized.,0,1
1350,2,3,Whether you move the lens to compensate shake, or move the sensor, does not matter, what matters is the compensation you get.,0,1
1350,2,4,It's like a wobbling window going up and down and left and right - if you can keep your eye steady behind the window, your view is steady.,0,1
1350,2,5,The A100 is a VERY well built piece, with a good viewfinder and great ergonomics.,0,1
1350,2,6,I have played with it, and it is by far a better fit for most hands than the shoddily designed Canon XT and XTi, which feel cramped and all wrong even for my small and narrow ha,0,1
1350,2,7,I would normally not give this camera 5 stars, due to the noise factor being somewhat higher than either Canon, Nikon, or Pentax.,1,0
1350,2,8,HOWEVER, the A100 is still better and makes sharper, and cleaner images than the "prize winning" Olympus dSLR cameras.,1,0
1350,2,9,Hence I am compensating the previous reviewer's negative rating with a better than 4 star rating :),1,0
1351,2,0,Absolutely NONE,0,0
1351,2,1,Sony Rushed out this Product to fast its their first one and you dont even know how long they will stay in the DSLR Market.,1,1
1351,2,2,The In camera IS doesnt work because you arent able to see it working it is meant to be in the lenses because that is what moves.,1,1
1351,2,3,The flash is awful.,1,1
1351,2,4,The lenses are horribly expensive.,1,1

1353,2,7,It takes 720P HD video, too.,0,0
1353,2,8,Macros are surprisingly good.,0,0
1353,2,9,Can remove battery and memory card while on tripod.,0,0
1353,2,10,Can't zoom while recording HD video.,1,0
1353,2,11,Pictures a little soft at full 5X zoom.,1,0
1353,2,12,Flash pretty useless.,1,0
1354,2,0,there are lots of settings, nice video recording, easy zoom, easy user interface, the touch screen is a plus, and theres lots of settings.,0,0
1354,2,1,no zoom adjustment when video is recording, no cable came with the camera to charge it on the computer.,1,1
1354,2,2,you have to take the battery out to charge it.,1,1
1355,2,0,Granted noise reduction could be a bit better for the price, the color reproduction is stunning.,0,1
1355,2,1,The picture quality is fabulous, especially when the camera is configured accordingly.,0,1
1355,2,2,The exposure customizability allows you to shoot pictures just how you want to, wherever, whenever.,0,1
1355,2,3,Simply put, unbelievable.,0,1
1355,2,4,And it's a supercompact for a reason.,0,1
1355,2,5,Batery lasts long enough for several shoots without recharging.,0,1
1355,2,6,Has a built in speaker, so you can hear recorded videos.,0,1
1355,2,7,So many usefult tools, only takes a bit to learn them all.,0,1
1355,2,8,Arduously long flash recharge, but not much different than comprable models.,1,1
1355,2,9,Without flash, wonderfully fast.,1,0
1356,2,0,720p HD Video.,0,0
1356,2,1,Small, takes good pictures for a Point and Shoot.,0,0
1356,2,2,I didn't buy it for video, but video is nice to have when you take it with you.,0,0
1356,2,3,So for that, it's no $1,000 + video camera, but it's everything and more I'd want in a point and shoot.,0,0
1356,2,4,HD Video is in a .mov,1,0
1356,2,5,format...with a 4 gig card (make sure the card you buy can have a sustained read/write of over 10mbs or you can't record @ 720) only holds 16 minutes of video @ 30 fps.,1,1
1357,2,0,I bought the 1st generation of this camera about a year ago (SONY DSC-N) and i loved it!,0,0
1357,2,1,I took it everywhere with me, very durable, dropped it a few times with no problems...and then one day the screen cracked form misuse.,0,0
1357,2,2,So i decided to buy this one because it had 10.1 MP,0,0
1357,2,3,The responding time when turning it on is slower and even when panning through pictures.,1,1
1357,2,4,Still is a great camera!,1,1
1357,2,5,Can't go wrong with the 3" touch screen.,1,1
1358,2,0,takes great close ups and at 10MP, you can zoom in keeping the detail.,0,0
1358,2,1,I took a picture with no zoom on the 39th floor of a building and could increase the size enough to be ablt read a street sign.,0,0
1358,2,2,It also takes great movies, which is a real plus because I didn't think it would.,0,0
1358,2,3,Not enough optical zoom but for me it isn't that big a deal,1,0
1359,2,0,Great quality photos!,0,0
1359,2,1,I received one of these from work for a bonus we do and I love it.,0,0
1359,2,2,No external memory card.,1,1
1359,2,3,Doesn't take regular microSD memory.,1,1
1360,2,0,Outstanding picture quality, menus are easy to navigate (for me anyways), nice screen, good battery life.,0,0
1360,2,1,Shutter time is very good, the fastest I have ever seen so far for a camera of this size.,0,0
1360,2,2,No viewfinder, but not a huge drawback since so far it has been easy to use the screen for viewfinding in most light conditions.,1,1
1361,2,0,Great wide screen pictures.,0,0
1361,2,1,3 Inch touch-screen is easy to use and makes for easy viewing.,0,0

1361,2,9,and cool slideshow feature with changeable music.,0,0
1361,2,10,Macintosh friendly.,0,0
1361,2,11,25MB of internal memory is not much.,1,0
1361,2,12,only 5 pictures at 10MP without extra memory card.,1,0
1361,2,13,which a 2-gig card will take over 300 at 10MP and over 9999 VGA shots.,1,0
1361,2,14,Battery recharger takes a while and disposable batteries are not an option, but battery life is good.,1,0
1362,2,0,I bought this in silver and have been extremely happy with my choice.,0,0
1362,2,1,The 3" touch screen is really handy and easy to use without the stylus.,0,0
1362,2,2,The case appears to be metal and is very sturdy and compact.,0,0
1362,2,3,Pictures and videos are beautiful and seem to defy their origins from a compact camera.,0,0
1362,2,4,The menus are easy to navigate and offer photo editing capabilities that are neat, but which I'll never use.,0,0
1362,2,5,I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for top-of-the-line photos from a compact point and shoot camera.,0,0
1362,2,6,There is no included memory stick, but there is 25MB of internal memory.,1,1
1362,2,7,I purchased a MS Pro Duo 4G stick and can fit 9999 pictures at email resolution(VGA) and nearly 800 at 10 megapixels.,1,1
1362,2,8,The charger is cheap and requires you to remove the battery to recharge, so I purchased the AC-LS5 power adapter for low battery or continuous use.,1,1
1363,2,0,great pic quality 
ease of use
loooks hot as hell
nice as hell to show off lol..,0,0
1363,2,1,flimsy battery cover
pice(417 with discount wen i bought mine...)
manual not detailed on how to use fully,1,0
1364,2,0,This camera work perfectly.,0,0
1364,2,1,The screen is 3 inches and very bright.,0,0
1364,2,2,I fell in love with the touch screen the moment I started using it.,0,0
1364,2,3,The touch screen also gets rid of buttons (with the exception of 3).,0,0
1364,2,4,Works and looks great!,0,0
1364,2,5,Can't find a little slip cover, just the larger pouches.,1,1
1364,2,6,Not a big deal since it comes with one, but I would like a nicer one.,1,1
1365,2,0,The Panasonic DMC-FX150 is a blast to use.,0,1
1365,2,1,Some might question the need for 14-megapixel images, however I have found this camera can capture excellent images.,0,1
1365,2,2,Thanks to the MAX ISO feature, you can be sure that image noise is not a problem, and the FX150's effective image stabilization system helps fight image blur.,0,1
1365,2,3,With plenty of exposure options, I have been able to capture some great images.,0,1
1365,2,4,This is one of the few P&S cameras that allows full manual control and RAW.,0,1
1365,2,5,Automatic exposure also works great.,0,1
1365,2,6,Pictures are not as sharp as my Pentax K20D digital SLR, but no P&S camera will ever be as sharp as a good SLR.,1,1
1366,2,0,i got this cam because it has wide angle is ultraportable with a larger lens than i could find elsewhere at this size..  i also prefer panny for both cameras and camcorders.,0,1
1366,2,1,i get brand loyal with certain things and panny has won me over on these products.,0,1
1366,2,2,-knowing you a portion of the price went towards useless pixels... i think i might actually be embarrassed if anyone asked me how many pixels it had..  but that is probably more a reflection on my own issues than the camera itself.,1,0
1366,2,3,i have it set to use 10K.,1,0
1367,2,0,lots of cool features- resolution, 28mm, HD video etc.,0,1
1367,2,1,I own the TZ-5 but wanted the bigger sensor,0,1
1367,2,2,No zoom in hd.,1,1
1367,2,3,But more importantly the camera didn't work upon arrival.,1,1
1367,2,4,It turned on and shot pix but no image appeared on the LCD either when taking the shot or reviewing the pix.,1,1
1367,2,5,I am going to return it for replacement but I am definitely worried about the quality.,1,1
1368,2,0,Like other reviews, I find that this camera had all the features I searched for and then some.,0,0
1368,2,1,This camera was bought for a gift for a relative that has a very low tech level and would be confused with other cameras due to control layout.,0,0
1368,2,2,The use of the touchscreen made it very clean to work with and the person in question took it on a trip and had no problems in usage and took 78 photos without a hitch.,0,0
1368,2,3,Only issue I could see is that the camera does not seem to recharge its battery directly and cannot be plugged in directly to a power source, so all photo editing and printing is done on battery.,1,0
1368,2,4,I bought a second battery for it just in case but so far the camera has yet to run out of power on the first charge of battery.,1,0
1368,2,5,Only other possible issue is during photo review the touch panel uses pictures on the touch panel for navigation and do not seem to have a way to remove them so you can see the picture portions under the picture.,1,1
1368,2,6,These are minor issues that I am stretching for.,1,1
1369,2,0,3.0" inch LCD-Touch Screen!!!!  7.2 megapixels... Crystal clear pictures... Includes Super SteadyShot Optical Image Stabilization so when you have shaky hands or moving objects the image comes out clear instead of blurry.,0,0
1369,2,1,Great Video mode with 30fps at 640x480.,0,0
1369,2,2,oh yeah you can upload 4 of your favorite music too to watch with your slideshow!,0,0
1369,2,3,that's freaking awesome!,0,0
1369,2,4,Just remember to get 2gb memory pro duo to hold all your high-res videos you will take and high res photos!,0,0
1369,2,5,I can't see to find one!,1,0
1370,2,0,Awesome camera for the price.,0,0
1370,2,1,5X zoom is outstanding.,0,0
1370,2,2,Clarity of pictures at all resolutions is outstanding.,0,0
1370,2,3,Auto-Stabilizer feature a plus.,0,0
1370,2,4,Compact design.,0,0
1370,2,5,Easy to use.,0,0
1370,2,6,Menu's and features are easily understood.,0,0
1370,2,7,Love the built-in help guide!,0,0
1371,2,0,Comfortable to hold, tiny (slips right into your pocket), simple menus, nice colors, sharp images, 5x optical zoom, fair macro functions.,0,0
1371,2,1,It's an ultra compact, so there are limitations.,1,1
1371,2,2,A view finder would be nice as sometimes the LCD can be difficult to use in the bright sunlight.,1,1
1372,2,0,This camera has great optical zooming and works well.,0,0
1372,2,1,It is very easy to use, the controls are well laid out and are fairly straightforward.,0,0
1372,2,2,I have had several digital cameras and this one works as well or better than any of the others I have had.,0,0
1372,2,3,The panoramic setting is new to me and is exelent,0,0
1372,2,4,The only con I can think of is that the camera is more bulky than the others I have had but it is still not too big.,1,0
1373,1,0,Great transition from 35MM SLR to Digital Photography.,-1,0
1373,1,1,I had been trying for years to introduce my wife (a published photographer) to digital photography and this camera really inpressed her from the first time that she used it.,-1,0
1373,1,2,The size, ease of operation, and clarity of image were more than she had expected and she is very enthusiastic about continuing her hobby.,-1,0
1373,1,3,The price was very fair and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great digital camera.,-1,0
1374,1,0,Good, solid little camera.,-1,0
1374,1,1,I learned a valuable lesson recently.,-1,0
1374,1,2,When I first bought this camera I loaded it with some 2500 mAh batteries.,-1,1
1374,1,3,I was extremely disappointed that I could only get about 30 pictures before the battery died.,-1,1
1374,1,4,When I started to research battery chargers, I came to realize that not all chargers are created equal.,-1,1
1374,1,5,Many older and even cheaper new chargers are not capable of fully charging high capacity batteries.,-1,1
1374,1,6,This is because they use a timed charge which shuts off without regard for how much the battery is actually charged.,-1,1
1374,1,7,So if you are still using a 3 or 5 year old charger and it isn't a "smart" charger, then you might only be getting a 50% or less charge.,-1,1
1374,1,8,In my case, with an old Energizer charger, I reckon I was only getting a 30% charge.The other thing you should realize is that Alkaline batteries are not a good choice for digital cameras.,-1,1
1374,1,9,You'll be very disappointed with their life if you try to use them in this and most other cameras.Pros:High quality photos with Pentax SMC lens and big 6MP images.Uses SD card.,-1,1
1374,1,10,Check out Kingston's 512 MB card on Amazon for a good deal.Uses AA batteries.Great battery life (but you MUST get yourself some high capacity Ni-MH batteries and a charger capable of charging those same high capacity Ni-MHs).,-1,1
1374,1,11,With 2500 mAh batteries, it will get more than 250 pictures.Very solid construction.High quality metal case.Big 2.5" LCD screen.Good black and white image quality.Cons:No viewfinder (which only becomes an issue in low light conditions).Indoor pictures can be difficult to get right.With Alkaline batteries, it will only get about 40 pictures.Slow recycle times between pictures when using flash.Overall I am very pleased with this camera; it represents very good value for money- shop around!,-1,1
1375,1,0,On paper, this camera should be ideal, however, it fails to live up to its marketing hype: picture quality for outdoor scenic shots is good, but indoor and softer light situations show its limitations.,-1,1
1375,1,1,Photo quality is mediocre.,-1,1
1375,1,2,The camera also uses batteries rapidly.,-1,1
1375,1,3,I would suggest looking at the Canon A510, Sony Cybershot DSC-series, or Kodak Easyshare C-series instead.,-1,1
1376,1,0,Pentax S60-  Big price little perks.,-1,0
1376,1,1,$199+ The Pentax S60 DOES take very nice pictures HOWEVER it may not be worth the price because of its poor features: only 11 MB of memory, low AA battery-life, and the movie playback mode is hard to hear (not loud enough).,-1,0
1376,1,2,Also the latch that keeps the battery in place does not seem sturdy.,-1,0
1376,1,3,The upside to this camera is its picture quality (6 MP) and large screen.,-1,0
1377,1,0,Decent Camera, but not the Greatest.,-1,0
1377,1,1,I've had the Pentax Optio S60 since Christmas of 2006.,-1,0
1377,1,2,Right at the beginning, the things that bothered me about this camera were: 1) it came with no memory card and the built-in memory only allowed me to take about 5 pictures, and 2) AA batteries last for maybe 40 pictures (if you're lucky).,-1,0
1377,1,3,I found right away that lithium where the only batteries that worked well for me.,-1,0
1377,1,4,I did like the picture quality at first.Now that I've had it for a year and a half, here are the pros and cons as I see them with this camera:Pros:Seems to be sturdy.,-1,0
1377,1,5,Has held up for a year and a half with toddlers always trying to get ahold of it.,-1,0
1377,1,6,It's had its share of drops and it still works.It's pretty easy to use.It has a nice large screen (but no viewfinder)Cons:Does not take fast pictures (especially with a flash).,-1,0
1377,1,7,I don't hardly have any good pictures of my kids, b/c they only smile for a second and then they are done.,-1,0
1377,1,8,The camera just doesn't shoot fast enough to capture their smiles.The quality seems to have diminished (unless it's my imagination).,-1,0
1377,1,9,I recently ordered about 50 pictures from Kodak.com and the quality of most of the pictures is sub-par at best.,-1,0
1377,1,10,They almost seem foggy and the color looks off.,-1,0
1377,1,11,I know that it's not just the prints, b/c some that we ordered were taken from a different camera and they turned out much better.Overall, after a year and a half, I'm done with this camera.,-1,1
1377,1,12,I just ordered a Canon Powershot, so I'm hoping that I have better success with that one.,-1,1
1377,1,13,It definitely isn't worth the price that it's listed at now (as of 8/08).,-1,1
1377,1,14,If it weren't for the fact that this camera has held up so well and did seem to have decent quality pictures at the beginning, I would give it 2 stars.,-1,1
1378,1,0,Pleasantly Surprised!,-1,1
1378,1,1,After reading poor reviews on other Vivitar point-n-shoot cameras, I was pleasantly surprised with this red camera my mom got for Christmas from my dad - so pleased in fact that my mom got ME one in white for Christmas!,-1,1
1378,1,2,Nice 3.0" touch screen is easy on the eyes - light meter lets you know when flash is needed, a variety of different light settings (even night vision!) and a nice anti-shake feature that's always active.,-1,1
1378,1,3,Takes standard VGA video but will shoot 7MP HD photos (16:9 ratio) for panoramic shots like an extended family or the Grand Canyon.,-1,0
1378,1,4,It also has an external speaker so that when you play back your videos you can hear the sound.,-1,0
1378,1,5,Still picture quality is very good for a simple point and shoot camera.,-1,0
1378,1,6,I wish it would keep the flash selection on automatic - but this may be user error, and not the camera's fault.,-1,0
1378,1,7,I had a Kodak Easyshare camera(9.1 MP HD, no external speaker), and consider this one a trade-up.,-1,0
1378,1,8,This camera came out August 2012 and I had not seen a review of it so far - so here's one.,-1,0
1378,1,9,Happy shooting!,-1,0
1379,1,0,Seems to work well.,-1,1
1379,1,1,I haven't tried to transfer pictures to my computer yet.,-1,1
1379,1,2,I think the advertising material should specify that it requires a sandisk to function.,-1,1
1380,1,0,Touch screen was near inoperable and beyond frustrating.,-1,1
1380,1,1,The photo quality worse than a cellphone camera.,-1,1
1380,1,2,Blurry in full light, blurry in low light.,-1,1
1380,1,3,This camera just can't take a good photo.,-1,1
1381,1,0,It constantly freezes and loses all the pictures.,-1,1
1381,1,1,I've lost close to a hundred pictures.,-1,1
1381,1,2,The auto flash will not stay on, it always reverts to manual flash so when you need the flash it won't be there when you take the picture.,-1,1
1381,1,3,It wont take videos, it just freezes and the battery needs to be removed to reset it.,-1,1
1381,1,4,I've contacted tech support and there suggestions did not help at all.,-1,1
1381,1,5,Maybe this camera is a lemon, but I think it was designed to be a touchscreen camera with the most horrendous software and antiquated technology available.,-1,1
1382,1,0,LOVE IT.,-1,0
1382,1,1,I received this camera as a birthday present and I really like it.,-1,0
1382,1,2,It is easy to operate and it takes great pictures.,-1,0
1382,1,3,Good product for the price.,-1,0
1383,1,0,Although it was not expensive, I expected better.,-1,1
1383,1,1,Photos are fuzzy and the touch screen is a pain.,-1,1
1383,1,2,I bought it because you can charge it, instead of constantly purchasing batteries.,-1,1
1383,1,3,I have been told since that most cameras today share that feature.,-1,1
1384,1,0,Memory Card.,-1,0
1384,1,1,I think it would have been nice if a memory card was included.,-1,0
1384,1,2,Even a small one would have been appreciated.,-1,0
1385,1,0,Great Camera, upgrades from previous stylus models.,-1,0
1385,1,1,I own the stylus 710 that I have had since september of last year, and love it to pieces.,-1,0
1385,1,2,Little did I know olympus was relaseing this little monster onto the market 2 months later.,-1,0
1385,1,3,It has all of the features and software of the 710 model, with digital image stabilization, but5x optical/5.6x,-1,0
1385,1,4,digital/28x total zoom , an upgrade from 15x total zoom (3x optical and 5x digital).,-1,0
1385,1,5,The price is about the same, and actually an excellent deal here on amazon.,-1,0
1385,1,6,The 2.5" color LCD monitor with histogram display and auto image rotation has been standard in the 710 and 810, and the 1000 series, and I have not problem with it, I think it is comparable to all models in this range (panasonic, fuji, kodac, hp).,-1,1
1385,1,7,I the bright sun, no LCD is going to be really great.,-1,0
1385,1,8,I have captured many fun moments with this camera (2 weddings, 2 vacations) and love it.,-1,0
1385,1,9,The diffence with the 740 model is the thickness is a bit bigger due to the bigger optical lense, but that is well worth the sacrifice, because having more optical zoom = better picture.,-1,0
1385,1,10,I know, I tested this side by side with my 710.,-1,0
1385,1,11,Pick this up, you will not be dissapointed.,-1,0
1385,1,12,Also, look at the 750 and the 760 models, both of which have optical image and digital image stabilization, but alter the zooms a bit.,-1,0
1385,1,13,Compare, and see what meets your needs.Also, the Olympus Mastersoftware is very easy to use, And with panoramic feature, 3d, and Extra ART Features unlocked by Olympus Brand-Olympus Stamped Type H HD, this camera becomes even more of a pleasure to own.,-1,0
1385,1,14,you can edit photos on the computer, or right in the palm of your hand.,-1,0
1385,1,15,Both ways, this camera will make you feel like a pro in no time.,-1,0
1386,1,0,Highly portable, durable camera, great shots, bad lcd screen.,-1,0
1386,1,1,I love every aspect of this camera except one.I recently took it on a three week vacation to China and the photos I took are stunning.It's very light weight and fits well in a pocket.It's durable, weather resistant, and can really take a beating.Extremely user friendly.The automatic settings work very well.,-1,0
1386,1,2,I'm particularly impressed with the under water and use available light settings.,-1,0
1386,1,3,They can be a lot of fun to play with.It turns on and can be adjusted to the right setting rapidly with little experience to grab shots on the go.It looks cool.The gyroscope technology works.,-1,0
1386,1,4,You can take focused shots from a moving bus on a bumpy road or while walking.The only drawback, and it's kind of a big one, is the lcd screen.,-1,1
1386,1,5,There is a thick, protective plastic screen over the actual lcd screen.,-1,1
1386,1,6,In bright light, (like out doors during an average sunny day), you can barely see the screen.,-1,1
1386,1,7,If you're in the desert, on a mountain, in snow, or some other ecseptionaly bright setting the screen is black.,-1,1
1386,1,8,You can not see a damned thing.,-1,1
1386,1,9,To compensate for this I occasionaly had to take 5 photos of the same thing to make sure I got one that was centered ok.Still, I'm very happy with this camera and would buy it again even knowing about the screen problem.,-1,1
1387,1,0,Great Camera To Hide in Your Pocket.,-1,0
1387,1,1,Have been using this camera for 3 months with no problems.,-1,1
1387,1,2,A friend had a problem with the battery charger on his 740  and sent in for replacement.,-1,1
1387,1,3,Shoot most of my photos with 8MP Canon Digital Rebel XT (SLR) with External flash and 18-200 zoom.,-1,0
1387,1,4,This camera (740) allows for great "back-up" when I don't want to carry around the Huge Monster(XT).,-1,0
1387,1,5,7MP plus 5X Optical Zoom cannot be found in a better, smaller, lighter package.,-1,1
1387,1,6,You can stick this in you pocket when going out to dinner and noone knows you are carrying a camera.,-1,1
1387,1,7,I also often wear this in a belt pouch (like a cell phone) and am ready for an unexpected foto op at all times.,-1,1
1387,1,8,Never owned an Olympus before but have convinced SEVERAL of my friends and business associates to buy it.,-1,1
1387,1,9,The price is also dropping like a rock since intro in August '06.,-1,1
1388,1,0,Definitely NOT worth $300.,-1,1
1388,1,1,Flash is just way too bright.,-1,1
1388,1,2,The lens caps stopped working after a week.,-1,1
1388,1,3,I sent it back for warranty, and Olympus sent it back with nothing done to repair it.,-1,1
1388,1,4,Don't buy it.,-1,1
1389,1,0,Great compact and versatile.,-1,0
1389,1,1,This is my third Olympus digital camera.,-1,0
1389,1,2,I find it to be the smallest yet, without sacrificing features.,-1,0
1389,1,3,They have addressed the issues in previous generations about the time it takes for the camera to turn on.,-1,1
1389,1,4,With small kids, I often missed my shots by the time the cameras would turn on and load.,-1,1
1389,1,5,This new stylus is perfect.,-1,0
1389,1,6,The battery life is excellent and the image and color quality is superior to previous generations.,-1,0
1389,1,7,I have found it to be very durable to this point and I am not very careful with how I treat electronics.,-1,0
1389,1,8,A great, compact 7.1MP camera for the price!!!!,-1,0
1390,1,0,super camera.,-1,0
1390,1,1,the best camera i have owned.great,-1,0
1390,1,2,zoom,digital image stabilizer,weather proof,takes very nice pics at low light leveles.,-1,1
1391,1,0,Nice little camera.,-1,1
1391,1,1,Have had only for 3 months with no major problems so far.,-1,1
1391,1,2,The only glitch is the lack of a view finder, so framing a shot in bright sunlight is not easy to do as you can't see the image in the LCD screen too clearly.,-1,1
1391,1,3,Same as many other cameras of this type.,-1,1
1392,1,0,Love mine.,-1,0
1392,1,1,If this is your first compact digital camera you will love this one.,-1,0
1392,1,2,It is so easy to use.,-1,0
1392,1,3,I am not a great camera person and had no problem taking pictures that looked like they were made by a professional.,-1,1
1392,1,4,Now the part about the viewer not working in bright sunlite is a bit of a problem but, if you just use your body to block the sun from the viewer it will work just fine.,-1,1
1392,1,5,I don't see how you could find a much better camera without a viewer built in like some have.,-1,1
1392,1,6,I really don't see that it is such a big deal that it doesn't have a viewer.,-1,1
1392,1,7,Doesn't bother me I just wanted a camera that takes great pictures and this one sure does.,-1,1
1393,1,0,Olympus 740 Digital Camera.,-1,0
1393,1,1,This is a great camera.,-1,0
1393,1,2,Only problem is you simply can not see any image on it in bright sunlight.,-1,1
1393,1,3,Works great indoors and in medium to low light outdoors.,-1,1
1393,1,4,Will not produce an image you can see on the viewfinder in bright sunlight.,-1,1
1393,1,5,The others who said this was the case are 100% correct.,-1,0
1394,1,0,Olympus 740 Review.,-1,0
1394,1,1,I have had several pocket digital cameras but this is excellent.,-1,0
1394,1,2,Easy to use and I wanted a longer zoom, and this has a true 5x optical zoom.,-1,0
1394,1,3,The pictures came out very good and the battery life is very good.,-1,0
1394,1,4,My only complaint is that the screen is very hard to see in bright sunlight, but I think all cameras in this range without a viewfinder have the same problem.Also, the price was great.I would recommend this camera and I like the blue color- it is different from the rest.,-1,0
1395,1,0,Best Olympus yet.,-1,0
1395,1,1,A gift for my daughter and her husband, this is the 3rd Olympus Digital Camera in 5 years that I have purchased.,-1,0
1395,1,2,I use one of them at least every other day and they all still work great.,-1,0
1395,1,3,The size, quality and features can't be beat.,-1,0
1396,1,0,Olympus Stylus 740--A Great Little Camera.,-1,0
1396,1,1,I bought this camera for my wife.,-1,0
1396,1,2,She wanted one that was small enough to fit into her purse without taking up space.,-1,0
1396,1,3,It was my aim to buy a quality camera that would not be outdated by the time Christmas was over with.,-1,0
1396,1,4,This camera turned out to be a real gem.,-1,0
1396,1,5,My expectations were surpassed.,-1,0
1396,1,6,It takes great pictures that are equivalent and somewhat better than the digital SLR I bought two years ago.,-1,0
1396,1,7,The buttons and features are easy to use and the display is very clear.,-1,0
1396,1,8,The water resistance was tested on Christams day (It was very rainy that day) and passed with flying colors.,-1,0
1396,1,9,Overall, I am happy with my purchase and will look to Olympus for future camera needs.,-1,0
1397,1,0,Had it for one weekend and returned it.,-1,1
1397,1,1,Main problem was the lack of an optical viewfinder.,-1,1
1397,1,2,Trying outside shots, the LCD washed out so badly in the sun, I could barely make out what I shooting.,-1,1
1397,1,3,Could not compose; could not ensure it focused correctly.,-1,1
1397,1,4,Terrible!,-1,1
1397,1,5,(Of course, this could be an issue with any camera with no viewfinder; Don't know.)Inside,-1,1
1397,1,6,issue was with flash.,-1,1
1397,1,7,Tended to overexpose subjects giving them a washed out look.Small, light, quick flash recycle, and nice zoom.,-1,1
1397,1,8,Too bad...,-1,1
1398,1,0,LCD DISPLAY.,-1,1
1398,1,1,Read the professional and user reviews.,-1,1
1398,1,2,This is a great looking camera with great features.,-1,0
1398,1,3,BUT the LCD display ruins the product.,-1,1
1398,1,4,I did not buy but tested a camera in same family with the same LCD display.,-1,1
1398,1,5,Indoors, the display was barely passable.,-1,1
1398,1,6,Outdoors, the display was unacceptable.,-1,1
1398,1,7,Glare, reflection, and impossible to frame the shot.Do not buy without checking the display first.,-1,1
1398,1,8,If only using inside, the display is OK, but you probably do not need the 5X zoom.,-1,1
1399,1,0,Best Bang for Your Buck.,-1,0
1399,1,1,This camera does everything I would expect from a camera costing much more.,-1,0
1399,1,2,It is easy to master and fits into a shirt pocket or small purse.,-1,0
1399,1,3,I made a mistake buying too small a card.,-1,1
1399,1,4,Don't but anything smaller than 1GB, the price for the larger card is insignificant seeing you will keep this camera numerous years.,-1,1
1400,1,0,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!! DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!,-1,1
1400,1,1,I am not a digital camera novice so when I read the negative reviews, I assumed they just didn't know what they were doing.,-1,1
1400,1,2,Well, I was wrong, this camera is horrible!,-1,1
1400,1,3,It takes great shots outside but you can't tell that when you take them b/c of the lack of a viewfinder, it is all but impossible to see the picture you are taking.,-1,1
1400,1,4,The major problem is that all of the pictures of my daughter's first 4 months of life are so grainy as to be unusable.,-1,1
1400,1,5,This camera is the worst I have ever used indoors.,-1,1
1400,1,6,No matter what setting you use, it is terrible!,-1,1
1400,1,7,Unless you only plan on using it outdoors in the shade, do not buy this camera!,-1,1
1400,1,8,I will never be able to regain those pictures, I hope you make the smart choice & don't have to go thru the same thing.,-1,1
1401,1,0,Great little camera.,-1,0
1401,1,1,I got this camera in March of 2007, and was very pleased when I received it.,-1,1
1401,1,2,The size is even smaller than I expected, and the color is a dazzling blue.It has a lot of different settings for different environments where you'll be taking pictures.,-1,1
1401,1,3,The ones I've used the most - a document setting for taking pictures of documents (I have no copy machine or scanner so this comes in handy when I need to scan an item), a setting for cuisine (I like to cook and share my recipes online so this comes in handy when sharing my food with others over the web), and available light (uses whatever light is present in the room without using a flash - helps when I'm trying to avoid red-eye or get a more natural look to my indoor pictures).,-1,1
1401,1,4,The available light setting will cut down on the image quality  if the light present isn't sufficient.,-1,1
1401,1,5,It also has a museum setting that automatically shuts off the sound of the camera so that you don't disturb those around you in a quiet setting.The fact that it's so cute and tiny is a big bonus - I love showing this thing off!The only thing I find is missing is the view finder.,-1,1
1401,1,6,I understand that it might be to cut down on the size of the camera, but taking pictures in really bright light - you miss it.,-1,1
1401,1,7,I couldn't see a thing on the screen during sunny days - even the "brighter screen" didn't do much for it, and the light on a sunny day is so intense it's hard to even find what the light balance view is reading.,-1,1
1401,1,8,This is a serious design flaw and I seriously considered returning the camera for this reason - it's just too cute and little to return though.,-1,1
1401,1,9,It's great for bringing to parties and as a general picture-taker that is slim for traveling.,-1,1
1401,1,10,The fact that I don't have to worry about the weather when I take it with me is a big plus as well.,-1,1
1402,1,0,Great Camera.,-1,0
1402,1,1,This small camera is BIG in features.,-1,0
1402,1,2,WIth 7 megapix the detail of the photos are awesome and very clear.,-1,0
1402,1,3,The zoom feature is great but the best features are the compact size (can fit in a shirt pocket) and the ease of the control buttons.,-1,0
1402,1,4,After dealing with lots of other digital cameras that had difficult to use control features such as deleting a photo or organizing your photos, this camera has proven to be the EASIEST camera I have ever had to operate.,-1,0
1402,1,5,Even a child can figure this one out.,-1,0
1402,1,6,I LOVE IT!,-1,0
1403,1,0,Just don't use it outside.,-1,0
1403,1,1,This camera is compact and has many great features, but the LCD screen is so bright that it is impossible to take photos outside.,-1,0
1403,1,2,I need to be able to take photos both inside and outside so I exchanged the camera for one with a view-finder.,-1,0
1403,1,3,Bottom line, if you want to take photos outside this camera is useless.,-1,0
1404,1,0,Great zooming but bad LCD.,-1,0
1404,1,1,Having owned this camera, I can say that the picture quality matches its specifications.,-1,0
1404,1,2,5X optical zoom is great.,-1,0
1404,1,3,The only thing I found annoying is its LCD in the outside.,-1,1
1404,1,4,You coudn't see a damn thing on its screen when it is sunny outside.,-1,1
1404,1,5,So, I returned it after using for one month.,-1,1
1405,1,0,Lens cover doesn't close fully.,-1,1
1405,1,1,I had previously owned this model of camera, which is very small and takes pretty good photos.,-1,1
1405,1,2,I lost the 1st one, so  I purchased a refurbished one.,-1,1
1405,1,3,This refurbushed one, which I purchased to take on vacation, day 2, of photo taking, the len's cover got stuck in the 1/2 open position.,-1,1
1405,1,4,So now the lens is in danger of getting scratched since its now at least 1/2 open all the time.,-1,1
1406,1,0,I was a camera salesman at circuit city for two years until they went out of business.,-1,1
1406,1,1,I bought this camera a year after it was released when it was on open box.,-1,1
1406,1,2,I was unaware how much price retention the camera had, I paid only $107 for the camera when it was selling for over $300 on amazon.,-1,1
1406,1,3,I have had nothing but blurry, overly washed out photos from this camera.,-1,1
1406,1,4,I owned the 790 previously and sold it because of its lack of zoom.,-1,1
1406,1,5,The 740's zoom is the only thing I have been pleased with.,-1,1
1406,1,6,I used a friend's canon camera that was much cheaper than $300 and it absolutely blew my camera out of the water.,-1,1
1406,1,7,This was the third Olympus I have owned and I will never buy anything but canon from now on.,-1,1
1407,1,0,Not for the price.,-1,1
1407,1,1,I usually follow Consumer Report in everything I buy but decided to go off the beaten track this one time as I thought their choices were out-dated.,-1,1
1407,1,2,I should have gone with their reviews.,-1,1
1407,1,3,Maybe I don't know how to use this but I have never taken so many blurry pictures in my life.,-1,1
1407,1,4,I have considered getting my old film camera out and using that again instead.,-1,1
1407,1,5,I tried to take several pictures of my son goign down a little hill on his sled but none turned out, all blurry and/or too dark.,-1,1
1407,1,6,I was very disappointed as we were visiting grandma and we don't get snow where we live so this was a one-time opporuntiy.,-1,1
1407,1,7,I like being able to carry it in my purase at all times to take last minute shots but what good is it if they don't turn out.,-1,1
1407,1,8,I'm constantly correcting them in Photo Shop and there is only so far you can go before they start looking grainy.,-1,1
1407,1,9,Anyway had I not waited a year to really try it out I would have returned it and checked with Consumer Report to see what would be a good buy.,-1,1
1407,1,10,I still may just give this to my 4-yr old son and get a better camera for me.,-1,1
1407,1,11,We didn't get nearly as many good shots on our Disney vacation as I would have like.,-1,1
1407,1,12,Like one other reviewer said it takes too long for the photo to take and you miss alot when you're taking pictures of children.,-1,1
1408,1,0,not fast enough.,-1,1
1408,1,1,I have had my Olympus 740 for about a year.,-1,1
1408,1,2,I mostly take photos of my now 18 month old.,-1,1
1408,1,3,I usually get photos of where he just was because it takes so long to take the picture!,-1,1
1408,1,4,Also, if I take pictures in the school gym, like for the school concerts, they ALL come out blurry.,-1,1
1408,1,5,I thought that perhaps I just needed a professional camera, but then tried my sister-in-law's point and shoot fuji camera (can't recall the model) and it was WAY faster!,-1,1
1408,1,6,And the photos she e-mails me are a lot sharper and have better color.,-1,1
1408,1,7,My olympus has a lot of "features.",-1,1
1408,1,8,I do like the candle light option, and I like the one when you hold the trigger down and it takes a bunch of pictures one after the other.,-1,1
1408,1,9,But it usually takes about 8 seconds between shots.,-1,1
1408,1,10,Thats too long if  your subject is moving, or if you want to capture a cute or funny moment.,-1,1
1408,1,11,If you want great photographs, look elsewhere.,-1,1
1409,1,0,Not the Best Indoor Pictures.,-1,1
1409,1,1,Takes great outdoor pictures.,-1,1
1409,1,2,Indoor pictures are not the same.,-1,1
1409,1,3,I took more blurry indoor pictures from this camera than all my cameras combined.,-1,1
1409,1,4,Recommend to leave the flash on at all times to minimize this problem.,-1,1
1409,1,5,Using the image stabilizer indoor tend to produce pictures that are too dark to be any good.,-1,1
1409,1,6,Using the zoom indoor for long distance shots tend to produce blurry pictures as well unless the camera is placed on a tripod.,-1,1
1409,1,7,I would not buy this camera for the zooming or image stabilizing feature.,-1,1
1410,1,0,Excellent product.,-1,0
1410,1,1,The Olympus 740 is a GREAT camera.,-1,0
1410,1,2,It is easy to use in the auto mode and also gives the opportunity to set the camera for specific shots if one chooses.,-1,0
1410,1,3,The only drawback is it is very difficult to see the screen in bright sunlight.,-1,1
1410,1,4,I am enjoying the 740 and have had wonderful results.,-1,0
1411,1,0,Great Camera!,-1,0
1411,1,1,I bought this for my Daughter, who is 22.,-1,0
1411,1,2,She LOVES all the great features and clear pictures which it produces.,-1,0
1411,1,3,She specifically enjoys the range of editing capabilities built into the camera.,-1,0
1412,1,0,Short Life:  3 Years.,-1,0
1412,1,1,Mine is the Olympus U 700 All-Weather 7.1 Megapixels.,-1,0
1412,1,2,I loved this camera and do not know what the normal lifespan of a camera like this is.,-1,0
1412,1,3,It lasted 3 years.,-1,0
1412,1,4,It just suddenly "died", the screen went blue with a few numbers on it.,-1,0
1412,1,5,I've been told it could be the lense, in which case, it would cost around US$100 to have repaired.,-1,1
1413,1,0,Love it !,-1,0
1413,1,1,I have this camera for years!,-1,0
1413,1,2,Love the quality and different settings.,-1,0
1413,1,3,My friend printed a poster from a picture that I took and it looks very professional.,-1,0
1414,1,0,olympus 740.,-1,0
1414,1,1,I have purchased 3 of the 740's mainly for the 5x optical and wish they did not discontinue this model.,-1,0
1414,1,2,It does everything I need in a ultracompact digital camera.,-1,0
1414,1,3,Great camera and great service from Amazon with putting me in touch with reputable sellers.,-1,0
1415,1,0,nice camera.,-1,0
1415,1,1,it a nice camera and easy to carry it will fit in your pocket i am satisfied,-1,0
1416,1,0,Great Deal.,-1,0
1416,1,1,This camera is easy to use and has a great zoom.,-1,0
1416,1,2,Cheap considering all the functions it has.A great product!,-1,0
1417,1,0,Superior picture quality, small and reliable.,-1,0
1417,1,1,Having owned three previous digital cameras, I felt capable of making an informed decision for this one.,-1,0
1417,1,2,Our family required another small pocket sized camera and we chose the Olympus because of the quality, features and waterproof feature.,-1,0
1417,1,3,The pictures are very good quality and reproduce well.,-1,0
1417,1,4,My complaints are the the lack of a viewfinder, making it difficult on sunny days to see the object your taking a picture of and the actual viewing screen lines are annoying to me.,-1,1
1417,1,5,Other than that, the camera is worth the price and you are safe if it gets wet in any way.,-1,1
1417,1,6,I used it on a recent ski trip and barely noticed it in my pocket, the same holds true for my other family members.,-1,1
1417,1,7,By the way, we take over 1000 pictures/year in various formats, so this is a valid photographers point of view.,-1,1
1418,1,0,Best digital camera I have found.,-1,1
1418,1,1,This was my first digital camera, and after reading everything I could get my hands on to read about digital cameras I chose this one.,-1,1
1418,1,2,It so happens that the last 35mm camera I owned for years was also an Olympus!,-1,1
1419,1,0,Not bad for price.,-1,1
1419,1,1,You get what you pay forPro: Cheap, Varifocal, Dome,low amperage, Works well in low ligh ( not dark, But hotel hallway low light)Easy to mount, Not heavy at all so no crazy anchors where neededCon: Very thin plastic case, even with the varifocal 4-9mm, Did not pick up as wide of an angle as the 4-9mm it replaced.,-1,1
1419,1,2,Was off about 1.5 feet on a 10 foot distance.,-1,0
1419,1,3,Camera carriage or swivel, Not sure of its name is only 2 axis, So was limited on wall mounted placements.,-1,0
1419,1,4,Dome comes off way to easy, simple twist, So don't mount within reach of people or kids.Other: overall, Happy, Worked great as indoor cameras on high ceiling in hotels, No real complaints and will use again,-1,0
1420,1,0,Nice addition to my video distribution system.,-1,1
1420,1,1,I've had this on my system for about a month now with no problems.,-1,1
1420,1,2,I'm using it to assign a channel to my baby cameras so I can put them on my whole-house video distribution system.,-1,1
1420,1,3,This thing works just as the manufacturer claims.,-1,1
1420,1,4,It's smaller than a deck of cards, lightweight, and it's easy to set the output channel.,-1,1
1420,1,5,The video quality is great--completely clear.,-1,0
1420,1,6,It might not be the cheapest, but I've been using another surveillance camera/modulator combo by Net Media for 2 years with zero problems so I trust the company.,-1,0
1421,1,0,Great little box.,-1,0
1421,1,1,We bought this modulator to get access from a video feed into a room with only RF access.,-1,0
1421,1,2,Very easy to install; the RF signal looks great.,-1,0
1421,1,3,We aren;'t using the audio path, but if it's as good as the video to RF conversion, ten the audio should sound fantastic also.,-1,0
1422,1,0,Similar to the Z30, but better for one reason.,-1,1
1422,1,1,I love Fuji cameras - and no, I'm not a Fuji employee, but maybe I should be - I would love an employee discount!,-1,1
1422,1,2,This Z37 was a deal I couldn't refuse and I believe this is my 10th Fuji digital camera I've purchased since 2004.,-1,1
1422,1,3,I got the purple color and it's beautiful.I owned the Z30 Fujifilm FinePix Z30 10 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Whirl White) previously, but at the last minute I decided to gift it to a young relative of mine only because of one thing I disliked about it: On the Z30 the USB plug-in was located INSIDE the camera's battery compartment.,-1,1
1422,1,4,I feared the latch would eventually break off since the USB plug, the battery and the memory card were all in the same area.Instead, the Z37 Fuji has the USB plug on the SIDE of the camera.,-1,1
1422,1,5,With the Z37 you get an AC adapter cable in addition to the USB cable.,-1,1
1422,1,6,The AC adapter charges the battery inside the camera.,-1,1
1422,1,7,So unless I'm removing the memory card on this camera, there is no reason to open the battery compartment.The AC adapter replaces the separate battery charger that comes with the Z30.,-1,1
1422,1,8,This also means if your battery runs low, you can use the Z37 with it plugged into an outlet, but of course, this does limit what you can take a picture of, unless it's something near the electric outlet.The Z37 is slightly thinner than the Z30 but otherwise they appear to be the same.,-1,1
1422,1,9,Same LCD size, and the buttons are located in the same configuration.,-1,1
1422,1,10,The LCD is big and bright - I have no trouble seeing anything outside in the bright sun.,-1,1
1422,1,11,It's tiny and lightweight and easy to carry in either a pocket or small bag - it weighs slightly over 4 ounces.And since the lens has a cover - and this is the way the camera is powered on/off - by sliding the lens cover open (like the first Fuji digital cameras invented) you almost don't need to buy a separate case....although I do keep mine in a case because I don't like the exterior to get scratched.Just one complaint with this camera, otherwise it's perfect.,-1,1
1422,1,12,There is no good area to hold onto the camera.,-1,1
1422,1,13,The entire back is composed of LCD screen and buttons.,-1,1
1422,1,14,At least the back area is rubberized so it does help with the grip.But the pro's way outnumber my single complaint:>>> Quick response when opening the lens cover to take the first shot>>> SR Auto - just point and shoot>>> Takes beautiful pictures>>> Fast response time after taking a flash picture>>> Lithium-ion battery - one charge lasts over 200 pictures>>> Takes good videos - better than my expensive Panasonic LumixNote about the videos:  You can't use optical zoom once you start filming, but you can set it before.,-1,1
1422,1,15,You can use digital zoom after you start filming, but you have to turn it on before-hand in the set-up menu.,-1,1
1422,1,16,They aren't HD but they look pretty good.Note about the SR Auto setting:  This setting drains the battery a little quicker, because the lens and sensor is constantly evaluating and focusing whatever you have the camera pointed at - the lens noise is completely normal and nothing to worry about.,-1,1
1422,1,17,If you don't want to hear the lens focusing, just set the camera on regular Auto instead (the picture of the camera icon).In conclusion: This is a good entry-level camera and I recommend it for just about anyone who is looking for an easy to use camera.,-1,1
1422,1,18,Even a young kid.,-1,1
1422,1,19,And it's built tougher than it appears - since the lens zooms INSIDE the camera body.,-1,1
1422,1,20,Case in point: Two days after I received my Z30, it slipped out of my hands and hit the kitchen floor (my condo is built on a slab).,-1,1
1422,1,21,I thought the camera was broken, but I turned it back on and was none worse for the wear.,-1,1
1422,1,22,This Z37 appears to be built just as tough as the Z30 which I dropped.It comes with just 18 MB of internal memory, so pick up an SD card if you don't already have one.,-1,1
1423,1,0,Great.,-1,1
1423,1,1,This camera is small enough to carry everywhere and it gets better!,-1,1
1423,1,2,It takes pictures quickly with high resolution.,-1,1
1423,1,3,The lens is inside the camera so you won't have to worry whether you will break the lens if you drop it ( i dropped my Nikon camera on accident and immediately broke the lens).,-1,1
1423,1,4,It is really a fun camera to have as well an simple.,-1,0
1423,1,5,The buttons are sealed so that any dirt or water wont go through and ruin the camera or the button.,-1,0
1423,1,6,I would recommend this camera to anyone that is looking for a cute portable camera that takes great shots.,-1,0
1424,1,0,This is a screamin' deal on an entry level camera!,-1,0
1424,1,1,I am a bit of a camera nut and have a few, none would be described as entry-level.,-1,0
1424,1,2,After loads of research, I bought two of these cameras for my teenage granddaughters; it will be a first for both of them.,-1,0
1424,1,3,I was skeptical when I ordered, that a camera in this price range could actually have any substance but I was more than pleasantly surprised when the cameras arrived.,-1,0
1424,1,4,I charged them up and have been playing with them all afternoon (so I can help the girls with the learning curve, of course) and am having a blast with them.,-1,0
1424,1,5,Now I want one for myself, even though I don't need it!,-1,0
1424,1,6,I'm not saying that this will produce the results that a higher end camera will, but it is tiny, loaded with features and will be perfect as a starter camera.,-1,0
1424,1,7,Everything outlined in the description is there as described and easy to access if you are even a little bit familiar with how cameras work these days - no manual necessary to start having loads of fun!,-1,0
1424,1,8,At this price, I think you would be hard pressed to find a match.,-1,0
1425,1,0,Great portable and inexpensive camera!,-1,0
1425,1,1,This camera is great for most occasions.,-1,0
1425,1,2,It is definitely not the best in terms of picture quality, but then again, if you want to get more, you have to spend a lot more.,-1,0
1425,1,3,For the money, this is a great every-day-use camera.Pros:+ Light weight+ Inexpensive+ Good looking+ 3x zoom without a protruding lenseCons:- Not the best image quality, but still good for most occasions- Auto ISO only, but an every day user would not touch those adjustments anyways,-1,0
1426,1,0,I bought this camera for my 8 year old daughter.,-1,0
1426,1,1,She Loves it.,-1,0
1426,1,2,The color is vibrant and the picture quality is wonderful.,-1,0
1426,1,3,For the price and for what it is this camera is a great purchase.,-1,0
1426,1,4,I would recommend and, in fact, bought myself and my other daughter one as well.,-1,0
1427,1,0,Was a GREAT GIFT to give!!!,-1,0
1427,1,1,I own 2 Fugi cameras, and they are great so I decided to buy one for a friend for Christmas.,-1,0
1427,1,2,My friend is a long haul truck driver and she loves to take pictures of the good ol USA.,-1,0
1427,1,3,She has told me how easy this camera is to use, and she's not the most technical savy person, but she loves it.,-1,0
1427,1,4,She emails me pictures from all over the US and they are beautiful.,-1,0
1427,1,5,So if you are considering an easy to use camera that takes beautiful pictures take a look at this camera, you won't be disappointed in the Fugifilm Finepix Z37.,-1,0
1428,1,0,Love it!,-1,0
1428,1,1,This camera is so easy to use.,-1,0
1428,1,2,It comes on when you slide open to reveal the lens.,-1,0
1428,1,3,By the time I figured out how to use it, a lot of the times, the moment I wanted to capture was over.,-1,0
1428,1,4,Thanks for this great camera.,-1,0
1428,1,5,It was also delivered super fast in perfect condtion.,-1,0
1429,1,0,My Daughter Loves it.,-1,1
1429,1,1,I bought this camera for my daughter  (teenager)  .,-1,1
1429,1,2,this product met both of our requirements.,-1,1
1429,1,3,1) The photo quality is great 2) The lens is protected when the camera is off.,-1,1
1429,1,4,3) Cost, There's real value here for the money it's terrific.,-1,1
1429,1,5,4) Ease of use, the menu controls are wonderfully laid out and are a breeze to use.,-1,1
1429,1,6,4) She wanted a cool color.,-1,1
1429,1,7,I could have spent five times the money on something else and she would not been as happy.,-1,1
1429,1,8,5) Size,  It is a tiny camera.,-1,0
1429,1,9,it will fit in a pocket or a purse without a problem.,-1,0
1429,1,10,6) memory, uses inexpensive SD media with an internal rechargeable battery.,-1,0
1430,1,0,Low quality pictures.,-1,0
1430,1,1,I bought this camera for my daughter, she loved the color and that it had a rechagable battery.,-1,0
1430,1,2,There was also some cool things you can do with the photos.,-1,0
1430,1,3,However the picture quality was horrible.,-1,0
1430,1,4,The pictues were too bright.,-1,1
1430,1,5,No matter how much tweeking I did, the pictures came out the same.,-1,1
1430,1,6,It looked like the camera focus a clear shot right before the camera snaped, but the pictures still came out too bright.,-1,1
1430,1,7,To think this is suppose to be a 10 mega pixle camera.,-1,1
1430,1,8,No exaggeration, my phone camera actually took better pictures than this camera.,-1,1
1431,1,0,Great little camera!,-1,1
1431,1,1,I bought this for my 7 year old daughter after extensive research on the internet of various brands, models and price ranges.,-1,1
1431,1,2,I was looking for something with durability, ease of use and a rechargeable battery.,-1,1
1431,1,3,The lens remains protected and does not protrude out when the camera is turned on, a great feature for a 7-year old who is apt to drop or bump the camera at some time in the future.,-1,0
1431,1,4,The Finepix Z37 is VERY simple to use and I would highly recommend to anyone who does not want to sift through all the complicated features and buttons of a pricier camera.,-1,0
1431,1,5,The charging process is simpler than most, the cable just attaches to the camera, no separate battery charger needed and the battery does not need to be removed from the camera to be charged.,-1,1
1431,1,6,We are very happy with it.,-1,1
1431,1,7,The camera does everything you'd want in a digital (even movies!) and I'd highly recommend it.,-1,1
1432,1,0,Great picture quality!,-1,0
1432,1,1,If you are looking for an inexpensive point-and-shoot that takes great pictures of your family, you won't be disappointed.,-1,0
1432,1,2,I upgraded from the Z30, which was fine.,-1,0
1432,1,3,But the Z37 takes much clearer pictures.,-1,0
1432,1,4,And for those of us who enjoy beautiful objects, this camera is absolutely GORGEOUS!! Makes me happy just holding it!,-1,0
1433,1,0,my first digital.,-1,0
1433,1,1,I've had this camera for a couple of months now and I'm thrilled with it.,-1,0
1433,1,2,I just learned to download pics on the internet & I'm like a kid in a candy store.,-1,0
1433,1,3,I was a little surprised at small it is but that makes it pretty easy to carry around.,-1,0
1433,1,4,It takes great pics & I love the timer feature.,-1,0
1433,1,5,I'm extremely happy with the camera.,-1,0
1433,1,6,Small price for a fabulous camera.,-1,0
1433,1,7,I'm learning new things about it all the time.,-1,0
1433,1,8,It's just the cutest thing & I love it.,-1,0
1434,1,0,Similar to the Z30, but better for one reason.,-1,1
1434,1,1,I love Fuji cameras - and no, I'm not a Fuji employee, but maybe I should be - I would love an employee discount!,-1,1
1434,1,2,This Z37 was a deal I couldn't refuse and I believe this is my 10th Fuji digital camera I've purchased since 2004.,-1,1

1435,1,0,I bought this camera for my daughter (age 8) from the Easter Bunny.,-1,1
1435,1,1,It was not until Easter Sunday after she received the camera did I notice that this camera DOES NOT TAKE AA BATTERIES as stated in the description on Amazon.,-1,1
1435,1,2,The description listed on Amazon for Fujifilm Finepix Z37 states this camera "powered by AA batteries (included).",-1,1
1435,1,3,That was one of several reasons I selected this camera for my daughter.,-1,1
1435,1,4,The camera takes battery NP-45 not AA batteries!,-1,1
1435,1,5,I contemplated returning the camera but how could I take back the camera from my daughter who was totally excited and can't stop taking picture with it?The camera is easy to operate.,-1,1
1435,1,6,My daughter loves the mini clips she can record.,-1,1
1435,1,7,This is a good starter camera.I would have rated this camera with 4 stars but deducted a star due to the error in the description posted on Amazon and the fact that the camera takes NP-45 battery and not AA batteries.,-1,1
1436,1,0,Buy it.,-1,0
1436,1,1,For the price this camera is great.,-1,0
1436,1,2,it's super small, has lots of options and the pic quality is pretty darn good.,-1,0
1436,1,3,Plus it's purple :)  very happy with this camera!,-1,0
1437,1,0,Better than the old.,-1,1
1437,1,1,So, the last camera i had was a digital polaroid touch screen.,-1,1
1437,1,2,It was a good camera, until i broke it.,-1,0
1437,1,3,So i had to find a new one quickly.,-1,0
1437,1,4,I saw this one and was interested in it because of its funky color and it was cheap!,-1,0
1437,1,5,(im only 12) so i ordered it the next day.,-1,0
1437,1,6,This camera is really good! ive taken awesome pictures with it outside.,-1,0
1437,1,7,Very easy to use also.,-1,0
1437,1,8,The only bad thing about it is if your inside andyou dont have the flash on the pictures can be blurry.,-1,1
1437,1,9,i'll post some pictures i took with this camera on my account so feel free to look at anymore pictures!,-1,1
1438,1,0,Good Camera.,-1,0
1438,1,1,This camera is a really good camera.,-1,0
1438,1,2,The pictures it takes are crystal clear.,-1,0
1438,1,3,Usually if you take a picture without flash, the picture will have a orange tint to it, and it's a little fuzzy.,-1,0
1438,1,4,I'm very big on taking videos, and this camera takes the most amazing videos.,-1,0
1438,1,5,The only thing I don't like, is you can't zoom in or out while shooting a video.,-1,0
1439,1,0,Amazing!!!!!!!! My dad bought me this camera for my great grades and it is amazing!!!!!!!,-1,0
1439,1,1,I love the size and battery life!,-1,0
1439,1,2,It is great for taking pictures of my dog and freinds!,-1,0
1439,1,3,The only thing im having trouble with is how to change the color of the pics like to black and white for instance but thats perfectly fine!!!!!!!!!!!!,-1,0
1440,1,0,great camera for young photographer.,-1,0
1440,1,1,Haven't presented this gift to my 8 year-old granddaughter yet, but having reviewed the manual and played with it myself, I think this is going to be a wonderful camera for her.,-1,1
1440,1,2,It's sturdy and easy to use, even for small fingers and someone who wears glasses.,-1,0
1441,1,0,Perfect Gift.,-1,0
1441,1,1,We bought this camera for our 13 yr old daughter and she LOVES it!,-1,0
1441,1,2,The color is what caught our attention ( purple is her lastest crave ) and the color was very vibrant and bright!,-1,0
1441,1,3,The quality is good and the size is perfect.,-1,0
1441,1,4,She had no trouble using it, very easy for her.,-1,0
1441,1,5,I would recommend this camera.,-1,0
1442,1,0,Small camera CRAPPY PICTURES.,-1,1
1442,1,1,I had a previous model of this camera that I had for four years - i LOVED IT.,-1,1
1442,1,2,So when my kids dropped it and it broke I quickly got online to purchase another camera.,-1,1
1442,1,3,I ordered model and have been unhappy ever since.,-1,1
1442,1,4,If I could return it I would but I waited to long.,-1,1
1442,1,5,The pictures come out horrible.,-1,1
1442,1,6,THey are discolored, blurry or can't be used.,-1,1
1442,1,7,And I am an avid picture taker (novice but still all the time) I never go anywhere with out my camera.,-1,1
1442,1,8,It bothers me so much because I take and use my pictures for personal and work use.,-1,1
1443,1,0,Great little camera.,-1,0
1443,1,1,I just got this little purple camera(Santa came early) The pictures are wonderful.,-1,0
1443,1,2,Clear crisp.,-1,0
1443,1,3,Child friendly.,-1,0
1443,1,4,Let's see how my eclipse pics from this morning turn out.,-1,0
1444,1,0,Will not charge.,-1,1
1444,1,1,Would be a decent camera if it would charge!,-1,1
1444,1,2,Had to ship it back to Fuji at my cost to ship as I was at day 31 and Amazon would not take it back.,-1,1
1444,1,3,After 2 months, got a new one back from Fuji and it charged a total of 1 time...  Now I'm stuck with a non-functioning camera again.,-1,1
1444,1,4,Ordered a external battery charger today through Ebay as it was cheaper to do that then to play these games for the rest of my life!,-1,1
1445,1,0,ok for the price.,-1,0
1445,1,1,I bought this for my mom and had it sent to her.,-1,0
1445,1,2,She had numerous problems with it but she's 82.,-1,1
1445,1,3,The buttons were too small for her for one thing, but most troubling for her was she told me the screen is almost impossible to see if using it outdoors.I checked it out and had no problems with the buttons and controls, but as others have mentioned here you can't see the screen in outdoor light even with the brightness cranked up, and there is no viewfinder so one just has to aim it and hope for the best.This wouldn't be a big deal for me considering how inexpensive it is and my mom said she would live with it, but if I had paid more I would probably return it and get something else.It's definitely small and seems to be put together well.,-1,1
1445,1,4,In general I like Fuji products.,-1,1
1445,1,5,I have an older Fuji digital and the screen is much easier to see in daylight so I think they missed the mark with this one.,-1,1
1446,1,0,2nd time buyer of this camera...,-1,0
1446,1,1,I first bought this camera after my high school graduation in 2009.,-1,0
1446,1,2,I got it at Walmart for $250 and it was worth every penny of it.,-1,0
1446,1,3,I loved it!,-1,0
1446,1,4,The pictures were very crisp and clear.,-1,0
1446,1,5,The camera itself is on the small side.,-1,0
1446,1,6,It's somewhat thin and easy to hide in your pocket, perfect for sneak attacks.,-1,0
1446,1,7,I'm one of those people who love to take pictures of anything and everything and this camera does the job beautifully.,-1,0
1446,1,8,School events, birthdays, nature, action photos, and profile pics are all easy to take with it.,-1,0
1446,1,9,The video feature was pretty cool too although I didn't mess with it that much.,-1,0
1446,1,10,The only difference between the 2 is that my 1st camera was orange.,-1,0
1446,1,11,Anyways my camera came up missing last fall and I liked it so much I bought it again.,-1,0
1446,1,12,And it's cheaper this time!,-1,0
1447,1,0,Good Camera, Low Price.,-1,1
1447,1,1,This camera I bought before my road trip back east beacause...well my other camera just wouldn't work.,-1,1
1447,1,2,So I got this one because it was relatively cheap and seemed pretty reliable to me; except for the color, I'm a dude and purple just isn't my thing.,-1,1
1447,1,3,But getting back to the camera, I found it very responsive when I saw something along the road and needed to take a quick picture of whatever it was and I was very pleased with the picture quality.,-1,1
1447,1,4,The camera is very light weight and very compact, just a tad wider than my lg rumor 2 phone.,-1,1
1447,1,5,I also must say that it's pretty durable to because while on vacation, I dropped it down a flight of stone stairs at my friends house and when we looked at it, everything was fine except for a few scratches!,-1,1
1448,1,0,Good Choice.,-1,0
1448,1,1,I have not used it much as I have not had time off work yet.,-1,0
1448,1,2,But I do like the quality of the pictures that I have took.,-1,0
1449,1,0,I LOVE this camera!,-1,0
1449,1,1,I had been looking for a while for an inexpensive camera to replace my old Vivitar, but every camera I found that had good reviews was over $100.The Vivitar I had is very confusing, and most of what I needed was buried in the menu.,-1,0
1449,1,2,I no longer have the manual, so I frequently ended up with effects that I did not want because I couldnt figure out the controls.,-1,0
1449,1,3,It also ate batteries at an alarming rate.I found this camera at a VERY good price, and the reviews were favorable, so I ordered it.I LOVE it!I love the size - its about half the size of my old camera.I love the rechargeable batteries - no more hunting for AA batteries.I love the simplicity....if I want to take a video, I simply press the video button, and press it again to end the video.,-1,0
1449,1,4,The camera uses a format that can easily be uploaded to the internet (which my old Vivitar did not).If I want to take a picture, I simply slide the cover open, look into the nice large screen, and snap.I love the automatic features - I am usually taking pictures of my foster dogs for the shelter website, and, of course, they tend to move when I snap the picture.,-1,0
1449,1,5,This camera captures them anyway, and adjusts the color nicely regardless of the light.I do have the manual for this camera, but I havent even needed it yet.,-1,0
1449,1,6,I have already take new pics, taken a video and uploaded it to the shelter website, all from just studying the buttons.The only thing I DONT love is the software.,-1,1
1449,1,7,It is glitchy (when I loaded it onto my computer it immediately quit working, and asked me to download a fix for it).,-1,1
1449,1,8,Its not intuitive, and I havent been able to dowload anything with the cable yet.But thats okay - I just removed my card from the old camera, put it in the new one, and avoided the whole issue by using the software I already had.,-1,1
1450,1,0,Bought this camera for my 10 year old daughter.,-1,0
1450,1,1,She was so happy to see how cute the camera was.,-1,0
1450,1,2,It's a light colored, metallic purple.,-1,0
1450,1,3,Very pretty.,-1,0
1450,1,4,It's also compact and light.,-1,0
1450,1,5,It has lots of features and she loves the video feature.,-1,0
1450,1,6,The best part about this camera is that it has it's own rechargeable battery.,-1,0
1450,1,7,Paid $70 from a store through Amazon.,-1,0
1450,1,8,I was lucky to get this super great price.,-1,0
1450,1,9,Plus I received free shipping through Amazon.,-1,1
1450,1,10,Amazon always packs products well and ships very quick.,-1,1
1450,1,11,I love buying through Amazon!!,-1,1
1451,1,0,Nice little camera with a few flaws.,-1,0
1451,1,1,This camera is great in some ways, but lacks in other ways.,-1,0
1451,1,2,First of all, it's the perfect size and is very user friendly.,-1,0
1451,1,3,It takes very clear close-up shots and works well in daylight.,-1,0
1451,1,4,However, allow me to outline some of the drawbacks.1.,-1,0
1451,1,5,The glare on the screen is so bad that it's nearly impossible to see in sunlight.,-1,1
1451,1,6,Also, I've noticed that pictures which look very blurry on the screen tend to show up clear on my computer, so the viewing screen leaves a little to be desired.2.,-1,1
1451,1,7,This camera does not take pictures at night.,-1,1
1451,1,8,There is a night setting on the camera, and I had a Canon that took great night pics, so I was really disappointed that this one doesn't work at all on the night setting.3.,-1,1
1451,1,9,In very bright sunlight, the corners of the picture will look dark because of the reflection.,-1,1
1451,1,10,In other words the lens is placed inside the casing just enough that there is a shadow on the corners of a picture when the sun is very bright.,-1,1
1451,1,11,This has happened without fail on all my beach pics with this camera.4.,-1,0
1451,1,12,I'm not sure if this is user error or not, but when the SD card is reformatted, the file names go back to 0001.,-1,0
1451,1,13,So when I import the pics from the camera into iPhoto, half the pics in iPhoto have the same file name which is a huge pain when I'm transferring them to folders later on.,-1,0
1451,1,14,I never had this problem with my Canon, so this was another feature I was disappointed with.All in all, this is a nice little $69.99 camera.,-1,1
1451,1,15,However, were I making the choice again, I probably would have saved my money and invested in something of a little higher quality with more desirable features.,-1,1
1452,1,0,Fuji Finepix was marked "NEW" & marketed as "NEW".,-1,1
1452,1,1,The fine print on sellers info said OPENED buy not used.,-1,1
1452,1,2,OPENED for what reason??,-1,1
1452,1,3,Everything had been opened, protective film removed.,-1,1
1452,1,4,Battery out of plastic, oh yeah!! You've got to be kidding.,-1,1
1452,1,5,Then, the final blow--- the front was scratched in over 6 places, like it had been dropped & damaged.,-1,1
1452,1,6,Extremely disappointing and we got stuck paying the return shipment of $5.00- I asked for $5 back and no reply from seller or Amazon.,-1,1
1452,1,7,A total ripoff & deceitful selling of "NEW" products.IF ELECTRONICS ARE OPENED & SCRATCHED -- IT IS NOT NEW.,-1,1
1453,1,0,simple camera.,-1,0
1453,1,1,This camera is very easy to use.,-1,0
1453,1,2,It's compact and lightweight  the picture quality is good, you can easily change it as needed.,-1,0
1453,1,3,And the video function is also very simple - one button on & off.,-1,0
1454,1,0,Nice camera.,-1,0
1454,1,1,This camera was a great price for the quality.,-1,0
1454,1,2,It was used, with some signs of wear, so the price was reasonable and appropriate.,-1,0
1455,1,0,We Love This Camera.,-1,0
1455,1,1,I bought one of these as a Xmas gift for my wife.,-1,0
1455,1,2,It is so nice and compact and takes very good photos with a minimum of fuss, point and click.,-1,0
1455,1,3,I carry it in my shirt pocket, it isn't any larger than a smart phone.,-1,0
1455,1,4,The best feature is the lens cover, that alone is worth the price.,-1,0
1455,1,5,I really don't like the currently popular telescoping lens designs, they are just asking to be damaged and use a lot more battery power.Unfortunately a dog decided my wife's camera was tasty and destroyed it.,-1,0
1455,1,6,When looking for a replacement we discovered it was being discontinued but found some on Amazon.,-1,1
1455,1,7,We bought two, one as her replacement and one as a spare because I could find no other camera with the same design.,-1,1
1456,1,0,Good Camera good price.,-1,0
1456,1,1,We bought this as a back-up for our "Fujifilm Finepix Z20fd 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom".,-1,0
1456,1,2,It has fewer options but takes excellent pictures and is LINUX friendly.,-1,0
1456,1,3,Very happy with this camera.,-1,0
1457,1,0,Okay but cheap.,-1,0
1457,1,1,This is a cheap camera so the picture quality shows it.,-1,0
1457,1,2,It's super easy for the photo to blur unless its a picture of a statue that wont flinch.,-1,0
1457,1,3,It is satisfactory but the picture quality is not exactly excellent.,-1,0
1458,1,0,Did not last long.,-1,0
1458,1,1,I got this camera about a year ago and it does not work anymore.,-1,0
1458,1,2,I take good care of my things and I have never dropped the camera or let anyone else use it.,-1,0
1458,1,3,I keep getting a card error note on the screen and yet when I use the card in other cameras they work fine.,-1,1
1458,1,4,I have tried several cards and it is the same with all of them.,-1,1
1458,1,5,I even bought a new card and formatted it and the same error note came up.,-1,1
1458,1,6,I am disappointed because I wanted a small camera for parties, etc.,-1,1
1459,1,0,Pretty Good.,-1,0
1459,1,1,I really love the color on this camera and the functions.,-1,0
1459,1,2,One of the other things I love about this camera is the way the buttons are arranged.,-1,0
1459,1,3,It makes using this camera so easy, I can do it with my eyes closed.,-1,0
1459,1,4,The only thing I don't like about this camera is that it is not waterproof.,-1,0
1460,1,0,Great digital camera for an unbelievable price!,-1,0
1460,1,1,This camera is perfect.,-1,0
1460,1,2,It's compact, takes great quality pictures and the battery lasts the longest out of any digital camera I have ever had.,-1,0
1460,1,3,I have had it for 3 weeks and only fully charged it once - it still has battery life!,-1,0
1460,1,4,I definitely recommend this as a choice that is attractive & usefull without putting a dent in your budget.,-1,0
1460,1,5,I am very happy with my purchase!,-1,0
1461,1,0,Great Value For The Money.,-1,0
1461,1,1,I am a point and shoot kind of girl.,-1,0
1461,1,2,I like a good value and this camera is just my speed.,-1,0
1461,1,3,It is easy to use and takes great photos.,-1,0
1461,1,4,You won't feel bad either when you have to replace it with all the new technology coming out so quickly.,-1,1
1461,1,5,I use a very similar one to upload photos onto Ebay and it works great.,-1,0
1462,1,0,This camera is exactly what I hoped for.,-1,1
1462,1,1,I can easily see the buttons and use them to take the type of picture I am trying to take.,-1,1
1462,1,2,Very convenient size, easy to take everyday-just in case!,-1,0
1462,1,3,Very good pictures, especially for this priced camera.,-1,0
1462,1,4,Have had more expensive cameras that I could not see to use! and never had with me due to their size!,-1,0
1462,1,5,This one is always with me ready to go! Thanks Fuji!,-1,1
1463,1,0,I already own this camera and I bought this one for my daughter.,-1,0
1463,1,1,The camera feels light and toy-like, but don't let that fool you.,-1,0
1463,1,2,This is a durable camera.I have owned a Nikon coolpix, my friend went through 2 and my sister went through 2 in 1 year- because that 'solid' camera breaks if you look at it wrong!,-1,0
1463,1,3,My friend has had the Finepix for 3 years and just throws it in her purse, along with all of her other junk.,-1,0
1463,1,4,Another friend bought it the same time I did and she loves it too.,-1,0
1463,1,5,As with any camera, you need some basic skills to take pictures.,-1,0
1463,1,6,Might be worth your time to read a few picture taking basics.,-1,0
1463,1,7,I have people thinking that some of the pictures I took with my Finepix are pictures I took with my $700 DSLR camera.,-1,0
1464,1,0,Somewhat Disappointed.,-1,1
1464,1,1,I bought the Fuji Finepix Z37 to replace an older Fuji I had.,-1,1
1464,1,2,I expected the new camera to give me a better quality photo, since the megapixels were higher than what I had previous.,-1,1
1464,1,3,I am disappointed in the photo sharpness, and would be returning it except my window for returns (30 DAYS) has passed.,-1,1
1464,1,4,I like everything about it EXCEPT the photos!,-1,1
1465,1,0,surprising quality!,-1,1
1465,1,1,Anytime I shop for an electronic, I do a lot of research.,-1,1
1465,1,2,Digital camera's are just one of those things that if you don't read reviews and compare, you may end up with something... crappy.,-1,1
1465,1,3,Well I ended up buying this lil guy and I adore it!There are plenty of picture modes, and you really should go through them.,-1,0
1465,1,4,I recently used the party mode for Halloween in a very dark room, and the pictures are clear and bright!,-1,0
1465,1,5,You also have to learn what each mode is capable of in order to get the picture to be crisp and clear.,-1,0
1465,1,6,Without the right mode you do end up with a blurry photo.The Macro is magnificent but make sure the object is really tiny since this baby can take really good shots of tiny details without it.,-1,0
1465,1,7,The autofocus is very helpful too, but don't let go of that button until it's stopped focusing!You can't be mad at the rechargeable battery.,-1,1
1465,1,8,It's another big reason why I chose this one.,-1,1
1465,1,9,Most camera's with disposable batteries just don't have a long life.,-1,1
1465,1,10,This rechargeable battery can laaaast.,-1,1
1465,1,11,I can't really say how long, but I will say that after a night of shooting pics, I didn't have to recharge until the 3rd time I used it...I only have two complaints.,-1,1
1465,1,12,The first is the actual buttons.,-1,1
1465,1,13,They are really soft, and even though I haven't had any problems yet, I'm a bit scared that I won't be able to push them in the future.,-1,1
1465,1,14,Think remote control buttons...,-1,1
1465,1,15,The second is the on/off which is just a sliding door.,-1,1
1465,1,16,It's not so bad, but if you slide it into your pocket the wrong way it does turn on.,-1,1
1465,1,17,Atleast it does have an automatic shut off feature if you haven't pressed any buttons...All in all, I do like this camera.,-1,1
1465,1,18,I'm glad I picked it.,-1,1
1466,1,0,Great design, lousy photos.,-1,0
1466,1,1,I loved the design of this camera.,-1,0
1466,1,2,I like that the lens doesn't extend out when you turn the camera on, and the protective lens cover doubling as an on/off switch is genius.,-1,1
1466,1,3,The camera was easy to use out of the box without needing to read the instructions.,-1,1
1466,1,4,The one-touch video recording is great.,-1,1
1466,1,5,But, there remained one fundamental problem for me, which is why I am returning the camera: whether I took photos indoors or outdoors, under bright light or dim light, at least 80% of the photos were not in sharp focus (even using the scene recognition mode).,-1,1
1466,1,6,I guess that's what you get if you spend less than $100 on a camera?,-1,1
1466,1,7,I was disappointed that it did not live up to the glowing reviews I read on the site.,-1,1
1466,1,8,I really wanted to like the camera, but if it can't reliably take good pictures, then I can't justify keeping it.,-1,1
1467,1,0,Nice camera.,-1,0
1467,1,1,I got this camera for my 17 year old, and she loves it.,-1,0
1467,1,2,It is very small (and purple) and is easy to use quickly.,-1,0
1467,1,3,She is able to take action shots, uploading with ease and likes the features available.,-1,0
1467,1,4,We did add a case and it would be a good addition in a package.,-1,0
1468,1,0,Nice camera.,-1,0
1468,1,1,I bought this for my daughter and she loved the color.,-1,0
1468,1,2,It works great and is very portable!,-1,0
1468,1,3,I like that there is no on / off button but simply slide the front open and you are ready for pictures.,-1,1
1468,1,4,Also, it is nice that it is rechargeable and you don't have to change batteries constantly.,-1,1
1469,1,0,For $80, you get what you pay for.,-1,1
1469,1,1,It takes great pictures & the camera has great focus.,-1,1
1469,1,2,Not too many features but it's enough for $80.,-1,0
1469,1,3,I'm happy with it.,-1,0
1469,1,4,& I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great camera on a budget.,-1,0
1469,1,5,Great for college students.,-1,0
1470,1,0,Very Happy.,-1,1
1470,1,1,This is my secod FinePix camera and I really like the Fuji.,-1,1
1470,1,2,Recording audio bits with saved photos is a really cool feature.,-1,1
1470,1,3,The camera looks great and it's very small, almost too small.,-1,0
1470,1,4,The buttons are tiny.,-1,0
1470,1,5,That is my only, minor issue with this, otherwise great camera.,-1,0
1471,1,0,I bought this camera last night.,-1,1
1471,1,1,I was in need of one after breaking my third Sony T-series in a row.,-1,1
1471,1,2,I just wanted something that could take pictures of decent quality and could record video.,-1,1
1471,1,3,I bought it at a military store so it came with a bundle including a memory card, reader and a soft case.PROsThere's two main things that this camera surprised me on:- The specs it has for such a small amount ($$$) is surprising.,-1,1
1471,1,4,I'm used to paying greater amounts for less with Sony.,-1,1
1471,1,5,I'm a big Sony fan.,-1,1
1471,1,6,Or was...- I'm not big on portability as a main sell point, I'll sacrifice space if it pays off with quality and with results.,-1,1
1471,1,7,However, this tiny camera fits in the palm of my hand and weighs a very small amount.,-1,1
1471,1,8,And was definitely a great addition to the already surprising specifications.CONs- Much like the other review that offered a 1 star I too had a problem with the shutter speed and flash delay.,-1,1
1471,1,9,Something that is a small inconvenience and/or can be fixed if you go through the options of the camera instead of giving up on it.,-1,1
1471,1,10,I changed the settings and it's good now.,-1,0
1471,1,11,And by doing so I now know the inner menus of the camera a whole lot better.-,-1,0
1471,1,12,The battery sliding lid seems to be a little too loose for my taste.,-1,1
1471,1,13,However, it might be my specific camera and not the model.,-1,1
1471,1,14,Just a small incovenience.OVERALLGreat camera that packs a punch for what you pay.,-1,1
1471,1,15,As long as you work on it and try to make it work it will.,-1,1
1471,1,16,Good buy!,-1,1
1472,1,0,I received this camera as a gift for my birthday in the summer.,-1,1
1472,1,1,I was excited with the color but my excitement stopped there.,-1,1
1472,1,2,The first thing I noticed is that the camera would not turn off when the lens was covered the picture display would pop up.,-1,1
1472,1,3,At first I wasn't bothered by this but my camera would make random weird noises in my purse and the battery would drain if I forgot to take it out when it was not in use.,-1,1
1472,1,4,It's difficult for an average camera user to take a picture.,-1,1
1472,1,5,It takes forever to snap a picture.,-1,1
1472,1,6,I took this camera to Lollapolooza and it took awful awful pictures by the last day of the show I stopped taking the camera with me because it was pointless.,-1,1
1472,1,7,I saw several cameras above the crowd taking pictures and no one seemed to have a problem focusing or getting the outdoor lighting right.,-1,1
1472,1,8,This camera doesn't focus properly, it is defective, and it is small but oddly bulky.,-1,1
1472,1,9,[...]I've had with a Fuji product.,-1,1
1472,1,10,I will never be dumb enough to purchase a Fuji in any capacity again.,-1,1
1473,1,0,Amazing.,-1,0
1473,1,1,I picked it out.,-1,0
1473,1,2,I loved it so much.,-1,0
1473,1,3,Upon first opening it, the color isn't exactly as it looks on the site, or the box, but its good.,-1,0
1473,1,4,Absolutely LOVE the one button video!,-1,0
1473,1,5,It takes great pictures in every setting I used it in (well except when it was almost pitch black outside, but thats every camera).,-1,0
1473,1,6,It was so amazing.,-1,0
1473,1,7,One one of the last days we were there, I noticed it wasn't in the van as we were going to Breckenridge.,-1,1
1473,1,8,I figured I didn't need it that day, and didn't think about it.,-1,1
1473,1,9,But when we got back to the condo we rented and it wasn't there, I was really sad.,-1,1
1473,1,10,I must have lost it either at the Royal Gorge or at a resturant called McClelands that we went to the day before.,-1,1
1473,1,11,All the pictures I took were not on my computer yet.,-1,1
1473,1,12,I knew from the minute I lost it I wanted another one.,-1,1
1473,1,13,I see now that it is $10 more than when I got it the first time.,-1,1
1473,1,14,I doubt my parents are buying it again, and I am seriously wanting to spend my own money on it this time.,-1,1
1473,1,15,The only thing feature wise that disappointed me was that you can't set the shutter speed manually.,-1,1
1473,1,16,This means I couldn't make those cool light pictures, but my mom's camera does that so everything is okay.,-1,1
1473,1,17,Other than that one tiny thing, I LOVE IT!,-1,1
1473,1,18,One more thing!!,-1,1
1473,1,19,I had this for almost a month of almost non-stop picture taking, and other than the orriginal charge-up, I only had to carge it like Once!,-1,1
1474,1,0,Great Camera.,-1,0
1474,1,1,I really love this camera.,-1,0
1474,1,2,It is very cute and stylish and fits my needs perfectly.,-1,0
1474,1,3,The only complaint I have is that the pictures don't always turn out how they are displayed on the screen.,-1,1
1475,1,0,Great Form Factor, poor camera.,-1,0
1475,1,1,I bought this camera for my wife for Christmas.,-1,0
1475,1,2,She wanted a really small, light pocketable camera.,-1,0
1475,1,3,Fuji designed a great small chic form factor, but apparently forgot that taking decent pictures was important to people who buy cameras.,-1,0
1475,1,4,There were two main issues with this camera--shutter lag and blur.The shutter lag was horrible, especially with the flash turned on.,-1,0
1475,1,5,I know there is a red-eye reduction feature, but no way that I could figure out to turn it off.,-1,0
1475,1,6,It was impossible to capture the image you wanted because it would take a picture a second after you push the button.Almost every picture we took indoors was blurry.,-1,1
1475,1,7,If the subject was not standing perfectly still through the horribly long lag, they would be blurry.,-1,1
1475,1,8,There was a blur warning on the screen, but the manual did not give any way to correct it.In short if you are looking for a small light camera, look somewhere else.,-1,1
1475,1,9,I took this back and got her a Canon SD 780 IS Digital Elph, and she is much happier with it.,-1,1
1475,1,10,It is just as small and can actually be used to take decent pictures in a wide variety of situations.,-1,1
1476,1,0,Good value, but won't charge or transfer files.,-1,1
1476,1,1,At just over $100, this camera is a nice value, but the USB cable (or maybe the camera itself) doesn't work for transferring pictures or charging the battery.,-1,1
1476,1,2,It was easy to work around this with the purchase of a card reader and an external battery charger, but be prepared for these extra expenses.,-1,1
1476,1,3,In general, the camera feels a little cheap, which probably isn't surprising for the money.,-1,1
1476,1,4,Despite its flaws, it's an attractive camera with great features for the money.,-1,1
1477,1,0,Perfect for my project.,-1,0
1477,1,1,I used 4 of these power supply's to power about 100 watts of led lightsThere about the size of a laptop power supplyPut 4 stars because I wish they made this item half the sizeBut that how this size of power needed can only be available in this large sizeStill works with my custom LEDs for 5 months now,-1,1
1478,1,0,Great for security cameras.,-1,0
1478,1,1,Worked as described.,-1,0
1478,1,2,I use these for powering security cameras.,-1,0
1478,1,3,Powers up to 4 CCTV cameras with IR back light.,-1,0
1479,1,0,This is cheap, with limited quality control.Ours required trimming some excess plastic in order to attach the power cord.Also, the description says "Pack of 2", however, this is not a pack of two.,-1,1
1479,1,1,There are not two of any one item, which makes it more of a kit, or a package, but not a package of two.,-1,0
1480,1,0,Good travel camera.,-1,0
1480,1,1,Excellent little camera for travelers.,-1,0
1480,1,2,Bought this for an upcoming trip, and I've been testing it for the last few days on walks around a local lake.,-1,0
1480,1,3,One day I took about 150 shots, and the battery was starting to wear down.,-1,0
1480,1,4,No way this will shoot 200 without a recharge, which takes a couple hours.,-1,0
1480,1,5,Realistically tho, how often do you shoot more than 100 shots in one day?On the other hand, this is the first camera I've owned that makes me look like I'm not a terrible photographer.,-1,1
1480,1,6,The Intelligent Auto mode is everything a point-and-shoot idiot could wish for.,-1,1
1480,1,7,It focuses quickly, sets all the settings, and all you do is shoot.,-1,1
1480,1,8,The Lumix sensor gets the colors just about right, with a little kick to make the world look just a bit more vivid.,-1,1
1480,1,9,It's also fun to fiddle with the focus point, which you can pick by touching a spot on the viewer.28,-1,1
1480,1,10,"Scene Modes" are available in groups of four, but you probably won't use more than a few.,-1,1
1480,1,11,I wish I could rearrange the order of the Scene Modes so my favorites were in front.,-1,1
1480,1,12,I also wish Panasonic's PhotoFunStudio 6.0 software didn't crash every time I try to offload photos to my PC, but I'm sure that bug will be fixed fairly soon.,-1,1
1480,1,13,Meanwhile I copy photos using Windows Explorer to see the camera's SD card as a folder.,-1,1
1480,1,14,Drag and Drop will do for now.The touch screen has decent contrast, but could be brighter in daylight (as could all LCD's).,-1,1
1480,1,15,In Playback Mode you can slide your finger left or right to go to the next or previous photo.,-1,1
1480,1,16,Some of the menu icons are really cryptic, so be sure to get the PDF of the full user's manual so you can decipher them.,-1,1
1480,1,17,It also takes awhile to get used to how the menus work in different modes.,-1,1
1480,1,18,I'm still puzzling over some of that.Best thing about this camera is the quick performance, excellent zoom and surprisingly good anti-shake.,-1,0
1480,1,19,I could stand and snap a zoomed in stop sign from half a block away with no noticeable blurring.,-1,0
1480,1,20,That's impressive in a camera this size.,-1,0
1480,1,21,The worst knock is probably the battery, which is not going to get 200 shots, but will get more than most people will shoot in a day.,-1,0
1480,1,22,An extra battery would come in handy, but at the moment (22 Mar) they aren't available.All in all it's hard to imagine a better pocket travel camera at this price point.,-1,0
1481,1,0,I bought this camera for a family member who wanted a camera that would be easy to use.,-1,0
1481,1,1,And boy is this easy to use!,-1,0
1481,1,2,This is by far the most intelligent camera I have ever used in terms of the accuracy of its Auto mode.,-1,0
1481,1,3,Just point and click, and the camera will select the appropriate settings every time.,-1,0
1481,1,4,No more blurred action shots, and no more washed out flash pictures where the entire background is just black.,-1,0
1481,1,5,This camera selects the appropriate ISO setting for each shot - in milliseconds.,-1,0
1481,1,6,Very short shutter lag, I would say unheard of for a point and shoot.,-1,0
1481,1,7,The touch screen is very intuitive and simple to use, and I like the absence of "confusing" dials of settings that most point and shoot cameras have.One feature I like is instead of having to choose the shooting mode (i.e.,-1,0
1481,1,8,Portrait/Landscape/Night Scene/etc.) the camera automatically detects which shooting mode it should use, and switches to that mode - again, in milliseconds.,-1,0
1481,1,9,This is easily the most user-friendly camera I have ever come across, and my grandmother is already delighted with it.To be clear, this camera is not for a photography enthusiast, as you really have almost zero control over the settings.,-1,0
1481,1,10,This camera is fantastic for the demographic it was designed for: those who want to be able to push a button and capture the moment every time.,-1,0
1482,1,0,Nice Pocket Size Compact.,-1,0
1482,1,1,This is a nice little camera that I bought to capture high definition photos when I'm out and about and not carrying my Nikon DSLR.,-1,0
1482,1,2,It doesn't do so well with real close up macros but it takes great photos overall and they are clear and fairly crisp.,-1,0
1482,1,3,The files size is large (over 6 MB for the high setting).,-1,1
1482,1,4,The battery life is definitely a problem and spare batteries are available but still expensive at the time of this review ($35-$50 range).,-1,1
1482,1,5,It eats up battery power even when the camera is turned off.,-1,1
1482,1,6,In bright sunlight the LCD screen is difficult to see.,-1,1
1482,1,7,Operationally the camera is easy to use and turns out good photos.,-1,0
1483,1,0,I found an OEM battery that works with Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH27.,-1,1
1483,1,1,I bought my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH27 camera in May 2011.,-1,1
1483,1,2,I love this camera given the low price point.,-1,1
1483,1,3,It does have a few things that could use some improvement.,-1,1
1483,1,4,However, the biggest beef is the battery life.,-1,1
1483,1,5,Like most of the reviewers here, I did have problem with the battery not lasting long enough for the day (ran out of juice after less than 200 shots).,-1,1
1483,1,6,Thanks to the reviews here, I brought along an old Canon camera as a backup and did have to use it on two occasions during a Baltic cruise.I am happy to report that after some research on the web, I bought an OEM battery Wasabi Power Battery BTR-BCK7-JWP that works with Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH27.,-1,1
1483,1,7,At $12 (plus shipping) from Amazon.com, it is rated at 1100 mAh and should last longer that the stock battery (rated at 680 mAh).,-1,1
1483,1,8,I did not take enough pictures (only 100+) to deplete this new battery, but the charge was still pretty full after that.,-1,1
1484,1,0,Great Camera except tiny little Problem!!,-1,1
1484,1,1,I bought this from costco.,-1,1
1484,1,2,Everything was good until I found one tiny little design flaw.,-1,1
1484,1,3,The flash is so close to the zoom lens, if you take a close up shot the shadow of the zoom lens spoils your left hand corner of your picture.It all dark at the left bottom corner.,-1,1
1484,1,4,Initially I thought it is my finger was on the flash and later discovered that the lens zoom  is getting in the way of the flash.I wouldn't recommend this camera until they fix the flash issue.,-1,1
1484,1,5,Wondering how it passed all the QC from Panasonic.,-1,1
1485,1,0,Finally a Great Low Light Camera.,-1,0
1485,1,1,I've been researching cameras for a couple of months.,-1,0
1485,1,2,I wanted easy to use, point & shoot, good low light shots(which has been difficult to find in a compact), a few manual options...not too many.,-1,0
1485,1,3,My list was finally narrowed down to three and I looked at and tried all three.,-1,0
1485,1,4,The FH-27 was my choice hands down!,-1,0
1485,1,5,I was ready to order from Amazon when by chance I found that our local Costco carried them...with the bonus of an instant rebate as well!,-1,0
1485,1,6,So I got this camera at Costco a few weeks ago and then was fortunate to be able to take it on a weekend Model T tour to confirm its capabilities.,-1,0
1485,1,7,I didn't miss one shot!!  Very reliable, easy to focus, quick recovery, very good stabilization, very good indoor color, touch screen very easy to use after just a few times.,-1,0
1485,1,8,I took 500 pictures in three days touring in all types of light and all types of conditions.,-1,0
1485,1,9,And, if you've ever been in a Model T you know it's not a smooth ride so the stabilization had to be great...it is!!  Nearly every single pic was focused and had good color (enter operator error).,-1,0
1485,1,10,I charged the battery every night and had no down time from lack of a charge.,-1,0
1485,1,11,I did have to get used to the lens being nearer the end instead of the in the middle of the camera but one of the displays has grid lines so that was solved.,-1,0
1485,1,12,I highly recommend this camera for those of us who love taking good pics but not the desire to constantly set up or change a manual setting.,-1,0
1485,1,13,I've already had two friends try the camera and go and buy one...it's that user friendly!,-1,0
1486,1,0,Exellent camera but complex controls.,-1,1
1486,1,1,I only had this camera for two weeks, but it impressed me during that time.,-1,1
1486,1,2,I ended up returning it not because of any problem with the camera, but because my needs changed.,-1,1
1486,1,3,I should mention that although there were no problems with the camera, there was a problem with Amazon's fulfillment: I ordered a black Lumix but Amazon sent me a silver one instead.,-1,1
1486,1,4,Not a big deal, but worth noting.,-1,1
1486,1,5,(It was sold by DiscountsJungle, but fulfillment was by Amazon.)I,-1,1
1486,1,6,helped a friend set up a new Lumix DMC-FH25 at about the same time I bought my Lumix DMC-FH27, so I had an opportunity to compare them.,-1,1
1486,1,7,They are basically the same camera, with two major differences: the DMC-FH27 has a 3.0" LCD and touch screen controls; the DMC-FH25 has a 2.7" LCD and has physical controls on the camera body.,-1,1
1486,1,8,One other difference I noticed is that the DMC-FH27 offers an option for shooting 5x7" pictures in average 3mb file size; the DMC-FH25 does not.I found the controls in both cameras unnecessarily complex, but this is probably for marketing purposes, so Panasonic can sell it as a versatile camera, even though most consumers will never use the vast majority of the features.,-1,1
1486,1,9,I suspect that Panasonic is no worse than other manufacturers in this regard.,-1,1
1486,1,10,All of the point-and-shoots I've used (Nikon and Lumix) take such good pictures in automatic mode that most people will have little need of the other modes the cameras offer.The touch screen controls work well and to my surprise I preferred them to the physical controls on the DMC-FH25, but for most people, the DMC-FH25 will be much easier to use.,-1,1
1486,1,11,Several disadvantages to any touch screen on a camera: you'll have to recharge your battery more often, you may have problems if you install a protective screen on the LCD, and you're going to have fingerprints on the LCD.While I had the DMC-FH27, I compared it to two of my other cameras: Nikon Coolpix L20 and Nikon D60 DSLR.,-1,1
1486,1,12,The Lumix came out well in the comparison, roughly equal to the Coolpix and in one case, as good as the D60.I didn't have the DMC-FH27 long enough to run any meaningful and accurate tests of resolution, so my comparison test is only for color and image quality.,-1,0
1486,1,13,In general, the D60 unsurprisingly got the best pictures, but in one test, the Lumix was just as good.,-1,0
1486,1,14,In my other tests, I sometimes preferred the Lumix and and sometimes the Coolpix; it was equally divided between the two.My one major complaint about the Lumix was its flash, which was more overpowering than the Coolpix flash.,-1,0
1486,1,15,On the other hand, the zoom is much better on the Lumix.,-1,1
1486,1,16,It zooms out much wider than the Coolpix L20, and it automatically shoots in macro mode; I accidentally took a picture with the camera about an inch away from a magazine page, but the text in the photograph turned out impressively sharp.If you need a date stamp on your photos, you might not like this Lumix.,-1,1
1486,1,17,The date stamp the Lumix imprints on the photos is much fainter, barely readable, than the Coolpix L20, and in a format that doesn't make a lot of sense.,-1,1
1486,1,18,For example, for a photo taken on November 3, 2011 at 3:15pm, the barely readable imprint on the photo, which I had to blow up in Photoshop to read, shows "PM 3:15 Nov/ 3/2011".,-1,1
1486,1,19,If you need a legible date/time stamp on your photos, this is not the camera for you.,-1,1
1486,1,20,The imprint is too faint to be useful.Based on my experience with several Coolpix L20s and the experience of friends with various models of Lumix, I'd expect more reliability from the Lumix.,-1,1
1486,1,21,I've written a separate review about the Coolpix L20.,-1,1
1487,1,0,Feature rich, affordable camera.,-1,0
1487,1,1,Being a long time Canon fan I was seriously looking at the latest A series models as an upgrade to my current A590IS.,-1,0
1487,1,2,The advanced features in a small affordable camera (along with Panasonics above average reliability) made it a must have.This is a really cool camera.,-1,0
1487,1,3,It takes great stills indoors and out with a very quick startup and recovery between pictures.,-1,0
1487,1,4,I was very interested in the HD video and am very satisfied with the video quality.,-1,1
1487,1,5,My 7 year old Dell P4 computer has no problem handling the HD Quicktime videos.Touchscreen, 8X optical in a small camera, 16 Mpix, Leica lens, and a host of other advanced feature make it a really great camera at a very good price.The only problem so far is the very pricey Panasonic battery that must be used in this Lumix.,-1,1
1487,1,6,A spare battery is hard to find and cost a third as much as the camera.,-1,1
1488,1,0,Finally, a point and shoot that takes good indoor pictures at night.,-1,0
1488,1,1,This is the first point and shoot digital for me that takes good indoor pictures at night most of the times.I've used many point-and-shoot in the past, but since digital camera age started, somehow I always had a problem taking decent pictures in a dark place e.g.,-1,0
1488,1,2,inside a room at night.,-1,0
1488,1,3,I used Olympus, Minolta, Cannon, Casio, and another Panasonic, and they all are good for outdoors to me, but whenever I took pictures indoors at night, like party and such, they all disappointed me.,-1,0
1488,1,4,Some over-saturated, some strange color, some just simply too dark.Now, I have a DSLR, and I learned just enough to take passable pictures under the same situation, but really, DSLR is not for casual pictures as far as I'm concerned.,-1,0
1488,1,5,Unless you always carry it around, which I don't because of the bulk, you miss too many moments.,-1,0
1488,1,6,My kids are showing a gorgeous smile?,-1,0
1488,1,7,It takes good pictures indoors at night, without me fiddling around with anything.,-1,0
1488,1,8,Just select intelligent auto mode, and that's it.,-1,0
1488,1,9,Even when it doesn't  work as good as it could, the pictures are still OK.,-1,0
1488,1,10,I still haven't figured out under which condition it performs best, but this is a significant step forward as far as I'm concerned!Video quality is also good, but you cannot change the zooming while taking video.,-1,0
1488,1,11,Also, sometimes you want to control the camera manually, and there's not too much you can do with this camera (different target audience).,-1,1
1488,1,12,These are not serious problems for me, but problems sometimes, for which I subtract one star.,-1,1
1489,1,0,Good for the casual photographer with a bent for gizmos!,-1,0
1489,1,1,I bought this for my sister, though I did use it initially to test it out and I'm just as satisfied with the picture quality.,-1,0
1489,1,2,It's nicely compact, well built and fairly good looking camera (black and silver looks conservative while the other ones look funkier!) Boot time is really really fast and so is the time it takes to capture a picture.,-1,0
1489,1,3,Rest of the controls are typical Panasonic - no gripes with them.,-1,0
1489,1,4,The flash is pretty powerful for its size.,-1,1
1489,1,5,Being a fully auto mode camera, it will want to fire up the moment light is low, though you do have the option to turn it off.,-1,1
1489,1,6,The other niceties are the touch auto-focus and a quick zoom button (E.Zoom - pressing it quickly zooms to max.,-1,1
1489,1,7,so you can focus precisely.)It's,-1,1
1489,1,8,the touch-screen display that's where this comes up a bit short.,-1,1
1489,1,9,It's not very responsive (being a capacitive touch screen, it will need you to "press" to get your action registered) though adds to the techie quotient but feels a generation older.,-1,1
1489,1,10,Besides, some of the icons on display doesn't convey the mode you are in (particularly if you are in Video mode.),-1,1
1489,1,11,The other shortcoming (know before purchase, which I assume can be fixed with a firmware update) is that you cannot zoom while shooting a video (it is locked to the state at which you started filming.),-1,1
1489,1,12,And the last issue is that while previewing the images, they wont rotate if you switch orientation of the camera, a silly thing that's not there in my other Lumix model as well.,-1,1
1490,1,0,Touch Screen is Hard to Use.,-1,0
1490,1,1,This camera takes great pictures and I was very happy with that part.,-1,0
1490,1,2,The problem is in the touch screen.,-1,0
1490,1,3,It's very hard to use, the menus are hard to navigate, and it doesn't respond to my finger so I have to have the little stylus with me all the time.,-1,0
1490,1,4,I definitely recommend the Lumix but will choose the one with the buttons instead.,-1,0
1491,1,0,THE LITTLE CAMERA THAT CAN!! Just bought this camera at Costco for $129 including all the accessories (battery, case, charger, etc) and LOVE IT.,-1,1
1491,1,1,Really smart and auto-focus is right on.,-1,1
1491,1,2,You don't have to spend time focusing it just does it automatically, and fast.,-1,1
1491,1,3,Pictures come out crisp and clean and transfer nicely to a computer.,-1,0
1491,1,4,We love that it has a feature that you can take shots in black and white.Touch Screen, brilliant - actually has words to define the features instead of graphics that you never can remember what it means.,-1,0
1491,1,5,Also gives you little helpful notes that run across the bottom part of the screen for instructions on what a feature does.,-1,0
1491,1,6,It's really uber user friendly because I'm the type that is electronically challenged and can work this like a charm.,-1,1
1491,1,7,First camera we've ever had that I can work easily.Stylus - camera comes with a little stylus that you can use instead of your finger and my husband ingeniously tied it to the end of the hand strap that is attached to the camera for easy use.,-1,1
1491,1,8,I like that the camera sounds off a little music bell when a command is completely, and when you take a shot it makes a click sound like an old fashioned camera...love it.You can also choose to shoot in black/white, color, or sepa (which is a kind of muted pastel palet) cool.Camera comes in black, silver, and red.Camera is small but big enough to hold without dropping.You can attach the camera to a tri-pod for group shots.The screen is pretty large too and is bright enough to see even in a dark living room in the daytime too.Great camera.,-1,1
1492,1,0,Touchscreen Menu Makes this Camera a Crapshoot.,-1,1
1492,1,1,I Purchased this camera based on its superior optical system and the fact I had already owned a PanasonicLumix that was stolen.,-1,1
1492,1,2,My original Lumix did not include the touchscreen.,-1,1
1492,1,3,The problem is the menu system and the touchscreen work together to make controlling the camera impossible.The layout of the menu system is incomprehensible.,-1,1
1492,1,4,The touchscreen adds to the fun by being very touchy and so eager to lead you to an item it goes off at the slightest touch.,-1,0
1492,1,5,Couple that with dozens of made up graphic symbols that are neither standard nor in any way related to what is done.,-1,1
1492,1,6,In short if you have any need to adjust this camera I guarantee you will fail.,-1,1
1492,1,7,You will be constantly bewildered by what is considered important and by the grouping of unrelated functions in a menu system that might as well be written in the language of Pictographs.,-1,1
1492,1,8,Do not buy this system.,-1,1
1492,1,9,It is horrible and its inability to be set up in any meaningful way with less than a half hour of screwing around makes it nothing but a small box of frustration.,-1,1
1493,1,0,Great camera for the price.,-1,0
1493,1,1,Love the camera.,-1,0
1493,1,2,My only negative is there is no zoom function when shooting a video like my older model Panasonic.,-1,1
1494,1,0,Great Camera.,-1,0
1494,1,1,This is a really good camera.,-1,0
1494,1,2,Actually, better than we thought it would be.,-1,0
1494,1,3,I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a very affordable camera that's loaded with options and yet easy to use.,-1,0
1495,1,0,Excellent P&S; After our pseudo-SLR died, I decided I wanted a very smart P&S; that I could carry in my purse.,-1,0
1495,1,1,After two weeks of daily use, I am very fond of this camera.,-1,0
1495,1,2,It took a little while and some quality time with the PDF version of the manual to even begin to figure out what it was doing... the contextual settings can be pretty confusing.,-1,0
1495,1,3,Now that I've got it set up the way I want, I'm quite happy.,-1,0
1495,1,4,One of the best things I did was create 2 shortcuts that appear on the "home" screen, rather than having to dig through the menus to get to settings I knew I would use all the time (in my case, that's macro mode and flash settings).,-1,0
1495,1,5,It's given me great shots in a variety of lighting situations, action shots, etc.The one weakness I've found comes in the autofocus when zoomed in on a moving subject.,-1,0
1495,1,6,A very specific scenario, I know, but I just recently missed a really cute shot because of it.,-1,0
1495,1,7,I think that in the future I'll rely on the fact that the sensor is so big and just "zoom" by cropping.,-1,0
1496,1,0,touch screen takes some getting use to.,-1,1
1496,1,1,I really dont find the touch screen easy to use at all.,-1,1
1496,1,2,more time consuming.,-1,1
1497,1,0,Great images here.,-1,0
1497,1,1,I love, it fun to use great pixel give a very shape image.,-1,0
1497,1,2,The 3" screen give it a better way of view the pictures.,-1,1
1498,1,0,Defective shutter scratches camera lens!,-1,1
1498,1,1,I've had the Lumix for a while and have been pleased with it until I recently noticed several fine vertical scratches on the lens (some are more like a dashed line ----).,-1,1
1498,1,2,Each photograph, especially those where I've aimed into any kind of light source, have hazy white lines in the center of the photo.,-1,1
1498,1,3,I couldn't figure out how I could have scratched the lens since the cover retracts automatically when it's not on.,-1,1
1498,1,4,I am very careful with my camera and keep it in a lens case when being carried around.,-1,1
1498,1,5,A little research turned this up: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lens-scratches/forum/Fx39Y385WF8RDUQ/Tx1ZBKB3Z7Z73R8/1?_encoding=UTF8&asin;=B001T0H0RG.,-1,1
1498,1,6,Apparently lots of other people have had this this issue.,-1,1
1498,1,7,The scratches are due to a defect in the camera shutter which scratches the lens each time it closes.,-1,1
1498,1,8,When I listen closely I can hear it making contact with the glass.,-1,1
1498,1,9,I called Panasonic and spoke to Otis, a supervisor in their Camera Repair dept.,-1,1
1498,1,10,and, as expected, he told me that I'd have to return it for repair at a cost of $128.,-1,1
1498,1,11,He said "defect or not, it's out of warranty".,-1,1
1498,1,12,I will not be returning it for repair at that cost, of course.,-1,1
1498,1,13,Nor will I ever buy another Panasonic product.,-1,1
1499,1,0,pictures are washed out looking.,-1,1
1499,1,1,We may have just gotten a lemon, but ours worked in every way except that, flash or daylight, the pictures look washed out on the Automatic setting, and there's no way to default to "smaller F-stop" (to use the old photography lingo).It might do better with manual setting, but the whole idea for us was that it be easy to use, and having to manually adjust it all the time makes it pretty much useless on that score.Our iPhones take much better pictures, more easily, lacking only the zoom feature.:-(,-1,1
1500,1,0,I love the touchscreen!,-1,0
1500,1,1,Easy and fast!,-1,0
1500,1,2,Many reviewers on amazon.com,-1,0
1500,1,3,and other sites seem to not like the touchscreen.,-1,0
1500,1,4,I LOVE the touchscreen interface.,-1,0
1500,1,5,It is easy and very fast!,-1,0
1500,1,6,I never want to use a pocket camera with buttons and switches again!This camera has many settings—almost too many.,-1,0
1500,1,7,However, the basic settings are easy to access.,-1,0
1500,1,8,A nice feature is the ability to drag two of your favorite settings (shortcuts) to the main screen so they are literally at your fingertip.,-1,0
1500,1,9,I only wish there was room for 3 or four favorites to the top level.You can turn the camera on and take a picture in 2 seconds.,-1,1
1500,1,10,If you've owned another camera and missed more than a few shots because you were waiting for the camera to boot up, you'll appreciate how fast this camera starts up.,-1,1
1500,1,11,When it comes to turning off the camera, you can set it to go to sleep in 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, or never.,-1,1
1500,1,12,Again, if you've owned another camera and missed great shots because the camera went to sleep just as the action started happening, you'll appreciate the option to never turn the camera off.,-1,1
1500,1,13,Sometimes getting the picture is more important than conserving a battery, espcially if you have spares.One reviewer pointed out a design flaw: the lens causes a shadow in the lower left corner when you use the flash in zoom.,-1,1
1500,1,14,That doesn't bother me because I have a DSLR that I use for closeup flash situations, which is hardly ever.,-1,1
1500,1,15,However, if this is your only camera and you think you'll need to take closeups with a flash, you may want to look for a different camera.Some reviewers noted that flash images can be washed out.,-1,1
1500,1,16,I reduce the exposure by 1/3 or 2/3 EV.,-1,1
1500,1,17,Instead of digging into the menus to find the EV setting, I placed it as one of the shortcuts on my main screen.There are lots of neat features about this camera.,-1,0
1500,1,18,It has all the basics and more.,-1,0
1500,1,19,I carry it with me wherever I go.,-1,0
1500,1,20,I still use my DSLR when I want high quality uncompressed RAW images.,-1,0
1500,1,21,For everyday use, I love this camera!,-1,0
1501,1,0,This camera is easy to operate and takes good quality pictures, both close-up and far away.,-1,0
1501,1,1,The charger that came with it did not work, so the seller promptly sent me a new charger at no charge.,-1,1
1502,1,0,Take a Shot.,-1,0
1502,1,1,This is an amazing camera.,-1,0
1502,1,2,My pictures are excellent with brilliant colors.,-1,0
1502,1,3,Can actually point the camera into the sun and get beautiful sunsets.,-1,0
1502,1,4,The telephoto lens in this camera is fantastic and able to capture distant wildlife and landscape scenes.,-1,0
1502,1,5,It also has a decent wide angle lens and can do some panorama pictures.,-1,0
1502,1,6,Could be a bit user friendly, but if used frequently, not an issue.,-1,0
1502,1,7,Read the manual and there should be no issues.,-1,0
1502,1,8,Have recommended to several friends and they too are very happy with the performance.,-1,0
1502,1,9,A bit more expensive than other comparable models, but I found it well worth the extra cost.,-1,0
1503,1,0,Well designed Point-and-Shoot pocket camera: Lumix FH25.,-1,0
1503,1,1,Replaces old Fuji Finepix which took excellent pictures.,-1,0
1503,1,2,Experience so far suggests Panasonic Lumix was an excellent choice (reviewed many other brands but none matched the reviews for Panasonic Lumix models -- both the FH25 and SZ1 are great products)Pro's:Easy to operate; did not need to use instructionsControls are very intuitive and "finger-friendly", no fumbling for buttons, etc; great layout enables you to get on with taking pictures rather than figuring out where controls areAbility to turn flash on/off with a press of a button is much appreciated, nice touchLove the large LCD screen (a bonus after the old small LCD of my Fujipix); do not miss the viewfinderMultiple functions that you actually use (eg, "sunset" setting really works!) because they are accessible and well described on the camera LCD screenSuper clear, sharp, true color outdoor photos; indoor photos best with flash depending on light (probably could be better using available settings -- yet to test)Stunning hi quality videoLong battery life, fast charge (bought generic for spare)Camera size -- not too small, not too bigSimple connectivity for foto transfer -- just connected to computer, followed instructions on LCD and voila!,-1,0
1503,1,3,Did not need supplied softwareCons:None worth mentioning -- 16 megapixels is overkill, thoughSummary: A great little camera that does more than the price suggests.,-1,0
1503,1,4,This model offers more than the SZ1, although both are now priced the same.,-1,0
1503,1,5,I like convenience of the separate battery charger that enables use of the camera while charging spare battery on the FH25 (SZ1 needs to be connected to charge -- worth buying the charger, it's the same unit as for the FH27).Just as important, I've had a lot of fun using this camera!,-1,0
1504,1,0,Hello!!! Has received camera Lumix DMC-FH27 delivery to Russia 17.01.2012.,-1,0
1504,1,1,With quality it is happy!,-1,0
1504,1,2,The camera good, in êîìëåêòå a charger, the accumulator, a cord for connection to the computer, a cord for TV, a disk with on, a bag, card 2ÃÁ.,-1,0
1504,1,3,BUT in the Description it has been told 4ÃÁ!!!.,-1,0
1504,1,4,In general with purchase Vladimir is happy yours faithfully,-1,0
1505,1,0,Lumix digital camera.,-1,0
1505,1,1,We took our new camera on  a trip to Maui and it worked very well.,-1,0
1505,1,2,The only exception was on a sunset cruise, when the battery ran out and I missed many good photo opportunities.,-1,0
1505,1,3,I'm still adjusting to the camera, but so far I'm liking it.,-1,0
1506,1,0,Great camera, but battery is expensive and doesn't last.,-1,0
1506,1,1,Love this little HD wonder, but the battery expires before the memory is half full.,-1,0
1506,1,2,And spares are $50!,-1,0
1507,1,0,Nice piece of garbage.,-1,0
1507,1,1,We bought it for our office, we take pictures of clothing very often, and  operating this is a nightmare.,-1,0
1507,1,2,Trying to set the exposure to capture black stitching on black fabric was a headache, the touchscreen is ridiculous, I have to press on the same icon numerous times to get it to react.,-1,1
1507,1,3,I really don't get how this camera is "easy to use", but it is easy to trash.,-1,1
1508,1,0,Not a very good investment.,-1,1
1508,1,1,After reading so many reviews stating that this is an easy camera to operate I purchased it to replace and update the camera that I've been using for the last 3 years.,-1,1
1508,1,2,Well, it is not that easy.,-1,1
1508,1,3,I have been using digital cameras for about 15 years and this is by far the biggest dissapointment ever!,-1,1
1508,1,4,Touch screen is very tempermental and the pictures are not clear and sharp as discribed.,-1,1
1508,1,5,The software package is very limited.,-1,1
1508,1,6,I would not recommend this camera to anyone.,-1,1
1508,1,7,Espically someone who is not familier with digital cameras.I just got back from vacation and am glad that I took equal amounts of photos with my smart phone as those pictures turned out much better (clearer and sharper).,-1,1
1508,1,8,Lumix DMC-FH27 16.1 Megapixel Compact Camera - 5 mm-40 mm - Black,-1,1
1509,1,0,Like it so far.... Just bought it at Costco a few days ago.,-1,0
1509,1,1,So far I like the pics and how easy it is to use.,-1,0
1509,1,2,I had to buy another camera because my year and a half old $650.00,-1,0
1509,1,3,Canon Rebel is in the shop.,-1,0
1509,1,4,Took it to Mexico and it just stopped working.,-1,0
1509,1,5,No photo memoires on that trip.,-1,0
1509,1,6,I figure this camera will be a great back up .,-1,0
1510,1,0,The Good, The Bad, and the Incomprehensible.,-1,1
1510,1,1,The Panasonic Lumix DMC -FH27 may be a good camera.,-1,1
1510,1,2,It may be a great camera for the money.,-1,1
1510,1,3,I will never know because the instruction manual was written by an engineer who flunked high school English.,-1,0
1510,1,4,To be more precise, the English is grammatically correct but the text of the manual remains incomprehensible to all but those already adept with digital cameras or already capable of interpreting writing of engineersUnless you have considerable experience with digital cameras and are an engineer or have an engineer in the house or have located a six week intensive course in breaking the arcane code used by engineers for whom English is a foreign language, I would advise you to pass on this camera.,-1,0
1511,1,0,Good purchase.,-1,1
1511,1,1,I had the same model of camera for over a year and when I dropped it (damaging the lens enclosure), I went on-line to find an identical model for replacement.,-1,1
1511,1,2,The camera is easy to use, has a good quality lens and good resolution.,-1,0
1511,1,3,Battery life is good and I like the convenience of the SD memory.,-1,0
1511,1,4,I recommend this camera to amateur or serious professional photographers.Size of the camera is nice (small) and it is easy to use.,-1,0
1512,1,0,Best Lumix Camera Overall ever made.,-1,0
1512,1,1,In short, this is the best camera overall.,-1,0
1512,1,2,Perfect size, rubber housing, best control layout...  Sure newer ones have more features, MP, Wi-Fi, etc. but for layout and ease of use, this is the best ever.,-1,0
1512,1,3,Panasonic please take a look at your design again and inculcate the ideas of the FX 07 back into your thinking and quickly.,-1,0
1512,1,4,I am about to buy an LX7 but will still find myself carrying the FX 7 or FX75 with me every day.,-1,0
1513,1,0,Not a quality product.,-1,1
1513,1,1,I purchased this device for a customer who needed an inexpensive CCTV setup for a bar.,-1,1
1513,1,2,Nothing fancy, didn't expect high video quality or anything of the sort.,-1,1
1513,1,3,Well, when the item arrived, and i found out my customer did not have a working cdrom on her computer, we tried looking for the software to run this thing online.,-1,1
1513,1,4,Upon close inspection of the packaging, i could find no useful information on who exactly manufactures this product or a part number, so i could not pursue that any further.We eventually got the software onto the customer's computer by other means, and set up the camera system.,-1,1
1513,1,5,Each of the cameras was approximately 20 feet from the receiver.,-1,1
1513,1,6,The packaging boasts a range of 100 meters, and that was a patent lie.,-1,1
1513,1,7,At 20 FEET, the pictures were not of a quality that could be useful for anything.,-1,1
1513,1,8,As a matter of fact, the cameras performed better on the 9 volt batteries than with the ac-adapter.,-1,1
1513,1,9,This indicates to me that there is poor quality electronics in the ac adapter not properly conditioning the signal for use as a dc power source, and the ac noise was interfering with the RF transmission of the cameras.,-1,1
1513,1,10,The product is not usable for any purpose i can think of with such limited range.I know this is not a review of the seller, but I would like to point out, however, that the sellers customer service was impeccable and the RMA process went through very smoothly.,-1,1
1513,1,11,If you are willing to take a chance on such a low quality product, you can at least rely on the seller to refund your money in a timely manner when you change your mind.,-1,1
1514,1,0,It was a great deal..,-1,0
1514,1,1,I searched everywhere for good deals and found that Sunset Electronics is the only one who is selling for lesser price.,-1,0
1514,1,2,(Other camera deals are also cheaper than what out there in market from diff vendors)With apprx.,-1,0
1514,1,3,$950..I got really good deal and I am happy with the product.,-1,0
1514,1,4,(except Tripod and flash light).Tripod  : Not so good.,-1,0
1514,1,5,I am afraid most of the time if it will hold my camera, tight.Ext Flash light : Not compatible with camera, so of no use now.Still, happy with deal and camera!! Thanks for quick delivery and response.,-1,0
1515,1,0,I was planning to buy canon t3i the body and 55-250 for almost $900.00,-1,0
1515,1,1,but when I saw the package for $957.00,-1,0
1515,1,2,I was planning to buy canon t3i the body and 55-250 for almost $900.00,-1,0
1515,1,3,but when I saw the package for $957.00,-1,0
1515,1,4,I went for it and to my surprise it was wonderful deal when I received the package the battery was missing and I was not happy about the flash light & the bag I call the company and explain my situation with out any question asked they send me better flash light and bigger bag with in two days.,-1,1
1515,1,5,Thank you for wonderful service and product.,-1,1
1516,1,0,The camera is amazing and is covered for a year by canon.,-1,0
1516,1,1,I am a photographer currently in school and have been using this camera for two years now.,-1,0
1516,1,2,The reason I gave the kit 4 stars instead of 5 is because the tripod batteries and sd card leave room for improvement.,-1,1
1516,1,3,The tripod is rather flimsy, the batteries only last about a third as long as the canon brand battery, and the sd cards are slow and not for someone who has a shutter finger.,-1,1
1516,1,4,That being said, for the price this kit is amazing and perfect for starting out!,-1,0
1516,1,5,The one below is inexpensive and still works after 3 years.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTSHY8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7,-1,0
1517,1,0,Awesome Camera.,-1,0
1517,1,1,This camera bundle was a great deal for the price.,-1,0
1517,1,2,The package contains everything you need to get started whether you are a newbie or a seasoned photographer.,-1,0
1517,1,3,The camera is very user friendly and full of features.,-1,0
1517,1,4,I would recommend this camera to anyone that wants to get the most for their money.,-1,0
1518,1,0,Awesome Camera.,-1,0
1518,1,1,Very pleased with my purchase.,-1,0
1518,1,2,It arrived promply after ordering.,-1,0
1518,1,3,Everything was packaged well.,-1,0
1518,1,4,I have had a few months to practice taking pictures with the camera and absolutely love the quality of the prints.,-1,0
1518,1,5,The package was a very good deal,-1,0
1519,1,0,Great deal.,-1,0
1519,1,1,Its a great purchase, everything is working fine, with a great quality.,-1,0
1519,1,2,Highly recomendable.,-1,0
1519,1,3,The pictures of this camera are amazing,-1,0
1520,1,0,I had this camera to review for Olympus.,-1,1
1520,1,1,Here are my quick thoughts.,-1,1
1520,1,2,I asked Olympus if I could review this camera.,-1,1
1520,1,3,I had written reviews for them before.,-1,1
1520,1,4,To preface the review I will mention that I own several of the Olympus EP2 cameras and the EPL1 camera.,-1,1
1520,1,5,While the EPL series cameras don't come with the accessory finder, VF-2, I consider it the reason to buy this camera and this family of cameras.,-1,1
1520,1,6,More on that in a second.,-1,0
1520,1,7,I gave this camera five stars but you should be clear that all ratings are contextual.,-1,0
1520,1,8,It's not a better camera than a Nikon D3 or a Canon 1dsmk3 but it is a wonderful and very capable camera for $600 (with a lens).,-1,0
1520,1,9,I consider it an $800 camera because I want to be able to use the 1.4 megapixel finder.Reasons not to buy one: 1.,-1,0
1520,1,10,You shoot sports and need super fast autofocus and a very fast frame rate.,-1,1
1520,1,11,2.,-1,0
1520,1,12,You rarely see daylight and want a camera that shoots noise free from 3200 ISO up.,-1,0
1520,1,13,Nope, this one is not your camera.Reasons to buy one:  1.,-1,0
1520,1,14,The files right out of the camera (as jpegs) are very nice.,-1,0
1520,1,15,Rich and accurate color and nice balance of sharpness and contrast.,-1,0
1520,1,16,2.  It's a very stealthy package that flies under the radar, masquerading as a point and shoot but fully capable of great results.,-1,0
1520,1,17,No one will guess that you're a serious photographer.,-1,0
1520,1,18,3.,-1,0
1520,1,19,With adapters there is a very wide range of lenses from other manufacturers that work well with the camera.,-1,0
1520,1,20,If you want to try a Nikon or Leica lens for some street shooting this would be the camera to try it with.The big question I got over and over again in response to my review on my blog was whether this camera has better image quality that the EPL1.,-1,0
1520,1,21,I find them identical.,-1,0
1520,1,22,But the newer screen and newer controls are better.The HD video is limited to 7 minutes per take but the quality (720) is very good and the camera has full manual controls for every facet.,-1,0
1520,1,23,You'll need to buy an Olympus adapter if you want to use external microphones.Why do I like these cameras?,-1,0
1520,1,24,Because they are quick to operate and very, very lightweight.,-1,0
1520,1,25,I like to spend hours and hours walking thru city streets shooting and the cameras are light enough to make this an enjoyable thing.,-1,0
1520,1,26,I just don't like composing a scene at arm's length.,-1,0
1520,1,27,Olympus makes a great electronic viewfinder that works with all the Pen cameras and also the new xz-1 compact camera.,-1,0
1520,1,28,It's a 1.4 megapixel finder.,-1,0
1520,1,29,It's very detailed and makes the camera a wonderful tool.,-1,0
1520,1,30,I wouldn't consider buying any of the Pens unless I budgeted for the finder as well.Bottom line?,-1,1
1520,1,31,Great camera for the money.,-1,1
1520,1,32,Just make sure you are buying it for the right reasons.,-1,1
1521,1,0,A seriously good camera for its niche.,-1,1
1521,1,1,I am quite surprised at how good the images are that I'm getting, especially jpegs.,-1,1
1521,1,2,I'm used to shooting raw because I get better files and can squeeze a bit more juicy goodness out of my photos that in-camera jpeg processing does.,-1,1
1521,1,3,Surprisingly, this camera does a great job with jpegs in good light situations.,-1,1
1521,1,4,That's the important idea to keep in mind, good light.,-1,1
1521,1,5,Kirk Tuck gives this camera a fine review, but realize that he's a lighting pro, who has written several (good) books on the subject.IMO this camera is targeted toward two markets.,-1,1
1521,1,6,For those moving up from a point and shoot, it's wonderful.,-1,1
1521,1,7,It's familiar and less intimidating than an SLR.,-1,1
1521,1,8,It can create better images than even the best point and shoots.,-1,1
1521,1,9,The price is reasonable.,-1,1
1521,1,10,It's attractive and it's a lot lighter than an SLR.,-1,1
1521,1,11,Those people wouldn't consider shooting in bad light without a flash.,-1,1
1521,1,12,They wouldn't consider deliberate long exposures to smooth motion effects.,-1,1
1521,1,13,Those last two areas are not the camera's strengths as Brad R. points out.,-1,1
1521,1,14,From the things he's asking the camera to do and not getting satisfaction he is a more knowledgeable photographer and demands more than the main target market for this camera.,-1,1
1521,1,15,If you want low light capability or low ISO speed then this isn't the best camera around, though it isn't that bad, either.The other market is more experienced photographers looking for a light and compact second or third camera.,-1,0
1521,1,16,They have cameras for low light or fast action shooting.,-1,0
1521,1,17,But there are reasons for not carrying around a big, heavy, professional looking camera but still wanting quality image files.,-1,1
1521,1,18,That's my reason.,-1,1
1521,1,19,My aging back hurts lugging around a fully sealed and rugged SLR.,-1,1
1521,1,20,I've also found that I've been questioned about photos when in many tourist places: No pros allowed.,-1,1
1521,1,21,Pros need to pay a fee.,-1,1
1521,1,22,I don't want a reporter taking my picture.,-1,1
1521,1,23,Guess what?,-1,1
1521,1,24,The EP-2 doesn't get that kind of response.,-1,1
1521,1,25,It looks like a tourist camera and tourists aren't as intimidating as professional looking photographers, pro or not.,-1,1
1521,1,26,Stick a big camera with vertical grip in a room and people tense up.,-1,1
1521,1,27,Hold your camera a foot in front of your face and few people care.,-1,1
1521,1,28,I love that about this camera.,-1,0
1521,1,29,I guess you can tell that I like street photography with it.How much do I like it?,-1,0
1521,1,30,A lot. It's tolerably light, fits in a smallish fanny pack.,-1,0
1521,1,31,handles great, takes great photos in good light, has well though out controls, and works fine with flash systems.,-1,0
1521,1,32,Will I be shooting at night with this for available light?,-1,0
1521,1,33,Is it a great camera for portability?,-1,0
1521,1,34,Absolutely.,-1,0
1521,1,35,It's light.,-1,0
1521,1,36,Its lenses are lighter than any larger sensor camera's.,-1,0
1521,1,37,I can take excellent quality images when I work with rather than against the camera.,-1,0
1521,1,38,All in all I very pleased.The other nice thing about this camera is that it will take accessories and a remote shutter release.,-1,0
1521,1,39,You can, and probably should add the attachable viewfinder.,-1,0
1521,1,40,It will also take external microphones, which helps with much higher audio when recording video.,-1,1
1521,1,41,That sounds strange, but it's true.,-1,1
1521,1,42,As a video camera, it's pretty equivalent to current entry level SLRs.,-1,1
1522,1,0,Ideal size, easy to grip, great image quality.,-1,0
1522,1,1,I've used the Oly Pen e-PL2 for over a month now (update: over 6 months) and I like it very much.,-1,0
1522,1,2,I'm going to try to highlight some of its best features and also recommend some very useful accessories.,-1,0
1522,1,3,And I'd also like to show you how to navigate quickly while avoiding unnecessary problems.,-1,0
1522,1,4,My review will be long and detailed but will ultimately save you time.,-1,0
1522,1,5,I'm a pro fine-art photographer (Dick Sanders) and I shoot medium format film cameras for "the look," but I have numerous other photo needs, and I found myself using my Nikon F100 film camera for everyday apps, which was inconvenient.,-1,0
1522,1,6,I didn't want to buy a bulky DSLR for non-pro work, but I also didn't want (even the best) point-and-shoot camera with its tiny sensor.,-1,0
1522,1,7,The Oly Pen e-PL2 gives you a quality four-thirds sensor in the ideal body size.,-1,0
1522,1,8,And because it has both a front grip and a rear thumb rest, it's easy to hold and shoot, even with one hand.,-1,0
1522,1,9,Granted, the Oly is not pocketable (except for a large jacket pocket), but that's not important to me, especially after getting the perfect case, the Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 (more on this great case just ahead).A great feature right off the bat is that the Oly e-PL2 comes with a 100 page printed English manual (see page references for various features ahead).,-1,0
1522,1,10,It also has a CD ROM with a detailed manual, but I haven't found a need for it.,-1,1
1522,1,11,The camera has vast capabilities and can seem daunting at first with so many menus and choices, so expect to spend several hours with the manual and camera exploring, but this is fun and you can customize the settings for your preferences.,-1,1
1522,1,12,Before buying this camera, I had read a couple of reviews in which the users said the camera had confusing menus and difficult navigation, but this is not true.,-1,1
1522,1,13,Spend a little time with it, and you'll see that it's actually quite logical, and while there are many choices, once you learn what you want to do, you can do those things pretty quickly.,-1,1
1522,1,14,There is a small dial that you can spin to navigate and make changes, and some people complained about it being too sensitive (it is), but you don't even have to use it, as there are arrow buttons as well.,-1,1
1522,1,15,I find the arrow buttons plenty fast and rarely use the dial, but it is handy for "more quickly" scrolling through pics during review.In any case, right out of the box, I found I could use the iAuto and get beautiful photos effortlessly (see my sample pictures here of a white rose and my white cat).,-1,1
1522,1,16,The large-fine jpg files (be sure to set it for that, pg 42) open at 10.08 by 13.44 inches at 300 dpi, and the quality and colors, even with the kit lens, are very good.,-1,1
1522,1,17,With today's high quality enlarging plug-ins for PhotoShop (I use OnOne Software) you can easily enlarge the 10.08 x 13.44 to 30 x 40 inches and get very good results, but mostly I wanted this camera for 5x7s, 8x10s and the occasional 11x14 (and of course for various online pics).,-1,1
1522,1,18,I prefer the 4/3 format over the others, because it easily makes 5x7s, 8x10s and 11x14s with minimal cropping.,-1,1
1522,1,19,But you can also change to other formats, including 3:2, 16:9 and 6:6, although it'll crop the full 4032 x 3024 sensor accordingly.,-1,1
1522,1,20,By the way, I think it's important to note you're getting 12 megapixels on a fairly large four-thirds sensor, which is the reason for the good image quality.,-1,1
1522,1,21,Typical P&S; cameras cram 12, 14, and even 16 megapixels onto tiny sensors and that's a recipe for poor quality.Right off, I took a picture handheld in my living room on iAuto, at ISO 1600 and a 1/15 second shutter speed, and with the image stabilization, the picture was sharp, with natural colors (just slightly warm), and no visible noise in an 8x10 print.,-1,1
1522,1,22,It was quite good right out of the camera, and I made minimal PhotoShop adjustments to make it perfect.,-1,1
1522,1,23,Anyone can use this camera on iAuto and the results out of the camera will be very good and ready to use.,-1,1
1522,1,24,Some noise was visible in the shadow areas of my living-room photo if blown up larger, but a quality noise reduction program would take that out.,-1,1
1522,1,25,So, there is probably no "general need" for the external FL-36 flash, which I bought with a bounce-diffuser then returned (the camera does have a pop-up and tiltable built-in flash and more on that just ahead).,-1,1
1522,1,26,In low available light I can shoot at 1600 and print up to 8x10, and probably larger with a noise reduction tool such as Nik Dfine or the one in Lightroom.If you're a novice or moving up from a P&S;, this is a great camera because you can start on iAuto and always revert to it in an emergency.,-1,1
1522,1,27,If you press some buttons that take you somewhere you don't want to be, all you have to do is press the menu button twice and you'll be instantly returned to the basic iAuto shooting mode -- a lifesaver when you need to act fast to get the shot (my wife likes this feature).,-1,1
1522,1,28,Another great feature is the "Live Guide" which is quickly accessed in iAuto by pressing the central OK button (pg 18) and from there you can make the scene lighter or darker, warmer or cooler in color, more or less saturated in color, and also change the depth of field (blur the background).,-1,1
1522,1,29,You'll see your adjustments live on screen.,-1,1
1522,1,30,Making the color temp a little cooler indoors without flash is usually necessary, but Oly makes it easy.,-1,1
1522,1,31,And because you see exactly what you're getting as you make the changes, the Live Guide is of immense value.,-1,1
1522,1,32,Also, if you get deep into the menus and feel lost, Oly prompts you how to "go back" and also labels or explains everything on screen (very helpful in the beginning).,-1,1
1522,1,33,And then as you learn more, you can begin to use more functions and choose your settings.,-1,1
1522,1,34,But I should warn you that this is not a camera to hand off to somebody at a restaurant for a group photo.,-1,1
1522,1,35,There are several small buttons on the back that do different things.,-1,1
1522,1,36,Your thumb definitely needs to go on the thumb rest.,-1,1
1522,1,37,When I handed the camera to a person who volunteered to take our picture, he accidentally pressed a couple of buttons and somehow got night mode with a long exposure and flash and the pics were worthless, but this was my mistake.Another feature that's easy to access is exposure compensation, which I've used all my photo life, and I like that I can access and change it quickly in Program, Aperture or Shutter Priority (pg 36).,-1,1
1522,1,38,The same is true with adjusting white balance (38) or changing ISO (43).,-1,1
1522,1,39,There is also a manual mode, but I haven't found a need for that yet.,-1,1
1522,1,40,There's a movie mode, too, and the movie button is positioned just to the right of the thumb rest, so you can hit it easily to start filming.,-1,1
1522,1,41,Since I have a good quality Canon Camcorder I customized my Oly to disable the movie button, and the advantage here is that you can assign this button another function (pg 84) and still make movies by turning the mode dial to "movie.",-1,1
1522,1,42,I'm not a fan of digital gimmicks, and I see many photos today that are over HDR'ed or otherwise hyped and made ridiculous, but I confess I found the art filters, including pinhole, grainy black and white, and especially the dramatic tone to be fun, and you can even combine these effects in multiple exposures (pg 51).,-1,1
1522,1,43,The dramatic tone gives you a pseudo HDR look and it's a bit over the top, but I found I could dial the effect back in Photoshop and make a dramatic and interesting photo that looked only slightly unrealistic, and for some pictures -- for example, flowers against a sky with clouds -- the results were improved without looking terribly unnatural.,-1,1
1522,1,44,The effects you get with sky and clouds are especially good here.,-1,1
1522,1,45,I also got some funny pics of my cat with the pinhole filter, so there are definite uses.,-1,1
1522,1,46,The grainy black and white is a little too contrasty for my liking, but I can remember when such a look was popular in the 1960s (think high-key fashion or gritty rock documentary).,-1,1
1522,1,47,There is also diorama, for a miniaturization effect, plus pop art for dramatically hyped colors, and soft focus for portraits or dreamy effects.,-1,1
1522,1,48,In addition, there are about 20 different "scene modes," including panorama (pg 50) for stitching several photos together.,-1,1
1522,1,49,Basically, this camera is good for novice to pro.,-1,1
1522,1,50,It'll do a lot for you, or you can do a lot with it, or you can limit what you do.,-1,1
1522,1,51,Let's face it, you'll mostly use 5, 6 or 7 favorite things, which you'll learn to access and use fairly quickly.,-1,1
1522,1,52,The other 101 things the camera will do can be ignored or serve as fodder for experimentation.,-1,1
1522,1,53,And you can also use the MYSET feature, which will give you your favorite settings as the default (see page 31).Unfortunately, the camera does not focus well in very low light and there is no focus assist lamp (Olympus, please add this for the e-PL3 -- Jan 2012 update -- Olympus has disappointed with the e-PL3; while they did add a focus-assist lamp, they made the camera smaller and ditched the grip, making it much harder to hold.,-1,1
1522,1,54,They did add a tilt LCD, which is good for low angle shots, but not fully articulating so you can't do self-portraits, and then they raised the price.,-1,1
1522,1,55,They did improve the back control layout some, but if you're buying the e-PL3 you will need to buy an accessory grip that you can attach to it, otherwise you'll never be able to hold it with one hand: Google Richard Franiec grip for Olympus Pen e-PL3).,-1,1
1522,1,56,I don't think the hotshoe FL-36 flash unit provides the focus-assist beam feature, either.,-1,1
1522,1,57,But you can customize the fn button to toggle between manual and autofocus (pg 33) so in low light you can hit the fn button, zoom in, focus manually, then zoom back out to get the shot.,-1,1
1522,1,58,There's also a way to hit a couple of buttons for a quick zoom-in for close focusing, but I found it faster to manually zoom in and focus.,-1,1
1522,1,59,Of course, in the old days we all did this just fine.,-1,1
1522,1,60,Sadly, autofocus has made us lazy and I can say it's let me down on many occasions.,-1,1
1522,1,61,But if you're dealing with a really dark scene, you can also set the screen brighter (pg 75), and then zoom in and manually focus, so there are good workarounds here.,-1,1
1522,1,62,On tiny P&S; cameras, you have little buttons or levers that make zooming slow or awkward, but here you just grab the lens, twist, and you're there.,-1,1
1522,1,63,Zooming and manual focusing is fast and easy.,-1,1
1522,1,64,Of course, you can choose the focus mode and target (pgs 32-33), and you can customize buttons for focus and exposure lock (pg 83).,-1,1
1522,1,65,I like to use a central target which locks when the shutter button is depressed halfway, then I recompose and shoot.,-1,1
1522,1,66,But for portraits, you can set the camera on face detection with "closest eye detection," and it'll track focus on a moving face, which is good for pics of your kids (it even worked on my cat) or just when you want the focus on your subject's eyes.,-1,1
1522,1,67,I will definitely use this feature, especially with the Panasonic/Leica 45mm lens (90 macro) which I intend to buy next along with the Panasonic 20mm f1.7.,-1,0
1522,1,68,But I've been using the 14-42 kit lens with good results, and I like that it focuses to 9 inches, which at the full zoom 42 (84) gives you big closeups.Two must-have accessories in my opinion are a 37mm to 46mm step-up ring and the B&W; brand 46mm collapsible rubber lens hood.,-1,0
1522,1,69,This combo will attach to the 37mm threaded kit lens, and with the rubber lens hood in the collapsed position it'll work very well for 14 to 17.5mm (28-35) and in the full extended position from 17.5 to 42 (35-84).,-1,0
1522,1,70,The B&W; 46mm two-position rubber lens hood is much more practical than a fixed hard lenshood and is really helpful outdoors.,-1,0
1522,1,71,Also, this 46mm lenshood will fit and work well on the Panasonic/Leica 45mm f2.8 macro lens (90mm), as well as the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 pancake lens (40mm).,-1,0
1522,1,72,Now, if you add a 46mm filter to the step-up ring-lenshood combo, you'll get a little corner vignetting at 14-17.5mm, but none thereafter.,-1,0
1522,1,73,But the step-up ring and lenshood offer protection for the lens, so you can go without a filter, unless you specifically need one for special effects (ND filter, for instance).,-1,0
1522,1,74,I do use a 37mm UV filter on the camera when indoors for general lens protection.,-1,0
1522,1,75,And I have a 46 UV filter I use outdoors sometimes, but I must remove either it or the lenshood for 14 to 17.5 wide angle, unless using the 16:9 format, in which case the corner vignetting isn't an issue.,-1,0
1522,1,76,Note: I want to use the 46mm filter and lenshood with the Panasonic/Leica 45 and 20 lenses (both threaded for 46mm), otherwise I could get a 37 to 52 step-up ring, 52mm filter, and B&W; 52 rubber lenshood and there would be no vignetting whatsoever.,-1,0
1522,1,77,This is an option if you know you're only going to use the 14-42 kit lens, and in such case you can even get a very thin 52mm filter.,-1,0
1522,1,78,Another advantage of the B&W; lenshood is that if you're wearing the camera around your neck, and you stoop down and the camera swings out in front of you and bangs something (while hiking, for instance) the rubber lenshood offers good protection, which is why I prefer collapsible rubber lenshoods for all my lenses including those for my big film cameras.The Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 camera bag is a perfect small bag for this camera.,-1,0
1522,1,79,It'll hold the e-PL2 in the main section with some extra room, and it'll hold the 37 to 46 step-up ring, 46mm filter, and 46mm B&W; lenshood (combined and ready to use) in the front pouch.,-1,0
1522,1,80,The front pouch also has two small compartments that can hold two extra BLS-5 batteries (a good idea since the battery life is a little short) and/or more SDHC cards.,-1,0
1522,1,81,You can also fit an SDHC card on either side of the bag behind the shoulder-strap rings (nice design touch).,-1,0
1522,1,82,You'll find that for a long day of heavy shooting, or a 3-day travel weekend, carrying 2 extra batteries is a good idea.,-1,0
1522,1,83,And you can now get an off-brand BLS-5 battery at Amazon for a very reasonable price.,-1,0
1522,1,84,By the way, since I'm not shooting HD movies, I bought the Delkin 4 gb Pro Class 10 SDHC card for this camera and it works great and holds over 500 pics, unless you're shooting raw.,-1,0
1522,1,85,Raw and movie shooters should get the 8gb class 10 SDHC card.,-1,0
1522,1,86,And if you're going to get serious with raw, you should know the raw converter Oly provides isn't very good.,-1,0
1522,1,87,Lightroom is much better, and the 3.4 upgrade will convert the raw Olympus .orf,-1,0
1522,1,88,files, and it also has the noise-reduction feature.,-1,0
1522,1,89,But back to the case -- in the main section of the Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 case, you can put the Panasonic/Leica 45mm macro lens at the bottom and the Oly e-PL2 on top, and the lid will still close.,-1,1
1522,1,90,You can also put the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 pancake lens in the front pouch, if you don't use it for the lenshood, in which case that will easily fit with the camera in the main section and can be left on the camera.,-1,1
1522,1,91,It just depends what you're buying and how you want to use the case.,-1,1
1522,1,92,But this is a high quality, small, lightweight bag with both a top handle and adjustable shoulder strap, which can be made long enough to swing the bag comfortably behind your back.,-1,1
1522,1,93,It has a secure quick release latch on the front which is also adjustable to make both the lid taller and the front pouch bigger.,-1,1
1522,1,94,This is ideal if you're carrying the camera with two extra lenses, 2 batteries, and the "step-up ring, filter, lenshood combo.",-1,1
1522,1,95,And if you're carrying less you can tighten the strap and shrink the bag.,-1,1
1522,1,96,You can also remove the shoulder strap and attach this case to your belt.,-1,1
1522,1,97,It'll be a little bulky that way, but the back of the bag features a quick-release velcro patch with safety snap that is so secure you can comfortably rest your arm on the bag.,-1,1
1522,1,98,And to top all, the bag is even bargain-priced for its high quality.,-1,1
1522,1,99,Whatever you do, don't buy the Olympus Pen casual case because it was made for the eP1, eP2, and e-PL1, all of which are slightly smaller than the e-PL2 (although I understand it will work for the e-PL2 with the Panasonic 20mm or Oly 17mm attached).The 3 inch LCD screen is of good quality (460k dot) and after a month's use I don't have a single scratch on it.,-1,1
1522,1,100,It's also adjustable in brightness, and you'll find it easy to zoom in and move around to check focus.,-1,1
1522,1,101,But you'll be surprised at how much better your pictures look when you open them in PhotoShop.,-1,1
1522,1,102,I can't stress this too much -- the quality and colors right out of the camera are very good.,-1,1
1522,1,103,So, if you're a beginner who doesn't have good PhotoShop skills, you need not worry.,-1,1
1522,1,104,You can shoot on iAuto, make quick adjustments with the Live Guide (pgs 18-19), and you'll get great pics right out of the camera, ready for Flickr or Facebook or instant printing.,-1,1
1522,1,105,The same goes for the art filters and scene modes, all easy to use.,-1,1
1522,1,106,And as you learn more about photography, you can start to set your aperture, shutter speed, ISO, exposure and flash compensation, color temperature, shadow-highlight balance (pg 36), etc.,-1,1
1522,1,107,In my own case, after a lifetime of photography, it gives me all of the options I want and many more.,-1,1
1522,1,108,If it has any weaknesses, it would be sports action and low light work where you need quick and accurate focus.,-1,1
1522,1,109,In both cases you'll need a DSLR.The built-in flash is surprisingly powerful, but I try to avoid it, since you just get that "blasted flash look.",-1,1
1522,1,110,But because it's fairly strong, adjustable in intensity (pg 55), and can be tilted up, I'm going to see if I can rig up a mini bounce-diffuser for it.,-1,1
1522,1,111,Also, because of the tilt-up feature, you can bounce it off a "low white ceiling" and get improved results.,-1,1
1522,1,112,Don't try it on a very high or dark ceiling.,-1,1
1522,1,113,UPDATE: I did succeed in fashioning a mini bounce diffuser out of white construction paper, modeled on the Lumiquest Promax Pocket Bouncer, and it worked quite well to soften the flash but only at fairly close distances.,-1,1
1522,1,114,Of course this is when the straight flash is the worst, so this is an option when you need more light and don't want it to look harsh.,-1,1
1522,1,115,For sure, there's an advantage to using the pop-up flash outdoors in the shade, in a backlit situation, or at dusk as fill flash, especially since it's adjustable and you can dial it down for a more natural look.,-1,1
1522,1,116,But if you do, you'll have to remove your B&W; lenshood, as it will block some of the flash.,-1,1
1522,1,117,By the way, you can customize your Oly to synchronize the exposure compensation with the flash intensity, so these will work in tandem if you prefer this arrangement (pg 55).Regarding HDR, which is both very popular and overused today, there is a practical use for it that even Ansel Adams (the inventor of extended dynamic range with his Zone System) would likely approve, and that's to shoot in Raw, take 3 images -- one exposed normally, one underexposed, and one overexposed (a tripod will be needed here) -- and then combine all three in camera as a single image.,-1,1
1522,1,118,In post processing, you can then create a realistic photo with an extended range that shows more detail in the highlights and shadows.,-1,1
1522,1,119,In the instruction manual, look up RAW plus Overlay (pg 51 and also 63).I like the four-thirds format because the quality is very good and it's an open format, so you can use both the Panasonic/Leica lenses and the Oly lenses, and myriad other lenses with adapters, and very likely more lenses will be coming.,-1,0
1522,1,120,I'm excited about trying the Panasonic Leica 45 and 20 micro four-thirds lenses (90mm and 40mm respectively) because these lenses have pro quality.,-1,0
1522,1,121,And specifically the 20mm f1.7 is ideal for low light work.,-1,0
1522,1,122,If you plan on doing a lot of indoor shooting and don't want to use the flash, this lens can be very helpful.,-1,0
1522,1,123,I have a friend, also a pro street photographer, who uses the Olympus 11-22 f2.8-3.5 ED four thirds lens on this camera with an adapter, and he routinely produces excellent results.,-1,0
1522,1,124,In fact, I've noticed a few have said that this is a great street camera, since it's neither obvious nor intimidating.,-1,0
1522,1,125,UPDATE: Panasonic has just come out with a new Leica 25mm f1.4 aspherical lens that could prove to be the best lens yet for this camera.,-1,0
1522,1,126,This "normal perspective" prime lens (50mm equivalent on full frame) will also be excellent for low-light work, and is just long enough to also work for portraits.,-1,0
1522,1,127,Conveniently, it also has a 46mm filter/hood thread.I should mention this camera feels solid.,-1,0
1522,1,128,It's got a little weight, which I prefer, and you get the sense of a fine piece of equipment, and yet it's smaller, lighter and more comfortable to carry and use than a DSLR.,-1,0
1522,1,129,One important thing, because of the front grip and rear thumb rest, you can shoot this camera with one hand, which will allow you to do something else with the other hand.,-1,0
1522,1,130,Believe me, this is absolutely necessary sometimes.,-1,1
1522,1,131,For example, you can use your hand to shade the LCD screen so you can see what's on it outdoors in bright light (unless you're buying the hotshoe viewfinder).,-1,1
1522,1,132,Or you can shade the lens, when you need to remove the lenshood.,-1,1
1522,1,133,I once used my left hand with spread fingers to create dappled sun/shade falling on a white rose (see it in sample photos here).,-1,1
1522,1,134,And sometimes I use my left hand to hold a 22 inch Photoflex translucent litedisc above a small subject to diffuse the sunlight (creates soft light), which is a miniature version of what pros do on location.,-1,1
1522,1,135,On Amazon, look up Photoflex Translucent Lightdisc, and you'll see 12, 22, 32, 42, and even 52 inch circular sizes.,-1,1
1522,1,136,The 22 and 32 sizes are practical for holding with one arm.,-1,1
1522,1,137,These discs also come as dual-sided reflectors for reflecting white, silver, or gold light, so pay attention to what you're ordering.A few people complained about the quality of the kit lens, as if they expected pro quality.,-1,1
1522,1,138,I find the kit lens to be quite good, but I don't expect pro results from it; that's why I'm adding the Panasonic/Leica 45mm f2.8 and 20mm f1.7 lenses.,-1,1
1522,1,139,One person said the pictures were washed out.,-1,1
1522,1,140,In some cases, I've had to slightly reduce the color saturation, but you can also set the camera for vivid, natural, muted, monotone, etc (see pgs 40 and 41).,-1,1
1522,1,141,Or in iAuto, press OK for Live Guide and adjust "color saturation.",-1,1
1522,1,142,Remember, the color tone, saturation, and white balance are all adjustable.,-1,1
1522,1,143,You can even choose the exact color temperature (pg 38).,-1,1
1522,1,144,One person said the pictures came out with a yellowish cast in iAuto indoors with no flash.,-1,1
1522,1,145,Sure, that's common because of tungsten or mixed lighting or even the color of the walls.,-1,1
1522,1,146,But the fix is easy: In the iAuto mode, press the OK button to get Live Guide, then choose "color image" and make the color cooler (pages 18-19).,-1,1
1522,1,147,Or under Program, Aperture or Shutter Priority, press OK for Live Control, then toggle up to WB and select "incandescent," which will balance the color temperature to your indoor lights (pg 38).,-1,1
1522,1,148,Even if you have your Oly set for "auto white balance," there's a white-balance compensation feature for fine-tuning the color (pg 39).,-1,1
1522,1,149,And you'll see all of the adjustments I've described above "live" on screen.,-1,1
1522,1,150,Another person said the camera was signaling it was in focus when it wasn't, but I wonder if he failed to choose a "default focus target.",-1,1
1522,1,151,If you don't select a target (pgs 33 and 77), the camera will choose one of 11 targets for you, which obviously will often be wrong.,-1,1
1522,1,152,And here's something that will save you time: in iAuto, the camera wants to choose a focus target for you (a face if you have it set on face detection) but if you want to choose your own target, simply press the [...] button (note: that's not deleted copy, the symbol is three dots) and select from a grid of 11 targets and press OK.,-1,1
1522,1,153,But if you switch from iAuto to use Program, Aperture or Shutter Priority, and then back to iAuto, the camera will revert back to choosing its own target, and you'll have to press the [...] button and select your target again (a 3 second manuever).,-1,1
1522,1,154,Remember this and you'll avoid aggravation and lost shots.,-1,1
1522,1,155,In any case, why send the camera back because you're unwilling to read the manual and learn how to press two buttons?,-1,1
1522,1,156,I just don't find these complaints realistic, unless the complainers got a bad copy (it does happen), in which case they should return their cameras for a refund and buy new ones.A cool feature for black-and-white shooters is that once you choose "monotone" under Picture Mode (pgs 40-41) you can go on to choose a filter, including neutral, yellow, orange, red, and green.,-1,1
1522,1,157,The yellow filter will add a little contrast.,-1,1
1522,1,158,The orange and red filters will add more contrast, making a blue sky darker and highlighting white clouds.,-1,1
1522,1,159,The green filter will lighten green foliage and darken red objects and can accentuate facial features in portraits.,-1,1
1522,1,160,I like the orange filter for black and white landscapes that include sky and clouds, and sometimes red for maximum drama.,-1,1
1522,1,161,You can also choose sepia, or add a slight bluish, purplish, or greenish cast.,-1,1
1522,1,162,All useful effects.All in all this is a great camera, especially for its size, features, and fine quality at this price.,-1,1
1522,1,163,I'd say you can't go wrong, unless you want fewer features, a smaller sized body, and are willing to sacrifice some image quality (the small Sony NEX excluded since it has an APS sensor).,-1,1
1522,1,164,But I found the camera perfect for the myriad everyday apps I need, and it will also make an ideal travel camera.,-1,1
1522,1,165,Sorry my review is so long, but I find that when I'm looking for new gear, the detailed reviews are more helpful.,-1,1
1522,1,166,I hope I've answered some of your questions and also suggested some useful accessories.,-1,1
1522,1,167,Good shooting!,-1,1
1523,1,0,Fantastic travel and walk around camera!,-1,0
1523,1,1,This camera is the perfect travel companion and great for street photography.,-1,0
1523,1,2,It doesn't draw too much attention due to its size, styling and small lenses.,-1,1
1523,1,3,The in-body image stabilization is fantastic as is the built in flash.,-1,1
1523,1,4,The flash is designed in a way that allows it to be bounced off the ceiling, allowing for a more natural look.,-1,1
1523,1,5,The wireless flash support was a key seller for me...I don't have an olympus flash unit but plan on picking up the FL-36R for travel.,-1,1
1523,1,6,I have this camera with the kit 14-42 and a panasonic 20mm f/1.7.,-1,0
1523,1,7,The 14-42 is silent and is sharp, but the lens construction is on the cheap side and it is slow (in f-stop, not autofocus).,-1,0
1523,1,8,Autofocus is fantastic with both lenses and comparable to a GF1 in focusing speed.,-1,0
1523,1,9,I love the image quality and the high iso performance is pretty good; images are usable at ISO 1600.,-1,0
1523,1,10,The noise that is present has a film-like quality....Overall, this is a fantastic kit at a great price....its not going to replace my 7D for shooting motorsports or wildlife but it definitely does well in all other scenarios.,-1,0
1524,1,0,E-PL2 Is On Par With A DSLR Plus A Ton of Funs To Use.,-1,0
1524,1,1,I bought an Olympus PEN E-PL2 w/ kit lens and with a Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 lens separately last week and since then cannot let go of it.,-1,0
1524,1,2,I take it everywhere I go, and I shoot everything, anything that moves and doesn't move, day and night, outdoor and indoor.,-1,0
1524,1,3,The photos blow my mind away.,-1,0
1524,1,4,Upon seeing photos, people are keen to ask what camera I use.*,-1,0
1524,1,5,Portability *This camera is incredibly small, about half the size of an entry-level DSLR.,-1,0
1524,1,6,It's about the size of a bridge camera except E-PL2 is thinner.,-1,0
1524,1,7,It could not be slipped into a pocket, but it's so portable that I have no trouble taking it everywhere I go.*,-1,0
1524,1,8,Low Profile *E-PL2 having such a classic low-profile design is a perfect quality camera for candid photography of kids and people who get intimidated by pro-looking DSLR.,-1,0
1524,1,9,I don't know but people tend to get too serious when faced with professional camera gears.,-1,1
1524,1,10,The purpose of candid photography isn't really to spy on them but to capture them in their most natural poses with genuine smiles.,-1,1
1524,1,11,The retro-looking compact design seems to avert their attention away.,-1,1
1524,1,12,People don't seem to mind having photos taken as much.,-1,1
1524,1,13,When I'm out on the streets, this camera doesn't scream for attention.,-1,1
1524,1,14,People won't stare at you.,-1,1
1524,1,15,They won't come asking.*,-1,1
1524,1,16,Image Quality *I find noises very acceptable up to ISO 1600.,-1,1
1524,1,17,At ISO 3200, the noises get very noticeable although quite acceptable for general use in a family album, blog or Facebook.,-1,1
1524,1,18,At its highest ISO, 6400, the image quality gets degraded so much you would have to be desperate to use it.E-PL2 reigns supreme in blurring out the background, isolating the subjects.,-1,1
1524,1,19,Ideal photos that look awesome define where the eyes should look at, by giving tack sharp focus on where it matters the most.,-1,0
1524,1,20,This would be incredibly difficult to achieve with a typical compact, as everything is always in focus.,-1,0
1524,1,21,Not that you can't shoot great photos with a P&S; compact, but E-PL2 opens up a new dimension to photographers, a dimension that allows the viewers to visualize depth in 2D photos.*,-1,0
1524,1,22,Night and Indoor Photography *E-PL2 performs wonderfully in low light.,-1,1
1524,1,23,I find I'm able to shoot away at ISO 1600 at night and at ISO 800 indoor with a few bright lights.,-1,1
1524,1,24,The photos are very acceptable.The noise sensitivity is almost on par with an entry-level DSLR (such as Canon Rebel T3i or Nikon D5000).,-1,1
1524,1,25,E-PL2 has a 4/3 sensor with an area of 200mm² when cropped to 3:2 aspect ratio.,-1,1
1524,1,26,That is about 55% of 370mm² area of an APS-C sensor inside a modern crop DSLR, and in comparison, E-PL2 sensor gets only about half the amount of light at the same shutter speeds.,-1,1
1524,1,27,To make up for the loss of light, Olympus makes a design change.,-1,1
1524,1,28,Firstly, the pixel density of E-PL2 in 3:2 aspect ratio is reduced to 10MP from 15-18MP of a typical DSLR.,-1,1
1524,1,29,Lowering the pixel density gives space to making larger photodiodes on the sensor which allows more light collection per pixel.,-1,1
1524,1,30,The reduction of the megapixels keep signal amplification power only marginally higher, and that will lead to only a slight increase of grainy noises in the photos.E-PL2 sensor may be smaller than that of a DSLR's APS-C sensor, but it is still five to nine times the size of  sensors found in typical compacts.,-1,1
1524,1,31,As the larger E-PL2 sensor gathers much more light, E-PL2 will have considerably less noises.,-1,1
1524,1,32,It matters a lot whenever it goes dark.*,-1,1
1524,1,33,Built-in Flash *The built-in flash is conceptually new in a way that you pop it up and can hold it upright to bounce the flash off the ceiling, and it works pretty good too, granted that the ceiling is not too high.,-1,1
1524,1,34,You should however expect to get an external flashgun for the job if you're serious in getting plenty of light on the subjects.For night portraits, I usually underexpose the flash by two stops (by setting the FEC to -2).,-1,1
1524,1,35,By underexposing the flash, the camera will use the available ambient light as the primary/key light, and a bit of flash will fill in the shadows and lighten up the faces, giving a more natural look.*,-1,1
1524,1,36,Sensor-shift Image Stabilization *For handheld shots, E-PL2 sensor could shift to stabalize the shots by about two stops, even if the lens doesn't have IS.A few things you should note though.,-1,1
1524,1,37,The sensor-shift IS works only for still photos and only during the exposure.,-1,1
1524,1,38,It isn't activated when you press the shutter button half-way and when in movie mode (which is the standard behavior of lens-based IS).It is pretty loud but also such a beauty to observe a shifting sensor while shooting lensless.*,-1,1
1524,1,39,Focus *It's a mirrorless that relies on contrast detection to focus on subjects, unlike DSLRs which have dedicated AF phase-detection sensors to do the job.,-1,1
1524,1,40,While contrast-detection AF is generally slower and less acurate than the phase-detection AF, I find that E-PL2 focuses blazingly fast and accurate.,-1,1
1524,1,41,In low light, the AF hits and misses (which is also an issue for phase-detection AF).*,-1,1
1524,1,42,Conclusion *If you own a DSLR, you will find E-PL2 a great complement for fun and professional uses.,-1,0
1524,1,43,It takes awesome photos in shallow depth of field and in low light.,-1,0
1524,1,44,The real loss over a DSLR is the loss of pixel density but E-PL2's 10MP is good enough for large prints.UPDATE: 05/29/2011* Cons *After using for another month, some limitations are getting more apparent.,-1,0
1524,1,45,Firstly, a video clip is limited to 2GB in size.,-1,1
1524,1,46,Since E-PL2 records videos in the outdated Motion-JPEG format that consumes much higher bandwidth than the newer AVCHD/MP4, a clip can last only for 7 mins 30 secs.,-1,1
1524,1,47,It however doesn't stop you from recording more clips till the card is filled up.,-1,1
1524,1,48,Secondly, while ISO can be changed in the video mode, only ISO 400 to 1600 are selectable.,-1,1
1524,1,49,I have no idea why the ISO 200 is not.*,-1,1
1524,1,50,Issue *The issues apply particularly to this unit I bought.,-1,1
1524,1,51,It might say something about the build quality.Apparently, after two months of use, the built-in flash went dead.,-1,1
1524,1,52,It's probably a mintor electrical contact problem since it pops up and down like that.,-1,1
1524,1,53,External flashgun still works with it though.,-1,1
1525,1,0,Great, except for the red dots...,-1,0
1525,1,1,The E-PL2 was my first micro-four thirds camera and my first Olympus.,-1,0
1525,1,2,I've had a succession of Nikon DSLR's over the years, along with a rotation of higher-end compacts from most of the camera manufacturers.,-1,0
1525,1,3,But I wanted something smaller and more portable but with better-than-P&S-IQ;, and the E-PL2 looked very promising.,-1,0
1525,1,4,It is a great camera, and after a couple of hours of shooting I was even thinking that it might replace my D90 for all but the most demanding situations I encounter (very low light, very fast action, etc).,-1,0
1525,1,5,The E-PL2 is a fun camera to shoot with, and IQ up to ISO800 was nearly indistinguishable from the D90.,-1,0
1525,1,6,The Art filters offer a lot of creative potential.,-1,0
1525,1,7,Great!I was *thrilled* with E-PL2 until I shot a sunset and got home to review the results.,-1,0
1525,1,8,When I got home & viewed the photos on my Mac, I noticed a distracting grid of red dots around the sun in several of the shots.,-1,0
1525,1,9,It doesn't look like any kind of lens flare that I've ever seen in my 10 years of shooting digital.,-1,0
1525,1,10,It looks like some sort of internal reflection on the imager.,-1,0
1525,1,11,Thirty minutes of searching & reading, and apparently this is something of a known 'feature' of the E-PL2.,-1,1
1525,1,12,There's a lot of heated debate about it online; whether it's the camera, the photographer, incorrect composition, poor choices of aperture, lenses, etc.  I'd strongly encourage anyone considering this camera to read up on it.It isn't a problem for everyone, nor may it affect every E-PL2, but mine (with the latest v1.01 firmware) with the kit 14-42 II & 40-150 f4-5.6 lenses definitely had it.,-1,1
1525,1,13,It was visibly distracting on not out-of-the-ordinary photographs of a typical sunset.,-1,1
1525,1,14,IMHO, not acceptable from a camera of this price & caliber.,-1,1
1525,1,15,I got up early the next day and shot some photos of the sunrise to see if it would happen again and to do some tinkering.,-1,1
1525,1,16,Sure enough, the red dots were there, and much worse this time.,-1,1
1525,1,17,It was a clear & bright sunrise, so that may have something to do with it.,-1,1
1525,1,18,I shot in iAuto, "Sunset" mode, P, A, and full manual.,-1,1
1525,1,19,Wide-open apertures do seem to lessen the problem, but it's still distracting to me.,-1,1
1525,1,20,Anything above about f8 and it's a real mess (which is what the "Sunset" mode wants to use...).So, with some sadness, I returned it.,-1,1
1525,1,21,Great camera, I just need one that can reliably capture a sunset.,-1,1
1525,1,22,I will keep my options open, and I'll eagerly await the "E-PL3" that will hopefully have this problem resolved.,-1,1
1526,1,0,The "Small" System I've Been Looking For.,-1,1
1526,1,1,Got into photography almost 3 years ago.,-1,1
1526,1,2,Took lots of pictures with various point & shoot cameras for many years before that but not really paid a whole lot of attention until said date when I purchased a DSLR and went on an oversea vacation.,-1,1
1526,1,3,That's when it changed from taking snap shots to a hobby.In the last couple years my young son started showing keen interest in photography particularly in close-ups of bugs and flowers.,-1,1
1526,1,4,I've been wanting to get another camera that's capable of macro and portraiture to complement what I have, something not as heavy or "obvious".,-1,0
1526,1,5,This Pen EPL2 fits the bill and is much smaller and lighter.,-1,0
1526,1,6,Photo quality wise, IMO it matches the DSLR in some regards and lags a little in others, partly a function of the accompanied lenses and how much I'm willing to spend to close the gap.,-1,0
1526,1,7,I love the skin tone it produces which is gorgeous and flattering.,-1,0
1526,1,8,Photo opportunity wise, the little guy sometimes surpasses due to its readiness and stealthy nature.Here are the lenses I use to maximize the varied styles of photography we enjoy:  a. Oly Kit 14-42 lens with Oly wide converter for general photography plus the occasional wide angle shots (to 11mm).,-1,0
1526,1,9,Oly 40-150 lens with Oly macro converter for telephoto and up to almost 1:1 macro on the long end.,-1,0
1526,1,10,This is sought after as I get to zoom during close-up framing.,-1,1
1526,1,11,Panny 20mm f1.7 for street photography and low light situations.,-1,1
1526,1,12,The 35mm equivalent focal length due to the 2x crop factor is 40mm, making it an ideal all around fast pancake.,-1,1
1526,1,13,Combined with the in-body image stabilization this is quite the app.,-1,1
1526,1,14,Oly 45mm f1.8 for portraiture and short telephoto.,-1,0
1526,1,15,This combination produces very sharp, luminous and detailed photos plus the great ability for shallow depth of field to give you the separation of in-and-out of focus subjects.,-1,0
1526,1,16,If you are curious, yes the bokeh is lovely.I'm delighted by the large selection of M43 lenses and accessories available.,-1,0
1526,1,17,Frankly with just one lens, you can do alot and some may argue that's all you need.,-1,0
1526,1,18,But I'm extremely happy with how far this system can take me today.,-1,0
1526,1,19,The camera itself looks retro, comes from the stellar Pen lineage, and is equipped with many manual adjustment buttons and dials which I like.,-1,1
1526,1,20,One of my favorite features is with the ease in which one can adjust exposure compensation + or - and see in real time what the photo will look like on the LCD before clicking the shutter.,-1,1
1526,1,21,Focus comes in Single or Continous, auto and auto/manual, as well as face recognition, plus get this: tracking.,-1,1
1526,1,22,Easy to capture the shot and stay in focus.,-1,1
1526,1,23,The focus speed and accuracy are more than good enough for me.Another benefit is that all this equipment fits into a small/medium sized bag and combined weigh very little.,-1,1
1526,1,24,I can carry it for days and not get sore at all.,-1,1
1526,1,25,One negative is that at this point, Olympus only offers one external flash, and it's not very good.,-1,1
1526,1,26,But I guess newer and better ones will be coming.Finally, the HD video feature.,-1,1
1526,1,27,When the optional viewfinder is mounted, I can shoot video in a dark theatre without bothering patrons nearby as the bright LCD is recessed.,-1,1
1526,1,28,Both the HD video as well as the mono audio are quality stuff, especially in a pinch.,-1,1
1526,1,29,The 720P shown on my 25 inch monitor is very sharp.,-1,1
1526,1,30,I used the EPL2 and the Panasonic 20mm lens combination the other day for my daughter's ballet performance, and it turned out better than what I could ask for.,-1,1
1526,1,31,Until I get a dedicated camcorder with a large sensor, in most situations the EPL2 will do fine.,-1,1
1526,1,32,Did I mention it's discreet?,-1,1
1526,1,33,Highly recommend.--------------------Over,-1,1
1526,1,34,Christmas I brought only this camera for a Disney trip, and it was perfect.,-1,0
1526,1,35,I still think that each the M43 and the DSLR formats has its pros and cons.,-1,0
1526,1,36,When it's time for a smaller outfit, this is really fantastic.,-1,0
1526,1,37,If I'm doing a photo shoot where I need the ultimate in photo quality and accessories, I'd stay with the DSLR.Finally added up the weight: the EPL2 body plus the 20mm f/1.7 lens combined weighs roughly 360g to 380g.,-1,0
1526,1,38,That is less than the weight of the Nikon 60mm prime lens alone at 435g, or close to the Tokina 35mm lens alone at 350g.,-1,0
1526,1,39,That's really amazing if weight is a factor.Found here at Amazon on 2/28/12 a wonderful third party flash unit: Nissin Speedlite Di 466 FT Four Thirds Digital Flash for Olympus and Panasonic Cameras.,-1,0
1526,1,40,Yippee!!------------It is July 2012 and I've sold the EPL2 and replaced it with the EP3.,-1,0
1526,1,41,EP3 has a metal body and wow that feels completely different, very solid hunk of a tool.,-1,0
1526,1,42,Images are about the same, maybe just a tad better.,-1,0
1526,1,43,The overall speed is faster and the touch focus and shutter screen works nicely.,-1,0
1526,1,44,I love the PEN series.,-1,0
1526,1,45,I've sold a number of lenses in my pursuit to become more creative with photography and now have just 3 prime lenses:  Panasonic 14mm and 20mm, plus Olympus Four Third 50mm f2 Macro.,-1,0
1526,1,46,I have placed an order for the wide angle lens converter (part # DMW-GWC1) for the 14mm which will bring the FOV to 11mm for more dramatic view.,-1,0
1526,1,47,We'll see how it works out.,-1,0
1527,1,0,Great mirrorless camera.,-1,1
1527,1,1,There are two reasons you are looking at this camera:1) You have been using point and shoot compact cameras and want a camera that delivers better images2) You have been using higher end cameras but are looking at a micro four thirds camera to complement your existing kitIf reason (1) applies to you, then I'll be brief: the E-PL2 is going to provide you with the expected boost in image quality compared to any compact camera.,-1,1
1527,1,2,It will provide quality similar to a DSLR in a slightly more compact package.,-1,1
1527,1,3,Compared to a DSLR, what the E-PL2 is offering is a slightly easier learning curve and simpler controls.,-1,1
1527,1,4,So get it, use it, and read the manual when you have time so that you can learn more of the things you can do with this camera.,-1,1
1527,1,5,Also, keep in mind that this is not a DSLR, it is a representative of a new market segment that sits between point and shoot compact cameras and DSLRs - it is called mirrorless, because it differentiates itself from DSLRs by lacking a mirror and the optical viewfinder supported by it.If you are here for reason (2), then I'll be brief again: the E-PL2 is a very well built camera.,-1,1
1527,1,6,Its main size advantage results from the elimination of the mirror - in other words, the most important reduction in size is in the thinness of the body.,-1,1
1527,1,7,Width and height are not much smaller than a DSLR, but depth is about half that much.,-1,1
1527,1,8,What this amounts to is that mirrorless cameras are generally not pocketable.,-1,1
1527,1,9,If you want a pocketable camera, you should look at a compact model such as Canon PowerShot S95 10 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD or its successor, Canon PowerShot S100 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black).,-1,0
1527,1,10,Or the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3 12.1 MP Rugged/Waterproof Digital Camera with 4.6x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Orange) if you want a waterproof camera.,-1,0
1527,1,11,Or maybe the Pentax Q 12.4 MP CMOS Sensor Kit with 8.5mm 1.9 AL [IF] Prime Lens and 3x Optical Zoom (White), if you want a camera system with multiple lens choices.,-1,0
1527,1,12,I picked the E-PL2 because I like having in body image stabilization and also because the E-PL2 has the highest ISO performance of all Micro Four Thirds cameras, as tested by dxomark (even better than the newer E-P3 model).,-1,0
1527,1,13,I also liked the Olympus styling to Panasonic's one - the kit lens, for example, is much smaller.Now for some general comments:I found the menus and controls of the E-PL2 to be easy to figure out.,-1,1
1527,1,14,A few things were uncovered after reading the manual.,-1,1
1527,1,15,For example, there is an important camera customization menu that is hidden out of the box, to keep the options less confusing.,-1,1
1527,1,16,It can be unlocked in the initial menus, but you need to know about it, to do it in the first place.,-1,1
1527,1,17,It allows enabling a manual focus assist mode that is extremely useful, as well as performing the pixel "mapping function" to avoid stuck pixels (don't use it without knowing what you are doing).,-1,1
1527,1,18,There are a bunch of other settings too.Autofocus was fast and accurate.,-1,1
1527,1,19,You can guide it to focus on a certain area in the frame.,-1,1
1527,1,20,Manual focus is also surprisingly good, mainly because of the good quality of the LCD screen - even though it's just 460K pixels.,-1,0
1527,1,21,I liked the small details around the design of the body (the small grip on the front, for example) as well as the design of the kit lens.The kit lens is quite good.,-1,0
1527,1,22,It is supposed to be least sharp at long end, but I used it wide open at 42mm and I was very happy with the results.,-1,0
1527,1,23,It is light and small.,-1,1
1527,1,24,This is the second version, having a better build and, I assume, optical capabilities as well.,-1,1
1527,1,25,The only disappointing thing is that a lens hood was not included.The body of the camera is very well built and all buttons work great.,-1,1
1527,1,26,The only exception might be the rotating wheel around the D-pad - it is very easy to turn around inadvertently.,-1,1
1527,1,27,On the other hand, the features attached to it are great - you can use it to cycle through images while zoomed into an area, which is very helpful when comparing the focusing accuracy of a burst of shots.The camera software (Olympus Viewer 2) works without glitches and it permits the upgrade of firmware in both body and lens.It might be interesting to note that a number of users are already complaining about newer PEN bodies as being less featured than the E-PL2.In conclusion,the E-PL2 is a greatly crafted photographic tool.,-1,0
1527,1,28,It is not extremely compact, but you wouldn't want it to be so either.,-1,0
1527,1,29,IQ is on par with APS DSLRs, so the E-PL2 can indeed replace a DSLR.,-1,0
1528,1,0,Beautiful images even at high ISO.,-1,1
1528,1,1,I am very impressed with this camera.,-1,1
1528,1,2,It exhibits no visible noise at ISO800 and still pleasantly looking photos at ISO1600 where it retains the color and contrast quite nicely even compared to entry-level DSLRs.,-1,1
1528,1,3,IBIS is very effective, using shutter speed 1/5 is a breeze - no more blurry pictures in low light.,-1,1
1528,1,4,Together with Panasonic 20mm f1.7 lens E-PL2 can sustain even the most demanding low light conditions with no flash.,-1,1
1528,1,5,Use AWB most of the time except for artificial light conditions - switch to "incadecent" and you're good (in rare cases "fluorescent").,-1,1
1528,1,6,No more yellow cast images.,-1,1
1528,1,7,Metering is very accruate; you wouldn't need to make any exposure changes in most cases.,-1,1
1528,1,8,The color rendition of this camera is similar to that of Canon's but does even better job with skin tones rendering.,-1,1
1528,1,9,Great portrait camera.,-1,0
1528,1,10,I've been using it for a few weeks now (bought it from B&H; Photo though) and, honestly, it doesn't even have a lot of cons to brag about.,-1,0
1528,1,11,I don't shoot videos so I don't even know if it's good at all.,-1,0
1528,1,12,The camera is great for P&S; folks who are not comfortable to do any tweakings - E-PL2 works right out the box just like P&S; delivering beautiful, professionally looking photos (just don't forget to switch WB from AWB to "incadecent" in artificial light to avoid yello cast).,-1,0
1528,1,13,If you currently own Canon S95 or anothe rtop of the line P&S; - you've seen nothing yet.,-1,1
1528,1,14,S95 doesn't even come close to breathtaking "bokeh" or "out of focus" backgrounds you can easily achieve with E-PL2 not to mention extremely sharp looking photos.,-1,1
1528,1,15,DSLR owners probably won't be surprised too much but P&S; would truly appreciate the ease with which you can take those kind of pictures w/o any tweaking or even thinking.,-1,1
1529,1,0,pl1 and pl2 both great cameras.,-1,0
1529,1,1,i bought both cameras and returned one.,-1,0
1529,1,2,i could have gone either way. the e-pl1 has the best image quality available in a four hundred dollar camera, period.,-1,0
1529,1,3,i ended up keeping the pl2 mainly because i wanted the better kit lens which also supports wide angle converter lenses.,-1,0
1529,1,4,i'm interested in wide angle photography and this was cheaper for me in the long run (over either buying the e-pl1 + mkII kit lens or epl1 + one of the extremely expensive wide angle lenses).,-1,0
1529,1,5,the e-pl2's better screen, additional art filter (really useful, imo), and better manual controls made the decision even easier.,-1,0
1529,1,6,it's also much more solidly built.,-1,0
1529,1,7,on the other hand, i thought the pl1's screen was perfectly adequate and i still personally prefer the more retro styling of the e-pl1 and would probably recommend the e-pl1 to anyone who just wanted the absolute best bang/buck image quality.,-1,0
1529,1,8,if you want to use converter lenses (on the kit lens) and the dramatic tone filter then i strongly recommend the e-pl2.my,-1,0
1529,1,9,previous cameras were all point-and-shoots, but i've also spent some time playing with a friend's canon dslr.,-1,0
1530,1,0,Extremely pleased.,-1,0
1530,1,1,I've had this camera for about 4 weeks.,-1,0
1530,1,2,The bottom line is I'm extremely pleased.,-1,0
1530,1,3,For me small size and light weight matters.,-1,0
1530,1,4,At the same time I need a fast CCD and lenses.,-1,1
1530,1,5,I was considering a high end compact when the Olympus PEN E-PL1 caught my eye in a store.,-1,1
1530,1,6,I was not considering an interchangeable lens system until I saw the PEN.,-1,1
1530,1,7,Additionally I purchased the Zuiko Four Thirds 70 to 300mm zoom and the micro Four Thirds adapter ring.,-1,1
1530,1,8,I picked this lens over the micro Four Thirds 70-300mm because it is faster.The combination of the standard 14-43mm zoom with the 70-300 is great.,-1,1
1530,1,9,I don't miss the gap in between one bit.I have been a fan of Olympus Cameras for over a decade and this camera lives up to their high standards.,-1,1
1530,1,10,Overall the camera is really great, allowing me to to control whatever I want to control.,-1,0
1530,1,11,I have found the controls to be easy to learn, and with practice they do become intuitive.,-1,0
1530,1,12,The color and image quality are fabulous.My,-1,0
1530,1,13,only negatives are the lack of a macro feature in the standard 14-42mm lens (Olympus offers an adapter lens) and the overall length of the 14-42 mm lens when it is in the unlocked position.,-1,1
1530,1,14,It gets in the way when I am hiking and it gets smudged because it sticks out so far.I was concerned about the lack of a viewfinder, especially with the 70-300mm lens, but I have found the LCD screen to be adequate 90% of the time.,-1,1
1530,1,15,Yes it is very hard to see in bright sunlight but I quickly learned to look over the top of the camera to get pointed correctly,  then there is enough of an image to compose.,-1,1
1530,1,16,But if you can find the slightest shade the screen is very visible.,-1,1
1530,1,17,I  probably will eventually buy the add on electronic viewfinder, but I am doing fine without it for nowThe body and lens are rugged.,-1,1
1530,1,18,I carry the camera hiking and it is doing just fine even though it is already been knocked around a bit.,-1,1
1530,1,19,Although it is all plastic, it does not feel flimsy and I like the lighter weight and the fact that scratches will not show.What I am especially pleased about is the speed of the CCD and lenses.,-1,1
1530,1,20,Most of my photography is in the woods in the early morning.,-1,1
1530,1,21,I have yet to find a time when the system has been challenged by low light.,-1,1
1530,1,22,I often step down the ISO and aperture and shoot at a lower shutter speed.,-1,1
1530,1,23,With the 14-42mm lens and the built in image stabilization, everything is nice and clear at 1/15th or 1/30th of a second.For transport I could not go with a shoulder strap type bag as it would interfere with my backpack.,-1,1
1530,1,24,My whole kit: body with 14-42mm lens, 70-300mm lens, remote release etc. all fit into a 7.5"x 4.5" x 6.5" belt mounted case and I don't notice the weight hiking.As I said at the beginning, I'm extremely pleased,-1,1
1531,1,0,A+. Excellent 'next' camera for a P&S; user or even a lighter DSLR replacement.,-1,0
1531,1,1,I have owned film SLRs, DSLRs and P&S; (point-and-shoot) cameras stemming back to the 1990s.,-1,0
1531,1,2,So, while I am not a seasoned pro with 40 years shooting experience, odds are that you are not either.,-1,0
1531,1,3,And that is why this camera is for YOU.Many of the other reviewers have already commented on nearly all aspects of this fabulous camera, so I will skip the redundancy.,-1,0
1531,1,4,I will merely add that this camera is a natural progression for people looking for either more control, better images, or lens selection--when upgrading from a P&S; camera such as Canon, Panasonic, Nikon or other 'all-in-one' cameras.,-1,0
1531,1,5,Alternatively, if you a family/candid shooter,  yet are shlepping around a huge DSLR that you find overly encumbering, this is a fabulous substitute.,-1,0
1531,1,6,Five Stars.,-1,0
1532,1,0,Gets the job done!,-1,1
1532,1,1,I'm not a pro to write about a detailed review for this product but I have read tons of customer reviews from different sites comparing different cameras comparable to this one before deciding to buy it.,-1,1
1532,1,2,And based on that, this model is really the best in its category - semi-dslr or EVIL or whatever you call it.The first time I used it was at Grand Prix event and I'd say, it served me well and my friends who are 'seasoned' photographers (who use high-end dslrs) were impressed!,-1,1
1532,1,3,If you ask me, I took better pictures than they did and I was just an amateur photographer.i,-1,1
1532,1,4,would recommend this site for the technical review of this product: [...],-1,1
1533,1,0,After using the E-PL1, I wasn't sure a m4/3 was for me... Then I tried the E-PL2... Originally, because of the price difference I decided to buy the Olympus E-PL1.,-1,1
1533,1,1,Although this is a nice camera, I found many aspects of the camera to be somewhat disappointing.,-1,1
1533,1,2,For example, it's kit 14-42mm kit lens was painfully slow in terms of autofocus, and sometimes wouldn't focus at all when the lighting conditions were less than optimal.,-1,1
1533,1,3,There were many times I had missed out on photo opportunities because the lens couldn't focus fast enough.I also didn't like the overall design of the camera body on the E-PL1.,-1,1
1533,1,4,It's grip was to small for my large hands, and as such never felt comfortable in use.,-1,1
1533,1,5,It's smaller screen was also recessed, allowing for dirt and dust debris to get caught in the edges and make cleaning  it annoying.The screen on back having a half the resolution of the E-PL2 made it a requirement to buy a EVF.,-1,1
1533,1,6,I often struggled in bright light to manually focus something sharp enough because of the poor screen on the E-PL1.So how did the E-PL2 compare?,-1,1
1533,1,7,Well, in my opinion it's better in just about every regard.The E-PL2 has a revised kit lens that not only is as sharp as the previous model, but contains only one moving part, and this less likely to break.,-1,0
1533,1,8,This design change also improved the focusing speed dramatically, in both well lit environments, as well as poorly lit environments.The body design was also much improved over the E-PL1 in my opinion.,-1,0
1533,1,9,Although it's a little thicker, the new grip feels less awkward and instead more natural when shooting or  just holding the camera.The button layout seems more logically placed as well.,-1,0
1533,1,10,The addition to a scroll wheel is a nice touch.,-1,0
1533,1,11,I'll add kudos to Olympus for resisting any temptation to go with a touch screen design, I feel that this decision gives the E-PL2 a handed advantage over competition like the Panasonic DMC-GF2.,-1,0
1533,1,12,Of course that's just my personal preference.The new screen on the E-PL2 is great.,-1,0
1533,1,13,The higher resolution and size, make manually focusing so much easier.,-1,0
1533,1,14,It's also much easier to use in brighter day light conditions, when compared to the E-PL1.,-1,0
1533,1,15,I also love the fact that the screen isn't recessed into the body, it makes it much easier to clean smudges, or dust from it.I'm so happy with the performance of this camera and the image quality, I'd recommend it over many entry level DSLR's I've used over the years.,-1,0
1534,1,0,Small camera that will surprise you.,-1,1
1534,1,1,I purchased this camera from amazon about a month ago in an effort to rekindle my photography hobby... it worked!,-1,1
1534,1,2,The picture quality rivals my film SLR cameras in the more common photo sizes.My main complaints about this camera kit is that one, the 14-42mm lens is horrible in low light.,-1,0
1534,1,3,Not entirely unexpected with a kit zoom lens.,-1,0
1534,1,4,I highly recommend picking up the Panasonic 20mm pancake for anything that requires a decent shutter speed in light comparable to a sunset or dimmer.My second complaint is that the neck strap included is a coarse woven nylon strap that feels like it wants to take my skin with it every time the camera shifts during basic walking.,-1,0
1534,1,5,If you plan on using this with a neck strap, look into a neoprene based strap.I chose the E-PL2 over the E-PL3 mainly because of body design.,-1,0
1534,1,6,The E-PL3 is just a smooth block that doesn't offer much in the way of grip; It's just not comfortable to hold something like that for any extended period of time.Overall, the E-PL2 is a pleasure to shoot with.,-1,1
1534,1,7,I find that I simply can't put it down.,-1,1
1534,1,8,If you're thinking about buying the Panasonic GF2 you should take that into consideration.,-1,1
1534,1,9,The GF2 is just boring, it feels too plain.,-1,1
1535,1,0,Great IQ, fun to use and looks good.,-1,0
1535,1,1,Been using mine for almost a year (since Feb '11) and loving it.,-1,0
1535,1,2,Friends and family (who are beginners and enthusiasts w/ D700/5DII) whom have tried and seen the results from my camera ended up buying/considering the same or similar m43 camera.As for the camera itself, the upgrades over the E-PL1, such as better LCD, scroll wheel, improved kit lens (14-42mm II) and redesigned body, increased the fun and usability factors.,-1,0
1535,1,3,With the stuff (below) I've bought for use with the E-PL2, I think my set is pretty much complete:- Panasonic 20/1.7 - lowlight and 'normal' like (40mm equivalent) pancake lens for almost any situation- Olympus 45/1.8 - lowlight and portrait- Olympus 9-18 - UWA, also a good walk-around lens because it goes to 36mm equiv.-,-1,0
1535,1,4,Olympus 40-150 - small and light tele zoom- Olympus VF-2 - bright, high-res EVF for better MF and usability during bright sunny days- Metz 50 AF-1 - powerful, full/wireless TTL, high-speed sync (up to 1/4000s) flash with upgradable firmware via USB- a bunch extra batteries (from 3rd-party manuf.)I,-1,0
1535,1,5,can fit all of that in a small satchel, but I normally just bring the E-PL2 w/ the 9-18, 20/1.7,,-1,0
1535,1,6,45/1.8, and VF-2 with me.That said, the E-PL2 and kit lens alone are more than capable of producing great results.,-1,0
1535,1,7,As kit lens go, the 14-42mm II is actually pretty good and is worth keeping.,-1,0
1535,1,8,It is very sharp, and has fast and quiet AF.,-1,0
1535,1,9,Unlike your typical DSLR kit lens (from Nikon/Canon), it is internally focusing, with non-rotating front element (good for polarizers) and have a decent focusing ring.,-1,0
1535,1,10,Also, it is very small and light.The reason I picked this over competing mirrorless are...- IBIS (in-body image stabilization), so practically any lens I mount, including vintage SLR ones, are stabilized- hotshoe and built-in popup flash - NEX 3/5 don't have these- wireless trigger off camera flash with TTL from the built-in popup flash- m43 lens selection- accessory port to attach stuff like the high-res VF-2- expansive menu system and customization, so you can set the auto-iso range, reassign button functions, create presets, etc.- off camera JPEGs - less time doing PP = more time shootingFinally, some minor gripes:- proprietary usb- off center tripod- no AF assist lamp nor does it use the AF assist lamp on my flash- 720p only and no efficient video encodingIt should be noted that the E-PL2 (and other CSC) is not meant to be pocketable like a P&S; although I routinely put mine in a coat pocket.,-1,1
1535,1,11,But, the E-PL2 plus a couple m43 lenses are very portable indeed; way more than a comparable DSLR + lenses.,-1,0
1535,1,12,You will always have this with you and you wouldn't attract much attention to yourself since you aren't pointing a bazooka at people.,-1,1
1535,1,13,Not only that, you don't need to get a big camera bag, heavier tripod, larger lens filters - basically more expensive accessories that you normally would with a DSLR as the entire system is smaller.,-1,1
1536,1,0,Excellent image quality, reasonably good ergonomics.,-1,1
1536,1,1,This fourth iteration of the Olympus digital PEN line is the best.,-1,1
1536,1,2,Sharpness is outstanding with excellent lenses and noise is reasonably well controlled up to ISO 800.,-1,1
1536,1,3,If you do a comparison with the DPReview RAW image comparison widget, you'll see that noise and sharpness are very similar to the Canon 7D up to ISO 800 or better, but in a much smaller, lighter package costs only 1/3 the price.,-1,1
1536,1,4,The 7D is superior to the E-PL2 in some areas, but low to medium ISO image quality, cost, and compactness are not among them.There's no question that the E-PL2's ergonomics are not optimum for the enthusiast user but they're more than adequate in the hands of someone with a reasonable amount of photo knowledge.,-1,1
1536,1,5,The convoluted menu system is certainly among the areas that the E-PL2, and all Olympus cameras, fall short of the best.,-1,0
1536,1,6,(Canon's shooting menu accessed by the center OK button is far superior in that regard.)The,-1,0
1536,1,7,E-PL2 and E-PL1 are very suitable for casual users.,-1,0
1536,1,8,The green full auto mode setting produces, on average, some of the best JPEG files that you'll find without the need for much user input.,-1,0
1536,1,9,It's easy for highly knowledgeable photographers to sneer at less sophisticated users but's that not only mean but short-sighted.,-1,0
1536,1,10,Any camera that can produce good large sensor RAW images for knowledgeable users yet capable of good results by novices is a good camera.The revised 14-42mm Mark II lens is definitely sharper in my own use than almost any other kit lens that I've used or reviewed, especially at the usually troublesome wide angle settings.,-1,0
1536,1,11,Check out the review of this lens at[..] for a quantifiable evaluation.Two of the prime benefits of any PEN series Micro Four Thirds are the in-camera image stabilization and the ability to mount other lenses while retaining full autofocus and auto exposure functionality.,-1,0
1536,1,12,As a result, you can use some of the very reasonably priced and truly excellent Olympus Four-Thirds lenses (35mm/f3.5 and 50mm/f2 ) via Olympus's MMF-2 adapter.,-1,0
1536,1,13,You can also use the excellent Panasonic Micro Four Thirds 20mm/f 1/7 prime lens while retaining full image stabilization (something that's not even possible when that same Panasonic lens is mounted on a Panasonic camera!)I bought the E-PL2 with the two lens kit that includes a lightweight 40-150mm telephoto zoom.,-1,0
1536,1,14,The included MN.Zuiko telephoto zoom is compact and sharp enough, but the older ED Zuiko 40-150mm zoom, which can be used on this Micro Four-Thirds camera via the MMF-2 adapter, is sharper.,-1,0
1536,1,15,Sadly, the older ED lens and adapter kit, which was a fabulous value when selling for under $200 including the $130 MMF-2 adapter, is now substantially more expensive and no longer nearly as good a value.,-1,0
1537,1,0,Great transition!,-1,0
1537,1,1,I'm coming from the bridge cameras that have been popular lately, point and shoot cameras with settings and options like DLSRs- with better picture quality and bigger sensors but low price tags and no lens options.I've had this Olympus Pen E-PL2 for about a week now and I love it.,-1,0
1537,1,2,The picture quality and color vibrancy is wonderful, and I am having those covetable DLSR photos without reading the manual completely.,-1,0
1537,1,3,I've barely touched it, and I realize that the intuitiveness of changing options is very good.,-1,0
1537,1,4,The autofocus is wonderful.,-1,1
1537,1,5,WONDERFUL.,-1,1
1537,1,6,Spot focus?,-1,1
1537,1,7,Wonderful!There's even an option for those of us who are afraid to change some settings that simplifies the process.. options like a bar with blurry background on one side and full focus on the other.,-1,1
1537,1,8,There are art filters, and scene filters that take the guesswork out of creating good looking photos.The lens kit the camera comes with is not bad.,-1,0
1537,1,9,It doesn't operate spectacularly in low light, so I am going to purchase the Panasonic 20mm and the Oly 45mm.,-1,0
1537,1,10,Since this is my first "real" camera, the lens seem especially pricy for me, but I'm aware that in order to have great photos in all situations and great speed I will have to get these lenses.The camera feels good in your hands and if you hold it like you used to hold cameras you'll find you don't even miss the viewfinder that isn't present.,-1,0
1537,1,11,I don't find the record button to be in the way of my natural hold, but I can see where if someone did hold their camera just a bit different it would be a problem.,-1,0
1537,1,12,I like the feel of it.,-1,0
1537,1,13,I -love- the feel of it.The included flash is pretty reasonable considering it's an attached flash.,-1,0
1537,1,14,You have to manually raise it even if you have the settings set to flash.,-1,0
1537,1,15,Flash intensity is easy to dial down, though I haven't found the option yet for timing the flash.,-1,0
1537,1,16,I suppose I'll have to pull that manual out after all.Again, I am no photographer- but I do enjoy taking good photos for posterity's sake and this camera fits the bill wonderfully.,-1,0
1537,1,17,My pets have never looked better.,-1,0
1538,1,0,This review considers not only the e-pl2 by itself but also as a part of a system.I like the Olympus 4/3rds sensor and have used my Olympus e-30 a lot both at home and on trips.,-1,0
1538,1,1,Love the quality of its photos and the quality of the Olympus lenses.,-1,0
1538,1,2,The Olympus FT system is slightly smaller and less expensive than other DSLR's of the same quality and speed.,-1,0
1538,1,3,I have not owned a point and shoot camera in years although my wife gets some very fine shots with hers.As I added lenses to my FT system, the weight/bulk became considerable, especially on trips.,-1,1
1538,1,4,So when the e-pl2 was released, I sold off my e620 and all but two of my FT lenses to buy a micro four thirds system.The e-pl2 adds features to the Penn line that earlier models needed, IMHO.,-1,1
1538,1,5,I think it's the same sensor as the one used on my e30 with perhaps a more advanced jpg processor.,-1,1
1538,1,6,I am well pleased with the camera for the reasons others have mentioned: small size, unobtrusiveness, quality lenses, quality of the photos, in-body image stabilization, etc.Every camera system is a compromise involving size, quality, and cost.,-1,1
1538,1,7,I am quite happy with the size and quality of this system.,-1,1
1538,1,8,As far as cost, you get what you pay for -- although I think Olympus charges too much for the lens hoods, which didn't come standard with any the mFT lenses, Olympus or Panasonic, that I have bought.,-1,1
1538,1,9,Also the price of Olympus batteries is a bit much as well.For low light action shots (for me it's grandchildren at field sports or recitals, plays, important family parties, etc.) I still use my Olympus e30 and the 12-60 or 50-200 lenses, sometimes with a good flash.,-1,1
1538,1,10,My e-pl2 with a zoom lens struggles in those conditions.,-1,1
1538,1,11,For everything else I now use my micro four thirds system.The pen e-pl2 really needs the quality VF-2 viewfinder when shooting outdoors, especially when using the 14-150 or 75-300 zoom.,-1,1
1538,1,12,I find I use the viewfinder most of the time for that reason and also for the added stability when shooting.,-1,1
1538,1,13,Also, it's an excellent viewfinder; I don't find myself missing the view provided by my FT DSLR.,-1,1
1538,1,14,With this viewfinder eyeglasses are not a problem.I have not used the 14-42 II kit lens much yet although I have been well pleased with the photos I have taken with it so far.,-1,0
1538,1,15,I am very pleased with the Panasonic 14 and 20mm primes.,-1,0
1538,1,16,Most of the time with those two lenses I don't need to use a flash in available light shooting.,-1,0
1538,1,17,I could go around the world with the Panasonic 14mm, the 20mm, and the Olympus 14-150 although I would hate to leave the 9-18 behind.,-1,0
1538,1,18,I am also quite satisfied with the Olympus 75-300 lens but that's more of an occasional shot lens and it does do best in good light.Unlike some critics above, I don't have any issues with the Olympus menu system and controls, probably because I was already familiar with them.You can get very good shots with this camera set to full automatic in good light situations.,-1,0
1538,1,19,However, when the lighting gets tricky, it really helps to know how to make adjustments.,-1,0
1538,1,20,Several good point and shoot cameras are quite adjustable as well so if one is moving from that type of camera to a micro four thirds camera, there shouldn't be much of a learning curve.This camera might not be good for someone who doesn't like to fuss at all before taking a picture.,-1,0
1539,1,0,Better than a DSLR and cheaper too.,-1,1
1539,1,1,I spent a long time comparing the reviews between this camera and some of the other DSLRs that came out at the time.,-1,1
1539,1,2,Some of the review sites lets you compare identical images side by side from different cameras at the same ISO level and it always felt like this one came out sharper than any of the big names.,-1,1
1539,1,3,Maybe it's because it's mirrorless, or the anti-shake mechanism is built into the sensor instead of the lens, or some internal sharp-filter algorithm.,-1,1
1539,1,4,That's all up for debate and I don't know, I just know what I see.,-1,1
1539,1,5,And if having a sharp photo is not your thing just widen the aperture to max and you can still get a very shallow depth of field and a pleasantly blurry background if you're taking portraits.This was also my first large sensor camera and in comparison my old compact cameras with their 1/2.3",-1,1
1539,1,6,sensors just looked so grainy I got rid of them completely and just walk around with this in a small Case Logic carrying case about the size of my wife's Prada purse.Overall great camera and excellent low light performance, and if you are shooting in really low light just turn on the RAW+JPG format mode and make some minor adjustments in Adobe Lightroom.,-1,1
1539,1,7,(Free trials are available if you've never used it.),-1,0
1539,1,8,There's so much extra information stored in RAW it's like CSI magic.,-1,0
1540,1,0,Great step up from point & shoot.,-1,0
1540,1,1,Bought this camera a month ago to capture better quality pictures of the baby and everything that comes with it, and something not too bulky to carry around.,-1,0
1540,1,2,The built-in pop up flash that can be tilted and the shape of the body were main reasons I chose this over the E-PL3.,-1,0
1540,1,3,Although the kit lens I hear is slower than the E-PL3, but at least it's faster that the E-PL1.some,-1,0
1540,1,4,cons:- in dim/dark situations, with the kit lens, it does have a slow focus, and you can tell it's searching for the right focus.,-1,0
1540,1,5,I like to set the focus to Single - but allow Manual Adjustment, then I still have control to tweak the initial focus.-,-1,0
1540,1,6,the video record button placement, i wish were closer in from the edge or on the top as it sometimes can be accidentally pressed, especially for self-portraits.pros:-,-1,0
1540,1,7,picture quality is much better than my Panasonic ZS7 point and shoot, it just seems more dynamic, less flat.- the auto setting for the flash seems to do pretty good on it's own.,-1,0
1540,1,8,Adding the ability to tilt the flash helps when flash is needed.,-1,0
1540,1,9,It would have been nice if the flash would have been able to stay tilted, but it springs naturally back to forward.,-1,0
1540,1,10,I found zooming the lens to 25mm with the tilt flash looks the best as then you don't see as much of the lighting contrast.-,-1,0
1540,1,11,the kit lens is collapsible.,-1,1
1540,1,12,I know some don't like that you have to unlock the lens to use it, but i like that it can collapse to a smaller size to carry around.,-1,1
1541,1,0,Everything I expected and more!,-1,0
1541,1,1,I've had this camera for a week and I am extremenly pleased with it and I would not hesitate to recommend it!,-1,0
1541,1,2,I had an SLR camera many years ago with several lenses and enjoyed it, but found the bulk, difficulty of use, etc to be a problem.,-1,1
1541,1,3,Once the era of small digital cameras came in, I switched and have had a succession of digitals ever since including Panasonic, Canon, Samsung, etc.  I've been happy with the results and especially the portability but I've recently wanted to get into better quality photos, more flexibilty, etc.,-1,1
1541,1,4,After doing a lot of research and finding the Olympus E-PL2 at a really great price (under $400)with the 14-42mm lens, I decided to take the plunge.,-1,0
1541,1,5,Picture quality is a substantial upgrade, the ergonomics of the camera are terrific and I was taking pictures minutes after I charged the battery the day it arrived!,-1,1
1541,1,6,The camera has exceeded my expectations in all areas.,-1,1
1541,1,7,Don't be put off by the menu options, etc - just spend some time experimenting and taking shots and very soon you will be comfortable with this camera.,-1,1
1541,1,8,It's very intuitive, once you understand the design and set-up.,-1,1
1541,1,9,I'm just an average amateur with a pretty good eye and a desire to get back into the hobby in a bigger way and this camera is the tool to do that!,-1,0
1541,1,10,The Scene Functions offer a lot of options and the Art functions are a lot of fun, easy to use and offer some creative touches.,-1,0
1541,1,11,Overall, I think Olympus has done a great job in design, functionality, price and flexibity!,-1,0
1541,1,12,I'm looking forward to purchasing a telephoto lens and probably the pancake lens to complete the package.,-1,1
1541,1,13,If you're considering moving up from a small digital - run, don't walk, to buy this camera.,-1,1
1542,1,0,beyond my expectation!,-1,0
1542,1,1,I gotta be honest, I'm not a professional photographer, or even come close to calling myself an amateur photographer.,-1,0
1542,1,2,I wanted something light, not a point-and-shoot, but something that can get me excited about shooting outdoors.,-1,0
1542,1,3,I felt like this was the camera worth investing, in that it's performance was pretty up-to-date, looked beautiful, and had reputation of great quality.,-1,0
1542,1,4,The ability to change lens sold me completely, and it's the perfect hybrid of the two worlds.,-1,0
1542,1,5,The lens is great for starting out, and I'm slowly going to be saving for a fancier lens later on.This is my first amazon review ever.....and well worth writing one for this product!,-1,0
1542,1,6,Really happy with the price that it came in...and also oredered a white carrying bag from ebay.,-1,0
1542,1,7,Lovely match!,-1,0
1543,1,0,Nice Camera.,-1,0
1543,1,1,Panasonic GF2 and epl2 where the 2 cameras that I was looking for.,-1,1
1543,1,2,I found that both of them were remarkably similar but chose EPL2 because it had a better low light performance, and true to its word I was astounded by the ISO 1600 pic qualities.,-1,1
1543,1,3,The low lights pictures are beautiful, they do show a little noise in the dark regions.,-1,1
1543,1,4,The automode is absolutely fabulous and you can take very nice pictures, but using the same settings, as the automode, in the manual mode it is impossible to produce that same image colors or white balance.,-1,0
1543,1,5,I find this puzzling and I think this has to do with some processing of the jpegs in the automode absent in the manual mode.,-1,0
1543,1,6,I have used this camera with canon eos 1.8/50mm lens and a 1978 vivitar f/3.5 200mm lens.,-1,0
1543,1,7,The pics are fabulous, however you only get metering in the manual mode and even then these are off by a stop number.,-1,0
1543,1,8,The kit lens 14mm-45mm has okay quality and you get decent pictures.Overall if you just want to use this as a point and shoot camera, use the automode you will be surprised by the quality.,-1,0
1543,1,9,To use this in the manual mode with different lenses you do need to struggle around a bit, and post process the pictures to get the desired quality picture.,-1,0
1544,1,0,After years of fighting the tide, I finally decided to make the serious plunge to go digital.,-1,1
1544,1,1,While using a Minolta Maxxum 7000 and 9000 for years, I also use a Contax IR-4 digital I purchased some years ago and, while the image quality and features were great for it's size, I really wanted a digital with a viewfinder (too much playing trombone to see the screen with my old eyes for cameras without a v/f).,-1,1
1544,1,2,After much research, I finally settled on the Olympus E-PL2.,-1,1
1544,1,3,I liked the advantage of changeable lenses and preferred the smaller body size which makes this camera more convenient when traveling.,-1,1
1544,1,4,Features!... this is quite literally a case of ten pounds of corn in a two pound sack!,-1,1
1544,1,5,While a nicely designed package, this camera has more operations and settings than the space shuttle!,-1,1
1544,1,6,Talk about a steep learning curve!,-1,1
1544,1,7,Not terribly intuitive, so you have to spend time... a LOT of time with the manual.,-1,1
1544,1,8,Now, here's the problem... the paper manual is like a Mk.I version... has most of the information but not all and certainly not some very important instructions.,-1,1
1544,1,9,Nooo, these are on the included CD in a .pdf,-1,1
1544,1,10,version of the Mk.II manual.,-1,1
1544,1,11,So unless you are going to carry a laptop with you into the field, you will need to either print out the entire CD manual, or go through page by page and print out the missing pieces and make an addendum for your handy paper manual!Well, I have been reading and working with the E-PL2 for about two days now and I am beginning to learn how to navigate the many and varied menus.,-1,1
1544,1,12,I have no doubt once I learn to navigate the menus and tailor the buttons to my needs, this camera will be rewarding to use.As for feel...,-1,0
1544,1,13,I appreciate it's light weight, but still it feels somehow rather cheap in materials used to make it.,-1,0
1544,1,14,I wish there were more of a metal feel to the body... aluminum frame... or titanium!,-1,0
1544,1,15,A camera with the capabilities of this one should not feel like a ten dollar plastic throw-away.,-1,0
1544,1,16,Perhaps this can be user improved with a nice leather half-case.The optional VF-2 electronic viewfinder is wonderful!,-1,0
1544,1,17,Clear, bright, and fully adjustable.,-1,1
1544,1,18,While initially pricey, to my eyes it is far worth the money spent!,-1,1
1545,1,0,Great M4/3 camera.,-1,0
1545,1,1,I was shopping around a decent micro 4/3 camera.,-1,0
1545,1,2,Read a lot of reviews and even tried several of the new arrivals.,-1,0
1545,1,3,Having used an E PL1 in the past I knew about the quality of Olympus M43s cameras.,-1,0
1545,1,4,Although the white version looks a bit flimsy and plasticky at times, it feels about right in your hands and image quality is really good.,-1,0
1545,1,5,Love the art filters that it has loaded up.,-1,0
1545,1,6,The new Mark 2 lens it comes with is really silent and useful for most of the jobs you throw it.,-1,0
1545,1,7,JPEG engine is superb, as in other Olympuses.,-1,1
1545,1,8,For the good image quality and discounted price, is hard to be wrong with this Olympus.,-1,1
1546,1,0,Great camera for all around use.,-1,0
1546,1,1,I've owned an e-pl2 for over a year now, and I've taken thousands of pics with it.,-1,0
1546,1,2,First of all, the kit 14-42 lens is great.,-1,0
1546,1,3,Very sharp and easy to use.,-1,0
1546,1,4,The camera's scene and art modes take some time to appreciate, but are well worth it once you understand how to apply them.,-1,0
1546,1,5,My 4 star rating would be 5 stars because the camera does take some trial and error to use properly.,-1,0
1546,1,6,If someone is used to a Nikon DSLR with it's simple operating controls and functions, then the E-PL2 is going to frustrate them.,-1,0
1546,1,7,It's not a big clunky Nikon that everyone sees the pros using at weddings.,-1,0
1546,1,8,No.  It's a small(ish) and tech geeky sort of critter, and very fun to take with you whereever you may be going, instead of dragging the big monster Nikon with you.,-1,0
1546,1,9,And the pics do turn out great in available light.,-1,0
1546,1,10,The flash is also built in, and easy to use for fill in when needed.,-1,0
1546,1,11,I used the 45-150 lens for taking available light pics from the back of a large hall and I was then convinced at just how great a lens that is as well.,-1,0
1546,1,12,Get the 45-150 lens and you will not be sorry, that's for sure.,-1,0
1546,1,13,I am adding a final point that I am now in process of selling off my E-PL2 in order to purchase an E-PL5 camera.,-1,1
1546,1,14,I will use the same lenses, but I really wanted the moveable rear viewing screen, not to mention that the E-PL5 is a step ahead in having a larger chip.,-1,1
1546,1,15,But this is not to say that the E-PL2 is a slouch in any sense of the word, and they are pretty cheap now (under $300 new with the kit lens).,-1,1
1546,1,16,So get one if you're considering a Micro4/3 camera.,-1,1
1546,1,17,The Sony is too darn expensive and I don't like their color balance (yes, it can be adjusted, but why does the factory setting have to be wrong?),-1,1
1546,1,18,Sorry sony fans, but the NX cameras are not as good as Olympus.,-1,1
1546,1,19,Sadly, now that Sony owns Olympus, I expect for them to make changes to the product line and possibly not for the best.,-1,1
1546,1,20,Olympus good, sony just OK.,-1,1
1547,1,0,Had it for about a year, love it.,-1,0
1547,1,1,Easy pocket(book) carry w pancake.,-1,1
1547,1,2,I've been using this for about a year now, and I continue to be astonished by the quality, clarity, and richness of the images.,-1,1
1547,1,3,I have owned a number of high-end point-and-shoot cameras because the compactness is very important to me.,-1,1
1547,1,4,I like to have the camera with me all the time, everywhere I go, without having to think about it.,-1,1
1547,1,5,The Olympus Pen E-PL2 gives me that carrying convenience while delivering image quality dramatically better than the high-end compact cameras.For maximum compactness, including ease of carrying in a small pocketbook, I purchased a pancake lens.,-1,1
1547,1,6,With this I don't have zoom ability, but the camera is very very very small.,-1,1
1547,1,7,In most situations because the image and resolution are so good I can crop down to get fairly good pictures of fairly distant things.,-1,1
1547,1,8,If I think I'll be actively looking for long-distance shots, I just carry a zoom lens in the pocketbook.,-1,1
1547,1,9,It only takes 15 seconds to swap lenses anyway.The "intelligent auto" works well, making it easy to point-and-shoot in many conditions.,-1,0
1547,1,10,The feature set is quite rich and pretty easy to learn, so it's easy to step up to do more with aperture, white balance, manual focus, etc.,-1,0
1548,1,0,Amazing photographs.,-1,0
1548,1,1,What I love about this camera is that you can spend much more time taking photos and less time understanding the mechanical workings of the camera.,-1,0
1548,1,2,It is wonderfully intuitive and has art functions to create effects in camera instead of post production.,-1,0
1548,1,3,I highly recommend this to serious enthusiasts.,-1,0
1549,1,0,Great prosumer camera especially for travelling.,-1,1
1549,1,1,I've used this camera for about 8 months.,-1,1
1549,1,2,I upgraded to it from canon digicams as I yearned for better photos.,-1,1
1549,1,3,It has the right mix of professional level controls and novice controls like iAuto that will adjust features like background blur, depth of background focus etc to create excellent pictures.Kit lens is average but has the advantage of cheap accessories like wide angle adapter which has helped with indoor family shots where distances may be limited.,-1,1
1549,1,4,It's highly portable even pocketable in cargo pants and was an excellent travel companion on a trip to London.,-1,1
1549,1,5,I packed this camera, the kit lens, panasonic pancake 20/1.7 lens and a tablet in a slim laptop bag and was able to hop in and out of buses and the underground without being burdened with the weight of dslr.Combined with the above mentioned panasonic lens it takes excellent pictures as it allows a lower ISO setting.,-1,1
1549,1,6,I find the flash very useful and even has a limited bounce feature.,-1,1
1549,1,7,In addition the flash has multiple settings unlike a digicam.,-1,1
1549,1,8,Another advantage is the wide selection of reasonably priced lenses especially primes, plus using a cheap adapter Olympus' 4/3 lens are also available.,-1,0
1549,1,9,I've had very good experience with the 40/150 3.5 telephoto lens.,-1,0
1549,1,10,In body stabilisation also allows use of a wide variety of new and older lens with varying adapters.,-1,0
1549,1,11,It may be expensive compared to an entry level dslr but in my opinion the size and comparative image quality more than compensates for this.,-1,0
1549,1,12,Autofocus is slower than in the 3 series pens but not one of those cameras has the complete feature set of the E-PL2.,-1,1
1549,1,13,Therefore I will keep this camera and wait for a cheaper member of the new OM-D series to be released.,-1,1
1550,1,0,E-PL2 is fun to use and provides very pleasing results.,-1,0
1550,1,1,The E-PL2 is one of the most enjoyable cameras I have used along with the Lumix 20mm f/1.7 lens attached.,-1,0
1550,1,2,This Pen Lite (my first Olympus) deserves five stars if you try to view photography as an art form, not just technical specifications.,-1,0
1550,1,3,I'm not a pro so it's hard to do with so much emphasis on specs.,-1,0
1550,1,4,You get a different feel from the PEN in comparison to the similar Panasonic m4/3 cameras.,-1,0
1550,1,5,I think the E-PL2 remains true to the spirit of the GF1 more than the new GF series.,-1,0
1550,1,6,I never owned a Leica, but now understand why people love them.The E-PL2 has it quirks and will not be for everyone.,-1,0
1550,1,7,I am use to shooting Canon and Panasonic.,-1,0
1550,1,8,At first I was put off by the AF, menu and white balance under indoor lighting, but once I got the menu and buttons down, I could make the proper adjustments easily.,-1,1
1550,1,9,Some reviews complain about no dedicated WB button, but this not a problem if you learn the camera.The jpeg results have very pleasing colors that seem warm and natural.,-1,1
1550,1,10,I would say the shots have more pleasing skin tones than my technically better Lumix G3. (I reviewed the G3 also on Amazon.),-1,1
1550,1,11,Noise is controlled well up to 1600 ISO and is it doesn't exhibit chroma blotches that even DSLRs produce.,-1,1
1550,1,12,The art filters are fun to play with on the camera.There is a new model, the E-PL3, but I prefer the retro styling (grip) and built-in flash of the E-PL2.,-1,0
1550,1,13,The price seems to have come down on this model at Amazon.,-1,0
1550,1,14,There are new 12mm and 45mm m4/3 lenses coming out, but for now the 20mm is the best value.,-1,0
1551,1,0,I'm so glad I traded from the E-PL1 to the E-PL2!! Phenomenal camera for its size.,-1,0
1551,1,1,Really, really good image quality in both JPEG and RAW, especially in ample lighting.,-1,0
1551,1,2,The ability to use legacy lenses really helps in creativity and versatility.,-1,0
1551,1,3,The size means you can carry it to more places (hiking, parties, urban photography, travel, etc).,-1,0
1551,1,4,Studio photos are very competitive with larger DSLRs, as well.,-1,0
1551,1,5,Very versatile and a great foundation for anyone looking to get into more manual control or as an excellent alternative to larger dSLR.I use this camera with the 14-42mm MKII kit lens, a Konica Hexanon 40mm f1.8 legacy lens, a Konica Hexanon 50mm f1.7 legacy lens, the Olympus VF-2 viewfinder, and a Metz 44AF strobe.,-1,0
1551,1,6,A great buy overall!!,-1,0
1552,1,0,E-PL2=A Good Time.,-1,0
1552,1,1,These are just my initial thoughts about the E-PL2, which I have been using for about a week.,-1,1
1552,1,2,I will add to this as necessary.I gave this camera a 5 star rating, mainly because it's SO enjoyable to use.,-1,1
1552,1,3,There are a couple things that would keep it from being a 5 star camera, but those are overshadowed by the sheer enjoyment of its use.One of these things is the lack of an AF assist lamp for low light.,-1,1
1552,1,4,Contrast AF has a bit of trouble in lower light situations, forcing you to (at times) either aim at a light source to get the AF to work properly, or manual focus.,-1,1
1552,1,5,The XZ-1 offers an AF assist lamp... why not the E-PL2?,-1,1
1552,1,6,Seems like an easy thing to add to a body that's bigger than the XZ-1.,-1,1
1552,1,7,It would be a welcome addition, but the lack of it is by no means ruining the camera.Also, C-AF isn't great.,-1,1
1552,1,8,I'm not sure if this is a facet of the contrast detect system, but it's not all that useful in tracking moving subjects, at least in my limited trials.,-1,1
1552,1,9,Sure, you can use the tracking AF, but that can be slow and a little tedious.Shutter delay could also be improved just a bit.RAW processing time isn't great at all.,-1,0
1552,1,10,I could be wrong, but the XZ-1 seemed faster in this area.,-1,0
1552,1,11,Luckily, the jpegs look amazing, so I'll likely use RAW only sparingly.Other than these things, so far I LOVE this camera.,-1,0
1552,1,12,It's incredibly fun to travel around with, and I take it EVERYWHERE, which is something I never did with my D300s and all my lenses.,-1,0
1552,1,13,The kit lens is pretty good for what it is, has a decent range (could use just a bit more tele), reasonable macro, and is quite sharp.,-1,0
1552,1,14,AND it's tiny, which is one of the best things about this camera... the TINY lenses.I had the Oly 17mm 2.8 and returned it for the Pany 14mm 2.5, which so far I LOVE.,-1,0
1552,1,15,Very fast AF with this lens (which focuses internally), and it is sharper than the Oly.The sensor in this camera is stellar.,-1,0
1552,1,16,For what it is, it really excels.,-1,0
1552,1,17,IQ is very good from this camera, much better than the XZ-1 (which has much more noise at lower ISOs).,-1,0
1552,1,18,I do wish the ISO started at 100, and that the camera had a built-in ND filter like the XZ-1, which is simply an amazing tool to have.,-1,0
1552,1,19,I have ordered an ND filter for bright days (which happen all the time here in Albuquerque NM).The bevy of lenses available spans a pretty good range, though I think both Panasonic and Olympus could be offering more fast prime lenses.,-1,0
1552,1,20,Many of Olympus' lenses really aren't that fast... even their fast ones.,-1,0
1552,1,21,With a Panasonic 20mm 1.7 running around, you'd think Oly could have at least made their 17mm a 2.0.Minor complaints aside though, this thing is a joy.,-1,0
1552,1,22,It has literally inspired me to take more photos, and in many more (and varied) situations, than ever before.,-1,0
1552,1,23,LOVE the micro 4/3 system.,-1,0
1552,1,24,I hope they keep releasing great accessories and lenses for me to enjoy.(Update),-1,0
1552,1,25,Well I've been using the camera for a while now, and I find that I love it more and more every day.,-1,0
1552,1,26,I now have the Oly 9-18mm and the Pana 20mm lenses for it, in addition to the kit lens.,-1,0
1552,1,27,ALL lenses perform very admirably.,-1,0
1552,1,28,The 20mm AF is a little slow, but the lens is very nice.,-1,0
1552,1,29,The 9-18mm is great, very fast focus, and really sharp, especially in the center.,-1,0
1552,1,30,And the kit lens?,-1,0
1552,1,31,That little thing is a wonder.,-1,0
1552,1,32,The focusing is fast and accurate, and it's bloody sharp for a kit lens.,-1,0
1552,1,33,One of the best kit lenses I've used.Okay, now for the bad.,-1,0
1552,1,34,I considered dropping the rating of this camera by a star, but figured it's not claiming to be great at this particular feature, so I'll leave it alone.,-1,0
1552,1,35,Getting pics of fast moving subjects is a chore.,-1,1
1552,1,36,It's a frustrating experience.,-1,1
1552,1,37,Well, first the 3fps isn't stellar, but that's not really the main issue.,-1,1
1552,1,38,There are two real problems: One is the slideshow that happens in the evf while you're bursting (meaning you get to see each photo as it's taken, instead of just the continuing view of your subjects).,-1,1
1552,1,39,Now, this is an issue with most point and shoots (maybe all of them), so I can't knock the cam for it too much, but this camera being positioned as it is in the market, I would expect better.But the deal killer?,-1,1
1552,1,40,The continuous AF.,-1,1
1552,1,41,Bad.,-1,1
1552,1,42,I kid you not when I say it will move in and out of focus on a non-moving subject, so getting it to stick to one that's all over the place?,-1,1
1552,1,43,And the tracking AF is terrible as well, unless you've got one subject, moving relatively slowly.,-1,1
1552,1,44,I've resigned myself to using the single AF, and just being as opportunistic as possible, which as you can imagine yields pretty lackluster results most of the time.Does this ruin the camera?,-1,0
1552,1,45,It's an amazing little piece of hardware, and the lens line is great, and just getting better (Oly is coming out with both a 12mm f2, 75mm 1.8, and a 60mm 2.8 macro).,-1,0
1552,1,46,Photos are pretty clean up to 800 (though a small amount of noise is visible as low as 400), and still usable at 1600.,-1,0
1552,1,47,3200 is pushing it.,-1,0
1552,1,48,But for a sensor smaller than APS-C, that's pretty great.,-1,0
1552,1,49,Colors are awesome and Oly jpeg processing is amazing.,-1,0
1552,1,50,There's a lot to like about this camera, and I think for what it is, it still deserves 5 stars.,-1,0
1552,1,51,But be clear- this camera is not for sports, and even grabs of your fast moving little ones and pets can prove to be a chore.,-1,0
1552,1,52,Remember that and you'll be very happy.,-1,0
1553,1,0,A fun, easy-to-carry camera system.,-1,0
1553,1,1,Jumped on a sale of this camera and the newer 14-42mm, and I love it.,-1,0
1553,1,2,Light, but sturdy.,-1,0
1553,1,3,Very good picture quality, easy to use.,-1,0
1553,1,4,Make sure to update the firmware (not hard to do) because it'll give your autofocusing a healthy improvement.Best thing for me is the compactness.,-1,0
1553,1,5,Combine this camera with this lens, a 45-200mm and a VF-3 viewfinder, and it still takes up only a little more space than one of my Canon 50Ds with a 17-55 lens.The pop-up flash is rather interesting because, if you simply pull the mechanism back slightly, you can bounce the flash off the ceiling for a better looking portrait(make sure you're at least 3-4 feet from your subject, but not more than about 12 feet)I wasn't thrilled with the white color, especially when you add the silver VF-3 and the black 45-200mm, but it does have the advantage of not getting really hot in the sun.,-1,1
1554,1,0,Great upgrade from the old point and shoot.,-1,1
1554,1,1,As a newbie to photography, the E-PL2 really appealed to me.,-1,1
1554,1,2,I felt it was time to move beyond my old Canon Powershot 880 IS to something with some more manual control.,-1,1
1554,1,3,So far I'm not disappointed.,-1,1
1554,1,4,This could be a great stepping stone for anyone who wants to move up to SLRs but aren't quite ready just yet.,-1,1
1555,1,0,Nice looking, very comfortable.,-1,0
1555,1,1,I've used the Oly Pen E-PL2 for about six months now and I can say it's a pretty nice camera.,-1,0
1555,1,2,I'm a photo enthusiast, and I usually shoot with my Leica M8.2 or Canon 7D.,-1,0
1555,1,3,I just needed a portable camera that was budget friendly that other people could use if I wanted a photo of me.,-1,0
1555,1,4,The SLR is too big, and the Leica is too expensive not to mention it's not user friendly to strangers.,-1,0
1555,1,5,The Olympus is not pocketable, however it's okay...I just put it in my purse or carry bag.,-1,0
1555,1,6,The camera is customizable so you can set it up for your preferences (nice).,-1,0
1555,1,7,But right out of the box, I found I could use the iAuto and let the camera think for me, and I immediately produced beautiful photos effortlessly.,-1,0
1555,1,8,Anyone can use this camera on iAuto and the results out of the camera will be very good and ready to use.,-1,0
1555,1,9,Some noise was visible in the shadow areas of my living if blown up larger, but a noise reduction program would easily take that out.I use Elements or Aperture to process my photos, so no review about the included software.,-1,0
1555,1,10,I never use the camera's included software.I love the white and silver.,-1,0
1555,1,11,It looks like a normal point and shoot, so folks don't mind me taking pictures in public.Overall great camera!,-1,0
1556,1,0,It gives me so much fun.,-1,0
1556,1,1,As soon an I held E-PL2 out of the box, I knew it was a serious camera.,-1,0
1556,1,2,It is a very well built nice looking camera, and felt substantial in my hands.,-1,0
1556,1,3,I have been using both full-frame DSLR and compact cameras.,-1,0
1556,1,4,E-PL2 is one of the new class of cameras that fills nicely in between.,-1,0
1556,1,5,It is small, but not too small for holding with two hands.,-1,0
1556,1,6,The sensor is smaller than full-frame but much bigger than ones in compacts, thus takes decent pictures under wider range of conditions.,-1,1
1556,1,7,My compact camera has more pixels than E-PL2, but E-PL2 takes much smoother and realistic pictures.,-1,1
1556,1,8,As the matter of fact, there is no comparison in terms of the picture quality.I do not use scene and art modes, or movie feature.,-1,1
1556,1,9,I rarely use full automatic mode, because it disables controls I need, but my wife appreciate the convenience as well as the quality of the pictures it takes.,-1,1
1556,1,10,We both like Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 on it so much, and we will probably not going to use the kit lens as much.,-1,1
1556,1,11,The combination takes beautiful pictures.,-1,1
1556,1,12,By the way, f/1.7 makes the rather weak built-in flash useful.,-1,1
1556,1,13,Focus is on the slow side though.It took two days to set up the camera to my liking.,-1,1
1556,1,14,Once set, the camera started working as I expected except for the white balance.,-1,1
1556,1,15,I still need to pay attention to the white balance.,-1,1
1556,1,16,I think it is too sensitive or over-compensating under compact FL and some other lighting conditions.,-1,1
1556,1,17,I hope Olympus makes it right with a new firmware in the future.,-1,0
1556,1,18,I need to either post-process each picture, or keep adjusting the white balance manually while I take pictures.,-1,0
1556,1,19,That is a minor inconvenience to me though, and it is totally eclipsed by the fun I am having.I got Canon EF mount adapter and tried with 24-105mm, 16-35mm and 70-300mm EF lenses.,-1,0
1556,1,20,Of course there is no AF, but the pictures are nice and so much fun.,-1,0
1556,1,21,FLM of 2 makes 70-300mm a 140-600mm super telephoto.,-1,0
1556,1,22,Not practical, but fun.,-1,0
1556,1,23,$6 Zuiko CP filter works well.,-1,0
1556,1,24,$49 Polaroid flash is compact enough and gives good amount of light and bounce, but manual mode or auto-focus assist lamp do not work with E-PL2.,-1,0
1556,1,25,Still, $49 is reasonable.I should go get the view finder, super wide lens and telephoto zoom.,-1,0
1556,1,26,It is so much fun!,-1,0
1557,1,0,Great Camera size & Price.,-1,0
1557,1,1,I recently sold my Nikon D70, which I have had for years, and bought this camera.,-1,0
1557,1,2,The camera is small and light weight.,-1,0
1557,1,3,I find myself taking this camera places i would have left my old Nikon behind.,-1,0
1557,1,4,This alone makes the camera worth while to have.,-1,0
1557,1,5,If you do not have the camera with you then you cannot get a picture.,-1,1
1557,1,6,The focus is fast and the shutter lag time is non-existent.,-1,1
1557,1,7,I really like the live scenes and artistic modes of the camera.,-1,1
1557,1,8,I have the standard lens and the Telephoto lens and they both work great.,-1,1
1557,1,9,The video is HD and it works well for short videos.,-1,1
1557,1,10,I did find that the lens would need to focus during the video especially if you zoom in or out.,-1,1
1557,1,11,This gives a brief time that the video is out of focus.,-1,1
1557,1,12,I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a SLR but would like to not carry around a large heavy camera.,-1,0
1558,1,0,Very Impressed!,-1,0
1558,1,1,I am very impressed with the quality of the photos and the responsiveness of the camera.,-1,0
1558,1,2,I have owned the Olympus e-510 and currently own the e-620.,-1,1
1558,1,3,I love the compactness and the low light(with no flash) photo quality in comparison with the large D-SLR Olympus Cameras.,-1,1
1558,1,4,I am probably going to sell my e-620 now that I see the quality of the photos and the compactness of the camera.,-1,1
1558,1,5,The only downside is the lack of viewfinder but I can get beyond that for now.,-1,1
1558,1,6,Some day I may buy the optional electric viewfinder.,-1,1
1558,1,7,The camera is very well made and easy to use, though I was already familiar with Olympus.,-1,1
1558,1,8,Videos are great also with this camera.,-1,0
1558,1,9,For $300 it is a very good buy.,-1,0
1559,1,0,Wonderful Micro 4/3rd to start with.,-1,0
1559,1,1,Only lacks full HD.,-1,0
1559,1,2,I love this camera.,-1,0
1559,1,3,It's replaced my Olympus E-3.,-1,0
1559,1,4,The Micro 4/3rds system has replaced my 4/3rds.,-1,0
1559,1,5,I've replaced my lenses because of this camera.,-1,0
1559,1,6,Works with my wireless FL-50 flashes.Downsizing is wonderful for the mind & back, no more lugging around heavy lenses & bodies.,-1,0
1559,1,7,Not so wonderful for the wallet but that comes with the territory!Cons?,-1,0
1559,1,8,Needs full HD video,-1,0
1560,1,0,Awesome.,-1,0
1560,1,1,i have the old e-pl1 and this is THE UPGRADE, firs the quality build is awesome is more robust construction, lot of corrected details like the metal triangles for the strap now comes with plastic cover because in the old pen this little guys scratch the cam, the lense kite is improve smaller, quicker, and light, the grip of the cam is also improve is not cheap plastic, more like leather grip or something idk, compare with the epl1 this one is more biggy more thick but still very portable, when it power ups the difference is very notable, Live view is improved faster and the big higher res screen wins.,-1,0
1560,1,2,the pop-up flash is more powerful and the control wheel is great.,-1,0
1560,1,3,Is an awesome camera.,-1,0
1561,1,0,Good learner.,-1,0
1561,1,1,I think this camera is great !,-1,0
1561,1,2,Im learning photography so its been a good and easy camera  to learn the basics.,-1,0
1561,1,3,Even if your not a photographer and just want nice pictures, this camera is perfect,-1,0
1562,1,0,Great Pictures, Shoddy Battery Management.,-1,0
1562,1,1,+ Amazing picture quality+ Micro four-thirds lens mount+ Acceptable video quality- Battery management sucks!-,-1,0
1562,1,2,User interface (menu and button organization) needs massive facelift- Expensive,-1,1
1563,1,0,Feel I spend my money right.,-1,1
1563,1,1,Resuming... a good purchase!Again Olympus get me feeling I paid a fair price and get bit more value for the price.,-1,1
1563,1,2,I have used many compacts, and recently a have owned a D5000 from Nikon, what has been stolen.,-1,0
1563,1,3,The general picture is very good, and in some cases superior to D5000 from my point of view, specially in sharpness and color saturation.,-1,0
1563,1,4,Controls are somewhat easy, but near to a compact than a DSLR, but very usable and powerful.,-1,0
1563,1,5,This camera is overall very recommendable.,-1,0
1564,1,0,Great Camera - Poor manual.,-1,0
1564,1,1,I wanted to upgrade from my Panasonic DMC-FZ50 (a very good camera with a Leica designed lens).,-1,0
1564,1,2,I did a lot of research.,-1,0
1564,1,3,My criteria: higher quality pictures, which meant a larger processor, portability (if possible lighter than the Panasonic as most of my photography is on vacations and I did not want to lug around heavy equipment) and a good viewfinder (which meant ruling out cameras which only have LCD screens like the NEX5 - in daylight I find LCDs useless for serious photography).,-1,0
1564,1,4,Some DSLRs are reasonably compact, like the Sony A55 or the small Pentax, but remember telephoto lenses are still big and heavy.,-1,1
1564,1,5,So the field narrowed to micro four thirds cameras which have processors close to DLSRs in size but still remain easily portable although not pocketable.,-1,1
1564,1,6,I ruled out the GH2 as too expensive and the G2 and others as still too large.,-1,1
1564,1,7,I settled on the Pen EPL2 and have not been disappointed.,-1,1
1564,1,8,Straight out of the box on automatic settings it takes great pictures.,-1,0
1564,1,9,A not-too-critical family member recognized the improved picture quality right away.Purchasing the optional electronic viewfinder is a MUST (at $275 it is not cheap) but is really excellent.,-1,0
1564,1,10,The LCD is no good outdoors.,-1,0
1564,1,11,I am happy to forego the DSLR mirror view.,-1,0
1564,1,12,The LCD cannot be tilted but the EVF can be rotated to 90 degrees to make it easire to take low down flower pictures.It usually takes me at least a year to get completely familiar with a new camera and I expect the EPL-2 will be the same, especially as the menu options are complicated and the manual is difficult to parse.,-1,1
1564,1,13,I am waiting for "EPL-2 for Dummies" to be published.,-1,1
1564,1,14,Meanwhile I will enjoy the great pictures using mainly automatic settings but will dock my rating a star for excessively complicated menus and a poor manual.,-1,0
1564,1,15,By the way,I bought the 40-150 lens as well as the 14-42 kit lens in a package offered by Amazon.,-1,0
1564,1,16,It weighs only 8 ounces and is probably the only lens you will need most of the time.,-1,0
1565,1,0,Olympus PEN E-PL2.,-1,0
1565,1,1,I love this camera.,-1,0
1565,1,2,The wife didn't want a large DSLR and I was tired of being limited by small pocket digital cameras.,-1,0
1565,1,3,Now I have a camera my wife and I both enjoy, small size but versatile.,-1,0
1566,1,0,Great camera, awesome features.,-1,0
1566,1,1,I have had this camera for a couple of months now.,-1,0
1566,1,2,It has taken some time to learn the best settings for the right shooting situations.,-1,0
1566,1,3,There is an option to have user controlled settings pre-set into the different shooting modes.,-1,0
1566,1,4,The iAuto does an okay job in bright light and still shots, but you really need to learn the settings to optimize photos for action and low-light.,-1,0
1566,1,5,The camera is fast, looks nice (a bit retro in the front), and has a large, high resolution screen that is easy to see in all but the brightest sun.Tip: read the details of the user guide and also some internet research for optimizing the settings, it makes a huge difference in photo quality.,-1,0
1567,1,0,LOVE IT! Very easy to use, the filters are great, the controls are easy to use and the quality of the photos is great.,-1,0
1567,1,1,Just what I wanted for the additional controls without the bulk.,-1,0
1568,1,0,Very good choice.,-1,0
1568,1,1,I bought this camera to use with a C/Y lens adapter, andam pleasantly surprised with how good and versatile acamera it is...,-1,0
1569,1,0,Everything I expected.,-1,1
1569,1,1,Nice purchase for me.,-1,1
1569,1,2,I've purchased the lens adapter for my Canon EF lenses.,-1,1
1569,1,3,If I figure it out I'll post some of my pics.,-1,1
1569,1,4,Haven't used the kit lens much actually.,-1,1
1569,1,5,But I'm very happy with the resolution of the pictures I've taken so far.,-1,1
1570,1,0,My new Olympus Pen E-PL2.,-1,1
1570,1,1,I've been interested in a mirroless camera since they were introduced,but since I already own a Dslr camera I question the price of these smaller camera with a smaller sensor.,-1,1
1570,1,2,Now that the prices are dropping on some of the slightly older models; I felt like I could justify the cost of owning another camera.,-1,1
1570,1,3,I compared several brands and finally settled on the Olympus Pen E-Pl2.,-1,1
1570,1,4,I love it.,-1,0
1570,1,5,This camera is light and easy to carry when I don't want to lug around my larger camera.,-1,0
1570,1,6,The menus are easy to use, takes excellent pictures and handles very well.,-1,0
1570,1,7,I've purchased an electronic viewfinder and a longer zoom lens and I am very pleased.,-1,0
1570,1,8,I don't have any negatives and would highly recommend to anyone with a little photo knowlege and enjoys taking good photographs.,-1,0
1571,1,0,I held off buying serious digital camera until I felt they were good enough to equal or surpass 35mm film.,-1,1
1571,1,1,I had a couple small sensor SLRs and pretty soon ended up with a D700 for low light and a 5DII for everything else.,-1,1
1571,1,2,I never thought I could put up with the size and weight of these monsters but when I look at the images, man, its worth it.,-1,1
1571,1,3,Of course I still needed a pocket camera and through various Canons, Lumixes and Ricoh GRDs, I learned to live with the image quality in exchange for the small size.,-1,1
1571,1,4,But what if I could have both--a small, lightweight camera that produced images that were first rate in any situation and not too noticeably lower in quality than what my SLRs produce.,-1,1
1571,1,5,Well, not yet, I'm afraid.The new Pens and m4/3 in general have a lot going for them, both for the user who gets access to interchangeable lenses and the manufacturer who gets to sell interchangeable lenses.,-1,1
1571,1,6,My first impression of the photos was very positive but when I looked closer I saw very oversharpened jpegs (white line or halo around all edges) and with the sharpening turned down or with RAW, things looked a bit flat and soft.,-1,1
1571,1,7,Not terrible by any means and with Olympus' very punchy colors a casual user would probably be delighted.,-1,1
1571,1,8,The next step was to try a lens other than the kit lens.,-1,0
1571,1,9,I tried the Olympus 9-18 and the Panasonic 20mm.,-1,0
1571,1,10,The 9-18 was a little worse than the kit lens (but lots of fun) and the 20mm was a little better.,-1,0
1571,1,11,But still, the images still looked very similar to what I got from my tiny LX5.,-1,0
1571,1,12,Pretty good but not great.,-1,0
1571,1,13,Less noise with the Pen, of course, but still a lack of fine detail.,-1,0
1571,1,14,This is a subtle thing because you are literally looking for what isn't there but the fact remains.,-1,0
1571,1,15,Other Olympus models or Lumix m4/3 cameras may do better if they have a lighter anti-aliasing filter, which I have found really does make a big difference but that's another topic.I don't usually do these pros and cons but since they are so pronounced with this camera, I think it makes sense:Good:  Size, weight, price, ease of use, versatility, built-in stabilization, extensive menus with clear nomenclature, built-in flash with high elevation, kit lens is pretty sharp at 14mm end, extremely punchy color (if you like this), tons of lens options.Not so good:  Image quality a little better than much smaller cameras, LCD not visible with sun behind you, short battery life, fairly frequent difficulty focusing (or just slow), use of old lenses sounds like fun but in practice is rather awkward and they don't always perform that well (Olympus has a good explanation for this on their site).,-1,0
1571,1,16,If you accumulate enough lenses, add the electronic finder, etc, you have pretty much built a small SLR outfit--not a bad thing, but you're taking a long route to get there.So, if your current camera is an Elph, an LX3/LX5, Ricoh GR, S95, etc, run, do not walk to get a micro 4/3 camera.,-1,1
1571,1,17,You will see a definite increase in photo quality especially in low light.,-1,0
1571,1,18,If you have a lot of old lenses and like to experiment this is a fantastic, low-cost way to do so.,-1,0
1571,1,19,(Just $20 for an adapter!),-1,0
1571,1,20,However, if your regular camera is a D90 or a 7D, let alone a full frame camera, be aware that you'll be giving up a lot in exchange for a m4/3 camera.,-1,0
1571,1,21,I know, everything looks great at 72dpi and with all the interest these cameras will certainly improve (more expensive ones are probably better right now).,-1,0
1572,1,0,Great intro camera.,-1,0
1572,1,1,This is my first dslr camera and it's been great so far.,-1,0
1572,1,2,Coming from a point and shoot world, I wanted something I could keep close without a huge bag but that could take better pictures.So far, I've mostly been using point and shoot mode.,-1,1
1572,1,3,And the image quality is orders of magnitude better than my old camera.,-1,1
1572,1,4,Add in the shutter speed that actually takes a picture when you push the button instead of having a delay...and I couldn't go back.I've only brushed the surface of all I can do with this camera.,-1,1
1572,1,5,But their are a ton of settings--everything I need to start off in the world of dslr.,-1,1
1573,1,0,E-PL2 experience.,-1,0
1573,1,1,Although I have not used this camera for long, i really enjoyed the time I had with it.,-1,0
1573,1,2,The screen is very nice and large but does not look very good in low light situations (which I think is common for LCDs).,-1,0
1573,1,3,The autofocus is pretty snappy in most conditions but may become a problem in low light.,-1,0
1573,1,4,I feel that if they included a autofocus assist lamp, this issue would have been solved.,-1,0
1573,1,5,Pushing the ISO up until around 1600 should give you clean shots and the IBIS is a great thing to have especially with primes which normally do not have IS.,-1,0
1573,1,6,Body feels very sturdy and not like cheap plastic which I thought it would have felt like by the pictures of the camera.,-1,0
1573,1,7,Overall great camera, not the smallest micro43 camera but the grip is very nice and the design is very good.,-1,0
1574,1,0,I love it.,-1,0
1574,1,1,I 'm not a professional but It shoot very clear and clean pictures.,-1,0
1574,1,2,That 's mean the color is real and nice.,-1,0
1575,1,0,A bit outdated at this point but still good.,-1,1
1575,1,1,I purchased this back in summer 2011 and it's been nothing but good to me.,-1,1
1575,1,2,I got the white body because I suppose I'm a hipster like that (or whatever the kids are calling it).,-1,1
1575,1,3,In the two years it's certainly taken a beating but it's kind of like the Energizer bunny as it just keeps going and going.,-1,1
1575,1,4,The finish has a few nicks and scratches at this point but the camera is aging well.,-1,1
1575,1,5,I still use it frequently but it's taken a backseat regarding use as I now use Nikon SLRs for most of my photography.,-1,1
1575,1,6,Now I mostly use this as a sort of party camera where I set it to jpg only in aperture priority and auto-ISO and use the grainy b&w; filter.,-1,1
1575,1,7,It's quite fantastic in that capacity.,-1,1
1575,1,8,The kit lens never got a lot of use so I can't really comment on it but it still looks good.,-1,1
1575,1,9,Overall I'm very pleased but at this point you should probably get something newer.,-1,1
1576,1,0,Great camera Great price!,-1,0
1576,1,1,Tried for a while and really like the image quality of it.,-1,0
1576,1,2,The size is slightly larger and a bit heavier than what I had expected.,-1,0
1576,1,3,But overall I'm very happy with it.,-1,0
1577,1,0,Awesome Camera.,-1,0
1577,1,1,I recently purchased the Olympus PEN E-PL2 and am absolutely amazed at the quality of pictures.,-1,0
1577,1,2,Before purchasing this camera, I did a great deal of research.,-1,0
1577,1,3,And decided to go with the 4/3rd's micro option.,-1,0
1577,1,4,I'm still learning all the features, but am in love with this camera.,-1,0
1577,1,5,I'll definitely be buying additional lenses.,-1,0
1578,1,0,perfect machine.,-1,0
1578,1,1,İt is small enough and you can take very very good photos.,-1,0
1578,1,2,I advise a zoom lens with it.,-1,0
1579,1,0,I upgraded from a point and shoot and I'm very happy that I did.,-1,0
1579,1,1,This camera is really easy to use and takes great pictures.,-1,0
1580,1,0,Great CSC camera with amazing features.,-1,0
1580,1,1,I just bought this camera after all the reviews that I read about it.,-1,0
1580,1,2,I love the ART filters that they have.,-1,0
1581,1,0,small, but heavy.,-1,1
1581,1,1,Size: It is not that small, but not that big.,-1,1
1581,1,2,It is not a pocket camera to carry with, yet it is kind of small in your hand for a good grip.Focus: It will get the focus, but slow for my taste.Lens: The kid lens tend to be too warm and mask a yellowish to the images.battery: is good, it hold a charge for months in storage and last the whole day on a typical use.Video: I like it a lot.,-1,1
1581,1,3,I would say, it does video better than still picture.,-1,1
1582,1,0,Out of the box functionality is great!!,-1,0
1582,1,1,A little too much in the way of your thumb when holding the camera for a shot...I accidentally keep pushing buttons I'm not supposed to.,-1,0
1582,1,2,It's light, comfortable and takes fantastic pics!!,-1,0
1583,1,0,Great Camera.,-1,0
1583,1,1,It is just want I wanted !! The system really works well for my needs and the quality is top of  the game !! Amazon did what it said they promised keep it up .,-1,0
1584,1,0,Worth the money.,-1,1
1584,1,1,I wanted something more than a point and shoot camera but not a DSLR (I never had the knack to learn the nitty-gritties of photography and I did not want to carry around a big camera).,-1,1
1584,1,2,Hence went for a Olympus PEN EPL2.,-1,1
1584,1,3,This works like a charm.,-1,1
1584,1,4,I mostly use the Automode or one of the Scene options.,-1,1
1584,1,5,The picture quality is amazing.,-1,0
1584,1,6,I am quite happy with the results.,-1,0
1584,1,7,Though I believe the pictures in low light could be a bit better in Automode.,-1,0
1584,1,8,I would definitely recommend this camera to others.,-1,0
1585,1,0,Nice image quality, but quirky.,-1,0
1585,1,1,I read roughly a million reviews and looked at a broad range of cameras before purchasing this a few months ago.,-1,0
1585,1,2,I was looking to move up from a Lumix TZ1 which while fabulous for what it is, is quite old (at 7 years) and does not have high megapixel count or manual features.,-1,0
1585,1,3,I was looking for a tough combination of high image quality, a good macro and good zoom in a relatively inexpensive camera.My primary use for this is shooting art glass, a tough subject to capture well.I chose the Pl2 primarily because of its image quality.,-1,0
1585,1,4,The in-camera noise-reduction and availability of a mount which allows me to use my Minolta SLR RainbowImaging Minolta MD MC Mount Lens to Micro 4/3 Four Thirds System Camera Mount Adapter, Olympus PEN E-P1 E-P2, Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1, GH1, G1, MSRP USD24.99 is ultimately what sealed my decision.I find the camera easy to use in auto mode, and versatile in terms of options for manual control as well as special effects.,-1,1
1585,1,5,i think if I had the option of playing with it for a few weeks before purchase I would have opted for something else (though not all of the issues became apparent immediately).,-1,1
1585,1,6,Count on missing a lot of shots.,-1,1
1585,1,7,Had I not purchased this primarily for shots of stationary objects I would have returned it immediately.1.,-1,1
1585,1,8,This one is obvious out of the box: lag!,-1,1
1585,1,9,It takes longer for t5he shutter to reset than any camera I have ever owned, by a wide margin.,-1,1
1585,1,10,The shutter is also LOUD!,-1,1
1585,1,11,I actually find it cute in a nostalgic way, but it is not altogether a good thing.I hadn't considered the draw-backs of 9 focal points (most current cameras have a lot more) until i tried to take a picture of a flower in my garden, and... literally could not get it to focus on the flower!,-1,1
1585,1,12,The lighting was challenging because of the time of day, but... no matter how I moved, or moved the camera I could not get the flower in one of the focal points.,-1,1
1585,1,13,I have never had this issue with any camera I have used before, from cheap Poleroids to high end slrs, and many in between.My biggest issue (and I still have not figured out what went wrong) is it's losing pictures.I took it on vacation shortly after purchasing it, a trip where I went to visit family and then went on to a class.,-1,1
1585,1,14,On the first leg of my trip all of the pictures I had shot the prior week just disappeared.,-1,1
1585,1,15,I reluctantly reformatted the card, set up day, date... (which I had not done previously) and managed to get a handful of shots before I left.,-1,1
1585,1,16,The following day I spent at a museum, taking dozens of photos.,-1,1
1585,1,17,The following day they were all gone.,-1,1
1585,1,18,I weighed reformatting and losing whatever might still be on the card vs. not having it for class, and reluctantly reformatted again.,-1,1
1585,1,19,Over the course of the next week I shot hundreds of photos and some video, and once again it all disappeared :(  Not knowing whether the the problem was the camera or the card I hastily tried to replace lost shots on my last day, and to my surprise, they were all there when I got home (but were rushed and pretty awful photos).,-1,1
1585,1,20,It did, however, give me a chance to try the editing software it is packaged with, which is the best I have seen yet (in terms of software which ships with a camera), and which enabled me to save some of those awful shots ;)  Several months later, I have not had those issues again (the disappearing photos) and do not know what caused it, BUT still would have gotten something else just because of issues focusing where I want to.,-1,1
1585,1,21,I have an inexpensive Lumix Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP3 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch Touch-Screen LCD (Dark Blue) which allows me to focus via touchscreen, and which, in my experience, never misses.,-1,1
1585,1,22,Why is it so difficult to find a focal point on this camera?The software it ships with is terrific!,-1,1
1585,1,23,It likely provides enough control in terms of editing that most people would not need or want a more complicated package (like photo shop).,-1,1
1585,1,24,It also makes downloading, uploading, labeling a breeze!I also like that they included extensive documentation, 2 print manuals and one on disk.I am still thinking about swapping this out.,-1,1
1585,1,25,At this point it is nearly new but past the point where I can return it.,-1,1
1585,1,26,I am however, considering selling and replacing it as I am not only dissatisfied with it as an all around camera, but I am not sure it is adequate for the 1 simple thing I purchased it for (stationary art photos).,-1,1
1585,1,27,I am very glad I purchased this an an auxiliary, and still have 3 Lumix cameras close at hand.,-1,1
1586,1,0,One small problem ... This is not the item I thought I was getting.,-1,1
1586,1,1,The item was advertised as the E-PL2—the second generation of this particular camera, with improvements and adjustments from the good-but-needed-improvement E-PL1.Unfortunately, the camera is, in fact, the E-PL1.Please be more careful and accurate in your labeling of the products you are posting for sale.,-1,1
1587,1,0,I own two now and works nice.,-1,0
1587,1,1,Yes their are beter cameras, but this works well for me.,-1,0
1587,1,2,A work horse for time-lapse as raw files not so big but can get sharp images from unit.,-1,0
1587,1,3,Guess I'm use to using this camera and holding out for the next wave of mirrorless to step up.,-1,0
1587,1,4,But these are great for fun and cheap $$$, good quality images and unit/glass.,-1,0
1588,1,0,It's good for me.,-1,0
1588,1,1,It's easy to use and light althoug I don't try all of functions so far.,-1,0
1588,1,2,Further, the price is suitable for me.,-1,0
1589,1,0,Very Happy.,-1,0
1589,1,1,I bought this as an upgrade for a point n shoot camera.,-1,1
1589,1,2,I'm not anything near a professorial photographer.,-1,1
1589,1,3,I do, however take tons of photos.I've had this camera for a little over a month now (I've taken hundreds of pics with it already).,-1,0
1589,1,4,It was a long road getting to this purchase- weeks of research, I even bought a $200 point n shoot camera that I was simply unimpressed with... the pictures were no better than my $80 camera that I wanted to upgrade from.,-1,0
1589,1,5,At first, I found the 'body only' version, but seeing as I know nothing about lenses, I sought out the kit instead.I'm very happy with the camera and the pictures it takes.,-1,0
1589,1,6,The basic settings are intuitive and easy to use once you've discovered them.,-1,0
1589,1,7,I haven't noticed any artifacts from pictures that were taken in less than ideal lighting (and then brightened on my computer), which was my biggest problem with the old camera.The included lens covers an acceptable range for my needs.,-1,1
1589,1,8,If you want to take pictures further than 20 feet away from a subject, you may want another lens.,-1,1
1589,1,9,Also, you may want another lens for macro photography (the included lens does ok up to a point, but you may have trouble getting pictures of makers marks in jewelry, for example).Good news is that macro attachments are available pretty cheap.,-1,1
1589,1,10,Zoom lenses on the other hand, not so much, but there are adapters that let you use many brands of lenses (you lose the auto focus, though) I've been looking for an inexpensive, clean looking lens to show up at my local second hand store, but no luck yet.The LCD does leave something to be desired, but they sell an eyepiece that is supposed to remedy that... it's kinda pricey, so I don't have one just yet.,-1,1
1589,1,11,The built in screen is ok, but you miss a lot of fine detail, such as background blur, which, if you were trying to take amazing photos, you'd want to see clearly.,-1,0
1589,1,12,Without it, you just have to hope that the focus is where it says it is/where you want it, and that the blur is right.. or take several pictures.,-1,0
1589,1,13,It's not like you're wasting film.So the screen isn't amazing.,-1,0
1589,1,14,This is really my biggest gripe, but I don't think it comes down to the quality of the screen, it's more the size, and they couldn't have put a much bigger screen on the camera, so there you go.I recommend getting a screen protector right away.,-1,0
1589,1,15,The screen is protected by plastic, and I've heard it can scratch pretty easily.,-1,0
1590,1,0,Fantastic.,-1,0
1590,1,1,Finally a 4/3 w/great skin tones and hi LCD.,-1,0
1590,1,2,Finally a 4/3 camera with great skin tones and a high definition LCD.,-1,0
1590,1,3,With the 1.4 meg viewfinder, you have the complete package.,-1,0
1590,1,4,We took some pictures with this camera at CES and the results were great.,-1,1
1590,1,5,Much better than the E-PL1 cause its screen allows you to evaluate if the picture is in focus, etc.,-1,1
1590,1,6,And the skin tones are from Olympus so they are great, unlike the Panasonic inferior skin tones and jpegs, the Oly engine is great for jpegs.,-1,0
1590,1,7,Pictures I took were hi ISO indoors with no flash and they came great.,-1,0
1590,1,8,I liked the black model and the silver model the same.,-1,0
1590,1,9,The new kit lens is compact.,-1,0
1590,1,10,A real winner.,-1,0
1590,1,11,Works great with the Panasonic 20mm lens.,-1,0
1591,1,0,Perfect.,-1,0
1591,1,1,Everything I expected!,-1,0
1591,1,2,Shipped in a very timely manner.,-1,0
1591,1,3,Works great.,-1,0
1591,1,4,New low price was wonderful.,-1,0
1591,1,5,Purchased with $100 gift card.,-1,0
1591,1,6,Only ninety bucks out of pocket.,-1,0
1591,1,7,Using it with 50mm 1.8 canon fd lens.,-1,0
1592,1,0,Style Meets Quality.,-1,0
1592,1,1,One of the latest micro 4/3 in the market right now.,-1,0
1592,1,2,Internal stabilizer with F1.7/20mm Panasonic lens capture good night shots!,-1,0
1593,1,0,buttons position are "major design flaws" i got mine about a month ago, the picture qualities are quite acceptable but i have been bothered by a VERY MAJOR DESIGN FLAW which i wish to disclose here on amazon.com to all you users.,-1,1
1593,1,1,If the camera is front facing, you are hard pressed to hold it and grab it without hitting accidentally the "video" button, or some of the other buttons such as exposures +/- buttons for increased / decreased exposures.,-1,1
1593,1,2,I have on a number of occasions hit these and then the video is running without my knowing, or that some exposures are "messed up".,-1,1
1593,1,3,Perhaps with a view to "save space" so the camera can be small, they have been very tight with spaces, and i do not particularly have lard hands, in fact , i think my hands are regular to small size.,-1,0
1593,1,4,i also have used SLR's and also small mini cameras.,-1,0
1593,1,5,Hence i want you all to be very careful and do some shooting at store first before you decide on getting one.,-1,1
1594,1,0,I used my camera to take pictures at meetings.,-1,1
1594,1,1,It had a boring life, and a remarkably short one, too.,-1,1
1594,1,2,When a plastic ring in the lens got dislodged, making it impossible to extend, I sent it to Olympus for a repair.,-1,1
1594,1,3,They found "evidence of extensive impact damage" and said it was not economically practical to repair the item.,-1,1
1594,1,4,I had owned the camera much less than a year.,-1,1
1594,1,5,But they offered 20% off a new Olympus lens.,-1,0
1594,1,6,But never another Olympus ever again.,-1,0
1594,1,7,I'm so disappointed in this company.,-1,1
1595,1,0,Great, but.,-1,1
1595,1,1,JPEG IQ is great, but high ISO is mediocre, sensor is old vs. rival mirrorless cameras, auto focus is fast enough but lack focus assist in low light, which is near useless with moving objects or people in low light.,-1,1
1596,1,0,Great Purchase.,-1,0
1596,1,1,The camera arrived on time.,-1,0
1596,1,2,I was extremely impressed.,-1,0
1596,1,3,Have yet to use the product, but am looking forward to using on my trip to Portugal.,-1,0
1597,1,0,THIS IS A VERY GOOD CAMERA!!!! Salaam Aleikum, Long live the Iranian Islamic Empire (IIA) and Iranian Republic!!  Baai'st ta veen, has lai 'aideen.,-1,1
1597,1,1,Haastavariohn haalaaveen!This camera is very close to a DSLR.,-1,1
1597,1,2,It has a micro 4/3rds sensor which is smaller than the size of an APS-C/APS-H that is found in DSLRs and bigger than the sensors in digital cameras.,-1,1
1597,1,3,While some men say it's possible to get excellent photos with cell-phone cameras and digital cameras that have a 1/2.3",-1,1
1597,1,4,sensor, this is in fact untrue.,-1,1
1597,1,5,One can indeed get similar results from those cameras but the amount of time and labour required is much greater (post-processing, optimal lighting, optimal subject, etc.).,-1,1
1597,1,6,However, a very basic DSLR costs about 200 dollars more than this Olympus camera.,-1,1
1597,1,7,And so how is this camera alike and unlike a DSLR?,-1,1
1597,1,8,List:Like a DSLR:  Changeable lenses, reasonable size sensor,  good kit lens, lot of options, takes photos in succession quite rapidly (almost 1 every second, which is very slow compared to DSLRs but faster than most digital cameras),  one can control shutter speed, aperture, ISO.Not like a DSLR.,-1,1
1597,1,9,Note that a difference doesn't always mean it's negative:  As mentioned, the frame rate for taking pictures is much slower than a DSLR.,-1,1
1597,1,10,One medium-level problem with this camera is that it doesn't come with a viewfinder.,-1,1
1597,1,11,The body is much lighter and smaller than a DSLR but very well made, good quality.,-1,0
1597,1,12,The lenses are much smaller but again good quality.,-1,0
1597,1,13,And of course the most important difference is the image quality.,-1,0
1597,1,14,The images from a cheap DSLR are usually 85% of a professionally shot image that used an expensive DSLR camera ($1250).,-1,0
1597,1,15,This Olympus camera gives about a 90% quality image compared to a cheap DSLR, meaning about 80% quality compared to an expensive DSLR.,-1,0
1597,1,16,For men who want to take DSLR photos every time they press the shutter, an entry-level DSLR is better.,-1,1
1597,1,17,However, this will get good very good results 5 out of 6 times and for the layman who needs a much better camera than his $150 digital camera, this is very acceptable.Overall an EXCELLENT camera for the price!!!!!,-1,1
1598,1,0,Great camera but...,-1,0
1598,1,1,I bought an EPL-2 for my trip to Nepal this summer.Pros:Small and lightweightDetachable lensesOk pictures (jpeg, haven't tried raw)ConsToo many menus/ hard to navigateNo viewfinderLenses are expensive,-1,0
1599,1,0,Very Poor Autofocus Performance.,-1,1
1599,1,1,Let me start this by saying that I've owned digital cameras since 2000 - 2 Sonys, a Nikon, a Canon G9, the first Rebel, and a 20D.,-1,1
1599,1,2,I've photographed weddings, charity events, and have been paid for my work, so I know how to use a camera.,-1,1
1599,1,3,Never before I have owned a camera so frustrating to get a picture in focus.,-1,1
1599,1,4,I've read the manual for this camera and understand how the contrast detection autofocus works, but the in-focus shots with the kit lens comprise no more than 40-50% of the pictures and video taken so far, no matter what mode it used.,-1,1
1599,1,5,Other digicams I've owned have been slow to autofocus, but if they couldn't lock on, they told you so.,-1,1
1599,1,6,The E-PL2 is a liar, promising that the AF has locked on, but more often than not it's focusing on the background.,-1,1
1599,1,7,The shallower depth of field from the larger sensor makes the problem worse.,-1,0
1599,1,8,Unfortunately, without any kind of viewfinder, I don't see any fix for this.While the camera feels very nice in the hand, be aware that cheap materials have been used to build the camera to a price point.,-1,0
1599,1,9,The rear LCD screen has a cover that is plastic, not glass, and it scratches if you so much as look at it too hard.,-1,1
1599,1,10,I've had 2 other cameras with a similar cover design - but they both used glass and survived years of use without a scratch.,-1,1
1599,1,11,It does not bode well for this camera's long-term durability.The positives of this camera come from that larger sensor - it has low-light capabilities for still pictures and video that far exceed other digital cameras, and when the focus does work you can produce a nicely defocused background to highlight the subject.,-1,1
1599,1,12,It comes with better-than-average software to process RAW images, and there is a nice ecosystem of accessories and small, light lenses that take full advantage of the Micro 4/3 format.Perhaps my kit lens is defective since other reviews are so positive, I don't know.,-1,1
1599,1,13,Just make sure your retailer has a generous return policy.,-1,1
1600,1,0,Haven't tried the camera yet, but the recharger is HUGE.,-1,1
1600,1,1,The recharger is the 'old'fashoned type, with a large mains cable attached to it.,-1,1
1600,1,2,For home use, this isn't an issue, but when travelling, it's just one extra thing you have to carry.,-1,1
1600,1,3,All my cannon chargers plug directly into the socket.,-1,1
1600,1,4,Come on Olympus - stop shipping 90's stype rechargers,-1,1
1601,1,0,Not as good as I hoped.,-1,1
1601,1,1,I bought the E-PL2 kit with both the 14-42mm & 40-150mm Lens.,-1,1
1601,1,2,No problems with zoom, noise, or focusing.,-1,1
1601,1,3,I don't have a lot of experience with removable lens cameras, but the lens seem very high quality and easy to use.,-1,1
1601,1,4,I have been using the camera for about two days in all different conditions.If you are capable and willing to adjust and optimize settings for certain photographic situations, then this camera will be fine.,-1,1
1601,1,5,If you intend to share the camera with your wife that expects good indoor pictures in iAuto mode, then pass.,-1,1
1601,1,6,The quality and color tone of the pictures in iAuto mode did not please my wife and I.  Using iAuto mode indoors with overhead lighting without the flash we found that pictures had a distinct yellowish-beige hue.,-1,1
1601,1,7,With the flash tuned on the colors were better but a bit washed out.,-1,1
1601,1,8,In movie mode, there is no flash, and the indoor movies always had a yellowish-beige hue to them.,-1,1
1601,1,9,Some of the advanced settings corrected this problem a little, but my wife did not want a camera that required setting adjustment in iAuto mode, and we take a lot of indoor pictures.,-1,1
1601,1,10,Simply put it was difficult to render true white colors with this camera in an indoor atmosphere with moderate lighting conditions.In natural outdoor lighting the pictures are excellent.I question why people think Olympus JPEGs are so good.,-1,0
1601,1,11,The JPEGs do not accurately represent colors in many conditions, especially moderate to low light.,-1,0
1601,1,12,There may be some conditions where the Olympus JPEG "processing adjustments" works, but sometimes it makes pictures worse.,-1,0
1601,1,13,It seems like Olympus is too often trying to "process and enhance" the JPEG instead of just rendering the RAW file with JPEG compression.I am still looking for the perfect, small, DSRL quality camera.,-1,0
1601,1,14,I do believe Micro Four Thirds is the future.Update:The "warm" look of the Olympus images are just too yellowish for me.,-1,0
1601,1,15,Its a preference I guess.,-1,1
1601,1,16,Check out this thread, its exactly what I have experienced with the E-PL2 and has sample images to show.,-1,1
1602,1,0,pretty much average.,-1,1
1602,1,1,I won't repeat what others have said but wanted to point out a few issues that I've had with my camera.The monitor screen got scratched on mine during normal use.,-1,1
1602,1,2,I've never scratched a screen on any of my digital cameras or cell phones before.,-1,1
1602,1,3,This camera was brand new and stored in a a brand new camera case when it wasn't being used.,-1,1
1602,1,4,The monitor screen ended up with a bunch of tiny scratches during normal use during the first few weeks I owned it and brought it on vacation.,-1,1
1602,1,5,It shouldn't be possible to make tiny scratches as the screen should be hardened to the extent where only a major impact puts a scratch on it, and that would create a deep scratch- not a bunch of tiny ones that are more indicative of the plastic just being too soft.In my situation, I realized that the screen was just too soft- likely defective.,-1,1
1602,1,6,The screen obviously sticks out and rubs against your shirt when it's being used and it needs to be able to rub against things like shirt buttons.,-1,1
1602,1,7,They designed it so that the screen is the outermost part of the camera back- so it will always be resting against something when in the case of hung from the neck strap.Anyway, Olympus failed to honor the warranty on the screen despite the fact that it was defective and became scratched way too easily during normal use.,-1,1
1602,1,8,They don't even allow for two-way communication with their warranty process.,-1,1
1602,1,9,They simply state that the camera needs to be sent in and they'll make their own determination as to whether it's a covered repaired.,-1,1
1602,1,10,It's interesting to note that the only way to make that determination would have been to contact me and ask me how I used the camera in order to determine how the scratches got there.,-1,1
1602,1,11,They never contacted me other than to send a repair estimate without explanation.,-1,1
1602,1,12,They aren't interested in customer feedback at all.The second item has to do with the fact that the movie button is located on the back right side of the camera right near where your thumb normally goes when gripping the camera.,-1,1
1602,1,13,This creates a situation where the button gets inadvertantly pressed on occassion.,-1,1
1602,1,14,You really have to be careful to not to accidently press it during normal use.,-1,1
1602,1,15,It especially happens because the camera normally gets pressed against your thumb during normal holding of the camera- the weight of the camera pulls it downward and to the left, and your thumb naturally prevents the camera from falling out of your grip.,-1,1
1602,1,16,So despite being careful with the movie button, it is still way to easy to accidently press it.,-1,1
1602,1,17,I can't believe they didn't figure this out during testing.The photos are nothing special and the placement of the movie button really makes it a hassle to quickly a picture.,-1,1
1602,1,18,The poor customer service from Olympus ensures that I'll never buy from them again.,-1,1
1603,1,0,Dead after 5 months.,-1,1
1603,1,1,We bought the red version of this & this same review is posted there-wanted to make sure we warn as many people as possible.We purchased the EPL-2 at the end of February 2011 as it was coming out (it arrived beginning of March).,-1,1
1603,1,2,We were so excited to try the Digital/SLR camera and take some great photos of our two little boys.,-1,1
1603,1,3,Outside in sunlight the images are outstanding-amazing quality and the F-focus allows you to blur the background which makes for some frame-worthy art.,-1,1
1603,1,4,Inside, the pictures are about the same quality as a $100 digital camera-nothing special.Our biggest problem came a week ago.,-1,1
1603,1,5,The blue light turned on when we pushed the 'ON/OFF' switch, but there was no picture in the viewfinder & it wouldn't take pictures.,-1,1
1603,1,6,We troubleshot all possible problems (remove the memory card, battery, lens, screen turned off, etc), but nothing helped.,-1,1
1603,1,7,Called Olympus support (1 year warranty) and they said we'd have to mail it in (at OUR cost) and it would take about 3 weeks to repair!!,-1,1
1603,1,8,We leave for a long awaited family vacation to Disneyland this Saturday and will have NO camera to record the memories!!,-1,1
1603,1,9,Even vacation aside, 3 weeks with no camera and little kids is horrible!,-1,1
1603,1,10,We're missing so many moments.I called Olympus support & they offered no resolution to this problem-no loaner camera, etc.,-1,1
1603,1,11,I am SO angry with Olympus.,-1,1
1603,1,12,Do NOT buy their products unless you want to be disappointed.Update:,-1,1
1603,1,13,It has been over four weeks and still no camera.,-1,1
1603,1,14,Everytime we call customer support they offer a new 'estimated arrival date'.,-1,1
1603,1,15,I have asked to pay for overnight shipping when they finally get around to fixing it and all I get is a, "regrettably no." HORRIBLE customer service.Update: The camera was returned after 7.5 weeks and has been working fine since.,-1,1
1603,1,16,On one phone call they mentioned they had had to reduce their repair operations to a single location-thus the delay.,-1,1
1603,1,17,That coupled with the accounting fraud makes me feel a bit sorry for them.,-1,1
1603,1,18,It's a shame really, since we like the camera, definitely takes nice photos without any serious training needed, a sort of "dummy", lightweight camera for people who want nice photos.,-1,0
1604,1,0,I had high expectations.,-1,1
1604,1,1,samples[...]remove the starsLet me start by saying that I would not trade my P2 for any Panasonic micro 4/3 camera including the new GH2 (which I tried, hopping for a better all around camera than my P2.,-1,1

1604,1,10,I've had it for 4 days now and for the life of me I cannot make a difference in AF between pl2 and p2.,-1,0
1604,1,11,Maybe the fact that the lens is silent gives the feeling that is faster but, honestly, I cannot see it.2.,-1,1
1604,1,12,The kit lens.,-1,1
1604,1,13,I still cannot believe Olympus builds this kind of garbage (and I'm nice).,-1,1

1604,1,18,Yes, I knew before I bought it but I only realized how mandatory is ISO 100 when I started using the PL2.4.,-1,0
1604,1,19,ISO base for video 400?,-1,0
1604,1,20,This must be an Olympus joke.,-1,1
1604,1,21,Even ISO 200 on a P2 is a stretch, but 400?,-1,1
1604,1,22,One needs a ton of ND's to get the speed down to 1/30 outside.5.,-1,1
1604,1,23,Noise at base ISO.,-1,1
1604,1,24,The level of noise in dark areas at base iso is unreal.,-1,1
1604,1,25,And it's not the kit lens, I tried both cameras (p2 and pl2) with the Panasonic 20mm.,-1,1
1604,1,26,Before jumping up and down people should try shooting objects inside that have dark surfaces, like furniture.If I'd rate the Olympus P2 4 stars, I could not rate the PL2 more than 2 stars.,-1,1
1604,1,27,Maybe 3 if it comes down around $300, though the lower price doesn't make it a better camera, it's only the feeling that I didn't spend that much for a mediocre device.Again, you can call me anytime an Olympus fanboy, and I wouldn't mind, but the PL2 is not a keeper.,-1,1
1604,1,28,Take care!,-1,1

1606,1,1,The very first thing you will want to do upon setting up the camera is throw away the included strap.You are never going to get it attached to the camera.,-1,1
1606,1,2,If you have high blood pressure, the attempt could be deadly.I just got back from a safari in Africa with the epl2.,-1,1
1606,1,3,My results were spotty owing to the lack of a viewfinder.The camera is largely useless without one.,-1,1
1606,1,4,In even moderate sunlight you cannot see the screen.,-1,1
1606,1,5,Without glassesyou are completely out of luck.,-1,1
1606,1,6,There will be no composing and little hint of the final shot until you get intothe shade with your glasses on.,-1,1
1606,1,7,All you can do is point the camera in the general direction and hope for the best.The viewfinder is $240 bucks.,-1,1
1606,1,8,Put that into the purchase decision.I am also not convinced that I would ever use any of the various "art" settings as I do all of that sort of thing quickerand better on my computer.,-1,1
1606,1,9,I would trade all the bells and whistles for a proper viewfinder.,-1,1
1606,1,10,If you are a Mac user the offeredPenPal is not compatible.,-1,1

1608,1,0,Not such a star for those who shop around.,-1,1
1608,1,1,First off let me say this is still a okay camera, Its handling is nice, however as someone who had a Sony Nex 3 beforehand; there are some major points of contention that have to be said that the brand sheep here are oblivious to.1)Crop,-1,1
1608,1,2,Ultra wide angle?,-1,1
1608,1,3,Forget about it, its not happening with this tiny 2x crop sensor and is massively more constricting than the 1.5x crop factor APS-C cameras.2)low,-1,1
1608,1,4,light ISO performance.,-1,1
1608,1,5,Likely for the same reason as above; the low light performance and resolution suffer badly from the small sensor.,-1,1
1608,1,6,Strongly improved over the E-PL1 its still lacking next to the now old Sony Nex cameras.3)Price!,-1,1
1608,1,7,Micro 4/3rd cameras would definitely have a niche for around $400 and would revolutionize smaller sensor compact cameras.,-1,1
1608,1,8,As it is; it's squarely in Samsung, Sony Nikon and Canon entry enthusiast territory, all with bigger better sensors.4)Size,,-1,1
1608,1,9,it's not so small.,-1,1
1608,1,10,With the 16mm pancake lens my old Nex was a true pocket camera, not nearly so much as with the Olympus and its atrociously narrow frame pancake lens.Still I will be keeping this camera till I find another 1.5x sensor camera.,-1,1
1608,1,11,The hot shoe and design of the camera is nice, but honestly I hate Olympus for making this camera half frame just for higher profits and to 'honor' the old PEN cameras.,-1,1
1608,1,12,What a fool I was to run from a superior camera just because of a wonky menu system.,-1,1
1609,1,0,This item don't include memory card.,-1,1
1609,1,1,I couldn't find out that point when I checked this item details.,-1,1
1609,1,2,So today, I had to buy memory card which I could buy cheaper at amazon.com at UTCmall separately, because I need to take a pic tomorrow.,-1,1
1609,1,3,Anyway, please note this point when you ordeer this item.,-1,1
1610,1,0,Great Pocket Camera With A Little Tinkering.,-1,1
1610,1,1,It was probably a month or two ago that I saw some press releases on a new point and shoot Sony had coming out, the WX1, which intrigued me.,-1,1
1610,1,2,Like a lot of photo enthusiasts, while a DSLR is the weapon of choice, the elusive holy grail seems to be a small point and shoot camera that can slip in your pocket so you can be packing at all times, yet would still take good looking photos that are not so riddled with noise (a problem almost always plaguing point and shoots because of their small sensors) that they look like your tv screen when the test pattern has gone off.,-1,1
1610,1,3,As the old adage goes, the best camera is the one you have on you when you need it and a DSLR is a little tough to integrate into your daily accessories.So in evaluating this camera, perspective is required.,-1,1
1610,1,4,This is not the camera you would go to for your best work.,-1,1
1610,1,5,It is not the same package of everything you have with your DSLR and collection of lenses shrunk down to something the size of a couple of packs of gum.,-1,1
1610,1,6,It is a tiny point and shoot camera that easily slips into your pocket with room to spare that does way better than the average point and shoot.,-1,1
1610,1,7,In other words, it's a top performer for the junior varsity but its not ready to hang with the varsity.Here's the reasons I wanted one:1.,-1,1
1610,1,8,I wanted a small camera I could keep in my pocket for daily use.,-1,1
1610,1,9,What a lot of photographers call a "street shooter", something you can pull out and use to grab shots of whatever you happen to run into during your day.This camera is certainly small.,-1,1
1610,1,10,I've seen a few people refer to it as "chunky" and they must consider Ellen Page to be fat.,-1,1
1610,1,11,I was surprised at how small the box it came in was, and even more surprised when I found the camera in the small box.,-1,1
1610,1,12,My first impression was it wasn't much bigger than one of those old minolta spy cameras.,-1,1
1610,1,13,My previous point and shoot camera was the Sony W300, which most people considered slim and stylish, and this camera is smaller in all respects than that.,-1,1
1610,1,14,Side by side the WX1 seems slight smaller than the W300, but looking at it alone it looks like a tiny toy camera.,-1,1
1610,1,15,I gave the W300 to my wife, and when she caught a view of the WX1 her reaction was "But yours is so much smaller.",-1,1
1610,1,16,She was thrilled when I gave her the W300 but now has taken to calling it a hand me down.,-1,1
1610,1,17,As they say, size matters.2.,-1,1
1610,1,18,Stealth factor - I wanted a camera that I could sneak into places that don't allow cameras.You could drop this baby into the front pocket of your levis and still have room for a decent game of pocket pool.,-1,1
1610,1,19,I can easily get it, a wallet and even a cell phone all in the front pocket of my jeans.,-1,1
1610,1,20,Alone in the pocket, it scarcely makes even a bump that a security guard might notice.3.,-1,1
1610,1,21,Low light capabilities - I dislike using a flash and wanted something that could take good pictures in natural light, and could function well in dark places.The low light capabilities of this camera are astonishing.,-1,1
1610,1,22,The camera can basically see better in the dark then you can.,-1,1
1610,1,23,Lots of the pictures I took in dark rooms look way more illuminated in the photos then they were in reality.Because it seemed to be everything I had been searching for in a point and shoot, I went ahead and ordered this as soon as Amazon had them available.,-1,1
1610,1,24,Because they were not yet widely available, there were no hands on reviews by the usual photography sites and blogs.,-1,1
1610,1,25,While waiting to get the camera, I would check Amazon every day to see if anyone who had actually used the camera had put up any reviews yet.,-1,1
1610,1,26,The initial few reviews were alarming.,-1,1
1610,1,27,People who said they wanted to love the camera didn't.,-1,0
1610,1,28,The gist of their complaints seemed to be that the camera took good pictures in low light (although a few didn't even agree with that) and crappy pictures in good light.,-1,0
1610,1,29,Sample photos that people began posting on Flickr also didn't look too hot.,-1,0
1610,1,30,Because of this I regretted ordering the camera so quickly and almost just sent it back to Amazon without even opening the box.I decided to try it for myself before deciding whether to send it back, and found it to be much better than the initial reviews had painted it (and subsequent reviews on Amazon now seem to be swinging towards the positive).I do have to agree that a lot of the shots I've taken outdoors in bright sunlight seem a little overexposed and dull, but I've also had this problem with my Canon DSLRs when set on automatic.,-1,1
1610,1,31,In any case, I've found that with the WX1, all you have to do is open the photo in Photoshop and click "Auto Contrast" and the problem is instantly corrected.,-1,1
1610,1,32,A reviewer on Amazon has also noted that you can get more vivid, warm outdoors photos from the WX1 by using the Program mode and moving the White Balance setting from Auto to Flash.,-1,1
1610,1,33,I tried this, and with the White Balance set to Flash the pictures basically look the same out of the camera as they do after I've run them through Photoshop and hit Auto Contrast.,-1,1
1610,1,34,Another user mentioned in some of his posts that turning off the DRO in the menu greatly improves outdoor photos.The argument that most people just want nice looking snapshots right out of the camera and don't want to mess with Photoshop is valid, but those are probably not the people who are going to be interested in this camera anyway.,-1,0
1610,1,35,The camera's not cheap and those people would be very happy with the snapshots they could get with an inexpensive entry level point and shoot.In any event, after a couple of weeks with the camera, my recommendation for everyday daylight shots is not to use the Intelligent Auto mode, but rather put the camera in the "P" or program mode.,-1,0
1610,1,36,This will allow you to fix the ISO at 160, which is fine 90% of the time.,-1,1
1610,1,37,Decrease the EV setting by .07.,-1,1
1610,1,38,Most shots will now come out great.,-1,1
1610,1,39,If you want warmer colors put the white balance on Flash, or increase the saturation a little after the fact in Photoshop.,-1,1
1610,1,40,As noted above, turning off the DRO also seems to help.As for claims that the WX1 photos come out noisy, I don't agree.,-1,1
1610,1,41,Even the low light pictures don't seem to have a noise problem.,-1,1
1610,1,42,This is not to say they are DSLR quality, but they don't look bad at all for a point and shoot.Other positives:4.,-1,1
1610,1,43,A nice 24mm wide angle lens, which lets you get very close to things and is also great for cramped indoor settings, buildings and landscapes.,-1,1
1610,1,44,Speaking of getting close to things, the macro feature springs into gear automatically when you stick the camera within an inch or two of an object.5.,-1,1
1610,1,45,Fast on, little lag time between shots unless you're using the Burst, Panoramic, Anti-Blur or hand held Twilight modes which take a little time to process.6.,-1,1
1610,1,46,HD Video.,-1,1
1610,1,47,I never really use this but nice to have in case I ever catch the You Tube bug.7.,-1,1
1610,1,48,Panoramic mode.,-1,1
1610,1,49,In this mode simply press the shutter and sweep your arm and the camera creates a panorama all by itself.,-1,1
1610,1,50,You don't have to take a bunch of single shots and try to stitch them together later with a photo program.,-1,1
1610,1,51,The only drawback is that it sets the exposure for the area you start, which can make it difficult to get a good one in uneven lighting.8.,-1,1
1610,1,52,Battery life seems pretty good.So what's not to like about this camera?1.,-1,1
1610,1,53,No manual controls.The W300 had full manual controls, and I wonder why Sony couldn't have included them here and really made this a top of the line point and shoot.,-1,1
1610,1,54,Many serious amateur photographers who would otherwise love this camera won't even consider it because it doesn't allow them the ability to manually control aperture, shutter speed, etc.,-1,1
1610,1,55,This, along with the lack of RAW capabilities, will probably keep this camera from competing with the Panasonic LX3 and upcoming Canon S90.As note above, there is a limited work around.,-1,1
1610,1,56,Using the Program (as opposed to Automatic) Mode allows you to set the ISO between 160 and 3200, which will force the camera to use a slower or faster shutter speed.,-1,1
1610,1,57,You should note that if the DRO is on, you can't use a ISO higher than 800.,-1,1
1610,1,58,Turn it off if you want to go higher.,-1,1
1610,1,59,You can also put the camera in High ISO mode, which allows for faster shutter speed.Canon's soon to be released S90 seems to have become the great new hope for shutterbugs longing for a small point and shoot that takes great low light photos instead of the WX1, primarily because it not only also has a fast lens and improved sensor, but also manual controls and raw capabilities.2.,-1,0
1610,1,60,No viewfinder.I read somewhere this morning that 25% - soon to be a third - of the population are aging baby boomers.,-1,1
1610,1,61,If they're anything like me, they have a hard time reading a restaurant menu in dim light, or for that matter anything else a few feet from their face without reading glasses.,-1,1
1610,1,62,Translated to small point and shoot cameras, it's almost impossible for an older pair of eyes to clearly see what's on a 2.7 or 3 inch LCD screen on the back of camera, even if bright sun isn't washing out the screen.,-1,1
1610,1,63,Most of the time with the WX1 I really can't make out what's on the screen, because to me its all out of focus (the problem is my eyes, not the camera).,-1,1
1610,1,64,I just have to sort of aim the camera in the direction I want and estimate the framing and have faith.,-1,1
1610,1,65,The W300 had a viewfinder, which was why I bought it.,-1,1
1610,1,66,Mediocre zoom.The WX1 has a 5x zoom, which would seem to be better than the standard 3x zoom found on a typical point and shoot.,-1,0
1610,1,67,In practice, because this camera has such a wide angle lens to start with, zooming out 5x doesn't seem to get you any closer than a 3x zoom on a point and shoot without a wide angle lens.,-1,0
1610,1,68,In short, this camera won't get you close to far away objects, you'll have to use your feet.,-1,0
1610,1,69,It also seems to me that when you max out the zoom at 5x the photos get a little soft.4.,-1,0
1610,1,70,Beware of moving objects.The low light modes are great for stationary objects, but in some of the shots I took where people were walking they blurred.With the camera set in Program mode I ran after the dogs and couldn't get a single shot that wasn't too blurred to be any good, except when I had it in burst mode.,-1,0
1610,1,71,I would expect it would be the same for parents chasing their kids (mine are in their 20's and won't run from me anymore, so I can't test this).The camera supposedly has Motion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection, which in Intelligent Auto mode supposedly adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.,-1,1
1610,1,72,It also has a pet mode which is suppose to do the same thing for things that move on four legs.,-1,1
1610,1,73,Maybe I wasn't doing it right but they didn't seem to help much.The best bet for action and fast moving subjects with this camera seems to be the burst mode, which rips off 10 shots one after another when the shutter is pressed.,-1,1
1610,1,74,I didn't get a chance to test this at a little league game or AYSO tournament, but I did finally get a couple of stop action shots of the dog with it.,-1,1
1610,1,75,If you could control the shutter (which you can't) you might be able to get this camera to better stop action.,-1,1
1610,1,76,On the other hand a recent review of the upcoming S90 indicated that even with a fast lens and manual controls (allowing you to set the shutter) it wasn't fast enough for action, sports and kids.,-1,1
1610,1,77,I guess we have to face facts.,-1,1
1610,1,78,At the current state of the art, no point and shoot camera is going to do a great job in this area.All in all its a cool little camera which does things most point and shoots don't and also doesn't do things most point and shoots don't.,-1,1
1610,1,79,In case you're wondering, it never went back to Amazon although I do wonder if I might regret not having waited for the Canon S90 when that arrives.You can find some test shots I took here: [...],-1,1
1611,1,0,Best camera I've had so far.,-1,1
1611,1,1,I was looking at this last month when it was announced, and had decided I was going to go with the forthcoming 980 from Canon.,-1,1
1611,1,2,My last four digital cameras were all Canon, and i was happy with them.,-1,1
1611,1,3,But the more I dug and waited, the more I saw that there were things on this one I was hoping would make a difference, since many of my shots are indoors with my 5 year old, and the lower light benefits of this camera may make a difference.I was getting tired of the grainy blacks indoors even with good light on automatic settings...,-1,1
1611,1,4,They looked better if I manually set the ISO, but if I'm just pulling it out for a quick shot, i don't want to have to remember to go to manual settings all the time.,-1,1
1611,1,5,This is replacing a Canon Powershot SD40 Elph that I liked very much other than the grainy blacks...So I thought I'd take a chance.,-1,1
1611,1,6,The smile shutter may be useful with a 5 year old, the panorama mode looked pretty slick, battery life was more than acceptable compared to my SD40.,-1,1
1611,1,7,I liked the thin form factor even if it is a little larger the other two dimensions.,-1,1
1611,1,8,And the 3 inch touch screen would be a very nice upgrade from my tiny 1.2 or so inch on the canon.Since the big thing I was looking for was better indoor pictures with lower light and less grainy blacks, that was the first set of shots I took.,-1,1
1611,1,9,I had both cameras in my hands, one on top, one below.,-1,0
1611,1,10,Took shots at the same time from the same distances with the same lighting, both left on automatic.,-1,0
1611,1,11,I know I can always get into manual modes to compensate for things, but I wanted something I didn't always have to do that with.,-1,1
1611,1,12,And this low light boasting on the TX1 had me curious.Got the pictures onto my computer, loaded them side by side, and dang if every single picture I took was not GREATLY improved with the Sony compared to my older Canon.,-1,1
1611,1,13,The blacks were black, not grainy grey.,-1,1
1611,1,14,The details were better (makes sense since it's 3 MP more than mine) but the clarity of even far away things that weren't in focus was astounding.I have played with a family member's 900 version of the TX, and while it took good pictures, I didn't see that much difference between those and my older SD40.,-1,1
1611,1,15,So this one is definitely a notable improvement even over newer Sony cameras.The 10 shots per second is amazing - and they are great shots, not like they dropped in quality to get them so fast.,-1,0
1611,1,16,panorama is cool, but I need to work on the speed to get the best speed it needs, since mine so far have a spot in most of them where it gets a little fuzzy, probably where my speed changed.,-1,0
1611,1,17,Not very noticeable, but there nonetheless until I can figure out my panning method.Video i'll want to wait till tomorrow to test out more, as it's moving into evening here, indoor light is very very low.,-1,1
1611,1,18,Video still looked much brighter in the viewscreen and on replay than it really was when recorded, so you can see the power of the light gathering in everything you do with the camera.,-1,1
1611,1,19,But it was blurry when panning a bit (but i've yet to find a camera that doesn't break the bank that doesn't do this) so it's certainly not going to replace my hard drive based non HD camcorder for everything.I'll have to play with the more advanced features later after the battery recharges again, so I can test out the way it will take 6 shots and average them out for a crisp picture.,-1,1
1611,1,20,And some outdoor night shots.,-1,1
1611,1,21,But based just on what I've seen so far compared to the pictures I've been used to taking, I'm not too worried about them.,-1,1
1611,1,22,Even if they aren't as stellar as the photos, just having this kind of noiseless indoor low lighting shots more than satisfied my needs, and made this camera worth every penny.I would definitely buy this camera again.,-1,0
1611,1,23,And if you're like me, on the fence trying to figure out a good thing for indoor use, I can say that this is the best I've ever used so far.Edit a few days later - Movies I take in good light turn out fantastic.,-1,0
1611,1,24,Pictures, movies, everything I've done with this has been outstanding.,-1,0
1611,1,25,VERY happy with this camera.,-1,0
1612,1,0,Not a real upgrade from DSC-T900.,-1,1
1612,1,1,I have said a million times say that I love my DSC-T500It films amazing HD video, takes great photos, and overall is just a perfect pocket cam.,-1,1
1612,1,2,I then got a Kodak Zi8, which also takes great videos (better quality then the T500), decent photos, but the low light video quality suffers from being darker then the T500.So my journey continues to find a better low light pocket cam, since I mostly work from dark comedy clubs and situations.,-1,1
1612,1,3,Well Sony later released the T900 a sequel to the T500, and its lower light quality was no better and it got a downgrade from a 5X optical zoom to a 4X.,-1,1
1612,1,4,But.. the T900 was slimmer and had a few tiny software upgrades that still made it a great camera.Now just months after the release of the T900, Sony surprisingly pulled the T900 from the shelves and released a new camera called the DSC-TX1.,-1,1
1612,1,5,While this camera is stated as the new version of the T500/T900 series on many websites (including Amazon), I dont believe it.It has a smaller LCD (3" down from 3.5") a mono mic (instead of the stereo mic of the t500/t900) and familiar 4X optical zoom.,-1,1
1612,1,6,So why am I reviewing a camera that seems like a downgrade?Well Sony is using a new lens system called the "Exmor R".,-1,1
1612,1,7,It's been said that these new optics have TWICE the low light quality as the previous cameras.,-1,1
1612,1,8,The touchscreen also got an upgrade even if it's smaller and has more of a iphone'isk menu system.,-1,1
1612,1,9,With finger swipes you can view new photos, even draw on photos using your finger or the included stylus.,-1,1
1612,1,10,The hardware is slimmer, tiny in fact.. and the photo quality (especially during low light) is way better then the t500/t900.This camera is packed with new features and shooting modes, like my favorite, "Hand-Held Twilight" which take 7 photos in a second of a subject with no flash, combines the photos using software and makes the perfect single photo.,-1,1
1612,1,11,Its cool how it works, it detects things like walls, and removes the static.,-1,1
1612,1,12,It does an amazing job.So why am I returning this camera?Well for most people I would say buy this camera now.. its a great photo camera for it's size, and has some really neat features.,-1,1
1612,1,13,But as a owner of the previous model i'm spoiled.,-1,1
1612,1,14,The TX1 doesn't have a "movie mode" button like the t500/t900, you have to use the menu system to turn it on.,-1,1
1612,1,15,The MONO mic sounds fine, but its no where close to being as good as the STEREO mic of the past.,-1,1
1612,1,16,The LCD screen is bright, and high quality.. but its smaller.. and the menu system seems cluttered and annoyingly thought out.,-1,1
1612,1,17,The zoom is now buttons on top of the camera, so its clumsy to use, compared to the t500's rocker which you slide your finger on to zoom.But here is the main reason...,-1,1
1612,1,18,The video, while has amazingly richer colors, and blacker blacks.. is no brighter in low light situations.,-1,1
1612,1,19,When comparing the videos of the T500 to the TX1 the T500 actually had better low light!,-1,1
1612,1,20,While the video had more static, it was alot better.,-1,1
1612,1,21,So it might be a little more washed out on the T500, and have more of a grainy look to it, at least I could see things that the TX1 couldn't even pick up.,-1,1
1612,1,22,It's not a HUGE difference, but it was noticeable when shooting.So for whatever reason the video does NOT benefit from the new low light lens system.,-1,1
1612,1,23,So now I have a camera with better colors, but mono sound and poorer low light.So for my purposes, I will return and wait.,-1,1
1612,1,24,I have a feeling sony is prepping a true sequel to the T500/T900.,-1,1
1612,1,25,My guess is they are adding 1080P.,-1,1
1612,1,26,So I will wait, and see what happens in the next few months.,-1,1
1612,1,27,I just don't see them replacing a camera with one that is missing some key features of the previous.,-1,1
1612,1,28,I honestly think this camera is a T700 or T90 replacement.,-1,1
1612,1,29,As for the rest of you, I DO recommend this camera.. it great for what it is, just not for me.Hopefully since they pulled the recently released T900 off their website, something better will replace it soon.PROS:-New Exmor R lens system does reduce grain and increase low light photo quality-Great low light features and options for photos (only)-The Auto modes work well (photos)-720p video is great for it's size, and the colors are rich, and blacks are black-Video can record up to 32 min or 2GB at a time, then it stops and you have to hit record again, compared to the T500's 10 min limit.,-1,1
1612,1,30,(T900 also had the 32 min limit)-Great Slim Design, better battery door lock then DSC-t500-Panoramic mode is quick and painless with stunning results-10 FPS mode for action shots is great-Touchscreen works well, and looks great-It's fast to take photos-You can zoom during video!CONS:-Mono Microphone-3" screen instead of the previous 3.5"-Amazing Low light quality doesn't seem to work in Video mode.-No,-1,1
1612,1,31,actual video mode button (touchscreen based)-Zoom buttons seems awkward to use during filming-Battery/memory card is squeezed in camera's tiny body-4X optical zoom instead of 5X of DSC-T500If you search the internet for "redban and dsc-tx1"  I have numerous videos and photo samples available from my full review.,-1,1
1613,1,0,Amazing little camera.,-1,0
1613,1,1,I would strongly diasgree with the previous review that was just written.,-1,0
1613,1,2,I too have owned several cameras, including 2 DSLRs, so I can comment on the capabilities of the camera in a broader context.,-1,0
1613,1,3,Its picture quality during daylight shooting is definitely good.,-1,0
1613,1,4,The images are generally well exposed and have noise that I find average for its class (ultracompact).,-1,0
1613,1,5,However, this camera rocks at low light shooting.,-1,0
1613,1,6,Using the twilight mode, I get amazingly bright and smooth photos for dark environments.,-1,0
1613,1,7,I've never seen such a small camera have such detailed low-light photos.,-1,0
1613,1,8,The touch-screen interface is slick, but does have a bit of a learning curve.,-1,0
1613,1,9,Plus, the camera camera has 720p recording capability.,-1,0
1613,1,10,Other unique features such as smile detection and a panoramic mode both work surprisingly well.,-1,0
1613,1,11,Last, I cannot help but be amazed at the size and design of this camera.,-1,0
1613,1,12,It is truly pocketable.,-1,0
1613,1,13,Perfect... no.,-1,0
1613,1,14,But a true step forward for ultracompact cameras.,-1,0
1614,1,0,Pocket Rocket.,-1,1
1614,1,1,I normally buy my products through Amazon, but I am here in Taiwan when the TX1 was released and I decided to take a stab and buy one from the local 3C.I was wary of getting the touch screen version, having tried my sister's T9 from last year and not liking the interface.,-1,1
1614,1,2,But I have to say that the screen on the TX1 is very much improved and now I wonder if I could go back to a conventional interface.,-1,1
1614,1,3,Taking pictures with this camera is so much fun.Because it is so thin and light, pressing the shutter release button without adding shake to the shot takes a very steady hand.,-1,1
1614,1,4,I rather prefer to use the 2-second timer, which gives me just enough time after pressing the button to steady up the focus frame on my subject.,-1,1
1614,1,5,My only caveat so far is that I could keep it on 2-second timer as default, rather having to set it for each shot.This, combined with the various technologies give great low-light shots, really incredible for hand-held.,-1,1
1614,1,6,The TX1 is my so-called "American Express" camera, replacing my much larger and less-forgiving Fujifilm F31fd.,-1,1
1614,1,7,It is really hard to take bad shots with this camera, and if you take the time to learn the benefits of the various modes, I am certain you will get great results too.I was also skeptical of getting the rather narrow range of the 35mm lens, thinking I would prefer the wider lens on the WX1 when it comes out next month, but the panorama mode is awesome so I don't miss having the wider lens.,-1,1
1614,1,8,All of the technologies work well, and are not just Sony's hype.,-1,1
1614,1,9,This camera really deserves way better than two stars.Give this little gem a spin.,-1,1
1614,1,10,You can always return it if you don't agree that it's the best little camera out there.,-1,1
1615,1,0,Cool Camera, BUT YOU HAVE TO READ THE MANUAL.,-1,0
1615,1,1,Hi everyone and thanks for reading my reviewIf you are reading this chances are that you are in the market for a good point and shoot camera...In my opinion, you have to look no further.Most complaints about this camera basically tell you that the new image sensor that sony uses is not "that great" or that night images are good but day images are not...These complaints would ALL go away if they read the manual.,-1,0
1615,1,2,Even though the camera is really simple to use, there are small tweaks that you have to adjust in order to create a perfect picture.I got this camera and its sibling (wx1) for 2 main reasons:1.-,-1,0
1615,1,3,portability and ease to use2.-,-1,0
1615,1,4,PARTY SHOT.,-1,0
1615,1,5,its this little dock that rotates, pan and tilts to automatically shoot pictures... its a great neat addition to a compatible sony camera and I would highly recommend this gadget also.so,-1,0
1615,1,6,here's the things I love about the camera:1.-,-1,0
1615,1,7,Easy to use2.-,-1,0
1615,1,8,Takes great panoramic photos3.-,-1,0
1615,1,9,Captures great indoor pictures4.-good,-1,0
1615,1,10,battery life5.-touch,-1,0
1615,1,11,screen with a lot of great add ons (like basic picture editing features built into the camera) it even comes with a stylus pen.Now the not so great features are:1.-,-1,0
1615,1,12,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-,-1,1
1615,1,13,proprietary cable: I guess this is the most annoying and irritating feature (or non feature) of the camera: Sony created this  weird looking dongle that is supposed to make life easier... you plug in the camera one end (again, proprietary port, not the standard mini usb port you would find in other cameras) and on the other end you have a standard video and audio jacks that you would plug into your TV  and a USB port for downloading pictures.,-1,1
1615,1,14,I really dont like this, but I can live with it.. just be sure to never forget your cable.There you have it, I hope this review was helpfulbest regards,-1,1
1616,1,0,VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE: Great Camera!,-1,1
1616,1,1,UPDATE: I just found out today that a White Balance setting might be the key to this camera for outdoor shots.,-1,1
1616,1,2,When setting on "P" mode I found out that switching the White Balance from "Auto" or "Daylight" to "Flash" in improves outdoor photos color, tone, exposure and warmness.,-1,1
1616,1,3,I was so amazed in the difference!!  See my photos above![...]After 3 weeks of waiting for this camera to be released I now have it in my hands and taken over 500 pictures.,-1,0
1616,1,4,Within those photos I have found out the best settings for the right scenes and conditions.,-1,0
1616,1,5,With that, I will clear up problems previous owners have had.First, I'm sure all of you want to know how good the new Exmor R sensor is.,-1,0
1616,1,6,It's pretty good, WITH THE RIGHT SETTINGS.,-1,0
1616,1,7,I will go into that later.This camera really has some cool features, Like Sweep Panorama, Smile Shutter, Handheld Twilight and AntiMotion Blur Mode.The key is setting the camera up for the right scenes, which means not keeping it set on Intelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode(AKA Auto everything).,-1,0
1616,1,8,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.,-1,0
1616,1,9,You have to switch the camera to Handheld Twilight mode and adjust the Exposure Value(EV) from -0.3 to -1.7(this is a very important setting that needs to be set on order to remove the noisyness and grain from the photo, a setting people don't adjust and then complain about how bad the photo looks in low light).,-1,0
1616,1,10,You might also want to try different White Balances,setting correctly results in really nice low light shots.Outdoor shots:This camera in iSCN mode seems to keep the lens all the way open(F2.4)and it adjusts the shutter speed(a big No No)resulting in washed out over exposed photos(yuck).The solution: switch to "P" Mode which closes down the lens to around a nice F5.0 to F7.1(much better) and switch the White Balance to "Flash" .,-1,0
1616,1,11,Also for better exposure you can again adjust the EV.Panorama Shots: This one's tricky, from where you press the shutter to start the panorama it locks the exposure at that point.,-1,1
1616,1,12,If you start in a dark scene and move across through a bright scene, It's going to be over exposed.,-1,1
1616,1,13,Make sure you start in a modernity lit scene and if needed switch EV from -0.3 to -1.0.Hopefully this information helps and clears up previous reviewers problems with this camera.Other good things to add: This camera does quite nicely in bright sun light(see my  test photos above, however amazon doesn't let you upload them in high quality but you'll get the idea).,-1,1
1616,1,14,Takes really nice close up Marco photos.,-1,1
1616,1,15,High Definition video is really nice and clear(just remember to adjust the EV in low light 1.0 to 2.0 to remove noise).Over all a nice Sony camera great size, style and pictures.Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.I should be adding more to this review soon.[...],-1,1
1617,1,0,Slightly better at low light but terrible with good light.,-1,1
1617,1,1,As an owner of a smattering of point and shoot cameras and high end DSLR's, I can be more picky than most about cameras.I own an old 6MP Sony T9 slim camera from 4 years or so back and this looked like a promising upgrade for a slim pocketable camera.,-1,1
1617,1,2,HD MP4 video, 4x zoom, almost twice the MP, touch screen and this new touted Exmor R sensor.The T9 isn't a great camera, in fact it's one of the worst at image quality of all of my cameras, and it's memory stick duo format is constantly a hassle.Unfortunately this new TX1 still uses Memory Stick Duo, and is somehow just as bad in terms of image quality as the old T9.,-1,0
1617,1,3,It's better in low light but still very grainy, however it's worse in good bright light.,-1,1
1617,1,4,Set manually to the lowest ISO (125) and placed on a tripod, the T9 produces shots with more detail and dynamic range while the TX1 has a grainy soft and blown highlight look to everything.,-1,1
1617,1,5,This is with the best possible conditions, and in my opinion the shots from this camera are completely unacceptable.,-1,1
1617,1,6,Handheld shots in the automatic modes have much more noise and grain in them, even in full daylight.,-1,1
1617,1,7,Trees in the distance look like water paintings.,-1,1
1617,1,8,Neither camera is good with contrasty scenes, but all I want out of a small pocket camera is acceptable images to resize and post on facebook and so on.The TX1 will do, but for the price the quality is terrible.,-1,1
1617,1,9,Cut the price in half and I might think about keeping it but this is all about style over design.It does have some neat features like a high speed burst mode, an anti shake mode that takes multiple exposures and combines and aligns in camera, face detection and so on.,-1,1
1617,1,10,It also has one of the best touchscreen interfaces I've used on a camera, it's not in the way and it's easy and quick to use.,-1,0
1617,1,11,Just double tapping on where you want the camera to focus is very nice as well.,-1,0
1617,1,12,The zoom slider is probably the worst physical part on this camera, not very sensitive, and then when you finally get it to zoom, it shoots quickly from the wide end to the telephoto end which means you are always overzooming and having to back off, which is frustrating when all you want is to frame the image.If this is going to be your only small camera I would choose something else probably from Canon or Panasonic, it will be a slightly larger camera but the jump in quality will be very noticeable.I'm going to return it and keep the T9 for the pocket slim camera that I don't care about, and use the SD870is and LX-3 as my other smaller cameras.,-1,1
1617,1,13,Unless the price on this really drops, or you just have to have this for the style and don't care about camera-phone quality pictures from a dedicated camera I would stay away from this model.,-1,1
1618,1,0,Exceeded my expectation!,-1,1
1618,1,1,I have a Panasonic DMC-ZS3/TZ7 and wanted to get a low light capable compact camera to take picture of my 6-month old.,-1,1
1618,1,2,So my choices before the TX1 was DMC-LX3, with F2.0 capability.,-1,1
1618,1,3,But after playing with DMC-LX3 for a few minutes, I knew it wasn't for me, since you have to manually set adjustments to get the best result.Then I saw Sony coming out with two new cameras with EXMOR-R sensor, which is specifically designed for low light, hand-held, high iso picture taking.,-1,1
1618,1,4,It sounded very interesting, but since there are no cameras with this sensor yet, (only camcorders), I decided to give it a try.Once I received the camera, I immediately tried the hand-held twilight mode.,-1,1
1618,1,5,It worked better than I expected!,-1,1
1618,1,6,It can take 6 consecutive pictures at once, and stack them together to get a high detailed picture, without showing the usual grainy high iso result.,-1,1
1618,1,7,I even compared with my DMC-ZS3, and the TX1 is definitely a lot better in low light picture.,-1,1
1618,1,8,No more using tripod, just hand-held and shoot.The other feature that I love is the Panorama mode, it has two settings, Standard or Wide, depend on how much you want to capture.,-1,1
1618,1,9,It's very easy to operate, and there is no more taking multiple pictures, then download to your computer to stitch them together!,-1,1
1618,1,10,You can see the result instantly!Other features worth mention is the 10FPS mode, DRO (Dynamic Range Optimizer) mode which shows better shadow and highlights, and the paint mode (add frames, and write text on pictures).,-1,1
1618,1,11,Date Stamp is done with the PMB software.HD video quality is actually better than the DMC-ZS3 AVCHD-lite.,-1,1
1618,1,12,Although the sound is MONO compared to ZS3's Stereo, but the video quality and easy to work with editing software make up the difference!,-1,1
1618,1,13,You can also zoom in/out during video capturing, and it does not record the zooming sound.The only thing that it can not compare to the DMC-ZS3 is the outdoor pictures.,-1,1
1618,1,14,It does not have the sharpness, but it's more than enough to display on monitor, and print on photo papers.Overall I am very satisfied, and would recommend this to anyone looking for ultra-compact point&shoot; camera.,-1,1
1619,1,0,Our last camera was a canon Powershot S2 IS.,-1,1
1619,1,1,The Canon stopped working, suffering from "the black screen of death".,-1,1
1619,1,2,Having faith and loyalty in the Canon brand (this was our 4th Canon Camera purchase, two of which were Canon AE-1s given as gifts) I contacted Canon and was sorely disappointed.,-1,1
1619,1,3,Even though many other models with the same faulty CCD had been recalled they refused to stand behind this product.After a year of research and looking at many cameras, I came across the Sony DSC-TX1.,-1,1
1619,1,4,It got me thinking about all of the Sony products we have had in the past.,-1,1
1619,1,5,Which included at least 2 Sony camcorders, a very early digital camera; Sony Mavica MVC-FD75, various other electronics and most recently a Sony Bravia V-Series KDL-40V3000 40-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV.,-1,1
1619,1,6,We have been very pleased with every one of those products.,-1,1
1619,1,7,As a matter of fact, the MVC-FD75 took amazing pictures even though the megapixels were only 0.3 and used a 3.5 floppy to store images.,-1,1
1619,1,8,My husband still uses that camera.So, mostly on a whim, I thought to h*** with reviews and purchased the TX-1.,-1,1
1619,1,9,I LOVED it from day one!,-1,0
1619,1,10,It is very intuitive, and easy to use.,-1,0
1619,1,11,I used it as soon as I got the battery charged - and that, the battery, is the only thing I can say is a slight negative.,-1,0
1619,1,12,I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.,-1,0
1619,1,13,However I am more than willing to suffer that inconvenience for a quality, sleek, sexy, fun to use camera.I flipped  through the manual while the battery charged.,-1,0
1619,1,14,As soon as the battery charged, I started using the camera.,-1,0
1619,1,15,I found it amazingly easy to use with just that little bit of reading.,-1,0
1619,1,16,I took panoramas, photos with the foreground in focus and the background unfocused and vice versa, and very clear macros (the canon could do all of these things, but it was a pain, and the macros were almost impossible).,-1,0
1619,1,17,The low light pictures were much better then any other camera I have owned.,-1,0
1619,1,18,The size is another thing I love...it's about the same size as my cell phone.I suspect that a professional photographer may disagree with my assessment.,-1,0
1619,1,19,That being said, if you are a casual user looking for a point and shoot that is easy and fun to use and small in size, this is the camera for you.,-1,0
1620,1,0,If only it took good pictures..,-1,1
1620,1,1,I decided to purchase a new pocket camera to take on a trip to Disney World.,-1,1
1620,1,2,I needed low light capabilities for indoor and nighttime pictures without a flash and a wide angle lens.,-1,1
1620,1,3,I purchased two cameras and compared them for several days prior to the trip.,-1,1
1620,1,4,The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90.,-1,1
1620,1,5,The Sony is smaller, has better battery life, and does HD video.,-1,1
1620,1,6,It has some unique and interesting modes including the rapid 10 shot and slick panoramic modes.,-1,1
1620,1,7,The Canon has faster glass (f/2.0),,-1,1
1620,1,8,full manual controls, a unique flexible control ring/dial, RAW capability, great build quality/feel and very low noise levels for a pocket camera.,-1,1
1620,1,9,Its battery charger requires only two hours.,-1,1
1620,1,10,The downsides of the Sony include a slow included battery charger (6 hours but you can buy a faster charger for $50), cheaper build quality/feel, and really poor auto white balance requiring constant manual tweaking.,-1,1
1620,1,11,The contrast and exposure levels were also inconsistent and usually worse than the Canon, requiring tweaking in Photoshop.,-1,1
1620,1,12,The Sony also had higher noise levels at all ISO values.,-1,1
1620,1,13,Lastly, from the "what were they thinking??" category, the flash is placed in a position where the lens blocks the flash from illuminating the lower left corner of the image at the wide end of the lens.,-1,1
1620,1,14,This is readily noticeable.,-1,1
1620,1,15,The downsides of the Canon are its larger size (but still pocketable), the lack of HD video, worse battery life (buy a second battery) and its narrower zoom range (28-105 mm equivalent vs. the Sony's 25-120 mm).,-1,1
1620,1,16,The bottom line was that I was getting a camera mainly for pictures and while I will miss the HD video and some of the Sony's special modes, the picture quality of the Canon was clearly superior to the Sony.,-1,1
1620,1,17,Its low light capabilities were also greater with the faster lens, its own lower resolution high sensitivity mode, and lower noise levels.,-1,1
1620,1,18,I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon.,-1,1
1620,1,19,I took about 700 pictures and shot about 50 videos with the Canon on my trip and feel that I clearly made the right choice.,-1,1
1620,1,20,While the Sony was good, the Canon was the clear winner here.,-1,1
1620,1,21,Even in auto mode, the Canon took consistently good pictures, important when handing your camera to someone to shoot your picture.,-1,1
1620,1,22,For me, it was all about picture quality.,-1,1
1621,1,0,Great size, good-to-great performance.,-1,0
1621,1,1,The short review:I've owned this camera for a week and tested it out thoroughly.,-1,0
1621,1,2,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.,-1,0
1621,1,3,If you want ultimate still-picture quality, this is not the one for you.The long review:I bought this camera to replace my aging Sony DSC-T7.,-1,0
1621,1,4,I loved the thinness and convenience of the T7, but after four years it was getting long in the tooth -- at only 5.1 megapixels, 3x zoom, and 640x480 video, it's almost prehistoric by today's standards.I watched the evolution of Sony's thin cameras after the T7 and T9, but was distressed to see that after they added the touch screens, the cameras bulged out to more than twice as thick as the T7.,-1,0
1621,1,5,The whole point of a thin camera is that you can slip it into your pocket and forget it's there.,-1,1
1621,1,6,The T900 was almost twice as thick as the thinnest part of the T7, which was a deal-breaker for me.So I was happy to see the TX1 appear earlier this year.,-1,1
1621,1,7,It's still thicker than the T7, but when you put them side by side it's a pretty close call, and the TX1's curvaceous body makes it feel a bit thinner than it is.,-1,1
1621,1,8,At 10.2 megapixels, 4x zoom, and 1280x720 video, the specs are about twice as good as the T7.,-1,1
1621,1,9,But looking at the reviews was a bit discouraging.,-1,1
1621,1,10,The highly technical reviewers generally praised it, but many everyday users reported problems.I decided to buy a TX1 anyway, and I'm glad I did.First the cons.,-1,1
1621,1,11,Like any camera this size, they had to make sacrifices to get the smallness.,-1,1
1621,1,12,The image quality is not going to be as good as a larger camera with a non-folded lens system and a bigger sensor.,-1,1
1621,1,13,If you do very careful shots of standard test patterns, you can see that there's a tiny bit of fuzziness near the edges of the picture when you zoom in, and the image has more grain at a given light level than a large camera would have.,-1,1
1621,1,14,You can check Imaging Resource's review of the TX1 for details.My main problem with it (as with the T7) is that when you take pictures in very low light with the flash on, your subjects can look white and washed out if you're not careful.,-1,1
1621,1,15,You can fix this by using the slow-synchro flash setting and by standing back further from your subject, but it takes some experimentation to learn to use it well.,-1,0
1621,1,16,As others have commented, you really do need to read the manual, experiment with the settings, and learn how to get the best results with it.But no one should be buying this camera because they want the best possible picture quality.,-1,0
1621,1,17,If that's what you're after, you really should buy a DSLR.,-1,1
1621,1,18,They're much bigger, but the image quality is unmatched.The real reason to buy this camera is to take pictures that you wouldn't take otherwise.,-1,1
1621,1,19,When I'm going to a friend's house for a party, or going out on the town, I don't want to drag along a DSLR, or even a "normal" 2-inch-thick camera.,-1,0
1621,1,20,I want a camera that I don't know is there, that I can whip out in 2 seconds to snap off a shot.,-1,0
1621,1,21,When I'm on vacation on the beach, I don't want to hang a camera case around my neck, I want something that fits in my pocket with room to spare.With that in mind, this camera has tons of great features.First, the low-light performance is outstanding.,-1,0
1621,1,22,Sony touts their new "Exmor R" sensor chips highly, but I'm the skeptical type, so I did a head-to-head comparison with my old T7.,-1,1
1621,1,23,In a room illuminated by only a thin string of Christmas lights, with the flash turned off, the TX1 could produce a good picture in its "Hand-held Twilight" mode.,-1,1
1621,1,24,The T7 produced a full frame of black in the same situation.,-1,1
1621,1,25,The same goes for video: the TX1 can take a usable video in a candlelit room, where the T7 just shows black noise.,-1,1
1621,1,26,This low-light ability is great for taking pictures and video in museums, restaurants, concerts, bars, and other dark places where a flash is either not allowed, or doesn't help.The TX1 automatically switches between different modes depending on the lighting and distance to the subject.,-1,1
1621,1,27,If you hold it close to a flower, it switches into Macro mode.,-1,1
1621,1,28,If you hold it even closer, it switches to Close Focus mode, which is almost like a microscope!,-1,1
1621,1,29,In the dark, it switches to Twilight mode.,-1,1
1621,1,30,It's like the automatic transmission in a car, where it finds the best gear on its own.My favorite hidden feature is the "Dual Shot" option.,-1,0
1621,1,31,In difficult lighting conditions, it'll take two pictures in quick succession, but with different exposure settings, so you can choose which one you like best.,-1,0
1621,1,32,I've found that it's best to make those decisions looking at the pictures at full size on a computer screen, rather than on the camera screen -- a shot that looks washed out or too bright on the camera screen is often perfect when seen on a larger monitor.,-1,1
1621,1,33,I'd guess they're cranking up the brightness of the camera screen a bit to make it more visible in sunlight.The "Anti Motion Blur" and "Hand-held Twilight" modes each take six pictures in quick succession, then combine them to reduce noise and blurriness.,-1,1
1621,1,34,They both work well, though the results are even better if you brace the camera somehow instead of shooting totally freehand.,-1,1
1621,1,35,Still, it beats the pants off the T7, where I'd have to make several attempts to shoot a freehand picture in low light before I got one where my hand didn't shake.,-1,1
1621,1,36,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.,-1,1
1621,1,37,I used running dogs as a test, and the results were impressive -- there was no digital blockiness near their fast-moving legs, and the image quality was good even when panning the camera around.,-1,1
1621,1,38,You can zoom in and out while filming, and I couldn't hear the zoom motor in the video clips.,-1,1
1621,1,39,The microphone is mono, not stereo, but it's sensitive and the sound quality is good.The touch screen is very responsive, well-organized, and easy to use.,-1,1
1621,1,40,It controls everything but the zoom, shutter, and on/off switch, but it's quick enough where I never found myself wishing for more physical buttons.,-1,1
1621,1,41,Like other LCD screens, it can be hard to see in bright sunlight, but it's still usable.All in all, I'm very happy with the TX1.,-1,0
1621,1,42,It's perfect for what I bought it for, and if you read the manual and learn how to use it, you'll get great results.,-1,0
1622,1,0,The Camera That Stole Me Away From Canon!,-1,1
1622,1,1,Sony TX1.,-1,1
1622,1,2,For a long time I was nervous about leaving canon elphs!,-1,1
1622,1,3,Normally I stay away from sony as if it were the plague.,-1,1
1622,1,4,Every sony electronic I've ever bought has had complications or broken down on me in 1-2 years (video camera, laptop, desktop, etc.).However, I wanted a true pocket-size camera that was good in low lights, had HD video for quick memory capture, and took overall really good pics.,-1,1
1622,1,5,I've had elphs, including the new SD780, since they were first releast.,-1,1
1622,1,6,Great little cameras - always top not pictures, very portable, and extremely durable (I'm kind-of clumsy).,-1,0
1622,1,7,Unfortunately, the last SD780 did not live to longgg (black sand at the beach).,-1,0
1622,1,8,Long story short, outdoor pics were great, the camera size was excellent, and battery life was out of this world.,-1,0
1622,1,9,However, indoor shots were almost always really fuzzy, the screen is tiny, and the overall camera was simply boring.So, after some research I decided to give the sony a try...I have to say that I love it.,-1,0
1622,1,10,The camera is amazing...the panorama tool and the touch screen are so intuitive and easy.,-1,0
1622,1,11,The pictures it takes are AMAZING - low light and normal.,-1,0
1622,1,12,I've done tons of pics in bowling allies at night, at parties, at plays, you name it, with and mostly without flash - and pics are amazing!,-1,0
1622,1,13,Outdoor pics are eqaully fantastic.,-1,0
1622,1,14,The camera is also really small and fits easily into my front pocket with minimal notice, the play mode touch screen options are pretty incredible, and the advance dual shot mode is pretty incredible --- e.g.,-1,1
1622,1,15,sometimes for night shots it will automatically do two shots, one with flash and one without or simply alternate settings and do two shots really fast so you can choose which one to keep.Things I really don't like:- proprietary cable- sony memory card (kind-of pricey, albeit a little bit faster than SDHC - definitely not a big hinderance)- Battery life is decent (it's really not bad at all - it will last a day with tons of shooting - but i wish it was better)Things I really like:- size and overall design- picture quality- touch screen- video recording quality- intelligent auto mode - much better than most other cameras auto mode (for when you're in a rush)- low light capabilities are out-of-hand...simply amazing!,-1,1
1622,1,16,not kidding...- camera slideshow and editing capabilities- touch screen focus selectionWould I recommend: yes! Especially, if form factor, low light picture taking, and overall fun factor is important to you.,-1,1
1622,1,17,This camera runs circles around the Canon SD780 and SD940 - which I'm surprised to acknowledge....,-1,1
1623,1,0,Perfect Fit.,-1,0
1623,1,1,My requirements in a camera are pretty basic:  compact for travel, good color values, enough megapixels to maintain clarity when the pictures are shown in class on a data projector, and something convenient for family and pet shots.,-1,0
1623,1,2,When I body-slammed my camera and myself to the paving stones of Salisbury, England, my Sony DSC-T9 performed like nothing had happened until I returned home, four days later.,-1,1
1623,1,3,Then, it completely kicked the bucket, vibrating uncontrollably and unable to focus.,-1,1
1623,1,4,I researched other brands online and in person, but frankly, the color values for Canon, Nikon, Casio,Samsung, and Kodak and the Sony W-series were completely unnatural on the viewing screens.,-1,1
1623,1,5,I've been with Sony digital cameras since the first Mavica and I liked what I saw advertised, so took a leap of faith with the TX1.,-1,1
1623,1,6,My daughter got the HX1 and after seeing its colors values and features, it was tempting, but bottom line, too bulky for my needs.I've had the DSC TX-1 camera for 24 hours and having mastered the touch screen am running it through its paces:  *  Low light, wonderful!,-1,1
1623,1,7,That will help in museums and the interior of historic homes where flash and tripod are not welcome, not to mention sparing people (especially babies) temporary flash blindness when taking candids at parties.,-1,1
1623,1,8,Not a gimmick to me:  I can shoot the local lighthouse which means I can shoot cramped cathedrals.,-1,1
1623,1,9,*  The pet feature is great.,-1,1
1623,1,10,Don't laugh, my first dog was a ham and it didn't matter, but the new one's camera shy.,-1,1
1623,1,11,*  Closeups of the flowers in the garden and some figurines inside without flash came out beautifully.,-1,1
1623,1,12,*  I tested out the film feature, and caught a pair of squirrels chasing on the fence in perfect clarity (not to mention hilarity.)I,-1,1
1623,1,13,don't have an SLR and I don't want one.,-1,1
1623,1,14,I'm strictly point and shoot.,-1,1
1623,1,15,The memory stick duo is what Sony uses; save to an external hard drive (you're going to need one either for the quantity of VGA photos or the memory required to store all your 10.2 megapixel treasures) and re-use to bring down your expenses if the price differential with other media is such a big factor.,-1,1
1623,1,16,Maybe I should know what "noise" is without having to look it up, but I don't.,-1,1
1623,1,17,The outdoor and indoor pictures look just fine, even at full magnification.,-1,1
1623,1,18,I haven't transferred them to the computer, but I don't show my pictures on my computer.,-1,1
1623,1,19,Neither do I have a huge HD television, nor a super-duper printer for printing large images on photo paper.,-1,0
1623,1,20,If you're like me, then you probably won't see odd color flecks either (that's what noise is, for the uninitiated.)For,-1,0
1623,1,21,me, it's a sweet little camera, a perfect fit.,-1,0
1623,1,22,Did I pay too much?,-1,0
1623,1,23,Having the first decent portrait of my three-year-old Sheltie, in glorious true sable and white color (unlike the competition), is worth every penny I paid.,-1,0
1624,1,0,Great little shooter.,-1,1
1624,1,1,I had a bought a Sony DSC-T3 a few years ago, wanting it so bad I imported one from Japan!,-1,1
1624,1,2,If its zoom hadn't given out after many active years, I'd still shoot with it.,-1,1
1624,1,3,The TX1 seemed to be the latest and greatest successor in Sony's ultracompact line, and it hasn't disappointed.I thought I'd hate the touchscreen, but it's actually very convenient, and responds smoothly.,-1,1
1624,1,4,About all it can't do is pinch-zoom, and I'm guessing that's more of a patent issue than anything else.,-1,1
1624,1,5,Controls are laid out sensibly, and it's easy to switch from automated settings to finer image control.One of the coolest new features is Panorama mode, which makes ultra-wide photos quickly and easily.,-1,0
1624,1,6,It absolutely works as advertised - it's also fun to mess with, such as when I took a panorama of my friend as he followed the camera, making a crazy hall-of-mirrors effect.The much-touted low-light settings are great, as well, addressing an issue pretty much all compact cameras have.,-1,0
1624,1,7,It can do a shockingly good job finding light and eliminating blur in dark situations, letting you avoid using the tiny, intrusive flash.The 720p video is pretty nice, largely free of the dreaded wobbly effect many still cameras produce.,-1,0
1624,1,8,As a bonus, you can zoom while recording video.There's drawbacks, of course - Sony's continued, stubborn insistence on Memory Stick is irksome, but honestly, I don't move memory cards around much.,-1,1
1624,1,9,The zoom's a bit unresponsive, not allowing very fine adjustment.,-1,1
1624,1,10,You're going to have to wipe off the touchscreen a lot.,-1,0
1624,1,11,Also, I find it easy to hit the power button when the camera's in a crowded pocket.,-1,0
1624,1,12,Shots are going to be grainier than when you shoot with your D300 - such is life.No camera's perfect, but when you hold this thing, you can't help but think of what a miracle it would look like to someone from even ten years ago.,-1,0
1624,1,13,I'm happy I waited for the TX1 to come out, and it's going to be in my pocket for years to come, ready for when life happens.,-1,0
1625,1,0,From a Leica M2 to a Sony WX1.,-1,1
1625,1,1,I'm somewhat puzzled after reading several of the poor reviews for this camera.,-1,1
1625,1,2,I've had this camera since the beginning of October, and I've taken a number of shots under various conditions, day and night.,-1,1
1625,1,3,In some cases the results, day and night, were outstanding.,-1,1
1625,1,4,In other cases they were less so.,-1,1
1625,1,5,In no case have I had the problems described by those who have given the camera one, two or even three stars.Now I suppose that it could simply be the case that my standards are lower than those writing strongly negative reviews.,-1,1
1625,1,6,However, while not a "pixel peeper", I do care about the quality of the image.,-1,1
1625,1,7,What a great camera.,-1,0
1625,1,8,I spent a lot of happy days taking pictures with that camera.,-1,0
1625,1,9,The prints that I developed were, imho, better than anything I've seen come out of a less than ultra high end DSLR.,-1,0
1625,1,10,The Leica M2 was followed by a series of Nikon and Olympus SLR's.,-1,0
1625,1,11,I was still shooting film when the digital age rolled around.,-1,0
1625,1,12,Until the WX1 my only concession to the digital shift was a FujiPix F30.,-1,0
1625,1,13,It's a fun camera, but I wanted something smaller for casual shooting.,-1,0
1625,1,14,When I can afford it, I'll get a DSLR to replace the SLR's.All of this is to say that I have some experience with photography, although I would not in any way consider myself a "serious" photographer.,-1,0
1625,1,15,Measured in terms of that experience, the WX1 is a very good camera for its purposes.,-1,0
1625,1,16,I bought it as a pocket camera that could take quality pictures, day or night.,-1,1
1625,1,17,So far, that expectation has been satisfied.,-1,1
1625,1,18,I also bought it for the HD video which I haven't tried out yet.I've been wondering whether my relative lack of familiarity with recent model digital cameras may explain the difference between my experience with the WX1 and the experience of others.,-1,1
1625,1,19,When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked.,-1,1
1625,1,20,I spent a lot of time familiarizing myself with the workings of the Leica.,-1,1
1625,1,21,This made a big difference in the quality of the pictures that I took.,-1,0
1625,1,22,Accordingly, before using the WX1, I downloaded and read the manuals in their entirety, trying to familiarize myself with the camera's resources (of which there are quite a few and limits (of which there are also quite a few).,-1,0
1625,1,23,I still haven't figured out how best to use the WX1, but I learned for, example, that turning the DRO on or off made a substantial difference in IQ, as did learning the idiosyncracies of the white balance and the various settings that were automatically set in the various camera modes.,-1,0
1625,1,24,I would say, and this may be a mark against it for many people, that the WX1 is not a "point and shoot" camera unless one is familiar with its workings, but when I read the negative comments I wonder if some of the issues complained of could be addressed through a better understanding of the camera.,-1,1
1625,1,25,I been following several threads on the WX1 at an online camera forum.,-1,1
1625,1,26,The complaints were loud and long about the picture quality of the WX1 daytime shots.,-1,1
1625,1,27,Photos were posted that looked really bad.,-1,1
1625,1,28,Photos were posted that looked really good.,-1,1
1625,1,29,Most were the work of apparently accomplished photographers.,-1,1
1625,1,30,Finally someone complained that the camera wouldn't shoot over 800 in the handheld nighttime setting.,-1,1
1625,1,31,Someone else said that they had no problem shooting at higher speeds in that setting.,-1,1
1625,1,32,It turned out that the the problem was that in one case (the no greater than 800 case), the DRO was on.,-1,1
1625,1,33,It also turned out that with the DRO turned off, many of the problems with the IQ of daytime shots were addressed.,-1,1
1625,1,34,This doesn't mean that someone with all the knowledge in the world of the camera's capabilities and all the skill in the world at taking photographs might not conclude that they found shots taken with the WX1 were unacceptable.,-1,1
1625,1,35,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.,-1,0
1625,1,36,Still, this camera seems to me to have a lot of functionality that makes it worth the time learning how to use it properly.,-1,0
1626,1,0,Very good pocket camera.,-1,0
1626,1,1,But Exmor R isn't as good as promised.,-1,0
1626,1,2,This is a very very nice pocket camera.,-1,0
1626,1,3,It's far smaller than the photos suggest.,-1,0
1626,1,4,This replaces my Samsung NV24HD.,-1,0
1626,1,5,I bought this camera because of its 24mm super wide lens and the promise of Sony's new Exmor R chip.,-1,0
1626,1,6,While it does have more low-light sensitivity, noise is still just as bad as other cameras.,-1,1
1626,1,7,Photos taken during "twilight" (or street lights) look dramatically better than a regular camera.,-1,1
1626,1,8,But again, the amount of noise is just obnoxious at times.I would say this cam is on the upper end of pocket cams: Lots of features, sturdy construction, fast performance, decent image quality.,-1,1
1626,1,9,I always try to remember that pocket cameras are made for fun and convenience, not National Geographic cover photos.,-1,0
1626,1,10,A grainy photo is better than no photo at all.,-1,0
1626,1,11,There's only so much light & clarity a square centimeter of glass is going to allow.So in a nutshell:PROS24mm super wide angle lens.*Optical*,-1,0
1626,1,12,Steady Shot.,-1,0
1626,1,13,(not electronic)Sweep Panorama is fun and fast.Auto Macro -- never have to adjust settings to take extreme close-upsAnti-Motion Blur Mode - takes 6 rapid fire photos and blends the exposures together.Better looking low-light (twilight) photos.,-1,0
1626,1,14,(but still crazy noisy)P Mode allows Exposure Bracketing, White Balance, Shadow enhancement.Smile Shutter with Blink detection.Easy Mode for handing camera to friends or relatives.,-1,0
1626,1,15,;)Comes with AC battery charger.Red Eye Fix in-camera after photo is taken.CONSExmor R isn't quite as amazing as promised.Movie mode records in MPEG-4, not h.264 or AVCHD Lite.,-1,0
1626,1,16,Very noisy and dark in low light.Images noisy.,-1,1
1626,1,17,Even in overcast outdoor photos.No compression control.,-1,1
1626,1,18,Only control over resolution.Photos are inky looking.,-1,1
1626,1,19,Shadows and dark areas get crushed.Screen washes out in daylight.,-1,1
1626,1,20,Almost impossible to see.Proprietary USB/Composite video cable.,-1,1
1626,1,21,(it's really ugly)No USB Charging.,-1,1
1626,1,22,No standard USB connection.,-1,1
1626,1,23,No HDMI.Expensive Memory Stick Duo.,-1,1
1626,1,24,(No speed advantage with Ultra II or HX cards)Mac software only includes music transfer software for in-camera slideshow mode.,-1,1
1627,1,0,Excellent camera.,-1,0
1627,1,1,This camera is perfection.,-1,0
1627,1,2,My first digital camera and its very easy to use and take perfect pictures especially when its pitch black dark and others wouldn't notice that it was dark.,-1,0
1627,1,3,It auto adjust to light so you always get great pictures.,-1,0
1627,1,4,I absolutly love and highly recommend it.,-1,0
1627,1,5,Sony did a great job on this camera.,-1,0
1628,1,0,Finally Perfection!!,-1,0
1628,1,1,I am on my 3rd Digital Camera now.....I have had 3 Canons, and decided to stray out of my comfort zone and buy a Sony.,-1,0
1628,1,2,It is an Awesome camera that takes beautiful clear photos!! Great Close up, Great far away!!,-1,0
1628,1,3,I am so glad that I Bought this camera!!,-1,0
1628,1,4,The Large LCD screen is Spectacular as is the color in the photos.,-1,0
1628,1,5,My other cameras were a little larger so the size will take some getting used to.,-1,0
1628,1,6,The ONLY thing that I do not like is having to open the lens cover to take photos...but in the end this will protect the lens, because I dropped two of my Canons and messed up the lens.,-1,1
1628,1,7,Fantastic Camera all around!!! :),-1,0
1629,1,0,Excellent Camera.,-1,0
1629,1,1,I would buy it again.I would ask SONY to change a few things: 1) The power and shutter buttons are too flush and difficult to feel in the dark.,-1,1
1629,1,2,2) The battery/memory stick panel opens too easily when pulling the camera out of a pocket or tight spot.,-1,1
1629,1,3,3) Most importantly for me, the shutter does not click fast enough.,-1,1
1629,1,4,Being an SLR user, I am used to instant reaction speed between the moment I press the button and the moment the shutter clicks.,-1,1
1629,1,5,So much movement occurs by the subject in the 1 to 4 seconds (depending on lighting) it takes the shutter to click on this Cybershot.,-1,1
1629,1,6,I wonder if point and shoot cameras like this one could do better.,-1,1
1629,1,7,4) Reviewing photos after a shot ... is too slow.,-1,1
1629,1,8,Surely, the last photo can be put into a memory buffer to immediately be shown when the review button is pressed.,-1,1
1629,1,9,Instead it takes ... 3 to 5 seconds because you have to wait for the current photo to be processed and then wait wait wait to press the review button and if you press it twice ... oops, your still in picture-taking mode.,-1,1
1629,1,10,5) Come on SONY!! What is it about the ridiculous proprietary connections you put on your cameras.,-1,1
1629,1,11,What can't a mini USB connection do?,-1,1
1629,1,12,Furthermore, surely, SONY could ALSO enable battery charging from the USB.6),-1,1
1629,1,13,Internal Memory.,-1,1
1629,1,14,ha ha ha, Don't be fooled.,-1,1
1629,1,15,It only stores ... 2 shots.What I like: 1) The HD video is amazing as has the ability to zoom while filming.,-1,0
1629,1,16,2) The mode selection dial is easy to use. 3) In dark situations the camera will sometimes shoot without a flash and produce amazingly bright pictures avoiding the flash washout.,-1,0
1629,1,17,It also results in the ability to keep shooting snapshots without disrupting the subject with a bright flash.,-1,0
1629,1,18,4) Handheld Twightlight mode is amazing and results in excellent difficult to capture nighttime shots by shooting multiple pictures and having the camera derive a motionless image.,-1,0
1629,1,19,5) Panorama mode is so much fun and results in excellent shots.,-1,0
1629,1,20,We amuse ourselves with having the same person pose at the left of the picture and then run around and pose again on the right before we have panned over thus being in the shot twice.,-1,0
1629,1,21,Hours of fun and terrific pictures.,-1,0
1629,1,22,It pans from left, right, up and down.,-1,0
1629,1,23,7) Macro shots are clear and one can get awfully close.This camera is the next step in point and shoot category cameras regarding the light sensitivity and other features I've mentioned.,-1,0
1630,1,0,Excellent Low-light Camera.,-1,0
1630,1,1,If I could, I would probably give the WX1 4 1/2 stars.,-1,0
1630,1,2,It is excellent in low light.,-1,0
1630,1,3,I took it to New England's largest fair.,-1,0
1630,1,4,The night photos and videos of the amusement rides and parade came out very clear.,-1,0
1630,1,5,The shots inside the exhibit buildings also had nice color and clarity (all without flash and set to "P").,-1,0
1630,1,6,I also took it to the Providence Jack O'Lantern Spectacular and Waterfire (all outdoor night shots).,-1,0
1630,1,7,I used the "Hand-held Twilight" setting, and, again, the photos were sharp.,-1,0
1630,1,8,Comparing it to the Canon SX200 and Panasonic ZS3, I found that their low-light images were inferior to the WX1 (very noisy).,-1,0
1630,1,9,My macro photos have excellent color and detail.,-1,0
1630,1,10,As other people have stated, the outdoor daylight landscape photos are more washed out than the pictures taken with other cameras I own (Canon S90, Sony HX1, Panasonic ZS3).,-1,0
1630,1,11,They can be made somewhat better with adjustments, but I like to have good saturation without any adjustment.,-1,0
1630,1,12,Basically, I feel that the WX1 is an excellent camera to have when a person wants to carry something very light and small and will be taking mostly low-light and night photos.,-1,0
1630,1,13,Also, it is for someone, like me, who dislikes using flash because of the unnatural and stark appearance that it causes.,-1,0
1630,1,14,For this purpose, I would highly recommend the WX1.,-1,0
1631,1,0,Sorry Sony!,-1,0
1631,1,1,I usually love Sony products, but I'm no fan of their new TX1.,-1,0
1631,1,2,When I first saw this new camera, I thought this could me my next love, but we had a very short honeymoon - about 3 hours - then the ugly separation ensued!I'll be brief and to the point - the video was pretty good, but the pictures were actually horrible.,-1,0
1631,1,3,Instead of there being reduced noise as promised in news and reviews, there seems to be more (see my other reviews for most of the other cameras I've tried), even in bright light.,-1,0
1631,1,4,I'm pretty tech savvy and went through ALL of the setting, trying everything possible to get good consistent pictures, but to no avail!,-1,0
1631,1,5,We set the camera to various ISO settings to try and minimize the noise, but no good.,-1,0
1631,1,6,It just is not good for viewing on the big screen, it most likely be OK for 4 by 6 printing but I did not try to print my samples.,-1,0
1631,1,7,I have a media computer hooked up to my HDTV and the pictures just look terrible!I mentioned above that the video was good and this is true - and I knew this going in - but why did Sony remove the stereo recording?,-1,1
1631,1,8,If the pictures and other features where good, the lack of stereo would have been OK, but WOW what a disappointment all around.This is just my opinion!,-1,1
1631,1,9,I wish these camera makers would actually improve with subsequent models - I just don't get it!,-1,1
1631,1,10,Sorry Sony.,-1,1
1631,1,11,Oh and one more thing, don't tell me to just get a DSLR or it's just a P &S; - I know that already!,-1,1
1631,1,12,I just want the cameras to live up to their billing!,-1,1
1631,1,13,By the way, I have the Panasonic ZS3 and it BLOWS the Sony away.,-1,1
1632,1,0,Improved low-light performance but a maxium exposure time of 1 second.,-1,0
1632,1,1,What makes this camera unique is its promises of excellent low-light performance.,-1,0
1632,1,2,Compared to my old Nikon Coolpix S1, the TX1 only requires half the exposure time.,-1,1
1632,1,3,However, the TX1 is limited to a maximum shutter of only 1 second!,-1,1
1632,1,4,This kills an otherwise great night-time camera.,-1,1
1632,1,5,You can jack up the ISO to compensate, but this feature is buried in a menu (as is EV compensation).,-1,1
1632,1,6,As with most compact cameras, image noise is a significant problem.,-1,1
1632,1,7,Even in daytime scenes at ISO 125 there was enough noise to make me change into 5 megapixel mode.,-1,1
1632,1,8,What the camera does have going for it is a very slim profile.So to summarize: It's a great camera for the push-just-one-button crowd but will drive more advanced users crazy.,-1,1
1632,1,9,I'll probably return mine for a Lumix TS1,-1,1
1633,1,0,Best point and shoot available.,-1,0
1633,1,1,Simply an excellent pocket cam with solid picture quality.,-1,0
1633,1,2,There isnt another camera in this class that can shoot low light like this.,-1,0
1633,1,3,The Panorama features, HD video, and other features make this a no brainer.,-1,0
1634,1,0,Former DSLR owner.,-1,1
1634,1,1,As a former owner of a Sony A700 with 16-80mm Carl z lenses, plus a whole bag of long range lenses.,-1,1
1634,1,2,Dealing with toting all that stuff around, cleaning lenses, I finally got sick of it and sold everything on eBay and bought this camera, sure the image quality will never touch the A700 DSLR but I find the joy of photography is having a camera always with you.,-1,1
1634,1,3,The 24mm f2.4 lens is it's best feature, don't let anyone else fool you.,-1,0
1634,1,4,Wide angle is the best feature of any camera, I find you can always walk closer but that wide angle comes in so handy in real estate photos (makes the room look bigger), group photos, cramped spaces, The burst mode is handy (10fps is amazing in such a small camera), the panorama pictures are truly amazing, no more stitching photos together in Photoshop.I have owned digital cameras all the way back to the 1999 sony mavica (floppy disk memory) and progressed up to the DSLR.,-1,0
1634,1,5,I dont think I will get back into DSLR due to the bulky, expensive, complex (think dust on your sensor from lens changing).The price of $259 is mind blowing too given all these features.,-1,0
1634,1,6,I hoped I helped you in some way.,-1,0
1635,1,0,Quick and once you get use to the touch screen easy to use! Just took this pocket rocket to San Diego on a trip and it turned out some very good shots in low light and regular day time lighting.,-1,1
1635,1,1,I shoot mostly SLRs D90 and D700 Nikon, so I am not going to compare thosecameras to this one.,-1,1
1635,1,2,Wife wanted the camera equipment to stay home so it did.,-1,1
1635,1,3,This fits right into a pants pocket and or shirt pocket with easy, it powers up fast and takes some great shots when adjustments are madeto the environment you shooting in.Pros:Easy too use, learning curve low once you get use to the touch screen.Low light shots very good, and outside shots very good as well.small,-1,0
1635,1,4,and compact easy to take anywhere.Excellent sensor used in some SLRs and works very well in this compact camera.Consistently of the shots are very good.Very good HD 720p Video footage.Image stab.,-1,0
1635,1,5,excellent.Cons:Audio not so good when recording HD video, but most compact cameras are horrible at this task.Colors some times a tad off, but for the most part very good.Battery could be better.Rocker where you zoom in could be on the side of the camera instead of the top and a tad small to use.Over all if you can find this camera for under $300 now, it is a steal at that price.Other camers used in the pocket area... Canon 880/Casio Z750/Nikon S52I been waiting for the best pocket rocket camera to use, and I still have not come close to finding it, so far this oneisn't bad, better than most and I would call it a tie between my Canon 880, but the Sony wins out on compact.,-1,1
1636,1,0,If You Like Noisy Red Photos....,-1,0
1636,1,1,I had high hopes for this Sony, and even went to the trouble of buying a 16GB Memory Stick Duo (hate their proprietary attitude) and an extra battery.,-1,0
1636,1,2,While I like the size, twilight and panoramic features - there are several things that add up to a deal-breaker:- Noisy photos.,-1,0
1636,1,3,Grainy, even in bright sunlight.,-1,0
1636,1,4,How is that possible?! (for the answer, see the next line item)- No manual controls.,-1,1
1636,1,5,This camera doesn't offer you the ability to control much at all, notably - no sharpness, saturation, contrast, etc.- Lens+flash placement = big ugly shadow in the lower left of the frame when shooting at wide angle with flash.,-1,1
1636,1,6,This is completely unacceptable.,-1,1
1636,1,7,Did anyone at Sony even take this camera out for a night before shipping it?-,-1,1
1636,1,8,Shadows and low light shots even with flash end up RED!- (minor) Placement of on/off button is too far left for one-handed turning on/off.-,-1,0
1636,1,9,(minor) Menus are not intuitive or user-friendly.,-1,0
1636,1,10,For example: FOUR button pushes to delete a shot you just took.Sadly, I won't be keeping this thing.,-1,0
1637,1,0,I own cameras in this size range because they will fit easily enough in my pants, shirt or coat pocket.,-1,0
1637,1,1,Depending on the circumstances, you might be able to take an image worth framing, and they are handy for recording still or video information in stores, etc.Lately, I have been carrying a Canon PowerShot SD780IS, which is only slightly thinner than the WX1 but considerably less boxy.,-1,0
1637,1,2,Also, I tried a Canon SD940IS.,-1,1
1637,1,3,It has an apparent advantage of being 28mm/f2.8 at the wide end as opposed to 33mm/f3.2 for the SD780IS, but I concluded from my own testing that the image quality was worse, especially at ISO400 where the images were more washed out due to noise reduction.On paper, the Sony WX1 looks like it should blow the two Canon's away with a newly designed "lower-noise" sensor, fewer megapixels, and 24mm/f2.4 at the wide end.,-1,1
1637,1,4,In my own comparison (same scene, same lighting using a tripod), I found this not to be the case.,-1,1
1637,1,5,At its lowest ISO setting of 160, the WX1 is considerably noisier than ISO80 on the SD780IS at comparable apertures.,-1,1
1637,1,6,At ISO400 the noise levels are roughly equivalent, although the Sony tends to underexpose.When reviewing photos, the screen could use a few higher zoom levels; panoramic shots including text or other fine details cannot be magnified enough for easy legibility.On the plus side, 24mm-120mm is a very useful zoom range, the lens quality is pretty good, and the image stabilization appears superior to Canon's from my handheld comparisons indoors.,-1,1
1637,1,7,I did not compare the movie modes, which have similar specifications.[Appended,-1,1
1637,1,8,clarification: This camera can be effective in low light situations provided you are able to frame your shots at full wide angle (24mm/f2.4),,-1,1
1637,1,9,which will minimize exposure time and, hence, sensor noise.,-1,1
1637,1,10,Also, the Handheld Twilight mode (See WX1 features) works effectively.]I,-1,1
1637,1,11,should note that, if you are willing to carry a somewhat larger portable, you can get substantially better image quality.,-1,1
1637,1,12,My FinePix F200EXR produces cleaner images than any of the cameras mentioned above.,-1,1
1637,1,13,Recently posted samples from the not yet available Canon PowerShot S90 appear better still.,-1,1
1638,1,0,I love this little camera...and I mean little.,-1,1
1638,1,1,I've had many many many cameras over the past few year and this little wonder isn't going any place soon.I've DSLRs which were too big and bulky to carry around so I'd miss a shot.,-1,1
1638,1,2,Or the low light capabilities on pocket cameras are horrible, so you miss the shot.,-1,1
1638,1,3,The Sony DSC-WX1 solves both of these issues.And the panorama sweep feature is really cool.,-1,1
1639,1,0,Had High Hopes - Defective Product.,-1,1
1639,1,1,Hi folks: I am the director of photography for a television series.,-1,1
1639,1,2,We have been using Sony professional broadcast studio equipment for 20 years without failures and I could not be happier.,-1,1
1639,1,3,We recently purchased this camera for "behind the scenes" snaps at our location shootings.,-1,1
1639,1,4,Please note: this camera was not purchased from Amazon, but instead, a local retailer serving professional photographers in Los Angeles.I had high hopes for this camera but alas, the images I got were not that impressive, excepting the panorama which was strikingly good and the camera malfunctioned very quickly needing repair.,-1,1
1639,1,5,I found the menus a bit confusing and not intuitive even though I am an iPhone junkie and very tech savvy.,-1,1
1639,1,6,Admittidly, I probably needed to spend more quality time learning all of the functions but I bought the camera for super fast point and shoot in a variety of lighting conditions.In any event, two weeks after purchase (and one actual location use), the zoom function of the camera malfunctioned and started engaging automaticly regardless of mode.,-1,1
1639,1,7,The only way to stop the camera from zooming in, is to turn it off.,-1,1
1639,1,8,I reported the problem 32 days after buying so I was out of luck with the retailer.,-1,1
1639,1,9,Sony said they would repair the camera but that means shipping, waiting, and considerable trouble.,-1,1
1639,1,10,And, when directed to the service website to make a repair request, that malfunctioned too.,-1,1
1639,1,11,It could be just some bad luck today but I'm not happy at all.Moral of the story: check the zoom function before you buy if possible.,-1,1
1639,1,12,If not, make sure you check it before your 30 day return option expires,-1,1
1640,1,0,I had really high hopes for this camera.,-1,1
1640,1,1,Great size, low light capability, panorama, high speed burst, and HD video with optical zoom.,-1,1
1640,1,2,Well, 2 out of 5 doesn't cut it compared to other cameras available today.,-1,1
1640,1,3,The size and video are great.,-1,1
1640,1,4,The low light capability was good, but not that much better than my Sony H20.,-1,1
1640,1,5,The big disappointmet was the bright light image quality.,-1,1
1640,1,6,It was NOT good at all.,-1,0
1640,1,7,The images did not have good focus; they just weren't sharp and the color was not nearly as good as other point and shoot camera I have or am very familiar with.,-1,0
1640,1,8,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.,-1,1
1640,1,9,Also the panorama works as advertised except the image quality is terrible.,-1,1
1640,1,10,HIgh speed burst did work well for speed but image quality again was lacking.,-1,1
1640,1,11,Overall I am being nice giving it a 3.I really wanted to love this camera, but no way.,-1,1
1640,1,12,It went back after about 300 pictures of varying types.,-1,1
1641,1,0,AWESOME point-and-shoot camera.,-1,0
1641,1,1,Sony finally made a breakthrough in making a great point-and-shoot camera with the TX1.,-1,0
1641,1,2,Great features, simple and easy to use settings.,-1,0
1641,1,3,Great even in low lighted area.The bad side: The rocker/toggle switch used to zooming in and out the lens is fragile!,-1,1
1641,1,4,After one year of use the rocker/toggle switch broke.,-1,1
1641,1,5,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.,-1,1
1642,1,0,Great Camera.,-1,0
1642,1,1,Great camera.,-1,0
1642,1,2,Very small (fits in a pocket) and very easy to use.,-1,0
1642,1,3,Most pictures come out great.,-1,0
1642,1,4,There are some issues with over exposure at times, but in general I love this camera.,-1,0
1642,1,5,One other very minor quirk is that due to the shape & size, it's very easy for your finger to make its way into the picture.,-1,0
1642,1,6,Have to get use to holding it from the edges.,-1,0
1642,1,7,I'd recommend this camera to others.,-1,0
1643,1,0,Best compact digital camera I've owned so far!,-1,0
1643,1,1,I've had this camera for about a month now.,-1,0
1643,1,2,I did purchase this camera elsewhere.,-1,0
1643,1,3,I simply love this camera!,-1,0
1643,1,4,I've had other Sony Cybershots, most recently, the W170.,-1,0
1643,1,5,But this one is the best so far.,-1,0
1643,1,6,I love the compactness and portability as well as its sleek, stylish design.,-1,0
1643,1,7,The touchscreen is very responsive and easy to use.,-1,0
1643,1,8,I thought that it would take some getting used to, but the learning curve was very minimal.,-1,0
1643,1,9,Being able to get to the various menu items by touching the screen is easy and intuitive despite some comments I've read.The pictures I took during the holidays came out really nice.,-1,0
1643,1,10,I love the intelligent mode where the camera will take two shots to ensure that you get a good shot depending on the conditions.,-1,0
1643,1,11,One reason I purchased this new camera was because I wanted the sports and pet mode.,-1,0
1643,1,12,Whenever I took action shots or shots of kids or pets with the W170, the pictures would always come out blurry.,-1,0
1643,1,13,Every shot is clear with no blurriness.,-1,0
1643,1,14,I was extremely surprised by the quality of the videos too.,-1,0
1643,1,15,The HD quality was quite impressive.,-1,0
1643,1,16,I've shared them with friends and family and they've all commented on how clear they are.I plan to take this camera with me to Japan and can't wait to take photos there.,-1,0
1643,1,17,I still have to learn more about this camera and experiment more.,-1,0
1643,1,18,I truly believe you'll be very happy if you decide to purchase this camera.,-1,0
1644,1,0,I love this camera.,-1,0
1644,1,1,I have a very expensive DSLR which takes much better pictures than the TX1.,-1,0
1644,1,2,The problem is the DSLR doesn't fit in my pocket.I carry the TX1 all the time.,-1,0
1644,1,3,It has an anti-blur mode which is awesome indoors without a flash.,-1,0
1644,1,4,It's perfect for still objects, as in a museum or store.,-1,0
1644,1,5,Remarkable, actually.The touch screen is easy to use.,-1,0
1644,1,6,Focus is fast.,-1,0
1645,1,0,Awesome camera.,-1,0
1645,1,1,I have really been amazed by this camera.,-1,0
1645,1,2,I've had several digital cameras in the past and this one is the best yet.,-1,0
1645,1,3,For starters it has 10 megapixels and the CMOS technology maximizes the quality.,-1,0
1645,1,4,I really love the hand held twilight mode that allows you to take shots in extreme low light.,-1,0
1645,1,5,It uses a compositing technology to get rid of all the noise you would get with other cameras.,-1,0
1645,1,6,It is amazing.,-1,0
1645,1,7,I also love the video quality.,-1,0
1645,1,8,I use it for my blog and the picture quality and audio are great.,-1,0
1645,1,9,I do wish it had a microphone input but that is probably expecting too much for a small camera.,-1,0
1645,1,10,Another great feature is the lens cover that acts as an on/off switch.,-1,1
1645,1,11,It is so much better than the cameras that have the protruding lens that extends when open.,-1,1
1645,1,12,Those can pose some problems when they open when they shouldn't (like in your pocket).The large touch screen makes everything easy.,-1,1
1645,1,13,This is my first touch screen camera and I won't be going back to the old scroll method.,-1,1
1645,1,14,If the camera has trouble focusing you simply touch the screen where you want it to focus and it focuses on that spot.,-1,1
1645,1,15,This is great if you are shooting something up close or have both distant and close objects in the finder.The telephoto works great.,-1,0
1645,1,16,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).,-1,0
1645,1,17,The battery charger is well designed with no cord so it is easy to carry around.,-1,0
1645,1,18,I bought an 8 gig card for it and it seems adequate so far.This is a great product that has really worked well for me.,-1,0
1645,1,19,As I mentioned I use it for my blog but have also used it for photographs for final use in magazine publication.,-1,0
1645,1,20,In short, this camera is a real work horse.,-1,0
1646,1,0,Great Camera.,-1,0
1646,1,1,I really love this camera.,-1,0
1646,1,2,I have had it for about a month now and love taking pics and video.,-1,0
1646,1,3,The video quality is excellent.,-1,0
1646,1,4,I am still learning how to play with the camera settings, such as focus front and back, etc....but overall the picture quality is good.,-1,0
1646,1,5,Is it equivalent to my SLR, no, but thats not expected.,-1,0
1646,1,6,I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a very compact camera, with good quality pictures (maybe not the best, but definitely good), and more features then you could possibly imagine.,-1,0
1646,1,7,The panorama option is fantastic, takes absolutely incredible pictures of my dogs (in pet mode), and the low light shots come out better then any other point and shoot I have ever had (including my bf canon).,-1,0
1646,1,8,For those who purchase it, ENJOY!,-1,0
1647,1,0,After a LOT of research, I decided to bite the bullet and get this camera.,-1,0
1647,1,1,I wanted the following: 1) crisp, good pictures 2) good low-light capabilities 3) portability--small but powerful and 4)HD video.,-1,0
1647,1,2,I had only owned Canon cameras before and was very hesitant to try another brand, but it was a good decision to take the plunge.,-1,0
1648,1,0,Sleek but Frustrating - Returned.,-1,1
1648,1,1,This camera arrived 2 days before I left on vacation.,-1,1
1648,1,2,I loved the sleek, slim shape, large screen, and clear pictures.,-1,1
1648,1,3,It fit in my pocket so easily to carry around.,-1,1
1648,1,4,Took great pictures in low light.,-1,1
1648,1,5,But the Touch Screen drove me crazy.,-1,1
1648,1,6,Worst was that the Trash can icon was in the lower left corner where my thumb kept touching.,-1,1
1648,1,7,It would come up with a choice of Delete this Picture on the left and Delete all Pictures on the right side of the screen.,-1,1
1648,1,8,I carefully cancelled out of either.,-1,1
1648,1,9,When I got home from my 7 day trip, I realized that the first 5 days of my vacation had been deleted without my even knowing it.,-1,1
1648,1,10,The all seemed to disappear at the point when I asked someone to take our picture.,-1,1
1648,1,11,I suspect that they accidentally hit the trash can with the left hand thumb and then inadvertenly touched the Delete All Pictures choice with their right thumb.,-1,1
1648,1,12,With the first 100 pictures of my trip gone I decided I didn't want to be stressed out every time I ask someone to take a picture of us, not to mention the stress of keeping myself from doing it.,-1,1
1648,1,13,I returned the camera and am now thrilled with my Canon Powershot that has easy to use dials instead of a touch screen and takes great pictures.,-1,1
1649,1,0,Had lots of hope.,-1,1
1649,1,1,I had a lot of hope for the Exmor sensor.,-1,1
1649,1,2,I bought the camera last week and took shots for a few hours and compared against my relatively old Fuji Finepix f40fd.The good:1) Cool features.,-1,0
1649,1,3,Smile detection worked great for my kids.,-1,0
1649,1,4,The panorama shots were very cool also.2) Nice size.,-1,0
1649,1,5,Light and small for the lens range.3),-1,1
1649,1,6,Quick focusThe bad:1) The only reason I returned it was the biggest.,-1,1
1649,1,7,Image quality was not what I expected.,-1,1
1649,1,8,Low light shots were noisier than my Fuji.,-1,1
1649,1,9,This was my main reason for purchase, and it failed my test.2),-1,1
1649,1,10,No bevel to the LCD frame.,-1,1
1649,1,11,The LCD plastic sits at the highest point on the back of the camera.,-1,1
1649,1,12,I've had a couple cameras like this and the clear plastic gets scratched quickly.,-1,1
1649,1,13,The Fuji is a little recessed into its frame and that makes all the difference.3),-1,1
1649,1,14,Battery door easily opened.,-1,1
1649,1,15,I place my thumb along the bottom edge right where the battery cover it and there is no lip to keep your thumb from sliding the door open.,-1,1
1649,1,16,I did this at least a couple of times.,-1,1
1649,1,17,Not a killer, but annoying.I had great hopes for the picture quality that were not met.,-1,0
1649,1,18,Otherwise this is a great little camera with nice features.,-1,0
1650,1,0,Impressed by this tiny gadget.,-1,1
1650,1,1,Bought this camera despite reading all the negative reviews and I must say, I'm glad I did.,-1,1
1650,1,2,I own a DSLR and find it wierd lugging it around just to shoot a couple of casual, usually indoor pics, especially if you're shooting objects like food.,-1,1
1650,1,3,Hence I was looking for an ultra compact that performs well under low lighting.,-1,1
1650,1,4,Although the picture quality isn't the best, I'll give you 3 valid reasons why I chose the wx1.1),-1,1
1650,1,5,It has one of the lowest shutter lag.,-1,0
1650,1,6,See for yourself: [...].What's the point of the best picture quality you missed capturing the moment because of poor shutter lag?2) Excellent battery life.,-1,0
1650,1,7,Takes up to 350 shots on a single charge!,-1,0
1650,1,8,How's that for an ultra compact that's almost the size of an iphone?,-1,0
1650,1,9,Taking in consideration, its sterling performance too.3),-1,0
1650,1,10,Excellent low lighting performance.,-1,0
1650,1,11,Other point and shoot cams may take better outdoor pics, but who cares?,-1,0
1650,1,12,I have a DSLR that can do that.Conclusion:,-1,0
1650,1,13,This tiny baby makes a perfect companion if you already own an SLR.,-1,0
1650,1,14,Its size shutter lag and low lighting performance makes it a must have if you are looking for something that will go where no SLR will go or feels right going.,-1,0
1650,1,15,If you're looking for a versatile compact travel camera that's good in all aspects, look elsewhere.,-1,0
1651,1,0,nothing better.,-1,1
1651,1,1,I am a dentist and got this camera (WX1) for dental photos with the sony LED ring light.,-1,1
1651,1,2,This is the best point and shhot camera that i have used, hands down.,-1,0
1651,1,3,and yes as many reviewers have pointed out there is a dark shadow on the left bottom of the picture when the flash is used, but hey who uses a flash when u can get such awsome photos in low light conditions.,-1,0
1652,1,0,Excellent buy for its price; a really good little camera.,-1,0
1652,1,1,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.,-1,0
1652,1,2,Picture quality is better than I have had on past cameras, and come out pretty well.,-1,0
1652,1,3,Very small and portable, and amazing value.,-1,0
1652,1,4,Zoom is basically absent here, but I don't have a problem with it (especially for the price).,-1,1
1653,1,0,Love my new Cyber-shot.,-1,0
1653,1,1,Super fast delivery, arrived in great condition and is lots of fun to use.,-1,0
1653,1,2,Took it with us to the mountains and love the panoramic feature.,-1,0
1653,1,3,What shots I took!,-1,0
1653,1,4,Also took it to dinner with our prospective in-laws...9 people sitting at a round table.,-1,0
1653,1,5,The waiter was walking around the table trying to take shots to get "everyone" in as many pictures as she could.,-1,0
1653,1,6,I whipped out my TX1, set the panoramic function, and panned around the table and got everyone in one photo (except me, of course).,-1,0
1653,1,7,I think that sold two people at the table on going home and ordering them a new camera.,-1,1
1653,1,8,I ordered mine in pink, in an effort to keep my husband's paws off it (he has his own Cyber-Shot that doesn't have panoramic function).,-1,1
1653,1,9,He's picked it up a couple of times, but hasn't yet figured out how to work it...heaven help he should actually READ the manual (which I suggest).,-1,1
1653,1,10,I'm not a techno wizard, but this camera is pretty easy to use (I do suggest reading the manual because the camera has lots of cool functions) and the photo quality is great.,-1,0
1654,1,0,The Best point and shoot for the technology challenged!,-1,0
1654,1,1,The pictures this camera captures are all the ones my prior camera was missing or blurring.,-1,0
1654,1,2,I just love the super fast shots and twilight images.,-1,0
1654,1,3,If you are "technology challenged" then this camera will do all the work for you and make you look like a pro!,-1,0
1655,1,0,An amateur photographer, I enjoy having this camera where my SLR can't or shouldn't go (say a packed bar).,-1,0
1655,1,1,It's still no SLR, but it's night shooting capabilities without flash along with it's small portable size were more than worth it for me.,-1,0
1655,1,2,You'd expect excellent quality with normal lighting, but it's more like above average for the price range and lens.,-1,1
1655,1,3,I got it from the Amazon warehouse, so the used price helped make it more palatable plus it's arrival in 2 days thanks to Prime!,-1,1
1656,1,0,Excellent pictures with the right lighting.,-1,0
1656,1,1,I have been using Sony digicams for almost 10 years now.,-1,0
1656,1,2,I was always impressed with their speed, size, and the great pictures I would get from them.,-1,0
1656,1,3,As the go to guy to take pictures at birthday parties, reunions, school plays, etc, I rely heavily on my cameras and I can't be left with a camera that won't cut it.,-1,0
1656,1,4,Start up time is super quick, ensuring that I can go from having the camera in my pocket, to turning it on, and getting the shot.,-1,0
1656,1,5,The high speed mode is one of the best I have seen in a small digicam.,-1,0
1656,1,6,Of course it does not equal my slr, but I am very impressed with the pictures I yield from it.,-1,0
1656,1,7,The new panaramic feature is very fun and I really like using the many scene modes the camera offers.Many people complain about the memory stick.,-1,1
1656,1,8,Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.,-1,1
1656,1,9,Now the SD cards have finally caught up to the speed of the MS.,-1,1
1656,1,10,With that, I do not mind paying $20 for a 4GB memory stick pro.,-1,1
1656,1,11,Since my other cameras have been Sony cameras, I have already had memory stick cards and readers, so to me, its not a big deal.,-1,1
1656,1,12,If you have had other cameras that used SD, just think of making a $20 investment into a very reliable, fast card for your camera, and use the SD card in your Wii.The only two complaints I have for this camera are it's low light picture taking, and the format it uses when recording video.,-1,1
1656,1,13,The low light picture taking is always a problem with cameras this size.,-1,1
1656,1,14,I can still take decent pictures of a rock concert from high up, or a sporting event from the nose bleed sections.,-1,1
1656,1,15,Birthday party pictures come out good as well.,-1,1
1656,1,16,I do notice that some of the action shots I take in low light situations tend to be on the softer side.,-1,1
1656,1,17,With video recording, I was very happy to finally be able to zoom in and out while recording, however, I am not happy that it records in mp4 format.,-1,1
1656,1,18,Usually, I use the digicam to record home movies, and then view them using media player before putting them on dvd.,-1,1
1656,1,19,Now, I have to convert them to mpg format (which is what the other cameras used to record in).,-1,1
1656,1,20,Just an extra step I shouldn't have to be bothered with.,-1,1
1657,1,0,Best Tiny Portable Camera Available, only a few drawbacks.,-1,0
1657,1,1,I love this camera!GREAT THINGS about this: The slim design with a built-in cover to protect the lens instead of needing a lens cap is great.,-1,0
1657,1,2,The low-light modes are amazing, especially when compared to other compact cameras.,-1,0
1657,1,3,The speed and auto-focusing are good.,-1,0
1657,1,4,The HD movies are terrific, if you can hold it steady enough the footage looks like something from a much bigger camera.,-1,0
1657,1,5,The digicam has a wealth of cutting-edge electronic features: digital panorama stitching in the camera, automatic multi-exposure low light shots, all kinds of shooting modes, blink prevention, smile detection, touching the touch screen to focus on things, nice playback controls such as a calendar display to view images and movies by the date they were taken, etc.,-1,1
1657,1,6,These functions really work as advertised, although the sweep panoramas I've gotten so far haven't been as good quality as what I could have stitched together on my PC.Not so great: The TX1 doesn't have a full manual control over shutter speed and aperture (although you can choose different shooting modes that tend to favor wide apertures or fast or slow shutter speeds, and you can manually set the ISO and EV.) There's no exposure bracketing mode.,-1,1
1657,1,7,The lack of auto bracketing is especially surprising because the camera does nice burst-mode high-speed sets, it just has no option to take the shots with different exposures.,-1,1
1657,1,8,It can't shoot RAW files, only .jpg and movie files, although I plan to experiment with the DRO mode that might prevent highlights from looking clipped in some cases.,-1,1
1657,1,9,The price is somewhat high, but I guess that's what always happens with the hottest new camera model of the year.,-1,1
1658,1,0,For it's size it's great.,-1,1
1658,1,1,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.,-1,1
1658,1,2,The zoom is difficult to use it moves to fast.,-1,1
1658,1,3,It should have a viewfinder a bit hard to see in direct sunlight.,-1,1
1658,1,4,One thing that really bugs me is that Sony does not make a HDMI cable for the tx1.,-1,1
1658,1,5,Don't know why.,-1,1
1658,1,6,About the video be sure and buy a fast chip if you want good video Sony pro duo is a bit to slow for action shots.,-1,0
1658,1,7,All in all I really love this camera and recommend it for video or stills.,-1,0
1659,1,0,I'm happy with this camera.,-1,0
1659,1,1,Just purchased this camera few days ago and I'm absolutely happy with it..,-1,0
1659,1,2,I read alot of reviews before I decided which one to buy because I needed a camera that is allowed in the concerts venue.. shoots a good HD video and good pictures in the dark!  and this was what I decided...I'm totally in love with the video quality... even the sound quality is good although it's mono mic..the picture quality is so good for such a compatable slim and light camera! the focus works really well.. loved the smile detection :) and the intelligent mode.. it automatically changes the mode due to the conditing.. it also can focus to multiple faces if you're taking the picture to more than one person.. you can also choose the focus priority (child or adult)!! how cool is that??,-1,0
1659,1,3,I wont forget the panoramic shoot it's so cool and new :)loved how pictures look in the dark...,-1,0
1659,1,4,I sometimes dont even need to use the flash!! yes sometimes you don't need the flash at night! it's perfect for night shootings..I only wish it has a button to switch from picture shooting to video... here you have to do it through the touch screen and it needs 2 clicks to switch..by the way the touch screen works wekk..,-1,1
1659,1,5,I read in some reviews people complaining about it's touch screen.. but it works well with either with stylus or my finger..it's a cool camera and I recommend it to people who needs a small compatable stylish camera that can be slipped in the jeans pocket :) people who needs to shoot HD video with a small camera.. if you need a camera for stunning picture quality go for SLR coz this is not the one.. but for everyday use it's amazing :)this is a link for the video test I took with this camera :) hope it's helpful[...],-1,1
1660,1,0,Best Point & Shoot Digital Camera I Ever Got ;) SONY TX1.,-1,0
1660,1,1,I just ordered this camera a couple days ago , so far been testing every feature it has.,-1,0
1660,1,2,twilight mode is amazing you don't need to use flash at all to take your pictures due to the great EXMOR R sensor and thats exactly what i have been waiting for in a camera all this time, i hate using flash truly because i feel that it ruins all the detail and the beauty of the picture.,-1,0
1660,1,3,I didn't try sweep panorama yet but i bet its gonna be awesome ;) im gonna give it a shot this weekend ;) and the color blue for this camera is beautiful ;) , before buying this camera i owned another tx1 with the color Grey but i thought that the color was quite boring.,-1,0
1660,1,4,The touch screen is quite responsive and sensitive.I got the 8GB PRO - HG DUO memory card works well with the sony tx1 and comes with an USB adapter which is pretty useful ;).Overall Great Awesome Camera ;) To Own* 10MP is great and is more than enough ( unless your taking pictures for huge billboards )* Handles Well In Low Light Photography ( EMOR R )* Works Well With PRO HG DUO Cards* 720P HD Video ;) ( Crisp in low light )* Great Build Quality ofcourse Made In JapanThank You :),-1,0
1661,1,0,Good but poor autofocus.,-1,1
1661,1,1,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.,-1,1
1661,1,2,Subject was four feet away, but the camera focused almost 6 feet away.,-1,1
1661,1,3,The subject was OK, but not tack sharp as what was hoped for.,-1,1
1662,1,0,Not overly impressed.,-1,0
1662,1,1,Granted, I've only been able to use the camera for a few weeks now, but I have to admit I'm not overly impressed.,-1,0
1662,1,2,I disregarded several of the negative reviews I read on this, trying to be optimistic, but that isn't working out for me.,-1,1
1662,1,3,The biggest negative I've noticed is indoor shots that require the flash are very grainy.,-1,1
1662,1,4,Much more grainy than my last Sony Cybershot was.,-1,1
1662,1,5,I haven't fiddled around with many of the settings yet, so perhaps it's a learning curve, however, the whole reason I got a point and shoot was so that I didn't have to worry about settings to grab a quick shot.Positives:  The ease of use is great.,-1,0
1662,1,6,I need to use reader glass for things up close, and the settings on this camera are big enough that I don't have to use my readers in order to change settings, or switch from video clips to shots.,-1,0
1662,1,7,I really like that.I'm hopeful I'll be able to dial in what I need on this camera and be able to count on awesome shots, but so far, I'm not getting the quality of pictures I'd hoped for with this 10 megapixel camera.,-1,0
1663,1,0,an excellent point and shoot.,-1,1
1663,1,1,I bought this camera to replace my Sony T90 point and shoot when it finally died.,-1,1
1663,1,2,This camera is a huge step-up from that model.,-1,1
1663,1,3,For one thing, it is extremely easy to use.,-1,0
1663,1,4,I figured out most of the settings without even reading the instructions.,-1,0
1663,1,5,It takes very clear photos in day light and at night time or low light conditions.,-1,0
1663,1,6,I have been having a ton of fun with the panoramic function.,-1,0
1663,1,7,It takes surprisingly very clear pictures in this mode as well.,-1,0
1663,1,8,As for the burst mode, it works pretty well too.,-1,0
1663,1,9,I used it at my daughters soccer game with great success.,-1,0
1663,1,10,Instead of the usual 3 pics, you have up to 10 to choose from.,-1,0
1663,1,11,Another feature I have been having fun with is the smile feature.,-1,0
1663,1,12,You can press an icon on the display for the camera to take a picture when the detected faces actually smile.,-1,1
1663,1,13,I have no idea how it does this but it does and it's very cool.,-1,1
1663,1,14,I know this camera is not a replacement for those full-sized jobs but it is a very nice camera that fits easily in your pocket and takes great pictures.,-1,1
1663,1,15,A solid purchase if you ask me.,-1,1
1664,1,0,definitely a worthwhile bump up from the dsc-t900 for a couple reasons... with all due respect to the reviewer who said this is not a worthy upgrade from the t-900........wrong wrong wrong.You get awesome burst mode (up to 10 shots in a second, better than far more pricey cams can provide), pano shooting made simple, great low-light filming, an improved touch interface...if those aren't good reasons for an upgrade, what is?the one minor disappointment: the loss of stereo sound to go with the hi def video shooting.,-1,1
1664,1,1,but the difference will only matter to real mavens, and the added benefits far outweigh this small nit.go get yourself one of these...it's an eye popper, well made, well designed, with performance that'll make you glad you made the investment.,-1,1
1665,1,0,Huge Disappointed.,-1,1
1665,1,1,I bought this product on Nov. 15, but once I got it and tried it out, I asked Amazon to return it real quick because of picture quality, which does not match with its price at all.I bought this camera because this one was supposed to be a good pocket camera for me;I have my expectation that it would be a good auto-mode camera.Yet, it is really disappointed that its automode does not do its job well.Seriously, comparing it with my Canon SD1100, my Canon gives me much better picture quality (colors, details, sharpness, and such).Only one good thing is Panorama feature, but it isn't good enough to spend this much moneyI am not a pro camera,so my terminology might not be precisely correct.Yet, I am smart enough to see what is a good picture like.Please consider really carefully if you want to buy this camera.Personally,,-1,1
1665,1,2,I do not recommend it.One more thing, this product is made in China: do not buy it if you mind it.,-1,1
1666,1,0,This Camera is So Much Fun, and Very Portable.,-1,0
1666,1,1,I purchased this camera for the Panorama mode, and low light shooting.,-1,0
1666,1,2,It should not be thought of as replacement for a large digital SLR like my $1,800 Nikon without lenses.,-1,0
1666,1,3,No, the quality of the photos is not in the league of the larger camera.,-1,0
1666,1,4,It is however surprisingly small and light, being the size of my cell phone and conveniently fitting in my shirt pocket.,-1,0
1666,1,5,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.,-1,0
1666,1,6,The anti-shake mode works quite well here.,-1,1
1666,1,7,I also used it for close ups of flowers and obtained surprisingly good quality, which at times nearly rival the Nikon with a macro lens.The really cool feature is the PANORAMA Mode.,-1,1
1666,1,8,I love it!,-1,1
1666,1,9,Besides the obvious use as seen in the ads, it works extraordinarily well in low light, and even outdoors at dusk.,-1,1
1666,1,10,It can also be used in a moving car shooting out of the window to capture a street.,-1,1
1666,1,11,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.,-1,1
1666,1,12,It just does not match my little Fuji or my large Sony cameras.,-1,1
1666,1,13,The sound is also disappointing.PROS:Lots of Fun to UseGreat Low Light PerformanceSmall SizeThere is a "Pet Mode" with very short shutter lag times in shootingThe photos sharpen nicely in Photoshop.,-1,0
1666,1,14,I highly recommend doing this!Wide angle 24 mm lens- WOW!Fantastic Panorama Mode even with low light at dusk or indoors, and much sharper than expected.,-1,1
1666,1,15,I would recommend turning the camera sideways and adjust the mode to obtain a wider horizontal image.Better photographic quality than expected from the other reviews - No it is not a replacement for an SLR, but it is so portable I always carry it around and obtain quite satisfactory images.CONS:Disappointing Video mode and soundShould not be thought of an only camera.,-1,1
1666,1,16,It is specialized as a small portable low light and panorama camera.,-1,1
1667,1,0,Good camera with an awful flaw in the design that affects some pictures.,-1,1
1667,1,1,I bought this camera two months ago and I must said the camera lives to the expectations about better low light pictures without flash among Point and Shoot cameras, it's far from perfect and this pictures has some noise and distortions but the noise is very well controlled compared to most PnS and the colors in low light are astounding.The BIG problem here is that there's a flaw in the design that will produce a dark area on the left in many close-up pictures taken with flash, after some investigation I found that it seems to be the lens getting in the way of the flash light in this kind of pictures that produce this odd behavior...,-1,1
1667,1,2,I sent the camera to Sony covered by warranty and customer service (very kindly I must say) told me that the camera was performing under specifications and even if they replaced it with a new one it will have the same flaw, so my only options were to exchange it for a different model or live with it...I'm amazed that they are still selling this camera (that isn't exactly cheap) with this awful flaw, maybe most people won't notice it if they don't take too much close up pictures but be aware of this problem if you're considering getting this camera.,-1,1
1668,1,0,Sony DSC-TX1 is pretty good quality, and fun to use.,-1,0
1668,1,1,Ok, Im not going to write a super detailed review on this product, just an overall impression on the picture quality (its a camera right?) and what I think of it.First of all this might be the best point and shoot camera for this price out there, I got to know the camera after I bought it, I did no research before buying which was kind of stupid but I got lucky, this is a great camera.Second of all, this is a cybershot, in my book its a synonym of quality camera, right out of the box you can notice the carl zeiss lens which is internationally known as the best camera lenses...So as to functionality, this camera is very simple to use, I'm not a photographer but after using the SWEEP PANORAMA mode I felt like one, its very good in low light conditions and I have to say that the touchscreen display shows picture in good definition and works very well.Disappointments are that while shooting video in HD is not that great compared to its photo taking abilities...,-1,0
1668,1,2,I shot a video in low light and I could barely see anything, but as to frame rate its awesome to shoot videos outside and sport events.,-1,0
1668,1,3,The zooming capabilities are kept to a max of 4X Optical zoom, which is fine but not great, and whe shooting macro the camera takes a really long time getting the focus "right" (again wont work in low light and by low light i mean inside your house with the lights on) even when on macro mode instead of auto.So im pretty happy with this camera and if you are wondering whether to buy it or not I would say that if you want a portable very hi-fi camera than go for this but if you care a lot about zoom, amazing picture quality go for an slr even though it cost 3 times more haha.,-1,0
1669,1,0,Great indoor picture quality.,-1,1
1669,1,1,I bought this camera because of the high ratings it received for indoor pictures.,-1,1
1669,1,2,I just returned a different camera because the shutter lag was horrible and so was the indoor picture quality.,-1,1
1669,1,3,The Sony Cyber-shot takes wonderful indoor / low light pictures with fast shutter speed.,-1,1
1669,1,4,It also gives you the option to have a twilight view or a "flash" view so that's a nice feature.The shipping company (OneCall) was terrific.,-1,1
1669,1,5,I requested for the package to be left at my door with no signature so the shipping company called me within a few minutes to ensure that he would take care of this and gave me his cell phone number in case I needed it.,-1,1
1669,1,6,Great customer service.,-1,1
1670,1,0,I bought this camera as a replacement for an older version of Sony Cybershot.,-1,1
1670,1,1,So far, it is working great for me.,-1,0
1670,1,2,It is very light and easy to carry.,-1,0
1670,1,3,I have to get used to the portability and weight of it since my previous camera is more on the chunky size.,-1,0
1670,1,4,The only thing I don't like about it so far is that it doesn't have the feature of imprinting the date on the picture automatically.,-1,0
1670,1,5,It also has a touch screen feature which I'm not so fond of.,-1,0
1670,1,6,The screen gets smudged so easily.,-1,0
1670,1,7,The good thing though is that it comes with a little stick that you can use instead of your finger to access the camera functions.So far, so good.,-1,0
1670,1,8,A great camera.,-1,0
1671,1,0,AWESOME CAMERA!!!,-1,0
1671,1,1,I used to always buy Casio for my point and shoots, my SLR is also a NIKON but I've only heard great things about Sony from my friends only downside being the battery life so I made sure to buy an extra battery...apparently they've improved on that issue and the battery life has been fine.,-1,1
1671,1,2,The panoramic option is so cool and it plays back on the camera from start to finish.,-1,1
1671,1,3,The touch screen is very intuitive and responsive.,-1,1
1671,1,4,The zoom capabilities and low-light shooting is unlike any point and shoot I've owned.,-1,1
1671,1,5,There are in camera-editing capabilities plus preset scene options that actually work!,-1,1
1671,1,6,The quality of the shots are comparable to my high-end SLR so it's perfect for on the go when I don't want to lug around my big camera bag.,-1,1
1671,1,7,It fits in my pocket and since the lens doesn't zoom outwards it's fast and ideal for quick shots.,-1,1
1671,1,8,I highly recommend this crazy good camera....may want to get a case though if you want to protect the screen while it's in your bag or wherever.,-1,1
1672,1,0,Amazing camera for everyday use!,-1,0
1672,1,1,I won't pretend to know the lingo's and spec's that professional (or even amateur) photographers use, all I know is that this camera works great for my everyday needs.,-1,0
1672,1,2,I've had this camera for 2 weeks now and I've shot a weekend cabin trip, my dog at the park and some potential properties for my company and I have to say... it's amazing!,-1,0
1672,1,3,I love that it doesn't have a touch screen (I don't have the patience for those) which adds to it's ease of use.,-1,0
1672,1,4,The camera size is perfect for carrying in your pack or cargo pocket (it's a little large for reg.,-1,0
1672,1,5,pant pockets in my opinion) and I love the 5x optical zoom.,-1,0
1672,1,6,All my shots have turned out great!,-1,0
1672,1,7,I love the low light shots of my dog indoors and the panoramic is great as well.,-1,0
1672,1,8,The other neat thing about the panoramic shot is that you can view the motion of the panoramic when you are viewing those photos on your camera (hope that makes sense).,-1,1
1672,1,9,Basically when reviewing panoramic shots on your cam, you can see the entire flow of motion from when you took the shot:)  Oh, and I dropped the camera on my 2nd day of owning it (outside, on my concrete driveway at that!) and it didn't affect performance at all.,-1,1
1672,1,10,I just have a small ding on one of the corners of the unit.,-1,1
1672,1,11,I've had a Sony DSC T1 (5MP) for the past 7 years and felt it was time to upgrade.,-1,1
1672,1,12,I was looking for better zoom while still maintaining the compact feel.,-1,1
1672,1,13,I did all my research (reading product reviews from Amazon, CNET, BestBuy etc.) and decided to try out the WX1 and I'm glad I did.,-1,1
1672,1,14,I will update my review as I use it more (I have a trip to Disney world coming up so I'm sure it will get plenty of use :).,-1,1
1673,1,0,Great features not so great picture quality.,-1,0
1673,1,1,We have had many Sony cyber shot cameras over the past 3 years.,-1,0
1673,1,2,Each one is better then the last.,-1,0
1673,1,3,the TX-1 has really cool functions.,-1,0
1673,1,4,The first being the panorama mode, it pieces many photos together to create one long seamless photo.,-1,0
1673,1,5,Great for traveling and sight seeing.,-1,0
1673,1,6,It shoots 720p video, pretty neat.,-1,0
1673,1,7,It has an anti blur mode meaning that it shoots 5 shots and blends them into one to create one great picture.,-1,1
1673,1,8,It has a 10 shot feature, by pressing the button down it will shoot 10 shots in a row, of any quality you choose, the only bad part is you have to wait for the camera to save the photos, still a very neat and useful feature.However, the resolution is not as great as I'd like it to be.,-1,1
1673,1,9,With 10.2 mega-pixel, you'd think it would do wonders.,-1,1
1673,1,10,It does not, i was disappointed.,-1,1
1673,1,11,When you zoom in on a photo, you can see the lack of clarity and pixelization.,-1,1
1673,1,12,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.,-1,1
1673,1,13,This is the only negative thing I can find.,-1,1
1673,1,14,Some are complaining about lack of internal memory, seriously?,-1,1
1673,1,15,I'd rather purchase the memory and leave space for new camera technology.,-1,1
1673,1,16,A memory card is essential.So for the price and innovative technology, I really like this camera.,-1,1
1673,1,17,So many features and specialties.,-1,1
1674,1,0,Wanted a highly-portable pocket camera that also took decent quality pictures.,-1,0
1674,1,1,Had a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5 that took excellent pictures but was somewhat bulky in the pocket.,-1,0
1674,1,2,A dump in the river while canoeing, even using a plastic baggie to protect, still let in enough moisture that the Lumix camera was DOA when taken into a repair shop.,-1,1
1674,1,3,Looked around, talked to friends and found this camera.,-1,1
1674,1,4,Waited until the price came down a bit and bought it.,-1,1
1674,1,5,Works well in most lighting conditions with/without flash.,-1,1
1674,1,6,Only minor complaint is that the lens is located very near where you hold the camera (upper right-hand corner) so you have to be careful not to take a picture of your thumb or finger -- have done that a few times :).,-1,1
1674,1,7,More detailed reviews can be found elsewhere.,-1,1
1675,1,0,Nice Small Camera.,-1,0
1675,1,1,I have only had the camera for a few days, but can tell that I like ita lot.,-1,1
1675,1,2,I am replacing a Cannon with only 3.1 megapixels and this is somuch better picture quality.,-1,1
1675,1,3,It seems pretty easy to operate as well.The supplied cables are all you need, but definately get a memory cardand a soft case.,-1,1
1675,1,4,The image stabilizer works very well on low lightphotos and telephotos.,-1,1
1675,1,5,So far, i like it very much, but have a lot tolearn.,-1,1
1676,1,0,Ok Camera - couple Sony quirks.,-1,1
1676,1,1,Had this camera for about a month now - its a fine camera and has the usual settings/functions as mentioned by others.,-1,1
1676,1,2,There are some quirks with this camera which I wanted to point out.GOOD- Photo Quality - Others cover this so I wont go into it, but basically the photos are very good.BAD- Sony USB Cable - This is proprietary SONY cable, so you have to carry it around with you if you want to download photos from the directly from the camera without removing the Memory Stick.,-1,1
1676,1,3,Its NOT one of those universal mini-USB/USB cables like you can use on Canons.,-1,1
1676,1,4,The SONY Cable also has Video/Audio connectors, so its a bulky cable.GOOD- Flash Setting - Unlike most Canon's I have had you can turn OFF the flash and it stays off after turning the camera off/on again.,-1,1
1676,1,5,Its great if you want Non-Flash photos and are frequently turning the camera off/on in between shots.BAD- Battery Cover - The battery cover seems very flimsy and bows a bit if you hold the camera by it.,-1,1
1676,1,6,This is a common issue for cameras this small - but still, a more solid battery cover material would be better.GOOD- Auto Settings - The iAuto/Easy/P settings seem to work well and provide for lots of options.BAD- Battery Life - Not sure if its the use of the iAuto mode, but the battery life seem shorter than previous Sony DSC cameras - even with the Flash OFF on all shots.GOOD/BAD- Its VERY SMALL, even smaller than the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W290 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization (Dark Blue).,-1,1
1676,1,7,The size makes it very stealth as others point out, but you almost wish it was a bit bigger/heavier and had less of a "toy" feel.GOOD - My previous Canon SD800IS had trouble with outdoor shots and sunlight rays and washing out far away backgrounds on bright days on AUTO mode.,-1,1
1676,1,8,The SONY seems to handle these bright outdoor shots slightly better with either the P or EASY Settings.All in all, its a fine camera.,-1,1
1676,1,9,I wanted something upgraded from the normal point/shoot and it fits the bill.,-1,1
1676,1,10,That being said, I think the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W290 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization (Dark Blue) would be just fine as well for my needs.If SONY would only stop with the SONY-only cables/cards this would be a much better camera!,-1,1
1677,1,0,Better picture quality.,-1,1
1677,1,1,I bought one about 2 months ago and have been using it a lot.,-1,1
1677,1,2,It is a lot better with the picture quality especially in low light.,-1,1
1677,1,3,I like the technology of shooting at night from WX1. Panorama is fun and cool.,-1,0
1677,1,4,I can take many wide angle pic with WX1.,-1,1
1677,1,5,Battery does not last as long as the old Sony I have (T-3 and T-30)2.,-1,1
1677,1,6,There is static noise when recording video.,-1,1
1677,1,7,This is not the zooming sound.,-1,1
1677,1,8,It is just there all the time.,-1,1
1677,1,9,It is annoying if you don't have a loud background noise to cover it.,-1,1
1678,1,0,This little gem is about the size of a cell phone and takes very decent photos.,-1,1
1678,1,1,The ability to seek faces and automatically trip for smiles makes for some fun and easy pics.,-1,1
1678,1,2,The screen is about as easy to navigate as you could ask for.,-1,1
1678,1,3,We do a lot of socializing and it's nice to have something easy to record the memories.,-1,1
1679,1,0,Better in some aspects than a canon Rebel Xsi.,-1,1
1679,1,1,When taking pictures in Low light without a tripod this camera absolutely kicks the ass of the canon rebel xsi (with stabilised lens).,-1,1
1679,1,2,In fact i took a picture of the lcd display of my air conditioner in a dark room at about 10 feet distance (without a tripod) without flash of course, and the picture is unbelievably clear.Even indoor shots are better than the canon.,-1,1
1679,1,3,Of course with a tripod it is a completely different story but think about this will you lug a tripod around with you if u go to ur friends party or incase you feel like taking an outdoor shot at night?I found taking pictures of my friends at parties without the use of the flash and the pictures were amazing.The people crying about the picture quality are the type of people who will crib about how the performance of a ferrari leaves a lot to be desired.***,-1,1
1679,1,4,My parents (not tech savvy at all) found it a breeze to use with the various presets and the awesome auto modesIT IS AWESOME.,-1,0
1679,1,5,I GUARANTEE YOU WILL LOVE THIS CAMERA.and in case you are not satisfied you can always return it, but trust me chance of that happening are super low.,-1,0
1680,1,0,Great Video, Pictures not so good.,-1,0
1680,1,1,I've owned Sony's DSC-P72, W5, W7 and W300.,-1,0
1680,1,2,I bought this camera mainly for the 720P HD recording.,-1,0
1680,1,3,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!,-1,0
1680,1,4,The colors and lighting in the videos are excellent.,-1,0
1680,1,5,I would have liked stereo sound recording but is that even possible on such a small camera?,-1,1
1680,1,6,This camera has the ability to zoom while recording which is something that I have not been able to do in my past Sony point n' shoots.,-1,1
1680,1,7,However, beware the audio gets muffled somewhat if you zoom while recording.I have been shooting pictures in the P mode on the camera with the White Balance set to auto and the results are a mixed bag and somewhat disappointing.,-1,1
1680,1,8,Some outdoor shots are great and full of color, but when there is a high contrast of sunlight and shadows, the whole picture loses color and the part of the picture in the sunlight appears overexposed.,-1,1
1680,1,9,It's not terrible but it is noticeable because my past Sony cameras all handled outdoor pictures great almost all the time.,-1,1
1680,1,10,The panorama mode is interesting and the 5x zoom is also a plus.If you are buying the camera for the HD video go for it!,-1,1
1680,1,11,If you're buying it primarily for great pictures you should look at other cameras.,-1,1
1681,1,0,Great for certain situations.,-1,0
1681,1,1,Having owned 3 other Sony cameras and a Panasonic, I am somewhat picky.,-1,0
1681,1,2,I was debating whether to purchase the TX1 or the TX5 but here in Switzerland the TX1 was REMARKABLY cheaper so this made my decision for me.,-1,0
1681,1,3,Certain features of this camera have greatly impressed me.,-1,0
1681,1,4,For instance, indoor shots and low-lighting shots are amazing for a camera in this category.,-1,0
1681,1,5,It is also extremely quick when focusing and taking the picture which was a feature I really looked for.,-1,0
1681,1,6,This is by far the fastest and best for indoor shots.,-1,0
1681,1,7,In addition, it takes AMAZING close-ups and shows extraordinary amounts of detail and does very well when taking pictures of moving targets.,-1,0
1681,1,8,The video quality is exceptional for a camera of this size as well.,-1,0
1681,1,9,Initially, I was weary of buying a touch screen camera but I have really enjoyed it so far.,-1,0
1681,1,10,I was worried it would be hard to hold the camera without touching the screen and that not having physical buttons would be a hassle, however it has proven to be more fun to use and pretty simple.,-1,0
1681,1,11,The only drawback is the outdoor quality under sunny conditions.,-1,0
1681,1,12,Being someone that travels a lot, this is upsetting.,-1,0
1681,1,13,The pictures are still crystal clear but the color tends to be somewhat dull.,-1,0
1681,1,14,I caught myself using color-enhancing features on my computer after uploading the pictures I had taken.,-1,0
1681,1,15,I wouldn't consider the outdoor shots to be "terrible" as some of the other reviews would have you believe, but I do find them to lack a certain amount of vibrance.,-1,1
1681,1,16,This is the perfect camera for someone younger that just likes to take pictures of friends, family, parties, etc but for outside scenery, it's slightly disappointing.,-1,0
1681,1,17,You probably wouldn't notice though unless you had used some other higher-end digital camera under similar conditions.,-1,0
1681,1,18,However, due to the size, close-ups, video quality, and touch screen, I would recommend this camera.,-1,0
1682,1,0,Perfect pocket shot.,-1,0
1682,1,1,This camera is small enough to go any where you go and take decent quality photos.,-1,1
1682,1,2,I'm always taking photos of my kid and dogs, neither of which is very interested in holding still for any amount of time.,-1,1
1682,1,3,This camera has two really neat features that compensate for wiggle worms.,-1,1
1682,1,4,The first is a setting that will take a short burst of photos and then layer them on top of each other so what you get is one clean clear picture with very minimal, if any at all, movement.,-1,1
1682,1,5,The second feature allows this camera to shoot up to 10f/sec.,-1,1
1682,1,6,Thats pretty remarkable in a camera this small considering some SLRs can't even do that.,-1,1
1682,1,7,The only downside to these features is that the camera does require a certain amount of processing time but given the size of the camera it really isn't that bad of a wait.,-1,1
1682,1,8,It also tells you when some one is blinking, which is kind of an odd useless feature given the fact that I am well aware when someone has blinked during a photo.,-1,1
1682,1,9,I've heard the panoramic setting is neat but have yet to use it.,-1,0
1682,1,10,The camera is all touch screen and is more of an iPod Touch feel to it.,-1,0
1682,1,11,Also you have the option with this camera to get a party dock.,-1,0
1682,1,12,Which when I read about on the box thought was stupid, HOWEVER, this dock was recently gifted to me and it is absolutely awesome.,-1,0
1682,1,13,What it does is if you're having a get together and you don't want to be the one holding the camera all night long you put it in this dock.,-1,1
1682,1,14,The dock and the camera will automatically start searching around the room until it sees a smiling face and snap a picture.,-1,1
1682,1,15,So overall given that this camera is a point and shoot and not anything else it is well worth the money.,-1,1
1682,1,16,It is packed with features and consistently puts out very decent photos.,-1,1
1683,1,0,I purchased this camera because I wanted something to replace my Sony DSC-W300.,-1,1
1683,1,1,This appeared to be the high-end replacement for the W300 and one of the first compact cameras using CMOS technology.,-1,1
1683,1,2,My opinion is that the photos look lifeless and dull, similar to mobile-phone photos and MUCH WORSE than photos off the iPhone!,-1,1
1683,1,3,I realize they are much higher resolution than shots from a mobile phone, but the iPhone photos have such great color -- exactly what this camera lacks in a big way.,-1,1
1683,1,4,Yes, I carefully read all the other reviews and took great pains to try out all the other settings and options.,-1,1
1683,1,5,Yeah, turning on the FLASH white balance for outdoor photos (which makes no sense by the way) --SOMETIMES-- does make the normally blueish outdoor photos look more pleasingly orangeish if you can remember to make this cryptic change or use P mode for your outdoor photos.,-1,1
1683,1,6,Yes, you are slightly more likely to get a better photo in the dark if you really need to take photos in the dark.,-1,1
1683,1,7,The mode where it takes 6 photos and blends them together to reduce noise is cool to play with a few times, but doing that to reduce low light blur didn't really matter since the photo still looked soft, lifeless, and dull.,-1,1
1683,1,8,My old DSC-W300 simply blows this camera away in almost every way other than the HD video capability which was AWESOME, but only if you have another camera to take all your still photos -- and I didn't feel like spending this much money to only have an HD video camera.,-1,1
1683,1,9,The sweep panorama certainly made it easy to get mediocre panoramas; but with slightly more effort I get better results using the Pano app with the iphone.,-1,1
1683,1,10,So much for the infamous "Sony Reds" -- you give that up with this new technology too.,-1,1
1683,1,11,At this rate, my next compact might be a Canon or Panasonic.,-1,1
1683,1,12,For now I'm sticking with the DSC-W300 which takes *WAY* better still photos.,-1,1
1683,1,13,My search continues for a compact that can take SHARP, COLORFUL photos in low light, and has HD video.,-1,1
1684,1,0,Low-light was not as good as the hype, and normal everyday pics are much softer/fuzzier than my canon a650.,-1,1
1684,1,1,This might not seem fair, as the canon has a bigger sensor, but I was hoping the ordinary, undemanding daylight images of the sony would be relatively close to the canon.Bottom line is that they weren't, and the low-light performance wasn't good enough to compensate.,-1,1
1684,1,2,Coincidentally, I received notification of of an LX3 being in-stock at a good price as I was packaging this up to return, so I think I'll be a happy camper when the LX3 arrives.On the positive side, very nice small form factor, good looking, the 720p video was smooth, and the burst and panorama modes seemed to work very well.,-1,0
1685,1,0,Small, but you'll pay the price.,-1,1
1685,1,1,I bought this camera to be an everday everywhere type of camera, I didn't expect the world when it comes to picture quality, but I find it not worth taking because the picture quality is so poor.I have four major gripes with this camera1.,-1,1
1685,1,2,Picture Quality - Both color rendition and dynamic range are horrendous, skies are universally washed out in daylight photos, and I've set it to -.7 compensation to make them a little bit darker.,-1,1
1685,1,3,Color rendition is awful  every single photo gives a horrid washed out look.,-1,1
1685,1,4,Colors are not saturated at all, and the way it records color it is very difficult to improve in photoshop.2.,-1,1
1685,1,5,Durability  First day I severely scratched the screen on the metal rivet putting it in or taking it out of my jeans pocket a camera this small should be designed to be put in a pocket.3.,-1,1
1685,1,6,Interface to computer - dedicated cable I have to bring with me on vacation, or a usb sd card reader?,-1,1
1685,1,7,this is 2010 not 1985.4.  User interface - menu is difficult to navigate and full of gimmicky 'features' as opposed to useful things.,-1,1
1685,1,8,I cannot seem to change the color rendition anywhere, but I can get it to take 10 shots in a row, which are all equally ugly.,-1,1
1685,1,9,I use a camera to take nice looking pictures.,-1,0
1685,1,10,This doesn't do it.I was looking for a small simple camera to carry with me.,-1,0
1685,1,11,Wasn't looking for dslr quality, but something that looked  nice would be useful.,-1,0
1685,1,12,I used to use a sony f-717 and it took fantastic pictures for what it was, a lot of the part i liked was the warm saturated look, which is all done in software anyway.,-1,0
1685,1,13,This camera doesn't take such nice pictures.,-1,0
1685,1,14,I really can't recommend this to anyone.,-1,0
1685,1,15,I looked all over to try to find which settings to change but I never found it.,-1,1
1686,1,0,Sony DSC-TX1/P.,-1,0
1686,1,1,This was a birthday gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it especially since it's pink.,-1,0
1686,1,2,I have the same camera in blue and am very pleased with it, since it's very compact and fairly easy to use.,-1,0
1687,1,0,Who would have thought......,-1,0
1687,1,1,I recently purchased this little gem and am shocked by it!,-1,0
1687,1,2,I am a film person and my normal cameras are Hassies and RX7 Mamiyas.,-1,0
1687,1,3,These give me the quality I require.,-1,0
1687,1,4,Now imagine my shock when this tiny camera arrived and performed the way it did.,-1,0
1687,1,5,Noise is minimal, sharpness is pretty amazing, features seem endless; and all in this tiny piece of technology and at such a low price!,-1,0
1687,1,6,I don't care what you own---you need this camera.,-1,1
1687,1,7,Ansel would have had one in his pocket!,-1,1
1688,1,0,Noisy Zoom Lens.,-1,0
1688,1,1,I prefer small pocket size cameras which can take nice still photos and good movie clips.,-1,0
1688,1,2,That is why for a number of years I had successively Sony DSC-T1, T30, and T100 ultra-compacts.,-1,1
1688,1,3,They fitted all my needs at that time and I was happy with their perfromance.,-1,1
1688,1,4,But time flies and new cameras with higher resolution and better movie quality started appearing on the market, so I purchased at that time a newest Sony DSC-W300 13.6MP camera which looked pretty good on the paper.,-1,1
1688,1,5,Unfortunately it turned out it was equipped with a very weak lens which spoiled all the good qualities of the camera itself, so I returned it back.Later on I got Panasonic TZ5 and recently ZR1.,-1,1
1688,1,6,Both are the very good cameras with one exception: their microphones are on the top facing the ceiling and if you shooting a movie clip of someone speaking in a relatively noisy environment those microphones collect all the noise around and make the voice of the person you're taking picture of indistinctive.,-1,1
1688,1,7,So I was looking for a small camera with a front microphone which could take good low light movie clips.The new Sony DSC-WX1 seemed perfect for these purposes so I purchased it from Amazon which delivered it very promptly.,-1,1
1688,1,8,The camera has the usual for Sony good build quality and generally worked fine.,-1,1
1688,1,9,In comparison with Panasonic ZR1 it has remarkably brighter lens which allow to take normally exposed pictures in lower light conditions.,-1,1
1688,1,10,The mono-microphone is pretty sensitive and provides a good sound quality.,-1,1
1688,1,11,But once I started taking video I immediately uncovered the first and the major problem, which became a deal-breaker - it's lens produces very loud mechanical noise when you're doing zoom in or out.When you apply zoom it sounds like you're starting an aged truck in cold weather.,-1,1
1688,1,12,The level of that grinding noise on the footage is almost as the same as the voice of the person speaking in the front of the camera and is very disturbing.,-1,1
1688,1,13,Just for the record, I never experienced such a problem neither with my T100 nor with my Sony HDR-SR7 camcorder.,-1,1
1688,1,14,The zooming noise from ZR1 can hardly be noticed on the footage as well.,-1,1
1688,1,15,Another source of annoying sound turned out to be the autofocus system.,-1,1
1688,1,16,It has significantly lower level and it resides mostly in the higher frequencies but unlike zooming this is audible all the time you're shooting movie and the constant presense of that creaking sound makes very unpleasant impression.,-1,1
1688,1,17,For me it was a complete deal-breaker so I returned that camera the same day.One more thing I never experienced neither with my old Sony cameras nor with the Panasonic ones: when you are doing zoomming-out and stop in some intermediate position the lens of WX1 does not stop immediately but continues a bit its movement so the recorded picture continues decreasing in its size and then lens, all of a sudden, starts moving in the opposite direction which makes the picture unexpectedly incresing for about a half of the second.,-1,1
1688,1,18,That "kick"-effect is also recorded onto the footage and makes bad impression.I also took a few indoors pictures with both WX1 and ZR1 and found that the noise produced by WX1 with a new Sony Exmor sensor at ISO-400 is remarkably higher than of the same pictures taken by ZR1.,-1,1
1688,1,19,It seems like Exmor sensor from the noise prospective is not better but exactly opposite to what was stated.,-1,1
1688,1,20,The Twilight feature is really good but only for none-moving objects, you hardly can use its advantages for taking pictures of your kids or pets.So this is a decent camera for anyone who is interested in taking just still pictures, but if you are looking for a good low-light wide angle camcorder for shooting movie clips with a nice sound - you'd better consider something else.,-1,1
1689,1,0,Good Camera- 24mm wide angle is amazing.,-1,0
1689,1,1,I bought this camera after doing some research as an amateur photographer.,-1,1
1689,1,2,It was little more than my budget but as I look back now it was worth spending $50 more for this 24mm wide angle feature.,-1,1
1689,1,3,The wide angle makes a huge difference while taking pictures inside small room and with large families.,-1,1
1689,1,4,It is very compact and portable and with a decent compact size.It has a decent battery life.,-1,1
1689,1,5,The aesthetics of the camera is not very great, I would love to see some design elements in it for the camera at this price.I would recommend this camera to anyone who can manage to spend little extra money to buy this 24mm wide lense, its worth it.,-1,1
1689,1,6,I would like to thank my boss who pushed me to buy this 24mm wide angle lense camera.Panoramic feature is also great.,-1,1
1689,1,7,The auto feature is generally gives good result and if somebody is not satisfied with that it also has some very good scene settings as well.,-1,0
1689,1,8,I am not happy with not able to forcefully turn on flash in auto mode.,-1,0
1690,1,0,sony wx1.,-1,1
1690,1,1,Excellent product, i switch from konica minolta z1 (that i really liked), and there is a huge difference in the quality of this camera, besides of the 5x zoom, this product is all i need for taking great pictures both indoor and outdoor, and the panorama setting is so easy to use and incredible results, just have to understand how it works and you will have excellent memories of incredibles views!!Video is excellent both indoor and outdoor and you can zoom it while recording!!Very happy with this purchase, and believe me, i have never write any reviews on anything, but i've decided to take the time because all the bad publicity this camera is receiving from some reviewers!,-1,1
1691,1,0,Love it for its low light capabilities!,-1,0
1691,1,1,Loved this camera - i had it for 1.5 - 2 yrs and i was good for several more years if it weren't for the evil rain that destroyed it.,-1,0
1691,1,2,In every occasion that involved taking pictures in low light situations, thanks to this camera, I've always had the best pictures among my friends with other cameras.Other aspects of the camera are OKish.,-1,0
1691,1,3,The burst mode is decent, battery life could have been better.,-1,1
1691,1,4,Battery has to be taken out and charged externally, i prefer the ones which can be charged through usb therefore allowing you to copy photos while also charging the camera.,-1,1
1691,1,5,One surprising weakness of this camera is that it doesn't take good pictures while in motion - unless you are in burst mode.All in all a good camera.,-1,1
1692,1,0,Nice Camera.,-1,0
1692,1,1,Holding up real well...I bought this a few years ago.,-1,0
1692,1,2,I use it all the time.,-1,0
1692,1,3,Panoramic is cool and close up is great too.,-1,0
1693,1,0,best camera ive used so far.,-1,0
1693,1,1,I bought this when it first came out a couple of years ago , It can take some really amazing photos and some times it takes bad photos not sure if it is me or the camera im kind of a newbie.My friend bought a expensive dslr camera and was like wow what kind of camera do you use ?,-1,0
1693,1,2,I posted some photos check them out.I like the battery i dont want to have to buy AA bateries yes you do have to take the battery out to charge it but for me it last the right amount of time.I recently got prints 20x30 pretty big the frames cost like $20 from this camera using iphoto and the photos look great have them hanging on my parents wall they like them alot .Also love the touch screen.Over all i think its a great product my mom has a sony camera newer then mine a it takes great video.Its a older phone but for its size it does amazing job ,and if you want to take night pictures buy a tripod,-1,0
1694,1,0,High resolution, waterproof.,-1,1
1694,1,1,I bought this for a class field trip to Southern Florida studying corals, and I wanted to be able to take pictures of the corals underwater.,-1,1
1694,1,2,The camera worked underwater without a hitch, even in the cool salty waters of the Atlantic in early March.,-1,1
1694,1,3,So the camera is waterproof, just don't expect NatGeo-quality underwater photography with it; some of the pictures came out very nicely, but others just didn't look right.,-1,1
1694,1,4,The picture and video quality is very high in terms of resolution, but this is a digital camera, not a DSLR, so of course you get issues with focusing and lighting and so on, so it's probably a 3/5 in terms of absolute camera quality.,-1,1
1694,1,5,However, in its class -- a waterproof digital camera at this price point -- it is a 5/5.,-1,1
1694,1,6,It's very convenient, it gets the job done, and despite its delicate appearance, it holds up well to abuse.,-1,1
1695,1,0,Nice while it lasted but...,-1,1
1695,1,1,It didn't last long.,-1,1
1695,1,2,After a while, pictures seem overexposed with white stripes accross.,-1,1
1695,1,3,It's been in a drawer for some time now.,-1,1
1696,1,0,Very disappointing.,-1,1
1696,1,1,I've owned this camera for almost 4 years now, and I barely use it.,-1,1
1696,1,2,Pictures taken with this camera are always blurry, even in direct sunlight.,-1,1
1696,1,3,Low light pictures are blurry and pixelated.,-1,1
1696,1,4,Taking a picture with the camera turned sideways to better frame a specific shot shows a lot of distortion from the wide angle lens.,-1,1
1696,1,5,Video is usually okay, but has two major problems... First, the noise of zooming in and out is recorded very loudly.,-1,1
1696,1,6,Second, the autofocus changes haphazardly, switching from foreground to background, sometimes following movement, and preferentially focusing on light sources.,-1,1
1697,1,0,Leave quality aside, Sony sucks.,-1,1
1697,1,1,Tell me what will you do when you want to move pictures from your camera to your computer on the fly, you will need the 10 meter long 10 plug Sony proprietary cable, how about taking the memory card out, oh, that's another proprietary memory stick duo, now how to charge it?,-1,1
1697,1,2,you need to take the battery out and use yet another proprietary accessory ... mmmm this is a no go, stay away from Sony, you get matching quality from other brands with way easier methods to deal with a simple digital camera.,-1,1
1698,1,0,Great little camera.,-1,0
1698,1,1,Love the low light feature.,-1,0
1698,1,2,Camera slips right into your pocket.,-1,0
1698,1,3,Slim design for easy storage in camera bag.,-1,0
1698,1,4,Great,-1,0
1699,1,0,Incredible low-light shots from a small point and shoot.,-1,1
1699,1,1,I wanted to write about the Sony cybershot DSC-WX1 because of all of the benefit I've gotten from others' unselfish reviews about products.,-1,1
1699,1,2,I was looking for a small point and shoot camera for live music shows that I could sneak into places that wouldn't allow detachable lens cameras, or cameras at all.,-1,1
1699,1,3,That is no small task I quickly learned.Many higher priced cameras failed spectacularly at low-light shots with people moving which happens at live shows.,-1,1
1699,1,4,However, time and again, the WX1 performs admirably.,-1,0
1699,1,5,The low-light and anti-motion blur settings both take 6 quick shots and combine them to make one really, really terrific picture.,-1,0
1699,1,6,I confess, I don't quite know the difference between the two modes, and they both churn out terrific low-light photos.The point is, a camera this small probably shouldn't turn out great low light shots.,-1,0
1699,1,7,Though I'd read, while this camera is a star as a point and shoot for low light, its daytime shots, or shots in artifical light, were not good.,-1,0
1699,1,8,Well, I have to admit, I've been very happy with the shots this camera takes in bright light.,-1,0
1699,1,9,At most, some tinkering has to be done with computer software, but the shots are wonderful for a very, very small camera.I bought this camera among others to compare and this camera quickly beat all of the others for low light, action shooting with loud sound.,-1,0
1699,1,10,The mono speakers on this camera are perfect too.,-1,0
1699,1,11,This camera easily beat out the Canon Powershot SX230HS, Sony Cybershot DSC-W290, Sony Cybershot DSC-H20 with the amount of usable pictures it took in low light.I bought this camera as a throwaway possibility thinking I'd re-sell it on Amazon or Ebay, assuming I wouldn't like it.,-1,1
1699,1,12,However, I bought it hoping that what I'd read about its low-light capabilities were true.,-1,1
1699,1,13,I figured, no way could that be true coming from a camera with such a small body.,-1,1
1699,1,14,But I was proven very wrong.,-1,1
1699,1,15,Now, there is absolutely no way I would sell this camera.,-1,1
1699,1,16,I may only use it for one purpose - low light, action shooting, but I may bring it out for other purposes when I don't want to be very mindful of taking great care of a camera.,-1,0
1699,1,17,It will be a tremendous backup camera, but for someone who wants a simple point and shoot without having to think too much and just leaving it in auto, it would make a great main camera.I give it 4 stars only because it is not an unbelievable camera.,-1,0
1699,1,18,It has pretty good zoom, pretty good bright light shots and it takes HD video, but only 720p.,-1,0
1699,1,19,Still, it is really, really good, especially for what it is with such a small body.,-1,0
1700,1,0,I Love this camera.,-1,0
1700,1,1,I love this camera, this is my second in four years....I dropped the first from my horse.....This camera has a great slim design that fits well into a pocket...it takes great pictures and the batteries last a long time.,-1,0
1700,1,2,The only bad point I have found....is sometimes I hit the touch screen when I am taking the picture and this changes my setting.,-1,1
1701,1,0,Quite Impressive!,-1,0
1701,1,1,The low-light capabilities of this camera are the big surprise in this camera.,-1,0
1701,1,2,It actually sees better in the dark than I do.,-1,0
1701,1,3,I got it for $159 and feel like I stole it.,-1,0
1701,1,4,Panorama is simple and amazing, sharp & colorful pictures.,-1,0
1701,1,5,Only downside... battery only lasts about 80 minutes, but generics are cheap.,-1,0
1701,1,6,Definitely worth the investment!,-1,0
1702,1,0,Best camera I've ever had.,-1,0
1702,1,1,I'm an avid concert-goer and partier, so I needed a camera that could take great pictures in not-so-great situations.,-1,0
1702,1,2,I get the most stunning pics at concerts [while in a moshpit], can get great pictures in low light situations, often times without even using a flash.,-1,0
1702,1,3,I also really love the sweep panorama.,-1,0
1702,1,4,I haven't had a lot of situations where I've needed to use it, but the times that I have, it's turned out amazing.,-1,0
1702,1,5,Oh, and the video quality is awesome as well.,-1,0
1702,1,6,720p video, great audio quality.,-1,0
1702,1,7,Overall, amazing camera and worth the money.,-1,0
1702,1,8,Highly recommend this product.,-1,0
1703,1,0,There are some things I love about this camera--the size (fits in my pocket), the quality of shots when it is working properly, the burst feature.There is one thing that is so frustrating, it knocked off two stars.,-1,1
1703,1,1,First, it is all too easy while shooting to accidently change the settings and all too difficult to get back to what I want--after I realize what's happened.,-1,1
1703,1,2,Second, the screen is not always responsive (which may seem incongruous with my first remark, but that's my experience).,-1,1
1703,1,3,Third, when trying to get back to the settings I want in the middle of a photo opp, it can be confusing trying to find the right screen.Fourth (and worst), the image size seems to change without my actually choosing it.,-1,1
1703,1,4,This cost me dearly at a photo shoot where I needed as high a quality as possible, which was the reason I bought this camera.,-1,1
1703,1,5,I know that folks will say that I must have pressed the wrong button, and that might be so at times.,-1,1
1703,1,6,It is not always the case, though; my last shoot, I know I did not change the settings but they changed to the lowest setting nonetheless.If I could afford a more professional camera, I would get it, but as a freelance writer a point-and-shoot is it and it has to be easy to handle.,-1,1
1703,1,7,I do a lot of shooting under pressure.,-1,1
1703,1,8,If I had it to do over, I would not buy a camera with a touchscreen.One other thing--this thing eats batteries.,-1,1
1703,1,9,It is not unusual to go through two batteries in an hour or two, even when they are fully charged.,-1,1
1704,1,0,Great camera for a while.,-1,1
1704,1,1,I have had this camera for a little over a year.,-1,1
1704,1,2,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.,-1,1
1704,1,3,For the price I paid for it (much more than it costs now)I expected a bit longer life.,-1,1
1705,1,0,Great Camera.,-1,0
1705,1,1,Of all the point-and-shoot digital cameras I've had, this is the first one I've been very happy with.,-1,0
1705,1,2,The wide lens is great, and the technology (low-light photos, sweep panorama, etc.) is really impressive.,-1,0
1705,1,3,It is also intuitive and easy to use the advanced functions without much of a learning curve.,-1,0
1706,1,0,Love it!,-1,0
1706,1,1,This camera is perfect for one-handed operation in the field as an insurance adjuster.,-1,0
1706,1,2,The slim design makes it easy to slip into a back pocket and the slide down power on function is very convenient.,-1,0
1707,1,0,Superb Service - Sony Cyber Shot.,-1,0
1707,1,1,I'm very happy with the Sony Cyber shot.,-1,0
1707,1,2,The camera is great for the functionality, clear photos and movies and the price was right.,-1,0
1707,1,3,I was very impressed that I ordered the camera on a Saturday, it was shipped out the same day and at my house on Tuesday...great service...thank you!!!,-1,0
1708,1,0,Screen delamination or is it moisture haze?,-1,1
1708,1,1,I bought two of the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX1/P camera within months of one another the first from Amazon on 12-17-2009.,-1,1
1708,1,2,One for my wife and then because I was so impressed, one for my me.,-1,1
1708,1,3,While Sony no longer uses the DSC-TX1 model number, ours was the top of the line and we paid $329 each for these cameras.,-1,1
1708,1,4,We both really enjoyed them for the first year.,-1,1
1708,1,5,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.,-1,1
1708,1,6,There wasn't much to complain about.However I noticed last year that my screen was  getting hazy or splotchy; I don't know what to call it but it looks like a window with condensation all over it and I associated it with moisture or humidity "behine" the glass screen.,-1,1
1708,1,7,I felt somewhat responcible because I often carried the camera in my front jeans pocket and thought that maybe the humidity had penetrated it and caused the damage.,-1,1
1708,1,8,Now I notice that my wife's camera is doing the same thing and I don't know what is going on yet but I cannot reccommend this camera now that I have seen both screens go bad in less than two years.,-1,1
1708,1,9,I am going to see if Sony wiill repair or replace them but right now it feels that $329 x 2 was too much to spend for less than two years use.,-1,1
1709,1,0,Excellent Camera!,-1,0
1709,1,1,I got this camera primarily for its promised excellent quality in low light condition and I am very satisfied with its overall features!,-1,0
1709,1,2,Take time to familiarize yourself with everything this great gadget has to offer and you will find it very useful.,-1,0
1709,1,3,It's perfect for capturing the whole scenery rather than just a portion of it.,-1,0
1709,1,4,There are appropriate modes for any setting you're in and for a decent great quality set of point and shoot pictures, Sony TX1 performance is worth it!,-1,0
1710,1,0,One stop shot!,-1,0
1710,1,1,My boyfriend had this camera in black.,-1,0
1710,1,2,He got it about 2 years ago for $300+.,-1,0
1710,1,3,I LOVED it!,-1,0
1710,1,4,The panoramic shot was so cool to do in the Vatican.,-1,0
1710,1,5,Since my old camera broke, I searched on Amazon for his camera.,-1,0
1710,1,6,I found this product.,-1,0
1710,1,7,Not only was it significantly discounted from the original price he paid, but it was a different colored blue!,-1,0
1710,1,8,Awesome.,-1,0
1711,1,0,H. Rang.,-1,0
1711,1,1,The good: Nice photos.,-1,0
1711,1,2,Small camera.,-1,0
1711,1,3,Good night shots.240-degree,-1,0
1711,1,4,shots.Compromises: Minor issues -- sometimes the picture wheel moves to a different setting because the Sony holster bag is a tight fit.,-1,1
1711,1,5,Reformating memory stick is best done on computer.,-1,1
1711,1,6,Use MS Windows software for downloading.Overall: I am happy with purchase.,-1,0
1711,1,7,It does exactly what I thought it would and better.,-1,0
1712,1,0,Expensive junk.,-1,1
1712,1,1,Takes terrible pictures.,-1,1
1712,1,2,Maybe there's a way to use some complex custom settings, but otherwise flash photos are washed out, blurry, grainy, etc. Had it for less than 2 years- screen appears to be failing.,-1,1
1712,1,3,I think my next one will be a Casio or Canon.,-1,1
1712,1,4,This camera is under $200 at Walmart.,-1,1
1712,1,5,I wouldn't pay any more for it than that.,-1,1
1713,1,0,Great Little Pocket Camera.,-1,0
1713,1,1,I don't actually own this camera, but borrowed it from a friend to take on vacation.,-1,0
1713,1,2,I own a digital SLR, and wanted to take something I could hand to my boys to take photos with.,-1,0
1713,1,3,The quality of the photos are very nice.,-1,0
1713,1,4,They are not of the quality of a DSLR, but for a pocket camera, they are more than acceptable.,-1,0
1713,1,5,I didn't realize that the camera recorded video, so I tried it and it was lower quality than a dedicated video camera, but for a backup it is very acceptable.In short, I think this camera would be great for the everyday photographer, and as a backup camera.,-1,0
1713,1,6,The quality is high for a camera in this category, and the video is more than acceptable.,-1,0
1713,1,7,And you can't beat the portability.,-1,0
1713,1,8,The battery has a decent life as well.,-1,0
1713,1,9,We used it on our vacation to Washington DC and it and the battery would last all day.Well worth the investment.,-1,0
1714,1,0,perfect camera.,-1,0
1714,1,1,This camera worked beautifully.,-1,0
1714,1,2,Purchased in May 2011.,-1,0
1715,1,0,A 3 star camera I've learned to love.,-1,0
1715,1,1,I bought the TX1 after using a borrowed one and comparing it to Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, and the newest compact Sonys: TX100, TX7, T110.,-1,0
1715,1,2,Price was not an objective.,-1,0
1715,1,3,Compactness, panorama, internal lens, durability all needed to combine to produce great images.,-1,0
1715,1,4,These images needed to impress on a 67" HD screen.,-1,0
1715,1,5,When exposure settings are correct, they impress.,-1,0
1715,1,6,Don't be fooled into thinking that 16 meg pixel files will deliver better images from the small sensors used in compact cameras.,-1,1
1715,1,7,They will only when the ccd or cmos sensor is physically larger as they are in the big digital SLRs with comparably larger glass.,-1,1
1715,1,8,From my experience using compact cameras, 10-12 meg pixels seems to be the practical limit with today's technology.Video looks great.,-1,0
1715,1,9,No stereo, but audio is satisfactorily sensitive without artifacts.,-1,0
1715,1,10,I've used stereo audio before which is nice, but versatility and image quality must prevail.,-1,0
1715,1,11,I tried a 16 meg pixel TX100 cmos and a T110 ccd.,-1,0
1715,1,12,Both disappointed.,-1,0
1715,1,13,The files are huge without any improvement in image quality.,-1,0
1715,1,14,The Sweep Pan WOW! factor is significantly reduced on the newer models due to the inherent distortion and horizon push of the wider angle (25 mm vs 38 mm equivalent) lens featured in these newer models.,-1,0
1715,1,15,Distortion and horizon push notwithstanding, the sweeps are softer because fewer pixels are allocated per degree of view.,-1,1
1715,1,16,The resulting sweeps from these newer models are unacceptably distorted and soft compared to those from the TX1.Not believing I needed hand held low light capability, I was awed by the quality and ease of low light images snapped with the TX1.,-1,1
1715,1,17,I would not be without this feature.,-1,0
1715,1,18,Sony's 7 image combining firmware is nothing short of genius as well as the thrilling panoramics shot with the appropriate fixed 38 mm equivalent focal length used only on the TX1.The macro setting produces the best close-ups I've ever shot.Get a pack of screen protector sheets, the transparent kind.,-1,0
1715,1,19,Cut the sheets to size.,-1,0
1715,1,20,Some sheets allow exactly one cut to produce two perfectly sized protectors for this camera.,-1,0
1715,1,21,Usually you will get 3 or 4 dividable sheets in a pack costing about $3.,-1,0
1715,1,22,A perfect sized protector will slightly overlap the screen.,-1,0
1715,1,23,Separate the film of one of the sheets from the adhesive guard (backing).,-1,0
1715,1,24,Place the film with the adhesive contacting the screen.,-1,0
1715,1,25,You should start at one end centering and aligning as best as you can overlapping the edges of the screen.,-1,0
1715,1,26,Once placed, press from the center and work outward to the edges.,-1,0
1715,1,27,Don't worry about the weak adhesive contaminating the screen.,-1,0
1715,1,28,It won't.,-1,0
1715,1,29,The important thing is to not touch the adhesive.,-1,0
1715,1,30,Some manufacturers provide a plastic "squeegee" to smooth the film.,-1,0
1715,1,31,It will mar or scratch the film and possibly damage the very screen you are trying to protect!,-1,0
1715,1,32,Push the bubbles which form between the protector and screen outward toward the edges.,-1,0
1715,1,33,The few remaining will eventually disappear, because if you do this right the protector will give long service before you need to apply another one.,-1,1
1715,1,34,Now, you must do something a bit ugly but necessary to complete this job.,-1,1
1715,1,35,The metal body of the TX1 handles tape well.,-1,1
1715,1,36,The horizontal edges require no attention and are left "open" to allow any remaining air to escape.,-1,1
1715,1,37,The taping will permit you to slide the camera into and out of your pocket or case without peeling back the protector making it useless.,-1,1
1715,1,38,Taping can yield months of service from one application if done with care.,-1,1
1715,1,39,The film resists marring by your fingers amazingly well.,-1,0
1715,1,40,The best thing is that screen touch sensitivity improves with the application of a protector.,-1,0
1715,1,41,When you do need to replace a protector, your screen will look new.A word concerning durability in which the TX1 excels: Buyer beware when choosing a motor driven variable focal length external lens camera.,-1,0
1715,1,42,While many of these styles of cameras deliver superb images with greater focal length range, by design, the mechanisms will become contaminated with dust and moisture.,-1,1
1715,1,43,The rear element of the lens mechanism will get dirty.,-1,1
1715,1,44,Factory service is the only way these can be cleaned and calibrated.,-1,1
1715,1,45,When contaminated, images shot in the telephoto range will show blobs most noticeably in sky areas.,-1,1
1715,1,46,This condition is backed by factory warrantees, but who wishes to be without a camera for 3-8 weeks while being serviced.,-1,1
1715,1,47,Then when you receive the camera back from the factory, the spots are gone, but you discover the focus is not as good as it was before you sent the camera for cleaning.... then back to the factory, etc.,-1,1
1715,1,48,You will toss the camera when the warranty expires.,-1,1
1715,1,49,Cameras are for pleasure, not this kind of hassle.,-1,1
1715,1,50,Designers of future releases must make these user serviceable if the external lens style is to remain viable.,-1,1
1715,1,51,Perhaps we may get to see interchangeable lenses on future compact cameras.,-1,1
1715,1,52,Parallax firmware can be utilized to overcome servo focus errors.So why is the TX1 not a 5 star camera?,-1,1
1715,1,53,Well, I haven't experienced a 5 star camera, but I can tell you the shortcomings which keep this one from its full potential.,-1,1
1715,1,54,Despite the genius of Sony with the TX1, Sony also unveils remarkable oversight which seems to progress with newer models.,-1,1
1715,1,55,Here are my gripes:1) The TX1 is not a point and shoot camera and frustratingly, has very limited user overrides.,-1,1
1715,1,56,The reason it is not a point and shoot is because auto exposure is just wrong.,-1,1
1715,1,57,In fact, all the auto settings are wrong.,-1,1
1715,1,58,Use auto anything and you will justifiably hate this camera.,-1,1
1715,1,59,For correct exposures, use the P setting, meter in the center (not with the spot setting) of the brightest area while slightly depressing the shutter button to hold the averaged metered settings.,-1,1
1715,1,60,Experiment until you get desired results.,-1,1
1715,1,61,While continuing to hold the desired meter settings with shutter button slightly depressed move (aim) the camera to your subject then shoot.,-1,1
1715,1,62,With practice you will get great shots and gain proficiency.,-1,1
1715,1,63,You may need to set the EV to -.3=>-.7 for less contrasty scenes.,-1,1
1715,1,64,Reducing the exposure settings to a correct level will increase color saturation.,-1,1
1715,1,65,The colors on the TX1 are accurate, perhaps too accurate when comparing shots to the way we view scenes through polarized sunglasses etc.,-1,0
1715,1,66,The view screen is very unforgiving and will lead you to believe your shots are more contrasty and grainy than they actually are.,-1,0
1715,1,67,Using an HD monitor will pleasantly surprise you as to how good the shots are when compared to the view screen.,-1,0
1715,1,68,When your shots look good on the view screen, they will be even more pleasing on a correctly calibrated HD monitor.2) The white balance options never seem to look right on the view screen.,-1,0
1715,1,69,Daylight looks too cool, but is not when viewed with a calibrated monitor.,-1,0
1715,1,70,Cloudy works best at dusk, but will over warm and de-saturate mid to late day cloudy conditions.,-1,0
1715,1,71,Incandescent is fair but not great.,-1,0
1715,1,72,Exception: use auto with florescent lighting including compact florescents.,-1,0
1715,1,73,The two florescent settings are just goofy.,-1,0
1715,1,74,The user calibrated setting unfortunately is entirely useless.,-1,0
1715,1,75,Never have I experienced even a close balance correction using that setting in this camera, especially using a grey card.,-1,0
1715,1,76,Fortunately, P with some of the white balance settings used after experimentation will get you great shots.3),-1,0
1715,1,77,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.,-1,1
1715,1,78,Sony addressed this in newer cameras, but then you have to tolerate the "upgrades".,-1,1
1715,1,79,Incidentally, the newest duo "pro" cards are not compatible with some older readers even if they accommodate Sony cards.... go figure.4),-1,1
1715,1,80,My biggest gripe: Once desirable P settings are made for current exposure requirements, they are retained when the camera is shut off FOR THE P SETTINGS ONLY.,-1,1
1715,1,81,Switching to any other mode defaults the settings to the terrible AUTO everything requiring the photographer to reset all those undesirable Sony auto settings.,-1,1
1715,1,82,Fortunately, when returning to P you'll find your settings have returned.,-1,1
1715,1,83,The auto default feature is a ridiculous inexcusable encumbrance.,-1,1
1715,1,84,To my knowledge this has not been resolved on the newer models.In summary, considering what the TX1 can do once the initiation process is completed, it is the best Sony compact camera offered despite being introduced well over two years ago.,-1,1
1716,1,0,Gotta Love It.,-1,0
1716,1,1,If your looking for a quick easy point and shoot, this camera is for you.,-1,0
1716,1,2,Even my kids were able to use it with ease.,-1,0
1716,1,3,I had searched several different brands as well as newer models of this make for some time.Pros:Shutter is quicker then the newer models available.Takes nice clear macro shots.,-1,0
1716,1,4,My kids saved a bee from the pool and I thought I'd test out the macro ability.,-1,1
1716,1,5,I'm no Pro Photographer, but I was amazed what this little camera could do.Turns on quick for those "I just gotta get this on cam"Video is quick and easy and you dont get that shaking movement when your panning around.It fit into the front pocket of my skinny jeans.There is more, I just can't think of it at the moment.Cons:Only two things that bug me but not to the point where I'd have chosen another cam was(1) the screen can be a little touchy.,-1,0
1716,1,6,If slide is open you can accidently adjust settings and not be quite ready for that candid shot.(2),-1,1
1716,1,7,This model has to have Sony card.,-1,1
1716,1,8,Newer models can use either a Sony card or SD card.,-1,1
1717,1,0,small but wish it better low light.,-1,1
1717,1,1,great day pics and motion pics night with out flash could be better video is amazing like it were a camcorder.,-1,0
1718,1,0,Very nice camera.,-1,0
1718,1,1,This is one of the most awesome camera I have.,-1,0
1718,1,2,Good job Sony for making this.,-1,1
1718,1,3,The battery lasts super long.,-1,1
1718,1,4,(No kidding) The video feature is really awesome, and I believe it is better than most of the "cheap" video camera out there.,-1,1
1718,1,5,This one is totally worth the money.,-1,1
1718,1,6,I highly recommend taking picture in the P mode with white balance set to flash.,-1,1
1718,1,7,The only draw back is the flash may not get to the lower left corner, but it's rarely to see this happen.,-1,1
1718,1,8,(you only see it in certain lighting condition).,-1,1
1719,1,0,It just works.,-1,0
1719,1,1,Takes better pictures than any other camera I've owned.,-1,0
1719,1,2,I paid more for it and don't feel ripped off.,-1,0
1719,1,3,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.,-1,0
1719,1,4,Also, I don't like that you have to be in 4:3 mode to get the full 10 mp but I think that's just an area of the picture issue (I love shooting in 16:9 . . .,-1,0
1719,1,5,don't care if other people think that's bad, because that's the only way I display the pics.),-1,1
1719,1,6,Suppose that can't be helped.,-1,1
1720,1,0,Quick and simple, just what I need.,-1,0
1720,1,1,I purchased this camera after trying and returning the Canon PowerShot SD1300IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Blue).,-1,0
1720,1,2,The main subject of most of my pictures is my very active toddler, and the Canon's shutter lag time was ridiculous - in some instances it would take a full 2 seconds to take the picture, at which point my kid would no longer be in the room, let alone in the frame.,-1,1
1720,1,3,So I returned it and began searching for a point-and-shoot camera with a quick shutter speed, which was my main priority.The Sony's shutter speed is exactly what I need.,-1,1
1720,1,4,It takes pictures quickly, and the quality of the shots is usually excellent.,-1,0
1720,1,5,The "burst shot" feature and the panoramic feature are fun, although admittedly I don't often use them.,-1,0
1720,1,6,The controls are pretty intuitive and easy for an amateur like me to figure out.,-1,0
1720,1,7,I can go days without charging it, while taking hundreds of pictures in the meantime.After using the camera for about three months, I have discovered a few details I'm unhappy with.,-1,0
1720,1,8,It's annoying that it only takes the proprietary (and expensive) Sony memory stick instead of the usual SD card that all my other cameras have used, but that's not too big a deal.,-1,1
1720,1,9,The biggest problem I've had is the USB connection - the plug on the camera end has always seemed a little wobbly and unstable, and over time it stopped connecting at all.,-1,1
1720,1,10,I can send it in for repairs, but I'm not prepared to go 4-6 weeks without a camera, so I just bought a USB card reader.,-1,1
1720,1,11,Problem solved, but it meant shelling out extra money.,-1,1
1720,1,12,I wish it used a different style of connector, because I've never had this problem before.Overall, though, I'm thrilled with this camera.,-1,1
1720,1,13,It's easy to whip out and snap a shot when the moment is right.,-1,0
1720,1,14,It's perfect for users like me who need a simple, high-quality point-and-shoot camera.,-1,0
1721,1,0,Great pocket camera.,-1,0
1721,1,1,This is a great little camera.,-1,0
1721,1,2,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.,-1,0
1721,1,3,I replaced a Canon SD1400IS with this one, because I have two little kids, and needed a super fast focusing camera to keep from missing shots.,-1,0
1721,1,4,The only negative I could even say about this is that some of the pictures turn out a little on the cool side.,-1,0
1721,1,5,It's an easy fix with any editing software, but most people probably won't even notice it.,-1,0
1722,1,0,LOVE IT :) So far so good with this camera!! It's TINY and ultra compact.,-1,0
1722,1,1,I love the touchscreen.. THe smile detection is cool too.,-1,0
1722,1,2,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.,-1,0
1722,1,3,For all of my intents and purposes this camera is great, I really wanted a big screen, I wanted touchscreen and I wanted it small.,-1,0
1722,1,4,And of course it had to be Sony.,-1,1
1722,1,5,So check, check, and check!,-1,1
1723,1,0,Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX1/L 10MP "Exmor R" CMOS Digital Camera with 3-inch Touch-Screen LCD (Blue) Camera was very easy to figure out.,-1,1
1723,1,1,It delivers great pictures in every light.,-1,0
1723,1,2,We are having so much fun.,-1,0
1723,1,3,It is fast and versatile and everything would would want in reasonably priced good camera.,-1,0
1723,1,4,We're beginners but the photos we are taking are winding up proudly displayed on our walls.,-1,0
1723,1,5,The video function works great but I wish I  had  a mike I could plug in for better sound.,-1,0
1723,1,6,Resoultion is awesome.,-1,0
1723,1,7,Battery life could be better.,-1,0
1723,1,8,Overall, best digital camera I have used.,-1,0
1723,1,9,100% Satisfied,-1,0
1724,1,0,Elegant looking camera, love it!,-1,0
1724,1,1,I love the camera, unfortunately I returned it, because it had a lot of scratches, next time I'll buy a new one.,-1,0
1725,1,0,This is the best compact camera/video out there with all the desired features - small enough to hang around your neck with a lanyard, of course; great picture quality; and video camera.,-1,0
1725,1,1,The price is a little bit on the high side but it's worth it.,-1,1
1726,1,0,All the features are a little hard to grasp.,-1,0
1726,1,1,The touch screen is very sensitive.,-1,0
1726,1,2,I'm still learning about everything it does.,-1,0
1726,1,3,If you plan on taking any video you will def.,-1,0
1726,1,4,need a bigger memory.,-1,0
1726,1,5,A little costly for the camera in my opinion.,-1,0
1727,1,0,sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet (her words) purchased for my 16 year old daughter for an outstanding sophomore year of high school.,-1,0
1727,1,1,she loves it.,-1,0
1727,1,2,not easy making a 16 year old happy, but this does it.,-1,0
1728,1,0,Great Little Camera.,-1,0
1728,1,1,This is my first touch screen camera and I was hesitant.,-1,0
1728,1,2,However, it is very easy to use and the instruction booklet is great.,-1,0
1728,1,3,Takes good pictures inside or out.,-1,0
1728,1,4,Easy to carry and handle.,-1,0
1728,1,5,Easy to download pictures and clear the photos from the camera.I bought extra memory and will purchase an extra battery for my cruise trip.The only cons I have noticed so far :  Wish it had a more powerful zoom.,-1,0
1728,1,6,Have to clean touch screen alot due to my own fingerprints.,-1,0
1729,1,0,good features for the price.,-1,0
1729,1,1,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.,-1,0
1729,1,2,i would have liked that i had more control over the specifications in the pictures, too automatic for me.,-1,0
1729,1,3,I hated it doesn't has black and white mode.,-1,0
1729,1,4,The good things: the size, the exmor cmos sensor and the sweep panorama is great.,-1,0
1730,1,0,Cool Camera.,-1,1
1730,1,1,I've owned Sony cameras for years and would never look at another brand of camera, until now.,-1,1
1730,1,2,It seems like something has changed in the recent years.,-1,1
1730,1,3,My older Sony Digital Cameras worked great in all conditions - low light, outside, indoors.,-1,1
1730,1,4,I never had a problem with blurriness or noise in my pictures.,-1,1
1730,1,5,But my camera broke down last summer after years of use on vacations (at beaches and on the run), and I was forced to get a new camera.,-1,1
1730,1,6,At first I looked at the Sony W290.,-1,1
1730,1,7,I looked at the reviews and they were mixed, but I gave it a shot.,-1,1
1730,1,8,Not happy.,-1,1
1730,1,9,All I got were very blurry pictures which was a huge disappointment after never having this problem in the past.,-1,1
1730,1,10,So I moved on to the Sony TX1, which was a GRATE improvement.,-1,1
1730,1,11,I love the design and the style of the camera.,-1,1
1730,1,12,It's a great pocket camera and it seems to have conquered the low light issues, to a point at least.,-1,1
1730,1,13,I love the features of this camera, but I'm still tossed about it, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars.,-1,0
1730,1,14,I have a couple concern.First, some Pros:- Very stylish camera.-,-1,0
1730,1,15,Love the touch screen.,-1,0
1730,1,16,Very easy to use once you get into it.-,-1,0
1730,1,17,The indoor shots seem pretty good (I'm still working on this.,-1,0
1730,1,18,It still doesn't seem to be as good as my "old" cameras).-,-1,0
1730,1,19,Love the neat features, like the screen shows with music, panaromic shots, HD video, face detection.,-1,0
1730,1,20,All of these things make this camera very "hip" and up to the times.My concerns:- Small zoom.,-1,1
1730,1,21,For a camera of this price, I feel it needs a much better zoom.,-1,1
1730,1,22,7x would give more flexibility when taking pictures.,-1,1
1730,1,23,It seems like most the Sony models lack on the zoom capability.-,-1,1
1730,1,24,Taking HD Video takes up so much space on the memory card.,-1,1
1730,1,25,Be prepared to download to the computer, or a portable computer drive that stores a lot of gigs.,-1,1
1730,1,26,I still struggle with how to edit these HD files and put them together to form a movie and burn to a DVD.,-1,1
1730,1,27,The documents say you can take video in lower version, but I haven't figured that out either.,-1,1
1730,1,28,It seems all my video files are HUGE.,-1,1
1730,1,29,This could be my user error, so I take some responsibility, it just seems like this should be easy to accomplish.Overall it's a great point and shoot camera.,-1,0
1730,1,30,Some people might not like the touch screen, but it's actually quite easy to manipulate.,-1,0
1730,1,31,In the end the video capability might be too advanced for me and I had to return it in lieu of basic video functions.,-1,0
1730,1,32,I need to educate myself on this...being able to edit and play with the HD video files.,-1,0
1731,1,0,Great little digital.,-1,0
1731,1,1,Touchscreen makes managing functions fairly easy, and camera's "Easy" mode performs very intelligently in most settings.,-1,0
1731,1,2,Battery life is better than any other compact digital I have owned.,-1,0
1731,1,3,Panorama is really quite amazing!,-1,0
1731,1,4,Haven't shot any video.,-1,0
1732,1,0,A really nice camera.,-1,0
1732,1,1,Intuitive navigation, good video, and great low light photos.The muli sequence shots are very handy but take some time to process.,-1,0
1732,1,2,The smile detector feature is a lot of fun.,-1,0
1732,1,3,It could have used some more zoom and people with large hands might find it hard to hold.,-1,0
1733,1,0,Dust trapped inside lens, again!,-1,1
1733,1,1,Okay, I really loved this camera and the picture quality.,-1,1
1733,1,2,The other reviews cover that pretty well so I'll keep it brief.After only 1 month the shutter stopped closing completely, and the repair process is no fun at all.It's been LESS THAN 2 MONTHS since I bought this camera and there is already dust trapped INSIDE the lens, so many of my pictures have visible spots all over them.Sony's customer service is far from good compared to other companies I've worked with.,-1,1
1733,1,3,You have to package the camera yourself and ship it to Texas for several weeks with no replacement in the interim.,-1,1
1733,1,4,I NEED my camera all the time so what am I supposed to do?I have had 4 Sony Cybershots over a period of 7 years and I think I've had it.,-1,1
1733,1,5,The previous Sony Cybershot I had also had dust trapped inside the lens also, and it gradually kept accumulating over the past year until I had to abandon it and get this one.,-1,1
1733,1,6,At least the first two Cybershots I had did not have this issue.,-1,1
1734,1,0,fast prompt service at a good price.,-1,0
1734,1,1,the item came even faster than anticipated.As ordered.,-1,0
1734,1,2,The price was the best I found on the web.,-1,0
1734,1,3,I amstill in the process of learning all the features.,-1,0
1734,1,4,I amvery impressed with the low light feature.,-1,0
1734,1,5,I was able totake pictures with no flash using just the ambient lightand the pictures were beautiful.,-1,0
1734,1,6,The subject was a 2-year-oldand it was nice not to be blinding her with an obnoxiousflash.,-1,0
1734,1,7,It also took some very nice landscape photos outdoorsusing the simple Easy option.,-1,0
1734,1,8,I had no trouble adapting tonot having a viewfinder.,-1,1
1734,1,9,The LCD screen is adjustable todeal with the brightness of the environment.,-1,1
1734,1,10,I was able tosee my subjects whether I was in sunlight or shadows, insideand outside.,-1,1
1734,1,11,This is at the upper end of point and shootcameras from a price perspective and I have to say I thinkit was worth the extra expense.,-1,1
1735,1,0,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.,-1,0
1735,1,1,If you like to fiddle to get the right photo, this is a terrific camera.,-1,0
1735,1,2,Great size and lots of features.,-1,0
1735,1,3,So far it has worked really well.,-1,0
1736,1,0,Potent pocket.,-1,0
1736,1,1,A nice advance of over previously-owned T-100, T-300.,-1,0
1736,1,2,Low-light performance is, all things considered, very impressive.Panorama and burst features are very useful.Camera is smaller than it appears, but still easy to handle.,-1,0
1737,1,0,Sony DSC-WX1 , A disappointing Camera.,-1,1
1737,1,1,Let just start by writing that, I've been a fan and using sony product for about 25-30 years and i spend tens of thousands of dollars on sony products.,-1,1
1737,1,2,But i tought this camera would be different compare to others.I dont understand other reviewers that they claim about the positive experience they'e had with this camera??!!,-1,1
1737,1,3,I tried most of this camera's features, the result was disappointing.,-1,1
1737,1,4,When you take photo at 5MP , 7MP, 8MP and 10 MP, you can clearly see the 5MP shot is much clearer than the rest (if you dont believe me, try it yourself side by side).,-1,1
1737,1,5,So what is the point of buying 10MP camera when 5 mega pixel shots are better?,-1,1
1737,1,6,I tried many of new 10 and 12 MP cameras, to my surprised, All of them took better picture at 5MP than 8 or 10MP.,-1,1
1737,1,7,I must say, the reason i were attracted to this camera were, 1) sony quality 2)G-Lens and 3) The sensor and processor.,-1,1
1737,1,8,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).,-1,1
1737,1,9,All photos that i took using this camera were very dull and lifeless.,-1,1
1737,1,10,I loved all of the features of this camera but the first thing that i care about is quality of photos which this camera has lack of it.,-1,1
1737,1,11,Recording HD movie were also disappointing, when you are recording you can actually hear sound of zooming and focusing when you play them back.,-1,1
1737,1,12,Quality of video was not good enough to pay the extra money.,-1,1
1737,1,13,I do NOT recommend this camera not even at $100,-1,1
1738,1,0,Not Happy.,-1,1
1738,1,1,Still image and print quality are very important to me.,-1,1
1738,1,2,My 5 year old Sony that finally broke was 7 mp and had much better still image quality.,-1,1
1738,1,3,I could take a picture and zoom in and it would be super clear for editing and cropping.,-1,0
1738,1,4,This one is always blurry, nomatter the mode.,-1,0
1738,1,5,It is extremely frustrating.,-1,0
1738,1,6,Also, I usually back up movies and pics to DVD to watch later and it was super annoying that your computer has to be new to watch the videos.,-1,0
1738,1,7,You can upgrade your video card, but that is expensive and doesn't even work that well.,-1,0
1738,1,8,The videos do look good though.,-1,0
1739,1,0,Awesome point and shoot camera.,-1,0
1739,1,1,I'm very happy with this camera.,-1,0
1739,1,2,Photo quality under poor light conditions is amazing; photos are better than expected.,-1,0
1739,1,3,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.,-1,0
1739,1,4,Panorama function is also incredible; it does a very good job with landscapes.My only concern is battery life; it's less than expected, so you will need an extra battery and / or a power supply near to you.,-1,0
1739,1,5,Other than this, I absolutely recommend this product.,-1,0
1740,1,0,This is my 3rd Sony Cybershot.,-1,1
1740,1,1,My only negative is it didn't have a Memory Stick included.The battery doesn't last as long as the T100.,-1,1
1740,1,2,Picture quality is fantastic for such a small camera.,-1,0
1741,1,0,Almost very happy.,-1,1
1741,1,1,After about 5 months with this camera I have produced some very high quality images even at 5 m pixels.,-1,1
1741,1,2,The video's are amazingly brilliant and sharp too.,-1,0
1741,1,3,The only problem I have had is with dust backscatter.,-1,1
1741,1,4,I took about 100 images at a recent wedding I attended and at least half of them have ugly white rings which are present at different locations on the affected images.,-1,1
1741,1,5,This only happens on the images that the flash fired.,-1,1
1741,1,6,I was advised that this is a technical problem caused by the flash being to close to the lens.,-1,1
1741,1,7,I was shooting in what would normally be considered a dust free area (Church and restaurant)so it is a design flaw.,-1,0
1741,1,8,Sony Cybershot DSC-TX1 10.1MP "Exmor R" CMOS Digital Camera with 3-inch Touch-Screen LCD Digital Camera in Grey + 4GB Accessory Kit,-1,0
1742,1,0,Such a great camera!,-1,0
1742,1,1,I bought for my husband for Christmas then we traveled to Mexico, Guatemala and Belize.,-1,0
1742,1,2,He loved it!,-1,0
1742,1,3,Very easy to use and great options!,-1,0
1742,1,4,In the end, it was hard to make him stop playing with it!,-1,0
1743,1,0,Well, I just sold my new SONY DSC-TX1 in Costa Rica for the same price I paid online a few weeks back.,-1,1
1743,1,1,But how often do you spin around in circles taking pano shots?,-1,1
1743,1,2,But not a deal maker for me.However, I could NOT get the iAUTO mode to compare to my $110 LUMIX for indoor shots of humans - THE most difficult task of a lens.,-1,1
1743,1,3,The camera did a fine job correcting red eye, but the flash system left odd shadows against people.,-1,0
1743,1,4,Also, the color balance wasn't as natural looking as my Canon SD940 or LUMIX.,-1,0
1743,1,5,For sunset Pacific shots, the SONY didn't capture the clarity and vibrance of the Canon (best) or LUMIX either.HANDHELD TWILIGHT mode is what everyone raves about for "oh so natural" shots in low light situations.,-1,0
1743,1,6,However, did you ever try looking at "no flash" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode?,-1,0
1743,1,7,Maybe if you're a Pro, this slick twilight SONY mode may lure you in.,-1,0
1743,1,8,I didn't see the need for it.VIDEO:,-1,1
1743,1,9,I must say this is THE ONLY reason to hang onto this $300-400 camera.,-1,1
1743,1,10,In HD mode, the anti-motion technology is amazing and clarity is as good as the pricier Canons, which are much larger.,-1,1
1743,1,11,The other very cool thing was the ability to zoom while filming... with no motor noise.,-1,1
1743,1,12,Stunning results in the bedroom even in low light :)In conclusion, aside from the HD video quality, my SONY comparison photos against the Canon SD940 or SD880 and FS7 LUMIX failed across the board.... indoor, outdoor, beach, sunset etc.And SONY doesn't even have an indoor or party mode like Panasonic.,-1,1
1743,1,13,This annoyed me as iAUTO couldn't get it right all the time, and I'd miss shots of a 2yr old trying to change setting on the touch screen, which kinda sucks as it gets so dirty from oily fingers.I'm waiting for the new Canon SX210 IS - much higher zoom, likely HD as-good as SONY, wide angle lens and larger 3" screen.,-1,1
1743,1,14,This one, with the exception of a F/3.1 lens (why not 2.8 or better?), seems to answer all my prayers with a price point under $350.SONY.... THEY'RE ALL ABOUT GIMMICKS AND LACK OF TRUE PERFORMANCE.,-1,1
1744,1,0,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.,-1,0
1744,1,1,I have had two of these, unfortunately both suffered from a hiss and hum clearly audible during filming playback.,-1,0
1744,1,2,The video was decent but not great, and one of the cameras was very slow to focus while filming which was very annoying.,-1,0
1744,1,3,I didn't find the video that much better than the standard definition video from my G9.,-1,0
1744,1,4,I can't really add to what everyone has already said about pictures, they are adequate but colors are not as vibrant or true to life as my G9 and the high speed shutter shots are very grainy and low quality so I personally wouldn't feel that great using it during action shots, but I guess something is better than nothing, even if it is grainy.,-1,0
1744,1,5,It is very portable and feels nice in the hand.,-1,0
1744,1,6,My wife felt it was too light and a little slippery but this is compared to my G9 and her T5 which has good ergo's.,-1,0
1744,1,7,If the vid audio wasn't so noisy I would keep it because, and most importantly, for it's size it is a good camera with nice features.,-1,0
1745,1,0,Awesome Little Camera.,-1,0
1745,1,1,I come from Canon S80 so when I opened the box and realize how tiny is the WX1 I thought to myself, there is no way that this minicamera can take good pictures at all...I was wrong !!!Sony has broken a paradigm with this camera in low light conditions.[...],-1,1
1746,1,0,not much better than my seven year old Sony DSC-T30.,-1,1
1746,1,1,It does take better photos in low light, but overall picture quality for an amateur user isn't that great.,-1,1
1747,1,0,Display failed after 2 months.,-1,1
1747,1,1,I pre-ordered this camera on 8/20/2009 (based on a glowing review [...]) and it arrived on 9/21/2009.,-1,1
1747,1,2,I put it through its paces and enjoyed the trick low-light features and the HD video.,-1,1
1747,1,3,After 6-8 weeks I noticed that it wasn't holding a charge for as long as I would expect (I've owned several of the Canon PowerShot family of compact digital cameras).,-1,1
1747,1,4,And then 2-3 weeks ago when I turned it on the display started "going all white" -- first in stripes and then full-screen.,-1,1
1747,1,5,All pixels on.,-1,1
1747,1,6,So of course there is no reliable way to take photos and certainly no way to review photos.I called Amazon.com this morning and the customer service representative told me I had to call Sony.I visited the Sony website, entered my information, and was given instructions to ship the camera back to Sony (at my expense) for free warranty repair (luckily it was within the 90 day window).I've owned Canon digital cameras for 7 years and never had a hardware failure in the first three months like this.,-1,1
1748,1,0,Recently I upgraded from the Sony dsc w1 to the wx1 (5 years of technology development in between).,-1,0
1748,1,1,Overall I am not very impressed.,-1,0
1748,1,2,The cameras has some great attributes such as the lens itself, weight and form factor but also comes with baggage: Non-standard cable connector (yup - you are on your own when you leave the house - not sure what Sony was thinking here and forget to stream via an hdmi cable to your hdtv), no integrated battery charging, compression of the pictures is not great (and there is no quality control adjustment), the software menu is limited compared to the original dsc w1 (e.g.,-1,0
1748,1,3,no manual mode), the iso is out of your control except in program mode, the display setting is useless (you have to live with super bright lcd screen that eats your battery away if you are interested on image info such as exposure/aperture/iso) and the average image quality is less compared the older dsc w1 (5MP) when taking the compression fragments (looks like a noise picture) into consideration.,-1,1
1748,1,4,The camera has the advertised light sensitivity but I am not sure how much Sony can claim it on the cmos imager: The lens has an aperture of 2.4 (more light gets onto the imager) what is better than most comparable cameras out there as well the iso value goes very easily through the roof (noisy pictures).,-1,1
1748,1,5,The panorama feature works well and the optical image stabilizer seems to do its trick (if you are not too shaky, you can get a steady shot with a 1/8 exposure time).,-1,1
1748,1,6,Overall: If you are interested in a small, light, good looking and compact point-and-forget camera that makes ok pictures, this camera might work for you.,-1,1
1748,1,7,For people who look for good image quality, stay away from it until the 1st firmware upgrade comes along and see if Sony fixed some issues such as display and image compression.,-1,1
1749,1,0,battery cover can break in one year.,-1,1
1749,1,1,Bought the camera and just before one year, the battery cover door broke -not due to mistreating-.,-1,1
1749,1,2,Sony repaired the damage under the warranty and not cost at all.,-1,1
1749,1,3,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.,-1,1
1749,1,4,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.,-1,1
1749,1,5,They asked for US$400 to repair a tiny door.I am very disappointed for the customer support from Sony.,-1,1
1750,1,0,Great WHEN it worked.,-1,0
1750,1,1,I bought this camera a little over a year ago as a Christmas present for my girlfriend.,-1,0
1750,1,2,Initially, and for some time afterwards, we were both thrilled with the purchase.,-1,0
1750,1,3,The camera is very easy to use and took beautiful pictures.,-1,0
1750,1,4,The panoramic pictures were awesome, and the video was very clean (both picture and audio).,-1,0
1750,1,5,Then JUST after the one year mark had passed (of course!,-1,1
1750,1,6,Manufacturer warranty only good for one year) the camera began failing in multiple ways.I'd power the camera on and immediately a message would pop up indicating that I needed to use a compatible battery, then would power off.,-1,1
1750,1,7,It did this with the battery that came with the camera.,-1,1
1750,1,8,I did some research and found that I was FAR from the only one experiencing this issue.,-1,1
1750,1,9,Many suggested that buying a cheap knock-off battery would fix the issue, and they were absolutely correct.,-1,1
1750,1,10,Now the camera powers on and stays on.Unfortunately, my problems were not over.,-1,1
1750,1,11,Once I finally got a battery that functioned again, I found that the shutter would no longer open/close properly.,-1,1
1750,1,12,Even if I force the shutter open with my fingers, it will just slowly fall back to the closed position.I called Sony and they refused to help (predictably, as it is no longer under warranty).,-1,1
1750,1,13,I took it to my local camera shop to see if they could fix it, but all they do is send it in to Sony to have them repair it (for $260!).,-1,1
1750,1,14,Just about 13-14 months after purchasing the camera, it sits on my desk as a paper weight while I try to sell it as broken on an auction site.,-1,1
1750,1,15,I now need to buy a new camera for an upcoming trip, and I can assure you it will not be a Sony.Hope this helps,Damian,-1,1
1751,1,0,Not worth the price.,-1,1
1751,1,1,There are many problems with the camera.,-1,1
1751,1,2,The placement of the lens allows for others to touch or cover the lens with their fingers if they are taking a picture for you.,-1,1
1751,1,3,Also, many of my pictures that I have taken have been blurry, pixelated, and of poor quality.,-1,1
1751,1,4,Many of my pictures have spots in them even though I do clean the lens.,-1,1
1751,1,5,I am not a amateur photographer and expected the quality of this camera to be much higher considering the cost.,-1,1
1752,1,0,Sony DSC-TX1 vs Casio Exilim EX-S12.,-1,1
1752,1,1,I ended up with both cameras and have used them for about a year.,-1,1
1752,1,2,I am a point-and-shoot camera user with no professional experience in this area.I found myself carrying both cameras at the same time.,-1,1
1752,1,3,Since they are small, one goes in the left front pocket the other in the right.,-1,1
1752,1,4,I ended up using the Sony for still pictures and the Casio for movies.The Sony is very easy to pull out, flip up the lens guard and shoot.,-1,0
1752,1,5,The still pictures are high quality and fit my unprofessional needs perfectly.The Casio Exilim EX-S12 12MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD has a "lens" that automatically extends when you turn the camera on.,-1,0
1752,1,6,It's takes a little bit longer to fire up, but does take a decent photo.,-1,0
1752,1,7,The movies however are what I find are a better quality and the format is easier for me to use.,-1,1
1752,1,8,Google Picasa will import the movies along with the pictures in one seamless transfer.The Sony requires some switching on the touch screen to get to the movie mode.,-1,1
1752,1,9,It's not terrible but the Casio, by comparison, has a button for still pictures and another for movies so it's very easy to switch modes.Our iPhones get a 10+ rating from us on ease of use.,-1,1
1752,1,10,That screen is easy to maneuver around.,-1,1
1752,1,11,The Sony "touch screen" only gets a 3 rating.,-1,1
1752,1,12,It works, but you need to have nimble fingers and if you've used an iPhone/iPod you'll be disappointed in Sony.,-1,1
1752,1,13,I'm sure they'll improve this in the future though.To load the Sony "still" pictures into Picasa is an easy process.,-1,1
1752,1,14,But, if you take movies you have to locate the subdirectory on the memory card and access that directly.,-1,1
1752,1,15,It's not hard once you know how to do it, but it is an extra step the Casio doesn't require.If I had to choose between the two, I would go with the Sony.,-1,1
1752,1,16,But, I'm really glad I have both of them because they each have some very positive features.UPDATE 7/20/12: From the beginning, the touch screen had an unusual look as if a screen protector was on it.,-1,1
1752,1,17,I thought I'd eventually figure out how to take it off.,-1,1
1752,1,18,Today I visited a camera shop and they said it is the anti-glare material coming off of the screen.,-1,1
1752,1,19,They suggested I contact Sony (I didn't buy the camera from them).,-1,1
1752,1,20,I found the following message in Sony's online repair area: The cost to repair this unit under our Flat Rate Program is $211.00,,-1,1
1752,1,21,Return shipping is included in this price.,-1,1
1752,1,22,So... I'll be using it as-is until it goes out completely.,-1,1
1753,1,0,Sony DSC-TX1 camera.,-1,0
1753,1,1,This Sony camera is a great small portable digital camera.,-1,0
1753,1,2,Good sharp photos and a ton of features.,-1,1
1753,1,3,You can use as a "point and shoot" using the "Easy Mode" feature for the average photographer or hit the menu and you then have all the MANY features at your disposal for the more advanced person.,-1,1
1753,1,4,Take time to read and understand the instruction manual!Be sure and buy an xtra battery as the camera will gobble up the available "juice" while shooting.,-1,1
1754,1,0,Suitable for low light only.,-1,1
1754,1,1,This camera takes great pictures in low-light and that's all about this camera's positive points.,-1,1
1754,1,2,There are many problems however:1.,-1,1
1754,1,3,There is always a shadow in the lower left corner of the pictures (because of very short distance between flash and lens).2.,-1,1
1754,1,4,Pictures come rounded (probably because of wide angle).3.,-1,1
1754,1,5,Twilight mode is very slow and so it's a pain to get good pictures in good-light conditions.I have returned the camera and promptly got my refund.,-1,1
1755,1,0,Best price for the product and delivered as promised.,-1,0
1755,1,1,This was the best deal for the WX1 the moment I ordered it and it came as expected in original box with SONY warranty.,-1,0
1755,1,2,No problems encountered so far.,-1,0
1756,1,0,Almost the Perfect Camera!,-1,0
1756,1,1,I have the big brother to the WX1, the HX1.,-1,0
1756,1,2,I took to Italy last year and it proved to be the perfect camera for the trip.,-1,0
1756,1,3,I had wanted a small pocket camera for those times when I wanted to just slip a camera in my pocket for those unplanned photo opts.,-1,0
1756,1,4,I saw the Wx1 and with many of the same features as it's big brother despite being a mini-pocket camera.,-1,0
1756,1,5,It comes with 5X zoom, optical image stabilization, and best of all Sony CMOS sensor which gives great photos in low light without a serious loss of picture quality.,-1,0
1756,1,6,And, that is to say nothing about it being able to capture HD quality video as well and panorama mode for wide still shoots!,-1,0
1756,1,7,Of course it includes intelligent auto mode, face and smile detection.The only negative I found with the camera is that it's color rendition tends to be on the cool side.,-1,0
1756,1,8,The color can be adjusted in most video editing programs, so it should not stop you from buying the camera.,-1,0
1756,1,9,Other than this it's a great, "little" camera for those who want the quality, versatility and optics provided by Sony and their "G" series of lenses.,-1,0
1757,1,0,I have only used this camera for a few days and I would say that I really like it.,-1,0
1757,1,1,But, you do get mixed results on the photos.,-1,0
1757,1,2,You need to know what mode to be in to get a good shot and, as an amateur, I am not always sure what to do.,-1,0
1757,1,3,When I have the right settings the photos are rather good.The handheld twilight mode can produce some excellent shots, but when it is too dark, there is a lot of noise.,-1,0
1757,1,4,It's hard to expect more out of a camera within this range though.,-1,0
1757,1,5,If you have low light though, it is capable of giving you some great shots.,-1,0
1757,1,6,I think its done well during the day so far, however, I haven't used it that much in bright settings.,-1,1
1757,1,7,I did read the reviews about what settings to use, and that is definitely something you need to know.,-1,1
1757,1,8,Kind of frustrating for someone that wants a true point and shoot (I'm okay with it).The pano mode is fun, but doesn't always stitch the photos well.,-1,0
1757,1,9,It definitely works well in some settings, but in other settings, it is going to suffer.,-1,1
1757,1,10,I haven't used this mode too much yet, hoping to get better at using it.,-1,1
1757,1,11,A very neat feature.Overall, I like the camera a lot.,-1,1
1757,1,12,I haven't had other compacts though, so I can't really compare it to any competitor.,-1,1
1758,1,0,Sony Cyber-Shot DSC WX1.,-1,1
1758,1,1,I like this camera but the only thing I dont like about it, is that the sensor light the redish-orangish light bothers me.,-1,1
1758,1,2,You can take good self group portraits(meaning you can fit in 3 peoples in ur self portrait).,-1,1
1758,1,3,I tested out tha image quality on the shutter speed,its ok but still kinda blurs when taking it, same with Pandoroma sweep.,-1,1
1758,1,4,I dont know if its my camera but this camera kinda sucks at recording, becuz whenever i record it makes a sound in the background recording and its really annoying.,-1,1
1758,1,5,When taking shutter speed it takes a while to recording and process it to save it and show up on camera.,-1,1
1758,1,6,when i went to take shots at during the night tha quality is ok but still needs more improvements.,-1,1
1759,1,0,Disappointing image quality a deal breaker.,-1,1
1759,1,1,I bought this camera to replace my wife's Fujifilm F40 pocket camera, and sad to say the old F40 has a sharper lens and much more accurate colors and generally more pleasing image quality then this Sony WX1 camera!,-1,1
1759,1,2,The other disappointment is the low light image quality which is supposed to be much better than average.,-1,1
1759,1,3,In short, it is not that good.,-1,1
1759,1,4,I expected a lot more from this camera than it delivers in terms of image quality.,-1,1
1759,1,5,In short the WX1 disappoints.,-1,1
1759,1,6,Sony dropped the ball on this one, unfortunately.What's good:+ Range of focal lengths from true wide angle to slight telephoto.+,-1,0
1759,1,7,Sony's IN-Lens image stabilization works extremely well to reduce blur.+,-1,0
1759,1,8,Lens distortion is amazingly low, even at wide angle.+,-1,0
1759,1,9,Shutter lag (time from pushing the shutter button until photo taken),is very low for a pocket camera.What's not so good:-Noise reduction smears details at ISO 400 and above.,-1,0
1759,1,10,(Noticeable even at ISO 160.)-Lens sharpness is very inconsistent and is very dependent upon focal length used.-Build,-1,0
1759,1,11,quality is not that great.,-1,0
1759,1,12,The battery door is flimsy.-Hard,-1,1
1759,1,13,edged rectangular shape of the camera makes it very awkward to hold in the hand.-Panorama,-1,1
1759,1,14,mode is cool, but the image stitching does not work well enough in my opinion.-No,-1,1
1759,1,15,settings adjustments for color hues, saturation.-No,-1,1
1759,1,16,contrast or sharpness adjustment.-The,-1,1
1759,1,17,back-light Exmor-R CMOS sensor sounds great, but is just does not deliver what Sony promised in terms of noticeably better image quality in low light.,-1,1
1759,1,18,In fact, my old Fujifilm F31fd blows this new WX1 camera away in terms of higher ISO and low light image quality, and the F31fd has amazing color fidelity as well!What's really bad:-- Color accuracy.--,-1,1
1759,1,19,Default color saturation and contrast (much too low)-- Auto white balance, even outdoors is the worst I have seen in a digital camera!--,-1,1
1759,1,20,LCD image quality is surprising bad, with crude contrast and tinged colors.--,-1,1
1759,1,21,Flash does not cover the lower left corner when shooting at the widest angle possible, leaving a dark area.--,-1,1
1759,1,22,"Easy" mode is limiting and frustrating.--,-1,1
1759,1,23,"Twilight" mode does nothing really.,-1,1
1759,1,24,Just a waste of time and memory.Conclusion:Even though the Sony WX1 has some nice things going for it, the image quality is sub par for a camera in this price range and the feature set is more gimmick than useful.,-1,1
1759,1,25,In my opinion, there are better cameras for the money.,-1,1
1759,1,26,Better luck next time Sony!,-1,1
1760,1,0,Sorry Sony!,-1,0
1760,1,1,I usually love Sony products, but I'm no fan of their new TX1.,-1,0
1760,1,2,When I first saw this new camera, I thought this could me my next love, but we had a very short honeymoon - about 3 hours - then the ugly separation ensued!I'll be brief and to the point - the video was pretty good, but the pictures were actually horrible.,-1,0
1760,1,3,Instead of there being reduced noise as promised in news and reviews, there seems to be more (see my other reviews for most of the other cameras I've tired), even in bright light.,-1,0
1760,1,4,I'm pretty tech savvy and went through ALL of the setting, trying everything possible to get good consistent pictures, but to no avail!,-1,0
1760,1,5,We set the camera to various ISO settings to try and minimize the noise, but no good.,-1,0
1760,1,6,It just is not good for viewing on the big screen, it most likely be OK for 4 by 6 printing but I did not try to print my samples.,-1,0
1760,1,7,I have a media computer hooked up to my HDTV and the pictures just look terrible!I mentioned above that the video was good and this is true - and I knew this going in - but why did Sony remove the stereo recording?,-1,1
1760,1,8,If the pictures and other features where good, the lack of stereo would have been OK, but WOW what a disappointment all around.This is just my opinion!,-1,1
1760,1,9,I wish these camera makers would actually improve with subsequent models - I just don't get it!,-1,1
1760,1,10,Sorry Sony.,-1,1
1760,1,11,Oh and one more thing, don't tell me to just get a DSLR or it's just a P &S; - I know that already!,-1,1
1760,1,12,I just want the cameras to live up to their billing!,-1,1
1760,1,13,By the way, I have the Panasonic ZS3 and it BLOWS the Sony away.,-1,1
1761,1,0,don't buy this camera.,-1,1
1761,1,1,I've always been a sony camera guy, but this camera has a really big issue that I couldn't believe that it was real when I start testing the camera.,-1,1
1761,1,2,If you take a picture with flash at 24mm, what is a really common use I have to say, it gets a black spot in the lower left corner.,-1,1
1761,1,3,I believe this is due to the flash being close to the lens.In summary, DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA.,-1,1
1761,1,4,I returned it in the next day I received.,-1,1
1761,1,5,Shame on sony for selling this camera with such a basic bug.,-1,1
1761,1,6,Aren't they caring about quality anymore... hope this is an isolate case.,-1,1
1762,1,0,Overall is good.,-1,0
1762,1,1,I had a very hard time to find a right mode to take pictures with a very bright white light at night.However, overall this camera is good.,-1,0
1762,1,2,Vedio quality is great as well.,-1,0
1763,1,0,Another good Sony camera.,-1,0
1763,1,1,This is my third Sony camera.,-1,0
1763,1,2,Contrary to some reviews, the image quality has been oustanding.,-1,0
1763,1,3,The panaroma feature is outstanding and the digital quality for vid capture is excellent.,-1,0
1763,1,4,My only complaint: I'm missing the macro (close-up) feature offered on the previous point-and-shoot models.,-1,0
1763,1,5,Otherwise, very much worth the $$$$$.,-1,0
1764,1,0,Not worth the Hype.,-1,1
1764,1,1,I am returning the camera, really this camera is NOT worth $350.Totally NOT worth the hype.The low light pics were no different than before with LOTS of noise and grains.Those sample photos we see on review sites must have been taken with tripods and low ISO or had Photoshop tweaks.The Sweep Panorama would not interlace the images smoothly and pics had squashed face & thick walls, and thin men.The day light pics had colors washed-out, and sunny blue sky looked like dull gray day.10 fps shots require BRIGHT BRIGHT lighting, otherwise you get 10 absolutely BLURRY shots.Oh.. forgot to mention.There is NO manual control at all.,-1,1
1764,1,2,I mean NOTHING.CAMERA NOT RECOMMENDED.,-1,1
1765,1,0,Do not buy this camera.,-1,1
1765,1,1,Horrible picture quality.,-1,1
1765,1,2,We shut like 200 photos with this new camera - most of them are of poor quality.,-1,1
1765,1,3,Tried all suggestions by previous authors - didn't help much.,-1,1
1765,1,4,Macro mode is indescribably bad.,-1,1
1765,1,5,Our 5 year old camera shoots pictures that are much better and sharp.,-1,1
1765,1,6,Please save your money and time - look elsewhere.,-1,1
1766,1,0,Great quality for the price.,-1,0
1766,1,1,I purchased this camera before a recent family trip to Disney World.,-1,0
1766,1,2,I bought the camera, loaded the software on my laptop and was up and running in less than 2 mins.,-1,0
1766,1,3,The docking station is a must for quick transfers of pictures.,-1,0
1766,1,4,I am also impressed with the software, as it is super easy to create albums, crop pictures, and order prints (Kodak uses Ofoto- which has been a good service for us).,-1,0
1766,1,5,My only complaint (and it is a big one) is taking pictures at night is a pain in the rear.,-1,1
1766,1,6,The engineers must have been drunk when they designed the camera, as they put the flashing green light next to the viewfinder -making it virtually impossible to see through the viewfinder at night.,-1,1
1766,1,7,It is completely annoying.,-1,1
1766,1,8,That being said, the quality of night pictures are good (if your lucky enough to hit your target through the viewfinder).,-1,1
1767,1,0,Great camera, lots of features, easy to use.,-1,0
1767,1,1,Let's start with the negative first to get it out of the way.,-1,0
1767,1,2,This camera does not take good dim light zoomed shots from a distance (as in from the back of a theatre to the stage).,-1,0
1767,1,3,Everything else about this camera is great.,-1,0
1767,1,4,It is easy to use, and well-lit or flashed photos are beautiful.,-1,0
1767,1,5,The picture settings do help in different situations.,-1,0
1767,1,6,The action setting is so good that I was able to take blur-free pictures of my cat jumping in the air after a string.,-1,0
1767,1,7,Other settings include night shots, close up, and distance.,-1,0
1767,1,8,You can also adjust the flash for red-eye, fill, or turn it off.,-1,1
1767,1,9,Due to the delay from the time you press the button to the time the picture is taken, hold the button down slightly prior to taking the picture.,-1,1
1767,1,10,When you do press, it will snap instantly.The movie mode is actually nice.,-1,1
1767,1,11,I didn't think I'd use it, but it's great to have when you want to capture more than just a picture.As an added bonus, the software that comes with it to retrieve and view your pictures is very easy to use.I highly recommend this camera, but you should also get a memory card so you can take more pictures.,-1,1
1768,1,0,4+++ out of 5. Just bought this camera a few days ago.,-1,1
1768,1,1,It could not be easier to operate.,-1,1
1768,1,2,All functions are logical and clear.,-1,1
1768,1,3,The menu items are made as easy as possible.,-1,1
1768,1,4,The only gripe so far are the lens cap is a bit of a pain.,-1,1
1768,1,5,It's supposed to pop off when the camera is turned on, sometimes it doesn't.,-1,1
1768,1,6,The other is the camera needs to have some type of grippable surface added to the body.,-1,1
1768,1,7,I can't get a firm, comfortable grip and feel like the camera could slip from my hands.Pictures are great.,-1,0
1769,1,0,Great buy, great camera!,-1,0
1769,1,1,I got the Kodak DX4530 as a Christmas gift and so far I am impressed.,-1,0
1769,1,2,I see many people have complained of low lighting problems, but all the pics I have taken in low light have turned out fabulous.,-1,1
1769,1,3,I must admit, I am an amatuer photographer and only use it for vacations, special occasions and my 3-year-old nephew but so far my pics have turned out great.This camera is extremely easy to use.,-1,1
1769,1,4,I never even had to open the manual and was taking pictures immediately!,-1,1
1769,1,5,The software is a breeze and I am very pleased with this camera over all.I will say the lens cap is a pain in the butt and Kodak should have made an automatic.,-1,1
1769,1,6,The only other thing negative I have to say is that the green light is right by the viewfinder so its hard to see when taking picutres in the dark.,-1,1
1770,1,0,Very easy to use.,-1,1
1770,1,1,I got this camera about a month ago; I am a big photography nut and am very literate with both SLR cameras and digital.,-1,1
1770,1,2,My father bought this camera for me, and although it wasn't as "high tech" as the cameras I was originally comparing, I must say that I am fairly pleased with the Kodak.The internal memory is nice because you don't have to buy a memory card unless you take several dozen pictures at a time.,-1,1
1770,1,3,It will hold about 24 pictures taken in the highest quality setting.The controls are simple and easy to understand; many digital cameras overwhelm the user with difficult, confusing, and seemingly endless menus.,-1,1
1770,1,4,Unless you like being able to control the shutter speed, aperature, and other manual settings, you'll enjoy how simple the Kodak makes digital photography.,-1,1
1770,1,5,A big plus is that the camera includes a brief explanation for menu items so that the user isn't confused about what abbreviations stand for.Some people have mentioned the blurring that takes place; blurring takes place with most cameras because the shutter speed is generally slower with digital cameras.,-1,1
1770,1,6,And the shutter delay is VERY good with this camera; several digital cameras that I have tested have had horrible shutter lag.,-1,1
1770,1,7,The Kodak's delay is minimal.The dock is nice for convenient recharging; once you're done taking pictures, just put it on the dock.,-1,1
1770,1,8,It's also nice for transferring pictures.,-1,1
1770,1,9,Put the camera on the dock, push the "Kodak" button, and your preferred program automatically opens for downloading.,-1,1
1770,1,10,One downfall I've found is that the software is not compatible with Mac OS X, which I have, so I've had to use iPhoto for downloading pictures.,-1,1
1770,1,11,(Which is fine, since that's where I keep pictures anyway.),-1,1
1770,1,12,(UPDATE:  The software is now compatible with Mac OSX.)In short:  pros of this camera: ease of use, simple menus, convenient recharging, internal memory (no need for memory card).,-1,1
1770,1,13,Cons:  short battery life when using LCD screen for picture taking; lens cap has a tendency to come off when bumped slightly (bad if you're carrying it in a bag).,-1,1
1771,1,0,Not happy.,-1,1
1771,1,1,I purchased the dx4530 after reading review and research.,-1,1
1771,1,2,It takes great pictures,if you have good light.,-1,1
1771,1,3,In low light and what I would not consider low light the pictures are dark even with the flash.,-1,1
1771,1,4,Took pictures at a wedding and all were too dark.,-1,1
1771,1,5,You can with the software make them look alitte better but who wants to do that to every picture.,-1,1
1771,1,6,It does have a low light setting but you have to hold very still and nothing can move in the picture or it will all be a blurr.,-1,1
1771,1,7,I have kids so holding still is not an option for them.,-1,1
1771,1,8,Kodak told me to use a tripod and low light setting, but you then have to carry that around.,-1,1
1771,1,9,I returned my dx4530 to the store.,-1,1
1772,1,0,Poor indoor results.,-1,1
1772,1,1,I have a 3 year old 2MP DX280 that takes much better photos.,-1,1
1772,1,2,Indoor shots are dark and blurring is a problem with the DX4530.,-1,1
1773,1,0,Excellent photo quality - Cheaply made exterior.,-1,0
1773,1,1,This 5.0 digital camera takes perfect photos and the ease of use is great.,-1,0
1773,1,2,I also bought the optional camera dock and it  makes it easy to download photos to your computer, but is way overpriced.The only thing I dislike about this camera is the VERY cheaply made plastic exterior.,-1,0
1773,1,3,I would have been willing to pay a bit more for a more substantial casing.,-1,1
1773,1,4,It was made in China though, and I'm finding goods made in China are very cheaply made.Kodak's warranty service is unacceptable to me.,-1,1
1773,1,5,I attempted to get warranty service and found through their RECORDED message that they repair camera's with used parts.,-1,1
1773,1,6,If your camera needs replacing it will be replaced with a re-furbished camera.,-1,1
1773,1,7,If Kodak decides it isn't covered by their warranty, they will let you know the cost of repair.,-1,1
1773,1,8,If you decline having it repaired, you will be charged $45.00.I send my photos online to Ofoto (Kodak) for developing.,-1,1
1773,1,9,I receive the prints by mail very quickly and the look is exceptional.,-1,1
1774,1,0,bbbllluuuurrrrryyyyy pictures.,-1,1
1774,1,1,I bought this camera because it was one of the lowest priced 5MPs at the time.,-1,1
1774,1,2,The two major complaits I have about the camera is that (1) it takes blurry photos and (2)the lens cap continually comes off.Unless your arm is as still as a table top, many of your photos will be blurry.,-1,1
1774,1,3,I took several photos on a trip to Asia that looked great on the display panel (even when I magnified the image) only to find that they were actually blurry when they were on a computer screen or printed when I arrived back in America.The lense cap can be taken off with the slightest touch.,-1,1
1774,1,4,It continually came off even while it was in my camera case.The other features on the camera are fairly nice.,-1,1
1774,1,5,The menu is very user friendly and the movie making mode is okay (although the camera sometimes rotates the movie 90 degrees, and I haven't found a fix for this yet).,-1,1
1774,1,6,But regardless, the camera takes blurry photos, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.,-1,1
1775,1,0,Not What I Expected.,-1,1
1775,1,1,I had purchased the Kodak DX4330 3.1 mp camera about a year ago and I can't say enough about how good a camera this is.,-1,1
1775,1,2,So when I saw that Kodak came out with a 5mp camera (DX4530)using the same body and docking system that the DX4330 uses, I ordered it in September.,-1,1
1775,1,3,I figured that this camera must been sensational with the 5 megapixels.When I got the camera and used it for a few days I noticed no real difference in the picture quality then the DX4330 in fact on indoor shots the pictures came out a lot darker.I spoke to Kodak and they told me that it was possible that I could have a bad sensor, but they weren't sure.,-1,1
1775,1,4,So I emailed them an indoor picture taken with the DX4330 and the same picture taken with the DX4530 so they can compare and find out if something was wrong.They reviewed the two pictures and told me that the picture from the DX4530 was darker than the one taken with the DX4330 but it fell in the acceptable range.,-1,1
1775,1,5,THEIR acceptable range not mine.They also said that some cameras may be built a little different than others.So I sent the camera back for a replacement.,-1,1
1775,1,6,I received the new DX4530 a couple of days ago.,-1,1
1775,1,7,Took some indoor pictures with it and found out it was no different than the one I sent back.So I am sending this one back and getting a refund.To bad, because as I said the DX4330 is a great little camera, what happened to Kodak technology with the DX4530?,-1,1
1776,1,0,Cheaply Made, NO GOOD IN LOW LIGHT.,-1,1
1776,1,1,Ok, Yes it is 5mp, but what good is that when it takes bad pictures.,-1,1
1776,1,2,In low light the photos are SO dark, and when you use the low light setting or night vision setting, then it is so blurry it is impossible.,-1,1
1776,1,3,Same situation when taking pictures indoors.,-1,1
1776,1,4,It is a 35mm lens adaptable digital camera, but the problem with that is that when you screw the adapter on then you really have no light!!!!,-1,1
1776,1,5,The adapter blocks all light unless you are facing the light and it is sunny outside, even then..  I have a Telephoto lens and also a wide angle lens and they are not cheap lenses.,-1,1
1776,1,6,Not to mention that the thread on the camera is PLASTIC ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE CAMERA, MEANING THAT ONCE YOU STRIP IT THAT'S IT. the entire camera is made of plastic,  mine has not broke yet but it is just so cheaply made to have to pay so much for it.,-1,1
1776,1,7,This would probably be a good camera for someone who just wanted to have a digital camera that was easy and does not know about lighting and shadows and so on.,-1,0
1776,1,8,As far as adding lenses to it to improve, that is out of the question.,-1,0
1777,1,0,IF COMPUTER WON'T RECOGNIZE THE CAMERA OR DRIVERS, TRY THIS! ... a good and inexepensive solution -- don't start pulling your hair out!!  Get an SD/MMC card that fits right in the slot in the side of the camera, and a twenty-dollar USB SD/MMC card reader - you're good to go!!!  Check the owner's manual for instructions on transferring photos from the camera's internal memory to the memory card, then put the card in the card reader and voila!,-1,1
1777,1,1,ADDED BONUS: you will now be able to take more photos at a time - you can fill up both the internal memory and the card's memory.,-1,1
1777,1,2,This is a great little camera by the way, and I would still buy it again.,-1,0
1778,1,0,Poor customer Service.,-1,1
1778,1,1,The camera worked excellent for a short period of time.,-1,1
1778,1,2,I didn't use the camera very often so when it stopped working just after the warranty ran out.,-1,1
1778,1,3,I tryed to contact Kodaks tech dept via the web and could never get in.,-1,1
1778,1,4,I finaly called thier help line and after being on hold for 45 minutes some one finaly picked up the line I was on.,-1,1
1778,1,5,The determined that I would have to send it in for repair and the estimated cost was $125 dollars.,-1,1
1778,1,6,If have any concerns over customer service for you product or reliabillity do not purchase from Kodak.,-1,1
1779,1,0,Be Careful.,-1,1
1779,1,1,Purchased this camera a short time ago.,-1,1
1779,1,2,It was the second Kodak DX camera I purchased.,-1,1
1779,1,3,Many problems with software, many problems with charging both cameras on the charging dock and the flash on both DX's stopped working.,-1,1
1779,1,4,One while in warrenty and the second just out of warrenty.,-1,1
1779,1,5,They want $95.00 plus shipping to repair the flash.,-1,1
1779,1,6,I don't take a lot of pictures- maybe 50 a year that require flash so I warn others about Kodak cameras especially if you take many pics that require flash.,-1,1
1780,1,0,Great camera, software needs improvement.,-1,0
1780,1,1,this camera takes great pictures--amazing details, true bright colors, pictures come out great even in low light settings.,-1,0
1780,1,2,My two problems are:-a 2-second delay between when you  push the button and the camera takes the picture (very hard to take a good picture of an active toddler)-software that came with the camera offers very few editing options, you can only: brighten or darken the shot, crop, make it black and white, and take care of red eyes--that's it.,-1,1
1780,1,3,This is strange since this camera is not intended for professionals who already own powerful photo-editing software.Other than that, I like it and recommend it!,-1,1
1781,1,0,OK for New Digital Camera Users.,-1,1
1781,1,1,This camera is okay if you don't know much about digital cameras.,-1,1
1781,1,2,It's very very easy to use, but it is also very very cheaply made!,-1,1
1781,1,3,It feels like one of those $10  35mm Cameras.,-1,1
1781,1,4,The LCD display is terrible.,-1,1
1781,1,5,I've never seen a cheaper looking 5 megapixel camera than this.,-1,1
1781,1,6,Don't drop it, EVER!,-1,1
1782,1,0,Takes great pictures but beware!!!!!,-1,1
1782,1,1,I loved this camera It took great pictures was easy to use and with the dock a sinch to charge the view screen even worked pretty well when it was sunny....I would have given this camera a 5 before I started having problems with it ...first the view screen stopped working but I could still take pictures..then it would only boot up some times...and now it won't turn on at all...actually I take that back the ready light continously blinks red......I have read many other review that have the same problems with this camera....a word to the wise DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA...you're just asking for it!!,-1,1
1783,1,0,Not the Camera I thought it would be.,-1,1
1783,1,1,Takes to many Blurry Pictures.,-1,1
1783,1,2,Sporting events,indoor party and wedding.,-1,1
1783,1,3,I would say over 60% of the pics came out blurry.,-1,1
1783,1,4,I read the manual a couple times thinking it was me and still produced many blurry pics.,-1,1
1783,1,5,The final straw was a retirement party for a co-worker who wanted the pics for a keep sake and most of them were blurry as well.,-1,1
1783,1,6,I sent the Camera back and got a Canon S50.,-1,1
1783,1,7,I haven't taken 1 bad picture since.,-1,1
1783,1,8,You get what you pay for and for a little bit more I got a much better camera with the Canon.,-1,1
1784,1,0,Good Camera for Beginners.,-1,0
1784,1,1,The Kodak DX4530 was my first point and shoot camera.,-1,0
1784,1,2,For the most part the camera is simple to use and the 5.0 megapixels is good enough for anyone who just wants to take quality pictures.,-1,0
1784,1,3,The downside that I had with the camera, is when I was on "Live View".,-1,0
1784,1,4,Being on Live View allowed me to view my subject through the LCD screen instead of using the viewfinder, and the Live View setting drained a lot of battery power, especially when I was in Macro and Video mode.,-1,0
1784,1,5,I highly recommend rechargeable batteries.,-1,0
1784,1,6,Other than that, the camera is perfect for the beginners.,-1,0
1785,1,0,it stopped working 2 days after i bought it.,-1,1
1785,1,1,fail product.,-1,1
1785,1,2,i don't even know why i bought it.,-1,1
1785,1,3,it broke 2 days after i bought it .,-1,1
1785,1,4,poor quality,-1,1
1786,1,0,didn't work.,-1,1
1786,1,1,I bought this for my kid.,-1,1
1786,1,2,Unfortunately the memory stick doesn't record any pictures.,-1,1
1786,1,3,It was a waste of my money.,-1,1
1786,1,4,Can't tell you how the quality is.,-1,1
1786,1,5,Would not recommend to buy used cameras.,-1,1
1787,1,0,Works For Me.,-1,1
1787,1,1,Had a previous one and used this to replace it after I dropped the old one on a tile floor and broke the lens.,-1,1
1787,1,2,It's very basic, but works quite well for simple picture taking.,-1,1
1788,1,0,I've hated this camera for 4 years ... I just bought a new camera today, and while linking this page to show the old one to some internet friends, I figured I might as well review it ...Man, I am SO glad to be rid of this thing.,-1,1
1788,1,1,I mean, sure, it takes satisfactory pictures, I love the docking station, and it's lasted this long (and is still in decent shape), so I guess my dislikes are just a matter of being picky.,-1,1
1788,1,2,Anyway, I hate the d-pad control on this model.,-1,1
1788,1,3,I thought I hated d-pads in general, but I have realized that it's THIS d-pad that I hate.,-1,1
1788,1,4,And it's about shot after 4 years of use.,-1,1
1788,1,5,I hate that it has a lens cap instead of the lens that automatically shutters itself.,-1,1
1788,1,6,It has terrible hand-feel, it's difficult not to stick your fingers into the shot.,-1,1
1788,1,7,I hate how long it takes between the time you push the button and the time it actually takes the picture.,-1,1
1788,1,8,I hate that you can't do any editing through the camera (I had a sony previously, and you can crop, take pics in sepia, black and white, etc, you can brighten, etc, etc, right ON THE CAMERA).,-1,1
1788,1,9,And I hate that the editing software sucks so bad (am fully aware I could use something else, and I readily admit that I do not know how).,-1,1
1788,1,10,I hate that it takes TERRIBLE close-ups even in close-up mode (I know you love the highly technical terms I use).,-1,1
1788,1,11,I hate that my mother-in-law's cat knocked my sony off the top of her entertainment unit 4 years ago, and THIS is what she replaced it with as my xmas present.I just really hate this camera.It works though.,-1,1
1788,1,12,I guess that's something ...,-1,1
1789,1,0,Good Camera but....... 4gb sd card does not work.,-1,0
1789,1,1,This is my first camera, bought it on Black Friday of 2003 for $299 (included a free 128mb card)I've taken over 6000 pictures with this cam, a majority of them are good.,-1,0
1789,1,2,However, nighttime pictures do not come out very well.Since then, I've bought a 256mb card, upgraded to a 1gb.. Yesterday bought a 4gb Transcend card and it did not work :(Checked the Kodak site, found no firmware upgrade available, stuck with firmware v1.000,-1,0
1790,1,0,kodak dx4530.,-1,1
1790,1,1,I've had this camera for almost two years and am now in the market for a new one.,-1,1
1790,1,2,Although starting about 6 months or so ago, the quality of the pictures started to diminish.,-1,1
1790,1,3,Now everyone time I upload pictures I have to lighten every single picture - which is quite time consuming.,-1,1
1790,1,4,The pictures turn out very dark.,-1,1
1790,1,5,So if you're looking down the road on how the camera will perform after lots of use, this is just what I experienced.,-1,1
1791,1,0,Alright, so this camera is not the worst, but it is not the best.,-1,0
1791,1,1,I bought this about 2 years ago.,-1,0
1791,1,2,This was my first digital camera, and for that purpose it was good because it is pretty much idiot proof.,-1,0
1791,1,3,I have used this camera a lot over the years, and here is how I feel about it now that I have become more familiarized with the digital camera world.a.) this camera is a big large & clunkyb.),-1,0
1791,1,4,aside from the different shooting modes (landscape, motion, etc.), it doesn't have any special features, it's a pretty plain point and shoot camerac.),-1,1
1791,1,5,I feel that the color on the pictures from this camera comes out a bit pale/bland and I don't think that they are as clear as pictures that I have seen from similar cameras.d.) the lens cap!,-1,1
1791,1,6,I hate the lens cap!,-1,1
1791,1,7,I usually just throw my camera into my purse with or without a case, and the lens cap always falls off!,-1,1
1791,1,8,It's not a big deal I guess, but it's something small that has really annoyed me with this camera.,-1,1
1791,1,9,If you want my opinion, unless you're buying a SLR camera or something like that, stay away from the lens caps!,-1,1
1791,1,10,If anything, I think it might be decent for beginners.,-1,1
1792,1,0,Great camera for the price.,-1,0
1792,1,1,partners in December, 2003.,-1,0
1792,1,2,So far I have taken a lot of photographs with it and love it, save one flaw...,-1,1
1792,1,3,If there isn't adequate light, the camera doesn't take the best of photographs.,-1,1
1792,1,4,In dim light, at dawn or dusk, the photograph quality isn't all that great.You can check samples of the photographs taken by me at [...] I usually post photographs taken in all times of the day and you can see yourself and decide since the work is unaltered in any way or form by using photoshop or the like.I guess the best way to decide would be to see the result for yourself and make a qualified decision.,-1,1
1792,1,5,The ease of use of this camera is probably unrivalled.,-1,1
1792,1,6,The original battery lasted me for about two weeks using the preview LCD screen and about 400 photographs.,-1,1
1792,1,7,The camera is acutally smaller than I thought it would be.,-1,1
1792,1,8,I inserted a 256 MB card in it and with it I have taken video clips that are well over 3-4 minutes in length with good sound.As far as value for money is concerned for the amatuer photographer, this is the camera for you.,-1,1
1792,1,9,I took the one star off for the lack of quality of photoraphs in dim light,-1,1
1793,1,0,LAS VEGAS TRIP...,-1,1
1793,1,1,This is our first digital camera.,-1,1
1793,1,2,Well worth the money.,-1,1
1793,1,3,I thought we needed another one for Vegas, boy was I wrong.,-1,1
1793,1,4,The card gives you 192 pics using the best mode 20" by 30" in the good mode it was like 260 or something.,-1,0
1793,1,5,All the modes are great.,-1,0
1793,1,6,The movie mode is awesome and we still had many pics left.,-1,0
1793,1,7,We sat the camera down on the putting green right behind the hole and watch the golf balls go in not to mention the sound was pretty good.,-1,1
1793,1,8,Don't by the docking station.,-1,1
1793,1,9,We are still using the original battery that it comes with.Hope this helps you out.,-1,1
1793,1,10,I was going to buy the Nikon I'm glad I didn't.,-1,1
1793,1,11,The Easyshare software is great as well.,-1,1
1794,1,0,Poor instructions & Dock doesn't work.,-1,1
1794,1,1,Instructions are to little to understand.,-1,1
1794,1,2,Does not tell anything about the Dock which didn't work.,-1,1
1794,1,3,The batteries are $20 a piece.No support.,-1,1
1794,1,4,The pictures would not download to computer.,-1,1
1794,1,5,Kept saying other program was open.,-1,1
1795,1,0,This is a good buy!,-1,0
1795,1,1,We purchased this camera.,-1,0
1795,1,2,Took it out of the box without ever oepning the instructions and used it.,-1,0
1795,1,3,It takes great pictures!,-1,0
1795,1,4,You can figure it out just by looking at the camera.,-1,0
1795,1,5,Very quiet little thing!,-1,0
1795,1,6,Just point and snap is what truely sold us.,-1,0
1796,1,0,I'm happy with it . . .,-1,0
1796,1,1,Got mine right after Thanksgiving and haven't had a lot of time to experiment with it.I took it to a concert, and the photos in the low light didn't turn out very well, but I'm not sure that I've mastered how to use it in low light.,-1,0
1796,1,2,"Regular" photos turn out great.,-1,0
1796,1,3,I don't care for the software, but I think it's because I'm used to the one that came with my WINDOWS package.I got the docking station and love the convenience of uploading without a cable.,-1,1
1797,1,0,camera is crap in low light.,-1,1
1797,1,1,won't focus unless you are in bright sunlight, jpeg compression is bad, can see the artifacts in an 8x10 that used highest quality mode.,-1,1
1797,1,2,Took it back the next day.,-1,1
1798,1,0,New to Digital.,-1,0
1798,1,1,First off, I am an amateur photographer and use a Nikon SLR for most of my "serious" pictures.,-1,0
1798,1,2,But I really wanted a camera for every day use.,-1,0
1798,1,3,One that fits in my purse, but wasn't so small that my husband couldn't use it too.,-1,0
1798,1,4,After a lot of research, I decided digital was the way to go and bought the Kodak DX4530.I love the camera.,-1,0
1798,1,5,My husband actually enjoys taking pictures now too.,-1,0
1798,1,6,The picture quality is great.,-1,0
1798,1,7,The night setting is awesome and has just the right amount of flash to take clear pictures in low light.,-1,0
1798,1,8,The LCD screen is crystal clear in good lighting, but harder to see in low light, only when framing your picture though.,-1,0
1798,1,9,Once the shot is taken, it appears in true form on the LCD.,-1,1
1798,1,10,It is also fast - so you don't miss those important shots and I haven't had any problems with blurry shots.The only things I don't like about the camera are probably the features Kodak scrimped on in order to offer the DX4530 at such a great price.,-1,1
1798,1,11,1) The lens cap falls off on it's own in the camera bag.,-1,1
1798,1,12,2) The lens is a Kodak, not the higher quality lens protected by a shutter found on some of KPdak's pricier cameras.,-1,1
1798,1,13,3) This is no fault of Kodak, but with 5 MP, the pictures take up a lot of memory, on the camera and on the memory card, so you definitely want to buy a memory card, maybe a few.,-1,1
1798,1,14,But I am sure those are the sacrifices made to get a 5 MP at or below $300.,-1,1
1799,1,0,Close ups are questionable.,-1,1
1799,1,1,Fair camera for the price.,-1,1
1799,1,2,I have found out that a close up of something that has text is blurry.,-1,1
1799,1,3,I have a college with a similiar Cannon product.,-1,1
1799,1,4,When I compare the pictures side to side the Cannon wins out.,-1,1
1799,1,5,I have had a brand new out of the box Kodak 4 MP camera that I gave to a relative.,-1,1
1799,1,6,After 15-17 pictures it kept saying the battery was dead.,-1,1
1799,1,7,With every NEW battery replacement it kept saying the same thing.,-1,1
1799,1,8,My faith in Kodak products is going down hill,-1,1
1800,1,0,I purchased this camera after my Olympus 1.2 Megapixel died after 5 years of hard use.,-1,1
1800,1,1,If I could revive my Olympus, I would in a heartbeat.,-1,1
1800,1,2,I am so very Disgusted with this Kodak camera.,-1,1
1800,1,3,It is impossible to get a picture that doesn't look dark indoors.,-1,1
1800,1,4,I sell items on ebay and the pictures I attempted to take of anything red came out very blurry.,-1,1
1800,1,5,I read the entire manual and tried every combination of settings to try to improve the picture quality.,-1,1
1800,1,6,The night vision also produces extremely blurry images.,-1,1
1800,1,7,It is easy to use, and the software is easy, I liked the camera dock, but if you want good quality pictures, don't go with this camera.,-1,1
1800,1,8,I am taking it back and spending the extra money on the Olympus, my first one never failed me.,-1,1
1801,1,0,OK pictures terrible software.,-1,1
1801,1,1,Camera is small, light and easy to handle.,-1,0
1801,1,2,It takes ok pictures, nothing great but acceptable.,-1,0
1801,1,3,The kodak software is awful.,-1,1
1801,1,4,Half the time it works and half the time I have to delete the program and reinstall.,-1,1
1801,1,5,Maybe I am spoiled by my Sony camcorder that also takes still pictures where the camera and software work very well.,-1,1
1801,1,6,Have had the kodak since Oct 2003 and find it only marginally satisfactory.,-1,1
1802,1,0,I'd never buy another Kodak camera!,-1,0
1802,1,1,I'd never buy another Kodak camera!I bought a Kodak digital camera and it has been fine.,-1,0
1802,1,2,However, knowing what I know now I would never buy another Kodak camera.,-1,0
1802,1,3,I dropped the camera, and a little plastic piece broke off which keeps the battery pack in the camera.,-1,0
1802,1,4,Not a big deal.,-1,1
1802,1,5,But NOONE repairs Kodak cameras.,-1,1
1802,1,6,Instead you HAVE to send it into their corporate repair center and they instead sell you on trading it in for a refurbished camera.,-1,1
1802,1,7,So, I can send this one in and for $250 get a new refurbished camera.,-1,1
1802,1,8,But it only sells for $50 more on amazon.com,-1,1
1802,1,9,I'd never buy a camera which I cant get repaired locally.,-1,1
1803,1,0,I don't think I can honestly give this camera 1 star.,-1,1
1803,1,1,I had the camera for a month, worked great, brought it on a vacation and quit working, the screen went black, all my pictures were black (and the lens cap was off!).,-1,1
1803,1,2,The flash went off every time taking a picture, but turned completely black.,-1,1
1803,1,3,The quick view was completely black.,-1,1
1803,1,4,I pushed a few buttons and it worked again; the next day it failed me once again.,-1,1
1803,1,5,I went to a Kodak shop which offered little help, I called Kodak directly to speak with a technician for an hour plus and yet my camera continued to not work on my third of ten days on vacation.,-1,1
1803,1,6,I showed the camera to a family member, which made it work like it was brand new.,-1,1
1803,1,7,Last Friday, I was taking pictures and it went black once again.,-1,1
1803,1,8,I brought it to the store I purchased it from and they could not figure it out and I would suggest to anyone not to purchase this product.,-1,0
1803,1,9,It is not fun to know you are on vacation and cannot take any pictures because your camera quit working.,-1,0
1803,1,10,I will stick to film for awhile now.,-1,0
1804,1,0,I gave this camera all the time and kept giving the befit of doubt to it, that may be I am not taking the pics properly and the fact that it is a kodak, and who would make a better camera than kodak.I still have it and looks like that I am going to return it, the pics are excellent on sunny days and also indoor pics are very good too especially if the subject is close.,-1,1
1804,1,1,But the evening pics are just disgusting, and dont even talk about the night pics, flash is useless if the subject is more than 15 feet away.My biggest problem is that this camera gives very very blurry pics if it is shaken even very slightly duing the pic.,-1,1
1804,1,2,Sometimes it is blurry, and sometimes it is not.Easy of usability:  Great.Internal memory:  Great (32MB).Pixels 5MB:  Great.Price:  Great.But it cannot take great pics, why bother with all the other things.,-1,1
1805,1,0,love the camera.,-1,0
1805,1,1,I found the camera so easy to use.,-1,0
1805,1,2,I would not have been familar with digital cameras until we purchased this kodak camera.,-1,0
1805,1,3,everything with it is so simple.,-1,0
1805,1,4,so easy to use.,-1,0
1806,1,0,Better deal at Walmart.,-1,0
1806,1,1,This one is available for under $300 at your local walmart.,-1,0
1806,1,2,No extra memory though.,-1,0
1807,1,0,Water affects camera.,-1,1
1807,1,1,I have 10+ of these cameras installed outside our house, mostly attached under the soffit in the corners of the exterior.,-1,1
1807,1,2,But there is one area (under our deck) which has caused (2) cameras to completely die.,-1,1
1807,1,3,As many know about this Samsung system, I have to get another replacement as they are proprietary, but will take the necessary precautions to insulate against any water touching the connection and camera itself.,-1,1
1807,1,4,Besides this, the camera works well at night and the audio sounds perfect as well.,-1,1
1808,1,0,Audio "chugging" Bought two 1006Rs.,-1,1
1808,1,1,First camera has awful "chugging" sound over audio channel making the camera unusable.,-1,1
1808,1,2,Picture OK.Second 1006R using same cable had softer "chugging" sound ...could make out some sounds but conversation distorted.I tried switching cables and ports but second 1006R failed completely.,-1,1
1808,1,3,I spent time trying to identify a configuration or cable problem without success.,-1,1
1808,1,4,Two for two bad products are rare so I assumed I had something amiss configuration or cable wise but was unable to find or resolve any other issues.Update to 1006R review...got second camera to have working audio.,-1,1
1808,1,5,I didn't do anything.,-1,1
1808,1,6,Chugging sound now a steading fan noise which could be a computer fan.,-1,1
1808,1,7,I will have to go out to the site (130 miles) and see if I placed the camera too close to a fan.,-1,1
1808,1,8,With a steady background fan noise the audio is understandable,-1,1
1809,1,0,Less than a year of installation - Water enters camera.,-1,1
1809,1,1,I ordered this producted on 10/16/11 and I didnt get a chance to install the product till summer of 2012.,-1,1
1809,1,2,It has been less than a year of installation and the camera has water inside the lens.,-1,1
1809,1,3,I called up the manufacture and it covers only 1 year of warranty.,-1,1
1809,1,4,The quality is cheap and will not reccomend to friends to family.,-1,0
1810,1,0,Best proSumer Nikon DSLR to date.,-1,1
1810,1,1,I owned the D600 and replaced it with this D610.I had the spots on the D600 and was hopeful this model corrected that issue.,-1,1
1810,1,2,More on this later.Pros:Improved and noticeably better White Balance over the D600.,-1,1
1810,1,3,My in-door "people" pictures now look as good as my friends photos who use Canon 5D or 6D DSLRs.,-1,0
1810,1,4,This is a great new feature.Good speed for multiple shoots--not Nikon D4s fast, but good enough for everyday things or the occasion soccer match.Scene mode allows you to take great sunset pics when you don't have time to adjust the camera.,-1,0
1810,1,5,I don't use the rest of those "scene" settings so I can't comment on how good or bad they are, but most cameras have a pretty good set of these I would expect this one to also support them.Full-frame sensor (great depth of field shots using my 50mm lens).Built-in flash is great (my Canon friends are jealous) for most short barrow lenses.,-1,0
1810,1,6,Use an external flash for longer lenses.Seeming better LCD color than the D600/D800, but remember that image is not the image recorded, just what is displayed on the camera's LCD so (for example) you could set the LCD to B/W in theory, if you preferred.AE-L/AF-L button can be reprogrammed to AF-ON if you're like me and like to focus and then shoot.Good photo buffer size.,-1,1
1810,1,7,I can shoot 12 images in both Raw+JPEG before it starts buffering.,-1,1
1810,1,8,Then get another 3 off in only a second or two.,-1,1
1810,1,9,The recording-to-card speed is depended on the SD cards you're using.Cons:Slow Expeed 3 CPU.,-1,1
1810,1,10,The Nikon Expeed 4 is out in the new DX format camers, this one could have used it as well.,-1,1
1810,1,11,I'm guessing Expeed 4 will be in all new models this year, so if they once again update the D610 to D620 it will probably include Expeed 4 which would help (slow to start up the Menus).Would really like the AF-ON to work in conjunction with the shutter release.,-1,1
1810,1,12,Here's what I mean: I would like the camera to use AF-ON when I press AF-ON.,-1,1
1810,1,13,When I do not press AF-ON, I would like the shutter to work normally; meaning focus, then shoot.,-1,1
1810,1,14,Today I have to toggle between these two modes.,-1,1
1810,1,15,Perhaps a dedicated AF-ON button would provide this kind of feature?Recommendations:If you want an FX camera, get a D610 or if you're a megapixel freak, consider the D800/D800e.,-1,0
1810,1,16,If you can wait "5 minutes" there may be an updated D800 coming out in 2014 that would probably use the Expeed 4 chip; that might be cool.,-1,1
1810,1,17,While there could potentially be a D620 in 2014, I would say if you need a camera buy this one.,-1,1
1810,1,18,If you don't then wait a few months and see what happens.Dust Spots: [EDIT: I forgot to include this in the original post] All DSLR cameras have spots on them.,-1,1
1810,1,19,It is just that most people moving from the compact "PowerShot" or "CoolPix" to DSLR FX notice the spots for the first time.,-1,1
1810,1,20,The D600 had a shutter or mechanism defect that caused particles of something (some say oil, some say dust, some say grease) to appear in photos at F8 to F22.,-1,1
1810,1,21,Most notably on bluesky or snow landscape shots.,-1,1
1810,1,22,I too had this issue, a friend of mine also owns a D600 and he did not experience that issue.The D610 has dust on it, already.,-1,1
1810,1,23,Do I notice it at less than F8? No.,-1,1
1810,1,24,In fact it is what I would term "normal".,-1,1
1810,1,25,Meaning it is the same as you'd expect to see on the D800, D4, Canon 5D, 6D and all the DX format cameras that have a shutter.,-1,1
1810,1,26,D610 is probably a bit better and certainly no worse than the "cleanest" out there.,-1,1
1810,1,27,A few puffs of air with the mirror locked up and the spots are gone.[Update:,-1,1
1810,1,28,Dust spots are returning after more and more photos, Nikon support notified me to send it in to someone specific rather than the general support address.,-1,1
1810,1,29,"We've not seen this in this model before." said the support supervisor.,-1,1
1810,1,30,So I'm sending it in.,-1,1
1810,1,31,Fortunately I do not think this is oil or whatever was on the D600, it appears to be only dirty/dust particles probably from metal on metal during shutter release.,-1,1
1811,1,0,Camera is great -- Amazon was not that great.,-1,1
1811,1,1,This camera is great, captures a lot of detail, a couple of notches above the D7000 that I had.However, I was quite disappointed by Amazon.,-1,1
1811,1,2,They initially shipped (as I fortunately discovered later) a used camera.,-1,1
1811,1,3,I was a bit suspicious as the camera came with the language, date, and time zone already preset.,-1,1
1811,1,4,I later chanced to check the shutter count using Exif data on the image, and found the camera already had 17,400 shutter clicks!!  Very disappointing considering the cost of the camera/lens was almost $3,000.Buyer beware.,-1,1
1812,1,0,An amazing camera with a couple of minor irritants....,-1,1
1812,1,1,This camera has a lot of reasons to love....1) Small size - cannot see a marked difference in size over the D90 despite the full frame sensor2) Low light performance - incredible low light performance - I have been able to capture portrait images with minimal noise in tough light conditions...much better than my D903) Depth of field - I am getting much better depth of field with this camera compared to the D90 (no slouch) with the same lenses4) Ability to crop due to the larger size images - the size makes it easy to crop and still get decent size images for larger prints5) Speed of focus - this camera focuses very fast and as a result I find myself capturing images quicker than ever before6) Size of viewfinder - Much easier as you can see the entire image and feels larger than my D907) More natural feel to images - I find the images to have more range and see a lot more tones in similar light8) Ability to zoom in "Live View" with a manual focus lens to get sharper focus (makes the manual focus lenses much more valuable)9) Two SD card slots - very convenientConcerns I have:1) The focus points are bunched up.,-1,1
1812,1,2,If you want to focus on objects that are not within that central region, you have to use another approach (Hold the AF/AE and then recompose).,-1,1
1812,1,3,This has been the case for me a few times....2) The dual dials with locks are a pain to use (not easy to rotate)Still have to figure out a few things -1) Setting up U1 & U2 - get to my settings for most common types of photography quickly2) In-camera HDR - looks very promising3) AF fine-tuningSo far the pictures have turned out very well ...one thing I struggled with is using AF-A.,-1,1
1812,1,4,Have had to resort to single-point AF mode to get better focus on my subject (especially with landscapes, it is easy to have your subject out of focus in AF-A mode).I chose this over the D7100 (it is about half the price) because I had a few FX lenses that I really liked and wanted to take advantage of.,-1,1
1812,1,5,Can't go wrong with either...I tried the D7100 out and loved it as well.,-1,1
1813,1,0,Loved the Camera, wish the diopter would work.,-1,0
1813,1,1,A LOT of research lead me to this camera, I chose this over the D800 to get the two user modes.,-1,0
1813,1,2,I'm picking up photography after 30 years away, and I wanted a good FX format.,-1,0
1813,1,3,The first camera came, and I could not get the viewfinder to come in focus.,-1,0
1813,1,4,I thought I just didn't know how to work the viewfinder - and I shot 300 frames before I figured out the diopter didn't work.So, I returned it (AMZN did a good job here, though I had to do the shipping myself).,-1,0
1813,1,5,Second camera shows up the next day.,-1,0
1813,1,6,First thing I did was unbox it, power it on with a lens, and you guessed right - same problem.,-1,1
1813,1,7,It went right back in the box - I didn't shoot a single frame - and I'll return it when AMZN and I work out the how (the first camera hasn't even made it back to them yet).But what prompts my review here, is that the online research indicates this is a very, very common problem, which includes the D800.,-1,1
1813,1,8,My measure of "common problem" was finding more than five other instances like mine where I was shipped two consecutive cameras with the same problem.,-1,1
1813,1,9,That's either manufacturing problems or it's poorly engineered and gets broken in shipping.You can find out what a working diopter looks like by searching on YouTube for "Nikon D610 Diopter".,-1,1
1813,1,10,I should have shot some video of what a broken version looks like, since I've had two of them, but suffice to say that on the first camera - I didn't even know there was a status line at the bottom of the viewfinder with the speed/fstop etc.This WAS the right camera for me - if the viewfinder worked, I'd recommend it with five stars.,-1,1
1813,1,11,But it doesn't.,-1,1
1813,1,12,The most upsetting thing, is the loss of my time to figure this all out.,-1,1
1813,1,13,Without Nikon admitting there is a problem - I'm off the Nikon gear.,-1,1
1813,1,14,And it was the perfect Camera for me.,-1,1
1814,1,0,Warning: This is a review of the actual camera!,-1,1
1814,1,1,This will not be a long review, but just enough to get some thoughts out there.,-1,1
1814,1,2,First of all, I am not a very experienced photographer, but through the years, I have owned a couple of nice DSLR's, and many point and shoot models.,-1,1
1814,1,3,A little over a year ago I purchased a D600.,-1,1
1814,1,4,The picture quality was easily the best I have ever seen, and even with my limited skill set, I was getting many pro level photos out of it.,-1,1
1814,1,5,My mother in law, who is a very advanced photographer was starting to use some of my shots for her desktop wallpaper, etc.,-1,1
1814,1,6,After about 1500 clicks, I started to notice the specks on certain photos.,-1,1
1814,1,7,After doing some research, I learned about the oil splatter issue, and returned the camera to Nikon for repair.,-1,1
1814,1,8,They kept it for over a month due to a parts delay.,-1,1
1814,1,9,Upon receiving the camera back from Nikon, it immediately had the oil issue again.,-1,1
1814,1,10,First frame out of the box.,-1,1
1814,1,11,I don't even think they did anything to my camera except possibly clean the sensor.,-1,1
1814,1,12,I returned the camera once again, and this time the turn around was only about a week and a half.,-1,1
1814,1,13,Again, spots on the sensor.,-1,1
1814,1,14,So, I sold the camera to a friend of mine who is adept at sensor cleaning, and didn't seem to think it was that big of a deal.,-1,1
1814,1,15,Next thing I know, the D610 is announced, and the word is that the shutter oil issue has been addressed.,-1,1
1814,1,16,I decided to give Nikon one last try because I already had Nikon FX lenses, and the  PQ with the D600 was so outstanding, but promised myself that this would be the last chance they get due to cost.,-1,1
1814,1,17,Well, I have had the camera since launch day, and I'm happy to say that it has been superb!,-1,1
1814,1,18,So far, so good!,-1,1
1814,1,19,Now I can focus on learning more about how to be a better photographer, than spending my time cleaning up my photos in Lightroom.,-1,1
1814,1,20,I feel burned by Nikon for sure, but the camera is a winner.,-1,1
1814,1,21,The experience was not.,-1,1
1815,1,0,theoretical good features-the worst customer service ever.,-1,1
1815,1,1,The camera D610 was bought in amazon.com in February, it was okay but with 1200 shoots, it started to have some spots in the images, always in the same area, and ruining my pics from Greek Islands.People said it is dirtiness in the sensor, the sensor was checked by nikkon seller and it's okay, it is clean.,-1,1
1815,1,2,Then I contacted customer service from USA, they asked me for some files, they recommend me to send the camera, in fact they just give me a link with lot of requirements to send the camera, I asked the Spanish nikkon service if they could have a look, as I am living in Spain.,-1,1
1815,1,3,The delivery expenses are not cover by Nikkon,  the delivery cost is 200 euros.,-1,1
1815,1,4,and maybe the issue could be not cover by the warranty.,-1,1
1815,1,5,Meanwhile Nikon just replies with confusing mails.It is unbelievable for me, that a brand as Nikon have this kind of warranties and customer services.,-1,1
1815,1,6,Some people told me that they face many problems with Nikon D600, and I didm't believe them it was a mistake to buy this camera, The features are nice, camera is nice but when you have a problem, you are lost!,-1,1
1815,1,7,In my case the only solution they offer me is spending 200 euros and then waiting for the camera for probably more than 2 months.Spending $2000 and receiving this customer service....no comments.Nikon D610 24.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera with 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G,-1,1
1815,1,8,ED VR AF-S Nikkor Lens,-1,1
1816,1,0,Buy it from B&H; instead.,-1,1
1816,1,1,Same price plus free battery and memory card.,-1,1
1816,1,2,I'm a longtime Amazon customer but they screwed up on this one.,-1,1
1816,1,3,I purchased a new camera and what they sent me was a used one with 769 shutter clicks!,-1,1
1816,1,4,I sent it back and ordered it from B&H; Photo.,-1,1
1816,1,5,Same price as Amazon but they also throw in-free spare battery-free Ruggard camera bag-free 16 GB memory cardI don't have any stake in B&H; and I am not benefiting from sending people there, but I recognize superior service and wanted to pass this along.,-1,1
1817,1,0,Awesome images.,-1,0
1817,1,1,I had D300 for five years, just bought D610 this month.,-1,1
1817,1,2,Image quality appear to be twice better than D300.,-1,1
1817,1,3,I'm happy to move to FX.,-1,1
1817,1,4,Maybe at this point Nikon cares more about image quality than WIFI.,-1,1
1817,1,5,I bought Nikon 1.8 and 2.8 lens.,-1,1
1817,1,6,Aperture mode doesn't appear consistent in exposure level from wide opening to smaller apertures.,-1,1
1817,1,7,The image taken at wide open appears to be always slightly darker than the rest.,-1,1
1817,1,8,It's only slightly but no big deal.,-1,1
1817,1,9,It can be fixable by adjusting shutter speed or ISO.,-1,1
1817,1,10,I tested aperture mode range using D300 and D7100 and it appears to produce the same results so I would guess it's the general Nikon camera itself.,-1,1
1817,1,11,Nikon probably thinks it's no big deal fixing this little problem that no one has complained about or notice.,-1,1
1817,1,12,In White Balance, it has incandescent and no tungsten like Canon camera has.,-1,1
1817,1,13,It appears slightly yellow, not white enough, but will try to test it some more.,-1,1
1817,1,14,I would recommend the camera for excellent image quality but warn it has no built-in WIFI.,-1,0
1817,1,15,Not many people are happy with WU-1B.,-1,0
1818,1,0,Great camera.,-1,0
1818,1,1,I shoot with Nikon D3, D3s, D800e and I needed another full frame camera for portraits and bridal shots with a little more resolution than my D3 series cameras and the image quality is great with the D610.,-1,0
1818,1,2,My only gripe about the camera is the maximum shutter of 1/4000 of a second.,-1,0
1818,1,3,I love to shoot fast primes wide open in bright sunlight and 1/4000 of a second is not fast enough.,-1,0
1818,1,4,Great studio camera.,-1,0
1819,1,0,Great Camera!,-1,0
1819,1,1,I have only had this camera for about a week so I can't speak for longevity.,-1,0
1819,1,2,This camera offers some great features and great picture quality!,-1,0
1819,1,3,So far I have no complaints and love it!,-1,0
1819,1,4,I understand the issues with the D600 and also understand that this is "basically" the same camera.,-1,0
1820,1,0,Mixed feelings.,-1,0
1820,1,1,***Be wary!! Some models come with a broken diopter control!,-1,0
1820,1,2,I got one***Compared to the D700:Pros:-Better in low light.-Nice,-1,0
1820,1,3,capability.Cons:-D700's performance is a lot better (faster FPS w/MB-D10 and reacts faster)-Not as sturdy.,-1,0
1820,1,4,Feels like a D200.-SD,-1,0
1820,1,5,Cards and controls need getting used to.*I,-1,0
1820,1,6,bought this camera mainly for non-sports usage.,-1,0
1820,1,7,I tried it on a couple of soccer games and noticed that on occasional sequence shots, the first frame will be about a third of a stop darker than the following frames.,-1,1
1820,1,8,Happened multiple times.,-1,1
1820,1,9,Might stick with not shooting fast action sports with it because it doesn't seem to have that problem otherwise.Update - 3/20:-Upset the price dropped $100 after I bought it.-After,-1,1
1820,1,10,running over 10k photos through the camera, I still like the file size, but I can't trust the camera to do the job with it's auto-focus on objects that are moving around a lot.,-1,1
1820,1,11,You would think that after a seven-plus year difference between it and the D700, the auto focus technology would be a lot better.,-1,1
1820,1,12,Auto WB is actually pretty good.,-1,1
1820,1,13,Although, the yellowish/green cast of the LCD on the back would tell you different.,-1,1
1821,1,0,Wonderful Camera, but spots on sensor.,-1,0
1821,1,1,I really, really, liked this camera and loved the photos.,-1,0
1821,1,2,I had the D600, but due to sensor issues, Nikon refunded my money for the D600.,-1,1
1821,1,3,When the D610 came out, I waited and it seemed like the sensor problem was resolved, so I bought it.,-1,1
1821,1,4,Very happy with it, had the automatic sensor cleaner on at both start up and shut down, and it looked like the pictures were clear.,-1,1
1821,1,5,I went on a two week vacation the day after getting the camera, NEVER changed the lens (so doubtful much dust would have gotten in via lens changing), and was pretty happy.,-1,1
1821,1,6,Then, I got home where I was able to download my pictures onto my home computer w/ 21" monitor and start doing some conversions to B&W;, that's when I saw it - a multitude of sensor spots on the image.,-1,1
1821,1,7,Sensor clean and blowing w/ a Giotto blower did no good.,-1,1
1821,1,8,So I packed up the camera and returned it.,-1,1
1821,1,9,I think that the spots probably would have disappeared w/ a wet cleaning, but here's the catch - Nikon requires that only a certified Nikon facility clean the camera, or warranty is voided.,-1,1
1821,1,10,And I just didn't want to get on the carousel of sending my camera to California every time I had sensor spots that could not be removed by regular means.,-1,1
1821,1,11,I clean my own Nikon D70s with a swab with no issues, and if Nikon didn't have warnings to consumers about the D610 needing to be returned to Nikon for cleaning to keep the warranty, I'd probably have cleaned it and kept the camera, But better to send it back while I can still get a refund.As for the 28-300 lens - loved it.Shoulder bag - great, and worked wonderfully on my road trip to carry my camera, computer, power cords, etc.,-1,1
1822,1,0,Dust spot issue continues.,-1,1
1822,1,1,I bought the 600 and sent it back 4 times for repair and replacement.,-1,1
1822,1,2,Ultimately I demanded and Nikon agreed to give me my money back.,-1,1
1822,1,3,I decided being an early adopter was not a good strategy.,-1,1
1822,1,4,So when the 610 came out I waited several months to see if this camera repaired the dust/spot issue.,-1,1
1822,1,5,I really didn't want all the megapixels of the 800.,-1,1
1822,1,6,The 600/610 seemed to hit a sweet spot in affordability and megapixels.,-1,1
1822,1,7,I had this camera a few weeks and I began noticing dust through out the sensor.,-1,1
1822,1,8,I decided it must be the lens.,-1,1
1822,1,9,So I cleaned three lenses thoroughly and tried each--50 mm, 28 to 300 and 14 to 24.,-1,1
1822,1,10,Each image taken, no matter the lens showed an increasing accumulation of dust in the upper left hand corner.,-1,1
1822,1,11,Ground hog day all over again.,-1,1
1822,1,12,I sent it back and bought the 800e and so far I am a happy camper but have a late/hate relationship with Nikon.,-1,1
1823,1,0,FX not really worth the added cost.,-1,1
1823,1,1,Have been using DX Nikons since the D70, and was ready to be blown away by the difference in FX with the 610, but quite the opposite was the case.,-1,1
1823,1,2,Aside from the added pixels per image and a slightly more spacious viewfinder, I could not find an additional $800-900-worth of value over the D7000 I now own.,-1,1
1823,1,3,Amazingly, the 610, together with a 70-300 VR FX zoom, created a seriously vignetted image on a clear, sunny day in one of my test runs, something I never get with a DX body.,-1,1
1823,1,4,Internal camera controls may have been able to deal with that flaw, but why should I even have to worry about it?,-1,1
1823,1,5,Never had to with film cameras... Anyway, my curiosity with respect to FX has been completely satisfied and I won't have to spend any more in the future to try it again.,-1,1
1823,1,6,However, kudos to Amazon for allowing me to return it and even refunding shipping for both directions!,-1,1
1823,1,7,Now that's a big deal!,-1,1
1824,1,0,Auto-focus doesn't work ..and the dust saga continues.,-1,1
1824,1,1,Where's the quality control NIKON?,-1,1
1824,1,2,I have been a D5000 user for the last 4 years.,-1,1
1824,1,3,Decided to upgrade recently and after researching the D7100, the D610 (and it's predecessor the D600) as well as the D800, I settled on the D610.,-1,1
1824,1,4,The camera arrived about 10 days before I was leaving on a trip and during those 10 days I played around with the settings / controls and shot some pictures in and around the house.,-1,1
1824,1,5,Everything seemed to be fine.,-1,1
1824,1,6,The first time I tried to use it on the trip the shutter would not release.,-1,1
1824,1,7,Luckily I was carrying my backup body and after some experimentation with different lenses I quickly realized that the issue was that the auto-focus mechanism in the camera had stopped working.,-1,1
1824,1,8,After taking a few shots under manual focus at F/22 I also noticed 5-6 fairly large dust/oil spots on images with blue skies.I just got back from the trip and Amazon was extremely helpful in setting up the return / exchange so the camera is going back today (luckily it's within 30 days of delivery!).,-1,1
1824,1,9,I will request a replacement for now hoping the replacement will not be another lemon.,-1,1
1824,1,10,Will seriously consider selling all my Nikon gear and switching to Canon if that happens - which is a shame because I do believe that Nikon makes a great product, when it works.,-1,1
1825,1,0,D610 with oil spots out of the box.,-1,1
1825,1,1,Just received a new D610.,-1,1
1825,1,2,Same oil spot issue left upper quadrant as with my previous D600.,-1,1
1825,1,3,Started out with 3 spots on 5th shot, after 200 clicks now 10-15spots.,-1,1
1825,1,4,You see these spots best when taking pictures of a deep blue sky with higher aperture F13,  70-300 lens zoomed out.,-1,1
1825,1,5,Doesn't look like Nikon has fixed the sensor/oil issue with this camera.,-1,1
1825,1,6,Has anyone had this issue with their D610?,-1,1
1826,1,0,Great camera - lousy Nikon customer loyalty practices.,-1,1
1826,1,1,I purchased this camera to get into the FX format.,-1,1
1826,1,2,My current camera is the D7000 (that I love too).,-1,1
1826,1,3,My previous camera was the Nikon D80.,-1,1
1826,1,4,Before that I owned various Nikon film cameras, that I no longer use.I sympathize with those that purchased the D600, and I am just as pissed off about Nikon's lack of customer loyalty by not providing a remedy for the D600 fiasco.,-1,1
1826,1,5,My recommendation to those that still have the Nikon warranty and their state laws allow it, to claim 'lemon' law for the camera after the 3 sensor cleaning attempts from the Nikon customer service and the re-occurrence of the spot issue after the cleaning has been performed.I tested my D610 for the sensor spots by shooting at F22 as soon as it came out of the box.,-1,1
1826,1,6,My camera does NOT have the issue.,-1,1
1826,1,7,The sensor appears to be squeaky clean - first out of the box, and then after the many test shots.I was considering the Canon 5D Mark III because of the D600 fiasco.,-1,1
1826,1,8,Since I am a long-time (decades) Nikon camera user, I have a collection of lenses and that tipped the scale for me towards the Nkon D610 given the multiple reviews that informed me that this camera does not seem to suffer from the sensor spots issues.,-1,1
1826,1,9,I also considered the Sony A7 (and A7R), as well as the Nikon D800.,-1,1
1826,1,10,Sony was ruled out for the same reason as the Canon.,-1,1
1826,1,11,Although, I was intrigued by the smaller form factor in a full frame package.,-1,1
1826,1,12,However, the current lack of body-specific lenses for the A7 was another reason I wound up eliminating the Sony.,-1,1
1826,1,13,Since the lenses that fit the body currently were not designed to be physically smaller to match the body size.,-1,1
1826,1,14,The D800 was too much camera for my needs and was too slow for my most frequent use cases - sports/action photograhy.,-1,1
1826,1,15,I did not want to deal with the size of the files coming from the D800 (I typically shoot RAW to be able to post-process).,-1,1
1826,1,16,I also considered getting the D7100.,-1,1
1826,1,17,However great the D7100 features are, that camera is not significantly different from the D7000 for my needs, tipping the scale towards the D610 (since I wanted a full frame camera in the first place).The D610, for me, represents the best value for my purposes.,-1,1
1826,1,18,Part of me wishes that I could have the budget to invest into the Canon lens market and purchased the 5D M3 just to keep solidarity with the D600 customers who have been treated very unfairly by Nikon.,-1,1
1826,1,19,Unfortunately, at this time I can not.,-1,1
1826,1,20,Given the opportunity in the future, I will likely move away from Nikon.,-1,1
1826,1,21,For that reason, I took away one star from an otherwise great camera.,-1,1
1827,1,0,My Take (coming from a Sony) This is an initial review of this kit - be mindful this was after one day (7hrs) of making it a point to go out and take practice shots and to better familiarize myself with Nikon.,-1,1
1827,1,1,Bear in mind that others that are coming from a Sony might find this more helpful or anyone who has never used a Nikon.I am coming from 7yrs of using Sony Alpha (700 & 77)and the reason I changed was the noise performance on Sony's is dreadful.Now,,-1,1
1827,1,2,I can see the weight being an issue from hand-holding this all day (same I used to do with the Sony).,-1,1
1827,1,3,The grip in comparison is smaller so there isnt the same comfort level when walking or moving about.,-1,1
1827,1,4,I did this throughout the day but I was more aware of my grip then normal.There are a ton of features/options on this camera so that takes some time to understand them and find the right mix.,-1,1
1827,1,5,I was a big fan of the in camera enhancement on the Sony for vividness but have yet to dial that in on the Nikon.At the moment I am not a fan of the selection method for such things as ISO, WB & Metering - the need to perform this with dual buttons is cumbersome and tedious.I can also say from when the moment that you take a picture, it saves to the memory card and is ready for viewing - the Nikon is much slower then the Sony.All in all I am neutral at the moment on this purchase - in the back of my mind I am wondering if the Canon 6D would have been a better choice.,-1,1
1827,1,6,Time will tellPS - I did forget to mention that it appears as if I already might have spots on the sensor...I am not as forgiving on products as the cost increase so at the $3K range - not pleased.**UPDATE,-1,1
1827,1,7,4/6/14**Ok, I am uploading two pictures from a series of tests that now unfortunately make my decision to send this product back.,-1,1
1827,1,8,Plane and simple - when a consumer makes a purchase in any dollar range let alone the $3K mark I expect a level of quality and even more so on a model that should have had corrections for certain defects.,-1,0
1828,1,0,Still the oil/dust issue.,-1,1
1828,1,1,I had a D90 for 6 years, never cleaned it and never had dust problems with the sensor filter.,-1,1
1828,1,2,Now I bought the Nikon D610 and since I received it, there is dust or oil spots in the sensor.,-1,1
1828,1,3,Nikon Support just told me to cleaned it as it says in the manual but obviously the 2 spots are still in all my pictures!!!,-1,1
1828,1,4,I regret not changing to Canon!!,-1,1
1829,1,0,Blurry Viewfinders in 2 D610's.,-1,1
1829,1,1,I ordered a D610 and received it on Jan 26th.,-1,1
1829,1,2,Charged up the battery and tried to use it.,-1,1
1829,1,3,Viewfinder was very blurry, could not be resolved by using the diopler adjustment.,-1,1
1829,1,4,Called Amazon and they sent me another one ASAP.,-1,1
1829,1,5,I was to have UPS pick up the package at my home.,-1,1
1829,1,6,I picked up the second one at the UPS office on Jan 28th.,-1,1
1829,1,7,Again camera has a blurry viewfinder.,-1,1
1829,1,8,Spoke to several people at Nikon Service.,-1,1
1829,1,9,Nothing they had me try worked.,-1,1
1829,1,10,They wanted me to send it in, to them, for repair.,-1,1
1829,1,11,I did not want to wait a couple of months for this.,-1,1
1829,1,12,Contacted Amazon to return the 2nd one, tried to change to get a D800. 2 strikes and the 610 was out.,-1,1
1829,1,13,Amazon said I had to return the 2nd camera at my expense, It has been sent back costing me over $47.,-1,1
1829,1,14,I lost my home to a fire on Dec 11th, need a camera to get back to doing some work, until insurance replaces my lost equipment.,-1,1
1829,1,15,I have never had this much problem in 33 yrs of Nikon camera usage.,-1,1
1830,1,0,I am a professional photographer and have always used Nikon until now.,-1,1
1830,1,1,There was well documented issues with the D600 and this was the supposed fix, but oil spots are still present on the D610.,-1,1
1830,1,2,I purchased 2 different D610s and straight out of the box a few hundred shutter clicks and the oil begins to build up.,-1,1
1830,1,3,Save yourself time and headache and purchase Canon 6d .,-1,1
1831,1,0,Good camera except that it shares the same fatal flaw as the D600.,-1,1
1831,1,1,Lots of dirt and oil spots...AGAIN.,-1,1
1831,1,2,As the owner of a D200, D90 and D7000, I have had more than a little bit of experience with Nikon.,-1,1
1831,1,3,The D600/610 are simply engineering nightmares.,-1,1
1831,1,4,Nikon is aware of the issue and yet they continue to crank out the same bad product.,-1,1
1831,1,5,Now, the problem DOES resolve after about 5000 shots...but, why should anyone pay this kind of coin and have their first 5000 shots be ruined due to a manufacturing error?,-1,1
1832,1,0,Color bands during 2+ minutes long exposure due to light leaking into eyepiece.,-1,1
1832,1,1,In my previous post, I wrote about the strange color band found in my long exposure shots with the d610, i.e. 2+ minutes.,-1,1
1832,1,2,I posted a complaint about it on my instagram, and a friend gave me some insight about this issue.,-1,1
1832,1,3,It turns out that the strange color band was the result of light leaking into the EYEPIECE.,-1,1
1832,1,4,When you are doing a long exposure shot, make sure you use your eye piece cover or else light will leak into it and onto your sensor.,-1,1
1832,1,5,In addition, I have read that this issue happens to other nikon's higher end cameras, like the d700.,-1,1
1832,1,6,Still, I think this is really poor designing on nikon's part.,-1,1
1832,1,7,Why does my entry level nikon d7000 have no issue with light leaking into the eyepiece yet a more expensive, semi pro d610 have this issue is beyond me.,-1,1
1832,1,8,Maybe it was a marketing strategy.,-1,1
1832,1,9,Maybe they want the inconvenience of placing on that eyepiece every time we shoot long expo so it will annoy us enough to buy more expensive nikon cameras like the D3x or something.,-1,1
1832,1,10,But in terms of the camera's performance and image quality, I am pleased with the d610 results.,-1,1
1832,1,11,I even like the image quality of this camera more than canon's 5d mark iii, a 3400$ camera compared to 2000$.Sample pics of color bands:[...][...][...],-1,1
1833,1,0,I have completely lost faith in Nikon with the D610.,-1,1
1833,1,1,After having some challenges with my last Nikon (D300), I thought it might have been an isolated issue.,-1,1
1833,1,2,I was very excited to order and receive my Nikon D610 thinking the issues with the D600 were resolved.,-1,1
1833,1,3,However, out of the box, the viewfinder was completely blurry.....couldn't see a thing.,-1,1
1833,1,4,Tried adjusting with the diopter control, looked on Nikon support site, and nothing worked to correct it.,-1,1
1833,1,5,After doing some research online, it appears I'm not the only one to have this issue.,-1,1
1833,1,6,I was also unhappy with the lens hood included with the 24-85mm lens.,-1,1
1833,1,7,It was so loose, it kept rotating around and fell off a few times.,-1,1
1833,1,8,I REALLY wanted to like this camera and there are a lot things I like about Nikon, but feel their quality has really suffered in the last few years.,-1,1
1833,1,9,With the price of the Canon 6D dropping today, I'm sending this Nikon back and moving to Canon.,-1,1
1833,1,10,I have always felt the brands were close, but this has put me over the edge toward Canon.,-1,1
1834,1,0,Wake up Nikon, it's 2014 already!!!,-1,1
1834,1,1,It almost meets all my needs, has good reviews and I almost bought it!But I think I'll wait for a Wi-Fi + GPS model as we're living in XXI century not Stone Age.,-1,1
1835,1,0,Still oil spot issues.,-1,1
1835,1,1,Ｉbought this camera on Dec 12. 2013.,-1,1
1835,1,2,After 800 shots.,-1,1
1835,1,3,Same oil spot issue is on  left corner (three of them) after F13.,-1,1
1835,1,4,I do suspect Nikon's technical talents.,-1,1
1835,1,5,Really disappointed.,-1,1
1836,1,0,Didn't see any benefit for my needs.,-1,1
1836,1,1,Went to this from some crop sensor Canons.,-1,1
1836,1,2,I use this for mostly video and didn't notice anything over the top that warranted the higher price tag.,-1,1
1836,1,3,I said in the title for my needs only b/c I prefer the Canon menu system and set up.,-1,1
1837,1,0,my "new" camera have only 3 months and don't  work autofocus.,-1,1
1837,1,1,my ''new'' camera only have 3 months and don't work autofocus bottom i need a change my camera and the sensor about camera is very unclean.I buy New camera I never buy refurbished or used camera I'm very angry.,-1,1
1838,1,0,Great camera, but Nikon needs to pull it's head out of its butt.,-1,1
1838,1,1,I have been a Nikon fan since I could afford to buy my first camera - a Nikon F3HP - an outstanding camera that was bullet-proof.,-1,1
1838,1,2,I became an early digital convert and have been waiting patiently for a full-frame digital camera that made sense for me to buy and leverage my base of full frame lenses.,-1,1
1838,1,3,i've never liked the DX format when it comes to wide angle shots.,-1,1
1838,1,4,The specs of the D600 and D800 are outstanding and both cameras feel great, but I watched in disbelief as Nikon let this D600 shutter issue play out on the Internet.,-1,1
1838,1,5,Now it appears to be addressed with the D610 and my experience with the camera has been excellent.,-1,1
1838,1,6,My concern now is that a company that manages product issues in such poor fashion with their loyal customer base is probably going to fail in long run.,-1,1
1838,1,7,The market is too competitive.,-1,1
1838,1,8,Canon and Sony and others have great products.,-1,1
1838,1,9,Nikon needs to treat its customers better if is going to survive as a company.,-1,1
1838,1,10,The D600 issue was such a basic product/PR issue and Nikon seemed clueless about doing the right thing.,-1,1
1838,1,11,I would have bought the 600 or 800 earlier if this issue hadn't played out over the past year, but I am hesitant to invest further in such a poorly managed company.,-1,1
1838,1,12,Nikon should be doing something for its d600 owners --- trade-in, credit, rebuild --- and should start by admitting and managing the issue straight up.,-1,1
1838,1,13,Product issues happen --- Nikon needs to show that it has the integrity to do the right thing to maintain its brand and customer base.,-1,1
1838,1,14,I can assume from Nikon's past history that if there's a problem with the D610, then they will burry their heads and focus on a D620.,-1,1
1838,1,15,So, the D610 gets 5 stars for now but the company behind it gets 1 star, averaging out to 3 stars.,-1,1
1839,1,0,Outdated Video Focus, and stunning quality problem with Nikon.,-1,1
1839,1,1,If you are buying latest DSLR camera at this price point, you will shoot video and thus you want to have video autofocus that actually works.D610 uses contrast detection autofocus that is clueless.,-1,1
1839,1,2,Whenever you zoom or change the subject during video recording, autofocus goes back and forth and frequently loses focus completely.Canon's 70D uses phase detection autofocus, and when I tested it, works very very well.And I thought as D610 is announced "after" 70D, it would incorporate the new phase detection autofocus, but it did not.,-1,1
1839,1,3,Then I wondered "why" Nikon replaced D600 with D610 in such a hurry.... well, see the rest of the 1 star review....,-1,1
1839,1,4,I think I will dump Nikon  brand too, as who knows what kind of problem D610 will have in a few months?,-1,1
1840,1,0,love - hate.,-1,1
1840,1,1,I have the D600 and though I enjoy the picture quality I feel like cheated by Nikon.,-1,1
1840,1,2,The dust business doesn't bother me as much though I can confirm it exists, as the fact that the camera is crippled by design with a dx autofocus that covers little of the sensor and is terribly bad in low light.,-1,1
1840,1,3,The d7100 way cheaper has the autofocus this camera should have!,-1,1
1840,1,4,One star for d610 which remains crippled by design.,-1,1
1841,1,0,Nikon D610 what the D600 should have been.,-1,1
1841,1,1,Some have asked if there was any chance Nikon was going to make good for the customers duped into buying the Nikon D600.,-1,1
1841,1,2,I took the liberty of posting my question to Nikon and the company's reply.,-1,1
1841,1,3,I suspect I'll have to become a Canon user.Question:Since everyone on the photography planet knows that the D610 was developed to address the nasty and low quality problems of the dust/oil issues of the Nikon D600 will Nikon be offering a trade in program for those of us who had the unfortunate lack of foresight to purchase the D600 in the first place?Granted it would require a Herculean effort to get upper management to admit to the problem and to provide a redress that would show forthright corporate character traits, but I suppose it doesn't hurt to ask.,-1,1
1841,1,4,Offering such a program would of course be admitting a flaw but also purchasing untold amounts of goodwill and positive PR for years to come.Answer:Response Via Email (James W.) 10/23/2013 04:02 PMHello Robert Gaskin,Thank you for contacting Nikon Customer Support, I'll be happy to assist you.Nikon has, and will continue to provide quality service to all of our D600 owners.,-1,1
1841,1,5,We have never and will not now, however, offer a trade-in program.Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns, below I have attached a link with contact information:[...]Incident Number: 131022-000623Best Regards,James W.Nikon Technical Support,-1,1
1842,1,0,Dirty company behind dirty image sensor.,-1,1
1842,1,1,I owned a D600 and "enjoyed" the same dust/oil spot issues as everyone else who are "lucky" enough to trust nikon's brand.,-1,1
1842,1,2,It is a shame that nikon does't face the problem of their own creation and tries to avoid the by releasing D610 within less than one year after D600, treating  all nikon's customer like fools.,-1,1
1842,1,3,I urge anyone considering Nikon products think twice , there are simply many other trustworthy vendors out in the market.,-1,1
1843,1,0,A 'Fixed' D600 but a Failed Nikon Brand.,-1,1
1843,1,1,I purchased the Nikon D600 when it first came out and THANKFULLY returned it when the dust/oil began to pop up on the sensor.,-1,1
1843,1,2,I feel horrible for anyone that kept the D600 and now has a faulty camera out of warranty that has (essentially) been decommissioned from Nikon as a faulty product they don't want to fix.,-1,1
1843,1,3,Thus the D610: a Nikon D600 with no dust and oil issues.For those who didn't get caught up in the D600 disaster, the D610 is a great camera in almost all aspects.,-1,1
1843,1,4,For photographers, it offers great performance and features in a full frame camera.,-1,0
1843,1,5,For videographers, you may want to skip the D610 as you can't change the aperture while recording or in live view making changing your exposure just about impossible.,-1,0
1843,1,6,It's a bummer because the quality was very good but this made it unusable for me.,-1,0
1843,1,7,Back to photographs, I'm in awe by the amount of dynamic range in the camera (shooting RAW) and love dual SD card slots and the heavy duty body (although it has a more plastic feel than the Canon 7D).,-1,0
1843,1,8,It is a great all around camera and I love the photo quality I am able to achieve.,-1,0
1843,1,9,It feels and operates more like a pro camera than the Canon 6D and has a good (but not unbelievable) AF system.However, a DSLR is more than just a camera because you are buying an ecosystem.,-1,0
1843,1,10,You will be investing in a company with lenses, batteries, bodies, and will likely be sticking with that company for a long time for future cameras as you will be stuck with proprietary gear.,-1,1
1843,1,11,As a result I have a difficult time recommending the D610 for those not already stuck in Nikon gear.,-1,1
1843,1,12,The D610 is a great camera in many respects but Nikon has fumbled the ball big time and failed to stand up to a widespread product defect that I had.,-1,1
1843,1,13,Nikon is a professional brand and a pro needs to be able to rely on their equipment and the brand behind it to fix/solve every issue.,-1,1
1843,1,14,Thankfully my D800 has not had as many issues (though has had some that Nikon will not address) but I can no longer recommend the D610 for anyone not stuck with Nikon at this point.,-1,1
1843,1,15,For those heavily invested in Nikon gear, The D610 is a great camera but I would not rely on it for a long term investment.,-1,1
1843,1,16,I believe the price will drop heavily in the next 12 months and I don't think the issue is over yet.,-1,1
1844,1,0,Trust the New Nikon and the Nikon Company Now?,-1,1
1844,1,1,I have followed the reports of the D600 issues and I don't like Nikon anymore, in general terms.,-1,1
1844,1,2,This "new" body, the D610, if purchased, implies your acceptance that the previous issues are now fixed and your trust of Nikon to do the right thing concerning warrenty work.,-1,1
1844,1,3,In addition to poor quality control at Nikon,there are a few features in the Nikon D610 that I would find hard to accept.,-1,1
1844,1,4,As mentioned, the AF points are too close together and seem suited to a DX camera and not an FX camera as this is and FX camera.,-1,1
1844,1,5,It is so easy to carry an inexpensive PC cord as a spare to the very expensive TTL cords which can "pull apart" while in use.,-1,1
1844,1,6,Not really because I don't trust Nikon.,-1,1
1845,1,0,I would not recommend the D610 (if you're not already invested in Nikon lenses).,-1,0
1845,1,1,If you're not already heavily invested into the Nikon system do yourself a favor and check out the Canon 6D.I used to own a D600, D610 is the same camera.Canon 6D offers:++ Much better control layout.++,-1,0
1845,1,2,Excellent WIFi integration and App is actually working unlike that D600 WiFi dongle nightmare(you can switch from manual to Av, Tv on the camera without issues and also control aperture, ISO etc. from the App).+,-1,0
1845,1,3,Better grip for larger hands+ Better overall quality (Made in Japan).,-1,1
1845,1,4,Better button feel and operation+ Quieter shutter sound (difficult to explain, simply sounds more solid, not as "clunky/loud" as on D600)o Image quality is outstandingo AF is absolutely OKo frame rate/s is not an issue for meo max flash sync speed is fine for what I need it for (it's not as fast as on the D600)o Single SD card is fine (never used 2 cards before)- lower resolution (not an issue typically.,-1,1
1845,1,5,20Mp is OK)- No flash is a problem sometimes- No time-lapse function integrated in camera (I liked this feature on the D600, however, haven't used it much).In conclusion: I'd no recommend the D610 because you simply don't know how Nikon will handle any possibleissues in the future.I'd rather go with the much larger company and a better made camera.,-1,1
1845,1,6,Canon 6D.,-1,1
1846,1,0,Sold my D600 with dust issues and replaced with the D610. it is too early to judge the durability of D610.,-1,1
1846,1,1,The Image quality is the same as D600.,-1,1
1846,1,2,Took a loss in selling the D600, and so the effective price of this D610 is more than the listed price, in my case.Will be the same for the other D600 owners, who like the D600 for what it produces but have to replace with a D610 because of the shutter issue and thereby end up profiting Nikon in the short run,-1,1
1847,1,0,Nikon Could Have Avoided All This.,-1,1
1847,1,1,Nikon to avoid all these negative comments, all you really needed to do was announce that if anyone who bought a d600 who is experiencing dust or oil issues, return it to the Nikon repair center and they will install the new updated shutter mechanism of the d610.,-1,1
1847,1,2,So the people who bought it won't feel like Nikon just dumped them for new customers willing to pay 2k for basically a camera that has be QC'd.,-1,1
1847,1,3,Treat your customer base right and they will be loyal to you.,-1,1
1847,1,4,When you pull stuff like this, it makes people question what type of company you're turning into.,-1,1
1848,1,0,Shame on you Nikon.,-1,0
1848,1,1,I am a loyal Nikon user and a semi professional photographer who spent around $15K on Nikon lenses and cameras in the last few years.,-1,0
1848,1,2,Let`s start by stating the obvious - D610 is the D600 that actually works.,-1,0
1848,1,3,As such, this review is for the product formerly called as D600, which was then "updated" to D610.,-1,1
1848,1,4,My experience is that after purchasing this product for ~$2000, i found out that the camera I received was plagued by the well known sensor dust issue - so now I have to spend another $2000 for D610 to eventually get the product I was initially promised.,-1,1
1848,1,5,For effectively more than $4000, as in my case, this product deserves a 1 star.,-1,1
1848,1,6,If you are lucky enough to be making your purchase today, getting a D610 may be a 5 star purchase for you as the camera is actually pretty good.,-1,1
1848,1,7,The rating also reflects a warning for new purchasers - shame on you Nikon for the unfair treatment of your loyal customers.,-1,1
1849,1,0,Nikon gives the middle finger to its D600 customers.,-1,1
1849,1,1,The Nikon D610 is merely the Nikon D600 with an attempt to fix the dust/oil spots which have caused an outrage for the past year.,-1,1
1849,1,2,By doing this, they are sticking the middle finger to all the D600 users and further alienating their loyal customer base.I sent my Nikon D600 to be warranty "repaired" in September 2013 and the invoice claims "shutter replaced" but THE DUST SPOTS CONTINUE TO EXIST.,-1,1
1849,1,3,Nikon continues to show poor customer service and refuses to admit they released a faulty product.Why doesn't Nikon just recall all the D600s and send their customers a D610, if it is even any good?I encourage ALL D600 users to give the D610 a poor review until Nikon addresses the D600 problem by offering an exchange.,-1,1
1850,1,0,I do not recommend buying the D610.,-1,1
1850,1,1,Bought a D600 in October 2013 - My fifth DSLR and third full frame.,-1,1
1850,1,2,It suffers from significant amounts of dust showing up in my landscape shots 10X more than any other DSLR I have owned.,-1,1
1850,1,3,The shots are serioulsy affected and need a lot of un-necessary work for them to be useable.I would warn people off buying the D610 because if it has any sort of fault or issue in the future Nikon will first deny it or offer a lame failed fix.Like the others here I feel that Nikon warranty is worth a ballon on a stick.look,-1,1
1850,1,4,at a different manufacturer do not take the £1500 risk.,-1,1
1851,1,0,Correction for a problem that does not exist?,-1,1
1851,1,1,Soooo, nikon lied to its d600 customers about the dirty sensor problem.,-1,1
1851,1,2,Then it developed a correction to the problem that did not exist.,-1,1
1851,1,3,They put that correction in a new camera, but did not offer a fix/upgrade to the d600 customers they lied to.,-1,1
1851,1,4,Now nikon has it's schills on this cite complaining about the negative comments from customers who were lied to.,-1,1
1851,1,5,Keep it up nikon!!,-1,1
1852,1,0,Nikon D610 potential shadowed by the D600 oil issues.,-1,1
1852,1,1,I bought the D600 about a year ago and since then the camera presents the evil dust oil issues.,-1,1
1852,1,2,The issue was not resolved after sensor cleaning, actually it got worst making the camera completely useless.,-1,1
1852,1,3,The first few pictures I took with the camera (less than 1,800) were amazing but the oil issues ruined the others after.,-1,1
1852,1,4,I'm pretty sure that the replacement (D610) have the potential to be a great camera as the D600 but just the fact that Nikon didn't want to acknowledge the issue and provide the right solution is unacceptable.,-1,1
1852,1,5,They know that even cleaning the sensor is not the solution.,-1,1
1852,1,6,Many D600 customer has been complaining that after multiple sensor cleaning and even "change in sensor" (done at a Nikon Center) the camera recur in the same dust-oil issues.,-1,1
1852,1,7,Please my concern is for those that are about to buy the new D610 after my experience with the D600...what are the guarantee that you have as a customer that Nikon will take care of any problem that you can possibly face with a $2,000 camera?,-1,1
1852,1,8,Right now many D600 owners (including me) have a camera that not only is useless but because of this issue it can be resell.,-1,1
1852,1,9,The right solution will be to replace the D600 for the"new" D610 to those that like me have a $2,000 useless camera in a bag.,-1,1
1852,1,10,Please Nikon be responsible and be more customer conscious, if you really know what business is and value your customers.,-1,1
1853,1,0,Really Nikon, really?,-1,1
1853,1,1,The D610 might be a fine camera but, like the SB-910, is clearly just another insult to current Nikon customers.,-1,1
1853,1,2,The well-documented and widespread oil/dust issues with the D600 prompted Nikon to fix the issue.,-1,1
1853,1,3,Unfortunately, they didn't actually do anything to fix the D600 for anyone who owned it.,-1,1
1853,1,4,They simply tell us to buy a new camera or else you are screwed.,-1,1
1854,1,0,As a Nikon D600 owner I should have just as much right as Nikon, by them completely scrapping the D600 and replacing it with the D610.,-1,1
1854,1,1,Therefor, I should be given the option to either refund my whole purchase amount, or given credit towards trading in my malfunction Nikon D600 for any other Nikon camera of my choice.,-1,1
1854,1,2,It?s absurd for a multi-national corporation like Nikon to completely ignore all the D600 owners complaints and not address them properly in the form of a recall or service advisory.,-1,1
1854,1,3,Nikon neglect their clients who have put faith in them in the form of their hard earned money, and decided to re-release the D600 with a new shutter mechanism and name it the D610.,-1,1
1854,1,4,DSLR purchases such as this are a once every 10 year purchase for many including me, I have dreamed and saved up in order to own a Full-Frame camera only to be let down and negligent by Nikon.,-1,1
1855,1,0,Migrated user from Nikon to Canon.,-1,1
1855,1,1,I'm proud to become Nikonians, Because I bought the lay waste D600 and Nikon treated me as greatly as tomfool.,-1,1
1855,1,2,This is the best place that I can raise my voice.,-1,1
1855,1,3,I'm a big fan of Nikon but not any more.,-1,1
1855,1,4,I'm the Nikon user of D300, D700, D600.,-1,1
1855,1,5,Nikon as brand you are losing your credibility and reputation, just because of stupid, nasty D600.,-1,1
1855,1,6,You are making product for the customer, By loosing the existing loyal customer, how you going to survive.,-1,1
1855,1,7,Like me 1000's of customers already migrated to Canon.,-1,1
1855,1,8,If this happen in near future the brand will vanish soon, Your attitude towards the customers will ruin your business.You needs to treat your customers better if you want to survive as a company.Nikon should do trade-in for the existing loyal customers else this forum will continue on D610.,-1,1
1856,1,0,third class customer service!,-1,1
1856,1,1,Horrible customer service, virtually non existent.,-1,1
1856,1,2,very unreliable products.,-1,1
1856,1,3,I would not recommend to buy a Nikon.,-1,1
1856,1,4,Get Canon full frame.,-1,1
1856,1,5,Nikon does not take responsibility of its faulty products.,-1,1
1856,1,6,Nikon makes shutters that develops dust and oil spots issue that never goes away even after shutter replacement.,-1,1
1856,1,7,Canon & Sony never had those problems.,-1,1
1856,1,8,Unless you want to clean the sensor every week, Do yourself a favor, avoid this.,-1,1
1856,1,9,Avoid being taken again & again & again by Nikon customer service rep.,-1,1
1856,1,10,Avoid the pain of calling & emailing them for weeks.,-1,1
1856,1,11,Get Canon Full frame ..... much better !,-1,1
1857,1,0,We have had our D600 for a year and it's been into the shop three times for the same issue.,-1,1
1857,1,1,Oil drops on the sensor.,-1,1
1857,1,2,Nikon replaced the shutter but has taken a new response as of today.,-1,1
1857,1,3,They say some dust is normal and that there is software out there to remove spots if needed.,-1,1
1857,1,4,I had a D200 and cleaned the sensor ONCE in five years, and this camera has needed cleaning 30-45 days after I receive it back from the factory three times in a row.,-1,1
1857,1,5,If this is normal dust, why is it accumulating all in the left, upper side of the picture?,-1,1
1857,1,6,Why are others having so many issues?,-1,1
1857,1,7,Why is there a new D610 replacement that has a new shutter mechanism, it was released in a year with little upgrade otherwise?,-1,1
1857,1,8,Mnnn, could it be Nikon is trying to get out of the D600 business because the camera is defective and they can't fix the problem?,-1,1
1857,1,9,They don't care, that is the worse part.,-1,1
1857,1,10,At this point, I would guide you to Canon.,-1,1
1857,1,11,Nikon doesn't stand behind their products.,-1,1
1857,1,12,This particular issue is ripe for a class action suit in my opinion.,-1,1
1857,1,13,If the bad reviews were mixed, I would say it's bad luck.,-1,1
1857,1,14,But just about every bad review has the same issue with oil on the sensor.,-1,1
1858,1,0,Nikon should refund D600 owners.,-1,1
1858,1,1,As thousands of D600 owners show frustration with the oil issue, Nikon should simply refund us or offer a real solution to the problem.,-1,1
1859,1,0,Product with a design flaw!,-1,1
1859,1,1,It's interesting to see Nikon releasing a faulty product into the marketplace...only to fix it one year later with a new product and not addressing the defect in the original product!!This may be a relatively small blip for Nikon, however, I wonder how much they care about people who invested $2K and have to live with a badly designed product.I own a D600 and have had to send it in for sensor muck issues for over 5 times in less than an year.,-1,1
1859,1,2,The muck issue crops even after the sensor and shutter mechanism are replaced - Nikon claims to have replaced the my D600's sensor at least two times, however, the dust keeps cropping up.This speaks volumes about how Nikon chooses to run their product development and the sort of company they are turning into.,-1,1
1859,1,3,As a consumer, I have no option but to either live with a product with a design flaw or spend another $2K on the improvement - or maybe dump the brand, go Canon....The clear message is that, with Nikon, "Brand loyalty does not equate to Customer Service"...,-1,1
1860,1,0,D600 owners vs Nikon.,-1,1
1860,1,1,I want this D610 so much but can't get myself to buy it because of how Nikon mistreats the D600 owners.,-1,1
1860,1,2,I wonder why there isn't law suit in place.,-1,1
1860,1,3,I understand that Electronic Lemon Law wasn't passed, but what about the Uniform Commercial Code or the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.,-1,1
1861,1,0,Trust other reviewers - DO NOT BYE THIS!,-1,1
1861,1,1,I hope Nikon learns and respects its loyal customers.,-1,1
1861,1,2,Go Canon.,-1,1
1861,1,3,Trust the other reviewers - DO NOT buy it..go to Canon..especially because of the way Nikon has decided to treat its loyal customers.....!!,-1,1
1861,1,4,I am regretting a D600 purchase!,-1,1
1862,1,0,I have owned the 200, 300, 600, 700.,-1,1
1862,1,1,I have always been a Nikon user, but its time for a change.,-1,1
1862,1,2,The Nikon dust issues actually were a shaving issue the shutter was causing.,-1,1
1862,1,3,Nikon never admitted to this, just released another camera.,-1,1
1862,1,4,The video is also not even close to other formats.,-1,1
1862,1,5,I love Nikon, that said I am moving on with a heavy heart.,-1,1
1862,1,6,Maybe this pixel war will someday be over, when everyone realizes that we don't need billboard images of dogs playing and birthday cakes.Adam,-1,1
1863,1,0,Be wary of buying this camera - If it is flawed Nikon will only fix it in the D620.,-1,1
1863,1,1,Horrible Customer service gives this camera the 1 star.,-1,1
1863,1,2,Just waiting for my $2000 investment to break so I can be told to buy the D620.,-1,1
1863,1,3,Time to make the switch to Cannon.Yes this camera appears to be better than the D600 but I'm so upset with Nikon right now.,-1,1
1863,1,4,They don't deserve good customers right now until they take care of the 600,-1,1
1864,1,0,D610 reviews.,-1,1
1864,1,1,Before Nikon deserves a good review on this particular camera, they really need to step up to the proverbial customer service plate and satisfy the d600 owners, not throw them under the bus like they have done,-1,1
1865,1,0,Bad Business Move by Nikon.,-1,1
1865,1,1,It's no wonder Nikon's profits were below expectations the past couple of years.,-1,1
1865,1,2,They're saturating the market with tons of the same cameras, not offering support to retain their customers, and light years away from having as good video quality as Canon, Panasonic, or even Sony.There were so many complaints about the D600 having problems... why discontinue it and rebadge it as a 610?,-1,1
1865,1,3,To "solve" the spots issue?,-1,1
1865,1,4,This only proves further that Nikon is at fault with the engineering and manufacturing of this camera.Technically my score is 0/5 but Amazon only allows 1/5 at the lowest.,-1,1
1865,1,5,Would not recommend to anyone.,-1,1
1865,1,6,Please try Canon or Sony (since the Nikon sensors are designed by Sony anyways).,-1,1
1866,1,0,Nikon D600 oil problem.,-1,1
1866,1,1,Anyone know if there is a recall or replacement option available for D600?Despite of the fact that I love taking pictures with my Nikon D600, THE OIL/DUST issue is a major pain and Nikon is not willing to address it.,-1,1
1866,1,2,I bought the camera last year and have had multiple conversations with customer service regarding the issue that they don't want to acknowledge.,-1,1
1866,1,3,And Nikon just released the fix in the form of a new camera, with nothing for the D600 users - it's totally unprofessional and unacceptable.,-1,1
1866,1,4,When people ask me about what camera to buy now, I just direct them to Canon...,-1,1
1867,1,0,Angry D600 user coming to terms with the D610.,-1,1
1867,1,1,I'm changing my former 1 star review.,-1,1
1867,1,2,Why did I give them a 1 star review?,-1,1
1867,1,3,Because I was very upset with Nikon's handling of the D600, the camera that's nearly identical to this one.,-1,1
1867,1,4,They never admitted a problem, gave simple "have you tried not changing the lenses in a dust filled area?" responses, and after attempting to fix my D600 a few times, I have simply given up on that and came to an understanding with Nikon.,-1,1
1867,1,5,That's all I will say about that.The D610 on its own merits is a solid 4.25 star full frame camera.,-1,1
1867,1,6,Why not 5 star?  because it's still using the same sensor as the D600 which came out last year.,-1,1
1867,1,7,It's a year old sensor being sold today for $100 cheaper than the D610 did initially.,-1,1
1867,1,8,The AF points are still somewhat centered in the middle but in the real world, very usable.,-1,1
1867,1,9,I should know, I've used the D600 for a year.,-1,1
1867,1,10,The sensor is still one of the best full frame ones out there so having used the D600 and spending some time with the D610, it will likely be my next camera.I wish it was't like this.,-1,1
1867,1,11,I wish I would have just bought the D600 and there were no issues and Nikon would have offered a recall but they didn't.,-1,1
1867,1,12,Still, I don't see myself ever going to Canon (that was a bluff) - Sony, maybe but not Canon.,-1,1
1867,1,13,No need to bash Nikon anymore.,-1,1
1867,1,14,They have learned their lesson hopefully.,-1,1
1867,1,15,They have brought dishonor to themselves with the D600 so maybe now they will follow the righteous path.Update *March 2014*I was looking for a camera to replace my D600 and decided to buy the D610 after the first price drop.,-1,1
1867,1,16,Not thrilled that I'm using 2 year old technology, but that's all Nikon has now.,-1,1
1868,1,0,Don't buy Nikon D6xx.,-1,1
1868,1,1,Don't buy the Nikon D610.,-1,1
1868,1,2,Nikon abandoned the D600 owners with a faulty camera design and after sending my $2000 body back twice, it still has debris deposition.,-1,1
1868,1,3,I can't shoot thirty photos without spots in a blue sky!!Even if Nikon improved the D610, I wouldn't trust it or Nikon's service.,-1,1
1868,1,4,They will let you hang and waste $2000!Buy a Canon full frame.,-1,1
1868,1,5,It is solid, maybe better (definitely for video), and is proven reliable.,-1,1
1868,1,6,Or buy my D600...cheap, LOL,-1,1
1869,1,0,Not Happy.,-1,0
1869,1,1,Quality of the pictures same as from Nikon D5100 :-(.This camera IS NOT AN UPGRADE!Besides that: Poor costumer service!In one year we will see the D620 with GPS and WLan...DO NOT BUY IT.,-1,1
1870,1,0,Theiving Nikon.,-1,1
1870,1,1,nikon gets one star because there's no way of giving it a zero.,-1,1
1870,1,2,a camera is only as good as the company that stands behind it.,-1,1
1870,1,3,i have had other nikons, and these bums really do not have any respect for their loyal consumers.i,-1,1
1870,1,4,bought a couple of cameras that substituted inches for centimeters in the advertising, e.g., promising photo-quality exposures up to 16 x 20 inches when the fact was 16 x 20 centimeters.,-1,1
1870,1,5,these were small, compact cameras.my,-1,1
1870,1,6,first nikon was the old analog F-5.,-1,1
1870,1,7,THAT was a camera, but those days are long gone now.,-1,1
1870,1,8,Today, upper management is more concerned with how much of a bonus they'll walk away with instead of returning customers.SHAME on you Nikon.,-1,1
1870,1,9,and SHAME on you AMAZON for not taking care of your customers by preventing thieving manufacturers like NIKON from selling their goods on your web site.Time to buy a CANON on another web site.,-1,1
1871,1,0,From d600 user.,-1,1
1871,1,1,Nikon just rolled over all the d600 users.,-1,1
1871,1,2,Yes, this is not a d610 review!,-1,1
1871,1,3,If Nikon has the audacity to give the middle finger to all d600 users by releasing a new product just to get pass a faulty release, we, the d600 users have the right to say our voice here!Yes, nikon this is the screaming voice of all your loyal d600 that you cashed on.,-1,1
1871,1,4,We are still cleaning our sensor the every other week!,-1,1
1871,1,5,How dare you nikon?,-1,1
1872,1,0,Nikon answer to their failure.,-1,1
1872,1,1,the 610 should not be here,I ve been with Nikon since the non digital one and the d600 issues should have been traited another way,here another 'almost 2000 dollars' to fix and to spent,its easier for them and just show how they care about the people who spent lot of money on a camera with issues,Canon would have done differently i bet.Im sure this 610 is a great camera but its just the previous one,600, with no issues.,-1,1
1873,1,0,Same as 600 but for now minus the oil spots.,-1,1
1873,1,1,Very sorry to steal the thunder from new 610 owners, but what Nikon has done to 600 owners and distributers is nothing less then thaft.,-1,1
1873,1,2,I had 2 and bailed out just in time.,-1,1
1873,1,3,Both cameras are pretty much the same, minus the oil on 610 but then who knows.,-1,1
1873,1,4,Somehow Nikon needs to be schooled that this is wrong.,-1,1
1873,1,5,No one should be allowed to do that to a consumer, no one.Cheers,,-1,1
1874,1,0,Nikon needs to replace the oily d600.,-1,1
1874,1,1,Not screw over its customers as they have here.,-1,1
1874,1,2,Not a very good move Nikon.,-1,1
1874,1,3,I'm off to Sony.,-1,1
1875,1,0,I am reallly disgusted to have read about the oil stain on sensor problem for the D600, and whats bothering me even more is Nikon's non-acceptance of the issue!!,-1,1
1875,1,1,Why would anyone want to spend $1996 on a camera body they are unsure about in terms of sensor integrity and in some cases AF issues.,-1,1
1875,1,2,I was always a Nikon fan but have now moved to Canon for good!,-1,1
1875,1,3,Canon has undoubtedly the best customer service ever.,-1,1
1875,1,4,Thumbs down for Nikon,-1,1
1876,1,0,It takes a special kind of gift, in wrong direction, to buy this junk.,-1,1
1876,1,1,Ask millions of previous Nikon D600 owner, how they feel about being dumped by Nikon.,-1,1
1876,1,2,Those invested on the earlier version, they can't sell it; they are stuck with this super-expensive junk... Do yourselves a favor by dropping a oil on your car paint job, and observe how quickly oil can deteriorate paint job.,-1,1
1876,1,3,Protective coating used on electronics, such as ones used to protect the photo sensors, are not built to withstand same harsh environments as the automotive paintings.,-1,1
1876,1,4,Was it really the shutter mechanism that is spattering oil over the sensor, or is Nikon lying again?,-1,1
1877,1,0,Great camera and easy purchase!,-1,0
1877,1,1,I LOVE the camera!,-1,0
1877,1,2,Now that I own it and have unpacked the extras, I feel like in retrospect I'd have been willing to forego some of the (to me) less necessary additions and instead get a second, extended range lens.,-1,1
1877,1,3,I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars for this reason only.Caveat: if you buy this package, open it IMMEDIATELY!,-1,1
1877,1,4,The Nikon manufacturer's warranty must be registered no more than 10 days from the date of purchase.,-1,1
1878,1,0,Great camera, low end accessories.,-1,0
1878,1,1,Camera is great!,-1,0
1878,1,2,The accessories are a bit "low end" and I would recommend buying the pieces separately and it's about the same cost.,-1,0
1879,1,0,Great Camera, Okay Package.,-1,0
1879,1,1,The camera is great.,-1,0
1879,1,2,Works great.,-1,0
1879,1,3,The packaged items are okay.,-1,0
1879,1,4,Not all Nikon items.,-1,0
1879,1,5,The big flash sold was a vivitar.,-1,0
1879,1,6,I thought i was getting a great package, but there were other combos sold by others where you get better items in the kit, but it did come with a 32GM sony memory card.,-1,0
1879,1,7,I would get the package with the bigger zoom lens instead.,-1,0
1880,1,0,Wonderful Camera.,-1,0
1880,1,1,recommend this item to anyone who wants more out of their DSLR without breaking the bank.,-1,0
1880,1,2,Marvelous Images with amazing detail, images captured from the D3200 & D3100 can be found at this link eugenesimagination.smugmug.com .,-1,0
1880,1,3,controls are very comfortable and easy to use.,-1,0
1880,1,4,I have been able to capture stunning images wiht it without any issues, iso is fantastic for its price and quality is outstanding, I have never had an issue with Nikon in the past and continue to be a long term customer of their products.,-1,1
1880,1,5,only one issue i had was not with the camera, more with the seller.,-1,1
1880,1,6,not huge just the fact that in the descriiption of the items included with the package it says "25 free photo's, voucher included" I didnt find them in the box that the items were shiped in.,-1,1
1880,1,7,nonetheless  that wasnt why i bought there product.,-1,1
1880,1,8,i purchased it because it was a Killer deal.,-1,1
1880,1,9,the photos were just a bonus taht made no difference with me.,-1,1
1881,1,0,Accessories kit a great deal but be wary of shortcomings.,-1,0
1881,1,1,I recently ordered a Nikon D3200 that came in an accessories kit.,-1,0
1881,1,2,It takes beautiful, high quality pictures and is relatively easy to use.,-1,0
1881,1,3,The letdown was with the gadget bag, which was entirely too small.,-1,0
1881,1,4,When I contacted Amazon to note it was not the bag depicted in the ad and was incapable of holding other "gadgets," they agreed to ship another bag.,-1,0
1881,1,5,The replacement, however, was the exact same.,-1,0
1881,1,6,No quibbles with the value and quality of the camera and components.,-1,0
1882,1,0,Nikon D3200 Kit.,-1,0
1882,1,1,Some items in the kit, I will probably not need.,-1,0
1882,1,2,The Card reader didn't work, so I bought a media reader from Walmart, and now it works fine.,-1,0
1882,1,3,A nice tripod came with the system, and I will use that.,-1,0
1882,1,4,The Flash Unit I haven't tried, but the flash unit on the camera works so much better than the one that I was using on my old Olympus Evolt 500.,-1,0
1882,1,5,I am in love with the ease of use of the Nikon and the performance in low light situations, which is more than I expected.,-1,0
1883,1,0,Very good.,-1,1
1883,1,1,Sent as I ordered.,-1,1
1883,1,2,The only thing I dislike is that the bag has the brand yashica, not Nikon, but it is not a real problem.,-1,1
1884,1,0,Very good Camera.,-1,1
1884,1,1,the shipment was on time, the camera met my expectations and the kid was very complete at least for a beginner like me.,-1,1
1884,1,2,Recommended,-1,1
1885,1,0,My biggest problemm (whic makes me wonder) is that the case is mouldy.,-1,1
1885,1,1,I hope the camera wasn't exposed to water.,-1,1
1885,1,2,I called the number but Focus camera is closed.,-1,1
1885,1,3,I am going to go over everything with a fine tooth comb.,-1,1
1885,1,4,I cannot recommend this product from Focus until I get an explination and a new camera bag.,-1,1
1886,1,0,Excellent.,-1,0
1886,1,1,I am frankly a little puzzed by others' comments about the image quality of this camera.,-1,0
1886,1,2,I have shot digital exclusively since 1999 and this is by far the best point-and-shoot I have owned.,-1,0
1886,1,3,I usually shoot with a Canon 5D or 1DS Mark II and this little NV10 holds up really well against these and certainly beats all the compact cameras I have owned (Canon, Casio, Sony, Contax).,-1,1
1886,1,4,I have printed 16"x20" prints from the NV10 after almost no editing in Photoshop CS2.,-1,1
1886,1,5,There is a little noise (I shoot the NV10 at ISO 100) and a minor application of Noise Ninja's filter removes any noticeable noise.,-1,1
1886,1,6,If this is the case and yours seems very noisy, send it back and exchange it for another.,-1,1
1886,1,7,I took this camera to India for a week and I couldn't pry it out of my wife's hands - she loved the size, responsiveness, image quality, exposure and ease of use.,-1,1
1887,1,0,This is NOT a pro camera, it is an "All the time - Everywhere" camera.,-1,1
1887,1,1,I shoot with a Canon 1D Mark II and an assortment of lenses.,-1,1
1887,1,2,Many times my gear sits at home because face it, who wants to carry camera gear that weighs more than a small country?,-1,1
1887,1,3,Many times I wish I had a camera in my pocket.,-1,1
1887,1,4,I played around with plenty and narrowed it down to this camera and the Canon S3 IS.,-1,1
1887,1,5,The S3 was the winner in many areas except one - size.,-1,1
1887,1,6,I wanted a camera that, when in its case, is still very portable.,-1,1
1887,1,7,I want to toss it in my pocket with my keys and my comb and not have it look like I have a tumor.Yes the Nikon E200 is better.,-1,1
1887,1,8,The lens is what does all the work.,-1,1
1887,1,9,The D200 cannot be taken everywhere, this camera can!I leave it on AUTO and anytime I use the flash I underexpose by 0.7 and my world is fine.,-1,1
1887,1,10,The flash is good for close distances, the battery lasts long enough for a day out, and the megapixel rating is simply wonderful.Good points:Metal body!Buttons on the back make selecting menus so very easy!Size, or lack thereof!Lens is covered when camera is off!Screen is pretty much scratch proof!Neutral points:Only a 3x zoom, but any bigger and it would not fit in my pocket.Battery lasts for about 200 shots, so take the charger with you.Extra power battery supposedly available, have not seen it.POWER button is lit and shutter button is not.,-1,1
1887,1,11,Folks turn it off when shooting because they press the wrong button.Sounds are all corny.Bad points:When you record movies, the sound is missing for about 2 seconds on each end, so shoot extra and edit later.No power-on lock, you can accidentally power it up in your pocket.AF not so hot in the dark.Overall, if you want a camera small enough to ALWAYS have with you, this is it.,-1,1
1888,1,0,This camera is great.,-1,0
1888,1,1,I recently purchased this camera and have found it to perform very well.,-1,0
1888,1,2,I have digital versions of my brothers wedding photographs that were taken on a digital SLR and the images that I've taken, in similar light conditions, with the NV10 are actually superior in quality.,-1,1
1888,1,3,It is true that in low light conditions when you do not use a flash and shoot at high ISO speeds there is increased grain / noise in the image but that is true for most compact digital cameras.,-1,0
1888,1,4,I'm of the opinion that if you shoot a lot of low light photographs you should use a tripod and shoot at low ISO's with this camera for excellent results.,-1,0
1888,1,5,There are plenty of more technical reviews of this cameras performance on the web and I encourage you to seek them out.,-1,0
1888,1,6,For a very compact camera, this one really has a lot of flexibility and the user interface is intuitive and a pleasure to use.,-1,0
1889,1,0,An Excellent Camera FOR WHAT IT IS.,-1,1
1889,1,1,To compare this camera to a Nikon D200-or any DSLR-is ridiculous: IT IS A POINT-AND-SHOOT! Can you take excellent photographs with an NV10  (good enough for someone else to want to buy)?,-1,1
1889,1,2,Photography, from the equipment to the final, printed product, is an entirely subjective endeavor.Build:There is no point-and-shoot on the market in this class equal to the NV10's build quality.,-1,1
1889,1,3,(5 stars)Interface:The Smart-Button interface will be used, eventually, by nearly every other camera maker.,-1,1
1889,1,4,(5 stars)Design:In camera battery charging was a poor option for obvious reasons.,-1,1
1889,1,5,(2 stars)However, considering the overall camera...What former Leica designer moved to Korea? (5 stars)Image:Some reviewers have said that the camera's images have too much contrast and color saturation and complain that there is no way to rectify this in-camera; I somewhat agree.,-1,1
1889,1,6,For my tastes, contrast is fine, but only pure reds oversaturate.,-1,1
1889,1,7,It would be nice to correct this while shooting, rather than wait to Photoshop it later.,-1,0
1889,1,8,However, the shots I have made thusfar have been excellent.,-1,0
1889,1,9,As for the noise issue: If it bothers you that much, buy a different camera.,-1,1
1889,1,10,Samsung does not claim to be all things to all photographers.,-1,1
1889,1,11,If you bought an NV10 and found yourself dissatisfied with the in-camera NR or amount of noise present...tough.,-1,1
1889,1,12,Do more research before putting down your money next time.,-1,1
1889,1,13,There's always e-bay if you don't want to keep it.Before complaining about noise, use some common sense.,-1,1
1889,1,14,A 1 1/8" CCD with 10.3 million pixels will make noise above 200 ISO.,-1,1
1889,1,15,In normal light, 100-200 ISO images are noise-free or at least make noise that looks more like film grain.,-1,1
1889,1,16,If you want to shoot in low light, don't free-hand it: Use a flat surface or tri-pod.Consider your planned subject matter and the environment in which you plan to shoot, then select the appropriate equipment.,-1,1
1889,1,17,(4 stars)Software and Stuff:The included software ignores Mac users.,-1,1
1889,1,18,IPhoto downloads NV10 images, and Photoshop does its thing, but it would be nice to have access to Samsung's proprietary software.,-1,1
1889,1,19,I fear problems when company updates come down the pipe.,-1,1
1889,1,20,Also, factory accessories are difficult, if not impossible, to come by.,-1,1
1889,1,21,(2 stars)Objective Conclusion of an Entirely Subjective Subject:The NV10 is a great camera for what it is and maybe even the best available at its price.,-1,1
1890,1,0,Amazing look & feel.,-1,0
1890,1,1,Disappointing image quality.,-1,0
1890,1,2,Let me start by saying that this camera is by far the best looking and the best built point-and-shoot camera I have ever held in my hands.,-1,0
1890,1,3,It is, for the lack of a better word, perfect.If only the same could be said about image quality -- this is where the camera is a severe let-down.,-1,1
1890,1,4,There is noise; noise everywhere, and even at the lowest ISO setting.,-1,1
1890,1,5,There is also a focus issue, with an unacceptable percentage of images being out of focus.,-1,1
1890,1,6,My particular copy was backfocusing more than can be attributed to user error.,-1,1
1890,1,7,Forget about reliable low-light focusing too; it's mostly a hit-and-miss situation.If,-1,1
1890,1,8,I were to sum this camera up in a few words, I'd say design and marketing gone wild.,-1,1
1890,1,9,There is no place for 10 MP in this class of cameras, not until they get the image quality right.,-1,1
1890,1,10,Look, if all you're doing is look at pictures on your monitor, email them and publish them online, then 3 MP is plenty enough.,-1,1
1890,1,11,If you print 4x6, then 5 MP is starting to become overkill.,-1,1
1890,1,12,But 10 MP? Give me a break.I am a long-time DSLR user, having used Canon cameras with L lenses.,-1,1
1890,1,13,I mention this since I want to be clear that I am not expecting similar output from the NV10.,-1,1
1890,1,14,In the end, I could not with a sane mind justify keeping the Samsung, despite its drop-dead gorgeous looks.If you want the best currently available image quality in a point-and-shoot camera, run, don't walk, and buy the Fuji Finepix F30.,-1,1
1890,1,15,If however style matters more, then there is nothing out there like the NV10.I so wanted this camera to work out for me.,-1,1
1891,1,0,Convenient camera (but user manual is a little vague) I have a Nikon D80 Digital SLR and an older Sony DSC-V1 digital camera.,-1,1
1891,1,1,But I wanted a smaller camera that I could easily carry around everywhere and use at any time.I tried the Canon Elph, the Nikon Coolpix, and others in a local camera store.,-1,1
1891,1,2,But they were either too slippery to hold, or too big/heavy, or lacked a decent wide angle, or didn't support decent manual modes.,-1,1
1891,1,3,WOW!SMART TOUCHThe camera manual is a little vague about this.,-1,1
1891,1,4,Swipe-and-pause (not press) from one button to its neighbor scrolls pictures one-by-one.,-1,1
1891,1,5,Swipe-and-pause across more buttons scrolls faster through multiple pictures.,-1,1
1891,1,6,To keep scrolling without swiping over and over, swipe-and-pause but end on the very last button on the left, or on the second-to-last button on the right.The Zoom button lets you zoom out to view multiple thumbnails in a photo album view (swipe-and-pause to scroll left/right/up/down) and then zoom in for the full view of a selected picture.SIZE/GRIPThis camera is skinny!,-1,1
1891,1,7,I have (previously) uploaded a picture to Amazon showing the camera with a dime for comparison.It has a decent grip, and it's slightly longer than most of the other comparable cameras I tried.,-1,1
1891,1,8,But you could try it in a store to decide for yourself.PICTURE QUALITYIt only supports JPG (no TIFF or RAW formats).,-1,1
1891,1,9,By default, it's set on JPG Medium, but you can set it to JPG Fine.To give you a sense of the colors, the grain, issues with the image at the corners, low-light handling, and shake reduction (or not), I have previously uploaded an uncropped picture of some jelly fish (at an aquarium), taken handheld with no flash in Automatic mode.,-1,1
1891,1,10,The only light was from the soft/dim light inside the tanks.,-1,1
1891,1,11,The room was dark because these jellies don't tolerate light well.MANUAL SETTINGSYou usually only get two F stop choices available at any time.,-1,1
1891,1,12,(F2.8 and F7.1 commonly appear, but the these choices change when you zoom.)SHAKE,-1,1
1891,1,13,REDUCTIONThe ASR is digital, not optical.,-1,1
1891,1,14,So, it's not the same as having a vibration reduction lens.,-1,1
1891,1,15,(Also, the manual indicates that you need to enter a special shooting mode to get the ASR.,-1,1
1891,1,16,So, apparently you don't get ASR most of the time.)SD,-1,1
1891,1,17,CARDThe manual guarantees compatibility with 1GB max.,-1,1
1891,1,18,I haven't tried a 2GB card yet.The camera also has 20MB of internal memory built in, so you can actually take a couple of pictures even *before* you buy a card (or after you fill up a card).REMOTEThere's a remote available in certain countries, but I have yet to see it available (by itself, at least) in the US.BATTERY LIFEOnce you get past the newbie need to use up battery life while fiddling with learning to use the camera, it doesn't seem too bad.,-1,1
1891,1,19,The batteries are very small (as shown in my uploaded picture), so it's easy to carry a couple of extras.ZOOMThe 3X optical zoom is OK.,-1,1
1891,1,20,The newer Samsung NV11 has a 5x optical zoom (but maybe Samsung traded that for something that I would miss).,-1,1
1891,1,21,The NV7 has a 7X optical zoom (but it's a bigger camera).I've had the NV10 for nearly a year now, and I'm pleased with it.,-1,1
1892,1,0,Pretty Awesome.,-1,0
1892,1,1,I went on a bike ride in chicago in the rain, and it got wet, and still took great pictures.,-1,0
1892,1,2,I've also dropped it, and stepped on it, and none of these things has effected the performence.,-1,0
1892,1,3,The only reservation I have about this product is it's night mode.,-1,0
1892,1,4,When you shoot in a low light situation without a flash the pictures are very fuzzy.,-1,0
1892,1,5,I've found that I can use a higher ISO or change the exposure speeds to get a good picture, or you just turn on the flash.,-1,0
1892,1,6,If it weren't for that little hick-up I would give it a 5 star rating.On the USB charging and data transfer cable.,-1,1
1892,1,7,I've found it to be 100%.,-1,1
1892,1,8,If you have a problem with it, send it back to samsung.,-1,1
1892,1,9,The only thing that I've found is you have to turn the camera on for it to sync to your computer.,-1,1
1892,1,10,If the camera is off it just charges.When i first got the camera I did think there was an awful lot of noise in the pictures.,-1,1
1892,1,11,Then I looked into the different setting and saw that you could set it to ISO100, you can also set it up for Soft Normal or Vivid colors, and you can set up the pixels for fine or very fine.,-1,1
1892,1,12,There are also a some fun filters and various focusing options.,-1,0
1893,1,0,Style, Design, Quality.,-1,0
1893,1,1,I've had the NV10 for a few days now.,-1,0
1893,1,2,The new touch sensitive interface is a great new way to navigate!,-1,0
1893,1,3,At first it was weird but after getting used to it, its great.,-1,0
1893,1,4,Its quick to adjust a setting to make sure your getting a good shot.,-1,0
1893,1,5,Changes are real time so you can see your changes on the screen.,-1,1
1893,1,6,You slide your finger on the touch sensitive buttons.,-1,1
1893,1,7,ISO settings from 100 to 1000.,-1,0
1893,1,8,Although you start getting bad noise above 500.,-1,0
1893,1,9,You can get nice 10mp pic at ISO 200.,-1,0
1893,1,10,Different scene modes are easy to choose.,-1,0
1893,1,11,The flash is strong and spreads well.,-1,0
1893,1,12,Fast startup and shoot times.,-1,0
1893,1,13,Ergonomics are very good.,-1,0
1893,1,14,You can charge the camera with your USB.,-1,0
1893,1,15,Big difference with this camera compared to others is the nice 3-5X zoom.,-1,1
1893,1,16,I don't like the browsing through the taken pictures by sliding on the touch screen buttons, if your not careful it will browse through them way too fast.,-1,1
1893,1,17,You can select and delete multiple pictures in the thumbnail mode which is nice.,-1,1
1893,1,18,Video capture is strong and lets you also zoom while filming.,-1,1
1893,1,19,Audio capture was weak.,-1,1
1893,1,20,Maybe I can adjust this?,-1,1
1893,1,21,The ASR function doesn't really work, must be a marketing thing since most people want this.,-1,1
1893,1,22,Overall its a nice camera to get if you want something a little different than all the other cameras out there.Update:  Daytime shots are very nice.,-1,1
1893,1,23,Night shots are terrible.,-1,1
1894,1,0,Above averager camera that looks great!,-1,0
1894,1,1,This camera is gonna get picked on for having it's flaws etc.,-1,0
1894,1,2,But in the end it's a nice little camera that takes really good pictures, great video, and has a pretty simple interface (thought it requires getting used to).dpreview,-1,0
1894,1,3,recommends this camera.,-1,1
1894,1,4,I agree that when you weigh performance issues against high styling and the low price of this camera - it comes out a winner.,-1,1
1895,1,0,Excellent for an ultra portable camera.,-1,0
1895,1,1,My wife and I bought this camera as an upgrade from the Canon S50 we've had for several years.The camera is very easy to use.,-1,0
1895,1,2,Kudos to Samsung and their user interface.,-1,0
1895,1,3,Much easier for new camera users to access the many options this camera has.Battery life is surprisingly good for such a small battery and the USB charging option is very nice.Cons: the flash is very strong, which is great in a dark room but has a tendency to overexpose shots taken up close (inside 5 feet).,-1,0
1895,1,4,There is no EV compensation for the flash, just for overall exposure.Videos taken with the camera are of good quality with poor audio (what can you expect?) and require conversion if you are going to edit them (most people don't).,-1,0
1895,1,5,Caveat: when taking videos while skiing this winter, there was purple streaking in many sun shots.,-1,0
1895,1,6,Not sure if its a lens or sensor problem.For the price and the convenience I can easily recommend this camera.,-1,0
1896,1,0,Great Interface - Great Pictures.,-1,0
1896,1,1,I'm satisfied with this camera, the smart touch system is very easy to use.,-1,0
1896,1,2,The style&Design; is very fashion.The pictures are great but is not than easy to achieve this, you have to understand and know how to the take a picture with the manual mode and the other preprogram characteristics.,-1,0
1896,1,3,You must to read the manual and take many photos to practice and known your camera.Very easy to charge, bad battery indicator.Very good price for 10 Megapixels.,-1,0
1897,1,0,Best of the point and shoots.,-1,0
1897,1,1,Casio Exilim EX-Z75 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Anti Shake Optical Zoom (Black)I bought both the Casio and the Samsung right before Christmas last year.,-1,0
1897,1,2,At the time, they hadn't come out with the 10mp Casio or the 11mp Samsung, so these 2 were the best comparison products for ultra slim camera models.,-1,1
1897,1,3,After much comparison, I like this Samsung camera better, and here's why.,-1,1
1897,1,4,The Samsung's battery has a better lifespan and it's also easier to charge.,-1,1
1897,1,5,The Casio battery has to be placed into a charger outside of the camera body and it slips easily, so even when you think it's charging, it's not.,-1,1
1897,1,6,The Samsung's battery can be charged while it's in the camera, which is easier and foolproof.,-1,1
1897,1,7,The Casio's buttons are very small, and even though I'm a girl with delicate fingers, I felt like I had to work awfully hard to get the buttons to work, including the power button and the shutter release.,-1,1
1897,1,8,There are a few things I liked better about the Casio, I like that the flash options are on a button and not inside a menu, it's much faster to switch the flash options.,-1,1
1897,1,9,I also like the roundness of it's design a little better.,-1,1
1897,1,10,As far as image quality, the Casio had some distinctive color fringing in highlight areas, and  distinctive noise in low light situations.,-1,1
1897,1,11,The Samsung has noise too, but it's a little less obvious.,-1,1
1897,1,12,The Samsung's auto focus was faster than the Casio's, also the Casio has a long time delay between focusing and being able to shoot the picture, and in that delay it freezes the shot, so you can't continue to watch the motion, and that was very hard to get used to.,-1,1
1897,1,13,I'd be framing a shot, and while it was focusing, I'd not only lose the moment, but I would end up shooting the ground instead of my cat, because I wasn't able to see what was going on while it was focusing.,-1,1
1897,1,14,On the other hand, the Casio's flash seemed to recycle faster.,-1,1
1897,1,15,Also, the Casio's flash is in a better location.,-1,1
1897,1,16,The Samsung flash is located at the top of the camera, so when I would go to take the picture, I almost inevitably had my finger over the flash when it would pop up.,-1,1
1897,1,17,Not a big deal, it hasn't broken or ruined a shot, it's just annoying.,-1,1
1897,1,18,One of the few glitches I've seen with this camera is the macro/close up mode:  I don't know if it's a problem of distance (being too close to the subject) or if there's a deeper problem, but the autofocus will find a spot and pretend to be focused, and then it suddenly switches and is way off.,-1,1
1897,1,19,This doesn't happen on every shot, but enough to be a hassle.I can't remember all of the features of the Casio, but I don't remember it having manual options for shutter speed, iISO or aperture, but I know the Samsung does.,-1,1
1897,1,20,I also don't recall it being able to take Video, but I could be wrong about that also.,-1,0
1897,1,21,The Samsung's video function is a little rough, but it's good to have for those random moments that you wouldn't want to miss.,-1,0
1897,1,22,I'm a professional photographer who was looking for a fun camera to keep in my purse, and after trying these 2 out, I kept the Samsung for myself and gave the Casio to my sister.,-1,0
1898,1,0,Great Camera.,-1,0
1898,1,1,I bought this camera for my teen before our vacation to Australia.,-1,0
1898,1,2,It is very slim for the MP and other features and a very good looking camera.,-1,0
1898,1,3,My teen loves it and took some great pictures and continues taking them.,-1,0
1898,1,4,It's performance in low light is not great at all but for the most part the flash helps.,-1,0
1898,1,5,The video feature is good and a lot of fun to play around with.,-1,0
1898,1,6,Overall a good buy.,-1,0
1899,1,0,I purchased this camera because I have a Canon Digital SLR which can't be used in everyday situations.,-1,0
1899,1,1,I am somewhat disappointed in the overall image quality of this camera.,-1,1
1899,1,2,In great light you will get very usable images but as soon as the light diminishes, your images will suffer.,-1,1
1899,1,3,Don't get caughtup into the Megapixel numbers because an image/camera is more than just the MP count.,-1,1
1899,1,4,All in all this camera fits its intended purposes for me, I was very close to purchasing a Canon P&S; but when I laid eyes on this beauty I had to have it regardless of image quality.,-1,1
1899,1,5,My personal rating on a 10 scale is Image Quality = 4/5;  Video = 8; Sexiness = 10  Rugged body, So So images, Great Video, Good Price, Beautiful Camera,-1,1
1900,1,0,I LOVE THIS CAMERA!,-1,0
1900,1,1,This camera has great image quality and I love the new toch sensitive buttons.,-1,0
1900,1,2,This camera is so easy to use...anyone can just pick it up and learn how to use in a matter of seconds.,-1,0
1900,1,3,BUY THIS CAMERAI agree with the other comment that the charging slot should be somewhere else instead of on the bottom of the camera!,-1,0
1900,1,4,(Who thought of that one?!?!?!?),-1,0
1901,1,0,Don't buy this.,-1,1
1901,1,1,I felt impressed with the camera when I first saw it, but after few months, the pictures showed horizontal white lines, according to a tech this was related to a sensor, if you want to waste $200 buy it this piece of junk, I won't buy another Samsung camera, terrible experience,-1,1
1902,1,0,Great Cam.,-1,0
1902,1,1,This is a great camera, fast shooting speeds manual mode has tonnes of features.,-1,0
1902,1,2,Great Pictures too.,-1,0
1902,1,3,This is really a unique design and the interface is fast.,-1,0
1902,1,4,The pop out flash was an interesting touch too.Although I didn't really notice any difference witht he Shake Reduction.,-1,1
1902,1,5,And this was a refurbished item, but I think there was a little too much dents and scratches that I'd hoped for.,-1,1
1902,1,6,Doesn't do as well in dark environments as some other cameras.All in all I cannot complain about the camera itself, got it dirt cheap since it's a refurb but it's just because of the excess scratches that I couldn't give it a 5/5.,-1,1
1903,1,0,I left it in my coat  pocket.,-1,1
1903,1,1,The ON button got pushed.,-1,1
1903,1,2,The lens tried to extend.,-1,1
1903,1,3,Now, it doesn't open at all anymore.,-1,1
1903,1,4,Nice camera while it worked, though.I also kind of thought the "touch" interface with the buttons along the edge was goofy.,-1,1
1904,1,0,Samsung? Great camera, great software, good pics.,-1,0
1904,1,1,I'm most happy with the look and size of camera i take it everywhere.,-1,0
1905,1,0,Excellent Size, Mediocre ImageExcellent Size, Very Poor Image.,-1,0
1905,1,1,I pre-ordered this beautiful little camera over a month ago.,-1,1
1905,1,2,This camera is so great on paper... *sigh*.Using the highest quality ISO (100) at the best JPEG quality with medium noise reduction, I have to say that if the Nikon D200 RAW image at 10.2MP is a "10" on the quality scale, then this Samsung NV10's very best 10.1MP image is no more than a solid 3.The best way to describe the image at 100% is to say it looks like high-quality color printing on newsprint.,-1,1
1905,1,3,There is very noticeable noise--linear grain patterns, actually--in all my test images.,-1,1
1905,1,4,The color is washed out, although is somewhat improved when changing the camera's sRGB IEC61966-2.1 colorspace to Adobe RGB (1998).I tried using their full auto settings.,-1,1
1905,1,5,I used full manual (F2.8 and F7.1 are the only two apertures available).,-1,1
1905,1,6,I tried different speeds, even under and over exposing.,-1,1
1905,1,7,All images were uniformly poor.I was hoping for a good point and shoot to go along side our D200.,-1,1
1905,1,8,While it's true that the body of a Nikon D200 alone is about four times the price (and 10x the weight) of the NV10, the image quality isn't acceptable.,-1,1
1905,1,9,I really don't think even a novice shooter will be happy with the results.Finally, the USB cable provides both download and power recharge for the camera.,-1,1
1905,1,10,While I love that one cable does both, it took me 10 minutes of fiddling with the cable to realize the data connection is extremely touchy (I'd installed the driver 3 times thinking I just hadn't gotten the software right).It takes lots of careful wiggling near the camera-end of the USB cable to get the connection noticed by Windows XP Pro; I'm assuming this may be a hardware issue limited to my own NV10.Hopefully Samsung has a firmware upgrade that will substantially improve the image fidelity and color space for this ergonomically perfect little point and shoot.,-1,1
1906,1,0,Samsung NV 10.,-1,1
1906,1,1,This is a beautiful highly styled camera, but, the lens is terrible,  and also very inconsistent, sometimes not bad.The manual is a waste of paper, telling you nothing.The controls are awkward and not conventional, sometimes not working well at all.Samsung should have done their homework better, this camera is a dog and not worth the money, had Samsung gone a bit farther this could have been a winner, as is, it is a loser.,-1,1
1907,1,0,refurbished bit o junk.,-1,0
1907,1,1,Not really fair to judge on a refurbished camera that didn't work at all, but it felt nice in my hand, and the sellers (whose name escapes me) were nothing short of stellar.Since the camera didn't work I didn't have a chance to work through the learning curve on the non standard user interface...Probly won't be getting a samsung anytime soon,-1,0
1908,1,0,OK camera, terrible customer support.,-1,1
1908,1,1,However at some point it was damaged and sent to Samsung for repair.,-1,1
1908,1,2,That turned out to be a naightmarish experience.,-1,1
1908,1,3,I don't recommend buying a Sumsung camera because if you ever need it serviced, you will have to deal with the most incompetent bureaucrocy that will loose your camera and will keep you on phone for hours inventing various excuses of why the camera is lost.,-1,1
1908,1,4,For closest approximation of the Samsung customer service read Frantz Kafka's "Trail".,-1,1
1908,1,5,The book will cost you less than the camera here on Amazon, but the impressions will be the same.,-1,1
1909,1,0,Great design, crappy image quality.,-1,1
1909,1,1,I, like everyone else who bought this camera, was won over immediately by this camera's design.,-1,1
1909,1,2,It is by far the most beautiful digital camera I have ever seen or heard of.,-1,1
1909,1,3,The retro design is really sweet.BUT, the image quality leaves something to be desired.,-1,1
1909,1,4,If the lighting is right, the quality is fine, but should you ever want to take a photo in low-light conditions (enough light to take a clear shot) without a flash, the resulting image has so much noise that it looks as if it was taken w/ a $15 webcam.,-1,1
1909,1,5,Also, images of things in direct sunlight are so washed out that most if not all detail is lost.,-1,1
1909,1,6,If you don't mind using the flash whenever there is inadequate ambient light, then go for it.This is Samsung's first stab at a high end digital camera, and i'd say that they should try again.,-1,1
1909,1,7,It's Korean garbage in a pretty package.and to the person who wrote this:"I am frankly a little puzzed by others' comments about the image quality of this camera.,-1,1
1909,1,8,I have shot digital exclusively since 1999 and this is by far the best point-and-shoot I have owned.,-1,1
1909,1,9,I usually shoot with a Canon 5D or 1DS Mark II and this little NV10 holds up really well against these and certainly beats all the compact cameras I have owned (Canon, Casio, Sony, Contax).,-1,1
1909,1,10,I have printed 16"x20" prints from the NV10 after almost no editing in Photoshop CS2.,-1,1
1909,1,11,There is a little noise (I shoot the NV10 at ISO 100) and a minor application of Noise Ninja's filter removes any noticeable noise.,-1,1
1909,1,12,If this is the case and yours seems very noisy, send it back and exchange it for another.,-1,1
1909,1,13,I took this camera to India for a week and I couldn't pry it out of my wife's hands - she loved the size, responsiveness, image quality, exposure and ease of use."The bad image quality seems to be the rule, not the exception.,-1,1
1909,1,14,And, if you have to use software to get rid of noise that should be a huge red flag right there.,-1,1
1910,1,0,Use a case!!!,-1,1
1910,1,1,I have had this camera for 2 months now and am on my third version of it.,-1,1
1910,1,2,If you don't use a case, and you place the camera in your pocket, it easily turns on.,-1,1
1910,1,3,When it turns on, by default the zoom lens extends.,-1,1
1910,1,4,In my pocket, it twists the lens and breaks a gear.,-1,1
1910,1,5,I try to turn the camera off and the lens will not retract.,-1,1
1910,1,6,For a few times, I can start the camera by twisting the lens but thereby break even more gears.,-1,1
1910,1,7,Eventually, the camera will not even turn on.The camera is great, but does show some graininess in low light conditions (photographing concerts).,-1,1
1910,1,8,Other than these issues, I love this camera and take it everywhere.,-1,1
1910,1,9,I suppose I need a slim case so I can still consider this a "Pocket Camera" and won't be returning it every month.,-1,1
1911,1,0,Big pixel, small camera.,-1,0
1911,1,1,Just bought NV10 a month ago before i traveled to Europe.,-1,0
1911,1,2,Great point and shoot camera with many features.,-1,1
1911,1,3,May be 10 Mega pix are a bit too much for amateur like me.,-1,1
1911,1,4,Hope one who wants to buy a new camera like it.,-1,1
1912,1,0,Great Camera.,-1,0
1912,1,1,Great picture quality.,-1,0
1912,1,2,Very small and compact design.,-1,0
1912,1,3,First camera so i have nothing to compare this to.,-1,0
1913,1,0,I love this camera....,-1,0
1913,1,1,It is no "pro" camera... but for the price, size and ease to use, this camera is great!,-1,0
1913,1,2,I love its design, its look, speed!,-1,0
1914,1,0,camera is fine.,-1,1
1914,1,1,Support is TERRIBLE.,-1,1
1914,1,2,It's fine.,-1,1
1914,1,3,The picture could be better, but is sleek and easy to use.But I accidentally broke the USB cable that came with the camera and it is NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO REPLACE!!It's my fault that I broke the cable.,-1,1
1914,1,4,Fine.,-1,1
1914,1,5,But Samsung does not sell replacement cables online and do not authorize any 3rd party to sell it either!I called customer support and it has been a nightmare.,-1,1
1914,1,6,First of all, the parts and labor department puts you on hold for over 10 minutes every time you call.,-1,1
1914,1,7,Second, they are rude and frequently sound incredibly bored to even talk to you.,-1,1
1914,1,8,I diligently waited 10-15 minutes on hold for them and they actually just hung up on me!Once I got the darn thing ordered ($40 and extra fee if you want to receive it within 10 days!),,-1,1
1914,1,9,I never received any confirmation of it and I actually paid for the extra shipping (2 day) and still haven't received the thing(it has been 5 business days).,-1,1
1914,1,10,I tried calling back and they just hung up on me again.,-1,1
1914,1,11,It's the middle of the work day and I cannot get anybody on the phone.AVOID if you feel like you may need to replace a part at some point!,-1,1
1915,1,0,Terrible Delivery system for FREE with Super Saver Shipping.,-1,1
1915,1,1,I'm still waiting now(3/20)Order 3/12, Shipped : 3/17,Delivery estimate:  March 26, 2007 - March 30, 2007I can't believe the shipping system.,-1,1
1916,1,0,I also own an Olympus E-P3, the predecessor to the E-P5.,-1,1
1916,1,1,With the E-P3 I use the 14-42mm zoom lens, the 14-150mm zoom lens, the 15mm body cap lens, and a Panasonic 14mm prime lens.,-1,1
1916,1,2,Of those, the one that is on my camera 95% of the time is the 14-150mm.,-1,1
1916,1,3,I love the size and weight of the E-P3 and the quality of the pictures it produces, so it was not a difficult decision for me to upgrade to the E-P5.,-1,0
1916,1,4,When I received the E-P5, I was very happy with the new features.,-1,0
1916,1,5,I also liked the 17mm prime lens that came with the kit, which in combination with the E-P5 produced the most outstanding pictures.Unfortunately, there is one element of the E-P5 that turned out to be a show-stopper for me.,-1,1
1916,1,6,I've since (sadly and reluctantly) returned the camera.I use my E-P3 with the optional large grip.,-1,1
1916,1,7,It makes the camera a delight to hold and use.,-1,1
1916,1,8,With any of the lenses, it is a wonderfully comfortable and balanced product.,-1,1
1916,1,9,It comes with a small permanent grip that is not helpful in any way.,-1,1
1916,1,10,There is no natural position for the fingers on the front face of the camera.,-1,1
1916,1,11,With no place to adequately 'grip' the grip, one must exert a lot of pressure squeezing the front and back panels in order to hold the camera properly.I did an A-B comparison between the E-P3 and the E-P5 using the same lenses on each camera.,-1,1
1916,1,12,The result: I could hold the E-P3 in my hand all day; with the E-P5, I couldn't wait to take the shot and put the thing down.,-1,1
1916,1,13,Maybe those who never held an E-P3 won't notice this problem.,-1,1
1916,1,14,Many on-line and magazine reviewers, though, have noted their dislike for the E-P5 grip.,-1,1
1916,1,15,Despite its other wonderful features and qualities, the E-P5 body is a no-go for me.I contacted Olympus on the off-chance that they might be developing a larger grip as an add-on accessory.,-1,1
1916,1,16,They responded that there is no new E-P5 grip in the works.,-1,1
1916,1,17,So, the camera is now in the mail heading back to Amazon.,-1,1
1916,1,18,If it works, I'll re-purchase the E-P5 in a NY minute.,-1,1
1917,1,0,Great camera.,-1,0
1917,1,1,The performance of this camera is incredible.,-1,0
1917,1,2,In virtually all respects it has exceeded expectations.,-1,0
1917,1,3,The combination of small size, big power and lots of features make it a great choice.,-1,0
1917,1,4,No regrets whatsoever.I did not give the camera 5 stars because the Olympus menus could be simplified.,-1,1
1917,1,5,The Super control panel is not a default item, but should be.,-1,1
1917,1,6,Without it, navigating the menus is ridiculous.,-1,1
1918,1,0,E-P5 - a fine tuned E-M5.,-1,1
1918,1,1,As current owner of GH3 and ex owner of EM5, the main reason for getting this instead of the GX7 is the 5 axis IS.,-1,1
1918,1,2,This is the only camera beside E-M5 that give you beautiful stabilized video using prime/vintage lens on handheld.While GX7 has probably checked a lot of boxes that most of the user wanted (range finder style with EVF on the corner, IBIS, peaking for video and still), For me, I don't really uses EVF much on my GH3 and ex E-M5 so it doesn't bother me much.,-1,1
1918,1,3,The focus peaking in video is really helpful which I wish Olympus could somehow implant it someday.Some pluses over the E-M5 that other reviewers seem to miss- Anti-flicker option, no more annoy flickering in PAL region, though Panasonic have this implanted ages ago, I believe it is the first in Olympus machine.-,-1,1
1918,1,4,Shutter lag option - default is normal for some reason, but if you change to short the blackout between each shot is even shorter.,-1,1
1918,1,5,(shorter than GH3)- Ability to enlarge anywhere on the screen while recording - pretty useful option if you want to zoom in on the go using prime, unlike other cameras which you have to set (digital) zoom in first and only can zoom in the center of the screen before you can record.,-1,1
1918,1,6,Though the footage is less stabilized this way than without zooming, and quality is not as good as the ETC from Panasonic body.-,-1,1
1918,1,7,longer battery life, 400 vs 320 on E-M5.,-1,1
1918,1,8,Though no where long as GH3's 540 but better than other M43 body with 300ish battery life- no more greenish tint with the 1030K LCD over E-M5/GH3's 610K OLED, it has better clarity due to higher resolution, but the difference is not that major.Overall I quite like the camera, though for some it is on the more expensive side when compare to GX7, the full kit with 17mm and VF-4 is the more bargaining option if you sell the VF-4 and 17mm.,-1,1
1918,1,9,If it can have some of the features implanted like peaking in video and more bit rate/fine tuned codec in video as currently Olympus camera have pixelated footage if there is a lot of stuff/movement in the scene, it could be 5 star for me.PS: The Photo story mode is really nice, I use this a lot to share photos on instagram via connection from mobile phone.,-1,1
1919,1,0,Ok, this is hard to review since mine died after 1 1/2 days.,-1,0
1919,1,1,While it worked, I really started to enjoy it, it is quick, the evf is really nice even while wearing glasses.,-1,0
1919,1,2,The wifi worked great, the playback is the best I've used.,-1,0
1919,1,3,But...if the camera won't hold up to heavy use and carry, then it is no good to me.,-1,0
1919,1,4,Mine might be a fluke, but I will not get another one and have it die on me a month from now.,-1,0
1919,1,5,I hope everyone else's experience with this model will be good.,-1,0
1920,1,0,Almost great, but...,-1,1
1920,1,1,After a few hundred images I have mixed feelings and find I still prefer my Olympus E-P1 bodies over this model.,-1,1
1920,1,2,I should note that I very rarely shoot video and have not captured any video with this camera.Positives:1.,-1,1
1920,1,3,Love the Focus Peaking.,-1,1
1920,1,4,I am getting some great shots with my 40 year old Minolta MC Rokkor lenses, especially the 58mm f/1.4.2.,-1,1
1920,1,5,I shoot mostly in manual, and find the shutter speed and aperture dial work much better for me when compared to the E-P1.3.,-1,1
1920,1,6,I like the improved Quick Menu.4.,-1,1
1920,1,7,I love the size of the touchscreen and the ability to tilt it - a big plus over the E-P1.,-1,0
1920,1,8,I find it funny that "pros" criticise anything that's not a DSLR, but then see them in the studio using an iPad to view images in real time and to sometimes even fire the camera.,-1,1
1920,1,9,Why not just use one of these and compose on the "big screen"?5.,-1,0
1920,1,10,More fun "Art Filters".Negatives:1.,-1,0
1920,1,11,Seems to be a lot more color artifact, especially in the sky, than is the case with the E-P1.,-1,1
1920,1,12,This occurs with my Olympus, Panasonic/Leica, and old Minolta lenses, no matter what the settings (I think I've tried every combination).2.,-1,1
1920,1,13,Seems to overexpose images at neutral EV, find I am holding exposures by -1 stop.3.,-1,1
1920,1,14,Easy to inadvertently engage touch screen shutter release.Bottom line, I give the camera 4 stars, I still feel the E-P1 is a better "all around" compact shooter.,-1,1
1920,1,15,However I will keep and use the E-P5 as it really shines for:1.,-1,1
1920,1,16,Macro shooting - can't beat the bright, tilting touch screen for close macro shots.2.,-1,1
1920,1,17,Using my old, non-Olympus glass - focus peaking is very accurate, works great and I wish it were available on my EP-1 bodies.The only thing that really prevents me from giving it 5 stars is the color artifact in shots with clear, blue sky.,-1,1
1920,1,18,Easy to fix post production, especially if processing RAW images, but shouldn't JPG's be as clean as a first generation E-P1?,-1,1
1921,1,0,Excellent camera after a year of use.,-1,0
1921,1,1,I own several DSLR's in addition to my  Lumix GX1, OMD E-M5 and E-P5.The E-P5 flash release button is poorly designed in that every time I handle the camera I inadvertently release the flash.,-1,1
1921,1,2,Nearly always when I remove it from my Lowepro Adventura Ultra Zoom 100 case the flash is popped up and just waiting for me to break it.After using the extremely well-designed E-M5 with its separate and substantial card and battery doors the flimsy door on the E-P5's combo compartment is annoying and waiting to be broken.My other big gripe is the arrangement of the control dials on the E-P5.,-1,1
1921,1,3,One cannot use the E-P5 and the E-M5 interchangeably because the E-P5 mode dial and the E-M5 rear control dial are in the same position which leads to confusion and mistakes.,-1,1
1921,1,4,One has to get used to one or the other or one has to stop and think about which camera is being used.It does take great pictures.Update Aug 30,  2013: I have taped the flash so that it cannot open.Update Feb 8, 2014: I used the EP-5 extensively and then gave it to my daughter who owns several cameras.,-1,1
1921,1,5,She loves the camera paired with the Lumix 20mm lens.,-1,0
1921,1,6,BTW the flash is still taped shut and has never been used because it is totally unnecessary with the fast lens and the excellent IBIS.,-1,0
1922,1,0,Weak Video Capabilities.,-1,0
1922,1,1,Solid build quality but Olympus is now lagging seriously behind in video support.,-1,0
1922,1,2,The single frame rate and paltry bit-rate in such a high-dollar camera with such capable hardware come down to nothing but neglect.A better video codec would in no way sacrifice stills image quality or camera size, as cameras smaller and 1/3rd the price handily demonstrate.,-1,0
1923,1,0,Perfect Camera only if it works!,-1,1
1923,1,1,I am a travel photographer and I bought this camera on November 15th to take it with me in a trip to northern India in Nov.1st The camera worked perfectly till the third day then the shutter completely stopped working!!When I click on the shutter release, the shutter opens up and never closes again and the camera freeze for 3 seconds before it goes black and i have to turn it off and on again.so,-1,1
1923,1,2,photography is done for the rest of the trip and i spent the rest of the trip shooting with a Gopro.Whats even worse is that i contacted Amazon for a return and replacement and they said that they cant do that and I have to contact olympus directly.whats,-1,1
1923,1,3,even more worse is that I contacted Olympus service center in Egypt (cuz i got back to Egypt from India) and they said that they don't have any spare parts for this camera and they don't offer replacement and they asked me to wait till they contact olympus main office and see "IF" they can provide them with a repair for this camera or no.I'm still waiting, and even if i got a replacement, it doesn't matter cuz the trip is already over!bottom,-1,1
1923,1,4,line:-The camera is really perfect when it actually works.-seems,-1,1
1923,1,5,that neither Olympus nor Amazon provides any kind of proper reliable product support!-I will never ever rely on this camera as my main camera for travel photography, NEVER EVER AGAIN!,-1,1
1924,1,0,Excellent image quality but unacceptable battery life.,-1,0
1924,1,1,Switching from Panasonic GF1 to Olympus E-P5 was a big step up in image quality but a big step down in terms of usability (read below).Note that throughout this review I'm mostly comparing EP5 with my trusty Panasonic GF1 that I'm using for quite a few years.Positives:- Excellent image quality - ISO2000 is always usable, while at higher ISO it depends on luck and needs.-,-1,0
1924,1,2,Great image stabilizer - I could take sharp images at 20mm & 1/2s.-,-1,0
1924,1,3,Good focus precision and speed in static scenes (especially with newer lenses).Negatives:- Main negative point: Battery life is unreasonably short.,-1,0
1924,1,4,I could easily shoot for a full day (a few hundred pics) with Panasonic GF1, but I can't do this with EP5, especially if I use the flash.,-1,0
1924,1,5,I don't want to take extra batteries with me because that would be against the very reason I purchased this camera: mobility.,-1,1
1924,1,6,I could shoot for a full day with a fresh battery with all of my cameras so far, so I expect no less from my next camera.-,-1,1
1924,1,7,It always feels slow.,-1,1
1924,1,8,Need to wait 1 second to switch menu view, which sometimes drives me nuts.,-1,1
1924,1,9,Flash is always recharging a few seconds too late, by when I miss the scene.,-1,1
1924,1,10,Autofocus tracking is bad - focusing fails on most moving targets.,-1,1
1924,1,11,Sometimes the preview button just doesn't work (!) - need to press it many times and after maybe 6-7 seconds it starts working again.-,-1,1
1924,1,12,The user interface is in general an exercise in frustration.,-1,1
1924,1,13,The menus are the worst I've seen: poorly grouped, poor choices of GUI design.,-1,1
1924,1,14,Most of the time I can't find important settings because they are "buried" deep among countless less important options, and there's no obvious grouping criteria.-,-1,1
1924,1,15,The "review picture" mode does not overlay the main picture parameters such as exposure time, fstop and iso - the only way to see that info is a view mode where the image is thumbnailed, and it's so small that it's almost useless.,-1,1
1924,1,16,However, it overlays useless info such as aspect ratio and image quality settings (!).- Flash pop up button is too easy to press.,-1,1
1924,1,17,It gets pressed often in my backpack and the flash pops out.,-1,1
1924,1,18,Breaking it is a matter of time.-,-1,1
1924,1,19,Battery door is flimsy and under designed compared to GF1.-,-1,1
1924,1,20,The English used in the menus is sometimes questionable.I'm returning the camera mainly because of battery life; considering a Panasonic GX7 instead.Overall an interesting but frustrating combination of excellent image quality and user-unfriendliness.I've learned to live with camera limitations, so for me the image quality and the very good image stabilizer are more important than poor ergonomics.,-1,0
1924,1,21,However, the short battery life is just not acceptable.Edit: In the end I returned the EP5, skipped the GX7 and jumped straight to Sony RX1.,-1,1
1924,1,22,Couldn't be happier with the choice.,-1,1
1925,1,0,Not good enough- Inconsistent results- will keep RX100.,-1,0
1925,1,1,This is a well built solid camera.,-1,0
1925,1,2,The menus are intuitive and  functions are easy to access.,-1,0
1925,1,3,I bought it as an upgrade to my RX100.,-1,1
1925,1,4,I was willing to compromise on the pocket-ability of the camera for higher quality photos.,-1,1
1925,1,5,Initially I could not get the camera to autofocus and then with the help of fellow Amazon reviewers found that the 17mm lens has a manual/autofocus ring that can be physically moved to switch between the 2 modes.,-1,1
1925,1,6,After using it for a week, I returned the camera.,-1,1
1925,1,7,I took about 90 pictures at an outdoors function the other day and when taking several pictures less than 1 second apart from each other (P mode) standing in the same position holding the camera in the same position, the results on the exposures were dramatically different.,-1,1
1925,1,8,Bottom line, the pictures are not that much better than the RX100 to sacrifice the portability (which is a very big deal) and $1500.,-1,1
1926,1,0,I bought this camera while bag ago and I couldn't found that pen...what is pen look like?,-1,1
1926,1,1,Is it kind of like a CD card?,-1,1
1926,1,2,I need explanation from Olumpus right away...Oh bythe way I bought four cameras and none of them had pens...what a misleading by Oluimpuss,-1,1
1927,1,0,Good personal-use camera.,-1,0
1927,1,1,The M417 is a good digital camera for typical personal use.,-1,0
1927,1,2,The onboard memory won't hold very many pictures taken at 5mp, but with the price of SD cards constantly falling, it is not too difficult to expand the storage.,-1,1
1927,1,3,Another user wrote a review claiming that this model uses up batteries at a fast rate (after 20-25 pictures or so).,-1,1
1927,1,4,I put in 2 Energizer AA batteries and have gotten well over 100 pictures and the batteries are still going strong.,-1,1
1927,1,5,Maybe it's just a fluke, but it is worth noting.,-1,1
1927,1,6,Yet another reviewer claimed to have trouble using the LCD screen to take pictures and suggested using the viewfinder instead.,-1,1
1927,1,7,On my model I've found that lining objects up in the viewfinder creates an off-center picture that's shifted to the right.,-1,1
1927,1,8,If I use the LCD, the pictures line up fine.The picture quality at 5mp is very crisp and clear, even when printed onto 8x10 photo paper.,-1,1
1927,1,9,I cannot give an opinion on the included software, as I have an SD card reader and use that to transfer pictures.,-1,1
1927,1,10,The camera is lightweight, easy to hold, and the LCD is large enough and bright enough to clearly browse through pictures.,-1,1
1927,1,11,The built-in red eye correction is OK, but you're better off using 3rd-party software to make this correction on a PC.Though I've pointed out a few shortcomings, the M417 is a very nice 5mp camera whose few faults are easily dealt with and not insurmountable.,-1,0
1927,1,12,For the price, it is one of the better 5mp buys currently on the market.NOTE:,-1,1
1927,1,13,If you choose to buy this camera bundled with the M-series camera dock, know that the rechargable batteries included with the dock drain very quickly and take a dispreportionally long amount of time to recharge.,-1,1
1928,1,0,Fairly good Camera, good for normal photos.,-1,0
1928,1,1,I got this expecting a really great camera but I think it's okay for a simple point & shoot camera.,-1,0
1928,1,2,It does take some fairly good 4 x 6 photos, but the detail is still not as sharp as a good 35mm camera (my Minolta 400 Maxxum SLR still takes sharper pictures especially with far away distance detail).,-1,0
1928,1,3,This camera is best for normal photos (people shots about 4 to 20 feet away it's very good) However there are some good things & bad things about this camera.Pros: Great selection of modes, settings, exposure settings, different lighting situations etc.,-1,0
1928,1,4,The software that comes with the camera is excellent & it's very is to download the photos from the camera to your computer.,-1,0
1928,1,5,The manual is excellent also.Modes: Closeup, Fast Shot, Action, Landscape, Portrait & Auto.,-1,0
1928,1,6,It's easy to juggle thru these settings via a button on the camera as well as thru the menu system.,-1,0
1928,1,7,Nice feature of being able to turn on the camera to the last setting mode is convenient.3x,-1,0
1928,1,8,optical zoom, also digital zoom.,-1,0
1928,1,9,As with any digital camera you should use just the optical zoom, digital zoom always reduces the resolution & you will never get any good photos from it.,-1,0
1928,1,10,Optical zoom is okay but also with any digital camera, when you use the zoom your hands better be very steady or use a tripod otherwise you will get blurry shots.Has a self timer which takes 1 or 2 shots automacially.,-1,0
1928,1,11,Also has a Burst shot mode which takes 4 pictures in a row as long as you hold down the shutter.Can take photos in 5 different resolution setttings 1-5 megapixals but I always tell everyone to always shoot in the highest resolution to get the sharpest photos (I run a photo lab & have seen a lot of pixelated photos because people shoot in low resolution to get more photos on their memory cards)I have a 128 mb SD card in my camera & get 49 photos at a time at the highest setting.Cons: Alot of times I get slightly blurry shots if I use the LCD screen to take my photos.,-1,1
1928,1,12,The camera is so small that like other digital cameras it's hard to hold the camera stedy while pressing the shutter.,-1,1
1928,1,13,Your best bet is to use the viewfinder & hold the camera close to you to brace it for the best results.,-1,0
1928,1,14,But I also use the burst shot mode to take a lot of my photos (when you do that your chances are that 1 out of the 4 shots will come out really good)LCD screen is very hard to see in bright daylight (but I have yet to see a digital camera that you could see well outdoors well)In low light situations if you don't use the flash I'ts very hard to get a really good sharp photo.,-1,0
1928,1,15,The camera is so small that it's alway hard not to avoid camera shake when depressing the shutter.,-1,1
1928,1,16,indoor shots come out okay, outdoor day shots are always much sharper & clearer.I wont go into the video mode or the audio recording option on the camera, basically most still digital cameras do this but they are not that great.,-1,1
1928,1,17,You buying these cameras to take still pictures anyway.summery:,-1,1
1928,1,18,It's an okay camera for taking normal good photos, compact enough to put in your pocket, but not better than a good 35 mm camera.,-1,1
1928,1,19,It's a good carrying around camera, that's better than a disposable & good for most situations.,-1,1
1929,1,0,Good camera takes nice pictures, very easy to use!,-1,0
1929,1,1,We received this camera as a gift.,-1,0
1929,1,2,At first I was a little nervous about whether the quality of the camera would be inferior (I have an HP printer that I have had problems with).,-1,0
1929,1,3,However, after using it, I can say that I am very happy with it.,-1,0
1929,1,4,Other reviewers are right--if you use regular AA batteries, they are drained after taking only about 20 photos.,-1,0
1929,1,5,Invest in rechargeable batteries, they will save you a ton of money!,-1,0
1929,1,6,The software that came with this camera is great!,-1,0
1929,1,7,It is super easy to use; I didn't even have to consult the owner's manual once to try to figure out how to save, print, name, or maneuver my pictures.,-1,1
1929,1,8,This is my first digital camera, so I think that tells you how user-friendly this software is.Sometimes this camera takes slightly blurry pictures, but I think that's more user error (me moving slightly) than the camera's fault.,-1,1
1929,1,9,I have taken some amazing photos of my flowers that turned out fantastic!,-1,0
1929,1,10,All in all, this is a good camera that I would recommend, especially for a first time digital camera user.,-1,0
1930,1,0,Great camera and printer combo!,-1,0
1930,1,1,We bought this combo after checking out some of the other combonation's out there and this one is great.,-1,0
1930,1,2,The setup and install were easy and had no problems at all.,-1,0
1930,1,3,The camera works great, although it can only take a few pictures when set at the highest resolution.,-1,0
1930,1,4,However, for us, that's not a big deal.The printer is very compact and has a handle for easy carrying.,-1,0
1930,1,5,The camera connects on top easily and works flawlessly.The only thing I was disappointed about was that it said it came with a Photo Index card kit, cards to print the pictures on, but it wasn't in the box.,-1,1
1930,1,6,We used normal note cards to try it out before buying cards.,-1,1
1930,1,7,Not too big a deal, but still.,-1,1
1931,1,0,I purchased this camera 1 year ago, and I was so disappointed in the performance.,-1,1
1931,1,1,The battery life is terrible, I took it to our town's Christmas Parade, and all the pictures are grainy and really poor quality.,-1,1
1931,1,2,I posted some so you can see, also when you take a picture you can not take a picture for another good ten seconds.,-1,1
1931,1,3,I had a two foot away shot of the rapper Nelly, and the camera didn't take the shot, and I only caught a shot of his tattoo on his arm!,-1,0
1931,1,4,Save your money and get a better camera, like the Canon A630 the same price and much better quality, the battery life is fantastic and the night shots are great too.,-1,0
1931,1,5,The shutter speed is much better too.,-1,0
1931,1,6,I now have my HP in the closet because when I tried to use it on Thanksgiving the zoom would no longer zoom, and the lense does not retract.,-1,0
1931,1,7,The only way I can turn off the power is too take out the batteries!,-1,1
1931,1,8,I never dropped it or mistreated my camera, it is just not a good quality camera.,-1,1
1932,1,0,Simple Camera with All the Functions Needed....Great Starter.,-1,0
1932,1,1,This camera was my second digital camera.,-1,0
1932,1,2,It is very nice as far as price and picture goes.,-1,0
1932,1,3,The pictures come out very clear but you would need to get an SD card because the internal memory will not hold more than 10 pictures.,-1,0
1932,1,4,The functions are simple and ready to use.,-1,0
1932,1,5,There is a single-button video function that takes long videos with audio.,-1,0
1932,1,6,You can also add audio to still photos.,-1,0
1932,1,7,The downside to this camera is that it uses a lot of battery.,-1,1
1932,1,8,Do not use store-bought regular alkaline batteries as it will drain within 25-30 shots w/ flash.,-1,1
1932,1,9,Please use at least a 2200 mah rechargeable battery.,-1,1
1932,1,10,When using rechargeable batteries, you will find that you can get at least 150 to 200 shots, no problem.,-1,1
1932,1,11,Still, the camera is a battery drainer.,-1,1
1932,1,12,Also, the camera only tells you about low battery when it is low on battery.,-1,1
1932,1,13,There is no battery scale on the LCD screen so you do not know when you would need new batteries.,-1,1
1932,1,14,The LCD is enough for regular use to view pictures but I find it somewhat fuzzy in quality compared to transferring photos and viewing on the computer.,-1,1
1932,1,15,The flash recycle time is longer than others and may not be able to take multiple shots within about 10 seconds.,-1,1
1933,1,0,Great camera, great price.,-1,0
1933,1,1,I have had the M417 for nearly a year now and have nothing but the best to say.,-1,0
1933,1,2,First digital camera I have ever had and found it so easy to take photos, transfer photos, and print them.,-1,0
1933,1,3,I have found friends and families cameras too complex to be bothered with, but the M417 is simple to operate and the quality is excellent.,-1,0
1933,1,4,If you can't be bothered to take a photography course and still want great photos, buy the M417!,-1,0
1934,1,0,This camera i have had for a while, and i personally think it stinks.,-1,0
1934,1,1,It is somewhat heavy for this range.,-1,0
1934,1,2,The mega pixels are only 5, zoom is only 3x, and it takes AA batteries.,-1,0
1934,1,3,It's battery life is not very good, it is heavy, and overall i would not suggest it.,-1,0
1935,1,0,Not a very good camera.,-1,1
1935,1,1,I have had this camera since December of 2005.But i got i with the printer too.The printer is very good.But more can be said for the camera.For a few reasons The battery life is very poor.Like it can probley last you 30 mins at the most.And some times if you take a lot of pictures you can use them from the camera.And it will say photo can not be found.And sometimes whene you turn the camera on the screen will be off.And the screen is kind of bleek and dark and blurry too.And the video quality is horrible.And when you are taking a video with the camer the videos are very blurry and poor.And when you take a video you can look at the video on the camera but you CAN NOT HEAR THE SOUND.You have to have a computer to here the sound.And my grandpa has a canon and you can watch the video and hear the sound on the camera too!!!!!And in my opinon HP makes better computers then cameras.,-1,1
1936,1,0,It's been too long ago.,-1,1
1936,1,1,don't remember purchasing this item, must have been very long ago.,-1,1
1937,1,0,Another choice may have been better.,-1,1
1937,1,1,May have been a refurbished product.It's worked pretty good until the last year.Looking for a better camera now.,-1,1
1938,1,0,Dated technology, but good images.,-1,0
1938,1,1,The thing to remember with this camera is that it was "new" back in 2005.,-1,0
1938,1,2,These days, the 5 megapixels isn't much to write home about and the electricity usage is higher than on some of the newer cameras which implement better power management so battery life can be an issue.,-1,0
1938,1,3,Additionally, the largest SD card it will accept is an extremely modest 1 GB.All that being said, the price for this camera is nice for the quality of images it takes.,-1,0
1938,1,4,It has OPTICAL zoom which is better than digital if you are wondering.,-1,0
1938,1,5,It takes excellent pictures in all the lighting conditions I've tried it in with true colors.,-1,0
1938,1,6,It also has a nice burst-shot feature to capture several frames with one shutter press.,-1,0
1938,1,7,It out-performs the "modern" 12 megapixel camera I returned (due to extreme poor quality images even in good light) by a landslide.,-1,0
1938,1,8,This camera is a good "starter" camera for my son.,-1,0
1939,1,0,camera review.,-1,1
1939,1,1,Camera seems to do different things at different times, no pattern to problems.,-1,1
1939,1,2,Quite frequently will display "error in storing", also lens will stay out and camera will turn off.,-1,1
1940,1,0,COMPLETE JUNK!,-1,1
1940,1,1,This is the most over priced and poorest quality cameras on the market.,-1,1
1940,1,2,I have returned mine twice for repairs and now the auto focus is going out.,-1,1
1940,1,3,The camera's MACRO function is a joke and if your looking for a camera that can take pictures in low light then this ain't it because it won't.,-1,1
1940,1,4,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!,-1,1
1941,1,0,good camera.,-1,1
1941,1,1,I've had this camera for well over a year, and I love it.,-1,1
1941,1,2,It does take a while to recharge its flash and that has frustrated me at times.,-1,1
1941,1,3,This can be helped, but not totally avoided, by always having freshly recharged batteries.It does eat batteries quickly, but I find that as long as I recharge them enough, it's fine.,-1,1
1941,1,4,It only takes two AA batteries and most rechargeable batteries come in sets of at least four, so I always have an extra two with me and switch them out if need be.,-1,1
1941,1,5,Of course, if you're the kind of person who always forgets to/never charges their batteries, this is a bad choice for you.It takes wonderful pictures.,-1,1
1941,1,6,I've used it in pretty much any setting you can think of and it's been great.,-1,1
1941,1,7,If you leave it someplace cold it'll take a bit to turn back on, but I imagine any other camera would have a similar problem.Some other reviewers have said this isn't a hardy piece of machinery.,-1,1
1941,1,8,Maybe I've just been lucky, but I've dropped the thing a number of times and it's still good as new.,-1,1
1941,1,9,A little scratched, of course, but it works just as well as it did when it was new.I pretty much recommend this to anyone, unless you have a problem with being patient about things.,-1,1
1941,1,10,Yes, the flash can take a bit to recharge, so just anticipate that.,-1,1
1941,1,11,Make sure your batteries are charged.,-1,1
1942,1,0,good photos but not durable and EATS batteries.,-1,0
1942,1,1,this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful.,-1,0
1942,1,2,BUT, the camera has several down sides:  1. as all have said, it eats batteries big time.,-1,1
1942,1,3,2. it recharges slow between flash and between non flash.,-1,1
1942,1,4,forget about catching a great spontaneous moment.,-1,1
1942,1,5,3. not durable.,-1,1
1942,1,6,i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at ALL.  i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable.,-1,1
1943,1,0,Great photos, but poor performance.,-1,1
1943,1,1,I purchased this for general family use and soon discovered that it drained batteries quickly (even specialty batteries) so I had to keep an extra set of batteries in the case.,-1,1
1943,1,2,However, in fairness to HP the photos are superb and of photo lab quality.,-1,1
1943,1,3,The biggest disappointment is the shutter speed.,-1,1
1943,1,4,There's a one-second delay between the time you press the button and when the camera actually captures the image.Result: You'll always have misaligned or partial photos of people walking and moving objects etc.,-1,1
1943,1,5,I'm not talking about difficult photos taken from or of moving vehicles, but just simple photos.,-1,1
1943,1,6,For example: I took several photos at a wedding of a bride walking slowly to the altar.,-1,1
1943,1,7,Result: Several close-up's of her face but few of her standing full height showing her dress.Forget about candid photos because your subject will see you by the time the flash activates, defeating the purpose.,-1,1
1943,1,8,This is especially menacing.Given the choice again, I would look for another brand that doesn't have the irritating delay.,-1,1
1944,1,0,Poor Battery Life, but Good Pics.,-1,0
1944,1,1,On the bright side--With the 5MP resolution, this camera takes nice, quality photos that turn out impressively well when printed with a photo printer.,-1,0
1944,1,2,Also, the HP Photosmart sells for much less than most comprable digi-cams I priced (the major reason I bought it).On the dark side--This camera is a battery guzzler; granted, digi-cams are notorious battery eaters, but I could go no more than 20-25 pics without replacing the 2 AA batteries.,-1,0
1944,1,3,Also, with a 512MB memory card installed, pictures didn't import very well from the camera to my (well-equipped) Windows XP computer....Often either the camera or the computer froze-up in the process and pictures were lost (major bummer).,-1,1
1944,1,4,This issue didn't occur when the memory card was not in, but, without the memory card, the camera only holds ~15 of the highest quality photos.,-1,1
1944,1,5,With these issues in mind, I exchanged my HP for a 5MP Fuji FinePix digi-cam...I've been MUCH happier with that (no camera-PC connection issues, and a much improved battery life).I do recommend rechargeable batteries with any digi-cam; it makes taking lots of pictures much less painful to the pocketbook!,-1,0
1945,1,0,Not for extensive outdoor use.,-1,1
1945,1,1,I purchased two of these cameras for use in an outdoor setting.,-1,1
1945,1,2,Within a week, both apparently got dust or sand in the mechanics of the lens, and neither camera would function.,-1,1
1945,1,3,I had to take the cameras apart, clean the parts, and reassemble for the camera to operate.,-1,1
1945,1,4,This problem reoccurred almost weekly.,-1,1
1945,1,5,Two months later, one camera has completely ceased functioning, and the other has to be "coaxed" to turn on.,-1,1
1945,1,6,Granted, I have taken over 1,000 photos on each camera, but I have to warn potential buyers that these cameras are not rugged AT ALL.,-1,1
1945,1,7,The photo quality is good, and the settings are easy to adjust, but the housing is not as rugged as an all-purpose camera should be.,-1,1
1945,1,8,I also own a more expensive Canon Elph, and have had no problems operating it in similar conditions.,-1,1
1946,1,0,Warning -- "New" does not mean usable!!!! How can I give negative stars for a complete waste of money.I bought the HP M417 from a secondary seller -- not direct from Amazon-- and itwas $100 down the drain.,-1,1
1946,1,1,The camera was advertised as "new" with perhaps someclaim, not with original box, no batteries.,-1,1
1946,1,2,(The ad's no longer there but thesame vendor is similarly describing a similar camera with a HIGHER price.),-1,1
1946,1,3,No instructions, no cable or software to connect to a computer, and no capsule tohold the batteries to insert into the camera for power.,-1,1
1946,1,4,And because this is now an obsolete camera, even the best camera supply stores on the web don't carry anyparts for it.,-1,1
1946,1,5,So the camera is completely useless.,-1,1
1946,1,6,I complained to the vendorand got a "Sorry sucker, you didn't read the ad carefully" reply.,-1,1
1946,1,7,New trash is still new and unfortunately there are unscrupulous people more than ready to take your money for it.,-1,1
1947,1,0,While I agree with others that this camera takes some pretty nice pictures and is easy to use, I've had the same problems as many have noted here.,-1,1
1947,1,1,For starters, the thing eats through batteries like there's no tomorrow.,-1,1
1947,1,2,I was lucky to get 20 pictures before the batteries crapped out.,-1,1
1947,1,3,My biggest problem, however came when my son was handing the camera over to me at the dinner table and it slipped out of his hand.,-1,1
1947,1,4,The camera literally fell only 10-12 inches to the table, but that was enough to render this camera permanently inoperable.,-1,1
1947,1,5,Be warned: if you are a little bit clumsy or have butter-fingers, think twice before buying this camera!,-1,1
1947,1,6,Red-eye reduction is also a bit of a joke with this one.,-1,1
1948,1,0,Sloooooow flash recharge.,-1,1
1948,1,1,Like everyone else has said, this camera takes great pictures, but it can take a very long time for it to recharge its flash.,-1,1
1948,1,2,It is very inconvenient when you are trying to take a cadid shot.,-1,1
1948,1,3,If you have a large group posing for a picture and you don't like the first one, they all have to wait about 10 seconds for the flash to recharge before you can take another.,-1,1
1949,1,0,Excelent camera.,-1,0
1949,1,1,I was a little doubtful about purchasing this camera, because I read a lot of bad reviews, but honestl I think it's a wonderful and awesome camera, nice features, easy to use, nice pictures.,-1,0
1949,1,2,The only drawback are the batteries, but that is common on digital cameras.,-1,1
1950,1,0,My first digital camera.,-1,1
1950,1,1,I've waited until prices came down to finally invest in a decent digital camera - and the hp PhotoSmart M417 is my first purchase.,-1,1
1950,1,2,[...]It seems to have all the features you'd need for basic photo taking.,-1,1
1950,1,3,The pictures come out clear and nice.,-1,0
1951,1,0,Great deal for the money.,-1,0
1951,1,1,Bought this as a gift for my daughter.,-1,0
1951,1,2,She loves it.,-1,0
1951,1,3,Takes great pictures and she was more than pleased with all the extras that came with it.,-1,0
1951,1,4,Very prompt arrival - easily beating the estimate!,-1,0
1951,1,5,I'd have given it 5 stars had it not been for the camera coming with a battery that I suspect was defective.,-1,1
1951,1,6,It would need recharging after only taking a few pictures.,-1,1
1951,1,7,Ordered a replacement at another vendor and the cost was minimal.,-1,1
1951,1,8,Would encourage anyone to buy this product from the vendor!,-1,1
1952,1,0,NEX 5N vs NEX 7 vs NEX C3 vs other Mirrorless Cameras Mini Review.,-1,1
1952,1,1,Update : Changed rating to 4 stars instead of 5, Original review remain below, So why i did that?,-1,1
1952,1,2,it's because the video capture "audio" quality is awful if you shoot in silent environment (shooting a baby or at home with no noise around) the camera does a lot of UNAVOIDABLE annoying clicking sounds nonstop if you don't use a tripod, every NEX 5N is effected by that, until SONY fix this issue i don't recommend this camera for anyone who plan to take a lot of casual videos with itUpdate 2 : Sony finally admitted the flaw of the issue and they offer a fix/upgrade according to them here : [...](Original review) : First of all i just gotta say that I'm extremely satisfied with the NEX 5n, If you are like me you will spend hours/days researching about Camera samples/reviews/etc before buying a new Camera, problem is many websites are biased or contradict each other, many fans of a system whether it's Micro Four thirds/Sony NEX series and others might say our system is the best but in reality none of these 2 are the best, M43 can be the best for you or NEX series can be the best for you, some even prefer Fuji X100 etc there are plenty of mirrorless cameras right now, i have just gathered all the facts about each system for you here so the final call is yours and i wont be biased i assure you my fellow photographers :)*NEX 5n advantages over NEX 7 (I will speak about NEX 5n vs M43 and NEX5n vs previous Sony NEX Cameras in a second)1-If portability and size is your biggest concern NEX 5n is actually smaller and fits much easier in your pocket, It's also lighter2-Price wise, It cost about half the price of NEX7, and cameras advance so fast now, Investing in a body is not the best option if your budget is limited, Invest in better lenses is much better idea, like the Zeiss 24mm F1.8 E-Mount lens, you will get better results with NEX5n+CZ 24mm over NEX7+Kit lens, so if your budget is limited this can be a huge advantage3-The external Viewfinder of the NEX5n have 2 advantages over the one in NEX 7 first it can be titled, so you can shoot while looking at your feet instead of looking at what is front of you (good for stealth shots) and the second it's more comfortable to use in my honest opinion because it's placed in much better position4-Sensor Quality, Ignore the Mega pixels marketing race, Sony 16MP sensor is being used by Nikon D7000 which is a 1200 dollar camera yet the Sony NEX5n use an advanced 16mp sensor (better than the one in D7000) While the NEX7 got a 24mp it really lose to NEX5n performance in high ISO SO if HIGH ISO is a huge issue for you NEX 5n will win this round (It doesn't mean NEX7 performance is bad, It's just the NEX5n perform better at High ISO)5-The TouchScreen, First thing in your mind now is properly Touchscreen = Toy camera and useless, Well it's not and here is why, You can access ISO/Shutter/UI/etc much faster with the touch screen, we are talking about cameras with bare minimum set of buttons here the NEX7 got 1 more button only over the NEX5n, you can customize your buttons as you wish too, That's not the only advantage of the touchscreen, Sony is using a new "track focus" you can basically touch your target on the screen and he will be AF Tracked, much faster than moving to track a target via none-touch methods, the Focus track combined with the touch screen deliver amazing results really.6-NEX5n,-1,1
1952,1,3,max ISO is 25.600 and MAX 16.000 ISO for NEX7 (for those who care about maximum ISO available)*NEX 7 advantages over NEX 5n1-24MP Sensor, this can be an advantage depends on your use, Do you do a lot of prints and low ISO? then this is the best option for you (over NEX5n) while NEX5n beat it at high iso, the NEX7 beat the NEX5n in low ISO, you will get more details,easier to crop/edit your photos due the higher details.2-NEX5n External viewfinder cost 350box.... so you are already near NEX7 price Territory if you plan to get NEX5n EVF3-With the NEX5n you can't use an external flash+EVF at the same time because both use the same propriety input slot, the NEX7 has a hot shoe (For Sony flashes) and Built in EVF so you can use both at the same time, even if you don't plan to use the hot shoe for a flash there is a built in flash which the NEX5n lack4-The NEX7 got this new TRI dial UI (there are 3 dials on the NEX7 versus 1 only for the NEX5n, there is a second virtual dial though in the touchscreen but i don't count it as real dial) The UI for the NEX7 will be more professional while the NEX5n UI is mostly for amateurs,So in Short it depends on the advantages of each camera, NEX7 might be better for you, however for me even after ignoring the price different a side the NEX5n is the better camera for me due the better high iso performance and portability mainly (I got access to a DSLR when needed but i want a smaller system for certain uses) if you want a more professional UI/hot shoe for flash/shoot in low ISO mostly and you want an EVF the NEX7 sounds like the better dealAbout the NEX C3 ignore it and get NEX 5n because for little more you can get much better camera NEX 5n-Touchscreen and option to use EVF (Nex C3 CANT use EVF)-Faster AF+shutter lag speeds /AVCHD 2.0 1080p60 28MBPS video instead of 720p30-AF track via touchscreen is amazing if you shoot kids, it will keep them on focus always-IR R.control / 10FPS which is much faster than nex C3-Better HIGH iso performance and range/ Much better Grip / Better battery lifeNEX5n get better sharper corners with any previous lenses compared to the older NEX3/5, sony have used Offset microlenses for the sensor so the older 16mm lenses which was soft in the corners will be sharper now and using manual lenses will get you better results with NEX5n over older NEX5 in the corners, which is similar to latest Lecia high end cameras, in short if you use manual lenses upgrading is a must your pictures will look much better believe me i have already tested it and the results are improved over my older NEX 5Shutter sound is quieter now when shooting if you set up electronic shutter through the menu, there is full manual control for video now which is not available in the old NEX 3/5, AF Micro Adjustment for up to 30 a-mount lenses with the LA-EA2, plus Auto-Correction of chromatic aberration/Vignetting/distortion with all Native E-mount lenses which can be turned on/off via menu settingsAbout NEX VS M43 i already own EPL1 and i will properly upgrade to EPL3 soon, i will not talk about M43 vs Sony cameras bodies because the advantage is clearly "mostly" for the NEX5n (bigger Dynamic range/ISO/etc)Sony NEX lenses have 2 issues as of September 20111-They are limited in numbers specially compared to M432-Most of them are made with no portability factor in mind whatsoeverI will speak more about lenses now, If you want an ultra wide angle zoom lens for the E-MOUNT it doesn't exist (That's my favorite lens) with the M43 you actually got more than 1 Utra wide angle lenses so not only you can get 1 but you can chose which to chose, if you want a fast pancake?,-1,1
1952,1,4,none exist for the Sony E-mount lenes for now and none in the future roadmap sadly, the only small sony lens that exist is the 16mm F2.8 but it's too wide for a main lens for most people and it's not as sharp as i like until stopped down so not very friendly to use at night, the Panasonic 20mm F1.7 is great lens (not the best but for Size/performance it's great) if you want a pancake zoom? this might sound crazy but Panasonic is making a Pancake zoom lens with image stabilization too and so on,While it seems in theory that Sony can just release smaller lenses and win the best of both worlds, it doesn't seems like this is a concern for Sony right now, their 2012 lenses road map include 3 more huge zoom lenses and zero prime let alone a pancake lenses, the Sony upcoming 50mm F1.8 OSS while being very sharp from the samples i have seen (sharper than nikon/canon 50mm primes) it's actually BIGGER than both nikon and canon 50mm lenses for their DSLR which is puzzling to create a tiny body and never release tiny lenses for it at least as an option for those who rather use smaller lenses, Sony Officially unlocked their E-Mount to other lenses companies though so anyone can make Native E mount lens if they want, i only knows of Sigma upcoming E-Mount lens which is 30mm F2.8 small primeSo in short again depends on your use you might prefer m43 because of lenses choices over NEX, i can't get rid of m43 because wide shots is a MUST for me and none is available for sony as of now.About Samsung Mirrorless system, while the sensor size is the same as sony it's not as good as sony sensor (not even close) Samsung support is nowhere near sony or M43 too so I'm not interested in itFor manual lenses users NEX offer the best possibilities for you, you can adapt almost every lens using an adapter for manual focus lenses, using the Focus peaking/zoom functions make focusing a breeze and easy, the Offset microlenses is a huge bonus too, and lets not forget the crop factor (1.5X for NEX versus 2X for M43)Overall i recommend NEX 5n for anyone, it's hard to find anything similar in the market for the price right now (Amazing sensor/small camera/tilt LCD/shoots 1080p60 video/touchscreen/easy to use/etc), it does beat any Entry/mid range nikon/canon DSLR "IF" you are type of a person who just sticks to the zoom kit lens, NEX 5N got a better zoom Kit lens and the better sensor.I hope my thoughts about the mirrorless market for now was fair enough and i hope that my review was helpful :),-1,0
1953,1,0,Outstanding picture quality, but video design defect persists even after repair.,-1,1
1953,1,1,This camera has a well-documented design defect that others have commented on, in particular, a very noticeable "clicking" noise in the audio track when you do video recording.,-1,1
1953,1,2,The defect does not affect the picture quality of still images or video, but it does make the video recording feature unusable as the clicking noise is very noticeable.,-1,1
1953,1,3,It appears to be a mechanical defect inside the unit.,-1,1
1953,1,4,The problem was first discovered and acknowledged immediately after the unit first began shipping in September 2011.Sony acknowledged the defect and issued a weasel-like statement on its website saying that the "phenomenon" only occurs "if the camera undergoes sudden motion while recording; motion generally inconsistent with smooth video recording.",-1,1
1953,1,5,An artful way of basically saying it's the user's fault for not holding the camera still during video recording.,-1,1
1953,1,6,This is untrue, of course, as the clicking problem occurs if you move the camera at all during video recording.,-1,1
1953,1,7,The only way to avoid the clicking sound is to record on a tripod; if you use it as a handheld at all, it will click.,-1,1
1953,1,8,There are a ton of videos on YouTube showing examples of the clicking and how easily it can be triggered, even from a slow horizontal sweep of a landscape.,-1,1
1953,1,9,Sony has offered what they call a "performance improvement" (translation: repair) that they say reduces the clicking sound resulting from motion during movie recording.After calling Sony support, I learned that I had to send my brand new camera back to Sony, wait several business days for them to fix it and ship it back.,-1,1
1953,1,10,They only do ground shipment (to/from Laredo, Texas), which means that my brand new camera will probably be out of service for quite a while.To say the least, I'm disappointed with Sony.,-1,1
1953,1,11,Any reasonable testing suite would have uncovered this defect before the units were shipped, so the only logical conclusion is that Sony knew of the defect but decided to ship it anyway.,-1,1
1953,1,12,And then later, when the camera was released, the company played dumb, blamed its customers, and offered a "performance improvement" to pretend that it was doing them a favor.,-1,1
1953,1,13,Wow, what a voyage Sony has traveled since its status as the iconic consumer electronics company it was in the 1980s and 1990s, and it is no surprise that today its most profitable business unit is from one of its subsidiaries that sells insurance.I purchased the camera in December 2011, figuring that because the problem had been diagnosed many months ago, the company would have addressed the problem with all units in the channel that had not yet reached customers.,-1,1
1953,1,14,But no, Sony is doing nothing to fix the problem on units that haven't reached customers -- they're just playing the numbers, hoping to save money because some percentage of customers may not use the video or demand that the defect be fixed.***,-1,1
1953,1,15,UPDATE 01/16/2012  ***This is an excellent camera when it comes to picture quality, so in the end, I did end up going through the Sony "support" program to get my "improvement" for the camera rather than returning it for a refund.,-1,1
1953,1,16,But video recording is a major feature of this camera, and the clicking sound makes video recording largely useless, so keeping the camera in its current form was not an option for me.I sent the camera to Sony's service center in Laredo, Texas, and it came back from Sony in a nice brown box, professionally packaged.,-1,1
1953,1,17,The total turnaround was a couple of weeks, but I had to pay the shipping to Sony.,-1,1
1953,1,18,A dust cap was placed over the sensor opening for shipment, but otherwise, as far as I can tell nothing was done to it.,-1,1
1953,1,19,The clicking problem persists and I'm not sure the camera case was even opened.,-1,1
1953,1,20,(I left the shoulder attached to the unit when I shipped it, and it was still attached to the camera in the exact same place, which makes me suspect the case wasn't even opened.),-1,1
1953,1,21,You can still hear the clicking even from outside the unit if you move it, even if it's not on, which confirms there's still some mechanical problem in there.,-1,1
1953,1,22,Who knows, and at this point, who cares.After one more call to Sony, they said they would have a technician call me, but so far, no one has called.,-1,1
1953,1,23,But back it goes to Sony for repair, since I'm now out of the return period.,-1,1
1953,1,24,One star.***,-1,1
1953,1,25,FURTHER UPDATE  ***After dodging my calls, I finally gave up on Sony support.,-1,1
1953,1,26,My next camera will probably be a Nikon or a Canon, from a company that actually takes pride in their cameras.,-1,1
1954,1,0,Impressive Camera, Especially for the Price.,-1,0
1954,1,1,I am a long time Canon DSLR owner, my current being a T1i, and a small selection of lenses.,-1,0
1954,1,2,I have enjoyed that camera for years, and it's done great taking photos for portraits, weddings, family events, and outdoor/landscape stuff.,-1,1
1954,1,3,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.,-1,1
1954,1,4,I learned about mirrorless cameras as a "bridge" between point-and-shoot and DSLR cameras, and from my reading, these new NEX camera sensors were rivaling their DSLR counterparts (low-mid end DSLRs).I decided to take the plunge and try one out.,-1,1
1954,1,5,The newer NEX-5N seemed to be the popular pick, with big improvements over the NEX-5, and in many ways rivaled the NEX-7.,-1,1
1954,1,6,I've had this camera for a few days now, and have taken probably 45 photos.,-1,1
1954,1,7,So far, the ISO performance has been very impressive.,-1,0
1954,1,8,It totally beats the pants off of my T1i in low light with no flash.,-1,0
1954,1,9,That's not to say that there is no noise, but at ISO3200, I can capture very pleasant photos, which I've never really been able to do before.,-1,0
1954,1,10,The shutter response is nice and fast, and in burst mode can shoot a lot a photos in just a few seconds.I really like how much smaller an lighter this camera is.,-1,0
1954,1,11,I don't feel like I am toting a bowling ball around.,-1,0
1954,1,12,The on screen functions take getting used to if you are already accustomed to a DSLR with analog wheels and buttons.,-1,0
1954,1,13,I have taken to it pretty quick, and have also programmed the custom button settings to my liking.The kit lens seems on par to most kit lenses.,-1,0
1954,1,14,It does a decent job, and is good as a general use/walk around, but leaves you wanting more like a f2.8 zoom or 1.8 prime in creative situations.,-1,0
1954,1,15,The include flash...is a flash.,-1,0
1954,1,16,:)  It's direct only, and doesn't provide any bounce option.,-1,0
1954,1,17,It's fairly bright and acceptable for single person or a small group scenario.,-1,0
1954,1,18,I do very little direct flash lighting, so it's not something I would use much.I have ordered the optional flash, which has bounce options.,-1,1
1954,1,19,I have also recently read that sony is making a hotshoe adapter to allow owners to use traditional SLR flash units, like my Canon 550EX.The adjustable live view screen works really well.,-1,1
1954,1,20,It allows for some creative shooting, without have to guess what the shot might come out like.,-1,1
1954,1,21,The "auto" mode actually works fairly well for general use, but you'll want to learn manual mode to create exactly what you want.,-1,0
1954,1,22,I noticed that sometimes in auto mode, it would choose to not flash, and instead crank up ISO to 1600 or even 3200 for a shot.I have not yet experienced the clicking type sound that some earlier purchasers have experienced, but i'll try some different scenarios, and see if mine is ok.Overall, I am very happy with this camera,  It's light, it's fast, and it takes good photos (even when the light doesn't agree).,-1,0
1954,1,23,I've also ordered the 50 1.8 lens, and am looking forward to it.,-1,0
1955,1,0,Why Is Amazon still selling defective models of this camera?,-1,1
1955,1,1,UPDATE: 21 FEB 2012: Amazon appears to be looking into this issue now - I believe they are intercepting/checking my return to verify this problem.,-1,1
1955,1,2,I don't speak for Amazon in any way of course and don't know what action they will take if any but to me this shows why Amazon is the #1 place to buy from - they become aware of an issue and genuinely are interested in fixing it.,-1,1
1955,1,3,They went out of their way to discuss this problem with me and immediately refunded my purchase.___________________________________________________________________________________________I,-1,1
1955,1,4,received my NEX 5N yesterday and was very excited to start using it.,-1,1
1955,1,5,It takes startlingly great photos even in low light with no flash.Unfortunately mine still has the clicking noise issue when recording video.,-1,1
1955,1,6,This is well documented and occurs if you move the camera at all during video shooting, you hear a loud clicking over your recorded audio during play back.Sony has been aware of this issue for SIX MONTHS and offers a return shipment to Texas where they will provide a "performance enhancement" to fix the problem.There is a page on Sonys support site with details about this.You call Sony, it's not an easy call or process if you can even understand the Sony support rep.,-1,1
1955,1,7,They take your info, give you a list of instructions and then it takes them a day -  24 hours to simply email you a return shipping label.,-1,1
1955,1,8,I called early yesterday and still no sign of mine.Sony takes 5-7 days to complete the repair and then returns it to you.Note that it ships GROUND both ways so your camera is out of service for a good few weeks.,-1,1
1955,1,9,On a brand-new, expensive camera that Amazon continues to sell with the known defect.I read reports from people who did send it in for repair and found one here and on other sites stating the camera came back with glue on the display or was lost during the Sony repair process, and some had scratches on the body and display and other misalignments, damages to the body when the camera came back from repair.,-1,1
1955,1,10,You then have to argue with Sony about replacing the new camera you sent to them for repair - good luck with that.,-1,1
1955,1,11,Sony offered no apology or interest whatsoever when we called and could not have cared less that we were having to send our brand new 5N in to fix a problem they've known about all this time.No thanks.,-1,1
1955,1,12,Instead of continuing to sell these known defective units Amazon should stop and return them for the newer units in which Sony has fixed this issue since Sony is too sorry to recall the bad stock on their own.,-1,1
1955,1,13,There are now plenty of complaints and documentation about this, why sell customers known defective cameras??!I returned my entire order and bought from a camera shop where I could test the newer unit camera first.So instead of an enjoyable day using my new Sony NEX 5 N we spent much of yesterday on the phone with Sony and eventually boxing everything back up and priting return labels for Amazon.,-1,1
1955,1,14,I love Amazon and trust them but this camera needs updating.UPDATE: 02/20/2012I purchased another NEX 5N locally and it has no noise at all when recording video - so for those who want this camera but not the noise issue, you can get a more current version that works perfectly in video.,-1,1
1956,1,0,Amateur photographer friendly!,-1,1
1956,1,1,This was an upgrade from a Nikon P100 model.,-1,1
1956,1,2,That camera was a step up from a digital because of it's manual capabilities.,-1,1
1956,1,3,When the Sony came around I still wasn't confident enough even though it isn't a true DSLR.,-1,1
1956,1,4,With the Sony NEX-5N there are even more capabilities available to the amateur; at times rather daunting.,-1,1
1956,1,5,I have taken a very long time to write a review and I suspect that even now I will not be able to fully express all that this camera can accomplish under the proper hand.,-1,1
1956,1,6,This review will be very simplistic/basic in its terms because I am an amateur.,-1,1
1956,1,7,I love taking photos of the kiddies/family throughout the year.,-1,1
1956,1,8,If you are going from a straight point and shoot or even a model like the Nikon P100 then you will find my review helpful.,-1,1
1956,1,9,Professionals may not, because they want the technical, which I am still trying to learn/master myself.The camera body itself is so light it is rather funny.,-1,0
1956,1,10,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.,-1,0
1956,1,11,The heft increases as you add the lens and a viewfinder if necessary.,-1,1
1956,1,12,Even with the 18-55mm lens it doesn't feel bad.,-1,1
1956,1,13,It is something to get used to though because you can no longer just stick it in your pocket or small purse.,-1,1
1956,1,14,With the 200mm lens it becomes a bit front-end heavy and collapses on its face.,-1,1
1956,1,15,The one thing that I absolutely adore is the 10fps.,-1,1
1956,1,16,My Nikon did not have that ability and it is such a picture saver when it comes to action scenes or the kids not sitting still.,-1,1
1956,1,17,Sony threw in the 55-210mm lens (grateful!), and it has saved me at the school plays and a Memorial Day NY Mets game.,-1,1
1956,1,18,I still find it rather difficult and cumbersome having to figure out which lens I am going to need for the day.,-1,1
1956,1,19,With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.,-1,0
1956,1,20,I would be able to sit on my terrace and zoom in across the street at the neighbors pear tree and actual pears.,-1,0
1956,1,21,I do see that these lenses are far better and truly stabilize on even the furthest zoom, where the aforementioned would have shake in the image.The camera is 95 percent menu driven and accessed by the touchscreen.,-1,0
1956,1,22,This becomes annoying at times.,-1,1
1956,1,23,It can take 5 steps or more to reach the desired location or certain function.,-1,1
1956,1,24,There is a selection wheel where your thumb grips the camera.,-1,1
1956,1,25,This wheel delves deeper into the menu option for specific functions.,-1,1
1956,1,26,With that being said, the touchscreen menu is rather fool/idiot-proof because there are instructions on each menu and even helpful tips on how that function would be useful.,-1,1
1956,1,27,The touchscreen is large and all the info can be easily displayed if desired.,-1,1
1956,1,28,What I don't like is since the menus are only accessible via the touchscreen, it is a fingerprint, sweat and dirt magnet.,-1,1
1956,1,29,There are always stubborn streaks on the screen.,-1,1
1956,1,30,When we took the camera to the baseball game in field box seats on a 98 degree day, I couldn't see the screen no matter which angle.,-1,1
1956,1,31,I was pretty much shooting blind; luckily my images came out without any glaring issues.,-1,1
1956,1,32,There is not a viewfinder included; one can be purchased separately right here on Amazon for 274 dollars.,-1,1
1956,1,33,This should be equated into the total cost of ownership if a viewfinder is important to the consumer.The battery life seems good for now.,-1,1
1956,1,34,Before I venture out, the pack is fully charged and after a 45 minute school function I will be left with about 78 percent.,-1,1
1956,1,35,That is with recording for about 9 minutes and using 10fps option.,-1,1
1956,1,36,If travelling or needing to use the camera for extended periods, then I suggest purchasing a back-up battery pack.,-1,1
1956,1,37,I LOVE that you can see what percentage of battery you have remaining.,-1,1
1956,1,38,No more guessing and losing the perfect shot (happened so many times!) because 1/4 remaining battery equates to 2 percent!This is the first time that the auto modes actually work for me.,-1,1
1956,1,39,I have been able to take low light shots, indoor, sunny outdoor, nighttime etc. without any issues.,-1,1
1956,1,40,The panoramic 3D works but I seem to have some issues with some of the baseball players missing limbs from the frame.,-1,1
1956,1,41,I suspect that it is indeed user error rather than the camera's fault.,-1,1
1956,1,42,I will upload the pics to Amazon's site as a reference.,-1,1
1956,1,43,Onto colors: It has been a joy shooting images where the colors pop out of the screen!,-1,1
1956,1,44,Depending on the shooting mode and style, you can have it that all the blues, yellow, greens or red pop and the rest of the image is black and white.,-1,1
1956,1,45,There are many different styles but I have never had that function and it has proven to be not only fun but useful.,-1,1
1956,1,46,I will attach those images as well.,-1,1
1956,1,47,We have not attached the flash so I cannot review its effectiveness.,-1,1
1956,1,48,There is no lag whatsoever from when the shutter is pressed and released!,-1,1
1956,1,49,I am finally able to capture images as they are seen by my naked eye.Shooting Full HD 1080P:  Shooting HD video is as simple as pressing the red button and you are there.,-1,1
1956,1,50,I have not experienced the loud sound or rattling that other users have.,-1,1
1956,1,51,We have recorded at noisy school functions and in our quiet bedroom.,-1,1
1956,1,52,Hopefully, we have an updated model and won't experience that issue.,-1,1
1956,1,53,There is no jittering, freezing or sync issues as I've experienced with the Nikon model.,-1,1
1956,1,54,I used a SDHC Class 10 16GB card and have had wonderful results.Highly recommend to any individual that wants to slowly step up to a DSLR.,-1,1
1956,1,55,If your point and shoot isn't doing it for you any longer, you want macros and if your budget allows then this would be a wonderful camera to practice on.,-1,1
1956,1,56,The image quality would not disappoint even the professional.,-1,1
1956,1,57,I can only imagine what a professional could accomplish.,-1,1
1956,1,58,IT is too expensive for not being a DSLR and every thing that is standard on other digital cameras needs to be purchased separately; down to the viewfinder.,-1,1
1956,1,59,A few months ago it was very difficult to find a case that fit this model perfectly.,-1,1
1956,1,60,I am hoping that it will be different now.,-1,1
1956,1,61,Finally, it's clunky... not like a true DSLR but something to get used to from your little cute point and shoot.,-1,1
1956,1,62,At the end of the day it will all be forgotten as you are awed by the images taken with your hands.,-1,1
1956,1,63,Thanks Sony, you make me look like a better photographer than I am!,-1,1
1957,1,0,FANTASTIC for low light, such as in restaurants.,-1,0
1957,1,1,I have a large dslr camera, and bought the NEX 5n to have as a second camera.,-1,1
1957,1,2,We frequently get together with friends and go to dinner, and I don't like to use a flash in a restaurant.,-1,1
1957,1,3,My SLR with a fast lens does o.k, but its bulky and its also more attention-getting than a small camera.I took the NEX 5n into a dimly lit restaurant and using the Anti-Motion Blur mode, I was THRILLED with the photos I got.,-1,1
1957,1,4,This is the camera I've been looking for for a long time.My camera does not suffer from the "clicking sound" some have trouble with during video shooting.Due to its very small size, there isn't room for a lot of buttons and dials, so most of the camera's settings have to be reached via a rather cumbersome on screen menu.,-1,1
1957,1,5,You can customize 3 of the buttons on the back of the camera, and that helps tremendously, but there are still several things I wish were more readily available without fumbling through the menu.There is no viewfinder so you must frame your photos using the LCD screen, which can be difficult in bright light.,-1,1
1957,1,6,This can be improved by adjusting the brightness setting, or for $300+ you can purchase an add-on electronic viewfinder.,-1,1
1957,1,7,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.,-1,1
1957,1,8,The camera is so good with low light that I almost never use the flash, but because the flash comes with a little plastic case that attaches right to the camera strap, the flash is always handy if needed.The bottom line:  I LOVE this camera, and though the menu is cumbersome I'd still buy it again because the low light capabilities are awesome.,-1,0
1958,1,0,Defective after Sony Repair.,-1,1
1958,1,1,This is my second 5n.,-1,1
1958,1,2,My first was returned before being aware of the Service Call issued by Sony for the clicking issue.,-1,1
1958,1,3,I sent the first one for an exchange and then found out about the call.,-1,1
1958,1,4,Immediately upon receiving my exhange I sent the body in for the click repair.,-1,1
1958,1,5,Approximately 10 days later I had the body back in hand and while the clicking sound was resolved there was a new sound problem that was even worse.,-1,1
1958,1,6,My revised rating and review is based off the poor experience with Sony Technical Support and the repair of the issue.I contacted Sony Service using the repair number of my Service Call repair, after receiving my "repaired" 5n and noticing the new sound issue.,-1,1
1958,1,7,A day later I received an email advising I would receive a response soon.Two days later I receive an email from a Tech stating they would overnight the body and expedite the repair.,-1,1
1958,1,8,I am excited at this point thinking I would be able to get this resolved.,-1,1
1958,1,9,I respond with information about lens used and what I have noticed as well as a link to a video that exhibits the problem.The next day notice a missed call but no voicemail.,-1,1
1958,1,10,I later find out they tried to call but I was not avialable.,-1,1
1958,1,11,I call Sony Service and reference the email about the expedited return and repair as well as my original repair #.,-1,1
1958,1,12,I am told the person that emailed me is out of the office for X amount of time and that a new Tech would contact me.,-1,1
1958,1,13,Again they do call but not when Im available, but do leave a voicemail that I should call back.,-1,1
1958,1,14,I call back and Im told that I am already in line to get a call from a Tech.,-1,1
1958,1,15,I explain that he tried to call and left a message stating I should call back.,-1,1
1958,1,16,The person again states that the Tech is already set to call me.The next day I get the call.,-1,1
1958,1,17,The tech apparently is unaware of the issue as he immediately starts explaining that Sony has a Service Notice for the clicking.,-1,1
1958,1,18,I have to explain that the camera has already been sent in for that issue and that the problem is something else.,-1,1
1958,1,19,I offer to provide links to two videos that exhibit the problem.,-1,1
1958,1,20,The Tech instructs me to hang up and respond with the links in an email he will send me.,-1,1
1958,1,21,I get the email shortly after and respond with the links to the videos.Two days later and I do not receive a phone call nor an email response.,-1,1
1958,1,22,This puts me just 4 days of my return window with Amazon closing so I am forced to return the defective camera for refund.,-1,1
1958,1,23,I simply cannot risk missing my return option to only find out later that Sony does not fix the issue with this body.PROS..Exceptional IQ >  JPegs from camera match the 7D IQ in most situations including high ISO.,-1,1
1958,1,24,The 5n seems to be a little more particular about lighting though.Features >  List of features is nice like Panoramo, HDR and other effects.Manual Modes >  Camera gives you plenty of control.CONS..Clicking Sound >  Its well documented that the 5n has a clicking sound during video recording caused by an internal part moving around.,-1,1
1958,1,25,Sony has offered a free update but even the info on their page states that  it REDUCES the noise.,-1,1
1958,1,26,Apparently the fix involves placing grease or something on the part to dampen the noise ?,-1,1
1958,1,27,This sounds temporary to me and as stated there is no guarantee it will fix the  issue completely.,-1,1
1958,1,28,This is a big CON in my opinion since HD video is a very big feature of this camera and it was marketed as such.10,-1,1
1958,1,29,FPS >  Yes this sounds like a PRO but not when you only get about 10 shots before the buffer is full.The clicking sound ruins this camera for me.,-1,1
1958,1,30,It amazes me these days how products make it through production with these issues and are not recalled (Asus Transformer Prime GPS ring a bell?).,-1,1
1959,1,0,Lets get too the point  !,-1,1
1959,1,1,Dear Friends....,-1,1
1959,1,2,I have several mirror-less cameras, this Sony and a Panasonic GF1 and a Panasonic G3....,-1,1
1959,1,3,This Sony is really a fine camera that will satisfy most of your needs... My complaints with the camera are, the LCD panel is not hinged as is the Panasonic G3, which gives you the best ability to take advantage of composing a photo and then storing the panel when not in use, to insure it remains damage free, and there is no socket to connect a external studio flash...  Sony really hit the ball out of the park with the thought and design of the focus assist features, for the user who desires to use their old 35mm camera lenses..,-1,1
1959,1,4,This camera produces a image that holds it's own with the best digital cameras out there, the user features such as focus peaking and all the lens possibilities just make this a really wonderful camera that anyone will enjoy using.,-1,1
1959,1,5,Now please Sony, just put a better hinge on the LCD panel and a PC socket, so I can use it with a studio flash, this camera really deserves a five star rating... but the lack of flash connector and the limited hinge on the LCD panel are the big failures of the camera.. ....,-1,1
1959,1,6,I own a Canon 5DMKII and this camera produces images that compare with the results I get from the big Canon... highly recommended...,-1,1
1960,1,0,Nice camera - better than expected.,-1,1
1960,1,1,This camera has turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me.,-1,1
1960,1,2,Build quality is excellent.,-1,1
1960,1,3,That wasn't a surprise.,-1,1
1960,1,4,And, I knew that it was capable of producing excellent photos.,-1,1
1960,1,5,My concerns had more to with the NEX system's lack of high quality lenses and how much I would like the mostly touch screen interface.As to the interface, that's part of the pleasant surprise.,-1,1
1960,1,6,I'm not sure that a few years ago I would have taken to it quite as well.,-1,1
1960,1,7,Thank Apple and the iPhone for educating me on the advantages and ease of screen based controls.,-1,1
1960,1,8,With a quick button push and Sony's well thought out basic controls, I can quickly get to and change the settings I most often access.,-1,1
1960,1,9,The touch focusing and focus tracking are wonderful.One other thing that surprised me is how useful the intelligent auto setting has turned out.,-1,1
1960,1,10,As someone who usually shoots in aperture priority or manual mode, I'm used to making all the exposure decisions for my photos.,-1,0
1960,1,11,Just to try the camera out, I shot an afternoon letting the camera make those decisions for me.,-1,0
1960,1,12,In normal lighting situations, it did a great job, quite consistently.,-1,0
1960,1,13,Subsequent experiments have shown me that I can actually trust the camera enough to leave it on IA for quick snapshots.,-1,0
1960,1,14,When the light gets dim, I switch back to aperture priority and control the ISO settings.,-1,0
1960,1,15,The intelligent auto setting doesn't understand tripods.Low light is another area where I've been pleased.,-1,0
1960,1,16,I normally think of most cameras special modes as marketing gimmicks, or toys that people play with for a while then forget.,-1,0
1960,1,17,The NEX's hand held night function actually works very well, allowing me to take a number of indoor photos in low light that came out great.,-1,1
1960,1,18,The hand held HDR function is also something that I'll use occasionally in high contrast lighting.My biggest problem in choosing a NEX camera has been the lack of small, light, high-quality lenses.,-1,1
1960,1,19,I'm okay with the kit lens.,-1,0
1960,1,20,It's quite good for what it is.,-1,0
1960,1,21,But it does have its limits.,-1,0
1960,1,22,Until Sigma came out with their 30mm lens for the NEX system (Sigma 30mm F2.8 EX DN- Sony E 330965), I wasn't interested in the system.,-1,0
1960,1,23,That has turned out to be a good lens that gives me some of the compact size and image quality that I felt was lacking.,-1,0
1960,1,24,It matches this small and light camera with a small and light lens that is sharp and has a decently large aperture at F/2.8.,-1,0
1960,1,25,That makes the NEX-5N into a very good street photography camera.That's a lot of rambling to say that this is a good camera for experienced photographers, within limits.,-1,0
1960,1,26,It's not a replacement for your DSLR.,-1,0
1960,1,27,It is a good street/travel camera.,-1,0
1960,1,28,Some more small prime lenses would help us a lot.,-1,0
1960,1,29,For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera.,-1,0
1960,1,30,The image quality is excellent, the controls are good, as is the touch base menu system.,-1,0
1960,1,31,And the camera has what appears to be a pretty good built in help system.P.S.,-1,0
1960,1,32,Two extras made my experience with the camera better.,-1,1
1960,1,33,I've already mentioned the Sigma 30mm lens.,-1,1
1960,1,34,There's an Arca Swiss compatible tripod plate made by SunwayFoto (check eBay) that's specifically designed for the 5N.,-1,1
1960,1,35,The quality is good.,-1,1
1960,1,36,It allows access to the battery/card bay on the camera bottom and lets the swiveling screen to work normally.,-1,1
1961,1,0,Love what it can do but not perfect.,-1,0
1961,1,1,I'm really enjoying it's strengths such as stunningly vivid daylight shots and excellent low light quality.,-1,0
1961,1,2,I have a Canon T2i and find the sharpness to be on a par with that.,-1,0
1961,1,3,Very nice to have that in a such a compact package.,-1,0
1961,1,4,The video quality is very close to my Panasonic tm700 which shoots 1080/60p and is absolutely amazingly lifelike.,-1,0
1961,1,5,The tm700 has a better stabalizer, not much, and focuses faster, again minor but noticeable.,-1,0
1961,1,6,There are effects in fully auto mode that I love.,-1,0
1961,1,7,Great fun and simple to apply.,-1,0
1961,1,8,The scenes are also very quick and useful for special conditions.Here's what I don't like.,-1,0
1961,1,9,I was taking a video of a friend and noticed that the skin tone was over saturated with red.,-1,1
1961,1,10,This was in an office with artificial lighting.,-1,1
1961,1,11,I've also noticed it at home or anywhere there's not a particularly bright light source.,-1,1
1961,1,12,The other seeming defect is that I've noticed spots in the frame when the background, also indoors, is tan/orange/yellow.,-1,1
1961,1,13,The first time I noticed it the iso was 3200.,-1,1
1961,1,14,The same shot with 800 iso had no trace of the spots.,-1,1
1961,1,15,The spots appeared several times more at iso 3200 in the exact same location in the frame and changing between 18-55 kit lens and f2.8/16 didn't effect the outcome.,-1,1
1961,1,16,I also noticed the same exact spots when is happened to use iso 100 and 1 second shutter speed.,-1,1
1961,1,17,This could be just my camera, I don't know of course.,-1,1
1961,1,18,I've just noticed it.,-1,1
1961,1,19,It's not dust.I will post any updates.,-1,1
1961,1,20,I've not yet contacted Sony customer service but will.as of 3/20/2012I've upgraded the firmware to 1.01, verified it, and retaken some shots of tan walls to see if spots persisted and they do.,-1,1
1961,1,21,This is still a superb camera and I don't hesitate to use it in any lighting situation.,-1,1
1961,1,22,Five stars if for perfect though so that stays but disappointed is overstating it.Thanks for the response on the firmware update.,-1,1
1961,1,23,I feel better having done that.,-1,1
1961,1,24,The spots still quite possibly could be removed with a thorough cleaning.,-1,1
1961,1,25,I used the setup cleaning mode to no effect and I've only used it in pristine condition and for only a month so we'll see.as of 3/30/2012I purchased a cleaning kit for the sensor and was able after 20 or so passes with the various pads and wipes to remove all the spots.,-1,1
1961,1,26,It's a bit unnerving because you think, at least a novice like myself, that too hard and you'll destroy the filter or sensor, not enough and it'll never be perfect.,-1,1
1961,1,27,I do not for the life of me know how such indelible stains, not dust, got on there.,-1,0
1961,1,28,I only changed lenses indoors.,-1,0
1961,1,29,I'll continue to monitor it and see if this mirrorless type of camera just attracts debris more readily.Other than that it's been a great camera.,-1,0
1961,1,30,The images and video are stunning.as of 4/1/2012New spots have appeared on the sensor.,-1,1
1961,1,31,They show up noticeably on sky blue background.,-1,1
1961,1,32,I change lenses infrequently and only indoors so every few days cleaning is not an option.,-1,1
1961,1,33,I can't return the camera but I will return the 18-200 lens.,-1,1
1961,1,34,Just not worth it given the delicate and dangerous job of cleaning the sensor.as of 4/5/2012Amazon kindly sent me a replacement for which I'm grateful as I was beyond the 30 day window.,-1,1
1961,1,35,I unboxed it, attached a lens and tried the 2 settings (iso 3200 on a light background and then 1 second exposure on blue sky) that revealed the sensor spots I've had an issue with and similar spots appeared on this camera too.,-1,1
1961,1,36,Right out of the box.,-1,1
1961,1,37,As far as I can see I'm the only one complaining and I still gravitate to this camera every day.,-1,1
1961,1,38,Love the images and the size.,-1,1
1961,1,39,There are no visible spots or dust under iso 3200 and faster than 1 second.,-1,1
1961,1,40,I can live with that.,-1,1
1962,1,0,Takes beautiful pictures but.................,-1,0
1962,1,1,I purchased this camera because of the comparisons made with other cameras on dpreview.,-1,0
1962,1,2,According to their comparison analyses, it produced better images than almost every other camera they tested.,-1,0
1962,1,3,My personal experience with the camera confirmed this.,-1,0
1962,1,4,The high ISO images were practically noiseless,crisp and clear and better than any other camera I have ever used.Unfortunately, the menu system needs a lot of help.,-1,0
1962,1,5,It is long, complicated (for me at least) and difficult to read with my tired old eyes.,-1,1
1962,1,6,There is a provision for making them larger but only minimally.The camera is very small but still not pocketable so I wonder where the advantage of size is supposed to be.I missed the long zoom of my point and shoot.The LCD is only partially articulated and not nearly as convenient as one that swings out to the side and allows for self portraits.,-1,1
1962,1,7,No self portraits here.The screen brightness is pretty dim in sunlight unless you opt for a "sunny weather" setting which then becomes way too bright when you are inside.,-1,1
1962,1,8,A view finder, which is lacking, would be a great help.The stabilization is not as good as on the Panasonic FZ150 and I find that with the Sony, my videos are pretty "wobbly.",-1,1
1962,1,9,I did not hear any "clicking" on the videos with this particular unit.The specs say the battery should last for 400+ shots.,-1,1
1962,1,10,I found this was not the case.,-1,1
1962,1,11,I fiddled with the menus and took about 100 pictures and the battery retained less than about 30% of capacity.All in all, I was sorely tempted to keep this camera only for the superb images it produced but it would be silly for me to have one camera for "good" pictures and another camera for "features.",-1,0
1962,1,12,I may as well lug around a DSLR with two lenses, which defeats the purpose of having a single camera to carry around.,-1,1
1962,1,13,I am not a photographer, just a picture taker who appreciates good image quality.,-1,1
1962,1,14,I have never printed anything larger than an 8x10 so poster sized images are of no concern for me.The NEX 5N is a terrific camera that needs to be just a little bigger with a view finder and a menu system that is a lot better and more easily readable regarding font size.,-1,0
1962,1,15,I still give this camera four stars because of the superb image quality.I want a camera with the same image quality as the NEX 5N; a little bigger with a longer zoom, excellent stabilization a good, sharp LCD screen, a good view finder and a menu system that is clear, user friendly and easy to read.,-1,0
1963,1,0,Excellent camera for the price.,-1,0
1963,1,1,I expect that everyone who is in the market for APS-C or similar compact cameras has already read multiple reviews on this camera.,-1,1
1963,1,2,I have shot over 3,000 photos with this camera and in a nutshell, the photos are excellent quality, comparable to a DSLR with the same sensor; the compact body makes the camera easy to carry and a bit more discreet than a DSLR for candid shots; the lens does very good motion stabilization; movie video quality is excellent (I haven't played the audio back yet through good speakers, so I can't vouch for that); low-light sensitivity is excellent; the battery holds a charge well even with heavy use; but the controls tend to be awkward, which is why this gets only 4 stars.,-1,1
1963,1,3,The newest replacements in the NEX line are much more intuitive but at a huge bump in price.,-1,1
1963,1,4,I also found that the flash unit tends to hang up on the door over the hot shoe which makes it difficult to install in dim light, which of course is when one needs the flash, but this is a minor quibble.,-1,1
1963,1,5,All in all an excellent camera for the price, but if spending a few hundred more (OK, several hundred more) for a camera doesn't bother you I would consider the NEX-7.,-1,1
1964,1,0,Almost Great.,-1,1
1964,1,1,The Sony NEX-5r has just come out and the price on this camera, the 5n, has dropped to around $500.,-1,1
1964,1,2,After doing a fair amount of research, I decided to buy the 5n due to a variety of stellar reviews and the hard to beat new price.,-1,1
1964,1,3,I recently went on a two week vacation in Europe and used both this camera and my previous camera, a Lumix Lx3.THE GOOD:WOW.,-1,0
1964,1,4,The image quality of the 5n is amazing.,-1,0
1964,1,5,The color saturation is incredible even at high ISOs.,-1,0
1964,1,6,And the metering is fairly spot on in most situations.,-1,0
1964,1,7,It handles complex lighting situations very well, generally getting a well balanced exposure.,-1,0
1964,1,8,For instance, a standard outdoor shot will show great color and detail throughout the image, from the pavement to the sky.,-1,1
1964,1,9,The Lx3 on the other hand, will only be able to handle one or the other, with the sky being blown out in most situations (keep in mind the Lx3 has a much smaller sensor and is from 2008; still, it is a very good camera at iso100).,-1,1
1964,1,10,Contrast is also excellent and objects in the foreground feel closer than objects in the background.,-1,1
1964,1,11,In comparison, the Lx3 tends to feel a bit flat overall.ISO is usable up to 6400, after which it gets chunky and crummy.,-1,1
1964,1,12,Still, you can get great shots at extremely low light with amazing color that was just not possible at this price range until now.The kit lens is good and much better than I expected based upon some of the reviews I read.,-1,0
1964,1,13,Still, in this regard the Lx3 is better.,-1,0
1964,1,14,The Lx3 is just a little bit sharper and that makes a difference.,-1,0
1964,1,15,Also, I found that I didn't like the distortion on the widest setting with the 5n and much prefer the Lx3's widest setting.,-1,0
1964,1,16,In addition, the kit lens is pretty slow.,-1,0
1964,1,17,Still, it is a good quality lens that I am happy using, though at a higher price point (5r, natch) I might grumble more about the slowness/sharpness.I found the grip on the camera and the general feel to be good and had no problems in this area.The screen is pretty good in bright light.,-1,0
1964,1,18,Not great, but pretty good.,-1,0
1964,1,19,And the fact that it moves aprox.,-1,0
1964,1,20,90 degrees up is a godsend for a variety of situations.THE NEUTRAL:The menu system takes a bit of getting used to, but once learned, is fairly easy to navigate.,-1,0
1964,1,21,I found using the manual controls more intuitive than the touch controls, but to each his own.The size of the camera with the kit lens verges on being too big, but manages to still feel compact enough.,-1,1
1964,1,22,My wife was able to fit the camera into a fairly small purse.,-1,1
1964,1,23,Also, it is very light in weight which helps.The color accuracy is very good.,-1,0
1964,1,24,The camera captures what you see very well.,-1,0
1964,1,25,However, when I look online at some shot comparisons of an outdoor scene with one of the Olympus PENs (don't remember if it was the 2 or the 3) the Olympus just looked better, though it was clear that the Olympus was not color accurate.,-1,0
1964,1,26,On the other hand, the PEN series seems to have horrible grain at higher ISOs, so this immediately took the PEN out of the running for me.,-1,0
1964,1,27,Anyway, I haven't tried any of the other color settings on the 5n, so this is more of a thinking-out-loud comment than any real statement.,-1,0
1964,1,28,In general, I think color accuracy wins the day.THE BAD:Ugh.,-1,0
1964,1,29,And this takes a lot of getting used to.,-1,0
1964,1,30,I'd wager that a good 20% of shots will be missed by anyone using this camera until they learn how to compensate for this issue by using a higher ISO than should be needed or using the shutter priority setting or whatever else.,-1,0
1964,1,31,Major whiff on the part of Sony and basically keeps this camera from being truly great.,-1,0
1964,1,32,There are pictures that you'll take that you will think are in focus by viewing the monitor that will be ruined by motion blur upon viewing on your home computer.,-1,1
1964,1,33,Basically, until you learn how to compensate for the lack of anti-shake, it is a must to zoom into the photo to ensure that it isn't blurry (on the playback screen).,-1,1
1964,1,34,In a dark setting, I can take a photo with the Lx3 at 1/15 with little worry of motion blur.,-1,1
1964,1,35,But with the Sony it a crap-shoot.The shutter is extremely loud.The camera takes a bit too long to start up.,-1,1
1964,1,36,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.,-1,1
1964,1,37,And it is especially bad in low light, even though the red light emanating from the camera is extremely bright.If you order the black 5n, the lens that comes with it will be silver and not black to match the body.I didn't really use the flash, so no word on its function.,-1,1
1964,1,38,But the color of the flash is a sort of grey-silver, and it doesn't match the silver on the lens.,-1,1
1964,1,39,So if you care about the aesthetics of a thing, then a black body with a silver lens with a grey flash starts to look a bit like Frankenstein's monster.Camera strap is adequate but a bit on the cheap side.No camera case is included.The menu system and camera controls are not very intuitive.,-1,1
1964,1,40,I've read that they are much better with the newer 5r.,-1,1
1964,1,41,But in comparison to the Lumix, where you can switch aspect ratios manually, switch shooting modes manually, and in general access everything you want a little easier, the Sony really loses in this area.It is somehow easy to accidentally adjust the settings on the camera to under-expose (exposure compensation).,-1,0
1964,1,42,I was never able to figure out how I was doing this, but it happened enough times that I started to learn to check the exposure compensation setting if my pictures looked like they came out too dark in a light setting that should have been fine.,-1,0
1965,1,0,Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012.,-1,1
1965,1,1,I bought my NEX-5N from Amazon and it arrived promptly on 10/17/2012.,-1,1
1965,1,2,I've been reading the reviews so one of the first things I tried was the video!,-1,1
1965,1,3,And I am sad to say but I too am a victim of the clicking noises.,-1,1
1965,1,4,However, I will admit that it takes great pictures.,-1,1
1965,1,5,I am returning and trying my luck with a second one...,-1,1
1965,1,6,I give Sony 2 stars for continuing to sell these bad batches and also for letting this type of basic usability issue pass their QC process.UPDATE - Amazon delivered my replacement NEX-5N on 10/19/2012 but that too was clicking.,-1,1
1965,1,7,So when I asked for a 3rd replacement they said the policy is 2 tries then refund so I'll be returning both after all.,-1,1
1965,1,8,Sony is currently selling this camera for 499 plus tax (no where near as good as the current Amazon price) but I'll try my luck there since I do like the camera.P.S.,-1,1
1965,1,9,I was at my local Best Buy yesterday and held one of their demo's to my ear and shook it a bit and clearly heard the rattling noise so I guess there's a lot of these bad ones out there:(.Final UPDATE 10/24/2012 - I came home with my 3rd NEX-5N, this time from the SONY store and it had the same clicking issue!!,-1,1
1965,1,10,I tried all three side by side and realized my first one from Amazon clicked considerably less than the other two (though obviously not perfect since it put me through all this adventure).So based on my personal experience temporarily owning 3 NEX-5Ns AND playing with one at Best Buy, I hesitate to believe that there are actually models out there with zero video recording issues.,-1,1
1965,1,11,My conclusion is that the noise is likely not as pronounced in some models or some buyers may not be as concerned because they love the good quality pics it takes.I myself am leaning more towards keeping the 1st NEX-5N from Amazon since the camera seems to work well and I likely won't record videos as much.,-1,1
1965,1,12,I have a few more days to make up my mind before having to ship back for refund.,-1,1
1966,1,0,Pretty sweet camera.,-1,0
1966,1,1,There is no camera in the world that's perfect, so I can certainly find some negatives.,-1,0
1966,1,2,I used this for well over year now, a lot, and I think it's great.,-1,0
1966,1,3,Aside from being real nitpicky, the one thing I wish it had is internal image stabilization.,-1,1
1966,1,4,It's very strongest plus is the high ISO image quality.,-1,1
1966,1,5,I've taken inside shots at night with minimal ambient light, handheld with no flash at ISO setting 25,600 and they turned out very clear with minimal graininess.,-1,1
1966,1,6,and plug this camera in on the ISO comparisons and you'll see what I mean.,-1,1
1966,1,7,Compare it to your best Canon DSLR and see who wins.,-1,0
1966,1,8,A very portable camera with very impressive results.,-1,0
1967,1,0,A good camera with a few flaws.,-1,0
1967,1,1,I got this camera for a 6 month trip; I have a DSLR but didn't want to lug everything around.,-1,0
1967,1,2,I am not a pro photographer by any means.,-1,0
1967,1,3,I do like to think of myself as an armature, and I am trying to learn more photography so I chose this camera to go with me.Pro: I live the small size of the body (not the lens--more on that later); I like that I can have either full control in manual vs other modes.,-1,0
1967,1,4,Plus, even in the program mode or intelligent auto you can make adjustments to the picture (you can adjust shutter speed by telling the thumb wheel).,-1,1
1967,1,5,It has HDR if you are into that sort of thing.,-1,1
1967,1,6,Very small lag on the shutter.,-1,1
1967,1,7,Battery lasts for a while.,-1,1
1967,1,8,I like that you can adjust the screen for above/below views.,-1,1
1967,1,9,Good job at high ISO (low light).Con:,-1,1
1967,1,10,Not exactly portable/pocket with the kit lens attached--you may have to get the 16mm pancake lens.,-1,1
1967,1,11,The panoramic setting is a little finicky.,-1,1
1967,1,12,Changing some of the settings involves diving into menus (ISO, HDR, etc).,-1,1
1967,1,13,No auto ISR on Manual mode (some DSLR's will let you do this).Overall,,-1,1
1967,1,14,I will not ditch my DSLR for it--but I will give it to my wife once I am done with the trip so she has a camera.,-1,1
1967,1,15,That way I can still grab it when I want to drop the gear.,-1,1
1967,1,16,Would I say must buy?,-1,1
1967,1,17,No, but I enjoy this camera and it gets a solid 4 stars.,-1,1
1968,1,0,Solid Camera at Great Price.,-1,1
1968,1,1,The Sony NEX-5N must be the best camera value at the moment at these closeout prices.,-1,1
1968,1,2,You get an APS-C sensor with the ability to not only use lenses designed for the NEX platform, but also nearly any "legacy" glass via an aftermarket adapter.,-1,0
1968,1,3,Not only that, but this camera (and some other NEX models) have focus-peaking.,-1,0
1968,1,4,This makes manually focusing a lens a breeze and very quick, not to mention fun.,-1,0
1968,1,5,It's almost a return to cameras of the past with their split-screen viewfinders and MF-only lenses.,-1,0
1968,1,6,You can put the focus precisely where you want it, which is great when shooting wide-open.,-1,0
1968,1,7,The only big downside to this body is the lack of a true hot shoe (the new NEX-6 addressed this).,-1,1
1968,1,8,You can buy third-party adapters, but those look a little unstable for mounting a big flash unit to the camera.,-1,1
1968,1,9,Sony does sell a larger flash compatible with the NEX-3 and -5 series, which is quite a bit bigger than the included kit flash.,-1,1
1968,1,10,Other than that you are stuck to either trying to utilize a hot shoe adapter + radio trigger, an external slave flash in manual mode and triggered optically (think Nikon SU-4), or else some sort of home-brew setup.,-1,0
1968,1,11,Still, the flash quirk aside, this is a great camera for traveling or walking around.,-1,0
1968,1,12,You get the image quality and dynamic range of a dSLR paired with a camera you can take nearly anywhere.,-1,0
1969,1,0,New Photographer.,-1,1
1969,1,1,I've been a point and shoot girl up til now but I decided to buy the Sony to start getting more into photography.,-1,1
1969,1,2,(Due to where I live I couldn't buy it on Amazon and get it shipped to me when I needed it by.)I've,-1,1
1969,1,3,only just started using it as I got it 2.5 days ago.,-1,1
1969,1,4,It takes amazingly clear action shots.,-1,0
1969,1,5,That feature and the ability to filter black and white with color selection were some of the reasons I bought it.,-1,0
1969,1,6,The zoom is okay but I don't have much to compare it to.,-1,0
1969,1,7,I haven't used it for video yet so I can't comment on that.,-1,0
1969,1,8,It's lightweight, touchscreen is there but I can use the buttons on the side too which is a HUGE plus for me.,-1,1
1969,1,9,I hate being forced into nothing but touchscreen, I like the buttons most times on devices that aren't phones.,-1,1
1969,1,10,So far the rest of the "pros" are it's easy to use- it has an onscreen information blurb that comes up when you select something; it allows for automatic or manual functionality.,-1,0
1969,1,11,So after I learn more about cameras and how to use manual speeds or adjustments I can but as a beginner I don't need a special class the camera just does it for me; even when my hand or the subject is moving all of the pics don't come out blurry; all of the options and possible future upgrades so I won't have to buy a whole new camera, this one can grow with me as my knowledge grows.,-1,1
1969,1,12,Also, I can change a lot of the settings that on regular point and shoots I couldn't change i.e. how long the picture review stays on.,-1,1
1969,1,13,The ability to control the focus or focus area is also pretty awesome.My cons are relatively superfluous....I wish it wasn't black as I'm partial to blue or green or silver electronics.,-1,0
1969,1,14,That has no bearing on the camera's performance, obviously.,-1,0
1969,1,15,As for camera performance, unless I can figure it out soon, if I take a picture vertically when I go back to look through them it just shows up smaller but vertical.,-1,0
1969,1,16,I can't figure how to get it to show up the same size as it was when I took it.,-1,0
1969,1,17,That's just a small irk though.Hopefully this helps if you're a photography novice like I am.,-1,0
1969,1,18,This probably isn't too helpful to someone with a large knowledge base but....I enjoy the camera, I'd recommend it to someone else looking for a camera.,-1,0
1969,1,19,If I can use it effectively (and all my pics have come out GREAT I must say) then most anyone could.,-1,0
1970,1,0,Nice image quality; poor autofocus.,-1,0
1970,1,1,I bought this camera about a year and a half ago.,-1,0
1970,1,2,It was my first step up from a point-and-shoot and, as such, was a real eye opener.,-1,1
1970,1,3,I was quite excited about what was possible with the larger sensor size and flexibility in a "real" camera.,-1,1
1970,1,4,In time its shortcomings (primarily slow repeat shooting and poor autofocus) came to really bug me and I've moved on to better cameras.,-1,1
1970,1,5,Autofocusing is so bad that I sent it to Sony for repair at the suggestion of their online technicians, but they returned it with "no trouble found.",-1,1
1970,1,6,Often (frustratingly often) when I would place an object (say a face or a bird) in the spot focus rectangle and half-press the shutter release the Sony would focus on the background, even if the desired object completely filled the focus rectangle.,-1,1
1970,1,7,For further discussion with image examples, go to community.sony.com,-1,1
1970,1,8,and search for "NEX-5N 18-55mm E-mount Autofocus issues".,-1,1
1971,1,0,Sony 2-, Amazon 5+ I have mixed thoughts about this camera.,-1,1
1971,1,1,I love the design and features.,-1,0
1971,1,2,It makes a great travel camera.,-1,0
1971,1,3,But Sony evidently has serious quality control problems.,-1,1
1971,1,4,I bought the first one just before a trip to Japan, and during the first week of the trip it just died for no apparent reason.,-1,1
1971,1,5,My 30 day return period would have expired by the time I returned to the USA, but I chatted online with Amazon support and they arranged for an extension of the return period until I got home.,-1,1
1971,1,6,Still, I had to go out an buy another camera in Japan with a very unfavorable dollar/yen exchange rate.,-1,1
1971,1,7,When I got back home, I decided to just get a replacement from Amazon, because I still liked the camera design and was hoping that I just had a lemon.,-1,1
1971,1,8,However, after using the second camera lightly over the Christmas holidays, I noticed that when I took pictures of subjects against a clear sky, there were spots in the picture that always appeared in the same position.,-1,1
1971,1,9,The spots were more definite when the lens I was using was stopped down below f10.,-1,0
1971,1,10,I cleaned the lens and sensor, but the spots remained.,-1,0
1971,1,11,I changed lenses, but the spots remained.,-1,0
1971,1,12,Finally I contacted Sony support and they told me that the camera had to be sent in for repair.,-1,1
1971,1,13,It was January 30, and I had one more day before Amazon's extended return period for the holidays ended.,-1,1
1971,1,14,I wasn't going to deal with the NEX-5n any more, so I returned it for a refund.,-1,1
1971,1,15,Amazon initially made a mistake about the refund and deducted a restocking fee.,-1,1
1971,1,16,When I pointed out that the return was within their extended holiday return period, they gave me a credit for the restocking fee plus $50 for "good will.",-1,1
1971,1,17,You can bet that when I buy another camera, it will be from Amazon.,-1,1
1972,1,0,Big Step up from P&S; This is my first mirror-less camera.,-1,1
1972,1,1,I upgraded from a super-zoom (lumix fz35).,-1,1
1972,1,2,The images are superb, the start up time and shooting speed are fast!,-1,1
1972,1,3,I was skeptical about loosing some physical controls , such as the PASM dial and quick dial that the fz35 had, but once you get your way around and setup the soft buttons for easy access, I don't really miss the the fz35 anymore.I was trying to decide between this or the canon t3i as well as the d5100 but they are too bulky.,-1,1
1972,1,4,I wanted something smaller that I can take anywhere.,-1,1
1972,1,5,So far this camera delivers.The cons will be that there are not many lenses available and they are steep in price.,-1,1
1972,1,6,Also the screen is susceptible to scratches.,-1,1
1972,1,7,I recommend getting a screen protector.,-1,1
1973,1,0,Now I take it with me Not leave in house.,-1,1
1973,1,1,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.,-1,1
1973,1,2,I also have a Canon G11 (which I love)This is a great in between a DSLR and a POcket cam.,-1,1
1973,1,3,Much lighter and smaller than a DSLR.,-1,1
1973,1,4,Only took 250 shots so far.,-1,1
1973,1,5,The touchsceen is nice and the Auto mode is excellent.I have the kit lens and the 55-210.,-1,1
1973,1,6,Both very nice.,-1,1
1973,1,7,If you wnat a small package and great quality this is it.,-1,1
1974,1,0,007'S DSLR/ILC.,-1,1
1974,1,1,Super sexy design first off...In silver, this piece of art is like a spy camera symphony, which becomes visually deafening with the additional flash and view finder attached.In my hand the camera is super small w/o a lens.,-1,1
1974,1,2,Its like holding a PS3 controller.,-1,1
1974,1,3,Feels as if its made out of the same plastic too.,-1,1
1974,1,4,Super easy to handle, and maneuver with.,-1,1
1974,1,5,Fun to use.,-1,0
1974,1,6,Very balanced.The moveable rear LCD is awesome for all photographers, but a gift for professionals.,-1,0
1974,1,7,Can be scratched easily as with all this new touch screen tech out here.,-1,0
1974,1,8,Very responsive and neat.I dont know why so many people complain about the UI its SO EASY!!!,-1,1
1974,1,9,I didnt even get a users manual with mine and it only took me 20minutes to go through all the menus and adjust settings to my liking.,-1,1
1974,1,10,Although I do have some previous knoweledge and experience with DSLR cameras both digital and film.,-1,1
1974,1,11,The UI does seem pretty limited to me though, and i would have really really liked to have had an on-board cropper for this price range.The on-board effects are awesome although again pretty limited for this price range, this thing can take some stunning B/W photos.The AF is pretty spot on though its illuminator has the potential to be blocked by your finger if you are not paying attention, due to the styling of the body.With an ISO of 25600 and flash you have no worries about low light photos, i dont see why you couldnt take a superior photo in low light, with some skill and imagination..This camera is a pretty quick shot, not as fast as the NIKON J1 and V1 both of which are praised for thier speed advantages over the NEX series but it keeps up just fine.,-1,1
1974,1,12,Continuous burst shots comes in a well paced quick succession.The large Sensor gives off some beautifully clear and vibrant colorful shots.,-1,1
1974,1,13,With 16.2 MP the photos should print very nicely considering you use the right type of paper and printer.The HD Video, WHOA!! its super crisp and smooth, and lets get serious, not intended to shoot feature films on.,-1,0
1974,1,14,Possibly small ones.Battery life is pretty weak.,-1,1
1974,1,15,If your battery is at 100% after about two minutes of any type of use with the camera it wil be down to 98%.Will last probably eight hours if you went out shooting all day, and made sure to turn it off when not in use.I've heard all the stories about these cameras clicking and overheating during recording a movie and almost didnt buy one because of, but ive not had any problem of the sort, but then again my longest short film is 3:00.I dont like the fact that the flash and viewfinder cannot be used in tandem.,-1,1
1974,1,16,The fact that they are small and sort of fragile and toy like makes me hope for a long and everlasting future of digital photography joy with them.,-1,1
1974,1,17,Although, this is a non issue for me because I bought a Case Logic SLRC-205 DSLR bag to go with my NEX5N.,-1,1
1974,1,18,Perfect bag by the way for any DSLR camera and its parts.I love the overall sleekness and kitsch factor.,-1,1
1974,1,19,I understand why SONY didnt include the viewfinder and flash even though it seems like backwards economy, they made this camera and kind of left it in the middle for all types of photographers to be baited to from the family shooter to the professionl on the move.SONY sort of marketed the NEX series in the likes of companies like APPLE with their consistently upgradeable products.Thats what i love about the way the executed it.,-1,1
1974,1,20,The NEX5N is basically what you make it, and it can be a admirable little brother when compared to the NEX-7.When you buy the core NEX bundle and you have an awesome point and shooter with DSLR capabilities via the interchangeable lenes.,-1,1
1974,1,21,So there, they have satisfied the P&S; crowd of mom, dads, and occasional shooters who only use thier cameras on vacation.If you are a hobbyist or professional photog, you have the choice of buying the viewfinder and flash and different lenses making this little thing a pretty formidable choice for the compact DSLR market.It goes both ways on the ILC/DSLR front.SONY is trying to make everyone happy on this one.,-1,1
1974,1,22,Smart move.I say buy it, I was on the fence about this camera for about three months of debating wheter to spend the money or buy the Nikon V1 (which i still will buy good camera) or wait until they get cheaper, which is already happening.,-1,1
1974,1,23,Glad i bought it.I paid $623 on EBAY and mine came with a 18/55MM Lens, flash, a small SONY tote bag, 4GB SD Card, and charger/battery.,-1,1
1974,1,24,A STEAL!!Buy it, get yourself a lens hood, some lens filters, the new holga effect lenses, or the awesome sony lenses, a 4G SD card (takes up to 800 shots all you need trust me), a carrying case for it (recommend Case Logic SLRC-205), the flash, and the viewfinder if you feel you'll need them.Cant be used with photoshop out of the box, but check the web, there are downloads to get around that type of thing.,-1,1
1975,1,0,Great cam for taking videos and having always around.,-1,0
1975,1,1,Some flaws too ... Well first and foremost it's a very nice camera.,-1,0
1975,1,2,Well built and nicely designed.,-1,0
1975,1,3,It also takes great pics and especially videos.But there are also a couple of flaws which spoil the overall experience.1.,-1,0
1975,1,4,The most important for me is that it does not have a mode that in I can shoot in RAW while having a minimum shutter of at least, say, 1/125s for shooting my kids activities.,-1,1
1975,1,5,(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.,-1,1
1975,1,6,I can set the aperture to the minimum with Auto ISO but then the camera will favor something like 1/60s.),-1,1
1975,1,7,On top of that the camera has no AutoISO in full manual mode and AutoISO is limited to 100-3200.On a DSLR this is less of a problem since it's very quick to switch between A/S modes when the lighting changes.,-1,1
1975,1,8,On this camera this requires using 3 additional steps.,-1,1
1975,1,9,In general controls are not very convenient and are easily messed up by accidental presses.2.,-1,1
1975,1,10,The video clicking issue is of course very annoying and is very obvious even when using the camera very smoothly and carefully.,-1,1
1975,1,11,Right now I try to take videos with an external mic so it's less of an issue.,-1,1
1975,1,12,Hopefully I'll get myself to send the camera to Sony and get it fixed.3.,-1,1
1975,1,13,Attaching/swapping a mic or a flash requires quite long and annoying process.4.,-1,1
1975,1,14,AF also appears to be too slow for taking pics of action.Overall given it's compactness I think it's great: it's just nowhere close to a decent DSLR for shooting pics of moving kids.,-1,0
1975,1,15,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.,-1,1
1975,1,16,So I use it mostly for videos or when too lazy to bring a DSLR.Finally if you're used to Canon cameras be prepared to be confused by the reversed zoom-in/zoom-out rotation direction on the kit lens.,-1,1
1976,1,0,Great little camera.,-1,0
1976,1,1,I am old style and like a camera I can shoot in manual easily.,-1,0
1976,1,2,The new firmware upgrade makes the Nex series much easier to navagate.,-1,0
1976,1,3,I started with the Nex 3, upgraded to the 5 and now have a 7 pre ordered.,-1,0
1976,1,4,DXO marks are close to the M9.,-1,0
1976,1,5,The 5 is a wonderful little camera and what makes it a winner for me is the amazing image quality.,-1,0
1976,1,6,Low noise at high iso as well.,-1,0
1976,1,7,It focuses fast enough though there has been a time or two af has failed me.,-1,0
1976,1,8,It is a quirky camera but the more you use it and get use to it the more you will love it.,-1,0
1976,1,9,It has a great lcd screen and the best of any of the mirrorless cameras I have tried.,-1,0
1976,1,10,Nice in bright light and the tilt feature helps even more.Focus peaking makes it easier to manual focus.,-1,0
1976,1,11,I manual focus when I do landscape work and it makes it easy to use my M mount lenses.Cons would be.,-1,0
1976,1,12,Non traditional hot shoe so I can't fire a wireless flash, quirky navagation, can't focus well in extreme low light, noisy shutter and self timer, dail on the back is easy to nudge a knock your settings off.Pros, amazing image quality and almost no noise up to and including 6400iso.,-1,0
1976,1,13,Fun to use.,-1,0
1977,1,0,Excellent camera but far from perfect - I wouldn't use 42photo.com,-1,0
1977,1,1,BACKGROUND & RESEARCHI've owned Pentax, Nikon and Panasonic P&S; cameras and a Canon DSLR.,-1,0
1977,1,2,These cameras served their purpose, but all were ditched except the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5 because of its 10x zoom, IQ, ease of use and convenience vs. a big DSLR.Fast forward 2-3 years...The TZ5 went on many adventures, had been dropped more than a few times (never by me of course) and AF performance suffered.,-1,0
1977,1,3,I started researching P&S;, Extended Zoom, Mirrorless and DSLR cameras and eventually narrowed it down to the Panasonic DMC-FZ200, Pentax K-30, Sony Alpha A57 and the Sony NEX-5N.,-1,0
1977,1,4,My lust for a DSLR grew less and less with my research on mirrorless cameras because I began to love the thought of a small, compact camera system (with removable lenses).,-1,0
1977,1,5,Also, I needed (wanted) IQ that could rival most DSLR cameras and put any P&S; to shame.My decision was based on about two weeks of solid research where I referenced many websites including dpreview.com,,-1,0
1977,1,6,suggest you reference these sites, watch demonstrations on YouTube and check out sample images (just do a google search and I'm sure you will find some).BODY vs. KITOnce I knew the NEX-5N was the right camera for me, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to purchase the body only due to the limited selection of Sony E-Mount lenses and I liked that I could easily upgrade to a Sony DSLR if I wanted.,-1,1
1977,1,7,I couldn't justify spending the money on the E-Mount lenses because it offered absolutely no flexibility or deviation from the E-Mount line.,-1,1
1977,1,8,Another reason that made my purchase of the LA-EA2 adapter super easy was the lack of positive professional reviews on the E-Mount lenses.,-1,1
1977,1,9,Yes, these lenses would probably be good for the average user, but I am far from the average user and want the best for my budget.Note: A-Mount lenses will only work with the NEX-5N if the Sony LA-EA1 ($140) or LA-EA2 ($275) adapter is used.LENSESEven though the selection of E-Mount lenses is limited, a wide variety of focal lengths are covered.,-1,1
1977,1,10,As of this review, the following are the available E-Mount lenses for purchase:16mm (SEL16F28); 24mm Zeiss (SEL25F18Z); 30mm Macro (SEL30M35; 50mm (SEL50F18); 18-55mm (SEL1855); 55-210mm (SEL55210); 18-200mm (SEL18200 & SEL18200LE); Sigma 19mm (400965); Sigma 30mm (330965); Tamron 18-200mm (AFB011-700 & AFB011S-700); Kenko 400mm (KE4008K4); Various fisheye lenses from Bower, Rokinon, Samyang, YasuharaSony is scheduled to release the following lenses within the next few months: 35mm (SEL35F18); 10-18mm (SEL1018); 16-50mm (SELP1650)My plan was to purchase the Sony 16-50mm (SAL1650) and the Sony 55-200mm (SAL55200-2) lenses, but the only problem was the 16-50mm lens is $800 new and the used ones on eBay were not offered by reputable sellers (BTW, the 55-200mm was going to be a temporary lens until I saved enough money for a Sony 70-300mm or 70-400mm G lens).Since the purchase of the 16-50mm lens, 55-200mm lens and LA-EA2 adapter would have set me back well over $1,000 I decided to do some more research for alternative lenses and ended up purchasing the Tamron 17-50mm (AF016M700) and the Tamron 70-300 (AFA005S-700).At first, I could not confirm that these lenses would work with the adapter, but was able to locate examples of people who had successfully paired these lenses with the adapter and NEX-5N camera.Also, at the time of purchase, Tamron offered a $75 MIR on the 17-50mm lens and a $100 MIR on the 70-300mm lens.,-1,1
1977,1,11,Both Tamron lenses cost less than the Sony 16-50mm lens and according to the reviews the difference in IQ, CA, distortion and vignetting was negligible!,-1,1
1977,1,12,Awesome.,-1,1
1977,1,13,Oh, I almost forgot to mention that the Tamron lenses (if purchased from an authorized seller) have a 6 year warranty...not that you would ever need to collect on this, but Sony's 1 year warranty is a pathetic attempt at best.ORDERI ordered the NEX-5N (body only) from 42photo.com because they had the best price and what I thought was a decent track record.,-1,1
1977,1,14,The only thing I did not like about the ordering experience is a representative called shortly after I placed my order online to try and sell an extra off-brand battery and memory card.,-1,0
1977,1,15,I find this to be terrible practice and hate being pestered when all I want is to receive my product quickly so I can begin enjoying it.The product arrived within a few days of ordering (as expected).,-1,1
1977,1,16,I was a little surprised to see that the product box I received was for a NEX-5N with a double lens kit (16mm & 18-55mm).,-1,1
1977,1,17,I was under the impression that the NEX-5N body only was offered from Sony in its respectable box and not one that was separated from the kit lenses.,-1,1
1977,1,18,The separation of these items concerned me because that meant someone had their grubby hands on my product/in the box and the camera was placed loosely at best in the box with no additional padding or protection.,-1,1
1977,1,19,I just hoped the camera was brand new and there weren't any accessories missing.It turns out that the camera appears to be brand new as there were no signs of use, no fingerprints or smudges and no scratches or dents.,-1,1
1977,1,20,The following items were included along with the camera: warranty card, paper manual for the NEX-3/NEX-3C/NEX-5/NEX-5C, software disk, neck strap, usb cable, battery and charger and flash accessory with its respectable case.FIRST IMPRESSIONSI knew this camera was going to be small and compact, but when I took it out of its protective bag, it was even smaller than I anticipated.,-1,1
1977,1,21,Without a lens attached, this camera was no bigger than an average sized P&S; and was as light as a feather.,-1,1
1977,1,22,The small size isn't a bad thing for me because I have medium sized hands and the camera was reasonably easy to grip with my right hand.A really nice feature of this camera is the tilt-able touch-screen.,-1,1
1977,1,23,It flips up and out away from the camera body so you can hold it at waist or chest height or above your head and still have a perfect view of the screen (45 degrees down/80 degrees up).,-1,1
1977,1,24,I was hoping this one would flip all the way up so you could take self portraits, but it doesn't.,-1,1
1977,1,25,I must have mistaken this feature from some other camera I was researching.At this time, the only real negative I can find is the battery door.,-1,1
1977,1,26,It's not a big deal, but I noticed that it will move ever so slightly with very little effort.,-1,1
1977,1,27,Don't get me wrong, the lock is good and I wouldn't be worried about it opening on accident, but the door could have been more precise in the way it fit when closed to eliminate the slight movement.,-1,1
1977,1,28,The battery door on the other cameras I've owned never had any sort of movement when closed.INITIAL START UPI slipped the battery and a 16GB SanDisk Extreme memory card into the camera (SDSDX-016G-X46).,-1,1
1977,1,29,This is a class 10 card with specs that claim up to 45mb/s.,-1,1
1977,1,30,It comes with a limited lifetime warranty and is water, temperature, shock and x-ray proof.When the camera was switched on, nothing happened.,-1,1
1977,1,31,I figured the battery was dead, so I threw it on the charger.,-1,1
1977,1,32,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.,-1,0
1977,1,33,Charging took about 4 hours (which is normal) and then the camera fired right up.You will be prompted to set the date & time right away and then you can start enjoying your new toy.When you turn the camera off, the shutter may operate.,-1,0
1977,1,34,This procedure is normal and your camera is performing an automated pixel mapping routine.,-1,0
1977,1,35,The camera captures an unexposed frame and will analyze it sometime later for hot/stuck pixels.,-1,0
1977,1,36,Some people have reported that the battery life will drop by 15-20% after this analysis due to the processing of the pixel mapping procedure.,-1,0
1977,1,37,I did not have time to confirm this.FIRST USEOnce the battery was fully charged, I reinstalled it into the camera and attached the 50mm E-Mount lens (SEL50F18).,-1,0
1977,1,38,Before I decided to not purchase into the E-Mount line, I did purchase this one from B&H; Photo because this and the 24mm Zeiss (SEL24F18Z) are really the only very good rated E-Mount lenses.Anyway, I snapped a few photos of various objects around the house but was extremely disappointed with the quality of the LCD screen.,-1,1
1977,1,39,No matter what type of lighting environment I introduced to the camera, all I could see on the screen was noise.,-1,1
1977,1,40,I inserted the memory card into my laptop and was able to confirm that the images turned out good.,-1,1
1977,1,41,This camera really does a nice job and the end result is much better than my trusty P&S.;I took this opportunity to test most of the functions on the camera and found that I really had no use for the touch screen.,-1,1
1977,1,42,My fingers kept returning to the 4-way control dial - which by the way was designed very well.,-1,1
1977,1,43,You can either rotate the outer ring of the dial to move through the menu options or you can press on the dial (up, down, left, right).,-1,1
1977,1,44,Initially, I was impressed with the thought of a touch screen camera because I am a Smartphone user and have grown to love touch screens, but after testing I really prefer not to use it on this camera.,-1,1
1977,1,45,I think the touch screen on my 4 year old, off brand GPS unit works better.While I was browsing through the menus, I viewed the setup options for video recording.,-1,1
1977,1,46,I found that the camera I received was the European version (PAL, 50i) and was extremely disappointed in the seller as they were supposed to send the US version (NTSC, 60i).,-1,1
1977,1,47,I thought maybe there was a setting in the menu to switch from PAL to NTSC, so I referenced the manual and to make a long story short, there is not a way to change this.,-1,1
1977,1,48,I did find out that there is a label on the bottom of the camera that has the 50i or 60i specification.,-1,1
1977,1,49,Believe it or not, my camera had the label for 60i and even the product box stated 60i.,-1,1
1977,1,50,Because of this, the camera must be returned, but not before I test the LA-EA2 adapter with the Tamron 17-50 & 70-300mm lenses.I will NEVER do business with 42photo.com,-1,1
1977,1,51,again and suggest you purchase elsewhere.,-1,1
1977,1,52,The most reliable places I've done business with are Amazon and B&H; Photo.LA-EA2 ADAPTER & 2 TAMRON LENSESAll three of these items were purchased from Amazon and arrived in 2 days thanks to my Prime Membership.,-1,1
1977,1,53,The LA-EA2 was unboxed first and it came in a really nice semi-hard padded & zippered case.,-1,1
1977,1,54,The actual adapter is huge!,-1,1
1977,1,55,It's oddly shaped, and roughly the same size as the camera.,-1,1
1977,1,56,Anyway, I attached the adapter to the camera and despite its gigantic proportions, actually added to the overall grip one could have while holding the camera.,-1,1
1977,1,57,Of course, you would need to grip this with your left hand so your right hand is free to access the controls, but unfortunately this does present a potential problem when trying to zoom or focus manually (I'll explain later).The Tamron lenses seem to be built very well (and they should be for the price).,-1,1
1977,1,58,They both have pretty good reviews from professionals and consumers and should offer better IQ than standard kit lenses.,-1,1
1977,1,59,The only issue I noticed with the Tamron lenses is that when mounted there is a small amount of play.,-1,1
1977,1,60,It's not enough to break the connection or cause AF problems, but it is noticeable.,-1,1
1977,1,61,This issue is probably worth taking up to 1/2 a star off the rating of the lens itself but not worth making a stink over or even worth returning it.The camera, with the adapter and either of the lenses, transformed into a small DSLR.,-1,1
1977,1,62,That's not a bad thing, but due to the extra weight and odd shape of the adapter, the combination became quite uncomfortable.,-1,1
1977,1,63,I'm sure you could (but probably wouldn't want to) hold the camera with just your right hand because depending on what lens you were using, could add much more stress to the mounting areas.,-1,1
1977,1,64,To combat this, you need to hold the adapter or lens with your left hand.,-1,1
1977,1,65,I found it to be uncomfortable to hold the lens because it was an extra 1-1.5 inches further from the camera, so I placed my hand under the adapter.,-1,1
1977,1,66,This was more comfortable, but now it would be impossible to zoom or MF with the lens.,-1,1
1977,1,67,And if you were using a larger lens (like the 70-300) taking your hand from the adapter to the lens could present a problem because you need to be 100% confident in your grip with your right hand since the camera is now front heavy.LA-EA2 PERFORMANCEAll the people that reviewed this adapter were not kidding when they said this thing offers exceptionally fast AF performance.,-1,1
1977,1,68,I can confirm that AF is extremely fast and accurate with this adapter...much faster than the 50mm E-Mount lens I tested.,-1,1
1977,1,69,You should have no problem trying to get "that shot" if this adapter is part of your system.PRACTICALITYI would assume that the average user who purchased this camera with the 18-55mm lens (and possibly the 55-210mm lens) would not be disappointed.,-1,1
1977,1,70,IQ is going to be much better than most, if not all, P&S; cameras and the low light abilities are impressive (thanks to the mirrorless design).For someone who has invested in A-Mount lenses or would like the flexibility to upgrade to a Sony DSLR in the future, you will be able to use these lenses with the camera provided you purchase the LA-EA1 or LA-EA2 adapter.,-1,0
1977,1,71,Unfortunately, I think you're better off sticking with a DSLR because once the adapter and lens is added you're right back to where you started and the minimal camera size becomes dwarfed by the combo.,-1,0
1977,1,72,And with the addition of these items, the cost for the NEX-5N actually is more than an entry or mid level DSLR.OUTCOMEIf more lenses were available, if you could attach A-Mount lenses directly to this camera without an adapter and if you could get a body only version that really is the US version at the price I got, I would not hesitate to purchase and keep this camera.,-1,0
1977,1,73,But since the current E-Mount lens line-up is not impressive and you need an adapter and the purchase of the body only from a trusted seller like Amazon is another $150 than what I paid, it just doesn't make sense for me to keep this camera.CHECK OUT THE MATH (Amazon Pricing)NEX-5N Body Only: $500LA-EA2 Adapter: $275Tamron 17-50mm: $425 (after $75 rebate)Tamron 70-300mm: $350 (after $100 rebate)Total: $1,550.00STL-A57,-1,0
1977,1,74,Body Only: $600Tamron 17-50mm: $425 (after $75 rebate)Tamron 70-300mm: $350 (after $100 rebate)Total: $1,375.00CONCLUSIONNeedless to say, I ended up returning the NEX-5N, 50mm lens and adapter.,-1,0
1977,1,75,I purchased the A57 and haven't looked back.,-1,1
1977,1,76,It's a great camera with many of the same features as the NEX-5N and is about the same size and weight (if the adapter and lens was connected to the NEX-5N).,-1,1
1977,1,77,Even though the A57 uses the same ASP-C image sensor, the high ISO performance is a bit noisier than the NEX-5N, however, if you use the LA-EA2 adapter with the NEX-5N I would assume that the ISO performance would be about the same since you are now introducing the translucent mirror technology to the NEX-5N and this mirror will cause more noise at higher ISO.,-1,1
1978,1,0,So close to greatness... First, I would like to note that I have owned digital cameras since 1999 including compacts, midsize and DSLRs.,-1,1
1978,1,1,I love the quality of DSLRs but have felt that the size of the camera prevents me from taking it with me everywhere, essentially missing out a lot of great photos.,-1,1
1978,1,2,The old saying "The worst quality picture is the one you never took" applies to me big time.,-1,1
1978,1,3,This is why I was thrilled to find a camera that should produce images on par with the best amateur DSLRs in the body of a compact and with Sony's outstanding tilting screen (I take lots of pictures of my girls and believe me photographing them from their eye level is the only way to go).Here are my pros and cons:Image quality is very good.,-1,1
1978,1,4,Good detail.,-1,1
1978,1,5,Nice saturated Sony colors (I personally like them but some purists don't)Incredible ISO noise handling.,-1,1
1978,1,6,You can use ISO 1600 and never notice loss of detail unless you do giant prints.ISO 3200 and 6400 totally usable - eliminates the need for using flash in most casesIncredibly small body.,-1,1
1978,1,7,You need to hold it to feel how small it isSolid construction.,-1,1
1978,1,8,Heavy metal body.Cool image features - in camera panorama stitching, HDR photography, 3D (don't know about this last one, but may be useful)High quality video 1080-60P looks greatFast.,-1,1
1978,1,9,Zero wake up time.,-1,1
1978,1,10,10 fps.,-1,1
1978,1,11,Shoots like a machine gunTouch screen allows touch focusingLovely peek focusing for those of you who like to tweak autofocusCons:User interface not great.,-1,1
1978,1,12,No dial mode.,-1,1
1978,1,13,Switching modes is requires several button pressesLowlight auto focusing slow and very unreliableTouchscreen interface nearly useless.,-1,1
1978,1,14,Hoping Sony will improve through firmware updateVideo clicking problem (Google it), not a showstopper, but definitely annoying (supposedly there is a fix but you need to send the camera to Sony)Lens selection extremely limited.No stills while in movie mode (something starting to appear in cameras and really, why not?)Kit flash complete crap.,-1,1
1978,1,15,I have removed it completelyLens cap comes with no string (a $10 replacement is easy to pick up, but come on Sony, why??)Lenses are very big which defeated the point of a small body (haven't tried the 16m prime because of negative reviews)18-55 kit lens construction only OK, twisting the zoom is not smooth, can be felt (and heard) in video mode).I must say.,-1,1
1978,1,16,I am very happy with my purchase and would have given 4.5 stars if possible.,-1,1
1978,1,17,Just annoyed Sony came so close to greatness and messed up some small, easy to fix details.,-1,1
1979,1,0,Living, working, and traveling abroad for the past few years, I  sought to capture my experiences to rub in people's faces on the interwebs.,-1,1
1979,1,1,I was in the market for a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, after my compact camera broke, my DSLR was too heavy with expensive lenses, and my phone camera wasn't cutting it.Admittedly, at first I was only interested in the micro four thirds market.,-1,1
1979,1,2,They had a lot of lenses, were affordable, and looked nice.,-1,1
1979,1,3,Fujifilm's x series were sleek, classy, and sexy but came with a high price that I wasn't willing to pay.,-1,1
1979,1,4,I did consider the Sony NEX series, but shrugged it off because of the price (at  the time the kits that caught my eye were sub $1,000).,-1,1
1979,1,5,While browsing for a new camera in Seoul, I was unsatisfied with every camera/price I found until I came across a used white Sony NEX 5n with the 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 lens for about $200 less than a new model.,-1,1
1979,1,6,It was a no-brainer, especially because it out specs most of the mirrorless competition.The Good:The sensor - APS-C sized, digital dx DSLR quality sensor at 16.1 MP, could possibly be the same or similar to the one in my old Nikon D7000.,-1,1
1979,1,7,Performance is great, colors, low light, ISO, WB, dynamic range and picture quality are all solid.,-1,1
1979,1,8,All the important stuff about being a camera is just fantastic.,-1,0
1979,1,9,My current dslr is full frame, and I wanted a little more reach, yet I wanted to avoid having too much lens distortion on the wide end.,-1,0
1979,1,10,For example, a micro four thirds camera has about 2x magnification due to its sensor size.,-1,0
1979,1,11,A 14mm lens would equal 28mm on a full frame.,-1,0
1979,1,12,Therefore, if one were interested in wider angles with less distortion, the NEX sensor size is a better choice in regards to mirrorless.,-1,1
1979,1,13,Not to mention the low light performance and shallow depth of field would appear better on a bigger sensor (theoretically).The lens - This model comes with the 18-55mm zoom, not to be confused with the flatter motorized 16-50mm zoom.,-1,1
1979,1,14,For a kit lens, I am impressed.,-1,0
1979,1,15,The metal construction is great.,-1,0
1979,1,16,It seems pretty sharp, and CAs and distortion are not bad.Video quality - Maybe this is my favorite thing about this camera.,-1,1
1979,1,17,High quality, continuous focus, and really fun to use.Build quality - This tiny body with tilting touch lcd screen can survive a fall from about 3 or 4 feet high and land flat on the screen and be okay.,-1,1
1979,1,18,I know because it happened to me by accident within the first week of ownership.,-1,1
1979,1,19,No problem at all.,-1,1
1979,1,20,It feels solid, the lens is metal, and it is very light.Speed - This camera is capable of continuosly taking photos faster than my dslr.,-1,0
1979,1,21,That's great for the panoramic mode, HDR mode, or sports.The gimmicks - Yes, the art filters, hdr mode, panoramic mode, and tilting toucnscreen are fun.,-1,0
1979,1,22,In fact, I love it even though it's kind of a gimmick.The so-so:Screen tilt - It barely tilts enough to be of any real use to me.,-1,1
1979,1,23,Newer models, like 5T fully tilt so you can do selfies.Touch screen - Using it to focus is cool.,-1,1
1979,1,24,You can use it for menu options but the font is tiny and its easier for me to click the actual buttons right next to it.Attachable flash - Some love it, some hate it, I don't care.The lens - It is a great kit lens, but pretty standard.,-1,1
1979,1,25,You won't get crazy wide angles or long telephoto with super shallow depth of field with it.,-1,1
1979,1,26,Although it has pretty close focus.,-1,1
1979,1,27,Other lenses are available, but not a lot.,-1,1
1979,1,28,You can pay a boatload of cash for an adapter and pay another boatload of cash to use Sony Alpha dslr lenses.,-1,1
1979,1,29,That is kind of cool, but pricey.The body - The camera body is small, sleek, and built well.,-1,1
1979,1,30,The lens looks like it is hulking out and the hand grip, while useful, isn't pretty.,-1,1
1979,1,31,I think the camera and lens looks comical.The menus - They make sense, but for the sake of simplicity with the button layout, sometimes you have to go in and out of the menus to get the settings you want.,-1,1
1979,1,32,Not exactly efficient, but at least the menus are not hard to navigate or use.The Bad:Battery life - Perhaps I am spoiled, but when I go out for a whole day of shooting pictures and video, I expect the battery to last the whole day.,-1,1
1979,1,33,Luckily, I bought an extra battery as back up and that solves it.,-1,1
1979,1,34,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.,-1,1
1979,1,35,Indoors in a quiet home, the mic is fine.,-1,1
1979,1,36,All other situations require better options, and only the overpriced Sony proprietary crap external mic is available because of their weird attachment.,-1,1
1979,1,37,That drives me up the wall, but Sony's proprietary crap is a whooole other story, and this is a photo camera first, not primarily for video.No hot shoe - Not a huge deal for me, but once again Sony proprietary connections forces you to buy their flashes if you want other flash options.Missed AF/Softness - This is sort of a common issue with these cameras.,-1,1
1979,1,38,I am not sure if it is one or the other, but sometimes it seems the AF is a little bit off.,-1,1
1979,1,39,Maybe its because of the high res sensor and the lens requires focus tuning or something.,-1,1
1979,1,40,It doesn't happen to a lot of photos, but does happen.,-1,1
1979,1,41,I just try to refocus, adjust my angle, and lighting if needed.,-1,1
1979,1,42,You don't have to be a pixel-peeper to notice either....Conclusion:I love this camera and would not return it or trade it for another mirrorless camera.,-1,1
1979,1,43,I dare say it is one of the best mirrorless cameras you can get.,-1,1
1979,1,44,The Sony proprietary connections are pretty annoying, along with the focus issue, and it is not the prettiest camera (I would rate it 3.5 stars honestly because of these factors).,-1,1
1979,1,45,Those things aside, it is solid.,-1,1
1979,1,46,Pictures and video do look great, and I love the way it handles.,-1,0
1979,1,47,I would highly recommend it to those inquiring about it, but acknowledge it is not for everyone.,-1,0
1979,1,48,My friends who are hardcore photography nuts admit they are impressed with the Sony NEX 5n, but would never buy one.,-1,0
1979,1,49,I am happy with it, and look forward to every chance to use it in the future.,-1,0
1980,1,0,Very good camera for what it does but frustrating limitations.,-1,0
1980,1,1,Background: I am a hobbyist and not a pro - this reflects my limited level of understanding of photography which isn't as high as many other reviews.This is an excellent step up from a high-end point and shoot or a lower end DSLR.,-1,0
1980,1,2,The camera takes beautiful photos and allows for some great effects within the camera if you don't want to edit your photo using PhotoShop or GIMP.,-1,0
1980,1,3,The corners are sharp, center focus is quite clear, and the ISO settings are amazing.,-1,0
1980,1,4,The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.,-1,0
1980,1,5,Photos taken in Program Auto, Aperture Priority and Shutter Priority are pretty nice and you have a wide variety of creative effects to use to improve your photos.The camera does have many frustrating limitations.,-1,0
1980,1,6,In DSLRs switching to manual mode opens up a whole set of opportunities and challenges as with this camera but M mode on this camera is a pain.,-1,0
1980,1,7,The following are the big problems:1.,-1,1
1980,1,8,No built in viewfinder - you can buy one for $250 extra but I don't want to spend $250 on a viewfinder - a viewfinder and an extra lens take this camera up to 7N territory in cost which has a lot more than just the viewfinder.,-1,1
1980,1,9,If you buy the viewfinder then you cannot use the enclosed flash while the viewfinder is in use.,-1,1
1980,1,10,I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2.,-1,1
1980,1,11,No aperture control ring - its tedious to change F-Stops and Shutter speed simultaneously through the control ring - also the previews of the aperture change is not as accurate as even a lower-end DSLR.,-1,1
1980,1,12,My basic Canon DSLR offers far superior control.3.,-1,1
1980,1,13,Changing ISO and white balance requires going through multiple steps and menus.,-1,0
1980,1,14,This is especially frustrating with ISO given that one of the best features of this camera is its ISO capabilities.4.,-1,0
1980,1,15,Your lens options are quite limited and pretty expensive.,-1,0
1980,1,16,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.,-1,0
1980,1,17,One of the challenges with adapters for this camera is its mirrorless nature - the sensor is directly visible and when you add an extra an extra half inch of space between the sensor and the end of the lens -it is hard to calibrate the adjustments required to get the right shots.I still give the camera 4 stars because you can take beautiful pictures with it.,-1,1
1980,1,18,It is however not ideal if you are trying to improve your skills at exposure.,-1,1
1980,1,19,I would go for a slightly more expensive DSLR for that such as a Canon Ti.,-1,0
1981,1,0,mine also has a CLICK NOISE problem!!! UPDATE (03/27/12):My replacement order came today.,-1,1
1981,1,1,This one still has a 'minor' clicking sound when you shake it gently, but luckily the sound does not get copied onto video while recording unless you jerk around like crazy (but then this defeats the purpose of shooting a video :/).,-1,1
1981,1,2,I can't say I am 100% happy about the replacement, but at least I won't be annoyed function-wise while using the camera.My verdict - This one is going to stay with me :)One more thing, it seems like cameras get shipped from different places depending on when you purchase, and where you live,meaning you can't really 'guess' whether or not your camera would be defect-free from reading newer reviews.Mine (original order and replacement) came from two different places, one from California, and the other from Nevada.====================================================================================================================* buyers beware *I ordered mine yesterday (on March 23rd 2012), and got it this morning.As soon as I got the camera out of the package, I could hear the 'click click' noise coming from the body.. ugh!I'm really annoyed and sad at the same time.,-1,1
1981,1,3,Even the one I tested at a local camera store had a clicking problem.Sony, seriously, i think it's about time you did something about nex-5n!!My replacement order is on its way.. we'll see how it goes this time around.,-1,1
1982,1,0,Great little camera.,-1,1
1982,1,1,I bought the Canon T3i and returned, Sony A65 and returned again.,-1,1
1982,1,2,Both of the cameras are not compact and they're not bulky enough to make me look like professional.,-1,1
1982,1,3,I'm not a professional anyway.,-1,1
1982,1,4,(:I finally decided to get the Sony NEX 5N due to its size and positive reviews on the web.,-1,1
1982,1,5,I was worries about its size and lack of PASM button but it turns out to be so wonderful.,-1,1
1982,1,6,When I first receive the camera I was like "WTF", why the body is so mall and the lens bigger than the body but once I play around with it for like a day, I start to fall in love with it.,-1,1
1982,1,7,I took pictures for the girls and they was like "What a cute little camera" .^.^.,-1,1
1982,1,8,I wish I have the white version body and white lenses....that would make this camera a beautiful toy.,-1,1
1982,1,9,Well, not as beautiful as the NEX-7 but for the price, the NEX-5N is the most beautiful compact DSLR-like camera on the market with a APS-C sensor and full of features.,-1,1
1982,1,10,Thumbs up for SONY on this one.Before,-1,1
1982,1,11,I purchase this camera, I already tried both T3i and A65 and both of them are returned.,-1,1
1982,1,12,I also compares to Fuji X10, GF3, G3, GH2, EP3, Nikon D5100.,-1,1
1982,1,13,In my opinion, the NEX-5N beat them all in over-all features and price.,-1,1
1982,1,14,It packed with 16.1MP APS-C sensor, can record full 1080p 60p/24p, full manual control, 10fps, touch screen, picture effects, fast start up time, super quiet and fast focus....and so on.Reason why I give it a 4 star instead of 5:I wish the body is a little wider taller than the lensNo standard hotshoeNo built in flash (It would be nice to make a camera a little wider and taller with built-in popup flash)No built in EVF (I careless about this because it will make the camera cost more, but its nice to implemented without to increase the price) :)No AF/MF button on the 18-55mm kit lensNo in-body Image Stabilizer like the Alpha Series (Why not SONY?,-1,1
1982,1,15,camera shipped with kit lens attached to the body, so NO rear lens cap and NO body cap are supplied.,-1,1
1982,1,16,Menu is a little confusing for beginner.,-1,1
1982,1,17,It doesn't make sense to have Camera and Setting separated.,-1,1
1982,1,18,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.,-1,1
1982,1,19,I wish SONY will have that as a standard design feature on all future NEX and Alpha Series.CLICKING NOISE issue when recording video (known issue and SONY will fix it for free, SONY will pay for all shipping/handling feesI GET SYSTEM ERROR SCREEN FLICKERING after taking a bunch of pictures continuously.,-1,1
1982,1,20,Had to turn off and turn on again.Overall, I am HIGHLY recommended this camera to anyone looking to purchase a camera with DSRL-like image quality and ability to shoot 1080p 60p/24p video.,-1,0
1982,1,21,(If you got money to burn, go for the NEX-7)Here are the images I took with my NEX-5N.,-1,0
1982,1,22,All the pictures are taken in Auto mode: flickr dot com/vincentvinhP.S. Hey SONY, stop being stingy and share the white version to all retailers.,-1,0
1983,1,0,Great image quality in a small package.,-1,1
1983,1,1,Great build and image quality really enjoyable shutter sound :) , annoying external flash the connector feels like it might break so it better to leave the flash always connected to the camera IMHO.,-1,1
1984,1,0,Amazing Camera.,-1,0
1984,1,1,I love this camera.,-1,0
1984,1,2,Its been 2 years since I bought it and it still takes perfect pictures.,-1,0
1984,1,3,The video is also amazing, but it's only flaw is that is seems to overheat if the video runs continuously for longer than 4-5 minutes.,-1,0
1984,1,4,It does ok at first but after repeated takes it overheats quicker.That being said I will continue to stick with the Sony NEX brand,-1,1
1985,1,0,This camera takes great photos.,-1,1
1985,1,1,My friends (who probably aren't as talented as I am) have "high-end" cameras costing loads more than this.,-1,1
1985,1,2,They buy expensive lenses and brag about their gear, but that means nothing if you can't use it.This camera works wonders when you learn how to use it.,-1,1
1985,1,3,People have looked at my photos and asked me what camera I use and are shocked when they see it.,-1,1
1985,1,4,It has all the power and more of some of the DSLR's you see in the entry level market.The,-1,1
1985,1,5,only issue I have with it is a lot of features require you to go through the touch screen.,-1,1
1985,1,6,I hear the NEX5R and NEX6 fix most of these problems, so I plan on upgrading to one of those cameras someday (when I have money again).,-1,1
1986,1,0,Fantastic replacement of my DSLR.,-1,1
1986,1,1,I got bored of carrying around a big DSLR with lenses, cases, filters and all, so I decided to go slimmer and lighter with a mirrorless from Sony.,-1,1
1986,1,2,I've always liked Sony picture quality and colors, and after reading specialized site's reviews, this one was the safest option.The flexibility of a multi-lens system, combined with a light body that fits in your hand and is incredibly easy to use was very attractive.,-1,0
1986,1,3,However, what was really a DEAL Maker for me, was the flexibility of choosing advanced settings in the same package.The only down sides to this camera, is that the interface is not very responsive.,-1,1
1986,1,4,We are all used to our smartphones touchscreens, and this one is not even close as fast and precise.,-1,1
1986,1,5,It does the job,but it can be frustrating when you are in a hurry to take that GREAT picture.There is a feature that I really love: the focus aid highlights in a bright red the areas of the frame that are in focus, so you can concentrate on framing the picture, and not come out with a blurry take.,-1,1
1987,1,0,Takes great pics.,-1,0
1987,1,1,Just had a baby and this camera was great to capture our memories.,-1,0
1987,1,2,Took amazing pics and easy to use.,-1,0
1987,1,3,The lens is a little bulky but hasn't been an issue.,-1,1
1988,1,0,Easiest camera for casual shooters to get professional looking shots even in low light.,-1,0
1988,1,1,I am an advanced amateur photograper, and use Nikon DSLR with a bag full of lenses and accessories.,-1,0
1988,1,2,Ever since I got the NEX 5N, I find the Nikon staying home for most of my casual outings, and I enjoy the near same quality coming from a significantly smaller and lighter packaging which stays on a belt pouch than a 12 lb back pack.Pros:Excellent low light performance.,-1,1
1988,1,3,The Handheld twiligt mode is nothing short of magical, where 6 shots at high ISO (usually 6400 for all practical indoor lighting) are taken in quick succession and combined to provide the final image with noise levels matching ISO1600 of my DSLR.,-1,1
1988,1,4,This means my wife who does nothing more than a casual single handed  snapshot still can get sharp pictures in dim lit indoors.,-1,1
1988,1,5,This is the only scene mode I use.Good feature set and manual controls - P/A/S/M - allows me to control my shots when doing more than casual snap shots.Touchscreen interface, once familiarized, is easy to use.Cons:Contrast detect AF struggles in very low light / night shots.,-1,0
1988,1,6,This is one area where NEX lags behind a true DSLR by a huge margin.Direct function access buttons and dials missing and is  more cumbersome to make adjustments on the fly as compared to a DSLR - but then hey that is why Sony has the NEX 7.,-1,1
1989,1,0,I reviewed this camera to the Nikon 1 J1 and ultimately went with this camera instead.,-1,0
1989,1,1,I seemed to take better pictures overall even though it was slightly larger.,-1,0
1989,1,2,I wanted something I could still fit in my purse and this is just on the larger side of fitting, but it still does.,-1,0
1989,1,3,I am loving the pictures I'm getting of my children.,-1,0
1989,1,4,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.,-1,0
1990,1,0,Sony camera.,-1,1
1990,1,1,I have only used it once but it was at night outside and the pictures where amazing.,-1,0
1990,1,2,I was surprised at the way the pictures came out.,-1,0
1991,1,0,Very nice camera.,-1,0
1991,1,1,I am very happy with this camera.,-1,0
1991,1,2,It's a very solid camera with very good picture quality and the kit lens is quite nice as well.,-1,0
1991,1,3,However there are a few downsides:* The video button is in a very unfortunate place and cannot be disabled, so I have drained my battery a couple of times by accidentally capturing 20 minutes of video of the inside of my bag.*,-1,0
1991,1,4,That clicking sound people complain about is quite real.,-1,1
1991,1,5,However at least for me you have to shake it to hear it, and if you shake your camera while recording video you are doing so many things wrong you don't deserve clean audio.,-1,1
1991,1,6,;-)* The screen is very hard to use in direct sunlight.,-1,1
1991,1,7,However you can always see it enough to frame the image.*,-1,0
1991,1,8,The kit flash is pretty bad.,-1,0
1991,1,9,It works, but it's very harsh and does not cover the image all that evenly and has a very short range.,-1,0
1992,1,0,Good for still photo.,-1,1
1992,1,1,But the latest one from Amazon still clicks.,-1,1
1992,1,2,Ordered the black kit from Amazon (sold by Amazon)on March 1, 2012, received on 03/08/2012.,-1,1
1992,1,3,Everything is good except the annoying click noise in video mode.,-1,1
1992,1,4,Actually I believe the noise is mechanical part related.,-1,1
1992,1,5,Without the lenses and any moving part, with the camera turning off, just shake the camera a bit and you can hear the clicking noise.,-1,1
1992,1,6,Too bad I have to return it to Amazon.,-1,1
1992,1,7,What's going on with Sony?,-1,1
1993,1,0,Audio clicking problem in video mode.,-1,1
1993,1,1,There is an audio clicking problem for this new camera in video mode...,-1,1
1993,1,2,You sure you want to buy something new at a cost of $700 and send it back straight to the service center and wait for 5 days or more and still have that problem there after it comes back?,-1,1
1993,1,3,It only lower the clicking sound after the service, but still there.Think hard ... Think really hard....I personally return mine...,-1,1
1994,1,0,Still Clickin' I just bought this camera last week (Aug 1).,-1,1
1994,1,1,I can confirm it still has the click problem if you try to record video even moving the camera a little bit.I am not a pro,but I took identical pics w/ the 5n and the Canon T1s, the Canon pics definitely seemed to have more pop with both on auto.,-1,1
1995,1,0,Don't buy it - unless you want to return it twice - as I did.... Hi,I bought this camera once believing the CLICK BUG was fixed by Sony and that Amazon, would not sell a problematic product.Immediately after unboxing, I recorded a movie and realized that the Click Bug was affecting my unit...I returned it to Amazon.I thought: maybe i was unlucky... Let me try it again...I reordered it and guess what...,-1,1
1995,1,1,The second camera was ALSO bugged...What Amazon AND Sony doing?,-1,1
1995,1,2,Why the still sell this camera ???Don't buy it !,-1,1
1996,1,0,Excellent still photos but the clicking problem in the video makes it not worth the money.,-1,1
1996,1,1,I was really excited to get this camera and thought that by now Sony would have fixed the issue.,-1,1
1996,1,2,If they have, then Amazon is not getting fresh shipments because the camera that I just received (on March 12th, 2012) and ordered on March 8th, 2012 (sold by Amazon), still has the infuriating clicking problem with the sound in videos.,-1,1
1996,1,3,I say "infuriating" because when paying $700 you don't expect to have to settle for a defective product.,-1,1
1996,1,4,Other than that, the pictures are simply amazing, especially in low light, and I feel very sad that I have to return it to Amazon (unless they exchange it for a non-defective unit, but I doubt that is possible).,-1,1
1997,1,0,Still clicks.,-1,1
1997,1,1,After the long wait, you would think Sony has fixed the clicking issue and the defective ones are all depleted from the channels.,-1,1
1997,1,2,This proves not the case as I ordered on March 7, and right out of the box I knew I got a lemon.,-1,1
1997,1,3,You can hear the loud click just by picking it up.,-1,1
1997,1,4,And the test video also shows the same thing.,-1,1
1997,1,5,The camera is going back to Amazon and it will be a long long while I will ever consider Sony again...,-1,1
1998,1,0,Great stills camera, but defective for video [waiting for repair] 9/24/2011 updateSony finally responded officially and is accepting cameras for "adjustment" at their repair center in the US.,-1,1
1998,1,1,I will revise my review when I receive my camera back.,-1,1
1998,1,2,Sounds like it may take a week+...***I have been looking forward to this and the NEX-7 for several months.,-1,1
1998,1,3,I love the camera as a photo camera, but waited for this NEX over the previous (NEX-5) specifically for a better video capability - which it has...But...,-1,1
1998,1,4,It clicks!,-1,1
1998,1,5,It clicks a lot and the clicking (possibly caused by a tilt sensor?) is right next to the mic.,-1,1
1998,1,6,So sad.Sony hasn't officially responded.,-1,1
1998,1,7,So I am planning on returning my camera if they don't acknowledge and address the issue promptly.,-1,1
1998,1,8,Sony customer service doesn't have a great track record, but I am willing to be surprised.I already had recommended the camera to several friends.Not any more.,-1,1
1999,1,0,You can consider this camera if1) You have shot P&S; for long time and want better image quality (Sony or otherwise, a bigger sensor will get u better IQ)2) You know the power of DLSR particularly from Canon or Nikon, but your are willing to forgo that "demanding or assumed" expectations from a DSLR for the sake of compactness (if not portable)3) You are content with kit lens4) You are willing to pay an extra premium, again, for a sleek small sized cameraNow I took off 2 stars for this1) Mine clicks,clicks,clicks.,-1,1
1999,1,1,I got it at the end of Jan 2012.,-1,1
1999,1,2,I know about the problem before I ordered but thought that the odds are very low.,-1,1
1999,1,3,TBH, Sony customer service was very good and they paid for shipping.,-1,1
1999,1,4,Sent it for repair to Laredo, TX and got it back in a week.,-1,1
1999,1,5,The result is a "IMPROVEMENT" (read the word).,-1,1
1999,1,6,Hopefully it lasts.2),-1,1
1999,1,7,I don't understand this reseller concept with Sony, not that I don't like resellers.,-1,1
1999,1,8,They are the only game online when I ordered.,-1,1
1999,1,9,However, my LCD does not have the colored sticker glued to it.,-1,1
1999,1,10,Nor I see any colored tag talking about APS-C sensor tied to the camera.,-1,1
1999,1,11,Look at "unboxing the nex-5n" videos on youtube, to understand what i'm taking about.,-1,1
1999,1,12,Unless proven otherwise, I suspect it is a repackaged new item sent to me.,-1,1
1999,1,13,Not a good feeling after paying full price 699$.,-1,1
1999,1,14,Amazon was very good to me when I had to return once before (no strings), but if I had to do this now for clicking or suspicion, I'll have to pay for return shipment to Cameta.,-1,1
1999,1,15,Something is fishy here and Sony should also provide enough of their product to the Tier 1 online vendors who are trustable.Watch out for this:1.,-1,1
1999,1,16,I also bought 16mm lens.,-1,1
1999,1,17,Like most reviewers said, the IQ is so so so so, well let me say it, not "PRIME" quality.,-1,1
1999,1,18,Buy it only if you want jacketable camera.,-1,1
1999,1,19,For all other routine purposes for a normal user, 18-55mm kit lens will deliver the same results.2.,-1,1
1999,1,20,Now that i'm finding out, consider 4/3's.,-1,1
1999,1,21,You will find many well rounded alternatives which are way cheaper.,-1,1
1999,1,22,Don't just get carried away with a slightly bigger sensor and ignore the full package.Finally, all above things aside, the picture quality and some features like HDR/DRO, Panaroma, etc. are good.,-1,1
1999,1,23,Its fast to operate.,-1,1
1999,1,24,I got better results with iAuto or Scene modes than w PASM.,-1,1
1999,1,25,I did setup the custom buttons which make the usage easy.,-1,1
1999,1,26,Wasabi batteries  that I ordered are working too.,-1,1
1999,1,27,I wish the lens cap had a leash.,-1,1
2000,1,0,Lets play camera roulette!,-1,1
2000,1,1,Ordered from Amazon (Amazon direct was the seller) on 12/4/2011 still had that annoying click!,-1,1
2000,1,2,Returned it right away and got a new kit directly from sony a week later and am proud to say there is no click at all!,-1,1
2000,1,3,I upgraded from the NEX 5 to the N (nex 5n) because (in order of importance ) it has manual mode for video, 60p for slow motion/smooth motion also the pictures look a lot better and sharper.,-1,1
2000,1,4,I dont know exactly what it is but they look amazing compared to the old.,-1,1
2000,1,5,I tested with kit lens taking the same photos in both auto mode.,-1,1
2000,1,6,It could be also that the N has lens correction.,-1,1
2000,1,7,There are more reasons to buy into this line like the APS-C senor but for that you should check a full review on dpreview [dot] com and stevehuffphoto [dot] com.,-1,1
2000,1,8,This is a great value for the money but smugs sony's "Your Holding it Wrong" response to the clicking problem and failure to recall units forces me to deduct it 2 stars.,-1,1
2000,1,9,I dont want to play camera roulette when I want to buy a new product and waste my money and time guessing what will work.,-1,1
2001,1,0,A great camera for photographing, but not for video recording.,-1,0
2001,1,1,I purchased this compact machine last Dec, and it is amazing!,-1,0
2001,1,2,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.,-1,0
2001,1,3,The image is sharp and color is accurate.,-1,0
2001,1,4,I am upgraded from the M43 and I would say I am very satisfied with it.,-1,0
2001,1,5,However...When the camera is released, the video clicking issues has been widely reported.,-1,1
2001,1,6,In Sept. 2011, Sony has release an official statement that Sony will provide some video recording improvement for those affected NEX5Ns.(What,-1,1
2001,1,7,will Sony do?,-1,1
2001,1,8,I don't know much about it, but I can assure you Sony will tear the camera apart to fix it since it is hardware related) .I did not purchased this camera since I thought it would take a while for the new in-defective batches to arrive to the market.,-1,1
2001,1,9,But now from what i purchased from amazon at the end of 2011, my unit still has the video clicking issue, which means Sony is still pushing the old defective units to the market and you may get it from any dealers, includes Amazon.Mostly I only takes photos with my camera, but I do not wish to spend over 600 bucks for an defective product.,-1,1
2001,1,10,For any of you who wish to purchase this camera, please wait for a bit longer.,-1,1
2002,1,0,Touchscreen cracked just by touching while trying to focus the object.,-1,1
2002,1,1,The camera was fine for two months.,-1,1
2002,1,2,Then one summer day last week, while taking some family photos, I touched the square on the touch screen to fix focus on my kid's face and the screen instantly developed a crack on the inside.Called Sony and explained the issue.,-1,1
2002,1,3,The representative assured me that I would have to ship the camera at my expense but it would be repaired and send back at no charge.,-1,1
2002,1,4,This sounded too good to be true.,-1,1
2002,1,5,Within a day after the Sony Repair Center in Laredo received my camera, they left a voice mail on the phone that there is an estimate of $ 210.86 for physical damage.,-1,1
2002,1,6,The camera does even have a single scratch on the body or the screen.,-1,1
2002,1,7,Don't know the Sony repair engineers assessed it as physically damaged.Gonna get it back, sell it for whatever I can get and swear never to buy a Sony product again!!!,-1,1
2003,1,0,Not Quite What I Expected.,-1,1
2003,1,1,I purchased this outfit (w/18-55mm) as a "walk about" replacement for my standard SLR.,-1,1
2003,1,2,The lightweight and features noted were enough to convince me that it could serve as a good back up and after reading the technical reviews posted by many I made my choice favoring the Sony over a Lumix with comparable features.,-1,1
2003,1,3,Obviously Sony has concentrated on their electronics expertise vs. camera technology in building this unit and it requires a learning curve in order to master the (simple) yet bewildering menu system.,-1,1
2003,1,4,That being said, I have now given the unit trials under most ordinary conditions and find that unless you have a perfectly lit environment most images are either too dark or over exposed at the Auto, P and A settings.,-1,1
2003,1,5,Also, the use of the small flash unit tends to produce "flare" or "burnt" casting and has a range limitation (expected) but flares within the 6' range.,-1,1
2003,1,6,The mounting for the flash unit is also prone to coming loose and requires constant attention before any use.,-1,1
2003,1,7,The LCD display while a good feature is prone to fogging and unless used in semi-darkness or low natural light will not provide enough detail for optimal viewing and I wish that I had waited for the NEX 7 with optical viewfinder.,-1,1
2003,1,8,The Sweep Panorama feature is great, but again, unless there is optimal lighting at ALL ranges the resulting image will be disappointing.,-1,1
2003,1,9,This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings.,-1,0
2003,1,10,Its best feature is the HD video with exceptionally good audio quality, but if your intention is to shoot long videos DON'T, as the camera will OVERHEAT and automatically shut down after about 15 minutes of operation.,-1,0
2003,1,11,I am reluctant to use this camera for what I had intended and probably will sell, or trade it for the Lumix.,-1,0
2004,1,0,Still Clicking Sound.,-1,1
2004,1,1,I received this Nex-5N on May 18. Somebody told me that clicking sound issue while video recording is solved so that I bought this camera.,-1,1
2004,1,2,This explains why Sony is now collapsing rapidly.,-1,1
2004,1,3,Don't buy this camera.,-1,1
2005,1,0,Do NOT BUY - DEFECTIVE.,-1,1
2005,1,1,NEX5N click of death.The camera producing background clicking sounds while recording a video.,-1,1
2005,1,2,(check on YouTube)Sony not helping with solving the problem, they offer to send the camera back and the process will take around 30 days to get it back fixed.They offered me to buy a new one and return the old one if I don't want to be without a camera for a month.,-1,1
2005,1,3,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.,-1,1
2006,1,0,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.,-1,1
2006,1,1,I purchased the camera yesterday not knowing the it was defective with a clicking noise when making movies... the clicking is horrible, but most horrible is that Sony has not recalled the cameras and still selling them.,-1,1
2006,1,2,I didn't pay $700 to get a defective camera that needed to be fixed.,-1,1
2006,1,3,I'm returning the camera to day to Best Buy.DO THE RIGHT THING SONY, RECALL YOUR DEFECTIVE CAMERA!DO THE RIGHT THING BEST BUY, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!DO THE RIGHT THING AMAZON, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!,-1,1
2007,1,0,Sony fails with NEX-5N, video with click out of the box.,-1,1
2007,1,1,Amazing how Sony can fail with product quality, I just got the NEX-5N, and it has the clicking sound on every video I record, in fact I can hear that there is something loose inside the camera even when I take photos.Now I have to send it to Texas for repairs, this takes about 7-10 days total, including shipping.,-1,1
2007,1,2,It is even more amazing that about 2 months after the camera entered the markets and the consumers were complaining about the sound in the web writings for weeks, Sony still cannot simply pull the failed devices out of the market and replace with new ones.,-1,1
2007,1,3,Sony must give all us who face the problem a new camera because how I now can be sure that 1) the camera will be really fixed and 2) the fix is permanent and it does not fail after 2 months again.,-1,1
2007,1,4,Someone is Sony's quality and engineering department has not done their jobs well.,-1,1
2007,1,5,Shame on you Sony.,-1,1
2008,1,0,DO NOT BUY UNTIL SONY ADDRESSES CLICKING ISSUE.,-1,1
2008,1,1,I bought the silver model and reviewed it before I discovered/heard off the clicking issue.,-1,1
2008,1,2,Sony is finally acknowledging the problem just not saying what it is and if the fix will completely fix the problem.,-1,1
2008,1,3,I have to send my unit for 5-7 days and it's only going out ground (unless you make a huge stink like I did to get overnight).,-1,1
2008,1,4,This suck because it's otherwise a great camera.,-1,0
2009,1,0,Be aware if you want to use it to make home video.,-1,1
2009,1,1,Original: I got this baby about 2 weeks ago and  do like almost everything of it.@BUT!!!If you want to use it to make some home video, google this out:sony alpha nex 5n makes clicking sound.It really could be a big issue and I hope sony can fix it.,-1,1
2010,1,0,Video defect is not the only problem.,-1,1
2010,1,1,Upon receiving this camera, I put it through its paces and I immediately noticed two firmware bugs that should have been obvious to Sony, if they had done proper testing.,-1,1
2010,1,2,They both involve the screen flickering about 1/2 second after you turn the camera off under different circumstances.,-1,1
2010,1,3,It is possible these 'bugs' are actually indicative of a defective camera, however the 5N does take photos.After a little while, I brought this camera on a trip, and here is the very brief summary.It is a light and easy to handle camera.,-1,1
2010,1,4,The large lens eliminates any chance of putting the camera in your pocket, but you can buy the Sony 16mm pancake lens for $250 to make the camera pocketable.The 5N takes excellent JPEG pictures (I have not had the chance to install Sony's RAW program yet).The Movie button is placed very problematically, as it is quite easy to accidentally press it when picking up the camera.,-1,1
2010,1,5,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.,-1,1
2010,1,6,I am told that over time, one adapts to this button placement.Several people have complained about the video feature recording a clicking sound and I can confirm that this is the case.,-1,1
2010,1,7,Sony claims they are going to fix cameras that are sent in for repair for this feature, but naturally some existing customers will seek refunds, as I have.You can view a video proving the clicking effect here:[...],-1,1
2011,1,0,The clicking is still an issue.,-1,1
2011,1,1,This is REALLY disappointing and as much as I wanted to buy this camera, I will not and do not recommend to do so.,-1,1
2011,1,2,I just called Sony and they confirmed that the issue is still there and that customers need to send their $700 cameras if they find the clicking issue.I asked them whether they can tell me a way to figure out whether the issue is still present but they said they cannot.,-1,1
2011,1,3,They specifically said that they cannot tell from the serial number or the manufacturing date.Finally they added that after one purchase it.,-1,1
2011,1,4,if they issue is there, then the $700 camera needs to be sent for service and wait between 5-7 days.Let me add that Sony is dropping the ball, there are many complaints about the quality of their products and customer service and I will add another example.,-1,1
2011,1,5,A series of Sony Viao laptops drained their batteries even when the computer was off because there was a design failure and the battery circuit could not be closed.,-1,1
2011,1,6,Sony admitted the issue but never provided a solution.,-1,1
2012,1,0,Sony dropped the ball!,-1,1
2012,1,1,i was absolutely looking forward to this camera because it has a touch screen & 1080p recording.,-1,1
2012,1,2,too bad sony screwed up the video recording.,-1,1
2012,1,3,it camera makes constant clicking noise when you pan or tilt during video recording.,-1,1
2012,1,4,i consider this a defective product.,-1,1
2012,1,5,sony does offer a free repair to help alleviate this issue but i don't want deal with the hassle.the,-1,1
2012,1,6,camera also overheats pretty easily when you're recording video.,-1,1
2012,1,7,you'll get about 20 minutes of video before it shuts down.,-1,1
2012,1,8,you can resolve this issue by removing the sticker behind the LCD screen and extending out the LCD screen so the camera can cool faster but that will void your warranty.,-1,1
2013,1,0,annoying design flaw.,-1,1
2013,1,1,great camera, but it has one problem that is fatal, the flash design is flawed.,-1,1
2013,1,2,the screw that secures the attachment of the flash to the top of the camera battery is inaccessible to those that have big fingers!,-1,1
2013,1,3,I was not able to attach the flash at all and it kept breaking the contact, consequently the flash would not fire.,-1,1
2013,1,4,I have returned the product.,-1,1
2014,1,0,I have had NEX 5 for a year and half now and I thank myself for buying an extended warranty.,-1,1
2014,1,1,The camera has inconsistent problem of getting locked up when shooting.,-1,1
2014,1,2,The screen turns blue and flashes 'camera error'.,-1,1
2014,1,3,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.,-1,1
2014,1,4,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.,-1,1
2014,1,5,I had sent it in November to Precision camera for repairs and the work order showed that they had done some repair on LCD then.,-1,1
2014,1,6,Its back to precision camera again after it got completely locked up day before yesterday .I used to like the camera.. its versatility and size and features and I have made substantial investment in various lenses including the 18-200 and the new bigger flash, but I am now beginning to question the reliability of its mechanics.,-1,1
2014,1,7,It has failed me at critical times and therefore I use just as a back up because I am stuck with it.Anybody out there with similar experience ?,-1,1
2015,1,0,Sony shutter sound obnoxious.,-1,1
2015,1,1,I purchased the Sony NEX-5N and I am returning it.,-1,1
2015,1,2,I phoned Sony and they informed me that the shutter sound that the camera makes cannot be turned off!,-1,1
2015,1,3,So, I cannot takes photos at weddings with this camera, I cannot take photos at sports events (Golf mainly) with this camera and cannot take photos of my grandchildren with this camera.,-1,0
2015,1,4,The grandchildren will be playing nicely together and I want a candid shot of them and with the super fast continuous I could take several photos of them.,-1,0
2015,1,5,But, instead, the children heard that first click (then continuously hear the clicks)and turn and look at me instead of doing what they were doing that I wanted to take a photo of.,-1,0
2015,1,6,This needs to be corrected!!! Also, Sony's new thing with their cameras is that they will ONLY take a Sony battery.,-1,0
2015,1,7,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?,-1,0
2015,1,8,Yes, beautiful photos, fast continuous shooting.,-1,0
2015,1,9,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.,-1,0
2015,1,10,You can purchase a viewfinder for it.,-1,0
2015,1,11,And it is half the weight and size of a DSLR.,-1,0
2015,1,12,But it must go back, the sound is uncalled for.,-1,0
2016,1,0,No Sequential Ordering for Video Files!!!,-1,1
2016,1,1,You buy a $600 camera and the stupid developers can't even implement sequential file numbers for video files--only photos.,-1,1
2016,1,2,So when you clean off all your video files, the numbering starts over again at 00000.MTS!,-1,1
2016,1,3,Just another reason developers suck, because they are lazy.,-1,1
2016,1,4,Wow, I bet there are like 1000 technical roadblocks to implement this feature...I think we will have to wait for quantum computing.,-1,1
2016,1,5,Seriously Sony, make those lazy developers that "work" for you fix it.,-1,1
2017,1,0,The Camera box was already opened.,-1,1
2017,1,1,I got the NEX-5N with 18-55mm lens, in 2 days with Amazon prime.,-1,1
2017,1,2,but when i opened the shipping box i was not happy because there was no sony seal (which will be there for new, unopened) Sony camera box.(,-1,1
2017,1,3,Atleast this is ok ) when i saw the camera, i didnt see any sony stickers to it(One for the APS-C sensor and other for the LCD screen), because when i looked for "NEX-5N unboxing" videos in youtube, i saw those sony stickers in the video.,-1,1
2017,1,4,Also, the LCD screen had finger prints.I dont want to Buy a used product with Full Price, $775(including tax)  and not ready to deal with other issues with the camera.(Already,-1,1
2017,1,5,NEX-5N had some clikcing problems, which Sony offered replacements)Shame on Sony Retailer who sold this product to me.,-1,1
2017,1,6,Thought you can cheat ????For all who are going to buy this product and just bought, make sure you see the "Unboxing videos" in You-tube and check you have similar packings / New product stickers.,-1,1
2018,1,0,Slow transfers, slow picture-taking, and no space.,-1,1
2018,1,1,I've been using my Fujifilm for about 3 months now, and the bad things are starting to outweigh the good as I'm seeing the vast array of digital  cameras on the market.,-1,1
2018,1,2,I didn't have much time to choose between cameras  when I bought this one, but it looked like a good deal.,-1,1
2018,1,3,I'm not saying it's a bad camera, and it may turn out to  be excellent... for a beginner.,-1,1
2018,1,4,First of all, the camera comes with a  serial cable.,-1,1
2018,1,5,No matter how much juice you try to pump through the cable,  you only wind up getting about 1 picture per minute transfer time.,-1,1
2018,1,6,That  might be ok if you download your pictures once a day, but most people  won't.,-1,1
2018,1,7,Secondly, the picture-taking is much too slow if you're trying to  capture something within a small time frame.,-1,1
2018,1,8,There's a slight lag when  pressing the button, about 1/2 to 1 second, which might sound unimportant  in text, but it seems like a lot more when you're the one taking the  picture.,-1,1
2018,1,9,Not to mention the camera doesn't actually "snap" until  you fully release the button, unlike most cameras usually snapping when you  press the button.,-1,1
2018,1,10,This makes it EXTREMELY hard to explain to someone if  you want someone else to take a picture for you, like when you're on  vacation.,-1,1
2018,1,11,Besides the lag in the initial snap, you have to wait a good 6-7  seconds before you can take another picture.,-1,1
2018,1,12,That's just unacceptable if  you're trying to take a picture of something passing and you took the  picture just a second too soon and want to get another try.,-1,1
2018,1,13,There's no  second chances.,-1,1
2018,1,14,And lastly, the problem of storage.,-1,1
2018,1,15,The Fujifilm comes  with a 4 meg memory capacity.,-1,0
2018,1,16,This only holds 13 pictures when the camera  is set normally.,-1,0
2018,1,17,If you want to get any decent space out of it, you'd have  to purchase the 32 meg storage card, which costs 110 bucks.,-1,0
2018,1,18,By this time,  you've (I've) spent over 300 dollars and have a camera that's not as good  as other 300+ dollar cameras.,-1,0
2018,1,19,In summary, the only way I would recommend  this camera is if a) You have plenty of time on your hands to download  pictures b) You are taking pictures of lifeless objects c) You plan on  downloading your pictures very oftenTake it for what it's worth.,-1,0
2019,1,0,I've had problems.,-1,1
2019,1,1,Besides the lag problem mentioned in another review, I've had an issue with the camera not staying on when switched.,-1,1
2019,1,2,I miss about 80% of the shots I'm trying to take because I have to keep turning it back on, taking out the memory card and/or batteries and replacing them etc.,-1,1
2019,1,3,Bad frame errors are haunting.,-1,1
2019,1,4,Once it starts working, I can usually take many pictures in a row, but in the beginning it's horrible.,-1,1
2019,1,5,This is all probably my fault for trying to snap a picture when the dial was turned to the viewing mode.,-1,1
2019,1,6,But that shouldn't have harmed the electronics!,-1,1
2019,1,7,One can't always remember to get the dial in the right position.,-1,1
2020,1,0,I was looking for a camera to replace my aging Casio EX-Z1000, which has served me well over the past 5 years or so.,-1,1
2020,1,1,I wanted something with a similar form factor, with the expectation that a newer camera would naturally include newer (and better) technology.,-1,1
2020,1,2,The EX-Z1000 was great, but had problems with color accuracy and excess noise even at moderate ISO settings (ISO 400 and above).I've heard good things about Canon point-and-shoots for a while, so I figured I would go with one this time around.,-1,1
2020,1,3,I settled on the Elph 520 HS, which at that time had the best reviews among its siblings (the 1xx and the 3xx series).I immediately tested the 520 HS upon getting it, shooting somewhere around 20 images before charging it and another 60-70 images after.,-1,1
2020,1,4,The shots ranged from very-low-light situations (dark hallway in my apartment) to relatively bright outdoor shots (overcast day, parking lot on edge of forest).First the pros.,-1,1
2020,1,5,The 12x zoom was nice.,-1,1
2020,1,6,Color accuracy is better than my old camera.,-1,1
2020,1,7,The settings only went down to ISO 100, but that's acceptable.,-1,1
2020,1,8,I consider megapixel count to be irrelevant; anything above 8 MP is good enough in my book.,-1,1
2020,1,9,The IS feature seemed to work well enough, but my hands are pretty stable so my opinion might not count in this matter.Now the cons.,-1,1
2020,1,10,In a word: NOISE.,-1,1
2020,1,11,On the camera's built-in screen, everything seemed fine at first sight.,-1,1
2020,1,12,But zooming in, I began to notice the extreme amount of noise present in nearly all the pictures.,-1,1
2020,1,13,Even at ISO 100, the noise was still painfully obvious -- and that's just on the camera's LCD screen.,-1,1
2020,1,14,Viewing the pictures on my computer merely exacerbated the problem -- even monochromatic objects shot under good lighting conditions exhibited innumerable slightly off-color pixel bunches.,-1,1
2020,1,15,Textured objects fared much worse, to the point of becoming blurry and riddled with what seemed to be noise removal artifacts.,-1,1
2020,1,16,I had problems with noise on my EX-Z1000, but never to this extent; if I didn't know better I'd swear that the 520 HS is trying *too* hard to eliminate noise, which actually results in *more* noise.,-1,1
2020,1,17,The noise issue was so bad it made the camera's other shortcomings (somewhat confused autofocus, relatively weak flash) seem insignificant.,-1,1
2020,1,18,If you plan on printing out photos at the standard 4R size, then this might not be an issue.,-1,1
2020,1,19,But if, like me, you like to set your photos as desktop wallpapers (or print them at larger sizes) then look elsewhere for your camera needs.,-1,1
2020,1,20,As for me, I'm returning this camera.,-1,1
2021,1,0,Good Low Light Focus.,-1,1
2021,1,1,I bought the camera to replace a 10 year old Canon S1 IS and I was a little disappointed with some of the features.,-1,1
2021,1,2,The one feature I really appreciate is the Low Light Focus of the camera in full zoom.,-1,1
2021,1,3,My S1 was pretty useless at full zoom unless it was bright sunlight, but the ELPH 520ES is excellent.The cons are that it isn't as sharp as I expected.,-1,1
2021,1,4,I have it set to the highest resolution but the photos are not top notch whenshown full screen on my monitor and they are a little weak on my printer.The camera is VERY small and LIGHT and I am having a major problem shooting Video.,-1,1
2021,1,5,I guess I'm just too shakey, but all of my Videos are almost at the point of being annoying to watch with the movement of the camera.,-1,1
2021,1,6,I am an old man though, almost 80, and that just may be my problem.,-1,1
2021,1,7,I believe that a view finder would probably solve most of my problems but alas, there is none.,-1,1
2021,1,8,I have to look at the screen and if I try to zoom in while shooting, it is laughable.,-1,1
2021,1,9,I guess I just need to use a tripod while shooting video, but that would only solve the problem half the time.,-1,1
2021,1,10,When I move, it really gets bad.Overall, I am satisfied with the camera, but I still use my S1 for Video when I am walking because it has a viewfinder.,-1,1
2022,1,0,Wanted this as replacement for Elph SD780, but not a big enough improvement.,-1,1
2022,1,1,I bought this as a replacement for my old Canon Elph SD780 IS (at least four years old).,-1,1
2022,1,2,I spent an afternoon taking side-by-side shots with the new camera, my old Elph, and my iPhone.The pros:- It takes beautiful pictures if you're going to use them small.,-1,0
2022,1,3,Colors/exposure are great - what I've come to expect from Canon.-,-1,0
2022,1,4,Interface is great - minimal - excellent ease-of-use.-,-1,0
2022,1,5,Big display is nice.The cons:- The pictures are VERY GRAINY at anything but the smallest sizes.,-1,0
2022,1,6,In my tests, my old camera had LESS grain on some of the shots, and in low light even my iPhone had less grain.-,-1,0
2022,1,7,The squared off edges of the camera made it feel a little bulky, believe it or not.,-1,0
2022,1,8,My old Elph was the same size, but the edges were rounded, so for some reason it feels much smaller.The bottom line:- I returned the camera, as it just wasn't enough of an improvement over my 4-year-old Elph.,-1,0
2022,1,9,However, if you don't have a 4-year-old Elph, and don't mind the grain in your photos, it's amazing how much technology they pack into this little camera, making it easy to use, and easy to get great color/exposure in your photos.,-1,0
2023,1,0,** Bad for video!!,-1,1
2023,1,1,Only read if you are buying for primarily video / vlog / vlogging *** I have to give this product one star.,-1,1
2023,1,2,I feel bad doing this, but if you are like me and only plan on using the camera for video vlogs / vlogging, you will be disappointed.,-1,1
2023,1,3,I bought this camera because its small form factor and the video specifications, on paper, is an improvement compared to the ELPH 330 HS.,-1,1
2023,1,4,On paper, the 520 HS is superior in that it can record 1080p@30fps vs the 330 HS's 720p@30fps.,-1,1
2023,1,5,It is newer than the 330 HS, and its base price is higher.,-1,1
2023,1,6,There are positive reviews all over the web and there are not many negative reviews.,-1,1
2023,1,7,I could not, however, find reviews that specifically target video.,-1,1
2023,1,8,So I went for the 520 and hoped for the best.The camera feels solid, and I cannot knock it for its form factor and its performance when taking photos.,-1,1
2023,1,9,It seems to excel at taking photos, and its slim design makes it easy to carry in your pocket.,-1,1
2023,1,10,At first it seemed awesome as I recorded the first few videos.,-1,1
2023,1,11,I noticed that autofocus was not turned on, and I continued recording after I turned on the autofocus setting.,-1,1
2023,1,12,Once I started to edit the clips, I heard a sound that resembles a mix between a metal click and a plastic click.,-1,1
2023,1,13,At the bottom of this review I will provide a link so you can hear the sound I'm describing.,-1,1
2023,1,14,I first thought that the sound could be coming from the plastic dongle of the wrist strap hitting the side of the camera as I moved around.,-1,1
2023,1,15,It made sense and it would explain the metal / plastic sound I heard.,-1,1
2023,1,16,After removing the strap, however, the sound continued.,-1,1
2023,1,17,I noticed that the microphone is embedded into the metal ring around the lens.,-1,1
2023,1,18,Usually the microphone is under the flash (as in the 330 HS).,-1,1
2023,1,19,This small difference actually makes a rather large impact on the audio quality and makes the 520 HS's microphone super sensitive to any motion of the lens.Once I became aware of the root cause, I searched for any reviews that referenced the same problem.,-1,1
2023,1,20,I found only one review that I would consider a trustworthy source (PC magazine-  [...] )  PC magazine hit the nail on the head and noticed the issue, but since they were mostly focused on photo specs, the problem only received one sentence in their page long review.,-1,1
2023,1,21,Here is what PC magazine says: “The camera can zoom and focus while recording, but the sound of its lens moving in and out is audible on the soundtrack.",-1,1
2023,1,22,I read the PC magazine review prior to purchasing this camera, but the issue did not stand out.,-1,1
2023,1,23,Furthermore, the 330 HS has the same sound issue when focusing, but the *key* difference is that the 330 HS has a faster autofocus mechanism, and on top of that, the microphone is below the flash.,-1,1
2023,1,24,Both of these factors diminish the sound from the lens in the 330 HS.,-1,1
2023,1,25,Since the microphone is literally on top of the lens in the 520 HS, the sound of the lens is amplified rather than filtered out.,-1,1
2023,1,26,It was very disappointing and I can’t believe Canon did not pick up on this during QA.,-1,1
2023,1,27,I don’t understand the benefit of moving the microphone into the lens.Lastly, I am not the only one with this problem.,-1,1
2023,1,28,There are two other popular vloggers that I know of who recently upgraded to the 520 and their initial reviews were positive.,-1,1
2023,1,29,After a few weeks of video, however, they also noticed the problem.,-1,1
2023,1,30,Since they use several different camera models simultaneously, it took longer for them to catch this issue.,-1,1
2023,1,31,During this time, however, I bought the camera.,-1,1
2023,1,32,So if you plan on buying this camera for primarily video work (such as vlogging), DON’T buy this camera!!!  Go with the 330 HS instead.-Michael,-1,1
2023,1,33,& ClaireOne of my videos that highlight the issue:  [...] (listen at 3:35 but it happens throughout the video).,-1,1
2024,1,0,Camera broke after a month of use; Canon charges $175 for "in-warranty repair" One day the lens refused to open - simply reporting "lens error" before shutting down.,-1,1
2024,1,1,I paid to have the camera sent into their shop for an in-warranty repair (we just bought the camera recently), but they sent back an invoice for $175 plus shipping (to repair a $120 camera!) even though the camera is in warranty.Will not purchase anything from canon ever again.,-1,1
2025,1,0,Nice features and overall design, but noise level is just horrible.,-1,1
2025,1,1,I completely agree with HCedrinks's review.,-1,1
2025,1,2,"NOISE.,-1,1
2025,1,3,On the camera's built-in screen, everything seemed fine at first sight.,-1,1
2025,1,4,But zooming in, I began to notice the extreme amount of noise present in nearly all the pictures."Sadly,,-1,1
2025,1,5,my 6-year-old PowerShot SD750 is capturing better images than this camera.,-1,1
2025,1,6,I am wondering if I just got a defective camera.,-1,1
2025,1,7,I posted some sample cropped noisy images with no down-sampling in size so one can really see the noise.The navigation buttons are a bit too small for my liking, but I guess this is due to the large LCD screen taking up most of the back panel.I found this CNET review which is very much in line with my observations."The,-1,1
2025,1,8,Canon PowerShot Elph 520 HS' photo quality is good to very good, but overall disappointing compared with past HS-model Elphs.,-1,1
2025,1,9,Even at its lowest ISO settings, subjects look soft and noisy when viewed at 100 percent.,-1,1
2025,1,10,Unfortunately, that means the 10-megapixel resolution doesn't give you much room for enlarging and cropping.,-1,1
2025,1,11,At ISO 1600 and 3200, noise and noise reduction destroy fine detail, making things look soft and smeary, and you can see yellow blotching from noise.,-1,1
2026,1,0,Many photos are out of focus, poorly lit.,-1,1
2026,1,1,Was looking for a budget point and shoot to replace my Sony W290 that was stolen :(.,-1,1
2026,1,2,This one had lots of good reviews on photo sites, high ratings on amazon.,-1,1
2026,1,3,I am just a regular everyday user - i like to take photos of family, home, travel etc. i don't use any special settings or set manual controls for speed etc.I hate this camera!First - The autofocus seems very slow, and often even for still photos, the camera won't shoot a sharp photo on the first take.,-1,1
2026,1,4,I have to take several photos to get a good shot.,-1,1
2026,1,5,Between shots, the camera is slow too.,-1,1
2026,1,6,Second - Indoors, the photos are more frequently out of focus, poorly lit etc.,-1,1
2026,1,7,The flash is not even, and there is no flash override where you can force the camera to use flash in some situations, for example, backlighting.,-1,1
2026,1,8,There is either auto-flash or no flash.,-1,1
2026,1,9,The results are usually better in outdoor light.Third - the battery life is poor.,-1,1
2026,1,10,I haven't tracked closely (the specs say 190 shots per charge) but it seems I am recharging all the time.I've had this camera for less than 2 months and the lens cover just malfunctioned (doesn't close completely, doesn't open completely).,-1,1
2026,1,11,It's still under warranty but i would rather buy something else!,-1,1
2027,1,0,A Nasty Surprise with the Video Feature.,-1,1
2027,1,1,I purchased this model to replace an earlier Canon that died.,-1,1
2027,1,2,One of the important uses for me is the video feature.,-1,1
2027,1,3,I have been horrified to discover that the video automatically stops after about 10 minutes when you're shooting in high definition, even though there was plenty of room on my memory chip (purposefully large to accommodate my needs, I thought).,-1,1
2027,1,4,The first time or two it cut out, I thought maybe I'd accidentally touched a button and stopped the recording.,-1,1
2027,1,5,But no, when I searched through the fine print, I discovered this little quirk.,-1,1
2027,1,6,Since I wish to record jazz songs that might last, say, 12 or 15 minutes, this camera is now very disappointing to me and I'm sorry I bought it.,-1,1
2028,1,0,Battery Glitch ?,-1,0
2028,1,1,Have purchsed this camera a little over a month ago.,-1,0
2028,1,2,I am very pleased with the performance and quality of pictures it takes - nice!,-1,0
2028,1,3,The problem I've noticed however that when placing the battery back in the camera once it has been fully-charged (for example), it will not turn on.,-1,1
2028,1,4,I discovered that by taking the battery OUT and putting it back IN about 5-10x times, it suddenly starts to work again.,-1,1
2028,1,5,I suspect it could be a battery contact problem but am not sure?,-1,1
2028,1,6,Hopefully this is just a problem with MY camera and not a common problem with this model.,-1,1
2028,1,7,I offer this info in the event there are others who may have experienced this same problem.,-1,1
2028,1,8,I am in the process of contacting Canon Support for a replacement/repair as I still think this is a great camera.,-1,1
2029,1,0,A Disappointing Camera.,-1,0
2029,1,1,This camera was such a disappointment.,-1,0
2029,1,2,I bought it thinking it was an upgrade of my Canon PowerShot SD1100 Digital ELPH, which was a wonderful little camera.,-1,0
2029,1,3,The SD1100 was so easy to use, the menus were intuitive and easy to navigate.,-1,0
2029,1,4,The only reason I replaced it was because I wanted more zoom.,-1,0
2029,1,5,Unfortunately, with the 520, trying to get from one menu to another is incredibly time consuming and frustrating.,-1,0
2029,1,6,The pictures I managed to take were decent, no quarrel with that.,-1,0
2029,1,7,It was just difficult to use.,-1,0
2029,1,8,I would definitely not recommend the Canon PowerShot ELPH 520 to anyone.,-1,0
2030,1,0,Quality is equivalent to the price.,-1,1
2030,1,1,Photo quality was below my expectation for a Canon.,-1,1
2030,1,2,The camera body itself, however, is stunningly sleek and sharp.,-1,1
2030,1,3,If you're looking for a light carry-around camera for snapshots to post on social networking sites, this is the one to get.,-1,1
2030,1,4,I highly recommend getting a few backup batteries though, the battery life isn't enough to last even the most conservative camera user.,-1,1
2031,1,0,Form Over Function.,-1,0
2031,1,1,This is a beautifully designed, slightly retro looking camera with a metal body and precise mechanics.,-1,0
2031,1,2,After using it for a couple of weeks, I had to agree w/ some of the pro reviewers: it looks much better than it performs.,-1,1
2031,1,3,In some of the Program modes the image quality is just fine, but in the quick point and shoot Auto action, and especially when using the zoom, image focus and sharpness were hit and miss.,-1,1
2031,1,4,I have an older Panasonic Lumix (LZ3) which easily and reliably outperforms this pretty elph.If you have been wondering why the price keeps dropping, I suspect that is the reason.,-1,1
2032,1,0,I am a professional photographer and I am almost always seen lugging around my DSLR with all my lenses.,-1,1
2032,1,1,But there are times when I want a good camera, but can't carry all my equipment with me.,-1,1
2032,1,2,Enter the ELPH 520 HS.,-1,1
2032,1,3,I bought this because it was small, it has an incredible 12x optical zoom, a large LCD screen, it will "burst shoot", and it takes HD video at the touch of a button.,-1,1
2032,1,4,First of all let me say that I understand this is not a DSLR so it will never live up to those standards, however there are a few things that I felt really should have performed better:-If it isn't a bright, sunny day (or a brightly lit scene) forget trying to get ANYTHING in focus with this camera even if your subject is moving only slightly.-Even,-1,1
2032,1,5,if conditions are optimum, the image quality of this camera is only so-so.,-1,1
2032,1,6,There seems to be a lot of grain and noise and it's quite distracting.-The,-1,1
2032,1,7,HD video is very underwhelming.,-1,1
2032,1,8,The camera seemed to be confused most of the time when trying to focus.,-1,1
2032,1,9,It would constantly change focus on different subjects which I found to be absolutely maddening.,-1,1
2032,1,10,The video itself looked more like SD to me (and yes, I did check the settings to make sure I was shooting in full HD).,-1,1
2032,1,11,The camera boasts the ability to zoom in and out while filming without losing focus on the subject.,-1,1
2032,1,12,Every time I would try to adjust the zoom, the video would lose clarity and there was also the annoying sound of the motor while zooming in and out which is then recorded onto your video.,-1,1
2032,1,13,Hmmm...-The buttons are confusing.,-1,1
2032,1,14,They are placed in a strange configuration IMO and I had a hard time changing settings with any speed at all.,-1,1
2032,1,15,I realize they had to be placed this way in order to fit on the camera at all, but one thing that would have helped tremendously is to have the "SET" button in the middle of the arrow buttons like it is on most Canon PowerShot models.Overall, I would have to say that I really wouldn't recommend this camera.,-1,1
2032,1,16,I sold it after 8 months of use and went back to using my old Canon Powershot SX100 IS.,-1,1
2032,1,17,This camera may be old, but it outperforms the ELPH 520 in terms of image quality and video quality (even though it is only SD).,-1,1
2033,1,0,very low quality pictures.,-1,1
2033,1,1,Bought this recently, but will be returning soon.With all settings set to highest quality - Super Fine compression, highest resolution, neutral colors, auto WB, ISO200, - in bright light and ideal conditions for photography, the camera produces pictures that look like they've been through a Jpeg converter several times.,-1,1
2033,1,2,Whites are blown, everything but the immediate focus area is pixelated.,-1,1
2033,1,3,And all mid- to dark areas are noisy.It's like it's back to mid-1990s.Pretty useless except for making avatars for social networks.,-1,1
2034,1,0,Battery drainer.,-1,1
2034,1,1,The picture quality is very unpredictable but my main complaint is the battery drainage.,-1,1
2034,1,2,On a fully charged battery, it starts blinking low battery after shooting 5 minutes of video.,-1,1
2035,1,0,Surprisingly My Least Favorite Canon Compact.,-1,0
2035,1,1,I have always been a huge Canon fan but this camera seemed to never work very well.,-1,0
2035,1,2,The pictures just never seemed to impress me like the previous 2 canon compacts I owned.,-1,0
2035,1,3,I still love the brand but will be more skeptical in the future.,-1,0
2035,1,4,Also the black metal seems to scratch easily.,-1,0
2036,1,0,I purchased the Canon PowerShot Elph 520 HS as an upgrade to my two existing Canon cameras.,-1,1
2036,1,1,I have a Canon PowerShot SD 600 and a Canon PowerShot SX 110  IS.,-1,1
2036,1,2,Basically I wanted the PowerShot SD 600 small size and the 12 X  magnification with the image stabilization.,-1,1
2036,1,3,The PowerShot Elph 520 HS specs filled the bill.,-1,1
2036,1,4,Unfortunately, the image is grainy even with the IS turned off.,-1,1
2036,1,5,Both of my other Canon cameras have much sharper images.,-1,1
2036,1,6,I returned the camera.,-1,1
2036,1,7,Should have read the reviews on CNET besides just Amazon.,-1,1
2037,1,0,Confusing Functionality.,-1,1
2037,1,1,The functionality of the buttons on this camera is confusing.,-1,1
2037,1,2,Your "scroll left" and "scroll right" buttons are not labeled as such, and the button on the top that you push to view the photos on the camera does not take you back to camera mode when pushed again; it actually puts the camera into Sleep mode.,-1,1
2037,1,3,We were trying to figure out how to get back to Camera mode after viewing pictures, and it turns out you have to push the shutter button down halfway.,-1,1
2037,1,4,Deleting pictures is about a 3-step process.,-1,1
2037,1,5,I really am not pleased with this, and I bought it for my 78-year-old dad after reading about it on a "best cameras for senior citizens" website.,-1,1
2037,1,6,I seem to mind the confusing buttons more than he does, though.,-1,1
2037,1,7,I asked him if he wanted me to find him a different camera, and he said no.,-1,1
2038,1,0,I generally like Kodak but thought I would give Canon a try.,-1,0
2038,1,1,I am not very impressed with the quality of photos and don't use 90% of the functions.,-1,0
2038,1,2,The zoom quality is pretty good...I was able to get some neat pictures of the Blood Moon a few months ago, but otherwise it is just a basic camera.,-1,0
2038,1,3,The software comes with way too much stuff that I also don't use other than downloading the pictures to my computer.,-1,1
2038,1,4,The lens is difficult to clean when dirty but the pictures it takes are okay for basic memories.,-1,1
2039,1,0,The pictures taken are decent enough with this camera - but, I have two big issues with the ease of using this camera.,-1,1
2039,1,1,I guess I didn't read the specs closely enough, but this thing is very small.,-1,1
2039,1,2,I am an average size woman, and I feel like my fingers are constantly getting in the picture.,-1,1
2039,1,3,It feels like my hand just engulfs it.,-1,1
2039,1,4,It's kind of tough to take a picture because it is just so small to handle.,-1,1
2039,1,5,Also, I am used to using a camera with a little trash can button for disposal of photos.,-1,1
2039,1,6,This camera doesn't have it and it bothers me more than anything else about it.,-1,1
2039,1,7,To delete a picture, you have to go in through the menu file button.,-1,1
2039,1,8,I disliked this camera so much that not even 2 months later I bought a new point and shoot camera.,-1,1
2040,1,0,Good video quality.,-1,0
2040,1,1,Still pictures auto focus will not hold true focus, all looks good until you spap a picture, then it may or may not give you a clear pic.,-1,0
2040,1,2,Not all that happy so far.,-1,0
2041,1,0,Great zoom lens.,-1,1
2041,1,1,Many negatives about this camera - no good dust cover on the lens, it will be affected by dust really easily.,-1,1
2041,1,2,The buttons are way too small and the micro SD card is a pain in the neck.,-1,1
2041,1,3,HOWEVER you will LOVE the zoom on this camera.,-1,0
2041,1,4,I have already taken some great pictures of wildlife.,-1,0
2042,1,0,Good zoom, but needs higher resolution and more robustness.,-1,0
2042,1,1,Second day I used the camera on a 3-week trip and it got dropped.,-1,0
2042,1,2,Screen got multiple cracks, but still worked.,-1,1
2042,1,3,Have had several previous similar Canon cameras, dropped them all a number of times and never cracked a screen.The lens cover looks cool, but the fan blade shaped cover looks delicate.,-1,1
2042,1,4,By the end of the 3-weeks of heavy use it would frequently not completely close.Zoom and other features are very nice, but I have to use the Large format setting to get a decent resolution and 2-2.5 MB picture.,-1,0
2043,1,0,I had a Canon Power Shot before this one that I liked alot better ~ took great pictures.,-1,0
2043,1,1,This one ~ not so good.,-1,1
2043,1,2,Consequently I use my phone camera the most.,-1,1
2043,1,3,I was hoping this would have sharper pictures.,-1,1
2044,1,0,The worst battery I ever have.,-1,1
2044,1,1,I was very happy on first day when camera arrived, but the battery died on me at next day.,-1,1
2044,1,2,Few seconds before, it shows full bars, then, suddenly blacked out.,-1,1
2044,1,3,I thought I got a bad battery, After Amazon kindly refund me $30 for it, I ordered an extra pair of them.,-1,1
2044,1,4,some reviews mentioned the battery problem, is really that bad?,-1,1
2044,1,5,Hope some pro can help me.,-1,1
2045,1,0,Not what I expected.,-1,1
2045,1,1,I had another Canon Powershot that "drowned" when I fell through the ice on a frozen lake (that's another story).,-1,1
2045,1,2,I bought this thinking it would be a suitable, maybe even superior replacement.,-1,1
2045,1,3,I could not tell from the info given in the on-line ad that the SD card is a micro instead of standard.,-1,1
2045,1,4,Also, the battery is different than my other Powershot.,-1,1
2045,1,5,So that is two new things to buy (I go into the wilderness for a week at a time so always need a backup battery and prefer to have a backup SD card).,-1,1
2045,1,6,The edges on the camera are very sharp compared to my previous camera where they were rounded.,-1,1
2045,1,7,Since I carry my camera in my pocket, the rounded edges are preferred.,-1,1
2045,1,8,Finally, and most importantly, the photos aren't of the quality that I expect from a Canon product.,-1,1
2045,1,9,Disappointing.,-1,1
2046,1,0,Nice images but TOO SMALL!,-1,0
2046,1,1,While the picture quality was good, the camera itself was simply too small to be easy to handle and use.,-1,0
2046,1,2,We ended up returning the camera.,-1,1
2047,1,0,I bought this camera to shoot close-up nature shots (ie.,-1,1
2047,1,1,It is small and light enough to fit in my pocket and quickly pull out when the moment presents itself.,-1,0
2047,1,2,It seemed like the perfect camera.,-1,0
2047,1,3,The reality is, unfortunately, that the picture quality  is unimpressive, almost not worth the bother.,-1,1
2047,1,4,I gave it two stars for picture quality  and one star for its compact design.,-1,1
2047,1,5,Doesn't hold a candle to the image quality and features on my Canon 300HS.,-1,1
2047,1,6,I absolutely love that camera.,-1,0
2047,1,7,Problem is that it only has a 5X zoom.,-1,0
2048,1,0,Canon PowerShot ELPH 520 HS .... Nice Still Pics, Video Not So Much; File format Issues.,-1,1
2048,1,1,This camera takes nice still photos but the video leaves much to be desired.,-1,1
2048,1,2,I was quite disappointed in the quality of the video, especially when using zoom.,-1,1
2048,1,3,Also, it uses a file format that is incompatible with my Panasonic HDTV so I cannot hook it up to the tv to watch my videos.,-1,1
2048,1,4,Also, I cannot edit the video using Windows Live Movie Maker as when I try, it crashes the program.,-1,1
2048,1,5,I don't recall the format but you may want to check this out before purchasing.,-1,0
2048,1,6,If I had known the problems I was going to have, I would have purchased a Panasonic Lumix, which would have been compatible with my tv (albeit for a lot more money).,-1,0
2048,1,7,I think it cost around $100 but I was able to apply my Discover Card rewards so I only paid around $69 I believe.,-1,0
2048,1,8,Pros:  Small and portable; 12x zoom; nice still picks; nice looking camera and easy to use; affordable.,-1,0
2048,1,9,Cons:  Poor video and file format that can be a problem, depending on the devices your hooking it up to.,-1,1
2049,1,0,Terrible Quality.,-1,1
2049,1,1,Ordered this camera for a trip.,-1,1
2049,1,2,It worked for a few shots and the lens got stuck and it stopped working entirely with electronics meltdown.,-1,1
2049,1,3,Quality of the build was extremely poor.,-1,1
2049,1,4,Unfortunately my last two experiences with Canon have been disappointing.,-1,1
2050,1,0,ELPH POWER SHOT.,-1,1
2050,1,1,I PURCHASED THE ELPH POWER SHOT BECUSE OF ITS CONVENIENT SIZE AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH MY CANON CAMERAS----I AM SURPRISED THAT THIS CAMERA IS MORE DIFFICULT TO USE RATHER THAN EASIER---IN AN EFFORT TO ELIMINATE BUTTONS ON THE CAMERA YOU NEED TO USE FEWER BUTTONS ---THIS IS NOT EASY TO DO CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE CAMERA----MY OLD CANON WAS MUCH EASIER TO USE ----,-1,1
2051,1,0,Good be better.,-1,1
2051,1,1,I would have rated this camera higher, but I don't like the Micro SD card--it is easy to lose.,-1,1
2051,1,2,Also, the camera is slow to reset after you take a picture.,-1,1
2052,1,0,First of all, the camera does take great pictures.,-1,0
2052,1,1,However, it's just not that easy to figure out all of the different settings.,-1,0
2052,1,2,I bought it for my wife because she wanted something that she could carry with her every day to take pictures of the kids.,-1,0
2052,1,3,This is perfect for that.,-1,0
2052,1,4,All we had before was my professional larger camera so this is great for everyday shots.,-1,0
2052,1,5,If you can afford to spend a little more money, go for the ELPH that is completely a touch screen.,-1,1
2052,1,6,From what I've read, it'll be easier to maneuver and the pictures will turn out just as good as this one.,-1,1
2053,1,0,The camera stopped working after only 2 months for no obvious reason and I was refused a refund or an exchange.,-1,1
2053,1,1,Stopped working 2 months later for now obvious reason and they refused to refund the money back, because the time for returns was over according to the policy, but this should be in case the customer just "didn't like it" or "change their mind" for no reason, and NOT when the merchandise not working anymore after only 2 months.,-1,1
2054,1,0,Already has required service.,-1,1
2054,1,1,Camera has already required service once.,-1,1
2054,1,2,Also, the 'manual controls' for things like aperture and shutter speed are limited.,-1,1
2054,1,3,Can't recommend.,-1,1
2055,1,0,too much noise in low light.,-1,1
2055,1,1,decent picture quality in broad day light, but not indoors.,-1,1
2055,1,2,In general, Image is simply not sharp enough.,-1,1
2055,1,3,I had to return it.,-1,1
2056,1,0,Did not meet expectations :( This camera did not meet my expectations but it was a good price.,-1,0
2056,1,1,Mainly, I am not pleased with shots with movement, they come out blurry.,-1,0
2056,1,2,I do like the HD video option, however.,-1,0
2056,1,3,The picture quality is OK but not great.,-1,0
2057,1,0,I Hate this Canon Power Elph.,-1,1
2057,1,1,I am on vacation in NM and this camera has ruined my vacation, the battery and charger are defective and will not hold a chargeor maybe it's the camera that is defective, as soon as I get back to California, I am going to return the whole thing back to Amazon,Please let me know, if you received this message.Thank You,Gil Martinez,-1,1
2058,1,0,I like the size and that is about it.,-1,1
2058,1,1,The battery does not hold a charge.,-1,1
2058,1,2,The buttons are too small and don't always respond to touch.,-1,1
2058,1,3,It does not work when the temperatures drop (so much for ski pictures).,-1,1
2058,1,4,Have to allow a lot of time for the zoom to zoom and then it is usually too late to get the picture.,-1,1
2058,1,5,Unable to see anything in the LCD screen in the vertical position.,-1,1
2058,1,6,I like the LCD screen in the horizontal position and I like the size.,-1,1
2058,1,7,The pictures are fair to good but haven't had anything great yet.,-1,1
2058,1,8,It is not compatible with Picasa  and can't play the movies - very jerky.,-1,1
2058,1,9,Pretty much requires 2 hands to switch to movie mode.,-1,1
2058,1,10,The reason I bought the camera was for the movie mode feature and taking movies turned out to be the most disappointing thing about the camera.,-1,1
2059,1,0,Below average.,-1,0
2059,1,1,Not happy with the picture quality.,-1,0
2059,1,2,Pictures seems to be out of focus and not well lit.,-1,0
2060,1,0,not the same quality as in the past.,-1,0
2060,1,1,not the same quality as in the past.,-1,0
2060,1,2,The case is plastic & it take a micro chip.,-1,1
2060,1,3,I didn't even know there were micro chips.,-1,1
2060,1,4,I returned it.,-1,1
2060,1,5,Great seller though.,-1,0
2061,1,0,Too small.,-1,1
2061,1,1,.The camera was smaller than appeared in the advertisement.Buttons were tiny and wrong ones easily pushed.Directions difficult to understand.,-1,1
2062,1,0,I REALLY wanted to love this camera.,-1,1
2062,1,1,I had high hopes when I received the camera.,-1,1
2062,1,2,I printed and read the manual with the camera in my hand going through everything.Immediately had issues with the image stabilization.,-1,1
2062,1,3,I re-read the manual and googled the issue trying to find out what I was doing wrong.,-1,1
2062,1,4,Came to realization that it wasn't me, it's the camera.,-1,1
2062,1,5,Luckily it is within the return window so hopefully there won't be any issues on receiving a refund.A replacement wasn't offered.,-1,1
2062,1,6,Not sure I would want one, a little leary of the the model now.,-1,1
2063,1,0,It was a nice size for slipping into a pocket or purse, but the battery situation was not suitable.,-1,0
2063,1,1,It didn't have some of the features I was looking for.,-1,1
2063,1,2,I like to have batteries that are easily replaced, not one that has to be recharged.,-1,1
2063,1,3,I also like to be able to store the battery in the camera when not in use.,-1,1
2063,1,4,The battery for this camera needed to be removed when not in use.,-1,1
2064,1,0,Super little camera - "little" being the operative word!,-1,0
2064,1,1,I have had a number of small cameras, mostly Canon, (I always carry a little digital in my purse, especially since I am a grandmother!) and I wore out my last one.,-1,0
2064,1,2,I was delighted to find this one at such a good price.,-1,0
2064,1,3,I have only had this one for a short while, but so far it has lived up to my expectations, although I'm only an amateur photographer.,-1,0
2064,1,4,I would certainly recommend it.,-1,0
2065,1,0,My wife asked for a new Canon to replace the one she loved, but had been damaged.After checking the reviews we selected this one.The camera arrived and was given a quick evaluation.,-1,1
2065,1,1,My wife decided to return it due to1- weight2- size slightly bulkier than the previous Canon3 Pictures were not any betterWe bought a Cannon S100 which she loves and was cheaper!,-1,1
2066,1,0,Can't download videos to Picassa.,-1,1
2066,1,1,The battery door on my great PowerShot SD300 Digital Elph broke so I bought the 520HS.,-1,1
2066,1,2,I use the camera to take pictures and videos for my Rotary Club  and use it for personal use like everyone else.I am not able to download the videos to Picassa.,-1,1
2066,1,3,I then put the videos on my Rotary Club's website or in personal web albums.,-1,1
2066,1,4,I have never had a problem with the other camera.,-1,1
2066,1,5,With this camera you can use the supplied interface cable or as suggested by the Canon representative via a rapid-response email (which I commend) put the micro memory card in an Adapter and then download the videos to  a memory card reader  to my computer.,-1,1
2066,1,6,Well that didn't work either.,-1,1
2066,1,7,It will download to Canon's software but that doesn't help me.,-1,1
2066,1,8,I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem?,-1,1
2066,1,9,I did not read any customer reviews regarding downloading the videos.Also, when you view and listen to the video on the camera the speaker is in the front of the camera and you have to put your ear to the front of the camera to hear anything.,-1,1
2066,1,10,- No I don't have a hearing problem, and I did turn the volume up but I really don't think that control increases the volume much if any.,-1,1
2066,1,11,Why would they put the speaker on the front of the camera while you are looking at the video on the back of the camera?,-1,1
2066,1,12,It doesn't make sense.Before I bought the camera I did read the  customer reviews on Amazon (Amazon did have the best price) and knew to buy a Micro memory card.So has anyone had the same problem I have with downloading videos to Picassa?I can't be the only one.Is the internal video formatting different than  in the older but dependable (except for the broken door which prevents the camera from being operated) camera?,-1,1
2066,1,13,If I can't download to Picassa this camera is nice looking  but is totally useless for transferring videos! - Help,-1,1
2067,1,0,No memory card, no camera.,-1,1
2067,1,1,I really cannot rate this camera precisely, because none of the memory cards worked for this particular camera.,-1,1
2067,1,2,This camera cannot function without a memory card.,-1,1
2068,1,0,Good product, but...,-1,0
2068,1,1,I received the product and seemed to be a very good product.,-1,0
2068,1,2,But the problem is that it does not come with the memory card and in any place figures the model of the memory.,-1,1
2068,1,3,So I've got the product, but I can't use it because I don't have the memory and I don't know which to buy...,-1,1
2069,1,0,Not as Good as Other HP's I've Had.,-1,0
2069,1,1,It has a number of pluses:  1) An optical zoom that flows right into the digital zoom (and with up to 56X you can really get close), 2)  An easy-to-use display menu, 3) A viewfinder that adjusts to ones particular eye strength.,-1,0
2069,1,2,On the negative side:  1) It takes too long to take a picture (after you press the shutter release, it is 2-4 seconds before you can take another picture (I do not know if this causes one to get blurry pictures, but at the 2.0 megapixel size (1.2 MB) for this camera and my HP 912, I had fewer blurry pictures with my HP 912 Photosmart camera), 2) You have to be within an inch of the viewfinder before it "turns on" (you can have the view show on the large display, but that uses more energy, and you still don't see if it is focused right), 3) It allows for several focus points, but even after adjusting to a center one, I still had some pictures where the background was in focus, but my subject wasn't.I know that I'll probably be in the minority of the reviewers, but to sum it up, if I had it all over to do again, I wouldn't get this particular camera.,-1,1
2069,1,3,About the same time as I got this camera, I bought the HP Photosmart 720 as a gift for my step-daughter.,-1,1
2069,1,4,While it doesn't have anywhere the zoom power of the 850 and only has 3.3 megapixels, it also doesn't have the other problems with the 850 that I mentioned above.,-1,1
2070,1,0,Digicams still an immature product offering.,-1,1
2070,1,1,If you don't have a pressing reason to buy digital right now, I suggest you wait another year.,-1,1
2070,1,2,I have used several friends and family member's cameras, and purchased the 850, all have problems.,-1,1
2070,1,3,Biggest disappointment with this camera for me is image quality.,-1,1
2070,1,4,Almost every shot has purple fringing, and clarity is a bit less than my father's fuji 3800 (3MPixels), and brother's year old Cannon 3Mpixel/3x camera.,-1,1
2070,1,5,This is true even at ISO 100, on a tripod, with good light -- even worse otherwise.,-1,1
2070,1,6,Other people's complaints are all true too: Cranky zoom, Software Crashes, etc.,-1,1
2070,1,7,One thing not mentioned is that you can't adjust the LCD display for viewing angle.,-1,1
2070,1,8,If you are above the camera (like if you set it on the floor to take a picture) you can't see the display.,-1,1
2070,1,9,"Auto" white balance is not really auto, "fixed" would be more like it.,-1,0
2070,1,10,If you are under electric lights, you have to change setting manually to get good color.Battery life complaint is not valid though.,-1,0
2070,1,11,Get good batteries (1800mah or >), and they will normally last all day, then plug camera in to ac adapter at night and you are ready to go in the morning, don't even have to remove batteries.One really nice thing is unlike other cameras, simply plugging the camera into the computer will download all the pictures with NO intervention required on your part.Despite my gripes, this seems like the best the state of the art has to offer at this time and price point for overall issues I care about, and is good enough to switch away from film for.,-1,0
2070,1,12,To get a really nice camera right now it seems you have to spend about $...., sigh.You may want to consider fuji s602 though.,-1,0
2070,1,13,Some discounters sell it for around $....Wish list: Eliminate digital zoom.,-1,1
2070,1,14,Full manual control using SLR type barrel rings.,-1,1
2070,1,15,Who needs a motor to zoom?,-1,1
2070,1,16,Costs more, works worse.,-1,1
2070,1,17,HP EVF better than most, but still worse than instamatic like glass view finder.,-1,1
2070,1,18,Save the money, keep it simple.,-1,1
2070,1,19,Should take larger memory cards, limited to 128M.,-1,1
2071,1,0,The best & worst digital camera...,-1,0
2071,1,1,This is the perfect digital camera -- but only if you're using a tripod to photograph still life scenes!,-1,0
2071,1,2,The 4.1 resolution is amazing, the exterior screen is big & bright, and the menu system is easy to follow.,-1,0
2071,1,3,However, AVIOD THIS CAMERA if you want to photograph anything that is moving or even alive and standing still!,-1,1
2071,1,4,Press the shutter, and the camera screen goes black for 2-3 seconds BEFORE recording the image.,-1,1
2071,1,5,If your subject moves, or if your hands move slightly while holding the black screen to your face for the next several seconds, you won't get the image you wanted.,-1,1
2071,1,6,You will miss "the moment" and your careful composition will probably move one direction or the other.,-1,1
2071,1,7,We tried taking pictures of family members opening Christmas presents, but the camera didn't actually record an image until people were reaching for their next gift.,-1,1
2071,1,8,We're going to Hawaii and hope to photograph whales, but with this camera we would have to press the shutter before the whale even got to the water's surface, and then point in the right direction while looking at black screen!!  Incredibly frustrating to return a camera that had such promise!,-1,1
2072,1,0,Could have been the worlds best mid priced digital camera.,-1,0
2072,1,1,Takes excellent pictures sometimes.,-1,0
2072,1,2,Wonderful zoom lens.Intuitive menu system.,-1,1
2072,1,3,Nice flash.,-1,1
2072,1,4,Takes nice movies as good or better maybe even than my nikon 5700.,-1,1
2072,1,5,Forget about taking still pictures of anything that moves.,-1,1
2072,1,6,Other reviews coverd this topic and i agree with them.,-1,1
2072,1,7,As far as i could tell there was no manual focus option.,-1,1
2072,1,8,That would have solved a lot of problems i think.,-1,1
2072,1,9,When i tried to use aperature priorty mode, i was looking for a workaround the focus problems.,-1,1
2072,1,10,Sometimes camera would lock up when i did this and you couldnt turn it off even with the main switch.,-1,1
2072,1,11,You had to remove the batteries.,-1,1
2072,1,12,I managed to take a picture of a humming bird with this camera but it took about 8 attempts.,-1,1
2072,1,13,He was a cooperative hummingbird i guess.,-1,1
2073,1,0,Not ready for Prime time.,-1,0
2073,1,1,I have owned a lot of HP products and loved them including several HP digital cameras.,-1,0
2073,1,2,THis one has a lot of great features however, the trouble is that they don't all come together in a usable product.,-1,0
2073,1,3,If you need a point and shoot camrea this is not your product.,-1,0
2073,1,4,Great zoom but by the time you want to take the picture the subject is gone.,-1,0
2074,1,0,Batteries are a huge problem and the Shutter Speed too.,-1,1
2074,1,1,Bateries are spent too fast.,-1,1
2074,1,2,Moreover, when the batteries are spent the camera freezes and will not work again--even if directly connected through the AC adapter or dock, and even with *new* batteries.,-1,1
2074,1,3,Got a replacement from HP but the problem persists.,-1,1
2074,1,4,Will try to return it for a second time and exchange it for something that really works.Also, the shutter's time response is too slow and all the pictures are taken a second later than when you press the shutter--in other words, you can't time the taking of the picture and must rely on *luck* to get a good shot.,-1,1
2075,1,0,Needs an optical viewfinder.,-1,0
2075,1,1,Good camera---but--- there is no way to follow the subject and coupled with the delay the subject may be out of the frame by the time the shot is made.,-1,1
2075,1,2,I would not buy again forn this reason.,-1,1
2076,1,0,computer connection problem.,-1,1
2076,1,1,The camera does not connect to my computer.,-1,1
2076,1,2,The USB wire that comes with the camera plugs into the camera well of course, but the other end of the wire is almost square and cannot plug into my computer's USB ports, which are very rectangular holes.,-1,1
2076,1,3,My computer is a very mainstream laptop pc by Toshiba, which i bought new in about 2009.aside:,-1,1
2076,1,4,On the positive side, the HP Photo & Imaging software did install successfully to Windows 7, even though only older versions of Windows are listed on the cdrom.,-1,1
2077,1,0,Complete tease!Takes spectacular photos; operates deplorably.,-1,0
2077,1,1,This camera when it works takes spectacular photographs.,-1,0
2077,1,2,Superior quality.,-1,0
2077,1,3,However, this camera's reliability in terms of operation is awful.,-1,0
2077,1,4,It burns through batteries as if they were candy.,-1,1
2077,1,5,I always have had to have extra batteries on hand.,-1,1
2077,1,6,More significantly, the camera refuses to turn on at times (even with fresh batteries).,-1,1
2077,1,7,It also refuses to retract its lenses when turned off sometimes as well.,-1,1
2077,1,8,I am completely frustrated with this camera.,-1,1
2077,1,9,It now refuses to work at all despite seemingly operating correctly.,-1,1
2077,1,10,The quality of this product surprised me given my previous complete satisfaction with other HP products.,-1,1
2078,1,0,Disappointing Performance.,-1,1
2078,1,1,Great specs, but poor implementation.The digital zoom is terribly slow, and you won't want to use it anyway due to the poor quality pictures it produces.The 4 AA batteries make the camera fairly heavy, but it still feels cheaply made and bulky.,-1,1
2078,1,2,The viewfinder is a bit too small for my taste.I bought one and immediately returned it after a couple of hours of testing it out.,-1,1
2078,1,3,It just wasn't the camera for me.,-1,1
2079,1,0,Don't bother buying this Item.,-1,1
2079,1,1,Looks nice !!!You can't own enough batteries to make this thing work for any small amount of time..with charging dock and full batteries.. this will suck the energy out before you get 10 shots off.. then you need to shut down and wait till it gives enough energy to take more pictures..Have found this to be a major pain in the Butt...Lucky to get a dozen shots and forget about using the MPEG mode.I should send the entire package back as one big load of garbage.Rick - FLWineGuy,-1,1
2080,1,0,Insatiable battery eater.,-1,1
2080,1,1,Beware; this camera eats batteries.,-1,1
2080,1,2,You would not want to take this camera on a backpacking trip.,-1,1
2080,1,3,Within a week (and about a dozen photos) I had to replace the batteries 3 times.,-1,1
2080,1,4,The camera was warm to the touch even when off.,-1,1
2080,1,5,HP technical support said that the batteries should be removed after every use and that they can only be expected to last 1 day (alkaline) to 2 or 3 days (rechargeables) with the camera off (although the manual didn't mention this limitation).,-1,1
2080,1,6,I've had several other digital cameras (Kodak DC 240 Zoom, Olympus C2100 UltraZoom, Olympus C-740), and none of them have had this problem.,-1,1
2080,1,7,I'd recommend the C-740 instead of this camera.,-1,1
2081,1,0,Best Low Light Performance.,-1,1
2081,1,1,The F30 continues in the F10 tradition.,-1,1
2081,1,2,After years of trying to hype up interest in their cameras with SuperCCD claims of 12 MPs etc But falling completely short with excess noise, Fuji has come out with a decent camera this time.,-1,1
2081,1,3,This camera compares very well to the higher megapixel cameras like the Canon SD550 and the Sony W70.Fuji succeeded in besting the previous FinePix F10 which was well liked for the quality of its high ISO upto 800 ISO images.,-1,1
2081,1,4,The F30 as about a stop better in terms of image quality.,-1,1
2081,1,5,So at ISO 800 the images are similar to ISO 400 images on the F10.,-1,1
2081,1,6,Higher ISO increases the sensitivity of the sensor to light but at a cost of increased noise.Generally the image sensors in digital cameras can be adjusted so that the ISO setting can be increased by simply amplifying the output of the image sensor, which increases image noise, sometimes beyond the level that is acceptable.,-1,1
2081,1,7,Just as in photographic film, greater sensitivity comes with some loss of image quality, though this is visible as noise rather than grain.Here in the Fuji F30, even ISO 1600 is usable.,-1,1
2081,1,8,However, note that ISO 3200 images do suffer from noise artifacts.,-1,1
2081,1,9,You are not going to notice any of this for small prints but not for prints above 8x10.,-1,1
2081,1,10,However no other small point and shoot digicam offers ISO 3200 - in fact not even DSLRs like Canon Rebel 350XD does this..I think its closest competitors are the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX01, Sony W100 and the Canon SD630 all of which are priced slightly lower than the Fuji and have some really compelling features.,-1,1
2081,1,11,The Panasonic even has image stabilization which this F30 does not have.Here are the PROS (Good Things)1)The F30 is almost identical in shape and weight to its predecessor, the F10 except for that it's a bit more rounded.,-1,1
2081,1,12,In size, it is in between compact and ultra-compact.,-1,1
2081,1,13,It is similar in size to the Canon SD550.,-1,1
2081,1,14,It has a nice sturdy metal body, although not as sleek as and thicker than the Canon SD line  but an improvement over the F102) Very low noise upto ISO 800 although has purple fringing on some pictures.,-1,1
2081,1,15,The ISO1600 on the F30 is far less nosiy than the ISO1000 on the new Sony cameras.3),-1,1
2081,1,16,Low light: This is the main feature and this little camera has actually usable ISO 1600 settings.,-1,1
2081,1,17,In some cases (not all) this eliminates the need for the the image stablization.,-1,1
2081,1,18,I have not been able to find a better point and shoot at ISO1600 which is only avaible on DSLR.4),-1,1
2081,1,19,Very good battery life.,-1,1
2081,1,20,Fuji says 580 pictures per charge...really good for this small camera.,-1,1
2081,1,21,I got about 300 pictures for a charge5) Priced very well if you take a lot of pictures in the nightclubs and parties.6),-1,1
2081,1,22,Finally a good movie mode (at 640 x 480 and very crisp 30 fps)Here are the CONS (BAD Things)1) Uses those pesky SLOWWW xD cards which are harder to find, more expensive and smaller capacities than the SD cards.,-1,1
2081,1,23,In comparison to performance.,-1,1
2081,1,24,xD is slow, low capacity, and overall really dumb(only on Fuji and Oly cams, while SD are in... everything).,-1,1
2081,1,25,A lot of my friends were planning to buy the F30, but really upset at the xD flash format.2),-1,1
2081,1,26,No optical viewfinder.,-1,1
2081,1,27,This will come back to haunt you in bright sunlight when the LCD gets completely washed out.3),-1,1
2081,1,28,Really stupid design flaw of the use of a propreitary Fuji USB cable.,-1,1
2081,1,29,Thanks for getting rid of the dock/adapter from the F10 for any of the ports, including USB, A/V out, or Power.4),-1,1
2081,1,30,Hard to use menu system.,-1,1
2081,1,31,Canon and Sony totally blow away this camera is ease of use menu system5) Manual controls are better than the F10 but not as good as the Canon manual control.,-1,1
2081,1,32,Not all combinations are available in all exposure modes.,-1,1
2081,1,33,Fuji tries too hard to make their cameras as "idiot proof" as possible, which tends to be frustrating for more advanced shooters.,-1,1
2081,1,34,Getting the settings you want takes a bit of menu changes and mode switching...but you are buying this camera for its point and shoot capabilities and not manual controls.. right !!6) Lens is not wide-angle as compared to the Panasonic which starts out at 28 mm.,-1,1
2081,1,35,The Fuji starts out at a longer 36 mm which are not very useful for wide angle work.7),-1,1
2081,1,36,Autofocus did not work very well for me.,-1,1
2081,1,37,It was slow and tended to search and then it picked the wrong points.8),-1,1
2081,1,38,Does not have IMAGE stablization.,-1,1
2081,1,39,Fuji tries to compete with Panasonic and misrepresents the camera by labeling a mode as "Picture Stabilization".,-1,1
2081,1,40,However this is not an optical image stabilization system.,-1,1
2081,1,41,Just a really dumb confusing mode which adjusts the ISO setting (from ISO 100 to ISO 3200) to give a shutter speed fast enough to eliminate blur due to camera shake.9),-1,1
2081,1,42,Oddly enough, not as good on outdoor bright sunny days as it is indoors /at night.,-1,1
2081,1,43,THe tonal curves produce images that lack highlight or shadow detail.,-1,1
2081,1,44,There is also a huge tendency to over expose in most of the outdoor pictures.,-1,1
2081,1,45,On large blow-ups (13x19 and above), the colors appear to be kind of "smeared".,-1,1
2081,1,46,Skin tones appear to be little funny at lower ISOs and with flash.,-1,1
2081,1,47,Some pictures are too contrasty and over-saturated, so details gets lost.,-1,1
2081,1,48,Canon pictures are a lot more crisper.10),-1,1
2081,1,49,Controls are very limited.. for example no flash power control.11),-1,1
2081,1,50,Canon has a nice one which plugs right into the wall with built-in prongs.12),-1,1
2081,1,51,Built-in flash is weak.. even weaker than the f10 and you cannot attach an external flash13) Made in China.,-1,1
2081,1,52,The older models F10 etc were made in Japan.,-1,1
2081,1,53,This F30 model is now made in China.,-1,1
2081,1,54,I dont know if this will have an impact on quality.Overall this camera depends on your needs.. if you do a lot of outdoor shooting, go for the Panasonic or the Canons..,-1,1
2081,1,55,If you do about 70 - 80% of your shooting at night events and parties then this Fuji is for you.,-1,1
2081,1,56,In summary its best feature is its low-light capability and its biggest flaw is the xD cards.,-1,1
2081,1,57,I also stay away from any cameras from Olympus which uses the same small capacity slow but expensive xD cards.,-1,1
2082,1,0,A Mixed Bag: Big strengths paired with big weaknesses.,-1,1
2082,1,1,You've read the reviews.,-1,1
2082,1,2,So let me get straight to the point: My Fuji FinePix F30 observations:First off, I'm not sure why people loathe the XD format.,-1,1
2082,1,3,I purchased a current-generation, high-speed 1 Gig XD card for about $30 a year or so ago -- not much more than its SD counterpart.Second, I must mention that the video mode on this camera is absolutely phenomenal for a digital camera -- complete with stereo sound!Third, the battery life, at 500+ shots per charge, is astounding.,-1,1
2082,1,4,(I wish cell phone batteries lasted this long!)With,-1,1
2082,1,5,respect to flash performance, the Fuji FinePix F30 is also a lot better in macro mode than other digital cameras I own (three presently).,-1,1
2082,1,6,Specifically, the flash doesn't wash everything out because it stomps down in anticipation that the subject will be close to the lens -- which helps improve image detail and color accuracy in ways I have not been able to obtain with other cameras I've owned or used.,-1,1
2082,1,7,Color reproduction, with or without flash, is also a strong point.,-1,1
2082,1,8,Even difficult to capture colors, such as those on the feathering of my Budgerigars, are true-to-life -- something that none of my film shots, let alone my digital cameras, ever accomplished.,-1,1
2082,1,9,Likewise, image noise is surprisingly low, which helps bring out the detail -- providing you don't lose them to overexposure or motion blur, which will be the focus of the remainder of this review.DPREVIEW, among other professional digital camera review sites, has mentioned, but underemphasized, IMHO, a tendency for image exposure to vary considerably -- even when shooting the same scene back-to-back.,-1,1
2082,1,10,Sometimes auto exposure is spot-on, and sometimes not.,-1,1
2082,1,11,That being said, the F30s exposure consistency is still much improved over the F10 (had and returned three of those due to problems I ultimately attributed to inconsistent quality control, otherwise known in the digital camera world as "sample variation").,-1,1
2082,1,12,Getting back to my point, overexposure is mostly a problem under bright sun.,-1,1
2082,1,13,To one degree or another, many of the outdoor or landscape pictures shown here on Amazon demonstrate blown highlights and/or chromatic aberrations (purple fringing).,-1,1
2082,1,14,While all digital cameras suffer from this to some extent, there are others that reconcile light and dark areas of an image much better -- even so-called entry-level cameras such as the Panasonic LZ series -- that are roughly half the price.,-1,1
2082,1,15,This is not your best camera for vacation photos.,-1,1
2082,1,16,I went to a theme park, for example, and the white roller coaster tracks against a blue sky just clip off in mid air -- not during a summer at midday, but under a winter sun less than an hour before sunset!Another unfortunate surprise: The camera performs absolutely horridly inside even the slowest and brightly lit kiddie rides (regardless of setting).,-1,1
2082,1,17,The low light is not a problem as is typically the issue with competing digital cameras; rather, unlike other digital cameras I have used under the same circumstances, the focus is very easily disrupted by photographer motion.,-1,1
2082,1,18,Similarly, if you can't brace well or don't have a steady hand, this camera isn't the best choice -- ostensibly because it completely lacks true image stabilization (to help compensate for the shaking).,-1,1
2082,1,19,Consequently, inside the rides, only one out of every 10 pictures was a "keeper".,-1,1
2082,1,20,True, it's a hard situation for any camera, but I've had digital cameras as old as six years that managed to capture a higher rate -- albeit noisier -- percentage of focused images under identical shooting conditions.,-1,1
2082,1,21,The rare F30 shot that came out focused under these conditions, however, was significantly brighter looking with less image noise; however, the camera's excellent handling of low light is precisely why it is so frustrating to have such a great range of useable ISOs paired with a camera that has trouble remaining focused due to motion blur or, perhaps more accurately, anytime the scene is even slightly reframed after the initial focus object has been obtained.,-1,1
2082,1,22,The only exception to the motion=blur rule was when shooting out of a moving car (as a passenger, of course!).,-1,1
2082,1,23,My amateur guess is that auto focus to infinity helps the camera compensate.,-1,1
2082,1,24,In a theme park ride, by comparison, objects are much closer to the lens -- and not as well lit -- which probably explains why they rarely turn out no matter what automatic setting is used.On a related note, Fuji documentation for the F-series warns users that panning is not a recommended use of their cameras.,-1,1
2082,1,25,Sure enough, when I shot images of my 60-gallon aquarium, I had no success capturing the activity behind the glass.,-1,1
2082,1,26,Whereas a six-year-old camera I owned faired well shooting into an aquarium, even churning out postcard like results with modest effort, none of the Fuji F-series cameras I've used, including the F30, can produce a useable picture under like circumstances.,-1,1
2082,1,27,For this reason marine park and aquarium enthusiasts should consider a camera that handles panning better than the F30.,-1,1
2082,1,28,For similar reasons, panning to follow active subjects in close proximity would seem to preclude many situations, including sports at close range, fast moving people at dance clubs and active pets or children.Even low light use revealed its share of surprises.,-1,1
2082,1,29,Fireworks mode, as the manual states, won't work without a tripod.,-1,1
2082,1,30,As such, the anti-blur mode was my choice for hand-held fireworks shots.,-1,1
2082,1,31,(Even better for capturing fireworks is the camera's video setting.),-1,1
2082,1,32,Similarly, I shot roughly 100 pictures in dual natural light + flash mode over the holidays, yet threw out all but a handful of natural light pics.,-1,1
2082,1,33,Reason?,-1,1
2082,1,34,In default settings the camera tends to choose its unusable maximum setting indoors: ISO 3200.,-1,1
2082,1,35,(I guess the people I know don't have very well lit homes.),-1,1
2082,1,36,As a result, indoor images are never particularly crisp or accurately saturated.,-1,1
2082,1,37,Second unpleasant surprise: Outdoors at night, the moon turns into a luminous white haze -- so much so that it is barely circular in shape (using the camera in point-and-shoot mode).,-1,1
2082,1,38,Seemingly, the Fuji F30, at least in auto settings, cannot reconcile a bright full moon and dark surroundings.,-1,1
2082,1,39,Ditto for bright neon lights (Los Vegas style) or even lights in parking lots.,-1,1
2082,1,40,Light instead forms streaks, flares and gigantic halos.,-1,1
2082,1,41,To a lesser degree, the same phenomena takes place indoors: Lit floor or table lamps in my natural light images cast a diffuse glow that washed out detail in nearby people and objects.Don't get me wrong: I like the camera for what it can do that others cannot (and for its high-resolution, low-glare LCD).,-1,1
2082,1,42,So who is best suited for this camera?,-1,1
2082,1,43,Answer: Those who negate its weaknesses (in full auto) by making full use of the manual settings and features.,-1,1
2082,1,44,For those who do not have the steadiest hands, most camera know-how or just lack the patience, there are less expensive cameras to be found that will serve you nicely.,-1,1
2082,1,45,If Fuji's legendary low-light performance has you sold, however, I would say that its main strength is for still-life shots (objects, museums and the like).,-1,1
2082,1,46,A second strength is macro photography (flowers and smaller).,-1,1
2082,1,47,A third use would be relatively distant subjects (sports scenes from the stands).,-1,1
2082,1,48,I would stay away from the Fuji FinePix F30 if you live in a mostly sunny climate and intend to use it in full auto mode primarily as an outdoor camera (for vacations and the like).,-1,1
2082,1,49,Though your individual user experience will vary, it's not the do-all camera to end all searches for the perfect digital imaging tool.Bottom line?,-1,1
2082,1,50,Low light superstar or not, there's just no overlooking what I believe to be the biggest oversight of all: Lack of true gyroscopic image stabilization.,-1,1
2082,1,51,If you have a habit taking shots over your head or shooting low profile objects, pets or people, you won't be in perfect compensatory bracing form.,-1,1
2082,1,52,Similarly, hyperactive or excitable types, those who drink a lot of caffeinated drinks, or anyone who has a medical condition that causes handshake or tremor will appreciate a noticeable improvement using a digital camera, such as Panasonic or select Sony or Canon models, which supplies genuine image stabilization.,-1,1
2082,1,53,Problem is, despite the advertising, the Fuji FinePix F30 does not include an image stabilizer -- only a combination of fixed ISOs and increased shutter speeds.,-1,1
2082,1,54,It's a modest improvement over the Fuji FinePix F10, which had no anti-blur mode whatsoever, but as an owner of cameras with and without gyroscopic image stabilization I can attest to the fact that Fuji's anti-blur mode is still a poor substitution for the real thing (in terms of percentage of useable pictures, particularly under challenging shooting circumstances, such as panning to follow your subject).,-1,1
2082,1,55,Unlike gyroscopic image stabilization, which is always enabled for every setting and any picture you wish to shoot on competing cameras, the F30's anti-blur mode is only one setting of many on the camera dial, and completely inaccessible in full auto or scene modes.,-1,1
2082,1,56,Although the Fuji FinePix F30 takes many steps in the right direction, I won't be joining the "cult of Fuji" quite yet.,-1,1
2083,1,0,[Update 7/2/06: As the edits below indicate, I've decided to change my rating to 4/5 stars, but it's not possible to change this on Amazon's site.]I've had this camera for a week now.,-1,1
2083,1,1,I have mixed feelings about it.,-1,1
2083,1,2,I agree with one reviewer that this is a good camera for manual mode, or at least for semi-manual mode.,-1,0
2083,1,3,The biggest problem with this camera, in my opinion, is how the ISO settings are programmed for automatic use.,-1,0
2083,1,4,I don't recommend this model if you are looking for a "push here dummy (PhD)" camera.In Fully automatic mode, camera's firmware tends to force it to try to use the higher ISO settings.,-1,0
2083,1,5,This might be an effort to save on battery power by reducing the amount of flash required.,-1,1
2083,1,6,The result is that pictures indoors are often taken at ISO 800 or 1600 (sometimes 3200), all which produce too much noise, even though this camera does better than others in that regard--according to the F10 reviews, anyway.,-1,1
2083,1,7,I found that the camera could have done several things in fully automatic mode to enable it to take better-quality pictures: (1) it could have increased the flash power; (2) it could have opened the lens more (increased the aperture/lowered f-stop); (3) it could have reduced the shutter speed.,-1,1
2083,1,8,Since the camera was billed by Fuji as being a great one for low-light situations, I guess I can't blame them too much for this programming.To overcome this issue, I'm using semi-automatic (or semi-manual) mode.,-1,1
2083,1,9,In this mode, you can tell the camera "don't use any ISO higher than 1600" or "don't use any ISO higher than 400" or "use only this ISO (one of 100/200/400/800/1600/3200)"  [Those are all the choices.],-1,1
2083,1,10,I've set it to "at most ISO 400" mode and that seems to be a good indoor compromise.,-1,1
2083,1,11,My indoor pictures are much better now.Outdoor pictures have a similar problem.,-1,1
2083,1,12,Whereas most PhD cameras would use ISO 80 or 100 for outdoor shots, the F30 picks 200 or more.,-1,0
2083,1,13,The only way to fix this is to go into the semi-manual mode and tell the camera to use only ISO 100.I will say that the low-light mode does come in handy.,-1,0
2083,1,14,I was able to get excellent no-flash close-up shots in the evening outside.,-1,0
2083,1,15,There's no way my old Oly could do that--there would be a flash, the foreground too bright with loss of accurate color, and the background would be black.,-1,0
2083,1,16,That's where this camera (F30) excels.,-1,0
2083,1,17,[Edit on 7/2/06:  I had a chance to use this camera at my kid's show at church.,-1,0
2083,1,18,The lights were on, but the church was not brightly lit.,-1,0
2083,1,19,Still, anyone who has taken pictures in this type of environment knows that a flash is necessary, and most point and shoot cameras have a really weak flash which is virtually useless past about 10 feet.,-1,0
2083,1,20,Well, this camera's flash is no exception.,-1,0
2083,1,21,It was of no use at 20 feet.,-1,1
2083,1,22,HOWEVER, when I used the semi-automatic mode with ISO set to max 1600 and the flash intentionally suppressed, I was really surprised at the pictures I was able to get.,-1,1
2083,1,23,Very well-exposed, though somewhat noisy (grainy) because of the high sensitivity required.,-1,1
2083,1,24,I also took some pictures about 6-8 feet away with the flash in the church.,-1,1
2083,1,25,These pictures were also properly exposed: the skin tones just right and the background visible.,-1,1
2083,1,26,Most point and shoot cameras would slightly over-expose the foreground and severely underexpose the background.,-1,1
2083,1,27,I was so impressed with this performance that I've decided the camera rates a 4/5 stars.,-1,1
2083,1,28,Read the reviews carefully to see how much detail you get on those 5-star reviews.]Control,-1,1
2083,1,29,over aperture and shutter speed (in A/S mode) is nice.,-1,1
2083,1,30,Again, I think the camera could do a better job of choosing aperatures which would improve the depth of field (light permitting).I'm not thrilled with the autofocus.,-1,1
2083,1,31,In my opinion, the auto-focus is slow (yes, I have it in high-speed mode).,-1,1
2083,1,32,My 5-year old Olympus D-490 focuses as fast and with better accuracy.,-1,1
2083,1,33,The F30 has a "multi" mode for autofocus, in which it attempts to find the most prominent object in the foreground.,-1,1
2083,1,34,Accuracy in this mode is questionable.,-1,1
2083,1,35,The decison point is often flat-out wrong.The camera has problems with high-contrast (light/dark) transitions and shows considerable noise/fringing at those transitions.,-1,1
2083,1,36,I knew from reviews that the F10 has this problem but it was not so bad, from the review pics I saw.,-1,1
2083,1,37,The F30 is much worse.Size:,-1,1
2083,1,38,I don't think this is a chunky camera at all (as one reviewer described it).,-1,1
2083,1,39,It's just big enough that I can work the buttons and hang onto it.,-1,1
2083,1,40,It goes into my front jeans pocket just fine (I'm a male, though and I could understand that, with the tight jeans that females wear these days, the camera would not fit in a jeans pocket).The camera's user interface is very good.,-1,1
2083,1,41,I'm happy with that part.,-1,1
2083,1,42,The F-button is very useful for manual-mode operation.,-1,1
2083,1,43,Most operation is intuitive, or quickly becomes so.The software that comes with the camera is just plain pathetic.,-1,1
2083,1,44,I'm not going to waste my time reviewing it.,-1,1
2083,1,45,I no longer use it.,-1,1
2083,1,46,Oh, wait, there is one good thing: the red-eye reducer in the software is excellent.xD,-1,1
2083,1,47,The cards (even the Type H high-speed cards) are slower than the SD competition.,-1,1
2083,1,48,Support for xD is poor among card readers (be careful and make sure your card reader will support Type M and Type H if you buy those cards).,-1,1
2083,1,49,Fuji's own software "upgrade" for their own card reader (DPC-R1), to allow it to work with Type M and H cards DOES NOT WORK on Windows XP (fully updated).,-1,1
2083,1,50,Card reader will no longer work.,-1,1
2083,1,51,I tried the Olympus MAUSB-200 reader and it worked fine with Type H.  [Edit 7/2/06:  I installed a front-panel-accessible, USB 2.0, multi-card reader from Atech Flash Technology (PRO-28U/XC-28U).,-1,1
2083,1,52,It is specified to be able to read xD, xD-Type M, and xD-Type H.,-1,1
2083,1,53,It works fine with the xD-Type H, and is available on Amazon and other places.,-1,1
2083,1,54,You'll need two internal USB 2.0 ports.],-1,1
2084,1,0,Great for low light, but...,-1,1
2084,1,1,I agree with the previous poster and with the photo review sites that the F30 sets new standards for low light performance.,-1,1
2084,1,2,As it's September now in New England and the days are getting shorter, that can be a real plus and I think I'll be happy with the camera throught the spring.,-1,1
2084,1,3,But...This camera is terribly slow!,-1,1
2084,1,4,I bought the fastest Xd card I could find and it's just miles behind my previous Canon SD500.,-1,1
2084,1,5,There's no comparison... espcially with continuous shooting and picture review/delete.Looking back at older pics taken with the Canon, I think the Fuji does not win on outdoors photos.,-1,1
2084,1,6,Canon has such a smooth and artifact-free quality... the F30 can't match it even at ISO100.,-1,1
2084,1,7,But the Fuju is more detailed...,-1,1
2084,1,8,I think there is a trade-off with the noise reduction system they each use.Canon should just impove thier cameras for better low light performance and I'll not stray again.,-1,1
2084,1,9,I've had many Elphs and just sold my Rebel XT to buy the XTi.BUT I differ with the previous poster re: user interface.,-1,1
2084,1,10,I think the F30 is easier to deal with re: changing ISO on the fly... and Canon doesn't even offer the option of apiture or shutter priority.,-1,1
2085,1,0,Just wish you'll never have to send it for service.,-1,1
2085,1,1,We received this camera as a wedding gift this summer.,-1,1
2085,1,2,We started using it and everything was great: the photos' as well as the videos' quality (especially in low-light).,-1,1
2085,1,3,Until one day (during --unfortunately-- our honeymoon), we took the camera out of its Fuji pouch and discovered that the LCD wouldn't work.,-1,1
2085,1,4,We then discovered that the camera didn't have a viewfinder, therefore we weren't able to take any other pictures except for "random" ones, tuned in the "auto" mode (since all the options can only be set from the menu that is shown -- guess where -- on the LCD screen).,-1,1
2085,1,5,This actually ruined part of our trip, since now the only pictures we have from our honeymoon are the random ones plus some photos we took using a disposable camera.,-1,1
2085,1,6,We, however, believed that we could get this fixed, since the camera was still on warranty.,-1,1
2085,1,7,Therefore, as soon as we returned to the US, we sent the camera (on our own expense) to the Fujifilm service center in New Jersey.,-1,1
2085,1,8,And here's what happened: we received by mail a "repair estimate", requiring a total of 117$ (remarks: "display is cracked, lens ring is dented, complete ck, scratches, dust").,-1,1
2085,1,9,We called them to see why we were charged this amount since the camera was still on warranty, and they told us that the cracked LCD is not covered, even though it's from the inside (no outside cracks).,-1,1
2085,1,10,The camera was worth more than 400$ when my brother-in-law bought it for us, plus 117$ for service (after only a few days of usage) results in a total of more than 520$.,-1,1
2085,1,11,With this amount of money, I can buy two Canon cameras, which have been proved really reliable (both my old Canon (film camera) bought more than 10 years ago, and my brother's Canon Powershot S410 (almost 2 years' old) still work great), and that's what I'm going to do.,-1,1
2086,1,0,Disappointing.,-1,1
2086,1,1,I narrowed my choice for a new camera to the Fuji F30 and the Canon S700.,-1,1
2086,1,2,The draw of the F30 was its ability to shoot without a flash in very low light.,-1,1
2086,1,3,My Canon digital SLR has this capability and it's great - I really dislike the artificial look of a flash blasted into my photographs.First a little background for those who might not know about film speed (others can skip to the next paragraph).,-1,1
2086,1,4,The ability of a camera to capture an image in low light is measured by a scale carried over from film cameras.,-1,1
2086,1,5,Each camera has a maximum ISO rating.,-1,1
2086,1,6,A camera with a higher ISO rating can record pictures without a flash in lower light situations.Many consumer cameras on the market only go to ISO 200 before the flash has to kick in.,-1,1
2086,1,7,Better ones go to 400.,-1,1
2086,1,8,The Canon S700 (and a few others) goes to 800.,-1,1
2086,1,9,But the Fuji F30 is unique; it's capable of going all the way to ISO 3200 without a flash.,-1,1
2086,1,10,That's the equivalent of two more f-stops than the Canon and 3 more f-stops than a lot of other cameras before the flash has to kick in on the Fuji (though the flash is available if you want it at any time).,-1,1
2086,1,11,If it works well, it's a technology breakthrough for such a low price.That's this camera's big selling point.But after shooting with it for several days, I'm very disappointed with the results, on this big "selling point" and a few other things as well.Here's why:1.,-1,1
2086,1,12,The pictures taken at ISO 1600 and 3200 have too much digital noise in them to be usable without additional computer processing before printing.,-1,1
2086,1,13,Noise is the digital equivalent of film grain, but it's multi-colored and it's really distracting.,-1,1
2086,1,14,In fact, with the Fuji, you can actually see the noise in the viewfinder when you switch to the highest ISO settings!It can be cleaned up pretty well in photoshop with a noise reduction filter (an add on purchase, by the way).,-1,1
2086,1,15,But this takes time, effort and some learning and I doubt most want to do this with a consumer snapshot camera.I was surprised by this poor performance and very disappointed.Other issues:2.,-1,1
2086,1,16,The camera's has a setting on the control dial on top for "Anti-Blur" mode (symbol is a person with motion lines on either side), but, in fact, the camera doesn't offer any kind of image stabilization technology whatsoever.,-1,1
2086,1,17,The only thing that happens when you turn the dial to this position is the program "selects a fast shutter speed to freeze motion that reduces camera shake and moving subject blurring" (quote from the user guide).This appears to be nothing more than re-labeling the "sports" setting on most any other camera and calling it "anti-vibration" or whatever.,-1,1
2086,1,18,I gather Fuji doesn't have the technology to be competitive with Canon (the S700 has true Image Stabilization) and this is just an attempt to mask that, but it's misleading to  characterize it as a separate "mode".3.,-1,1
2086,1,19,This is the first camera I've purchased that doesn't come with a battery charger.,-1,1
2086,1,20,You have to put the battery in the camera and plug the camera into the wall outlet.,-1,1
2086,1,21,Among other inconveniences, it means you can't just buy an extra battery and charge it separately.,-1,1
2086,1,22,You can pay for a charger as a separate purchase, of course, but it ought to come with the camera.4.,-1,1
2086,1,23,Finally, the camera itself is a little chunky.,-1,1
2086,1,24,After playing with the Canons, Sonys, etc. at Best Buy, the Fuji is out of step in being a bit thick and heavy.,-1,1
2086,1,25,Not a lot; just maybe one generation back.,-1,1
2086,1,26,I'd like something I can tuck in the front pocket of my jeans and not look like something's really jammed in there.I suppose I should mention that other than these four problems, the picutures I took with the F30 are fine, lovely, etc, but frankly, that's true of most cameras these days.So, I'm sending it back and getting the Canon.I realize this review has been long, but since it's the first one for this camera, I thought it might be useful to share this information.,-1,1
2087,1,0,Not the best picture quality.,-1,0
2087,1,1,Yes this camera takes great pictures in low light, capturing subjects and background alike.,-1,0
2087,1,2,As well, it does beautifully outdoors.,-1,1
2087,1,3,It seems to have rave reviews but I didn't find the quality of pictures to my standard.,-1,1
2087,1,4,I like  crisp, clean, and sharp photographs.,-1,1
2087,1,5,I found these to be a bit fuzzy and dull.,-1,1
2087,1,6,While it has nice features, I expected better and was highly disappointed in the pictures themselves.,-1,1
2087,1,7,They aren't bad if you just want average pictures, but if you are expecting nice clear images, you may want to be sure to try one out first.,-1,1
2087,1,8,They look ok when you playback on the camera too, but not as well on the computer or printed out.,-1,1
2088,1,0,Good Underwater Camera - Do not buy Fuji until replace xD memory card format !,-1,1
2088,1,1,I will never by a Fuji or Olympus camera again as long as they continue to use a non-mainstream memory card format such as the stupid xD-Picture memory card format.The camera is good.,-1,1
2088,1,2,Both the stills and video are great - even sound comes through nicely using the Fuji underwater case.However once I discovered that taking and viewing underwater videos is much more interesting than stills I quickly came up against the limits of the stupid xD-Picture memory card format Fuji uses.,-1,1
2088,1,3,While you can get a 32GB SD cards for low cost for every other camera on the planet, the highest capacity Xd memory card you can find is a tiny 2GB; fine for stills but sucks for video ( especially when you have to open an underwater case to replace).,-1,1
2088,1,4,The xD format is a dead end - do not expect to see increased capacity memory cards.-Ed,-1,1
2089,1,0,washed out. it works nice in the dark.,-1,0
2089,1,1,most pictures are good in the daytime, but most pictures at night seemed to be washed out, but they are viewable, just not the greatest quality that I was expecting.,-1,0
2090,1,0,If it's so great, make me an offer.,-1,1
2090,1,1,I have had this camera for two years and I haven't been able to find the settings that produce the crisp, high quality images that I expected based on the available reviews.This was supposed to be a great low light camera.,-1,1
2090,1,2,Then why do the indoor pictures come out so grainy?,-1,1
2090,1,3,According to the reviews here, it's because auto-mode doesn't work so great.,-1,0
2090,1,4,I assumed that auto mode would be ok.,-1,0
2090,1,5,I've picked up a few hints about forcing the camera to use a lower ISO setting in manual mode.,-1,0
2090,1,6,We'll try that.The one thing I'll give the camera credit for is great battery life.,-1,0
2090,1,7,I bought a couple of extra batteries based on my previous experience with a previous Fujipix camera.,-1,0
2090,1,8,Don't really need them.,-1,0
2091,1,0,Good , but not great.,-1,0
2091,1,1,I was expecting much more from this camera.,-1,0
2091,1,2,All the reviews make it out to be revolutionary.Hmm, i dont think so.. Daytime fotos are great.,-1,1
2091,1,3,Underwater is crappy, then again , I dont have a strobe yet, so we will wait and see.,-1,1
2091,1,4,The camera reviews say its noisy..,-1,1
2091,1,5,I dint really know what that meant until i started using the movie feature.,-1,1
2091,1,6,Click , clack, clunk.. Is all i hear when i use the movie mode, as the lens is adjusting , yet it has to stay at a fixed zoom ?,-1,1
2091,1,7,this doesnt make sense to me, why do i have to have a fixed zoom if the camera iris is constanly adjusting>Overall, if I had to do it again, id get something better.,-1,1
2091,1,8,For those that dont care about low light quality wash out, and crappy auto focus, go ahead and buy it.,-1,1
2092,1,0,Nice looking camera with great features, but image quality is not what I expected.,-1,1
2092,1,1,I wanted to surprise my wife with a new compact camera with some updated features since her beloved Canon SD200 is getting a bit old (although still reliable).,-1,1
2092,1,2,We just had our 3rd child, so I felt she could take better pictures with a better camera.I researched extensively and decided on the Panasonic Lumix FX01.,-1,1
2092,1,3,As a bonus, it came in pink....my wife's favorite color.This camera has some great features like the image stabilizer and 28mm wide angle view.,-1,0
2092,1,4,It's also a compact camera (like the SD200) which is a requirement for my wife.,-1,0
2092,1,5,A majority of the reviewers liked the camera...for its size, you get some amazing features.,-1,0
2092,1,6,For me, the biggest selling point was the wide angle lens (a Leica lens) and 6 megapixels.When I got the camera, it was fancy looking....All metal construction with a large screen on the back.,-1,1
2092,1,7,The menus are easy to use, and there's a simple mode for those that just want to point and click.I am meticulous about comparing and testing, so I put the SD200, FX01, and my personal Sony DSC-V1 side by side and took over 100 pictures inside with flash and outside in sunlight.I expected the FX01 to have amazing pictures, but I was actually disappointed.,-1,1
2092,1,8,Some of the shots looked slightly out of focus compared to the other cameras' shots.We take mostly inside shots of our kids with the flash on, and the FX01 did mediocre compared to the other cameras.,-1,1
2092,1,9,I noticed the pictures got very dark when I used the zoom.,-1,1
2092,1,10,The SD200 had some noticeable noise in some shots, but the FX01 was not much better and was worse at times.,-1,1
2092,1,11,My Sony V1 did the best, but this was more of a comparison with the compact cameras.Pitting the SD200 vs the FX01, I looked for good picture quality....and these cameras rated about the same to me.,-1,1
2092,1,12,I looked for sharpness and good focus, and the FX01 just didn't impress me.,-1,1
2092,1,13,Of the 100 shots, SOME of the FX01 pictures were better (skin tone and detail), but more were slightly out of focus and dark.,-1,1
2092,1,14,Even with all the fancy features of the FX01, I did not feel completely satisfied that it was a better camera than the SD200 because of the image quality....so I'm returning the FX01 today.I give it 3 stars for its great set of features but only average image quality for indoor shots with flash.,-1,1
2092,1,15,I wanted very badly to like this camera, but after all the testing I finally had to admit that it's not a better replacement to our SD200.,-1,1
2093,1,0,WARNING- LCD screen issue on all compact Lumix cams.,-1,1
2093,1,1,Bought the camera on a recommendation, and also what looked like good specs on the web.,-1,1
2093,1,2,Owned it for less than two weeks when the LCD screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover).,-1,1
2093,1,3,Turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras.,-1,1
2093,1,4,Panasonic will not warranty fix this!,-1,1
2093,1,5,If you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button.,-1,1
2093,1,6,If you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply.,-1,1
2093,1,7,This is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up "bricking" a brand new camera.,-1,1
2093,1,8,I am replacing mine with a Canon.,-1,1
2094,1,0,great features, great reviews - where is the focus?,-1,0
2094,1,1,I bought this camera because a good friend recommended it to me and all the reviews I've read confirmed that recommendation.,-1,0
2094,1,2,I am replacing a Canon sd400 which got the infamous e18 error 3 years after i bought it :-(.,-1,1
2094,1,3,I was very happy with my canon till it broke, I have a one year old and the canon has made it easy to record her first steps.,-1,1
2094,1,4,After I received the fx-01 I took 100 picture the same day (ok it was at night) 33 of the pictures were out of focus - i had never had such a bad rate with my canon, in fact focus was something i wasn't even aware of till I tried this camera out.,-1,1
2094,1,5,Also I found it difficult to take pictures of my daughter the camera took to long to take the shot and I seemed to miss most of them, even my sd400 felt faster.,-1,1
2094,1,6,I'm in the process of returning this camera, it reads great (reviews, price, etc) but for my reality (pics of kids, friends, vacations, etc.) it can't focus and is too slow.,-1,1
2094,1,7,I've used the sd600 before and consider it to be a much better camera (who cares about IS and 28mm if it can't focus?),-1,1
2094,1,8,I should warn you that I'm just a guy taking pics around the house with no professional experience, so these are my .2,-1,1
2095,1,0,Pro: love how fast it turns on, and the time between pictures.,-1,0
2095,1,1,love the wide angle lens.Con: the JPEG image processing in this camera is bad.,-1,1
2095,1,2,noise is way too high.,-1,1
2095,1,3,this camera might be great if it offered a RAW image format, and allowed the image processing to be done on the computer.,-1,1
2095,1,4,you'd do better with a 4 megapixel camera that offered a RAW image; as it is, you end up with a big, noisy picture that can not be blown up as large as you would expect from a 6 megapixel camera.Great snapshot camera, but nothing more...,-1,1
2096,1,0,Great looking, performs well, but unacceptable noise at high ISOs.,-1,1
2096,1,1,After much research, I decided to go with the DMC-FX01.,-1,1
2096,1,2,So after having used it at two events, which included a few indoor parties with low lighting, I'm more or less enjoying the camera, with the caveat that it produces quite a bit of noise, even at lower ISOs.,-1,1
2096,1,3,While I was pretty happy with my results involving outdoor pictures and using the flash in well-lit indoor shots, I was very disappointed to notice the unacceptable amount of noise in some of the photos I took with low lighting.,-1,1
2096,1,4,I'm not particuarly knowledgable about photography, but I don't quite understand why a camera manufacture would sell a device that takes unusable pictures at certain settings.So while I still like the camera, I wouldn't recommend it for the user who wants to take night shots or photos in low lighting situations.,-1,0
2096,1,5,Other than this very important (and basic) flaw, the camera is a lot of fun to use.,-1,0
2097,1,0,Great on paper... Pics taken outdoors and in very brightly lit indoor settings are fine.,-1,1
2097,1,1,However, for the times when I want to take quick snaps of the kids and the lighting conditions are not ideal (read: most of the time), the fx01 creates images that are either cold and unnatural looking (flash on, but this is kinda normal for this space), or are noisy and grainy (which is not normal).,-1,1
2097,1,2,I found some success tweaking the settings, but I bought this to be a point and shoot camera, not a dslr, and while I don't expect the world from an ultra compact, I think the fx01 should take better pics, and there are many other cameras that do.,-1,1
2097,1,3,I returned it.The noisiness aside, it does have a bunch of cool features.,-1,1
2097,1,4,I don't think I will buy another camera without the wide angle lens, which makes framing shots so much easier.,-1,1
2097,1,5,It has a setting that makes it so you can see the lcd when you hold the camera above your head for a higher angle shot, I could see myself using that on occasion.,-1,1
2097,1,6,It goes pretty quick from off to taking the pic, which is essential for snapping candids of the kids.,-1,1
2097,1,7,Also the image stabilization works.Overall, this camera has all the right features, it just falls short on the images.,-1,1
2097,1,8,Panasonic just needs the fix the sensor to take cleaner pics to be real competition for Canon.,-1,1
2097,1,9,I have read that the fx07 is even worse, so skip that.,-1,1
2097,1,10,The fx30 was just announced, so I am going to wait and give Panasonic another chance (provided that my old s50 stays with me).,-1,1
2097,1,11,If that doesn't work out I guess I will either have to suck it up and shell out the extra cash for the Canon sd800is, or sacrifice the wide angle lens in the Fuji f40fd.,-1,1
2098,1,0,Grainy images!,-1,1
2098,1,1,I spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera.,-1,1
2098,1,2,In the end, it came down to Panasonic's FX01 and Cannon's SD600.,-1,1
2098,1,3,I read the warnings from other reviewers that the Panasonic's images weren't top quality, but I chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the FX01 looks like it would out perform the SD600.,-1,1
2098,1,4,I was wrong.After using the FX01 for a few days I knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo.,-1,1
2098,1,5,I really really wanted this camera to be great, but it just wasn't.,-1,1
2098,1,6,Actually, my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp FX01!  Very disappointing.,-1,1
2098,1,7,I ended up returning this camera to Amazon (very easy-great service) because of the poor image quality.,-1,1
2098,1,8,I mean, wanting good photographs is why you take photos, right?,-1,1
2098,1,9,I know someone with the SD600 and he's very happy with the quality.,-1,1
2098,1,10,Judging by the customer images on the SD600's page on amazon, I think I should've gone with Cannon.,-1,1
2099,1,0,Very Small & Nicely Built, BUT Disappointing Image Quality.,-1,1
2099,1,1,I bought this camera to replace my Canon Powershot A620 because I wanted something smaller.,-1,1
2099,1,2,The Canon may have been larger and heavier but its pictures were far better.,-1,1
2099,1,3,The Panasonic took nice pictures outdoors, however, indoors, even with a few lamps on, the pictures were fairly noisy with the ISO set to only 100.,-1,1
2099,1,4,Indoor shots at 200 or 400 ISO are unacceptably noisy.,-1,1
2099,1,5,The noise was distracting in prints as small as 4" x 6".,-1,1
2099,1,6,Moreover, when I tried to take macro pictures without the flash for an online auction the images were so dark as to be useless.,-1,1
2099,1,7,All the pictures I shot were at the highest resolution and lowest compression setting.,-1,1
2099,1,8,I ended up returning the camera for the Canon PowerShot S3 IS, which has far superior controls, zoom range, and picture quality (sure it's a larger camera, but it is a trade-off I am more than willing to make).,-1,1
2099,1,9,One the positive side the camera is very small, has a nice wide-angle zoom with optical image stabilization, and is solidly constructed.,-1,1
2099,1,10,Still, taking pictures is what a digital camera is all about and the poor image quality could not outweigh the positives.,-1,1
2099,1,11,I like Panasonic products and own many, but this Panasonic was a disappointment, this beautiful camera deserves a better sensor.,-1,1
2099,1,12,Look into a Canon or Fuji camera first.,-1,1
2099,1,13,I have owned a few of both brands and they have never disappointed.,-1,1
2100,1,0,On the first day of my trip to Brazil my camera broke.,-1,1
2100,1,1,I didn`t drop it or bang it against anything, I used it normally, took some photos that afternoon.,-1,1
2100,1,2,I noticed that the camera was draining my batteries (from a previous version of this camera) much faster than normal.,-1,1
2100,1,3,I tried turning on my camera the next day and it didn`t work.,-1,1
2100,1,4,I tried recharging the batteries again and nothing.,-1,1
2100,1,5,Its a shame, because I had a previous version of this Panasonic Luminix camera and they are great cameras`... and of course it also almost ruined my trip to south america as i had to buy another camera from Sony Brasil that isn`t that great in quality (errors on some of the images I took),-1,0
2101,1,0,If you buy this camera, do not use it anywhere near the beach.,-1,1
2101,1,1,I bought one as a present for my daughter going overseas and it broke within a few weeks.,-1,1
2101,1,2,I sent it in for warranty service and was told that the warranty was voided because the camera had sand in it.,-1,1
2101,1,3,They offered to sell me a new one at a price higher than Amazon charged me.,-1,1
2101,1,4,Apparently, others have had problems with sand blowing into the camera - it must not be sealed very well.,-1,1
2101,1,5,Customer service was rude and not at all helpful.,-1,1
2101,1,6,I would stay away from Panasonic entirely.,-1,1
2101,1,7,I will certainly not buy from them again.,-1,1
2102,1,0,After a lot of research, I bought this camera a couple of months ago before I went on a trip.,-1,0
2102,1,1,The camera had some features I really wanted - such as the 28mm wide angle, image stabilizer, a large LCD screen and the compact size!,-1,0
2102,1,2,It looked really good on paper.,-1,0
2102,1,3,After the first day of my trip, I almost wanted to smash it against the wall!,-1,0
2102,1,4,The photos (taken at ISO 200 or 400 due to a rainy day) were extremely noisy - it's like nothing I have ever seen.,-1,0
2102,1,5,(When I first bought this it was just released so there was hardly any review; since I returned from my trip, I've seen quite a few reviews about this noise problem.,-1,1
2102,1,6,Though the photos turned out okay (not excellent) the rest of the way at ISO 100 during sunny days, I would not recommend this product to anyone.,-1,1
2102,1,7,Sure it has some attractive features, but a good camera should at least take good photos!,-1,1
2102,1,8,This camera gives Leica a bad name.,-1,1
2103,1,0,Horrible pictures!,-1,1
2103,1,1,Always blurry!!This is the first and last Panasonic Camera I've had.,-1,1
2103,1,2,I'll go back to a Canon or Nikon.,-1,1
2104,1,0,Compact, great LCD, but trouble focussing sometimes.,-1,0
2104,1,1,I have four of these -- for me, my wife, and each of my two daughters -- and we took it to Europe in April and took 2000 pictures with it.,-1,1
2104,1,2,In many ways it's a good little camera -- very compact, good zoom (3x), a somewhat wide-angle (28mm) basic setting, which is handy for taking pictures indoors, lots of special settings if you want to use them, shutter lag that's not too bad, and generally good guesses as to the right lighting for a balanced picture.,-1,1
2104,1,3,Its video capabilities are very reasonable too.Our only ongoing problem is that many of our pictures are out of focus, and we don't really know why.,-1,1
2104,1,4,We are going to try "prefocussing," where you push the button down halfway first, so the camera gets a focus, and you can see in the (very big and bright!) LCD display on the back what it's focussing on, and see if that helps.It seems to have the most focus trouble in lower light conditions.,-1,1
2104,1,5,I notice that even with ISO set at 400, it will often slow to 1/8th a second or even slower -- and there's no way we can hold the camera steady at that slow shutter speed, even with the dual image-stabilization/ anti-shake feature it has.,-1,1
2104,1,6,So it may be blur rather than focus that's our problem.,-1,1
2104,1,7,Some future day when we buy another snapshot camera, we'll see if we can spend more for one with a higher ISO setting (800 or 1200), though that can drive the cost up quite a bit.,-1,1
2104,1,8,Of course, we *could* just get a tripod, or a monopod, but this is a snapshot camera, how much of a camera geek do you think we are??If we can conquer the blur problem, this will be the nearly perfect everyday camera, especially for travel.,-1,1
2105,1,0,Mediocre picture quality, terrible low light performance.,-1,1
2105,1,1,I have owned this camera for about 6 months.Pros:,-1,0
2105,1,2,This is compact and light camera, which makes it very easy to take along on day trips and dinner parties.,-1,0
2105,1,3,The battery lasts forever.,-1,0
2105,1,4,The controls and on screen menus are easy to use.,-1,0
2105,1,5,The case and controls have a quality feel.,-1,0
2105,1,6,The camera starts up very quickly and writes to the card very quickly.,-1,0
2105,1,7,The screen is large and crisp.Cons: Unfortunately it takes pretty crummy pictures.,-1,1
2105,1,8,Low light is the worst, producing very grainy, poorly exposed, and out of focus pictures.,-1,1
2105,1,9,Day light, not surprisingly, produces the best results with rich color.,-1,1
2105,1,10,But the camera also overexposes a bit in bright daylight.,-1,1
2105,1,11,Flash pictures are almost always blown out.,-1,1
2105,1,12,Red eye reduction on the flash is very slow, so you get a noticeable lag between pressing the button and having the flash pulse and the shutter release.This camera is like and old Polaroid or instamatic... you can't expect much, and you will never count on it for true "keepers".,-1,1
2105,1,13,That said, it goes with me everywhere and is handy for when lugging around a DSLR is overkill.,-1,1
2106,1,0,WARNINGS about this Panasonic camera.,-1,1
2106,1,1,I'm sort of relieved that my Lumix FX-01 is at Panasonic after I refused to pay $111 to have them fix my lens, which bent to the side.How did it bend to the side?See that on/off switch on the top of the camera?,-1,1
2106,1,2,The entire time I had the camera it would turn on by itself since it's very easy to hit by accident.,-1,1
2106,1,3,Apparently this happened somehow in my pocket and the lens bent and stuck.When I pointed out to customer service that no other camera has a switch that extends like that - and seemingly for a very good reason - they were not moved.On another note this camera is HORRIBLE in low light photography.,-1,0
2106,1,4,Additionally the colors and photos were always kind of harsh without the nuance and "wysiwyg" quality I got with my old Canon point and shoot.I HIGHLY recommend getting a Canon instead of this.,-1,0
2106,1,5,The main reason I got this Lumix was a 28mm lens, but that wasn't worth it -- especially after my bad experience with their product design.,-1,0
2107,1,0,Sexy  YES,  but lacks performance!,-1,1
2107,1,1,The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy!,-1,1
2107,1,2,Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA.The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2.,-1,1
2107,1,3,Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images.,-1,0
2107,1,4,If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi.,-1,1
2107,1,5,It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution.,-1,1
2107,1,6,Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi.So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour.,-1,1
2107,1,7,Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition.,-1,1
2107,1,8,Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop.,-1,1
2107,1,9,Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself.,-1,1
2107,1,10,That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced!,-1,1
2107,1,11,I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too.,-1,1
2108,1,0,Don't ever lose the proprietary data cable for this camera.,-1,1
2108,1,1,This camera takes great pictures and is very compact and portable.,-1,1
2108,1,2,I've loved having it, but it has one glaring flaw which is the proprietary data cable.,-1,1
2108,1,3,If you lose it, there is no universal cable you can use to transfer your pictures to your computer.,-1,1
2108,1,4,You have to buy a very specific replacement cable.,-1,1
2108,1,5,Not being able to get my pictures off my own camera has rendered it nearly pointless.,-1,1
2109,1,0,Big Mistake.,-1,0
2109,1,1,I do not recommend this camera.,-1,0
2109,1,2,Within six weeks of getting it, after routine usage,it died and Panasonic would not repair or replace it despite the 90-day warranty.,-1,1
2109,1,3,If it broke down that easily and that quickly, and the manufacturer will not stand behind its product, then stay away from this camera.During the brief time the camera was working, it took pictures that were no better than any other digital camera I've seen.,-1,1
2109,1,4,Why buy an average camera from a manufacturer that will not stand behind its product?,-1,1
2110,1,0,Review mostly for still image photography and compared to 6D and T2i (550D) Second Update (3/15): I tried another sample and phase detection autofocus works a lot better on this one.,-1,1
2110,1,1,Maybe not as good as I would expect, but the keeper rate is considerably higher.,-1,1
2110,1,2,If this would have been my first copy, I probably would have never noticed (as I would not have looked at it that critically).,-1,1
2110,1,3,The noise is surprisingly a little worse than on my first copy and matches that of my T2i exactly.,-1,1
2110,1,4,So I bumped it up a star, but not back to the original 4 stars, given the existence of QC problems and lack of improvement in sensor performance.===========================================================================================================================Update:,-1,1
2110,1,5,While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.,-1,1
2110,1,6,It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots.,-1,1
2110,1,7,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.,-1,1
2110,1,8,I wanted to like it and gave it a few more tries and chances, but the results were consistent (in a bad way).,-1,1
2110,1,9,understand that the "game changing" capabilities of this camera are on the video side, but I don't shoot a lot of video and there are plenty reviews out there on that topic.,-1,1
2110,1,10,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.,-1,1
2110,1,11,I have not had the camera for long, so I'm not covering close to all features, but focus on the primary ones (80/20 rule).It was between the T5i, 60D and the 70D for me, prior to picking the 70D.Pros:- While just a bit smaller, the body is almost identical to the 6D, with similar layout and pretty much the same feel (which I love).,-1,1
2110,1,12,However, if I look at my trusty Rebel T2i, which has been used in rain, on the beach, thrown in the backpack on many bike rides and abused in hours and hours of astrophotography sessions (usually covered in frozen dew), it still looks and behaves almost like new.,-1,1
2110,1,13,So I think the 70D will do just fine.-,-1,1
2110,1,14,Touch flip screen.,-1,0
2110,1,15,I like my buttons and I am slow to adjust to what the touch screen offers, but I am catching on.,-1,0
2110,1,16,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.,-1,0
2110,1,17,Responsiveness is just as good as on my iPod Touch.-,-1,0
2110,1,18,Auto-focus.,-1,0
2110,1,19,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.,-1,0
2110,1,20,I often take photos of birds in flight and I got a lot more keepers compared to my other bodies.,-1,0
2110,1,21,The camera was tracking nicely when shooting a low flying eagle against the background of trees and fields.-,-1,0
2110,1,22,7 fps.,-1,0
2110,1,23,Works like a charm (after I got used to the somewhat tinny sound of the shutter).-,-1,0
2110,1,24,Good kit lens.,-1,0
2110,1,25,Comes surprisingly close to the 24-105mm L lens, but with a wider range and a lot lower price.,-1,0
2110,1,26,I posted a separate review under the individual lens item on Amazon.,-1,0
2110,1,27,In summary, well worth it the extra money.-,-1,1
2110,1,28,Using your smart phone or iPad/iPod as a remote, without much complications, is something that I got hooked on with the 6D.-,-1,1
2110,1,29,Long exposure behavior (I use it for astro pictures at 2-5 minute exposure) is really no difference to the already great T2i.,-1,1
2110,1,30,Some stated concerns that the new sensor design (with the split photodiodes per pixel) might have a negative impact here.,-1,1
2110,1,31,But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.,-1,1
2110,1,32,Now, the T2i has great image quality (especially based on the year when it came out), but noise and dynamic range are practically the same.,-1,1
2110,1,33,In fact, I can't tell the difference between unprocessed results from both sensors, even at 100%, for ISO 800 and below.,-1,1
2110,1,34,Only for higher ISO and longer exposures one can see a little improvement (but not much more than you can expect in variances from the same sensor model).,-1,1
2110,1,35,The only significant difference is that DPP takes a lot longer to generate the high definition view...  Now, in a way, that still justifies having a full frame camera (and I prefer the smaller APS-C sensor for astrophotography and wild life), the 6D is just an order of magnitude better when it comes to image quality, but one could have hoped for some improvements over the last 4-5 years here.,-1,1
2110,1,36,Some report significant low light performance improvements over the older 18 MP sensor, but you might want to check the noise reduction settings in DPP.,-1,1
2110,1,37,For the same camera settings, the 70D produces much more aggressive image settings than my T2i, which makes the 70D performance look much better at first glance.,-1,1
2110,1,38,Setting noise reduction to 0 (or the same value) for both, will make such differences mostly go away...Overall, the additional features (such as wireless, better auto-focus, better body, LCD display) make it worth the higher price compared to the T5i and 60D (at least the first two here) to me, but ultimately, you can probably take the same quality still pictures with all three (at least if the subject is not moving too fast...).,-1,1
2111,1,0,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.,-1,0
2111,1,1,I had to get mine replaced  because the shutter button suddenly stopped bouncing back up.,-1,1
2111,1,2,It would still work but it was not tactile.,-1,1
2111,1,3,It's surprising because I've only had the camera for a few weeks and hadn't really taken it out of the house.,-1,1
2111,1,4,Maybe I got a bad piece, I still expect better quality control for a camera that cost over a 1000 dollars two stars of for that.,-1,1
2112,1,0,Research focus problems before you buy it.,-1,1
2112,1,1,I got one that has the focus problem.,-1,1
2112,1,2,Based on all the great reviews, it may only be only some batches - I do not know.,-1,1
2112,1,3,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.,-1,1
2112,1,4,This occurs with or without a tripod, and both with manual and autofocus.,-1,1
2112,1,5,I have tried most of the tests, micro-adjustments, and other recommendations for those with similar problems, but nothing gives me a consistent focused picture.,-1,1
2113,1,0,Got a used camera from Amazon.,-1,1
2113,1,1,OK, this is a first for me when dealing with Amazon.,-1,1
2113,1,2,I received an obviously used camera.,-1,1
2113,1,3,Yes, I bought it direct from Amazon and not from a third party.,-1,1
2113,1,4,I took it out of the box and the Live View mode wasn't working reliably: I had to reset the camera twice by pulling the battery out in the first few hours of use.,-1,1
2113,1,5,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.,-1,1
2113,1,6,Here are signs you can use if you suspect similar:-The USB cable and neck strap should be sealed in individual plastic bags.,-1,1
2113,1,7,Mine were loose.-The,-1,1
2113,1,8,manuals should be sealed.,-1,1
2113,1,9,There should be a CD and several errata and warranty cards loose.,-1,1
2113,1,10,Mine were all loose.-The,-1,1
2113,1,11,used camera had the battery fully charged.,-1,1
2113,1,12,The replacement started charging from 0-49%.-The rear lens cap on the kit lens was marred noticeably.-The,-1,1
2113,1,13,shutter would click when the live view button was pressed, but the LCD screen would stay blank.,-1,1
2113,1,14,The only way to recover from this was to remove and reseat the battery.-The,-1,1
2113,1,15,first camera was set up to shoot RAW.,-1,1
2113,1,16,The default out of the box is typically jpeg.-Images,-1,1
2113,1,17,taken with the camera were numbered starting at 2561 instead of 0001.-The,-1,1
2113,1,18,date was set on the first camera.,-1,1
2113,1,19,The replacement asked me to set date and time.To their credit, Amazon made it right quickly and without cost to me, but the fact that it happened at all is a bit of a shock.,-1,1
2113,1,20,At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.,-1,1
2113,1,21,It's a great camera with an outstanding feature set.,-1,1
2113,1,22,Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.,-1,1
2113,1,23,My guess is an unscrupulous 70D owner bought a second camera from Amazon and swapped them rather than just sending their camera in for service.,-1,1
2113,1,24,Not cool.,-1,1
2114,1,0,Amazon said it was new, it was not.,-1,1
2114,1,1,Amazon sold this 70d to me as new, it came with with a memory card with other peoples pictures on it.Obviously not new.,-1,1
2115,1,0,Bought this camera for its auto-focus, returned this camera due to autofocus.,-1,1
2115,1,1,1.,-1,1
2115,1,2,The 19 point autofocus system, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder, consistently miss-focus the pictures, with my Canon 300mm F4 IS L lens.,-1,1
2115,1,3,(The situation is much better when using liveview auto-focus.,-1,1
2115,1,4,)2.,-1,1
2115,1,5,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.,-1,1
2115,1,6,For example, if there is a cup sits on a table, even the cup occupied the main area of the frame, the autofocus points, nonetheless, will almost always keep locking on the front surface of the table in front of the cup, while miss-focus the cup, which is actually the main subject.,-1,1
2115,1,7,(The situation is much better when using liveview auto-focus.,-1,1
2115,1,8,)3.,-1,1
2115,1,9,It is a Brand New Camera, and when I first opened the package, I found quite a few specks of small dusts on the assembly mirror, it is UNACCETABLE manufacturing control when you consider how EXPENSIVE this 1 pound little machine is.Shame on Canon, This camera will DESERVE one Star.,-1,1
2116,1,0,Amazon is selling used cameras as new!,-1,1
2116,1,1,I purchased this camera about a month ago.,-1,1
2116,1,2,I have been very happy with my 60Ds, but wanted to get the additional focus points.,-1,0
2116,1,3,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!,-1,1
2116,1,4,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.,-1,1
2116,1,5,In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card.,-1,1
2116,1,6,It just shows how many "clicks" are on your shutter, in your camera.,-1,1
2116,1,7,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).,-1,1
2116,1,8,Do not pay full price for a used camera!,-1,1
2116,1,9,If you get a camera that is used I would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one.,-1,1
2117,1,0,Consider Other Suppliers.,-1,1
2117,1,1,Read the professional reviews.,-1,1
2117,1,2,This is a great camera.,-1,0
2117,1,3,As a long-time Canon user with a 5D MKIII, multiple 'L' series lenses, etc.,-1,0
2117,1,4,This is a perfect only body for the serious photographer or a second for full-frame owners.,-1,0
2117,1,5,However, consider other sellers.Amazon's performance on my purchase was appalling and possibly fraudulent.,-1,0
2117,1,6,This particular purchase was a gift for my sister in Europe, ordered four days before my recent trip.,-1,0
2117,1,7,On delivery the box was clearly re-sealed, accessory packaging opened, and other signs of hasty re-packaging evident.,-1,1
2117,1,8,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.,-1,1
2117,1,9,After discussion, Amazon agreed to send a replacement but this did not arrive in time for my flight and was cancelled.I wrote, I called, I suggested that the replacement be delivered directly.,-1,1
2117,1,10,The response was negative or arrogant to the extreme.,-1,0
2117,1,11,As a result, I've paid full-price for an 'open-box' (being charitable) product.,-1,0
2117,1,12,Oh yes, the proof... Come on Amazon, you can train your packaging staff better than that.,-1,0
2117,1,13,The included strap was from a 5D, not 70D, and (I now know having bought another) that packaging was missing.,-1,0
2117,1,14,Fraudulent or just sharp practice is debatable.,-1,0
2117,1,15,Poor customer service is beyond doubt.,-1,1
2118,1,0,Defective in full auto mode.,-1,1
2118,1,1,I really liked this camera but had to return it for a defect.,-1,1
2118,1,2,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.,-1,1
2118,1,3,Occasionally the built-in flash didn't fire even in low light situations.,-1,1
2118,1,4,I thought about getting a replacement but worried about quality control.UPDATE:  I decided to take a chance and purchase a replacement 70D (from a different online retailer this time) and I'm having similar focus issues with it.,-1,1
2118,1,5,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).,-1,1
2118,1,6,I'm using the kit lens (ef-s 18-135 stm).,-1,1
2118,1,7,It appears the 19-point auto-focus is not focusing on the points indicated in the viewfinder, but on something closer.,-1,1
2118,1,8,It also chooses a high ISO when using the flash (like 1600) guaranteeing some graininess.,-1,1
2118,1,9,If this camera was for me I would keep it because I never use the auto-mode anyway, but it's my wife's and she does.,-1,1
2118,1,10,It will be returned.,-1,1
2119,1,0,Focus Issue using the viewfinder.,-1,1
2119,1,1,I was very anxious for this camera to arrive with all the hype about its enhanced focusing attributes especially for LiveView and in Movie mode.,-1,1
2119,1,2,My first trial shots with this camera yielded some that I thought were pretty soft for the pixel count of the camera.,-1,1
2119,1,3,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.,-1,1
2119,1,4,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.,-1,1
2119,1,5,I had not heard of any focusing issues but a quick internet search on "70D focus issues" yielded a large volume of unhappy customers who have spent a lot of time researching the issue.,-1,1
2119,1,6,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.,-1,1
2119,1,7,I am still trying to figure out how to hold the camera so that I can tap on the back viewing screen where I want the focus.,-1,1
2119,1,8,I really need to use a mono-pod or tri-pod but this seems a hassle especially for action shots.,-1,1
2120,1,0,Auto Focus Problems on 3 Canon 70d's.,-1,1
2120,1,1,I am at a loss to see the overwhelming positive reviews of the Canon 70D, although this is a large part of my purchasing them.,-1,1
2120,1,2,All 3 that I tried had the same Auto Focus problems that could not be corrected by the AF Micro Adjustment.,-1,1
2120,1,3,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.,-1,1
2121,1,0,Did not work.,-1,1
2121,1,1,Arrived quickly as promised, but would not recognize or format mem card.,-1,1
2121,1,2,Radio Shack folks provided several types listed in the manual as acceptable , but none worked.,-1,1
2121,1,3,Returned for replacement - hope it's OK!,-1,1
2122,1,0,Got a USED EOS 70D From Amazon.,-1,1
2122,1,1,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.,-1,1
2122,1,2,Box was worn from opening, LCD Display had fingerprints all over it, and the lens had fingerprints and misc other spots on it.Needed this for a birthday this Saturday so returning to Amazon for a refund and going to Best Buy and get them to match the price.I am not likely to ever purchase a big ticket item from Amazon as I don't want used cameras, etc.,-1,1
2123,1,0,Way over rated.,-1,1
2123,1,1,The camera is nice and good, but over rated.It has many cons, some are serious, example:1.Build quality, no way close to a $1000 camera.,-1,1
2123,1,2,In fact the poor build quality affects the controls, like the rear wheel, it's so cheap plastic that it's difficult to turn.2.Focus: With the kit lens(I have the 18-135mm) is good and accurate, but forget about it if you will use most other lenses.,-1,1
2123,1,3,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.,-1,1
2123,1,4,I tried 3 cameras and all have the same problem.,-1,1
2123,1,5,I was wondering how canon would release a camera with major defect like this.,-1,1
2123,1,6,The dpreview web site noticed the same thing.,-1,1
2123,1,7,Read their review.,-1,1
2123,1,8,They were polite and blamed them selves not the canon.,-1,1
2123,1,9,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.,-1,1
2123,1,10,Also the canon is sticking to the 30p.,-1,1
2123,1,11,Example: you can not assign the buttons you like.,-1,1
2123,1,12,No comparison to other offerings from Olympus, Panasonic or Sony.,-1,1
2123,1,13,I wish I can assign the WB to a button, but you can not.,-1,1
2123,1,14,The Sony RX10 has 3 custom WB and the 70D has just one.5.WB: if you want to chance the custom WB, you have to go and dig into the main menu.,-1,1
2123,1,15,A 4 or 5 steps.,-1,1
2123,1,16,Coupled with the fact you have just 1 custom WB, is a difficult job.6.Program shift: you have to do it for every single shot if you shoot in P mood.,-1,1
2123,1,17,It does not remember it.And so many cons.7.Focus, for the second time: Only good for stationary subject.,-1,1
2123,1,18,Regardless of the focus mode you use, none works well for moving subjects.The camera takes nice pictures, but there are many better options, and with the release of the new Sony A6000, this camera is good only if you already invested in canon glass, and sadly most of it won't work with this camera.,-1,1
2124,1,0,Huge defect in the 70D; Extreme underexposure using bounce flash.,-1,1
2124,1,1,I am an amateur photographer and my new 70D that I purchased a couple months ago at B&H; has been doing the same underexposure stunt that so many others have experienced (For example, see in depth discussions by searching the internet for Canon 70D bounce flash underexposure).This occurs whether I'm bouncing the flash off a white ceiling that's about eight feet high or using a Sto-fen diffuser attached to my Canon 430ex II in E-TTL mode.Whether the lens being used is the Canon 15-85 or the 55-250 STM, all low light indoor photos with the diffuser attached and with the flash head tilted 45 degrees, or 180 degrees, or direct facing are very underexposed.,-1,1
2124,1,2,Same results with bouncing the flash off the ceiling.,-1,1
2124,1,3,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.,-1,1
2124,1,4,Without using FEL, the pictures are way underexposed.If,-1,1
2124,1,5,I use the same flash setup in the flash's manual mode, without using FEL, and adjust the power down to say 1/2 or 1/4 or somewhere in between, the photos seem properly exposed (as long as I dial in the correct flash power adjustment).,-1,1
2124,1,6,With a zoom that has a variable aperture, it's a hit and miss approach and quite cumbersome.Also, I tried the same lenses attached to my Canon T3i taking the same photos as I did with the 70D using the same flash and diffuser without using FEL.,-1,1
2124,1,7,The photos all came out looking perfect with no underexposure whatsoever.,-1,1
2124,1,8,All photos with and without FEL were properly exposed and looked great.I use bounce flash indoors a lot for our one year old granddaughter.,-1,1
2124,1,9,I never had this problem, or any other issue, with my T3i.,-1,1
2124,1,10,I guess I'll have to resort to FEL use, but that amount flashes takes a toll on an infant.,-1,1
2124,1,11,She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one.,-1,1
2124,1,12,Plus, it's hard to get candid shots when an FEL pre-flash is being used.This isn't what I bargained for when I "upgraded" my camera body.I'm now wondering if this will negatively effect exposures on outside fill flash photos with a diffuser attached.The fact that Canon hasn't addressed this yet is disconcerting to say the least.,-1,1
2124,1,13,Unless they come up with a fix fairly quickly, I'm not sure I'd ever buy another Canon camera after this.,-1,1
2125,1,0,Disappointing Camera.,-1,1
2125,1,1,I researched this camera well online before deciding to purchase.,-1,1
2125,1,2,Most reviews made it sound like a great camera.,-1,1
2125,1,3,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.,-1,1
2125,1,4,Video focus tracking only worked half the time when handheld.,-1,1
2125,1,5,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.,-1,1
2125,1,6,Photo colors were not true unless taken in direct sunlight.,-1,1
2125,1,7,You expect much more from a 20.2mp camera.,-1,1
2125,1,8,Half of the still photos were not clearly focused.,-1,1
2125,1,9,I have cheaper canons that do a better job.,-1,1
2125,1,10,Might have received a flawed unit or the kit lens is junk, but I'm sending it back for a refund.,-1,1
2125,1,11,See the Amazon review by Mr. Ralph J. Secoy.,-1,1
2125,1,12,Same issues.,-1,1
2126,1,0,Err 30.,-1,1
2126,1,1,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.,-1,1
2126,1,2,When i called canon the guy treated me as if I was stupid and was telling me there is no way that there can be a err 30 code because thats a lens error and usually happens after a lot of use.,-1,1
2126,1,3,Said i can send my brand new camera for repair.,-1,1
2126,1,4,so needless to say I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.,-1,1
2126,1,5,I gave it a 1 star because of the customer service I received from canon not for the camera itself because i never got see how the camera performs.,-1,1
2127,1,0,Fantastic camera held back by poor software and auto focus issues.,-1,0
2127,1,1,Lots of great positive reviews on here.,-1,0
2127,1,2,Here are some cons to think about if they effect you:- Cannot sync full sized JPG and RAW files to Android- Cannot directly upload to Facebook or my TV via DLNA- Cannot take video while WIFI is enabled- Does not support USB 3.0- No IR focus headlight.,-1,1
2127,1,3,Uses flash for low-light focus which will blind your subject.-,-1,1
2127,1,4,Image quality in low light a bit noisy- Auto-Focus on the center focus point required +17 manual focus adjustment with a new 50mm f1.4.,-1,1
2127,1,5,Note, MFA adjustments only apply to P, Av, Tv and M modes.Search for Youtube video "70D Bad Focus Issues" by CameraRec Toby for more info on the focusing issue.,-1,1
2128,1,0,Two Defective Units Before Heading to Best Buy.,-1,1
2128,1,1,Do not buy a 70D from Amazon.,-1,1
2128,1,2,I bought two and both were defective out of the box.,-1,1
2128,1,3,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.,-1,1
2128,1,4,The overwhelming majority of the camera equipment I've bought from Amazon has been defective.,-1,1
2128,1,5,I'm honestly beginning to wonder if Amazon buys some manufacturer's QC rejects for a discounted price.Triple check everything you buy from Amazon for defects and also verify that you haven't bought a counterfeit item.,-1,1
2128,1,6,I frequently catch counterfeit products and I destroy them prior to returning them for refund.,-1,1
2129,1,0,break battery.,-1,1
2129,1,1,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.,-1,1
2129,1,2,When I get the battery, there is no power in it.,-1,1
2129,1,3,I think this product was opened before I get it.,-1,1
2130,1,0,putting this in 1 star just because of audio.,-1,1
2130,1,1,Audio plug is worthless.,-1,1
2130,1,2,Microphone is even more worthless.I plugged in external shotgun mic with a 1/8 adapter.,-1,1
2130,1,3,It was snapping and noisyThe onboard microphone was just as bad.,-1,1
2131,1,0,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.,-1,1
2131,1,1,I researched and waited for this camera to go on sale and pulled the trigger.,-1,1
2131,1,2,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.,-1,1
2131,1,3,My home is reasonably well lit and I was surprised when the flash popped up as I attempted to take a photo of my daughter.,-1,1
2131,1,4,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.,-1,1
2131,1,5,I also took some video which caused the lens to hunt even though the camera was pointed directly at my daughter and the room was well lit.,-1,1
2131,1,6,When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't.,-1,1
2131,1,7,I realized I might get better results with a better (prime?) lens but I also realized that the camera was just too big and heavy and that I was probably going to leave it home most of the time.,-1,0
2131,1,8,I have owned DSLR's before, and I was happy with my Nikon which died after getting sand in the lens which was too expensive to replace.,-1,0
2131,1,9,That day I was taking my family out for dinner and I wanted to bring the camera but I just could not imagine lugging it around and finding room for it on the table.,-1,1
2131,1,10,It started to dawn on me that I might not have been realistic in my selection and that while I would not mind spending money on better glass and maybe even mastering the controls and settings that would get me the photos I wanted, I really need something more portable.,-1,1
2131,1,11,One like this and another small P&S; I can carry in my pocket.,-1,1
2131,1,12,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.,-1,1
2131,1,13,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).,-1,1
2131,1,14,a sony RX100?,-1,1
2131,1,15,there are so many options, just sadly not this one.,-1,1
2132,1,0,I Just have one big observation, CHEAP!!,-1,1
2132,1,1,I don't mean the price (that's not cheap)I mean the construction.,-1,1
2132,1,2,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00,-1,1
2132,1,3,I know it's not a "PRO" camera but it is a "prosumer".,-1,1
2132,1,4,That middle level just below Pro and way above consumer.,-1,1
2132,1,5,I hate the feel!!,-1,1
2132,1,6,No one will say it but switch from a solid "prosumer" camera like my Canon 40D (now 7 years old) and the 70D feels like a kids toy.,-1,1
2132,1,7,I am afraid to shoot with it!,-1,1
2132,1,8,The menu wheel feels like it cost $2 bucks and should be on a $40.00 camera.,-1,1
2132,1,9,I don't care how good it works, give me form and function!!,-1,1
2132,1,10,If I can't buy a Pro camera for $4000.00,-1,1
2132,1,11,give me one that feels like a pro camera (like you did with the 40D).,-1,1
2132,1,12,I waited 7 years to upgrade and I feel like I bought a toy.,-1,1
2133,1,0,Over priced.,-1,1
2133,1,1,Over priced not a full frame sensor.,-1,1
2133,1,2,For a $1200 camera it should have a full frame senor.Their still not there yet.,-1,1
2133,1,3,We have to hold off until they produce a camera with a full frame senor for a reasonable price.,-1,1
2133,1,4,So we wait.....,-1,1
2134,1,0,Should be better in 2013.,-1,1
2134,1,1,Images are softer than expected.,-1,1
2134,1,2,The swivel touch screen is not really comfortable to use with your left hand (considering your right hand is holding the camera).,-1,1
2134,1,3,The focusing appeared to be very fast and accurate except later I found most of my images were not properly focused.,-1,1
2134,1,4,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.,-1,1
2135,1,0,Had this for 2 weeks now, here is my experience.,-1,0
2135,1,1,I got this camera because it was on sale, a good bargain for a 12 MP camera.,-1,0
2135,1,2,I have a Samsung 52" LCD HD TV that I am so happy about and love a lot.,-1,0
2135,1,3,The price was much less than the competition from Sony or Mitsubishi on the TV I felt like I got a real value and thought I would trust Samsung again because I knew what they are capable of.The SL620 is a nice form factor, fits in my pocket and comes out ready for action quickly.,-1,1
2135,1,4,It has the 12.2 Megapixels and 5x zoom, really astonishing technical achievements in a great package.There are some things that I do not like about this camera that might have been deal breakers had I known about it before my purchase.I really do not like the proprietary USB port and cable.,-1,1
2135,1,5,Every time I go to hook this up to charge it or download the mini-hdmi (what it looks like) connector does not want to connect.,-1,1
2135,1,6,It is hard to see whether it is up or down because it is so small.,-1,1
2135,1,7,This is really irritating, and I am sure would be expensive if I ever lost or damaged the cable.,-1,1
2135,1,8,A big thumbs down for that.,-1,1
2135,1,9,I have gotten used to a standard mini-USB cable, but Samsung uses this one port for download, charging, and displaying to TV as well which probably saves money and parts - for them, but it does nothing to make the camera easier or better to use.Second thing is that I love the on-screen help, but when you flick between modes the text is on the screen not even fast enough to read - very frustrating.,-1,1
2135,1,10,You have to keep clicking away and back to read the help screens?,-1,1
2135,1,11,Maybe there is a setting to adjust this, but learning the camera becomes harder, and when they do not implement the help well, it is worse than no help at all because it is just a distraction.Next is the viewfinder.,-1,1
2135,1,12,move back and try to give extra margin around my subject to shoot because what I see on the viewfinder is not necessarily the picture I end up with.,-1,1
2135,1,13,I have not really analyzed this to find out exactly where the picture is or how it changes with modes, but one needs to see on the viewscreen exactly what the picture is, otherwise the viewscreen is useless too.The pictures are so huge that taking the picture seems to take a while before the camera comes back.,-1,1
2135,1,14,The "snappiness" of the response leaves a bit to be desired.I also do not like the way the zoom is implemented as a vertical rocker switch up near the top of the trigger.,-1,1
2135,1,15,Your thumb wants to move right and left if you hold the camera like a normal human being, and making it go up and down really makes the zoom clumsy to use, and makes the camera more likely to shake.As I said, I like the form factor, the detail is wonderful, the size and shape are great.,-1,1
2135,1,16,The picture quality is very good.,-1,0
2135,1,17,The screen help idea is great, and the text that comes up when you change modes is a good idea, but as I said you can hardly read it before it goes away leaving it just as hard to tell what mode you are in as the cameras that have no such help.I have to say I am disappointed overall in the design details of this camera, though all the parts are there and the picture is nice and very detailed an the zoom power is very good.The video is sharp and clear and very nice.,-1,0
2135,1,18,I cannot say for sure but I think the image is stabilized in the video.I would recommend this camera for those who want all the features of a 12 MP 5x optical zoom for an inexpensive price and do not mind overlooking some ... what I think of anyway ... as bad design judgements.,-1,1
2135,1,19,With proper tweaking this camera could have been so much much better.I wonder if Samsung can make a firmware upgrade or something to fix some of my gripes ... though I have never heard of a f/w upgrade for a camera.,-1,1
2136,1,0,Good Camera, but has some issues.,-1,0
2136,1,1,Pros: great detail, the 12 megapix give amazing clarity.,-1,0
2136,1,2,I bought this for a trip to Rome, and it captures every little bit of detail a sculpture or painting.,-1,0
2136,1,3,the "Dual" mode does a great job of eliminating blurriness from shaking hands.,-1,1
2136,1,4,The 5x optical zoom works fast, and the auto focus adjusts quickly as well.Cons: the night time mode doesn't work that well, and makes pictures very yellow-ish.,-1,1
2136,1,5,I had some problems with pictures corrupting.,-1,1
2136,1,6,Of the 600 pictures I took, 8 of them became corrupt (although that could be a problem with the memory card and not the camera).,-1,1
2137,1,0,Same bad points here.,-1,0
2137,1,1,I got this camera because it was on sale, a good bargain for a 12 MP camera.,-1,0
2137,1,2,I have a Samsung 52" LCD HD TV that I am so happy about and love a lot.,-1,0

2137,1,14,When I was shooting it it was all in the center of the viewscreen.,-1,1
2137,1,15,This is a major problem ... I wish I could take it back at this point.The pictures are so huge that taking the picture seems to take a while before the camera comes back.,-1,1

2137,1,21,With proper tweaking this camera could have been so much much better.I wonder if Samsung can make a firmware upgrade or something to fix some of my gripes ... though I have never heard of a f/w upgrade for a camera.,-1,1
2138,1,0,Muted Volume when Zooming in Video mode.,-1,1
2138,1,1,First off, I will say that I won this camera with award points through my employer.,-1,1
2138,1,2,I did have some options and went with the Samsung based on the reviews I've read and the overall reputation that Samsung has for quality electronics.,-1,1
2138,1,3,Having said that, I probably would not have chosen this camera if I had to pay for it because most importantly for me, it uses it's own proprietary battery, which may be commonplace nowadays, but I prefer AA batteries, which are always widely available if you get into a jam.,-1,1
2138,1,4,I am not a professional photographer, although I have taken some classes in photography in my lifetime and know a little bit about photography.,-1,1
2138,1,5,I have owned probably 5 other digital cameras over the years and this being the newest, I was hoping for a lot more.,-1,1
2138,1,6,The images, so far only taken in Auto mode, have been a little disappoining.,-1,1
2138,1,7,Perhaps I'm not using the correct shooting mode, but I know that I have always used Auto mode (which a lot of my friends who are experienced photographers also do) with my point and shoot cameras, and have gotten much crisper images.,-1,1
2138,1,8,The images I took in auto mode just were not as defined as I had hoped - and the camera was set for highest resolution.,-1,1
2138,1,9,Another nuisance that I noticed only months after owning it is that the audio mutes (while in video mode) when zooming in/out.,-1,1
2138,1,10,I don't know if this is a defect in my camera, or a design defect.,-1,1
2138,1,11,It is a consistent problem.,-1,1
2138,1,12,The quality of the video, however, is the best I've had compared to all of my cameras.,-1,0
2138,1,13,I am considering trying to return it, but in the meantime, just zoom in to where I need to be before hitting the record button and then just don't touch the zoom button until finished.,-1,0
2138,1,14,The size and weight of the camera are fine and it does feel like it's solidly built.,-1,0
2138,1,15,I'm open to the possibility that I received a lemon, but wanted to mention these issues in case others noticed them also.Update 3/30/10: I called Samsung and was told that audio going mute on playback at any time the zoom button was used is a "design flaw".,-1,1
2138,1,16,They are not offering any sort of assistance and if you buy this camera, beware that this annoyance is something you will have to live with.,-1,1
2138,1,17,My advice is to not buy this camera, or any Samsung camera as I was informed that all 2009 cameras have this same design flaw and 2010 models have not yet been tested, according to the Level 2 Tech at Samsung.,-1,1
2139,1,0,Its okay but picture quality can use work.,-1,0
2139,1,1,Overall the camera suffices for everyday use, but the quality of the picture could be much much better.,-1,0
2139,1,2,Especially colors.,-1,1
2139,1,3,The colors come out very dull especially when using the flash, which is often necessary.,-1,1
2139,1,4,The smart auto also distorts colors, making them bluish and adding lots of noise.,-1,1
2139,1,5,After a year or so, the speakers died, making the video useless.,-1,1
2139,1,6,Zooms far but becomes blurry and zooming during video causes blurr and mute.,-1,1
2139,1,7,would not recommendalso mine's got a few glitches after a couple months, after i turn it on it keeps switching back and forth between different options like auto, smart auto, etc.outdoor photos come out good though, so if that's what you want it for, go for it!,-1,0
2140,1,0,Do NOT buy this camera.,-1,1
2140,1,1,Purchased this camera while on holiday in New York.,-1,1
2140,1,2,Came back to UK to find that it's basically a dud.,-1,1
2140,1,3,The buffer time is so long (regardless of settings) that all I get is blurred pictures as kids run out of frame or terrible pained expressions on subjects' faces.,-1,1
2140,1,4,A lot of the crucial buttons jam (delete, play and the main shutter button) and the camera regularly switches itself off.,-1,1
2140,1,5,Within a couple of months the LCD display developed screen bleed so I can't take a picture without trying to squint through black patches.,-1,1
2140,1,6,I contacted Samsung and it will only cover repairs for button issues, not the screen and will not replace the camera despite being in warranty.,-1,1
2140,1,7,Most unhelpful.Who knows if my particular camera was a lemon but if you're considering buying this camera, I wouldn't risk it.,-1,1
2141,1,0,HORRIBLE VIDEO AND PICTURES TOO BRIGHT!,-1,0
2141,1,1,I have this camera the video quality is HORRID!,-1,0
2141,1,2,also the pictures are so bright!! and if you take flash off it turns out blurry or really unsaturated! it turns your face white if you have any kind of face makeup!,-1,1
2141,1,3,and shows up all imperfections the... beauty tool makes it blurry so whats the use...pleasee buy something else this suckss im selling mine on craigslist,-1,1
2142,1,0,I was sad to depart from my 6MP Canon D600 last year, then decided to jump the gun on the SL620 to keep up with higher MPs... what a disappointment.,-1,1
2142,1,1,The SL620 took great pictures, camera looks good...but features started falling apart.,-1,1
2142,1,2,The dial switch started to switch position itself even though the dial itself wasn't turned.,-1,1
2142,1,3,Camera took pictures at a slow rate especially during lowlight or at the dark.,-1,1
2142,1,4,Worst yet, when you shoot a movie, it would stop and switch to still picture mode.,-1,1
2142,1,5,Another sucky thing is when you're shooting movie mode and zooming, it will blur and sound will disappear until zoom stops.,-1,1
2142,1,6,My Canon D600 was a way older camera but its technology surpassed the SL620's zoom function.,-1,1
2142,1,7,By the way, the sound on the video playback is horrible.,-1,1
2142,1,8,You have to use an edit program to turn up the volume on your video recording.,-1,1
2142,1,9,After owning the SL620 for a year and 1 month, it finally gave up on me and broke during my vacation, actually glad it broke!,-1,1
2142,1,10,Got my warranty money and going back to Canon...goodluck folks!,-1,1
2143,1,0,I got this camera because it was on sale, a good bargain for a 12 MP camera.,-1,0
2143,1,1,I have a Samsung 52" LCD HD TV that I am so happy about and love a lot.,-1,0
2143,1,2,The price was much less than the competition from Sony or Mitsubishi on the TV I felt like I got a real value and thought I would trust Samsung again because I knew what they are capable of.The SL620 is a nice form factor, fits in my pocket and comes out ready for action quickly.,-1,1
2143,1,3,It has the 12.2 Megapixels and 5x zoom, really astonishing technical achievements in a great package.There are some things that I do not like about this camera that might have been deal breakers had I known about it before my purchase.I really do not like the proprietary USB port and cable.,-1,1

2143,1,16,The "snappiness" of the response leaves a bit to be desired.I also do not like the way the zoom is implemented as a vertical rocker switch up near the top of the trigger.,-1,1
2143,1,17,Your thumb wants to move right and left if you hold the camera like a normal human being, and making it go up and down really makes the zoom clumsy to use, and makes the camera more likely to shake.As I said, I like the form factor, the detail is wonderful, the size and shape are great.,-1,1

2143,1,21,With proper tweaking this camera could have been so much much better.I wonder if Samsung can make a firmware upgrade or something to fix some of my gripes ... though I have never heard of a f/w upgrade for a camera.,-1,1
2144,1,0,worked fine until i had it 4 6mos then broke.,-1,1
2144,1,1,Camera worked fine until i had it for 6 months.,-1,1
2144,1,2,We were on a trip 2 Vegas & we were taking pics & then all the sudden it stopped working.,-1,1
2144,1,3,The picture viewer just shows colored lines up & down, makes a lot of weird noises & all the pics come out looking as I described the view finder.,-1,1
2145,1,0,Beware: Lens Motor Life Span Is Short.,-1,0
2145,1,1,The Canon A40 is simple to operate and takes decent images with its 2 megapixel/3x zoom features.,-1,0
2145,1,2,It's compatible with a Macintosh OS/X and the digital imaging edit software is easy to use.,-1,0
2145,1,3,After six months, the lens jammed and the camera did not function properly.,-1,1
2145,1,4,I mailed the camera back to Canon for repair and less than six months later, the lens broke again while I was changing batteries.,-1,1
2145,1,5,I googled the Canon A40 and learned that other consumers have experienced the same lens jam problem with their Canon A40.,-1,1
2145,1,6,If you buy it, be sure to read the warranty details and have the 800-number ready to call.,-1,1
2145,1,7,Good luck.,-1,1

2146,1,1,This camera is relatively easy to use and takes good 5x7 sized shots, though it pixilates out when you get larger unless you change the res.,-1,0
2146,1,2,Easy to download pictures and uses aa batteries so its easy to stay ready to shoot.I have owned this camera for 1 year and 2 months and the mode dial on the back "locked up".,-1,0
2146,1,3,Could not switch any of the settings or even review pictures.,-1,0
2146,1,4,Called Canon, after I went through all the tech support, email, and faq options on the website, and was told that it was out of warranty and I must send it to a factory repair site.,-1,1
2146,1,5,It costs $115 to just crack the case and look.,-1,1
2146,1,6,Final cost could be more.,-1,1
2146,1,7,That is one half of the cost of a new one.,-1,1
2146,1,8,All for a camera that is barely a year old.,-1,1
2146,1,9,This was my fourth Canon camera (plus 1 video) since switching from Sony but will be my last.,-1,1
2147,1,0,smokingbear maybe right..... i have had this camera for 3 months now.,-1,0
2147,1,1,I took this camera to 2 trips and boy It *was* fun.,-1,0
2147,1,2,I have taken over 4k shots with it, done all kind of shots, outdoor, indoor, day and night shoot, scenary, paranorma(stitch!), stationary / moving , special effect........,-1,0
2147,1,3,But most of my picture(1600x1200) are kind of burr when view @1600x1200.,-1,0
2147,1,4,Disappointed quality compared to my friends canon S200, also a 2M pixel camera.,-1,0
2147,1,5,At first I feel the A40 is very easy to use(of course, there is a learning curve involved.).,-1,0
2147,1,6,The various settings on the camera are easy to set without going thru alot of menu(cf.,-1,0
2147,1,7,The color is Excellent but a bit over saturated.,-1,0
2147,1,8,I found the color is closer to the original subject if u have the 'photoeffect' set to 'neutral'.,-1,0
2147,1,9,Under very favourable/strong lighting condition, the picture quality is excellent.,-1,0
2147,1,10,But the subject cannot be very far away(within  a couple of feet.) or it will burr.,-1,0
2147,1,11,And I have found out most of my distant shot(landscape shot with landscape mode set on A40) are kind of burr too.,-1,0
2147,1,12,Sometimes, some flower marco shots(again u need to set marco mode on the camera) are out of focus.,-1,0
2147,1,13,It is extremely difficult to obtain correct focus on marco/close up shots.,-1,0
2147,1,14,its like a hit and miss thing.,-1,1
2147,1,15,It also wont focus on RED flower.,-1,1
2147,1,16,I dont know if its the Autofocus system malfunction or some other issues.,-1,1
2147,1,17,I have already applied the official canon AF adjustment upgrade(BTW its not a firmware upgrade!) but cannot notice any improvement.,-1,1
2147,1,18,Since I couldnt confirm the 13.6 Focal length problem as mentioned by smokingbear before the update.,-1,1
2147,1,19,But I tend to agree to smokingbear that maybe the update is just a 'patch' to the F/L info and not a 'fix' to the actual focus problem.,-1,1
2147,1,20,In low light condition u definitly need to use flash to get sharp picture.,-1,1
2147,1,21,And this camera will not focus in low light even u have the Canon AF-assist light turned on.,-1,1
2147,1,22,And the redeye reduction flash is a joke.,-1,1
2147,1,23,u will *most* likely  to get redeye if u turned it on.I like the manual function of this camera.,-1,1
2147,1,24,There is alot of (read *alot*)  settings on the manual shutter control(from 15s to 1/1500).,-1,1
2147,1,25,on the other hand, the manual aperture setting has much less to choose from.,-1,1
2147,1,26,Another feature i like is the ability to turn off sharpening.,-1,1
2147,1,27,It can be done later using photoshop, so there is no need to use the onboard sharpening for each photo.The battery life is excellent I have my lcd display on all the time.,-1,0
2147,1,28,Talking about LCD, U do need a bigger monitor to check if your picture is out of focus or not.,-1,0
2147,1,29,Almost all review on this camera never discuss the Auto focus issue which i find interesting.,-1,1
2147,1,30,seems nobody mention canon is notorious about their AF system.,-1,1
2147,1,31,If this camera had the ability to produce focus and sharp 1600x1200 picture all the time,  I will certainly vote A40 to be the best digital camera to own right now.,-1,0
2147,1,32,But this camera can produce maybe just 50% good quality 1600x1200 stuff ...,-1,0
2148,1,0,Not amazing.,-1,0
2148,1,1,We bought this camera to replace a Canon A20.,-1,1
2148,1,2,It turned out to be much more fragile.,-1,1
2148,1,3,The zoom was slightly better and the display screen bigger, but the camera itself is not very tough.,-1,1
2148,1,4,The lens seized up and would not extend fully, nor would it retract.,-1,1
2148,1,5,The camera was still under warranty, so we sent it in for repair.,-1,1
2148,1,6,We were given a refurbished camera to replace it, which also failed, this time out of warranty.,-1,1
2148,1,7,Usually Canon is good.,-1,0
2148,1,8,This one was not.Note:  When it worked it took great pictures and decent video.,-1,0
2148,1,9,Just didn't last long.,-1,0
2149,1,0,Great till it died.,-1,0
2149,1,1,I was happy with this camera, till one day I turned it on and recieved the dreaded "E24" error message.,-1,0
2149,1,2,This message appears and then the camera shuts off.,-1,1
2149,1,3,The only solution is to send it to Canon and pay about as much to repair  it as a replacement 2 mp camera would cost.,-1,1
2149,1,4,My 2 month old Canon printer just died too, so I am reconsidering my loyalty to Canon products.,-1,1
2149,1,5,Both products were barely used before they quit working.,-1,1
2149,1,6,I don't normally recommend extended warranties, but it might be a good idea with this product, or better yet avoid it all together.,-1,1
2150,1,0,Passing grade... Pro: Right size and weight; Easy to use; good photo quality generallyCon: Optical viewfinder inconsistent with actual picture (1) it's considerably smaller (~80%) (2) they're not ajusted to the same center, this really bothers me (I checked with my friend's A40, same thing); Bad indoor/night pictures.,-1,1
2150,1,1,Lately after one year of use, indoor pictures are always very hazy I haven't figures out why.,-1,1
2151,1,0,Great... til it died!,-1,0
2151,1,1,My Canon Powershot A40 was also the most user friendly piece of technology I'd ever used until it died.,-1,0
2151,1,2,Same deal as everyone else I guess.,-1,1
2151,1,3,The thing will turn on but something inside no longer opens as the screen remains blank.,-1,1
2151,1,4,Don't bother upgrading as all Canon cameras are pretty much similar.,-1,1
2151,1,5,My sister-in-law's A75, which is 6 months old, just died of the same cause.,-1,1
2152,1,0,Great while it worked.,-1,0
2152,1,1,After 6 weeks the camera flash stopped working.,-1,0
2152,1,2,Called support, & was instructed to mail it to them insured, and if I'm lucky I'll get it back before Christmas.,-1,1
2152,1,3,On top of being inconvenienced, it will cost me (shipping & insurance) to get it fixed.When it works, it's a great camera.,-1,1
2153,1,0,defective product with great features.,-1,0
2153,1,1,product has great features - and would be of great value for the price if I didn't experience major problems with camera and Canon tech center.,-1,0
2153,1,2,At first, the camera worked great/great pictures.,-1,0
2153,1,3,Over the course of a few weeks, picture quality continued to decline until it got to a point where picture quality was aweful.,-1,0
2153,1,4,I thought perhaps I wasn't using it correctly...that I had dialed in wrong settings, etc.,-1,1
2153,1,5,The Canon tech center refused to believe there was a camera problem.,-1,1
2153,1,6,Finally found a person at Canon who fully agreed that Camera (specifically lens mechanism)was defective...but that Canon would "fix" camera and not replace it.,-1,1
2153,1,7,...  I'll get another digital camera, possibly a Sony....but do not wish to give my business to Canon, except that I've invested money in flash card reader and other Canon-related accessories.,-1,1
2154,1,0,Great... yet not great.,-1,0
2154,1,1,We received the camera right in time for my sister's wedding.,-1,0
2154,1,2,Mother asked me to look at it and figure it out, which I was more than pleased to do.,-1,0
2154,1,3,It was an excellent camera, and I was impressed with all of the features provided.,-1,0
2154,1,4,Less than a half an hour into testing it, something happened.,-1,1
2154,1,5,The view suddenly became extremely blurry and quite ugly.,-1,1
2154,1,6,I worked it over for another hour and a half, trying to figure out what happened.,-1,1
2154,1,7,None of the manuals would help, and I couldn't find anything online.,-1,1
2154,1,8,We had to send it back and use a disposable for my sister's wedding.,-1,1
2154,1,9,We ordered another digital camera, but we've found that we don't like it as much and are currently trying to find another Powershot A40....,-1,1
2155,1,0,Mostly okay, but one major disappointment...,-1,1
2155,1,1,No complaints about picture quality, ease of use, or software.,-1,1
2155,1,2,But one big disappointment...When I saw this camera had a built-in microphone I naturally assumed it was for voice annotation of pictures.,-1,1
2155,1,3,Despite having a built-in mike and even having an icon on the display to represent a picture with an audio attachment, you cannot do voice annotation.,-1,1
2155,1,4,The microphone is only for "movies" - low-resolution, 10-second, video clips.,-1,1
2155,1,5,Something I don't think I will ever use.,-1,1
2156,1,0,A Mistake! A Big MistakeReviewer: MellAKA from Maryland, USAAfter doing a lot of research on the Net, I thought; "ok the lighting is not good and the display is dark, but a lot of people really liked the camera", plus Radio Shack has them on sale this week for $.... Well I should have taken these reviews more seriously.I bought the Fuji 2800 camera to replace my old trusted Kodak 240 digital camera.,-1,1
2156,1,1,I wanted better zoom and a newer camera with the cool new features.What,-1,1
2156,1,2,I got was a camera that did not take low light pictures very well at all and many of my pictures were out of focus.,-1,1
2156,1,3,You might say, well I can live with the low light, I COULD NOT!,-1,1
2156,1,4,I need a camera that produces quality pictures regardless of light.,-1,1
2156,1,5,And my pictures were fuzzy.,-1,1
2156,1,6,NOT good Fuji!,-1,1
2156,1,7,Did you rush this one out the door or what.After calling Fuji's Customer service they told me that I had a defective product and to return it.(Being,-1,1
2156,1,8,in denial I thought, maybe I was doing something wrong, because this camera had the zoom I really wanted.),-1,1
2156,1,9,I did not really want to look at another Fuji after that dissappointing ordeal.I got back on the Net and this time I noticed the Canon PowerShot A40.,-1,1
2156,1,10,(It has 3x optical and 2.5 digital zoom, not the greatest, but decent).,-1,0
2156,1,11,I really liked its reviews and decided I could live with the difficult manual and operation until I learned the camera if it meant I would be getting a good camera.,-1,0
2156,1,12,PLUS, this camera has "MOVIE capabilty, Sound and 4 different picture modes.,-1,0
2156,1,13,I went into ... and they demo'ed it for me and even printed off pictures for me.,-1,0
2156,1,14,I had them set it for me for an event this evening and I was able to use it right out of the box, tonight I'm learning the ins and outs.,-1,0
2156,1,15,I LOVE THIS CAMERA!,-1,0
2156,1,16,It is so cool being able to get a 30 second video on my camera without tugging along my hefty camcorder.,-1,0
2156,1,17,It really is great for short movie clips.,-1,0
2156,1,18,I plan to email them to friends tomorrow.And the picture quality is excellent, when I took my pictures earlier today I did not like the way a couple of them came out so I called ...and they told me I could adjust the color by adjusting the setting (choice of lighting about 6 settings from cloudy, flouresent, etc), worked like a charm.,-1,0
2156,1,19,And the prints are just awesome.What I learned: Listen to the negative comments from owners, they can be right.,-1,0
2156,1,20,Then ask yourself, if your camera turns out to have those problem, can you live with it and be satisfied?More importantly, go to a camera store to demo and buy a camera!,-1,1
2156,1,21,I had never did this before because I felt they would be more expensive based on the expensive models I saw in Sunday's papers, my camera cost $..., which is about what I can get it off the Net.,-1,1
2156,1,22,BUT, in the store (given you have a knowledgable sales person helping you), you can get quick information and demo's to help you make your decision.,-1,1
2156,1,23,And getting the pictures printed off in ... was just too sweet!,-1,1
2156,1,24,BTW; if you do this and your prints do not come out right, the store model settings have probably been played with by shoppers like you and me -lol.,-1,1
2156,1,25,So its great to have someone there who KNOWS camera's and is not just SELLING them!Regardless to what you get, be flexible and be ready to quickly return the camera if you are not satisfied to find what you really want!,-1,1
2157,1,0,There are better choices!,-1,1
2157,1,1,This camera was given to me as a gift from my 3rd cousin.,-1,1
2157,1,2,When I first opened it I was overjoyed to be receiving this camera.,-1,1
2157,1,3,I briefly scanned the manual and began to turn it on.,-1,1
2157,1,4,Right after I switched it on, sparks began to fly from the camera and it caught on fire.,-1,1
2158,1,0,Kodak Easy Share.,-1,0
2158,1,1,The camera takes a great photo.,-1,0
2158,1,2,I can't seem to control the red eye though.,-1,0
2158,1,3,Great printout though - the pictures are send out quality.,-1,0
2159,1,0,Christmas gift.,-1,1
2159,1,1,I think I wrote a review on this product before.,-1,1
2159,1,2,As far as shipment and delivery goes every thing was fine.,-1,1
2159,1,3,As far as the actual product goes it's a Christmas gift so I really can't rate it yet.,-1,1
2160,1,0,Kodak won't service their product.,-1,1
2160,1,1,The kodak camera we purchased worked fine.,-1,1
2160,1,2,The dock broke after approximately 60 pictures.,-1,1
2160,1,3,After tons of communications Kodak passes the buck and does nothing.,-1,1
2160,1,4,Their customer service sucks.,-1,1
2160,1,5,Do not expect them to repair anything that doesn't work.,-1,1
2160,1,6,They lost it for 3 months and then made up an excuse that playdoh was jammed in our dock.,-1,1
2160,1,7,We don't even own play doh or have any in our house.,-1,1
2160,1,8,They are LIARS, do not buy from kodak if you like customer service.,-1,1
2161,1,0,Short lived!,-1,1
2161,1,1,We have been disappointed with both camera and printer during the two and a half years we've had them.,-1,1
2161,1,2,We had to send the camera back twice during the first year for repairs after lengthy, tedious phone conversations with the company to assure them repeatedly that "no, it has not been immersed in liquid" and to go through a list of very obvious things to check for and eliminate reasons for it malfunctioning.,-1,1
2161,1,3,The closure for the battery is now broken on the camera  - we gave up and got a Nikon, which we love.,-1,1
2161,1,4,My sister had similar problems with her Kodak in a short time period as well.,-1,1
2161,1,5,The printer has been very temperamental and has finally died completely.Good quality pictures, easy to use, but I'd recommend paying a bit more to get a product that will last longer and be more reliable.,-1,1
2161,1,6,We have given up on Kodak.,-1,1
2162,1,0,Great TEMPORARY Camera.,-1,0
2162,1,1,Kodak makes great temporary cameras.Only lasts about 1-2 years.Get the warrenty if you purchase this camera.Takes decent pictures while it works.,-1,0
2163,1,0,Good but some flaws.,-1,0
2163,1,1,I've been burned by big brands with poor reliability before, so I chose Fuji after seeing Consumer's Union rate Fuji very reliable.,-1,1
2163,1,2,It's big and clunky, but we wanted that shape to find it quickly in a cluttered diaper bag.Right out of the box, if you've ever had a digital camera before, you barely need the instruction book.,-1,1
2163,1,3,The LCD and viefwinder  are bright, sharp, and are things of beauty.,-1,1
2163,1,4,The on screen menus are great.,-1,1
2163,1,5,The controls and grip are all manageable with one hand, once you learn where they are.,-1,1
2163,1,6,The pictures are 3.2 megapixel great.,-1,0
2163,1,7,The 6x optical zoom makes it easy to take quality face shots from a distance.,-1,0
2163,1,8,Beware ANYBODY'S digital zoom - it's nonsense - only optical counts.The software for your PC is so bad that Fuji should have never shipped it.,-1,0
2163,1,9,So, if you are good with geek stuff, you know how to get your pictures to go where you want them, but if you just want it to be easy, you are out of luck.,-1,0
2163,1,10,This software precludes this camera from being a gift for your mother.,-1,0
2163,1,11,If you manually install the USB driver, Win XP still doesn't see it as a camera.,-1,1
2163,1,12,The Finepix Viewer software is just a Fuji branded Internet Explorer.,-1,1
2163,1,13,There is also one item of software installed called WINASPI.,-1,1
2163,1,14,There is no explanation for what it does, it is installed in your root directory ( a major software no no), it looks like a throwback to Win 3.1 when it's being installed, and it gives you messages suffering from translationitis (For to make setup effective, it necessarily will be for to resart your computing system now.)In,-1,1
2163,1,15,calculating the true cost, at a minimum, you will have to get a 64mb xD card, and you will have to get 8 NiMH AA batteries and a charger.,-1,1
2163,1,16,The use of AA batteries is a huge plus, so when you are walking around Wallyworld and the batteries go dead, you can just buy 4 AAs, as opposed to cameras with proprietary rechargeables.,-1,1
2163,1,17,You will also want some good photo organizing software, and because of the miserable software included, I've discovered a GREAT program online called Picasa -it is a must have GREAT photo organizer.So, I like it, I'm happy I bought it, the price was good, but it's not perfect.,-1,0
2164,1,0,Poor Action shots.,-1,0
2164,1,1,Overall I am very happy with this camera for still shots.,-1,0
2164,1,2,What really gripes me is that if you want to take an action shot, you snap the picture, but it doesnt take the picture right away.....you miss the shot.,-1,0
2164,1,3,There is like a second delay or so.,-1,0
2164,1,4,I do not recommend this camera for action shots.I have tried to adjust the shutter speed but it doesnt help.....you still have that delay.,-1,0
2165,1,0,Performance way too slow, always have to pose people.,-1,0
2165,1,1,I like many features on this camera and it takes very nice pictures.,-1,0
2165,1,2,The camera looks very impressive but falls short on performance.First you have to click the shutter half way to wait for the picture to completely freeze and focus.,-1,1
2165,1,3,Although you thought you may have taken a picturee, not yet.... once the picture unfreezes, then you can press the shutter all the way down to take the picture.,-1,1
2165,1,4,If you to not press all the way down, it will reset the focus.,-1,1
2165,1,5,WHAT A PAIN! If I do not go through this proceedure, the camera will take the picture faster but the picture will not be in focus.Next, the battery life!,-1,1
2165,1,6,After about 15 to 20 indoor shots I need to replace the 4 AA alkalines.,-1,1
2165,1,7,I did get a recharable set and now I can get about almost double the shots but I think this is still not acceptable.Finally, the display.,-1,1
2165,1,8,Nice idea to have an electronic view finder but in low light conditions, I can not see a darn thing!,-1,1
2165,1,9,Pretty bad idea.I know it does not sound great but minus these few gripes, for the price of 160 or so, it is not a bad deal.,-1,1
2165,1,10,I do have many good pictures with excellent quality once you adjust for the shortfalls.,-1,0
2165,1,11,Plus on Ebay you can get xd cards very cheap and you may want to upgrade since 16mb is not nearly enough.,-1,0
2165,1,12,Hope this helps.,-1,0
2166,1,0,Service a big Problem.,-1,1
2166,1,1,I faced a big service issue with Fujifilm.,-1,1
2166,1,2,I bought this camera in March and now I am facing issue with the Flash.,-1,1
2166,1,3,The service engineer tells me that the flash tube and coil are damaged.,-1,1
2166,1,4,I have moved to New Delhi recently and these guys tells me that it will take them confirm that whether the camera is under warranty or not as the bill from Amazon.com does not contains a serial number of the camera.,-1,1
2166,1,5,Even if they find out that camera is under warranty they will just waive off the service charges and not the parts cost.,-1,1
2166,1,6,I would recommend anynody to buy sony products as they are of much better quality though a bit expensive.,-1,1
2167,1,0,serious problem indoors.,-1,1
2167,1,1,This camera takes great pictures, but has one serious problem: it performs lousy indoors.,-1,1
2167,1,2,It has major difficulties focusing in low to medium light conditions, so unless your house is exeptionally well lit, this camera will not focuse on the object.,-1,1
2167,1,3,It is useless at the parties, museumes, classrooms, etc. Again, if place is very well lit or you use it outdoors, it performs very well.,-1,1
2167,1,4,I exchanged it for Sony P72 which like some others has focuse illumination feature and takes crisp pictures indoors.,-1,1
2168,1,0,Very shaky photos and a large file size.,-1,0
2168,1,1,My mom bought this off QVC a few years ago and claimed it was a really great camera (according to them).,-1,0
2168,1,2,The first thing I noticed was that it took shaky photos.,-1,0
2168,1,3,You have to hold it extremely still (as in...stop breathing, stop your blood pulse, and mimic a stone statue) in order for it to take MARGINALLY good photos with a very low blur.,-1,0
2168,1,4,I don't know if mine is just a fluke or what, but one thing that cannot be denied is the high file size.Upload them to your computer and even at the lowest bit setting you're still looking at about 400kb.,-1,1
2168,1,5,Most digital cameras only use 100kb or so, and seeing as how this takes very blurry photos - what's the point of the extra file size?I try to stand as still as I can when taking photos.,-1,1
2168,1,6,Someone exclaimed once "you shouldn't jump up and down when taking photos" - and that's pretty close to how bad the photo quality is.,-1,1
2169,1,0,My first digital camera.,-1,1
2169,1,1,When I first recieved this camera 2 1/2 years ago as a birthday gift, I was excited!,-1,1
2169,1,2,I thought it was the best thing ever!,-1,1
2169,1,3,That was until I purchased a Cannon digital camera recently.,-1,1
2169,1,4,This camera(the S3000) eats up batter life like NO tomorrow!,-1,1
2169,1,5,In the middle of a concert I would have to change the batteries and that did not make me very happy after a while.,-1,1
2169,1,6,I bought a Cannon digital camera a month ago and have only needed to change the batteries ONCE(and I use the camera a lot since I have kids, pets, nephews and nieces).,-1,1
2169,1,7,I also do not like the fact that the S3000 only records silent video(very short video I must add).,-1,1
2169,1,8,My new Cannon powershot camera records video with sound and it's VERY clear...NO need for a seperate video recorder now!This camera is good for a beginner when it comes to digital cameras(just might hand the S3000 off to my Mom), but if you are familiar with digital cameras...don't buy this camera!,-1,1
2170,1,0,Not in dim light.,-1,0
2170,1,1,I purchased this camera for a trip to Yellow Stone, Montana and was very happy with the picture quality.,-1,0
2170,1,2,It was a wonderful trip and all of the pictures were really great.,-1,0
2170,1,3,Unfortunately at a Halloween party I found that the LCD viewfinder was a real problem.,-1,0
2170,1,4,I could not see what I was trying to photograph!,-1,0
2170,1,5,The LCD viewfinder was basically useless!,-1,0
2170,1,6,I simply had to take a best guess at what I was trying to photograph.,-1,0
2170,1,7,(The Flash got me the picture, but frustrating to not see what I was capturing)I had to replace the camera and stuck with Fuji (didn't want to buy a different Mem Card.,-1,1
2170,1,8,Bought the A350 because it is much smaller and real lens viewfinder.Many digital cameras have LCD viewfinders,DON'T DO LCD Viewfinder!!!,-1,1
2171,1,0,BAD PIC'S AND VIDEO.,-1,1
2171,1,1,I WILL NOT EVEN START TO TELL YOU ALL THE BAD ABOUT THIS CAMERA,DON'T LET THE PRICE FOOL YOU! PLEASE DON'T BUY YOU WILL HATE IT AFTER A MONTH!,-1,1
2172,1,0,Very Bad, I hate every company trying to make Non-Standar Products!,-1,1
2172,1,1,If you though this would be the easy PnP camara... naaaaa!,-1,1
2172,1,2,Bad drivers, and the Awful thing is:  The USB Cable, if you lose it, you're busted.,-1,1
2172,1,3,Why does a company needs to come up with a Non-Standar Cable, why? for What? to get money from you when buying the replacement?,-1,1
2172,1,4,that's stupid.Power consumption... another flaw, just a couple of pictures and you're off, total discharge of 4, yes four AA batteries.The rest is acceptable, like any other camera of its generation.,-1,1
2173,1,0,100'S OF DOLLARS IN BATTERY'S!!,-1,1
2173,1,1,I bought the Fugifilm Finepix S3000 about 18 months ago and wish I had spent a little more on another brand.,-1,1
2173,1,2,Thought I was getting a good value from a well known company.,-1,1
2173,1,3,Well everytime I want to use the camera I have to change the batterys.,-1,1
2173,1,4,Doesn't matter if I took 1 or 100 pics the last time I used it.,-1,1
2173,1,5,I have tried all kinds of batterys and it doesn't matter.,-1,1
2173,1,6,The camera seems to use up the life of the battery's even if it is turned off.,-1,1
2173,1,7,So unless you own a battery factory I would not recommend this camera.,-1,1
2174,1,0,I bought this camera about 18 months ago from Amazon.,-1,0
2174,1,1,It never give me a clear picture.,-1,0
2175,1,0,Buyer Beware - No Audio in Video mode on S3000.,-1,1
2175,1,1,Bought this camera at a best buy store - Salesman said it was the new improved variety of the older FinePix 3800.,-1,0
2175,1,2,I had been planning on buying a 3800 soon, before Christmas - since I was all ready sold on my daughter's FinePix 2800, which is a great camera and uses batteries so sparingly (3800 and 2800 are pretty much the same camera but with different pixel densities).However, after I got the S3000 home and shot a few pics, I discovered that this so called 'IMPROVED' version of the 3800 has NO AUDIO mode for the video - whew! what an improvement, 'silent digital movies.',-1,0
2175,1,3,When I returned the 3000 to the store for a refund, I discover that best buy has a 15% restocking fee - cost me $45 to return.,-1,0
2175,1,4,Unhappy me.So today I am searching the net for a good buy on the older 3800, which has Audio & Video - and only a 6X zoom, less than the 10X zoom on the S3000.,-1,0
2175,1,5,So do you want Audio and Video or 10X zoom?,-1,0
2176,1,0,Zero stars... i'm in the process of trying to return this camera.,-1,1
2176,1,1,I haven't been able to get one clear picture indoors or outdoors.,-1,1
2176,1,2,There is a delay from when you take the picture until it's actually taken so you'll miss everything.,-1,1
2176,1,3,Horrible quality.,-1,1
2176,1,4,I can't the get software to work on my mac.,-1,1
2176,1,5,All around terrible.,-1,1
2176,1,6,Even Fuji can't figure out what the problem is with this horrid camera.,-1,1
2176,1,7,Save your money and stay away from this crap.,-1,1
2177,1,0,Don't buy it.,-1,1
2177,1,1,Poor quality images, card won't work.,-1,1
2177,1,2,Very disapointing.After taking some pictures, uploading them, I was quiet unhappy.,-1,0
2177,1,3,Outside and inside both come out horrible.Then, it would only allow me to have one picture before saying memory full because it doesn't come with a memory card but, after a week, it stopped working all together.,-1,0
2178,1,0,Not horrible, not great.,-1,1
2178,1,1,I had high hopes for this camera, but the reality is it is the bottom of the Stylus Tough series.,-1,1
2178,1,2,The shutter speed is so slow that by the time the picture is taken the kids have closed their eyes or walked away.,-1,1
2178,1,3,The flash is so ridiculous that everything has a white haze around it (that is if it isn't completely washed out).,-1,1
2178,1,4,Outdoor pictures are ok, nothing special, the shutter still lags though.,-1,1
2178,1,5,I will be calling Olympus with the hopes that my camera was defective and I didn't in fact purchase a low quality product (the only reason I didn't exchange it is because I foolishly didn't test it out until my return period was up, my fault).On the plus side, I LOVE the one touch HD video recording, and of course, waterproof and shockproof make it great for adventures.,-1,0
2178,1,6,The built in storage is great too, just in case you run out of space on your card.Hopefully, if my unit isn't defective, as the summer goes on, this camera will grow on me!,-1,0
2178,1,7,I've got lots of "watery" vacations in store!,-1,0
2178,1,8,This camera has lots of potential, no doubt about that, I will continue taking pictures and hopefully post some for others to see.Accessory Recommendations:If you buy this product you will most definitely need an adjustable or floating wrist strap (the one it comes with does not tighten around your wrist, and the camera does not float, obviously).,-1,0
2178,1,9,You will also want to buy extra batteries (not too expensive on here) as the battery life is pretty weak.,-1,1
2178,1,10,For a pretty low price you can get a good warranty with accidental damage because lets face it, if you buy a shockproof/waterproof/freezeproof camera you're likely an adventurous person, and some adventures could leave you with a busted camera!,-1,1
2179,1,0,Good choice if you plan to abuse your camera, otherwise, plenty of better choices.,-1,1
2179,1,1,Positives:1) submersible in water to 3m (10 feet),2) shockproof3) will work at extreme temperatures (rated to -10C, around 14F)Negatives:1)Extremely slow, takes about 6 seconds from the time that you turn on the camera to when its ready to take the first picture.,-1,1
2179,1,2,The picture to picture time is also a fairly slow 2 seconds.2) Poor quality of indoor pictures, some blurring as it does not focus well in poor light.,-1,1
2179,1,3,Also some noise on the indoor pictures without flash.3),-1,1
2179,1,4,LCD is not very bright which can be a problem when trying to compose pictures outdoorsSummary:Very easy to use, the current settings appear on the side of the LCD and they are easy to change.,-1,1
2179,1,5,A fairly robust feature set as well as its ruggedness are the main positives.,-1,1
2179,1,6,The poor LCD and very slow response times make it hard to recommend as there are better cameras on the market (see Canon A3100 IS for example).,-1,1
2179,1,7,If you need a tough, rugged, camera you'll probably do better with the Panasonic Lumix DMC FT1.,-1,1
2179,1,8,Bottom line, I bought this camera and within a week was returning it to buy the Canon A3100 IS, and I'm very happy with that choice.,-1,1
2180,1,0,No battery life.,-1,1
2180,1,1,Bought this camera for my 12 year old granddaughter for her birthday.,-1,1
2180,1,2,I thought good choice because of water resistance and drop resistance.Before her vacation, she charged and started practicing with it.,-1,1
2180,1,3,She could only take ab out 20 pics.,-1,1
2180,1,4,before no battery life left.,-1,1
2180,1,5,Tried a few times after charging and the same thing.REturned that camera and ordered a replacement to be shipped to her vacation spot.,-1,1
2180,1,6,The same think happened with that camera - NO BATTERY LIFE AT ALL!!!Finally returned the second one for full credit - now need to find a replacement that can hold a normal charge of at least a days worth of pics.Anyone else with this problem???"Grandma Who Tried",-1,1
2181,1,0,Spend the extra money and buy the 6xxx or 8xxx series.,-1,1
2181,1,1,After having experience with not only the Olympus Tough 6020, 8000 and the 8010 I thought I had a pretty good grip on what to expect from the newer, and less expensive Tough 3000.,-1,1
2181,1,2,I spent a weekend with it, mostly outdoors, and shot many stills and a few videos as well.,-1,1
2181,1,3,It's getting returned to the store today and I hope to find another 80xx to take it's place.While the feature list of the 3000 reads quite similarly to the more expensive models in this family line this is a camera that really does exemplify the old adage "you get what you pay for", in this case, not a lot.,-1,1
2181,1,4,I won't go into great detail about what this camera *should* do; if you are reading this you probably already know that the "Tough" line are designed to withstand pretty good shocks, such as an accidental drop onto pavement, and not only be water resistant but truly water PROOF.,-1,0
2181,1,5,I favor the "Tough" family of cameras over it's obvious competitors as the Olympus Tough line is also one of the only point and shoot cameras in this class that have mechanical image stabilization, a feature not to be underestimated when shooting action on the go.While no camera of mine is ever likely to be tossed at a rock or anything the 3000 has a cheap, plastic feel to it that makes it easy to imagine shattering into a million pieces if it was even to fall out of a pocket onto concrete or something.,-1,1
2181,1,6,The more expensive models, in contrast, feature a much more solid construction with real metal in it, the 8xxx series even having metal reinforcement in key points (the corners) most likely to take a hit.,-1,1
2181,1,7,Likewise, I don't take my cameras scuba diving but I DO live in the rather rain-prone Pacific Northwest and the seal and hinge arrangement on the 3000 appears on close examination to be almost an afterthought, compared to the higher end models.,-1,1
2181,1,8,Opening the single door that conceals the battery, memory card, and cable ports, you can see that there is very little rubber to make a good water proof seal when the door is closed.,-1,1
2181,1,9,Further the hinge feels weak and even brand new can wiggle a bit when tested.,-1,1
2181,1,10,I'd be afraid to see how long this camera could function if fully submersed on a day to day basis.One thing that I really found distracting was that the 3000 has most of it's controls underneath a pliable plastic shield, something like the "bubble" type keys on some old style pocket calculators, television remote controls and even early cell phones, unlike the higher end models which have relatively solid feeling controls made out of metal.,-1,1
2181,1,11,Not only does this give the 3000 a "cheap" build feel but I found it irked me that contacting a control with a thumb or fingertip wasn't always the actual control but rather the raised plastic bit above it.,-1,1
2181,1,12,Pressing down just a bit harder then gave the tactile sensation of actually pressing down on a button.,-1,1
2181,1,13,It made quick navigation of the system feel less natural, less intuitive, and quite possibly a bit slower as well.Battery life was shockingly terrible compared to the more expensive models.,-1,1
2181,1,14,None of these cameras are going to keep you rolling all day long on a single charge, especially if you are recording video and/or using the flash a good deal, but this model was the first of it's kind that made me wish I had purchased SEVERAL spare batteries instead of just one.,-1,1
2181,1,15,It ate up the charge like a kid can eat candy!,-1,1
2181,1,16,Maybe 30 seconds of video and 40-50 still shots on a full charge?Last but not least is image quality, which I can't rate any higher than "Meh.",-1,1
2181,1,17,While the 3000 does have a 12 megapixel CCD it is really only good for web based displays.,-1,1
2181,1,18,Anything larger, such as 12"x print, will reveal lots of chromatic aberration in high contrast areas as well as a lot of noise on any ISO setting above 100, or in just about *any* of the smart modes if you choose not to select your own ISO setting!,-1,1
2181,1,19,Having used some of the higher end models with a similar CCD size, and presumably very similar firmware, my experience with image quality left me feeling suspect that poorer performance had been intentionally built into this model to offset it from the more expensive models in the line up.,-1,1
2181,1,20,Whether that is true or not comparisons to photos I had taken with even the 6020 (only $30 more) revealed in more cases than not that the 3000 was the lowest on the scale of photo quality as well as price.,-1,1
2181,1,21,The flash was OK, not really any worse than any other point and shoot I've used, start up time seemed rather slow, and the auto focus and auto white balance in some of the modes left a good deal to be desired as well.In summary, in general the Olympus Tough line of "point and shoot" cameras are a good choice for outdoors photography in less than favorable conditions and the mechanical image stabilization is a real boon at this price bracket... but I have to leave the 3000 with the feeling that perhaps Olympus has gotten too greedy in trying to completely dominate the market.,-1,0
2181,1,22,This model is a poor representation of the entire line and should be skipped in favor of the slightly more expensive (approx.,-1,1
2181,1,23,+$30) 6xxx series or the MUCH better (and nearly twice as expensive) 8xxx series.,-1,1
2181,1,24,Plan to budget at least one extra battery, preferably two or three even, for an all day adventure, and look for a bundle that includes the separate battery charger as some of the less expensive ones do not.,-1,1
2182,1,0,A Disappointment.,-1,1
2182,1,1,My daughter bought this camera a little over a year ago.,-1,1
2182,1,2,Along with many other reviewers, I agree about the short battery life.,-1,1
2182,1,3,It seemed it needed to be charged all the time.,-1,1
2182,1,4,Also, the camera was very finicky about batteries.,-1,1
2182,1,5,We bought an extra aftermarket battery as a spare and it was tough to get the camera to accept it to charge.,-1,1
2182,1,6,Weird.The worst problem, however, came on our trip to Hawaii in October.,-1,1
2182,1,7,My daughter had taken the camera underwater a few times prior, but when we waded into the ocean and she tried to take a picture, it just fried.,-1,1
2182,1,8,So no underwater photos of the turtles and fish in Hawaii.,-1,1
2182,1,9,Bummer.We thought we were okay, however, since we bought a 2 year extended warranty.,-1,1
2182,1,10,Just got off the phone.,-1,1
2182,1,11,There was "extensive corrosion inside all of the camera either due to accident or operator error" and the warranty doesn't cover that.,-1,1
2182,1,12,Guess that was not money well spent!I like the idea of a camera that is "shockproof & waterproof", but definitely won't buy this one again!,-1,1
2183,1,0,Leakproof Claim Doesn't Hold Water.,-1,1
2183,1,1,I purchased this camera 11 months ago and used it with zero problems in and out of water with great results.,-1,1
2183,1,2,I followed all instructions to the letter for maintenance including rinsing salt water from the camera.,-1,1
2183,1,3,On a trip to BVI this past December the camera failed the first time it was exposed to salt water at a depth of less than 6 inches.,-1,1
2183,1,4,Salt water entered the battery/memory card compartment.,-1,1
2183,1,5,I returned the camera to Olympus expecting a positive response since it fell under the time limit for the warranty, however, they requested $110 to repair it.,-1,1
2183,1,6,This is the first Olympus camera I have owned.,-1,1
2183,1,7,My first two are Nikon, both of which are working fine after numerous years of use.,-1,1
2183,1,8,I will be shopping for a new "tough" camera but not from Olympus.,-1,1
2184,1,0,Olympus stylus tough 3000.,-1,0
2184,1,1,I bought this camera because I had good experiences with other Olympus cameras.I have been quite disappointed in the picture quality.Sharpness and exposure levels are both unacceptable.My old 4 megapixel Olympus actually takes pictures that are twice as good.,-1,0
2184,1,2,I mainly wanted a newer model for the larger viewing screen.Too bad this one is so dissapointing.,-1,1
2185,1,0,Picture Quality is subpar.,-1,0
2185,1,1,I wanted a camera I can bring in the water and mess around with, without being concerned that it will break.,-1,0
2185,1,2,In these terms the camera is fantastic and I have not had any issues.,-1,0
2185,1,3,I chose olympus because I typically get good quality photos out of the point and shoots at a good price but the pictures that come from this camera are poor quality and have horrible focus.,-1,0
2185,1,4,I have messed around with the settings on the camera but the quality is still lacking.,-1,0
2186,1,0,bought camera just over a year ago,battery life very poor,replaced battery before our trip to mexico.went on snorkeling trip,took two pics.,-1,0
2186,1,1,back on boat and saw it had water in it.camera,-1,0
2186,1,2,is fried,very disappointed in the quality of this camera.before,-1,0
2186,1,3,it started leaking water it worked well,took it on 2 vacations,no problems,but cant recommend it based on how short of time it lasted.,-1,1
2187,1,0,Good pool camera for children.,-1,0
2187,1,1,We were excited to get a quality pocket sized camera with some manual feature plus waterproof up to 10 feet!We will be keeping this useless camera by the pool for the kids to play with.,-1,1
2187,1,2,The quality of the photos are sooooo grainy.,-1,1
2187,1,3,Very little detail as if I'm using my son's V-Tech kiddie camera!,-1,1
2187,1,4,I'm camera savvy so I know I have done everything to get a better photo.The indoor candlelight option and panoramic feature are both nice.,-1,0
2187,1,5,But I have not been able to produce a clear photo, indoors or outside!Battery life is very short, videos are nice.,-1,0
2188,1,0,Good for the Average User.,-1,1
2188,1,1,The Olympus Stylus Tough is a good camera for the average person.,-1,1
2188,1,2,It takes good stills images, but sometimes it will focus on the wrong thing.,-1,1
2188,1,3,The video is good, since it shoots in 720p HD.,-1,1
2188,1,4,It does have auto focus, but lags on occasion.,-1,1
2188,1,5,The audio for the video isn't very good.,-1,1
2188,1,6,In a quiet room, you'll hear a bit of "fuzz".,-1,1
2188,1,7,I used this camera mainly for video and I used external audio.,-1,1
2188,1,8,Still works good Pictures.,-1,1
2188,1,9,Overall, a good product to buy for somebody who isn't ready for a SLR, or a DSLR.,-1,1
2188,1,10,Hope this Helps.,-1,1
2189,1,0,Blurry and grainy pictures plus short battery life.,-1,1
2189,1,1,Let me start by saying that I bought this camera to replace my Olympus Stylus 790 SW, the shock and waterproof predecessor to this camera.,-1,0
2189,1,2,We LOVED the 790 SW.,-1,0
2189,1,3,It took GREAT pictures, was easy to use and held up to a LOT of abuse.,-1,0
2189,1,4,But, when my son dropped it and then it was run over by a car, the LCD screen died.,-1,1
2189,1,5,The camera actually still takes pictures but, since we can't see to change settings or frame the pictures we decided to get the next generation to replace it.,-1,1
2189,1,6,What a disappointment.,-1,1
2189,1,7,The Stylus Tough-3000 takes terrible blurry pictures no matter what settings I put it on.,-1,1
2189,1,8,Also, the low light settings result in VERY grainy and orange tinted pictures no matter what I tried.,-1,1
2189,1,9,Also, the old camera could run for days on end of moderate use (including video recording) without needing to recharge the battery.,-1,1
2189,1,10,The new one only lasts for about 1.5 hours of moderate use before it needs charging.,-1,1
2189,1,11,While it is nice that the battery didn't change between the two models, even having the extra battery, it doesn't last through a whole day.,-1,1
2189,1,12,I have been using this camera for a couple of months but, I intend to contact Olympus to let them know how dissatisfied I am and then purchase another new camera.,-1,1
2190,1,0,Great backup camera.,-1,0
2190,1,1,Saved my vacation.,-1,0
2190,1,2,I took this camera as a back up for a trip to China & Thailand.,-1,0
2190,1,3,My primary camera went missing in China after only three days.,-1,0
2190,1,4,We had to depend on this camera for the rest of our trip.,-1,0
2190,1,5,What I want to say is that it was good enough to take pictures where we needed them.,-1,0
2190,1,6,It has a haze on some of the photos when there is a great contrast between light and dark.,-1,0
2190,1,7,It does not take good low light photos, they end up blurry.,-1,0
2190,1,8,The battery is not a winner.,-1,0
2190,1,9,You should always have a second battery for this camera.,-1,0
2190,1,10,Some of the photos were amazing, some were trash.,-1,0
2190,1,11,I reset the camera to factory settings yesterday and it appears to have cleared up whatever was causing some of the clarity issues.,-1,0
2190,1,12,This is a good camera for a rain day.It also fits in a pocket.,-1,0
2190,1,13,Because it is a tough camera, I was not afraid to let my little grandson take pictures with it.,-1,0
2190,1,14,I posted some of the pictures from the trip.,-1,0
2190,1,15,If you have problems with this camera, I say reset it to factory settings, because that is where it works best.,-1,0
2191,1,0,Good underwater / tough camera but won't take better pics than your Canon.,-1,1
2191,1,1,I got this camera specifically for heavy duty traveling.,-1,1
2191,1,2,The pics come out alittle white washed, but after adjusting the exposure you can get it back to normal.,-1,1
2191,1,3,You HAVE to get the auto focus to engage before you take a pic or else it will come out blurry and the auto focus is usually pretty slow.the,-1,1
2191,1,4,pics are no where near the quality of my canon, but this camera will serve a useful purpose.,-1,1
2192,1,0,do not buy this product, has been the worst scam in my life.,-1,1
2192,1,1,do not buy this product, has been the worst scam in my life, to put it into water, it burned, lit anymore and pushed the water through the screen, it's a shame that amazon llc sell this crap!,-1,1
2193,1,0,Does not work as advertised (No Date Stamp) This camera does not date stamp images (necessary for a lot of legal professions).,-1,1
2193,1,1,It only will stamp if you connect the camera to a PictBridge printer making it pretty much useless.,-1,1
2193,1,2,Olympus needs to start adding this option as these cameras appeal to outdoor professionals.,-1,1
2193,1,3,Amazon, please update the listing to clarify.,-1,1
2194,1,0,Decent, useable.,-1,1
2194,1,1,I wanted a cheap, working, point and shoot camera with better quality than my old cell phone, and it works for that.,-1,1
2194,1,2,Aside from adjusting the exposure you may be frustrated with some of the seemingly technical options; white balance only has presets, and if you don't want auto focus your only alternatives are macro and infinity - no manual!,-1,0
2194,1,3,There is a simple mode and a "program" mode with more options, but the camera always defaults to the simple mode when you turn it on.Focus has been the most frustrating thing for me, because with night shots or close-ups, the combination of auto-focus with the motion of my hand pressing the button makes everything blurry every time.,-1,1
2194,1,4,I've gotten around this by using the 2-second timer and holding the camera still after I press the button.,-1,1
2194,1,5,If that sounds terrible, avoid this camera.Picture quality is decent.,-1,1
2194,1,6,14 megapixels seems like a lot less when you zoom all the way in, but close-ups turn out well (when you get them in focus).,-1,1
2194,1,7,Video is 640x480 and again, this isn't amazing, but I'd pick this over any old video camera simply because it doesn't record the sound of a videotape motor (plus digitizing tapes is boring and expensive).Does not come with a memory card, has a tiny amount of internal memory.,-1,1
2194,1,8,You can spend anything from $10-$100 depending on how much you want.,-1,1
2194,1,9,I got 4 GB for $10.The Kodak software - which is not included, you have to download it - is pointless.,-1,1
2194,1,10,The camera doesn't show up as a usb volume on Mac, but it works fine with ImageCapture, so you can install nothing, get the photos, and get on with your life.,-1,1
2195,1,0,Kodak Digital Camera.,-1,0
2195,1,1,The camera itself is very nice, easy to hold, easy to shoot.,-1,0
2195,1,2,I did have a problem with it which is probably an issue only with this particular camera, not all Kodak cameras.,-1,1
2195,1,3,However, the download to be able to share your photos through the computer did not work, and the EasyShare cameras from Kodak are not supported any longer.,-1,1
2195,1,4,I was not able to go online and get a download.,-1,1
2195,1,5,Because I needed the camera for my part-time work, and that work included being able to download photos to a website, I could not use the camera.,-1,1
2195,1,6,Amazon, however, was very generous in refunding the purchase price of this item.,-1,0
2196,1,0,This EasyShare camera is no longer EasyShare.,-1,1
2196,1,1,Kodak has discontinued the download and support that allows connection to your computer.I would like Amazon to include this information in their description.,-1,1
2196,1,2,When an EasyShare camera no longer has that ability this fact should be highlighted in the description.,-1,1
2197,1,0,Amazon sells a camera that is no longer supported by the manufacturer.,-1,1
2197,1,1,When the software to transfer pictures didn't work, I was left with a limited function camera.,-1,1
2197,1,2,Thanks for nothing, Amazon and Kodak, not cool.,-1,1
2198,1,0,Pleased with camera, disapointed there is no kodak software.,-1,1
2198,1,1,I am pleased with the camera, but inability to download to a computer via USB cable was disappointing, and lack of Kodak software sort of negates the whole point of "easy share", as I have to remove the sd card and put it in my computer's slot to download photos.,-1,1
2198,1,2,I feel this should have been made clear in the description.,-1,1
2198,1,3,Also the full instruction manual was not included, I had to find it on the internet.,-1,1
2198,1,4,I guess this is to be expected when you buy an orphaned product.,-1,1
2199,1,0,DO NOT BUY THIS!  KODAK is bankrupt and there is no product support of any kind for this!,-1,1
2199,1,1,When I hooked it to my computer the software installation gave me an error.,-1,1
2199,1,2,Well, Kodak offers no download and no support whatsoever, not even FAQS!,-1,1
2199,1,3,Their message was that if I have already downloaded software I can feel free to continue using it!I now have a completely unusable product.,-1,1
2199,1,4,This was my 7-yr-old's big Christmas gift and I regret this purchase.,-1,1
2200,1,0,cheap but ok for the money.,-1,1
2200,1,1,the badI had some software problems getting pics off it onto my PC, it started braking on a camp out.,-1,1
2200,1,2,I got sand in it and it would not turn on and the zoom broke.,-1,1
2200,1,3,you might be able to find something better.,-1,1
2200,1,4,but I will keep it as a cheap camera to use and abuse.the,-1,1
2200,1,5,goodfixed the software problem.,-1,1
2200,1,6,I got the sand out and now its working fine now.,-1,1
2200,1,7,zoom and all. it came with rechargeable battery's and a recharger that lasted a 11 day trip in witch I took 700 picsif you want a cheap camera for your kids to have, or your self.,-1,1
2200,1,8,if it gets broken or lost it its not a big deal, this is it.,-1,1
2201,1,0,Broken on/off switch.,-1,1
2201,1,1,The on/off switch doesn't work, I can't find a phone number to contact the seller.........I had it looked at, and the the person at the shop said it was defective..............it's almost like it has a short in the connection,-1,1
2202,1,0,I bought it in November and by January it already broke, the lens won't come out.,-1,1
2202,1,1,Didn't drop it, nothing but take pictures.. Is it any wonder Kodak is going out of business?,-1,1
2203,1,0,picture.,-1,1
2203,1,1,I took better clear pictures using my GS4.,-1,1
2203,1,2,I am returning the item.,-1,1
2203,1,3,it was not worth the money I spent,-1,1
2204,1,0,:/ I bought this way ahead of time to give as a christmas present.,-1,1
2204,1,1,It works great except for the sound...that doesnt work...and i was not able to return because the time window closed before christmas got here.,-1,1
2205,1,0,I bought this camera for my son.,-1,1
2205,1,1,It's been a good buy, right until he filled the camera up with pictures and I had to download them to make room on the camera.,-1,1
2205,1,2,We use Windows 7 - and Kodak DOES NOT SUPPORT WINDOWS 7!!!  Are you kidding me?!I went to the Kodak site to see if there was updated software, and received this message:  KODAK EASYSHARE Software is no longer available as a download.,-1,1
2205,1,3,We no longer provide live support (phone or email) for EASYSHARE Software.,-1,1
2205,1,4,We regret any inconvenience to you.Fortunately, I work in IT and was able to make a Windows XP VirtualBox machine to get the pictures off it (not easy), but for the average user, that simply isn't an option.If you have Windows XP, then you will not have a problem with this camera.,-1,1
2205,1,5,If you have a SD card reader, you won't have any issues either.,-1,1
2205,1,6,If you have Windows Vista or later you *will* have problems retrieving your pictures.,-1,1
2206,1,0,Inexpensive and easy to use.,-1,0
2206,1,1,My daughter needed a cheap digital camera for a high school class.,-1,0
2206,1,2,It's easy to use, and she's gotten some good photos with it, too.,-1,0
2207,1,0,Worth The Money.,-1,1
2207,1,1,I purchased this camera for my 5 year old son's birthday.,-1,1
2207,1,2,He wanted a camera and he's to that age where he didn't want a "baby" camera.,-1,1
2207,1,3,It's fairly inexpensive and he is taking amazing pictures!,-1,0
2208,1,0,Kodak C1530 Digital Camera.,-1,1
2208,1,1,The software to put the images on the computer cannot be dowloaded fro Kodak anymore.,-1,1
2208,1,2,The images were not as high-quality as I would have liked and I have returned the camera for a refund.,-1,1
2209,1,0,can't get service from blueproton (seller), amazon or kodak.,-1,1
2209,1,1,perfect inexpensive camera if it would work.,-1,1
2209,1,2,view finder went black and no longer takes photos.,-1,1
2209,1,3,blueproton, the seller through amazon, does not accept ANY returns for ANY reason after 30 days.,-1,1
2209,1,4,bought this on june 28th for my grandson who took a trip and got back a few days ago, 40 days.you,-1,1
2209,1,5,can't even contact blueproton or amazon directly about it and kodak's help line doesn't work.we,-1,1
2209,1,6,just pi$$ed away $50 but it won't happen twice.,-1,1
2209,1,7,i will not buy any product from amazon that is sold by blueproton and will buy less from amazon.what,-1,1
2209,1,8,service when there is NONE?,-1,1
2209,1,9,save your money and buy locally.,-1,1
2209,1,10,even walmart would have exchanged the damn thing which is all i want.you are better off to go to walmart or target since you're only saving $5.,-1,1
2210,1,0,software is not supported for windows 7 or 8.,-1,1
2210,1,1,If you have a modern computer, forget about finding a driver for this camera.,-1,1
2210,1,2,Kodak is not supporting it, and the Kodak software was not apparently updated for Windows 7.,-1,1
2210,1,3,So much for the "Easy Share Software"/  Only under pressure did I get a driver for the camera.,-1,1
2210,1,4,Good luck for the rest of us.,-1,1
2210,1,5,To be fair, America can not make cameras.,-1,1
2211,1,0,Didn't seem to work.,-1,1
2211,1,1,I opened the package and tried to take a picture but the button wouldn't press down.. so unless I'm that technologically challenged, it didn't appear to work.,-1,1
2212,1,0,The phone is okay, the pictures are okay.,-1,1
2212,1,1,There is no share software available which I was not aware of.,-1,1
2212,1,2,I needed a camera in a hurry and didn't do my homework.,-1,1
2212,1,3,You can obviously take out the card and put into computer but would have been nice to been able to just share onto sites or emails.,-1,1
2213,1,0,TAKES BLURRY PICTURES!!!!!,-1,1
2213,1,1,We bought this camera for my 11-year-old son who is his Boy Scout troop's photographer because my Kodak EasyShare Z760 is to hard for him to turn on and off.,-1,1
2213,1,2,The Kodak EasyShare C1530 is easy to use, just turn it on and click but all his action photos come out blurry.,-1,1
2213,1,3,My husband then tried to take some pictures himself but again they turned out blurry.,-1,1
2213,1,4,We ended up with 259 blurry pictures of the boys bowling.,-1,1
2213,1,5,It does take okay pictures of non-moving things but don't let the 14mp fool you, my 6mp Kodak EasyShare C1530 takes better photos.,-1,1
2213,1,6,We are very disappointed!!,-1,1
2213,1,7,Although it is very easy to use, I would not recommend this camera; you would be much better off spending a little more money and buying a better camera.,-1,1
2214,1,0,Didn't work correctly.,-1,1
2214,1,1,The camera shipped to me must have been a faulty one, because whenever I tried to snap a picture it would completely crash (or otherwise turn off without warning).,-1,1
2214,1,2,It would also randomly crash whenever I left it on for longer than 5 seconds.The camera shipped to me also has a broken pixel on the LCD screen.,-1,1
2214,1,3,A minor issue I can honestly deal with, but it's kind of the icing on the cake in this situation!It's unfortunate, but you have to expect terrible quality when a 14 MP camera comes priced below 50 dollars.,-1,1
2214,1,4,:) Do yourself a favor and spend your hard-earned money on something much more reliable.,-1,1
2215,1,0,Kodak C1530.,-1,1
2215,1,1,This product failed.,-1,1
2215,1,2,Although attractively priced and having the Kodak label it just didn't make it.,-1,1
2215,1,3,I bought this camera to replace a Kodak Easyshare DX 7440 so I have familiarity with the Kodak product lineKodak EasyShare C1530 14 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Red).,-1,1
2215,1,4,This camera would not take close-ups - even Photoshop wouldn't clean up the blurring.,-1,1
2215,1,5,It did not handle light well - when comparing shots I had taken with the DX 7440 of the same subject, the comparison was not even close.,-1,1
2215,1,6,For kids it may be a great starter camera but for even a casual user it is a waste of money.,-1,1
2215,1,7,I returned this item and appreciated the no-hassle return.,-1,1
2216,1,0,Batteries overheated in the camera while it was off.,-1,1
2216,1,1,I bought this camera in April of 2012 (there's a reason they only guarantee these things for a year).,-1,1
2216,1,2,After a few months I was having trouble with my computer recognizing the camera when I hooked it up to the USB port.,-1,1
2216,1,3,The miniUSB port on the camera became loose and eventually the piece that allows you to hook the cord into the camera broke off and fell inside of it.,-1,1
2216,1,4,So then there was the piece rattling inside the camera every time you moved or tilted it.,-1,1
2216,1,5,After that, I bought a little USB SD card reader, so that if I wanted to download anything to the computer I would take the memory card out and put it in the reader and get my pictures and video off that way.About two weeks ago, I bought brand new 4 pack of Energizer lithium ion batteries, which is what I usually use for the camera, and when I put the first two batteries in, the camera did not respond at all.,-1,1
2216,1,6,Didn't say the battery was low and shut back off, nothing.,-1,1
2216,1,7,As though there were no batteries in it.,-1,1
2216,1,8,I switched them every which way in case I had them in wrong.,-1,1
2216,1,9,At that point I concluded that the camera just crapped out and I needed to by a new one.,-1,1
2216,1,10,About a week or so later out of desperation, I tried the final two batteries on the off chance they would work and the camera fired right up.,-1,1
2216,1,11,A week or so after that, the camera was non-responsive after that.,-1,1
2216,1,12,And again, this was not a case of drainage after too much use-- there was no low battery indicator as I was familiar with seeing, the camera just didn't respond.Well, there was a chance that the pack of batteries I purchased was itself faulty, but as I didn't want to shell out a good $10 for a second pack of 4 lithium ion batteries in less than a month, I bought a cheaper pack of 6 regular Duracell batteries.,-1,1
2216,1,13,I thought the worst that could happen was that the batteries just wouldn't last as long, but mentally I didn't want to do the exact same thing and have the exact same thing happen again.,-1,1
2216,1,14,I put the Duracells in the camera that night and used the camera as normal.,-1,1
2216,1,15,No more than for about 5 minutes consecutively.Well today, I was sitting on the couch, and my camera just so happened to be laying there next to me (in the Kodak camera case that I also purchased-- and works fine:) and I noticed that it was a little warm.,-1,1
2216,1,16,At first I thought it was from my body heat but I started to suspect that it was a little too hot for that.When I removed the camera it was hot to the touch on the side where the batteries were.,-1,1
2216,1,17,I opened it, but of course didn't want to touch the batteries and I couldn't tell if they were swollen.,-1,1
2216,1,18,I shook the camera and the first battery fell out onto the coffee table.,-1,1
2216,1,19,I shook it again a few times and the second battery bounced off the table onto a box of cookies and is now stuck to it by the melted plastic, hanging diagonal on the side of a box of cookies.I did a google search about perhaps average batteries used in high capacity electronics ever causing an overheat, but everything I researched simply suggested what I initially thought-- which is that it just drains those batteries faster.,-1,1
2216,1,20,There were a few things about digital cameras overheating, but that was only for when they were actually in use for long periods, and this camera was powered off.,-1,1
2216,1,21,I can only conclude then that the problems that I have been having are not with the batteries, which have been consistent up to now, but with the camera.When I bought this camera last year, I paid about $70.,-1,1
2216,1,22,I won't say that it was a waste of money, but it was a very expensive 1 year camera rental.,-1,1
2216,1,23,In light of the other reviews, I can only deduce that I got one of the "duds," the 0.3% of the product that for whatever reason, is just faulty.,-1,1
2216,1,24,This year I have a 2 month old son, and I'm one of the poor people that doesn't use a smart phone just a basic one, so it really sucks to be without a camera right now.Next time I will be choosing a different brand altogether, and make sure I stay within the current price point b/c this is all a bit too painful.,-1,1
2217,1,0,iti might be fine, but it DOES NOT WORK WITH MY computer and I think this should be warned.,-1,1
2217,1,1,I mean what is the point?,-1,1
2217,1,2,If you have a camera and can't empty the pictures someplace.,-1,1
2217,1,3,I have windows 8 and it is incompatible, and maybe I missed it, but I didn't see that warning.,-1,1
2217,1,4,The batteries were hard to put in, battery cover, insert area feels like junk.,-1,1
2217,1,5,but I had another easyshare and  iwas happy with it so thought I'd take a chance.it is good looking and not expensive.,-1,1
2218,1,0,Not Worth The $$ This camera seemed really nice online, but when I received it in the mail, I was surprised to see that it is actually mostly plastic (not metal).,-1,1
2218,1,1,When there are no batteries inside, it actually feels like a thin, plastic toy.,-1,1
2218,1,2,The zoom was the worst.,-1,0
2218,1,3,I tried zooming in on an object in the room- the item looked closer without the zoom than with it.,-1,0
2218,1,4,For the price, you could find a much better camera out there.,-1,1
2218,1,5,If it had only been half the price, maybe I could have considered it to be a good buy.,-1,1
2218,1,6,Now, I'm having to pay to return the item just so that I can get a camera that works.,-1,1
2218,1,7,I wouldn't waste your money.,-1,1
2219,1,0,Do not buy this camera!,-1,1
2219,1,1,It broke after 3 days of use.,-1,1
2219,1,2,Kodak does not support it anymore.,-1,1
2219,1,3,The return window has passed (got this as a present for my mom more than a month ago).,-1,1
2220,1,0,This is one of those times that you get what you pay for.,-1,1
2220,1,1,It's a good starter camera for anyone.,-1,1
2220,1,2,The video aspect could be much better!,-1,1
2220,1,3,I took it to a concert and was super disappointed at the quality of the video.,-1,1
2220,1,4,Like I said, it is decent camera for the beginner.,-1,1

2223,1,1,For the first week this camera worked really well, then it stopped working.,-1,1
2223,1,2,It looks like it is starting to turn on but just shuts back down.,-1,1
2223,1,3,Had bought a warranty but still have not heard back from the company after months of correspondence to them.,-1,1
2224,1,0,Waste of money.,-1,1
2224,1,1,I've never been more disappointed with a Kodak camera than I am with this one; it won't hold a charge; I've always owned a Kodak but now I t think it is time for a change.,-1,1
2225,1,0,wish I hadn't bought it.,-1,1
2225,1,1,I cannot even down load the pictures I take onto my computer because it doesn't tell you in the description that you have to purchase separate stuff to do that.,-1,1
2225,1,2,I don't even use the camera because we live 45 miles from the nearest store to download them.,-1,1
2225,1,3,Wish I could get my money back on this one.,-1,1

2228,1,1,wish it had a rechargeable battery pack so I can plug it in and charge it.,-1,1
2228,1,2,It messes up a lot and decides to shut off on it's own or go to a black screen,-1,0
2229,1,0,no good.,-1,0

2231,1,1,When I attached the USB cable to the computer, I got an error message.,-1,1
2231,1,2,I was about to give up and return the camera when I noticed on the LCD that I had the option of disabling EasyShare.,-1,1
2231,1,3,I tried that; then my installation and file transfer to my computer went smoothly.,-1,1
2231,1,4,The camera itself is very nice and takes good pictures.,-1,1

2234,1,1,I could not get the software to load on my laptop and Kodak no longer supports the software so I was stuck.,-1,1
2235,1,0,BEWEARE Not for Windows 7!!!,-1,1
2235,1,1,No download program for installation of transferring pictures from camera to computer.Went to Kodak site and no download available for windows 7!!!Amazon was very courteous about giving a refund!,-1,1
2236,1,0,Decent for light, amateur, or around-the-house use.,-1,1
2236,1,1,It is ok for what I use it for, just around the house, not professionally.,-1,1
2236,1,2,I think this may have been a clearance model, thus explaining the low price I paid.,-1,1
2236,1,3,If you just want a similar Kodak model for rather light use, this is ok.,-1,1
2237,1,0,software wouldn't load.,-1,1
2237,1,1,I got this as a gift and returned it.,-1,1
2237,1,2,The camera worked, but I can't speak to the quality because when I plugged it into the computer to upload the pictures, the software wouldn't install.,-1,1
2237,1,3,I tried on a brand new laptop after it wouldn't work on my older computer and got the same exact error.,-1,1
2237,1,4,I went to Kodak's website to contact them and in doing so saw something indicating that EasyShare software has been discontinued....yet this was using EasyShare software, so you're still selling them why?,-1,1
2237,1,5,And I sent Kodak a message to ask if they could help me because I wanted to love this camera.,-1,1
2237,1,6,This was replacing a similar Kodak that I've had for 7 years and is starting to go.,-1,1
2237,1,7,I also have another wonderful Kodak that is too bulky for keeping in my purse like this one.,-1,1

2237,1,9,been a month since I contacted Kodak and still have not gotten a response from them!,-1,1
2237,1,10,I found my EasyShare software disc to install on my new laptop so that I could use my old Kodak until I get a new camera (the picture software that came with the laptop is really basic) and it installed, but wouldn't work once I did.,-1,1
2237,1,11,I clicked help to find out what was going on and found many, many messages stating that they no longer support or offer any assistance with EasyShare software.,-1,1
2237,1,12,Which, begs the question of why they are selling them???,-1,1
2238,1,0,Kodak no longer supports the EasyShare software.,-1,1
2238,1,1,The EasyShare software is no longer available for download or supported by Kodak.,-1,1
2238,1,2,We bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law to easily share photos on facebook.,-1,1
2238,1,3,However without the accompanying software, the camera is not worth the money.,-1,1
2239,1,0,not too impressed.,-1,0
2239,1,1,I used to own a very similar kodak about 6 yrs ago and I loved that one.,-1,0
2239,1,2,This one does not have very good picture quality especially if it is not bright and sunny out.,-1,0
2239,1,3,I would not recommend getting this camera at all.,-1,0
2240,1,0,Did not work.,-1,1
2240,1,1,Ordered for my son's birthday and when it arrived it would not turn on.Looked nice otherwise but we returned it and ordered a different brand.,-1,1
2241,1,0,NO disc included or online download not available on www.Kodak to get pics to computer.,-1,1
2241,1,1,I would have given 4 or 5 stars, but there was no disc in box to make camera connect to computer to get pics off of it, and www.kodak says the download is no longer available...so I have to manually put the SD Card in my computers hard drive to get pics off the camera, when I usually like to plug the camera in by the cord.,-1,1
2241,1,2,I had to monkey around with that and then had my husband try computer savvy husband try too, and we gave up.,-1,1
2241,1,3,I had a few auto focus blurry shots--but did ok on hiking trip and cave hike with decent flash.,-1,1
2241,1,4,Photos good for a cheap decent/camera that I don't mind losing or breaking.,-1,1
2242,1,0,camera doesn't work.,-1,1
2242,1,1,there was some problem with the lense; it would move in and out with no reason.,-1,1
2242,1,2,i had a hard time getting the lense to retract so i could return the camera in the box it came in.,-1,1
2242,1,3,i've loved all my kodaks before because they are simple and take great pictures.,-1,0
2242,1,4,i always carried mine in my purse.,-1,1
2242,1,5,never got the software to work though.,-1,1
2243,1,0,Camera works like a cheap dollar store camera.,-1,0
2243,1,1,I've been using a Kodak C310 digital camera for the last 8 years and love it..,-1,1
2243,1,2,I thought I'd buy another easy share before it's too late since Kodak is discontinuing digital camera's.. Boy was I disappointed in this camera..,-1,1
2243,1,3,The camera itself is very attractive, easy to hold and easy to take pictures, which is why I gave it a 1 instead of 0..,-1,1
2243,1,4,But the pictures turn out horrible..,-1,1
2243,1,5,I tried using this to take pictures of dolls to add to my website.,-1,1
2243,1,6,No matter what setting I used, with or without the flash, any design in the fabric came out all squiggly and the doll's hair came out looking "shimmery".,-1,1
2243,1,7,This is something I used to deal with 12 years ago with the earliest digital cameras..,-1,1
2243,1,8,It certainly isn't something I expected to see from new camera purchased in 2013..,-1,1
2243,1,9,I requested a return, but then played around with it thinking maybe I just needed to spend more time figuring it out, so I didn't return it..,-1,1
2243,1,10,I have put hours into this camera trying to get a good picture.. It's so iffy, you can take two pictures, one right after another, with the same setting.,-1,0
2243,1,11,One will come out okay and the other will be all blurry.. you just can't depend on it to take good pictures..,-1,0
2244,1,0,I bought this Kodak because I had one before and liked it.,-1,1
2244,1,1,Unfortunately, Kodak went out of business a couple of years ago so when I experienced software problems with this camera, they told me that the software was no longer available and sorry for the inconvenience.,-1,1
2244,1,2,Take it from me, I never expected a brand new camera to have a problem but it did and there was no one there to help.,-1,1
2244,1,3,I have since returned it and am going with a camera from a company that is still in business!!,-1,1
2244,1,4,Thanks Amazon for making this process of returning it tolerable.,-1,1
2245,1,0,Why does everyone say they wish they could give this zero stars?,-1,1
2245,1,1,One star means we/you/I hated it, and we did.,-1,1
2245,1,2,We used it for two or three days and then it stopped working.,-1,1
2245,1,3,It was never dropped, soaked, stepped on or abused and the screen went purple and it would not take pictures.,-1,1
2245,1,4,We tried to reset it by taking out batteries and holding on/off keys and nothing helped.,-1,1
2245,1,5,We liked the price but no matter how cheap I am, I always seem to relearn the lesson of you get what you pay for.,-1,1
2246,1,0,Stopped working.,-1,1
2246,1,1,I bought this camera for my grandson on Oct 25th and on Jan20th it stopped working.,-1,1
2246,1,2,It won't startup even with new batteries.,-1,1
2246,1,3,It is not replaceable and I'm very unhappy.,-1,1
2247,1,0,NOT A GOOD DEAL.,-1,1
2247,1,1,IT ATE BATTERIES AND THEN IT DESTROYED THE PICTURE CARD, WOULDN'T DOWNLOAD DIRECTLY TO MY COMPUTER OR SET UP THE SOFTWARE ON MY COMPUTER AND HAD NO TECH SUPPORT,-1,1
2248,1,0,my previous Kodak EasyShare was better.,-1,1
2248,1,1,I couldn't load up pictures and when i tried to contact Kodak I was directed to a website that was of no help.,-1,1
2248,1,2,I finally ended up sending it back.,-1,1
2249,1,0,the software used to install the data for this camera is discontinued so i cant take pictures off camara to put on the computer!,-1,1
2249,1,1,The software used to transfer pics from camera to computer is outdated I bought the camera for business purposes and I have all my pics for work and I can't upload them now to use them for work!,-1,1
2249,1,2,So I wasted time and money on this camera.,-1,1
2250,1,0,didn't recieve all it was supposed to include.,-1,1
2250,1,1,Camera came with dead batteries that wouldnt hold a charge & the battery charger was missing.,-1,1
2251,1,0,Shipping was perfect, but I purchased this camera because I accidently broke my first camera during my nephew's High School graduation.,-1,0
2251,1,1,You get what you pay for.....this camera is typical and basic.,-1,1
2251,1,2,I'm unable to play previous recorded video's saved on my memory card on this camera.,-1,1
2252,1,0,It does not have 720P HD video.,-1,1
2252,1,1,I am surprised that the specs mention 720P HD but I received the camera today & the max video res is 640 x 480 only!!!,-1,1
2253,1,0,Great pictures!,-1,0
2253,1,1,Hate the batteries.,-1,1
2253,1,2,I like the camera for the pictures but i HATE having to deal with dead batteries and not being able to charge it via a cable :( have had it for a wk and happy with the quality of pictures.,-1,1
2253,1,3,If you like having a camera that can charge then don't purchase this camera,but if you dont mind then its a good price for  good pictures,-1,1
2254,1,0,garbled audio.,-1,1
2254,1,1,All the videos have garbled audio.,-1,1
2254,1,2,Also, the Sharebutton App no longer supports uploading to YouTube.edit:,-1,1
2254,1,3,Though Windows Media Player garbles the audio, Nero Showtime plays it correctly.,-1,1
2255,1,0,I just got camera but no manual.,-1,1
2255,1,1,I just got my camera and was so disappointing that it didn't come with a complete extended users guide I have to go to kodak websight to look at it.,-1,1
2255,1,2,I can't even call or talk to them because it's the weekend.,-1,1
2255,1,3,I hope they will send me one.,-1,1
2255,1,4,Plus the price was reduced after I purchased it, so annoying.,-1,0
2256,1,0,Kodak Camera.,-1,1
2256,1,1,I rate this product subpar because the product was faulty.,-1,1
2256,1,2,Its on/off switch never worked right, I returned the product and the retailer immediately credited my account.,-1,1
2257,1,0,Wrong camera.,-1,1
2257,1,1,I bought this camera thinking it was under water, as family had one shapped the same.,-1,1
2257,1,2,I must read all literature on product in future, sent back no problem with that.,-1,1
2258,1,0,Pictures turn out blurry.,-1,0
2258,1,1,I'll put some samples here of some pictures I took that were in Auto mode that turned out blurry.,-1,0
2258,1,2,It's a nice looking camera.,-1,0
2258,1,3,It looks nice and sleek, but whats the point if it doesn't do what its suppose to do.,-1,0
2258,1,4,I use to have a canon powershot and it took better pictures and upgraded to this.,-1,1
2258,1,5,Even my camera phone takes better pictures.,-1,1
2258,1,6,When I snap photo's, I only pray that they'll turn out good.,-1,1
2259,1,0,Nice images.,-1,1
2259,1,1,I loved the quality of images with this Nikon, but after about a year and a half it broke and would not turn on.,-1,1
2260,1,0,Terrible images..,-1,1
2260,1,1,This camera sucks..I had such a hard time getting it to NOT be blurry or messed up.,-1,1
2260,1,2,I just gave up and started using my Iphone and Ipad for pictures.,-1,1
2260,1,3,They came out so much better then this thing.,-1,1
2261,1,0,I ordered this camera after my college graduation, because I needed another small digital camera.,-1,1
2261,1,1,I have a Nikon D80 SLR and a Nikon Coolpix S3 (which i've had for 5 years and has been amazing).,-1,1
2261,1,2,I thought upgrading to this Nikon Coolpix S4100 would be better than my S3, but it's not much better.,-1,1
2261,1,3,The pictures don't look any better than they did when taken on my S3.,-1,1
2261,1,4,The touch screen is kind of annoying at times, and sometimes the screen will freeze up.,-1,1
2261,1,5,I've noticed my pictures sometimes seem blurry, and the night mode is not as great as I thought it would be.,-1,1
2261,1,6,It's light weight, easy to charge, and the 4GB SD card is awesome, but the case is ok, and the camera is ok.,-1,1
2261,1,7,I would not buy again.,-1,1
2262,1,0,Nikon COOLPIX  S4100 Digital  Camera Gift Pack.,-1,1
2262,1,1,The package arrived OK, BUT the 4GB SD Memory Card was missing.,-1,1
2262,1,2,I've been trying to contact AMAZON ever since, to try to get a new memory card, but CANNOT find a way to contact them- No phone number is available and all attempts at email cpntacts  FAILED.,-1,1
2262,1,3,This seems like a deliberate attempt by AMAZON to discourage contacts.,-1,1
2262,1,4,PLEASE SEnd ME THE MISSING 4GB SD Memory Card.,-1,1
2262,1,5,Please NOTIFY ME me how  to contact AMAZON in the future in case I ever try to purchase anything from AMAZON again I would give a 5 ster rating except for my problems in trying to replace the missing memory card..,-1,1
2263,1,0,Nice camera, for being low end.,-1,1
2263,1,1,I received the camera quickly from Amazon.com and I was impressed how the packaging was done from sony, tight, small, minimal.I was able to play with this camera for a few days before I finally decided to return it though.,-1,1
2263,1,2,The camera takes amazing macro shots up close to a variety of items.,-1,0
2263,1,3,The zoom is ok for being 4x optical.,-1,0
2263,1,4,I've never owned such a slim camera before, and I was impressed how the zoom didnt extend out of the body.,-1,0
2263,1,5,Having the slide up/down cover was also nice for protecting the Carl Zeiss lense.Probably my biggest negative issue with the camera is the touch screen.,-1,1
2263,1,6,With other touch screen cameras having multi touch, and being responsive, I felt like I was using a touch screen from 5+ years ago.,-1,1
2263,1,7,You had to press hard and where you wanted to touch.,-1,1
2263,1,8,I was heavily dissapointed because of the cost of the camera, and how poor the touch screen sensitivity, and resolution was.,-1,1
2263,1,9,You can literally see the gaps between each pixel, and it's to the point you cant even tell if you're last shot photo is sharp or not.Another issue was the quality of the images.,-1,1
2263,1,10,My old 7MP canon SD1000 took better photos at a smaller file size.,-1,1
2263,1,11,A camera this expensive should atleast perform better.For the specs of this camera, I'd look into Sony's other cameras.,-1,1
2263,1,12,Let style and thinness slide by this time, get performance and quality in another camera instead.,-1,1
2264,1,0,Took beautiful pictures ans videos.,-1,1
2264,1,1,Imagine my dismay on my vacation when the LCD screen went out and my camera was useless.,-1,1
2264,1,2,I hope this is just me having a faulty lemon cause I liked the sleekness of this item.,-1,1
2265,1,0,Good pictures for the size - but has proprietary cable.,-1,1
2265,1,1,I used this camera for the first time while I was on vacation in Prague.,-1,1
2265,1,2,The quality of the pictures taken outdoors are as good or better than you would expect from a camera with a lens this size.,-1,1
2265,1,3,They images are more than adequate for Facebook and printing 4x6s.,-1,1
2265,1,4,Photos taken in lower light conditions are grainy but not any more so than I would expect.This review would have been 4 stars if it were not for one single problem.,-1,1
2265,1,5,The camera ships without a charger but does include what looks like a micro USB cable.The included cable is actually NOT a micro USB cable but a proprietary Sony cable that looks like micro USB.,-1,1
2265,1,6,Having brought only a mini and micro USB to charge everything else I own I was unable to charge the camera.I spent three hours scouting the tourist areas of Prague for a means to charge this camera.,-1,1
2265,1,7,I finally gave up and paid twice retail for another camera to use for the remainder of my trip.When I returned home I bought a universal battery charger.,-1,1
2265,1,8,I must have figured I had plenty of micro USB cables and tossed the cable that came in the box.,-1,1
2265,1,9,If I travel with this camera again I will bring a pocket full of charged Sony 'N' batteries.I can't begin to understand why Sony would do something like this.,-1,1
2265,1,10,I thought they would have learned their lesson with the Sony memory stick saga.,-1,1
2265,1,11,They have taken another pretty good product a degraded it by making it inconvenient and/or expensive to use.Rick CulletonCEO DiscountElectronics.com,-1,1
2266,1,0,Horrible screen touch respond.,-1,1
2266,1,1,Different color than in picture.,-1,1
2266,1,2,In picture it shown light pink but when i got it, it is darker pink.,-1,1
2266,1,3,too slow to take picture and slow respond when i click on touchscreen.but,-1,1
2266,1,4,nice quaintly picture but again it doesn't adjust night mode.,-1,1
2267,1,0,Looks better than it is....,-1,1
2267,1,1,I love the looks and and compact feel of this camera, but the picture quality is very disapointing.,-1,1
2267,1,2,Sony usually has top shelf compact cameras, but this one was a big 'Oops'.,-1,1
2268,1,0,If you think you will drop it, don't buy it - I will not buy anything from Sony ever again.,-1,1
2268,1,1,Their quality has gone to garbage.,-1,1
2268,1,2,I've always loved Sony cameras and have bought 6 in my life and recommended them to people.,-1,0
2268,1,3,They always were durable and pictures were good quality.,-1,0
2268,1,4,Be aware their company is no longer what it was.This camera (DSC-T110) took good pictures and I liked it cause it's small.,-1,0
2268,1,5,After having for only 30 days I dropped it "1 time" from my pocket to the ground, about 4 feet.,-1,0
2268,1,6,The screen cracked.,-1,1
2268,1,7,Sony told me that is not covered under warranty for dropping it.,-1,1
2268,1,8,So the camera still worked at least the screen was just cracked.,-1,1
2268,1,9,Now about 30 days later it's making a grinding noise like fan is hitting something and the pictures are all blurry.,-1,1
2268,1,10,The motor for the focus must be messed up is my guess.,-1,1
2268,1,11,I've dropped my old Sony cameras (such as DSC-T7) many of times and they never broke or anything.I rarely leave bad reviews but this one really made me angry.,-1,1
2268,1,12,Sony basically stole $200 from me in 60 days.,-1,1
2268,1,13,In a sense I learned to never byu anything from Sony again.,-1,1
2268,1,14,Their TVs are a rip off when Samsung's are just as good for less the price.,-1,1
2268,1,15,Sony's Android tablet breaks easy from what I've read and the screen is not scratch proof.All Sony products are now cheaply made.,-1,1
2268,1,16,The only person I would say is ok with this camera is if you plan to mount it on a wall and never put it in your pocket or have any chance of banging or dropping it.I've heard Canon is a bit more helpful when these break.,-1,1
2268,1,17,I'll go with Canon from now on.Goodbye Sony,-1,1
2269,1,0,Ordered this camera based on reviews, price, night vision capability, and outdoor/weather-resisting capability.,-1,1
2269,1,1,We have other cameras that are higher quality, which we used to compare it to, on the same playback equipment.The good: these are some of the cheapest indoor/outdoor day/night cameras you'll find.,-1,1
2269,1,2,They are perfectly sized, and not asthetically displeasing.,-1,1
2269,1,3,When watching them live on a TV they provide a decently sharp picture, for more than 20 feet during the day.,-1,1
2269,1,4,At night it's range is still good, but slightly less than day.The bad: these are some of the cheapest indoor/outdoor day/night cameras you'll find.,-1,1
2269,1,5,Although when watching it live on TV, the picture is clear, when played back from our high quality DVR the picture was unacceptably pixellated and poor in general.,-1,1
2269,1,6,The tech pro in my household tells me it's something to do with the lines of resolution played on a TV vs stored by a DVR as recorded by the camera, though I could be paraphrasing that information EXTREMELY wrong!,-1,1
2269,1,7,Something about alternating lines of resolution?,-1,1
2269,1,8,If you're not going to need to record and review your camera's history and just observe someplace live, these would be fine.,-1,1
2269,1,9,You could make out basic shapes in playback, but I can't promise you'd be able to tell the difference between human and neanderthal, for example.Also, the color of things recorded by this camera during daylight is crazy.,-1,1
2269,1,10,Most things (watched live or in playback) look like they're in some weird Willy Wonka - Technicolor world of freakishness.,-1,1
2269,1,11,Green in this camera is automatically translated into a bright pale fuschia.,-1,1
2269,1,12,We tried to adjust this unsuccessfully, and we are typically not a technically-challenged household.,-1,1
2269,1,13,Based on the price, we would have kept it despite the color issue if the playback quality had not been so horrible.,-1,1
2269,1,14,I wanted to be able to recognize facial features, which was obviously not going to be possible.The,-1,1
2269,1,15,only other flaw is the slightly limited field of vision of this camera.,-1,1
2269,1,16,It was much narrower than I thought it would be, but not so narrow that it's unusable.,-1,1
2269,1,17,I'd estimate the field of vision is about 5 to 6 feet up close, 15 to 20 feet at its max further out.Oh wait, one more flaw ... as other reviewers have mentioned, there is a warning that comes with this camera saying it cannot be left in the rain or constantly exposed to the elements, even though it is labeled on the box etc as weather-resistant.,-1,1
2269,1,18,My guess is they are probably pretty weather resistant, but the lawyers made 'em put those warnings in the instructions.,-1,1
2269,1,19,That said, I wouldn't expect them to last a lifetime in constant rain or snow.,-1,1
2269,1,20,Though they do feel sturdily made.,-1,1
2270,1,0,This is a great camera for the price.,-1,0
2270,1,1,The night vision is really good, very clear images and can see a long way away and daylight is also very clear.,-1,0
2270,1,2,Update: It stopped working after about 8 months so not too happy with it now.,-1,0
2271,1,0,Excellent camera, terrible warranty.,-1,1
2271,1,1,I bought this camera 10 months ago from Amazon.,-1,1
2271,1,2,It was my 4th digital in seven years, and definitely my favorite one.,-1,0
2271,1,3,The size is just perfect to carry around, and the 6X optical zoom with image stabilization is hard to beat.,-1,0
2271,1,4,At the time, I struggled between this model and the Canon counterpart, but at the end, I was really happy with my decision.,-1,0
2271,1,5,I actually stopped using my video camera, storing movies in my 4 2GB SD cards.One week ago, the flash stopped working.,-1,0
2271,1,6,I thought to myself "no problem, the one year warranty will cover it".,-1,1
2271,1,7,Well, guess what, the warranty only covers parts, and the labor flat-fee from Panasonic is $170.00,-1,1
2271,1,8,I can buy a new one on Amazon for $20.00 USD more!,-1,1
2271,1,9,I wrote to Panasonic, but didn't get a satisfactory response from them.I am switching now to the Canon Powershot A570 IS, which supports image stabilization, and 7 Megapixel pictures.,-1,1
2271,1,10,Their warranty covers EVERYTHING for one whole year, so at least I feel safer buying their product.,-1,1
2271,1,11,The price is a little bit higher than this model, but totally worth it.Something to keep in mind if you are considering to buy this model.,-1,1
2272,1,0,Nice Pics but Camera itself will not last long but cheaper than disposables.,-1,0
2272,1,1,I bought this camera for a trip to the coral reefs of the FLorida Keys.,-1,0
2272,1,2,I shot many pics and videos and have to say that most of them came out very well.,-1,0
2272,1,3,I really do like the digital video feature.,-1,0
2272,1,4,I zoomed in and out while underwater and have a couple of videos that are up to 2 minutes in length.,-1,0
2272,1,5,Two other people on our trip also had the same XP50 and one had an XP30.,-1,1
2272,1,6,By the end of the trip all of our cameras began to show condensation under the back monitor screen; the XP30 was in the poorest shape - it also had condensation around the lens.,-1,1
2272,1,7,My thought is that its door locking system isn't quite as tight as the XP50.,-1,1
2272,1,8,I would also be willing to believe you cannot go even near the 16' limit recommended by the makers.,-1,0
2272,1,9,WHen snorkelling, it is a little tough to make out good detail on the monitor.,-1,0
2272,1,10,After each trip, I washed it with soap and water to get the salt and sunscreen off of it and it shined and looked like new each time.,-1,0
2272,1,11,Another friend used an Olympus and he reported no problems above or below the water.,-1,0
2272,1,12,His Olympus was in the $300 range.,-1,0
2272,1,13,Also, with the price of the XP50 and the amount of pics and vids I took, with a discount, its not bad but you know it will not last very long.,-1,0
2272,1,14,Now I have digitals that I can manipulate any way I choose, rather than hard copies and negatives.,-1,0
2272,1,15,Think about it, using 6 disposables along with their developing you have already wrapped up $120-130.,-1,0
2272,1,16,All-in-all, buying this camera is a 50/50 shot that it will work more than a week or two under heavy useage.,-1,0
2272,1,17,I liked the pics and vids but do not trust its longevity.,-1,0
2273,1,0,Its an ok camera, not great.,-1,0
2273,1,1,Image quality is so-so, but you get the weather/water proof feature.I needed that feature - lots of outdoor use in wet conditions, so am satisfied with the images.Images tend to be soft due to the over use of noise reduction.,-1,0
2273,1,2,Fine detail is lacking, and the images take on a fairly "painted" look when examined at higher magnification.All the small cameras, similar to this one... do that.,-1,0
2273,1,3,You just have to choose features or image.,-1,0
2273,1,4,I chose features, and no complaints except for image quality.,-1,0
2274,1,0,So disappointed!,-1,0
2274,1,1,I treated myself to this camera just before Christmas 2012, the picture quality was good, there was many different modes to choose from and I found it easy enough to use.,-1,0
2274,1,2,I first took it in the sea with me in May time, it worked fine but I did notice the zoom buttons became quite stiff or sticky.,-1,1
2274,1,3,It came in the sea again with me in July and in the swimming pool, again it worked fine and had no problems.,-1,1
2274,1,4,Sadly on its last trip in the sea in September in Greece it died on me!!,-1,1
2274,1,5,I noticed the lens looked like it had condensation on it, when I tried to turn it on, the light kept flashing green, orange, red and eventually it just stopped doing anything altogether.,-1,1
2274,1,6,When I opened it up the battery was soaked, I was so disappointed!,-1,1
2274,1,7,I won't be asking for a swap, I want a refund :(,-1,1
2275,1,0,I thought this was going to be a fun little camera to have; living in the Pacific Northwest, a waterproof camera is a great thing to have - it rains a lot here!,-1,0
2275,1,1,:-)  But the complicated menus made me give up on this camera after just a few days - I am not one easily intimidated by electronics, but this one I found little patience for.I loved the green look (NOT because I am into the politically correct "green" movement - it was just a pleasant color) and the heavy feel of the camera; it felt sturdy and it took pretty pictures and recorded clear videos.,-1,1
2275,1,2,But having to go through several steps to change even the simplest setting was something I decided I did not want to do.,-1,1
2275,1,3,I missed having more outside knobs and dials to use, which, of course, a waterproof camera wants to have fewer of; I thus decided I did not need a waterproof camera.I also thought the lens was in a rather awkward place in the top left corner.,-1,1
2275,1,4,I found myself having to move my left hand down, and thus found the camera somewhat uncomfortable to use.The editing software installed on the camera seemed good.,-1,1
2275,1,5,The flash, however, used in my medium sized living room in the evening, was too bright.,-1,1
2275,1,6,Taking pictures in that same room without a flash worked great, though, so no real need for the flash when the room was well lit by my lamps.Something else that bothered me was the lack of catching movement and "freezing" it - my two older cameras can do that without any problems - this one could not.,-1,1
2275,1,7,Perhaps there was a setting I did not find that could have corrected this?,-1,1
2275,1,8,I tried to find out, but could not in the time I familiarized myself with this camera.However, for somebody who wants a waterproof camera, it will be a great pick; the pictures and video's were great, but I returned it anyway.,-1,1
2275,1,9,Based on the short time I had it, I would, however, recommend it for somebody looking for a waterproof and somewhat funky looking camera.,-1,1
2275,1,10,It just wasn't for me.,-1,1
2276,1,0,Cheap and Weatherproof, but average or below in every other way.,-1,1
2276,1,1,I've been using this camera, mainly in video mode, to record various outdoor sporting events.Pros:- It's small, light, and easily fits into any pocket.-,-1,1
2276,1,2,Bright colors to keep it from getting lost- Starts up fast to catch quick shots- Simple menu structure to keep things easy.Cons:- Lens is very soft.,-1,1
2276,1,3,It may be high megapixels, but a lot of those are left useless from the soft pictures it takes.,-1,1
2276,1,4,Some mild sharpening in software does help tremendously.-,-1,1
2276,1,5,Audio/Video sync issues.,-1,1
2276,1,6,The audio is offset from the video by approx.,-1,1
2276,1,7,For most things this isn't too bad, but in certain situations this is bad.-,-1,1
2276,1,8,Uses an odd codec for audio preventing it from being edited directly in Adobe Premiere.,-1,1
2276,1,9,Must extract the audio via Quicktime Pro prior to editing- Focus isn't fast enough to keep up with zoom in video (focus is lost during zoom).-,-1,1
2276,1,10,Not lens dust cover means, well, dust on the lens.-,-1,1
2276,1,11,Infrequently, the audio will be "buzzy".,-1,1
2276,1,12,A power cycle will correct this.-,-1,1
2276,1,13,White balance is all over the place when panning.,-1,1
2276,1,14,The image can go from a slight red hue to green depending on lighting.-,-1,1
2276,1,15,Image stabilization is turned OFF when in video mode.-,-1,1
2276,1,16,Suffers from CMOS rolling shutterWhile overall the camera still fits my original goal of something cheap that I wouldn't be too heartbroken about damaging, weatherproof, and 1080p 30fps video, I wonder if my money could have been better spent on a nicer camera and save me time later trying to correct image problems.,-1,1
2277,1,0,Nice camera when/if it works.,-1,0
2277,1,1,I purchased this camera at a BIG BOX store, thinking the shock-resistance would be nice since the last camera I had broke when dropped.,-1,0
2277,1,2,I bought the black version.The two-stage open/close compartment is very weird, and sometimes would cause the camera to not function very well, or not turn on.,-1,0
2277,1,3,The camera worked great on my trip to Paris with my girlfriend.,-1,0
2277,1,4,Hi-resolution is nice.,-1,0
2277,1,5,Once or twice it didn't seem to turn on right away, or we had to adjust something for it to turn on.,-1,0
2277,1,6,Also, the HD video is very nice, but the downside is it drains the battery very rapidly.I needed the camera to take pictures of students in my marketing course today, charged the battery fully, inserted it into the camera, and the machine would not power on.,-1,0
2277,1,7,ANY IDEAS on WHY?14 megapixels is great WHEN the camera works.,-1,0
2277,1,8,I feel like the engineers have failed miserably at the power-consumption issues.I have NOT tried taking photos underwater.,-1,0
2278,1,0,I bought it last night before reading any of the reviews.,-1,1
2278,1,1,Brought it home read manual and was disgustingly laughing so much I wanted to take it back before taking any pictures.,-1,1
2278,1,2,The camera is suppose to be water,shock,freeze,dust proof, but there are so many disclaimers there really isn't any guarantee the thing will even take pictures.,-1,1
2278,1,3,The humor continues while you read a page of warnings about how the thing will shock you or cause fire if you look at it wrong.Ok enough ranting about the Manual.I decided to give it a try.,-1,1
2278,1,4,So today I took some pictures.,-1,1
2278,1,5,Sorry guys, my ancient day Canon powershot A560 is better.,-1,1
2278,1,6,I would still be using it but the lame design of the latch and the fact the the rubberbands no longer work, I find I need sometime new.Of course the Canon picture quality is much better than this Fuji.Low light is really bad on this Fuji.,-1,1
2278,1,7,I know it's an issue with most cameras, from the reviews I've read, but I thought it would be decent.The Fuji took a lot longer to focus.The sound wasn't as good or strong.The video had that soft focus blur thing that I think is a preference choice.,-1,0
2278,1,8,I don't like it.That's about it.,-1,1
2278,1,9,I didn't even bother with the water, what was the point, especially with all the disclaimers.,-1,1
2278,1,10,(It's a water proof camera that the manual says not to set on wet surface)?,-1,1
2279,1,0,Took great pictures until it met water...,-1,0
2279,1,1,I have an older Fuji XP that I have had for a few years.,-1,0
2279,1,2,It worked great and I had taken it snorkeling a couple of times.,-1,0
2279,1,3,I upgraded to the XP50 for the HD video and higher quality photos on the recommendation of a photographer friend of mine who said for the quality of the pictures at this price point it could not be beat.I took the new XP50 on my recent cruise to the Bahamas.,-1,0
2279,1,4,It was working great, taking great photos and video until I took it snorkeling off Nassau.,-1,0
2279,1,5,As soon as it hit water the rear screen leaked and the camera failed.,-1,0
2279,1,6,Fortunately the battery and SD card compartment did not leak and my photos, etc. were not lost.,-1,1
2279,1,7,I am sure this was just a defect in this camera as my other Fuji still works fine, but Fuji definitely needs to up their quality control if they are going to be marketing these cameras as waterproof and shockproof!,-1,1
2280,1,0,AF issues and poor image quality are dealbreakers...,-1,1
2280,1,1,I knew this wasn't going to be a superstar camera when I bought it however I've got an old Canon A720IS that produces MUCH better pictures than this camera does.Pros:  Cheap, water resistant, depending on where you buy it from it sometimes comes bundled with a buoyant strap,cheap, takes videoCons:  Autofocus is very unreliable.,-1,1
2280,1,2,Most shots are quite back-focused, Poor resolution (I'd says it's probably equivalent to a 4megapixel camera.,-1,1
2280,1,3,The image files are large but resolution is poor due to oppressive noise reduction that obliterates most of the detail (EVEN AT ISO100).With my six year old powershot, I did see this IF I was using ISO800 but when I shot at ISO100 my files looked pretty clean.Videos even appear quite noisy (even after the resolution is reduced by ~7x).,-1,1
2281,1,0,only buy it if there is a good refund policy.,-1,0
2281,1,1,We bought our camera at costco in hawaii.,-1,0
2281,1,2,It worked great for a week.... we snorkeled 5x and used it everytime.,-1,0
2281,1,3,Even lost it in the ocean and found it 10 minutes later!,-1,0
2281,1,4,It worked great for the entire week but now, at home, the video function doesnt work.,-1,0
2281,1,5,Good thing we bought it at costco.,-1,0
2281,1,6,I will be returning it and will wait to buy another underwater camera when we go on vacation.The pics and video we took on vacation turned out great.,-1,0
2281,1,7,I liked having it as a back up camera to take to the beach rather than risk getting sand or water in my nice camera.,-1,0
2282,1,0,iPhone takes better pictures - Will be returning camera.,-1,1
2282,1,1,I got this camera at a big box store for $150.,-1,1
2282,1,2,Didn't think it could bee to bad.,-1,1
2282,1,3,Last digital camera I got was in 2005 and that camera out does this one.,-1,1
2282,1,4,This camera is pretty crappy.Pros: Usable under water, Shock proof, and takes decent videosCons: Sucks at taking pictures - Pictures are VERY grainy.,-1,1
2283,1,0,Won't work well every time.,-1,1
2283,1,1,After several Fuji cameras, and being very pleased with them.,-1,1
2283,1,2,I bought it for water use - not underwater - just around water.Some of the pix are clear, some are too blurry to see what the subject is, some are 'washed out' colors.,-1,1
2283,1,3,I gave it 2 (TWO) STARS because the shot/recovery time was in an ok range.,-1,1
2283,1,4,The battery gave me no problems but I have a spare just in case.,-1,1
2283,1,5,With the loss of some shots due to part-time working lenses, I have lost good photos of scenes and friends, like all of you have when it fails.,-1,0
2283,1,6,I would not recommend this camera and very sorry I bought it.,-1,0
2284,1,0,It breaks easily!,-1,1
2284,1,1,I actually liked the camera for the few months it worked.,-1,1
2284,1,2,Then, one day, it slipped and I caught it half a second later, so it didn't fall down, just got a shake.,-1,1
2284,1,3,It stopped working immediately: the lenses got stuck out, and the screen kept saying "Lens Error.",-1,1
2284,1,4,I googled the problem, and it turned out many, many people had the exact same problem with this model.,-1,1
2284,1,5,Why didn't I look this up before buying it?,-1,1
2284,1,6,The suggested remedy was to give the lens a light tap, and, if it didn't work, a stronger one.,-1,1
2284,1,7,Twenty taps later, it started working again for a few minutes, then got stuck again.,-1,1
2284,1,8,I am outside the US now, and I don't even want to think what it would take to have it returned/fixed/etc.Don't buy it.,-1,1
2285,1,0,Very compact and feature-rich, but picture quality is terrible !,-1,1
2285,1,1,PROS: lots of features, compact size, feel, controls, most notable feature is the "time laps".CONS: unbelievably poor picture quality.,-1,1
2285,1,2,I was stunned that Nikon was willing to put its name on such crap !!!,-1,1
2285,1,3,I know it's low budget camera, but come on !I took about 200 shots in both outdoors and indoors.,-1,1
2285,1,4,The photos all lack sharpness in all settings.,-1,1
2285,1,5,This camera is suitable if you want something small to fit in the pocket, but don't expect sharp pix !,-1,1
2286,1,0,Overpriced inferior product.,-1,1
2286,1,1,I've had this camera for a year and a half, after taking a recommendation from the guy at Target.,-1,1
2286,1,2,It's my first digital camera, but my last NIKON.,-1,1
2286,1,3,A company with such a good reputation should not be selling this camera.,-1,1
2286,1,4,It's satisfactory for first time users, but as you get usded to the digital thing, the problems stand out - mainly picture quality.,-1,1
2286,1,5,I've had three events so far where every shot was blurred, and I stay as still as possible.,-1,1
2286,1,6,Feature wise it's good, but with crappy picture quality, all those features are useless.,-1,1
2286,1,7,Close up shots and outdoor shots (with no motion) are fine, but indoor shots are grainy and blurry, and it never focuses when you use the zoom.,-1,1
2286,1,8,I think the price tage is too high for such poor quality.,-1,1
2286,1,9,I bought a Kodak Easyshare for my mom at half this price, and it takes phenomenal pictures, even with motion, they are crisp and clear.,-1,1
2286,1,10,Nikon should offer a trade in or something for people who wasted money on this and lost memories of events because of no decent photos to keep!!!,-1,1
2287,1,0,nikon coolpix S220.,-1,1
2287,1,1,Very delicate equipment went bad 3 times for me .I will never buy this produc again,-1,1
2288,1,0,Consider this an "outdoor-only" camera.,-1,1
2288,1,1,This camera has a very hard time focusing in normal indoor lighting conditions.,-1,1
2288,1,2,I took many pictures with it over the holidays, and at least every other one is out of focus or grainy.,-1,1
2288,1,3,Even when it does manage to focus the image, it takes several tries.It takes pictures fine outdoors, or in very bright light.,-1,1
2288,1,4,But overall, it has only two advantages over my crappy iPhone camera - better resolution (mostly negated by how grainy most indoor photos are) and the 3x zoom, which is pretty much a standard feature on any $100+ camera these days, anyway.I would have returned mine, but I dropped it on a sidewalk soon after buying it (it took bad pictures before and after that incident).,-1,1
2288,1,5,That's one good thing about it though - the metal shell is pretty tough.,-1,1
2289,1,0,Pretty camera, crappy pictures.,-1,1
2289,1,1,I returned this after taking a few test shots and comparing them to the ones from my ancient Canon.,-1,1
2289,1,2,The pictures from this Nikon were soft and blurry and just not good, even with file sizes four times the ones from the Canon of the same subject.,-1,1
2290,1,0,Not worth it.,-1,1
2290,1,1,i received this camera this morning and i already hate it.,-1,1
2290,1,2,The shots all suck.,-1,1
2290,1,3,taking shots inside with a flash still gives me blurry pictures.,-1,1
2290,1,4,The shots out side are ok at most.,-1,1
2290,1,5,I only went with Nikon because my husbands use to be Nikon loyal but this was my first Nikon...,-1,1
2290,1,6,I will be returning this and buying a canon or Sony.,-1,1
2290,1,7,Save you money and buy something a little better.,-1,1
2290,1,8,In the past few years Ive had  Canon a Panasonic and a Sony and i will buy one of those  and will probably never buy Nikon again.,-1,1
2291,1,0,Horrible pictures!,-1,1
2291,1,1,I bought this camera a few years ago and I've regretted it ever since.,-1,1
2291,1,2,I had a chunky kodak digital camera before this one, which used AAA batteries and broke, so I bought this camera to replace it.,-1,1
2291,1,3,I liked the Nikon s220 because of all the great-sounding features it had, the slim style, and the color pink, my favorite color.,-1,1
2291,1,4,BIG MISTAKE!,-1,1
2291,1,5,This camera takes terrible pictures!,-1,1
2291,1,6,Eventhough it has about 10 different picture settings, EVERY picture no matter what setting or where you are: outside, inside, light, darkness, flash, no flash, close up, far away, zoom in, zoom out, EVERY PICTURE LOOKS BLURRY AND HORRIBLE!,-1,1
2291,1,7,When i was doing the research about which camera to get at the time, a friend told me that i should get a cannon and i went against her for vanity reasons, and now here i am 3 years and hundreds of horrible pictures later, looking at nothing but cannon cameras!,-1,1
2291,1,8,The only good thing about this camera is of course the color and the slim size.,-1,0
2291,1,9,It fits in my clutch purses when i go out.,-1,0
2291,1,10,still not worth it...,-1,0
2292,1,0,Coolpix S220 Failed Twice In One Year.,-1,1
2292,1,1,Takes good pictures and easy to use, BUT, I returned it to Nikon last November with the lense error.,-1,1
2292,1,2,They repaired it under warranty.,-1,1
2292,1,3,This May it had a black spot on the viewfinder with what looks like something live crawling around in there.,-1,1
2292,1,4,Returned to Nikon and diagnosed as "LCD Screen cracked/bleeding".,-1,1
2292,1,5,Estimate to repair is $106.,-1,1
2292,1,6,The original cost was around $130.,-1,1
2292,1,7,Will replace with a new one, Not a Nikon.,-1,1
2293,1,0,Doesn't last.,-1,1
2293,1,1,I have only owned this camera for about two years, and over the last 8 months, it has been slowly deteriorating.,-1,1
2293,1,2,The pictures are no longer clear, despite my trying every setting and every lighting condition I can think of.,-1,1
2293,1,3,At first, I began to notice that under a few settings (Sport, Museum, Party/Indoor, Dusk/Dawn) the pictures would turn out blurry, and maybe 20% of my pictures overall wouldn't turn out clearly.,-1,1
2293,1,4,Now, only one setting produces clear pictures and more than 80% of my pictures overall still turn out blurred, even when I set the camera down on a hard surface.,-1,1
2293,1,5,I wasn't expecting this camera to last forever, but I don't feel I got my money's worth.,-1,1
2293,1,6,I wouldn't recommend it unless you are only looking for a camera to work for a short period of time, or perhaps for a specific vacation/trip.,-1,1
2294,1,0,A halfway decent camera....while it lasted.,-1,1
2294,1,1,Despite the negative title, this really isn't that bad of a camera, it's just that one can buy much better than this.,-1,1
2294,1,2,The color rendition is beyond strange, it has really poor response to variations in lighting (even by compact standards) and the auto focus can be unreliable.,-1,1
2294,1,3,Excellent pictures can be coaxed out of this by careful post processing and careful shooting, but let's face it; most people aren't going to want to have to edit their photos, as it defeats to purpose of a "point and shoot".,-1,1
2294,1,4,Other than that, it wasn't very durable, and the lens stopped opening correctly after a little over a year.,-1,0
2294,1,5,I first though I'd gotten sand in the lens opening mechanism while hiking through the Grand Canyon, but upon taking apart the camera, I found no sand within the lens element.,-1,0
2294,1,6,So simply some sort of manufacturing defect I'm assuming.,-1,1
2294,1,7,Overall, seeing as others have had this problem as well, I'd advise spending a bit more and getting something else.P.S. here's an example of what the camera is capable of, when carefully composed and edited.,-1,1
2295,1,0,Coolpix not the best Camera for the price!,-1,0
2295,1,1,My husband did a lot of research on cameras before he purchased this one for me for my recent birthday.,-1,0
2295,1,2,On a daily basis he uses a Kodak Easyshare at his work but all the reviews said that this Nikon Coolpix would be a better choice for us to have at home.,-1,1
2295,1,3,When we received the camera we were very pleased with the size (it's super small) and the clean look of it (not too many buttons).But as soon as we took a picture with it we knew that we weren't going to be happy.,-1,1
2295,1,4,The pictures were grainy, the color was distorted and the quality was just not as good as the Kodak Easyshare.,-1,1
2295,1,5,We actually took the same pictures with each camera side by side and the Kodak pictures were much better!We tried adjusting all of the settings, lighting, flash, aspect ratio, etc., and nothing worked.Also, the Nikon has a lot less buttons than the Kodak, but I soon realized that those extra buttons save me a lot of searching through menus to find a setting.Since the cameras were virtually the same price, we sent the Nikon Coolpix back and are now ordering the Kodak Easyshare.,-1,1
2296,1,0,Horrible Indoor Photos.,-1,1
2296,1,1,I have had many digital cameras in the past 10 years and I have to say this is the worst camera I've ever had.,-1,1
2296,1,2,It takes awful indoor photos.,-1,1
2296,1,3,The flash is not strong enough and every single indoor photo is blurry and/or yellow in color.,-1,1
2296,1,4,I've called Nikon and made sure all my setting were the factory defaults and I've tried using all the different flash options but nothing really seems to help.,-1,1
2296,1,5,VERY disappointed in this camera.,-1,1
2297,1,0,Not good.,-1,1
2297,1,1,I was simply looking for a "put it in my purse" camera when I bought this.,-1,1
2297,1,2,I own an SLR, and I certainly didn't expect this camera to come across with that type of quality.,-1,1
2297,1,3,I did expect Nikon to come up with something better than this though!,-1,1
2297,1,4,I adjusted ISO, adjusted megapix's, played around with it.,-1,0
2297,1,5,I am willing to bet that it takes some decent full light pictures.,-1,0
2297,1,6,I was shooting in the evening, just basic kids playing around the house types of shots.,-1,0
2297,1,7,The viewfinder first will show you a very yellow/orange picture and then when you shoot it, well, it's a crapshoot what you're going to get!,-1,0
2297,1,8,The pictures were more often than not very fuzzy.The size and weight were just what I was looking for.,-1,0
2297,1,9,Deck of cards.,-1,1
2297,1,10,I bought the plum color and that was really cute.IMO, not Nikon quality at all.,-1,1
2297,1,11,I returned it and got a Kodak.,-1,1
2297,1,12,Superior pictures...surprised me.,-1,1
2298,1,0,No Mass Storage Support = No-Go.,-1,0
2298,1,1,This camera is easy to use and is a small and compact shooter.,-1,0
2298,1,2,Pictures however were marginal.,-1,0
2298,1,3,There seemed to be a fishey effect on images, where they are clear at the center, but blurred on the edges.,-1,0
2298,1,4,Also it did poorly with colors unless the lighting was bright.,-1,0
2298,1,5,A major drawback for me is the lack of support for mass storage class drivers (eg plug into computer and see it as a storage device/ hard drive).,-1,1
2298,1,6,Nikon should provide this functionality in the camera.,-1,1
2298,1,7,I do not want to have to use special apps & drivers to get to my photos (Win2k/XP), nor do I want to use a card reader.,-1,1
2298,1,8,On Vista the camera connected and worked pretty well.,-1,1
2299,1,0,Not so Cool CoolPix.,-1,0
2299,1,1,I am very familiar with cameras and I was disappointed with this Nikon picture quality for a 10.0.,-1,0
2299,1,2,Pics look fine in their orginal format but when I used editing software the grains came out.I talked with another experienced shooter of the Nikon and he had the same problem and returned the camera.It has nice features, small and easy to use but none of that matters if the end result...the picture is no good.Research and buy another camera, not the Nikon S220,-1,0
2300,1,0,The few pictures taken were great however, the internal screen cracked and now the camera will not work.,-1,1
2300,1,1,It's only 2 weeks out of the box.,-1,1
2300,1,2,UPS picked it up today for repair so we will see how well Nikon backs their products.Nikon responded by charging me over $100 to fix the camera.,-1,1
2300,1,3,This is most likely the last Nikon camera I will every buy.,-1,1
2301,1,0,Great Disappointment!!,-1,1
2301,1,1,The camera screen cracked within 1 day of use!!!!  How do I go about returning it for replacement???Thank you.,-1,1
2302,1,0,Don't purchase.,-1,1
2302,1,1,I have had this camera for 3 months and it has already started to give problems.,-1,1
2302,1,2,Not a good buy!,-1,1
2303,1,0,This camera is terrible.,-1,1
2303,1,1,Grainy images, abnormally bright colors make many pictures appear as if out of a cartoon coloring book.,-1,1
2303,1,2,Picture quality is just low all-around, with some of the poorest sharpness I've ever seen even with close-ups.,-1,1
2303,1,3,Occasionally, there are fantastic shots; I've noticed outdoor, sunny shots look the best.,-1,0
2303,1,4,Shots in the shade and indoors are poor.,-1,0
2303,1,5,All of this even at auto flash settings.I bought this camera for my honeymoon and I regret it.,-1,1
2303,1,6,I'm returning it tomorrow.,-1,1
2304,1,0,did not meet my expectation.,-1,1
2304,1,1,I wanted a small camera which can be kept in my bag all the time.,-1,1
2304,1,2,So I ordered this one, the size is perfect, the camera looks very cute.,-1,1
2304,1,3,However, it takes really bad pictures, never clear when it is dark outside or inside with normal light.,-1,1
2304,1,4,I tried several setting and no improvement at all.,-1,1
2304,1,5,The only condition that the pictures are acceptable is outside with STRONG sunshine and the object you shoot is VERY close to you.,-1,1
2304,1,6,So I decided to return it.I am not a picky customer at all.,-1,1
2304,1,7,I have ordered hundreds of items from Amazon in the past several years, this is the 1st time I return an item.I guess I was unlucky this time to just receive a defective camera.,-1,1
2304,1,8,If Nikon made all cameras like this, it would be out of business soon.Thanks to Amazon.com, the return of the camera was very simple with free-shipping.,-1,1
2304,1,9,I have received my full refund, which was quite fast.,-1,1
2304,1,10,I have no complain at all in returning the item.I ordered another camera from Amazon, which is $70 more than this one, the new camera works perfectly.,-1,1
2304,1,11,I am happy now.,-1,1
2305,1,0,Color on Display is AWFUL!,-1,1
2305,1,1,I am sorely disappointed with my new Coolpix.,-1,1
2305,1,2,I have a very old one with which I was quite happy, but I wanted to upgrade to a much smaller, higher MP camera.,-1,1
2305,1,3,This camera seemed like a great deal for a 10MP slim camera with VR.,-1,1
2305,1,4,The problem is that white walls & Caucasian people look yellow or orange with this camera.,-1,1
2305,1,5,I haven't yet printed any photos or looked at any on the computer, but on the camera, most photos look awful.,-1,1
2305,1,6,I will update y'all once I have printed a few of the photos & see if it is simply a bad camera LCD, or if the photos are really that awful.,-1,1
2305,1,7,If it is simply the camera LCD, well, I can live with that.,-1,1
2305,1,8,If the photos are as awful as they look on the camera LCD, then I will be returning the camera to Amazon ASAP.,-1,1
2306,1,0,I was looking for a compact point and shoot in the $200 range that took sharp pictures with good image stabilization.,-1,1
2306,1,1,My old Canon Powershot SD750 (which I was very happy with) died recently and I needed a replacement.,-1,1
2306,1,2,I tried 5 different cameras, and the picture quality on all of them was alful:1.,-1,1
2306,1,3,Panasonic DMC-FH25A2.,-1,1
2306,1,4,Nikon Coolpix S62003.,-1,1
2306,1,5,Canon PowerShot SX230HS4.,-1,1
2306,1,6,Canon PowerShot SD980IS5.,-1,1
2306,1,7,Canon PowerShot Elph 100 HSThey all got returned.,-1,1
2306,1,8,I finally found the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX7V and I am THRILLED with it.,-1,1
2306,1,9,I never would have thought that a Sony camera would outperform comperable models from Nikon and Canon (WHAT has happened to Canon in the last few years?), but the difference is absolutely night and day.Conclusion: pass on this one and look at the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX7V.,-1,1
2306,1,10,You won't be disappointed.,-1,1
2307,1,0,Already not working.,-1,1
2307,1,1,I've been using Nikon cameras since my first camera as a kid.,-1,1
2307,1,2,I loved this camera until it decided to just not turn on a few months after I got it.,-1,1
2307,1,3,I've never dropped it or gotten it wet or any other ill treatment because I'm extremely careful when it comes to every one of my electronic devices.,-1,1
2307,1,4,I don't know what happened.,-1,1
2308,1,0,Problems Focusing.,-1,1
2308,1,1,Great overall easy to use camera, but it seems to have a focusing problem.,-1,1
2308,1,2,When taking pictures in low light WITH THE FLASH ON half the pictures come out completely our of focus (not blurry from low light, but completely out of focus) and I have to take the picture again.,-1,1
2308,1,3,Usually on the second try it comes out perfect, but its a pain.,-1,1
2308,1,4,I returned the camera because of this and got another one, but it still happens with the replacement camera.,-1,1
2308,1,5,In daylight, pictures come out beautifully.,-1,1
2309,1,0,you get what you pay for... Disappointing--pictures are not sharp, and the delay before and between pictures makes capturing that special shot an exercise in frustration.,-1,0
2309,1,1,It's pretty.,-1,0
2309,1,2,But functionally very disappointing.,-1,1
2310,1,0,Not as good as other Nikons I have purchased.,-1,1
2310,1,1,This would have been our third point 'n shoot digital Nikon, but I am returning it to Amazon.,-1,1
2310,1,2,I have been a Nikon owner since 1978, so if anything I have a great deal of pro-Nikon bias.,-1,1
2310,1,3,But right out of the box it produced very poor images.,-1,0
2310,1,4,Overexposed flash images were the rule, so I adjusted the exposure to minus .7 or more and then there was a lot of noise in the image.,-1,0
2310,1,5,One would think that the Auto setting for quick P&S; would produce reasonably good images, but that was not the case.,-1,0
2310,1,6,We never could get good indoor images from it.,-1,0
2310,1,7,It's a shame, as we love the Nikon D3100 DSLR we have at work and hoped a new Nikon P&S; would produce good images for family documentation.,-1,0
2311,1,0,Feels cheated...was a open box item and used signed was there.,-1,1
2311,1,1,Started battery was full charged and factory setting was modified.,-1,1
2312,1,0,Review.,-1,1
2312,1,1,This camera is an average camera.,-1,1
2312,1,2,Good for convenience and average snapshots, definitely not your best buck for quality.,-1,1
2312,1,3,The night mode is horrible.,-1,1
2312,1,4,I recommend a better camera even if you're just going for an average quality photo.,-1,1
2313,1,0,Image quality is horrible, what can we expect form this level of product ?,-1,1
2313,1,1,I bought it for my mother.,-1,1
2313,1,2,This is for people that do not care about image quality, since 5 mp or 16megapixels or even more in a camera like this means nothig, as the proof is the bad image quality.,-1,1
2313,1,3,This is perfect for people that do not know how to take picture and dont care about bad quality.,-1,1
2313,1,4,The images shown on the propaganda on amazon ad of this product seens the where shot with a better camera with a better sensor.,-1,1
2313,1,5,Don't be fool, never buy a camera because of what the seller shows you as 'actual image quality', to give and example of what the camera can do, research if you want for a better low quality camera, or pay extra for a mid-range non professional.,-1,1
2314,1,0,You can get a better one.,-1,1
2314,1,1,First of all I bought this camera after returning an Olympus VR350 (which had good quality, but didnt seem good enough at the moment).So, I decided to go buy this Nikon.,-1,1
2314,1,2,("it's a nikon, what can be wrong?",-1,1
2314,1,3,i thought)well, if you taking pictures of big things like buildings the quality is pretty good.but,-1,1
2314,1,4,if you're taking portraits the people look just way too RED.,-1,1
2314,1,5,also, in distances under 20 ft the auto focus didnt work very well.,-1,1
2314,1,6,=/and -if there's a little movement- the pictures look blurry.when,-1,1
2314,1,7,recording the images (in qualities over 4MB)it took at least a couple of seconds to be ready to shot another frame.Well, I got rid of this Nikon and buying (again)the Olympus VR350.,-1,1
2315,1,0,Nikon Coolpix S6200 fuzzy pictures.,-1,1
2315,1,1,I have had this camera for about 4 months.,-1,1
2315,1,2,I take a LOT of pictures with any one of my 4 cameras.,-1,1
2315,1,3,I am not new to photography.,-1,1
2315,1,4,I've owned about 10 different cameras over the last 20 or so years.Maybe it's just me, however, I have never been able to take a picture with the Nikon S6200 that came out even borderline good.,-1,1
2315,1,5,All appear to be fuzzy and/or out of focus.I switched to 5 mp and found that it was better than with 16mp however, it still isn't as good as my old Fuji finepix 2650, 2mp camera.I did notice that it seems to take relatively good video.,-1,1
2315,1,6,I don't normally do video's with my still cameras but decided to try, just to see if there was an improvement in the quality.,-1,1
2315,1,7,Maybe the moving picture hides the fuzzyness.It's a small handy camera and I do intend to continue trying to get better quality photos from it.,-1,1
2316,1,0,very disappointed.,-1,1
2316,1,1,I've been a long time (happy) customer of Canon point and shoot cameras.,-1,1
2316,1,2,My last one, SD800IS Elph, finally quit working after years of reliable results - and I take a lot of pictures.,-1,1
2316,1,3,I also have a Canon SLR, but my pocket camera covers FAR more ground when I'm on the go.,-1,1
2316,1,4,The SLR is great for creative photo shots when I plan ahead for special events, but nothing beats a good reliable point and shoot pocket camera to have with you when lugging an SLR isn't practical and you still want to capture the moment.,-1,1
2316,1,5,So, when my 800IS camera went out, I naturally looked for a Canon replacement.,-1,1
2316,1,6,Long story short, all indications are that Canon has really let the quality of their Elph series slip significantly in recent years since my last purchase.,-1,1
2316,1,7,So, I opened my search up to Nikon pocket cameras.,-1,1
2316,1,8,While all cameras have their detractors, you have to look at the overall context of the various reviews.,-1,1
2316,1,9,After reading a lot of reviews, I eventually talked to a guy at a camera shop (that carries both Nikon and Canon cameras) and he recommended this model.,-1,1
2316,1,10,So, when I saw it on sale at Amazon a couple months back, I jumped on it.This camera is almost identical in size as my former Canon SD800IS.,-1,1
2316,1,11,The optical zoom on the Nikon is very good (much better than the my Canon), and I like to use a lot of optical zoom (avoiding digital zoom).,-1,0
2316,1,12,The photo quality also seems to be good.,-1,0
2316,1,13,Also, the features of the Nikon are also fairly easy to use (however, the manufacturers are now focusing on adding too many features 98% of point and shoot owners will never use, rather than keeping focus on improved image quality).The one thing I can't get past with this Nikon is the location of the Video Record button.,-1,1
2316,1,14,Nikon placed it right where you naturally grab the camera with your right-hand thumb.,-1,1
2316,1,15,You can't avoid but push the button with your thumb when you pick up the camera to take a shot - there is no other place to put your thumb to grasp the camera!,-1,1
2316,1,16,I remembered seeing another reviewer complain about this, but thought it couldn't be a show-stopper since not everyone was complaining.,-1,1
2316,1,17,Even with the raised edges next to the button, I haven't been able to avoid pressing it, whereby missing my shot as I figure out what I did and to turn off recording before I can shoot.I have no idea why Nikon would place the video record button in that location!,-1,1
2316,1,18,I want a snapshot camera, not a video camera!,-1,1
2316,1,19,Shooting video from a pocket camera is a very small percentage of what I want a snapshot camera for.,-1,1
2316,1,20,I just want a great photo (in both bright and dim light), with basic features to help me get that shot (not the kitchen sink), which are accessible and easy to use, such as force flash on or off, zoom.I'm hoping I can adjust and get used to the placement of the record button so I can avoid pressing it all the time.,-1,1
2316,1,21,Given my track record thus far, I'm not hopeful.,-1,1
2316,1,22,I'm also considering putting a small piece of tape over the button to help me 'feel' the button and not press it!If you buy this, good luck!,-1,1
2317,1,0,Poor Quality Camera.,-1,1
2317,1,1,Due to the poor picture quality of this camera, I returned it to Amazon as I was worried it was defective.,-1,1
2317,1,2,There was nothing I liked about this camera other than the color.,-1,1
2318,1,0,My Casio exlim died after owning it several years and so i thought i would go for a little nicer camera and go for the Nikon Cool pix s6200 ....the day i got it could hardly wait to test it out.,-1,1
2318,1,1,I bought a new memory disk for it making sure i was using the correct memory disk.,-1,0
2318,1,2,Well day one i was not impressed by the lack of speed this camera had, i wasnt impressed with much of any of it.,-1,0
2318,1,3,The picture quality wasnt any better than my Casio Exlim and the overall use wasnt as easy as my exlim.,-1,1
2318,1,4,I have had this camera about 6 weeks now and i am just requested a return on this item, the last few days i cant get the "ok" button just stopped working.,-1,1
2318,1,5,The "ok" button is the select botton so i cant change any of the settings or watch any videos on the camera.,-1,1
2318,1,6,I do not know if i just happened to get a bad camera but first impressions are alot and this put a sour taste in my mouth.,-1,1
2319,1,0,Loretta. the quality of the pictures are not very clear.,-1,0
2319,1,1,I was a little disappointed.,-1,0
2319,1,2,If you zoom in (which the zoom is good), the pictures are ALL blurry.,-1,0
2319,1,3,Overall, I wish I picked something better.,-1,0
2320,1,0,great concept, but needs work.,-1,0
2320,1,1,Android on a camera is a great idea, and the functionality you get from all those apps is great, as is the fact that images can get automatically uploaded to photo sharing sites.Unfortunately, Samsung's implementation is beset by numerous problems.Foremost, the image quality you get from this camera is comparable to Samsung's $100 low-end digital cameras (e.g., the ST76).,-1,0
2320,1,2,That's still better than any cell phone, but given the price, they should have done better.The camera user interface on the phone is usable but somewhat immature and gimmicky.,-1,1
2320,1,3,One of the most annoying things about it something seemingly small: you can't tell where you end up when you turn on the camera; after a long wait, you end up in the photo app by default, which means the lens extends, at other times, you just end up in whatever app you were before.,-1,1
2320,1,4,This means you constantly have the lens pushing into your hand.,-1,1
2320,1,5,Furthermore, many Android apps don't expect anything to happen when they initialize the camera, so they do it frequently, meaning in some apps, the lens retracts and extends frequently.Build quality is poor.,-1,1
2320,1,6,The shutter button fell off after a couple of weeks of use.,-1,1
2320,1,7,And trying to get support from Samsung is nearly hopeless: first, they referred me to a couple of TV repair places, then they decided the only way to replace the shutter button (probably a $0.10 part that just needs to be pushed back in) is to send in the camera.,-1,1
2320,1,8,Camera companies like Canon and Nikon have parts and repair centers available all over the world; with a Samsung camera, if anything breaks during a trip, you're left without a camera.My recommendation: unless you really need Android in a camera right now, wait for the next generation of Android cameras.,-1,1
2320,1,9,And I probably won't buy another camera from Samsung; their support may be fine for TVs and cell phones, but cameras are mechanically more complex and are used a lot during travel, and they simply don't have the necessary support for it.,-1,1
2321,1,0,Good for planning, not for navigating.,-1,0
2321,1,1,This map is useful for planning while sitting in the comfort of your home, or perhaps navigating the road system from your car, but is not, repeat not, a backcountry paddling map.,-1,0
2321,1,2,We brought this map on a week-long kayak trip.,-1,0
2321,1,3,The detail is insufficient to navigate the everglades.,-1,0
2321,1,4,Entire islands are missing from the map, some of which are substantial in size (10s of acres) and other island are misshapen.,-1,0
2321,1,5,If your compass skills are  solid you can get by usually if sticking to the outer islands, but one should certainly buy the nautical chart for Everglades.,-1,0
2321,1,6,It should say this in big red letters on the front.,-1,0
2321,1,7,This is the first time a trails illustrated map has failed us.,-1,0
2322,1,0,Save money and get NOAA/USGS maps.,-1,1
2322,1,1,After taking this map on a trip to the everglades I will warn all: do not rely on this map for navigation.,-1,1
2322,1,2,It is not up to date and it is very basic.,-1,1
2322,1,3,It is fine for the basic layout of things.,-1,1
2322,1,4,But do not use on the water trails for canoeing/kayaking.,-1,1
2323,1,0,Noisy images - good HD video.,-1,1
2323,1,1,Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35I bought this camera after reading hundreds of good reviews.However, it is a disappointment.The pictures have so much noise that I want to return it.,-1,1
2323,1,2,But since I bought it online and has 20% restocking fee plus shipping, I'll have to stick with it.Good:Great zoom.,-1,1
2323,1,3,Specially while recording video, the zoom is smooth and focuses quick.,-1,1
2323,1,4,Video/audio quality is very good and AVCHD lite h264 format lets capture more with less space.,-1,1
2323,1,5,Lightweight and small size.Good image quality only in sun light.,-1,1
2323,1,6,Good image quality if 100% magnification/crop is not required.BAD:Horrible noise in pictures at 100% magnification even at ISO-80.When zoomed, the noise increases.,-1,1
2323,1,7,Pictures taken indoors with flash also has noise and same with pictures in shadows.,-1,1
2323,1,8,My old Canon A560 has better picture quality indoors and in shadows.,-1,1
2323,1,9,It seems that FZ35 uses higher ISO and slow shutter speed to get pictures all the time and results in bad quality.Conclusion:Good camera for average all around purpose and for outdoor daylight situations.,-1,1
2323,1,10,HD video with zoom is great feature and worth the price.May be playing with Camera settings will help get better image quality.Only looking at out of the box image quality, I do not recommend this camera.,-1,1
2323,1,11,I'll play with settings and if I get any luck, will update.,-1,1
2324,1,0,Just a Big Point and Shoot.,-1,1
2324,1,1,I have no idea why I even bought this.,-1,1
2324,1,2,I guess I was under the assumption that bigger is better.,-1,1
2324,1,3,Well, in this case, it's not.The pictures are off color, it's a battery hog, the video format (at the time of purchase) was not supported by any program (that is changed now, but still), the LCD view screen has terrible resolution, and to top it all off it's big.Do yourself a favor and buy a nice little point and shoot with a zoom.,-1,1
2325,1,0,If Only First Impressions Lasted.,-1,0
2325,1,1,I purchased this camera for a really good price back in March of '11.,-1,0
2325,1,2,I LOVED this camera when I first got it.,-1,0
2325,1,3,I took over 200 pictures my first month owning the camera and everything was beautiful.,-1,0
2325,1,4,The photos where sharp, crisp, and the colors were great.,-1,0
2325,1,5,The files were overly large, but that didn't concern me.The battery being rechargable was something I was so excited for, and the battery life was superb!,-1,0
2325,1,6,I believe I got all 200 shots that first month on one charge.The,-1,0
2325,1,7,only draw back at that point was low light quality was not great.,-1,0
2325,1,8,But anything outdoors was amazing.In July the camera just wouldn't turn on.,-1,0
2325,1,9,I even went out and purchased a new battery and tried that, hoping the batter had just died.,-1,1
2325,1,10,So I called Panasonic.,-1,1
2325,1,11,They told me to send it back to them via UPS (at my expense of course) and they'd "review" it.,-1,1
2325,1,12,So I paid 20 dollars to ship the camera back via UPS to them in Texas.Now came the difficult part.,-1,1
2325,1,13,Waiting, and trying to find out information on what was going on.,-1,1
2325,1,14,I had a very hard time reaching anyone who spoke English clearly, or anyone who seemed to understand what I was asking.,-1,1
2325,1,15,I spent 3 hours on the phone one day being transferred from one customer service rep to another.,-1,1
2325,1,16,Finally, I managed to be told I was getting a replacement unit.About 3 weeks after my initial contact I did get a camera in the mail.,-1,1
2325,1,17,It's a refurbished model of the same exact camera.,-1,1
2325,1,18,I've had it since the beginning of August and have noticed a few problems that I didn't have with my first camera.1),-1,1
2325,1,19,When I have the lense extended the picture quality is 50/50.,-1,1
2325,1,20,Half the time I get a decent shot, the other half it seems like the lense shakes and I get a blurry picture.2) The focus on the camera is much worse than the first one.,-1,1
2325,1,21,If I have a super small item I am trying to do close up-the focus just isn't there.,-1,1
2325,1,22,I have to take the pictures further out than I'd like, and further out than I had to with the first camera.Neither of these are "returnable" items, so I'm stuck with what I have.,-1,1
2325,1,23,I'm slightly feared that the camera will break right after my one year warranty is up.,-1,1
2325,1,24,The upside is if it breaks before March, it *should* be covered by Panasonic.,-1,1
2325,1,25,However, a lot of online reviews later, I just feel lucky that they covered me the first time, there are a lot of negative reviews about how Panasonic deals with camera issues.Overall-,-1,1
2325,1,26,I think I'll be looking for a different brand the next time I need a camera.,-1,1
