Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.	-4.554
But if you hate lag, you'll love a quad core because there's just about always enough processor for whatever the device is doing.	-4.997
Many tablet cameras are doing 1080p video.Multitasking: Side-By-Side windowing works only with Samsung apps, and the concept doesn't work that well in execution since you can't interact with both windows simultaneously.	-5.203

I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.	-4.389
There should be a micro or mini USB port on the left side of the device (in landscape) so that it can be used in landscape or portrait while propped up on a stand.	-5.676
Sure, you won't get the super-high 1080p clarity you might get with a different higher-res tablet, but who wants to waste SD card space on a video twice the size for a display that's not even close to a desktop monitor in size?	-5.755

So no websites which use Java can work....and I believe this is on all Android devices.	-4.982
Secondly, given that this is an android device, one would expect google products to work seamlessly with it....nope...Chrome is quite frankly rubbish on this device.	-5.229

Tablets always left me wanting more interaction that just simply swiping the screen and watching videos, but this Note tablet is everything I wanted all the other tablets to be.There seems to be two drawbacks according to most reviews I read and that was no HD resolution and the "flimsy" casing.	-5.595

One complaint is that the screen is VERY bright and I've not found a way to dim it.	-5.273

Screen rotation is a bit too sensitive.	-5.351
This bugs me a bit and I carry a micro-fiber cloth for the screen wherever I go, but without a case, the back gets as much or more cloth time.3.	-5.642
Also, the body is smooth and slick, and until I had a case I found it hard to keep a firm hold on the device.-	-5.646

Apps can only install on default memory*.	-4.726
This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.	-4.788
While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-	-4.824

It does NOT have flash player nor can you download it from the app store.	-5.064
I wud like there to be more apps for the S pen since I find the Snote kind of limited when it comes about doing diagrams and flowcharts (if anyone can recommend me an app to do so id be thankful) Another thing is that i dont know how to save the snotes i make when open it from the mini apps, say im using the kindle app reading and i want to take some notes then i close the snote and there s no way i can re open it again with what i had written down before.	-5.065

I think it will be fine but Samsung always seems to have some quality issues which some of their great products which I just do not understand.	-5.288
Again, the back is most likely not an issue but it does kind of feel "cheap".	-5.322
You are paying extra for the Wacom screen technology and also sacrificing some resolution, so if you're not in love with the S-pen, then I'd look at other tablets.	-5.560
