B008DWG5HE,0,0,For those who wants to use this device to read.
B008DWG5HE,0,1,I suggest you buy amazon kindle fire HD, although there's no S-pen.
B008DWG5HE,0,2,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,0,3,I love it!
B008DWG5HE,0,4,But if I use this device, I cannot see the character clearly.
B008DWG5HE,0,5,Larger screen for reading, magazine viewing and pictures than a Nook.
B008DWG5HE,0,6,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,0,7,Colors are bright, text is crisp when viewed like you would normally, and 720p (HD) videos look fantastic.
B008DWG5HE,0,8,I am guessing, from reading comparative reviews of the ASus transformer infinity, that these things would not occur on a high resolution screen.
B008DWG5HE,0,9,Because S-pen is not that useful.I returned it after one day because of the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,0,10,Like, but not in love yet.
B008DWG5HE,0,11,I'm on my second book out of a 3 book series using the Kindle app.
B008DWG5HE,0,12,Although the display is colorful and vivid, the resolution lags other tablets in this price class like the Asus Transformer Pad Infinity and the iPad (3rd Gen).
B008DWG5HE,0,13,With the sun shining directly on the screen, I can read it fine.
B008DWG5HE,0,14,It is bright and colors are vibrant.
B008DWG5HE,0,15,And I confess, I bought one of the first iPads when they came out, have upgraded every time since so am pretty much married to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,0,16,I also read a lot, and while the 10.1" format is a bit clunky for e-reading compared to my 7" Nook Color (the large size makes it more awkward to hold even though it's actually lighter), it's adequate for the purpose.However, that's the beauty of android tablets -- there's sizes and types for everyone.
B008DWG5HE,0,17,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,0,18,The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.
B008DWG5HE,0,19,I would recommend using the rubber nibbed for better traction if you're using a naked screen.
B008DWG5HE,0,20,For the naysayers who complain about the screen resolution and compare it to the Retina display on the iPad, my first comment is guess what?
B008DWG5HE,0,21,The 10 inch display is fine plus its size and weight.
B008DWG5HE,0,22,I've been carrying around a sketchbook and pencil forever, but it's frustrating to only be able to work in shades of gray (who wants to cart around a case of colored pencils or pastels to all places?) as well as having to scan and re-touch the scans of any sketches I make.The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is what I ended up upgrading from a Nook Color.
B008DWG5HE,0,23,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,0,24,OK, let;s get it over with, the screen isn't as high resolution as the Apple, but it;s pretty good.
B008DWG5HE,1,0,Other apps can give you .psd
B008DWG5HE,1,1,It's only for S Note app.  - Multiscreen feature can only be used with few built-in apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,2,opening apps & navagating around the O/S- able to play the HD .mkv
B008DWG5HE,1,3,I found it logical for the most part.The app selection seems very good.
B008DWG5HE,1,4,Great.
B008DWG5HE,1,5,While downloading apps, the Google Play Store froze on the Asus, never on the Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,1,6,I wanted a tablet that had a 10.1" screen, could play HD .mkv
B008DWG5HE,1,7,It does NOT have flash player nor can you download it from the app store.
B008DWG5HE,1,8,The handwriting app is good.
B008DWG5HE,1,9,You can always browse the Google Play store before buying the tablet to see if what you want is there (although not all apps are supported by all devices- I learned sadly the Popcap games there are not supported for this tablet).
B008DWG5HE,1,10,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,1,11,It also supports Nook and Kindle (and I'm sure others) so you can shop at other app stores too for your games, music, movies, books, etc, you are not tied just to Google.I think this tablet is a great size for reading, I generally tilt it sideways for browsing the web or reading.
B008DWG5HE,1,12,And, you are constantly getting reminders from Google Play to update all of those pre-installed apps that you never use.
B008DWG5HE,1,13,It is easy to use, and the screen/display is great!
B008DWG5HE,1,14,So basically it is up to the app developers to integrate stylus/handwriting into their apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,15,When I got the device I expected to be able to have any 2 apps running at the same time, so I could watch Netflix while using IMDB, etc.  Thus far, I have only found one or two apps from the market that support the split screen function.-
B008DWG5HE,1,16,Admittedly a Samsung fan-boy, but apps and pen make it both a fun and productive device.
B008DWG5HE,1,17,This shortcoming is more an issue with Android.
B008DWG5HE,1,18,Their store is useful but that is all I use.
B008DWG5HE,1,19,But hey that's what Google is for.
B008DWG5HE,1,20,However, I am quite familiar to android OS on my phone.
B008DWG5HE,1,21,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,1,22,- Handwriting recognition works awesome for even bad handwriting, but only available for S Note app.  - I set up google voice with groove ip app and, now I can use this tablet as a wifi-based cell phone.
B008DWG5HE,1,23,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,24,I can make whatever mix of widgets and app icons wherever I want (you have 6 full screens you can lay out and swipe between, so I made themed ones- email, news, calendar, games, internet apps, and music/videos).
B008DWG5HE,2,0,Great.
B008DWG5HE,2,1,I love it!
B008DWG5HE,2,2,This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device.
B008DWG5HE,2,3,Great tablet but do your research before buying.
B008DWG5HE,2,4,From one artist to any others out there, do not buy this product.
B008DWG5HE,2,5,I should have bought an Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,2,6,I compared prices and specification and of course Amazon price won!
B008DWG5HE,2,7,All of these awesome devices are coming out at actual competitive prices, who the heck can justify paying 550 for THIS?!
B008DWG5HE,2,8,Since I've purchased this tablet I can't put it down.
B008DWG5HE,2,9,I bought this before I went on Vacation last summer, So I have now owned it for about 9 months.
B008DWG5HE,2,10,At roughly $200 it is a great price and very snappy tablet.
B008DWG5HE,2,11,All the other features are great but what good are they if you can't print your reciept after purchasing your item  from Amazon?
B008DWG5HE,2,12,Absolutely Love this Tablet.
B008DWG5HE,2,13,Got this tablet for my husband as a gift and for 6 months it was great and he was extremely happy with it.
B008DWG5HE,2,14,This is one of the best online purchases I have made and absolutely love it.
B008DWG5HE,2,15,I bought the Note after reading the many reviews here.
B008DWG5HE,2,16,Now that the price has dropped for this device since the new model has been released this tablet is a great deal.
B008DWG5HE,2,17,I have owned 2 other android tablets before this and this 1 is by far the best.
B008DWG5HE,2,18,Best Android tablet I have owned.
B008DWG5HE,2,19,I think I am happy with it.
B008DWG5HE,2,20,I'm happy.
B008DWG5HE,2,21,It seems that everytime a new tablet comes out like this, set at this price point, people ask "is this the ipad killer"?
B008DWG5HE,2,22,The tablet I was waiting for: High performance - Great functionalities - Nice handwritting recognition (although it can still be improved)It's worth the money I pay for it
B008DWG5HE,2,23,This is my first purchase of a tablet and I choose Samsung Galaxy note 10.1 ( I was thinking about this for over an year and trying to get it at the right time and price).
B008DWG5HE,2,24,you can get this in some kind of sale, for like $200, it is not worth it.
B008DWG5HE,3,0,It had ample battery life sufficient for my use.
B008DWG5HE,3,1,Battery doesn't last long.
B008DWG5HE,3,2,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,3,3,Battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,4,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,3,5,Always seems like we are charging it.
B008DWG5HE,3,6,I think I was down to 77% or something so battery life should be fine.
B008DWG5HE,3,7,The battery doesn't last that long as I would have liked but that's fine with me.
B008DWG5HE,3,8,Same usage as entry 1) above, except at 30% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 10 hours.
B008DWG5HE,3,9,home page takes about 15 seconds to fully load.Battery:I timed various usages with a chronometer and this is what I found:1) 1-1/2 hour of video at 100% brightness, 1 hour of internet with wifi on, the rest of the time using polaris office and s-note side-by-side at 60% brightness, power saving mode off - battery only lasted 6-1/2 hours.
B008DWG5HE,3,10,I have to charge pretty much every other day and at times daily if I use it a lot.
B008DWG5HE,3,11,I don't really use the Note features but so far battery life is decent, speed is quite good for an older model and the tablet is pretty light.
B008DWG5HE,3,12,Pretty good.Thus, as you can see, the battery life seems to depend heavily on how brightly the screen is set.
B008DWG5HE,3,13,The battery does seem to do well and I had the screen pretty bright and working on a digital sketch for about 2 hours.
B008DWG5HE,3,14,Definitely not good.2) Continual looping the movie "Immortals" at 50% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 9 hours.
B008DWG5HE,3,15,Battery drain seems faster than iPad.
B008DWG5HE,3,16,If you are playing a game the battery goes low way to quick.
B008DWG5HE,3,17,The display is nice and bright and the unit can be used even outside on a sunny day.
B008DWG5HE,3,18,It also supports Bluetooth.I was very impressed with the battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,19,The battery lasts for the period stated, even with high usage.
B008DWG5HE,3,20,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B008DWG5HE,3,21,I don't remember having to recharge the iPad the same day regardless of usage.5.
B008DWG5HE,3,22,Work and Home Companion.
B008DWG5HE,3,23,It is powerful.
B008DWG5HE,3,24,Android has lots to learn about managing its battery, but this tablet will run for several days of moderate use on a single charge.
B008DWG5HE,4,0,And the sound quality and volume were excellent.
B008DWG5HE,4,1,Build quality is top notch.
B008DWG5HE,4,2,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,4,3,Feature-Packed Tablet, Better than Expected.
B008DWG5HE,4,4,OK, let;s get it over with, the screen isn't as high resolution as the Apple, but it;s pretty good.
B008DWG5HE,4,5,Great tablet, but would be better if it was cheaper.
B008DWG5HE,4,6,But to those people I also ask, wouldnt it be much better, or wouldnt you feel like you got your money's worth more if it had a solid metal backing, or maybe even a better screen res?
B008DWG5HE,4,7,You should have not issues covering the speakers with your hands.Build Quality - GOOD - Nice fit and finish, no loose parts, no surprises.
B008DWG5HE,4,8,I sincerely believe they could have built a better tablet than this (at the price they are asking for it).
B008DWG5HE,4,9,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,4,10,But the two things that are holding it back, in my opinion is the cheap build quality and screen res.
B008DWG5HE,4,11,I wanted a tablet that had a 10.1" screen, could play HD .mkv
B008DWG5HE,4,12,movies (it can even stream them from my server), which the tegra 2 cpus struggled with- very good at multitasking using the including multitasking apps- excellent at note taking using both the built in s-note app and Quill- long battery life (only had to charge it once or so a week)- nice loud stereo speakersCons:- no HD screen; although the screen isn't bad, given the price of the tablet and how this is a flagship model it should have come with a higher resolution screen like its competitors from Asus and Apple- build quality; again while not bad, it just doesnt feel like a $500US tablet with all the plastic.-
B008DWG5HE,4,13,It has the look and feel of a top of the line tablet--and at this price it should.
B008DWG5HE,4,14,The tablet itself is sturdy, with great resolution.
B008DWG5HE,4,15,Seems very accurate.WiFi - Seems to have strong reception and fast throughput throughout the house.GPS - Strong reception, quickly got accuracy to 20 feet indoors.Sound Quality - VERY GOOD - The front speakers are really nice for a tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,16,Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 Should have been great....
B008DWG5HE,4,17,While I liked the Asus better for the screen quality and cool dock the Acer had all the right ports on board and was very durable.
B008DWG5HE,4,18,I also like the two-tone white and silver plastics, the white in particular has a nice pearlescent finish.Specs: Some impressive internal specs with 2GBs of RAMCons:Display: Screen resolution is very low compared to the competition which makes this poor for reading text.Construction: All plastic construction which creeks and flexes to a small degree.Performance: Despite it's impressive specs, the tablet is noticeably laggy in all aspects of its operation.
B008DWG5HE,4,19,Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine.
B008DWG5HE,4,20,It did not disappoint.Firstly, this tablet is fast, really fast.
B008DWG5HE,4,21,On paper and specification details it sounds like it should be great.
B008DWG5HE,4,22,My point is just this, for $500, which what HIGH END tablets are going for, I would expect a little better.
B008DWG5HE,4,23,It also supports Adobe Reader for .pdfs.The speakers are good, but I also love that it has a headphone port.
B008DWG5HE,4,24,I do think Samsung has the right idea about the speakers in the front, genius really!
B008DWG5HE,5,0,picture great sound!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,5,1,- Camera is awesome under normal light.
B008DWG5HE,5,2,It seems required for any portable device to have a camera nowadays, and both front and back are there, but the photos aren't great.
B008DWG5HE,5,3,I wear glasses so its the right size for me, yet its small enough to fit in my tote.
B008DWG5HE,5,4,It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something.
B008DWG5HE,5,5,Pictures look well defined and clear.
B008DWG5HE,5,6,Because of the many features it has also almost replaced my digital camera.
B008DWG5HE,5,7,Its thin and uses Gorilla Glass.
B008DWG5HE,5,8,Its still a good feature if you don't have super high expectations.The camera is adequate, but unimpressive.
B008DWG5HE,5,9,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,5,10,For low lighted scenarios, quality of photo may go down.
B008DWG5HE,5,11,The only reason I have this four stars was that the camera sometimes does not focus well if you are taking a photo of a room.
B008DWG5HE,5,12,If I'm taking serious pictures, I'll stick to the digital camera I got.
B008DWG5HE,5,13,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B008DWG5HE,5,14,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,5,15,Just trying to find a decent tablet can be taxing with all the options and issues.
B008DWG5HE,5,16,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,5,17,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,5,18,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,5,19,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,5,20,You can see the quick study I did of "Flaming June" by Leighton on my user profile as my user photo (Sketchbook Pro app was used)I've been looking for a tablet to use while away from my desktop machine for sketching and jotting down ideas.
B008DWG5HE,5,21,- I love note taking features.
B008DWG5HE,5,22,Animated features and movies with brightly lit scenes are ok.
B008DWG5HE,5,23,I figured it must piss off Apple enough to some degree so I thought it must be pretty good.
B008DWG5HE,5,24,There are so many apps that come with this tablet, too many to mention.
B008DWG5HE,6,0,It did not disappoint.Firstly, this tablet is fast, really fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,1,Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.
B008DWG5HE,6,2,Amazingly fast and responsive!
B008DWG5HE,6,3,Don't expect a quad core to be amazingly faster than a dual core, but it can handle concurrent tasks with aplomb.Cons:1.
B008DWG5HE,6,4,But if you hate lag, you'll love a quad core because there's just about always enough processor for whatever the device is doing.
B008DWG5HE,6,5,I do think that the price needs to go down a bit, and this could be a superb one.
B008DWG5HE,6,6,Fast, however, while faster than my old Xoom I have to say the difference is not all that noticeable.
B008DWG5HE,6,7,Now I would be the first to say that I probably will never truly task a quad core to its max potential.
B008DWG5HE,6,8,I've used several tablets and smart phones with different processors and the best in my opinion is a quad core.
B008DWG5HE,6,9,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,10,I don't really use the Note features but so far battery life is decent, speed is quite good for an older model and the tablet is pretty light.
B008DWG5HE,6,11,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,6,12,Handling is smooth, and applications open quickly.
B008DWG5HE,6,13,Battery life.
B008DWG5HE,6,14,If you are playing a game the battery goes low way to quick.
B008DWG5HE,6,15,Great tablet, but would be better if it was cheaper.
B008DWG5HE,6,16,At roughly $200 it is a great price and very snappy tablet.
B008DWG5HE,6,17,That is, you can have multiple apps running at the same time on screen but at this point, the number apps that are compatible is VERY limited.Second, the advert reads "Exceptional Performance with Quad Core Processor".
B008DWG5HE,6,18,It does switch between applications quickly, and when running two applications in split screen, seems to handle them both well.-
B008DWG5HE,6,19,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,6,20,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,6,21,Web pages loading time is fast but not nearly as fast as my laptop.
B008DWG5HE,6,22,They expect you to buy all their high priced video games and movies in their Play Store.
B008DWG5HE,6,23,So far, so good.
B008DWG5HE,6,24,Many tablet cameras are doing 1080p video.Multitasking: Side-By-Side windowing works only with Samsung apps, and the concept doesn't work that well in execution since you can't interact with both windows simultaneously.
B008DWG5HE,7,0,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,1,The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,2,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,3,I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.
B008DWG5HE,7,4,SD card slot usles.
B008DWG5HE,7,5,I bought this 16G tablet and installed a 16G SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,6,you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory?
B008DWG5HE,7,7,I purchased the 16 gig version of the tablet along with a 32 gig SD card for just that purpose, only to find out that I can't do that.
B008DWG5HE,7,8,What is best about this product is the 32gb of storage.
B008DWG5HE,7,9,It seems reasonable that it is the user who should determine if speed or memory space is more important.
B008DWG5HE,7,10,Haven't yet figured out how to put files onto the SD chip instead of the internal drive.The tablet comes with a two year 50 Gig access to Dropbox (file storage).
B008DWG5HE,7,11,I did some reading and decided on the 16GB since the tablet has space for ample expansion, and you can get a far larger micro SD card for the $50 difference- I got the 64GB SanDisk class 10 one.
B008DWG5HE,7,12,Free Dropbox storage is only 2 gig.
B008DWG5HE,7,13,I was able to move over my music, video files, and other docs I wanted access to and still have a good amount of space left.I also already use Dropbox and love it.
B008DWG5HE,7,14,I opted for the increased memory model because I wanted to feel as if I had the option for more memory.For traveling, it's great.
B008DWG5HE,7,15,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,7,16,The only thing to be aware of is some things will only work or want to go on the internal memory, and like any storage drive, the number is a lie.
B008DWG5HE,7,17,Sure, you won't get the super-high 1080p clarity you might get with a different higher-res tablet, but who wants to waste SD card space on a video twice the size for a display that's not even close to a desktop monitor in size?
B008DWG5HE,7,18,If I had known that, I would've purchased the 32 gig version of the tablet.Overall, I think that this is an excellent tablet, and there's a lot of potential.
B008DWG5HE,7,19,Warning... Samsung tablets and phones do not allow you to store apps in the SD memory.
B008DWG5HE,7,20,Thinner and lighter than my old iPad 2, I prefer keeping it in a case to avoid any issues with dropping/dinging it.In terms of peripherals - You can use up to a 64GB micro SD card with this tablet, which is one of the reasons I went with the 16GB instead of 32GB version (check the price difference between the extra GB edition vs microSD pricing).
B008DWG5HE,7,21,As Androids to, this is the best one.
B008DWG5HE,7,22,While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-
B008DWG5HE,7,23,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,7,24,It did not disappoint.Firstly, this tablet is fast, really fast.
B008DWG5HE,8,0,I don't really need wifi that much and use the note to take notes, and would rather not have to back everything up again, so I'm going without the wifi.
B008DWG5HE,8,1,WiFi suddenly doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,8,2,WIFI ONLY.
B008DWG5HE,8,3,For those who wants to use this device to read.
B008DWG5HE,8,4,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,8,5,It's portable, fast and works well in a mobile environment.
B008DWG5HE,8,6,It says in the settings that it's connected to the school network, but when I try to access the internet, it doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,8,7,So I didn't send it back.Great device love it my kids love it.great
B008DWG5HE,8,8,Web pages loading time is fast but not nearly as fast as my laptop.
B008DWG5HE,8,9,This is a great device and very useful for teaching and other such tasks.
B008DWG5HE,8,10,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,8,11,But if I use this device, I cannot see the character clearly.
B008DWG5HE,8,12,I don't know if the problem is with the device, android OS, the school network or any combination of the three but the problem is that since this device isn't as popular as the iPad, the problem isn't going to be solved anytime soon.So if you need reliable access to wifi, this device may not be for you.
B008DWG5HE,8,13,As a desktop user, I began to get used to it and use it in my work as writer.
B008DWG5HE,8,14,It is useful but for those problems.
B008DWG5HE,8,15,It runs smoothly and quickly.It finds and connects to wifi easily.
B008DWG5HE,8,16,All webpages should be functional on mobile devices.
B008DWG5HE,8,17,Overall it s a nice tablet plenty useful for reading and taking notes whichs is basically what i do most so far.
B008DWG5HE,8,18,I got this tablet because I'm an amateur artist and I wanted to get a device that was good to draw on as well as had basic laptop functionality to replace my old one so I'm not as tied to my PC.
B008DWG5HE,8,19,Amazingly fast and responsive!
B008DWG5HE,8,20,Across the board tablets do not fulfill all the aspects of computing that a laptop or desktop computer might, and for those aspects that they do fulfill, the tend to do so with some caveats.
B008DWG5HE,8,21,Great in some ways.
B008DWG5HE,8,22,However, I will say that I have no problem reading small text on internet pages or on pdf files.
B008DWG5HE,8,23,I actually see absolutely no problem with the graphics from the few videos I have watched.
B008DWG5HE,8,24,I bought this tab as a mobile alternative to my laptop for light processing, i.e. working on documents, some light graphic editing etc.
B008DWG5HE,9,0,Nice Unit.
B008DWG5HE,9,1,It is smooth, fast, nice looking, and has the S-Pen.
B008DWG5HE,9,2,Please tell me you are working hard... Photoshop touch is nice but it ain't illustrator.I use Note pretty much indoors, so I am not in the position to tell people whether the screen is bright outside.
B008DWG5HE,9,3,Good tablet for 2012.
B008DWG5HE,9,4,10.1 size gives me a larger screen for productivity but not so large that it becomes less portable.
B008DWG5HE,9,5,Work and Home Companion.
B008DWG5HE,9,6,It is easy to use, and the screen/display is great!
B008DWG5HE,9,7,I am a avid typer (can you tell by the length of my article?), but for typing I was satisfied with using the touch screen.
B008DWG5HE,9,8,I have not played with the S pen yet because I want to get a screen protector first.
B008DWG5HE,9,9,Included S Pen does not have the eraser side seen in some online videos.Gaming - VERY GOOD - Frame rates are fantastic, touch and accelerometer responsiveness seem great.
B008DWG5HE,9,10,The Galaxy Note had some of the best and most consistently good reviews on the Internet, and given how much I loved and used my previous tablet, I decided to upgrade to the Galaxy.Good:- Lightweight- Good screen- Good sound- The S-Pen is nice, though I use it mostly in games and programs when the touch zones are too small for my fingers.
B008DWG5HE,9,11,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,9,12,I am actually typing this review on my tablet.
B008DWG5HE,9,13,The Kensington keyboard that I use with my Note does not pair with it perfectly and supplies strange letters from other languages from time to time.
B008DWG5HE,9,14,It's not just any stylus, but an actual wacom-style digitizer, enabling pressure sensitivity.
B008DWG5HE,9,15,The writing on it is soooo life like and you can easily connect it's writing with my own paper hand writing.
B008DWG5HE,9,16,Wacom penabled, the S Pen has "good enough" pressure sensitivity (probably on par with a Bamboo based on my own subjective feel/use) and is also great for note taking.
B008DWG5HE,9,17,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,9,18,When using the tablet outdoors in bright sunlight, I find that the screen is bright enough to read text comfortably providing it is positioned properly with respect to the sun.
B008DWG5HE,9,19,Other tablets support a stylus, but they all have a rounded rubber end or a clear plastic disc around the point if it is fine, because the touch technology works differently for those tablets.
B008DWG5HE,9,20,I wanted it for art -- I draw as a hobby, but haven't for years -- and the description of the S-Pen's sensitivity really made it sound like a perfect match.I'm afraid though that the pen sensitivity is nothing to write home about.
B008DWG5HE,9,21,I got this because of the stylus being hard and sharp, but not so important now.ziggy
B008DWG5HE,9,22,I occasionally sketch things, s-pen is quite responsive and its behavior is predictable although not perfect.
B008DWG5HE,9,23,Everything on screen is still visible, just no touch function at all with either finger or pen.
B008DWG5HE,9,24,I would also mention that the pen doesn't produce different line weights in response to pressure in the s-note program.
B008DWG5HE,10,0,Excellent Deal.
B008DWG5HE,10,1,Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a very nice tablet, it functions well.
B008DWG5HE,10,2,- Infrared and bluetooth are functioning well.
B008DWG5HE,10,3,HUGE improvement over G Tab 2.Compass - Worked great.
B008DWG5HE,10,4,I love my Samsung galaxy note.
B008DWG5HE,10,5,Not as good as Alt+Tab, but a close secondBLUETOOTH KEYBOARDI think a bluetooth keyboard is a must.
B008DWG5HE,10,6,Note 10.1  a great Tablet that have many functionabilities that others don't.Best thing is the fact that have 32Gb and the expandible memory.Galaxy Rocks!
B008DWG5HE,10,7,That is one thing the ipad seems to have over Samsung is the devices seem a little more resistant to trauma.
B008DWG5HE,10,8,Things feel less clunky than with the Tab 2.Overall it is very similar; primarily hardware boosted.
B008DWG5HE,10,9,Work and Home Companion.
B008DWG5HE,10,10,- Stylus pen is good and easy to hold for average size hand.
B008DWG5HE,10,11,I have the logitech keyboard/case which is designed for the galaxy tab w/o the SPEN (This was a buying mistake on my end) and it works great with what I have, even if not the way I had originally envisioned.
B008DWG5HE,10,12,The Note 10.1 packs some impressive specs and features and makes the best case for a stylus yet.
B008DWG5HE,10,13,(But, see my note below)Not so good:- I can feel the body flex when I hold it and I am not confident it would survive a serious fall (I once dropped my Xoom on concrete and it survived).
B008DWG5HE,10,14,So far, so good.
B008DWG5HE,10,15,Also, the body is smooth and slick, and until I had a case I found it hard to keep a firm hold on the device.-
B008DWG5HE,10,16,I had a Xoom for almost 2 years and loved it.
B008DWG5HE,10,17,Some quick first impressions of the Note 10.1 - This tablet is what the Transformer Prime should have been.
B008DWG5HE,10,18,Bad charger, Bad Quick Commands... Elsewise, nice.
B008DWG5HE,10,19,I need a few apps that work, not 20 where half of them are crap and the other half half work with one or two stand outs.
B008DWG5HE,10,20,- I love note taking features.
B008DWG5HE,10,21,Samsung devices each seem to require their own charger and none of them seem interchangeable at all.
B008DWG5HE,10,22,Fast, however, while faster than my old Xoom I have to say the difference is not all that noticeable.
B008DWG5HE,10,23,So I didn't send it back.Great device love it my kids love it.great
B008DWG5HE,10,24,Samsung was on the path to great product until they started to make it exclusive to thier products!!
B008DWG5HE,11,0,Also, the Note 10.1 has no built in full size or mini USB or HDMI ports.
B008DWG5HE,11,1,- Volume is good, even louder than my laptops.
B008DWG5HE,11,2,Samsung devices each seem to require their own charger and none of them seem interchangeable at all.
B008DWG5HE,11,3,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,11,4,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,11,5,It's only for S Note app.  - Multiscreen feature can only be used with few built-in apps.
B008DWG5HE,11,6,It came fully packaged, sparkling with perfection...
B008DWG5HE,11,7,But I feel it is quite bright, usually I put 30-40 % of maximum brightness.What was the reason to use 30 pin adapter instead of using microUSB?
B008DWG5HE,11,8,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,11,9,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,11,10,- Camera is awesome under normal light.
B008DWG5HE,11,11,Samsung does offer adapters that connect to the charging port--but that is an extra cost and an inconvience.
B008DWG5HE,11,12,- I love note taking features.
B008DWG5HE,11,13,Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such.
B008DWG5HE,11,14,Great tablet with little room for improvements.
B008DWG5HE,11,15,- Infrared and bluetooth are functioning well.
B008DWG5HE,11,16,This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device.
B008DWG5HE,11,17,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,11,18,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,11,19,To plug a flash/thumb drive directly into the Note 10.1 you have to buy a adapter.
B008DWG5HE,11,20,Great tablet but it does not support flash!
B008DWG5HE,11,21,I played it at best buy for a while and I was drooling.
B008DWG5HE,11,22,The keyboard does not work well.
B008DWG5HE,11,23,I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.
B008DWG5HE,11,24,It also supports Bluetooth.I was very impressed with the battery life.
B008DWG5HE,12,0,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,12,1,And it works as advertised.
B008DWG5HE,12,2,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,12,3,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,12,4,The protector looks great (little glare), works fine with the S-pen, and wasn't too hard to get on without bubbles.
B008DWG5HE,12,5,It is easy to use, and the screen/display is great!
B008DWG5HE,12,6,It is easy to conceive drone system for transporting package.
B008DWG5HE,12,7,Great idea, LOTS OF BUGS.
B008DWG5HE,12,8,As Androids to, this is the best one.
B008DWG5HE,12,9,This is  the only good thing about it.
B008DWG5HE,12,10,Great ideas.
B008DWG5HE,12,11,I really wanted to like the Note - and don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful device, feels great to the touch and does anything your smartphone does on a bigger screen and a little bit more.
B008DWG5HE,12,12,OK, let;s get it over with, the screen isn't as high resolution as the Apple, but it;s pretty good.
B008DWG5HE,12,13,I put the Mini-guard matte anti-glare screen protector on right out of the box so there would be minimal chance for dust and that worked really well.
B008DWG5HE,12,14,It has so much features I'm not done exploring it.
B008DWG5HE,12,15,Also, the body is smooth and slick, and until I had a case I found it hard to keep a firm hold on the device.-
B008DWG5HE,12,16,It is smooth, fast, nice looking, and has the S-Pen.
B008DWG5HE,12,17,And I confess, I bought one of the first iPads when they came out, have upgraded every time since so am pretty much married to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,12,18,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,12,19,Perfect tablet.
B008DWG5HE,12,20,Pull up maps, circle locations, go split screen and make notes, Like all of Samsung's other products, a winner.
B008DWG5HE,12,21,Handy Device!!!
B008DWG5HE,12,22,I've used the screenshot feature quite a bit.
B008DWG5HE,12,23,Of course runs on android.
B008DWG5HE,12,24,So far, so good.
B008DWG5HE,13,0,Samsung was on the path to great product until they started to make it exclusive to thier products!!
B008DWG5HE,13,1,bad service so far I have not received the goods since being purchased from the 15th of January  nnnn n.
B008DWG5HE,13,2,Samsung makes a great pad with excellent support.
B008DWG5HE,13,3,I do not own any Apple or Android products, so I wasn't tied to either company.
B008DWG5HE,13,4,I cannot begin to describe how helpful the dual-view is.
B008DWG5HE,13,5,I truly love my Samsung Galaxy and because I'm a droid girl, I would never consider Apple product.
B008DWG5HE,13,6,Samsung blames the printer that has no problems with other android or even a ipad.
B008DWG5HE,13,7,Satisfied customer that I am with this purchase than BestBuy.
B008DWG5HE,13,8,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B008DWG5HE,13,9,Product is fine and I love Samsung products but seller gets 3 stars for product seal broken.
B008DWG5HE,13,10,I know little about Apple products.
B008DWG5HE,13,11,A phone call to Samsung tech support, and YES - Samsung BELIEVES in customer support at no extra charge, confirmed the absence of autofocus in the rear facing camera!
B008DWG5HE,13,12,Shipped on time and tablet was intact, exceptions were fine.
B008DWG5HE,13,13,They said to return it back to sam's club, sam's club says to contact Samsung instead.
B008DWG5HE,13,14,Best tablet for students--much better than ipad for college productivity.
B008DWG5HE,13,15,Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs.
B008DWG5HE,13,16,I guess I will again have to hunt for myself to see if I can find specs.I don't know whether Samsung is inexperienced in the tablet world and their customer service isn't up to speed, or they are reacting to all the litigation issues with Apple, or both, but I'm disappointed that I'm having to figure things out myself.
B008DWG5HE,13,17,This is my first purchase of a tablet and I choose Samsung Galaxy note 10.1 ( I was thinking about this for over an year and trying to get it at the right time and price).
B008DWG5HE,13,18,Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned.
B008DWG5HE,13,19,When I received it, the screen was messed up and this was the second one I ordered from this company.
B008DWG5HE,13,20,Nice tablet, minimal Samsung support.
B008DWG5HE,13,21,I even get clearer reception than my home phone when making long distance calls to US and Canada.
B008DWG5HE,13,22,I like Samsung and their features offered but customer service needs improvement if they plan to keep customers.Anyone have suggestions for a mid level Ipad that would function for work and personal use?
B008DWG5HE,13,23,For photos of people (smile shot) it does a great job.This has almost replaced my cell phone since I use apps for phone calls and messaging.
B008DWG5HE,13,24,Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 Should have been great....
B008DWG5HE,14,0,I have owned 2 other android tablets before this and this 1 is by far the best.
B008DWG5HE,14,1,Best Android tablet I have owned.
B008DWG5HE,14,2,I was torn between this and the Microsoft Surface Pro.
B008DWG5HE,14,3,No Flashplayer operation.....I wanted this instead of the Apple iPad...now its just like the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,14,4,The digitizer is pretty good, but I actually prefer the Surface pro digitizer but that is more of an ultrabook then a tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,5,This function only seems to work in the sketching program.
B008DWG5HE,14,6,The handwriting app is good.
B008DWG5HE,14,7,It is smooth, fast, nice looking, and has the S-Pen.
B008DWG5HE,14,8,Switching from one window to another merely requires a tap on the window you want to work in.
B008DWG5HE,14,9,The iPad eventually took the place of the laptop due to ease of use and portability........well move over iPad.
B008DWG5HE,14,10,Im not an apple fanboy, in fact, I dont own a single apple product, I do own a bunch of android devices though and I have to say from experience, this one isnt too hot.
B008DWG5HE,14,11,If you do need a tablet with the pen and windows, and are willing to put up with the pen's deficiencies, you might like the note 10.1, but I'ld wait for the price to come down.
B008DWG5HE,14,12,The S-pen is very good, much like the Surface Pro's pen, except it's at half the price.2.
B008DWG5HE,14,13,Or, you can detach them and move them around, adjust their size, and have a third app running in another window in the background as well.
B008DWG5HE,14,14,It will automatically tile two windows side-by-side, and you can adjust the proportion of the screen that each inhabits.
B008DWG5HE,14,15,It did not disappoint.Firstly, this tablet is fast, really fast.
B008DWG5HE,14,16,The other one I was more seriously looking at was the Nexus 10, but I wanted the better pen experience over the better resolution.One thing I want to make clear about the S-pen is this is the ONLY tablet that currently uses Wacom technology, which is the best for artistic work.
B008DWG5HE,14,17,I also expected it to be a little lighter than it is, but this is not a big deal for me.The S-Pen also works much better on the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,18,It's a better value than iPad2 with more features and functionality.
B008DWG5HE,14,19,And I confess, I bought one of the first iPads when they came out, have upgraded every time since so am pretty much married to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,14,20,If you don't have a need for the pen or windows, you might be better off with the Asus transformer infinity, which has a high resolution screen, super bright screen, aluminum housing, and costs $100 less.
B008DWG5HE,14,21,This just works much better for me in a business environment.The S pen takes a bit of getting used to but I find it becoming more and more instinctive to use.
B008DWG5HE,14,22,It pains me very much to say anything positive about Microsoft, but their bundled handwriting and journaling software with their old laptop tablets were far superior to what Samsung/Android provide.
B008DWG5HE,14,23,My background is I'm on my desktop PC running WinXP and had a old low-end laptop which I no longer have, but had enjoyed the portability with.
B008DWG5HE,14,24,The iPad is nice, don't get me wrong.
B008DWG5HE,15,0,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B008DWG5HE,15,1,One complaint is that the screen is VERY bright and I've not found a way to dim it.
B008DWG5HE,15,2,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,15,3,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B008DWG5HE,15,4,We`ve gone from black and white to 12" color TVs all the way to easily available 60" LED TVs....why would I want to revert to a 10" screen to watch movies etc....that`s what my 42" is for.
B008DWG5HE,15,5,The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.
B008DWG5HE,15,6,I really believe this tablet wont last at $500 for too long.The second big problem is the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,7,Thus, unless you are looking directly at a right angle to where the pen is touching the glass, the image on the screen does not appear where you expect it to appear.
B008DWG5HE,15,8,Yes, the iPad has a screen that is a bit more vibrant, but unless they are sitting side by side you will NOT notice the difference.
B008DWG5HE,15,9,With the sun shining directly on the screen, I can read it fine.
B008DWG5HE,15,10,Also, there is a gap between the surface of the glass (where the pen tip touches), and the screen below the glass where the image appears.
B008DWG5HE,15,11,Also, when  viewing dark  movie scenes, the screen appears washed out around the edges, with the upper left corner appearing orangeish, the lower right corner appearing bluish, and a whitish fringe appearing all around the edges.
B008DWG5HE,15,12,It is bright and colors are vibrant.
B008DWG5HE,15,13,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,15,14,I WAS better able to read very fine print on the Asus (probably 4 point type, white against a dark background), otherwise, for all other apps, I saw NO significant difference between the two.
B008DWG5HE,15,15,How do YOU find the brightness (usually adjustable, if auto-brightness does not work well for you), the contrast, the sharpness?4 - Log into your email account and/or create a Gmail account.
B008DWG5HE,15,16,Applying a matt screen protector affects the S-pen's functionality somewhat, making it less sensitive and creating a drag.
B008DWG5HE,15,17,For the naysayers who complain about the screen resolution and compare it to the Retina display on the iPad, my first comment is guess what?
B008DWG5HE,15,18,It'd be great have a glass anti-glare display finish that does not affect the S-pen's functionality.4.
B008DWG5HE,15,19,But movies with dark scenes, which seems to be most movies these days, are difficult to see except in a completely darkened room (all the lights off).
B008DWG5HE,15,20,However, the glossy display reflects badly.
B008DWG5HE,15,21,The display is nice and bright and the unit can be used even outside on a sunny day.
B008DWG5HE,15,22,I will not directly compare this tablet to an iPad because the pros and cons for each platform are dizzying.
B008DWG5HE,15,23,There are articles online about adjusting the sensitivity but evidently I have the only pen that doesn't respond to adjustments.Samsung hasn't been interested in providing solutions to screen sensitivity along with the pen issues.
B008DWG5HE,15,24,Animated features and movies with brightly lit scenes are ok.
B008DWG5HE,16,0,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,16,1,It does NOT have flash player nor can you download it from the app store.
B008DWG5HE,16,2,The problem with all tablets is app support.
B008DWG5HE,16,3,Therefore, this tablet will not run Flash video.
B008DWG5HE,16,4,I was very disapointed when I found out I can'get on Amazon Video, etc.
B008DWG5HE,16,5,I'm on my second book out of a 3 book series using the Kindle app.
B008DWG5HE,16,6,However, if you want to watch videos from any other source, for example; Amazon Prime, facebook videos, yahoo videos, etc. they can't be played due to the Adobe Flash being blocked.
B008DWG5HE,16,7,While downloading apps, the Google Play Store froze on the Asus, never on the Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,16,8,When I got the device I expected to be able to have any 2 apps running at the same time, so I could watch Netflix while using IMDB, etc.  Thus far, I have only found one or two apps from the market that support the split screen function.-
B008DWG5HE,16,9,Even if you install printer share, it is hard to use and not all apps work with it.
B008DWG5HE,16,10,I would like to watch amazon prime videos like I do with my phone.
B008DWG5HE,16,11,It's asking I download Adobe flash player.
B008DWG5HE,16,12,I'm a Prime member and this device does not support Amazon's free down load movies...Amazon's selling page does not mention this shortcoming!!!!
B008DWG5HE,16,13,Flash does not work on this version.
B008DWG5HE,16,14,October 19On the FLASH PLAYER:There are several ways to get around not having flash player.
B008DWG5HE,16,15,I`ve had to download Firefox for Android.
B008DWG5HE,16,16,Great tablet but it does not support flash!
B008DWG5HE,16,17,And, you are constantly getting reminders from Google Play to update all of those pre-installed apps that you never use.
B008DWG5HE,16,18,One of the problems- Every time I clicked on any link/button to install flash, the device would take me to the play store and tell me flash wasn't available.I eventually found an application that requires flash, downloaded it, and let it install flash automatically, thus bypassing all automatic links to the google play store.However, once flash player is installed, it still doesn't work as well as a PC with the sites I frequent (rosetta stone, amazon).
B008DWG5HE,16,19,To my dismay Adobe (the company who makes Flash video software) stopped supporting Flash for android.
B008DWG5HE,16,20,No flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,21,Flash not supported.
B008DWG5HE,16,22,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,16,23,All the time is spent making good apps for the ibad.
B008DWG5HE,16,24,So no websites which use Java can work....and I believe this is on all Android devices.
B008DWG5HE,17,0,if you purchase their products you are on your own after they get your money.
B008DWG5HE,17,1,Verry disappointed!!
B008DWG5HE,17,2,would not have bought knowing this.
B008DWG5HE,17,3,I bought first one, during the trial, it freezes soon, So, I returned it and excanged with new one.
B008DWG5HE,17,4,I expected this product to last for at least a couple of years.
B008DWG5HE,17,5,You could buy a large version of one of those for the same price as this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,17,6,To be honest, the sanctions against the first tab provoked me to buy it.
B008DWG5HE,17,7,So, I decieded returning it as well.
B008DWG5HE,17,8,I honestly would have passed and bought something else.
B008DWG5HE,17,9,I saw the James Franco commercial and immediately decided to buy it.
B008DWG5HE,17,10,My wife uses it all of the time and she is pleased with the replacement.
B008DWG5HE,17,11,It's one thing to crash, and another thing to crash ALL THE TIME and preventing you from using other apps and having a good experience.Save your money.
B008DWG5HE,17,12,So I got my Note 10.1 a few days ago a I`ve been playing with it, both for work and recreation.
B008DWG5HE,17,13,I got mine a week ago as advanced christmas present and im more than pleased with such tablet!
B008DWG5HE,17,14,It not aweful screen but its not what you pay for at $500.
B008DWG5HE,17,15,I'ld say that if I had to do it again, I would have waited a few more months to see if the price came down.
B008DWG5HE,17,16,I tried a "do it yourself repair that did not work and order a new device.
B008DWG5HE,17,17,iPad is a much better device.
B008DWG5HE,17,18,Don't Buy Refurbished from this company.
B008DWG5HE,17,19,I purchased the iPad 2 when it was released and owned that for about 10 months before it fell and the screen cracked.
B008DWG5HE,17,20,First of all, this item has shipped 3 days after I actually placed order.Second, the item was defective!!!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,17,21,Bought this for the wife and perhaps just my poor research and expectations but I would have expected that this would be able to do much of what a windows based tablet would do.
B008DWG5HE,17,22,My point is just this, for $500, which what HIGH END tablets are going for, I would expect a little better.
B008DWG5HE,17,23,However I was not expecting this from seller with high reviews.
B008DWG5HE,17,24,This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device.
B008DWG5HE,18,0,I was able assemble the adopter /battery charger.
B008DWG5HE,18,1,Had one before and the battery died.
B008DWG5HE,18,2,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B008DWG5HE,18,3,The first one wouldn't even turn on!
B008DWG5HE,18,4,It doesn't stop even long enough for me to hold down the power key and turn the device off completely.I have researched everything, and can not find anything on why it is doing this, or how to fix it!
B008DWG5HE,18,5,It still reboots randomly sometimes 3-4 times in a 30 min time frame.
B008DWG5HE,18,6,I have to charge pretty much every other day and at times daily if I use it a lot.
B008DWG5HE,18,7,See how long the battery lasts.
B008DWG5HE,18,8,If you attempt to charge this tablet via your computer, the tablet will show the battery icon as not charging.
B008DWG5HE,18,9,Last week it went into a reboot mode and I could not get it to turn off.
B008DWG5HE,18,10,The shipment received on time.
B008DWG5HE,18,11,But I am hoping the battery has long life.These are my opinions about the Note 10.1 from about a few week long usage.
B008DWG5HE,18,12,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,18,13,Same usage as entry 1) above, except at 30% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 10 hours.
B008DWG5HE,18,14,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,18,15,I tried a "do it yourself repair that did not work and order a new device.
B008DWG5HE,18,16,The non-removable battery is annoying simply because batteries for these mobile devices just don't last more than a couple of years before losing charging capacity.-
B008DWG5HE,18,17,I don't remember having to recharge the iPad the same day regardless of usage.5.
B008DWG5HE,18,18,Battery drain seems faster than iPad.
B008DWG5HE,18,19,If it had 75% of battery remaining when you put it in sleep mode in the evening, it will still have 75% remaining when you turn it on in the morning.
B008DWG5HE,18,20,Boot up and shut down takes about 30 seconds, but there is really no need to do this - you can simply shut the unit down in the sleep mode, in which case it instantly turns off and on.
B008DWG5HE,18,21,It has been doing this off and on for a month/month and half.I researched this tablet vs. the iPad for months, and this tablet came out on top!
B008DWG5HE,18,22,The Package did not have instructions for four loose components shipped (part of adopter or battery charger and some thing else).
B008DWG5HE,18,23,Note 10.1, I got an additional cable... still not cool.Okay, I don't have to charge the Note that often so it is not too bad.
B008DWG5HE,18,24,We can't do anything on it, we can't even get to the home screen without it going nuts.
B008DWG5HE,19,0,Speakers stereo separation is very good but the lower frequency sound is poor.6.
B008DWG5HE,19,1,Cheap plastic.
B008DWG5HE,19,2,However, I keep mine in the Samsung case (sold separately), so the build deficits aren't noticeable.Speakers:Placing stereo speakers at opposite edges of the screen facing forward is a great idea, except the speakers aren't loud enough and have a tinny sound.
B008DWG5HE,19,3,Now you can tell me that its not cheap plastic, that it might even be some super polymer or what ever but to me it felt cheap.
B008DWG5HE,19,4,I cant say I want to keep it though because of a couple of problems that make this tablet a joke.The most significant is the quality of materials.
B008DWG5HE,19,5,The audio became occasionally inoperative and the headphone jack would crackle when using my ear buds.
B008DWG5HE,19,6,Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine.
B008DWG5HE,19,7,I find myself having to use headphones when watching videos.
B008DWG5HE,19,8,I tried other buds thinking there might be an issue with them but it was a consistent result, especially when turning the jack in the port.
B008DWG5HE,19,9,The plastic back does flex a little under your hands, and there is a creaking noise when you push down on the edges of the screen, or apply a slight twisting motion to the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,19,10,It is a pretty descent tablet, I will say that.
B008DWG5HE,19,11,Go online, and look at pictures or videos of the material up close and you will see that it looks soooo cheap.
B008DWG5HE,19,12,The plastic actually bends and creaks when you press it down.
B008DWG5HE,19,13,Other than that, it seems to be put together tightly, and it looks fine, it's just not as good as you would expect from a high end tablet.
B008DWG5HE,19,14,Also, if you never went a store, just saw the pictures online, you would think that it actually was made of some solid metal.
B008DWG5HE,19,15,Also, you have to cover up the speakers with tape when you are spraying down the screen with glass cleaning fluid to keep from getting the fluid in the speakers.Price:Too high.
B008DWG5HE,19,16,I sincerely believe they could have built a better tablet than this (at the price they are asking for it).
B008DWG5HE,19,17,I have to charge pretty much every other day and at times daily if I use it a lot.
B008DWG5HE,19,18,Not enough to slow you down, just enough to be visually noticeable.
B008DWG5HE,19,19,But the two things that are holding it back, in my opinion is the cheap build quality and screen res.
B008DWG5HE,19,20,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,19,21,I really believe this tablet wont last at $500 for too long.The second big problem is the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,19,22,The back has that brushed metal texture look, so you could tell that the designers were going for that, deceptive as it might be.
B008DWG5HE,19,23,I sometimes plug in some computer speakers and listen to music at work through it.
B008DWG5HE,19,24,And the sound quality and volume were excellent.
B008DWG5HE,20,0,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,1,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,2,It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something.
B008DWG5HE,20,3,While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.
B008DWG5HE,20,4,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,5,With the screen facing away from the sun, however, reflections of myself and the scenery behind me dominate the screen and make it difficult to read the text.
B008DWG5HE,20,6,The lack of that last star is for slight difference in screen quality.
B008DWG5HE,20,7,Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,8,Video chatting works great as well.
B008DWG5HE,20,9,My opinion remains unchanged, SAVE your money and buy the Samsung Galaxy 2 tablet unless you will use the stylus and autofocus rear camera of the Samsung Galaxy NOTE.
B008DWG5HE,20,10,Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as "floaters" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,11,It has the weaknesses of most regular range digital cameras with low light, indoors, and motion.
B008DWG5HE,20,12,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B008DWG5HE,20,13,It still reboots randomly sometimes 3-4 times in a 30 min time frame.
B008DWG5HE,20,14,The stylus does respond pretty good and the painting experience is good but it seems to falter a bit with detail or smaller lines.
B008DWG5HE,20,15,Since I was focused strictly on digital drawing and painting, the stylus use and sensitivity were important.
B008DWG5HE,20,16,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,20,17,The only reason I purchased this tablet was to be able to use it to digitally draw and paint.
B008DWG5HE,20,18,Does the auto spelling correct work well for you?
B008DWG5HE,20,19,I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.
B008DWG5HE,20,20,It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly.
B008DWG5HE,20,21,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,20,22,Too bad they don't work in multiscreen because this is a samsung hack.
B008DWG5HE,20,23,Purchased Just for Drawing/ Sketching.
B008DWG5HE,20,24,I gave it 4 stars because I can draw pretty well with it.
B008DWG5HE,21,0,It's very responsive and sublime to touch.
B008DWG5HE,21,1,The old tablet had its issues with freezing up after the last update along with not enough ram.
B008DWG5HE,21,2,Very frustrating to use.
B008DWG5HE,21,3,But the technology is not there yet.I use chrome browser on this and it seems to freeze a lot on it.May25th- Updated to 3 star after using it some more.
B008DWG5HE,21,4,The UI seems okay and pretty responsive so no complaints there.
B008DWG5HE,21,5,In the end, I think it was samsung that ruined it for me and I just feel this tablet is a little gimmicky.For the money I expected a better app experience from samsung.
B008DWG5HE,21,6,I could easily have rated five stars only I have a habit of not awarding full scores since nothing is inherently perfect.
B008DWG5HE,21,7,Has some issues.
B008DWG5HE,21,8,slow wifi on the note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,21,9,As I mentioned previously, if you want that better slate now, look at the Samsung Series 7 Slate.
B008DWG5HE,21,10,I think I was down to 77% or something so battery life should be fine.
B008DWG5HE,21,11,In walking around in Bestbuy I see more responsive tablets.
B008DWG5HE,21,12,Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.
B008DWG5HE,21,13,The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time.
B008DWG5HE,21,14,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,21,15,And, you are constantly getting reminders from Google Play to update all of those pre-installed apps that you never use.
B008DWG5HE,21,16,The note 2 10.1 has twice the ram as the tab model.
B008DWG5HE,21,17,If you are playing a game the battery goes low way to quick.
B008DWG5HE,21,18,The OS was fast at first but as I added Apps it got slower and choppy.
B008DWG5HE,21,19,I would have rated this 5 stars if it wasn't slow.
B008DWG5HE,21,20,And I confess, I bought one of the first iPads when they came out, have upgraded every time since so am pretty much married to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,21,21,Slow OS updating.
B008DWG5HE,21,22,I need a few apps that work, not 20 where half of them are crap and the other half half work with one or two stand outs.
B008DWG5HE,21,23,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,21,24,Great piece of hardware, but lacks software.
B008DWG5HE,22,0,SD card slot usles.
B008DWG5HE,22,1,I bought this 16G tablet and installed a 16G SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,2,The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,3,While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-
B008DWG5HE,22,4,I bought this partly because of the sd card slot.According to Samsung you can't run apps from it and they can't store their data there.
B008DWG5HE,22,5,updates not in the cards.
B008DWG5HE,22,6,Warning... Samsung tablets and phones do not allow you to store apps in the SD memory.
B008DWG5HE,22,7,SD card not properly used.
B008DWG5HE,22,8,You cannot use Apps2SD, for example, to move apps from the Note's built-in memory to an external SD card without *rooting the device.
B008DWG5HE,22,9,So if you want the note go for 32GB or you'll be sorry.
B008DWG5HE,22,10,Apps can only install on default memory*.
B008DWG5HE,22,11,This was a major concern as the tablet could accept a 64gb micro SD card for expansion and would lend itself to installing more apps in the future.
B008DWG5HE,22,12,I used 10% of the available 11 GB for only 4issues of PC world's enhanced additions.
B008DWG5HE,22,13,I have a cheap 7" non Samsung tablet and I can move apps as I want.
B008DWG5HE,22,14,I liked having the expansion capabilities with micro SD card slot but the proprietary dock/USB port was a pain.
B008DWG5HE,22,15,I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.
B008DWG5HE,22,16,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,17,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,18,The OS was fast at first but as I added Apps it got slower and choppy.
B008DWG5HE,22,19,I did a hard set twice and it came back as fast as new but it would slow again as I added Apps back in.
B008DWG5HE,22,20,All you can put there are pictures, music, etc.
B008DWG5HE,22,21,The Android system permits it.
B008DWG5HE,22,22,you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory?
B008DWG5HE,22,23,Slow OS updating.
B008DWG5HE,22,24,If I could put my apps (realcalc or some other graphing calculator) down there then maybe, but really, if I could turn off the mini app option I would.
B008DWG5HE,23,0,I really liked note 10.1 until I connected to wifi.
B008DWG5HE,23,1,slow wifi on the note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,23,2,I don't really need wifi that much and use the note to take notes, and would rather not have to back everything up again, so I'm going without the wifi.
B008DWG5HE,23,3,WiFi suddenly doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,23,4,Pleade do a google search for slow wifi on the note 10.1.Tim
B008DWG5HE,23,5,It says in the settings that it's connected to the school network, but when I try to access the internet, it doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,23,6,It still reboots randomly sometimes 3-4 times in a 30 min time frame.
B008DWG5HE,23,7,I would have rated this 5 stars if it wasn't slow.
B008DWG5HE,23,8,This would be ok if it fixed the problem but it didn't.
B008DWG5HE,23,9,Also the wireless connectivity to the dongle is fragile.
B008DWG5HE,23,10,It is useful but for those problems.
B008DWG5HE,23,11,My girlfriend has taken video footage with her phone (an Apple phone, that she has never had a problem with she says) of this device freaking out for minutes on end.
B008DWG5HE,23,12,Keeps freezing and then randomly rebooting.
B008DWG5HE,23,13,SPASTIC OS, intermittent wi-fi disconnection.
B008DWG5HE,23,14,MAJOR peeve:  This is a mobile device which most people are going to use as a web device.
B008DWG5HE,23,15,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,23,16,I thought that something that I had installed was causing the problem.
B008DWG5HE,23,17,The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router.
B008DWG5HE,23,18,Again, side by side, the Samsung Galaxy 2 tablet reported a STRONG wi-fi signal, the Asus TF700 reported only a GOOD signal.
B008DWG5HE,23,19,Secondly, given that this is an android device, one would expect google products to work seamlessly with it....nope...Chrome is quite frankly rubbish on this device.
B008DWG5HE,23,20,I've had this for a couple of months, but from about 2 weeks ago, the wifi stopped working on my school network.
B008DWG5HE,23,21,The Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet maintains strong wi-fi connection both anywhere in my home and at the school where I attend classes.
B008DWG5HE,23,22,I believe that Asus must work out a lot of bugs in their infinity before it is worthwhile!Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,23,23,The auto-brightness control also appeared not to work or not to work properly.
B008DWG5HE,23,24,I opened several apps, one at a time, simultaneously on BOTH tablets and examined them under exactly the same lighting and circumstances.
B008DWG5HE,24,0,The keyboard does not work well.
B008DWG5HE,24,1,We can't do anything on it, we can't even get to the home screen without it going nuts.
B008DWG5HE,24,2,Everything on screen is still visible, just no touch function at all with either finger or pen.
B008DWG5HE,24,3,You can work with any bluetooth keyboard as I understand it, though I've not done so yet.
B008DWG5HE,24,4,However, the potentiometer was very sensitive and at first I over adjusted so that the pen was writing on the screen when it wasn't even touching the glass.
B008DWG5HE,24,5,The continual problems I have had with the note is that the left side of the touch screen lacks sensitivity when using the virtual keyboard.
B008DWG5HE,24,6,To get it to work you have to detach the tablet from the cover then move it.
B008DWG5HE,24,7,Every time you pause, and start writing again, it starts a new text box.
B008DWG5HE,24,8,The only thing that I was mad abt is.that the sticker on the box was opened but the product itself seemed un touched.
B008DWG5HE,24,9,I discovered that writing with the pen is very different, and considerably more difficult, than writing with a pen on paper.
B008DWG5HE,24,10,Missing parts not once, not twice but 3 times, and all boxes were open.
B008DWG5HE,24,11,You resume writing, "accuracy".
B008DWG5HE,24,12,Until I discovered the "Null Keyboard" app, I wasn't happy with the interaction between the two devices because the on-screen keyboard would pop up whenever I tapped a text box.
B008DWG5HE,24,13,Well, I have been able to use it effectively in this manner, but I have found that the S-pen is rather tricky to use and takes some getting used to.The S-pen:The first thing I noticed when trying to write with the s-pen out of the box is that I had to press too hard on the screen to make it write.
B008DWG5HE,24,14,The screen is slippery, so more control over pen movement is required than when writing on paper.
B008DWG5HE,24,15,Also, there is a slight lag time between the pen motion and the appearance of the image on the screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,16,Lastly, even with touch input turned off, so only the pen will write on the page, the motion of the side of your hand on the screen will occasionally cause the page to move around or inadvertently zoom in or out.These problems were enough to cause me to consider returning the tablet when I first tried it.
B008DWG5HE,24,17,For example, I would like to hand write a whole page and then let the app convert the whole page to text at once.
B008DWG5HE,24,18,This has been a five-star product until...Today, I just tried pulling out the pen and the touch panel seemed to go dead.
B008DWG5HE,24,19,If you hand write a few words and then pause, the handwriting is converted to text.
B008DWG5HE,24,20,I have changed tips from the rubber tip to the hard nylon type tip due to the rubber tip wearing out.
B008DWG5HE,24,21,The touchscreen keyboard goes nuts with ghost typing; it opens and closes programs, goes from one page to the other, and has acutally changed settings as well.
B008DWG5HE,24,22,But now, I notice that after the tablet enters sleep and waking it up with the power button, the touch panel is dead without even pulling the pen out to cause the dilemma.So I force restart now, and go into options to do a factory reset.
B008DWG5HE,24,23,I found that I have to write very carefully and legibly (which is difficult with the s-pen) for the hand-writing-to-text function to work, and once the text has been inserted into the note, it is difficult to edit.
B008DWG5HE,24,24,This is a pain when your typing and find out autocorrect won't predict words correctly because it didn't sense you touching the letter selected.Moving on to the S pen.
B008DWG5HE,25,0,That is one thing the ipad seems to have over Samsung is the devices seem a little more resistant to trauma.
B008DWG5HE,25,1,Wish I would have gone with the I-Pad.
B008DWG5HE,25,2,iPad is a much better device.
B008DWG5HE,25,3,This device runs Android 2.3.
B008DWG5HE,25,4,This is a great device, however I feel Samsung was deceptive in that there was NO mention of it's provided App's only printing to Samsung printers.
B008DWG5HE,25,5,I need to do more than a few things at once and I need all of my features at the same time.
B008DWG5HE,25,6,Samsung blames the printer that has no problems with other android or even a ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,7,This shortcoming is more an issue with Android.
B008DWG5HE,25,8,So no websites which use Java can work....and I believe this is on all Android devices.
B008DWG5HE,25,9,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,25,10,Too bad they don't work in multiscreen because this is a samsung hack.
B008DWG5HE,25,11,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,25,12,I wud like there to be more apps for the S pen since I find the Snote kind of limited when it comes about doing diagrams and flowcharts (if anyone can recommend me an app to do so id be thankful) Another thing is that i dont know how to save the snotes i make when open it from the mini apps, say im using the kindle app reading and i want to take some notes then i close the snote and there s no way i can re open it again with what i had written down before.
B008DWG5HE,25,13,I have purchased so many things through amazon over the last 7 or so years but this is my first review.
B008DWG5HE,25,14,The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time.
B008DWG5HE,25,15,In the end, I think it was samsung that ruined it for me and I just feel this tablet is a little gimmicky.For the money I expected a better app experience from samsung.
B008DWG5HE,25,16,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B008DWG5HE,25,17,And I confess, I bought one of the first iPads when they came out, have upgraded every time since so am pretty much married to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,25,18,I didn't buy this from Amazon, but feel I should make a coment.
B008DWG5HE,25,19,Good device....needs a few improvements.
B008DWG5HE,25,20,Otherwise it's an excellent Android device.
B008DWG5HE,25,21,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B008DWG5HE,25,22,multiscreen works great, and hopefully Samsung will add more apps that are compatible with it.Personally,
B008DWG5HE,25,23,If I could put my apps (realcalc or some other graphing calculator) down there then maybe, but really, if I could turn off the mini app option I would.
B008DWG5HE,25,24,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,26,0,Minus another for that port being for a proprietary power plug.
B008DWG5HE,26,1,Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such.
B008DWG5HE,26,2,However the lack of a HDMI or USB port hampers its versatility.
B008DWG5HE,26,3,I will, however, note that the utter lack of external ports is disappointing.
B008DWG5HE,26,4,I like the Lightning port better than the old 30 pin connector but still, proprietary?
B008DWG5HE,26,5,To plug a flash/thumb drive directly into the Note 10.1 you have to buy a adapter.
B008DWG5HE,26,6,Note 10.1, I got an additional cable... still not cool.Okay, I don't have to charge the Note that often so it is not too bad.
B008DWG5HE,26,7,The cable gets mashed on the bottom of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,26,8,There should be a micro or mini USB port on the left side of the device (in landscape) so that it can be used in landscape or portrait while propped up on a stand.
B008DWG5HE,26,9,Very nice performance, disappointed by the lack of ports.
B008DWG5HE,26,10,Also the wireless connectivity to the dongle is fragile.
B008DWG5HE,26,11,Drawing lines, other shapes, handwriting, formula recognition and all are awesome.Cons - No USB or HDMI port.
B008DWG5HE,26,12,For anyone who hates typing or finds it slow, this will be worth it's weight in gold.Has a mini usb port.
B008DWG5HE,26,13,I love the USB connectivity, but the location is terrible.
B008DWG5HE,26,14,But unless Samsung starts making more pragmatic devices, I'm going to look somewhere else.In short - minus one star for only one port.
B008DWG5HE,26,15,I've found I don't use the extra ports all that much so it isn't a big deal for me.
B008DWG5HE,26,16,In some cases (depending on the amount of juice it gets from the USB port) it will actually charge, but so slowly that it's practically useless.
B008DWG5HE,26,17,My main contention hardware-wise is the location of the port, and the fact that it`s a Samsung-proprietary rip off of the iPad port, plus its location.
B008DWG5HE,26,18,For the connection to be on the bottom is COMPLETELY impractical, as you have to lie the unit down to use any of your connections.
B008DWG5HE,26,19,Proprietary 30-pin cable and non-removable battery.
B008DWG5HE,26,20,You can work with any bluetooth keyboard as I understand it, though I've not done so yet.
B008DWG5HE,26,21,Our 4-year-old watches videos on this and, with the case we have, it's not possible to stand the tablet up for watching while it's plugged in.
B008DWG5HE,26,22,I ended up buying an iPad 4 and my complaint is the same for Apple.
B008DWG5HE,26,23,Proprietary interface to charge, seriously not cool.
B008DWG5HE,26,24,There are only 2 small electronics using proprietary interface in my possession - Cowon J3 and Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,27,0,I have had it for a week now, and still no crash.
B008DWG5HE,27,1,A month in, it keeps crashing.
B008DWG5HE,27,2,It took 2 weeks for repairs.
B008DWG5HE,27,3,Even when I am doing so many things on this.
B008DWG5HE,27,4,If the underlying operating system is not designed with the ability to do a thing then you can be assured you will not be completely happy with a hack like this.
B008DWG5HE,27,5,It still reboots randomly sometimes 3-4 times in a 30 min time frame.
B008DWG5HE,27,6,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,27,7,Last week it went into a reboot mode and I could not get it to turn off.
B008DWG5HE,27,8,I'm sure time will cure that issue.
B008DWG5HE,27,9,Keeps freezing and then randomly rebooting.
B008DWG5HE,27,10,6 months later there are issues.
B008DWG5HE,27,11,If you are expecting to use it to take notes, be prepared to be disappointed.
B008DWG5HE,27,12,The lack of that last star is for slight difference in screen quality.
B008DWG5HE,27,13,The problem with all tablets is app support.
B008DWG5HE,27,14,I bought this before I went on Vacation last summer, So I have now owned it for about 9 months.
B008DWG5HE,27,15,Bought this for the wife and perhaps just my poor research and expectations but I would have expected that this would be able to do much of what a windows based tablet would do.
B008DWG5HE,27,16,I'm fairly disappointed, because for the past week, I was quite happy with it.
B008DWG5HE,27,17,I have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it.
B008DWG5HE,27,18,It's one thing to crash, and another thing to crash ALL THE TIME and preventing you from using other apps and having a good experience.Save your money.
B008DWG5HE,27,19,I guess that isn't too bad, so long as it works.
B008DWG5HE,27,20,The Android system permits it.
B008DWG5HE,27,21,WiFi suddenly doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,27,22,Turns out that once I set the GMT to Eastern Std Time, the weather app sync'ed just fine.
B008DWG5HE,27,23,My wife uses it all of the time and she is pleased with the replacement.
B008DWG5HE,27,24,slow wifi on the note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,28,0,According to Samsung customer service it wont be unblocked any time soon.
B008DWG5HE,28,1,Tried discussing with Samsung support and they were no help.
B008DWG5HE,28,2,Samsung customer service is horrible.
B008DWG5HE,28,3,Poor Inspection process and Bypassing Customer Service responsbility.
B008DWG5HE,28,4,It took 2 weeks for repairs.
B008DWG5HE,28,5,The shipment received on time.
B008DWG5HE,28,6,Samsung's customer service experience.
B008DWG5HE,28,7,Called customer support and they had me reset it to factory settings.
B008DWG5HE,28,8,They said to return it back to sam's club, sam's club says to contact Samsung instead.
B008DWG5HE,28,9,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,28,10,People talk about having to call into Samsung support over and over and over again, the flippant attitudes of the support people, and the unwillingness for Samsung to stand behind their product and provide a new unit when it's obvious a unit is defective.For the complete lack of customer support and poor quality/design, I will not be buying ANY Samsung tablet.
B008DWG5HE,28,11,First of all, this item has shipped 3 days after I actually placed order.Second, the item was defective!!!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,28,12,If Amazon is selling a product, I expect Amazon customer service to provide the required service.
B008DWG5HE,28,13,Made my purchase in February and have had nothing but problems.
B008DWG5HE,28,14,I wanted to send this unit back to Amazon.com but Samsung has held up the progress because of the adapter and my 30 days  return warranty has expired with Amazon.I would have never had this problem with Apple.
B008DWG5HE,28,15,This would be ok if it fixed the problem but it didn't.
B008DWG5HE,28,16,Same problem still.
B008DWG5HE,28,17,If I bought the product from Amazon, why do I have to contact the maufacturer's Website.
B008DWG5HE,28,18,I tried a "do it yourself repair that did not work and order a new device.
B008DWG5HE,28,19,Immediately notified Amazon.
B008DWG5HE,28,20,So, I decieded returning it as well.
B008DWG5HE,28,21,Amazon responded promptly to contact Samsung Website.
B008DWG5HE,28,22,contacted and was told that its new and not refurbished item.
B008DWG5HE,28,23,I just wanted to try this as a last ditch effort, but still dead touch panel problems.I'm convinced to send it back to Amazon now.
B008DWG5HE,28,24,Worst customer service I've ever experienced from a conglomerate electronics company.I ordered the Galaxy note 10.1 on 3/23/13 shipping and services from Amazon.com was  Superb!!!When I received my unit there was some issues so I opted to send it to Samsung for service, turns out the adapter was faulty and the battery inside of the galaxy note needed to be replaced.
B008DWG5HE,29,0,However lately when he moves it a certain way the screen gets lines across it and is unreadable.
B008DWG5HE,29,1,If he moves it when that happens, the screen will straighten out for a bit and then go back to lines.
B008DWG5HE,29,2,Lots and lots of problems !!!!
B008DWG5HE,29,3,Instead, if you want to make a window disappear from the screen, you have to close the app appearing in the window.
B008DWG5HE,29,4,Switching from one window to another merely requires a tap on the window you want to work in.
B008DWG5HE,29,5,I am also disappointed that you can't shrink windows down to a single bar at the bottom of the screen like you can in Microsoft Windows for PC.
B008DWG5HE,29,6,I will update as I get more with my Note in the future.FYI: I am an expert in windows and linux.
B008DWG5HE,29,7,Screen rotation is a bit too sensitive.
B008DWG5HE,29,8,Slow OS updating.
B008DWG5HE,29,9,I have yet to see it freeze or get into a state that requires a reboot.
B008DWG5HE,29,10,Great Hardware.
B008DWG5HE,29,11,I do not care for mac and i things, do not agree with the rotten fruit company's policy (I am also fluent in mac os 7, 8, 9, and OSX).
B008DWG5HE,29,12,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,29,13,I found I had to switch it off more frequently than I had to with the iPad.7.
B008DWG5HE,29,14,Keeps freezing and then randomly rebooting.
B008DWG5HE,29,15,It still reboots randomly sometimes 3-4 times in a 30 min time frame.
B008DWG5HE,29,16,You then have to tap the space button.
B008DWG5HE,29,17,It freezes too often.
B008DWG5HE,29,18,It freezes too often.
B008DWG5HE,29,19,Has some issues.
B008DWG5HE,29,20,Samsung blames the printer that has no problems with other android or even a ipad.
B008DWG5HE,29,21,but it occurs the same problem.
B008DWG5HE,29,22,The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time.
B008DWG5HE,29,23,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,29,24,And I would like to be able to select a portion of a handwritten page and convert just that portion to text.Samsung, are you listening?!?

B00CYQPM42,0,23,I have the Kindle fire and really  liked it.
B00CYQPM42,0,24,love love love it.
B00CYQPM42,1,0,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,1,1,Not enough apps.
B00CYQPM42,1,2,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,1,3,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,1,4,my daughter really wanted the furby boom app for her furby and we found out later it was only available through google play..
B00CYQPM42,1,5,not playing videos.
B00CYQPM42,1,6,Can't play POGO games on it so it is worthless to me.
B00CYQPM42,1,7,They do not play.
B00CYQPM42,1,8,I have found many useful lifestyle apps (food diaries, calorie counters, etc).
B00CYQPM42,1,9,The only downfall is no Google play store access.
B00CYQPM42,1,10,There are more apps being added constantly and so far I've found everything I've needed in the app store.
B00CYQPM42,1,11,Right now, there are about 1 million Android apps, and on the Kindle you can only get about 10% of them.I know some people think "10% of 1 million apps is still 100,000 apps which is plenty."
B00CYQPM42,1,12,With an Android device, you can access the Amazon Android store, but with a Kindle Fire, you cannot access the Google Play store.
B00CYQPM42,1,13,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,1,14,All it needs is a suitable app store.
B00CYQPM42,1,15,App store is awful!!!!!!!!!!
B00CYQPM42,1,16,Amazon you need to fix your App store
B00CYQPM42,1,17,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,1,18,So I can't categorize or organize my apps, other than just dragging them everywhere?
B00CYQPM42,1,19,My favorite game app doesn't make them for the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,1,20,It was right there for free in the app store and works beautifully on this device.
B00CYQPM42,1,21,Watching movies works for me - the 7" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.
B00CYQPM42,1,22,Similarly, if you love browsing Google Play for apps to play on your Samsung Galaxy phone, you're likely to be disappointed in the section available on Amazon (although, as I note above, most of the Google Play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet).
B00CYQPM42,1,23,Works great.
B00CYQPM42,1,24,But if you want a tablet that has unrestricted access to every app out there, you'll have to look elsewhere.
B00CYQPM42,2,0,Got it at a great price
B00CYQPM42,2,1,Great for the price.
B00CYQPM42,2,2,Great!
B00CYQPM42,2,3,Happy with it, especially for the price.
B00CYQPM42,2,4,GREAT PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,2,5,What a great product.
B00CYQPM42,2,6,This is a great device at an exceptional price.
B00CYQPM42,2,7,Not enough for the price.
B00CYQPM42,2,8,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,2,9,A great little tablet.
B00CYQPM42,2,10,It looks great too.
B00CYQPM42,2,11,Great.
B00CYQPM42,2,12,Love It!! What a great device!!
B00CYQPM42,2,13,Great value!
B00CYQPM42,2,14,HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY.
B00CYQPM42,2,15,Love Love Love.
B00CYQPM42,2,16,great gift.
B00CYQPM42,2,17,The best part for me is I got them at a fantastic price on Cyber-Monday!!!!! :)
B00CYQPM42,2,18,I have a Note 10.1 but I bought a kindle for my wife.
B00CYQPM42,2,19,This was bought for my daughter but her mother and I both love it too.
B00CYQPM42,2,20,Good Product!
B00CYQPM42,2,21,I highly recommend this tablet as a best buy of exceptional quality.
B00CYQPM42,2,22,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,2,23,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,2,24,What a joy.The best thing about the product is the price, it isn't cheap, but it isn't something that takes a fortune to buy.
B00CYQPM42,3,0,Battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,1,aweful battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,2,battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,3,Already went threw the hints on how to save battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,4,Battery life is pretty good.
B00CYQPM42,3,5,battery doesn't last.
B00CYQPM42,3,6,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,7,Everything works great, but the battery life is not nearly as long as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,3,8,Battery life is great so far.-
B00CYQPM42,3,9,Seems battery doesn't last as long as first kindle.
B00CYQPM42,3,10,Battery life is not as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,3,11,Not to happy with the battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,12,Battery life is ok - probably need to recharge every other day with normal use.
B00CYQPM42,3,13,Really good.
B00CYQPM42,3,14,Light weightBattery life is over 10 hours.
B00CYQPM42,3,15,The battery life is ok, but not as good as my larger iPad by far.
B00CYQPM42,3,16,My previous kindle charged quickly even in use and had an amazing battery life!
B00CYQPM42,3,17,Nice, but does not hold a charge long enough.
B00CYQPM42,3,18,Have to charge it almost every day.
B00CYQPM42,3,19,So far I can use my Kindle for two full days and not have my battery run down.
B00CYQPM42,3,20,Only one tiny problem is the battery not last too long, 6-7 hours approx.
B00CYQPM42,3,21,The battery life is not as good as last year's model.
B00CYQPM42,3,22,What is sucking up so much battery?
B00CYQPM42,3,23,I expected the battery to last much longer.
B00CYQPM42,3,24,IT can hold your life while providing some really great entertainment.
B00CYQPM42,4,0,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,1,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,4,2,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,4,3,The sound is also much better and louder.
B00CYQPM42,4,4,The screen is fantastic and the speakers produce great sound that is fairly loud.
B00CYQPM42,4,5,The sound quality is also top notch.
B00CYQPM42,4,6,Sound is really good (not home theater quality or anything) but better than any phone I've heard.
B00CYQPM42,4,7,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,4,8,The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.
B00CYQPM42,4,9,found the speakers to have decent sound.
B00CYQPM42,4,10,This feels really good in your hand and the screen is BEAUTIFUL.
B00CYQPM42,4,11,the audio books sound very good
B00CYQPM42,4,12,The sound while listening to audiobooks and movies is very good.
B00CYQPM42,4,13,- I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers.
B00CYQPM42,4,14,I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it.
B00CYQPM42,4,15,It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder.
B00CYQPM42,4,16,Very nice display and a high quality tablet in general.
B00CYQPM42,4,17,better picture and the sound is amazing!
B00CYQPM42,4,18,The screen resolution is fantastic.
B00CYQPM42,4,19,Surround sound is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,4,20,very nice apps, the resolution and sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,21,This works better than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,4,22,sound is phenomenal, especially for such a little device.
B00CYQPM42,4,23,In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough.
B00CYQPM42,4,24,awesome better than expected.
B00CYQPM42,5,0,that isn't really a camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,1,Very Clear Screen.
B00CYQPM42,5,2,I did not like the way the camera was.
B00CYQPM42,5,3,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,4,Picture is clear, color is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,5,It could only be more perfect if it had a front facing camera!
B00CYQPM42,5,6,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,7,I also don't like the front only camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,8,The picture quality is absurd.
B00CYQPM42,5,9,Clear picture, quality sound.
B00CYQPM42,5,10,My only love about it is the camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,11,Very easy to use and the picture quality is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,5,12,Image is very good.
B00CYQPM42,5,13,VERY GOOD! Love this thing...........except the camera is on the WRONG side.
B00CYQPM42,5,14,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,5,15,Works great.
B00CYQPM42,5,16,It's such a great picture that I had trouble focusing on the movie because I was in awe over how clear and sharp the image on the screen was.
B00CYQPM42,5,17,It has a great screen, it's lightweight, and the price is right.
B00CYQPM42,5,18,I've never had the previous iterations, but I have to say it's pretty darn good.
B00CYQPM42,5,19,Wrong, unless you enjoy taking pictures of yourself!
B00CYQPM42,5,20,The camera could be a little better, but very nice to be able to Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,21,don't need a picture of my ugly mug looking at my kindle.
B00CYQPM42,5,22,The picture is awesome, it's super fast and it's just so pretty.
B00CYQPM42,5,23,Very good better than what a t I expected.The only thing is the camera it only have front and not back.But I guess that's why it have the kindle hdx8.9 cause that have both.
B00CYQPM42,5,24,Looks great and the image is fantastic.
B00CYQPM42,6,0,Fast, very fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,1,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,6,2,The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD.
B00CYQPM42,6,3,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,6,4,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,6,5,This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class.
B00CYQPM42,6,6,I like how much faster the processor and Wi-Fi are too!
B00CYQPM42,6,7,The processor is amazingly fast and the graphics engine is top of the line.
B00CYQPM42,6,8,The screen on the HDX is amazing.
B00CYQPM42,6,9,It's very light and easy to handle.
B00CYQPM42,6,10,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,6,11,Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.
B00CYQPM42,6,12,The processor, it is very fast and loads pages quickly, and the 2 gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance.2.
B00CYQPM42,6,13,But all in all, if you like thin, fast it is great.
B00CYQPM42,6,14,Great tablet!
B00CYQPM42,6,15,Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One.
B00CYQPM42,6,16,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,6,17,The only thing is that the HDX has a different look for the Android Operating System which is actually very nice.
B00CYQPM42,6,18,The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory.
B00CYQPM42,6,19,Compared to a nexus 7 which is the same price, the HDX seems to have a slower processor.
B00CYQPM42,6,20,The speed blew me away!
B00CYQPM42,6,21,Some apps I really enjoy on my android nexus 5 I can't get on the HDX without sideloading.
B00CYQPM42,6,22,The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi.
B00CYQPM42,6,23,It is very fast and responsive, and everything is easily accessible with responsive swipes.
B00CYQPM42,6,24,Great resolution.
B00CYQPM42,7,0,However, this tablet is so much faster and with the 64 GB of storage I can do so much more.
B00CYQPM42,7,1,The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB.
B00CYQPM42,7,2,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,7,3,No mutlitasking, need QNX blackberry or Palm Pre cards layout.
B00CYQPM42,7,4,Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover.
B00CYQPM42,7,5,MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229.
B00CYQPM42,7,6,vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video.
B00CYQPM42,7,7,Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB
B00CYQPM42,7,8,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,7,9,64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB.
B00CYQPM42,7,10,Very nice tablet.
B00CYQPM42,7,11,Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space.
B00CYQPM42,7,12,In this day and age, a table ought to have a Micro SD memory card slot for expansion, and an HDMI connector - ESPECIALLY a media tablet like these!
B00CYQPM42,7,13,GB) of storage per hour.
B00CYQPM42,7,14,Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality.
B00CYQPM42,7,15,This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,7,16,About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download.
B00CYQPM42,7,17,This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size.
B00CYQPM42,7,18,If you're not sold on the reigning king of the tablet space, this is a good option for most users.
B00CYQPM42,7,19,So multiply the hours above by 5 to get an estimate of the maximum number of hours of SD videos you can download.
B00CYQPM42,7,20,For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL
B00CYQPM42,7,21,Love the cloud for storage for my pictures so I can show off my grandkids any time.
B00CYQPM42,7,22,To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40.
B00CYQPM42,7,23,I realize that other HD videos may be a little more or less GB per hour, but using 1.7 GB per hour as a rough guide, here is the maximum amount of HD video you can download:16GB  (10.9GB available) - 6.4 hours32GB  (25.1GB available) - 14.7 hours64GB  (53.7GB available) - 31.5 hoursThe worst standard definition videos I found took up 330MB (which is .33
B00CYQPM42,7,24,To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80.
B00CYQPM42,8,0,Love It!! What a great device!!
B00CYQPM42,8,1,Good device.
B00CYQPM42,8,2,Web cripple.
B00CYQPM42,8,3,Great for watching movies and surfing the web.
B00CYQPM42,8,4,I know they are working on it , but not fixed yet.
B00CYQPM42,8,5,However, the main problem is keeping all those books intact and with you at all times.
B00CYQPM42,8,6,I am having problems with the WiFi hookup on occasion, but I'm sure there is an explanation for it.
B00CYQPM42,8,7,I do however have problems reading and watching movies while out in the sun.
B00CYQPM42,8,8,Regardless if your looking for something to watch Netflix on, read books, and surf the web it's excellent.
B00CYQPM42,8,9,It's easy to use and provides a high-quality experience for reading e-Books, browsing the Internet and watching video.
B00CYQPM42,8,10,Email, Internet and books...what more does a girl need working on the road!
B00CYQPM42,8,11,I found it very easy to connect to the Wi-Fi in each hotel we stayed at.
B00CYQPM42,8,12,It works very well for music, reading docucuments and general web page browsing mhm habit video watching I is quite unreliable.
B00CYQPM42,8,13,LOVE this device!
B00CYQPM42,8,14,I did have a problem with it not reading books I had already purchased (DRM problem).
B00CYQPM42,8,15,I haven't found it to be annoying at all and shouldn't be a deal-breaker.I use the device for reading of books and magazines, watching movies and television shows, playing games, e-mail and light surfing of the web.
B00CYQPM42,8,16,Most amazing device I've ever owned!
B00CYQPM42,8,17,Movies look great, games look great, photos and games look great.
B00CYQPM42,8,18,I mean c'mon, reading from the book is what it's all about.
B00CYQPM42,8,19,I read and write email, surf the web, read and listen to books and watch videos.
B00CYQPM42,8,20,Have a decently fast connection?
B00CYQPM42,8,21,Good browser.
B00CYQPM42,8,22,I watch all my shows on it!! Internet speed is even faster than my laptop!! Love that you can get email & there are plenty of free apps that I use!!
B00CYQPM42,8,23,This is a great device at an exceptional price.
B00CYQPM42,8,24,Very fast with quick access to the Internet.
B00CYQPM42,9,0,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,9,1,the screen is clear.
B00CYQPM42,9,2,The unit has a lovely display, it's responsive and a great overall tablet.
B00CYQPM42,9,3,Great tablet, but again the 7" screen doesn't cut it.
B00CYQPM42,9,4,I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).
B00CYQPM42,9,5,Like HDX very much and wish a touch cover like keyboard case to make it more productive.
B00CYQPM42,9,6,The is some glare in bright light but that is the trade-off for color.The included apps are good enough.
B00CYQPM42,9,7,Screen is gorgeous and so clear it's like 3D at times.
B00CYQPM42,9,8,This is awesome and very light.
B00CYQPM42,9,9,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,9,10,GREAT PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,9,11,otherwise over all nice & compact.
B00CYQPM42,9,12,I take it everywhere and use it all the time for work and play.
B00CYQPM42,9,13,It's fast, responsive and never seems to drop the connection.
B00CYQPM42,9,14,I am using it to write this review, actually.
B00CYQPM42,9,15,Got a Poetic magnetic cover and it works great!
B00CYQPM42,9,16,For an extra $150 and you get a much bigger screen.
B00CYQPM42,9,17,The new screen is sweet too.
B00CYQPM42,9,18,HDX 7" Light to carry & while in bed.
B00CYQPM42,9,19,Its easy to use, small enough to carry around and we have had no issues with it.
B00CYQPM42,9,20,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,9,21,Not small where it would be uncomfortable to read from, but compact.
B00CYQPM42,9,22,The display quality is truly awesome, the screen size is perfect for games and reading.
B00CYQPM42,9,23,I like the smaller size, it's easier to carry around and hold.
B00CYQPM42,9,24,I kept hitting the virtual button during normal typing... changed it for a Nook HD+, which was a fantastic bargain for only $139 at the time.
B00CYQPM42,10,0,Really great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,1,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,2,It looks great too.
B00CYQPM42,10,3,Great.
B00CYQPM42,10,4,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,10,5,For the price it was a great deal.
B00CYQPM42,10,6,I know they are working on it , but not fixed yet.
B00CYQPM42,10,7,I am a sitter at the hospital and it works well for what I need it to do.
B00CYQPM42,10,8,Great value.
B00CYQPM42,10,9,I was led to believe it might have one and till now, I don't have clear information about it and because of that, I feel I still need to look for another device all because of one missing functionality.
B00CYQPM42,10,10,Great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,11,Works perfect, the kids love them!
B00CYQPM42,10,12,very nice apps, the resolution and sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,10,13,Otherwise this product is great!
B00CYQPM42,10,14,It also has a great functional cover.
B00CYQPM42,10,15,Very easy to use and the apps specially for kids are great.
B00CYQPM42,10,16,The first thing they'll be shocked by is the beautiful screen.They've done everything right with the hardware.
B00CYQPM42,10,17,Very functional for the cost & for beginners.
B00CYQPM42,10,18,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,19,I also own a Samsung Note 8, several iPads and have several other tablets as well.
B00CYQPM42,10,20,best thing to ever be able use in one hand besides a taser in dangerous situation.
B00CYQPM42,10,21,Great tab, but until the Flash issue is solved, not perfect.
B00CYQPM42,10,22,This feels really good in your hand and the screen is BEAUTIFUL.
B00CYQPM42,10,23,As great as the ads said it would be!
B00CYQPM42,10,24,Works great.
B00CYQPM42,11,0,The placement of the USB port for charger is a great improvement.
B00CYQPM42,11,1,But all in all, if you like thin, fast it is great.
B00CYQPM42,11,2,battery life.
B00CYQPM42,11,3,Mine has to be charged daily whether it's in use or not.
B00CYQPM42,11,4,Love the easier-to-locate design of the on/off button and external volume control button too.
B00CYQPM42,11,5,Fast thin.
B00CYQPM42,11,6,Not to sure I like no port now, and buttons on the back are hit often.
B00CYQPM42,11,7,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,11,8,Love it, love it!!
B00CYQPM42,11,9,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,11,10,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,11,11,The is some glare in bright light but that is the trade-off for color.The included apps are good enough.
B00CYQPM42,11,12,The improved 'carousel' and apps screen is also a nice improvement.
B00CYQPM42,11,13,Then they took away the HDMI port which I use often to play a movies on my TV.
B00CYQPM42,11,14,She doesn't need to use her laptop much anymore.
B00CYQPM42,11,15,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,11,16,Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One.
B00CYQPM42,11,17,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,11,18,It's lighter faster & clearer!
B00CYQPM42,11,19,Love It!! What a great device!!
B00CYQPM42,11,20,Watching movies works for me - the 7" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.
B00CYQPM42,11,21,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,11,22,Good shape, size and easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,11,23,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,11,24,This device is well designed, color is excellent, good battery life, good sized screen, easy to use and generally all around handy device to have and the price is excellent for what you get.
B00CYQPM42,12,0,It works very sporadic.
B00CYQPM42,12,1,As great as the ads said it would be!
B00CYQPM42,12,2,Works great.
B00CYQPM42,12,3,Very nice.
B00CYQPM42,12,4,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,12,5,Nice tablet, but... Great little tablet.
B00CYQPM42,12,6,Good shape, size and easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,12,7,Thirdly, everything seems to work nicely.
B00CYQPM42,12,8,But all in all, if you like thin, fast it is great.
B00CYQPM42,12,9,It works well and is smarter than I.
B00CYQPM42,12,10,They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.
B00CYQPM42,12,11,Other than that it's a nice tablet.
B00CYQPM42,12,12,Very nice product
B00CYQPM42,12,13,Like the display.
B00CYQPM42,12,14,Nice.
B00CYQPM42,12,15,This thing is great!
B00CYQPM42,12,16,I like the display and it is easy to operate.
B00CYQPM42,12,17,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,12,18,Beautiful display screen.
B00CYQPM42,12,19,Really good.
B00CYQPM42,12,20,The screen is beautiful and it is incredibly fast!
B00CYQPM42,12,21,It still has a lot of kinks to be worked out.
B00CYQPM42,12,22,What I do like is when it does work it's pretty accurate as far as words.
B00CYQPM42,12,23,Fast, very fast.
B00CYQPM42,12,24,It is a great traveling companion!
B00CYQPM42,13,0,Great customer service!!
B00CYQPM42,13,1,fast shipping.
B00CYQPM42,13,2,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,13,3,If I had known I wouldn't have purchased this product.
B00CYQPM42,13,4,Great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,5,Great product!
B00CYQPM42,13,6,This is a great product.
B00CYQPM42,13,7,Superior Product.
B00CYQPM42,13,8,This product will replace iPads in no time.My Dad loves the MayDay.
B00CYQPM42,13,9,Although it's old tech now, one thing I love about Samsung products is they LAST.
B00CYQPM42,13,10,So I contacted Amazon customer service and let me just say they really are as amazing as everyone says!
B00CYQPM42,13,11,I think they are a great value and being backed by amazon means they will be supported for a long time.
B00CYQPM42,13,12,The best part about the Kindle devices is the excellent customer service.
B00CYQPM42,13,13,You now must purchase an additional product from amazon at a cost of around $100.
B00CYQPM42,13,14,Love Love Love.
B00CYQPM42,13,15,Literally if apple offered that service for free like this, there would rioting in the streets.
B00CYQPM42,13,16,Thanks for being there when I call!
B00CYQPM42,13,17,Awesome product!! Blue/Purple border uhh??
B00CYQPM42,13,18,You will love this device and you can get free two day shipping with this offer.
B00CYQPM42,13,19,It was the best customer service experience I've ever had.
B00CYQPM42,13,20,I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one.
B00CYQPM42,13,21,However, I am largely happy with my purchase, and am definitely happy with Amazon's customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,22,I understood every word that they said (it wasn't outsourced) and it was by far the best tech-issue customer service contact I've ever had.
B00CYQPM42,13,23,Keep up the great work Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,13,24,awesome product, easy and friendly  tech support i would consider purchasing another one from amazon if they were giving the deals they were before christmas.
B00CYQPM42,14,0,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,14,1,My next was an iPad 2 and then a Microsoft Surface Pro.
B00CYQPM42,14,2,Not the best tablet, but perhaps the best value.
B00CYQPM42,14,3,This device is the best digital do hicky I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,14,4,Good tablet overall but the thing is the appstore its has about 10x less than the apple apps in the appstore
B00CYQPM42,14,5,size wise, it's the best.
B00CYQPM42,14,6,Spearkers, one of the best in relation to same size tabsSmooth software.
B00CYQPM42,14,7,I first mis-read this for using Microsoft office.
B00CYQPM42,14,8,They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.
B00CYQPM42,14,9,Good Product!
B00CYQPM42,14,10,This is, to date, the BEST tablet I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,14,11,Google you can't exactly use Microsoft office but does have word processing capabilities for all of us "on-the-go" and who can't afford the beautiful new window tablets.
B00CYQPM42,14,12,The device is everything I hoped for.
B00CYQPM42,14,13,I would have liked to have some form of user guide so I could know more about its functions and how to use them.
B00CYQPM42,14,14,If you can afford it the iPad is two times the machine.
B00CYQPM42,14,15,It works very sporadic.
B00CYQPM42,14,16,Lastly I bought this to use almost as a portable laptop because I read you can VIEW Microsoft office documents.
B00CYQPM42,14,17,While I love the kindle, I am used to Apple products.
B00CYQPM42,14,18,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,14,19,Although it's old tech now, one thing I love about Samsung products is they LAST.
B00CYQPM42,14,20,Without this feature, there won't be any cool apps like Apple's Siri or Android's Speaktoit Assistant.
B00CYQPM42,14,21,Much better than an Apple I-Pad!
B00CYQPM42,14,22,It was right there for free in the app store and works beautifully on this device.
B00CYQPM42,14,23,The improved 'carousel' and apps screen is also a nice improvement.
B00CYQPM42,14,24,The hardware is excellent, and the user interface is pretty good as well.
B00CYQPM42,15,0,And it just looks sharp with the black screen and backing.
B00CYQPM42,15,1,The only other problem I have noticed is with the screen resolution.
B00CYQPM42,15,2,The interface is polished, the screen is bright and sharp.
B00CYQPM42,15,3,As for the rest, the screen is very sharp, and colors are great.
B00CYQPM42,15,4,Side by side the 7's reading screen on white looked "dirty" compared to the 8.9's crisp whiteness (same purple haze on both sadly).
B00CYQPM42,15,5,I have noticed my screen flickers when I am using an app that has color (basically everything except reading).
B00CYQPM42,15,6,I don't think its so horrible that you won't be able to read on the white screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,7,I do not like the blue lighting around the edges, it something resets and even with a black background (to avoid the blue lighting) it has a light flicker.
B00CYQPM42,15,8,Pros and cons of my kindle.
B00CYQPM42,15,9,For starters, the blue "glare" that is mentioned around the edge of the screen is there.
B00CYQPM42,15,10,kindle fire hdx 7" Not too happy all of a sudden there was no charge all I got was a black screen with 2 little white lines.
B00CYQPM42,15,11,The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.
B00CYQPM42,15,12,you can read on a black background with white letters and the blue glare goes away.
B00CYQPM42,15,13,However, the display suffered more from the "blue" on the sides more than others I'd seen.
B00CYQPM42,15,14,Watching movies works for me - the 7" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.
B00CYQPM42,15,15,But if you have an old Kindle you like for reading, word games , the dictionary and thesauras, stick with the black and white.
B00CYQPM42,15,16,So I turned it back down to a brightness of about 75% which is bright enough without being too bright.The only problem I have with the screen is that it is very reflective, easily the most reflective tablet I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,15,17,The angle matches the angled edges of the Kindle HDX.
B00CYQPM42,15,18,The picture is wonderful, the sharpness and color is fine.
B00CYQPM42,15,19,The screen is sharp and clear, so it is great for reading and watching you tube videos.
B00CYQPM42,15,20,I even showed my grown daughter the "offending" screen (saying nothing of the complaints) asking her if she saw anything, anything at all unusual or bothersome about the reading screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,21,The reflections are the worst when the screen is mainly black, which happens often because the main screen of the tablet is black.
B00CYQPM42,15,22,In fact, the screen is much sharper than the HD (and the HD was very clear).
B00CYQPM42,15,23,6 NOV 2013**After further use, I still think the Kindle Fire HDX screen is one of the best screens in terms of keeping it clean.
B00CYQPM42,15,24,screen is sharp.
B00CYQPM42,16,0,There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation.
B00CYQPM42,16,1,Does not do Google plus and most apps...
B00CYQPM42,16,2,To few apps.
B00CYQPM42,16,3,Amazon you need to fix your App store
B00CYQPM42,16,4,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,16,5,All it needs is a suitable app store.
B00CYQPM42,16,6,App store is awful!!!!!!!!!!
B00CYQPM42,16,7,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,16,8,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,16,9,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,16,10,The child or toddler apps I did download would freeze, not only the app but also the tablet!
B00CYQPM42,16,11,I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet.
B00CYQPM42,16,12,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,16,13,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,16,14,Why is there no app for an update for Flash Player?
B00CYQPM42,16,15,With an Android device, you can access the Amazon Android store, but with a Kindle Fire, you cannot access the Google Play store.
B00CYQPM42,16,16,Although the Amazon appstore is still dwarfed by Google Play, Amazon's vast media library of books and magazines, videos, and music more than makes up for fewer apps, at least for me.
B00CYQPM42,16,17,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,16,18,Not enough apps.
B00CYQPM42,16,19,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,16,20,Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app.
B00CYQPM42,16,21,There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX.
B00CYQPM42,16,22,Also, if you aren't an Amazon Prime member, the Kindle might not have as many perks (e.g.
B00CYQPM42,16,23,(Note: I read somewhere that it's possible to download Google Voice Search from the Google Play store, enabling speech recognition on the Kindle Fire.)
B00CYQPM42,16,24,So some websites with videos cant play the videos.
B00CYQPM42,17,0,I FOUND THAT THE PRICE WAS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,17,1,Not what I expected.
B00CYQPM42,17,2,I am really disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,3,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,4,Would recommend buying a case for this and all kindles since they can be slippery at times.
B00CYQPM42,17,5,For the longest time I had wanted an iPad, but I never had the money.
B00CYQPM42,17,6,This was my 4th kindle and I will not be wasting my money on one ever again.
B00CYQPM42,17,7,I bought this, as a gift for my 72 year old mother.
B00CYQPM42,17,8,I bought two of these for Christmas, one for me one and one as a gift, at $179.
B00CYQPM42,17,9,If I had to do it again, I would not buy it and I want to send it back
B00CYQPM42,17,10,Why waste money on buying then having to buy everything else when you can get a Kindle Fire HDX that just plain kicks Apple's ass?
B00CYQPM42,17,11,The same thing happened when I bought the Kindle Paperwhite a  year ago.
B00CYQPM42,17,12,Next time I'm buying an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,13,It was a Christmas present.
B00CYQPM42,17,14,I am just very disappointed in it for what I paid for.
B00CYQPM42,17,15,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,16,Disappointed in this.
B00CYQPM42,17,17,I guess I'm going to pay $200 more for and Ipad which I didn't want to do in the first place.
B00CYQPM42,17,18,I purchased this as a gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,19,Disappointing.
B00CYQPM42,17,20,Great buy for the value.
B00CYQPM42,17,21,Overal disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,22,Disappointing after owning an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,23,This is my first time with a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,17,24,If you buy it as a cheaper alternative to other Android-based tablets you will likely be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,18,0,The battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,18,1,Battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,18,2,The battery charger is faulty and the only way I can charge the kindle is to prop up the cord.
B00CYQPM42,18,3,Does not hold it's charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,4,battery doesn't last.
B00CYQPM42,18,5,Cannot turn it off.
B00CYQPM42,18,6,Have to charge it almost every day.
B00CYQPM42,18,7,One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,8,I don't want to have to turn on Quiet Time all the time just to get this to stop.
B00CYQPM42,18,9,Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours.
B00CYQPM42,18,10,The Kindle recently died, the battery cannot be charged, even when using a different charger.
B00CYQPM42,18,11,The first one after less than a week woudn't charge.. Sent it back and they sent us a new one.
B00CYQPM42,18,12,Low battery life.
B00CYQPM42,18,13,Battery only last for two to three  hours.
B00CYQPM42,18,14,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,15,Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%.
B00CYQPM42,18,16,There is no time zone for EST.
B00CYQPM42,18,17,The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger.
B00CYQPM42,18,18,I have to hold the power button down for 15 seconds or more for it to shut off.
B00CYQPM42,18,19,If the cord is propped up I can leave it plugged in all night and it won't charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,20,Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left.
B00CYQPM42,18,21,But ultimately, it's the battery life that prompts me to return the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,18,22,My husband has an iPad, and he charges it maybe once a week.
B00CYQPM42,18,23,The lousy battery life is my main complaint, however.
B00CYQPM42,18,24,Something's amiss here.What is going on with this, TILTED power plug/charger?
B00CYQPM42,19,0,I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones.
B00CYQPM42,19,1,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,19,2,- I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers.
B00CYQPM42,19,3,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,19,4,The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.
B00CYQPM42,19,5,If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder.
B00CYQPM42,19,6,Now I just have to find a pretty case for it!!
B00CYQPM42,19,7,found the speakers to have decent sound.
B00CYQPM42,19,8,With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste.
B00CYQPM42,19,9,I bought headphones so that I can hear all video-play clearly and well.
B00CYQPM42,19,10,I bought this for my father who has low vision.
B00CYQPM42,19,11,I'm not sure how they do it but the sound and volume on this thing is incredible.
B00CYQPM42,19,12,Ever heard of quality control?
B00CYQPM42,19,13,Not for Low Vision.
B00CYQPM42,19,14,Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me.
B00CYQPM42,19,15,It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.
B00CYQPM42,19,16,And the sound!
B00CYQPM42,19,17,Some action scenes, I could tell it was lower quality, but not that noticeable.
B00CYQPM42,19,18,Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side.
B00CYQPM42,19,19,In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough.
B00CYQPM42,19,20,Sound is really good (not home theater quality or anything) but better than any phone I've heard.
B00CYQPM42,19,21,From my own testing, the built in speakers are one of the best on any tablet or phone.
B00CYQPM42,19,22,I haven't pressed the button yet to try it out, as I think I would feel pretty dumb: when they ask me how can they help, I don't want to say "I just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say `hi' for purposes of this review."What
B00CYQPM42,19,23,The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent.
B00CYQPM42,19,24,Clear picture, quality sound.
B00CYQPM42,20,0,The HDX has a front facing camera, but lacks a rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,1,It also doesn't have a rear facing camera, it only has a front facing one, like for apps such as Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,2,I don't like just front camera ure feature..rather, I prefer rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,3,The poor quality front facing only camera on it.
B00CYQPM42,20,4,#1 the camera on this model is only front facing but it seems that on all of the other HDX models that are larger they have a front AND rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,5,The 7” version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.
B00CYQPM42,20,6,The rear facing camera would make my 32BG purchase choice more useful.
B00CYQPM42,20,7,I ONLY WISH THE CAMERA WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
B00CYQPM42,20,8,The only camera is on the front side (screen side), so taking video or a picture with it is difficult because you can't see the screen.
B00CYQPM42,20,9,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,10,Also the camera is the worst part, the camera is only on the front of the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,11,You need a camera for Skype or other video app.-
B00CYQPM42,20,12,If you take the time to put a camera, why not make give it a front and rear with more megapixels to really compete with other tablets?
B00CYQPM42,20,13,I had hoped I would be able to use it to take pictures and video as well as use it for video chat.
B00CYQPM42,20,14,Like last year's model, there is no rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,15,The only pictures you can take of are yourself because if you turn it around you can't see what you are taking a picture of.
B00CYQPM42,20,16,A camera on the back would be much preferable.
B00CYQPM42,20,17,Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it.
B00CYQPM42,20,18,It looked like a regular camera picture.
B00CYQPM42,20,19,It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,20,I am not sure what use the camera on the front is, unless you like to take selfies holding what amounts to a book in front of you.
B00CYQPM42,20,21,-- the camera takes wonderful video / photos : additional options available 4 use w/ the camera -- one drawback > front camera only -if u desire front / back u would have 2 purchase 8.9 device -- pixels woo -- mayday feature haven't used it  yet -- has voice 2 text feature--
B00CYQPM42,20,22,It could only be more perfect if it had a front facing camera!
B00CYQPM42,20,23,It now comes with a cable and wall charger.There is no rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,24,This dissapointed me alot because I spend alot of extra money to pay for the 32 GB to take pictures on it but I cant really take any pictures of use with the front facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,21,0,I have an iPad 1 and  wanted to upgrade due to slow speed and the inability to upgrade iOS/ app incompatibility.
B00CYQPM42,21,1,Not enough apps.
B00CYQPM42,21,2,And when I say froze, i mean it became completely non-responsive for over an hour until i finally gave up and performed a hard reboot.
B00CYQPM42,21,3,Lots of freezing and unexpected hangs.
B00CYQPM42,21,4,I use it a lot more than I use my desktop now.
B00CYQPM42,21,5,No decent weather apps are available.
B00CYQPM42,21,6,I assessed several different tablets, making charts on hardware, performance' pros & con's etc.
B00CYQPM42,21,7,No chrome, Firefox, atomic, or safari.
B00CYQPM42,21,8,Having dual camera is important in today's technology and that's very disappointing.
B00CYQPM42,21,9,It comes with a 2.2GHz quad-core processor, which is the standard in the latest tablets.
B00CYQPM42,21,10,If you can't side load or extract .apk
B00CYQPM42,21,11,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,21,12,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,21,13,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,21,14,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,21,15,I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently.
B00CYQPM42,21,16,Crashed constantly.
B00CYQPM42,21,17,Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.
B00CYQPM42,21,18,The improved 'carousel' and apps screen is also a nice improvement.
B00CYQPM42,21,19,The browser often hangs for no reason, even when my broadband is working fine.More rrestarting.
B00CYQPM42,21,20,The flashing that happens during the game is a random act and not something that can really be shown unless catching it at the right time which is unlikely.other
B00CYQPM42,21,21,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,21,22,After 6 months it died.
B00CYQPM42,21,23,I don't feel like I should have side load.
B00CYQPM42,21,24,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,22,0,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,1,I also like that there is a "on device" and "cloud" app storage so I can move apps to the Cloud when I don't want them for a time.
B00CYQPM42,22,2,It is REALLY hard to quit apps.
B00CYQPM42,22,3,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,22,4,too many slot pop ups.
B00CYQPM42,22,5,Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage.
B00CYQPM42,22,6,It's ways to buy apps.
B00CYQPM42,22,7,It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2.
B00CYQPM42,22,8,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,22,9,The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!
B00CYQPM42,22,10,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,22,11,But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing.
B00CYQPM42,22,12,I have a newer Mac, and my Mac does not recognize the device.
B00CYQPM42,22,13,Still having a few problems finding things on this one, after I got used to the last model.
B00CYQPM42,22,14,I don't have any complaints or suggestions for future changes so far (except maybe to quit tempting me with new models for a while!).
B00CYQPM42,22,15,It has plenrty of memory to keep everything you've ever opened up and running, but dang what A pain to quit.
B00CYQPM42,22,16,The fact that the device does not support storage expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,17,The child or toddler apps I did download would freeze, not only the app but also the tablet!
B00CYQPM42,22,18,Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app.
B00CYQPM42,22,19,I find it very useless due to the fact that there is not many apps.
B00CYQPM42,22,20,So now I'm forced to either purchase additional space or be satisfied with what's there.
B00CYQPM42,22,21,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,22,22,files, you may not find all the apps you want or need - at this time.
B00CYQPM42,22,23,Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB
B00CYQPM42,22,24,My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats.
B00CYQPM42,23,0,WIFI Connectivity.
B00CYQPM42,23,1,Won't Connect to my Wireless Router.
B00CYQPM42,23,2,wi-fi drops constantly.
B00CYQPM42,23,3,The wi-fi connection drops constantly for no apparent reason.
B00CYQPM42,23,4,It is hard and slow to connect to WiFI unlike my other Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,5,My other devices have never had an issue.
B00CYQPM42,23,6,i got this particular model so i could have internet/ wifi anywhere.
B00CYQPM42,23,7,At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem.
B00CYQPM42,23,8,Whenever I would connect to Wifi the Kindle would shut down and reboot.
B00CYQPM42,23,9,Thus, I ran into the very same connectivity issues that I had with my old Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,10,A very unexpected bonus to the new device.
B00CYQPM42,23,11,It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day.
B00CYQPM42,23,12,I have a slow internet connection, and only one option for a service provider.
B00CYQPM42,23,13,And the update fixed all the problems I had encountered.
B00CYQPM42,23,14,Some days it works fine but once it starts acting up, it will continuously drop connection every 2 - 10 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,23,15,Today, I was at Starbucks, where I tried connecting to the internet through their free WIFI service, but failed to connect.
B00CYQPM42,23,16,He sent a few emails telling me he was working on the problem and the last email I received stated his superiors said I should update my kindle with the new update because it would fix my problems..
B00CYQPM42,23,17,Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems.
B00CYQPM42,23,18,Does everything I want but it did drop my email server several times and has to be reinstalled.
B00CYQPM42,23,19,it constantly loses my wi-fi singnal (at least 2-3 times per day).
B00CYQPM42,23,20,A major drawback has emerged: rebooting before connecting to wi-fi.
B00CYQPM42,23,21,For this reason, I made the decision not to order the 4G internet (Verizon) with it and ordered solely the WIFI connection for it.
B00CYQPM42,23,22,I find this rather funny as I mentioned this is a software specific problem with the installation and has nothing to do with my modem or Internet connection.
B00CYQPM42,23,23,This is the second one that the freezing happens so I'm not sure if it's something mechanical or what the reason is for it freezing.
B00CYQPM42,23,24,She couldn't comprehend that I could not complete her troubleshooting checklist because the device was not working!
B00CYQPM42,24,0,The only thing I don't like is the keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,24,1,Will need to find a way to change the keyboard layout.
B00CYQPM42,24,2,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,24,3,My only complaint about this product is that it's way too sensitive to touch.
B00CYQPM42,24,4,For example, something like Surface touch cover.
B00CYQPM42,24,5,I miss being able to click on the top of the screen to get to settings.
B00CYQPM42,24,6,I keep finding things that  I didn't know were there.
B00CYQPM42,24,7,The screen is very clear and the options for use are almost endless.
B00CYQPM42,24,8,So far not happy at all with a product that almost cost me $300.00 and has a HORRIBLE VERY OBVIOUS blue/purple line that goes alone the whole screen on both sides.
B00CYQPM42,24,9,For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit.
B00CYQPM42,24,10,I do not find that type of batter drain a problem.
B00CYQPM42,24,11,The keyboard has swipe built in and it works well plus I also like the ease of adding new words to the dictionary.
B00CYQPM42,24,12,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,24,13,This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached.
B00CYQPM42,24,14,Like HDX very much and wish a touch cover like keyboard case to make it more productive.
B00CYQPM42,24,15,Except....when I took it to the beach and opened the cover, I didn't see a way to connect to the hotel's wi fi.
B00CYQPM42,24,16,Horrible Purple Blue Hue Along Edges Very Obvious!
B00CYQPM42,24,17,Some days it works fine but once it starts acting up, it will continuously drop connection every 2 - 10 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,24,18,Next time I'm buying an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,24,19,Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,24,20,Very disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,24,21,At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch.
B00CYQPM42,24,22,It's really frustrating.
B00CYQPM42,24,23,I see zero blue hue with a black screen as well.
B00CYQPM42,24,24,The only other problem I have noticed is with the screen resolution.
B00CYQPM42,25,0,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,25,1,It is REALLY hard to quit apps.
B00CYQPM42,25,2,I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet.
B00CYQPM42,25,3,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,25,4,A very unexpected bonus to the new device.
B00CYQPM42,25,5,There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX.
B00CYQPM42,25,6,This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well.
B00CYQPM42,25,7,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,25,8,Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.
B00CYQPM42,25,9,Kindle Fire- best kept secret for devices.
B00CYQPM42,25,10,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,25,11,Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One.
B00CYQPM42,25,12,Actually it makes me feel like I need a dummies book to work it
B00CYQPM42,25,13,I was one of the first to buy a Kindle back when Amazon first introduced these devices.
B00CYQPM42,25,14,This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.
B00CYQPM42,25,15,For the price of a Kindle Fire HDX, you will not find anything better.
B00CYQPM42,25,16,I will immediately get rid of the device when I am back in the states and buy an IPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,17,Kindle Fire HDX 7" and Fire OS 3.1 review.
B00CYQPM42,25,18,Text to speech only works on actual Kindle devices.
B00CYQPM42,25,19,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,25,20,I will keep my Kindle Fire for a bit and see how this all pans out with Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,25,21,Since I purchased the Kindle Fire HDX, it came with 500 Amazon coins.
B00CYQPM42,25,22,In that regards, I give the nod to the Kindle Fire HDX.
B00CYQPM42,25,23,This screen issue not so much.
B00CYQPM42,25,24,You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.
B00CYQPM42,26,0,The Lack of even a mini USB port.
B00CYQPM42,26,1,Only thing that is really lacking is a USB port otherwise it is a great little product.
B00CYQPM42,26,2,The USB port sticks out at an odd angle, making it difficult to plug in.
B00CYQPM42,26,3,My only complaint is the power/USB port is angled so when the cable is plugged in and the tablet is on the table, the cord does not lay flat.
B00CYQPM42,26,4,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,26,5,Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away.
B00CYQPM42,26,6,It's just very odd and makes charging annoying.2)
B00CYQPM42,26,7,The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3.
B00CYQPM42,26,8,Another thing I like about this product, is that it dosn't  have proprietary issues.
B00CYQPM42,26,9,have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle.
B00CYQPM42,26,10,Then the airlines went to the "shut off all electronic devices" to "now you may leave your electronic devices on during take-off" recently.
B00CYQPM42,26,11,Again, not a huge deal but also something to bear in mind if youre in the market.5
B00CYQPM42,26,12,My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats.
B00CYQPM42,26,13,The fact that the device does not support storage expansion.
B00CYQPM42,26,14,Otherwise a v good device for a commuter who likes to watch a movie while traveling to and fro work each day,display is exceptional.
B00CYQPM42,26,15,This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached.
B00CYQPM42,26,16,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,26,17,I will immediately get rid of the device when I am back in the states and buy an IPad.
B00CYQPM42,26,18,I got this because my Android phone's screen was too small for reading and some gaming and note taking.
B00CYQPM42,26,19,Much better than an iPad.3)
B00CYQPM42,26,20,It does not have an indicator light to show when it is charging which is unfortunate as the plug in is at an angle and a little hard to use.
B00CYQPM42,26,21,I can not believe how good even the speakers are given the size of this device.
B00CYQPM42,26,22,Then they took away the HDMI port which I use often to play a movies on my TV.
B00CYQPM42,26,23,The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger.
B00CYQPM42,26,24,Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,27,0,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,27,1,It works just that well.
B00CYQPM42,27,2,I bought this for my wife and have had it maybe month and everything stopped working can not even unlock screen when you reset it.
B00CYQPM42,27,3,I would have given it 5 stars but some of the apps will flip upside down when I have the screen locked in one place.
B00CYQPM42,27,4,The only thing that takes some getting used to is the buttons and their location.
B00CYQPM42,27,5,Crashed constantly.
B00CYQPM42,27,6,Does not do Google plus and most apps...
B00CYQPM42,27,7,I keep finding things that  I didn't know were there.
B00CYQPM42,27,8,pro and con.
B00CYQPM42,27,9,It would not operate.
B00CYQPM42,27,10,I didn't have to go through an automated system, I was able to speak with a qualified, kind, and proficient individual, and I was given a large credit for my trouble with the first one.
B00CYQPM42,27,11,It's not a big deal, just annoying.
B00CYQPM42,27,12,Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes.
B00CYQPM42,27,13,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,27,14,Holds its charge well.
B00CYQPM42,27,15,Other than that, I LOVE IT!
B00CYQPM42,27,16,The reflections are the worst when the screen is mainly black, which happens often because the main screen of the tablet is black.
B00CYQPM42,27,17,Which they sent quickly....and that one had more screen issues.I don't know if I just had bad luck, but that's the point when I gave up.
B00CYQPM42,27,18,I feel it is not very user-friendly, at least for me.
B00CYQPM42,27,19,Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.
B00CYQPM42,27,20,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,27,21,You won't be sorry that's for sure so make sure and give this a try.
B00CYQPM42,27,22,Works perfect, the kids love them!
B00CYQPM42,27,23,love love love it.
B00CYQPM42,27,24,I don't want to have to turn on Quiet Time all the time just to get this to stop.
B00CYQPM42,28,0,I even called customer service and they said there's was a problem with it.
B00CYQPM42,28,1,I have contacted support about these problems.
B00CYQPM42,28,2,I am going to contact support again to see if they can help.
B00CYQPM42,28,3,poor support.
B00CYQPM42,28,4,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,28,5,I called customer service AGAIN and asked if I was eligible for a refund and they told me that because this was a replacement device I could not have a refund.
B00CYQPM42,28,6,I want to return it.
B00CYQPM42,28,7,He sent a few emails telling me he was working on the problem and the last email I received stated his superiors said I should update my kindle with the new update because it would fix my problems..
B00CYQPM42,28,8,The device is 5 months old...After contacting Amazon Kindle support a fourth time, someone finally helped me.
B00CYQPM42,28,9,Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept.
B00CYQPM42,28,10,Its a poorly developed product with poor customer service.
B00CYQPM42,28,11,Therefore, I am no longer receiving any more emails about this issue which means the problems are not fixed and now I don't know what to do about it.
B00CYQPM42,28,12,So far I've had no problems with my Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,28,13,It took a few days for a very supportive customer service chap from Ireland to sort out the problem.
B00CYQPM42,28,14,I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support.
B00CYQPM42,28,15,When I called customer service they were great (the reason that this go any stars) I received a replacement and I am having the same issues.
B00CYQPM42,28,16,I'm pretty aggravated any time I have to deal with Amazon Customer Service.
B00CYQPM42,28,17,i contacted customer service and it took them a week to send a canned email with instructions on how to load an email.
B00CYQPM42,28,18,I asked him how to put PDFs on my kindle and tech service told me I had to email the documents to amazon so that they would convert them for me.
B00CYQPM42,28,19,This is something i also asked about when in called customer service and was told it was the kindle and my internet.
B00CYQPM42,28,20,Great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,28,21,I have never had a problem with Amazon in all the years that I have been their customer.
B00CYQPM42,28,22,I gave it to my niece who is 10, so of course she does not have an Amazon account and cannot call to get the Kindle replaced.
B00CYQPM42,28,23,I am especially disappointed that my problems have now been written off.
B00CYQPM42,28,24,Very happy customer.
B00CYQPM42,29,0,Having a lot of issues with this!!!
B00CYQPM42,29,1,This screen issue not so much.
B00CYQPM42,29,2,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,29,3,The issue has not been fixed.
B00CYQPM42,29,4,The device shuts down and restarts while reading.
B00CYQPM42,29,5,There are 4 obvious shadows at the bottom of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,29,6,Just hanged up with the CS and they assure that is a software feature, and that can be fixed with a software update.
B00CYQPM42,29,7,I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently.
B00CYQPM42,29,8,Lots of freezing and unexpected hangs.
B00CYQPM42,29,9,I am going to hold on to my device until mid November and see what happens
B00CYQPM42,29,10,A software update was just done, so I had hopes that my troubles were over.
B00CYQPM42,29,11,Adding this to a mainly iOS collection was a bit of a struggle at first (still is a bit), with regards to navigating the software and remembering where the buttons on the machine are.
B00CYQPM42,29,12,Otherwise it's a great little machine!
B00CYQPM42,29,13,Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,29,14,It's hard to scroll through screens without opening something about which you have no interest.
B00CYQPM42,29,15,For instance, I have run into a few occasions where it has crashed and restarted.
B00CYQPM42,29,16,The bottom line is that this is not a repairable device.
B00CYQPM42,29,17,Difficult to read on a sunny beach but great everywhere else.
B00CYQPM42,29,18,A lot of trouble navigating.
B00CYQPM42,29,19,Shuts down while reading.
B00CYQPM42,29,20,Have a lot to learn but I'm getting the hang of it.
B00CYQPM42,29,21,I got my wife a two year-old USED iPad, and it has worked flawlessly for a year in our possession, never freezing or requiring a hard reboot.
B00CYQPM42,29,22,I have also run into situations where I've had to reinstall apps for them to work properly again.
B00CYQPM42,29,23,My other devices have never had an issue.
B00CYQPM42,29,24,Let me just start by saying this is the first tablet I ever owned; however, I am very familiar with its hardware components enough to say that this is a very powerful tablet.
B007P4YAPK,0,0,AND the screen is slightly larger than on an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,0,1,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,0,2,It's not a super high resolution display, so the individual pixels are pretty good sized, and this was pretty noticeable.
B007P4YAPK,0,3,The screen resolution isn't as good, but unless you're super picky there's not enough difference for it to matter.
B007P4YAPK,0,4,I've watched movies while traveling on both this tablet and the iPad and notice very little difference.
B007P4YAPK,0,5,My wife's iPad 2 has light bleed issues as well, but not as obvious.
B007P4YAPK,0,6,But about a month ago, I noticed small little blotches in my screen that are white to greyish in color, but are only visible when the screen is displaying deep blacks.
B007P4YAPK,0,7,But comparing this to the iPad 2, why should I put up with this behavior?
B007P4YAPK,0,8,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,0,9,My wife has a recently purchased iPad 2, which allows me to make pretty direct comparisons to the obvious competition.
B007P4YAPK,0,10,The iPad is a superior device in every single way, from the screen, to performance to apps to battery life.Here's my review.I had the retina iPad for a while before I picked up this tablet, I knew it wasn't a high resolution screen going in so it wasn't a shock but I was still surprised at how quickly I got use to the iPad screen, the Transformer screen doesn't compare at all.
B007P4YAPK,0,11,This is actually my second TF300 that has had issues with the display as the first tablet I bought had really bad problems with what looks like bad contrasts that caused my screen to make very distinct graduations between colors when they were gradually going from a black to white like a fading sensation.
B007P4YAPK,0,12,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,0,13,In your hand something more squarish is easier to hold when you're talking about a 10" tablet, the longer the tablet the better for movies (in theory) but for everything else, and I mean everything, the 4:3 feels much more natural and is easier to hold.Again, I own this and I own an iPad -- I'm not an Apple fanboy and obviously I'm not an Android fanboy, I just want what is best I can get for my money and I can clearly state the iPad is a better device.
B007P4YAPK,0,14,The iPad 2 has much more rich and vibrant colors than the TF300, which appear washed out in comparison.
B007P4YAPK,0,15,I do love the size of it and it is easy to use, just too slow.
B007P4YAPK,0,16,I notice the difference in color when browsing, when watching videos, and sometimes when playing games.In my mind, the crashing/lagging/glitching alone makes this product defective.
B007P4YAPK,0,17,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,0,18,Honestly Android is just not there yet, but I see why people love it.So for me this didn't work out.
B007P4YAPK,0,19,Compared to the iPad I recently bought for my wife, it is really nothing much to write home about.
B007P4YAPK,0,20,I've used android for years and this unit performs worse than my Galaxy S2 phone, my 1st gen kindle fire, and way worse than the Galaxy Tab 2. For all of the hype, this performance is just unacceptable.
B007P4YAPK,0,21,Other times, I just need to "patiently" weight 8 seconds.
B007P4YAPK,0,22,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,0,23,Perhaps worst of all, possibly because of the increased resolution (the improved resolution was NOT apparent to MY eyes - it appeared to me about the same as all the other tablets) the device is incompatible with MANY apps!Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,0,24,Android should not feel this "beta" given this is a 2nd generation Android tablet and Android itself has been around for years now.
B007P4YAPK,1,0,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,1,1,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,1,2,Android tablets can't use all software.
B007P4YAPK,1,3,Netflix plays beautifully.
B007P4YAPK,1,4,I then began setting it to my liking (e.g., arranging apps on screens, etc.
B007P4YAPK,1,5,However the lag and app failures were too much for me.
B007P4YAPK,1,6,For streaming videos from Youtube or Netflix it's not so good.
B007P4YAPK,1,7,Cannot play Netflix movies on the tablet even though before I bought it I made sure everything said we could.2)
B007P4YAPK,1,8,Having problems with mine, it is slow, and sometimes it kicks me out of a program, especially on the internetThe games I download on it are easy to play and we seem to have no problems there.
B007P4YAPK,1,9,I always use it to take notes in my class and play games.
B007P4YAPK,1,10,Adobe flash player and shockwave not available so some movies, etc don't play.
B007P4YAPK,1,11,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,1,12,I did some browsing, installed Nook app and a few other common, free apps.
B007P4YAPK,1,13,Apps run quickly and the graphics/screen transitions in Android seem pretty snappy.
B007P4YAPK,1,14,Specifically, I've owned 3 different phones (HTC G1, Google Nexus One, and Samsung Nexus Galaxy) as well as a Google TV.
B007P4YAPK,1,15,And there really is no dearth of tablet specific apps on Android, that's just a myth now.I have returned my device as of now but will be ordering another soon.
B007P4YAPK,1,16,Even YouTube videos.
B007P4YAPK,1,17,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,1,18,I do love the size of it and it is easy to use, just too slow.
B007P4YAPK,1,19,still needs work.
B007P4YAPK,1,20,I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app.
B007P4YAPK,1,21,The only other small problem I've had is when maximizing Youtube videos to full-screen - sometimes it doesn't play correctly, (EDIT 070612 -- the Youtube App automatically updated recently and I no longer sometimes have a problem with maximizing video - it works perfectly now every time.)I've
B007P4YAPK,1,22,I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general.
B007P4YAPK,1,23,This happens for multiple apps, which is why I suspect the problem is NOT the applications.The crashing needs to be fixed.
B007P4YAPK,1,24,I own both platforms, I love my Google TVs but the Android tablets are just not very good, mainly due to the horrible software situation.
B007P4YAPK,2,0,But its really good for the price!
B007P4YAPK,2,1,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,2,2,None of the other Tablets were matching up on price, so when I saw the TF300 for the same price for the 32G, I jumped on it.
B007P4YAPK,2,3,Bought it refurbished.
B007P4YAPK,2,4,Good product, had shipping issues.
B007P4YAPK,2,5,Compared to the iPad I recently bought for my wife, it is really nothing much to write home about.
B007P4YAPK,2,6,I ordered this tablet because of the price and the company reviews.
B007P4YAPK,2,7,Best Android tablet, but quality issues.
B007P4YAPK,2,8,I bought my TF300 and was very impressed with the performance of the tablet for the price.
B007P4YAPK,2,9,I bought this tablet for my son for his birthday and for the first 2 weeks it was perfect!
B007P4YAPK,2,10,Cnet reviewed this as good...better than a comparable Toshiba.
B007P4YAPK,2,11,Considering the cost, great tablet!
B007P4YAPK,2,12,I was extremely happy with my purchase at first.
B007P4YAPK,2,13,The good plus is that it is a good affordable tablet to buy which I purely love it despite faults on it.
B007P4YAPK,2,14,The price is hard to beat for what you get.2.
B007P4YAPK,2,15,Returned, got a new one, since I was impressed with the tablet at its price point.
B007P4YAPK,2,16,had the same NEW model one and loved it tho.
B007P4YAPK,2,17,The screen quality is far superior to anything I've used previously, so I'm perfectly happy with it.
B007P4YAPK,2,18,For what is it worth, it is NOT worth it, and deserves 2 stars.
B007P4YAPK,2,19,It's amazingly powerful and very well priced for the features it has.
B007P4YAPK,2,20,I absolutely love it and am very happy with my choice.
B007P4YAPK,2,21,It's the same price (less if you buy refurbished), with an even wider app selection....
B007P4YAPK,2,22,They are a little faster than a laptop when first turing on, but I'm not impressed with tablets and am now researching which laptop to buy.
B007P4YAPK,2,23,Short-lived love, now cautious like.. I researched tablets for almost a month before deciding on this one.
B007P4YAPK,2,24,As this was a new model I waited to review - the tablet was great for the first two months - LOVED it!
B007P4YAPK,3,0,Powerful and has a good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,3,1,Battery life is poor - I have to recharge it all the time.
B007P4YAPK,3,2,Being able to use the keyboard was great, and the amount of extended battery life you get from it was amazing.
B007P4YAPK,3,3,I last about 2 days of heavy use.
B007P4YAPK,3,4,They are a photo junkie and just cannot get enough battery life.2.
B007P4YAPK,3,5,On the down side the battery life isn't as good as the iPad's and requires more frequent charging.
B007P4YAPK,3,6,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,3,7,Bad charger-seems to be a problem.... Tablet worked well until I tried to charge it after its first battery drain the first day of use.
B007P4YAPK,3,8,Example: one tech support insisted that 10 hours of battery life advertised is the 'stand-by' time as in the cell phone, and 5-6 hours of usable battery time is normal, which makes absolutely no sense.
B007P4YAPK,3,9,Running on balanced power mode and at 25% brightness, it was running only 5-6 hours.Returning and getting the replacement unit was very easy with Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,3,10,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B007P4YAPK,3,11,I thought I must have hit the power button the first few times it happened.
B007P4YAPK,3,12,However we were part of the tech world for part of life.(A
B007P4YAPK,3,13,ASUS does not seem to educate their tech support properly.Now I have new replacement unit and the battery life is much longer 7-8 hours under the same condition, although it is still shorter than what they advertise.
B007P4YAPK,3,14,Light and powerful.
B007P4YAPK,3,15,It's a nice tablet as long as you stay off-line.
B007P4YAPK,3,16,The fully charged battery dies within couple of hours of continuous use.
B007P4YAPK,3,17,This makes the battery last a maximum of an hour when you are trying to use the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,3,18,Unfortunately the day after I got it, I went to plug the tablet into the keyboard dock and it wouldn't click.
B007P4YAPK,3,19,I purchased Transformer tf300 a week ago and immediately noticed it had battery life issue.
B007P4YAPK,3,20,First impression was that I could tell it was faster than A500 it was more responsive meaning faster screen swapping...The major issue I ran into was that if I grasped the TF300 on the upper left corner near the power button the tablet would just completely shut down!
B007P4YAPK,3,21,So I must be careful about how many app I run before clearing out the active stuff.LOVE the keyboard / battery.
B007P4YAPK,3,22,As a long time android user, when I saw a quad core tablet with an attachable keyboard with additional battery, HDMI out, SD slot, etc.
B007P4YAPK,3,23,When the battery is very low, even if it's plugged in, you cannot turn it on for 5 minutes or so until it charges up a little (not sure this is specific to only this tablet).5.
B007P4YAPK,3,24,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,4,0,The build quality was much better, everything aligned and in place.
B007P4YAPK,4,1,I like the build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,2,Decent sound.8.
B007P4YAPK,4,3,Decent product performance, shoddy build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,4,ASUS is the way to go if you all about just quality only without bell and whistles.
B007P4YAPK,4,5,All in all, I THOUGHT this was going to be a solid product but in the end, the price of the tablet ended up being too good to be true because of the build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,6,I had an Nexus 7 for a while as well and had the same situation with the battery and apps (although the build quality was quite good).
B007P4YAPK,4,7,Because ASUS makes good quality than samsung despite they have alot of bells and whistles.
B007P4YAPK,4,8,Good value, better options available though.
B007P4YAPK,4,9,Even though the back is plastic (to help with gps/wifi), it feels solid with little flex.4.
B007P4YAPK,4,10,The odd thing is the sync works perfectly fine on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which has less storage, RAM, etc.Sound:Sound is quite a bit more tinny than the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 speakers are quite good, and this tablet can't compare.
B007P4YAPK,4,11,I would honestly trade it in for better ASUS tablet WITH metal back.
B007P4YAPK,4,12,Best Android tablet, but quality issues.
B007P4YAPK,4,13,Clearly there are quality issues with it!
B007P4YAPK,4,14,However, the TF300T's headphone jack plays very good sound.Display:Display suffers from some fairly visible light bleed in 2 of the 4 corners.
B007P4YAPK,4,15,I bought my TF300 and was very impressed with the performance of the tablet for the price.
B007P4YAPK,4,16,The speakers are OK, but don't get very loud but they're acceptable.
B007P4YAPK,4,17,The new IPS+ high resolution screen is superb, the faster processor is welcome, the TF700 feels better constructed overall than the TF300, (partly due to being primarily made of metal), and having a built in flash for the rear camera is a nice extra too.
B007P4YAPK,4,18,The iPad is a superior device in every single way, from the screen, to performance to apps to battery life.Here's my review.I had the retina iPad for a while before I picked up this tablet, I knew it wasn't a high resolution screen going in so it wasn't a shock but I was still surprised at how quickly I got use to the iPad screen, the Transformer screen doesn't compare at all.
B007P4YAPK,4,19,While I was not expecting the same performance of the more expensive ipad, I never expected such a poor performing tablet as the asus 300tf.
B007P4YAPK,4,20,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,4,21,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,4,22,It's amazingly powerful and very well priced for the features it has.
B007P4YAPK,4,23,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,4,24,Bad video recording sound.
B007P4YAPK,5,0,The screen brightness is fine for indoors but outdoors in daylight forget it.
B007P4YAPK,5,1,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,5,2,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,5,3,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B007P4YAPK,5,4,it's a pretty good product.
B007P4YAPK,5,5,On the downside, the rear speaker is pretty marginal and poorly placed.
B007P4YAPK,5,6,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,5,7,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,5,8,Clearly there are quality issues with it!
B007P4YAPK,5,9,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,5,10,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B007P4YAPK,5,11,I think Asus focused more on innovation than giving this machine a soul that really gets it going.
B007P4YAPK,5,12,My friend has a first generation I-Pad and even that screen is noticeably brighter than the ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,5,13,The ASUS screen brightness was also a weak point, I had to take it out of the auto brightness mode and crank it up to get a decent brightness level even indoors, when placed next to the i-pad, the sharpness and the brightness weakness of the ASUS really stood out.
B007P4YAPK,5,14,Best Android tablet, but quality issues.
B007P4YAPK,5,15,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,5,16,Powerful and has a good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,5,17,I do love the size of it and it is easy to use, just too slow.
B007P4YAPK,5,18,It's light, and very easy to tote around.Excellent product.
B007P4YAPK,5,19,Its good for some things but not others.
B007P4YAPK,5,20,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,5,21,The screen sensitivity is very good though.
B007P4YAPK,5,22,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,5,23,Good product, had shipping issues.
B007P4YAPK,5,24,Bad video recording sound.
B007P4YAPK,6,0,Asus, you've gotta get all that quad core processing to work with android better!
B007P4YAPK,6,1,There are also a growing number of games from NVIDIA that only the Tegra processor can handle.
B007P4YAPK,6,2,Hopefully a new breed of tegra 3 competitors(tablets) will emerge anytime soon with faster and improved SoC's(28nm instead 40nm fab process on tegra 3 SoC) as samsung exynos quad core and qualcomm snapdragon S4.
B007P4YAPK,6,3,And it wasn't touch responsive.
B007P4YAPK,6,4,I've verified this isn't due to calibration settings or the screen being dirty.By contrast the Acer Iconia 500 was very responsive both to touch input and general app performance.
B007P4YAPK,6,5,Very responsive to inputs and can run any Android app available.
B007P4YAPK,6,6,It has 32GB built in memory and the Tegra 3 makes playing most games pretty easy and lag free.
B007P4YAPK,6,7,Though the tablet is a great product.
B007P4YAPK,6,8,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,6,9,Besides quad core the tablet is very slow in response.
B007P4YAPK,6,10,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,6,11,I need support to get to the tablet to meet its performance capabilities.The tablet itself is powerful and fun.
B007P4YAPK,6,12,Web Browsing Lags, Not Touch Responsive.
B007P4YAPK,6,13,Powerful and has a good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,6,14,Apps run quickly and the graphics/screen transitions in Android seem pretty snappy.
B007P4YAPK,6,15,Decent product performance, shoddy build quality.
B007P4YAPK,6,16,All in all, I THOUGHT this was going to be a solid product but in the end, the price of the tablet ended up being too good to be true because of the build quality.
B007P4YAPK,6,17,It's not a super high resolution display, so the individual pixels are pretty good sized, and this was pretty noticeable.
B007P4YAPK,6,18,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,6,19,It does not shutdown like others have put it but I would not call it a highend quad core processor.
B007P4YAPK,6,20,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,6,21,It has a lower-power CPU and less storage capacity, yet this supposedly more powerful tablet ultimately feels like a downgrade.
B007P4YAPK,6,22,No touch screen, but with the speed diff, I will use it from now on.
B007P4YAPK,6,23,My friend has a first generation I-Pad and even that screen is noticeably brighter than the ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,6,24,The touch screen worked flawlessly, and it was very responsive.
B007P4YAPK,7,0,HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6.
B007P4YAPK,7,1,Plenty of storage space.
B007P4YAPK,7,2,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,7,3,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,7,4,I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts.
B007P4YAPK,7,5,Overall, this tablet doesn't hold a candle to my wife's iPad 2 and it's a major let down.On to the review:Versatility: HDMI out, microSD slot, 32GB.
B007P4YAPK,7,6,I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable!
B007P4YAPK,7,7,I have no SD card installed.
B007P4YAPK,7,8,The odd thing is the sync works perfectly fine on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which has less storage, RAM, etc.Sound:Sound is quite a bit more tinny than the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 speakers are quite good, and this tablet can't compare.
B007P4YAPK,7,9,Good value, better options available though.
B007P4YAPK,7,10,I am ordering the micro SD card to boost additionally the speed and, of course, get more memory.
B007P4YAPK,7,11,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,7,12,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,7,13,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,7,14,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,7,15,Android tablets can't use all software.
B007P4YAPK,7,16,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,7,17,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,7,18,My wife's iPad 2 has light bleed issues as well, but not as obvious.
B007P4YAPK,7,19,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,7,20,I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.
B007P4YAPK,7,21,It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly.
B007P4YAPK,7,22,I also struggled a little with the new environment of Android 4 as I'd only ever used Android 2.0 before, although a within an hour or two I'd got up to speed with it and now it's second nature.
B007P4YAPK,7,23,Best Android tablet, but quality issues.
B007P4YAPK,7,24,Decent sound.8.
B007P4YAPK,8,0,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,8,1,Its good for some things but not others.
B007P4YAPK,8,2,Not for School or Work.
B007P4YAPK,8,3,I am furious that I can not rely on this device for tasks that are critical for work or school.
B007P4YAPK,8,4,We are not all computer savvy.
B007P4YAPK,8,5,still needs work.
B007P4YAPK,8,6,Yes, it performs rudimentary functions like surfing the web(if you don't mind dial up like speeds).
B007P4YAPK,8,7,I loved my TF300 Tablet, and it was beginning to replace my laptop for casual use like email, internet, shopping, banking, etc.
B007P4YAPK,8,8,however if you are planning on using this for work or school get something different.
B007P4YAPK,8,9,Got this to help me in school, but like the I -Pad it's more for Entertainment, has limited Office, Word, and anything else that you might need to get work or school done...I am now saving to get a Laptop computer, gave this to my kids, nice toyPS.
B007P4YAPK,8,10,My nexus is a better performer.
B007P4YAPK,8,11,That does not say much because I have zero problems with the galaxy nexus.
B007P4YAPK,8,12,I prefer to just go back to my desktop if I really want to do some serious web browsing.
B007P4YAPK,8,13,Web Browsing Lags, Not Touch Responsive.
B007P4YAPK,8,14,The web browsing on three different browsers lagged, stalled, and crashed.
B007P4YAPK,8,15,I have found that the touchscreen is not very responsive at times.
B007P4YAPK,8,16,Works fairly well.
B007P4YAPK,8,17,If you are planning on using this tablet for games and other non work/school related things you dont have to search any farther.
B007P4YAPK,8,18,I have not had any heat issues, if that is what makes the aluminum preferred.I do email, surfing, and some board games..........and some small office spreadsheet work.
B007P4YAPK,8,19,The touch screen worked flawlessly, and it was very responsive.
B007P4YAPK,8,20,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,8,21,Our problems with using the new toys may be that we are in our late 80's.
B007P4YAPK,8,22,I can't easily get all of my photos on my device.
B007P4YAPK,8,23,I use this tablet at home and only to surf while I am sitting watching TV.
B007P4YAPK,8,24,It's light, and very easy to tote around.Excellent product.
B007P4YAPK,9,0,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,9,1,The touch screen worked flawlessly, and it was very responsive.
B007P4YAPK,9,2,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,9,3,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,4,Back in mid-July I was on the couch using the tablet (without the keyboard) when the touch screen just stopped responding.
B007P4YAPK,9,5,And it wasn't touch responsive.
B007P4YAPK,9,6,The Galaxy also has a much nicer, more polished feel to it - wish it had the keyboard integration like the ASUS.As for the battery/keyboard, the weight balance is not very good and the unit is very top heavy/tippy because the screen is so much heavier than the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,9,7,The tablet looked great, was responsive, and relatively easy to navigate.
B007P4YAPK,9,8,I love the android slide touch keyboard that comes with it.
B007P4YAPK,9,9,Something that I can use for leisure but then I can use it for school note taking or paper writing as well with the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,9,10,It makes writing with the tablet so much easier.
B007P4YAPK,9,11,Nice.
B007P4YAPK,9,12,I have found that the touchscreen is not very responsive at times.
B007P4YAPK,9,13,Tablet felt nice and responsive; keyboard dock, unfortunately, broke the charging port.
B007P4YAPK,9,14,it's a pretty good product.
B007P4YAPK,9,15,It's light, and very easy to tote around.Excellent product.
B007P4YAPK,9,16,I still like it but not enough to warrant the $750 I now have invested in it and the docking keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,9,17,Works fairly well.
B007P4YAPK,9,18,I had typed in the three letters for the airport but the tablets was acting like there was noting typed in the provided field.I was wanting a tablet because I though they would be faster to use.
B007P4YAPK,9,19,Price wise it was a good deal.One of the first few days I had it, the letter "a" just kept rolling across the screen like it was stuck.
B007P4YAPK,9,20,Unfortunately the day after I got it, I went to plug the tablet into the keyboard dock and it wouldn't click.
B007P4YAPK,9,21,I work in the back of the plane and my goal was, I thought it would be cool to be able to see my location when flying across the ocean.I didn't like pecking with one finger to get typed out whatever I was doing.
B007P4YAPK,9,22,I received both in mid May along with a Poetic leather folio-case and also the Armorsuit MilitaryShield screen protector.
B007P4YAPK,9,23,Got this for around $300 to use at school for taking notes, and some light C++ programming.
B007P4YAPK,9,24,I downloaded a swype like keyboard, like what my phone has, to make typing quicker.
B007P4YAPK,10,0,still needs work.
B007P4YAPK,10,1,Feels cheap.
B007P4YAPK,10,2,But on the other hand, it feels cheap.
B007P4YAPK,10,3,The design is good and simplistic.
B007P4YAPK,10,4,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,10,5,Makes a great paper weight.
B007P4YAPK,10,6,I have had my Transformer TF300T since June...loved the tablet...been great.
B007P4YAPK,10,7,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,10,8,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,10,9,Considering the cost, great tablet!
B007P4YAPK,10,10,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,10,11,The concept is very good I just hope it becomes more refined.
B007P4YAPK,10,12,Loved the tablet until hardware issue...
B007P4YAPK,10,13,Half the price, 32GB with solid OS, and ample Android ( which really isn't bad) software availability.
B007P4YAPK,10,14,The kick backs over their must be huge because I literally just put this thing down and went back to my iphone.
B007P4YAPK,10,15,I'll take that for half the cost!
B007P4YAPK,10,16,That does not say much because I have zero problems with the galaxy nexus.
B007P4YAPK,10,17,All the great reviews made me believe this tablet might work out of the box.
B007P4YAPK,10,18,I gave it a shot due to the on-paper specs and the fact that I had some positive hands on time with a Transformer Prime.
B007P4YAPK,10,19,Honestly Android is just not there yet, but I see why people love it.So for me this didn't work out.
B007P4YAPK,10,20,Perhaps a week after the update, my keyboard on the dock stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,10,21,The example I received had a speck of something underneath the glass, that I could see on light backgrounds/content.
B007P4YAPK,10,22,The odd thing is the sync works perfectly fine on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which has less storage, RAM, etc.Sound:Sound is quite a bit more tinny than the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 speakers are quite good, and this tablet can't compare.
B007P4YAPK,10,23,It's my first tablet, so maybe I was expecting more than they can deliver.
B007P4YAPK,10,24,The back is plastic instead of the aluminum you'd find on a Prime or an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,11,0,They are a little faster than a laptop when first turing on, but I'm not impressed with tablets and am now researching which laptop to buy.
B007P4YAPK,11,1,Although I didn't buy it, I like the docking keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,11,2,So I must be careful about how many app I run before clearing out the active stuff.LOVE the keyboard / battery.
B007P4YAPK,11,3,I would not buy this again.Alternative.... get an old laptop and put Linux on it.
B007P4YAPK,11,4,Yes, for the Asus you can buy the keyboard and attach it to the tablet, but then I might have well just bought a laptop (which is what I'm looking for now).I tried a couple of games on it.
B007P4YAPK,11,5,While the tablet also supports an external keyboard, I prefer to use my desktop, laptop, or Chromebook for actual work or heavy communication.Performance:This tablet has fast specs on paper.
B007P4YAPK,11,6,Over all, the price of this tablet and the matching keyboard came to just barely $100 less than the laptop I was considering.
B007P4YAPK,11,7,Let's see... my 4 pound laptop, or this...ha.Very well built.
B007P4YAPK,11,8,Power and volume buttons are slightly raised allowing you to easily access them even when it's a in case.9.
B007P4YAPK,11,9,HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6.
B007P4YAPK,11,10,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,11,11,It's light, and very easy to tote around.Excellent product.
B007P4YAPK,11,12,Light and powerful.
B007P4YAPK,11,13,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,11,14,Battery life is poor - I have to recharge it all the time.
B007P4YAPK,11,15,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,11,16,Powerful and has a good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,11,17,Nice.
B007P4YAPK,11,18,I love the android slide touch keyboard that comes with it.
B007P4YAPK,11,19,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,11,20,No touch screen, but with the speed diff, I will use it from now on.
B007P4YAPK,11,21,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,11,22,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,11,23,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,11,24,I downloaded a swype like keyboard, like what my phone has, to make typing quicker.
B007P4YAPK,12,0,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,12,1,This is a really nice tablet with the up to date Android operating system and is easy to navigate.
B007P4YAPK,12,2,Great tablet for the first two months.
B007P4YAPK,12,3,still needs work.
B007P4YAPK,12,4,This was it... until it stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,12,5,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,12,6,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,12,7,The design is good and simplistic.
B007P4YAPK,12,8,great tablet with some large setbacks.
B007P4YAPK,12,9,As this was a new model I waited to review - the tablet was great for the first two months - LOVED it!
B007P4YAPK,12,10,But after a couple of months the display started blinking off/on.
B007P4YAPK,12,11,Sometimes, it works flawlessly.
B007P4YAPK,12,12,It's light, and very easy to tote around.Excellent product.
B007P4YAPK,12,13,All the great reviews made me believe this tablet might work out of the box.
B007P4YAPK,12,14,There are many ugly Apps that do not work well.
B007P4YAPK,12,15,I have this tablet for over 3 months and poked around with almost every feature.
B007P4YAPK,12,16,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,12,17,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,12,18,Not good when one of the touted features is the display.
B007P4YAPK,12,19,My iPad 2 is fast, reliable, great looking Apps, and very responsive to EVERYTHING.
B007P4YAPK,12,20,Great idea, mediocre execution, poor performance.
B007P4YAPK,12,21,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,12,22,When compared to other Android tablets, this one was supposed to be the best.
B007P4YAPK,12,23,How the wear was so great as to cause cracking of plastic is beyond me.
B007P4YAPK,12,24,No touch screen, but with the speed diff, I will use it from now on.
B007P4YAPK,13,0,The tablet was shipped USPS and was shipped on Tuesday.
B007P4YAPK,13,1,Good product, had shipping issues.
B007P4YAPK,13,2,Though the tablet is a great product.
B007P4YAPK,13,3,I also paid for expedited 2 day shipping.I did NOT get 2 day expedited shipping.
B007P4YAPK,13,4,Great customer service and quick responses from this company though.
B007P4YAPK,13,5,I received the tablet and a few days later had problems with it.
B007P4YAPK,13,6,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B007P4YAPK,13,7,This product may be right for someone, but not me since the Android phone I currently have has the same features as this and I really do not need two devices so similar.
B007P4YAPK,13,8,If I had known it was going to be like this, I personally would not have purchased it.
B007P4YAPK,13,9,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,13,10,A phone call to Samsung tech support, and YES - Samsung BELIEVES in customer support at no extra charge, confirmed the absence of autofocus in the rear facing camera!
B007P4YAPK,13,11,Also Amazon provided a credit for the $3.99 shipping charge because of the issues with the carrier.
B007P4YAPK,13,12,I ordered this tablet because of the price and the company reviews.
B007P4YAPK,13,13,Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs.
B007P4YAPK,13,14,Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned.
B007P4YAPK,13,15,ASUS support staff is hit or miss, but the replacement unit is excellent and has no issues.
B007P4YAPK,13,16,Though I complained, I did not really get any support from the vendor who shipped it.there
B007P4YAPK,13,17,Tracking showed the tablet out for delivery on Friday (3 days).
B007P4YAPK,13,18,I selected next day delivery for $3.99 (I know very inexpensive for 1 day delivery).The delivery was guaranteed to be delivered by ONTRAC by 8:00 pm.
B007P4YAPK,13,19,I asked him what the "something else for me to do meant" and he said perhaps return to Amazon (duh).I arranged to exchange this defective item with Amazon, trouble free and quite simple to accomplish KUDOS to Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,13,20,This product is fairly decent.
B007P4YAPK,13,21,A real good description for it is that this device is everything a Android smart phone is, minus the calling and texting.
B007P4YAPK,13,22,Best Android tablet, but quality issues.
B007P4YAPK,13,23,Faulty initial product, easy exchange.
B007P4YAPK,13,24,There are definitely issues with this product and it's wifi card, but they present themselves quickly and Amazon exchanges are a breeze.
B007P4YAPK,14,0,Its good for some things but not others.
B007P4YAPK,14,1,The Android OS is not quite up with the user interfaces we would expect with Microsoft Office or Apple products.
B007P4YAPK,14,2,It was great until the last OS upgrade.
B007P4YAPK,14,3,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,14,4,Android should not feel this "beta" given this is a 2nd generation Android tablet and Android itself has been around for years now.
B007P4YAPK,14,5,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,14,6,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,14,7,This product may be right for someone, but not me since the Android phone I currently have has the same features as this and I really do not need two devices so similar.
B007P4YAPK,14,8,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,14,9,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,14,10,Some of the problem is probably Windows stuff but the Windows machines don't even see the tablet but the tablet sees the Windows machines.
B007P4YAPK,14,11,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,14,12,I've also seen it scroll across 2 or more screens when I only want to scroll across 1, or just completely drop scrolling actions.
B007P4YAPK,14,13,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,14,14,Android tablets can't use all software.
B007P4YAPK,14,15,And this is the kind of flexibilty that Apple bends over backwards to stop users from mixing/matching hardware as they please.
B007P4YAPK,14,16,When compared to other Android tablets, this one was supposed to be the best.
B007P4YAPK,14,17,But comparing this to the iPad 2, why should I put up with this behavior?
B007P4YAPK,14,18,The app store for Apple is way better.
B007P4YAPK,14,19,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B007P4YAPK,14,20,This manual offers further assistance with the ASUS unit itself but also includes a useful Android user guide for those who aren't familiar with this operating system.
B007P4YAPK,14,21,They are a little faster than a laptop when first turing on, but I'm not impressed with tablets and am now researching which laptop to buy.
B007P4YAPK,14,22,Bought the tf701 everything was fine but was not impressed with it and got a Samsung Note 10.1 2014.Update...I did seem to find a fix to my problem with the ghost inputs. 2 days so far with me in control of my tablet.
B007P4YAPK,14,23,All the other features of this tablet can be compared favorably with all other apps on the market.
B007P4YAPK,14,24,In your hand something more squarish is easier to hold when you're talking about a 10" tablet, the longer the tablet the better for movies (in theory) but for everything else, and I mean everything, the 4:3 feels much more natural and is easier to hold.Again, I own this and I own an iPad -- I'm not an Apple fanboy and obviously I'm not an Android fanboy, I just want what is best I can get for my money and I can clearly state the iPad is a better device.
B007P4YAPK,15,0,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,15,1,But about a month ago, I noticed small little blotches in my screen that are white to greyish in color, but are only visible when the screen is displaying deep blacks.
B007P4YAPK,15,2,The screen sensitivity is very good though.
B007P4YAPK,15,3,Tablet two appeared to have a foreign object stuck under the glass of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,4,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B007P4YAPK,15,5,OK, but screen not bright enough for out doors and weak WiFi signal pickup.
B007P4YAPK,15,6,My screen is horrible i cannot use it in a dark room at all it looks horrible.
B007P4YAPK,15,7,The ASUS screen brightness was also a weak point, I had to take it out of the auto brightness mode and crank it up to get a decent brightness level even indoors, when placed next to the i-pad, the sharpness and the brightness weakness of the ASUS really stood out.
B007P4YAPK,15,8,I would have been fine if the color was washed out like the bottom or bright white like the top, but the gradient just annoyed me.
B007P4YAPK,15,9,This is actually my second TF300 that has had issues with the display as the first tablet I bought had really bad problems with what looks like bad contrasts that caused my screen to make very distinct graduations between colors when they were gradually going from a black to white like a fading sensation.
B007P4YAPK,15,10,Tablet three had a dead pixel near the center of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,11,However, the second one still had a dead pixel.
B007P4YAPK,15,12,But as soon as I restored my account and opened gmail (white background) I noticed a gradient in the "yellowness" or warmth of the screen from top to bottom!
B007P4YAPK,15,13,So I quickly bought an expensive screen protector since I was sure I would keep it.
B007P4YAPK,15,14,I got it from a shop, Worked well, but noticed a dead pixel on the first one.
B007P4YAPK,15,15,It was perfect, until several hours of use.When I turned the device on I noticed a bright spot on the bottom of the screen but I can live with it.
B007P4YAPK,15,16,Tablet one had a stuck-on pixel close to the center of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,17,How do YOU find the brightness (usually adjustable, if auto-brightness does not work well for you), the contrast, the sharpness?4 - Log into your email account and/or create a Gmail account.
B007P4YAPK,15,18,The screen quality is far superior to anything I've used previously, so I'm perfectly happy with it.
B007P4YAPK,15,19,I really can't point out the pros and cons at this point.
B007P4YAPK,15,20,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,15,21,I ordered blue and got black even though the box said blue.
B007P4YAPK,15,22,Not good when one of the touted features is the display.
B007P4YAPK,15,23,There are white spots everywhere around the edge.
B007P4YAPK,15,24,I doubt I'll ever need to use the tablet outside in bright sunlight, so I have no complaints other than the fact that there are two odd several inch horizontal smudges on the screen.
B007P4YAPK,16,0,glitchy without flash.
B007P4YAPK,16,1,I didn't have an opportunity to use it for the Amazon Prime Instant Videos before it stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,16,2,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,16,3,If I launch an app, I often have to wait up to 5 seconds before I can even interact with anything in the app.
B007P4YAPK,16,4,The app store for Apple is way better.
B007P4YAPK,16,5,I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app.
B007P4YAPK,16,6,Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you.
B007P4YAPK,16,7,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B007P4YAPK,16,8,I am not talking about just app crashing, but for some reason apps cause the whole system to reboot.
B007P4YAPK,16,9,I download audio books from the library so am not next to the tablet all the time.
B007P4YAPK,16,10,This time I'm posting a video on YOUTUBE to show them what it's doing.
B007P4YAPK,16,11,I bought this to stream Netflix and Amazon movies.
B007P4YAPK,16,12,While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps.
B007P4YAPK,16,13,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,16,14,This happens for multiple apps, which is why I suspect the problem is NOT the applications.The crashing needs to be fixed.
B007P4YAPK,16,15,I got this fixed simply installing the app "juicy defender plus"Tegra 3 compatibility issues with several games, most of them fixed after rebooting, the game just freeze after 10-15 seconds.
B007P4YAPK,16,16,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,16,17,Half of the video is visible, half of it appears to be playing underneath the embedded video widget on a web page.Google services:I'm used to flawless integration with Google services on Android devices.
B007P4YAPK,16,18,Once an app is running and in-focus, it runs fine.
B007P4YAPK,16,19,some times I get unresponsive messages, or some other times my browser just close out.Browser issues, I tried them all, skyfire, chrome, firefox beta, browser ICS, opera, dolphin all of them behave erratically randomly.Screen quality is so so, not as great as tf201 and overall not better(visually) than tf101some google play store apps/games no longer worked.
B007P4YAPK,16,20,This tablet wont accept or download flashIt often wont refresh programs and locks up and needs to be restarted.After a month the firmware still won't download
B007P4YAPK,16,21,For example, I have had many problems with it having programs and applications stop working, or I have had times where I am unable to select things on it.
B007P4YAPK,16,22,Good visual, BUT people should know that Android newer versions is not Adobe Flash capable so if you (for instance) want to hook it to your TV using HDMI you better have a geek friend who can download a different Flash player.
B007P4YAPK,16,23,I'm not a big gamer just want to do basic email, web, and the occasional game or video.
B007P4YAPK,16,24,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,17,0,ok for the money.
B007P4YAPK,17,1,Overall I'm disappointed and would not buy again.
B007P4YAPK,17,2,I don't know if this usually happens with other tablets but i will never buy another asus
B007P4YAPK,17,3,I bought this in May and I waited until now to review this product so I know I have tried everything there is to it.
B007P4YAPK,17,4,Buy another brand!
B007P4YAPK,17,5,This was purchased expecting it to last well.
B007P4YAPK,17,6,Don't buy.
B007P4YAPK,17,7,I did get money back since I purchased warranty from square trade.
B007P4YAPK,17,8,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,17,9,Properly will buy IPAD next time.
B007P4YAPK,17,10,It died only 6 months after purchase KEEP AWAY FROM ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,17,11,When I bought it there was no re-manufactured warning, instead I guess these is a tablet returned and then resold.
B007P4YAPK,17,12,Please do yourself a favor and don't waste your money.*****
B007P4YAPK,17,13,not as good as the reviews.
B007P4YAPK,17,14,My one year with the TF300T has been a very disappointing one.
B007P4YAPK,17,15,Sent both back and company refunded part of my money.
B007P4YAPK,17,16,BUT the fact that my children are playing on my ipad more than this tablet makes me want to get my money back for it and go buy another ipad for them!!Right now - this tablet is horrible - hence why they are only getting 2 stars from me - if i could give it a 0 I probably would since we really can't even use it right now.
B007P4YAPK,17,17,Product needs work.
B007P4YAPK,17,18,While I was not expecting the same performance of the more expensive ipad, I never expected such a poor performing tablet as the asus 300tf.
B007P4YAPK,17,19,Disappointed.
B007P4YAPK,17,20,This is likely my last ASUS purchase, but I will be using Square Trade again!I forgot to mention, ASUS has no regard toward protecting identity theft.
B007P4YAPK,17,21,I buy a replacement tablet, I'll be sure to buy a tablet with Gorilla Glass such as the ASUS TF700 Infinity or perhaps something by another manufacturer.
B007P4YAPK,17,22,Its ok if you use it just for that but dont expect this to do anything more.
B007P4YAPK,17,23,I bought that tablet for my 8 years old son  to play games,  it freezes very often, my son has been keeping told me the "Tablet needs to see the doctor".
B007P4YAPK,17,24,Fortunately we purchased this with a third-party warranty.
B007P4YAPK,18,0,It would charge then stop charging in a contual cycle.
B007P4YAPK,18,1,I tried some temp fixes to try and get it charged again.
B007P4YAPK,18,2,Another charger is $30--will I have the same problen with that one?
B007P4YAPK,18,3,Bad charger-seems to be a problem.... Tablet worked well until I tried to charge it after its first battery drain the first day of use.
B007P4YAPK,18,4,Powerful and has a good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,18,5,When the battery is very low, even if it's plugged in, you cannot turn it on for 5 minutes or so until it charges up a little (not sure this is specific to only this tablet).5.
B007P4YAPK,18,6,They all DO NOT charge when plugged in, which eventually runs down the battery in the tablet when you are trying to use both as a unit.
B007P4YAPK,18,7,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B007P4YAPK,18,8,The fully charged battery dies within couple of hours of continuous use.
B007P4YAPK,18,9,After 7-9 minutes this tablet turn back to the home screen or just plane shuts down.
B007P4YAPK,18,10,Put the charger in the freezer to reset the thermal breaker--yes it worked, so far..... Currently it is charging.
B007P4YAPK,18,11,really wanted this to work.
B007P4YAPK,18,12,But start from yesterday, I can't even turn on my tablet.
B007P4YAPK,18,13,I placed an order for a new cable on Amazon.com to try while Asus take their time to replace the broken one.Startup is slow and takes a long time to charge.
B007P4YAPK,18,14,This makes the battery last a maximum of an hour when you are trying to use the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,18,15,See how long the battery lasts.
B007P4YAPK,18,16,First, the tablet takes too long to get started when turn it on, slow navigation and finaly after 3 months it begun to turn on and off automatically until the battery got over.. it happened over and over again and i had to ask for a new one.
B007P4YAPK,18,17,Screen tearing started occurring within a couple of days.
B007P4YAPK,18,18,ASUS needs to fix the charger isssue!
B007P4YAPK,18,19,Reboot by itself and doesn't want to turn on again.
B007P4YAPK,18,20,Then, I need to wait for several hours in order to turn it on back.
B007P4YAPK,18,21,In 3 months the tablet didn't work correctly.
B007P4YAPK,18,22,Not long after I got it, it started to give me problems.
B007P4YAPK,18,23,The tablet did a firmware update the first time I turned it on.
B007P4YAPK,18,24,Battery life is poor - I have to recharge it all the time.
B007P4YAPK,19,0,Quality control issue.
B007P4YAPK,19,1,I was trying in several environments to discard any sound source, but always it recorded the sound with the whistle.
B007P4YAPK,19,2,Bad video recording sound.
B007P4YAPK,19,3,But I noticed the replacement has a different issue: a gap along the bezzel on the left side of the screen near the volume button.
B007P4YAPK,19,4,Awesome tablet, plagued by quality control issues.
B007P4YAPK,19,5,(You can get a $100 tablet from Pandigital, etc. that will stream video and audio at the same pace quality.)Also,
B007P4YAPK,19,6,ASUS definitely needs better quality control.
B007P4YAPK,19,7,The build quality of the unit is an issue and should be recalled.
B007P4YAPK,19,8,The applications all downloaded easily and work well, I bought an external speaker to listen through the speakers on the tablet are fine.
B007P4YAPK,19,9,I Buy ASUS TF300 in nov/2012, it is very good product... almost, I got a problem: When I video recording, it is recording the video with a whistle sound included...
B007P4YAPK,19,10,It very well could be a lemon and not indicative of ASUS quality control, but it has left a bad taste in my mouth.
B007P4YAPK,19,11,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,19,12,I discovered it problem disappeared when I video recorded while I was charging the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,19,13,The speakers are OK, but don't get very loud but they're acceptable.
B007P4YAPK,19,14,But on the other hand, it feels cheap.
B007P4YAPK,19,15,Build issues killed it for me.
B007P4YAPK,19,16,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,19,17,How the wear was so great as to cause cracking of plastic is beyond me.
B007P4YAPK,19,18,It's wide enough to notice easily.
B007P4YAPK,19,19,The build quality was much better, everything aligned and in place.
B007P4YAPK,19,20,On this, it's a hard plastic, and it creaks.
B007P4YAPK,19,21,Tablet two appeared to have a foreign object stuck under the glass of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,19,22,The touch screen is non-responsive at times and when it does work it begins to freeze, skip and jump.
B007P4YAPK,19,23,I sent it in to ASUS for review and they stated - "Nothing found - no repairs necessary."
B007P4YAPK,19,24,Clearly there are quality issues with it!
B007P4YAPK,20,0,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B007P4YAPK,20,1,Especially near the forward facing camera.
B007P4YAPK,20,2,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,20,3,While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.
B007P4YAPK,20,4,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,20,5,Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera.
B007P4YAPK,20,6,Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as "floaters" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,20,7,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,20,8,Does the auto spelling correct work well for you?
B007P4YAPK,20,9,The screen sensitivity is very good though.
B007P4YAPK,20,10,I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.
B007P4YAPK,20,11,It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly.
B007P4YAPK,20,12,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B007P4YAPK,20,13,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,20,14,Everything worked fine for the first night but the next day the unit began to crash on me and restart on its own will.
B007P4YAPK,20,15,It's not a super high resolution display, so the individual pixels are pretty good sized, and this was pretty noticeable.
B007P4YAPK,20,16,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,20,17,The touch screen is non-responsive at times and when it does work it begins to freeze, skip and jump.
B007P4YAPK,20,18,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,20,19,After getting used to the i-pad quality and functionality, it's hard accepting something less.
B007P4YAPK,20,20,Okay... crash, restart working.
B007P4YAPK,20,21,On the downside, the rear speaker is pretty marginal and poorly placed.
B007P4YAPK,20,22,As I stated above it worked perfectly for the first 2 weeks and since...well let's list what has gone wrong.1)
B007P4YAPK,20,23,I got it from a shop, Worked well, but noticed a dead pixel on the first one.
B007P4YAPK,20,24,It seems different on a cell phone compared to a Tablets because of the distance of going back and forth across the tablet screen.
B007P4YAPK,21,0,Too slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,1,Besides quad core the tablet is very slow in response.
B007P4YAPK,21,2,It single handedly promotes slow boot up as well as weak app performance and slow sync.
B007P4YAPK,21,3,No touch screen, but with the speed diff, I will use it from now on.
B007P4YAPK,21,4,There are not enough tablet optimized Apps, but many stretched out phone Apps... Jelly Bean is slow and not very responsive while multi-tasking.
B007P4YAPK,21,5,The browsers are not very responsive too.
B007P4YAPK,21,6,When I end-task on some Apps, they relaunch at same state.
B007P4YAPK,21,7,disappointed in the performance.
B007P4YAPK,21,8,update:  I find the speed of this product to be too slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,9,Quite slow with stock ROM.
B007P4YAPK,21,10,I would expect it to do a lot and very fast but it hangs and is very slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,11,It may have a quadcore, lots of ram, and a nice GPU in it, but all this hardware is useless because Jelly Bean cannot utilize the hardware very well.
B007P4YAPK,21,12,It does not shutdown like others have put it but I would not call it a highend quad core processor.
B007P4YAPK,21,13,If they are critical to the OS, then these Apps should be hidden.
B007P4YAPK,21,14,Performance is quite decent.
B007P4YAPK,21,15,I am also very disappointed with NVDia, this processor is a piece of crap.
B007P4YAPK,21,16,My iPad 2 is fast, reliable, great looking Apps, and very responsive to EVERYTHING.
B007P4YAPK,21,17,This tablet just isn't worth the money if you wanna waatch videos; the processor is too slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,18,I find the periodic firmware updates from Asus a bit annoying as they do not really improve any of the app performances.
B007P4YAPK,21,19,It just seems that background processing and context-switching is very poor in this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,21,20,That is the same performance I expect from a tablet and this ASUS never has, not even when new.
B007P4YAPK,21,21,The Jelly Bean OS don't have well control over the running Apps.
B007P4YAPK,21,22,I have to reboot the tablet periodically to regain performance.This sluggishness doesn't make it unusable.
B007P4YAPK,21,23,I have an old Lenovo... and it speeds through everything.
B007P4YAPK,21,24,Cold reboot is the only way to close all the Apps completely.
B007P4YAPK,22,0,I have no SD card installed.
B007P4YAPK,22,1,I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts.
B007P4YAPK,22,2,I am ordering the micro SD card to boost additionally the speed and, of course, get more memory.
B007P4YAPK,22,3,I aim to leave the internal memory primarily for apps and app data - I'm sure it will take many years for me to even approach filling it up.Android 4 (ICS) is an absolute joy to use, much better than I anticipated.
B007P4YAPK,22,4,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,22,5,Plenty of storage space.
B007P4YAPK,22,6,HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6.
B007P4YAPK,22,7,I would probably buy another one but from a store that you could go back to if you have problems.
B007P4YAPK,22,8,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,22,9,After a lot of headache trying to get Cyanogenmod, I gave up and put instead Cromi-X.
B007P4YAPK,22,10,However, after the OS get updated by JellyBean, my tablet starts to shut down (reboot) by itself.
B007P4YAPK,22,11,from day one I have had trouble with the device being a little slow and if I let things get backed up it'll crash.
B007P4YAPK,22,12,I don't find this a problem at all.
B007P4YAPK,22,13,If I launch an app, I often have to wait up to 5 seconds before I can even interact with anything in the app.
B007P4YAPK,22,14,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,22,15,Cold reboot is the only way to close all the Apps completely.
B007P4YAPK,22,16,Just stuff like that gets pretty annoying pretty fast.
B007P4YAPK,22,17,I am not talking about just app crashing, but for some reason apps cause the whole system to reboot.
B007P4YAPK,22,18,Restarting the device fixed the problem temporarily.
B007P4YAPK,22,19,If they are critical to the OS, then these Apps should be hidden.
B007P4YAPK,22,20,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,22,21,The only other small problem I've had is when maximizing Youtube videos to full-screen - sometimes it doesn't play correctly, (EDIT 070612 -- the Youtube App automatically updated recently and I no longer sometimes have a problem with maximizing video - it works perfectly now every time.)I've
B007P4YAPK,22,22,did have a few teething problems, (nothing to do with the unit, but rather my own stupidity.)
B007P4YAPK,22,23,Okay... crash, restart working.
B007P4YAPK,22,24,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,23,0,And also the internet will not convert for some reason and I have to restart it for it to connect.
B007P4YAPK,23,1,Now, mind you that I have a wifi router 2 feet from me and a perfect wifi connection.
B007P4YAPK,23,2,Annoying problems.
B007P4YAPK,23,3,Apps, browser and native email program freeze up all the time, probably about 10-20% of the time.3.
B007P4YAPK,23,4,According to them ASUS is not doing anything to fix the problem.
B007P4YAPK,23,5,The touch screen is non-responsive at times and when it does work it begins to freeze, skip and jump.
B007P4YAPK,23,6,Too slow.
B007P4YAPK,23,7,Generally the ASUS is ok, but it had a hard time picking up a strong wi-fi signal at home so the download was too slow and sometimes it would time out, while the i-pad had a full signal strength.
B007P4YAPK,23,8,It doesn't matter which browser I'm using (default browser, Firefox, Firefox Beta) it crashes.
B007P4YAPK,23,9,My wifi connection rarely registers a full signal even though I use the tablet in the same room as the router most of the time.7.
B007P4YAPK,23,10,From a cursory bit of research on the Internet, it seems that TRIM is not implemented properly, and this is what causes the performance problems.
B007P4YAPK,23,11,from day one I have had trouble with the device being a little slow and if I let things get backed up it'll crash.
B007P4YAPK,23,12,First off, very quickly, the problems with the browser will not be addressed by asus.
B007P4YAPK,23,13,When it does work it works well but it's so rare when that happens.
B007P4YAPK,23,14,I am not sure if this is related to the performance problem or not, but there are always major slowdowns just before a crash-to-reboot.
B007P4YAPK,23,15,Previously, I owned a kindle fire which was slow, a bit clunky and unresponsive while web browsing.
B007P4YAPK,23,16,SPASTIC OS, intermittent wi-fi disconnection.
B007P4YAPK,23,17,There are serious performance problems which are only temporarily solved by a factory reset.
B007P4YAPK,23,18,You WILL experience a drop; It's not a matter of IF, but rather, only a matter of WHEN.
B007P4YAPK,23,19,Once I turned it back on, it was fine and it never happened again.It had a GPS, but the only time it would show me my location was when I would connected to a Wifi signal.
B007P4YAPK,23,20,The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router.
B007P4YAPK,23,21,That’s a false crutch and it still doesn’t solve this unit’s intermittent Wi-Fi failure.
B007P4YAPK,23,22,First the browser is practically worthless it constantly crashes with the message "Browser is not responding.
B007P4YAPK,23,23,After the first update on the tablet the screens started freezing in the middle of games, on the internet, etc...it is really annoying and very difficult to explain to your child why it does that when they are just trying to enjoy their new tablet.3)
B007P4YAPK,23,24,For example, I'd totally forgotten I'd enabled MAC Address Filtering on my wireless router, so couldn't connect the ASUS at first until I wised up.
B007P4YAPK,24,0,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,24,1,The touch screen stopped responding but for awhile I could dock it to the keyboard and it would respond.
B007P4YAPK,24,2,Back in mid-July I was on the couch using the tablet (without the keyboard) when the touch screen just stopped responding.
B007P4YAPK,24,3,The touch screen is non-responsive at times and when it does work it begins to freeze, skip and jump.
B007P4YAPK,24,4,The touch screen became completely unresponsive I had to attach the keyboard so I could enter my password and log on.
B007P4YAPK,24,5,Kept getting touches not registering, and phantom touches registering where I wasn't touching.They sent the same unit back with the same problems.
B007P4YAPK,24,6,Faulty keyboard when it arriveed.
B007P4YAPK,24,7,After waking it up it may take 5-10 seconds before it starts responding to touching the screen.
B007P4YAPK,24,8,Problem is....even if I am not even touching that area it is now doing it.
B007P4YAPK,24,9,There are several others who have had the cracked screen problem.
B007P4YAPK,24,10,Perhaps a week after the update, my keyboard on the dock stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,24,11,Another issue is the keyboard, while it is really nice to have and actually works well, the keyboard has 4 anti-slip rubber bumbers under it to keep it put while using it, but once you attach the tablet/monitor, the keyboard attaching pocket would have to be swung up from one end while the other end swings down below the keyboard level thus lifting the keyboard from one end making the rear 2 of the rubber anti-slip bumpers ineffective, and the unit now slips easily.
B007P4YAPK,24,12,And it wasn't touch responsive.
B007P4YAPK,24,13,Since it is both the docking station/keyboard and the tablet I don't know what I will get back... rebuilt or new?
B007P4YAPK,24,14,Although I didn't buy it, I like the docking keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,24,15,Other times, I need to click, click, click click click.
B007P4YAPK,24,16,This was it... until it stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,24,17,It still accepts input via the touchpad and mouse key, only the keyboard keys stopped functioning.
B007P4YAPK,24,18,I like the idea of the keyboard dock with the mouse and I like that you can hook-up things like blue-tooth gaming pads - that is something the iPad really needs to allow, both the mouse if you have a keyboard attached and game pads.Summary - buy an iPad - it's better in every way.
B007P4YAPK,24,19,It would also cause the virtual keyboard to shake up and down rapidly.2.
B007P4YAPK,24,20,Update: I gave this another few days, and really tried to work through the unresponsive touch, and the lags, stalls, etc. Nothing helped.
B007P4YAPK,24,21,Without the dock it's better but still seems to drain at least 10-15% a day, meaning it will be dead within a week even if you don't use it at all.
B007P4YAPK,24,22,For the Transformer, if it's in the dock, it dies within 2 days of not being used.
B007P4YAPK,24,23,If I touch in the top left corner of the screen it will bring the power off message up and reboot.
B007P4YAPK,24,24,And in several games, the tablet frequently stutters or pauses for several seconds in the middle of it all.Tablet touch sensitivity:The tablet has a very hard time registering clicks.
B007P4YAPK,25,0,There are many ugly Apps that do not work well.
B007P4YAPK,25,1,I then began setting it to my liking (e.g., arranging apps on screens, etc.
B007P4YAPK,25,2,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,25,3,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,25,4,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,25,5,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,25,6,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B007P4YAPK,25,7,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,25,8,All the great reviews made me believe this tablet might work out of the box.
B007P4YAPK,25,9,When I end-task on some Apps, they relaunch at same state.
B007P4YAPK,25,10,When not frozen, tapping an app would sometimes work, but more often would execute an entirely different app (note they were not at all near each other on the screen).
B007P4YAPK,25,11,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,25,12,Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,25,13,All the other features of this tablet can be compared favorably with all other apps on the market.
B007P4YAPK,25,14,Not sure if this is a hardware issue or an Android issue but I'm baffled at the sluggishness of the thing.
B007P4YAPK,25,15,The iPad is a superior device in every single way, from the screen, to performance to apps to battery life.Here's my review.I had the retina iPad for a while before I picked up this tablet, I knew it wasn't a high resolution screen going in so it wasn't a shock but I was still surprised at how quickly I got use to the iPad screen, the Transformer screen doesn't compare at all.
B007P4YAPK,25,16,If they are critical to the OS, then these Apps should be hidden.
B007P4YAPK,25,17,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,25,18,I liked it and bought another only to have it start doing the same thing on and off and no I was not Hacked.
B007P4YAPK,25,19,On the bad side, many of the apps do not work on this, they complain that its not compatible with the device.
B007P4YAPK,25,20,Product needs work.
B007P4YAPK,25,21,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,25,22,If I launch an app, I often have to wait up to 5 seconds before I can even interact with anything in the app.
B007P4YAPK,25,23,ASUS TF300 Software.
B007P4YAPK,25,24,I don't find this a problem at all.
B007P4YAPK,26,0,Plugging in a micro hdmi cord was a little difficult due to this, and I am sure the port would break off if i did it often.
B007P4YAPK,26,1,Even the center port, where the tablet actually interacts with the keyboard cracked.
B007P4YAPK,26,2,It would charge then stop charging in a contual cycle.
B007P4YAPK,26,3,Then, 2-3 months later, the connector ports that hold the tablet to the optional keyboard started showing signs of stress.
B007P4YAPK,26,4,You must go online to find a cable.
B007P4YAPK,26,5,I am sure I wouldn't notice it if I didn't look extremely carefully, and it wasn't much of a problem to me but the hdmi port was misaligned from its socket!
B007P4YAPK,26,6,This eventually led to a small crack along the back of the tablet between the two ports.
B007P4YAPK,26,7,Once the plastic adjacent the hinge broke off, the hinge was very loose and damaged the connector between the keyboard and the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,26,8,I had to separately order a power supply chord because without the chord I can only use it until it ran out of power.
B007P4YAPK,26,9,HDMI out is a bit flaky.
B007P4YAPK,26,10,Just stuff like that gets pretty annoying pretty fast.
B007P4YAPK,26,11,I love the android slide touch keyboard that comes with it.
B007P4YAPK,26,12,ASUS does not stand behind their products.
B007P4YAPK,26,13,Overall I'm disappointed and would not buy again.
B007P4YAPK,26,14,This is likely my last ASUS purchase, but I will be using Square Trade again!I forgot to mention, ASUS has no regard toward protecting identity theft.
B007P4YAPK,26,15,I like the idea of the keyboard dock with the mouse and I like that you can hook-up things like blue-tooth gaming pads - that is something the iPad really needs to allow, both the mouse if you have a keyboard attached and game pads.Summary - buy an iPad - it's better in every way.
B007P4YAPK,26,16,Issues with charger cable - loose fit.
B007P4YAPK,26,17,In addition to submitting a payment form w/ credit card information, they require everyone to scan the front and back of their credit card and drivers license and include them as well.
B007P4YAPK,26,18,Approximately 3-4 months after purchase, my tablet would reboot by itself whenever I touched it.
B007P4YAPK,26,19,They all DO NOT charge when plugged in, which eventually runs down the battery in the tablet when you are trying to use both as a unit.
B007P4YAPK,26,20,The touch screen stopped responding but for awhile I could dock it to the keyboard and it would respond.
B007P4YAPK,26,21,it's a pretty good product.
B007P4YAPK,26,22,from day one I have had trouble with the device being a little slow and if I let things get backed up it'll crash.
B007P4YAPK,26,23,The app store for Apple is way better.
B007P4YAPK,26,24,Great panoramic pictures while we vacationed in Colorado.The charger cable doesn't fit well into the ASUS tablet and will not charge unless I hold it at a certain angle.
B007P4YAPK,27,0,Okay... crash, restart working.
B007P4YAPK,27,1,I liked it and bought another only to have it start doing the same thing on and off and no I was not Hacked.
B007P4YAPK,27,2,Except perhaps the toaster.This tablet crashes constantly.
B007P4YAPK,27,3,constant crashing.
B007P4YAPK,27,4,After a week this problem began to worsen and after two weeks the screen became unusable.
B007P4YAPK,27,5,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,27,6,Then crash, and so I uninstall the app.
B007P4YAPK,27,7,I was more frustrated with the crashing and I am not feeling the love.
B007P4YAPK,27,8,Once I turned it back on, it was fine and it never happened again.It had a GPS, but the only time it would show me my location was when I would connected to a Wifi signal.
B007P4YAPK,27,9,LCD went bad after 4 weeks of use.
B007P4YAPK,27,10,I have tried to find the issue with the system log with no real success, though it looks like the garbage collection is failing.
B007P4YAPK,27,11,Then I started installing apps, which at first was a joyful experience.
B007P4YAPK,27,12,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,27,13,Asus TF300, I owned it for about a month before I sent it Back.
B007P4YAPK,27,14,Put it on the dock crash.
B007P4YAPK,27,15,some minor issues.
B007P4YAPK,27,16,It disappeared after some time without using it.
B007P4YAPK,27,17,The last two weeks, it has become unusable!
B007P4YAPK,27,18,electronic bug in the system keeps messing with my tablet.
B007P4YAPK,27,19,I though I should be able to use it in my car like a GPS, but I guess not.
B007P4YAPK,27,20,Screen tearing started occurring within a couple of days.
B007P4YAPK,27,21,It took me a few minutes to actually be able to get the tablet to turn off.
B007P4YAPK,27,22,The touch screen is non-responsive at times and when it does work it begins to freeze, skip and jump.
B007P4YAPK,27,23,and since it was nearly unusable before unlocking it, it is also now without a warranty.
B007P4YAPK,27,24,Screen tearing issues.
B007P4YAPK,28,0,Tweaked Out with no Support.
B007P4YAPK,28,1,I called customer support and they were no help.
B007P4YAPK,28,2,Incomplete product without a chord.
B007P4YAPK,28,3,It was returned to ASUS under warranty.
B007P4YAPK,28,4,I contacted Asus and they said it was a manufacturer defect and to return it.
B007P4YAPK,28,5,I sent the unit in for repair and it was returned without the problems being addressed.
B007P4YAPK,28,6,Poor customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,7,Product needs work.
B007P4YAPK,28,8,I have not called customer service yet as I keep hoping they will fix these issues with another update.
B007P4YAPK,28,9,I received the tablet and a few days later had problems with it.
B007P4YAPK,28,10,RETURNED
B007P4YAPK,28,11,According to them ASUS is not doing anything to fix the problem.
B007P4YAPK,28,12,Not sure why this happened so i did a hard reset and called the customer support which was terrible and of no help which i could not find online.
B007P4YAPK,28,13,I otherwise like the product it is very responsive.
B007P4YAPK,28,14,Also Amazon provided a credit for the $3.99 shipping charge because of the issues with the carrier.
B007P4YAPK,28,15,Of course, the Amazon return window had expired about a week before so I contacted ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,28,16,By then it was too late to return the device.
B007P4YAPK,28,17,So far I've sent it in to ASUS for repair twice (and going back for the third time today) - but they still haven't been able to fix it.
B007P4YAPK,28,18,I sent it in to ASUS for review and they stated - "Nothing found - no repairs necessary."
B007P4YAPK,28,19,Evidently I bought the tablet from "Amazon Wharehouse" which can not be returned after 30 days.
B007P4YAPK,28,20,I called ASUS and they issued an RMA, stating that it was likely a short in the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,28,21,I mean big deal if it has problems but I would like Amazon to help me then.
B007P4YAPK,28,22,Thankfully, I also bought a Squaretrade warranty for my unit at the time of my tablet purchase so I contacted them and they are currently processing a full refund for me after receiving my unit and stating that a repair is not possible.If
B007P4YAPK,28,23,Update *****After sending the unit in a second time (between both, I was without it for around a month), they finally sent it back mostly fixed.
B007P4YAPK,28,24,ASUS does not stand behind their products.
B007P4YAPK,29,0,Screen tearing issues.
B007P4YAPK,29,1,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,29,2,Some of the problem is probably Windows stuff but the Windows machines don't even see the tablet but the tablet sees the Windows machines.
B007P4YAPK,29,3,Restarting the device fixed the problem temporarily.
B007P4YAPK,29,4,There are several others who have had the cracked screen problem.
B007P4YAPK,29,5,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,29,6,However, after the OS get updated by JellyBean, my tablet starts to shut down (reboot) by itself.
B007P4YAPK,29,7,I've also seen it scroll across 2 or more screens when I only want to scroll across 1, or just completely drop scrolling actions.
B007P4YAPK,29,8,They are hardware issues.
B007P4YAPK,29,9,There are many ugly Apps that do not work well.
B007P4YAPK,29,10,When it does work it works well but it's so rare when that happens.
B007P4YAPK,29,11,Not sure if this is a hardware issue or an Android issue but I'm baffled at the sluggishness of the thing.
B007P4YAPK,29,12,Then I was prompted to do a firmware update.
B007P4YAPK,29,13,If they are critical to the OS, then these Apps should be hidden.
B007P4YAPK,29,14,I can't tell if all of these issues are completely software or issues with the tablet input itself, but the end result is a very frustrating navigation experience.Stability:My tablet crashes at least once daily.
B007P4YAPK,29,15,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,29,16,Networks are always a pain.The hardware seems to work great but the software is weak.
B007P4YAPK,29,17,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,29,18,Annoying problems.
B007P4YAPK,29,19,I don't know what caused the crack, since the week prior to the tablet's sudden demise it wasn't dropped, exposed to heat, or wasn't sat upon (except maybe the cat sat on it when I wasn't looking).
B007P4YAPK,29,20,Cold reboot is the only way to close all the Apps completely.
B007P4YAPK,29,21,The touch screen is non-responsive at times and when it does work it begins to freeze, skip and jump.
B007P4YAPK,29,22,however I started experiencing some screen flickering, the task bar jumps up and down, on the left side of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,29,23,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,29,24,I have to awkwardly use my left index finger, and even then a lot of the motion gets dropped or garbled.
