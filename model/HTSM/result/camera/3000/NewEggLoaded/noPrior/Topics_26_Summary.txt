You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.	-5.026
One great feature is being able to magnify the sceen image to 4.8X or even 9.5X after the camera has auto-focused on subject, by turning the focusing ring on the lens.......this can also be done with a telescopic lens by tapping the image on the touch screen.	-5.083

My Canon batteries charge from empty to full power in under 2 hours.-	-5.022
So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?	-5.125
This needs to be corrected!!! Also, Sony's new thing with their cameras is that they will ONLY take a Sony battery.	-5.286

To combat this, you need to hold the adapter or lens with your left hand.	-5.204
For this reason, it is inevitable and also advantageous to use one's dSLR lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.I am able to use my Nikon F-mount lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.	-5.289
