After it focuses you can also manually fine-tune the focus to your object.	-4.133
I have the 18-55mm and 55-210mm lenses.PROS* Sony's Focus Peaking feature makes manual focus really easy for manual first-timers like me.	-4.442

You buy a $600 camera and the stupid developers can't even implement sequential file numbers for video files--only photos.	-4.603
I couldn't have taken it with the R1.And the video.	-4.689

The image quality of this new sensor put in the 5N is extraordinary.	-4.382
the lenses make noise, and focus is slow.on the nex, the lenses are silent for focus, and it focuses instantly.	-4.441

With the NEX-5N, I have to press Menu, scroll to Shoot Mode, scroll from iAuto to Program mode, press Menu again (because selecting another shooting mode kicks you out), select the Brightness/Color menu, scroll to DRO/Auto HDR option and select Auto HDR (or other DRO/HDR mode).	-4.164
Having the two cameras set up differently means not having to fumble around trying to change menu settings btw auto and manual while on a shoot.	-4.369

I purchased a 3-d party (Wasabi) battery pack (two NP-FW50 batteries, one Wasabi AC charger, one car charger converter for Wasabi AC charger, European converter) which works well with my NEX-5N.	-4.458

In good light even a P&S; is good enough, but the light rarely good when you really need it.	-3.591
Other than that, it is a great camera especially in low light.	-3.763
