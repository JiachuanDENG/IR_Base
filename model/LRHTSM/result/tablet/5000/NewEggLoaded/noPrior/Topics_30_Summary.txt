One of the problems- Every time I clicked on any link/button to install flash, the device would take me to the play store and tell me flash wasn't available.I eventually found an application that requires flash, downloaded it, and let it install flash automatically, thus bypassing all automatic links to the google play store.However, once flash player is installed, it still doesn't work as well as a PC with the sites I frequent (rosetta stone, amazon).	-5.508
It touch screen system is perfact.	-5.573
Took me a short while to find the flash download and get it installed.	-5.626
