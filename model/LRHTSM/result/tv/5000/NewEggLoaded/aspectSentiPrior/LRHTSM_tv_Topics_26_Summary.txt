B0074FGLUM,3,3,Poor customer service.
B0074FGLUM,3,4,Now i have to wait another week for someone to come out and service it.
B0074FGLUM,3,5,before I ordered and received the goods at the time and was pleased.

B0074FGLUM,3,7,and I WANTED this TV (and usually love Amazon).
B0074FGLUM,3,8,I replaced with a new Lg that works great.
B0074FGLUM,3,9,I received this TV well within time of delivery.
B0074FGLUM,3,10,But we will think twice before buying anything from amazon.
B0074FGLUM,3,11,Will never buy a TV from Amazon.
B0074FGLUM,3,12,ok let me say this came in fast and also was packaged great.
B0074FGLUM,3,13,Amazon was good in handling the return.
B0074FGLUM,3,14,The Amazon customer service does nothing except saying 'they will pick it up dont worry'Everytime I talk with a new lady at amazon customer service and she cant do anything about it except giving us a hope that UPS will pick up(damaged tv).We even got an email from amazon stating that if we dont return the damaged tv before the said date they will charge us 480$.
B0074FGLUM,3,15,Ordered twice - both damaged.
B0074FGLUM,3,16,satisfied customer.

B0074FGLUM,4,19,Not as good.
B0074FGLUM,4,20,If you make the mistake it's an easy fix.I found the picture quality to be good but not great.

B0074FGLUM,6,11,Smart tv apps and Internet work great.
B0074FGLUM,6,12,The interface/UI for the app is quite nice, when it actually works.
B0074FGLUM,6,13,Great picture.
B0074FGLUM,6,14,really good, not quite great.
B0074FGLUM,6,15,works with amazon prime - great picture - limited apps.
B0074FGLUM,6,16,All the APPS work as expected and the picture is very good.
B0074FGLUM,6,17,Great picture, the apps are slow.
B0074FGLUM,6,18,Otherwise, it is a very good TV, and I love it.
B0074FGLUM,6,19,Great picture2.)
B0074FGLUM,6,20,Love love love it.
B0074FGLUM,6,21,The tv works great but it took me forever to get it to work.
B0074FGLUM,6,22,The WI-FI also works great.
B0074FGLUM,6,23,WATCH OUT FOR MISSING PARTS.
B0074FGLUM,6,24,I love it!
B0074FGLUM,7,0,So all you see after you hook it up are the HDMI cables looping trying to get behind the TV.
B0074FGLUM,7,1,Do away with cable!!
B0074FGLUM,7,2,Great picture, works right out of the box.
B0074FGLUM,7,3,Great TV and picture after you get the settings right.
B0074FGLUM,7,4,HDMI ports plus a component input.-Price
B0074FGLUM,7,5,Great picture!
B0074FGLUM,7,6,My internet connection is very good so it is not the connection it's the tv
B0074FGLUM,7,7,This TV has a good picture and good sound quality.
B0074FGLUM,7,8,Good but not great.
B0074FGLUM,7,9,My DVD I connected with an AV cable I had but could not get it to work.
B0074FGLUM,7,10,nice picture, not enough ports.
B0074FGLUM,7,11,Nice HDTV but out of the box it needs work.
B0074FGLUM,7,12,The picture is great.
B0074FGLUM,7,13,I have a wii and an old dvd player so I can only hook up one.
B0074FGLUM,7,14,This one only has hdmi and 1 a/v.
B0074FGLUM,7,15,The HDMI connection with only work with Samsung DVD players, Samsung computers, etc. and will not work for devices using the HDMI cable everyone else in the industry uses.
B0074FGLUM,7,16,I was surprised to see how few inputs there were...usually TV's have like 3 hdmi, plus regular a/v, component, etc.
B0074FGLUM,7,17,Perfect as a 2nd TV or to be used with a PC using the TV's HDMI port connected to the DVI out on the PC.
B0074FGLUM,7,18,There are three HDMI ports, although there is no S-Video port.
B0074FGLUM,7,19,It has plenty of ports to connect HDMI competent etc.
B0074FGLUM,7,20,I usually just hook up my laptop to it, but there are some great features to it nonetheless.
B0074FGLUM,7,21,The sound is not the best but connected to sound on computer it works just fine.
B0074FGLUM,7,22,I like the picture quality and the remote features, but after setting it up and connecting it to our antenna the reception has been poor, especially on local channels.
B0074FGLUM,7,23,The picture and sound quality are both great too!
B0074FGLUM,7,24,Instead one can go for a HD tv and all these can be streamed fron DVD players or any other game devices.
B0074FGLUM,8,0,Sound quality.
B0074FGLUM,8,1,For a TV I always praise Samsung for the picture quality and this is the same!
B0074FGLUM,8,2,My previous Samsung 46" 640 has a much better picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,8,3,Picture quality is good.
B0074FGLUM,8,4,Great for tje price.
B0074FGLUM,8,5,Used to buy Sony but I seem to like the Samsung picture quality better lately.
B0074FGLUM,8,6,The picture is great.
B0074FGLUM,8,7,samsung smart tv.
B0074FGLUM,8,8,Great picture- Smart features need use.
B0074FGLUM,8,9,The picture and sound quality are both great too!
B0074FGLUM,8,10,Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,8,11,This was a great buy!!
B0074FGLUM,8,12,Good but not great.
B0074FGLUM,8,13,Good tv.
B0074FGLUM,8,14,It was and is great.
B0074FGLUM,8,15,This unit has great picture quality and sound.
B0074FGLUM,8,16,It is a good TV, just maybe not a good Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,8,17,Very good for the price.
B0074FGLUM,8,18,Good TV.
B0074FGLUM,8,19,So I thought this Samsung Smart tv would be a great buy.
B0074FGLUM,8,20,Out 32 Samsung did and we need this feature so everyone can see the set.
B0074FGLUM,8,21,Great at Being a TV (Not So Great at Being a Smart TV) I had a modest budget for a new TV and wanted something that would offer good picture and sound without a lot of features.
B0074FGLUM,8,22,I have a Samsung washer and dryer.
B0074FGLUM,8,23,WiFi is Great, Picture is Great, Sound is Horrible.......
B0074FGLUM,8,24,Good TV.
B0074FGLUM,9,0,Great TV and picture after you get the settings right.
B0074FGLUM,9,1,I found there to be enough settings to make the adjustments that were needed.
B0074FGLUM,9,2,Samsung colors are animation bright.
B0074FGLUM,9,3,You NEED to adjust the settings to get it looking great.
B0074FGLUM,9,4,There's A LOT of settings when coming to the audio, so that's a good thing.
B0074FGLUM,9,5,Set up was easy, and we mounted it to a tv stand.
B0074FGLUM,9,6,The Dreaded LED Viewing Angle Bugaboo!
B0074FGLUM,9,7,Colors and settings are a personal choice and some might light the all the settings on and the picture really bright.
B0074FGLUM,9,8,If you watch from the sides of from above, the colors seem to be a bit over-saturated.
B0074FGLUM,9,9,But there's a setting for everyone.Audio - You DEFINITELY need to mess with the audio settings.
B0074FGLUM,9,10,The picture quality is good, not great.
B0074FGLUM,9,11,You will need to tweak the settings before the set performs as it should.
B0074FGLUM,9,12,Viewing it in a totally dark room I can say the blacks are truly black with very little if any light leak.SOUND:Surprisingly good sound quality for a flat screen.
B0074FGLUM,9,13,Out 32 Samsung did and we need this feature so everyone can see the set.
B0074FGLUM,9,14,Solid Value Set.
B0074FGLUM,9,15,The off axis viewing angle is not so good.
B0074FGLUM,9,16,Sure you could turn the volume up; and we have; but it becomes too loud.It took a bit but I finally got the screen / color settings to our liking.
B0074FGLUM,9,17,It is my understanding that this has to do with the placement of the LED lights behind the screen opposed to on the sides of the screen.
B0074FGLUM,9,18,Overall, the contrast is mess-ed up and even in its best movie mode, it is still over enhanced.The only good thing about this TV is its black level.
B0074FGLUM,9,19,Volume on TV was set at 28 and it was not at a level to annoy or be noticed by ppl in an adjacent room.
B0074FGLUM,9,20,really good, not quite great.
B0074FGLUM,9,21,This is a perfect TV for use with a HD Home Run!Mode: DynamicBacklight: 18Contrast: 85Brightness: 50Sharpness: 80Color: 70TInt: G/R 50/50Standard color tone with screen fit in the additional options, with HDMI black level set to low.
B0074FGLUM,9,22,Also with the weaker off angle on this set it is needed to direct to the screen to the viewing area.
B0074FGLUM,9,23,It's like watching a bright animation.
B0074FGLUM,9,24,My last LCD TV was a regular CCFL set and it had excellent sound.
B0074FGLUM,10,0,Was easy to set up.
B0074FGLUM,10,1,This "Smart TV" is not working propperly.
B0074FGLUM,10,2,In the end just don't lose the remote and the TV should work great.
B0074FGLUM,10,3,easiest setup... Nice pix and apps works well.
B0074FGLUM,10,4,great TV, but, youtube pairing does not work.
B0074FGLUM,10,5,Setup was easy and after plugging in the power and connecting the cable it played just fine.
B0074FGLUM,10,6,Great features but didnt work long.
B0074FGLUM,10,7,Super easy to set up.
B0074FGLUM,10,8,I finally got it to work.
B0074FGLUM,10,9,My Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,10,10,Works Great, Love the internet function.
B0074FGLUM,10,11,It's the same cable that I had working with my SONY just seconds before, but Samsung says I need to buy a Samsung cable....  Also on the positive side, if you can call it that, the remote control is better than many I have used.
B0074FGLUM,10,12,Requires more time to learn how to navigate with the remote control.Good quality picture
B0074FGLUM,10,13,works as it should so far.
B0074FGLUM,10,14,Once in the app I am able to use the remote to change channels up and down and directly via the numberpad.
B0074FGLUM,10,15,TV was relatively easy to set up and get operating, including connecting it to our in-home wireless network.
B0074FGLUM,10,16,Came in on time.
B0074FGLUM,10,17,overall its ok  great picture on real time tv.
B0074FGLUM,10,18,Great TV, but it could be smarter.
B0074FGLUM,10,19,my satellite box was as easy as plugging in an HDMI cable (not included; purchased separately).
B0074FGLUM,10,20,The HDMI connection with only work with Samsung DVD players, Samsung computers, etc. and will not work for devices using the HDMI cable everyone else in the industry uses.
B0074FGLUM,10,21,The TV does not work, shut down and I can not re-ignite.A few months ago a problem that is off and on alone.Today he did not want more light.I need to exchange it for one that works.
B0074FGLUM,10,22,The thing s I don't have cable to use my blue ray.
B0074FGLUM,10,23,The start setup screen appeared immediately and was easy to follow.
B0074FGLUM,10,24,Great Screen.
B0074FGLUM,11,0,But we will think twice before buying anything from amazon.
B0074FGLUM,11,1,Will never buy a TV from Amazon.
B0074FGLUM,11,2,u shud give it a try and buy it off amazon if u dnt like it just return it.
B0074FGLUM,11,3,TV RETURNED.
B0074FGLUM,11,4,NEVER ORDER TV'S FROM AMAZON ONLINE!!
B0074FGLUM,11,5,Can I return it in another box?
B0074FGLUM,11,6,I purchased this TV because of other peoples reviews.
B0074FGLUM,11,7,Best Price on Amazon.
B0074FGLUM,11,8,Once I used these settings picture was great.
B0074FGLUM,11,9,Not a good as the reviews said.
B0074FGLUM,11,10,For the price and reviews I got a little trigger happy and bought two of these at one time.
B0074FGLUM,11,11,Sure wish it had amazon video.Update 11/4/12; problems have started with the picture.
B0074FGLUM,11,12,Once I got that set it worked perfectly.
B0074FGLUM,11,13,I don't know if I should just see if I can get amazon to take it back or go through with the return and repair.
B0074FGLUM,11,14,Most of the time, however, the set works quite well, and at less than $700, it's a reasonable deal for a budget-minded purchase.
B0074FGLUM,11,15,TV arrived in 2 days via Amazon Prime.
B0074FGLUM,11,16,I used the settings recommended by other reviewers and it works perfectly
B0074FGLUM,11,17,Good TV, shipped by Amazon, was easy to assemble and easy to set up.
B0074FGLUM,11,18,I replaced with a new Lg that works great.
B0074FGLUM,11,19,works as it should so far.
B0074FGLUM,11,20,But I'm an Amazon junky and can't stand the service at Best Buy.
B0074FGLUM,11,21,I read the reviews of this T.V. and also did some research out of Amazon before I made a buying decision.
B0074FGLUM,11,22,Amazon was good in handling the return.
B0074FGLUM,11,23,Will be returning this TV.
B0074FGLUM,11,24,We brought this tv from amazon.
B0074FGLUM,12,0,This is a good TV, but the so-called "Smart TV" feature is slower than a computer.25
B0074FGLUM,12,1,We played same Netflix movie in parallel on both.
B0074FGLUM,12,2,Great picture- Smart features need use.
B0074FGLUM,12,3,I really like the Smart TV features.
B0074FGLUM,12,4,However, Picture quality very good and has a great set of features...IT DOES NOT SUPPORT .MOV VIDEO FORMATS!!!
B0074FGLUM,12,5,But when it came to setting it up for Smart apps (like Netflix), it would not work.
B0074FGLUM,12,6,nice tv, not so smart.
B0074FGLUM,12,7,Really good though not great  Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,12,8,Nice TV - Good Picture - Nice Features - SLOW Apps.
B0074FGLUM,12,9,NOT A GOOD TV.
B0074FGLUM,12,10,So far I've only used this to watch netflix, hulu, and play games and so far it's doing just fine.
B0074FGLUM,12,11,I was just looking for something simple so I can watch tv and play games with.
B0074FGLUM,12,12,Great TV, Some of the Smart Features...Not So Much!
B0074FGLUM,12,13,Samsung smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,12,14,Out 32 Samsung did and we need this feature so everyone can see the set.
B0074FGLUM,12,15,Great TV, not so Smart however.
B0074FGLUM,12,16,It's great but...
B0074FGLUM,12,17,Almost like watching a live play.The Smart TV works great for us.
B0074FGLUM,12,18,The TV works and looks great.
B0074FGLUM,12,19,Great picture!
B0074FGLUM,12,20,I don't know who is responsible for low quality netflix movies, either netflix or samsung.
B0074FGLUM,12,21,It has nice image and good apps selection.
B0074FGLUM,12,22,I'm enjoying being able to stream video from netflix, amazon, and several other apps.
B0074FGLUM,12,23,Good TV, but Netflix app issue fix had to be found.
B0074FGLUM,12,24,The apps were good.
B0074FGLUM,13,0,Smashed screen.
B0074FGLUM,13,1,I looked at it, and noticed that the screen had been shattered at the top and had spread across half the screen.
B0074FGLUM,13,2,Now there is a 1/4 diameter black circle on the bottom edge of the screen.
B0074FGLUM,13,3,The tv screen is already showing issues.
B0074FGLUM,13,4,The screen was black and red, with white spiderweb-like lines all over the plasma screen.
B0074FGLUM,13,5,Damaged Screen.
B0074FGLUM,13,6,Sometimes the screen goes completely black.
B0074FGLUM,13,7,tv came with the broken screen.
B0074FGLUM,13,8,Also the screen has a 3 inch blotch at the bottom that is visible when viewing dark scenes.
B0074FGLUM,13,9,Dead pixel.
B0074FGLUM,13,10,3 months later I have dead pixels and dark lines across the screen.
B0074FGLUM,13,11,The picture is coming in black and white only.
B0074FGLUM,13,12,A large circular space of the screen (top left) and corner of the screen (top right) was totally WHITE.
B0074FGLUM,13,13,The TV screen is totally shattered!!!!!
B0074FGLUM,13,14,TV was damaged with a broken screen.
B0074FGLUM,13,15,The Sony screen seemed to absorb light instead of reflecting it.
B0074FGLUM,13,16,screen dead after one week.
B0074FGLUM,13,17,the colors are very poor especially when viewed from one side not front.download
B0074FGLUM,13,18,It's almost imperceptible with a light background, but when the background is dark, it becomes annoyingly prominent.
B0074FGLUM,13,19,My only significant complaint is with the excessive reflection on the screen when a light source such as a window is behind you.
B0074FGLUM,13,20,A solid gray line appeared on the right side of the screen running from top to bottom and about four inches wide.
B0074FGLUM,13,21,Two dark spots in the middle of the screen where the backlight was not uniform.
B0074FGLUM,13,22,The TV showed up with over 70 dead pixels.
B0074FGLUM,13,23,I thought it was the tv protector so I left it up and I notice the screen Is just popped out from the Tv.
B0074FGLUM,13,24,I sit down and turn it on and all I see is a white line on top.
B0074FGLUM,14,0,I purchased this TV and used it for about a month before returning it.
B0074FGLUM,14,1,I had purchased Samsung UN40EH5300 smart TV almost a month ago.
B0074FGLUM,14,2,I will be returning this and never buying a samsung tv again.
B0074FGLUM,14,3,Should have gone with my first instinct and purchased a Panasonic which I will know do.
B0074FGLUM,14,4,I bought a Samsung Smart TV in October 2012.
B0074FGLUM,14,5,I would never, ever purchase another electronic item from SAMSUNG.
B0074FGLUM,14,6,I only used it for 5 months.
B0074FGLUM,14,7,Please do not buy this TV if you are looking to buy a smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,8,The TV is the first HDTV I have purchased but I did own one other Insignia that wa given to me.
B0074FGLUM,14,9,I had no problem returning it to Amazon, and I got another Samsung (more expensive) smart TV from Amazon.
B0074FGLUM,14,10,Owned for a few months, finallt got around to smart, not really.
B0074FGLUM,14,11,Do not Purchase this television.
B0074FGLUM,14,12,TV was great up until two months in.
B0074FGLUM,14,13,I bought this TV 6 months ago, and if I had it to do over, I definitely would not purchase this TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,14,Wish I hadn't bought it.
B0074FGLUM,14,15,Great buy.
B0074FGLUM,14,16,Product Broke two months after bought!
B0074FGLUM,14,17,My sister purchased the 6500 model and is more miserable than I am so I chalk it up to Samsung putting out junk.
B0074FGLUM,14,18,This is the worst TV I have ever bought.Just don't buy it.
B0074FGLUM,14,19,I bought this television because of the brand and the price.
B0074FGLUM,14,20,I purchased this item and am going to return it back within 2 days.
B0074FGLUM,14,21,50% smart TV not a 100% After doing research for couple of months, I bought this TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,22,I bought this TV last year.
B0074FGLUM,14,23,I purchased this TV just a year and a few months ago and the power is out.
B0074FGLUM,14,24,Samsung UN46E5300.
B0074FGLUM,15,0,The sound on this TV was unbearable!
B0074FGLUM,15,1,Problems with Speakers.
B0074FGLUM,15,2,I have tried all the various sound settings to now avail.
B0074FGLUM,15,3,The only problem is the speakers.
B0074FGLUM,15,4,Cannot control external speaker volume.
B0074FGLUM,15,5,Audio problems.
B0074FGLUM,15,6,The TV has an external speaker connection.
B0074FGLUM,15,7,The problem is that the volume control of the TV does not control the output of the external speaker.
B0074FGLUM,15,8,my only complaint is the sound quality as it sounds like the speakers are in a cardboard box.
B0074FGLUM,15,9,I purchased external speakers and connected them to the analog speaker output on the back of the TV.
B0074FGLUM,15,10,That's a bug.Another issue is connections to an external speaker.
B0074FGLUM,15,11,The sound is so horrible I am contemplating getting a sound bar.
B0074FGLUM,15,12,The sound system on this TV is horrible!
B0074FGLUM,15,13,The only way to use a headphone is the Audio out jack on the back of the TV.
B0074FGLUM,15,14,You have to turn the sound up super-high to hear voices.
B0074FGLUM,15,15,So I have no way of muting my external speakers as they are just speakers, they are not a audio receiver unit with a separate remote control.
B0074FGLUM,15,16,As a TV it works well and sounds good.
B0074FGLUM,15,17,This improved the sound quality greatly, but I discovered that the volume can't be controlled from the TV when using the external speaker jack.
B0074FGLUM,15,18,This TV does not have a headphone jack on the television.Major deficiency.
B0074FGLUM,15,19,Using add-on speakers means volume control on remote does not work.
B0074FGLUM,15,20,But we have had a problem with the sound on both monitors.
B0074FGLUM,15,21,Horrible Sound.
B0074FGLUM,15,22,Granted, I could get a sound bar, but shouldn't have to.[b]non
B0074FGLUM,15,23,Sound is an issue.
B0074FGLUM,15,24,The volume variation is one issue.
B0074FGLUM,16,0,Samsung customer service is anything but service.
B0074FGLUM,16,1,Nothing happened so I called again.
B0074FGLUM,16,2,I called Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,16,3,Samsung "Customer Service" is no help, so you are on your own.
B0074FGLUM,16,4,I called Samsung and they outsource their tech support to somewhere in China.
B0074FGLUM,16,5,I waited patiently for 4 days and no calls from them.
B0074FGLUM,16,6,When I called to have THAT replaced, I was told I had to wait another 2 weeks.
B0074FGLUM,16,7,Samsung customer service could not resolve this.
B0074FGLUM,16,8,Well 4 days later I called Samsung customer service and was informed 32 inch t.v.'s must be shipped to be serviced.
B0074FGLUM,16,9,update: Called Samsung service.
B0074FGLUM,16,10,Samsung was really nasty to me about it saying it is out of warranty.
B0074FGLUM,16,11,KNOWN PROBLEM! (BUT) Samsung fixed it!
B0074FGLUM,16,12,So I called Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,16,13,I've called support many times.
B0074FGLUM,16,14,But nothing samsung support couldn't fix.
B0074FGLUM,16,15,Very poor customer support lines.
B0074FGLUM,16,16,They told me that they were backed up and it may take up to five more days.
B0074FGLUM,16,17,I had been waiting 4 days for a call I was never going to receive.
B0074FGLUM,16,18,That's too long for a Southern New England service call.
B0074FGLUM,16,19,I know the TV needed a hardware fix and Samsung should've sent someone out to service it, but I could not get any help from their Customer Service.
B0074FGLUM,16,20,They really know how to treat customers.
B0074FGLUM,16,21,Had a couple of problems with this TV and called Samsung for help.
B0074FGLUM,16,22,I went through a month of calls to Samsung, called Netflix, called my ISP.
B0074FGLUM,16,23,What has happened to SAMSUNG?
B0074FGLUM,16,24,Called Samsung tech support, got the run-around, asked for a supervisor, got sent to an answering machine.
B0074FGLUM,17,0,The picture quality is OK.
B0074FGLUM,17,1,great picture sound not great.
B0074FGLUM,17,2,Great picture quality BUT...review from an IT perspective!
B0074FGLUM,17,3,Sound quality is not great.
B0074FGLUM,17,4,Good, but not great.
B0074FGLUM,17,5,Good TV at a great price.
B0074FGLUM,17,6,Great TV Good Price.

B0074FGLUM,17,10,Overall it is good for the price.
B0074FGLUM,17,11,Good quality picture and sound.
B0074FGLUM,17,12,Other than this picture quality and everything is very good.
B0074FGLUM,17,13,Good TV, not so good Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,17,14,So far so good!
B0074FGLUM,17,15,The picture and sound quality are both great too!
B0074FGLUM,17,16,Great value.
B0074FGLUM,17,17,Good quality TV.
B0074FGLUM,17,18,I can't tell if the tv is great or not.
B0074FGLUM,17,19,Great for price.
B0074FGLUM,17,20,Good value..
B0074FGLUM,17,21,Overall good.
B0074FGLUM,17,22,I have yet to really adjust the picture settings to my liking but so far, the picture quality and even the sound is great.
B0074FGLUM,17,23,Aside from that It's got great sound and picture quality!
B0074FGLUM,17,24,The picture is great.
B0074FGLUM,18,0,I will never buy anothey Samsung product and AMAZON  should have a disclaimer with tis information before anyone buys a Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,18,1,DO NOT BUY.
B0074FGLUM,18,2,Don't buy any Samsung TV's.
B0074FGLUM,18,3,BUy something else.

B0074FGLUM,18,13,DO NOT BUY THIS TV; BUYER BEWARE.
B0074FGLUM,18,14,I won't buy another Samsung TV.
B0074FGLUM,18,15,NOT ACTUALLY A 120HZ TV.
B0074FGLUM,18,16,Not a mature product.
B0074FGLUM,18,17,PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TV BECAUSE YOU ARE ONLY GOING TO WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B0074FGLUM,18,18,Suffice to say, I DO NOT recommend this product to ANYONE, nor do I recommend this brand.
B0074FGLUM,18,19,Not recommended to purchase this immature product.
B0074FGLUM,18,20,First time I've said that about a Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,18,21,32" Samsung TV.
B0074FGLUM,18,22,Buy another Brand - DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B0074FGLUM,18,23,I am disappointed in the product.
B0074FGLUM,18,24,SAMSUNG IS LISTING THIS AS A 120HZ TV, WHEN ACTUALLY ITS A 60 HZ.
B0074FGLUM,19,0,I  still use my chromcast for netflix since its quicker but I use the tv's other apps happily.
B0074FGLUM,19,1,Netflix app works by the way.
B0074FGLUM,19,2,Then both of the apps stopped working.
B0074FGLUM,19,3,Please fix the apps!
B0074FGLUM,19,4,Netflix doesn't work TVP-805.
B0074FGLUM,19,5,does not have youtube app.
B0074FGLUM,19,6,only it will work.
B0074FGLUM,19,7,The Netflix App had a picture of HBO2Go instead.
B0074FGLUM,19,8,The youtube app will never work.
B0074FGLUM,19,9,The youtube app has never worked.
B0074FGLUM,19,10,The problem is that I want to watch streaming video that has no app (rifftrax).
B0074FGLUM,19,11,Work.
B0074FGLUM,19,12,Amazon app for my video's is not working well.
B0074FGLUM,19,13,Netflix and Amazon Instant Video App is not working.
B0074FGLUM,19,14,Netflix and Amazon Instant Video App is not working.
B0074FGLUM,19,15,NO YOUTUBE APP.
B0074FGLUM,19,16,It works this time.
B0074FGLUM,19,17,The apps work fine, no problem at all.
B0074FGLUM,19,18,There are apps for amazon prime and netflix (haven't tried the netflix yet, don't really use it).
B0074FGLUM,19,19,YouTube never works and browser never works.
B0074FGLUM,19,20,You can watch movies with netflix without any prob.
B0074FGLUM,19,21,I am only using the Netflix app with this TV.
B0074FGLUM,19,22,The apps (Netflix & Youtube) seem to work fine.
B0074FGLUM,19,23,I bought this tv thinking that I can stream Netflix, YouTube, and other apps but I am able to stream only Netflix and it also doesn't work many times.
B0074FGLUM,19,24,Well, it has never worked right.
B0074FGLUM,20,0,All HDMI ports don't work.
B0074FGLUM,20,1,We use the TV for our cable.
B0074FGLUM,20,2,It has 3 HDMI inputs.
B0074FGLUM,20,3,It includes 3 HDMI ports. 1 HDMI port also has an audio port for using with a computer with DVI to HDMI adapter.
B0074FGLUM,20,4,It comes with 3 HDMI ports, and a few USB ports.
B0074FGLUM,20,5,HDMI ports plus a component input.-Price
B0074FGLUM,20,6,This can be particularly tricky because the only ports on the TV are HDMI or USB.
B0074FGLUM,20,7,The HDMI connection with only work with Samsung DVD players, Samsung computers, etc. and will not work for devices using the HDMI cable everyone else in the industry uses.
B0074FGLUM,20,8,Transmitter connects to PC,receiver connects to TV.
B0074FGLUM,20,9,Get a dumb TV and connect through the HDMI port.
B0074FGLUM,20,10,It has 1 set of inputs component/composite video and L/R audio.  1 audio output jack and 1 optical audio output.
B0074FGLUM,20,11,It also only has 1 set of component in port.
B0074FGLUM,20,12,It doesn't have an S-VHS port for my old (but cherished) S-VHS video player.
B0074FGLUM,20,13,no VGA input in back.
B0074FGLUM,20,14,It would be helpful if the TV had a VGA port, since computers will often have this, but many computers don't have HDMI.
B0074FGLUM,20,15,There is a PC port and regular analog port.
B0074FGLUM,20,16,The audio and video jacks/ports at the back is limited and other systems cannot be connected.
B0074FGLUM,20,17,It works on my PC and it works on my laptop.
B0074FGLUM,20,18,Hdmi ports go bad on Samsung tvs.
B0074FGLUM,20,19,Now it could be something with my HDMI cable or adapter that is messing up the handshake, so I cannot say for sure if it was also the problem with this HDTV.
B0074FGLUM,20,20,He knew the problem before he arrived: changing from the old analog TV with a cable D/A converter to a direct cable connection resulted in different cable numbers!
B0074FGLUM,20,21,Only one non-HDMI AV port (may not be a problem for you)
B0074FGLUM,20,22,May not work as well as a PC monitor for Mac as you would expect!
B0074FGLUM,20,23,We have the ethernet cable connected right to the TV and it still does the glitches.
B0074FGLUM,20,24,The connectivity to this TV is quite poor.
B0074FGLUM,21,0,Please fix the apps!
B0074FGLUM,21,1,no amazon still.
B0074FGLUM,21,2,This TV does not have the youtube app.
B0074FGLUM,21,3,Samsung Customer Service.
B0074FGLUM,21,4,Amazon app for my video's is not working well.
B0074FGLUM,21,5,NO YOUTUBE APP.
B0074FGLUM,21,6,5300 does not support YouTube app.
B0074FGLUM,21,7,Samsung Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,21,8,Great TV, just the Smart is not so smart.
B0074FGLUM,21,9,Netflix app works by the way.
B0074FGLUM,21,10,samsung not so smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,21,11,Samsung got my money this time but never again.
B0074FGLUM,21,12,Most of the apps that were anything at all you have to pay for.
B0074FGLUM,21,13,Would have given it 5 stars but...... Samsung customer service , well the nicest thing I can say is that it is a challenge.
B0074FGLUM,21,14,Neither of these apps are available in the Samsung apps store.
B0074FGLUM,21,15,I got smart TV specifically so I can use Netflix and Youtube App in the TV.
B0074FGLUM,21,16,Great TV, but not so 'Smart'.
B0074FGLUM,21,17,Unfortunately, YouTube & Google aren't doing the work to make their YouTube app compliant with these rulings.
B0074FGLUM,21,18,Great tv but the smart part is not for outside the US.
B0074FGLUM,21,19,Review for Samsung UN32EH5300 smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,21,20,WELL...it does!!!  HOWEVER, THERE IS NO YOUTUBE APP anymore on Samsung TVs according to Amazon tech support.
B0074FGLUM,21,21,good TV but not very smart.
B0074FGLUM,21,22,Samsung support is so s***ty to work with, they don't do squat to hep me.
B0074FGLUM,21,23,Maybe Samsung thinks that it's "smart" to herd customers into their proprietary offerings.
B0074FGLUM,21,24,Instead Samsung provided an app called LinkToYouTube, which is not an app itself, instead it is a shortcut to link to the browser version of YouTube.
B0074FGLUM,22,0,samsung smart tv not so smart.
B0074FGLUM,22,1,not so smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,22,2,not Smart.
B0074FGLUM,22,3,smart tv???
B0074FGLUM,22,4,SMART TV is not really SMART.
B0074FGLUM,22,5,Not smart at all.
B0074FGLUM,22,6,For trying to be a smart TV, it's only 3-stars "smart."
B0074FGLUM,22,7,samsung not so smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,22,8,Smart TV isn't so smart anymore.
B0074FGLUM,22,9,Dont get a samsung tv !!!
B0074FGLUM,22,10,Samsung Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,22,11,It is not smart at all.
B0074FGLUM,22,12,Can this not be fixed by Samsung?
B0074FGLUM,22,13,Don not buy any of Samsung smart tv.
B0074FGLUM,22,14,Smart seems to be a misnomer.
B0074FGLUM,22,15,Smart?
B0074FGLUM,22,16,Not Smart at All.
B0074FGLUM,22,17,Samsung Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,22,18,Samsung Smart Hub NOT so smart.
B0074FGLUM,22,19,It's much smarter than the samsung smart tv.
B0074FGLUM,22,20,Not very smart.
B0074FGLUM,22,21,not really a smart tv.
B0074FGLUM,22,22,What has happened to SAMSUNG?
B0074FGLUM,22,23,We can not say it is a smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,22,24,If I could do it over again, I'D BUY ANY TV BUT A SAMSUNG SMART TV!
B0074FGLUM,23,0,Remote is still old traditional remote.
B0074FGLUM,23,1,No universal remote?????
B0074FGLUM,23,2,The TV comes with a "remote controller or wand".
B0074FGLUM,23,3,Good thing.
B0074FGLUM,23,4,It's light, easy to attach the base to the stand (just 8 small screws!), and the picture quality is good.Cons: The stand does not rotate or pivot.
B0074FGLUM,23,5,great tv, less than great remote for a smart tv.
B0074FGLUM,23,6,Using add-on speakers means volume control on remote does not work.
B0074FGLUM,23,7,But Samsung skimped on the remote so it's getting 3 stars.
B0074FGLUM,23,8,This set does not have any control buttons on the actual unit.
B0074FGLUM,23,9,Very hard to type using this remote.I like the LG TV remotes.
B0074FGLUM,23,10,Backlit buttons but unfortunately you have to find the back light button to light the buttons.
B0074FGLUM,23,11,UI with remote is difficult.
B0074FGLUM,23,12,This means another remote.
B0074FGLUM,23,13,The sound quality is also very good.One complaint I have about this TV is that the base stand is very light weight.
B0074FGLUM,23,14,My Cable box also has such a remote.
B0074FGLUM,23,15,There are no protruding buttons so when mounted on a wall it looks more like a picture frame then a TV.
B0074FGLUM,23,16,The only thing that it needs to be better is the remote control to have the slides up to open the keyboard.
B0074FGLUM,23,17,As it's a 'smart' TV, why don't you put a small keyboard on remote control?
B0074FGLUM,23,18,I can't believe that this TV doesn't come with a universal remote to control the cable box and other accessories.
B0074FGLUM,23,19,We might need a good touch based remote for moving your cursor.Otherwise its good for picture quality and value for money.
B0074FGLUM,23,20,The up slant is good if you have a lower TV stand, but problematic if your stand is typical height.
B0074FGLUM,23,21,Other than the complaints, it's just an  average consumer-grade TV. the picture isn't particularly great, the sound isn't particularly great, the remote isn't particularly great, or anything like that.
B0074FGLUM,23,22,The set is very responsive to the remote control from anyplace in the room.
B0074FGLUM,23,23,Disappointed in remote control controls could be more intuitive.
B0074FGLUM,23,24,I then pulled the actual tv from the box and set it on the stand.
B0074FGLUM,24,0,KNOWN PROBLEM! (BUT) Samsung fixed it!
B0074FGLUM,24,1,I have used many other samsung TVs in my rental cottages ( over 10) and have never had any problems with samsung
B0074FGLUM,24,2,My Samsung TV quit working just after 1 year.
B0074FGLUM,24,3,$1200 and it will not last 2 years.
B0074FGLUM,24,4,I own 3 other Samsung TVs with no issues.
B0074FGLUM,24,5,Never again - I will never buy another Samsung product again.
B0074FGLUM,24,6,I will go with the latter, and will never buy a Samsung product again.
B0074FGLUM,24,7,Only works until right after warranty is out... 1 year, 2 months.
B0074FGLUM,24,8,Now 2 years later - same problem.
B0074FGLUM,24,9,After 6 months of use Samsung UN40EH5300 stopped working!!
B0074FGLUM,24,10,The picture quality of this not the same as my old LCD Samsung by far.
B0074FGLUM,24,11,I will never buy this Samsung TV again all buy anything from themThey didn't tell us it dose not work in AustraliaBefore we got itAll its good for is the rubbish tipYou think they would of told us now I have to buy a new t
B0074FGLUM,24,12,Based on what I've seen, Samsung KNOWS about this problem, and hasn't fixed it in years.Sigh.
B0074FGLUM,24,13,Samsung 46EH5300.
B0074FGLUM,24,14,I read many other reviews with the same issue.
B0074FGLUM,24,15,I just retired a 30 year old Panasonic (which still works just fine)  and replaced it with this Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,24,16,I had one repair through the Samsung warranty and 2 days later it started again.
B0074FGLUM,24,17,I purchased this TV just a year and a few months ago and the power is out.
B0074FGLUM,24,18,I purchased the TV through Amazon, and was told that the warranty would be up after 1 year.
B0074FGLUM,24,19,Samsung LED TV review - UN40EH5300 40 inch.
B0074FGLUM,24,20,This is the second Samsung TV to fail within a year of purchase.
B0074FGLUM,24,21,Not what I expected from Samsung... Or is it?!?
B0074FGLUM,24,22,Don't buy.
B0074FGLUM,24,23,I can't say enough good things about samsung as a TV.
B0074FGLUM,24,24,Used to buy Sony but I seem to like the Samsung picture quality better lately.
B0074FGLUM,25,0,You have to turn it on yourself.
B0074FGLUM,25,1,Some timesthe interval will be several minutes and other times it will be just a few seconds...
B0074FGLUM,25,2,Sometimes it will work fine for 1-2 hours and other times it will shut off as soon as you turn it on.
B0074FGLUM,25,3,After 6 months the TV malfunction, started to turn on and off by it self.
B0074FGLUM,25,4,Turning off and on a few times seemed to get it back to normal.
B0074FGLUM,25,5,I tried all the sound menu settings, but never got it to work the way I needed it to.
B0074FGLUM,25,6,It works this time.
B0074FGLUM,25,7,i got it set up and then started watching tv, then i started to notice something the sound comes and goes.
B0074FGLUM,25,8,AT TIMES DOES NOT POWER ONI really like this TV.
B0074FGLUM,25,9,AT TIMES DOES NOT POWER ON.
B0074FGLUM,25,10,But a few days later, it just wouldn't quit power recyling itself -- screen goes blank, power light goes off, then it tries to power on again, you see the splash screen but never get a picture, shuts off and tries to power on again with no success.
B0074FGLUM,25,11,For some reason the settings reverted to the default settings a few times and I had redo the settings several times.
B0074FGLUM,25,12,Now it will not even get past the start up screen.
B0074FGLUM,25,13,My Cable box also has such a remote.
B0074FGLUM,25,14,Turn off the TV, start over.
B0074FGLUM,25,15,It seems every time I turn it on it is updating.
B0074FGLUM,25,16,Then after one or more of these 15 minute intervals, then it would shut off and you couldn't turn it back on until the next day.
B0074FGLUM,25,17,I try cleaning the TV same problem and this happened to me on the second time I put on the TV to now and this day 23/01/2014 and the remote and TV has never fallen!
B0074FGLUM,25,18,This television was working for two months but it recently started to power cycle.
B0074FGLUM,25,19,It quit working after the third time I had turned it on.
B0074FGLUM,25,20,Turn on the TV.2.
B0074FGLUM,25,21,Now, however, nothing seems to work.
B0074FGLUM,25,22,Stopped working.
B0074FGLUM,25,23,Thus you have to set the recommended settings three different times.
B0074FGLUM,25,24,On day I turned on my t.v. and it just kept switching between a black screen, the samsung logo, and screen showing HDMI was connected and it would not respond to remote.
B00BCGROJG,0,0,It looks great In our conference room.
B00BCGROJG,0,1,This is the brightest and clearest viewing screen that you will ever view.
B00BCGROJG,0,2,Great TV for the Living Room.
B00BCGROJG,0,3,I mean if you want a good TV with a nice screen get it!!!
B00BCGROJG,0,4,Love the Big Screen!
B00BCGROJG,0,5,Great bright picture, this tv is in our family room and the tv has no problem in a room with light.2.
B00BCGROJG,0,6,The screen size is perfect for someone that likes movies.
B00BCGROJG,0,7,In our living room there are off angle seats and you can tell the blacks are not as dark off angle.
B00BCGROJG,0,8,Great brights but the darks are not all that :o( I love this TV BUT my only problem is with dark scenes.
B00BCGROJG,0,9,This Smart TV is the perfect size for our new studio room.
B00BCGROJG,0,10,Perfect size, great picture and a smart TV too.
B00BCGROJG,0,11,Great smart TV IN BRIGHT room .
B00BCGROJG,0,12,Great flat screen TV.
B00BCGROJG,0,13,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,0,14,But it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,0,15,I must say I love this TV, we have never watched so much TV in our living room.
B00BCGROJG,0,16,Great picture.
B00BCGROJG,0,17,Perfect TV.
B00BCGROJG,0,18,The TV physical size is great and thin, but the viewing angle on this TV is bad.
B00BCGROJG,0,19,Brightness is better and washed when viewing at an angle.Other than the viewing angle, the TV is a good buy at $2K.
B00BCGROJG,0,20,Good.
B00BCGROJG,0,21,very good.
B00BCGROJG,0,22,This set fits exactly—and I mean, to the millimeter exactly—in our viewing space.
B00BCGROJG,0,23,Nothing that will ever show the darkness flaws on the screen.Bottom Line: If you watch TV in a lit room, and don't watch dark movies like "The Dark Knight", "The Purge", "Star Trek into Darkness", or any movie with a prolonged dark scene, then get it.If you want see an perfectly amazing dark picture from a TV that retails for $5,000.
B00BCGROJG,0,24,Furthermore, room lighting must be nearly dark to notice this flaw.
B00BCGROJG,1,0,Great tv at a great price.
B00BCGROJG,1,1,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,1,2,Great tv
B00BCGROJG,1,3,Great price.
B00BCGROJG,1,4,Everyone would commend on how great the picture is.
B00BCGROJG,1,5,The best tv for the price.
B00BCGROJG,1,6,Samsung TV, so good.
B00BCGROJG,1,7,Great Picture.
B00BCGROJG,1,8,Great purchase!
B00BCGROJG,1,9,TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,1,10,so good.
B00BCGROJG,1,11,Great Deal.
B00BCGROJG,1,12,This is a great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,13,Samsung TV purchased.
B00BCGROJG,1,14,Too good to purchase an affordable price.
B00BCGROJG,1,15,Good Price ($1439.99 after price matching!!!!), and Good Performance.(Smart
B00BCGROJG,1,16,I love my Samsung TV!!
B00BCGROJG,1,17,This is probably the best TV I've bought ever.
B00BCGROJG,1,18,Very Good TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,19,Not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,1,20,Smart TV...is great.
B00BCGROJG,1,21,None of the Sonys we liked were available (2012 models); then, we saw this Samsung for a very good price and decided to buy.
B00BCGROJG,1,22,This smart TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,1,23,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,24,As with all Samsung Smart TV,s they are the best.
B00BCGROJG,2,0,Clear picture, and great sound even without sound system.
B00BCGROJG,2,1,Overall picture quality is very good.
B00BCGROJG,2,2,The sound is not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,2,3,The sound is acceptable, but an external sound system is really necessary for sound immersion.
B00BCGROJG,2,4,The sound is good, but I'm going to get some speakers for a better audio experience.
B00BCGROJG,2,5,Before someone tells me that I shouldn't use tv speakers and should instead use a surround sound system, I get that.
B00BCGROJG,2,6,Awesome... Except sound everything is great.
B00BCGROJG,2,7,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,2,8,Very good TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,9,Great picture, sound, etc....HIGHLY recommend!
B00BCGROJG,2,10,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,2,11,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,2,12,Good.
B00BCGROJG,2,13,very good.
B00BCGROJG,2,14,The sound quality without any extra help like a Surround system attached to it , was good enough for a room; however, if you would like to experience a full home theater drill, I suggest a Surround System.
B00BCGROJG,2,15,The picture is still good, just not as great as when you are in front of it.
B00BCGROJG,2,16,Picture quality is excellent.
B00BCGROJG,2,17,Admittedly not as good as my Onkyo surround sound system.
B00BCGROJG,2,18,I'm also really happy with the sound.
B00BCGROJG,2,19,The TV audio is ok, but certainly not as good as my Sony system.3.
B00BCGROJG,2,20,TV is better than expected.
B00BCGROJG,2,21,Better than expected.
B00BCGROJG,2,22,The sound is MUCH better than I expected for a flat screen.
B00BCGROJG,2,23,Sound quality is good too.
B00BCGROJG,2,24,Sound is fine ( not bad as some reviews complained about it, come on!! they must be deaf...lol ), Smartv apps are nice and work good.
B00BCGROJG,3,0,TV great, customer service not so much.
B00BCGROJG,3,1,Tried AMAZON ..4 days later, tv in house lookin' great.
B00BCGROJG,3,2,I was very skeptical about ordering a tv through Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,3,I ordered it through Amazon, and had a delivery scheduled.
B00BCGROJG,3,4,Amazon was great.
B00BCGROJG,3,5,TV arrived on time (2 days!) and worked no problem.
B00BCGROJG,3,6,Best picture I have seen BUT poor customer service.
B00BCGROJG,3,7,The TV shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,8,Amazon delivery was on time and TV arrived in PERFECT condition.
B00BCGROJG,3,9,Fast, Well Packaged Delivery - Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,3,10,I've not had a problem with Amazon so I haven't had to test their customer service.
B00BCGROJG,3,11,great!
B00BCGROJG,3,12,There went another $20 on Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,13,Delivery went unhitched also - a first!
B00BCGROJG,3,14,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,3,15,I received my TV in 2 days with free shipping.
B00BCGROJG,3,16,Awesome TV for 3 days, Delivery was not the best.
B00BCGROJG,3,17,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,3,18,delivery guy who brought it by and set it up was very helpful as well
B00BCGROJG,3,19,quick delivery.
B00BCGROJG,3,20,I ended up helping the delivery guy unbox the unit.
B00BCGROJG,3,21,Received it in two days.
B00BCGROJG,3,22,Product works great, delivery was on time (I got to specify a 3 hour window), and they even came in and installed the base to the tv and waited for me to make sure everything worked.
B00BCGROJG,3,23,Speaking of shipping, Samsung did a great job with their packaging.
B00BCGROJG,3,24,This tv is amazing, the delivery was great!!
B00BCGROJG,4,0,I'm old school and this TV is easy to set up and the picture is awesome.
B00BCGROJG,4,1,Great Picture.
B00BCGROJG,4,2,The set up was easy.
B00BCGROJG,4,3,But once he did get the settings right...the picture is amazing.
B00BCGROJG,4,4,Great tv at a great price.
B00BCGROJG,4,5,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,4,6,very good TV great picture.
B00BCGROJG,4,7,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,4,8,But the picture quality is great.
B00BCGROJG,4,9,The picture is very good and clear as well and the colors are very prominent and clean.
B00BCGROJG,4,10,Set up is easy but takes a while.
B00BCGROJG,4,11,Great picture quality... leakage of blacks.. First of all.
B00BCGROJG,4,12,Picture quality is clear and beautiful.
B00BCGROJG,4,13,The picture quality is great.
B00BCGROJG,4,14,Good picture.
B00BCGROJG,4,15,Everyone would commend on how great the picture is.
B00BCGROJG,4,16,Word cannot say what a great picture this TV has.
B00BCGROJG,4,17,The picture of this TV is just amazing.
B00BCGROJG,4,18,Amazing.
B00BCGROJG,4,19,Great picture/easy to setup.
B00BCGROJG,4,20,It was also light and easy to get up and running.
B00BCGROJG,4,21,Easy to set up and control.
B00BCGROJG,4,22,10 is more than enough with this set.
B00BCGROJG,4,23,The truth about this set.
B00BCGROJG,4,24,It has excellent clarity and colors.
B00BCGROJG,5,0,good.
B00BCGROJG,5,1,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,5,2,Anyway, It is very very good product.
B00BCGROJG,5,3,This product very good.
B00BCGROJG,5,4,Great Buy.
B00BCGROJG,5,5,very high priced but good product.
B00BCGROJG,5,6,A great value.
B00BCGROJG,5,7,Overall picture quality is very good.

B00BCGROJG,5,9,Buy It! Great TV!
B00BCGROJG,5,10,Excellent Product.
B00BCGROJG,5,11,Would highly recommended to anyone.
B00BCGROJG,5,12,Overall a great product.
B00BCGROJG,5,13,Very Good TV.
B00BCGROJG,5,14,Excellent picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,5,15,I highly recommended.
B00BCGROJG,5,16,Would highly recommend to anyone.
B00BCGROJG,5,17,The price is worth it, I highly recommend.
B00BCGROJG,5,18,Great TV for the money.
B00BCGROJG,5,19,Everything is good.
B00BCGROJG,5,20,Highly recommended
B00BCGROJG,5,21,Highly recommended.
B00BCGROJG,5,22,The excellent reviews were right on target.
B00BCGROJG,5,23,The excellent reviews.
B00BCGROJG,5,24,Would highly recommend.
B00BCGROJG,6,0,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,6,1,They work ok, not great, but ok.
B00BCGROJG,6,2,great!
B00BCGROJG,6,3,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,6,4,Love my new tv.
B00BCGROJG,6,5,Great TV, but be alerted...
B00BCGROJG,6,6,Great picture, great for sports.
B00BCGROJG,6,7,Plus the smart tv with all the apps this tv has it all...
B00BCGROJG,6,8,I just love it.
B00BCGROJG,6,9,I'm in love.
B00BCGROJG,6,10,love it!
B00BCGROJG,6,11,love it!
B00BCGROJG,6,12,love this TV perfect picture, watched our first 3d movie it was great!!! everything we have is samsung and they all work together!
B00BCGROJG,6,13,Works great on just WIFI.
B00BCGROJG,6,14,Great tv
B00BCGROJG,6,15,3D does work, watched few 3D movies from Netflix.
B00BCGROJG,6,16,Love it!
B00BCGROJG,6,17,Smart TV...is great.
B00BCGROJG,6,18,Love this TV.
B00BCGROJG,6,19,So far so good....
B00BCGROJG,6,20,Its picture is very good and cant get enough of it.
B00BCGROJG,6,21,i'm love it.
B00BCGROJG,6,22,I love it.
B00BCGROJG,6,23,Great picture.
B00BCGROJG,6,24,That seems to work.I love to watch my sports, specifically hockey and with the Stanley Cup Playoffs currently playing, to me it is like watching it Live- Awesome picture.
B00BCGROJG,7,0,Great Picture on HD Channels.
B00BCGROJG,7,1,very good TV great picture.
B00BCGROJG,7,2,would anyone need 4 HDMI inputs?
B00BCGROJG,7,3,I've only watched cable tv so far (via the cable box and HDMI), but I've seen the Samsung GUI and it looks amazing, so I'll be trying that as soon as the tv is connected to the internet.
B00BCGROJG,7,4,I connected them with HDMI cables, while hooking sound system with optical cable directly to TV.
B00BCGROJG,7,5,The HDMI to cable box connection assures a great out of the box picture.
B00BCGROJG,7,6,The picture is amazingly clear and perfect on the HD channels.
B00BCGROJG,7,7,I can't plug my Direct TV HDMI cable to the Samsung ARC input and maybe someone on here will be able to steer me to the right direction.
B00BCGROJG,7,8,I have home theater system, cable box and DVD and BRay.
B00BCGROJG,7,9,the video quality is great but that's the only positive thing I can say about it.
B00BCGROJG,7,10,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,7,11,The sound is not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,7,12,Even the standard DVDs look great.
B00BCGROJG,7,13,This is a great TV.
B00BCGROJG,7,14,The resolution is really good and Samsung all share is really easy and comfortable to access my PC without cable.
B00BCGROJG,7,15,It hooked up easily, and the picture (both standard and 3D) is amazing.
B00BCGROJG,7,16,It cannot be used to select a channel from the guide--I have to use my cable box remote to select channels.
B00BCGROJG,7,17,Yet it is nice knowing they are there and can be used anytime I want.
B00BCGROJG,7,18,I have nothing but praise for this Television... Hooked up to my DISH and surround system it works impeccably.
B00BCGROJG,7,19,love this TV perfect picture, watched our first 3d movie it was great!!! everything we have is samsung and they all work together!
B00BCGROJG,7,20,All HDMI ports don't work.
B00BCGROJG,7,21,If you are playing a DVD, and for some reason change inputs,the TV says, "Oh he'd done with the DVD", and shuts it off.
B00BCGROJG,7,22,The TV audio is ok, but certainly not as good as my Sony system.3.
B00BCGROJG,7,23,The streaming is better than we hoped for because it's very fluid, even with a wireless connection - much better than previous streaming we've done with our TIVO wireless.
B00BCGROJG,7,24,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,8,0,Great picture.
B00BCGROJG,8,1,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,8,2,Overall picture quality is very good.
B00BCGROJG,8,3,Great price.
B00BCGROJG,8,4,Word cannot say what a great picture this TV has.
B00BCGROJG,8,5,Samsung makes the best HD TV at a good price better than Sony and Sharp and all others.
B00BCGROJG,8,6,The 3D is actually quite good under the right circumstances.
B00BCGROJG,8,7,Sound quality of the LG was great.
B00BCGROJG,8,8,This Tv is a Great value.
B00BCGROJG,8,9,Quality you can expect from a Samsung TV.
B00BCGROJG,8,10,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,8,11,Great Picture, Poor Smarts.
B00BCGROJG,8,12,Great buy!
B00BCGROJG,8,13,I really can not say enough great things about Samsung TVs.
B00BCGROJG,8,14,Am going to replace all sets I have with  Samsung 240 MHz 3D sets .
B00BCGROJG,8,15,Clear picture, and great sound even without sound system.
B00BCGROJG,8,16,The sound is not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,8,17,I would rate the sound as good or better than our 55" Samsung it replaced.
B00BCGROJG,8,18,Great 3D TV.
B00BCGROJG,8,19,Great TVs make everything you watch look better.
B00BCGROJG,8,20,I would not recommend this Samsung nor would I buy another one.
B00BCGROJG,8,21,I have seen this set hooked up at Best Buy and it was very good so I am thinking it was just this set.
B00BCGROJG,8,22,SO FAR SO GOOD.
B00BCGROJG,8,23,Samsung also needs to get it's quality control better.
B00BCGROJG,8,24,Vizio did great in the gaming category and the Samsung surpassed both with gaming.
B00BCGROJG,9,0,There are many, many settings that affect brightness, many settings that affect color balance, etc... so even the last few settings will make a big difference to how the picture looks.
B00BCGROJG,9,1,Under Advanced settings, I have my Dynamic contrast set to Medium, Black Tone set to Dark.
B00BCGROJG,9,2,I don't find this to be much of an issue, however, since I set my black light to 10.  Can you believe it?
B00BCGROJG,9,3,It's not the settings themselves that has the issue.
B00BCGROJG,9,4,I dialed it in while viewing a muppet movie that was on HBO....lots of colors.
B00BCGROJG,9,5,very good TV great picture.
B00BCGROJG,9,6,Great but LED wash out from side.
B00BCGROJG,9,7,10 is more than enough with this set.
B00BCGROJG,9,8,The truth about this set.
B00BCGROJG,9,9,The brightness, the contrast, and the color accuracy right out the box is NUTS.
B00BCGROJG,9,10,If you have been reading the reviews here and thinking, "OMG I will never be able to adjust this picture" then read on.At issue here are the complex advanced settings as well as a lot of the reviewer-recommended settings have the contrast at or near 100.
B00BCGROJG,9,11,Great Picture But..... Great picture with amazing contrast and color "pop" but.....the viewing angles are not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,9,12,This time, I had them set up the TV on the floor and look at both screens side by side.
B00BCGROJG,9,13,This could be okay, if changing the settings was easy, but...- Changing settings is a PAIN IN THE ASS!!
B00BCGROJG,9,14,Then I went into setting and made set it to default.
B00BCGROJG,9,15,As the reviewers said it was set to Dynamic Mode.
B00BCGROJG,9,16,Turned the lights back on in the room to the ;level they usually are at when we watch TV.
B00BCGROJG,9,17,Picture settings.
B00BCGROJG,9,18,Small recommended viewing angle... side viewing is not particularly good (colors and contrast deteriorate fairly quickly if you watch from the sides).Pros:- Excellent picture quality (albeit only inside the viewing angle), once you take the time to set it up (see above for problems, see below for my recommended settings).-
B00BCGROJG,9,19,Be sure to run your TV for 15 hours or so before really messing with the settings - that gives your panel time to "set in".
B00BCGROJG,9,20,I just got this Samsung UN65F7100 LED.
B00BCGROJG,9,21,Under Picture Options I have the Color Tone set to Standard, Auto Motion Plus  set to Clear and Cinema Black to Off.
B00BCGROJG,9,22,But the most complete reviews as to settings all seemed to recommend Movie mode and a contrast at or near 100.
B00BCGROJG,9,23,Flesh tones are mixed in standard setting with some picture calibration of the settings I was able to get them very good.
B00BCGROJG,9,24,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,10,0,3D TV.
B00BCGROJG,10,1,We tried the 3D, but never really got too into it, but it does come with 4 Samsung 3D glasses.
B00BCGROJG,10,2,I was a little skeptical about the active 3D glasses but they work great.
B00BCGROJG,10,3,Great 3D TV.
B00BCGROJG,10,4,I said you know what this TV has 3D and I've never used it.
B00BCGROJG,10,5,The set up was easy.
B00BCGROJG,10,6,Am going to replace all sets I have with  Samsung 240 MHz 3D sets .
B00BCGROJG,10,7,Everything is so easy and assessable.I love the 3d on button on the remote!
B00BCGROJG,10,8,Comes with four battery powered 3D glasses.
B00BCGROJG,10,9,The picture is great and the 3D worked fine with my one 3D Bluray movie Gravity.
B00BCGROJG,10,10,Smart features and 3D working well.
B00BCGROJG,10,11,So what's the difference between active 3D and passive 3D?  Active 3D requires the powered glasses, passive doesn't.
B00BCGROJG,10,12,The functionality is easy to learn and easy to set up.
B00BCGROJG,10,13,It cannot be used to select a channel from the guide--I have to use my cable box remote to select channels.
B00BCGROJG,10,14,Can't wait to watch a 3D movie.
B00BCGROJG,10,15,Active 3D glasses require a battery and are heavier and as I already were prescription eyeglasses I cannot comfortably wear the Active 3D glasses and my eyeglasses, suffice to say the 3D glasses are very uncomfortable!
B00BCGROJG,10,16,Well, not much work.
B00BCGROJG,10,17,TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,10,18,The 3d is amazing and glorious at the same time.
B00BCGROJG,10,19,Includes 4 pairs of 3d glasses.
B00BCGROJG,10,20,The apps are great and works well, only draw back is with remote.
B00BCGROJG,10,21,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,10,22,It comes with four 3D glasses, simple and very comfortable glasses, very light.
B00BCGROJG,10,23,I also set this TV up with the SAMSUNG HT F5500 1000W 3D BD HTIB Home theater system 5.1 surround sound that included a 3D BluRay player.
B00BCGROJG,10,24,10 is more than enough with this set.
B00BCGROJG,11,0,it works.
B00BCGROJG,11,1,My first big Amazon purchase and it was a success!
B00BCGROJG,11,2,I have had tremendous success with Samsung and Amazon's service has always been good to me.
B00BCGROJG,11,3,Problem with my set.
B00BCGROJG,11,4,I have seen this set hooked up at Best Buy and it was very good so I am thinking it was just this set.
B00BCGROJG,11,5,We could have purchased this locally through the Big Box store, but Amazon was a better deal.
B00BCGROJG,11,6,If I have any problems I will update this review.
B00BCGROJG,11,7,Even the LG 47 LA6900 I bought from Amazon has a great picture.
B00BCGROJG,11,8,She finally concluded that I need to have the set serviced.
B00BCGROJG,11,9,I actually did not buy it from Amazon but from a local store because some of the 5-star reviews had me thinking it would be 50/50 if I could get it adjusted right and I didn't want to have to rebox it if I returned it.
B00BCGROJG,11,10,I had done some research on this TV before I bought it and decided for the price point I would purchase one.
B00BCGROJG,11,11,I do recommend that when you purchase one that you go online or to Samsung tech support for help setting up the screen settings which are many but help to make this TV the best I have ever seen!
B00BCGROJG,11,12,Last Samsung I will ever buy.
B00BCGROJG,11,13,I ordered online and purchased a 3 year warranty at a very good price.
B00BCGROJG,11,14,Let me start by saying that I have bought a Samsung TV for every room in the house and ordered all of them through Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,11,15,We purchased it from Paul's TV thru Amazon after checking the 7100 Series at our local Best Buys.
B00BCGROJG,11,16,I researched this TV by looking at all the online reviews for the model ES7100, ES8000 & F8000 Samsung models.
B00BCGROJG,11,17,This is the e-mail i received from Amazon with NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER!Because the TV was defective, we'll pay for the return shipping costs.
B00BCGROJG,11,18,Another great Samsung product.
B00BCGROJG,11,19,That set was a 2010 model but it was way better than the 7100 that I had ordered so I am sure my expectations were high in the first place.
B00BCGROJG,11,20,I would recommend this set to everyone.
B00BCGROJG,11,21,Did some additional research and Samsung always stood out.Ordered the set from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,11,22,I want my money back.I do not see the point of you not accepting a return without the box when AMAZON and SAMSUNG doesn't have any problems with the same item at all.
B00BCGROJG,11,23,I will look into it and I am sure that I can re-adjust a setting to fix this issue.
B00BCGROJG,11,24,No damage to the outside box and no damage to the actual TV box.
B00BCGROJG,12,0,The blu-ray movie I watched was Despicable me, if you have watched this movie before you would know the cute little minions.
B00BCGROJG,12,1,great for watching sports, movies and gaming
B00BCGROJG,12,2,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,12,3,Micro-dimming feature and smart hub are great features.
B00BCGROJG,12,4,Amazing tv, especially for video games!
B00BCGROJG,12,5,This smart TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,12,6,Great Picture, Poor Smarts.
B00BCGROJG,12,7,All the smart features are very nice as well, including the 3D.
B00BCGROJG,12,8,Clear Display...3D movie is good...wireless is good.Smart Hub is good.samsung
B00BCGROJG,12,9,Now I have friends over playing games and watching movies almost every day :)
B00BCGROJG,12,10,Resolution looks amazing, especially while playing video games and watching HD (I wouldn't buy this TV if I didn't have these two).
B00BCGROJG,12,11,Great TV, but be alerted...
B00BCGROJG,12,12,It was like a whole new movie!
B00BCGROJG,12,13,Wifi is very good and able to play many video formats over the network.
B00BCGROJG,12,14,I mean if you want a good TV with a nice screen get it!!!
B00BCGROJG,12,15,The internet set up was easy but login process and apps are clumsy.
B00BCGROJG,12,16,We are able to stream videos and music from the internet.
B00BCGROJG,12,17,Picture quality is great, refresh rate makes HD look movie-like, and the smart Internet linked features are awesome.
B00BCGROJG,12,18,The smart TV app?
B00BCGROJG,12,19,I have a Samsung surround sound hooked up to it making movies and video games amazing.
B00BCGROJG,12,20,This Tv is a Great value.
B00BCGROJG,12,21,Very good TV.
B00BCGROJG,12,22,The most notable difference has been the refresh rate where all the video looks more "live".
B00BCGROJG,12,23,there seem to be many options for tweaking the setting for actual picture quality but only few for refresh rates and the like.
B00BCGROJG,12,24,3D does work, watched few 3D movies from Netflix.
B00BCGROJG,13,0,3 out of 3 screens had a dead pixel.
B00BCGROJG,13,1,Defective screen.
B00BCGROJG,13,2,If you watch a movie with a lot of blacks, dark scenes, you will notice a significant amount of white clouding in the blacked out areas.
B00BCGROJG,13,3,When he saw the screen he said they should not be this bad and I got a bad panel.
B00BCGROJG,13,4,Again, 4 red stuck pixels on the screen, and some pinkish hue to only the right side of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,13,5,Very noticeable in dark scenes.
B00BCGROJG,13,6,In our living room there are off angle seats and you can tell the blacks are not as dark off angle.
B00BCGROJG,13,7,Perfect screen with lighting issue gone!
B00BCGROJG,13,8,My 40in Samsung had some light in the corners when black bars were present for movies.
B00BCGROJG,13,9,I tried also watching "UnderWorld" which is another movie with a lot of night scenes and the clouding is prevalent.
B00BCGROJG,13,10,Immediately noticed 2 red stuck pixels on the screen and some clouding in upper right and lower left sides of the TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,11,After a day, noticed fluorescent green lines at the edge of face or bright objects and more noticeable at the left half of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,13,12,At night, however, the edge-lit LEDs bleed into the screen from the corners and some other cloudy areas show up too.
B00BCGROJG,13,13,Great TV in the day, blotchy blacks at night.
B00BCGROJG,13,14,The left side of the screen seems slightly brighter than the right when viewing a black screen.....it does not appear to affect the picture when watching content - but just worth mentioning.3)
B00BCGROJG,13,15,It also had this bouncing white square go across the top of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,13,16,But this panel up close shows what appears to be black pressure point patches on the top left, top center, and top right corner.
B00BCGROJG,13,17,Once we got into watching DARK movies in a DARK room, we quickly realized that "CLOUDING" and "FLASH LIGHTING" was going to be an issue.
B00BCGROJG,13,18,Blacks feel crushed- especially in dark scenes in the last Harry Potter movie.
B00BCGROJG,13,19,This is the brightest and clearest viewing screen that you will ever view.
B00BCGROJG,13,20,I dialed it in while viewing a muppet movie that was on HBO....lots of colors.
B00BCGROJG,13,21,However,  you get bad flash-lighting and uniformity issues along the sides of the tv, most noticeable in dark scenes with bright areas or end credits.
B00BCGROJG,13,22,The last tv panel was so bad it looked like I was watching movies through cloud cover....clouds that didn't move!!
B00BCGROJG,13,23,Watching reclaimed old black and white movies is a remarkable experience.
B00BCGROJG,13,24,I don't see how anyone could watch a darkish movie like batman or harry potter at night and not be annoyed the whole time.
B00BCGROJG,14,0,Last Samsung purchase.
B00BCGROJG,14,1,Very happy with purchase.
B00BCGROJG,14,2,I already had a Smart TV however I purchased it a couple of years ago.
B00BCGROJG,14,3,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,14,4,I bought and returned two Samsung UN65F7100 tvs recently from a store.
B00BCGROJG,14,5,This is by far the best TV that I have ever bought.
B00BCGROJG,14,6,Buy a set for a 1000.00
B00BCGROJG,14,7,Samsung 55" LED Smart TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,8,I purchased a large and expensive Samsung LED TV from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,14,9,I paid 2300.00 for my 7100 series Samsung LCD TV thinking I was buying quality.
B00BCGROJG,14,10,This will buy me some time so I can try again when the 2014's come out.
B00BCGROJG,14,11,I purchased one from Best Buy in early October 2013.
B00BCGROJG,14,12,I shopped around for quite some time before deciding on this purchase.
B00BCGROJG,14,13,Very happy with my purchase and Amazon Prime.
B00BCGROJG,14,14,Everything you would expect from a Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,14,15,Smart Tv's have evolved over the last couple of years and this is much better than my other TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,16,Gaming-excellent.OTHER COMPARISONS:Before I finally bought the Samsung's.
B00BCGROJG,14,17,Next time going with a Sony or LG.
B00BCGROJG,14,18,I'm 100% happy with my purchase.
B00BCGROJG,14,19,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,20,As stated, my previous TV was an LG and I was quite happy with it for several years.
B00BCGROJG,14,21,BUYING A SAMSUNG IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
B00BCGROJG,14,22,BUYING A SAMSUNG IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
B00BCGROJG,14,23,Wow. Samsung does not disappoint with this television.
B00BCGROJG,14,24,Samsung is great on all products we have owned.
B00BCGROJG,15,0,Before someone tells me that I shouldn't use tv speakers and should instead use a surround sound system, I get that.
B00BCGROJG,15,1,Sound quality is good too.
B00BCGROJG,15,2,annoying was the TV speakers rattle sometimes, at low volume, when on surround sound mode.
B00BCGROJG,15,3,The sound from the built-in speakers is fair but I use external speakers so that doesn't really matter too much to me.
B00BCGROJG,15,4,OTHER REVIEWS COMPLAINED ABOUT THE SOUND NOT BEING LOUD ENOUGH BUT I DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK THAT WAS A PROBLEM.
B00BCGROJG,15,5,every time when i turn on the TV, the sound bar is turned on automatically.
B00BCGROJG,15,6,The sound is good, but I'm going to get some speakers for a better audio experience.
B00BCGROJG,15,7,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,15,8,Hooked up headphones so it doesn't have to be real loud for everyone.
B00BCGROJG,15,9,For example it adjusts the volume on my LG sound bar bit will not control other options on the bar.
B00BCGROJG,15,10,The problem is our baby is in the living room with us a lot, falls asleep, and the real surround sound system will wake him.
B00BCGROJG,15,11,The sound quality without any extra help like a Surround system attached to it , was good enough for a room; however, if you would like to experience a full home theater drill, I suggest a Surround System.
B00BCGROJG,15,12,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,15,13,Clear picture, and great sound even without sound system.
B00BCGROJG,15,14,But the picture quality is great.
B00BCGROJG,15,15,This problem is systemic in all their LCD's and LED's.
B00BCGROJG,15,16,This then required a separate sound connection since I don't use the TV as a source for the sound.
B00BCGROJG,15,17,The built in speakers S. U. C. K.!  But... what do you expect from a TV this thin?!?
B00BCGROJG,15,18,In standard mode they are don't, but sound a little worse.
B00BCGROJG,15,19,The TV has low computing power (like computer with cheap CPU).
B00BCGROJG,15,20,Since a TV this large is likely to go in a decent size room, you'll definitely want to hook it up to an external sound system.
B00BCGROJG,15,21,The sound on this set is good enough in a medium sized living room that I don't feel the need for a home theater or additional speakers.So to recap.
B00BCGROJG,15,22,I have mine hooked up to a Bose surround sound system.
B00BCGROJG,15,23,Sound is OK and the TV has a few different sound settings but nothing special.
B00BCGROJG,15,24,The sound is acceptable, but an external sound system is really necessary for sound immersion.
B00BCGROJG,16,0,I called Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,16,1,Called Samsung and we had service scheduled.
B00BCGROJG,16,2,Customer service was no help.
B00BCGROJG,16,3,Worst when I called support again to record the issue they give me a repair ticket number and a phone number to call.
B00BCGROJG,16,4,I have had the TV for a week now and am still waiting on repair.
B00BCGROJG,16,5,Samsung customer service wasn't very helpful in acknowledging the problem.
B00BCGROJG,16,6,After more than 2 hours on the call I got them to assign the ticket to a new customer service center.
B00BCGROJG,16,7,I contacted Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,16,8,Customer support was incompetent.
B00BCGROJG,16,9,I called Samsung to exchange them.
B00BCGROJG,16,10,Well you betcha I have problems.
B00BCGROJG,16,11,Pray that you don't have any problems with it.
B00BCGROJG,16,12,TV great, customer service not so much.
B00BCGROJG,16,13,By then I can set up a delivery date that works for me.
B00BCGROJG,16,14,After a half hour she called back and said to call the driver.
B00BCGROJG,16,15,I have had tremendous success with Samsung and Amazon's service has always been good to me.
B00BCGROJG,16,16,This is horrible service!
B00BCGROJG,16,17,I called Samsung back and was told that the email would arrive only after the exchange was approved by executive level customer service.
B00BCGROJG,16,18,I do not want this repaired.
B00BCGROJG,16,19,customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at 20% per year.
B00BCGROJG,16,20,They kept on harping that there is nothing they could do until their so called agencies confirmed that there is a problem.
B00BCGROJG,16,21,Dont buy Samsung - they don't last.
B00BCGROJG,16,22,Five days later I get a phone call finally acknowledging receipt of my email, and I was told it would take another seven to fourteen days for me to receive the needed hardware.
B00BCGROJG,16,23,This is the e-mail i received from Amazon with NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER!Because the TV was defective, we'll pay for the return shipping costs.
B00BCGROJG,16,24,I tried to get support from Samsung support center but no help/resolution; then, I called my cable company and they asked me to reset cable box and ALL is well again.
B00BCGROJG,17,0,great TV.
B00BCGROJG,17,1,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,17,2,Very good Quality Tv.
B00BCGROJG,17,3,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,17,4,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,17,5,Good tv.
B00BCGROJG,17,6,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,17,7,Sound quality is good too.
B00BCGROJG,17,8,Great Smart TV.
B00BCGROJG,17,9,Great tv!
B00BCGROJG,17,10,Quality Picture.
B00BCGROJG,17,11,This is a great smart tv.
B00BCGROJG,17,12,Great smart tv.
B00BCGROJG,17,13,This TV is GREAT!
B00BCGROJG,17,14,This is a great TV.
B00BCGROJG,17,15,Awesome TV that looks as good off as it does when it's on.
B00BCGROJG,17,16,The picture quality of this television out of the box is good - but the default settings are atrocious!
B00BCGROJG,17,17,This Samsung Smart TV has incredibly crisp picture quality and overall is a great television.
B00BCGROJG,17,18,Great television with a beautiful picture.
B00BCGROJG,17,19,Very easy to set up.
B00BCGROJG,17,20,The quality of the picture is outstanding.
B00BCGROJG,17,21,Everything else is "As good as it gets."
B00BCGROJG,17,22,The picture quality is amazing as well.
B00BCGROJG,17,23,Outstanding quality.
B00BCGROJG,17,24,Great tv at a great price.
B00BCGROJG,18,0,Do not buy Samsung!!
B00BCGROJG,18,1,BUYING A SAMSUNG IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
B00BCGROJG,18,2,BUYING A SAMSUNG IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
B00BCGROJG,18,3,Last Samsung I will ever buy.
B00BCGROJG,18,4,Beware before buying.
B00BCGROJG,18,5,For the product a 5 stars.
B00BCGROJG,18,6,Buyer beware.
B00BCGROJG,18,7,Besides that I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a new TV
B00BCGROJG,18,8,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,18,9,You will not be disappointed with this TV.
B00BCGROJG,18,10,Definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a new TV
B00BCGROJG,18,11,So to sum it up I am very unhappy with the product itself and would not recommend a Samsung TV to anyone!
B00BCGROJG,18,12,Buy a set for a 1000.00
B00BCGROJG,18,13,I will revise this review once I get the TV.
B00BCGROJG,18,14,I would highly recommend this to anyone
B00BCGROJG,18,15,Buyer Beware!
B00BCGROJG,18,16,Perhaps many of these buyers never had a quality TV before.
B00BCGROJG,18,17,You get a lot for your money
B00BCGROJG,18,18,Samsung quality leaves a lot to be desired.
B00BCGROJG,18,19,*****W A R N I N G*****Do not buy SAMSUNG Televisions!!!
B00BCGROJG,18,20,Would highly recommend this television.
B00BCGROJG,18,21,I would not recommend this Samsung nor would I buy another one.
B00BCGROJG,18,22,Props to Samsung and their quality control.
B00BCGROJG,18,23,This is the 240 Hz so... i can certainly see the difference between the 120 and 240 Hz.
B00BCGROJG,18,24,They came down 3 times to my place and then completely lied to Samsung that they have fixed the problem when they didn't.
B00BCGROJG,19,0,Loaded with apps just like your smartphone.
B00BCGROJG,19,1,There does seem to be a "flow" problem with the SMART tv at times.
B00BCGROJG,19,2,THE BROWSER WORKS FINE BUT I DON'T USE IT...
B00BCGROJG,19,3,The smart TV app?
B00BCGROJG,19,4,Netflix is very fast and Amazon Instant Video is slightly slower but it but not enough to say it's a slug.
B00BCGROJG,19,5,The same problem was found on the Amazon App in the Smart Hub but not as bad.
B00BCGROJG,19,6,Previews are available on like 10 different apps.
B00BCGROJG,19,7,Another app that stands out is the Moviefone app.
B00BCGROJG,19,8,Some work great with no errors or slowness and others constantly buffer and I know it's not my end because I have a very fast internet service.
B00BCGROJG,19,9,I also found that every app in the Smart Hub was very fast and did not cause me to become impatient.
B00BCGROJG,19,10,This will take time getting used too.
B00BCGROJG,19,11,As mentioned the apps open very quickly and the Browser is slow compared to my computer.
B00BCGROJG,19,12,The Browser is capable of playing  " movies of any type that uses Adobe Flash such as ESPN video's music " and so forth.
B00BCGROJG,19,13,Update 11-29-13,  after viewing TV through the Samsung Smart Hub, both Netflix & Amazon Instant Video, I discovered a annoying flaw in the picture format capability.
B00BCGROJG,19,14,If you messed it up and the TV is not working properly, don't work hard and take it of the wall (like I did).
B00BCGROJG,19,15,So my guess is anyone that says their Samsung Smart Hub is slow could be having connect issues?TL-Link  TL-SG1008D Switch  purchased here in Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,19,16,The reason it's slow is  because the factory has it set the Browser App to " MSN News " with a lot of active flash programs that need to finish down-loading.
B00BCGROJG,19,17,The blu-ray movie I watched was Despicable me, if you have watched this movie before you would know the cute little minions.
B00BCGROJG,19,18,Apps I love are Amazon Instant, Hulu, VUDU, Pandora, Media Hub, Crackle, HBO GO, SHOwtime, Netflix, and more.
B00BCGROJG,19,19,The internal wifi works great, so I can stream Amazon Prime movies and Netflix easily.
B00BCGROJG,19,20,Can watch all my favorite movies with Netflix and show all our pictures on the big screen.
B00BCGROJG,19,21,here in Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,19,22,Why even waste everyone's time?
B00BCGROJG,19,23,Only thing is when I'm using YouTube.
B00BCGROJG,19,24,Coming from Android, I'm used to a plethora of apps, but the Samsung Smart TV app store is pretty obscure and definitely has fewer users, so not as many users.
B00BCGROJG,20,0,All HDMI ports don't work.
B00BCGROJG,20,1,Moving on to the TV gadgets, it comes with a bunch of the USB ports and another bunch of HDMI ports as well a 3mm jack port for your sound and a RF so you can interact with your cable or satellite box, and also components RCA ports for your Xbox, PS3 etc.
B00BCGROJG,20,2,It cannot be used to select a channel from the guide--I have to use my cable box remote to select channels.
B00BCGROJG,20,3,Just disconnect the HDMI cables from the external devices and re-arrange them.
B00BCGROJG,20,4,I connected them with HDMI cables, while hooking sound system with optical cable directly to TV.
B00BCGROJG,20,5,No lag when changing channels.
B00BCGROJG,20,6,would anyone need 4 HDMI inputs?
B00BCGROJG,20,7,THE TV ONLY HAD DIGITAL OUTPUT TO AN EXTERNAL SOURCE BUT YOU CAN PICK UP A DIGITAL TO ANALOG CONVERTER FOR $15 BUCKS AND HOOK THE TV UP TO YOUR OLD AMP IF NEED BE.
B00BCGROJG,20,8,Makes input switching much easier, you dont have to.
B00BCGROJG,20,9,Well you betcha I have problems.
B00BCGROJG,20,10,However, the problem is after the TV allows the receiver to power on, it will ALWAYS send a change source signal to change to the source to TV.
B00BCGROJG,20,11,even with a reciever hooked up it still puts the tv on the that input, it learned.
B00BCGROJG,20,12,I've only watched cable tv so far (via the cable box and HDMI), but I've seen the Samsung GUI and it looks amazing, so I'll be trying that as soon as the tv is connected to the internet.
B00BCGROJG,20,13,I was presented with the initial setup, this was easy, connecting to my home wireless was a snap, it recognized my DISH Network box, and my other components I had installed immediately .
B00BCGROJG,20,14,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,20,15,When connecting wirelessly, there is a 40 second or so "lag" before a connection is established.
B00BCGROJG,20,16,Dont buy Samsung - they don't last.
B00BCGROJG,20,17,I HAVE A COMPUTER FOR THAT.
B00BCGROJG,20,18,I have nothing but praise for this Television... Hooked up to my DISH and surround system it works impeccably.
B00BCGROJG,20,19,Plugged in power and HDMI and it worked.
B00BCGROJG,20,20,We have a 25 Mbps Internet connection, and only a Wireless G router (54 Mbps) on the LAN side, and we have not had any problems streaming video.
B00BCGROJG,20,21,Apparently, Samsung is "working" on a fix, but not date has been promised, although this is not a brand new tv.
B00BCGROJG,20,22,this TV wireless connection is very bad.
B00BCGROJG,20,23,I can't plug my Direct TV HDMI cable to the Samsung ARC input and maybe someone on here will be able to steer me to the right direction.
B00BCGROJG,20,24,The HDMI inputs are on one side of the TV and power cord on the other side.
B00BCGROJG,21,0,Samsung is great on all products we have owned.
B00BCGROJG,21,1,Plus, the Amazon service was A+, as usual.
B00BCGROJG,21,2,The picture is great, screen mirroring, Samsung Apps..
B00BCGROJG,21,3,The smart TV app?
B00BCGROJG,21,4,This if forgivable as you DO NOT WANT TO USE THEIR SMART TV anyway if you can.
B00BCGROJG,21,5,Good product - horrid support.
B00BCGROJG,21,6,There does seem to be a "flow" problem with the SMART tv at times.
B00BCGROJG,21,7,The SMART tv menu  was easy to set up and I use it with Netflix and Amazon Prime features.
B00BCGROJG,21,8,Coming from Android, I'm used to a plethora of apps, but the Samsung Smart TV app store is pretty obscure and definitely has fewer users, so not as many users.
B00BCGROJG,21,9,Great features.
B00BCGROJG,21,10,By the way, your deal with AE to obtain product with points is the best service you offer.
B00BCGROJG,21,11,Another app that stands out is the Moviefone app.
B00BCGROJG,21,12,Great Smart Features, they most likely have any app or service you could want.Cons:1.
B00BCGROJG,21,13,I have a few Samsung products including this TV.
B00BCGROJG,21,14,The main reason for the 1 star is because of their customer service.
B00BCGROJG,21,15,The remote, however, is dysfunctional.
B00BCGROJG,21,16,This TV brings all the goodies, a Browser (Great Browser) with PIP (Picture in Picture) so you can browse and watch TV at the same time,  Netflix App, Youtube, the 3D mini channel etc.
B00BCGROJG,21,17,There went another $20 on Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,21,18,Micro-dimming feature and smart hub are great features.
B00BCGROJG,21,19,Samsung phone/tablet division needs to take over it's TV division's software quality control.Don't buy this TV for it's smarts ... it really is NOT smart & very sluggish (slow) if you to do anything of substance on the web.Potentially a great product ... but Samsung TV division needs to fix its software quality control problems.
B00BCGROJG,21,20,The same problem was found on the Amazon App in the Smart Hub but not as bad.
B00BCGROJG,21,21,The main apps such as netflix, hulu, YouTube work great without any problems but I suspect the developers also built them well.
B00BCGROJG,21,22,Amazon provides the best service and the best pricing and has for all the years we have been customers whether it is books, e-books, movies on Prime, all sorts of products we've gotten, etc.
B00BCGROJG,21,23,I HAD READ SOME REVIEWS WHERE PEOPLE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE REMOTE NOT BEING STANDARD AND BEING MORE LIKE A SMART PHONE WITH THE SCREEN.
B00BCGROJG,21,24,Also,  the delivery and set up feature was such a blessing to me as I am older and it is difficult to unbox and set up a large tv by myself.
B00BCGROJG,22,0,bottom-line is this smart TV just like a Not-Smart-TV.
B00BCGROJG,22,1,wireless is not work.
B00BCGROJG,22,2,Not too smart.
B00BCGROJG,22,3,Connected without a problem.
B00BCGROJG,22,4,Getting back to the Smart Hub.
B00BCGROJG,22,5,The same problem was found on the Amazon App in the Smart Hub but not as bad.
B00BCGROJG,22,6,The is a smart TV. 5 star for the TV part. 1 start for "smart" part.
B00BCGROJG,22,7,this TV wireless connection is very bad.
B00BCGROJG,22,8,i couldn't use the Wi-fi to watch the internet TV.
B00BCGROJG,22,9,Great Smart Features, they most likely have any app or service you could want.Cons:1.
B00BCGROJG,22,10,Since I have to get an Apple TV, why i need a Smart TV?
B00BCGROJG,22,11,And I called Samsung support who told me all of my problems were thanks to my wireless router.
B00BCGROJG,22,12,I also found that every app in the Smart Hub was very fast and did not cause me to become impatient.
B00BCGROJG,22,13,Samsung phone/tablet division needs to take over it's TV division's software quality control.Don't buy this TV for it's smarts ... it really is NOT smart & very sluggish (slow) if you to do anything of substance on the web.Potentially a great product ... but Samsung TV division needs to fix its software quality control problems.
B00BCGROJG,22,14,So my guess is anyone that says their Samsung Smart Hub is slow could be having connect issues?TL-Link  TL-SG1008D Switch  purchased here in Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,22,15,Nifty.My part of the TV set-up took 15 minutes - including times for a 6 minute software update and establishing my wifi connection.
B00BCGROJG,22,16,Not a feature we were looking for but it works well.3.
B00BCGROJG,22,17,When it comes to TV, Samsung is a no brainer.
B00BCGROJG,22,18,I'm having a slight issue with Netflix and Amazon, during the Streaming Process.
B00BCGROJG,22,19,This if forgivable as you DO NOT WANT TO USE THEIR SMART TV anyway if you can.
B00BCGROJG,22,20,I have 50 mbps wi-fi but only get 10 mbps with severe latency.
B00BCGROJG,22,21,The 'smart' is anything but.
B00BCGROJG,22,22,Only issue is the remote contrôl.
B00BCGROJG,22,23,For internet use, a hard-wire is a must, no no no use the wireless.
B00BCGROJG,22,24,Also bought a wireless keyboard to use with this TV.
B00BCGROJG,23,0,If there is one thing that I dislike, it is the remote control.
B00BCGROJG,23,1,I didn't see any.I will say that the remote takes some getting used to.
B00BCGROJG,23,2,The remote, however, is dysfunctional.
B00BCGROJG,23,3,It would be nice, though, to have these buttons on the remote.-
B00BCGROJG,23,4,Could Samsung simplify the remote by not using the swype pad?
B00BCGROJG,23,5,I also like the remote but you have to use it before you can get aquanted enough to get the intent of the designer.
B00BCGROJG,23,6,The only thing that I do not like its the mute button on the remote.
B00BCGROJG,23,7,Beyond that, the unit is ascetically pleasing and looks great mounted on the wall.
B00BCGROJG,23,8,Has a lighting feature so remote buttons light up in the dark.
B00BCGROJG,23,9,The ONLY complaint is with the remote control unit itself.
B00BCGROJG,23,10,Intuitive.The remote with a touch pad works okay.
B00BCGROJG,23,11,Remote, nice.
B00BCGROJG,23,12,The picture is good, the interface is very responsive, the remote works well.
B00BCGROJG,23,13,Nice!The remote, as reviewed by others, take some getting used to but it pretty good.
B00BCGROJG,23,14,The remote touch pad takes some getting used to.
B00BCGROJG,23,15,It is the dumbest remote ever.
B00BCGROJG,23,16,The remote is ok but we have a universal remote for all the components, so no big deal.
B00BCGROJG,23,17,Easy setup and a touch pad remote.
B00BCGROJG,23,18,I found the remote easy to use and very intuitive.
B00BCGROJG,23,19,Setup is quite easy; you assemble the stand parts (2) with 4 *very tiny* screws, and then attach the stand to the TV with yet another 4 of the same screws.
B00BCGROJG,23,20,It is smarter than we are so we are learning all the features of the remote.
B00BCGROJG,23,21,A programable buttoned remote may be a good idea.
B00BCGROJG,23,22,I like and use the tv remote sometimes paired with the cable remote but my wife is strictly a cable remote user.
B00BCGROJG,23,23,Every time that I grab the remote it mutes the tv (because the mute button it is one of its sides).
B00BCGROJG,23,24,It is small, and doesn't have many buttons.
B00BCGROJG,24,0,Do not buy Samsung!!
B00BCGROJG,24,1,Samsung UN65F7100 review.
B00BCGROJG,24,2,They will not replace them under warranty and say they are normal.
B00BCGROJG,24,3,Dont buy Samsung - they don't last.
B00BCGROJG,24,4,Now 2 years later - same problem.
B00BCGROJG,24,5,For 58.00 more you now have a 5 year warranty.
B00BCGROJG,24,6,65" Samsung replaces 55" Panasonic VT30.
B00BCGROJG,24,7,Samsung TV's have serious problems.
B00BCGROJG,24,8,*****W A R N I N G*****Do not buy SAMSUNG Televisions!!!
B00BCGROJG,24,9,Review for Samsung UN75F7100  75" LED TV.
B00BCGROJG,24,10,I have now downgraded this TV to a "1" since a tv that costs this much should not have this issue, and Samsung knows it.
B00BCGROJG,24,11,None of the Sonys we liked were available (2012 models); then, we saw this Samsung for a very good price and decided to buy.
B00BCGROJG,24,12,I made the mistake of not starting with Samsung when the problems first stared a year ago.Random turning itself off.
B00BCGROJG,24,13,I am having issues with a 14 month old Samsung that cost $3000.It is a 65" LCD LED 3 D Samsung.I am in the Costco extended warranty.
B00BCGROJG,24,14,The Samsung picture is impressive yet the problems are significant.I think I will go back to buying Vizio.
B00BCGROJG,24,15,Having Problems.
B00BCGROJG,24,16,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,24,17,I have one of the popular Panasonic plasma tvs from 2012, and it doesn't do this.
B00BCGROJG,24,18,Buy a set for a 1000.00
B00BCGROJG,24,19,The 8000 series samsung looked the best followed by any of the samsungs afterwards.
B00BCGROJG,24,20,Samsung LED Products Suffer huge Clouding/Flashlighting Problems.
B00BCGROJG,24,21,Samsung LED Products Suffer huge Clouding/Flashlighting Problems.
B00BCGROJG,24,22,Great picture/dead in 3 months.
B00BCGROJG,24,23,I got a replacement and that unit had the same issue on the same day!
B00BCGROJG,24,24,This will buy me some time so I can try again when the 2014's come out.
B00BCGROJG,25,0,Then I went into setting and made set it to default.
B00BCGROJG,25,1,This will take time getting used too.
B00BCGROJG,25,2,It's cold up here, so they wouldn't turn it on....but no problems found.
B00BCGROJG,25,3,would anyone need 4 HDMI inputs?
B00BCGROJG,25,4,It made a clicking sound when you pressed the power button, but no image or sound.
B00BCGROJG,25,5,I don't see how anyone could watch a darkish movie like batman or harry potter at night and not be annoyed the whole time.
B00BCGROJG,25,6,I didn't see any.I will say that the remote takes some getting used to.
B00BCGROJG,25,7,However, when I plugged the TV in for the first time, it was if there were two parts to the display.
B00BCGROJG,25,8,When the TV is powered on, it will also start the receiver.
B00BCGROJG,25,9,If you are playing a DVD, and for some reason change inputs,the TV says, "Oh he'd done with the DVD", and shuts it off.
B00BCGROJG,25,10,If there is one thing that I dislike, it is the remote control.
B00BCGROJG,25,11,Got it home, set it up, powered on.
B00BCGROJG,25,12,I love the remote!
B00BCGROJG,25,13,Connected without a problem.
B00BCGROJG,25,14,You will need to use a universal remote (making sure you disable the powering on from the remote as the TV will do this on it's own) or the receiver remote to change the receiver input back to the correct device.
B00BCGROJG,25,15,The remote, however, is dysfunctional.
B00BCGROJG,25,16,It was easy to set up the TV took about 30 minutes.
B00BCGROJG,25,17,All you have to do is turn it on to see it...surely they turn them on before they left the factory.*Update*I've
B00BCGROJG,25,18,However, the problem is after the TV allows the receiver to power on, it will ALWAYS send a change source signal to change to the source to TV.
B00BCGROJG,25,19,It started flickering every few seconds after the firmware update next day and that gave me some hard time.
B00BCGROJG,25,20,That said, if you hold the channel button down it will move through a hundred channels within seconds.
B00BCGROJG,25,21,The colors are putrid by default (and still not great after a few hours of calibration), backlight is splotchy, and soap-opera mode spontaneously turns itself on every few weeks (AutoMotion plus OFF on all inputs) and the only way to fix it is to physically unplug the TV.
B00BCGROJG,25,22,The picture quality is great, just be sure to shut off all the different motion settings.
B00BCGROJG,25,23,been watching this tv for several days now.
B00BCGROJG,25,24,Half of the time, we are unable to change the channel.
B00AOA9BL0,0,0,Watching on  such a small screen does.
B00AOA9BL0,0,1,Sitting on my back porch watching missed TV shows its nice.
B00AOA9BL0,0,2,almost perfect.
B00AOA9BL0,0,3,Works great!
B00AOA9BL0,0,4,Works Great on My Ipod.
B00AOA9BL0,0,5,Good but one big flaw.
B00AOA9BL0,0,6,I watched the Dark Shadow movie the other day and it was good.
B00AOA9BL0,0,7,Very nice.
B00AOA9BL0,0,8,Any time I can take CNN to the bathroom is a good thing.
B00AOA9BL0,0,9,I'm on the go.Now i can watch TV on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,0,10,Being able to watch some shows live being away from home is great also.
B00AOA9BL0,0,11,It's fun and useful, just my wish and it could've been perfect.
B00AOA9BL0,0,12,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,0,13,But I do love the convenience of watching shows I have missed without having to go to the tv room.
B00AOA9BL0,0,14,I love watching TV while I am using the treadmill but we have no TV in the exercise room.
B00AOA9BL0,0,15,Watching movies is great!
B00AOA9BL0,0,16,Screen looks good but stops.
B00AOA9BL0,0,17,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,0,18,amazed at how good it works.
B00AOA9BL0,0,19,Pretty Good.
B00AOA9BL0,0,20,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,0,21,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,0,22,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,0,23,When I first got it it was awesome an worked great.
B00AOA9BL0,0,24,Other than that it's got good shows and I love it
B00AOA9BL0,1,0,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,1,1,Best around.
B00AOA9BL0,1,2,I love to bookmark my faves and just veg out and get caught up on my shows.
B00AOA9BL0,1,3,It's free is the only good thing that I didn't buy it.
B00AOA9BL0,1,4,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,1,5,Other than that it's got good shows and I love it
B00AOA9BL0,1,6,Great when on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,1,7,But I have good reason now.
B00AOA9BL0,1,8,Upgrade was good.
B00AOA9BL0,1,9,I had no reason to believe it wouldn't be the same fantastic quality.
B00AOA9BL0,1,10,Not  a lot to pick from but has good choices.
B00AOA9BL0,1,11,Its good, not great.
B00AOA9BL0,1,12,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,1,13,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,1,14,Like others have said...Good but not great!
B00AOA9BL0,1,15,When I first got it it was awesome an worked great.
B00AOA9BL0,1,16,Great.
B00AOA9BL0,1,17,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,1,18,amazed at how good it works.
B00AOA9BL0,1,19,My son loves it!
B00AOA9BL0,1,20,Worked great for about a week.
B00AOA9BL0,1,21,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,1,22,It's free and work great.
B00AOA9BL0,1,23,Great...
B00AOA9BL0,1,24,Good find!
B00AOA9BL0,2,0,Otherwise, there is no sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,1,The picture and sound were both great.
B00AOA9BL0,2,2,Great quality.
B00AOA9BL0,2,3,Not hard when there are no other sounds around though.
B00AOA9BL0,2,4,Good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,5,great.
B00AOA9BL0,2,6,The sound is good with headphones.
B00AOA9BL0,2,7,It's good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,2,8,Overall good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,9,good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,10,And I have good hearing.
B00AOA9BL0,2,11,Good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,2,12,good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,2,13,If they could fix the sound, I'd give it 5 stars.
B00AOA9BL0,2,14,sound is better.
B00AOA9BL0,2,15,Picture is great  but I cannot hear the audio  very dissappointed .
B00AOA9BL0,2,16,Great except.
B00AOA9BL0,2,17,Good App, Horrible Sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,18,Sound issue.
B00AOA9BL0,2,19,Good App,but...
B00AOA9BL0,2,20,Good experience.
B00AOA9BL0,2,21,Pretty good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,22,It's a good way to watch when there is no tv around.
B00AOA9BL0,2,23,The last one I had was very low and I never went on it much because of the sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,24,not so good.
B00AOA9BL0,3,0,It works great.
B00AOA9BL0,3,1,So it works great about 90% of the time, and I really like it.
B00AOA9BL0,3,2,Works great most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,3,3,Did not work with my TV.
B00AOA9BL0,3,4,Its good, not great.
B00AOA9BL0,3,5,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,3,6,Tried this 3 or 4 time over 2 days.
B00AOA9BL0,3,7,serviceable.
B00AOA9BL0,3,8,That's one less homework assignment when you arrive home.
B00AOA9BL0,3,9,Though I am satisfied with my services, the customer service would rate at best a D-, and cost for those services about the same.
B00AOA9BL0,3,10,Maybe one day it will.
B00AOA9BL0,3,11,I love it because I can watch my shows the day after if I miss then... with on-demand I have to wait a week.
B00AOA9BL0,3,12,It does not work with all the boxes in the house.
B00AOA9BL0,3,13,I have an hour long commute to and from work.
B00AOA9BL0,3,14,great App once I got it working.
B00AOA9BL0,3,15,I have only used it a few times but it worked flawlessly.
B00AOA9BL0,3,16,shows have a 2 week lagtime.
B00AOA9BL0,3,17,Looks good so far.
B00AOA9BL0,3,18,Any time I can take CNN to the bathroom is a good thing.
B00AOA9BL0,3,19,But it works really good
B00AOA9BL0,3,20,It works really good.
B00AOA9BL0,3,21,It's free and work great.
B00AOA9BL0,3,22,Yep, days.
B00AOA9BL0,3,23,Used for the first time and I'm impressed.
B00AOA9BL0,3,24,good.
B00AOA9BL0,4,0,Ok but not great.

B00AOA9BL0,4,3,Easy to use.

B00AOA9BL0,4,13,Overall good value.
B00AOA9BL0,4,14,Easy to use and somewhat fast.
B00AOA9BL0,4,15,Easy to use and navigate, I just wish I could get ppv on it.
B00AOA9BL0,4,16,Watching movies is great!
B00AOA9BL0,4,17,Instructions not clear.

B00AOA9BL0,6,3,Must have app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,4,I would like to see these incorporated into this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,5,The potential for this app is there.

B00AOA9BL0,6,23,Great App.
B00AOA9BL0,6,24,great app.
B00AOA9BL0,7,0,Cable went out during a recent ice storm.
B00AOA9BL0,7,1,If I wanted to watch it at home I would use the cable box.
B00AOA9BL0,7,2,works great.
B00AOA9BL0,7,3,The quality it'snot hd and mightnot translate well if you connect it to your tv but it did fine on the device.
B00AOA9BL0,7,4,Great ap.
B00AOA9BL0,7,5,You can have TV anywhere you have a connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,6,great player.
B00AOA9BL0,7,7,Good.
B00AOA9BL0,7,8,Otherwise, it's a very good player.
B00AOA9BL0,7,9,Best to have a good internet connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,10,Of course, it would be nice if Viacom network shows were available or if cable wasn't so absurdly overpriced, but you can't have everything.
B00AOA9BL0,7,11,A Good Player.
B00AOA9BL0,7,12,It's free and work great.
B00AOA9BL0,7,13,It works for what I need it for.
B00AOA9BL0,7,14,Satellite or cable required.
B00AOA9BL0,7,15,Just wish I could connect to my home dvr.
B00AOA9BL0,7,16,Doesn't always want  to work though.
B00AOA9BL0,7,17,It allows me to watch anywhere with great quality of video.
B00AOA9BL0,7,18,Tv Player for comcast!
B00AOA9BL0,7,19,App works well, I was able to watch even with a low internet connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,20,This app asks for a TV provider, like a cable service etc.
B00AOA9BL0,7,21,Some network shows are available for streaming after broadcast, but it's hit-and-miss.
B00AOA9BL0,7,22,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,7,23,you can not use your hmdi cable you can only watch it on your device.
B00AOA9BL0,7,24,When I first got it it was awesome an worked great.
B00AOA9BL0,8,0,ok but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,8,1,Good!
B00AOA9BL0,8,2,Doesn't get any better.
B00AOA9BL0,8,3,That would be even better.
B00AOA9BL0,8,4,Any time I can take CNN to the bathroom is a good thing.
B00AOA9BL0,8,5,Otherwise good picture quality and user friendly.
B00AOA9BL0,8,6,As if the price of cable wasn't enough.
B00AOA9BL0,8,7,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,8,8,Not hard when there are no other sounds around though.
B00AOA9BL0,8,9,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,8,10,This app is very easy to use and works great.
B00AOA9BL0,8,11,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,8,12,Best to have a good internet connection.
B00AOA9BL0,8,13,The app would be better if it had more options and better organization.
B00AOA9BL0,8,14,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,8,15,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,8,16,Quality is good and there are a ton of shows to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,8,17,Good appNeeds more movies for basic people with basic cable not many live shows available either other than that it's good food HD videos fast streaming
B00AOA9BL0,8,18,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,8,19,many shoes have no sound!!  would be better if i could watch live tv and every station that i pay for
B00AOA9BL0,8,20,Finding a movie is a bit tiresome unless you know the specific movie.
B00AOA9BL0,8,21,It allows me to watch anywhere with great quality of video.
B00AOA9BL0,8,22,Like others say...we do pay pretty good money for our internet and cable services, think you guys can offer something a lot better by fixing the problems.
B00AOA9BL0,8,23,It's great and easy to use a good improvement provided by comcast I would recommend it to a friend for sure
B00AOA9BL0,8,24,So it works great about 90% of the time, and I really like it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,0,Sound issue.
B00AOA9BL0,9,1,various channels have different volume settings and is difficult toadjust sound properly.
B00AOA9BL0,9,2,It's great when I'm not at home
B00AOA9BL0,9,3,Otherwise, there is no sound.
B00AOA9BL0,9,4,I do wish you could attach to a tv to watch on bigger screen.
B00AOA9BL0,9,5,When you close out and start back up it should bring you to a home screen instead of where you left off..
B00AOA9BL0,9,6,My only issue is sometimes the sound cuts out for a second or two.
B00AOA9BL0,9,7,When watching shows it won't play at full volume even if its set with the volume all the way up.
B00AOA9BL0,9,8,good app.
B00AOA9BL0,9,9,Check the settings panel; both volume and brightness control can be exposed.
B00AOA9BL0,9,10,I suggest that this be fixed for optimum viewing considering the cable is paid for by its customers.
B00AOA9BL0,9,11,It allows me to watch anywhere with great quality of video.
B00AOA9BL0,9,12,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,9,13,This works pretty well on device.
B00AOA9BL0,9,14,Volume controls are set to low, hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,9,15,When your show is playing tap the right side of the screen and the volume slider comes up.
B00AOA9BL0,9,16,It gets very annoying when one is trying to watch a good movie or show.
B00AOA9BL0,9,17,I found this app very good, but definitely needs build in volume control.
B00AOA9BL0,9,18,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,9,19,great app.
B00AOA9BL0,9,20,Good appNeeds more movies for basic people with basic cable not many live shows available either other than that it's good food HD videos fast streaming
B00AOA9BL0,9,21,I watched the Dark Shadow movie the other day and it was good.
B00AOA9BL0,9,22,For those having problems with the volume being to low I found that if you go to settings in the app, then playback options, then click on volume control you can make it pretty loud.
B00AOA9BL0,9,23,Been having a lot of issues with tv shows an  movies not playing.
B00AOA9BL0,9,24,It was a bit hard to get set up and I had to enlist a younger person to help.
B00AOA9BL0,10,0,Easy to use
B00AOA9BL0,10,1,great for watching shows on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,10,2,Easy to use too.
B00AOA9BL0,10,3,Easy to use.
B00AOA9BL0,10,4,needs a rewind button, otherwise, it's great.
B00AOA9BL0,10,5,It works, BUT...
B00AOA9BL0,10,6,Great so.
B00AOA9BL0,10,7,Easy as Scroll, select, and watch.
B00AOA9BL0,10,8,Except for when it sometimes doesn't work, it's awesome.
B00AOA9BL0,10,9,nice layout and easy to use.
B00AOA9BL0,10,10,This app is very easy to use and works great.
B00AOA9BL0,10,11,If you fix this problem and the app still isn't working, then press the power button on your kindle for 30 seconds and after that turn the device back on.
B00AOA9BL0,10,12,It works quite well if you are willing to wear earphones all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,10,13,Easy navigation.
B00AOA9BL0,10,14,The app works well on my Galaxy 3. I love being able to watch my programs when I have downtime at work.
B00AOA9BL0,10,15,Works well with Comcast although one has to be careful when scrolling thru the channel guide or you will be accidentally changing channels.Great having channel guide, DVR manager, Movies and more on one screen.
B00AOA9BL0,10,16,Still wish I can watch all channels live tho.
B00AOA9BL0,10,17,easy to use and I can watch tv while I work.
B00AOA9BL0,10,18,I love it!Simple, easy and cool.
B00AOA9BL0,10,19,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,10,20,But there is no volume control on the app (have to use device setting), and no fast forward or rewind.
B00AOA9BL0,10,21,Great quality video,  but controls are difficult.
B00AOA9BL0,10,22,This app works, but only for watching available shows directly on our Fire HD 8.9.
B00AOA9BL0,10,23,I've had cable TV for years but tend to watch the same programs all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,10,24,TOO MANY IMAGES OPEN.
B00AOA9BL0,11,0,It works.... IT works but that is about all I can say about it.
B00AOA9BL0,11,1,Did not work with my TV.
B00AOA9BL0,11,2,Works very well.
B00AOA9BL0,11,3,Works well for what it is.
B00AOA9BL0,11,4,Wish they would provide full service for all the channels, including locals, that I pay a great deal for at home.
B00AOA9BL0,11,5,One MAJOR problem.
B00AOA9BL0,11,6,I guess my big TV is too old for this product!
B00AOA9BL0,11,7,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,11,8,Works perfect, but Amazon needs to update when this app updates nationally.
B00AOA9BL0,11,9,The movies are great.
B00AOA9BL0,11,10,I'd give this five stars if I could have viewed the Olympics when I was out of town the other day.
B00AOA9BL0,11,11,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,11,12,Hope they work out the issues because it could be a very good application.
B00AOA9BL0,11,13,All shows all movies ALL THE TIME.
B00AOA9BL0,11,14,So it works great about 90% of the time, and I really like it.
B00AOA9BL0,11,15,Works great most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,16,The player only works half the time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,17,It's free is the only good thing that I didn't buy it.
B00AOA9BL0,11,18,Though I am satisfied with my services, the customer service would rate at best a D-, and cost for those services about the same.
B00AOA9BL0,11,19,Like others say...we do pay pretty good money for our internet and cable services, think you guys can offer something a lot better by fixing the problems.
B00AOA9BL0,11,20,Works fine and I like how it saved my place as I had to stop several times during my movie.
B00AOA9BL0,11,21,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,11,22,This has at times been a painful lesson!
B00AOA9BL0,11,23,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,11,24,I've had cable TV for years but tend to watch the same programs all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,12,0,Great app.
B00AOA9BL0,12,1,The app is great.
B00AOA9BL0,12,2,Good app.
B00AOA9BL0,12,3,Right now, the only option is to show (or not show) adult movies.
B00AOA9BL0,12,4,If they click on a different movie outside of the rating group, there's nothing stopping them from watching it.When these options are worked into the app, I'll happily be back to try it out again.
B00AOA9BL0,12,5,I've had several shows that I have yet to see the end of because I tried to go back and the video froze.
B00AOA9BL0,12,6,All shows all movies ALL THE TIME.
B00AOA9BL0,12,7,This is a very nice app.
B00AOA9BL0,12,8,nice app.
B00AOA9BL0,12,9,When I first got this app, it was great.
B00AOA9BL0,12,10,If this feature was available this app would be much more useful.The other feature is actually having parental controls.
B00AOA9BL0,12,11,Good app.
B00AOA9BL0,12,12,good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,12,13,This doesn't happen when I'm watching Netflix or live streaming from a network such as CNN.
B00AOA9BL0,12,14,If some of the features Amazon video and Netflix have would be on this app, the app would go from good to excellent.
B00AOA9BL0,12,15,Volume will not go load enough, and will not play movies on tv with grim cable hook up, but I do like the app besides that
B00AOA9BL0,12,16,This is my first time using an app to watch tv.
B00AOA9BL0,12,17,I get shows I could  not get on Netflix with good reception, and clear video.
B00AOA9BL0,12,18,Great quality video,  but controls are difficult.
B00AOA9BL0,12,19,It's good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,12,20,okay but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,12,21,This issue I have with said content is its crippling effect on the app thus far.
B00AOA9BL0,12,22,The live TV feature is very useful, but a bit hard to control.
B00AOA9BL0,12,23,Great for catching up on my shows while my boyfriend plays ps3.
B00AOA9BL0,12,24,Pretty good.
B00AOA9BL0,13,0,Shows the bitrate on some movies right in the middle of the screen.
B00AOA9BL0,13,1,There is a green bar at the top of your screen.
B00AOA9BL0,13,2,I can't watch any movie without a subscription.You know what we have so that's what should pop up only
B00AOA9BL0,13,3,Gotta get these problems fixed or no one will want it!!
B00AOA9BL0,13,4,Watching on  such a small screen does.
B00AOA9BL0,13,5,not bad.
B00AOA9BL0,13,6,I watched the Dark Shadow movie the other day and it was good.
B00AOA9BL0,13,7,First show there were a few times it stopped and then started.
B00AOA9BL0,13,8,A lot worse.
B00AOA9BL0,13,9,It's noticeable enough to be annoying.
B00AOA9BL0,13,10,Lots of shows & movies to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,13,11,It gets very annoying when one is trying to watch a good movie or show.
B00AOA9BL0,13,12,Started off great, but as weeks went by, there was less & I was able to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,13,13,I can watch the programs that I want away from home, or even at home, if someone else is using the tv to watch something that I don't want to see.
B00AOA9BL0,13,14,Fade in fade out.
B00AOA9BL0,13,15,Really wanted this to work- tried to watch Hollywood Game Night.
B00AOA9BL0,13,16,Been having a lot of issues with tv shows an  movies not playing.
B00AOA9BL0,13,17,Watching movies is great!
B00AOA9BL0,13,18,Out of the 20+ times I've tried this, maybe 3 or 4 times I was actually able to watch something.
B00AOA9BL0,13,19,It takes almost 3hrs to watch a movie that's only an 1hrs 30mins late.
B00AOA9BL0,13,20,I like being able to watch my movies on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,13,21,I have watched a lot of shows and movies with this app.
B00AOA9BL0,13,22,I just watched half of an hour long show, and got to see the same ad about 30 times.
B00AOA9BL0,13,23,I great an hour lunch break and I can watch one complete show.
B00AOA9BL0,13,24,Being able to watch some shows live being away from home is great also.
B00AOA9BL0,14,0,Been trying for months and no success.
B00AOA9BL0,14,1,This has never worked in the 5 months I have it.
B00AOA9BL0,14,2,Had It 5 Months- Never Worked.
B00AOA9BL0,14,3,Other than that I am happy.
B00AOA9BL0,14,4,Buy a nook
B00AOA9BL0,14,5,Overall I am happy with it.
B00AOA9BL0,14,6,Not a happy camper.
B00AOA9BL0,14,7,I so wished I knew about this trouble before my purchase.
B00AOA9BL0,14,8,I really enjoyed it until a few weeks ago.
B00AOA9BL0,14,9,This could happen once or twice per show or sometimes so often it's not even worth the trouble.
B00AOA9BL0,14,10,Thankfully, after almost a year they FINALLY fixed that problem!More.recently,
B00AOA9BL0,14,11,When it works, I love it.
B00AOA9BL0,14,12,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,14,13,I've had this for a few months now and it has never worked once.
B00AOA9BL0,14,14,So it works great about 90% of the time, and I really like it.
B00AOA9BL0,14,15,Works great most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,16,Worked great for about a week.
B00AOA9BL0,14,17,It's great whwn it works.
B00AOA9BL0,14,18,It works great!
B00AOA9BL0,14,19,For the most part it works great.
B00AOA9BL0,14,20,Works - Most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,21,It stops working all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,22,only works about half the time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,23,Gave it a one star because it did not work, don't like the word hate.
B00AOA9BL0,14,24,When it works it's great.
B00AOA9BL0,15,0,Volume controls are set to low, hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,15,1,volume.
B00AOA9BL0,15,2,i wish it had it's own audio control.
B00AOA9BL0,15,3,volume is awful!
B00AOA9BL0,15,4,its okay, but sometimes hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,15,5,I have a Bluetooth speaker for my kindle, so sound isn't a problem.
B00AOA9BL0,15,6,As mentioned by others the volume is very low even with head phones and using external speakers only makes it slightly more of normal  volume level but not really loud so if your hard of hearing or are you are multitasking you may not really hear much.
B00AOA9BL0,15,7,It's always low even though my volume is all the way up.
B00AOA9BL0,15,8,Can't get volume.
B00AOA9BL0,15,9,The volume used to be an issue.
B00AOA9BL0,15,10,With out headphones it is quite hard to hear.That's the only bad thing.
B00AOA9BL0,15,11,Even when set to the highest level you can barely hear the sound.
B00AOA9BL0,15,12,Overrides my kindle' s volume controls.
B00AOA9BL0,15,13,Try to make it work, no dice.
B00AOA9BL0,15,14,Also, there are no volume controls on the player and with the volume turned all the way up on the Kindle you can still barely hear anything.
B00AOA9BL0,15,15,volume too low and needs quick rewind button.
B00AOA9BL0,15,16,Volume is toolow even on highest setting.
B00AOA9BL0,15,17,sound is a pain.
B00AOA9BL0,15,18,There are no volume controls on the player, and I make the use of headphones, with the volume turned all the way up, on the Kindle Fire.
B00AOA9BL0,15,19,The sound being extremely low has been my only complaint until recently.
B00AOA9BL0,15,20,Good picture, bad sound, no choices.
B00AOA9BL0,15,21,It's not so bad that the audio & video are out of sync, but almost.
B00AOA9BL0,15,22,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,15,23,Would be great if it worked.
B00AOA9BL0,15,24,Picture is great  but I cannot hear the audio  very dissappointed .
B00AOA9BL0,16,0,Who do I call ?
B00AOA9BL0,16,1,I think that's what they called it?
B00AOA9BL0,16,2,I even have emailed about this and was told to call and get help that way.
B00AOA9BL0,16,3,Terrible customer service
B00AOA9BL0,16,4,never worked.
B00AOA9BL0,16,5,Worked great for about a week.
B00AOA9BL0,16,6,Horrible horrible customer service and company.
B00AOA9BL0,16,7,how come it doesn't work on.the
B00AOA9BL0,16,8,Installed three weeks ago, repair men have come to "fix" the problems only to have something else pop up or the repair that was made didn't quite fix it.
B00AOA9BL0,16,9,Help!!
B00AOA9BL0,16,10,Why can't they just email me back and help me out that way?
B00AOA9BL0,16,11,If anyone can help me figure out the problem please let me know.
B00AOA9BL0,16,12,It didn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,16,13,There's nowhere on Amazon to go to get help.
B00AOA9BL0,16,14,horrible level service.

B00AOA9BL0,16,19,I had the best Guy, Michael, come out to address a number of problems I was experiencing and he set this up for me.
B00AOA9BL0,16,20,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,16,21,Trying to figure out the issue, but haven't been able to resolve it yet.
B00AOA9BL0,16,22,Didn't work, never worked, was only suitable as a 30 minute distraction while I fooled around with and and attempted to speak to some tech guys.
B00AOA9BL0,16,23,I am doing something wrong and you know how to correct it, Please contact me.
B00AOA9BL0,16,24,Keep loosing the supposed "perks" of this package which involves phone calls to trouble shoot what is going on.

B00AOA9BL0,19,0,Otherwise, the app is okay.
B00AOA9BL0,19,1,What has happened to this app?
B00AOA9BL0,19,2,This app will not work on my reg.
B00AOA9BL0,19,3,NOT A GO APP.
B00AOA9BL0,19,4,This app doesn't work at all!
B00AOA9BL0,19,5,I like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,19,6,Which app does work for my Kindle Fire?
B00AOA9BL0,19,7,why is the app available for kindle fire when it doesn't work?
B00AOA9BL0,19,8,app doesn't work for kindle fire.
B00AOA9BL0,19,9,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,19,10,could not make it work.
B00AOA9BL0,19,11,This app does not work with my Kindle Fire.
B00AOA9BL0,19,12,It stops working.
B00AOA9BL0,19,13,it actualy works.
B00AOA9BL0,19,14,Won't work.
B00AOA9BL0,19,15,Works Okay.
B00AOA9BL0,19,16,would not work.
B00AOA9BL0,19,17,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,19,18,did not work.
B00AOA9BL0,19,19,needs work.
B00AOA9BL0,19,20,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,19,21,Okay--when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,19,22,If only it worked...
B00AOA9BL0,19,23,I downloaded this app, but it only works w/iTunes app.
B00AOA9BL0,19,24,Does not work at all.
B00AOA9BL0,20,0,No HDMI out...boo!
B00AOA9BL0,20,1,Does not allow HDMI output.
B00AOA9BL0,20,2,Goes to 5 stars with the HDMI out working.
B00AOA9BL0,20,3,Are all channels not available?
B00AOA9BL0,20,4,Huh? I thought that this is cable TV to go.
B00AOA9BL0,20,5,Netflix has HDMI out.
B00AOA9BL0,20,6,Help, I just bought a new hdtv to connect to my fire hd via hdmi cable, and no shows will play whether connected to the tv or not.
B00AOA9BL0,20,7,I don't know if it is my Comcast connection of the devise.
B00AOA9BL0,20,8,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,20,9,Must have Comcast as a cable or high speed internet connection.
B00AOA9BL0,20,10,works well even with a less than ideal network connection.
B00AOA9BL0,20,11,Have others had this problem??
B00AOA9BL0,20,12,The other main drawback is that it won't allow you to connect the video stream to a TV by HDMI.
B00AOA9BL0,20,13,Also tried them at Starbucks, didn't really work there.
B00AOA9BL0,20,14,Also, when buffering it will tell you it's &#34;waiting for internet connection&#34; while firmly connected to XFinity's own wired source with no other connections to the device.
B00AOA9BL0,20,15,Can only see some of the channels.
B00AOA9BL0,20,16,The only source for many shows.
B00AOA9BL0,20,17,Thank you-=  comcast needs to add more channels.
B00AOA9BL0,20,18,I thought I would be able to see some of my science channels and couldn't, it was limited to only a few.
B00AOA9BL0,20,19,Won't change the channel.
B00AOA9BL0,20,20,I can view shows/movies not available from other sources.
B00AOA9BL0,20,21,What gives Comcast?
B00AOA9BL0,20,22,3 stars for neutral rating as you must have Comcast as a cable or high speed internet connection
B00AOA9BL0,20,23,you can not use your hmdi cable you can only watch it on your device.
B00AOA9BL0,20,24,A mini extension of home cable.
B00AOA9BL0,21,0,Cannot use app.
B00AOA9BL0,21,1,Great app for on the Go but not at home.
B00AOA9BL0,21,2,No where did you say or did I see that you need to be a Comcast customer to use this app.
B00AOA9BL0,21,3,When I first got this app, it was great.
B00AOA9BL0,21,4,Great App!
B00AOA9BL0,21,5,That Said...this is a great app.
B00AOA9BL0,21,6,who knows why either, as Amazon.
B00AOA9BL0,21,7,Great app.
B00AOA9BL0,21,8,The app might be great it might not be, I could not tell since I do not have a comcast user name.
B00AOA9BL0,21,9,I probably will only use this app to watch BBC America while I am away at college.
B00AOA9BL0,21,10,Probably a good app but I will never know.
B00AOA9BL0,21,11,not a free app.
B00AOA9BL0,21,12,This is very disappointing since the app itself seems to be good.
B00AOA9BL0,21,13,Not good amazon and comcast please fix
B00AOA9BL0,21,14,Please patch this app with a fix!
B00AOA9BL0,21,15,this app is borked.
B00AOA9BL0,21,16,This app was helpful back in the day when we had TV.
B00AOA9BL0,21,17,The app would be better if it had more options and better organization.
B00AOA9BL0,21,18,02/19/14Comcast has edded more content available though the app.
B00AOA9BL0,21,19,Comcast does not work and you cannot get anyone to help on phone or in home.
B00AOA9BL0,21,20,Comcast.
B00AOA9BL0,21,21,worked great at first.
B00AOA9BL0,21,22,great for xfinity customers.
B00AOA9BL0,21,23,Fix or I will get a different cable service all together.
B00AOA9BL0,21,24,He then checked and found this app.
B00AOA9BL0,22,0,There are no updates that would work.
B00AOA9BL0,22,1,It worked and then they did something so it will not let me connect to the internet through my router.
B00AOA9BL0,22,2,Does not work.
B00AOA9BL0,22,3,Never have this problem with Netflix app on the same device with the same Wi-Fi connection.
B00AOA9BL0,22,4,Even with a 105MB connection, the app was very slow.
B00AOA9BL0,22,5,The app is great when it works, I am connected online yet it tells me to connect.
B00AOA9BL0,22,6,I like to us this feature when I'm not by a TV and it works well.
B00AOA9BL0,22,7,hasn't worked and still trying.
B00AOA9BL0,22,8,I have no problem connecting other devices to my Wi-Fi.
B00AOA9BL0,22,9,It does what I need it to do and it works.
B00AOA9BL0,22,10,Great when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,22,11,It works fine for meThank you
B00AOA9BL0,22,12,Player has a hard time connecting and streaming.
B00AOA9BL0,22,13,I don't have this trouble with Netflix or other video streaming, so I know it's not my wireless connection.
B00AOA9BL0,22,14,My connection speeds are just fine and Netflix works like a charm.
B00AOA9BL0,22,15,I wish they'd get a ROKU app too, so I can use it on a Roku projector.The app has worked very well for me with no problems at all.
B00AOA9BL0,22,16,Then it said it needed an update.
B00AOA9BL0,22,17,Great app for on the Go but not at home.
B00AOA9BL0,22,18,NOT A GO APP.
B00AOA9BL0,22,19,IT'S NOT MY SYSTEM AS IT WORKS GREAT STREAMING ON THE INTERNET, OTHERWISE.
B00AOA9BL0,22,20,Great app.
B00AOA9BL0,22,21,Maybe my internet connection isn't fast enough.
B00AOA9BL0,22,22,Just like the app on my phone, it lets me stream what I want.
B00AOA9BL0,22,23,I always have a decent wireless connection so never have issues.
B00AOA9BL0,22,24,the app downloaded fine.
B00AOA9BL0,23,0,It seems to be working now.
B00AOA9BL0,23,1,good, but long way from great.
B00AOA9BL0,23,2,volume too low and needs quick rewind button.
B00AOA9BL0,23,3,Can't get this to work on ASUS MEMO pad HD7.
B00AOA9BL0,23,4,App is nice to have on my KindleFire HD...all I can say is a volume control would be nice.Installed and worked as advertised . .
B00AOA9BL0,23,5,On the minus side, there must be a better a way to sort through shows especially alphabetically.
B00AOA9BL0,23,6,Great app must have on my devices.
B00AOA9BL0,23,7,Needs easier playback controls such as a 10 second rewind button.
B00AOA9BL0,23,8,Great companion with the TV remote app.
B00AOA9BL0,23,9,A good distraction from the pain of  existing.
B00AOA9BL0,23,10,Has anyone successfully installed this on the MEMO Pad HD7?
B00AOA9BL0,23,11,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,23,12,Seems to function pretty well, just not exactly what I was hoping for.
B00AOA9BL0,23,13,Check the settings panel; both volume and brightness control can be exposed.
B00AOA9BL0,23,14,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,23,15,I had the best Guy, Michael, come out to address a number of problems I was experiencing and he set this up for me.
B00AOA9BL0,23,16,The live TV feature is very useful, but a bit hard to control.
B00AOA9BL0,23,17,Great App!
B00AOA9BL0,23,18,I have to keep my finger on the screen and use my other hand to immediately tap the nav button I want when I lift my &#34;first&#34; hand.The steady and high quality video makes up for it, mostly!
B00AOA9BL0,23,19,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,23,20,To be honest, the real reason I'm not too happy is the fact that I couldn't change the quality of the video.
B00AOA9BL0,23,21,various channels have different volume settings and is difficult toadjust sound properly.
B00AOA9BL0,23,22,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,23,23,This app is very easy to use and works great.
B00AOA9BL0,23,24,Wrong Channel.
B00AOA9BL0,24,0,Good. no problems yet.
B00AOA9BL0,24,1,Hope will get better.
B00AOA9BL0,24,2,Good value, especially if you like binge-watching tv shows.
B00AOA9BL0,24,3,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,24,4,Needs work for better performance.
B00AOA9BL0,24,5,After checking with some other users, this appears to be a common problem.
B00AOA9BL0,24,6,I've used this for a couple of hours now and without any real problems.
B00AOA9BL0,24,7,Will change review when I do
B00AOA9BL0,24,8,Is it me or has anyone else had this problem.
B00AOA9BL0,24,9,I will continue to use but hope t gets better.
B00AOA9BL0,24,10,I tried a couple of times.
B00AOA9BL0,24,11,Like others say...we do pay pretty good money for our internet and cable services, think you guys can offer something a lot better by fixing the problems.
B00AOA9BL0,24,12,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,24,13,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,24,14,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,24,15,failed to.
B00AOA9BL0,24,16,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,24,17,Installed three weeks ago, repair men have come to "fix" the problems only to have something else pop up or the repair that was made didn't quite fix it.
B00AOA9BL0,24,18,Also tried them at Starbucks, didn't really work there.
B00AOA9BL0,24,19,The problem went away, but I never got even a reply when I contacted customer support through the correct channels.
B00AOA9BL0,24,20,Hope they work out the issues because it could be a very good application.
B00AOA9BL0,24,21,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,24,22,There are fewer newer showS however there are  more more older series.
B00AOA9BL0,24,23,Hopefully I will be able to find the time to decipher what all it does.
B00AOA9BL0,24,24,Thankfully, after almost a year they FINALLY fixed that problem!More.recently,
B00AOA9BL0,25,0,Only works part time.
B00AOA9BL0,25,1,First show there were a few times it stopped and then started.
B00AOA9BL0,25,2,You need to go to settings menu and monkey around and then it will work.
B00AOA9BL0,25,3,Really wanted this to work- tried to watch Hollywood Game Night.
B00AOA9BL0,25,4,This has never worked in the 5 months I have it.
B00AOA9BL0,25,5,Had It 5 Months- Never Worked.
B00AOA9BL0,25,6,You can watch tv and movies which isn't at all what I wanted.
B00AOA9BL0,25,7,Works Fine.
B00AOA9BL0,25,8,I watched a couple of shows with no problems.
B00AOA9BL0,25,9,When watching shows it won't play at full volume even if its set with the volume all the way up.
B00AOA9BL0,25,10,The kicker is that once it starts this, it keeps doing it until you power off the device, wait 10 seconds or so, and then power it back on.
B00AOA9BL0,25,11,not working.
B00AOA9BL0,25,12,Won't change the channel.
B00AOA9BL0,25,13,I tried a couple of times.
B00AOA9BL0,25,14,Sometimes it continues playing sound but has a blank screen.
B00AOA9BL0,25,15,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,25,16,Gotta get these problems fixed or no one will want it!!
B00AOA9BL0,25,17,The screen freezes and the program quits playing or the sound advances and the screen is still frozen.
B00AOA9BL0,25,18,I just watched half of an hour long show, and got to see the same ad about 30 times.
B00AOA9BL0,25,19,Out of the 20+ times I've tried this, maybe 3 or 4 times I was actually able to watch something.
B00AOA9BL0,25,20,EVERY time I try to watch a program after 3 or 4 minutes it goes into video buffering and NEVER recovers.
B00AOA9BL0,25,21,I love watching TV while I am using the treadmill but we have no TV in the exercise room.
B00AOA9BL0,25,22,Once the audio kept going but the picture froze (Bones) and the second  time (Castle) it  froze completely.
B00AOA9BL0,25,23,Errors each time trying to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,25,24,It plays fine and then randomly freezes.
