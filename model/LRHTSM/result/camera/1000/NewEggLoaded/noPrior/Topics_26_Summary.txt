Not exactly portable/pocket with the kit lens attached--you may have to get the 16mm pancake lens.	-4.377
It's a very solid camera with very good picture quality and the kit lens is quite nice as well.	-4.524
A 14mm lens would equal 28mm on a full frame.	-4.667

I did not hear any "clicking" on the videos with this particular unit.The specs say the battery should last for 400+ shots.	-5.542
Before I venture out, the pack is fully charged and after a 45 minute school function I will be left with about 78 percent.	-5.582
So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?	-5.586

The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.	-4.536
I can set the aperture to the minimum with Auto ISO but then the camera will favor something like 1/60s.)	-4.649
I've had this camera for a few days now, and have taken probably 45 photos.	-4.893

The on screen functions take getting used to if you are already accustomed to a DSLR with analog wheels and buttons.	-5.347
Initially, I was impressed with the thought of a touch screen camera because I am a Smartphone user and have grown to love touch screens, but after testing I really prefer not to use it on this camera.	-5.372

This needs to be corrected!!! Also, Sony's new thing with their cameras is that they will ONLY take a Sony battery.	-4.750
So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?	-5.063

I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2.	-4.311
You can customize 3 of the buttons on the back of the camera, and that helps tremendously, but there are still several things I wish were more readily available without fumbling through the menu.There is no viewfinder so you must frame your photos using the LCD screen, which can be difficult in bright light.	-4.994
I have been able to take low light shots, indoor, sunny outdoor, nighttime etc. without any issues.	-5.039

No more guessing and losing the perfect shot (happened so many times!) because 1/4 remaining battery equates to 2 percent!This is the first time that the auto modes actually work for me.	-5.332

If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.	-5.205
Hopefully I'll get myself to send the camera to Sony and get it fixed.3.	-5.288

great camera, but it has one problem that is fatal, the flash design is flawed.	-4.960
Performance is great, colors, low light, ISO, WB, dynamic range and picture quality are all solid.	-5.250
Apparently the fix involves placing grease or something on the part to dampen the noise ?	-5.253

I did not have time to confirm this.FIRST USEOnce the battery was fully charged, I reinstalled it into the camera and attached the 50mm E-Mount lens (SEL50F18).	-4.404
I wish the lens cap had a leash.	-4.670
camera shipped with kit lens attached to the body, so NO rear lens cap and NO body cap are supplied.	-4.832

Sony 2-, Amazon 5+ I have mixed thoughts about this camera.	-3.929
My 30 day return period would have expired by the time I returned to the USA, but I chatted online with Amazon support and they arranged for an extension of the return period until I got home.	-4.079

They both involve the screen flickering about 1/2 second after you turn the camera off under different circumstances.	-4.966
Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.	-5.247
This is the camera I've been looking for for a long time.My camera does not suffer from the "clicking sound" some have trouble with during video shooting.Due to its very small size, there isn't room for a lot of buttons and dials, so most of the camera's settings have to be reached via a rather cumbersome on screen menu.	-5.336

At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.	-4.979
you'll get about 20 minutes of video before it shuts down.	-5.116
You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.	-5.224
