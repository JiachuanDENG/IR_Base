B00COYOAYW,1,0,As for the apps I don't use that many apps.
B00COYOAYW,1,1,no windows phone!
B00COYOAYW,1,2,Ya I can't get all the farting apps that android has.
B00COYOAYW,1,3,Can't use Google or IPhone Apps but Windows 8 have their own apps to make up for it.
B00COYOAYW,1,4,Doesn't have all of the same apps available as I had with the Android.
B00COYOAYW,1,5,More apps!
B00COYOAYW,1,6,I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.
B00COYOAYW,1,7,Windows 8 phones are terrific.
B00COYOAYW,1,8,If APPS are important to you, do not get this phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,9,Windows Phone!
B00COYOAYW,1,10,Are there less app's for Windows Phone?
B00COYOAYW,1,11,Slowly getting used to the Windows phone being very different from the Androids that I've always used.
B00COYOAYW,1,12,Android has over 800 thousand apps and games while Windows 8 only about 185 thousand.
B00COYOAYW,1,13,I was skeptical about getting a windows phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,14,Windows 8.
B00COYOAYW,1,15,Not so with most android phones.
B00COYOAYW,1,16,If you're an app addict, this may not be the phone for you - just yet.
B00COYOAYW,1,17,Having had only Android phones before, I didn't know if I'd like a Windows phone, but I do.
B00COYOAYW,1,18,It's a Windows Phone, not an iPhone, not an Android.
B00COYOAYW,1,19,Great Phone if you want to get the Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,20,I think windows phone is a better phone  than android phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,21,windows phone - not great.
B00COYOAYW,1,22,Great window phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,23,Great Window Phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,24,They made the OS into an app.

B00COYOAYW,2,1,killer price.
B00COYOAYW,2,2,Great Phone at an unbelievable price.
B00COYOAYW,2,3,Good Phone and Great price.

B00COYOAYW,2,22,Great Phone for Price.
B00COYOAYW,2,23,Great phone for the price.
B00COYOAYW,2,24,Over all it seems like a good phone at a good price.
B00COYOAYW,3,0,Very Poor Battery Life.
B00COYOAYW,3,1,does have very good battery life
B00COYOAYW,3,2,Battery life.
B00COYOAYW,3,3,Battery lasts all day.
B00COYOAYW,3,4,The battery lasts about two days with this use.
B00COYOAYW,3,5,And its battery is good.
B00COYOAYW,3,6,Battery life is great.
B00COYOAYW,3,7,The battery life is really good.
B00COYOAYW,3,8,The phone itself is good and battery life is ok.
B00COYOAYW,3,9,Very good battery life too.
B00COYOAYW,3,10,Battery life to a certain extent is good.
B00COYOAYW,3,11,The battery is just over 1/2 charged now.-
B00COYOAYW,3,12,Battery life is great.
B00COYOAYW,3,13,Seems to have better battery life (2x charge a week vs 1.5x a day).
B00COYOAYW,3,14,I charge it every other day.
B00COYOAYW,3,15,battery life great - approx day and a half without using battery saver.
B00COYOAYW,3,16,Battery life was a godsend as she can use it all day without it dying by 3-4pm.
B00COYOAYW,3,17,Drains the battery within 4 hours.
B00COYOAYW,3,18,Looks like a defective battery or the phone just doesn't really last more than 5 hours.
B00COYOAYW,3,19,You can charge it every day or 1-1/2 days but no more than that.b)
B00COYOAYW,3,20,battery wont charge sometimes so i have to jiggle it until its in the right position.
B00COYOAYW,3,21,It has really long battery life so you don't have to charge every few hours and recharges quickly too so that is good.
B00COYOAYW,3,22,I keep my phone on "Battery Saver", and I can go 24+ hours and still have about 30% battery life by the end of that cycle.
B00COYOAYW,3,23,Good phone but.
B00COYOAYW,3,24,I have had it for 3 days and its  a great phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,0,Good quality phone!

B00COYOAYW,4,2,The call quality is so great.
B00COYOAYW,4,3,no quality.
B00COYOAYW,4,4,Good sound.
B00COYOAYW,4,5,Good.
B00COYOAYW,4,6,If you're in a good reception zone, good call quality.3)
B00COYOAYW,4,7,- but not flimsy-Speaker is okay, sounds surprisingly good for a phone-Screen is sharp-Windows 8 is really good (shocking) so far-Camera is okay, but sluggish
B00COYOAYW,4,8,Good quality.
B00COYOAYW,4,9,everything on it works good.
B00COYOAYW,4,10,quality is better than old one.all in all good phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,11,The sound and the videos from you tube are loud and clear so if they fix that adobe it will make it a great phone but no adobe not so great.
B00COYOAYW,4,12,Very good phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,13,The phone works really good.
B00COYOAYW,4,14,great phone.

B00COYOAYW,4,24,good.
B00COYOAYW,5,0,Great Camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,1,Very good camera too.
B00COYOAYW,5,2,The camera doesn't seem terrific, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.
B00COYOAYW,5,3,If you want a professional camera on a phone, this isn't for you.
B00COYOAYW,5,4,The camera is decent (as phone cameras go), There is no flash though.
B00COYOAYW,5,5,But the camera is very good, but no flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,6,Camera not too great and im use to a front facing camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,7,I only wish it had a better camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,8,good phonr.
B00COYOAYW,5,9,Has a great look, and camera results are awesome.
B00COYOAYW,5,10,Although I wish it had flash for the camera, however the phone works great.
B00COYOAYW,5,11,Great phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,12,I wish it had a front facing camera!
B00COYOAYW,5,13,It's a good phone with great features.
B00COYOAYW,5,14,Attention: no flash, no front camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,15,The camera doesn't even have a flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,16,great apps & camera & screen.
B00COYOAYW,5,17,Would like a better camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,18,There is also no flash on the camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,19,As for the good, the camera is ....ok.
B00COYOAYW,5,20,No camera flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,21,The phone does not have a flash, but even if you take pictures in low light the camera will lighten the photo to make a great picture.
B00COYOAYW,5,22,One more thing, even without the flash on the camera, it takes VERY good photos.
B00COYOAYW,5,23,Lastly the camera works very well even though the phone does not have flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,24,Great phone, great price.
B00COYOAYW,6,0,SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,6,1,Sim Card is used.
B00COYOAYW,6,2,Nice phone but when I couldn't get the SIM cards to activate with MetroPCS, I took the phones to them.They tried with their SIM cards and couldn't get the phone going.
B00COYOAYW,6,3,Phone didn't work with MetroPCS.
B00COYOAYW,6,4,So, don't through away the sim that comes with the lumia 521; you might need it if your old phone doesn't have a micro sim card.
B00COYOAYW,6,5,It came with a sim card, but I took my old T-Mobile sim card, and cut it to fit.
B00COYOAYW,6,6,very good phone for the money its t-mobile but i used 2 different pre-paid sim cards in it just to see if it would worked and it did.
B00COYOAYW,6,7,So far, this phone has worked very well for me.
B00COYOAYW,6,8,Could not use my current SIM card in the device because it takes a mini sim and I have a regular size sim card
B00COYOAYW,6,9,i would have kept it if my sim card was compatible...
B00COYOAYW,6,10,Otherwise, you would need to activate the new SIM card which comes with the phone and that renders the old SIM card worthless.Contacts Import:Another fail.
B00COYOAYW,6,11,Still working perfectly.
B00COYOAYW,6,12,Bought it for college and work.
B00COYOAYW,6,13,The phone we kept works good.
B00COYOAYW,6,14,Sim Card Sucks.
B00COYOAYW,6,15,We ahd to purchase another sim card from T Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,6,16,I went to the T-Mobile store to try it and it did not work, but works well with the 925.
B00COYOAYW,6,17,Phone seems good but I called T-Mobile costumer service to activate it and they said the sim card was used.
B00COYOAYW,6,18,I went to Tmobile and they activated the new SIM card and transferred all data from the old SIM card and turned on my new phone.
B00COYOAYW,6,19,The sim card that came with this new phone could not load my old account onto it when I got the new phone.
B00COYOAYW,6,20,Works great, but if you have a Contract already make sure you call your provider.
B00COYOAYW,6,21,FYI it uses a micro sim.
B00COYOAYW,6,22,Enterprise apps that work.
B00COYOAYW,6,23,Good phone.
B00COYOAYW,6,24,It won't import from the sd card.
B00COYOAYW,7,0,Works great as a work phone.
B00COYOAYW,7,1,It has been working great!
B00COYOAYW,7,2,time will tell no more to say
B00COYOAYW,7,3,It was here on time.
B00COYOAYW,7,4,Many functions on the phone do not work.
B00COYOAYW,7,5,on time.
B00COYOAYW,7,6,Nor is it a Samsung.
B00COYOAYW,7,7,I received this phone on time in great condition and loved it.
B00COYOAYW,7,8,And it works really well at that.
B00COYOAYW,7,9,It works!
B00COYOAYW,7,10,Great.
B00COYOAYW,7,11,I like it more than my Samsung Galaxy.
B00COYOAYW,7,12,The  phone i purchased works great.I am  very happy with poduct.
B00COYOAYW,7,13,Great Phone For a great price.
B00COYOAYW,7,14,great.
B00COYOAYW,7,15,Ordered it for a friend and she loves it works great and no problems works with my service provider and im in The Bahamas.
B00COYOAYW,7,16,good.
B00COYOAYW,7,17,great phone!
B00COYOAYW,7,18,i like it it is very good  thanks.
B00COYOAYW,7,19,great phone.
B00COYOAYW,7,20,Good so far.
B00COYOAYW,7,21,This is a great phone,price was great, it functions great, and no problems yet.
B00COYOAYW,7,22,Good phone.
B00COYOAYW,7,23,Great product.
B00COYOAYW,7,24,Great price for a great phone.
B00COYOAYW,8,0,I'll probably let the service expire, and then just reactivate it whenever I need to.
B00COYOAYW,8,1,T-mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,8,2,Let me state that I primarily use this phone with the Wi-Fi calling feature, as I do not have cell service at home.
B00COYOAYW,8,3,But I know it's coming!Great customer service Amazon!!
B00COYOAYW,8,4,Phone didn't work with MetroPCS.
B00COYOAYW,8,5,The phone is great.
B00COYOAYW,8,6,It only does it while I'm at work.
B00COYOAYW,8,7,The T-Mobile service is ok, but it's hard for me to comment because since I've gotten this phone I've mostly been on an island off the coast of NC and there is not good service here anyway.
B00COYOAYW,8,8,WiFi works great.
B00COYOAYW,8,9,T-mobile wifi calling.*
B00COYOAYW,8,10,The WiFi calling feature is fabulous: my house is in a poor reception area but WiFi calling fixes that.
B00COYOAYW,8,11,I just had to take it to T-mobile to get it activate.
B00COYOAYW,8,12,BTW, everyone used my phone when in Canada to call home to the US.
B00COYOAYW,8,13,This is the worst customer service I have ever had regrading a cell phone.
B00COYOAYW,8,14,This is a great way to have a home phone and cell service on demand.
B00COYOAYW,8,15,I'm keeping the phone but switching service to AT&T.;
B00COYOAYW,8,16,The 521 comes with wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,8,17,this is a great phone and work great.
B00COYOAYW,8,18,As t mobile has poor coverage at our home, wifi calling was crucial for this phone to work.
B00COYOAYW,8,19,Only T-Mobile has this service, and not all TMo phones can do it.
B00COYOAYW,8,20,WiFi works great.
B00COYOAYW,8,21,Best wifi calling I ever had.
B00COYOAYW,8,22,Wifi calling works great, particularly since T-mobile doesn't have great coverage everywhere (like inside my house).
B00COYOAYW,8,23,Great Phone!
B00COYOAYW,8,24,It took some talking to customer service to get it working correctly, but once they got it fixed, it worked well for about a month or two.
B00COYOAYW,9,0,It also has a fast processor.
B00COYOAYW,9,1,great phone.
B00COYOAYW,9,2,Great phone, great price.
B00COYOAYW,9,3,Works great as a work phone.
B00COYOAYW,9,4,Great Value.
B00COYOAYW,9,5,Fast.
B00COYOAYW,9,6,Great price for a great phone.
B00COYOAYW,9,7,great!!! Great value with 4g speed and windows ops.
B00COYOAYW,9,8,Everything else is there and works great.
B00COYOAYW,9,9,shipped fast, great price, and an amazing phone.
B00COYOAYW,9,10,Phone is fast with 1 Ghz processor and 512 ram.
B00COYOAYW,9,11,fast, fast – There is no lag on this phone.
B00COYOAYW,9,12,but its a good device
B00COYOAYW,9,13,It got here fast and I think this is a great value for the money.
B00COYOAYW,9,14,This is a great phone for the price.
B00COYOAYW,9,15,Great phone for the price.
B00COYOAYW,9,16,Very fast shipment.
B00COYOAYW,9,17,GREAT value for a phone as smooth as an iPhone.
B00COYOAYW,9,18,This is a really great phone for the price.
B00COYOAYW,9,19,The phone itself works great:  very smooth and responsive.
B00COYOAYW,9,20,Nice device, good price.
B00COYOAYW,9,21,Awesome Phone and Great Price!
B00COYOAYW,9,22,the price, the software, hardware everything.
B00COYOAYW,9,23,Great value, great features, needs better software robustness.
B00COYOAYW,9,24,Very simple and very fast.
B00COYOAYW,10,0,love it.
B00COYOAYW,10,1,I Love This Phone.

B00COYOAYW,10,22,Love It.
B00COYOAYW,10,23,We both love this phone.
B00COYOAYW,10,24,I love it!
B00COYOAYW,11,0,Good so far.
B00COYOAYW,11,1,Plus it does not let you change the background color.
B00COYOAYW,11,2,Read the other reviews, it is a really good phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,3,I gave the wrong review on the illumishield plastic covers.
B00COYOAYW,11,4,I wish they'd put that bing button on the left tho.
B00COYOAYW,11,5,Not good.
B00COYOAYW,11,6,however, my GF seems to think this an old phone just b/c of the design, but its not.
B00COYOAYW,11,7,Read the other reviews for the details.
B00COYOAYW,11,8,LOVE this phone!
B00COYOAYW,11,9,Nokia really could have place the power button at a different place or at least change the side design.
B00COYOAYW,11,10,Love all the features and the large variety of ring tones and setting options.
B00COYOAYW,11,11,You can only choose two background colors: black or grey.
B00COYOAYW,11,12,Only black.
B00COYOAYW,11,13,Lots of color.
B00COYOAYW,11,14,love it.
B00COYOAYW,11,15,The new windows design is excellent and loves it but I wouldn't recommend it for apple users.
B00COYOAYW,11,16,Some function is not very good, and the bottom is not very connect to the phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,17,Also, I chosen Bing background (beautiful landscapes that update every day or two) for the lock-screen and like it a lot.
B00COYOAYW,11,18,I love it!
B00COYOAYW,11,19,I will update this review later on if he learn the phone already and ask him of what he thinks of the phone.I definitely recommend this for everyone.I will update this review later on, after all I've only been using the phone for a week.
B00COYOAYW,11,20,One petty complaint: wish there were more colors than just white.
B00COYOAYW,11,21,Always powers off!! The phone came on time & was packaged nice and that's the only reason for the 2 stars but the phone powers off by itself a lot.
B00COYOAYW,11,22,Also, I chosen Bing background (beautiful landscapes that update every day or two) for the lock-screen and like it a lot.
B00COYOAYW,11,23,Overall good and easy phone to work with.
B00COYOAYW,11,24,If you're a phone power user, I couldn't suggest this.
B00COYOAYW,12,0,Value for money.
B00COYOAYW,12,1,The phone is just used to call and text.
B00COYOAYW,12,2,good for calling and texting.
B00COYOAYW,12,3,Value for money.
B00COYOAYW,12,4,For the money, this is more than a good phone.
B00COYOAYW,12,5,They need a phone for calls, texts, and checking their email.
B00COYOAYW,12,6,Good phone if you just talk and text.
B00COYOAYW,12,7,buy it, if you really need a phone(to call or text someone), not recommended for DATA users.
B00COYOAYW,12,8,So, wherever there is no wifi, I can only talk and text.
B00COYOAYW,12,9,and sometimes irritating.I sent a copious quantity of texts.
B00COYOAYW,12,10,Worth the Money.
B00COYOAYW,12,11,Great phone, does just what it says,I have never had a phone with internet before.
B00COYOAYW,12,12,I can surf the internet and check email.
B00COYOAYW,12,13,As far as the phone goes, again for the money, this phone is great.
B00COYOAYW,12,14,You can say "text Joanna", and then dictate your message and send it.
B00COYOAYW,12,15,However, the internet is excellent, and the texting autocomplete is among the best I've encountered.
B00COYOAYW,12,16,I can make calls and send texts, which are the basic requirement of a phone.
B00COYOAYW,12,17,Oh yeah, it also makes good phone calls and texts.
B00COYOAYW,12,18,For calling and texting is very cheap.
B00COYOAYW,12,19,I don't make many cell calls, and this plan doesn't allow data.
B00COYOAYW,12,20,Seemed to work okay as long as you have added extra money to the account for the 10 cent calls and 20 cent texts.
B00COYOAYW,12,21,If all you need in a phone is talk and text, this phone is perfect for you.
B00COYOAYW,12,22,The features are great.
B00COYOAYW,12,23,Prepaid plan, no data, with wifi.
B00COYOAYW,12,24,If you need a phone just for texting, make phone calls, and the internet browsing, this will be a good inexpensive phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,0,Phone case.
B00COYOAYW,13,1,The only problem i had was having to go from my usual big screen 4.7 screens to an actual 4.0 one.
B00COYOAYW,13,2,When I recently put a screen protector on I couldn't find any scratches on the screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,3,The Lumia is the first touch screen phone I have used.
B00COYOAYW,13,4,wrong screen protector.
B00COYOAYW,13,5,The screen is super sens, so much that you can hover your finger over the screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,6,There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time.
B00COYOAYW,13,7,Because the case didn't fit my phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,8,I bought screen protector and phone back cover as suggested by Amazaon.
B00COYOAYW,13,9,I have not tried a non-glare screen protector.2.
B00COYOAYW,13,10,When I just want to get to the home screen, it'll reboot.
B00COYOAYW,13,11,Phone is nice - did not come with screen protector or car charger.
B00COYOAYW,13,12,This phone is thinner with a bigger screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,13,Got to find a better case for it though.
B00COYOAYW,13,14,Nokia or the windowsphone store looking for these accessories such as the screen protectors and cases.
B00COYOAYW,13,15,Ability to have a high contrast screen (for those with poor eyesight or someone who wants a cool looking screen)7.
B00COYOAYW,13,16,Touch screen is same as iphone, very quick and responsive.-
B00COYOAYW,13,17,The phone was nice for a little while and even the case I bought with it was nice but less than the month the phone stop turning on.
B00COYOAYW,13,18,Nice case...fit correctly on my nokia lumina 521however the screen protector was for model nokia 520and did not fit my 521
B00COYOAYW,13,19,Wipe your screen more often, or put an anti-smudge screen protector and you're problems are solved.
B00COYOAYW,13,20,Phone is nice - did not come with screen protector or car charger as indicated.The images for the phone clearly show a screen protector and car charger.
B00COYOAYW,13,21,I had the phone for about a month before I bought a screen protector.
B00COYOAYW,13,22,Screen is not great but still very good.Cons-1.
B00COYOAYW,13,23,Once I got a good case for it the problems with it leaping from my pocket were fixed.
B00COYOAYW,13,24,I didn't have a case or screen protector yet so I was really worried about my new phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,0,There are no apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,1,Now know this, Android has over 895,000 apps, while Windows 8 has around 170,000 apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,2,I could refill my prescriptions with an app on my phone which I cannot do since there isn't an app for it on Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,3,yea youll miss some apps the i phone has but not many.
B00COYOAYW,14,4,apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,5,I don't use instagram but I saw they have a beta app.
B00COYOAYW,14,6,Ya I can't get all the farting apps that android has.
B00COYOAYW,14,7,It seems to have most of the apps I need available, and they work well.
B00COYOAYW,14,8,we do have instagram, vine and snapchat app in the store)
B00COYOAYW,14,9,Windows is.* Apps?
B00COYOAYW,14,10,Some of the ones I wish were there but haven't found: NPR, NBA, politico, official google apps (e.g.
B00COYOAYW,14,11,This is a WINDOWS phone not an Android Phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,12,But think about all the useless apps that people have polluted Google play with, the apps that aren't really apps, and the apps that aren't  free.
B00COYOAYW,14,13,The apps seems limited compared to apps you can get for iphone/droid.
B00COYOAYW,14,14,Most of the available apps works great.2
B00COYOAYW,14,15,Instagram?...etcIf you mean an "official" app made by the same people who make the app for iOS or Android - maybe yes, maybe no.
B00COYOAYW,14,16,Some key apps I would like to have are only on the iPhone and Android.-
B00COYOAYW,14,17,From Android to Windows.
B00COYOAYW,14,18,Nothing I can really do about that.The apple app store has by far the largest selection of apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,19,For now, quite a few of the iphone apps I used do not have a windows version yet.
B00COYOAYW,14,20,Because of this, I downloaded the MapQuest app which seems to work much better.
B00COYOAYW,14,21,Windows apps are different from those the Android market.
B00COYOAYW,14,22,There are few functional apps, so if you rely on google docs, you're in for some frustration.-voice
B00COYOAYW,14,23,You would need a window 8 machine if you are able to develop some apps for yourself.
B00COYOAYW,14,24,Get me back to Android please!
B00COYOAYW,15,0,Nokia Lumia 521 Phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,1,4 months later, I am still using this phone, and my motivation to purchase another has been dwindled to nothing by this phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,2,nokia lumia 521 is a great phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,3,Now I have to buy another phone... Again...
B00COYOAYW,15,4,Never buying a Nokia again.
B00COYOAYW,15,5,Great Phone for the Price.
B00COYOAYW,15,6,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,7,i dont recommend to anyone to buy stuf from them
B00COYOAYW,15,8,Great phone, great price!
B00COYOAYW,15,9,I will never buy another Nokia product again.
B00COYOAYW,15,10,Nokia lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,11,If you're buying it for yourself, and you're over 18, it might not be as involved.
B00COYOAYW,15,12,I bought this phone because I had previously liked other Nokia phones I had purchased.
B00COYOAYW,15,13,Nokia Lumia 521 for T-mobile.
B00COYOAYW,15,14,Great phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,15,NOKIA LUMIA 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,16,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,17,my nokia lumia 521.... tmobile.
B00COYOAYW,15,18,I just bought this phone 2 months ago.
B00COYOAYW,15,19,Exceptional Buy.
B00COYOAYW,15,20,Very pleased with this purchase.
B00COYOAYW,15,21,nokia lumia 521 review.
B00COYOAYW,15,22,The Nokia Lumia 521 T-Mobile smart phone is great.
B00COYOAYW,15,23,great phone great service.
B00COYOAYW,15,24,This review is on the Nokia Lumia 521 (T-Mobile) phone.
B00COYOAYW,16,0,now the phone wont turn on at all but it shows that the battery is charging.
B00COYOAYW,16,1,Battery Life.
B00COYOAYW,16,2,The charging ion would come up when I would charge but it just wouldn't power up.
B00COYOAYW,16,3,So it blinks (charging) all never charges.
B00COYOAYW,16,4,Problems with battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,5,Even when the phone did work the battery life was terrible.
B00COYOAYW,16,6,The battery would not hold a charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,7,I powered the phone off (it had about 80% battery charge).
B00COYOAYW,16,8,I charge my phone usually every other day.
B00COYOAYW,16,9,Now it will not even charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,10,It wasn't until a few days later that my phone started turning off on it's own even though the battery was fully charged.
B00COYOAYW,16,11,I tried everything, if i plug it in (tried for about 17hr charge) it will not keep the charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,12,I was a little concerned with battery life, but it goes days between charges, which is partially a reflection on how little I use the phone each day.
B00COYOAYW,16,13,I would have to charge it multiple times a day.
B00COYOAYW,16,14,Phone keeps shutting off, even after battery is fully charged.
B00COYOAYW,16,15,The battery life.
B00COYOAYW,16,16,The Lumia uses a Li Ion battery, and not a NiCad battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,17,One day it will go dead in a few hrs and the next time will last 3 days and I don't use it that much.
B00COYOAYW,16,18,stop working within a month.
B00COYOAYW,16,19,Over the last 4 days, this phone has been restarting itself several times (usually 3 to 7 times) a day.
B00COYOAYW,16,20,When I plug it in, it says its charging so I've been charging it for a couple of hours but the phone still won't turn on.
B00COYOAYW,16,21,But now it shuts off all the time and doesn't hold a charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,22,Battery life is terrible unless you have the battery saver on.
B00COYOAYW,16,23,Sometimes freezes up on me but a quick removal of the battery gets it to turn back on.
B00COYOAYW,16,24,The screen is working, it shows a battery charging, but it won't hold the charge and won't power up.
B00COYOAYW,17,0,i couldn't use my headphone to listen to music because the sound was really bad, so that I had to buy a new headphone.
B00COYOAYW,17,1,When on speaker it's not clear at all.
B00COYOAYW,17,2,Unfortunately, It has bad reception (unless it has to do with T-Mobile) and when on speaker there is a lot of interruption.
B00COYOAYW,17,3,Listen up people!!!
B00COYOAYW,17,4,Phone speaker defect.
B00COYOAYW,17,5,have had this phone since November and the audio or speakers are horrible.
B00COYOAYW,17,6,Always getting cut off....dropping calls.
B00COYOAYW,17,7,I need a phone with better mic and speaker since I use the speakerphone a lot.
B00COYOAYW,17,8,Too bad, now I have no use for this phone....!
B00COYOAYW,17,9,A piece of crap.
B00COYOAYW,17,10,Piece of junk no
B00COYOAYW,17,11,I haven't heard on any bad things with this phone.
B00COYOAYW,17,12,The most important feature for me is that I can hear people clearly without static or disturbance through the connection.
B00COYOAYW,17,13,I CANT BELIEVE SOME OF THE REVIEWS ON HERE, TALKING BAD ABOUT THE PHONE.
B00COYOAYW,17,14,Others sometimes have a hard time hearing me.
B00COYOAYW,17,15,I bought this phone couple of days back, Now the phone speaker not working properly and getting "kirch kreech" sound  while playing any audio/video.I would like to return this product now :(.
B00COYOAYW,17,16,Call quality isn't the greatest.
B00COYOAYW,17,17,I'ts been almost a month since I bought this phone and I don't know what since to be the problem but I having a lot of trouble for about two weeks now.
B00COYOAYW,17,18,Piece of junk.
B00COYOAYW,17,19,I did not play much with the audio, but the few times I played music i felt good.
B00COYOAYW,17,20,Okay Buy!
B00COYOAYW,17,21,headphone jack doesnt always cut out the speaker.
B00COYOAYW,17,22,Serves Its Purpose.
B00COYOAYW,17,23,They didn't fix the problem!
B00COYOAYW,17,24,problems i seem to have are.1.
B00COYOAYW,18,0,Overall ,good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,1,The camera is not that good.
B00COYOAYW,18,2,its a good phone when it comes to being a phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,3,They are very good.
B00COYOAYW,18,4,So far, so good.
B00COYOAYW,18,5,It Be Good.
B00COYOAYW,18,6,Camera is too bad.
B00COYOAYW,18,7,no camera flash
B00COYOAYW,18,8,good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,9,it's good!
B00COYOAYW,18,10,better than expected.
B00COYOAYW,18,11,this phone executes that really well. it doesn't have a front camera.
B00COYOAYW,18,12,very good quality phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,13,Good Phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,14,With this price, it is a very good quality phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,15,No better phone for the price.
B00COYOAYW,18,16,The camera is ok better than any of my other phones.
B00COYOAYW,18,17,The camera no good for taking photos where there is no light/when it's dark out.
B00COYOAYW,18,18,not for me, but there are some good thing about this phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,19,I wish it had a better camera with a flash, but for the price you cant beat this.
B00COYOAYW,18,20,Camera is good in light only, and the apps are pretty cool for the camera.
B00COYOAYW,18,21,No Good Nokia!
B00COYOAYW,18,22,I don't think a camera should be added if it had no flash.
B00COYOAYW,18,23,Good value for the price .
B00COYOAYW,18,24,This is a good basic smartphone with only one camera, rear-facing, and no flash.
B00COYOAYW,19,0,They both come with sim cards and you should be able to do it yourself.
B00COYOAYW,19,1,Comes with SIM card (fyi).
B00COYOAYW,19,2,No memory.
B00COYOAYW,19,3,You have to install the micro sim card unless you already have one.
B00COYOAYW,19,4,SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,19,5,SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,19,6,It's internal memory is enough for all the apps I use and more.
B00COYOAYW,19,7,Has an MicroSD card slot.9.
B00COYOAYW,19,8,It seems to want everything stored on internal storage (apps especially) which takes up most of the internal memory.4.
B00COYOAYW,19,9,I have a 32GB SD card in it with over 15GB free but I can't get the maps to go to the SD card, they are stuck in internal phone memory.
B00COYOAYW,19,10,When I check the phones memory, it says that most of the phone memory is taken up by "other"You can save photos, videos, and songs on the sd card.
B00COYOAYW,19,11,storage options – 8GB internal memory and an expandable micro SD card.
B00COYOAYW,19,12,There's 8GB internal memory as well as microSD slot expanded memory.
B00COYOAYW,19,13,Only has about 7GB storage so you need at least a 16 GB SD card for phone updates, photos, videos etc.
B00COYOAYW,19,14,Would be nice to be able to install apps on SD card.8.
B00COYOAYW,19,15,The back plate is removable to access the micro-SD card, sim card and battery.
B00COYOAYW,19,16,I don't even think I need this 8gb micro-sd card anymore.---Really
B00COYOAYW,19,17,Well how come it is not working?I put the SIM card in, turn it on and the Maps app is empty.
B00COYOAYW,19,18,I expected to be able to have massive storage on my micro-sd card, but the phone doesn't let you easily move/transfer/find/play music etc ... from the micro sd card.
B00COYOAYW,19,19,We had standard sim cards previously that are too big.
B00COYOAYW,19,20,If you have an old SIM card you can just stick it in and go.
B00COYOAYW,19,21,If you have music to upload using an SD card, I suggest you skip Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,22,Yes, similarly, you can't readily load the update to the SD card and run it from there.
B00COYOAYW,19,23,Tried a 32GB card, which worked.
B00COYOAYW,19,24,Phone, Camera, MP3 Player and can add plenty of free apps plus up to a 64MB Micro SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,20,0,How do i return it?
B00COYOAYW,20,1,Quit working, no return to Amazon.
B00COYOAYW,20,2,Received the phone on time and in working order.
B00COYOAYW,20,3,The phone stopped working less than 2 weeks after I received it.
B00COYOAYW,20,4,So I returned it.
B00COYOAYW,20,5,I tried to return it to Amazon but they said I had missed the return date and would not take it back, so much for Amazon's return policy.
B00COYOAYW,20,6,After I received and used it, this item works like a champ.
B00COYOAYW,20,7,Ordered two and neither of them worked.
B00COYOAYW,20,8,When asked to return or try and replace it I was told no and it was one day after the 30 day warranty this happened.
B00COYOAYW,20,9,I returned it and got my money back.
B00COYOAYW,20,10,Ended up returning the phone because of this.
B00COYOAYW,20,11,Well just received this phone,I was replacing a huawei?
B00COYOAYW,20,12,I returned the phone to Amazon and got a replacement.
B00COYOAYW,20,13,It took them a whole 6 days after I ordered to even ship the item.
B00COYOAYW,20,14,to purchase another phone since could not get this phone to work.
B00COYOAYW,20,15,There is no warranty for this item.
B00COYOAYW,20,16,stop working within a month.
B00COYOAYW,20,17,Works like a champ.
B00COYOAYW,20,18,Would've returned it if I still have box it came in.
B00COYOAYW,20,19,I got this as a replacement phone.
B00COYOAYW,20,20,Wish it worked!
B00COYOAYW,20,21,He would have to take his battery out and put it back in in order for it  to make calls.Overall very disappointing.
B00COYOAYW,20,22,I ordered 2 of these phones and so far the other phone is working just fine.
B00COYOAYW,20,23,Btw one came that would not charge and I returned it no problem to amazon and got a replacement phone even before I had shipped the broken one ...kudos amazon !
B00COYOAYW,20,24,I had to return it again.
B00COYOAYW,21,0,phone not unlocked.
B00COYOAYW,21,1,My goal was to get it unlocked for use on AT&T.;
B00COYOAYW,21,2,One quick call to T-mobile support and I was up and running.
B00COYOAYW,21,3,Then I called T-mobile customer support and they found that the settings was the problem.
B00COYOAYW,21,4,Nothing has worked.
B00COYOAYW,21,5,unlock code.
B00COYOAYW,21,6,Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.
B00COYOAYW,21,7,As much as I dislike the (apparently unfixable) problems with T-mobile's service, I hate T-mobile's attitude about it even more.
B00COYOAYW,21,8,We have German T-mobile and got sent between US and German T-mobile to figure out how to "unlock" etc.
B00COYOAYW,21,9,a only draw back is lock phone; it's very hard to unlock this phone if you did not purchase from T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,21,10,Once I got all these ducks in a row, the phone works like a charm!!
B00COYOAYW,21,11,to unlock the phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,12,It was not the phone, it was the service provider.
B00COYOAYW,21,13,T-mobile stores said it is the problem with the phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,14,I got the same problem in the replacement and T-mobile stores could not fix the problem.
B00COYOAYW,21,15,No service even though it showed service in my area online at T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,21,16,I went to the T-Mobile store to try it and it did not work, but works well with the 925.
B00COYOAYW,21,17,Bought two different sim cards through t mobile still didn't work.
B00COYOAYW,21,18,to purchase another phone since could not get this phone to work.
B00COYOAYW,21,19,I originally bought this phone on the T-Mobile network, I was able to get the phone unlocked and am now using it on the AT&T; network.
B00COYOAYW,21,20,I was hoping to unlock the phone without having to activate it through T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,21,21,Not sure if it's the device or T-Mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,21,22,Quit working, no return to Amazon.
B00COYOAYW,21,23,So, my advice at this point would be to buy the phone and immediately get an unlock code, once it's unlocked you can take it to AT&T;, or another provider which works with Nokia.
B00COYOAYW,21,24,You can unlock it using [...] it takes about 15 working days to get the code.
B00COYOAYW,22,0,Major upgrade from my HTC MyTouch 4G.
B00COYOAYW,22,1,The spoiler here is my other phone is 4G LTE.
B00COYOAYW,22,2,For those that need Good.com and Lync 2010, they work and work better than on Android.
B00COYOAYW,22,3,Its slow!
B00COYOAYW,22,4,I could've bought an obsolete version of an IOS or Android device for more money than this.
B00COYOAYW,22,5,There are two things that must be clarified if you just got this phone and you coming from Android or Iphone.
B00COYOAYW,22,6,I've had the last 3 generations of Galaxy S devices, tried many of the Verizon Droid line devices (X, Droid, Droid2).
B00COYOAYW,22,7,I have to say, WP8 makes IOS7 and Android look obsolete immediately.
B00COYOAYW,22,8,I still own the original Samsung Galaxy S. It has never given me any upsetting issues comparing with the new Window Nokia Lumia.
B00COYOAYW,22,9,I knew from experience with my work phone that a cheap Android phone meant an undersized processor, last-gen OS, and endless frustration.
B00COYOAYW,22,10,All in all a really terrible and disappointing experience.
B00COYOAYW,22,11,I've had the last 3 generations of Galaxy S devices, tried many of the Verizon Droid line devices (X, Droid, Droid2).
B00COYOAYW,22,12,With half the processor of the Android phone it was replacing, it still feels like a hardware upgrade.*
B00COYOAYW,22,13,This os is less than a year old.Update: not going back to Android anytime soon.
B00COYOAYW,22,14,I use wi-fi when possible and it stays at 4G...I wanted to get the new IPhone 5...
B00COYOAYW,22,15,the 4g speeds are faster than i expected for such a cheap phone .
B00COYOAYW,22,16,just like the windows 8 OS, there is VERY limited customization compared to other phone OS's such as Android or Apple.
B00COYOAYW,22,17,Window Phone has some annoying issues which Adroid phone does not experience.
B00COYOAYW,22,18,It doesnt lag at all and what a relief coming from Android;3.
B00COYOAYW,22,19,Tried using a battery from an ATT 520 and that does not work either.
B00COYOAYW,22,20,No budget 4g phones to buy and all arrows were pointing to this one.
B00COYOAYW,22,21,First of, this phones dual-core processor and 512mb of RAM wouldn't make it very far in the Android world, but here it's snappy and responsive, no lag experienced and apps run smoothly.
B00COYOAYW,22,22,That is an insane deal for a phone with a dual core processor, 4G connectivity and a micro SD slot.
B00COYOAYW,22,23,Even though this is a budget phone there really isn't any noticeable performance woes.
B00COYOAYW,22,24,I'd buy it again but I hope future upgrades will iron out a few things.
B00COYOAYW,23,0,For the non-technical type, like myself, the instructions were impossible to follow.
B00COYOAYW,23,1,new to this type of phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,2,the keyboard does not react sometimes
B00COYOAYW,23,3,I have nothing bad to say about the phone, it does every thing i need it to do.
B00COYOAYW,23,4,Easy to use phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,5,This phone was impossible to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,6,Impossible to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,7,Almost every word I type.
B00COYOAYW,23,8,The phone is pretty easy to set up.
B00COYOAYW,23,9,its real easy to use
B00COYOAYW,23,10,2 small things wrong..
B00COYOAYW,23,11,I don't like the way the phone calls are set up, I am use to missed, placed, dial, etc.
B00COYOAYW,23,12,hate to imaging a fat fingered person typing on this thing.
B00COYOAYW,23,13,Typing text messages is a breeze.
B00COYOAYW,23,14,Calling someone, real easy.Not a bad deal at all.
B00COYOAYW,23,15,I do need to use a stylus with the onscreen keyboard.
B00COYOAYW,23,16,This might be an isolated issue and my bad luck.
B00COYOAYW,23,17,No option to display text messages on the swipe screen.
B00COYOAYW,23,18,For me the number is that small.
B00COYOAYW,23,19,this phone is easy to use and that coming from a prior android phone user.
B00COYOAYW,23,20,Optional Voice-texting....don't need to use the tiny keyboard on screen if you don't want to.7.
B00COYOAYW,23,21,But I like the size for my first Android.
B00COYOAYW,23,22,Bad Luck????
B00COYOAYW,23,23,Some bad things about it though is you have to wait a little until it gets a signal which might get frustrating.
B00COYOAYW,23,24,You can only setup 1 custom screen, then the next screen is a full list of all your applications in alphabetical order, so you cant re-arrange them or create multiple screens like you can for android.
B00COYOAYW,24,0,After i press the power button, it shows "goodbye", then screen turn black.
B00COYOAYW,24,1,The power button is accidently pressed all the time.
B00COYOAYW,24,2,And a few times, the touch screen has become unresponsive.
B00COYOAYW,24,3,First, there're bubbles and lines under the screen film.
B00COYOAYW,24,4,I've tried with turning off the screen while on the call - the same issue.
B00COYOAYW,24,5,I hit the power button on the side, and I got the screen that said slide down to power off - hurray for physical buttons - but touching the screen still produced no results.
B00COYOAYW,24,6,Power button: It's on the side.
B00COYOAYW,24,7,I don't like the way the phone calls are set up, I am use to missed, placed, dial, etc.
B00COYOAYW,24,8,The problem is the buttons on the side of the phone are right there where I grab it, and I had accidently lowered the ring volume to zero.
B00COYOAYW,24,9,It has a tendency to change settings inexplicably.
B00COYOAYW,24,10,Only locked up once but was able to hold power/lock button down and restart it.
B00COYOAYW,24,11,The the screen would turn off even when  I am trying to call out and then the power/screen  button is intermitent working 3. the Speaker is really muffled and has a high tone level4.
B00COYOAYW,24,12,I like having the "back" button below the screen as it's always easy to find.
B00COYOAYW,24,13,Maybe the screen lock can be worked around.
B00COYOAYW,24,14,The delete call option is actually easier and quicker to use than the options menu and buttons on the X2.
B00COYOAYW,24,15,It did come in a timely manner.
B00COYOAYW,24,16,The external buttons, especially the camera button, are just right.
B00COYOAYW,24,17,If you miss the vibration or ring, then you don't know you got a text/call until the next time you turn the phone on.Sigh.
B00COYOAYW,24,18,Even the buttons come off with the cover!
B00COYOAYW,24,19,everything is OK, but sometime the screen turn off automatically.
B00COYOAYW,24,20,Just flicking the screen sometmes will take you to a fb page that you havent seen before!
B00COYOAYW,24,21,watch the buttons on the side.
B00COYOAYW,24,22,I find it easiest to do by releasing the side opposite the power button first.
B00COYOAYW,24,23,There is not much that would work, tried a soft reset, turning on/off etc it would not work.
B00COYOAYW,24,24,irritating thing about the call history is that it omits information.
B00COYOAYW,25,0,I use my phone, well, to make phone call and send text messages.
B00COYOAYW,25,1,It tries to send text and email messages ONCE and that's it.
B00COYOAYW,25,2,It will use Wi-Fi seamlessly to make phone calls - when my gf calls me over the Wi-Fi it still shows as her phone number calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,3,I wanted a phone for wi-fi calling and no data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,4,It ok if you don't like picture messages.
B00COYOAYW,25,5,I had set wi-fi calling as wi-fi only.
B00COYOAYW,25,6,unless wifi calling (wifi calling is free).
B00COYOAYW,25,7,It makes phone calls, allows me to send texts and so much more.
B00COYOAYW,25,8,The only problem that we have found is that it will not send picture texts (maybe because we are not paying for data, we only use the wifi).
B00COYOAYW,25,9,can't get on internet,can't access facebook,can't send pictures just not satified with it.
B00COYOAYW,25,10,Phone calls are clear and the phone also comes with Wi-Fi calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,11,However this phone did make wi-fi calls and allow internet access without a data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,12,* It does WiFi calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,13,T-mobile wifi calling.*
B00COYOAYW,25,14,I pay $50 a mo for unltd text, data, calls...
B00COYOAYW,25,15,The 521 comes with wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,16,Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.
B00COYOAYW,25,17,If you turn this on, you’ll be able to send and receive voice calls and text messages over any Wi-Fi network with enough bandwidth.
B00COYOAYW,25,18,Same with text (unless you use say the Facebook messaging app).
B00COYOAYW,25,19,T-Mobile informed me that this phone could be used without a data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,20,All my calls go through the my WiFi router and are crystal clear.
B00COYOAYW,25,21,My calls kept getting dropped, or they'd cut out and I couldn't send or receive texts.
B00COYOAYW,25,22,She texts, reads some emails, uses the navigation, takes some pictures and makes phone calls.
B00COYOAYW,25,23,So now my contacts all have pictures, birthdays, e-mails, and phone numbers from all those accounts.
B00COYOAYW,25,24,You can also use WiFi calling on the phone.
B004T36GCU,0,0,The screen response is good and the screen size is big enough to watch movies.
B004T36GCU,0,1,A very nice HTC phone with a beautiful screen that, unfortunately, didn't work for me.
B004T36GCU,0,2,Picture quality is also good.
B004T36GCU,0,3,Brightness of the screen is an issue in sunlight.
B004T36GCU,0,4,Small and easy to carry with one hand.
B004T36GCU,0,5,Love this phone as it has so many funcitons and features I can use.
B004T36GCU,0,6,OVERALL: I love the weight of the phone (not as light as some others which is good since I like to keep my phone for a few years).
B004T36GCU,0,7,Fairly big phone, good for playing games and watching videos.
B004T36GCU,0,8,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,0,9,Revised review - Nice phone.
B004T36GCU,0,10,I mean the phone size and key board is nice but the phone it's not worth buying for it to freeze up 5 months later.
B004T36GCU,0,11,The texting is incredibly glitchy as well; mis-types, and buttons not functioning the same way all the time make this phone a better paper weight.
B004T36GCU,0,12,Phone was never dropped, in a hard protective case from day 1, screen protector from day 1 and now less than 6 months later the phone itself will not charge the battery.
B004T36GCU,0,13,It has scratches on the screen and on the camera.
B004T36GCU,0,14,This phone, simply put, is not worth it's weight in plastic.
B004T36GCU,0,15,Great features and great phone.
B004T36GCU,0,16,Camera is awesome, and the size is great.
B004T36GCU,0,17,Sound in speaker very bad, internet hoop up, is good, screen was good also.
B004T36GCU,0,18,That cell phone was not working the display so i had to pay to fix that so it was not really good
B004T36GCU,0,19,Voice quality of this product is not at all good, I bought it with out reading the reviews.If you are looking for a good phone with all basic features, its better not to buy this one
B004T36GCU,0,20,Even with a 780p display, the colors are vivid with the S-LCD screen.*Conclusion*A
B004T36GCU,0,21,It lasts easily for a day despite my heavy game playing habit.
B004T36GCU,0,22,Didnt like the way screen felt ... Phone didnt last a day with out giving me problems.. Wasnt charging right and battery just didnt seem any good...
B004T36GCU,0,23,THE PHONE IS PHYSICALLY BEAUTIFUL.
B004T36GCU,0,24,I recommend a Micromax or a Xolo to this.
B004T36GCU,1,0,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,1,1,But, unbeknownst to me, some apps can cause blockers.
B004T36GCU,1,2,good.
B004T36GCU,1,3,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,1,4,The Google Play market is perfection, the speed of downloading apps is pretty remarkable, too.
B004T36GCU,1,5,It's also my first smart phone I've owned, and I'm pretty biased towards the Android market; I have no plans of ever owning an iPhone.
B004T36GCU,1,6,I can not download games that i would like to play, such as plants vs zombies 2 and it losses the signal very easy
B004T36GCU,1,7,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,1,8,The only thing work is the internet as the po ket tablet.
B004T36GCU,1,9,Not good for anything else.
B004T36GCU,1,10,This phone will not download google apps.
B004T36GCU,1,11,Does not download google apps!!
B004T36GCU,1,12,I am with T-Mobile and could not have all the apps.
B004T36GCU,1,13,there are many fantastic apps you can get for these phones and it's far less restricted from apple's market from what I understand.
B004T36GCU,1,14,I wish I knew which apps caused it.
B004T36GCU,1,15,very confusing to operate and has no gps on it that I could find.
B004T36GCU,1,16,I am somewhat of a rookie when it comes to smartphones so am not the best critic, but there is a lot with this phone that I'm not happy with.
B004T36GCU,1,17,It drops service when I am googling or doing something else,  i.e. using navigation or other application.
B004T36GCU,1,18,Don't get if you need to download apps.
B004T36GCU,1,19,The SIM card did work so we could not use the apps, even if it did work we probably would have sent it back because it was not user friendly.
B004T36GCU,1,20,Not the best!
B004T36GCU,1,21,this phone is unable to download certain apps in the play store.
B004T36GCU,1,22,I'm trying to be patient and hope it'll all work out.
B004T36GCU,1,23,the battery can cause panic for some because I've found that your pictures, videos and music will vanish and the only way to make them visible is to remove the battery AND restart your phone.
B004T36GCU,1,24,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,2,0,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,2,1,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,2,2,Good product.
B004T36GCU,2,3,not such a great smartphone.
B004T36GCU,2,4,Great features and great phone.
B004T36GCU,2,5,I bought this phone because it was a great deal.
B004T36GCU,2,6,Not all that great!
B004T36GCU,2,7,NOT VERY GOOD PRODUCT.
B004T36GCU,2,8,Don't buy unless 50 bucks get reduced from asking price.
B004T36GCU,2,9,This is a cool samrt phone and the price is just as great.
B004T36GCU,2,10,Not a good buy.
B004T36GCU,2,11,I would not recommend anyone to buy this
B004T36GCU,2,12,Good phone, but it came broken.
B004T36GCU,2,13,I am somewhat of a rookie when it comes to smartphones so am not the best critic, but there is a lot with this phone that I'm not happy with.
B004T36GCU,2,14,Voice quality of this product is not at all good, I bought it with out reading the reviews.If you are looking for a good phone with all basic features, its better not to buy this one
B004T36GCU,2,15,If your looking a good priced phone at a low cost--this is a nice one... Just look out for the battery problem, the price to ship back to the supplier and wait for the refund was just not worth the hassle...
B004T36GCU,2,16,GREAT JOB, Amazon.
B004T36GCU,2,17,I wish I have never purchased it and would not recommend it.
B004T36GCU,2,18,So I bought the phone hoping I was going to be able to write a good review but it comes as if I only have a few nice things to say.
B004T36GCU,2,19,seller is good the product itself is bad.
B004T36GCU,2,20,Amazon has just gotten to big for there own good.
B004T36GCU,2,21,nice cellphone but.
B004T36GCU,2,22,The phone works good, but that was a complete dissapointment.
B004T36GCU,2,23,When I bought this phone it was good, now it has problems and I can't get a replacement because of the time that I had the phone.
B004T36GCU,2,24,I think the team is good, have not much experience in this world of the smart phone, but it is well fluid've seen from HTC.The only thing I dislike about this is the time duration of the battery is exhausted soon.Another thing I do not like is that the screen is very dirty .....I give it three stars ......regards....
B004T36GCU,3,0,Other phones that I have owned, the battery life had lasted me 3 or 4 days.
B004T36GCU,3,1,Great for about 30 days.
B004T36GCU,3,2,battery wasn't good and got replaced.
B004T36GCU,3,3,FULLY CHARGED BATTERY DOES NOT LAST UP TO 24H RS, EXCEPT IF YOU DO NOT USE THE PHONE AT ALL.2.
B004T36GCU,3,4,battery life on lasted 6 hours from a full charge with minimal use.
B004T36GCU,3,5,Phone does not hold charge.
B004T36GCU,3,6,I give 30% rating as the charged phone does not last an hour after being charged.
B004T36GCU,3,7,I did not rate battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,8,Because others said their phone was good.
B004T36GCU,3,9,The phone seems fully charged though.
B004T36GCU,3,10,Didnt like the way screen felt ... Phone didnt last a day with out giving me problems.. Wasnt charging right and battery just didnt seem any good...
B004T36GCU,3,11,Great Phone but Batt Life sucks.
B004T36GCU,3,12,Still discovering features.Battery life is only good for a day.
B004T36GCU,3,13,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,3,14,Great phone ,fast arrival, working good and everything but not new.
B004T36GCU,3,15,The battery does not keep charge as long as it supposed to be.
B004T36GCU,3,16,So when I got there we discovered that the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,3,17,Battery life is about 3/4 of a day with normal use.
B004T36GCU,3,18,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,3,19,I think I might have loved this phone but the battery would not stay charged even to try it out and the battery  had to be removed every time to  switch it on, so I am afraid I had to return it.
B004T36GCU,3,20,The battery life is abysmal, and the camera is lacking.
B004T36GCU,3,21,The phone was fully charged but it couldn't hold for 2 hours.
B004T36GCU,3,22,The phone works good, but that was a complete dissapointment.
B004T36GCU,3,23,bad phone.
B004T36GCU,3,24,Take your time in taking off the cover for the battery also it is hard to remove.
B004T36GCU,4,0,good.
B004T36GCU,4,1,Phone reception and sound quality are an issue.
B004T36GCU,4,2,Not good for anything else.
B004T36GCU,4,3,Picture quality is also good.
B004T36GCU,4,4,Sound in speaker very bad, internet hoop up, is good, screen was good also.
B004T36GCU,4,5,Anyhow, the phone works fine.
B004T36GCU,4,6,Features , reception.
B004T36GCU,4,7,Again, ok for just making calls.
B004T36GCU,4,8,Ok for just a phone to make and take calls.
B004T36GCU,4,9,The phone works fine but i can see the guts of the phone while am using it.
B004T36GCU,4,10,Picture messages not working, there is no reception at some places and some calls are drope out, the battery runs out fast but the video recording is clear and great
B004T36GCU,4,11,The phone look nice, some features are ok, but it has a grand problem with the signal reception.
B004T36GCU,4,12,But finally after 6 months of struggle with the speaker and the sound quality, the phone is dead.
B004T36GCU,4,13,Had some problem with the 'speaker' - hence a problem with the basic functionality.
B004T36GCU,4,14,Non-working earpiece speaker.
B004T36GCU,4,15,Too heavy to pick it up everywhere and it doesnt'n work good with some aplications.
B004T36GCU,4,16,Voice quality of this product is not at all good, I bought it with out reading the reviews.If you are looking for a good phone with all basic features, its better not to buy this one
B004T36GCU,4,17,Like i said the phone works all to well, i was pretty impressed however the above mention problems bugged me.
B004T36GCU,4,18,OK. Make sure you buy a case with this phone; the housing started stripping the same day I got the phone...which by the way came opened  and seems to have been used already...the speaker is POOR!!.. but when the headphones are in its ok.
B004T36GCU,4,19,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,4,20,Great features and great phone.
B004T36GCU,4,21,Great phone ,fast arrival, working good and everything but not new.
B004T36GCU,4,22,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,4,23,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,4,24,That cell phone was not working the display so i had to pay to fix that so it was not really good
B004T36GCU,5,0,Great camera
B004T36GCU,5,1,Camera 8MP is good, but some pictures once token can not be stored if you use flash.
B004T36GCU,5,2,This is a pretty decent phone for a back up.
B004T36GCU,5,3,Camera is awesome, and the size is great.
B004T36GCU,5,4,OMG THE PICTURE FEATURE ONLY SHOOTS ONE WAY.
B004T36GCU,5,5,Because it has 8 megapixels I was expected the camera to be sharp with great resolution.
B004T36GCU,5,6,Plus, as it's supposed to be a 4G phone,  there is no front camera.
B004T36GCU,5,7,Picture quality is also good.
B004T36GCU,5,8,The pictures are very blury!
B004T36GCU,5,9,Sound in speaker very bad, internet hoop up, is good, screen was good also.
B004T36GCU,5,10,Great features and great phone.
B004T36GCU,5,11,Picture messages not working, there is no reception at some places and some calls are drope out, the battery runs out fast but the video recording is clear and great
B004T36GCU,5,12,Sometimes when I unlock the screen, the camera is on, or the world clock is showing.
B004T36GCU,5,13,camera is capable of taking breath taking pictures, it's the equivalent of having a digital camera in itself.
B004T36GCU,5,14,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,5,15,Good product.
B004T36GCU,5,16,The camera performed poor compared to the 2 mp iPhone 2g camera, its flash washed things out, and the zoom features were nothing to admire.Least but not least, the item came broken, and used... which left me to ponder why I should buy it again.
B004T36GCU,5,17,This is a cool samrt phone and the price is just as great.
B004T36GCU,5,18,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,5,19,i like it and it has no problems but the problem is it does not have a front facing camera so i cant skype my family anymore but i love htc its the best.
B004T36GCU,5,20,Voice quality of this product is not at all good, I bought it with out reading the reviews.If you are looking for a good phone with all basic features, its better not to buy this one
B004T36GCU,5,21,Too heavy to pick it up everywhere and it doesnt'n work good with some aplications.
B004T36GCU,5,22,There is only one camera on this phone and it sucks, big time.
B004T36GCU,5,23,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,5,24,My test..
B004T36GCU,6,0,wasnt working.
B004T36GCU,6,1,This says it is an unlocked phone...yet it did not work for our t-mobile SIM card.
B004T36GCU,6,2,First off the phone came without the 8g sd card that it said it came with, Thank goodness I bought a 32g card when i bought the phone.
B004T36GCU,6,3,not working, would not recognize the att sim card.
B004T36GCU,6,4,No micro sd card.
B004T36GCU,6,5,this phone has only one sim card and a SD card which is not a sim card so make sure it has what the description says.
B004T36GCU,6,6,It works just fine.
B004T36GCU,6,7,The SIM card did work so we could not use the apps, even if it did work we probably would have sent it back because it was not user friendly.
B004T36GCU,6,8,The phone works fine but i can see the guts of the phone while am using it.
B004T36GCU,6,9,I put my SIM card in it and it kept saying "No SIM card in phone".
B004T36GCU,6,10,Anyhow, the phone works fine.
B004T36GCU,6,11,SD Card issues.
B004T36GCU,6,12,i want to order one but i'm not sure if it will work good there.
B004T36GCU,6,13,This phone labeled as ATT and unlocked phone, but we took it to the att to have the sim card installed,  after serveral places, the, phone never recognized the sim card.
B004T36GCU,6,14,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,6,15,While the phone on it will all of a sudden say insert your SIM , SIM not found.
B004T36GCU,6,16,Nice phone, but internet would never work.
B004T36GCU,6,17,This is not a good phone very dissatisfied  at this moment I am not  abler to add any new contact.
B004T36GCU,6,18,Great features and great phone.
B004T36GCU,6,19,this product suddenly will not recognize any sim card  which means is not unlock and will not even work with at&t; service which I have to subscribe for in other to use the phone since it fail to work with other gsm phone services.
B004T36GCU,6,20,When I first got the phone and then got my sim chip to work in it the phone was amazing.
B004T36GCU,6,21,It was sopoussed to be phones working perfectly
B004T36GCU,6,22,No matter which one we used, no micro SD card would work on this phone, which is sad because a good majority of the phone's functions need one.
B004T36GCU,6,23,It was a neat phone when it was working.
B004T36GCU,6,24,Neat phone but didn't work right.
B004T36GCU,7,0,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,7,1,Also all I received is the phone and charger, so this phone looks like it was re-packaged.Apart from that the phone works and seems in good condition but definately not new.
B004T36GCU,7,2,Also I have interruption while talking, and this is all the time.
B004T36GCU,7,3,i want to order one but i'm not sure if it will work good there.
B004T36GCU,7,4,Great while it lasts.
B004T36GCU,7,5,Great phone ,fast arrival, working good and everything but not new.
B004T36GCU,7,6,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,7,7,The phone didn't work at all because there was previous water damage.
B004T36GCU,7,8,Not all that great!
B004T36GCU,7,9,Although after exchanging it, it works great so buy at your own risk.
B004T36GCU,7,10,Buy one of these and it came to me with a damaged Battery and to buy a new tube, except that I delayed the order several times.
B004T36GCU,7,11,DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,7,12,Received Unlocked phone ... but doesn't seem new.
B004T36GCU,7,13,i received item and the battery was not working i sent an email to the buyer, he right away sent me another one, even though its not working properly but i think its good for the price
B004T36GCU,7,14,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,7,15,The phone works good, but that was a complete dissapointment.
B004T36GCU,7,16,The Phone I received was not new.
B004T36GCU,7,17,the item i received.
B004T36GCU,7,18,I wish it worked.
B004T36GCU,7,19,but overall great seller and awesome phone.
B004T36GCU,7,20,It worked fine the first 30 days, since after that it has been going blank from time to time.
B004T36GCU,7,21,I would NOT recommend buying this phone.
B004T36GCU,7,22,I never dropped a single one, and took great care of them.
B004T36GCU,7,23,Don't buy it worked nice for about a week but now it's really slow and doesn't well.
B004T36GCU,7,24,When I bought this phone it was good, now it has problems and I can't get a replacement because of the time that I had the phone.
B004T36GCU,8,0,Service at Home.
B004T36GCU,8,1,and services.
B004T36GCU,8,2,T-Mobile...uh no!
B004T36GCU,8,3,good customer service.
B004T36GCU,8,4,I have no service in most areas.
B004T36GCU,8,5,it's an at&t; phone , and it's says that works on T-mobile carrier too.but,
B004T36GCU,8,6,EVEN AT THAT, IT DOES NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH WI-FI SERVICE, EVEN THOUGH THE WI-FI IS VERY STRONG AND OTHER PHONES CONNECT PERFECTLY.
B004T36GCU,8,7,Good for certain Cell company.
B004T36GCU,8,8,I switch it for T-Mobile and it was very hard to connect it to their service.
B004T36GCU,8,9,NOT ALL FEATURES WORK.
B004T36GCU,8,10,Again, ok for just making calls.
B004T36GCU,8,11,Ok for just a phone to make and take calls.
B004T36GCU,8,12,The problem is, when I pick up the phone, the signal drops to either one bar or it shows no service.
B004T36GCU,8,13,If you are in an area with spotty service this phone doesnt work for some reason.
B004T36GCU,8,14,My last Tmobile phone had issues too, I'll be dropping Tmobile once my contract is up and switching to a network that has Iphone.
B004T36GCU,8,15,I have very little service bars in my house, and even then there is an "E" where there should be 3G at the very lease.
B004T36GCU,8,16,Phone is ok but it was a AT&T; phone.
B004T36GCU,8,17,While other phones have good signal, this one fail every time, just in a few times the connection is better.
B004T36GCU,8,18,Still missed about 50% of the calls.
B004T36GCU,8,19,Sometimes it just misses a call.
B004T36GCU,8,20,I am with T-Mobile and could not have all the apps.
B004T36GCU,8,21,But I will likely look for another phone because of an issue with bad reception.My house is in an area where cell signals are not very strong.
B004T36GCU,8,22,the phone was good not the seller.
B004T36GCU,8,23,I HAVE A VERY STRONG WI-FI IN MY HOUSE.
B004T36GCU,8,24,I try to unlock it and will not unlock .I don't know if amazon seller sold a stolen phone to me because this phone will work very good with wifi but is useless without making call with it.
B004T36GCU,9,0,It was great while it lasted, but maybe it's just HTC.
B004T36GCU,9,1,Shipped very fast!
B004T36GCU,9,2,Ovserbation on the use of a HTC A9192 Inspire 4G unlocked Phone.
B004T36GCU,9,3,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,9,4,It has lots of RAM, a fast processor, and a great camera in good lighting.I've owned three HTC Inspires in less than 9 months.
B004T36GCU,9,5,Htc inspire.
B004T36GCU,9,6,first off i must say the htc inspire 4g is an awesome phone .
B004T36GCU,9,7,I was an ATT customer when I bought this phone and the 4g was really fast, faster than my ATT DSL.
B004T36GCU,9,8,HTC A9192 Inspire.
B004T36GCU,9,9,It is incredibly slow for the processor it has.
B004T36GCU,9,10,Not upgrade-able to latest Android versions.
B004T36GCU,9,11,If you can't be satisfied with Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), you'll want to skip this phone.
B004T36GCU,9,12,htc phone.
B004T36GCU,9,13,HTC Inspire 4G.
B004T36GCU,9,14,THIS PHONE IS THE STEP-DOWN FOR ALL HTC MODELS.
B004T36GCU,9,15,HTC A9192 Inspire 4G Unlocked Phone with Android OS 3G Support 8MP.
B004T36GCU,9,16,but overall great seller and awesome phone.
B004T36GCU,9,17,Great phone ,fast arrival, working good and everything but not new.
B004T36GCU,9,18,The storage is less than 2 GB.
B004T36GCU,9,19,AT&T; - got a replacement.Inspire #2: Great phone for a week.
B004T36GCU,9,20,Will return if this doesn't work continuously for a week.My suggestion- stay away from this seller.I cant say for sure if this is a hardware  related issue, as I have had HTC devices in the past and was very satisfied with the performance just not at this time.
B004T36GCU,9,21,This was an ATT HTC inspire phone which is unlocked, The phone overall looks/works in good shape for now, but there are certain aspects which concern me.- the VOID sticker which is present on my HTC inspire (which I had got directly from ATT is missing on this one).
B004T36GCU,9,22,I wish it worked.
B004T36GCU,9,23,My first smart phone was a Droid Incredible, so I thought this would be a good choice.
B004T36GCU,9,24,HTC Inspire Unlocked 4G HSPA+ GSM Touch Android Smartphone (AT&T;, Black) Good Phone..  HTC Must learn  how to design the SIM SLOT and Back Covers..on this Phone.. SIM Solts jammed on Brand New Phone... Back Covers does not close with out gaps.
B004T36GCU,10,0,Love this phone as it has so many funcitons and features I can use.
B004T36GCU,10,1,I love to have that phone.
B004T36GCU,10,2,I love this phone.
B004T36GCU,10,3,Love...at first.

B004T36GCU,10,5,I love this phone.
B004T36GCU,10,6,I do love this phone, but having issues.
B004T36GCU,10,7,NOT ALL FEATURES WORK.
B004T36GCU,10,8,My husband has this same phone and it works great.
B004T36GCU,10,9,The phone looks good.
B004T36GCU,10,10,All other features work well and the phone has a nice layout.
B004T36GCU,10,11,Easy to use, looks nice, no issues.
B004T36GCU,10,12,It's nice and simple.
B004T36GCU,10,13,nice and simple.
B004T36GCU,10,14,Extremely well packaged!! Absolutely love it!UPDATE: I loved this phone for the first 2-3 months.
B004T36GCU,10,15,Great features and great phone.
B004T36GCU,10,16,Not recommended at all.
B004T36GCU,10,17,It gets the job done and easy to figure out.
B004T36GCU,10,18,I was absolutely not satisfied.
B004T36GCU,10,19,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,10,20,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,10,21,It works just fine.
B004T36GCU,10,22,I'm not going to go through the hassle of doing that.On the other side, I thought the interface was very easy to use and I really wish it would have worked out for me.
B004T36GCU,10,23,Beautiful pics and downloads easy.
B004T36GCU,10,24,NOT A LOT MORE I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS PHONE.
B004T36GCU,11,0,A good phone with low ringing tone.
B004T36GCU,11,1,When comparing the two phones side by side, I noticed that one of the phones has a void sticker over one screw underneath the side cover.
B004T36GCU,11,2,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,11,3,I would NOT recommend this phone, any positive reviews you have read have been written by people who had not had their phone for very long and want to brag it up (because like I said when it was new it was a very nice phone).
B004T36GCU,11,4,I've had it for a few weeks now and I have no complaints.
B004T36GCU,11,5,When i ordered this phone i heard a lot of good reviews about it.
B004T36GCU,11,6,Great while it lasts.
B004T36GCU,11,7,Great camera
B004T36GCU,11,8,Phone is too square for me, I prefer taller and skinny easier to hold.
B004T36GCU,11,9,Just an average design.
B004T36GCU,11,10,also i got a note on the box saying "we have gone green click on the link below to get user manual.. are you serious? a user manual?
B004T36GCU,11,11,The phoen ia a great phone applications are A+ everything works well.
B004T36GCU,11,12,I am somewhat of a rookie when it comes to smartphones so am not the best critic, but there is a lot with this phone that I'm not happy with.
B004T36GCU,11,13,If you can learn to hold this phone only near the top of the case, it will work.
B004T36GCU,11,14,When I turned it on first it came on then in a few minutes a red signal came on after that I couldn't get it off the power button did not respond.
B004T36GCU,11,15,Hard to read, text and mail not organized very well.
B004T36GCU,11,16,I received my phone in the mail a few days before I left the states to take it to my fiance in St Lucia.
B004T36GCU,11,17,It's nice and simple.
B004T36GCU,11,18,nice and simple.
B004T36GCU,11,19,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,11,20,A very nice HTC phone with a beautiful screen that, unfortunately, didn't work for me.
B004T36GCU,11,21,Would probably look for something else next time
B004T36GCU,11,22,There is one black screw and 2 silver screws.
B004T36GCU,11,23,The user's guide describes the GSM antenna as being in the bottom cover that covers the sim slot.
B004T36GCU,11,24,Revised review - Nice phone.
B004T36GCU,12,0,It's a waste of money.
B004T36GCU,12,1,Great features and great phone.
B004T36GCU,12,2,Don't waste your money on it.
B004T36GCU,12,3,The only way to get the phone on the internet is with wifi.
B004T36GCU,12,4,It's a waste of money.
B004T36GCU,12,5,I'll not recommend this phone to anyone, so don't waste your money.
B004T36GCU,12,6,I emailed them again and I returned the the phone for my money.
B004T36GCU,12,7,Making it nearly impossible to download anything or make calls or text.
B004T36GCU,12,8,why cant i browse using my mobile network data?
B004T36GCU,12,9,well at least with the features I can access . . .
B004T36GCU,12,10,Hard to read, text and mail not organized very well.
B004T36GCU,12,11,Great for about 30 days.
B004T36GCU,12,12,This phone has one of the biggest screens on the market right now, which is great if you surf the web mainly on your phone.
B004T36GCU,12,13,not worth it.
B004T36GCU,12,14,Would probably look for something else next time
B004T36GCU,12,15,Please be aware of this if you're considering using it with TM and want to use your smart phone for more than talk and text.
B004T36GCU,12,16,It is glitchy, constantly turning itself off in the middle of browsing, texting, or videos.
B004T36GCU,12,17,After changing all of the presets I still was not able to connect to the internet with my data plan or home wifi.
B004T36GCU,12,18,Don't buy it worked nice for about a week but now it's really slow and doesn't well.
B004T36GCU,12,19,With that being said...not a happy buyer!Also I've been using the speaker phone during calls and many people have difficulty hearing.Was unable to send multi-media messages.
B004T36GCU,12,20,Before I made the purchase, I read all the specifications to ensure it had this specific feature.
B004T36GCU,12,21,dont buy this phone u will be wasting ur money had mine litteraly a month and it already stopped working
B004T36GCU,12,22,SMART Phone - Network Connection = DUMB.
B004T36GCU,12,23,I got mine and there are so many glitches with it... the sound bar was off of it in the box and it has been a waste of money...
B004T36GCU,12,24,Voice quality of this product is not at all good, I bought it with out reading the reviews.If you are looking for a good phone with all basic features, its better not to buy this one
B004T36GCU,13,0,It seemed like the phone had been thrown in there, with a slightly off-set screen protector, slightly dusty too.Was it new?
B004T36GCU,13,1,Even with a 780p display, the colors are vivid with the S-LCD screen.*Conclusion*A
B004T36GCU,13,2,It has scratches on the screen and on the camera.
B004T36GCU,13,3,The phone has problems.
B004T36GCU,13,4,However, there are many cases, where this does not work.
B004T36GCU,13,5,Inherent screen freeze with this phone.
B004T36GCU,13,6,Disappointed big time
B004T36GCU,13,7,I feel cheated and deceived.
B004T36GCU,13,8,i switched back to my cracked screen phone!
B004T36GCU,13,9,Poor accessories, and missing accessories.
B004T36GCU,13,10,Two phones has scratches, and sometimes turn off.plus is quite slow during use.
B004T36GCU,13,11,It was sopoussed to be phones working perfectly
B004T36GCU,13,12,THE PHONE IS NICE.
B004T36GCU,13,13,I have problems with this phone I bought on February 15.
B004T36GCU,13,14,Very disappointed, I feel cheated.
B004T36GCU,13,15,Phone was never dropped, in a hard protective case from day 1, screen protector from day 1 and now less than 6 months later the phone itself will not charge the battery.
B004T36GCU,13,16,Secondly eventhough the phone looked fine when i opened the box with a closer look i noticed that the lcd screen was slightly lifted from the phone.
B004T36GCU,13,17,The phone works fine but i can see the guts of the phone while am using it.
B004T36GCU,13,18,There is a lot of dust trapped between the camera lens and the cover glass, resulting in grainy pictures.
B004T36GCU,13,19,The screen response is good and the screen size is big enough to watch movies.
B004T36GCU,13,20,I have problems with this phone.
B004T36GCU,13,21,HTC used sent instead of new. the phone sent to me was used, while I paid for new, no manual, charger very dirty, scratches on the screen.
B004T36GCU,13,22,In some cases, the phone will start up once you remove the battery and put it back in.
B004T36GCU,13,23,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,13,24,But last week while the phone was loaded heated at a temperature too high, it was impossible to touch the high temperature that had.
B004T36GCU,14,0,Don't get if you need to download apps.
B004T36GCU,14,1,This phone will not download google apps.
B004T36GCU,14,2,Does not download google apps!!
B004T36GCU,14,3,GPS doesn't work.
B004T36GCU,14,4,This is why you can not buy anything on line but apps.
B004T36GCU,14,5,The updates.
B004T36GCU,14,6,Also, after that reset, I never was able to load Google Play again, leaving me with the old android market app.
B004T36GCU,14,7,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,14,8,this phone is unable to download certain apps in the play store.
B004T36GCU,14,9,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,14,10,Once certain apps get downloaded the phone starts to freeze like it has too many cookies or a small virus on it.
B004T36GCU,14,11,But, unbeknownst to me, some apps can cause blockers.
B004T36GCU,14,12,Updates majorly slow this phone down.
B004T36GCU,14,13,GPS is dead and it is not being recognized with any navigation app (google map, waze, gps status, etc) Nothing!!!
B004T36GCU,14,14,I got this to use the square credit card reader but it requires an app to be downloaded from the google store.
B004T36GCU,14,15,Too many software issues.
B004T36GCU,14,16,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,14,17,I will post an update when I have had time to play around with it.
B004T36GCU,14,18,Support? GPS became useless after the AT&T; update to 2.3 there is no further updating for this phone.There are hacked updates that lose functionality of things like the video recording and what not,but what's the point in that.
B004T36GCU,14,19,The biggest problem is that it likes to freeze during using the navigation and while making calls.
B004T36GCU,14,20,alot of problemes in softwares.from
B004T36GCU,14,21,The phone works good, but I have a problem finding some applications and widgets I use to have...-
B004T36GCU,14,22,The wi fi doesnt work, i cant download anything from the market, it shuts off on me randomly, i cant get into my contacts list it will say force close or report.
B004T36GCU,14,23,The ones I normally see are stars and the only way to delete them is to rid of the app itself.-For
B004T36GCU,14,24,The SIM card did work so we could not use the apps, even if it did work we probably would have sent it back because it was not user friendly.
B004T36GCU,15,0,When I purchased this phone.
B004T36GCU,15,1,Buy something else.
B004T36GCU,15,2,I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE!!!
B004T36GCU,15,3,dont buy.
B004T36GCU,15,4,DONT BUY TO USE OUTSIDE OF THE US.
B004T36GCU,15,5,Dont buy this.
B004T36GCU,15,6,Bad Purchase.
B004T36GCU,15,7,I've had the phone for about 2 months now.
B004T36GCU,15,8,window was really great.
B004T36GCU,15,9,It's been over a month since I bought them so I can't return them.
B004T36GCU,15,10,I wish I have never purchased it and would not recommend it.
B004T36GCU,15,11,Had to buy another phone and get a new plan with my old company.
B004T36GCU,15,12,I wouldnt buy it again.
B004T36GCU,15,13,It says that the phone is T-Mobile unlocked but it NOT UNLOCKED.
B004T36GCU,15,14,the product after using it a month has started giving me problems.
B004T36GCU,15,15,I like it but it'll only last two years...
B004T36GCU,15,16,I did NOT buy it off of Amazon.
B004T36GCU,15,17,When I bought this phone it was good, now it has problems and I can't get a replacement because of the time that I had the phone.
B004T36GCU,15,18,I bought this phone from amazon to replace my wife's broken phone  she had from T-mobile.
B004T36GCU,15,19,Had to buy another one.
B004T36GCU,15,20,Unlocked phone.
B004T36GCU,15,21,Not unlocked, is a hoax.

B004T36GCU,16,10,I placed in the battery and put the phone to charge, but it then shut off and would not come on at all.
B004T36GCU,16,11,Battery life is about 3/4 of a day with normal use.
B004T36GCU,16,12,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,16,13,Phone would not charge after first day of use.
B004T36GCU,16,14,The battery life is just pathetic.
B004T36GCU,16,15,Glitchy and no battery life.

B004T36GCU,16,17,BATTERY ISSUES.

B004T36GCU,16,20,Battery removal is akin to medical surgery.

B004T36GCU,17,2,thank you for getting my phone on time,but the one thing it doesn't work very good.If u put the phone on speaker people can't hear you. is very bad that u cannot put your phone on speaker.Last buy from this seller.
B004T36GCU,17,3,bad phone.
B004T36GCU,17,4,Very poor quality.
B004T36GCU,17,5,Phone reception and sound quality are an issue.
B004T36GCU,17,6,too bad.
B004T36GCU,17,7,While in speaker, people complain of it being too noisy.
B004T36GCU,17,8,I wish I had listen to the bad reviews before I bought it.
B004T36GCU,17,9,so bad.
B004T36GCU,17,10,Ringer wasn't very loud I sent the phone back my husband is hard of hearing and he couldn't hardly hear it
B004T36GCU,17,11,Considering I can't even use the phone to make calls, I would have been better off buying a $25 flip phone.
B004T36GCU,17,12,Had some problem with the 'speaker' - hence a problem with the basic functionality.
B004T36GCU,17,13,This is a terrible phone, unless you really enjoy turning it off and back on.
B004T36GCU,17,14,So I got this phone a few months ago, and since the beginning it's been giving me problems when I make calls.
B004T36GCU,17,15,I bought this phone and was very disapointed with the signal reception.
B004T36GCU,17,16,People complain of my voice being too feeble.
B004T36GCU,17,17,People constantly complained they could not hear me or my wife on both hand held and speaker modes.
B004T36GCU,17,18,Voice quality of this product is not at all good, I bought it with out reading the reviews.If you are looking for a good phone with all basic features, its better not to buy this one
B004T36GCU,17,19,The back of the phone pieces do not fit properly.
B004T36GCU,17,20,buy this phoneever
B004T36GCU,17,21,dont buy it.
B004T36GCU,17,22,e eUsed on T-mobile system the Aspire only communicates at 2G and sound for the listener is sometimes garbled.
B004T36GCU,17,23,when people would call they wouldnt be able to get through most of the time.
B004T36GCU,17,24,Sound in speaker very bad, internet hoop up, is good, screen was good also.
B004T36GCU,18,0,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,18,1,not good.!!!
B004T36GCU,18,2,I am sure it was probably a good phone.
B004T36GCU,18,3,This phone was no good.
B004T36GCU,18,4,It was not good.
B004T36GCU,18,5,It isn't even really a good paperweight!!!
B004T36GCU,18,6,Because others said their phone was good.
B004T36GCU,18,7,Not a good choice.
B004T36GCU,18,8,My expectation about the phone was bad.
B004T36GCU,18,9,Not bad.
B004T36GCU,18,10,The camera is also very blurry, unlike the one I had before.
B004T36GCU,18,11,it didnot meet my  expectations.
B004T36GCU,18,12,poor quality phone.
B004T36GCU,18,13,Camera 8MP is good, but some pictures once token can not be stored if you use flash.
B004T36GCU,18,14,I even had to look on youtube how to do it cause i was giving up.. anyways its a good phone!
B004T36GCU,18,15,There is only one camera on this phone and it sucks, big time.
B004T36GCU,18,16,It doesn't have a front facing camera which is difficult and the damn thing shuts off when it wants to.
B004T36GCU,18,17,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,18,18,camera is capable of taking breath taking pictures, it's the equivalent of having a digital camera in itself.
B004T36GCU,18,19,The camera is decent, but the flash is a true champion, with two LEDs that are visible from at least half a mile away.
B004T36GCU,18,20,It is a decent phone though.
B004T36GCU,18,21,The phone does not meet its expectation.it
B004T36GCU,18,22,not a bad phone.expect
B004T36GCU,18,23,This phone is borderline functional for even the basic features.
B004T36GCU,18,24,I expected better quality from the description.
B004T36GCU,19,0,I put my SIM card in it and it kept saying "No SIM card in phone".
B004T36GCU,19,1,The phone didnt came with Memory Card.
B004T36GCU,19,2,this phone has only one sim card and a SD card which is not a sim card so make sure it has what the description says.
B004T36GCU,19,3,It does not have the SD card, I'm not sure it might be that way.
B004T36GCU,19,4,The 8gig SD card is missing, but I had another one to use.
B004T36GCU,19,5,Not possible if they don't come with an SD Card.
B004T36GCU,19,6,Even adding an SD card, that's still not valid.
B004T36GCU,19,7,Not working.
B004T36GCU,19,8,No Micro SD CardM.
B004T36GCU,19,9,And cant seem to read the sim card at times.
B004T36GCU,19,10,And lastly, they did not include a memory card, meaning I cant even take pictures.
B004T36GCU,19,11,the order should have sd ram memory with it, but their was no sd memory, I need my 8GB memory please
B004T36GCU,19,12,Also the 8G MicroSD card was missing.
B004T36GCU,19,13,I don't like this phone because it wouldn't ready my memory card.
B004T36GCU,19,14,An other thing that I don't like is that when I download applications some of them won't go on the SD card and can only be in the phone memory.
B004T36GCU,19,15,I have some problems with the product.First i didn't receive the sd card and the charger is not working properly
B004T36GCU,19,16,Doesn't have enough memory space.
B004T36GCU,19,17,some problems.
B004T36GCU,19,18,given all the fingerprints e tc this phone was not n.ew. the phone could not read my sim card and could n ot read my SD card T Mobile
B004T36GCU,19,19,Whenever I wanted to take a picture, it kept asking me to insert an SD card when in fact it was already inserted so I had to keep opening and reinserting until the phone recognized the card.
B004T36GCU,19,20,Don't buy this item if you are looking for dual sim card.
B004T36GCU,19,21,the phone didn't worked with my sim card, the i saved it to give it as gift in christmas, but when used it in december the phone didn't worked anymore.
B004T36GCU,19,22,Additionally, I only received the phone, battery, and charger, NO MicroSD memory card or microphone/earphone were received with the shipment.
B004T36GCU,19,23,I ended up taking this second phone to AT&T; and having them set me up again with a new SIM card.
B004T36GCU,19,24,First off the phone came without the 8g sd card that it said it came with, Thank goodness I bought a 32g card when i bought the phone.
B004T36GCU,20,0,the phone does not work do not.
B004T36GCU,20,1,I want to return it.
B004T36GCU,20,2,never got this order.
B004T36GCU,20,3,I bought the phone and by the time i was out of the states it stopped working.
B004T36GCU,20,4,Will be returning it.
B004T36GCU,20,5,It worked fine the first 30 days, since after that it has been going blank from time to time.
B004T36GCU,20,6,I do not know whether it had to do with just that one phone - may be defective but I had to return it to the seller.
B004T36GCU,20,7,I have to work on it before it will come back on.
B004T36GCU,20,8,Phone has no resepition, I am not using the phone at this time.
B004T36GCU,20,9,The company has approved the return, but I am liable for return postage as well.
B004T36GCU,20,10,it does not work at all.
B004T36GCU,20,11,I've returned this phone probably 4-5 times and they've sent me back the same phone.. Same problems occur.
B004T36GCU,20,12,Had to replace it.
B004T36GCU,20,13,Even with Amazon fulfilling the orders, you'll still be out money.
B004T36GCU,20,14,Only to keep it or return it for my money back.
B004T36GCU,20,15,The phone I received seems to be OK.
B004T36GCU,20,16,Had to be returned.
B004T36GCU,20,17,Which means I have to buy that from the amazon marketplace or run after the seller to send me one.
B004T36GCU,20,18,They tried to get me a new phone but then said they didn't have one,so I returned it and still waiting for my refund.
B004T36GCU,20,19,i received a damaged phone.
B004T36GCU,20,20,I did not immediately purchase replacement insurance.
B004T36GCU,20,21,The phone was shipped and came in on time.
B004T36GCU,20,22,When I bought this phone it was good, now it has problems and I can't get a replacement because of the time that I had the phone.
B004T36GCU,20,23,Had to order the item twice, first order was defect and after 3 weeks i got the second product which is still defective.
B004T36GCU,20,24,I must do to return the  damage phone?
B004T36GCU,21,0,Did not work right on T-Mobile.
B004T36GCU,21,1,THIS IS NOT UNLOCKED.
B004T36GCU,21,2,It says that the phone is T-Mobile unlocked but it NOT UNLOCKED.
B004T36GCU,21,3,The phone is not unlocked.
B004T36GCU,21,4,but it is not unlocked.
B004T36GCU,21,5,ITS NOT UNLOCKED!!!

B004T36GCU,21,13,the phone doesnt work with tmobile it is not a unlocked phone none of my stuff works.
B004T36GCU,21,14,I even went to T-mobile store, they told me they had tried it before for some other customers and it did not work well with their network.
B004T36GCU,21,15,Cannot get on T-Mobile data network.
B004T36GCU,21,16,Unlocked Phone.
B004T36GCU,21,17,is not unlocked as they said.
B004T36GCU,21,18,i need to buy a unlock number on internet for use it.
B004T36GCU,21,19,they don't support T-Mobile 2100 band.
B004T36GCU,21,20,The phone its new but the problem its that the phone is not unlocked only work with AT&T; edge.
B004T36GCU,21,21,I returned this item because I could not get service at my home with an AT&T;  sim card.
B004T36GCU,21,22,If they did, I would not buy it since I don't want a ATT phone.
B004T36GCU,21,23,I called my company (T-mobile) and they helped me with that.
B004T36GCU,21,24,unlock code? will i need one?
B004T36GCU,22,0,Almost never see 4G, just an 'E' and do not know what that means.
B004T36GCU,22,1,This is NOT a HTC Inspire 4G!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,22,2,htc inspire cl I get this battery sin!
B004T36GCU,22,3,HTC INSPIRE "4G" UNLOCKED.
B004T36GCU,22,4,htc.
B004T36GCU,22,5,htc Inspire 4G.
B004T36GCU,22,6,my htc inspire 4g unlocked.
B004T36GCU,22,7,HTC A9192 Inspire 4G Unlocked Phone with Android OS 3G Support 8MP.
B004T36GCU,22,8,HTC inspire.
B004T36GCU,22,9,HTC Inspire.
B004T36GCU,22,10,HTC A9192 inspire.
B004T36GCU,22,11,I am not giving up on android phones, but any one who asks me, I would insist they do not get any HTC phone whatsoever.
B004T36GCU,22,12,HTC Inspire 4G.
B004T36GCU,22,13,htc inpire.
B004T36GCU,22,14,HTC Inspire phone.
B004T36GCU,22,15,A9192 Inspire 4G Unlocked Phone with Android OS, 3G Support, 8 MP) .
B004T36GCU,22,16,Slow data transmission.
B004T36GCU,22,17,HTC Inspire.
B004T36GCU,22,18,This phone is supposed to be 4G but I have yet to experience any 4G capabilities.
B004T36GCU,22,19,I ordered the Inspire 4G but got the Desire HD with an Inspire 4G sticker on the box.
B004T36GCU,22,20,Why would HTC ever make a phone with such limited use?
B004T36GCU,22,21,htc.
B004T36GCU,22,22,There are differences between both phones, mainly the Desire HD does NOT support 4G.
B004T36GCU,22,23,I consulted a technician and he said the problem is common and it's a hardware problem.
B004T36GCU,22,24,Lacks in Speed and Support but recovers with 4G and 8 MP Camera w/F.
B004T36GCU,23,0,then the phone wouldnt let me text certain users on my contact list.
B004T36GCU,23,1,Mi queja es la siguiente, llegó la caja conteniendo el celular solicitado con dos cuestiones, primero faltaba la memory card que se especifica en el contenido de la caja y segundo es evidente que en la malla que cubre lo que seria el auriular, que es la vista del equipo, está como torcida, eso debe ser defecto de fabrica.
B004T36GCU,23,2,Phone turns off when I take pictures, open texts, even open the phone from being on stand-by.
B004T36GCU,23,3,As if that isn't bad enough, the call quality is terrible!!!
B004T36GCU,23,4,I got this phone about a year ago and returned it for a full refund.. it worked pretty well, I remember having a few small issues with it but not what they were exactly.. one problem was the button to turn the screen off and on was so small, you had to press it extremely hard until it hurt your finger.
B004T36GCU,23,5,It would give me error messages when I tried to send a text message too when i did have signal.
B004T36GCU,23,6,Even my old blackberry curve has better call quality and battery life.
B004T36GCU,23,7,It was easy to customize and visually appealing, which is pretty standard for HTC products.
B004T36GCU,23,8,Hardly ideal for something you will be pressing all the time..
B004T36GCU,23,9,I've returned this phone probably 4-5 times and they've sent me back the same phone.. Same problems occur.
B004T36GCU,23,10,Absolutely worthless.
B004T36GCU,23,11,Yo realicé esta queja al recibir el producto, peero lo hice por un canal equivocado,
B004T36GCU,23,12,The second phone of this would not let me use my data and would show that i had no signal and i know i did because i was standing beside someone with the exact same phone and they had signal and i didnt.
B004T36GCU,23,13,My third one i just got today would tell me that application that runs the phone has an error and i can force close or tell htc if you selected either it would pop up again and then the screen would completely go black.
B004T36GCU,23,14,been a complete nuisance and i'd rather just of gotten an iphone.
B004T36GCU,23,15,The phone freezes all the time so i have to take the battery out to unfreeze it.
B004T36GCU,23,16,When I frist got the phone, it was working fine, I could send picture texts.
B004T36GCU,23,17,I can't believe I gave up my old blackberry for this ... my biggest regret in phone purchases!!!
B004T36GCU,23,18,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,23,19,the phone doesnt ring or vibrate when i get a incoming call or text i've reset the phone 3 -4 times and it happens everytime.
B004T36GCU,23,20,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,23,21,It worked fine the first 30 days, since after that it has been going blank from time to time.
B004T36GCU,23,22,The product it is deffective, the screen at the top area does not work, the charger it is not original, the battery it is not original, the signal is bad.
B004T36GCU,23,23,the battery does not work  the phone will not turn  should review the product before sending.
B004T36GCU,23,24,thought was great at first but two weeks later phone started giving me problems kept rebooting on its own would allow me to make calls phone was giving me lots of problems
B004T36GCU,24,0,Hardly ideal for something you will be pressing all the time..
B004T36GCU,24,1,The phone locks up all of the time.
B004T36GCU,24,2,Half the time I couldn't press it at all unless I used my nails.
B004T36GCU,24,3,My complaints are that at times it shuts down without any cause and I couldn't get it to turn back on.
B004T36GCU,24,4,It locks up every other day it seems, but other than that it works ok.
B004T36GCU,24,5,The phone is slow and some times the plastic cover at the back side of bottom cames out when you try to take out from your pocket.
B004T36GCU,24,6,It is locked phone.
B004T36GCU,24,7,the phone doesnt ring or vibrate when i get a incoming call or text i've reset the phone 3 -4 times and it happens everytime.
B004T36GCU,24,8,I cannot customize or organize my home screen.
B004T36GCU,24,9,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,24,10,This phone was  locked and was not new and did not have a manual.
B004T36GCU,24,11,After doing some research, I had to set the wallpaper and settings to "default" which helped this problem.
B004T36GCU,24,12,Would reset ring tone and delete ring tones.
B004T36GCU,24,13,Still missed about 50% of the calls.
B004T36GCU,24,14,Sometimes it just misses a call.
B004T36GCU,24,15,Once it started up, I noticed that the left side of the phone did not work.
B004T36GCU,24,16,I can't even use this app on this phone I just purchased because I can't change the language settings to english (us) or (uk).
B004T36GCU,24,17,It kept freezing at least 3 to 4 times a day.
B004T36GCU,24,18,The phone works ok but after half hr to an hr it shuts off an im unable to power it on back using the power button therefore I have take out the battery to power it on .
B004T36GCU,24,19,I changed the default wallpaper to a different one (already installed on phone) and it locked the phone up.
B004T36GCU,24,20,The phone freezes and shut down when I attempt to delete items on screen.
B004T36GCU,24,21,After 7 months, not a single scratch could be seen on my phone.Inspire #1: Fine, except the proximity sensor never worked, causing me to accidentally hang up on calls when the screen didn't turn off.
B004T36GCU,24,22,I had to press it in order to fix it in its position.
B004T36GCU,24,23,I was adjusting the volume on Spotify and the plastic volume rocker just...fell out of the phone, and it's difficult to replace.-Called
B004T36GCU,24,24,It just randomly turned back on.
B004T36GCU,25,0,When I frist got the phone, it was working fine, I could send picture texts.
B004T36GCU,25,1,It would give me error messages when I tried to send a text message too when i did have signal.
B004T36GCU,25,2,it would disconnect calls while in a call.
B004T36GCU,25,3,After changing all of the presets I still was not able to connect to the internet with my data plan or home wifi.
B004T36GCU,25,4,I have to send it back.
B004T36GCU,25,5,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,25,6,when people would call they wouldnt be able to get through most of the time.
B004T36GCU,25,7,Then after about 2 wks. it would no longer let me send picture text.
B004T36GCU,25,8,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,25,9,but i can send regular text.
B004T36GCU,25,10,phone stopped working deffective phone.
B004T36GCU,25,11,Features  were fine but was unable to send or receive calls so I had to return it.
B004T36GCU,25,12,Also, it is an unlocked phone so I was told that my picture messages will never be able to send and I will not be able to download incoming multimedia messages.
B004T36GCU,25,13,I get a lot of dropped calls also.
B004T36GCU,25,14,Unable to receive/send pictures and unable to use internet due to not truly unlocked....phone wants to use at&t; internet and data but I have tmobile
B004T36GCU,25,15,I don't wanna pay for a real expensive data plan and I don't use internet too much, but like to have it when I'm out and in a wifi zone.
B004T36GCU,25,16,I liked the phone until the wifi stopped working after 3 months for no reason.
B004T36GCU,25,17,Issues I'm encountering are as follows: 1) Phone calls are full of static or dropped frequently;  2) I am unable to receive multimedia (picture) messages even though my cell plan covers them.
B004T36GCU,25,18,To use internet you have to change some datas manually.
B004T36GCU,25,19,But then i started adding apps and connecting my e-mail and the voice went out (microphone).
B004T36GCU,25,20,You can use it to call and tx msg.
B004T36GCU,25,21,This phone is set up to be used in Canada.
B004T36GCU,25,22,My cellphone is not new, the microphone  is not working and it had an information of other person, like pictures and contacts.
B004T36GCU,25,23,some reason, although I have all of my contacts from facebook on my phone, many of their profile pictures wont show up beside their name or pop up when they call.
B004T36GCU,25,24,The biggest problem is that it likes to freeze during using the navigation and while making calls.
