B00COYOAYW,1,1,More apps!
B00COYOAYW,1,2,Doesn't have all of the same apps available as I had with the Android.
B00COYOAYW,1,3,no windows phone!
B00COYOAYW,1,4,Can't use Google or IPhone Apps but Windows 8 have their own apps to make up for it.
B00COYOAYW,1,5,Now know this, Android has over 895,000 apps, while Windows 8 has around 170,000 apps.
B00COYOAYW,1,6,Android has over 800 thousand apps and games while Windows 8 only about 185 thousand.
B00COYOAYW,1,7,App store has a bunch of rip-offs and the good apps arent even well made.-
B00COYOAYW,1,8,I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.
B00COYOAYW,1,9,If APPS are important to you, do not get this phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,10,I was skeptical about getting a windows phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,11,Windows 8.
B00COYOAYW,1,12,Windows Phone!
B00COYOAYW,1,13,Slowly getting used to the Windows phone being very different from the Androids that I've always used.
B00COYOAYW,1,14,Windows 8 phones are terrific.
B00COYOAYW,1,15,From Android to Windows.
B00COYOAYW,1,16,Enterprise apps that work.
B00COYOAYW,1,17,Windows apps are different from those the Android market.
B00COYOAYW,1,18,They made the OS into an app.
B00COYOAYW,1,19,I don't use instagram but I saw they have a beta app.
B00COYOAYW,1,20,there are not as many apps or podcasts for Windows, but there are enough to keep me occupied and who needs all those games?
B00COYOAYW,1,21,The store does have good apps and some that are very similar to those on the android market.
B00COYOAYW,1,22,Get me back to Android please!
B00COYOAYW,1,23,If you're an app addict, this may not be the phone for you - just yet.
B00COYOAYW,1,24,Windows is.* Apps?

B00COYOAYW,3,0,Very Poor Battery Life.
B00COYOAYW,3,1,Battery life.
B00COYOAYW,3,2,Very good battery life too.
B00COYOAYW,3,3,The battery lasts about two days with this use.
B00COYOAYW,3,4,And its battery is good.
B00COYOAYW,3,5,I keep my phone on "Battery Saver", and I can go 24+ hours and still have about 30% battery life by the end of that cycle.
B00COYOAYW,3,6,now the phone wont turn on at all but it shows that the battery is charging.
B00COYOAYW,3,7,The battery life is really good.
B00COYOAYW,3,8,The phone itself is good and battery life is ok.
B00COYOAYW,3,9,battery life great - approx day and a half without using battery saver.
B00COYOAYW,3,10,Battery life to a certain extent is good.
B00COYOAYW,3,11,Battery life is great.
B00COYOAYW,3,12,Good battery life.
B00COYOAYW,3,13,Battery life is terrible unless you have the battery saver on.
B00COYOAYW,3,14,Seems to have better battery life (2x charge a week vs 1.5x a day).
B00COYOAYW,3,15,Drains the battery within 4 hours.
B00COYOAYW,3,16,I charge it every other day.
B00COYOAYW,3,17,Battery life is great.
B00COYOAYW,3,18,It has really long battery life so you don't have to charge every few hours and recharges quickly too so that is good.
B00COYOAYW,3,19,I charge my phone usually every other day.
B00COYOAYW,3,20,I was a little concerned with battery life, but it goes days between charges, which is partially a reflection on how little I use the phone each day.
B00COYOAYW,3,21,battery issue.
B00COYOAYW,3,22,Looks like a defective battery or the phone just doesn't really last more than 5 hours.
B00COYOAYW,3,23,Battery life got better as it was used.
B00COYOAYW,3,24,Overall, a phone is about call clarity and battery life.
B00COYOAYW,4,0,Good quality phone!
B00COYOAYW,4,1,So Far So Good.
B00COYOAYW,4,2,no quality.
B00COYOAYW,4,3,Good quality.

B00COYOAYW,4,6,Good sound.
B00COYOAYW,4,7,Great Phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,8,great phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,9,- but not flimsy-Speaker is okay, sounds surprisingly good for a phone-Screen is sharp-Windows 8 is really good (shocking) so far-Camera is okay, but sluggish
B00COYOAYW,4,10,If you're in a good reception zone, good call quality.3)
B00COYOAYW,4,11,Very good phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,12,The phone works really good.
B00COYOAYW,4,13,Very Good phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,14,quality is better than old one.all in all good phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,15,The sound and the videos from you tube are loud and clear so if they fix that adobe it will make it a great phone but no adobe not so great.
B00COYOAYW,4,16,Call quality was ok but not great, there are much better phones out there.
B00COYOAYW,4,17,The screen is pretty great with good quality.
B00COYOAYW,4,18,Great Phone.

B00COYOAYW,4,24,Good reception.
B00COYOAYW,5,0,The camera is decent (as phone cameras go), There is no flash though.
B00COYOAYW,5,1,Camera not too great and im use to a front facing camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,2,I only wish it had a better camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,3,Very good camera too.
B00COYOAYW,5,4,Attention: no flash, no front camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,5,good phonr.
B00COYOAYW,5,6,No NFC, front camera, flash, or compass.
B00COYOAYW,5,7,no front facing camera if you are a skyper
B00COYOAYW,5,8,Sweet camera options but the camera is awful.
B00COYOAYW,5,9,There is also no flash on the camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,10,No camera flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,11,What I like best, though, are the camera features.
B00COYOAYW,5,12,Over all it seems like a good phone at a good price.
B00COYOAYW,5,13,I really like it would b perfect if it had a camera in the front.
B00COYOAYW,5,14,Cameras good and has many cool features.
B00COYOAYW,5,15,Note that it does not have a front facing camera nor does it have a flash, but what did you expect for this price.
B00COYOAYW,5,16,The camera and pictures--I know there is no flash however low light pictures look great for a low end phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,17,I wish it had a flash and a front facing camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,18,Camera is good in light only, and the apps are pretty cool for the camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,19,It's a good phone with great features.
B00COYOAYW,5,20,I don't think a camera should be added if it had no flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,21,Front camera would make it an excellent phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,22,The camera takes decent low light pictures.
B00COYOAYW,5,23,Good so far.
B00COYOAYW,5,24,I didn't know there was not a flash and front camera, but overall cool phone.����
B00COYOAYW,6,0,Sim Card is used.
B00COYOAYW,6,1,Nice phone but when I couldn't get the SIM cards to activate with MetroPCS, I took the phones to them.They tried with their SIM cards and couldn't get the phone going.
B00COYOAYW,6,2,Phone didn't work with MetroPCS.
B00COYOAYW,6,3,i would have kept it if my sim card was compatible...
B00COYOAYW,6,4,You have to install the micro sim card unless you already have one.
B00COYOAYW,6,5,FYI it uses a micro sim.
B00COYOAYW,6,6,We had standard sim cards previously that are too big.
B00COYOAYW,6,7,Otherwise, you would need to activate the new SIM card which comes with the phone and that renders the old SIM card worthless.Contacts Import:Another fail.
B00COYOAYW,6,8,After charging it, I needed to insert my SIM card from my old phone.The SIM Card:The SIM card slot is underneath the battery and smaller than the one I was using from a phone about 3 years old.
B00COYOAYW,6,9,I did not get the chance to use it because I have a standard sim card and this one uses a mini sim.
B00COYOAYW,6,10,Phone seems good but I called T-Mobile costumer service to activate it and they said the sim card was used.
B00COYOAYW,6,11,The phone came and I converted my SIM card and it has been great ever since.
B00COYOAYW,6,12,It requires a micro sim card which it does not state in the description.
B00COYOAYW,6,13,It won't import from the sd card.
B00COYOAYW,6,14,Micro SD card for storage expansion, nice camera and good set of apps from Nokia.
B00COYOAYW,6,15,Great phone.
B00COYOAYW,6,16,It took me 5 tries to get the SIM card installed correctly.
B00COYOAYW,6,17,I went to the T-Mobile store to try it and it did not work, but works well with the 925.
B00COYOAYW,6,18,So I just took my SIM card out of my old phone and popped it into this one.
B00COYOAYW,6,19,Would be nice to be able to install apps on SD card.8.
B00COYOAYW,6,20,I tried, and it works great.
B00COYOAYW,6,21,Enterprise apps that work.
B00COYOAYW,6,22,Works great as a work phone.
B00COYOAYW,6,23,You can put in a 64GB micro SD card and have a backup battery, those are the 2 important options not on a 925.
B00COYOAYW,6,24,For those that need Good.com and Lync 2010, they work and work better than on Android.
B00COYOAYW,7,0,It has been working great!
B00COYOAYW,7,1,time will tell no more to say
B00COYOAYW,7,2,good phone.

B00COYOAYW,7,10,purchase for my son he loves it works well features are great , I think I will order one for myself.
B00COYOAYW,7,11,Nor is it a Samsung.
B00COYOAYW,7,12,great phone!
B00COYOAYW,7,13,be i will order 3 more
B00COYOAYW,7,14,Great price for a great phone.
B00COYOAYW,7,15,This phone is great and it is also $600 less than the iPhone 5s.
B00COYOAYW,7,16,good.
B00COYOAYW,7,17,He would have to take his battery out and put it back in in order for it  to make calls.Overall very disappointing.
B00COYOAYW,7,18,Received the phone on time and in working order.
B00COYOAYW,7,19,I received my new phone promptly and in perfect condition.
B00COYOAYW,7,20,Will definitely order another Nokia phone next time.
B00COYOAYW,7,21,Would have been better off getting another galaxy s.
B00COYOAYW,7,22,The phone we kept works good.
B00COYOAYW,7,23,And here it is, after using iPhone and Samsung galaxy, it surely a compromise, but with this prize, it's awesome deal.
B00COYOAYW,7,24,And it works really well at that.
B00COYOAYW,8,0,Phone didn't work with MetroPCS.
B00COYOAYW,8,1,The phone is great.
B00COYOAYW,8,2,T-mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,8,3,great phone great service.
B00COYOAYW,8,4,But I know it's coming!Great customer service Amazon!!
B00COYOAYW,8,5,I'll probably let the service expire, and then just reactivate it whenever I need to.
B00COYOAYW,8,6,Works great, but if you have a Contract already make sure you call your provider.
B00COYOAYW,8,7,I'm keeping the phone but switching service to AT&T.;
B00COYOAYW,8,8,T-Mobile is horrible.
B00COYOAYW,8,9,This is the worst customer service I have ever had regrading a cell phone.
B00COYOAYW,8,10,Horrible phone and service.
B00COYOAYW,8,11,Excellent phone but T-Mobile is horrible.
B00COYOAYW,8,12,Let me state that I primarily use this phone with the Wi-Fi calling feature, as I do not have cell service at home.
B00COYOAYW,8,13,Everything else is there and works great.
B00COYOAYW,8,14,WiFi works great.
B00COYOAYW,8,15,The T-Mobile service is ok, but it's hard for me to comment because since I've gotten this phone I've mostly been on an island off the coast of NC and there is not good service here anyway.
B00COYOAYW,8,16,Ordered it for a friend and she loves it works great and no problems works with my service provider and im in The Bahamas.
B00COYOAYW,8,17,Great phone.
B00COYOAYW,8,18,It only does it while I'm at work.
B00COYOAYW,8,19,WiFi works great.
B00COYOAYW,8,20,As t mobile has poor coverage at our home, wifi calling was crucial for this phone to work.
B00COYOAYW,8,21,Wifi calling works great, particularly since T-mobile doesn't have great coverage everywhere (like inside my house).
B00COYOAYW,8,22,What a great buy
B00COYOAYW,8,23,Device itself is great and works as it supposed to be however activating with T-Mobile was pain.
B00COYOAYW,8,24,Good buy.

B00COYOAYW,9,22,Nice device, good price.
B00COYOAYW,9,23,Major upgrade from my HTC MyTouch 4G.
B00COYOAYW,9,24,This phone to replace an HTC HD7 which had lots of flaky hardware issues.Windows 8 is a good improvement from WP7. Clear smooth and responsive.

B00COYOAYW,11,0,Good so far.
B00COYOAYW,11,1,Plus it does not let you change the background color.
B00COYOAYW,11,2,I gave the wrong review on the illumishield plastic covers.
B00COYOAYW,11,3,Not good.
B00COYOAYW,11,4,Good phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,5,however, my GF seems to think this an old phone just b/c of the design, but its not.
B00COYOAYW,11,6,A few things I would change:1.
B00COYOAYW,11,7,It is a good phone for an average user.
B00COYOAYW,11,8,Read the other reviews, it is a really good phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,9,Several reviewers have noted this same phenomenon.
B00COYOAYW,11,10,I wish they'd put that bing button on the left tho.
B00COYOAYW,11,11,Lots of color.
B00COYOAYW,11,12,You can change the box colors, but my husband wanted wallpapers, which it does not do.
B00COYOAYW,11,13,LOVE this phone!
B00COYOAYW,11,14,The power button is accidently pressed all the time.
B00COYOAYW,11,15,You can hold down the "back" button and see all the apps running in the background.
B00COYOAYW,11,16,Nokia really could have place the power button at a different place or at least change the side design.
B00COYOAYW,11,17,are you Looking for a change?
B00COYOAYW,11,18,Love how I can set up the screen with different size tags.
B00COYOAYW,11,19,Dont reward them for the poor design and functionality.
B00COYOAYW,11,20,I read a lot of reviews online and it seems a lot of people have had that issue.
B00COYOAYW,11,21,Yes, I changed the background to white, which does make it easier to see.
B00COYOAYW,11,22,After a week, I can say that I love it.
B00COYOAYW,11,23,Overall good and easy phone to work with.
B00COYOAYW,11,24,Don't let some of these reviews scare you, it was an amazing phone.

B00COYOAYW,12,1,I pay $50 a mo for unltd text, data, calls...
B00COYOAYW,12,2,good for calling and texting.
B00COYOAYW,12,3,Used to have the T-mobile 30.00 a month plan (1500 talk/text and a pathetic 30 Mb of data).
B00COYOAYW,12,4,I use it with the T-mobile pay as go plan, with no data plan (so I just use wifi).
B00COYOAYW,12,5,great value for this money.

B00COYOAYW,12,12,Prepaid plan, no data, with wifi.
B00COYOAYW,12,13,I have t-mobile paygo gold plan which I keep alive annually with a $10 payment.
B00COYOAYW,12,14,So, wherever there is no wifi, I can only talk and text.
B00COYOAYW,12,15,Can use with T-Mo Pay As You Go Plan BUT.
B00COYOAYW,12,16,The 521 comes with wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,12,17,A great phone.
B00COYOAYW,12,18,Switched my T-Mobile 3-line family plan to their new plan and pay 60% less per month even after an adding a 4th line.
B00COYOAYW,12,19,Seemed to work okay as long as you have added extra money to the account for the 10 cent calls and 20 cent texts.
B00COYOAYW,12,20,It's great value for the money.
B00COYOAYW,12,21,I don't make many cell calls, and this plan doesn't allow data.
B00COYOAYW,12,22,for each phone , we have a family plan with unlimited everything for 120.00 only.
B00COYOAYW,12,23,But like I said it will use your minutes if you have the Pay as You Go plan.
B00COYOAYW,12,24,It will use Wi-Fi seamlessly to make phone calls - when my gf calls me over the Wi-Fi it still shows as her phone number calling.
B00COYOAYW,13,0,The only problem i had was having to go from my usual big screen 4.7 screens to an actual 4.0 one.
B00COYOAYW,13,1,Phone case.
B00COYOAYW,13,2,When I recently put a screen protector on I couldn't find any scratches on the screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,3,Because the case didn't fit my phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,4,The screen is super sens, so much that you can hover your finger over the screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,5,wrong screen protector.
B00COYOAYW,13,6,When I just want to get to the home screen, it'll reboot.
B00COYOAYW,13,7,The Lumia is the first touch screen phone I have used.
B00COYOAYW,13,8,There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time.
B00COYOAYW,13,9,Touch screen is same as iphone, very quick and responsive.-
B00COYOAYW,13,10,Nice case...fit correctly on my nokia lumina 521however the screen protector was for model nokia 520and did not fit my 521
B00COYOAYW,13,11,Ability to have a high contrast screen (for those with poor eyesight or someone who wants a cool looking screen)7.
B00COYOAYW,13,12,Screen should be brighter and screen should not shut-off as quickly when plugged in.4.
B00COYOAYW,13,13,Nokia or the windowsphone store looking for these accessories such as the screen protectors and cases.
B00COYOAYW,13,14,Got to find a better case for it though.
B00COYOAYW,13,15,Wipe your screen more often, or put an anti-smudge screen protector and you're problems are solved.
B00COYOAYW,13,16,Once I got a good case for it the problems with it leaping from my pocket were fixed.
B00COYOAYW,13,17,I think I may have dropped it once from my pocket to the floor and the screen is all screwed up already.
B00COYOAYW,13,18,Touch screen sensitivity adjustable.12.
B00COYOAYW,13,19,I have not tried a non-glare screen protector.2.
B00COYOAYW,13,20,I will say that the 900's screen seemed to "pop" more than the 521, but the 521 still has a nice color pallet.
B00COYOAYW,13,21,Unable to See Screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,22,I have been using the touch features, but the sensitivity is so great, i've 'floated' my finger near the screen without touching, and the phone counted it as a touch.The camera's LUX/low light sensitivity is TERRIBLE.
B00COYOAYW,13,23,The screen is fine, but not the newer super duper never break never get fingerprint screens.
B00COYOAYW,13,24,i had white color and its perfect :)  touch screen works perfectly.
B00COYOAYW,14,0,As for the apps I don't use that many apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,1,yea youll miss some apps the i phone has but not many.
B00COYOAYW,14,2,There are no apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,3,Now know this, Android has over 895,000 apps, while Windows 8 has around 170,000 apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,4,I could refill my prescriptions with an app on my phone which I cannot do since there isn't an app for it on Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,5,Lack of apps, doesn't have my bank app yet, I use this app all the time2.
B00COYOAYW,14,6,Are there less app's for Windows Phone?
B00COYOAYW,14,7,apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,8,Ya I can't get all the farting apps that android has.
B00COYOAYW,14,9,This is a WINDOWS phone not an Android Phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,10,Really dissapointting, like Windows 8.
B00COYOAYW,14,11,The apps seems limited compared to apps you can get for iphone/droid.
B00COYOAYW,14,12,I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.
B00COYOAYW,14,13,Some key apps I would like to have are only on the iPhone and Android.-
B00COYOAYW,14,14,For now, quite a few of the iphone apps I used do not have a windows version yet.
B00COYOAYW,14,15,Windows is.* Apps?
B00COYOAYW,14,16,there are not as many apps or podcasts for Windows, but there are enough to keep me occupied and who needs all those games?
B00COYOAYW,14,17,The apps are limited.
B00COYOAYW,14,18,But think about all the useless apps that people have polluted Google play with, the apps that aren't really apps, and the apps that aren't  free.
B00COYOAYW,14,19,It's a Windows Phone, not an iPhone, not an Android.
B00COYOAYW,14,20,Either it is the windows OS or one of the other apps on the phone so I can't say if the windows OS is slow.
B00COYOAYW,14,21,I don't use instagram but I saw they have a beta app.
B00COYOAYW,14,22,Instagram?...etcIf you mean an "official" app made by the same people who make the app for iOS or Android - maybe yes, maybe no.
B00COYOAYW,14,23,Companies make apps for iphones and androids and few make them for windows phones.3.)
B00COYOAYW,14,24,From Android to Windows.
B00COYOAYW,15,0,Now I have to buy another phone... Again...
B00COYOAYW,15,1,Great Phone for the Price.
B00COYOAYW,15,2,4 months later, I am still using this phone, and my motivation to purchase another has been dwindled to nothing by this phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,3,i dont recommend to anyone to buy stuf from them
B00COYOAYW,15,4,dont buy.
B00COYOAYW,15,5,For this price this phone does everything.
B00COYOAYW,15,6,I just bought this phone 2 months ago.
B00COYOAYW,15,7,If you are going to buy this phone it's better to purchase it from Amazon or Ebay or something like that.
B00COYOAYW,15,8,this is a great phone and work great.
B00COYOAYW,15,9,don't buy.
B00COYOAYW,15,10,Buy it.
B00COYOAYW,15,11,So never buying phone this one or other from amazon.
B00COYOAYW,15,12,I should 've bought it there: less stress and efforts...
B00COYOAYW,15,13,Great phone, great price.
B00COYOAYW,15,14,I read the reviews on the Lumia 521 on Amazon and bought it.
B00COYOAYW,15,15,Great phone at an even better price.
B00COYOAYW,15,16,You can't get a better new smartphone at this price without contract.
B00COYOAYW,15,17,Great phone!
B00COYOAYW,15,18,A two year contract wasn't what I was looking for but I also didn't want a crappy phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,19,I will never buy another Nokia product again.
B00COYOAYW,15,20,Great phone, great price!
B00COYOAYW,15,21,None of them can be found for under $100 without a 2 year contract.
B00COYOAYW,15,22,Phone are not if you use to a android don't buy this phone wasted of money
B00COYOAYW,15,23,The phone seems defective and I wouldn't recommend buying the phone from Amazon.
B00COYOAYW,15,24,Never buying a Nokia again.
B00COYOAYW,16,0,Battery Life.
B00COYOAYW,16,1,So it blinks (charging) all never charges.
B00COYOAYW,16,2,Problems with battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,3,The charging ion would come up when I would charge but it just wouldn't power up.
B00COYOAYW,16,4,I powered the phone off (it had about 80% battery charge).
B00COYOAYW,16,5,The battery is just over 1/2 charged now.-
B00COYOAYW,16,6,Even when the phone did work the battery life was terrible.
B00COYOAYW,16,7,The battery would not hold a charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,8,I tried everything, if i plug it in (tried for about 17hr charge) it will not keep the charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,9,I keep my phone on "Battery Saver", and I can go 24+ hours and still have about 30% battery life by the end of that cycle.
B00COYOAYW,16,10,Battery life was a godsend as she can use it all day without it dying by 3-4pm.
B00COYOAYW,16,11,It wasn't until a few days later that my phone started turning off on it's own even though the battery was fully charged.
B00COYOAYW,16,12,The battery is made in Finland, but needs to be sent to Asia before it can be shipped to the U.S. and they just don't have the battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,13,The screen is working, it shows a battery charging, but it won't hold the charge and won't power up.
B00COYOAYW,16,14,The battery life.
B00COYOAYW,16,15,Now it will not even charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,16,Try not to leave it plugged in to a charger when you are using it, as it will also shorten battery life.
B00COYOAYW,16,17,Apparently all it needed was a little charging.
B00COYOAYW,16,18,When I plug it in, it says its charging so I've been charging it for a couple of hours but the phone still won't turn on.
B00COYOAYW,16,19,I would have to charge it multiple times a day.
B00COYOAYW,16,20,One day it will go dead in a few hrs and the next time will last 3 days and I don't use it that much.
B00COYOAYW,16,21,Battery Troubles.
B00COYOAYW,16,22,Good battery life.
B00COYOAYW,16,23,The Lumia uses a Li Ion battery, and not a NiCad battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,24,Again next week it happened again, but powered up after a few days.
B00COYOAYW,17,0,He would go to call someone and the phone would just not do the call.
B00COYOAYW,17,1,But you can't make a butt call.
B00COYOAYW,17,2,When on speaker it's not clear at all.
B00COYOAYW,17,3,Calls drop sporadically.
B00COYOAYW,17,4,Always getting cut off....dropping calls.
B00COYOAYW,17,5,But the speaker volume and quality blew me away!
B00COYOAYW,17,6,The most important feature for me is that I can hear people clearly without static or disturbance through the connection.
B00COYOAYW,17,7,took long time to get it to work had to call several people to figure out what was wrong finally called people made the phone and they fixed it
B00COYOAYW,17,8,Loud Speaker.
B00COYOAYW,17,9,My calls drop and my bluetooth keeps getting disconnected.
B00COYOAYW,17,10,i couldn't use my headphone to listen to music because the sound was really bad, so that I had to buy a new headphone.
B00COYOAYW,17,11,Unfortunately, It has bad reception (unless it has to do with T-Mobile) and when on speaker there is a lot of interruption.
B00COYOAYW,17,12,I need a phone with better mic and speaker since I use the speakerphone a lot.
B00COYOAYW,17,13,Listen up people!!!
B00COYOAYW,17,14,Using it for a month now, and people tell me it sounds like cell quality.
B00COYOAYW,17,15,have had this phone since November and the audio or speakers are horrible.
B00COYOAYW,17,16,Others sometimes have a hard time hearing me.
B00COYOAYW,17,17,By the time I turn on the car engine and back out my driveway, it is always connected.
B00COYOAYW,17,18,The speaker is better than my old phone and voice recognition seems to work well.
B00COYOAYW,17,19,no problems with poor connections or dropped calls after 3-4 weeks.2.
B00COYOAYW,17,20,Phone speaker defect.
B00COYOAYW,17,21,The phone we kept works good.
B00COYOAYW,17,22,The phone audio is superior, the speakerphone works very well, it has an FM radio that works great.
B00COYOAYW,17,23,The speaker is also loud as others have mentioned.
B00COYOAYW,17,24,Web worked well, calls came in clear and I could hear what the other person was saying, it had some okay apps...not really an app person.
B00COYOAYW,18,0,Overall ,good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,1,The camera is not that good.
B00COYOAYW,18,2,it's good!
B00COYOAYW,18,3,A good value.
B00COYOAYW,18,4,Would like a better camera.
B00COYOAYW,18,5,Camera is too bad.
B00COYOAYW,18,6,its a good phone when it comes to being a phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,7,It Be Good.
B00COYOAYW,18,8,The camera doesn't even have a flash.
B00COYOAYW,18,9,Good phone but.
B00COYOAYW,18,10,good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,11,Good Phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,12,no camera flash
B00COYOAYW,18,13,No Good Nokia!
B00COYOAYW,18,14,this phone executes that really well. it doesn't have a front camera.
B00COYOAYW,18,15,better than expected.
B00COYOAYW,18,16,not for me, but there are some good thing about this phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,17,As for the good, the camera is ....ok.
B00COYOAYW,18,18,So far, so good!
B00COYOAYW,18,19,(n8 has way better camera but that is it)This still has a good camera but no flash but nothing the right lighting wont solve.
B00COYOAYW,18,20,The camera is ok better than any of my other phones.
B00COYOAYW,18,21,Good value for the price .
B00COYOAYW,18,22,Basic Phone a Good Price But a Little Hard to Ues.
B00COYOAYW,18,23,good otherwise
B00COYOAYW,18,24,Wish it had a front camera!
B00COYOAYW,19,0,SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,1,They both come with sim cards and you should be able to do it yourself.
B00COYOAYW,19,2,Comes with SIM card (fyi).
B00COYOAYW,19,3,No memory.
B00COYOAYW,19,4,SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,19,5,SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,19,6,You have to install the micro sim card unless you already have one.
B00COYOAYW,19,7,You can store music on the phone SD card, or in "the cloud" on SkyDrive.
B00COYOAYW,19,8,It came with a sim card, but I took my old T-Mobile sim card, and cut it to fit.
B00COYOAYW,19,9,If you have music to upload using an SD card, I suggest you skip Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,10,Sim Card Sucks.
B00COYOAYW,19,11,They mentioned that they don't cut sim cards, but they could transfer my information to a micro sim card.
B00COYOAYW,19,12,I am very disappointed with this purchase and found that the sim card was already used.
B00COYOAYW,19,13,Could not use my current SIM card in the device because it takes a mini sim and I have a regular size sim card
B00COYOAYW,19,14,The sim card that came with this new phone could not load my old account onto it when I got the new phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,15,It's internal memory is enough for all the apps I use and more.
B00COYOAYW,19,16,We ahd to purchase another sim card from T Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,19,17,Your music is replicated over 6 times on your memory card for no stupid reason, and there is no fix for it.
B00COYOAYW,19,18,The back plate is removable to access the micro-SD card, sim card and battery.
B00COYOAYW,19,19,When I check the phones memory, it says that most of the phone memory is taken up by "other"You can save photos, videos, and songs on the sd card.
B00COYOAYW,19,20,We just swapped out the SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,21,Well how come it is not working?I put the SIM card in, turn it on and the Maps app is empty.
B00COYOAYW,19,22,I previously owned a phone that utilized the larger SIM card; but, fortunately, the Lumia 521 included the new micro SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,23,I love the SD card expansion for video and music, only wish I could save apps to the SD card.Now how to unlock this thing to take out of the country
B00COYOAYW,19,24,Otherwise, you would need to activate the new SIM card which comes with the phone and that renders the old SIM card worthless.Contacts Import:Another fail.
B00COYOAYW,20,0,Received the phone on time and in working order.
B00COYOAYW,20,1,There is no warranty for this item.
B00COYOAYW,20,2,stop working within a month.
B00COYOAYW,20,3,to purchase another phone since could not get this phone to work.
B00COYOAYW,20,4,When asked to return or try and replace it I was told no and it was one day after the 30 day warranty this happened.
B00COYOAYW,20,5,I got this as a replacement phone.
B00COYOAYW,20,6,The phone stopped working less than 2 weeks after I received it.
B00COYOAYW,20,7,Be careful when you purchase this product.
B00COYOAYW,20,8,So I returned it.
B00COYOAYW,20,9,About ten days later, got a replacement with no back cover!
B00COYOAYW,20,10,I didn't do it for seven days straight, but after eight days or so, I had done this at least six times.
B00COYOAYW,20,11,Arrived on time.
B00COYOAYW,20,12,And I don't think there is any warranty after 30 days.
B00COYOAYW,20,13,from time to time getting stuck, .Have to turn it off to get it back.
B00COYOAYW,20,14,It took them a whole 6 days after I ordered to even ship the item.
B00COYOAYW,20,15,No time to wait!
B00COYOAYW,20,16,I ordered 2 of these phones and so far the other phone is working just fine.
B00COYOAYW,20,17,Unfortunately I was at work and got up to wait on a customer and when I returned the screen was lit but not on.
B00COYOAYW,20,18,My phone broken after used for 6 months
B00COYOAYW,20,19,It's broken after I used for 6 months.
B00COYOAYW,20,20,Would've returned it if I still have box it came in.
B00COYOAYW,20,21,Then the next week it completely stop working.
B00COYOAYW,20,22,The shipping and the product was fine.
B00COYOAYW,20,23,I am thinking the seller sent me a refurbished one.
B00COYOAYW,20,24,How do i return it?
B00COYOAYW,21,0,It will use Wi-Fi seamlessly to make phone calls - when my gf calls me over the Wi-Fi it still shows as her phone number calling.
B00COYOAYW,21,1,Don't count on t-mobile to unlock it.
B00COYOAYW,21,2,phone not unlocked.
B00COYOAYW,21,3,Then I called T-mobile customer support and they found that the settings was the problem.
B00COYOAYW,21,4,It was not the phone, it was the service provider.
B00COYOAYW,21,5,Not sure if it's T-Mobile or Nokia phone...service has become LOUSY!
B00COYOAYW,21,6,T-mobile wifi calling.*
B00COYOAYW,21,7,As much as I dislike the (apparently unfixable) problems with T-mobile's service, I hate T-mobile's attitude about it even more.
B00COYOAYW,21,8,My goal was to get it unlocked for use on AT&T.;
B00COYOAYW,21,9,unless wifi calling (wifi calling is free).
B00COYOAYW,21,10,I had set wi-fi calling as wi-fi only.
B00COYOAYW,21,11,No service even though it showed service in my area online at T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,21,12,We have German T-mobile and got sent between US and German T-mobile to figure out how to "unlock" etc.
B00COYOAYW,21,13,Nothing has worked.
B00COYOAYW,21,14,T-mobile stores said it is the problem with the phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,15,I got the same problem in the replacement and T-mobile stores could not fix the problem.
B00COYOAYW,21,16,Not sure if it's the device or T-Mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,21,17,To start with, I had problems with the phone as it would come-up with T-mobile and then no service.
B00COYOAYW,21,18,I called t-mobile to decode it, but they refused to do that.
B00COYOAYW,21,19,Let me state that I primarily use this phone with the Wi-Fi calling feature, as I do not have cell service at home.
B00COYOAYW,21,20,I contacted Nokia customer service.
B00COYOAYW,21,21,Also TMobile was if little help.
B00COYOAYW,21,22,a only draw back is lock phone; it's very hard to unlock this phone if you did not purchase from T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,21,23,I was told that I would be receiving a t-mobile phone and I received a Metro-PCS phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,24,Only T-Mobile has this service, and not all TMo phones can do it.
B00COYOAYW,22,0,I think its better, and faster than an android phone, no it is faster.
B00COYOAYW,22,1,That may be due to the 1GHz dual core processor, but it may also be due to not having dual band WiFi so I couldn't hook it up to my 5GHz WiFi router which is much faster than the 2.4GHz band.-
B00COYOAYW,22,2,the 4g speeds are faster than i expected for such a cheap phone .
B00COYOAYW,22,3,I've had the last 3 generations of Galaxy S devices, tried many of the Verizon Droid line devices (X, Droid, Droid2).
B00COYOAYW,22,4,Tried using a battery from an ATT 520 and that does not work either.
B00COYOAYW,22,5,I've had the last 3 generations of Galaxy S devices, tried many of the Verizon Droid line devices (X, Droid, Droid2).
B00COYOAYW,22,6,I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.
B00COYOAYW,22,7,That’s not necessary with the 521.The Lumia 521 doesn’t support LTE, but it still works with T-Mobile’s 4G HSPA network, and for such a budget device like this, that’s plenty.
B00COYOAYW,22,8,A lousy software design and mediocre hardware.
B00COYOAYW,22,9,A lousy software design and mediocre hardware.
B00COYOAYW,22,10,Its slow!
B00COYOAYW,22,11,I was replacing a TMobile (HTC) G2.
B00COYOAYW,22,12,All in all a really terrible and disappointing experience.
B00COYOAYW,22,13,It is more fluid than the nexus 4 and just as smooth as the iPhone 5S; it just goes to show how amazing the software is optimized.
B00COYOAYW,22,14,I already have two Android phones so certainly am in no need of buying a phone for myself, but it was time to upgrade my wife's old Android phone, which had become quite unreliable with frequent freeze-ups and other miscellaneous issues.
B00COYOAYW,22,15,It has exceeded my expectations in pretty much every way.Pros:- It has great hardware for the price, a dual core snapdragon processor and 512 mb of ram is nothing to scoff at in this price range.-Windows
B00COYOAYW,22,16,I use wi-fi when possible and it stays at 4G...I wanted to get the new IPhone 5...
B00COYOAYW,22,17,Great phone at an even better price.
B00COYOAYW,22,18,4G Rarely works.
B00COYOAYW,22,19,This phone does not work in 4G mode.
B00COYOAYW,22,20,4G speed and WiFi calling are topping on the cake.
B00COYOAYW,22,21,Two apps at a time bogs things down to where you don't want to use the device.
B00COYOAYW,22,22,You'll like it if you like WIN 8. it works smoothly and its fast.
B00COYOAYW,22,23,My perspective:I've owned iphone and android previously.
B00COYOAYW,22,24,First thing you have to do is that you have to avoid comparing this smartphone with higher end devices such as the Galaxy S4, HTC One, Iphone, or other Nokia Lumia devices.
B00COYOAYW,23,0,For the non-technical type, like myself, the instructions were impossible to follow.
B00COYOAYW,23,1,Easy to use phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,2,new to this type of phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,3,This phone was impossible to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,4,Impossible to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,5,I have nothing bad to say about the phone, it does every thing i need it to do.
B00COYOAYW,23,6,2 small things wrong..
B00COYOAYW,23,7,the keyboard does not react sometimes
B00COYOAYW,23,8,Although I think it's just that I have to get used to typing on an onscreen keyboard (I am coming from a physical one, though I have used swype on friends' phones).
B00COYOAYW,23,9,Its simple, easy to use, yet with all the modern uses a smart phone should have.
B00COYOAYW,23,10,I like the functionality of putting all the things commonly used on the start screen and a simple slide shows everything available on the device.
B00COYOAYW,23,11,It's very pretty to look at and easy access to all your apps.
B00COYOAYW,23,12,hate to imaging a fat fingered person typing on this thing.
B00COYOAYW,23,13,* For a phone with a 4" screen, it is not exactly small.
B00COYOAYW,23,14,Typing text messages is a breeze.
B00COYOAYW,23,15,Bad Luck????
B00COYOAYW,23,16,its real easy to use
B00COYOAYW,23,17,Almost every word I type.
B00COYOAYW,23,18,It works almost fine now I still have a few more things left to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,19,I changed the color scheme to yellow so that I could make out the words and numbers on the screen.
B00COYOAYW,23,20,This might be an isolated issue and my bad luck.
B00COYOAYW,23,21,Unlike Apple products, the virtual keyboard makes it clear when a letter is capitalized.Cons- Nowadays this phone is relatively mediocre- Call quality is ok- Touchscreen is somewhat touchy and the virtual keyboard can be difficult to use- The Wifi calling feature almost never works, and when it's on it interferes with texting- The biggest problem with it is that it's a Windows phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,22,then the exact same thing happend.
B00COYOAYW,23,23,Calling someone, real easy.Not a bad deal at all.
B00COYOAYW,23,24,You can really customize the phone to your liking (from the size of the tiles, the arrangement, the color, etc.) I can pin specific people to the start screen for quick access to call or text.
B00COYOAYW,24,0,After i press the power button, it shows "goodbye", then screen turn black.
B00COYOAYW,24,1,And a few times, the touch screen has become unresponsive.
B00COYOAYW,24,2,First, there're bubbles and lines under the screen film.
B00COYOAYW,24,3,I hit the power button on the side, and I got the screen that said slide down to power off - hurray for physical buttons - but touching the screen still produced no results.
B00COYOAYW,24,4,I've tried with turning off the screen while on the call - the same issue.
B00COYOAYW,24,5,Power button: It's on the side.
B00COYOAYW,24,6,Maybe the screen lock can be worked around.
B00COYOAYW,24,7,I don't like the way the phone calls are set up, I am use to missed, placed, dial, etc.
B00COYOAYW,24,8,The the screen would turn off even when  I am trying to call out and then the power/screen  button is intermitent working 3. the Speaker is really muffled and has a high tone level4.
B00COYOAYW,24,9,The problem is the buttons on the side of the phone are right there where I grab it, and I had accidently lowered the ring volume to zero.
B00COYOAYW,24,10,has only buttons for volume (up and down), on/off, and camera.
B00COYOAYW,24,11,The delete call option is actually easier and quicker to use than the options menu and buttons on the X2.
B00COYOAYW,24,12,Only locked up once but was able to hold power/lock button down and restart it.
B00COYOAYW,24,13,I like having the "back" button below the screen as it's always easy to find.
B00COYOAYW,24,14,everything is OK, but sometime the screen turn off automatically.
B00COYOAYW,24,15,volume buttons suck.
B00COYOAYW,24,16,There is not much that would work, tried a soft reset, turning on/off etc it would not work.
B00COYOAYW,24,17,I find it easiest to do by releasing the side opposite the power button first.
B00COYOAYW,24,18,It has a tendency to change settings inexplicably.
B00COYOAYW,24,19,Just flicking the screen sometmes will take you to a fb page that you havent seen before!
B00COYOAYW,24,20,There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time.
B00COYOAYW,24,21,If you miss the vibration or ring, then you don't know you got a text/call until the next time you turn the phone on.Sigh.
B00COYOAYW,24,22,watch the buttons on the side.
B00COYOAYW,24,23,The external buttons, especially the camera button, are just right.
B00COYOAYW,24,24,It did come in a timely manner.
B00COYOAYW,25,0,I use my phone, well, to make phone call and send text messages.
B00COYOAYW,25,1,It tries to send text and email messages ONCE and that's it.
B00COYOAYW,25,2,The phone is just used to call and text.
B00COYOAYW,25,3,It ok if you don't like picture messages.
B00COYOAYW,25,4,They need a phone for calls, texts, and checking their email.
B00COYOAYW,25,5,can't get on internet,can't access facebook,can't send pictures just not satified with it.
B00COYOAYW,25,6,It makes phone calls, allows me to send texts and so much more.
B00COYOAYW,25,7,We put an app named "Assistant" on it and it reads his email and texts for him too.
B00COYOAYW,25,8,I wanted a phone for wi-fi calling and no data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,9,Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.
B00COYOAYW,25,10,However this phone did make wi-fi calls and allow internet access without a data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,11,If you turn this on, you’ll be able to send and receive voice calls and text messages over any Wi-Fi network with enough bandwidth.
B00COYOAYW,25,12,Phone calls are clear and the phone also comes with Wi-Fi calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,13,unless wifi calling (wifi calling is free).
B00COYOAYW,25,14,The so-called wifi calling only gives you the option of making calls over your wifi but does not increase the quality of the call.
B00COYOAYW,25,15,She texts, reads some emails, uses the navigation, takes some pictures and makes phone calls.
B00COYOAYW,25,16,That means they are downloading every voice to text message you make, analysing it remotely and sending you back what they think you said.
B00COYOAYW,25,17,There is another for Limited Wi-Fi Connectivity and another for Data Roaming.WiFi works for me.
B00COYOAYW,25,18,T-mobile wifi calling.*
B00COYOAYW,25,19,Poor camera, can't get picture messages, crashes when people call me, nytimes app doesn't work if you don't have service at the time.
B00COYOAYW,25,20,it only sends and receives pictures when it wants to even if my 4g is on and working with my other apps.
B00COYOAYW,25,21,Internet is just a bonus, fortunately.
B00COYOAYW,25,22,I do not have any access to the internet, I cannot download any apps.
B00COYOAYW,25,23,As I am not a gamer, I only use the phone for phone calls, text messaging, checking emails and browsing the web while not near my PC, and taking casual photos while my camera is not around.
B00COYOAYW,25,24,wifi calling keeps taking over at home and prevents multimedia messaging.other
B004T36GCU,0,0,Small and easy to carry with one hand.
B004T36GCU,0,1,Love this phone as it has so many funcitons and features I can use.
B004T36GCU,0,2,A very nice HTC phone with a beautiful screen that, unfortunately, didn't work for me.
B004T36GCU,0,3,It has scratches on the screen and on the camera.
B004T36GCU,0,4,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,0,5,Camera is awesome, and the size is great.
B004T36GCU,0,6,Not all carrier features may be supported.Ultra-fast, 4G-enabled smartphone running Android 2.2 with 4.3-inch multi-touch Super LCD display."Instead,
B004T36GCU,0,7,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,0,8,Even with a 780p display, the colors are vivid with the S-LCD screen.*Conclusion*A
B004T36GCU,0,9,This phone, simply put, is not worth it's weight in plastic.
B004T36GCU,0,10,Phone was never dropped, in a hard protective case from day 1, screen protector from day 1 and now less than 6 months later the phone itself will not charge the battery.
B004T36GCU,0,11,The texting is incredibly glitchy as well; mis-types, and buttons not functioning the same way all the time make this phone a better paper weight.
B004T36GCU,0,12,THE PHONE IS PHYSICALLY BEAUTIFUL.
B004T36GCU,0,13,Picture messages not working, there is no reception at some places and some calls are drope out, the battery runs out fast but the video recording is clear and great
B004T36GCU,0,14,This is a cool samrt phone and the price is just as great.
B004T36GCU,0,15,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,0,16,Because it has 8 megapixels I was expected the camera to be sharp with great resolution.
B004T36GCU,0,17,OVERALL: I love the weight of the phone (not as light as some others which is good since I like to keep my phone for a few years).
B004T36GCU,0,18,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,0,19,battery finish too fast.
B004T36GCU,0,20,There is a lot of dust trapped between the camera lens and the cover glass, resulting in grainy pictures.
B004T36GCU,0,21,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,0,22,Easier said then done if you have a hard plastic case like I did, until I had to remove it so many times to get to the battery.-
B004T36GCU,0,23,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,0,24,When i ordered this phone i heard a lot of good reviews about it.
B004T36GCU,1,0,But, unbeknownst to me, some apps can cause blockers.
B004T36GCU,1,1,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,1,2,good.
B004T36GCU,1,3,The Google Play market is perfection, the speed of downloading apps is pretty remarkable, too.
B004T36GCU,1,4,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,1,5,I can not download games that i would like to play, such as plants vs zombies 2 and it losses the signal very easy
B004T36GCU,1,6,It's also my first smart phone I've owned, and I'm pretty biased towards the Android market; I have no plans of ever owning an iPhone.
B004T36GCU,1,7,I am with T-Mobile and could not have all the apps.
B004T36GCU,1,8,there are many fantastic apps you can get for these phones and it's far less restricted from apple's market from what I understand.
B004T36GCU,1,9,The main thing I used this phone for was music.
B004T36GCU,1,10,very confusing to operate and has no gps on it that I could find.
B004T36GCU,1,11,I wish I knew which apps caused it.
B004T36GCU,1,12,It drops service when I am googling or doing something else,  i.e. using navigation or other application.
B004T36GCU,1,13,I am somewhat of a rookie when it comes to smartphones so am not the best critic, but there is a lot with this phone that I'm not happy with.
B004T36GCU,1,14,GPS is dead and it is not being recognized with any navigation app (google map, waze, gps status, etc) Nothing!!!
B004T36GCU,1,15,This phone has one of the biggest screens on the market right now, which is great if you surf the web mainly on your phone.
B004T36GCU,1,16,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,1,17,The phone works good, but I have a problem finding some applications and widgets I use to have...-
B004T36GCU,1,18,I think the team is good, have not much experience in this world of the smart phone, but it is well fluid've seen from HTC.The only thing I dislike about this is the time duration of the battery is exhausted soon.Another thing I do not like is that the screen is very dirty .....I give it three stars ......regards....
B004T36GCU,1,19,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,1,20,The ones I normally see are stars and the only way to delete them is to rid of the app itself.-For
B004T36GCU,1,21,the battery can cause panic for some because I've found that your pictures, videos and music will vanish and the only way to make them visible is to remove the battery AND restart your phone.
B004T36GCU,1,22,The phoen ia a great phone applications are A+ everything works well.
B004T36GCU,1,23,It has 768 MB of RAM, the more RAM; The more stuff you can do at one time [Multiple Tabs on the Internet, Playing a game while talking, having 30 apps open, etc.].
B004T36GCU,1,24,Unfortunately, the phone did not come with a battery, so I had to buy one before I could find out if it worked.
B004T36GCU,2,0,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,2,1,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,2,2,not such a great smartphone.
B004T36GCU,2,3,Good product.
B004T36GCU,2,4,Not all that great!
B004T36GCU,2,5,NOT VERY GOOD PRODUCT.
B004T36GCU,2,6,I am somewhat of a rookie when it comes to smartphones so am not the best critic, but there is a lot with this phone that I'm not happy with.
B004T36GCU,2,7,I wish I have never purchased it and would not recommend it.
B004T36GCU,2,8,nice cellphone but.
B004T36GCU,2,9,So I bought the phone hoping I was going to be able to write a good review but it comes as if I only have a few nice things to say.
B004T36GCU,2,10,When i purchased this phone i didnt expect it to be like this.
B004T36GCU,2,11,I bought this phone because it was a great deal.
B004T36GCU,2,12,GREAT JOB, Amazon.
B004T36GCU,2,13,Best phone ever - or not!
B004T36GCU,2,14,If your looking a good priced phone at a low cost--this is a nice one... Just look out for the battery problem, the price to ship back to the supplier and wait for the refund was just not worth the hassle...
B004T36GCU,2,15,When I bought this phone it was good, now it has problems and I can't get a replacement because of the time that I had the phone.
B004T36GCU,2,16,=(ALL of that being said, this phone has it quirks but honestly, I don't regret buying it, I got a good deal on it and it has really helped launch me into the "smart" world.
B004T36GCU,2,17,Phone is ok for the price....
B004T36GCU,2,18,i bought 3 cellphones HTC A9192, i bought them three months ago for 190$, i thinks that was expensive.. there is other cellphone better for the price i paid.but the screen of this cellphone and the exterior quality is good... i recomend it.In venezuela this cellphone runs 3G H+... this model is for AT&T;3G 1900 mhz
B004T36GCU,2,19,Not the most bang for your buck.
B004T36GCU,2,20,It was purchased while a broken iphone was being replaced, so didn't get a ton of use.
B004T36GCU,2,21,Overall I think my lesson is to try a phone out first before purchasing when at all possible.
B004T36GCU,2,22,It's also my first smart phone I've owned, and I'm pretty biased towards the Android market; I have no plans of ever owning an iPhone.
B004T36GCU,2,23,A couple of friends of mine had it and loved it, so I decided to get it.
B004T36GCU,2,24,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,3,0,Other phones that I have owned, the battery life had lasted me 3 or 4 days.
B004T36GCU,3,1,Phone would not charge after first day of use.
B004T36GCU,3,2,Battery issues.
B004T36GCU,3,3,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,3,4,battery life on lasted 6 hours from a full charge with minimal use.
B004T36GCU,3,5,Battery Problems.
B004T36GCU,3,6,battery wasn't good and got replaced.
B004T36GCU,3,7,Still discovering features.Battery life is only good for a day.
B004T36GCU,3,8,And the battery is terrible, barely lasts a day after charging.
B004T36GCU,3,9,I did not rate battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,10,The battery does not keep charge as long as it supposed to be.
B004T36GCU,3,11,Because others said their phone was good.
B004T36GCU,3,12,Great Phone but Batt Life sucks.
B004T36GCU,3,13,Great phone ,fast arrival, working good and everything but not new.
B004T36GCU,3,14,So when I got there we discovered that the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,3,15,I think I might have loved this phone but the battery would not stay charged even to try it out and the battery  had to be removed every time to  switch it on, so I am afraid I had to return it.
B004T36GCU,3,16,The time of charge is low, when I use wifi i have only 4 hours and when I talk 8 hours, but I don't talk continuos.
B004T36GCU,3,17,too slow phone dont buy it and battery finish in 6 or 7 hour you have too charge too many time
B004T36GCU,3,18,Battery life is about 3/4 of a day with normal use.
B004T36GCU,3,19,After some time with this phone I discovered that its battery life is close to nominal.
B004T36GCU,3,20,Not good for anything else.
B004T36GCU,3,21,battery finish too fast.
B004T36GCU,3,22,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,3,23,With the wifi, bluetooth, and all other apps closed the battery maybe would last 4 hours.
B004T36GCU,3,24,So I bought it anyway hoping I would get a good one.
B004T36GCU,4,0,good.
B004T36GCU,4,1,Not good for anything else.
B004T36GCU,4,2,Non-working earpiece speaker.
B004T36GCU,4,3,Again, ok for just making calls.
B004T36GCU,4,4,Ok for just a phone to make and take calls.
B004T36GCU,4,5,Anyhow, the phone works fine.
B004T36GCU,4,6,Good phone, false advertised as new.
B004T36GCU,4,7,But it's very clear that it's not fresh from the factory.
B004T36GCU,4,8,The phone works fine but i can see the guts of the phone while am using it.
B004T36GCU,4,9,you would have yourself an excellent phone.
B004T36GCU,4,10,Great phone ,fast arrival, working good and everything but not new.
B004T36GCU,4,11,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,4,12,Like i said the phone works all to well, i was pretty impressed however the above mention problems bugged me.
B004T36GCU,4,13,First off the phone came without the 8g sd card that it said it came with, Thank goodness I bought a 32g card when i bought the phone.
B004T36GCU,4,14,OK. Make sure you buy a case with this phone; the housing started stripping the same day I got the phone...which by the way came opened  and seems to have been used already...the speaker is POOR!!.. but when the headphones are in its ok.
B004T36GCU,4,15,Picture messages not working, there is no reception at some places and some calls are drope out, the battery runs out fast but the video recording is clear and great
B004T36GCU,4,16,Camera is awesome, and the size is great.
B004T36GCU,4,17,When I bought this phone it was good, now it has problems and I can't get a replacement because of the time that I had the phone.
B004T36GCU,4,18,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,4,19,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,4,20,Not the best!
B004T36GCU,4,21,A very nice HTC phone with a beautiful screen that, unfortunately, didn't work for me.
B004T36GCU,4,22,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,4,23,Not a good buy.
B004T36GCU,4,24,battery wasn't good and got replaced.
B004T36GCU,5,0,The camera is also very blurry, unlike the one I had before.
B004T36GCU,5,1,Great camera
B004T36GCU,5,2,The battery life is abysmal, and the camera is lacking.
B004T36GCU,5,3,Because others said their phone was good.
B004T36GCU,5,4,Features , reception.
B004T36GCU,5,5,This is a cool samrt phone and the price is just as great.
B004T36GCU,5,6,This is a pretty decent phone for a back up.
B004T36GCU,5,7,Picture messages not working, there is no reception at some places and some calls are drope out, the battery runs out fast but the video recording is clear and great
B004T36GCU,5,8,Because it has 8 megapixels I was expected the camera to be sharp with great resolution.
B004T36GCU,5,9,It has scratches on the screen and on the camera.
B004T36GCU,5,10,Camera is awesome, and the size is great.
B004T36GCU,5,11,Good product.
B004T36GCU,5,12,camera is capable of taking breath taking pictures, it's the equivalent of having a digital camera in itself.
B004T36GCU,5,13,You can do video calls on this phone but it does not have a front facing camera so you have to turn the phone to the backside so the person you are talking to can see you.What a disappointment because the main purpose for buying the phone was to save money on international calls by using Skype or other free video calls.
B004T36GCU,5,14,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,5,15,So when I got there we discovered that the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,5,16,The pictures are very blury!
B004T36GCU,5,17,battery wasn't good and got replaced.
B004T36GCU,5,18,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,5,19,3 stars.
B004T36GCU,5,20,ok. this isn't quite what I was expecting .
B004T36GCU,5,21,It was easy to customize and visually appealing, which is pretty standard for HTC products.
B004T36GCU,5,22,Still discovering features.Battery life is only good for a day.
B004T36GCU,5,23,i like it and it has no problems but the problem is it does not have a front facing camera so i cant skype my family anymore but i love htc its the best.
B004T36GCU,5,24,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,6,0,No micro sd card.
B004T36GCU,6,1,First off the phone came without the 8g sd card that it said it came with, Thank goodness I bought a 32g card when i bought the phone.
B004T36GCU,6,2,It works just fine.
B004T36GCU,6,3,Anyhow, the phone works fine.
B004T36GCU,6,4,The phone works fine but i can see the guts of the phone while am using it.
B004T36GCU,6,5,SD Card issues.
B004T36GCU,6,6,When I first got the phone and then got my sim chip to work in it the phone was amazing.
B004T36GCU,6,7,No matter which one we used, no micro SD card would work on this phone, which is sad because a good majority of the phone's functions need one.
B004T36GCU,6,8,The phoen ia a great phone applications are A+ everything works well.
B004T36GCU,6,9,However i checked on Gsm areana it says phone came with 8gm memory card i never got one.
B004T36GCU,6,10,Because others said their phone was good.
B004T36GCU,6,11,ever since I inserted my sim card I have not been able to browse unless I use the WIFI...which I think is not the best ...please show me how to fix it or I return the phonethanks
B004T36GCU,6,12,you have to be very very careful when you take the cover off to put in the SIM card or you will bend the casing and it will break easy.
B004T36GCU,6,13,So now it works fine however the casing is very very flimsy.
B004T36GCU,6,14,And cant seem to read the sim card at times.
B004T36GCU,6,15,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,6,16,Whenever I wanted to take a picture, it kept asking me to insert an SD card when in fact it was already inserted so I had to keep opening and reinserting until the phone recognized the card.
B004T36GCU,6,17,Take your time in taking off the cover for the battery also it is hard to remove.
B004T36GCU,6,18,Great phone ,fast arrival, working good and everything but not new.
B004T36GCU,6,19,I have some problems with the product.First i didn't receive the sd card and the charger is not working properly
B004T36GCU,6,20,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,6,21,(Seller called me and informed unlocked phones do not come with the 8GB micro SD card.)this is not a show stopper as micro SD cards are available cheap but if I had known earlier I would have ordered the card along with the phone.
B004T36GCU,6,22,The orderinstant(USA) unit has a broken SD card memory slot that doesn't eject cards, you have to dig it out with a fingernail or screwdriver.
B004T36GCU,6,23,We had to order & pay for another battery from a store in St Lucia.
B004T36GCU,6,24,In the description it says:"This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
B004T36GCU,7,0,i want to order one but i'm not sure if it will work good there.
B004T36GCU,7,1,Also I have interruption while talking, and this is all the time.
B004T36GCU,7,2,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,7,3,Great phone ,fast arrival, working good and everything but not new.
B004T36GCU,7,4,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,7,5,Due to unforseen weather conditions, it did not arrive on time.
B004T36GCU,7,6,The Phone I received was not new.
B004T36GCU,7,7,I ordered this phone because I already had one before and loved it.
B004T36GCU,7,8,Buy one of these and it came to me with a damaged Battery and to buy a new tube, except that I delayed the order several times.
B004T36GCU,7,9,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,7,10,Not all that great!
B004T36GCU,7,11,i received item and the battery was not working i sent an email to the buyer, he right away sent me another one, even though its not working properly but i think its good for the price
B004T36GCU,7,12,the item i received.
B004T36GCU,7,13,Other wise it works great!
B004T36GCU,7,14,Not recommended at all.
B004T36GCU,7,15,Would probably look for something else next time
B004T36GCU,7,16,Took in to my phone carrier--they said it had water damage before I received it.
B004T36GCU,7,17,Item not it A-1 condition.
B004T36GCU,7,18,Well it arrived on time, but it arrived with a non working earpiece speaker, i'm not in the US and it seemed like a hassle so instead of returning the item I'm buying the replacement earpiece and replacing it myself..its simple to do.
B004T36GCU,7,19,So I bought it anyway hoping I would get a good one.
B004T36GCU,7,20,I wish I have never purchased it and would not recommend it.
B004T36GCU,7,21,but overall great seller and awesome phone.
B004T36GCU,7,22,I never dropped a single one, and took great care of them.
B004T36GCU,7,23,The minute I cupped my hand around the back of the phone, as you would when talking on the phone, the signal would drop significantly.
B004T36GCU,7,24,Needless to say, about 4 out of 10 calls I recieve wind up coming through the VoIP line - which means it missed the original call.
B004T36GCU,8,0,Service at Home.
B004T36GCU,8,1,and services.
B004T36GCU,8,2,good customer service.
B004T36GCU,8,3,I have no service in most areas.
B004T36GCU,8,4,it's an at&t; phone , and it's says that works on T-mobile carrier too.but,
B004T36GCU,8,5,T-Mobile...uh no!
B004T36GCU,8,6,What are the Networks Supported?
B004T36GCU,8,7,Phone is ok but it was a AT&T; phone.
B004T36GCU,8,8,NOT ALL FEATURES WORK.
B004T36GCU,8,9,Good for certain Cell company.
B004T36GCU,8,10,the phone was good not the seller.
B004T36GCU,8,11,If you are in an area with spotty service this phone doesnt work for some reason.
B004T36GCU,8,12,Thank for your help.
B004T36GCU,8,13,Need a help.
B004T36GCU,8,14,I have very little service bars in my house, and even then there is an "E" where there should be 3G at the very lease.
B004T36GCU,8,15,That way people can tell if this phone will work on their network.Something like this would be great,Network:HSPA+ 850/1900 MHzGSM/GPRS/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 MHzNow I pulled this from the HTC At&t; page, but that doesn't mean this is what this phone is.
B004T36GCU,8,16,I bought this phone with the understanding that T-Mobile would work just fine on it.
B004T36GCU,8,17,The phone is basically for AT&T; services which I don't have.
B004T36GCU,8,18,My last Tmobile phone had issues too, I'll be dropping Tmobile once my contract is up and switching to a network that has Iphone.
B004T36GCU,8,19,The problem is, when I pick up the phone, the signal drops to either one bar or it shows no service.
B004T36GCU,8,20,In the description it says:"This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
B004T36GCU,8,21,Due to the fact this was an AT&T; phone the HOTSPOT feature WILL NOT WORK with any other carrier.
B004T36GCU,8,22,BEWARE if you use T Mobil or anything other the AT&T;
B004T36GCU,8,23,Was never unlocked, I had to get my own unlock code.
B004T36GCU,8,24,I contacted ATT thinking it was a system setting they could assist with (fail) called T-mobile and they provided great troubleshooting.
B004T36GCU,9,0,Ovserbation on the use of a HTC A9192 Inspire 4G unlocked Phone.
B004T36GCU,9,1,Shipped very fast!
B004T36GCU,9,2,It was great while it lasted, but maybe it's just HTC.
B004T36GCU,9,3,It has lots of RAM, a fast processor, and a great camera in good lighting.I've owned three HTC Inspires in less than 9 months.
B004T36GCU,9,4,first off i must say the htc inspire 4g is an awesome phone .
B004T36GCU,9,5,It is incredibly slow for the processor it has.
B004T36GCU,9,6,Camera is awesome, and the size is great.
B004T36GCU,9,7,The storage is less than 2 GB.
B004T36GCU,9,8,Almost never see 4G, just an 'E' and do not know what that means.
B004T36GCU,9,9,This was an ATT HTC inspire phone which is unlocked, The phone overall looks/works in good shape for now, but there are certain aspects which concern me.- the VOID sticker which is present on my HTC inspire (which I had got directly from ATT is missing on this one).
B004T36GCU,9,10,Great phone ,fast arrival, working good and everything but not new.
B004T36GCU,9,11,If you can't be satisfied with Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), you'll want to skip this phone.
B004T36GCU,9,12,Other wise it works great!
B004T36GCU,9,13,This is absolutely frustrating.I used to love HTC phones, I even liked HTC One X but now I will never go with HTC again.
B004T36GCU,9,14,The shipping was faster than what was estimated so that was a plus!
B004T36GCU,9,15,I wanted a bigger phone, with a better camera....that was also unlocked.
B004T36GCU,9,16,My first smart phone was a Droid Incredible, so I thought this would be a good choice.
B004T36GCU,9,17,but overall great seller and awesome phone.
B004T36GCU,9,18,The texting is incredibly glitchy as well; mis-types, and buttons not functioning the same way all the time make this phone a better paper weight.
B004T36GCU,9,19,A9192 Inspire 4G Unlocked Phone with Android OS, 3G Support, 8 MP) .
B004T36GCU,9,20,my htc inspire 4g unlocked.
B004T36GCU,9,21,Personally, I'm not satisfied with a phone that is that picky about where I hold it.For the more adventurous who consider rooting their phone and trying to upgrade the Android OS, this is not a phone to choose.
B004T36GCU,9,22,The process to get the phone rooted is so complex that I gave up considering it.
B004T36GCU,9,23,For the price and its touted features, it falls vastly short of other products which will deliver a much more enjoyable experience.
B004T36GCU,9,24,I think the team is good, have not much experience in this world of the smart phone, but it is well fluid've seen from HTC.The only thing I dislike about this is the time duration of the battery is exhausted soon.Another thing I do not like is that the screen is very dirty .....I give it three stars ......regards....
B004T36GCU,10,0,Love this phone as it has so many funcitons and features I can use.
B004T36GCU,10,1,I love to have that phone.
B004T36GCU,10,2,I love this phone.
B004T36GCU,10,3,Love...at first.
B004T36GCU,10,4,I love this phone.
B004T36GCU,10,5,NOT ALL FEATURES WORK.
B004T36GCU,10,6,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,10,7,I do love this phone, but having issues.
B004T36GCU,10,8,My kids love it for the easy to manouvre
B004T36GCU,10,9,The phone looks good.
B004T36GCU,10,10,All other features work well and the phone has a nice layout.
B004T36GCU,10,11,It gets the job done and easy to figure out.
B004T36GCU,10,12,It's nice and simple.
B004T36GCU,10,13,nice and simple.
B004T36GCU,10,14,Easy to use, looks nice, no issues.
B004T36GCU,10,15,Extremely well packaged!! Absolutely love it!UPDATE: I loved this phone for the first 2-3 months.
B004T36GCU,10,16,It works just fine.
B004T36GCU,10,17,Great phone ,fast arrival, working good and everything but not new.
B004T36GCU,10,18,It was great while it lasted, but maybe it's just HTC.
B004T36GCU,10,19,Beautiful pics and downloads easy.
B004T36GCU,10,20,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,10,21,Less bars than my Blackberry or my wife's Nokia flip phone.
B004T36GCU,10,22,pretty phone but it sucks.
B004T36GCU,10,23,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,10,24,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,11,0,When i ordered this phone i heard a lot of good reviews about it.
B004T36GCU,11,1,A good phone with low ringing tone.
B004T36GCU,11,2,Great camera
B004T36GCU,11,3,Phone is too square for me, I prefer taller and skinny easier to hold.
B004T36GCU,11,4,also i got a note on the box saying "we have gone green click on the link below to get user manual.. are you serious? a user manual?
B004T36GCU,11,5,If you can learn to hold this phone only near the top of the case, it will work.
B004T36GCU,11,6,Just an average design.
B004T36GCU,11,7,I've had it for a few weeks now and I have no complaints.
B004T36GCU,11,8,The top mounted power on/off button requires a large amount of force to push it in to get the phone to see the button press.There was a 12 volt car charger adapter in the box, which was not ever included in a new shrink-wrapped box.
B004T36GCU,11,9,I can't even use this app on this phone I just purchased because I can't change the language settings to english (us) or (uk).
B004T36GCU,11,10,Also since this was used, it has some instances when it just hangs and forecloses all the apps.
B004T36GCU,11,11,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,11,12,when I attempt to type a new url in the browser, instead of the "enter" triangle-shaped button, it gives me the refresh button and i literally cannot go to the new website.
B004T36GCU,11,13,The user's guide describes the GSM antenna as being in the bottom cover that covers the sim slot.
B004T36GCU,11,14,The phone is slow and some times the plastic cover at the back side of bottom cames out when you try to take out from your pocket.
B004T36GCU,11,15,I am somewhat of a rookie when it comes to smartphones so am not the best critic, but there is a lot with this phone that I'm not happy with.
B004T36GCU,11,16,HTC Inspire Unlocked 4G HSPA+ GSM Touch Android Smartphone (AT&T;, Black) Good Phone..  HTC Must learn  how to design the SIM SLOT and Back Covers..on this Phone.. SIM Solts jammed on Brand New Phone... Back Covers does not close with out gaps.
B004T36GCU,11,17,The phoen ia a great phone applications are A+ everything works well.
B004T36GCU,11,18,After some experimentation, I found that I could hold the phone near the top of the case and the signal would be usable.
B004T36GCU,11,19,The phone works ok but after half hr to an hr it shuts off an im unable to power it on back using the power button therefore I have take out the battery to power it on .
B004T36GCU,11,20,With that said, there are a few minor things that I have no doubt HTC will be able to upgrade in the future.-Sometimes,
B004T36GCU,11,21,I ordered this phone because I already had one before and loved it.
B004T36GCU,11,22,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,11,23,For instance, it sometimes switches in the middle of a conversation to another party or disconnects entirely.
B004T36GCU,11,24,I'm not so happy with this phone, but it's okay.
B004T36GCU,12,0,Buy a T-mobile phone, it will save you money and a headache.
B004T36GCU,12,1,Don't waste your money.
B004T36GCU,12,2,I don't wanna pay for a real expensive data plan and I don't use internet too much, but like to have it when I'm out and in a wifi zone.
B004T36GCU,12,3,I liked the phone until the wifi stopped working after 3 months for no reason.
B004T36GCU,12,4,T-Mobile...uh no!
B004T36GCU,12,5,Making it nearly impossible to download anything or make calls or text.
B004T36GCU,12,6,Unable to receive/send pictures and unable to use internet due to not truly unlocked....phone wants to use at&t; internet and data but I have tmobile
B004T36GCU,12,7,Hard to read, text and mail not organized very well.
B004T36GCU,12,8,why cant i browse using my mobile network data?
B004T36GCU,12,9,With that being said...not a happy buyer!Also I've been using the speaker phone during calls and many people have difficulty hearing.Was unable to send multi-media messages.
B004T36GCU,12,10,incoming call are forwarded directly to the voice mail.
B004T36GCU,12,11,It is glitchy, constantly turning itself off in the middle of browsing, texting, or videos.
B004T36GCU,12,12,The wifi is the reason I wanted to get a new phone.
B004T36GCU,12,13,some reason, although I have all of my contacts from facebook on my phone, many of their profile pictures wont show up beside their name or pop up when they call.
B004T36GCU,12,14,This phone has one of the biggest screens on the market right now, which is great if you surf the web mainly on your phone.
B004T36GCU,12,15,Also I have interruption while talking, and this is all the time.
B004T36GCU,12,16,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,12,17,This phone will not allow me to access the T-Mobile data network.
B004T36GCU,12,18,BATTERY SUCKS!!! WIFI DOESNT WORK!!!! WASTE OF $$ DONT BUY.
B004T36GCU,12,19,Froze multiple times a day (especially when I went between data & wifi).
B004T36GCU,12,20,My last Tmobile phone had issues too, I'll be dropping Tmobile once my contract is up and switching to a network that has Iphone.
B004T36GCU,12,21,When I started using the phone, a lot of things weren't functioning like picture text, no internet connection even when there is a wifi service to connect to, sometimes the phone will automatically cancel my calls & voicemails, very  very slow internet service, social networks wont log in and host of other problems.
B004T36GCU,12,22,question. is anybody know of this phone work outside of America, like in Europe?
B004T36GCU,12,23,EVEN AT THAT, IT DOES NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH WI-FI SERVICE, EVEN THOUGH THE WI-FI IS VERY STRONG AND OTHER PHONES CONNECT PERFECTLY.
B004T36GCU,12,24,Not the best.
B004T36GCU,13,0,It seemed like the phone had been thrown in there, with a slightly off-set screen protector, slightly dusty too.Was it new?
B004T36GCU,13,1,Even with a 780p display, the colors are vivid with the S-LCD screen.*Conclusion*A
B004T36GCU,13,2,A very nice HTC phone with a beautiful screen that, unfortunately, didn't work for me.
B004T36GCU,13,3,THE PHONE IS NICE.
B004T36GCU,13,4,It was sopoussed to be phones working perfectly
B004T36GCU,13,5,Unfortunately, the phone did not come with a battery, so I had to buy one before I could find out if it worked.
B004T36GCU,13,6,I have problems with this phone I bought on February 15.
B004T36GCU,13,7,Poor accessories, and missing accessories.
B004T36GCU,13,8,I have problems with this phone.
B004T36GCU,13,9,Very disappointed, I feel cheated.
B004T36GCU,13,10,There is a lot of dust trapped between the camera lens and the cover glass, resulting in grainy pictures.
B004T36GCU,13,11,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,13,12,Phone was never dropped, in a hard protective case from day 1, screen protector from day 1 and now less than 6 months later the phone itself will not charge the battery.
B004T36GCU,13,13,I feel like I was conned into buying this phone.
B004T36GCU,13,14,Revised review - Nice phone.
B004T36GCU,13,15,Two phones has scratches, and sometimes turn off.plus is quite slow during use.
B004T36GCU,13,16,But last week while the phone was loaded heated at a temperature too high, it was impossible to touch the high temperature that had.
B004T36GCU,13,17,But I'd like a BIG problem solved.
B004T36GCU,13,18,It has scratches on the screen and on the camera.
B004T36GCU,13,19,I've gone an entire day without touching it and come back at the end of the day and its in the yellow.
B004T36GCU,13,20,HTC used sent instead of new. the phone sent to me was used, while I paid for new, no manual, charger very dirty, scratches on the screen.
B004T36GCU,13,21,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,13,22,The back camera is not mounted centered behind the lens glass, partly obstructed by the lens frame of the back cover.
B004T36GCU,13,23,If this was listed as a refurb with associated price the problems would have been acceptable.
B004T36GCU,13,24,Somehow this fell into the box, but was not listed in the seller's listing.Luckily the rest of the hardware works normally, the battery is fine, and the screen is perfect.
B004T36GCU,14,0,GPS doesn't work.
B004T36GCU,14,1,The updates.
B004T36GCU,14,2,this phone is unable to download certain apps in the play store.
B004T36GCU,14,3,Once certain apps get downloaded the phone starts to freeze like it has too many cookies or a small virus on it.
B004T36GCU,14,4,GPS is dead and it is not being recognized with any navigation app (google map, waze, gps status, etc) Nothing!!!
B004T36GCU,14,5,Updates majorly slow this phone down.
B004T36GCU,14,6,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,14,7,It has 768 MB of RAM, the more RAM; The more stuff you can do at one time [Multiple Tabs on the Internet, Playing a game while talking, having 30 apps open, etc.].
B004T36GCU,14,8,Support? GPS became useless after the AT&T; update to 2.3 there is no further updating for this phone.There are hacked updates that lose functionality of things like the video recording and what not,but what's the point in that.
B004T36GCU,14,9,Too many software issues.
B004T36GCU,14,10,The biggest problem is that it likes to freeze during using the navigation and while making calls.
B004T36GCU,14,11,Was unable to delete pre loaded apps to free up space, wasn't able to open attachments either.
B004T36GCU,14,12,My "maps" application also bugged out on me after about 6 months.
B004T36GCU,14,13,Not to mention  all of the service updates it  needs..  Annoying
B004T36GCU,14,14,With the wifi, bluetooth, and all other apps closed the battery maybe would last 4 hours.
B004T36GCU,14,15,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,14,16,It came with a bad battery..  Took it  to a  cellphone  battery store,  and $45  later it was finally working properly..
B004T36GCU,14,17,BEWARE: THIS PHONE HAS NO OFFICIAL SUPPORT ANYMORE; that's right- after 2.3.5, no more Android Versions.
B004T36GCU,14,18,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,14,19,The phone works good, but I have a problem finding some applications and widgets I use to have...-
B004T36GCU,14,20,I sold this phone and got a windows phone.
B004T36GCU,14,21,This phone has been a major frustration though I've had it for only a year.
B004T36GCU,14,22,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,14,23,I think the team is good, have not much experience in this world of the smart phone, but it is well fluid've seen from HTC.The only thing I dislike about this is the time duration of the battery is exhausted soon.Another thing I do not like is that the screen is very dirty .....I give it three stars ......regards....
B004T36GCU,14,24,After some time with this phone I discovered that its battery life is close to nominal.
B004T36GCU,15,0,I've had the phone for about 2 months now.
B004T36GCU,15,1,I bought this phone because it was a great deal.
B004T36GCU,15,2,It didn't work for me so I don't recommend it.
B004T36GCU,15,3,Not a good buy.
B004T36GCU,15,4,When I bought this phone it was good, now it has problems and I can't get a replacement because of the time that I had the phone.
B004T36GCU,15,5,Had to buy another one.
B004T36GCU,15,6,I wouldnt buy it again.
B004T36GCU,15,7,I wish I have never purchased it and would not recommend it.
B004T36GCU,15,8,I don't think I will be purchasing anything else from Amazon.
B004T36GCU,15,9,I did NOT buy it off of Amazon.
B004T36GCU,15,10,I like it but it'll only last two years...
B004T36GCU,15,11,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,15,12,Maybe I shouldn't have bought a used phone because this is my 1st time buying a used phone & the experience isn't good at all.
B004T36GCU,15,13,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,15,14,I know most people replace a phone every couple of years, but I was hoping for another year of use.
B004T36GCU,15,15,So short, and the phone increases its temperature so high.I don't recommend to buy it...
B004T36GCU,15,16,i am disappointed.
B004T36GCU,15,17,Not great but not that bad.
B004T36GCU,15,18,Only to keep it or return it for my money back.
B004T36GCU,15,19,I have bought a few other things on amazon and this carrier and phone has done nothing but stress me out.
B004T36GCU,15,20,It's a waste of money.
B004T36GCU,15,21,Wasn't worth my money.
B004T36GCU,15,22,I writting from venezuelan, i worried because i buyed this phone Unlocked but i have a friend's that buyed a Galaxy Unlocked and can't use with any operator i'm reading i think that i needed buy a Unlocked International Phone, any recommendations?
B004T36GCU,15,23,Unlocked phone.
B004T36GCU,15,24,PHONE ALWAYS HOTTHE WIFI NEVER WORKED: I BOUGHT THE PHONE MAINLY FOR ITS PORTABLE HOTSPOT WHICH DOESNT WORK PLUS 4G WHICH IS THE ONLY BENEFIT IVE GOT FOR THE MONEY IVE WASTED ON AN AWEFUL PRODUCT.
B004T36GCU,16,0,stupid battery life.the
B004T36GCU,16,1,Battery wasn't working.
B004T36GCU,16,2,The battery lasts for 4 hours...
B004T36GCU,16,3,Battery life is about 3/4 of a day with normal use.
B004T36GCU,16,4,Battery issue.
B004T36GCU,16,5,The phone freezes all the time so i have to take the battery out to unfreeze it.
B004T36GCU,16,6,Battery removal is akin to medical surgery.
B004T36GCU,16,7,I placed in the battery and put the phone to charge, but it then shut off and would not come on at all.
B004T36GCU,16,8,Am having battery problem. the battery does not last not even 3 hours straight i have to be keep charging the phone
B004T36GCU,16,9,BATTERY ISSUES.
B004T36GCU,16,10,FULLY CHARGED BATTERY DOES NOT LAST UP TO 24H RS, EXCEPT IF YOU DO NOT USE THE PHONE AT ALL.2.
B004T36GCU,16,11,stop working proberly after a month.
B004T36GCU,16,12,PRODUCT DOES NOT KEEP A CHARGE AND I HAVE REPLACES THE BATTERY.
B004T36GCU,16,13,The particular one you sent to me was not charging when I plugged it to the electricity.
B004T36GCU,16,14,The battery does not last very long and the power cord that came with it, doesn't work very well.
B004T36GCU,16,15,The batter import got missed up so I have to by me and a battery charger witch was really cheap
B004T36GCU,16,16,BUT!!!!!! THE BATTERY LIFE SUUUUUUUUUCKS MY LAST PHONE I MAY CHARGE MY PHONE LIKE EVERY 3 DAYS....THIS PHONE IS ON THE CHARGER EVERYDAY, IM THINKING ABOUT RETURNING IT
B004T36GCU,16,17,u turn off the wirelss on the phone u save battery.
B004T36GCU,16,18,battery remover cover was so hard.
B004T36GCU,16,19,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,16,20,Unfortunately, the phone did not come with a battery, so I had to buy one before I could find out if it worked.
B004T36GCU,16,21,The phone works ok but after half hr to an hr it shuts off an im unable to power it on back using the power button therefore I have take out the battery to power it on .
B004T36GCU,16,22,HTC Failure. the battery or if the mobile is not working defectuso, restarts or shuts down the battery is totalemte auque charged, also sometimes happens when connected the charger.
B004T36GCU,16,23,The phone shuts off between an half hour to an hour.
B004T36GCU,16,24,Plugged it back in, showed 95% power on meter, phone powers back on normal.
B004T36GCU,17,0,I get a lot of dropped calls also.
B004T36GCU,17,1,thank you for getting my phone on time,but the one thing it doesn't work very good.If u put the phone on speaker people can't hear you. is very bad that u cannot put your phone on speaker.Last buy from this seller.
B004T36GCU,17,2,problem on phone.
B004T36GCU,17,3,Ringer wasn't very loud I sent the phone back my husband is hard of hearing and he couldn't hardly hear it
B004T36GCU,17,4,Its signal reception is awful.
B004T36GCU,17,5,You have to do tricks shutting networks on and off and clearing the cache constantly to get things to work.
B004T36GCU,17,6,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,17,7,e eUsed on T-mobile system the Aspire only communicates at 2G and sound for the listener is sometimes garbled.
B004T36GCU,17,8,Constant cutting off and glitches over the line.
B004T36GCU,17,9,Also the signal strength was crap.
B004T36GCU,17,10,When I bought this phone it was good, now it has problems and I can't get a replacement because of the time that I had the phone.
B004T36GCU,17,11,Horrible.
B004T36GCU,17,12,When I frist got the phone, it was working fine, I could send picture texts.
B004T36GCU,17,13,Phone would reboot in the mid of a conversation.
B004T36GCU,17,14,I think the team is good, have not much experience in this world of the smart phone, but it is well fluid've seen from HTC.The only thing I dislike about this is the time duration of the battery is exhausted soon.Another thing I do not like is that the screen is very dirty .....I give it three stars ......regards....
B004T36GCU,17,15,With the wifi, bluetooth, and all other apps closed the battery maybe would last 4 hours.
B004T36GCU,17,16,cell phone.
B004T36GCU,17,17,Phone constantly reboot or power off.
B004T36GCU,17,18,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,17,19,I din't have the time to make a discussion about it, so I ordered another one.Be careful with this seller as they sell incomplete products.The phone works fine though.
B004T36GCU,17,20,Features  were fine but was unable to send or receive calls so I had to return it.
B004T36GCU,17,21,I contacted ATT thinking it was a system setting they could assist with (fail) called T-mobile and they provided great troubleshooting.
B004T36GCU,17,22,I reset it to factory settings and tried several other options to reclaim the voice but nothing worked.I have to return it because without voice it's not a phone, and without apps it's not a smart phone.I'm not sure what the issue is, but I did some google research and other people replaced the microphone and it worked fine.
B004T36GCU,17,23,I bought this phone with the understanding that T-Mobile would work just fine on it.
B004T36GCU,17,24,The time of charge is low, when I use wifi i have only 4 hours and when I talk 8 hours, but I don't talk continuos.
B004T36GCU,18,0,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,18,1,I am sure it was probably a good phone.
B004T36GCU,18,2,Not bad.
B004T36GCU,18,3,I recomend Nokia N8 it is much better you only need to put the simm and turn it on.
B004T36GCU,18,4,I even had to look on youtube how to do it cause i was giving up.. anyways its a good phone!
B004T36GCU,18,5,I think the team is good, have not much experience in this world of the smart phone, but it is well fluid've seen from HTC.The only thing I dislike about this is the time duration of the battery is exhausted soon.Another thing I do not like is that the screen is very dirty .....I give it three stars ......regards....
B004T36GCU,18,6,There is only one camera on this phone and it sucks, big time.
B004T36GCU,18,7,camera is capable of taking breath taking pictures, it's the equivalent of having a digital camera in itself.
B004T36GCU,18,8,The camera is decent, but the flash is a true champion, with two LEDs that are visible from at least half a mile away.
B004T36GCU,18,9,This phone is not bad for the price, though it does not meet my expectations but generally it is manageable.
B004T36GCU,18,10,It is a decent phone though.
B004T36GCU,18,11,Just because there are a few good reviews, I decided to give it a shot...won't be doing that again!
B004T36GCU,18,12,OVERALL: I love the weight of the phone (not as light as some others which is good since I like to keep my phone for a few years).
B004T36GCU,18,13,It doesn't have a front facing camera which is difficult and the damn thing shuts off when it wants to.
B004T36GCU,18,14,i like it and it has no problems but the problem is it does not have a front facing camera so i cant skype my family anymore but i love htc its the best.
B004T36GCU,18,15,Plus, as it's supposed to be a 4G phone,  there is no front camera.
B004T36GCU,18,16,very light and ergonomically designed instrument, it met all expectation as described although a bit slow, when compared to other instrument in its class.
B004T36GCU,18,17,not a bad phone.expect
B004T36GCU,18,18,Takes good pics, i just cant share them with anyone.
B004T36GCU,18,19,(you can forget about Tango) You better be very still or it's going to be blurry.
B004T36GCU,18,20,=(ALL of that being said, this phone has it quirks but honestly, I don't regret buying it, I got a good deal on it and it has really helped launch me into the "smart" world.
B004T36GCU,18,21,My test..
B004T36GCU,18,22,I am giving it 2 stars just for the weight.
B004T36GCU,18,23,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,18,24,So am increasing the stars from 1 to 2
B004T36GCU,19,0,The phone didnt came with Memory Card.
B004T36GCU,19,1,The 8gig SD card is missing, but I had another one to use.
B004T36GCU,19,2,It does not have the SD card, I'm not sure it might be that way.
B004T36GCU,19,3,Even adding an SD card, that's still not valid.
B004T36GCU,19,4,No Micro SD CardM.
B004T36GCU,19,5,And cant seem to read the sim card at times.
B004T36GCU,19,6,And lastly, they did not include a memory card, meaning I cant even take pictures.
B004T36GCU,19,7,I don't like this phone because it wouldn't ready my memory card.
B004T36GCU,19,8,An other thing that I don't like is that when I download applications some of them won't go on the SD card and can only be in the phone memory.
B004T36GCU,19,9,some problems.
B004T36GCU,19,10,I have some problems with the product.First i didn't receive the sd card and the charger is not working properly
B004T36GCU,19,11,The area of the SD card slot was already scratched up from the previous owner digging the card out, obviously from the same problem.
B004T36GCU,19,12,(Seller called me and informed unlocked phones do not come with the 8GB micro SD card.)this is not a show stopper as micro SD cards are available cheap but if I had known earlier I would have ordered the card along with the phone.
B004T36GCU,19,13,Whenever I wanted to take a picture, it kept asking me to insert an SD card when in fact it was already inserted so I had to keep opening and reinserting until the phone recognized the card.
B004T36GCU,19,14,Doesn't have enough memory space.
B004T36GCU,19,15,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,19,16,The orderinstant(USA) unit has a broken SD card memory slot that doesn't eject cards, you have to dig it out with a fingernail or screwdriver.
B004T36GCU,19,17,First off the phone came without the 8g sd card that it said it came with, Thank goodness I bought a 32g card when i bought the phone.
B004T36GCU,19,18,the void sticker is placed on 2 screws one under the battery and the other on the screw at the bottom left of the SIM card.
B004T36GCU,19,19,But you won't be able to use the 4G even if your sim card is AT&T.;
B004T36GCU,19,20,This is something that really bother me because I have the phone for more or less 1 or 2 month and the phone memory is already half full and my SD card is almost empty and there is nothing I can do about that!
B004T36GCU,19,21,The phone seems to work fine - It would have been better if there was a user's manual with it.I was not able to even download one from the Internet!
B004T36GCU,19,22,The phone works good, but I have a problem finding some applications and widgets I use to have...-
B004T36GCU,19,23,Also, the fact that you have to move each application manually from the phone memory to the SD card each time you download an application is annoying too... it should be automatic!!!If you can deal with this issues then the phone is fine.
B004T36GCU,19,24,No micro sd card.
B004T36GCU,20,0,I did not immediately purchase replacement insurance.
B004T36GCU,20,1,Be careful About Warranty.
B004T36GCU,20,2,When I bought this phone it was good, now it has problems and I can't get a replacement because of the time that I had the phone.
B004T36GCU,20,3,First, the box of the pone came open, I mean, the phone box, not the amazon box.
B004T36GCU,20,4,I purchased 2 of these from Amazon as a reseller.
B004T36GCU,20,5,I din't have the time to make a discussion about it, so I ordered another one.Be careful with this seller as they sell incomplete products.The phone works fine though.
B004T36GCU,20,6,The box was open and the item came with a fake battery.
B004T36GCU,20,7,Which means I have to buy that from the amazon marketplace or run after the seller to send me one.
B004T36GCU,20,8,When I called them, they said that they have all the proof but they have to submit it to repair department and repair department will give me a call In 5 to 10 days (now see this, before sending the phone they said that complete process will take just 2 weeks right from sending the device to receiving it after repair).So even after discussing with 2 different customer care executives, now again I am waiting for the repair department call and again I have to repeat myself to convince them that device is in warranty.
B004T36GCU,20,9,They also confirmed that my phone is in the warranty and I can send in my phone.I sent my phone and after 3 days of the delivery confirmation, I got an update that my device is out of warranty.
B004T36GCU,20,10,My advice:  Contact your seller if you have any problem with an Amazon purchase as they may be able to help you resolve it without returning the item.
B004T36GCU,20,11,After 2 days customer care person said that they received the proof of purcahse (my ATnT bill with date).
B004T36GCU,20,12,First of all their phone died in just 14 months and now they are not even readily accepting it to repair in warranty?
B004T36GCU,20,13,if so could you send me one plz! and thanks!..i should be receiving this phone today
B004T36GCU,20,14,seller is good the product itself is bad.
B004T36GCU,20,15,I will be returning this item because I paid to much for a used phone.
B004T36GCU,20,16,this product to me.
B004T36GCU,20,17,I don't think I will be purchasing anything else from Amazon.
B004T36GCU,20,18,Took it to a repair shop and i was informed that the motherboard needed to be replaced.
B004T36GCU,20,19,Now when I talked to the customer service they asked me the date of purchase and said that although the date of manufacturing is already passed out of warranty (it was May 2011), you will still have the warranty because you purchased the device on July 2011 from ATnT store.
B004T36GCU,20,20,So I got this phone a few months ago, and since the beginning it's been giving me problems when I make calls.
B004T36GCU,20,21,Disappointed when I open the box.
B004T36GCU,20,22,The UPS guy came by each time that I wasn't home which made it hard to return it.
B004T36GCU,20,23,Battery wasn't working.
B004T36GCU,20,24,Only to keep it or return it for my money back.
B004T36GCU,21,0,It was a neat phone when it was working.
B004T36GCU,21,1,Neat phone but didn't work right.
B004T36GCU,21,2,The phone is not unlocked.
B004T36GCU,21,3,Still missed about 50% of the calls.
B004T36GCU,21,4,Sometimes it just misses a call.
B004T36GCU,21,5,Cannot get on T-Mobile data network.
B004T36GCU,21,6,I called my company (T-mobile) and they helped me with that.
B004T36GCU,21,7,Unlocked Phone.
B004T36GCU,21,8,is not unlocked as they said.
B004T36GCU,21,9,I returned this item because I could not get service at my home with an AT&T;  sim card.
B004T36GCU,21,10,Received Unlocked phone ... but doesn't seem new.
B004T36GCU,21,11,unlock code? will i need one?
B004T36GCU,21,12,The phone its new but the problem its that the phone is not unlocked only work with AT&T; edge.
B004T36GCU,21,13,The phone I got was actually locked to at&t.;
B004T36GCU,21,14,EVEN AT THAT, IT DOES NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH WI-FI SERVICE, EVEN THOUGH THE WI-FI IS VERY STRONG AND OTHER PHONES CONNECT PERFECTLY.
B004T36GCU,21,15,once I received the phone I found out I could transfer my service to the phone .sorry
B004T36GCU,21,16,You can use it to call and tx msg.
B004T36GCU,21,17,I have problems with this phone I bought on February 15.
B004T36GCU,21,18,Took it to a T-Mobile retail outlet and they said its locked?
B004T36GCU,21,19,Even though the phone was advertised as an unlocked phone, the wifi hotspot feature has been locked by AT&T.;
B004T36GCU,21,20,I wish it worked.
B004T36GCU,21,21,However, I had problems with it and returned to Amazon for a full refund (which I got).
B004T36GCU,21,22,I have problems with this phone.
B004T36GCU,21,23,I try to start with tigo, comcel and movistar but the phone didnt work
B004T36GCU,21,24,The phone is supposed to be unlocked.

B004T36GCU,22,12,I ordered the Inspire 4G but got the Desire HD with an Inspire 4G sticker on the box.
B004T36GCU,22,13,There are differences between both phones, mainly the Desire HD does NOT support 4G.
B004T36GCU,22,14,Not upgrade-able to latest Android versions.
B004T36GCU,22,15,Some network issues are there not sure if its phone issue or network issue

B004T36GCU,22,17,This "unlocked" phone did not work properly on T-Mobile, did not run on 4G, did not run on 3G, so it rendered the phone useless for data, it worked OK as a phone or for texting.Returned to vendor, as I was expecting better.
B004T36GCU,22,18,Lacks in Speed and Support but recovers with 4G and 8 MP Camera w/F.

B004T36GCU,22,23,Slow data transmission.
B004T36GCU,22,24,I used this phone with T-mobile.Also, they shipped me the HTC DESIRE not the HTC INSPIRE which is mentioned here.When
B004T36GCU,23,0,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,23,1,I got this phone about a year ago and returned it for a full refund.. it worked pretty well, I remember having a few small issues with it but not what they were exactly.. one problem was the button to turn the screen off and on was so small, you had to press it extremely hard until it hurt your finger.
B004T36GCU,23,2,I'm not going to go through the hassle of doing that.On the other side, I thought the interface was very easy to use and I really wish it would have worked out for me.
B004T36GCU,23,3,The phone freezes all the time so i have to take the battery out to unfreeze it.
B004T36GCU,23,4,Hardly ideal for something you will be pressing all the time..
B004T36GCU,23,5,But then i started adding apps and connecting my e-mail and the voice went out (microphone).
B004T36GCU,23,6,Half the time I couldn't press it at all unless I used my nails.
B004T36GCU,23,7,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,23,8,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,23,9,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.

B004T36GCU,23,11,Once certain apps get downloaded the phone starts to freeze like it has too many cookies or a small virus on it.
B004T36GCU,23,12,Making it nearly impossible to download anything or make calls or text.
B004T36GCU,23,13,When I bought this phone it was good, now it has problems and I can't get a replacement because of the time that I had the phone.
B004T36GCU,23,14,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,23,15,I hate this phone.
B004T36GCU,23,16,too slow phone dont buy it and battery finish in 6 or 7 hour you have too charge too many time
B004T36GCU,23,17,If your looking a good priced phone at a low cost--this is a nice one... Just look out for the battery problem, the price to ship back to the supplier and wait for the refund was just not worth the hassle...
B004T36GCU,23,18,Easy to use, looks nice, no issues.
B004T36GCU,23,19,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,23,20,Unfortunately, the phone did not come with a battery, so I had to buy one before I could find out if it worked.
B004T36GCU,23,21,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,23,22,=(ALL of that being said, this phone has it quirks but honestly, I don't regret buying it, I got a good deal on it and it has really helped launch me into the "smart" world.
B004T36GCU,23,23,This isn't really a big deal to me but for some people it could be, I suppose.-And of course....the battery life is pretty terrible.
B004T36GCU,23,24,After doing some research, I had to set the wallpaper and settings to "default" which helped this problem.
B004T36GCU,24,0,Hardly ideal for something you will be pressing all the time..
B004T36GCU,24,1,It locks up every other day it seems, but other than that it works ok.
B004T36GCU,24,2,The phone is slow and some times the plastic cover at the back side of bottom cames out when you try to take out from your pocket.
B004T36GCU,24,3,Once it started up, I noticed that the left side of the phone did not work.
B004T36GCU,24,4,Would reset ring tone and delete ring tones.
B004T36GCU,24,5,After doing some research, I had to set the wallpaper and settings to "default" which helped this problem.
B004T36GCU,24,6,Still missed about 50% of the calls.
B004T36GCU,24,7,Sometimes it just misses a call.
B004T36GCU,24,8,Sometimes when I unlock the screen, the camera is on, or the world clock is showing.
B004T36GCU,24,9,I was adjusting the volume on Spotify and the plastic volume rocker just...fell out of the phone, and it's difficult to replace.-Called
B004T36GCU,24,10,Half the time I couldn't press it at all unless I used my nails.
B004T36GCU,24,11,I wish it worked.
B004T36GCU,24,12,I had to press it in order to fix it in its position.
B004T36GCU,24,13,I changed the default wallpaper to a different one (already installed on phone) and it locked the phone up.
B004T36GCU,24,14,After 7 months, not a single scratch could be seen on my phone.Inspire #1: Fine, except the proximity sensor never worked, causing me to accidentally hang up on calls when the screen didn't turn off.
B004T36GCU,24,15,There is only one camera on this phone and it sucks, big time.
B004T36GCU,24,16,It kept freezing at least 3 to 4 times a day.
B004T36GCU,24,17,One day, the volume rocker just fell out.
B004T36GCU,24,18,I never turned on this phone.
B004T36GCU,24,19,Annoying.
B004T36GCU,24,20,One evening, the phone blacked out and would not get switched back on.
B004T36GCU,24,21,bottom cover isn't attached properly , you can see width between cover.
B004T36GCU,24,22,but phone's light stays on some time.
B004T36GCU,24,23,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,24,24,I reattached only to find that it would not close properly.
B004T36GCU,25,0,When I frist got the phone, it was working fine, I could send picture texts.
B004T36GCU,25,1,I have to send it back.
B004T36GCU,25,2,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,25,3,Then after about 2 wks. it would no longer let me send picture text.
B004T36GCU,25,4,but i can send regular text.
B004T36GCU,25,5,But then i started adding apps and connecting my e-mail and the voice went out (microphone).
B004T36GCU,25,6,EVEN AT THAT, IT DOES NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH WI-FI SERVICE, EVEN THOUGH THE WI-FI IS VERY STRONG AND OTHER PHONES CONNECT PERFECTLY.
B004T36GCU,25,7,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,25,8,Features  were fine but was unable to send or receive calls so I had to return it.
B004T36GCU,25,9,When I started using the phone, a lot of things weren't functioning like picture text, no internet connection even when there is a wifi service to connect to, sometimes the phone will automatically cancel my calls & voicemails, very  very slow internet service, social networks wont log in and host of other problems.
B004T36GCU,25,10,Also, it is an unlocked phone so I was told that my picture messages will never be able to send and I will not be able to download incoming multimedia messages.
B004T36GCU,25,11,You can use it to call and tx msg.
B004T36GCU,25,12,Froze multiple times a day (especially when I went between data & wifi).
B004T36GCU,25,13,The biggest problem is that it likes to freeze during using the navigation and while making calls.
B004T36GCU,25,14,I faxed them (they don't have a facility where I can just scan and email them which is a very big pain because you don't know if at all they received the fax until somebody confirms it).
B004T36GCU,25,15,To use internet you have to change some datas manually.
B004T36GCU,25,16,This phone will not allow me to access the T-Mobile data network.
B004T36GCU,25,17,Its ability to remain connected to WiFi wasn't stellar, either.
B004T36GCU,25,18,I'm hoping the pictures sent successfully because I did not yet receive any error message.PROS:Able to use T-Mobile SimThin lightweightNice size screen
B004T36GCU,25,19,I get a lot of dropped calls also.
B004T36GCU,25,20,I am considering send it back.
B004T36GCU,25,21,I called my company (T-mobile) and they helped me with that.
B004T36GCU,25,22,make sure u have the settings for mms package on the phone.
B004T36GCU,25,23,CONNECTION DOES NOT FLUCTUATE IN OTHER PHONES, BUT THIS PHONE CONNECTS POORLY FOR A SHORT TIME AND DISCONNECTS AND RECONNECTS ALL BY ITSELF.
B004T36GCU,25,24,Unable to receive/send pictures and unable to use internet due to not truly unlocked....phone wants to use at&t; internet and data but I have tmobile
