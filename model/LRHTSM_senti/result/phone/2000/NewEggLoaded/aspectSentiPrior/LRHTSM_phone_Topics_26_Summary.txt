B00COYOAYW,0,4,Good quality.
B00COYOAYW,0,5,Size is nice and the screen is nice and bright.2.
B00COYOAYW,0,6,The size is good for the "mature" eye.
B00COYOAYW,0,7,Very good phone.
B00COYOAYW,0,8,What's nice are overall size and feel, fits nice in the hand.
B00COYOAYW,0,9,I do like the main screen interface and I do think this would be a good first phone.
B00COYOAYW,0,10,Nice phone.
B00COYOAYW,0,11,needs more apps but its a good phone.
B00COYOAYW,0,12,The phone itself is a nice size, a little bigger than what I had before, but not overly big like the more popular phones - it also has a solid build to it but still feels nice and light in your hands.
B00COYOAYW,0,13,Just flicking the screen sometmes will take you to a fb page that you havent seen before!
B00COYOAYW,0,14,The touch screen is great, the keyboard predictability also great.
B00COYOAYW,0,15,The phone feels very fast and responsive.
B00COYOAYW,0,16,The touch screen is pretty sensitive.
B00COYOAYW,0,17,Great Phone For a great price.
B00COYOAYW,0,18,This is a pretty good off-contract phone.
B00COYOAYW,0,19,* It feels great in the hand - not too big, quite thin and light.
B00COYOAYW,0,20,Great phone, if you get a good one.
B00COYOAYW,0,21,Whilst it is not a super amazing display it is still a very nice screen.
B00COYOAYW,0,22,The 521 display touch screen is also very easy to use as it is quite sensitive.-
B00COYOAYW,0,23,i had white color and its perfect :)  touch screen works perfectly.
B00COYOAYW,0,24,Not All that Great.
B00COYOAYW,1,0,Doesn't have all of the same apps available as I had with the Android.
B00COYOAYW,1,1,Can't use Google or IPhone Apps but Windows 8 have their own apps to make up for it.
B00COYOAYW,1,2,More apps!
B00COYOAYW,1,3,I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.
B00COYOAYW,1,4,no windows phone!
B00COYOAYW,1,5,Meh. Windows aint my favorite.
B00COYOAYW,1,6,Now know this, Android has over 895,000 apps, while Windows 8 has around 170,000 apps.
B00COYOAYW,1,7,App store has a bunch of rip-offs and the good apps arent even well made.-
B00COYOAYW,1,8,I could refill my prescriptions with an app on my phone which I cannot do since there isn't an app for it on Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,9,Slowly getting used to the Windows phone being very different from the Androids that I've always used.
B00COYOAYW,1,10,Really dissapointting, like Windows 8.
B00COYOAYW,1,11,From Android to Windows.
B00COYOAYW,1,12,I don't use instagram but I saw they have a beta app.
B00COYOAYW,1,13,Lack of apps, doesn't have my bank app yet, I use this app all the time2.
B00COYOAYW,1,14,2)The installed phone apps are much more useful to me then the pre-installed iPhone apps.
B00COYOAYW,1,15,If only there was a way you could put android on it yourself...wink wink..
B00COYOAYW,1,16,The app store is a FAR cry from the playstore, let me tell you.
B00COYOAYW,1,17,They made the OS into an app.
B00COYOAYW,1,18,Are there less app's for Windows Phone?
B00COYOAYW,1,19,If you're an app addict, this may not be the phone for you - just yet.
B00COYOAYW,1,20,APP STORE!
B00COYOAYW,1,21,Isnt much you can do with the phone, no really good games, or utility apps you may get out of iOS or Android.
B00COYOAYW,1,22,Some of the ones I wish were there but haven't found: NPR, NBA, politico, official google apps (e.g.
B00COYOAYW,1,23,The phone itself is okay, if it ran android, then it'd be a good phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,24,It doesn't have apps as good as Android or iOS.
B00COYOAYW,2,0,Great price, although I see the price keeps going up and down.
B00COYOAYW,2,1,The price is right.
B00COYOAYW,2,2,okay for the price.
B00COYOAYW,2,3,Great phone, great price.

B00COYOAYW,2,8,Great phone for the price.
B00COYOAYW,2,9,Great phone for the price.
B00COYOAYW,2,10,Great phone... for its price.

B00COYOAYW,3,0,Battery Life.
B00COYOAYW,3,1,Battery life.
B00COYOAYW,3,2,And its battery is good.
B00COYOAYW,3,3,Battery life is great.
B00COYOAYW,3,4,Very good battery life too.
B00COYOAYW,3,5,Battery life to a certain extent is good.
B00COYOAYW,3,6,I keep my phone on "Battery Saver", and I can go 24+ hours and still have about 30% battery life by the end of that cycle.
B00COYOAYW,3,7,The battery life.
B00COYOAYW,3,8,The battery life is really good.
B00COYOAYW,3,9,Drains the battery within 4 hours.
B00COYOAYW,3,10,It has really long battery life so you don't have to charge every few hours and recharges quickly too so that is good.
B00COYOAYW,3,11,I charge it every other day.
B00COYOAYW,3,12,Battery life got better as it was used.
B00COYOAYW,3,13,I have had the phone for a few days now and so far so good !
B00COYOAYW,3,14,Looks like a defective battery or the phone just doesn't really last more than 5 hours.
B00COYOAYW,3,15,Overall, a phone is about call clarity and battery life.
B00COYOAYW,3,16,You can charge it every day or 1-1/2 days but no more than that.b)
B00COYOAYW,3,17,The battery life is also really nice on this phone.
B00COYOAYW,3,18,Battery life is good for two solid days -  Though this may be because I stopped using my phone when it stopped informing me of... anything.*
B00COYOAYW,3,19,Battery life so far average.
B00COYOAYW,3,20,Longer battery life.
B00COYOAYW,3,21,One day it will go dead in a few hrs and the next time will last 3 days and I don't use it that much.
B00COYOAYW,3,22,I charge my phone usually every other day.
B00COYOAYW,3,23,Slightly above average battery life.7)
B00COYOAYW,3,24,good phonr.
B00COYOAYW,4,0,Good quality phone!
B00COYOAYW,4,1,no quality.
B00COYOAYW,4,2,The call quality is so great.
B00COYOAYW,4,3,Works great as a work phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,4,Good.
B00COYOAYW,4,5,Good sound.
B00COYOAYW,4,6,Good quality.
B00COYOAYW,4,7,Great Phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,8,great phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,9,- but not flimsy-Speaker is okay, sounds surprisingly good for a phone-Screen is sharp-Windows 8 is really good (shocking) so far-Camera is okay, but sluggish
B00COYOAYW,4,10,works great have had no problems with it.sound
B00COYOAYW,4,11,quality is better than old one.all in all good phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,12,The sound and the videos from you tube are loud and clear so if they fix that adobe it will make it a great phone but no adobe not so great.
B00COYOAYW,4,13,Call quality was ok but not great, there are much better phones out there.
B00COYOAYW,4,14,Good phone but.
B00COYOAYW,4,15,I'm also quite happy with the sound quality both on calls and music.
B00COYOAYW,4,16,Great Phone.

B00COYOAYW,4,20,Works great!
B00COYOAYW,4,21,Very good phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,22,Other than that this phone is great.
B00COYOAYW,4,23,Call quality is quite decent, most of my calls on this phone were quite clear.
B00COYOAYW,4,24,The call quality is great, the speaker phone is louder and clearer than my old "premium" phone, and headphones sound great (better than my nexus 7).
B00COYOAYW,5,0,If you want a professional camera on a phone, this isn't for you.
B00COYOAYW,5,1,I only wish it had a better camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,2,Camera not too great and im use to a front facing camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,3,Very good camera too.
B00COYOAYW,5,4,It's a good phone with great features.
B00COYOAYW,5,5,good phonr.
B00COYOAYW,5,6,Camera is good in light only, and the apps are pretty cool for the camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,7,Cameras good and has many cool features.
B00COYOAYW,5,8,Would like a better camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,9,no front facing camera if you are a skyper
B00COYOAYW,5,10,Wish it had a front camera!
B00COYOAYW,5,11,I really like it would b perfect if it had a camera in the front.
B00COYOAYW,5,12,I didn't know there was not a flash and front camera, but overall cool phone.����
B00COYOAYW,5,13,Attention: no flash, no front camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,14,What I like best, though, are the camera features.
B00COYOAYW,5,15,No camera flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,16,There is also no flash on the camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,17,The camera and pictures--I know there is no flash however low light pictures look great for a low end phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,18,The only redeeming feature is the camera which is excellent.
B00COYOAYW,5,19,If you value apps, get an Android or iOS.2) If having a good camera is important to you, do not get this phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,20,Front camera would make it an excellent phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,21,Great phone, great price.
B00COYOAYW,5,22,Takes good enough pictures and videos.
B00COYOAYW,5,23,This phone is pretty good.
B00COYOAYW,5,24,Camera takes good pictures as long as there is light.-There
B00COYOAYW,6,0,Sim Card is used.
B00COYOAYW,6,1,Nice phone but when I couldn't get the SIM cards to activate with MetroPCS, I took the phones to them.They tried with their SIM cards and couldn't get the phone going.
B00COYOAYW,6,2,Phone didn't work with MetroPCS.
B00COYOAYW,6,3,You have to install the micro sim card unless you already have one.
B00COYOAYW,6,4,The sim card that came with this new phone could not load my old account onto it when I got the new phone.
B00COYOAYW,6,5,It won't import from the sd card.
B00COYOAYW,6,6,The back plate is removable to access the micro-SD card, sim card and battery.
B00COYOAYW,6,7,Otherwise, you would need to activate the new SIM card which comes with the phone and that renders the old SIM card worthless.Contacts Import:Another fail.
B00COYOAYW,6,8,storage options – 8GB internal memory and an expandable micro SD card.
B00COYOAYW,6,9,Micro SD card for storage expansion, nice camera and good set of apps from Nokia.
B00COYOAYW,6,10,I love the SD card expansion for video and music, only wish I could save apps to the SD card.Now how to unlock this thing to take out of the country
B00COYOAYW,6,11,Sim Card Sucks.
B00COYOAYW,6,12,After charging it, I needed to insert my SIM card from my old phone.The SIM Card:The SIM card slot is underneath the battery and smaller than the one I was using from a phone about 3 years old.
B00COYOAYW,6,13,Phone seems good but I called T-Mobile costumer service to activate it and they said the sim card was used.
B00COYOAYW,6,14,It took me 5 tries to get the SIM card installed correctly.
B00COYOAYW,6,15,FYI it uses a micro sim.
B00COYOAYW,6,16,I don't even think I need this 8gb micro-sd card anymore.---Really
B00COYOAYW,6,17,SD card slot for additional storage....again, not too many newer phones has that.5.
B00COYOAYW,6,18,Only has about 7GB storage so you need at least a 16 GB SD card for phone updates, photos, videos etc.
B00COYOAYW,6,19,My major deal-breaker with this phone is that each app has its own unchangeable settings for read/writing to the sd card, which means that 9 times out of 10 you will be FORCED to save to the 4gb phone memory.
B00COYOAYW,6,20,Phone, Camera, MP3 Player and can add plenty of free apps plus up to a 64MB Micro SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,6,21,I expanded the data with a 32GB microSD card.
B00COYOAYW,6,22,The 8 GB memory gets used up fast even though I requested everything to be placed on my SD card.
B00COYOAYW,6,23,It came with a sim card, but I took my old T-Mobile sim card, and cut it to fit.
B00COYOAYW,6,24,Could not use my current SIM card in the device because it takes a mini sim and I have a regular size sim card
B00COYOAYW,7,0,Received the phone on time and in working order.
B00COYOAYW,7,1,time will tell no more to say
B00COYOAYW,7,2,be i will order 3 more
B00COYOAYW,7,3,Great Phone For a great price.
B00COYOAYW,7,4,I received this phone on time in great condition and loved it.
B00COYOAYW,7,5,great.
B00COYOAYW,7,6,Nor is it a Samsung.
B00COYOAYW,7,7,great.
B00COYOAYW,7,8,i like it it is very good  thanks.
B00COYOAYW,7,9,It's a good phone with great features.
B00COYOAYW,7,10,The phone might be a good phone, but seller is a fraud.
B00COYOAYW,7,11,Great phone with an awesome price that exceeds expectations.
B00COYOAYW,7,12,Maybe a new item would make a perfect phone.
B00COYOAYW,7,13,The phone we kept works good.
B00COYOAYW,7,14,I received my new phone promptly and in perfect condition.
B00COYOAYW,7,15,Many functions on the phone do not work.
B00COYOAYW,7,16,Ordered two and neither of them worked.
B00COYOAYW,7,17,Works great as a work phone.
B00COYOAYW,7,18,good.
B00COYOAYW,7,19,Purchased this for my father and so far he is loving it.
B00COYOAYW,7,20,Good so far.
B00COYOAYW,7,21,Very happy with the product so far and I highly recommend going through amazon as they have great prices.
B00COYOAYW,7,22,It's been good so far and was happy how fast I recieved it.
B00COYOAYW,7,23,For people looking to buy this phone should also look into galaxy from samsung
B00COYOAYW,7,24,I am thinking the seller sent me a refurbished one.
B00COYOAYW,8,0,The phone is great.
B00COYOAYW,8,1,Phone didn't work with MetroPCS.
B00COYOAYW,8,2,T-mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,8,3,Works great, but if you have a Contract already make sure you call your provider.
B00COYOAYW,8,4,I'm keeping the phone but switching service to AT&T.;
B00COYOAYW,8,5,T-Mobile is horrible.
B00COYOAYW,8,6,But I know it's coming!Great customer service Amazon!!
B00COYOAYW,8,7,He would go to call someone and the phone would just not do the call.
B00COYOAYW,8,8,Don't count on t-mobile to unlock it.
B00COYOAYW,8,9,Wifi calling works great, particularly since T-mobile doesn't have great coverage everywhere (like inside my house).
B00COYOAYW,8,10,Not sure if it is the source of the device or T-Mobile activation/support team [out of Texas].
B00COYOAYW,8,11,Excellent phone but T-Mobile is horrible.
B00COYOAYW,8,12,A great buying opportunity.
B00COYOAYW,8,13,Let me state that I primarily use this phone with the Wi-Fi calling feature, as I do not have cell service at home.
B00COYOAYW,8,14,The 521 comes with wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,8,15,The phone we kept works good.
B00COYOAYW,8,16,like the Wi-Fi calling feature I get on T-Mobile because there are a couple places I go regularly where service isn't good but I can still make and take calls over Wi-Fi.
B00COYOAYW,8,17,Device itself is great and works as it supposed to be however activating with T-Mobile was pain.
B00COYOAYW,8,18,Horrible phone and service.
B00COYOAYW,8,19,It only does it while I'm at work.
B00COYOAYW,8,20,I called t-mobile to decode it, but they refused to do that.
B00COYOAYW,8,21,It took some talking to customer service to get it working correctly, but once they got it fixed, it worked well for about a month or two.
B00COYOAYW,8,22,This is the worst customer service I have ever had regrading a cell phone.
B00COYOAYW,8,23,The antenna seems to work really well and I often have a very good signal though I live out in the country.
B00COYOAYW,8,24,Good device however painful activation with T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,9,0,fast, fast – There is no lag on this phone.
B00COYOAYW,9,1,Works great as a work phone.
B00COYOAYW,9,2,Great phone, great price.
B00COYOAYW,9,3,It got here fast and I think this is a great value for the money.
B00COYOAYW,9,4,Phone is fast with 1 Ghz processor and 512 ram.
B00COYOAYW,9,5,The spoiler here is my other phone is 4G LTE.
B00COYOAYW,9,6,Functions are smooth but not very fast.
B00COYOAYW,9,7,Great for the price, but slow.
B00COYOAYW,9,8,Nice device, good price.
B00COYOAYW,9,9,Good phone for the price.
B00COYOAYW,9,10,Very simple and very fast.
B00COYOAYW,9,11,It has exceeded my expectations in pretty much every way.Pros:- It has great hardware for the price, a dual core snapdragon processor and 512 mb of ram is nothing to scoff at in this price range.-Windows
B00COYOAYW,9,12,Great phone at an even better price.
B00COYOAYW,9,13,It's FAST.
B00COYOAYW,9,14,This phone is very very fast.
B00COYOAYW,9,15,I have not read all the other reviews and I'm sure someone else used the same subject line, but this is a great phone at a great price!
B00COYOAYW,9,16,Great Phone in this price.
B00COYOAYW,9,17,Everything works very nicely smooth and responsive.
B00COYOAYW,9,18,This is a nice Windows Phone for a great price.
B00COYOAYW,9,19,If you can make that trade-off (and obviously millions of people can), then this a great deal.A note on the lack of LTE - T-Mobile's non-LTE 4G service is VERY fast.
B00COYOAYW,9,20,Works great, pretty simple, has most of what my old phone did and currently doesn't overheat.
B00COYOAYW,9,21,This phone to replace an HTC HD7 which had lots of flaky hardware issues.Windows 8 is a good improvement from WP7. Clear smooth and responsive.
B00COYOAYW,9,22,The phone speed is fast enough for my needs, but I am not a gamer.3.
B00COYOAYW,9,23,The process response seems to be good, little to no lag.
B00COYOAYW,9,24,It loads fast for everything which is nice when your in a hurry.
B00COYOAYW,10,0,Good phone and easy to use.
B00COYOAYW,10,1,Easy to use would recommend this to anyone.
B00COYOAYW,10,2,Great value.

B00COYOAYW,10,17,It was easy to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,10,18,Overall good and easy phone to work with.
B00COYOAYW,10,19,keyboard works great.
B00COYOAYW,10,20,Very intuitive (for me) and easy to use.
B00COYOAYW,10,21,Good.
B00COYOAYW,10,22,Good Phone.
B00COYOAYW,10,23,I loved my Mac back in the 90's when nobody loved Mac.
B00COYOAYW,10,24,Love the layout of the phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,0,I wish they'd put that bing button on the left tho.
B00COYOAYW,11,1,Dont reward them for the poor design and functionality.
B00COYOAYW,11,2,Several reviewers have noted this same phenomenon.
B00COYOAYW,11,3,I gave the wrong review on the illumishield plastic covers.
B00COYOAYW,11,4,Good so far.
B00COYOAYW,11,5,Overall good and easy phone to work with.
B00COYOAYW,11,6,The buttons are placed right where you would hold the phone, so that's one adjustment.
B00COYOAYW,11,7,however, my GF seems to think this an old phone just b/c of the design, but its not.
B00COYOAYW,11,8,Even if you lock the screen while on a call it unlocks after a bit and happens all over again.Otherwise, no complaints.
B00COYOAYW,11,9,Cheap quality and phone locked and is locked.
B00COYOAYW,11,10,Plus it does not let you change the background color.
B00COYOAYW,11,11,The shutter button is on the right lower side, perfectly placed to click if you are holding the camera in your right hand.
B00COYOAYW,11,12,I cant get over how crappy this phone is, and dont understand how this can get so many positive reviews.
B00COYOAYW,11,13,The way to change brightness manually is buried in the Settings and takes several steps to get there.
B00COYOAYW,11,14,Cheap and good.
B00COYOAYW,11,15,Yes, I changed the background to white, which does make it easier to see.
B00COYOAYW,11,16,The phone is locked.
B00COYOAYW,11,17,I'm still getting used to functions but I can say this phone is a fraction of a step up from my previous phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,18,Some function is not very good, and the bottom is not very connect to the phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,19,Great features, easy to use...
B00COYOAYW,11,20,are you Looking for a change?
B00COYOAYW,11,21,If you're in a good reception zone, good call quality.3)
B00COYOAYW,11,22,Good phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,23,Love how I can set up the screen with different size tags.
B00COYOAYW,11,24,buttons on bottom real nice to use.
B00COYOAYW,12,0,Great phone, does just what it says,I have never had a phone with internet before.
B00COYOAYW,12,1,Value for money.
B00COYOAYW,12,2,The phone is just used to call and text.
B00COYOAYW,12,3,It tries to send text and email messages ONCE and that's it.
B00COYOAYW,12,4,Predictive text works very well and makes texting fun.
B00COYOAYW,12,5,You can say "text Joanna", and then dictate your message and send it.
B00COYOAYW,12,6,Good phone if you just talk and text.
B00COYOAYW,12,7,However, the internet is excellent, and the texting autocomplete is among the best I've encountered.
B00COYOAYW,12,8,Great first phone.
B00COYOAYW,12,9,A great phone for talk & text & music, but not much else.
B00COYOAYW,12,10,buy it, if you really need a phone(to call or text someone), not recommended for DATA users.
B00COYOAYW,12,11,I got it for $60 and it is very responsive for email and surfing and texting.
B00COYOAYW,12,12,It makes phone calls, allows me to send texts and so much more.
B00COYOAYW,12,13,Great phone!
B00COYOAYW,12,14,I use it with the T-mobile pay as go plan, with no data plan (so I just use wifi).
B00COYOAYW,12,15,That means they are downloading every voice to text message you make, analysing it remotely and sending you back what they think you said.
B00COYOAYW,12,16,If all you need in a phone is talk and text, this phone is perfect for you.
B00COYOAYW,12,17,As I am not a gamer, I only use the phone for phone calls, text messaging, checking emails and browsing the web while not near my PC, and taking casual photos while my camera is not around.
B00COYOAYW,12,18,There is no way to talk on the phone and check my email at the same time.
B00COYOAYW,12,19,There are obviously some issues but I guess it's value for money @ 100.00Features are good, Map is good.
B00COYOAYW,12,20,This is a great feature!
B00COYOAYW,12,21,Used to have the T-mobile 30.00 a month plan (1500 talk/text and a pathetic 30 Mb of data).
B00COYOAYW,12,22,I like the ability to surf the web.
B00COYOAYW,12,23,If you use your cellphone for texting, calling, web browsing and creating documents this is a great phone.
B00COYOAYW,12,24,This phone allows me to text,  access the internet, review my emails, take photos and videos of decent quality and even make phone calls (I know, right?).
B00COYOAYW,13,0,Phone case.
B00COYOAYW,13,1,The only problem i had was having to go from my usual big screen 4.7 screens to an actual 4.0 one.
B00COYOAYW,13,2,At my age I could do with a bigger screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,3,Auto rotation of the screen cannot be removed/stopped.
B00COYOAYW,13,4,When I recently put a screen protector on I couldn't find any scratches on the screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,5,I have not tried a non-glare screen protector.2.
B00COYOAYW,13,6,The screen is super sens, so much that you can hover your finger over the screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,7,The Lumia is the first touch screen phone I have used.
B00COYOAYW,13,8,wrong screen protector.
B00COYOAYW,13,9,When I just want to get to the home screen, it'll reboot.
B00COYOAYW,13,10,Because the case didn't fit my phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,11,Ability to have a high contrast screen (for those with poor eyesight or someone who wants a cool looking screen)7.
B00COYOAYW,13,12,Nice case...fit correctly on my nokia lumina 521however the screen protector was for model nokia 520and did not fit my 521
B00COYOAYW,13,13,The touch screen is super sensitive.
B00COYOAYW,13,14,This phone is thinner with a bigger screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,15,Touch screen is same as iphone, very quick and responsive.-
B00COYOAYW,13,16,Phone is nice - did not come with screen protector or car charger.
B00COYOAYW,13,17,touch screen I have ever owned.
B00COYOAYW,13,18,There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time.
B00COYOAYW,13,19,Nokia or the windowsphone store looking for these accessories such as the screen protectors and cases.
B00COYOAYW,13,20,Wipe your screen more often, or put an anti-smudge screen protector and you're problems are solved.
B00COYOAYW,13,21,Screen is nice and easy to see indoors.
B00COYOAYW,13,22,I got a screen protector since everyone mentioned how easily scratches.
B00COYOAYW,13,23,Phone is nice - did not come with screen protector or car charger as indicated.The images for the phone clearly show a screen protector and car charger.
B00COYOAYW,13,24,7) very snappy performanceCons: 1) Screen resolution isn't bad but could be better.
B00COYOAYW,14,0,There are no apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,1,Now know this, Android has over 895,000 apps, while Windows 8 has around 170,000 apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,2,I could refill my prescriptions with an app on my phone which I cannot do since there isn't an app for it on Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,3,apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,4,This is a WINDOWS phone not an Android Phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,5,Windows is.* Apps?
B00COYOAYW,14,6,The apps seems limited compared to apps you can get for iphone/droid.
B00COYOAYW,14,7,Windows apps are different from those the Android market.
B00COYOAYW,14,8,Some key apps I would like to have are only on the iPhone and Android.-
B00COYOAYW,14,9,If APPS are important to you, do not get this phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,10,But think about all the useless apps that people have polluted Google play with, the apps that aren't really apps, and the apps that aren't  free.
B00COYOAYW,14,11,Windows Phone!
B00COYOAYW,14,12,there are not as many apps or podcasts for Windows, but there are enough to keep me occupied and who needs all those games?
B00COYOAYW,14,13,Are there less app's for Windows Phone?
B00COYOAYW,14,14,Free BIBLE APPS! NOT!!!!!
B00COYOAYW,14,15,You can download an autoshoot app and there you have it.
B00COYOAYW,14,16,Lack of apps, doesn't have my bank app yet, I use this app all the time2.
B00COYOAYW,14,17,Some apps not featured on windows phone #such as Instagram, Facebook pages app; YouTube - Facebook app is ok)
B00COYOAYW,14,18,No cohesion between WP's app store and the Win8 store.
B00COYOAYW,14,19,I don't use instagram but I saw they have a beta app.
B00COYOAYW,14,20,For now, quite a few of the iphone apps I used do not have a windows version yet.
B00COYOAYW,14,21,The apps are limited.
B00COYOAYW,14,22,Instagram?...etcIf you mean an "official" app made by the same people who make the app for iOS or Android - maybe yes, maybe no.
B00COYOAYW,14,23,Most of the available apps works great.2
B00COYOAYW,14,24,But all my favorite apps were in there.
B00COYOAYW,15,0,Bought this for my 13 year old niece.
B00COYOAYW,15,1,Never buying a Nokia again.
B00COYOAYW,15,2,My niece wanted a phone for her 13th birthday so I got the Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,3,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,4,I bought this phone because I had previously liked other Nokia phones I had purchased.
B00COYOAYW,15,5,A GREAT phone for a GREAT price!
B00COYOAYW,15,6,The Lumia 520/521 is by far the best value in a smartphone.
B00COYOAYW,15,7,I will never buy another Nokia product again.
B00COYOAYW,15,8,This is the best t-mobile smartphone for the price!
B00COYOAYW,15,9,best t-mobile smartphone for the price.
B00COYOAYW,15,10,I just bought this phone 2 months ago.
B00COYOAYW,15,11,Great phone for the price.
B00COYOAYW,15,12,i dont recommend to anyone to buy stuf from them
B00COYOAYW,15,13,So, if you are looking for the best $100 or less smartphone, get the Nokia Lumia 521, but if you are looking for the best device under $200 I strongly recommend the Moto G.
B00COYOAYW,15,14,This review is on the Nokia Lumia 521 (T-Mobile) phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,15,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,16,This is a great phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,17,This phone was great at first.
B00COYOAYW,15,18,Nokia Lumia 521- great budget phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,19,I'm using Nokia for many years and have model LUMIA 521 yen a year, it works without problems now bought another for a gift for a friend.
B00COYOAYW,15,20,As far as the phone  working and doing what smart phones do, it's great.
B00COYOAYW,15,21,Should have never purchased this phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,22,windows phone - not great.
B00COYOAYW,15,23,If you are going to buy this phone it's better to purchase it from Amazon or Ebay or something like that.
B00COYOAYW,15,24,I recommend it for anyone who wants a basic smartphone for a great price.
B00COYOAYW,16,0,Very Poor Battery Life.
B00COYOAYW,16,1,now the phone wont turn on at all but it shows that the battery is charging.
B00COYOAYW,16,2,So it blinks (charging) all never charges.
B00COYOAYW,16,3,Problems with battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,4,The battery is just over 1/2 charged now.-
B00COYOAYW,16,5,Battery life is terrible unless you have the battery saver on.
B00COYOAYW,16,6,The charging ion would come up when I would charge but it just wouldn't power up.
B00COYOAYW,16,7,I powered the phone off (it had about 80% battery charge).
B00COYOAYW,16,8,battery issue.
B00COYOAYW,16,9,Even when the phone did work the battery life was terrible.
B00COYOAYW,16,10,I keep my phone on "Battery Saver", and I can go 24+ hours and still have about 30% battery life by the end of that cycle.
B00COYOAYW,16,11,Not sure what is the cause but the battery is not large enough to reach the 3 pins in the phone.
B00COYOAYW,16,12,After using the phone, charge it when it tells you to (about 11% remaining).
B00COYOAYW,16,13,I tried everything, if i plug it in (tried for about 17hr charge) it will not keep the charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,14,Battery life is great.
B00COYOAYW,16,15,Now it will not even charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,16,Swapped the battery for another one.. same issue.
B00COYOAYW,16,17,The Lumia uses a Li Ion battery, and not a NiCad battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,18,It wasn't until a few days later that my phone started turning off on it's own even though the battery was fully charged.
B00COYOAYW,16,19,I had to take the battery out.
B00COYOAYW,16,20,Good battery life.
B00COYOAYW,16,21,Can I just get 15 or so batteries and replace them each month so I have a good working phone month after month?
B00COYOAYW,16,22,The battery would not hold a charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,23,I was a little concerned with battery life, but it goes days between charges, which is partially a reflection on how little I use the phone each day.
B00COYOAYW,16,24,When I plug it in, it says its charging so I've been charging it for a couple of hours but the phone still won't turn on.
B00COYOAYW,17,0,When on speaker it's not clear at all.
B00COYOAYW,17,1,i couldn't use my headphone to listen to music because the sound was really bad, so that I had to buy a new headphone.
B00COYOAYW,17,2,Putting the phone on speaker reduces the frequency of this bug, but I cannot be on speaker constantly just because this device/software glitches.
B00COYOAYW,17,3,Loud Speaker.
B00COYOAYW,17,4,Unfortunately, It has bad reception (unless it has to do with T-Mobile) and when on speaker there is a lot of interruption.
B00COYOAYW,17,5,have had this phone since November and the audio or speakers are horrible.
B00COYOAYW,17,6,Always getting cut off....dropping calls.
B00COYOAYW,17,7,I need a phone with better mic and speaker since I use the speakerphone a lot.
B00COYOAYW,17,8,Calls drop sporadically.
B00COYOAYW,17,9,Listen up people!!!
B00COYOAYW,17,10,The speaker is also loud as others have mentioned.
B00COYOAYW,17,11,I want my ringer volume loud and my multimedia volume low.
B00COYOAYW,17,12,Even at 50% volume, the handset speaker is quite loud.
B00COYOAYW,17,13,headphone jack doesnt always cut out the speaker.
B00COYOAYW,17,14,Web worked well, calls came in clear and I could hear what the other person was saying, it had some okay apps...not really an app person.
B00COYOAYW,17,15,Normally I have to increase the volume to 100% on other phones in order to hear the person on the other end.
B00COYOAYW,17,16,Piece of junk no
B00COYOAYW,17,17,Others sometimes have a hard time hearing me.
B00COYOAYW,17,18,You don't get any cool pre-installed ring tones, but at least the speaker and the audio volume will be loud.
B00COYOAYW,17,19,I haven't heard on any bad things with this phone.
B00COYOAYW,17,20,I hear Walmart sells the phone but not the Walmart by me but I hear their selling it for over 150.00
B00COYOAYW,17,21,Under normal use, my headphone jack got "loose" after about 2 months, causing the audio to cut in and out whenever the cord brushed up against something.
B00COYOAYW,17,22,FM Radio: Yes it has an FM Radio.
B00COYOAYW,17,23,Using it for a month now, and people tell me it sounds like cell quality.
B00COYOAYW,17,24,audio and speakers.
B00COYOAYW,18,0,Overall ,good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,1,it's good!
B00COYOAYW,18,2,The camera is not that good.
B00COYOAYW,18,3,A good value.
B00COYOAYW,18,4,BUT its a phone NOT a camera so dont expect it to behave like your digital camera.
B00COYOAYW,18,5,no camera flash
B00COYOAYW,18,6,It Be Good.
B00COYOAYW,18,7,The camera doesn't even have a flash.
B00COYOAYW,18,8,Camera is too bad.
B00COYOAYW,18,9,its a good phone when it comes to being a phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,10,As for the good, the camera is ....ok.
B00COYOAYW,18,11,this phone executes that really well. it doesn't have a front camera.
B00COYOAYW,18,12,The camera no good for taking photos where there is no light/when it's dark out.
B00COYOAYW,18,13,Not so good.
B00COYOAYW,18,14,Good Phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,15,There's no flash and no front camera.
B00COYOAYW,18,16,Sweet camera options but the camera is awful.
B00COYOAYW,18,17,No Good Nokia!
B00COYOAYW,18,18,Basic Phone a Good Price But a Little Hard to Ues.
B00COYOAYW,18,19,Good value for the price .
B00COYOAYW,18,20,Wish it had a front camera!
B00COYOAYW,18,21,Attention: no flash, no front camera.
B00COYOAYW,18,22,good otherwise
B00COYOAYW,18,23,not for me, but there are some good thing about this phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,24,I don't think a camera should be added if it had no flash.
B00COYOAYW,19,0,SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,1,They both come with sim cards and you should be able to do it yourself.
B00COYOAYW,19,2,We just swapped out the SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,3,You have to install the micro sim card unless you already have one.
B00COYOAYW,19,4,No memory.
B00COYOAYW,19,5,It came with a sim card, but I took my old T-Mobile sim card, and cut it to fit.
B00COYOAYW,19,6,SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,19,7,SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,19,8,They mentioned that they don't cut sim cards, but they could transfer my information to a micro sim card.
B00COYOAYW,19,9,Unfortunately, Wal-mart wouldn't let me keep the sim card, which contained my phone number that I wanted to keep.
B00COYOAYW,19,10,Could not use my current SIM card in the device because it takes a mini sim and I have a regular size sim card
B00COYOAYW,19,11,I am very disappointed with this purchase and found that the sim card was already used.
B00COYOAYW,19,12,Otherwise, you would need to activate the new SIM card which comes with the phone and that renders the old SIM card worthless.Contacts Import:Another fail.
B00COYOAYW,19,13,We ahd to purchase another sim card from T Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,19,14,i would have kept it if my sim card was compatible...
B00COYOAYW,19,15,Wish it worked!
B00COYOAYW,19,16,It requires a micro sim card which it does not state in the description.
B00COYOAYW,19,17,If you have an old SIM card you can just stick it in and go.
B00COYOAYW,19,18,If you have music to upload using an SD card, I suggest you skip Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,19,Bought two different sim cards through t mobile still didn't work.
B00COYOAYW,19,20,You can store music on the phone SD card, or in "the cloud" on SkyDrive.
B00COYOAYW,19,21,I went to Tmobile and they activated the new SIM card and transferred all data from the old SIM card and turned on my new phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,22,The sim kit MUST be purchased from Walmart.The phone comes with a sim kit in the box, so if you want the walmart deal you'll have to leave the sim from the box alone until you put in the walmart sim card.The phone worked right out of the box without a sim card using it's wifi capabilities.
B00COYOAYW,19,23,Well how come it is not working?I put the SIM card in, turn it on and the Maps app is empty.
B00COYOAYW,19,24,I did not get the chance to use it because I have a standard sim card and this one uses a mini sim.
B00COYOAYW,20,0,When asked to return or try and replace it I was told no and it was one day after the 30 day warranty this happened.
B00COYOAYW,20,1,The phone stopped working less than 2 weeks after I received it.
B00COYOAYW,20,2,stop working within a month.
B00COYOAYW,20,3,About ten days later, got a replacement with no back cover!
B00COYOAYW,20,4,I didn't do it for seven days straight, but after eight days or so, I had done this at least six times.
B00COYOAYW,20,5,No time to wait!
B00COYOAYW,20,6,And I don't think there is any warranty after 30 days.
B00COYOAYW,20,7,I contacted Nokia customer service.
B00COYOAYW,20,8,2nd replacement still not working.
B00COYOAYW,20,9,He would go to call someone and the phone would just not do the call.
B00COYOAYW,20,10,Still, no battery.April 11, 2014 I called Nokia customer care.
B00COYOAYW,20,11,I asked Nokia to send me a replacement charger so that I can use while they work on the old one.
B00COYOAYW,20,12,There is no warranty for this item.
B00COYOAYW,20,13,The worst customer service -- the phone stopped working; replacement battery not shipped because it is out of stock.
B00COYOAYW,20,14,I sent it in for repair and they returned it saying the wouldn't fix it under warranty because it "showed damage that isn't covered under Nokia limited warranty."
B00COYOAYW,20,15,The customer service representative said he the problem would be escalated and I would be contacted later in the day.Despite being told I would be contacted again, I was not contacted.April 28, 2014, today, I called Nokia customer care.
B00COYOAYW,20,16,How do i return it?
B00COYOAYW,20,17,So I returned it.
B00COYOAYW,20,18,Problems with battery.
B00COYOAYW,20,19,I got this as a replacement phone.
B00COYOAYW,20,20,Poor product quality and poor customer service.
B00COYOAYW,20,21,He would have to take his battery out and put it back in in order for it  to make calls.Overall very disappointing.
B00COYOAYW,20,22,During that month I dropped it a few times.
B00COYOAYW,20,23,I wait a week -- no battery.
B00COYOAYW,20,24,Be careful when you purchase this product.
B00COYOAYW,21,0,phone not unlocked.
B00COYOAYW,21,1,It will use Wi-Fi seamlessly to make phone calls - when my gf calls me over the Wi-Fi it still shows as her phone number calling.
B00COYOAYW,21,2,Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.
B00COYOAYW,21,3,T-mobile wifi calling.*
B00COYOAYW,21,4,My goal was to get it unlocked for use on AT&T.;
B00COYOAYW,21,5,unless wifi calling (wifi calling is free).
B00COYOAYW,21,6,I had set wi-fi calling as wi-fi only.
B00COYOAYW,21,7,Nothing has worked.
B00COYOAYW,21,8,As much as I dislike the (apparently unfixable) problems with T-mobile's service, I hate T-mobile's attitude about it even more.
B00COYOAYW,21,9,Not sure if it's T-Mobile or Nokia phone...service has become LOUSY!
B00COYOAYW,21,10,We have German T-mobile and got sent between US and German T-mobile to figure out how to "unlock" etc.
B00COYOAYW,21,11,It has wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,21,12,Then I called T-mobile customer support and they found that the settings was the problem.
B00COYOAYW,21,13,It was not the phone, it was the service provider.
B00COYOAYW,21,14,Let me state that I primarily use this phone with the Wi-Fi calling feature, as I do not have cell service at home.
B00COYOAYW,21,15,This phone *is* locked to T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,21,16,unlock code.
B00COYOAYW,21,17,Good phone but wont work with service.
B00COYOAYW,21,18,Contact your customer service center for the unlock code.
B00COYOAYW,21,19,Also TMobile was if little help.
B00COYOAYW,21,20,They have WIFI calling and when logged into the WIFI you can use them just like a land line even in schools where cell service is non-existant due to thick walls.
B00COYOAYW,21,21,No service even though it showed service in my area online at T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,21,22,a only draw back is lock phone; it's very hard to unlock this phone if you did not purchase from T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,21,23,Quit working, no return to Amazon.
B00COYOAYW,21,24,I wanted a phone for wi-fi calling and no data plan.
B00COYOAYW,22,0,I think its better, and faster than an android phone, no it is faster.
B00COYOAYW,22,1,You would think this was a higher clocked quad core phone!
B00COYOAYW,22,2,I believe the engineers for Microsoft is on par with Apple.Hardware:The Lumia 521 has a 1 ghz dual core Snapdragon S4 plus processor with 512 mb of RAM.
B00COYOAYW,22,3,It is more fluid than the nexus 4 and just as smooth as the iPhone 5S; it just goes to show how amazing the software is optimized.
B00COYOAYW,22,4,That may be due to the 1GHz dual core processor, but it may also be due to not having dual band WiFi so I couldn't hook it up to my 5GHz WiFi router which is much faster than the 2.4GHz band.-
B00COYOAYW,22,5,There is no front-facing camera (don't care), 8 gb internal storage, 512 Ram, and a 1 ghz dual-core snapdragon processor.
B00COYOAYW,22,6,I have to post a little disclaimer before I get into the review, I'm a bit of a tech junkie and my primary phone is an iPhone 5S and before that was a nexus 4 (1.5 ghz quad core, running Android 4.3 - sold it before 4.4 Kit Kat was released), so my thoughts on the Lumia is compared to my past and current high end phones.That being said, the Lumia 521 has far exceeded my expectations!Software:The first thing that caught my attention was how surprisingly fluid this phone is for a 1 ghz dual core phone.
B00COYOAYW,22,7,First thing you have to do is that you have to avoid comparing this smartphone with higher end devices such as the Galaxy S4, HTC One, Iphone, or other Nokia Lumia devices.
B00COYOAYW,22,8,All in all a really terrible and disappointing experience.
B00COYOAYW,22,9,Replaced venerable iPhone 3G.
B00COYOAYW,22,10,First of, this phones dual-core processor and 512mb of RAM wouldn't make it very far in the Android world, but here it's snappy and responsive, no lag experienced and apps run smoothly.
B00COYOAYW,22,11,I already have two Android phones so certainly am in no need of buying a phone for myself, but it was time to upgrade my wife's old Android phone, which had become quite unreliable with frequent freeze-ups and other miscellaneous issues.
B00COYOAYW,22,12,I give this 4/5 stars due to lack of front-facing camera, no flash, no bluetooth capability and weaker hardware (RAM and processor) than other Lumia models.
B00COYOAYW,22,13,I gave this 4 stars for lack of LTE and a flash for the camera.
B00COYOAYW,22,14,I guess I grew up tired of my Androids lagging and freezing up all the time.
B00COYOAYW,22,15,No LTE but that doesn't bother me.
B00COYOAYW,22,16,Contrary to what I read online, I don't see the storage or RAM limitations as a major issue - 1 gb is the upper-limit for Nokia's phones at this time, and I do not tend to heavily multi-task.
B00COYOAYW,22,17,GREAT value for a phone as smooth as an iPhone.
B00COYOAYW,22,18,OK, so I know this is supposed to be a review of the phone; it's hardware and software.
B00COYOAYW,22,19,With half the processor of the Android phone it was replacing, it still feels like a hardware upgrade.*
B00COYOAYW,22,20,Tried using a battery from an ATT 520 and that does not work either.
B00COYOAYW,22,21,This os is less than a year old.Update: not going back to Android anytime soon.
B00COYOAYW,22,22,My perspective:I've owned iphone and android previously.
B00COYOAYW,22,23,They don't fall short of that now, either.Paired with the 1 ghz dual-core Snapdragon processor, Windows Phone 8 behaves beautifully with no noticeable lag.
B00COYOAYW,22,24,Also falls into the CONS category, though.521
B00COYOAYW,23,0,Easy to use phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,1,The phone is pretty easy to set up.
B00COYOAYW,23,2,new to this type of phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,3,then the exact same thing happend.
B00COYOAYW,23,4,Bad Luck????
B00COYOAYW,23,5,The manual instruction does not give good explanation on how use different things on the phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,6,I've recently used all the major types of phones - iPhone, Android and event Blackberry.
B00COYOAYW,23,7,but i read reviews before buying it and i did not read any type saying that they had the type of problems I'm having.
B00COYOAYW,23,8,This might be an isolated issue and my bad luck.
B00COYOAYW,23,9,2 small things wrong..
B00COYOAYW,23,10,The Windows system is pretty intuitive.
B00COYOAYW,23,11,Almost every word I type.
B00COYOAYW,23,12,hate to imaging a fat fingered person typing on this thing.
B00COYOAYW,23,13,Some bad things about it though is you have to wait a little until it gets a signal which might get frustrating.
B00COYOAYW,23,14,It works almost fine now I still have a few more things left to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,15,I like the functionality of putting all the things commonly used on the start screen and a simple slide shows everything available on the device.
B00COYOAYW,23,16,No option to display text messages on the swipe screen.
B00COYOAYW,23,17,Easy to use Windows Phone interface.
B00COYOAYW,23,18,Two apps at a time bogs things down to where you don't want to use the device.
B00COYOAYW,23,19,being said, the system isn't bad, but it isn't for everyone.
B00COYOAYW,23,20,You can really customize the phone to your liking (from the size of the tiles, the arrangement, the color, etc.) I can pin specific people to the start screen for quick access to call or text.
B00COYOAYW,23,21,Don't waste your time, total garbage, wish I stayed with iPhone, way too many issues with windows system.
B00COYOAYW,23,22,I especially like this feature: I can put all of my favorite contact person's names/pictures on "Start Page" as "small tiles" and they would work as a speed-dial short-cut for phone calls/texting.....I don't need to look for the person in a phonebook that can be frustrating sometimes.....good for people who has poor eyesight.8.
B00COYOAYW,23,23,Unlike Apple products, the virtual keyboard makes it clear when a letter is capitalized.Cons- Nowadays this phone is relatively mediocre- Call quality is ok- Touchscreen is somewhat touchy and the virtual keyboard can be difficult to use- The Wifi calling feature almost never works, and when it's on it interferes with texting- The biggest problem with it is that it's a Windows phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,24,It seems to have most of the apps I need available, and they work well.
B00COYOAYW,24,0,After i press the power button, it shows "goodbye", then screen turn black.
B00COYOAYW,24,1,The power button is accidently pressed all the time.
B00COYOAYW,24,2,And a few times, the touch screen has become unresponsive.
B00COYOAYW,24,3,Power button: It's on the side.
B00COYOAYW,24,4,Tried all button combinations to force a reset and nothing works.
B00COYOAYW,24,5,I hit the power button on the side, and I got the screen that said slide down to power off - hurray for physical buttons - but touching the screen still produced no results.
B00COYOAYW,24,6,The phone side buttons and touch "buttons" are not clearly marked / lit.
B00COYOAYW,24,7,Only locked up once but was able to hold power/lock button down and restart it.
B00COYOAYW,24,8,I gave this phone to my mom and she had lots of problems with her cheek pushing the hold/mute buttons during a call.
B00COYOAYW,24,9,has only buttons for volume (up and down), on/off, and camera.
B00COYOAYW,24,10,I've tried with turning off the screen while on the call - the same issue.
B00COYOAYW,24,11,The problem is the buttons on the side of the phone are right there where I grab it, and I had accidently lowered the ring volume to zero.
B00COYOAYW,24,12,watch the buttons on the side.
B00COYOAYW,24,13,Maybe the screen lock can be worked around.
B00COYOAYW,24,14,The delete call option is actually easier and quicker to use than the options menu and buttons on the X2.
B00COYOAYW,24,15,The first 2 weeks with this phone were fine, however, soon it started turning off by itself (meaning the power button doesn't do anything.)
B00COYOAYW,24,16,I click the power button to go to the lock screen again, and it works, but the fact that the touch screen sometimes doesn't register my fingers is kind of iffy.
B00COYOAYW,24,17,I really like the dedicated camera button on the side.-
B00COYOAYW,24,18,volume buttons suck.
B00COYOAYW,24,19,There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time.
B00COYOAYW,24,20,I had to return the 1st one due to camera button not working!!!!
B00COYOAYW,24,21,First, there're bubbles and lines under the screen film.
B00COYOAYW,24,22,The the screen would turn off even when  I am trying to call out and then the power/screen  button is intermitent working 3. the Speaker is really muffled and has a high tone level4.
B00COYOAYW,24,23,I like to keep missed calls and some special calls listed in the call history so "delete all" is not an option for me.
B00COYOAYW,24,24,I like having the "back" button below the screen as it's always easy to find.
B00COYOAYW,25,0,It tries to send text and email messages ONCE and that's it.
B00COYOAYW,25,1,I use my phone, well, to make phone call and send text messages.
B00COYOAYW,25,2,They need a phone for calls, texts, and checking their email.
B00COYOAYW,25,3,It ok if you don't like picture messages.
B00COYOAYW,25,4,can't get on internet,can't access facebook,can't send pictures just not satified with it.
B00COYOAYW,25,5,Seemed to work okay as long as you have added extra money to the account for the 10 cent calls and 20 cent texts.
B00COYOAYW,25,6,I wanted a phone for wi-fi calling and no data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,7,Setting up email (both personal and work) was a breeze.
B00COYOAYW,25,8,She texts, reads some emails, uses the navigation, takes some pictures and makes phone calls.
B00COYOAYW,25,9,If you turn this on, you’ll be able to send and receive voice calls and text messages over any Wi-Fi network with enough bandwidth.
B00COYOAYW,25,10,However this phone did make wi-fi calls and allow internet access without a data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,11,Email and Calendar syncing works fine.
B00COYOAYW,25,12,Same with text (unless you use say the Facebook messaging app).
B00COYOAYW,25,13,I used both phones with the same T-Mobile 1500 min of voice and text plus 30 megs of data.
B00COYOAYW,25,14,Poor camera, can't get picture messages, crashes when people call me, nytimes app doesn't work if you don't have service at the time.
B00COYOAYW,25,15,T-Mobile informed me that this phone could be used without a data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,16,So now my contacts all have pictures, birthdays, e-mails, and phone numbers from all those accounts.
B00COYOAYW,25,17,The calls are not clear and it makes horrible sound sometimes, can not record with the camera, can not resend the text messages, have to retype them, text messages do not go through every time so you have to re send and re type them.
B00COYOAYW,25,18,The so-called wifi calling only gives you the option of making calls over your wifi but does not increase the quality of the call.
B00COYOAYW,25,19,Status messages disappear never to be seen again.
B00COYOAYW,25,20,Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.
B00COYOAYW,25,21,Email set up - If i am setting up my imap and POP accounts I should be able to edit the new account I am setting up if incoming / outgoing servers not correct or there are other corrections needed.
B00COYOAYW,25,22,So, wherever there is no wifi, I can only talk and text.
B00COYOAYW,25,23,The phone goes two days or more for me, but I only make calls and texts.
B00COYOAYW,25,24,I need a phone to call, text, and give me directions when I need them.
B004T36GCU,0,0,Even with a 780p display, the colors are vivid with the S-LCD screen.*Conclusion*A
B004T36GCU,0,1,One last thing- this phone has a 1280 x 720 pixel display, and on a 4.3 inch display it's not that sharp.What we know:Slow phone without any supportPros:This phone is actually quite cheap these days, and serves as a beginner phone.
B004T36GCU,0,2,I feel like I was conned into buying this phone.
B004T36GCU,0,3,I have to buy another battery, but the screen really consumes a lot of energy.
B004T36GCU,0,4,This phone, simply put, is not worth it's weight in plastic.
B004T36GCU,0,5,Phone was never dropped, in a hard protective case from day 1, screen protector from day 1 and now less than 6 months later the phone itself will not charge the battery.
B004T36GCU,0,6,The texting is incredibly glitchy as well; mis-types, and buttons not functioning the same way all the time make this phone a better paper weight.
B004T36GCU,0,7,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,0,8,OVERALL: I love the weight of the phone (not as light as some others which is good since I like to keep my phone for a few years).
B004T36GCU,0,9,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,0,10,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,0,11,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,0,12,There is a lot of dust trapped between the camera lens and the cover glass, resulting in grainy pictures.
B004T36GCU,0,13,battery finish too fast.
B004T36GCU,0,14,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,0,15,you have to be very very careful when you take the cover off to put in the SIM card or you will bend the casing and it will break easy.
B004T36GCU,0,16,This would not be a huge problem if I was a U.S. resident.
B004T36GCU,0,17,Easier said then done if you have a hard plastic case like I did, until I had to remove it so many times to get to the battery.-
B004T36GCU,0,18,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,0,19,So I bought the phone hoping I was going to be able to write a good review but it comes as if I only have a few nice things to say.
B004T36GCU,0,20,HTC used sent instead of new. the phone sent to me was used, while I paid for new, no manual, charger very dirty, scratches on the screen.
B004T36GCU,0,21,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,0,22,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,0,23,But last week while the phone was loaded heated at a temperature too high, it was impossible to touch the high temperature that had.
B004T36GCU,0,24,Even though this phone has an S2, it's on par with a lower-end dual core, and most games run well.
B004T36GCU,1,0,But, unbeknownst to me, some apps can cause blockers.
B004T36GCU,1,1,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,1,2,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,1,3,The Google Play market is perfection, the speed of downloading apps is pretty remarkable, too.
B004T36GCU,1,4,there are many fantastic apps you can get for these phones and it's far less restricted from apple's market from what I understand.
B004T36GCU,1,5,It's also my first smart phone I've owned, and I'm pretty biased towards the Android market; I have no plans of ever owning an iPhone.
B004T36GCU,1,6,I wish I knew which apps caused it.
B004T36GCU,1,7,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,1,8,very confusing to operate and has no gps on it that I could find.
B004T36GCU,1,9,this phone is unable to download certain apps in the play store.
B004T36GCU,1,10,This phone has one of the biggest screens on the market right now, which is great if you surf the web mainly on your phone.
B004T36GCU,1,11,The ones I normally see are stars and the only way to delete them is to rid of the app itself.-For
B004T36GCU,1,12,GPS is dead and it is not being recognized with any navigation app (google map, waze, gps status, etc) Nothing!!!
B004T36GCU,1,13,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,1,14,the battery can cause panic for some because I've found that your pictures, videos and music will vanish and the only way to make them visible is to remove the battery AND restart your phone.
B004T36GCU,1,15,When I started using the phone, a lot of things weren't functioning like picture text, no internet connection even when there is a wifi service to connect to, sometimes the phone will automatically cancel my calls & voicemails, very  very slow internet service, social networks wont log in and host of other problems.
B004T36GCU,1,16,It has 768 MB of RAM, the more RAM; The more stuff you can do at one time [Multiple Tabs on the Internet, Playing a game while talking, having 30 apps open, etc.].
B004T36GCU,1,17,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,1,18,So I bought the phone hoping I was going to be able to write a good review but it comes as if I only have a few nice things to say.
B004T36GCU,1,19,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,1,20,And there are many handy things this device is capable of despite the kinks, and I look forward to what HTC and Android will have for us in the future.
B004T36GCU,1,21,Maybe I shouldn't have bought a used phone because this is my 1st time buying a used phone & the experience isn't good at all.
B004T36GCU,1,22,camera is capable of taking breath taking pictures, it's the equivalent of having a digital camera in itself.
B004T36GCU,1,23,PHONE ALWAYS HOTTHE WIFI NEVER WORKED: I BOUGHT THE PHONE MAINLY FOR ITS PORTABLE HOTSPOT WHICH DOESNT WORK PLUS 4G WHICH IS THE ONLY BENEFIT IVE GOT FOR THE MONEY IVE WASTED ON AN AWEFUL PRODUCT.
B004T36GCU,1,24,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,2,0,Not a good buy.
B004T36GCU,2,1,Maybe I shouldn't have bought a used phone because this is my 1st time buying a used phone & the experience isn't good at all.
B004T36GCU,2,2,Not all that great!
B004T36GCU,2,3,So I bought the phone hoping I was going to be able to write a good review but it comes as if I only have a few nice things to say.
B004T36GCU,2,4,=(ALL of that being said, this phone has it quirks but honestly, I don't regret buying it, I got a good deal on it and it has really helped launch me into the "smart" world.
B004T36GCU,2,5,I wish I have never purchased it and would not recommend it.
B004T36GCU,2,6,Being listed as new with that associated price makes this...  deceitful.
B004T36GCU,2,7,not such a great smartphone.
B004T36GCU,2,8,It didn't work for me so I don't recommend it.
B004T36GCU,2,9,I agree with another review which pointed out that they fail to specify the 3G/4G frequency ranges for this phone.
B004T36GCU,2,10,GREAT JOB, Amazon.
B004T36GCU,2,11,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,2,12,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,2,13,If this was listed as a refurb with associated price the problems would have been acceptable.
B004T36GCU,2,14,Buy a T-mobile phone, it will save you money and a headache.
B004T36GCU,2,15,Bought this phone 2-months ahead since I was waiting for my current phone plan to expire 1st before I could use it.
B004T36GCU,2,16,For those of you who want to know the point: A budget 4G Phone lacking in speed but with a nice cameraOkay this phone is a medium budget phone for people who crave the power of 4G, yet they are on a budget.
B004T36GCU,2,17,It's also my first smart phone I've owned, and I'm pretty biased towards the Android market; I have no plans of ever owning an iPhone.
B004T36GCU,2,18,DO NOT consider if you ever plan to travel overseas.
B004T36GCU,2,19,P.S My first time returning on amazon and I am impressed.
B004T36GCU,2,20,It didn't even come across my mind when I bought it as I'd never imagine a modern day smartphone lacking the frequencies for places like Europe or Asia.
B004T36GCU,2,21,I liked the phone until the wifi stopped working after 3 months for no reason.
B004T36GCU,2,22,We have had this phone for almost two months and the phone has decided to power off each time it goes into hibernate.
B004T36GCU,2,23,So I bought it anyway hoping I would get a good one.
B004T36GCU,2,24,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,3,0,So when I got there we discovered that the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,3,1,The battery lasts for 4 hours...
B004T36GCU,3,2,battery life on lasted 6 hours from a full charge with minimal use.
B004T36GCU,3,3,Because others said their phone was good.
B004T36GCU,3,4,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,3,5,Battery life is about 3/4 of a day with normal use.
B004T36GCU,3,6,Not good for anything else.
B004T36GCU,3,7,I have to buy another battery, but the screen really consumes a lot of energy.
B004T36GCU,3,8,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,3,9,Take your time in taking off the cover for the battery also it is hard to remove.
B004T36GCU,3,10,Casing flimsy - Battery BAD.
B004T36GCU,3,11,battery remover cover was so hard.
B004T36GCU,3,12,So I bought it anyway hoping I would get a good one.
B004T36GCU,3,13,The cable to charge it is broken now.
B004T36GCU,3,14,the battery can cause panic for some because I've found that your pictures, videos and music will vanish and the only way to make them visible is to remove the battery AND restart your phone.
B004T36GCU,3,15,battery can die within a hour , I downloaded music and it would skip and replay music on its own , no screenshot , speaker volume sucks... Looks good bit not a great smartphone I've seen better on amazon.
B004T36GCU,3,16,THIS PHONE ONLY CAME WITH ISSUES!!!!!!!!THE BATTERY DIES IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE AND MUST BE CHARGED DAILY.
B004T36GCU,3,17,not such a great smartphone.
B004T36GCU,3,18,I received my phone in the mail a few days before I left the states to take it to my fiance in St Lucia.
B004T36GCU,3,19,Great seize phone, kind of heavy based on new age phones.
B004T36GCU,3,20,pretty phone but it sucks.
B004T36GCU,3,21,There are better phones.
B004T36GCU,3,22,The time of charge is low, when I use wifi i have only 4 hours and when I talk 8 hours, but I don't talk continuos.
B004T36GCU,3,23,Phone would not charge after first day of use.
B004T36GCU,3,24,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,4,0,Not good for anything else.
B004T36GCU,4,1,Again, ok for just making calls.
B004T36GCU,4,2,Ok for just a phone to make and take calls.
B004T36GCU,4,3,Not the best!
B004T36GCU,4,4,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,4,5,However, I live in the Bahamas and, needles to say, the phone does not serve the purpose for which I bought it.
B004T36GCU,4,6,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,4,7,Wifi hotspot feature is locked by AT&T; I purchased this phone for the purpose of being able to use it as a wifi hot-spot.
B004T36GCU,4,8,Maybe I shouldn't have bought a used phone because this is my 1st time buying a used phone & the experience isn't good at all.
B004T36GCU,4,9,Great camera
B004T36GCU,4,10,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,4,11,thank you for getting my phone on time,but the one thing it doesn't work very good.If u put the phone on speaker people can't hear you. is very bad that u cannot put your phone on speaker.Last buy from this seller.
B004T36GCU,4,12,Even though the phone was advertised as an unlocked phone, the wifi hotspot feature has been locked by AT&T.;
B004T36GCU,4,13,I feel like I was conned into buying this phone.
B004T36GCU,4,14,If you are in an area with spotty service this phone doesnt work for some reason.
B004T36GCU,4,15,So I bought it anyway hoping I would get a good one.
B004T36GCU,4,16,My internet occasionally just stops working, no matter if I'm at my rural house or in the city where I work.
B004T36GCU,4,17,When I started using the phone, a lot of things weren't functioning like picture text, no internet connection even when there is a wifi service to connect to, sometimes the phone will automatically cancel my calls & voicemails, very  very slow internet service, social networks wont log in and host of other problems.
B004T36GCU,4,18,The phone its new but the problem its that the phone is not unlocked only work with AT&T; edge.
B004T36GCU,4,19,camera is capable of taking breath taking pictures, it's the equivalent of having a digital camera in itself.
B004T36GCU,4,20,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,4,21,The problem is, when I pick up the phone, the signal drops to either one bar or it shows no service.
B004T36GCU,4,22,The texting is incredibly glitchy as well; mis-types, and buttons not functioning the same way all the time make this phone a better paper weight.
B004T36GCU,4,23,I get a lot of dropped calls also.
B004T36GCU,4,24,But I will likely look for another phone because of an issue with bad reception.My house is in an area where cell signals are not very strong.
B004T36GCU,5,0,Great camera
B004T36GCU,5,1,camera is capable of taking breath taking pictures, it's the equivalent of having a digital camera in itself.
B004T36GCU,5,2,OVERALL: I love the weight of the phone (not as light as some others which is good since I like to keep my phone for a few years).
B004T36GCU,5,3,It doesn't have a front facing camera which is difficult and the damn thing shuts off when it wants to.
B004T36GCU,5,4,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,5,5,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,5,6,I have to buy another battery, but the screen really consumes a lot of energy.
B004T36GCU,5,7,I wish I knew which apps caused it.
B004T36GCU,5,8,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,5,9,It has lots of RAM, a fast processor, and a great camera in good lighting.I've owned three HTC Inspires in less than 9 months.
B004T36GCU,5,10,I am giving it 2 stars just for the weight.
B004T36GCU,5,11,But on occasion the pictures will simply turn out blurry for 7-10 shots before they return to normal clarity.
B004T36GCU,5,12,Easier said then done if you have a hard plastic case like I did, until I had to remove it so many times to get to the battery.-
B004T36GCU,5,13,I recomend Nokia N8 it is much better you only need to put the simm and turn it on.
B004T36GCU,5,14,You can do video calls on this phone but it does not have a front facing camera so you have to turn the phone to the backside so the person you are talking to can see you.What a disappointment because the main purpose for buying the phone was to save money on international calls by using Skype or other free video calls.
B004T36GCU,5,15,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,5,16,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,5,17,I had to remove the battery and do the process all over again.
B004T36GCU,5,18,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,5,19,the battery can cause panic for some because I've found that your pictures, videos and music will vanish and the only way to make them visible is to remove the battery AND restart your phone.
B004T36GCU,5,20,I've gone an entire day without touching it and come back at the end of the day and its in the yellow.
B004T36GCU,5,21,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,5,22,So when I got there we discovered that the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,5,23,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,5,24,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,6,0,The 8gig SD card is missing, but I had another one to use.
B004T36GCU,6,1,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,6,2,When I first got the phone and then got my sim chip to work in it the phone was amazing.
B004T36GCU,6,3,So when I got there we discovered that the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,6,4,So now it works fine however the casing is very very flimsy.
B004T36GCU,6,5,ever since I inserted my sim card I have not been able to browse unless I use the WIFI...which I think is not the best ...please show me how to fix it or I return the phonethanks
B004T36GCU,6,6,(Seller called me and informed unlocked phones do not come with the 8GB micro SD card.)this is not a show stopper as micro SD cards are available cheap but if I had known earlier I would have ordered the card along with the phone.
B004T36GCU,6,7,Because others said their phone was good.
B004T36GCU,6,8,Now I'm stuck with this phone that I don't very much like because it does not work properly.If the phone worked at its best ability, it would be an okay phone.
B004T36GCU,6,9,Take your time in taking off the cover for the battery also it is hard to remove.
B004T36GCU,6,10,you have to be very very careful when you take the cover off to put in the SIM card or you will bend the casing and it will break easy.
B004T36GCU,6,11,So I bought it anyway hoping I would get a good one.
B004T36GCU,6,12,And cant seem to read the sim card at times.
B004T36GCU,6,13,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,6,14,Whenever I wanted to take a picture, it kept asking me to insert an SD card when in fact it was already inserted so I had to keep opening and reinserting until the phone recognized the card.
B004T36GCU,6,15,When I took it out of the box, the covering for the battery was very hard to get off.
B004T36GCU,6,16,Somehow this fell into the box, but was not listed in the seller's listing.Luckily the rest of the hardware works normally, the battery is fine, and the screen is perfect.
B004T36GCU,6,17,The orderinstant(USA) unit has a broken SD card memory slot that doesn't eject cards, you have to dig it out with a fingernail or screwdriver.
B004T36GCU,6,18,Even adding an SD card, that's still not valid.
B004T36GCU,6,19,It does not have the SD card, I'm not sure it might be that way.
B004T36GCU,6,20,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,6,21,We had to order & pay for another battery from a store in St Lucia.
B004T36GCU,6,22,And lastly, they did not include a memory card, meaning I cant even take pictures.
B004T36GCU,6,23,I reset it to factory settings and tried several other options to reclaim the voice but nothing worked.I have to return it because without voice it's not a phone, and without apps it's not a smart phone.I'm not sure what the issue is, but I did some google research and other people replaced the microphone and it worked fine.
B004T36GCU,6,24,the void sticker is placed on 2 screws one under the battery and the other on the screw at the bottom left of the SIM card.
B004T36GCU,7,0,Also I have interruption while talking, and this is all the time.
B004T36GCU,7,1,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,7,2,Due to unforseen weather conditions, it did not arrive on time.
B004T36GCU,7,3,Item not it A-1 condition.
B004T36GCU,7,4,I ordered this phone and paid for next day delivery.
B004T36GCU,7,5,Not all that great!
B004T36GCU,7,6,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,7,7,GREAT JOB, Amazon.
B004T36GCU,7,8,P.S My first time returning on amazon and I am impressed.
B004T36GCU,7,9,seller is good the product itself is bad.
B004T36GCU,7,10,Maybe I shouldn't have bought a used phone because this is my 1st time buying a used phone & the experience isn't good at all.
B004T36GCU,7,11,I wish I have never purchased it and would not recommend it.
B004T36GCU,7,12,So I bought the phone hoping I was going to be able to write a good review but it comes as if I only have a few nice things to say.
B004T36GCU,7,13,Took in to my phone carrier--they said it had water damage before I received it.
B004T36GCU,7,14,I never dropped a single one, and took great care of them.
B004T36GCU,7,15,Buy one of these and it came to me with a damaged Battery and to buy a new tube, except that I delayed the order several times.
B004T36GCU,7,16,I hope the seller exchanges this one for a better phone for me because I like this phone model.
B004T36GCU,7,17,For the price and its touted features, it falls vastly short of other products which will deliver a much more enjoyable experience.
B004T36GCU,7,18,Had to replace it.
B004T36GCU,7,19,After 2 days customer care person said that they received the proof of purcahse (my ATnT bill with date).
B004T36GCU,7,20,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,7,21,incoming call are forwarded directly to the voice mail.
B004T36GCU,7,22,Not sure if I should try another HTC (maybe this one was just the product of rush handling) or get another brand.
B004T36GCU,7,23,I will never buy an HTC product again.
B004T36GCU,7,24,Mass Production?
B004T36GCU,8,0,it's an at&t; phone , and it's says that works on T-mobile carrier too.but,
B004T36GCU,8,1,T-Mobile...uh no!
B004T36GCU,8,2,I have no service in most areas.
B004T36GCU,8,3,the phone was good not the seller.
B004T36GCU,8,4,If you are in an area with spotty service this phone doesnt work for some reason.
B004T36GCU,8,5,I think the seller should have specified this rather than giving the customer the impression that the wifi hot-spot feature on this phone is available.
B004T36GCU,8,6,I bought this phone with the understanding that T-Mobile would work just fine on it.
B004T36GCU,8,7,I live in Colombia, so HTC Service is unavailable because it is an exclusive AT&T; product.
B004T36GCU,8,8,My last Tmobile phone had issues too, I'll be dropping Tmobile once my contract is up and switching to a network that has Iphone.
B004T36GCU,8,9,I have very little service bars in my house, and even then there is an "E" where there should be 3G at the very lease.
B004T36GCU,8,10,i got an old one so i return it and ordered a new one cause that phone has awesome features; but unfortunately the one i receive now is in worse shape than last one, also missing sm card..truth be told if u dont want an old phone despite the fact u ordered a new one without sm card dont buy it from this seller,overall "HTCaspire4G" has the best feature than the phone i ever had.
B004T36GCU,8,11,Even if you live in the United States, if you want to use this feature, you will still have to go through AT&T.;
B004T36GCU,8,12,So....in short, if you have At&t; you may have more luck with this phone, if you have anything else....it's really not a great choice.
B004T36GCU,8,13,My internet occasionally just stops working, no matter if I'm at my rural house or in the city where I work.
B004T36GCU,8,14,Buy a T-mobile phone, it will save you money and a headache.
B004T36GCU,8,15,My phone provider cannot un-do the block that AT&T; has on in.
B004T36GCU,8,16,The phone its new but the problem its that the phone is not unlocked only work with AT&T; edge.
B004T36GCU,8,17,personally, i m a T-mobile user and i'm in 3G coverage still it was working on E. application like GPS,and navigation is not working properly.
B004T36GCU,8,18,Even though the phone was advertised as an unlocked phone, the wifi hotspot feature has been locked by AT&T.;
B004T36GCU,8,19,I liked the phone until the wifi stopped working after 3 months for no reason.
B004T36GCU,8,20,T-Mobile users....BEWARE!
B004T36GCU,8,21,Did not work right on T-Mobile.
B004T36GCU,8,22,So short, and the phone increases its temperature so high.I don't recommend to buy it...
B004T36GCU,8,23,I have to buy another battery, but the screen really consumes a lot of energy.
B004T36GCU,8,24,The problem is, when I pick up the phone, the signal drops to either one bar or it shows no service.
B004T36GCU,9,0,It has lots of RAM, a fast processor, and a great camera in good lighting.I've owned three HTC Inspires in less than 9 months.
B004T36GCU,9,1,It is incredibly slow for the processor it has.
B004T36GCU,9,2,This is absolutely frustrating.I used to love HTC phones, I even liked HTC One X but now I will never go with HTC again.
B004T36GCU,9,3,Even though this phone has an S2, it's on par with a lower-end dual core, and most games run well.
B004T36GCU,9,4,budget phone with 4G capability for those who need a 4G experience and don't expect this phone to handle everything you throw at it.My Experiences (Chronological Order):Asphalt 6 starting to lag severelyHome Screen Freezing and lagging116 Seconds to boot upNice photosGood flashlightNoise-Canceling works little-bitFast Wi-Fi recieverVery fast 4GI hope this helps your decision  -Jayanth Annadurai____Note:_____(Unlocking the Bootloader[Go to HTCdev.com and follow the instructions with other devices] significantly increases performance about 20%, however game stability, such as Where's my Water 2, is severely reduced)
B004T36GCU,9,5,If you can't be satisfied with Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), you'll want to skip this phone.
B004T36GCU,9,6,it's an at&t; phone , and it's says that works on T-mobile carrier too.but,
B004T36GCU,9,7,My first smart phone was a Droid Incredible, so I thought this would be a good choice.
B004T36GCU,9,8,The texting is incredibly glitchy as well; mis-types, and buttons not functioning the same way all the time make this phone a better paper weight.
B004T36GCU,9,9,Personally, I'm not satisfied with a phone that is that picky about where I hold it.For the more adventurous who consider rooting their phone and trying to upgrade the Android OS, this is not a phone to choose.
B004T36GCU,9,10,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,9,11,For those of you who want to know the point: A budget 4G Phone lacking in speed but with a nice cameraOkay this phone is a medium budget phone for people who crave the power of 4G, yet they are on a budget.
B004T36GCU,9,12,The process to get the phone rooted is so complex that I gave up considering it.
B004T36GCU,9,13,HTC INSPIRE "4G" UNLOCKED.
B004T36GCU,9,14,This is NOT a HTC Inspire 4G!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,9,15,Even with a 780p display, the colors are vivid with the S-LCD screen.*Conclusion*A
B004T36GCU,9,16,I got HTC Inspire July 2011 and after using for 14 months, it died.
B004T36GCU,9,17,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,9,18,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,9,19,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,9,20,I will never buy an HTC product again.
B004T36GCU,9,21,it's too slow.
B004T36GCU,9,22,The phone its new but the problem its that the phone is not unlocked only work with AT&T; edge.
B004T36GCU,9,23,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,9,24,Lacks in Speed and Support but recovers with 4G and 8 MP Camera w/F.
B004T36GCU,10,0,I love to have that phone.
B004T36GCU,10,1,The phone looks good.
B004T36GCU,10,2,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,10,3,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,10,4,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,10,5,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,10,6,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,10,7,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,10,8,I hate this phone.
B004T36GCU,10,9,Maybe I shouldn't have bought a used phone because this is my 1st time buying a used phone & the experience isn't good at all.
B004T36GCU,10,10,The phone freezes all the time so i have to take the battery out to unfreeze it.
B004T36GCU,10,11,Before I made the purchase, I read all the specifications to ensure it had this specific feature.
B004T36GCU,10,12,Just because there are a few good reviews, I decided to give it a shot...won't be doing that again!
B004T36GCU,10,13,This is absolutely frustrating.I used to love HTC phones, I even liked HTC One X but now I will never go with HTC again.
B004T36GCU,10,14,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,10,15,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,10,16,So I bought the phone hoping I was going to be able to write a good review but it comes as if I only have a few nice things to say.
B004T36GCU,10,17,It didn't work for me so I don't recommend it.
B004T36GCU,10,18,So when I got there we discovered that the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,10,19,AT&T; - got a replacement.Inspire #2: Great phone for a week.
B004T36GCU,10,20,I wish I have never purchased it and would not recommend it.
B004T36GCU,10,21,I'm not going to go through the hassle of doing that.On the other side, I thought the interface was very easy to use and I really wish it would have worked out for me.
B004T36GCU,10,22,It was sopoussed to be phones working perfectly
B004T36GCU,10,23,My husband has to take the battery out every time he wants to use the phone...very frustrating.
B004T36GCU,10,24,Not a good buy.
B004T36GCU,11,0,Great camera
B004T36GCU,11,1,Phone is too square for me, I prefer taller and skinny easier to hold.
B004T36GCU,11,2,If you can learn to hold this phone only near the top of the case, it will work.
B004T36GCU,11,3,The user's guide describes the GSM antenna as being in the bottom cover that covers the sim slot.
B004T36GCU,11,4,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,11,5,Easier said then done if you have a hard plastic case like I did, until I had to remove it so many times to get to the battery.-
B004T36GCU,11,6,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,11,7,when I attempt to type a new url in the browser, instead of the "enter" triangle-shaped button, it gives me the refresh button and i literally cannot go to the new website.
B004T36GCU,11,8,So I bought the phone hoping I was going to be able to write a good review but it comes as if I only have a few nice things to say.
B004T36GCU,11,9,I was adjusting the volume on Spotify and the plastic volume rocker just...fell out of the phone, and it's difficult to replace.-Called
B004T36GCU,11,10,Not my Kind.
B004T36GCU,11,11,there are many fantastic apps you can get for these phones and it's far less restricted from apple's market from what I understand.
B004T36GCU,11,12,If you can't be satisfied with Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), you'll want to skip this phone.
B004T36GCU,11,13,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,11,14,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,11,15,It's also my first smart phone I've owned, and I'm pretty biased towards the Android market; I have no plans of ever owning an iPhone.
B004T36GCU,11,16,But I will likely look for another phone because of an issue with bad reception.My house is in an area where cell signals are not very strong.
B004T36GCU,11,17,Take your time in taking off the cover for the battery also it is hard to remove.
B004T36GCU,11,18,It doesn't have a front facing camera which is difficult and the damn thing shuts off when it wants to.
B004T36GCU,11,19,There is a lot of dust trapped between the camera lens and the cover glass, resulting in grainy pictures.
B004T36GCU,11,20,The minute I cupped my hand around the back of the phone, as you would when talking on the phone, the signal would drop significantly.
B004T36GCU,11,21,So short, and the phone increases its temperature so high.I don't recommend to buy it...
B004T36GCU,11,22,I wound up using a SIP provider with free incoming calls, routed missed calls to Google Voice, which then rang the SIP client on my phone.
B004T36GCU,11,23,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,11,24,I have to buy another battery, but the screen really consumes a lot of energy.
B004T36GCU,12,0,This phone has one of the biggest screens on the market right now, which is great if you surf the web mainly on your phone.
B004T36GCU,12,1,It is glitchy, constantly turning itself off in the middle of browsing, texting, or videos.
B004T36GCU,12,2,why cant i browse using my mobile network data?
B004T36GCU,12,3,I think the seller should have specified this rather than giving the customer the impression that the wifi hot-spot feature on this phone is available.
B004T36GCU,12,4,Before I made the purchase, I read all the specifications to ensure it had this specific feature.
B004T36GCU,12,5,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,12,6,But then i started adding apps and connecting my e-mail and the voice went out (microphone).
B004T36GCU,12,7,When I started using the phone, a lot of things weren't functioning like picture text, no internet connection even when there is a wifi service to connect to, sometimes the phone will automatically cancel my calls & voicemails, very  very slow internet service, social networks wont log in and host of other problems.
B004T36GCU,12,8,It has 768 MB of RAM, the more RAM; The more stuff you can do at one time [Multiple Tabs on the Internet, Playing a game while talking, having 30 apps open, etc.].
B004T36GCU,12,9,Making it nearly impossible to download anything or make calls or text.
B004T36GCU,12,10,Buy a T-mobile phone, it will save you money and a headache.
B004T36GCU,12,11,I've gone an entire day without touching it and come back at the end of the day and its in the yellow.
B004T36GCU,12,12,there are many fantastic apps you can get for these phones and it's far less restricted from apple's market from what I understand.
B004T36GCU,12,13,BATTERY SUCKS!!! WIFI DOESNT WORK!!!! WASTE OF $$ DONT BUY.
B004T36GCU,12,14,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,12,15,Don't be fooled; too quick to market with this one.
B004T36GCU,12,16,The information is very deceiving and I am frustrated to say the least.
B004T36GCU,12,17,I don't wanna pay for a real expensive data plan and I don't use internet too much, but like to have it when I'm out and in a wifi zone.
B004T36GCU,12,18,And cant seem to read the sim card at times.
B004T36GCU,12,19,Then after about 2 wks. it would no longer let me send picture text.
B004T36GCU,12,20,I faxed them (they don't have a facility where I can just scan and email them which is a very big pain because you don't know if at all they received the fax until somebody confirms it).
B004T36GCU,12,21,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,12,22,With that said, there are a few minor things that I have no doubt HTC will be able to upgrade in the future.-Sometimes,
B004T36GCU,12,23,When I first got the phone and then got my sim chip to work in it the phone was amazing.
B004T36GCU,12,24,Wifi hotspot feature is locked by AT&T; I purchased this phone for the purpose of being able to use it as a wifi hot-spot.
B004T36GCU,13,0,It seemed like the phone had been thrown in there, with a slightly off-set screen protector, slightly dusty too.Was it new?
B004T36GCU,13,1,Poor accessories, and missing accessories.
B004T36GCU,13,2,Phone was never dropped, in a hard protective case from day 1, screen protector from day 1 and now less than 6 months later the phone itself will not charge the battery.
B004T36GCU,13,3,Two phones has scratches, and sometimes turn off.plus is quite slow during use.
B004T36GCU,13,4,The back camera is not mounted centered behind the lens glass, partly obstructed by the lens frame of the back cover.
B004T36GCU,13,5,It was sopoussed to be phones working perfectly
B004T36GCU,13,6,There is a lot of dust trapped between the camera lens and the cover glass, resulting in grainy pictures.
B004T36GCU,13,7,I have problems with this phone I bought on February 15.
B004T36GCU,13,8,But last week while the phone was loaded heated at a temperature too high, it was impossible to touch the high temperature that had.
B004T36GCU,13,9,The centers of the torx case screws are stripped out so you can never take the phone apart again.
B004T36GCU,13,10,HTC used sent instead of new. the phone sent to me was used, while I paid for new, no manual, charger very dirty, scratches on the screen.
B004T36GCU,13,11,I have problems with this phone.
B004T36GCU,13,12,Very disappointed, I feel cheated.
B004T36GCU,13,13,But I'd like a BIG problem solved.
B004T36GCU,13,14,I started using it disconnect, but the phone is not turned on, and only works if it is charging.
B004T36GCU,13,15,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,13,16,I was taking the protective plastic off the phone when the back came off.
B004T36GCU,13,17,I have to buy another battery, but the screen really consumes a lot of energy.
B004T36GCU,13,18,Programs are slow, multitasking sucks, and eventually the screen will start to sense slight twisting and things like that.
B004T36GCU,13,19,You have to do tricks shutting networks on and off and clearing the cache constantly to get things to work.
B004T36GCU,13,20,So I got this phone a few months ago, and since the beginning it's been giving me problems when I make calls.
B004T36GCU,13,21,Casing flimsy - Battery BAD.
B004T36GCU,13,22,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,13,23,Take your time in taking off the cover for the battery also it is hard to remove.
B004T36GCU,13,24,Even with a 780p display, the colors are vivid with the S-LCD screen.*Conclusion*A
B004T36GCU,14,0,GPS doesn't work.
B004T36GCU,14,1,The updates.
B004T36GCU,14,2,this phone is unable to download certain apps in the play store.
B004T36GCU,14,3,GPS is dead and it is not being recognized with any navigation app (google map, waze, gps status, etc) Nothing!!!
B004T36GCU,14,4,Was unable to delete pre loaded apps to free up space, wasn't able to open attachments either.
B004T36GCU,14,5,Almost all the apps are outdated, and I can't update the phone because its equipped with At&t; software.
B004T36GCU,14,6,Updates majorly slow this phone down.
B004T36GCU,14,7,Too many software issues.
B004T36GCU,14,8,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,14,9,It has 768 MB of RAM, the more RAM; The more stuff you can do at one time [Multiple Tabs on the Internet, Playing a game while talking, having 30 apps open, etc.].
B004T36GCU,14,10,The biggest problem is that it likes to freeze during using the navigation and while making calls.
B004T36GCU,14,11,My "maps" application also bugged out on me after about 6 months.
B004T36GCU,14,12,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,14,13,Support? GPS became useless after the AT&T; update to 2.3 there is no further updating for this phone.There are hacked updates that lose functionality of things like the video recording and what not,but what's the point in that.
B004T36GCU,14,14,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,14,15,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,14,16,BEWARE: THIS PHONE HAS NO OFFICIAL SUPPORT ANYMORE; that's right- after 2.3.5, no more Android Versions.
B004T36GCU,14,17,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,14,18,Buy a T-mobile phone, it will save you money and a headache.
B004T36GCU,14,19,You have to do tricks shutting networks on and off and clearing the cache constantly to get things to work.
B004T36GCU,14,20,When I play music random things keep popping up and pausing my music.The battery only last half the day.
B004T36GCU,14,21,This phone has been a major frustration though I've had it for only a year.
B004T36GCU,14,22,I would try to search for something but it would blink on and off.
B004T36GCU,14,23,Again, ok for just making calls.
B004T36GCU,14,24,Ok for just a phone to make and take calls.
B004T36GCU,15,0,not such a great smartphone.
B004T36GCU,15,1,I wish I have never purchased it and would not recommend it.
B004T36GCU,15,2,Not a good buy.
B004T36GCU,15,3,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,15,4,Had bought as a new product.Very dissappointed.
B004T36GCU,15,5,It didn't work for me so I don't recommend it.
B004T36GCU,15,6,Not recommended at all.
B004T36GCU,15,7,I wouldnt buy it again.
B004T36GCU,15,8,I don't think I will be purchasing anything else from Amazon.
B004T36GCU,15,9,PHONE ALWAYS HOTTHE WIFI NEVER WORKED: I BOUGHT THE PHONE MAINLY FOR ITS PORTABLE HOTSPOT WHICH DOESNT WORK PLUS 4G WHICH IS THE ONLY BENEFIT IVE GOT FOR THE MONEY IVE WASTED ON AN AWEFUL PRODUCT.
B004T36GCU,15,10,Not all that great!
B004T36GCU,15,11,I have bought a few other things on amazon and this carrier and phone has done nothing but stress me out.
B004T36GCU,15,12,I purchased this phone and it came with a broken lcd display; I payed almost 30% of the phone value to replace.
B004T36GCU,15,13,Wasn't worth my money.
B004T36GCU,15,14,Good phone, but it came broken.
B004T36GCU,15,15,Maybe I shouldn't have bought a used phone because this is my 1st time buying a used phone & the experience isn't good at all.
B004T36GCU,15,16,My first smart phone was a Droid Incredible, so I thought this would be a good choice.
B004T36GCU,15,17,Only to keep it or return it for my money back.
B004T36GCU,15,18,VERY UPSET BECAUSE THIS WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR A USED PHONE.
B004T36GCU,15,19,Buy a T-mobile phone, it will save you money and a headache.
B004T36GCU,15,20,It's badly refurbished, probably by a hobbyist.I also have an Inspire that I bought new from AT&T; almost two years ago with none of the following problems, so I also have an originally purchased unit to compare to.
B004T36GCU,15,21,PRODUCT DOES NOT KEEP A CHARGE AND I HAVE REPLACES THE BATTERY.
B004T36GCU,15,22,things, but when its about electronics, things just seem as though it is hard for someone to co-operate with you.
B004T36GCU,15,23,At first when purchasing this phone, I was very excited.
B004T36GCU,15,24,It's also my first smart phone I've owned, and I'm pretty biased towards the Android market; I have no plans of ever owning an iPhone.
B004T36GCU,16,0,Battery issue.
B004T36GCU,16,1,Battery issues.
B004T36GCU,16,2,Battery Problems.
B004T36GCU,16,3,Battery life is about 3/4 of a day with normal use.
B004T36GCU,16,4,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,16,5,Phone would not charge after first day of use.
B004T36GCU,16,6,BATTERY ISSUES.
B004T36GCU,16,7,The phone freezes all the time so i have to take the battery out to unfreeze it.
B004T36GCU,16,8,I placed in the battery and put the phone to charge, but it then shut off and would not come on at all.
B004T36GCU,16,9,Am having battery problem. the battery does not last not even 3 hours straight i have to be keep charging the phone
B004T36GCU,16,10,I started using it disconnect, but the phone is not turned on, and only works if it is charging.
B004T36GCU,16,11,PRODUCT DOES NOT KEEP A CHARGE AND I HAVE REPLACES THE BATTERY.
B004T36GCU,16,12,THIS PHONE ONLY CAME WITH ISSUES!!!!!!!!THE BATTERY DIES IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE AND MUST BE CHARGED DAILY.
B004T36GCU,16,13,The particular one you sent to me was not charging when I plugged it to the electricity.
B004T36GCU,16,14,And the battery is terrible, barely lasts a day after charging.
B004T36GCU,16,15,HTC Failure. the battery or if the mobile is not working defectuso, restarts or shuts down the battery is totalemte auque charged, also sometimes happens when connected the charger.
B004T36GCU,16,16,too slow phone dont buy it and battery finish in 6 or 7 hour you have too charge too many time
B004T36GCU,16,17,The time of charge is low, when I use wifi i have only 4 hours and when I talk 8 hours, but I don't talk continuos.
B004T36GCU,16,18,The battery life spam is horrible, stays on for no more than 12 hours with little to no phone usage.
B004T36GCU,16,19,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,16,20,Phone was never dropped, in a hard protective case from day 1, screen protector from day 1 and now less than 6 months later the phone itself will not charge the battery.
B004T36GCU,16,21,The only way to resolve the freeze issue is to take the battery completely out which eventually wore out my battery clip holder.I had to purchase another one.
B004T36GCU,16,22,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,16,23,Charge goes fast.
B004T36GCU,16,24,Plugged it back in, showed 95% power on meter, phone powers back on normal.
B004T36GCU,17,0,thank you for getting my phone on time,but the one thing it doesn't work very good.If u put the phone on speaker people can't hear you. is very bad that u cannot put your phone on speaker.Last buy from this seller.
B004T36GCU,17,1,problem on phone.
B004T36GCU,17,2,Constant cutting off and glitches over the line.
B004T36GCU,17,3,terrible.
B004T36GCU,17,4,Horrible.
B004T36GCU,17,5,Phone would reboot in the mid of a conversation.
B004T36GCU,17,6,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,17,7,Phone constantly reboot or power off.
B004T36GCU,17,8,Remove software that are in use.
B004T36GCU,17,9,Poor reception makes this a phone to avoid.
B004T36GCU,17,10,The phone freezes all the time so i have to take the battery out to unfreeze it.
B004T36GCU,17,11,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,17,12,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,17,13,I get a lot of dropped calls also.
B004T36GCU,17,14,Needless to say, about 4 out of 10 calls I recieve wind up coming through the VoIP line - which means it missed the original call.
B004T36GCU,17,15,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,17,16,The micro-usb jack is jacked so that all my cords end up flopping out and have to be held in just right in order for it to charge.
B004T36GCU,17,17,I have to buy another battery, but the screen really consumes a lot of energy.
B004T36GCU,17,18,We have had this phone for almost two months and the phone has decided to power off each time it goes into hibernate.
B004T36GCU,17,19,Take your time in taking off the cover for the battery also it is hard to remove.
B004T36GCU,17,20,I started using it disconnect, but the phone is not turned on, and only works if it is charging.
B004T36GCU,17,21,Also I have interruption while talking, and this is all the time.
B004T36GCU,17,22,battery can die within a hour , I downloaded music and it would skip and replay music on its own , no screenshot , speaker volume sucks... Looks good bit not a great smartphone I've seen better on amazon.
B004T36GCU,17,23,So I got this phone a few months ago, and since the beginning it's been giving me problems when I make calls.
B004T36GCU,17,24,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,18,0,Because others said their phone was good.
B004T36GCU,18,1,So when I got there we discovered that the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,18,2,I recomend Nokia N8 it is much better you only need to put the simm and turn it on.
B004T36GCU,18,3,The camera is decent, but the flash is a true champion, with two LEDs that are visible from at least half a mile away.
B004T36GCU,18,4,Just because there are a few good reviews, I decided to give it a shot...won't be doing that again!
B004T36GCU,18,5,Takes good pics, i just cant share them with anyone.
B004T36GCU,18,6,Casing flimsy - Battery BAD.
B004T36GCU,18,7,You can do video calls on this phone but it does not have a front facing camera so you have to turn the phone to the backside so the person you are talking to can see you.What a disappointment because the main purpose for buying the phone was to save money on international calls by using Skype or other free video calls.
B004T36GCU,18,8,And lastly, they did not include a memory card, meaning I cant even take pictures.
B004T36GCU,18,9,So I bought it anyway hoping I would get a good one.
B004T36GCU,18,10,camera is capable of taking breath taking pictures, it's the equivalent of having a digital camera in itself.
B004T36GCU,18,11,So am increasing the stars from 1 to 2
B004T36GCU,18,12,I get a lot of dropped calls also.
B004T36GCU,18,13,Price and quality comparison is very bad. the Cables included are defective.
B004T36GCU,18,14,So now it works fine however the casing is very very flimsy.
B004T36GCU,18,15,Very disappointed, I feel cheated.
B004T36GCU,18,16,=(ALL of that being said, this phone has it quirks but honestly, I don't regret buying it, I got a good deal on it and it has really helped launch me into the "smart" world.
B004T36GCU,18,17,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,18,18,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,18,19,Even with a 780p display, the colors are vivid with the S-LCD screen.*Conclusion*A
B004T36GCU,18,20,I have to buy another battery, but the screen really consumes a lot of energy.
B004T36GCU,18,21,This isn't really a big deal to me but for some people it could be, I suppose.-And of course....the battery life is pretty terrible.
B004T36GCU,18,22,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,18,23,BATTERY SUCKS!!! WIFI DOESNT WORK!!!! WASTE OF $$ DONT BUY.
B004T36GCU,18,24,OVERALL: I love the weight of the phone (not as light as some others which is good since I like to keep my phone for a few years).
B004T36GCU,19,0,It does not have the SD card, I'm not sure it might be that way.
B004T36GCU,19,1,The 8gig SD card is missing, but I had another one to use.
B004T36GCU,19,2,Even adding an SD card, that's still not valid.
B004T36GCU,19,3,And cant seem to read the sim card at times.
B004T36GCU,19,4,No Micro SD CardM.
B004T36GCU,19,5,I don't like this phone because it wouldn't ready my memory card.
B004T36GCU,19,6,And lastly, they did not include a memory card, meaning I cant even take pictures.
B004T36GCU,19,7,The area of the SD card slot was already scratched up from the previous owner digging the card out, obviously from the same problem.
B004T36GCU,19,8,Whenever I wanted to take a picture, it kept asking me to insert an SD card when in fact it was already inserted so I had to keep opening and reinserting until the phone recognized the card.
B004T36GCU,19,9,the void sticker is placed on 2 screws one under the battery and the other on the screw at the bottom left of the SIM card.
B004T36GCU,19,10,(Seller called me and informed unlocked phones do not come with the 8GB micro SD card.)this is not a show stopper as micro SD cards are available cheap but if I had known earlier I would have ordered the card along with the phone.
B004T36GCU,19,11,The orderinstant(USA) unit has a broken SD card memory slot that doesn't eject cards, you have to dig it out with a fingernail or screwdriver.
B004T36GCU,19,12,Doesn't have enough memory space.
B004T36GCU,19,13,First, the box of the pone came open, I mean, the phone box, not the amazon box.
B004T36GCU,19,14,Second, no Micro SD card was in the box, and the box states it brings one, and third, I can not get to connect the phone to wi-fi.
B004T36GCU,19,15,antenna (sim card ?)used 5 before requesting return which was granted but at a high cost.
B004T36GCU,19,16,Disappointed when I open the box.
B004T36GCU,19,17,If I knew that I would have to invest another $20-$40 in memory, I would have not purchased this item for this price...
B004T36GCU,19,18,If they did, I would not buy it since I don't want a ATT phone.
B004T36GCU,19,19,If this was listed as a refurb with associated price the problems would have been acceptable.
B004T36GCU,19,20,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,19,21,It should snap in place tightly to hold the battery in place
B004T36GCU,19,22,This phone within a week of purchase it start stripping some of the apps does not work, I would not recommend for anyone to purchase
B004T36GCU,19,23,When I frist got the phone, it was working fine, I could send picture texts.
B004T36GCU,19,24,It didn't work for me so I don't recommend it.
B004T36GCU,20,0,Buy one of these and it came to me with a damaged Battery and to buy a new tube, except that I delayed the order several times.
B004T36GCU,20,1,When I called them, they said that they have all the proof but they have to submit it to repair department and repair department will give me a call In 5 to 10 days (now see this, before sending the phone they said that complete process will take just 2 weeks right from sending the device to receiving it after repair).So even after discussing with 2 different customer care executives, now again I am waiting for the repair department call and again I have to repeat myself to convince them that device is in warranty.
B004T36GCU,20,2,So I got this phone a few months ago, and since the beginning it's been giving me problems when I make calls.
B004T36GCU,20,3,After 2 days customer care person said that they received the proof of purcahse (my ATnT bill with date).
B004T36GCU,20,4,What a pathetic service?
B004T36GCU,20,5,Now when I talked to the customer service they asked me the date of purchase and said that although the date of manufacturing is already passed out of warranty (it was May 2011), you will still have the warranty because you purchased the device on July 2011 from ATnT store.
B004T36GCU,20,6,The box was open and the item came with a fake battery.
B004T36GCU,20,7,It was not charging up and I called up HTC and they asked me to send my device for repair.
B004T36GCU,20,8,I get a lot of dropped calls also.
B004T36GCU,20,9,I have problems with this phone I bought on February 15.
B004T36GCU,20,10,The UPS guy came by each time that I wasn't home which made it hard to return it.
B004T36GCU,20,11,First of all their phone died in just 14 months and now they are not even readily accepting it to repair in warranty?
B004T36GCU,20,12,They also confirmed that my phone is in the warranty and I can send in my phone.I sent my phone and after 3 days of the delivery confirmation, I got an update that my device is out of warranty.
B004T36GCU,20,13,After arguing with the customer care executive for 15-20 minutes and asking him to talk to his supervisor, finally I got my phone repaired without any charge.
B004T36GCU,20,14,Which means I have to buy that from the amazon marketplace or run after the seller to send me one.
B004T36GCU,20,15,I have bought this phone two months ago.The battery was damaged.
B004T36GCU,20,16,HTC :- Worst Customer Service and Phone.
B004T36GCU,20,17,Had to replace it.
B004T36GCU,20,18,I will be returning this item because I paid to much for a used phone.
B004T36GCU,20,19,When I took it out of the box, the covering for the battery was very hard to get off.
B004T36GCU,20,20,Took in to my phone carrier--they said it had water damage before I received it.
B004T36GCU,20,21,First, the box of the pone came open, I mean, the phone box, not the amazon box.
B004T36GCU,20,22,Had to be returned.
B004T36GCU,20,23,Internally Damaged Product.
B004T36GCU,20,24,Only to keep it or return it for my money back.
B004T36GCU,21,0,Did not work right on T-Mobile.
B004T36GCU,21,1,The phone is not unlocked.
B004T36GCU,21,2,Service at Home.
B004T36GCU,21,3,Was never unlocked, I had to get my own unlock code.
B004T36GCU,21,4,Still missed about 50% of the calls.
B004T36GCU,21,5,Sometimes it just misses a call.
B004T36GCU,21,6,is not unlocked as they said.
B004T36GCU,21,7,The phone its new but the problem its that the phone is not unlocked only work with AT&T; edge.
B004T36GCU,21,8,I wish it worked.
B004T36GCU,21,9,Even though the phone was advertised as an unlocked phone, the wifi hotspot feature has been locked by AT&T.;
B004T36GCU,21,10,The phone I got was actually locked to at&t.;
B004T36GCU,21,11,I try to start with tigo, comcel and movistar but the phone didnt work
B004T36GCU,21,12,If they did, I would not buy it since I don't want a ATT phone.
B004T36GCU,21,13,I liked the phone until the wifi stopped working after 3 months for no reason.
B004T36GCU,21,14,Wifi hotspot feature is locked by AT&T; I purchased this phone for the purpose of being able to use it as a wifi hot-spot.
B004T36GCU,21,15,Thank for your help.
B004T36GCU,21,16,Need a help.
B004T36GCU,21,17,The problem is, when I pick up the phone, the signal drops to either one bar or it shows no service.
B004T36GCU,21,18,I have problems with this phone I bought on February 15.
B004T36GCU,21,19,This "unlocked" phone did not work properly on T-Mobile, did not run on 4G, did not run on 3G, so it rendered the phone useless for data, it worked OK as a phone or for texting.Returned to vendor, as I was expecting better.
B004T36GCU,21,20,Weak antenna, weird problems.
B004T36GCU,21,21,When I started using the phone, a lot of things weren't functioning like picture text, no internet connection even when there is a wifi service to connect to, sometimes the phone will automatically cancel my calls & voicemails, very  very slow internet service, social networks wont log in and host of other problems.
B004T36GCU,21,22,I had to purchase a 3-G telephone.
B004T36GCU,21,23,The wifi is the reason I wanted to get a new phone.
B004T36GCU,21,24,it's an at&t; phone , and it's says that works on T-mobile carrier too.but,
B004T36GCU,22,0,This is NOT a HTC Inspire 4G!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,22,1,HTC INSPIRE "4G" UNLOCKED.
B004T36GCU,22,2,HTC A9192 inspire.
B004T36GCU,22,3,HTC Inspire.
B004T36GCU,22,4,This phone is supposed to be 4G but I have yet to experience any 4G capabilities.
B004T36GCU,22,5,A9192 Inspire 4G Unlocked Phone with Android OS, 3G Support, 8 MP) .
B004T36GCU,22,6,Why would HTC ever make a phone with such limited use?
B004T36GCU,22,7,Lacks in Speed and Support but recovers with 4G and 8 MP Camera w/F.
B004T36GCU,22,8,Well apparently this phone was made solely for the Americans because it does not support the 2100 WCDMA frequency in Germany/Europe.
B004T36GCU,22,9,There are differences between both phones, mainly the Desire HD does NOT support 4G.
B004T36GCU,22,10,HTC Inspire.
B004T36GCU,22,11,BEWARE: THIS PHONE HAS NO OFFICIAL SUPPORT ANYMORE; that's right- after 2.3.5, no more Android Versions.
B004T36GCU,22,12,I used this phone with T-mobile.Also, they shipped me the HTC DESIRE not the HTC INSPIRE which is mentioned here.When
B004T36GCU,22,13,With that said, there are a few minor things that I have no doubt HTC will be able to upgrade in the future.-Sometimes,
B004T36GCU,22,14,I just want a replacement of the same phone.(HTC
B004T36GCU,22,15,not Inspire but HTC Desire HD.
B004T36GCU,22,16,The point of this phone is a 4G UPGRADE to the HTC Desire HD A9191 Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone with 8 MP Camera, Wi-Fi, GPS, Touchscreen--International Version with No Warranty (Black).Cons:This phone is a Single core Qualcomm Snapdragon S2 running at 1.00 GHz (For those of you that don't know; GHz is a limited view on how fast a processor is in the same family...for example the Snapdragon 800 2.3 GHz is faster than the Snapdragon 600 1.9 GHz)which is quite disappointing in terms of game play due to its outdated Adreno 205 graphics.
B004T36GCU,22,17,VoIP rings over 3G, which means the phone just has an issue with calls - not data.So, after dealing with three HTC Inspire phones, they are truly terrible, poorly-manufactured devices.
B004T36GCU,22,18,I will never buy an HTC product again.
B004T36GCU,22,19,And there are many handy things this device is capable of despite the kinks, and I look forward to what HTC and Android will have for us in the future.
B004T36GCU,22,20,AT&T; - got a replacement.Inspire #3: Major antenna issues.
B004T36GCU,22,21,Even though this phone has an S2, it's on par with a lower-end dual core, and most games run well.
B004T36GCU,22,22,-Seller called me and informed HTC unlocked phones do not come with the VOID warranty stickers on the screws.(This is an HTC phone made for ATT which was unlocked and sold)- The 8 GB SD card which comes with the ATT HTC INSPIRE phone is missing.
B004T36GCU,22,23,I was disappointed and upset when I found owas out that I deceived.
B004T36GCU,22,24,my opinion of the product.
B004T36GCU,23,0,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,23,1,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,23,2,I'm not going to go through the hassle of doing that.On the other side, I thought the interface was very easy to use and I really wish it would have worked out for me.
B004T36GCU,23,3,very bad presentation.
B004T36GCU,23,4,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,23,5,and no manual book.
B004T36GCU,23,6,This phone has been a major frustration though I've had it for only a year.
B004T36GCU,23,7,But then i started adding apps and connecting my e-mail and the voice went out (microphone).
B004T36GCU,23,8,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,23,9,The phone freezes all the time so i have to take the battery out to unfreeze it.
B004T36GCU,23,10,Too many software issues.
B004T36GCU,23,11,BATTERY SUCKS!!! WIFI DOESNT WORK!!!! WASTE OF $$ DONT BUY.
B004T36GCU,23,12,Making it nearly impossible to download anything or make calls or text.
B004T36GCU,23,13,So I bought the phone hoping I was going to be able to write a good review but it comes as if I only have a few nice things to say.
B004T36GCU,23,14,I have to buy another battery, but the screen really consumes a lot of energy.
B004T36GCU,23,15,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,23,16,Maybe I shouldn't have bought a used phone because this is my 1st time buying a used phone & the experience isn't good at all.
B004T36GCU,23,17,too slow phone dont buy it and battery finish in 6 or 7 hour you have too charge too many time
B004T36GCU,23,18,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,23,19,I started using it disconnect, but the phone is not turned on, and only works if it is charging.
B004T36GCU,23,20,I want to return the phone and I need you to change it for a new one, because the one that I have is not working and I would like you to give me a solution as soon as you can.
B004T36GCU,23,21,I try to start with tigo, comcel and movistar but the phone didnt work
B004T36GCU,23,22,I reset it to factory settings and tried several other options to reclaim the voice but nothing worked.I have to return it because without voice it's not a phone, and without apps it's not a smart phone.I'm not sure what the issue is, but I did some google research and other people replaced the microphone and it worked fine.
B004T36GCU,23,23,So now it works fine however the casing is very very flimsy.
B004T36GCU,23,24,Casing flimsy - Battery BAD.
B004T36GCU,24,0,Once it started up, I noticed that the left side of the phone did not work.
B004T36GCU,24,1,Would reset ring tone and delete ring tones.
B004T36GCU,24,2,One day, the volume rocker just fell out.
B004T36GCU,24,3,The top mounted power on/off button requires a large amount of force to push it in to get the phone to see the button press.There was a 12 volt car charger adapter in the box, which was not ever included in a new shrink-wrapped box.
B004T36GCU,24,4,After 7 months, not a single scratch could be seen on my phone.Inspire #1: Fine, except the proximity sensor never worked, causing me to accidentally hang up on calls when the screen didn't turn off.
B004T36GCU,24,5,Still missed about 50% of the calls.
B004T36GCU,24,6,Sometimes it just misses a call.
B004T36GCU,24,7,I had to press it in order to fix it in its position.
B004T36GCU,24,8,I was adjusting the volume on Spotify and the plastic volume rocker just...fell out of the phone, and it's difficult to replace.-Called
B004T36GCU,24,9,Annoying.
B004T36GCU,24,10,I wish it worked.
B004T36GCU,24,11,I never turned on this phone.
B004T36GCU,24,12,When I took it out of the box, the covering for the battery was very hard to get off.
B004T36GCU,24,13,It doesn't have a front facing camera which is difficult and the damn thing shuts off when it wants to.
B004T36GCU,24,14,Volume down was sticky and didn't always register properly.
B004T36GCU,24,15,I placed in the battery and put the phone to charge, but it then shut off and would not come on at all.
B004T36GCU,24,16,Phone constantly reboot or power off.
B004T36GCU,24,17,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,24,18,The funny thing?
B004T36GCU,24,19,The phone its new but the problem its that the phone is not unlocked only work with AT&T; edge.
B004T36GCU,24,20,I started using it disconnect, but the phone is not turned on, and only works if it is charging.
B004T36GCU,24,21,I wanted to exchange it but was not given that option.
B004T36GCU,24,22,VoIP rings over 3G, which means the phone just has an issue with calls - not data.So, after dealing with three HTC Inspire phones, they are truly terrible, poorly-manufactured devices.
B004T36GCU,24,23,I reattached only to find that it would not close properly.
B004T36GCU,24,24,They didn't give me the option to exchange.
B004T36GCU,25,0,When I frist got the phone, it was working fine, I could send picture texts.
B004T36GCU,25,1,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,25,2,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,25,3,I have to send it back.
B004T36GCU,25,4,Then after about 2 wks. it would no longer let me send picture text.
B004T36GCU,25,5,Don't waste your money.
B004T36GCU,25,6,Also, it is an unlocked phone so I was told that my picture messages will never be able to send and I will not be able to download incoming multimedia messages.
B004T36GCU,25,7,Making it nearly impossible to download anything or make calls or text.
B004T36GCU,25,8,but i can send regular text.
B004T36GCU,25,9,Features  were fine but was unable to send or receive calls so I had to return it.
B004T36GCU,25,10,But then i started adding apps and connecting my e-mail and the voice went out (microphone).
B004T36GCU,25,11,I reset it to factory settings and tried several other options to reclaim the voice but nothing worked.I have to return it because without voice it's not a phone, and without apps it's not a smart phone.I'm not sure what the issue is, but I did some google research and other people replaced the microphone and it worked fine.
B004T36GCU,25,12,Buy a T-mobile phone, it will save you money and a headache.
B004T36GCU,25,13,I bought this phone with the understanding that T-Mobile would work just fine on it.
B004T36GCU,25,14,I liked the phone until the wifi stopped working after 3 months for no reason.
B004T36GCU,25,15,When I started using the phone, a lot of things weren't functioning like picture text, no internet connection even when there is a wifi service to connect to, sometimes the phone will automatically cancel my calls & voicemails, very  very slow internet service, social networks wont log in and host of other problems.
B004T36GCU,25,16,some reason, although I have all of my contacts from facebook on my phone, many of their profile pictures wont show up beside their name or pop up when they call.
B004T36GCU,25,17,T-Mobile...uh no!
B004T36GCU,25,18,I get a lot of dropped calls also.
B004T36GCU,25,19,I faxed them (they don't have a facility where I can just scan and email them which is a very big pain because you don't know if at all they received the fax until somebody confirms it).
B004T36GCU,25,20,The time of charge is low, when I use wifi i have only 4 hours and when I talk 8 hours, but I don't talk continuos.
B004T36GCU,25,21,And the battery is terrible, barely lasts a day after charging.
B004T36GCU,25,22,Everytime I go to some of the programs and it ask me to log in, i give them the correct info and it says fail.
B004T36GCU,25,23,I want to return the phone and I need you to change it for a new one, because the one that I have is not working and I would like you to give me a solution as soon as you can.
B004T36GCU,25,24,BATTERY SUCKS!!! WIFI DOESNT WORK!!!! WASTE OF $$ DONT BUY.
B008HTJLF6,0,0,Great display.
B008HTJLF6,0,1,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,0,2,If you're looking for a good phone with a decent screen size i would recommend the s3.
B008HTJLF6,0,3,Some say it feels cheap, but I don't get that at all.
B008HTJLF6,0,4,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,0,5,It's very light and easy to hold for its size.
B008HTJLF6,0,6,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,0,7,I don't actually mind the plastic construction--doesn't feel "cheap" to me at all--but I'll likely get a TPU case for the grippiness.Shortcuts on your lockscreen is a great feature!
B008HTJLF6,0,8,Hands down.
B008HTJLF6,0,9,i love this phone!
B008HTJLF6,0,10,In fact it seems well built, but like most phones I would not want to drop it without a case.The 1080p video camera is a nice feature too, and the videos looks great!
B008HTJLF6,0,11,This is hands down the fastest, smoothest phone I've seen.
B008HTJLF6,0,12,This phone is GREAT.
B008HTJLF6,0,13,I must say I love it.
B008HTJLF6,0,14,Better than Iphone5 or any other Android phone out there.
B008HTJLF6,0,15,If you aren't used to a large screen, the S3 will take a little getting used to.
B008HTJLF6,0,16,Sure, there are ways around this, but is annoying nonetheless.Minor - so, yeah, big display, and if you have small-ish hands, 1-handed operations are risky, esp w/the somewhat slippery case.
B008HTJLF6,0,17,The display is huge, and the phone is a bit big for one-handed operations, but it's also thin and fits in your pocket no problem.
B008HTJLF6,0,18,I have several very nice cases and screen protector on this baby.. have a glass tempered one and loving it, feel I have that protection in case a drop (let's hope not).Only thing at this point I don't really like with phone so far is when I open one of my folders or close, I have the ladys voice-  Folder open/Folder closed..
B008HTJLF6,0,19,Although samsung has not updated the firmware often the os alone is already good to use.
B008HTJLF6,0,20,The inner specs are still pretty impressive, even compared to the new phones.
B008HTJLF6,0,21,It's an amazing display.
B008HTJLF6,0,22,So I can definitely say that this phone is a great phone for anyone.
B008HTJLF6,0,23,If you don't feel like reading all of the specifics, skip down to the end and just check out the pros and cons.Feel/DesignThe body of the Verizon Galaxy S3 is very smooth and fits well in your hand; it is a plastic build which allows the phone to remain light.
B008HTJLF6,0,24,it took some time getting used to but i found it a lot easier to multitask and had a lot more features then most phones.
B008HTJLF6,1,0,This is IMO the best android phone to date.
B008HTJLF6,1,1,Best Android Phone To Date.
B008HTJLF6,1,2,Better than Iphone5 or any other Android phone out there.
B008HTJLF6,1,3,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,1,4,Although samsung has not updated the firmware often the os alone is already good to use.
B008HTJLF6,1,5,Best phone on the market right now.
B008HTJLF6,1,6,Best phone on the market right now.
B008HTJLF6,1,7,Those two launchers are specifically made for the current version of android (ICS).
B008HTJLF6,1,8,This phone is GREAT.
B008HTJLF6,1,9,Since I have a Samsung tablet all my apps and pictures from my tablet automatically came up on my phone!
B008HTJLF6,1,10,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,1,11,Stock apps are almost good enough to stick with (almost, not quite, esp. the keyboard & browser).Hardware: good camera, fantastic AMOLED display.
B008HTJLF6,1,12,I know you could always do things to get better battery than I've been having, I personally don't care to root this yet or do any of the tweaks.
B008HTJLF6,1,13,it took some time getting used to but i found it a lot easier to multitask and had a lot more features then most phones.
B008HTJLF6,1,14,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,1,15,I loved that!!
B008HTJLF6,1,16,No ring/vibrate switch from the lockscreen either.Anyway, plenty of software nits that can be fixed by downloading replacement apps or rooting.
B008HTJLF6,1,17,Great display.
B008HTJLF6,1,18,Except you have to unlock the phone to actually launch the apps.
B008HTJLF6,1,19,It is simple to use too, my mom who is a die hard apple fan actually used it for ten minutes and lets just say she no longer uses her Iphone.
B008HTJLF6,1,20,I'm really loving this phone even though few little things that bug me.
B008HTJLF6,1,21,Excellent.
B008HTJLF6,1,22,I received it set the phone up the same day easy conversion from my Droid X; I used the My Backup Pro app to convert applications and data.
B008HTJLF6,1,23,You can arrange your songs/movies according to folders or anything else you like..Picture/camera: awesome organization, can be according to faces, dates, anything really...Superb quality..really the best and easiest camera to work with by far.
B008HTJLF6,1,24,Multitasking is superb as well; you can call and search the web or listen to your navigation while ur on the phone...ridiculous!Voice Interface: I'd estimate like a 96-98% accuracy of the Google voice search (which is EXTREMELY high and crushes "siri" any day).
B008HTJLF6,2,0,This phone is GREAT.
B008HTJLF6,2,1,Phone is really great and I think probably the best outta smartphones I've had.. had about 6-7 so far.Battery on this phone is probably best I've experienced with this phone here.
B008HTJLF6,2,2,I've had this phone for over a month now.. month and few weeks maybe.
B008HTJLF6,2,3,Maybe it was just the degree of upgrade after 2 years, but whatever, it's a fantastic phone that I was happy to pay full price for at launch, instead of waiting a month or two for it to get discounted.Edit: 7/26.
B008HTJLF6,2,4,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,2,5,Oh, and it looks great.
B008HTJLF6,2,6,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,2,7,I don't actually mind the plastic construction--doesn't feel "cheap" to me at all--but I'll likely get a TPU case for the grippiness.Shortcuts on your lockscreen is a great feature!
B008HTJLF6,2,8,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,2,9,I was a little discouraged about getting a phone this big but after purchasing it.
B008HTJLF6,2,10,I'm really loving this phone even though few little things that bug me.
B008HTJLF6,2,11,Although samsung has not updated the firmware often the os alone is already good to use.
B008HTJLF6,2,12,Great phone, 5* despite nitpicks.
B008HTJLF6,2,13,Personally I'm very happy and think this phone is top of the line :).
B008HTJLF6,2,14,Fantastic upgrade from my Droid X.  ICS by itself is worth the price ($199 from the Verizon store, btw).
B008HTJLF6,2,15,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,2,16,i love this phone!
B008HTJLF6,2,17,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,2,18,I got my phone from eBay brand new, I got the 32GB pebble blue on Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,2,19,My other phones would be about dead just about, I'd be hurrying to charge a spare up after 8 or 9 hours.I really love the slick design of the phone.. some people say very cheap feeling or quality but I feel complete opposite and they are probably idiots anyways.
B008HTJLF6,2,20,This is IMO the best android phone to date.
B008HTJLF6,2,21,Best Android Phone To Date.
B008HTJLF6,2,22,I used to work for Verizon, and I've tested a lot of phones.
B008HTJLF6,2,23,Buy a protector.
B008HTJLF6,2,24,Except you have to unlock the phone to actually launch the apps.
B008HTJLF6,3,0,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,3,1,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,3,2,The speed is amazing, battery life is about 2 days for me, and I haven't had a single crash since I bought it.
B008HTJLF6,3,3,i actually takes a lot longer then i would have expected compared to the commercials and the battery life can be drained fairly quickly.
B008HTJLF6,3,4,The only time my battery life isn't wonderful is when the phone is maxed out searching for signal on Coronado.
B008HTJLF6,3,5,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,3,6,I can usually comfortably get through a whole day of moderate usage with maybe 15-30 percent left.
B008HTJLF6,3,7,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,3,8,Moderate use: playing games, making calls, using Tapatalk, checking my Google+, Twitter, Flipboard, and reading other news articles, I can usually get a good 16 hours of battery life.OSI could write several pages just on how much better ICS is than any other Android build I've used, but I'm going to leave it to you to research this.
B008HTJLF6,3,9,Doing a speed test, I routinely get around 12 Mbps; that is as fast as my home internet connection.Battery Life2100 mAh battery.
B008HTJLF6,3,10,My other phones would be about dead just about, I'd be hurrying to charge a spare up after 8 or 9 hours.I really love the slick design of the phone.. some people say very cheap feeling or quality but I feel complete opposite and they are probably idiots anyways.
B008HTJLF6,3,11,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,3,12,I've been going a full day on a single charge with medium-heavy usage with plenty to spare.
B008HTJLF6,3,13,This phone is GREAT.
B008HTJLF6,3,14,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,3,15,Phone is really great and I think probably the best outta smartphones I've had.. had about 6-7 so far.Battery on this phone is probably best I've experienced with this phone here.
B008HTJLF6,3,16,I've had this phone for over a month now.. month and few weeks maybe.
B008HTJLF6,3,17,Doing a looped video test, I can squeeze about 9 hours 15 minutes out of my phone.
B008HTJLF6,3,18,The dual-core cpu does a great job at giving great speed and performance with virtually no lag.
B008HTJLF6,3,19,Since I turned the phone on it has been wonderful!
B008HTJLF6,3,20,The home screens run smoothly even using Go Launcher as a home replacement.
B008HTJLF6,3,21,I am really impressed.
B008HTJLF6,3,22,This phone has been perfect so far.
B008HTJLF6,3,23,Almost a shame to put a case on it.Good battery life.
B008HTJLF6,3,24,I get better signal than I did on my Nexus.Touchwiz is a bit clunky; but as I mentioned above that can be easily remedied by using Apex or Nova.Overall, I would recommend this phone to ANYONE.
B008HTJLF6,4,0,The quality of the pictures is also fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,4,1,In fact it seems well built, but like most phones I would not want to drop it without a case.The 1080p video camera is a nice feature too, and the videos looks great!
B008HTJLF6,4,2,Another disappointment to me is the way the speaker is placed; it's on the rear of the phone and if you have the phone on a flat table, it muffles the sound from the speaker.ScreenYou're going to be working with a 4.8-inch Super AMOLED HD display.
B008HTJLF6,4,3,My S3 outperforms my wife's iPhone 4S in picture quality by far.GimmicksS Voice - The microphone picks up too much ambient noise, especially when driving.
B008HTJLF6,4,4,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,4,5,The speaker on the back is loud, the sound is amazing, the earbuds this comes with are actually pretty good, the processing power is phenominal.The camera is also the best of any phone...its essentially the iPhone 4S's camera...that Samsung made for them...but tweaked to use more cool features.The front camera works wonders with Tango and Google+...both are Android/Google's "Facetime" and work with anyone who has a front camera, unlike Facetime, which requires iOS.The people that give this bad reviews are doing so because of Verizon, not the phone itself.
B008HTJLF6,4,6,Decent speaker for speakerphone or listening to podcasts.
B008HTJLF6,4,7,The home screens run smoothly even using Go Launcher as a home replacement.
B008HTJLF6,4,8,This review is based on an unrooted phone on Verizon Wireless.
B008HTJLF6,4,9,I get better signal than I did on my Nexus.Touchwiz is a bit clunky; but as I mentioned above that can be easily remedied by using Apex or Nova.Overall, I would recommend this phone to ANYONE.
B008HTJLF6,4,10,You can arrange your songs/movies according to folders or anything else you like..Picture/camera: awesome organization, can be according to faces, dates, anything really...Superb quality..really the best and easiest camera to work with by far.
B008HTJLF6,4,11,One of the biggest reasons I wanted a phone upgrade was the camera.
B008HTJLF6,4,12,The only time I do not get 4G is when I'm on the island of Coronado, and even then it just cuts in and out.
B008HTJLF6,4,13,The Samsung Galaxy S3 is without a doubt the best phone for ME.
B008HTJLF6,4,14,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,4,15,The speed on the S3 camera is stellar.
B008HTJLF6,4,16,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,4,17,It's also capable of 4G LTE speeds so the internet is blazing fast as well.Most of my friends have iphones, and they were envious of the looks/screen on this phone.
B008HTJLF6,4,18,Best phone on the market!
B008HTJLF6,4,19,The fact that u can so easily switch between recording and picture taking is so awesome.Security: you can set it at whatever level of security you want: pins, face recognition, voice recognition, etc...Apps: it has any app you can possible want like recording phone calls, changing your voice, recording class lecture, games, academics...etc.
B008HTJLF6,4,20,I still keep a few on cuz they come in handy.The device is also incredible fast and smooth, and the screen looks perfect.
B008HTJLF6,4,21,My other phones would be about dead just about, I'd be hurrying to charge a spare up after 8 or 9 hours.I really love the slick design of the phone.. some people say very cheap feeling or quality but I feel complete opposite and they are probably idiots anyways.
B008HTJLF6,4,22,It's an amazing display.
B008HTJLF6,4,23,If you aren't used to a large screen, the S3 will take a little getting used to.
B008HTJLF6,4,24,Before you purchase this phone I urge you to really think about your needs, and stack them against this review.
B008HTJLF6,5,0,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,5,1,The camera is sweet too, and I like having burst mode.Oh, and its a phone too, and the calls are clear on both ends.
B008HTJLF6,5,2,You can arrange your songs/movies according to folders or anything else you like..Picture/camera: awesome organization, can be according to faces, dates, anything really...Superb quality..really the best and easiest camera to work with by far.
B008HTJLF6,5,3,In fact it seems well built, but like most phones I would not want to drop it without a case.The 1080p video camera is a nice feature too, and the videos looks great!
B008HTJLF6,5,4,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,5,5,Oh, and it looks great.
B008HTJLF6,5,6,Gets rid of a huge peeve for my previous phone.Pro - Camera features work well, esp. the Best Shot mode.
B008HTJLF6,5,7,Stock apps are almost good enough to stick with (almost, not quite, esp. the keyboard & browser).Hardware: good camera, fantastic AMOLED display.
B008HTJLF6,5,8,The speaker on the back is loud, the sound is amazing, the earbuds this comes with are actually pretty good, the processing power is phenominal.The camera is also the best of any phone...its essentially the iPhone 4S's camera...that Samsung made for them...but tweaked to use more cool features.The front camera works wonders with Tango and Google+...both are Android/Google's "Facetime" and work with anyone who has a front camera, unlike Facetime, which requires iOS.The people that give this bad reviews are doing so because of Verizon, not the phone itself.
B008HTJLF6,5,9,It has so many more features.
B008HTJLF6,5,10,The fact that u can so easily switch between recording and picture taking is so awesome.Security: you can set it at whatever level of security you want: pins, face recognition, voice recognition, etc...Apps: it has any app you can possible want like recording phone calls, changing your voice, recording class lecture, games, academics...etc.
B008HTJLF6,5,11,The inner specs are still pretty impressive, even compared to the new phones.
B008HTJLF6,5,12,You can snap pictures instantly.
B008HTJLF6,5,13,Took some very nice pictures at a wedding.Con - Button placement redux (see Major 1 above).
B008HTJLF6,5,14,HD video is sweet also.
B008HTJLF6,5,15,Best Phone I've Ever Owned.
B008HTJLF6,5,16,I used to work for Verizon, and I've tested a lot of phones.
B008HTJLF6,5,17,This phone always gets better.
B008HTJLF6,5,18,It's also incredible in low light situations.
B008HTJLF6,5,19,Except you have to unlock the phone to actually launch the apps.
B008HTJLF6,5,20,Almost a shame to put a case on it.Good battery life.
B008HTJLF6,5,21,I still keep a few on cuz they come in handy.The device is also incredible fast and smooth, and the screen looks perfect.
B008HTJLF6,5,22,it took some time getting used to but i found it a lot easier to multitask and had a lot more features then most phones.
B008HTJLF6,5,23,I must say I love it.
B008HTJLF6,5,24,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,6,0,16 GB + a 32 GB sd card gives me plenty of storage.
B008HTJLF6,6,1,It also has a decent amount of memory, and it even offers a memory card slot if you don't have enough.
B008HTJLF6,6,2,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,6,3,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,6,4,Almost a shame to put a case on it.Good battery life.
B008HTJLF6,6,5,Except you have to unlock the phone to actually launch the apps.
B008HTJLF6,6,6,Less flexibility in dragging & dropping files, folders, etc from your computer.
B008HTJLF6,6,7,USB port on the bottom makes no sense though.Major 2 - No MSC (Mass Storage Control) transfer, only MTP & PTP.
B008HTJLF6,6,8,It has 2 gigs of ram, which is still on par with the newest phones, and apps almost never close on me even when I've opened many other ones.
B008HTJLF6,6,9,In fact it seems well built, but like most phones I would not want to drop it without a case.The 1080p video camera is a nice feature too, and the videos looks great!
B008HTJLF6,6,10,Hardware seems plenty fast despite not being the quad-core international version.
B008HTJLF6,6,11,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,6,12,Android ICS 4.8" AMOLEDHD 720P 2GB of RAM, fantastic device.The features that this phone has are top-tier and the gesture control (while gimmicky) is amazing to show off.
B008HTJLF6,6,13,Oh, and it looks great.
B008HTJLF6,6,14,4G LTE is blazing fast at my location (SE Michigan).ICS, how do I love thee?
B008HTJLF6,6,15,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,6,16,I still keep a few on cuz they come in handy.The device is also incredible fast and smooth, and the screen looks perfect.
B008HTJLF6,6,17,The inner specs are still pretty impressive, even compared to the new phones.
B008HTJLF6,6,18,Great phone, 5* despite nitpicks.
B008HTJLF6,6,19,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,6,20,It has so many more features.
B008HTJLF6,6,21,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,6,22,No ring/vibrate switch from the lockscreen either.Anyway, plenty of software nits that can be fixed by downloading replacement apps or rooting.
B008HTJLF6,6,23,Since I have a Samsung tablet all my apps and pictures from my tablet automatically came up on my phone!
B008HTJLF6,6,24,Stock apps are almost good enough to stick with (almost, not quite, esp. the keyboard & browser).Hardware: good camera, fantastic AMOLED display.
B008HTJLF6,7,0,The Samsung Galaxy S3 is without a doubt the best phone for ME.
B008HTJLF6,7,1,Samsung Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,7,2,For the first time, I might keep a phone even when I can get a new one.
B008HTJLF6,7,3,I have owned the Samsung Galaxy S3 for about six months now.
B008HTJLF6,7,4,I was on the treadmill and I dropped mine.
B008HTJLF6,7,5,I personally am terrified of dropping it due to the case.
B008HTJLF6,7,6,So I can definitely say that this phone is a great phone for anyone.
B008HTJLF6,7,7,I purchased a silicone case just to keep the back scratch free and provide a little cushion in case dropped.
B008HTJLF6,7,8,Before you purchase this phone I urge you to really think about your needs, and stack them against this review.
B008HTJLF6,7,9,I got this phone from amazon over two weeks ago.Arrival:It arrived within just 2 days.Aesthetic: It looks really amazing the stupid picture on amazon doesn't do it justice at all.Performance: omg wow.
B008HTJLF6,7,10,The only reason to not buy an S3 is if you're an Apple Fanboy.
B008HTJLF6,7,11,Not a dent or scratch on mine.
B008HTJLF6,7,12,I must say I love it.
B008HTJLF6,7,13,If you aren't used to a large screen, the S3 will take a little getting used to.
B008HTJLF6,7,14,If you're looking for a good phone with a decent screen size i would recommend the s3.
B008HTJLF6,7,15,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,7,16,Best phone on the market!
B008HTJLF6,7,17,Fantastic upgrade from my Droid X.  ICS by itself is worth the price ($199 from the Verizon store, btw).
B008HTJLF6,7,18,This review is based on an unrooted phone on Verizon Wireless.
B008HTJLF6,7,19,This phone always gets better.
B008HTJLF6,7,20,The inner specs are still pretty impressive, even compared to the new phones.
B008HTJLF6,7,21,The quality of the pictures is also fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,7,22,It has so many more features.
B008HTJLF6,7,23,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,7,24,Im really not one to write reviews.
B008HTJLF6,8,0,I used to work for Verizon, and I've tested a lot of phones.
B008HTJLF6,8,1,This phone comes with 50GB of dropbox storage...25GB on some carriers...Verizon's gets 0GB3) The bootloader, or way to easily root the device and get inside to tweak everything about the device (what Android is best for since everything is open-source) is locked and encrypted...Verizon is the only one refusing to open it.4)
B008HTJLF6,8,2,Best Phone I've Ever Owned.
B008HTJLF6,8,3,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,8,4,DONT read the one-star reviews, those people are just moping about a dumb issue...I'll explain.
B008HTJLF6,8,5,I have a Samsung TV so I can send them wirelessly from the phone to the TV.
B008HTJLF6,8,6,I get better signal than I did on my Nexus.Touchwiz is a bit clunky; but as I mentioned above that can be easily remedied by using Apex or Nova.Overall, I would recommend this phone to ANYONE.
B008HTJLF6,8,7,I for one, was just tired of waiting and this device was the last one to allow me my unlimited data.If you have questions, ask.
B008HTJLF6,8,8,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,8,9,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,8,10,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,8,11,I got this phone from amazon over two weeks ago.Arrival:It arrived within just 2 days.Aesthetic: It looks really amazing the stupid picture on amazon doesn't do it justice at all.Performance: omg wow.
B008HTJLF6,8,12,Verizon decided to opt out of a lot of things that people want this phone for:1) NFC...payments made from the phone using a wireless connection and Google Wallet were switched off by Verizon, all other carriers get it.2)Dropbox--a
B008HTJLF6,8,13,It's also capable of 4G LTE speeds so the internet is blazing fast as well.Most of my friends have iphones, and they were envious of the looks/screen on this phone.
B008HTJLF6,8,14,I have yet to have a real problem, even tethering works smoothly with multiple devices.I have dropped this phone one time and although it did get some scratches it still looks good and works, no cracked screen or any nonsense.The battery life blows, but I use this thing constantly; movies, internet, reddit, I'm always on it so I just charge it everywhere.
B008HTJLF6,8,15,It's sooooo anoying.So, in summary, this is the best phone in the world..no exaggeration, literally every website, including Mac World, rave about this thing...Verizon's version is severly limited due to them being greedy, arrogant, idiotic...well you get the idea.If you want easy access to rooting, hacking(which is encouraged with android devices...google even awards people who hack into their devices to improve them...the Nexus Q being the best example...during the reveal of the device at their conference they stopped to tell people how hackable it is)...get the Galaxy Nexus or wait until this Christmas when the next "Nexus" device is out.
B008HTJLF6,8,16,I purchased a silicone case just to keep the back scratch free and provide a little cushion in case dropped.
B008HTJLF6,8,17,I know you could always do things to get better battery than I've been having, I personally don't care to root this yet or do any of the tweaks.
B008HTJLF6,8,18,The saturation really adds to the screen and all of the colors pop.The quickness is partially due to Verizon, but mostly due to the S4 processor inside which easily matches the Tegra 3 quad-cores in tablets and the overseas version of this.In short, for $200 you won't find a better new phone.
B008HTJLF6,8,19,Phone is really great and I think probably the best outta smartphones I've had.. had about 6-7 so far.Battery on this phone is probably best I've experienced with this phone here.
B008HTJLF6,8,20,This review is based on an unrooted phone on Verizon Wireless.
B008HTJLF6,8,21,This is IMO the best android phone to date.
B008HTJLF6,8,22,Best Android Phone To Date.
B008HTJLF6,8,23,The speaker on the back is loud, the sound is amazing, the earbuds this comes with are actually pretty good, the processing power is phenominal.The camera is also the best of any phone...its essentially the iPhone 4S's camera...that Samsung made for them...but tweaked to use more cool features.The front camera works wonders with Tango and Google+...both are Android/Google's "Facetime" and work with anyone who has a front camera, unlike Facetime, which requires iOS.The people that give this bad reviews are doing so because of Verizon, not the phone itself.

B008HTJLF6,9,2,I still keep a few on cuz they come in handy.The device is also incredible fast and smooth, and the screen looks perfect.
B008HTJLF6,9,3,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,9,4,It has a dual core 1.5 ghz processor.
B008HTJLF6,9,5,I know it's not a quad core like some newer phones, but it is still very fast at doing everything.
B008HTJLF6,9,6,The dual-core cpu does a great job at giving great speed and performance with virtually no lag.
B008HTJLF6,9,7,4G LTE is blazing fast at my location (SE Michigan).ICS, how do I love thee?
B008HTJLF6,9,8,I just recently upgraded to this phone from my previous HTC Droid Incredible II, and the Galaxy S III is AWESOME!
B008HTJLF6,9,9,Hardware seems plenty fast despite not being the quad-core international version.
B008HTJLF6,9,10,With a dual core (US) 1.5 GHz processor, and 2 gigs (US) of RAM this thing will be future proof for the next two years that you own it.
B008HTJLF6,9,11,The speed on the S3 camera is stellar.
B008HTJLF6,9,12,Much faster very lite and excellent picture quality.Samsung Galaxy S III 4G Android Phone, White 16GB (Verizon Wireless)
B008HTJLF6,9,13,The Samsung Galaxy S3 is without a doubt the best phone for ME.
B008HTJLF6,9,14,S III Outstanding easy step-up and fast.
B008HTJLF6,9,15,Oh, and it looks great.
B008HTJLF6,9,16,Android ICS 4.8" AMOLEDHD 720P 2GB of RAM, fantastic device.The features that this phone has are top-tier and the gesture control (while gimmicky) is amazing to show off.

B008HTJLF6,9,19,Great display.
B008HTJLF6,9,20,The home screens run smoothly even using Go Launcher as a home replacement.
B008HTJLF6,9,21,Multitasking is greatly improved (hint: long-press home button).
B008HTJLF6,9,22,Fantastic upgrade from my Droid X.  ICS by itself is worth the price ($199 from the Verizon store, btw).
B008HTJLF6,9,23,It is also worth noting that the screen is made from Gorilla Glass 2Performance1.5 GHz S4 processor and 2GB of RAM? Yes please.
B008HTJLF6,9,24,Samsung Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,10,0,I loved that!!
B008HTJLF6,10,1,i love this phone!
B008HTJLF6,10,2,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,3,This phone is GREAT.
B008HTJLF6,10,4,I must say I love it.
B008HTJLF6,10,5,I was nervous about switching to a phone that didn't have an actual keyboard but it is definitely worth it!
B008HTJLF6,10,6,So I can definitely say that this phone is a great phone for anyone.
B008HTJLF6,10,7,Excellent.
B008HTJLF6,10,8,I'm typing this review on my phone right now.
B008HTJLF6,10,9,It's very light and easy to hold for its size.
B008HTJLF6,10,10,Typing is very natural to.
B008HTJLF6,10,11,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,10,12,Although samsung has not updated the firmware often the os alone is already good to use.
B008HTJLF6,10,13,Personally I'm very happy and think this phone is top of the line :).
B008HTJLF6,10,14,It has so many more features.
B008HTJLF6,10,15,I was a little discouraged about getting a phone this big but after purchasing it.
B008HTJLF6,10,16,The inner specs are still pretty impressive, even compared to the new phones.
B008HTJLF6,10,17,Then again everyone is different and we all don't have the same luck with our electronic gadgets or all want something else.
B008HTJLF6,10,18,Phone is really great and I think probably the best outta smartphones I've had.. had about 6-7 so far.Battery on this phone is probably best I've experienced with this phone here.
B008HTJLF6,10,19,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,10,20,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,10,21,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,10,22,I've had this phone for over a month now.. month and few weeks maybe.
B008HTJLF6,10,23,I know you could always do things to get better battery than I've been having, I personally don't care to root this yet or do any of the tweaks.
B008HTJLF6,10,24,This is IMO the best android phone to date.
B008HTJLF6,11,0,The power button is located on the right side of the phone near the top, and a volume rocker is located on the left side near the top.
B008HTJLF6,11,1,Really, it's the MSC & power button that might tempt me to leave the G3 a 4* review, but honestly, I just love the phone to death right now, which is kind of the bottom line.
B008HTJLF6,11,2,I asked many people to take pictures for me, and they invariably hit the volume button by accident which operates the digital zoom.
B008HTJLF6,11,3,Took some very nice pictures at a wedding.Con - Button placement redux (see Major 1 above).
B008HTJLF6,11,4,I get better signal than I did on my Nexus.Touchwiz is a bit clunky; but as I mentioned above that can be easily remedied by using Apex or Nova.Overall, I would recommend this phone to ANYONE.
B008HTJLF6,11,5,Now for the list of things that make this phone the best android phone to date.The S4 processor with two gigs of ram.The Large 4.8 inch screen, which more than holds it own against all comers.The Camera is the best camera you can get on a phone right now bar none.The Battery life is the best on a smartphone outside of the Maxx, one suggestion would be to limit your background processes by going into developer options and change how many background processes your phone will allow.The Gesture controls are a very nice touch.The form factor is very sleek and sexy.Now for a list of things I don't like quite as much.The power button seems a bit flimsy to me, makes me wonder how it will hold up for two years.The signal is not quite as good as it should be for a phone made in 2012, but it is still very solid nonetheless.
B008HTJLF6,11,6,There is a home button on the front of the screen near the bottom on the center.
B008HTJLF6,11,7,Very natural to place your left thumb there in landscape mode.
B008HTJLF6,11,8,This phone with small tweaks which make a huge difference has really become a new phone)I really love this phone..i hope you find my review useful cause i spent time to write it for you people that are deciding ...best of success to you in choosing.
B008HTJLF6,11,9,I'm hitting the volume keys on the left far too often when turning on/off the phone.
B008HTJLF6,11,10,When in quiet places, I generally have a pretty good success rate when using S Voice, but I'm really hoping when Jellybean gets pushed to the S3 that Google Now will really pick up the slack.Pop Up Play - I've never used it, as I see no practical use in it.Share Shot - would be a great feature if the only phone in the world was the S3ProsBeautiful screenGorilla Glass 2Smooth running OSSpeedy, high quality camera4GRobust customization optionsFast GPS lock (I didn't mention this in the review, but the GPS lock on this phone is incredibly fast)ConsLocked Bootloader (Verizon only)No Google Wallet (such a horrible move on Verizon's part)Battery cover hard to remove (minor complaint but still worth noting especially if you ever need to change your battery)Speaker placementConclusion: You would be a wise man indeed to purchase a Samsung Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,11,11,This is IMO the best android phone to date.
B008HTJLF6,11,12,Best Android Phone To Date.
B008HTJLF6,11,13,The only time my battery life isn't wonderful is when the phone is maxed out searching for signal on Coronado.
B008HTJLF6,11,14,The DX took a long time to lock onto GPS signals, but the SG3 is almost instantaneous when outdoors (or inside of a car that is outdoors).
B008HTJLF6,11,15,The quality of the pictures is also fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,11,16,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,11,17,Im really not one to write reviews.
B008HTJLF6,11,18,Almost a shame to put a case on it.Good battery life.
B008HTJLF6,11,19,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,11,20,DONT read the one-star reviews, those people are just moping about a dumb issue...I'll explain.
B008HTJLF6,11,21,You can arrange your songs/movies according to folders or anything else you like..Picture/camera: awesome organization, can be according to faces, dates, anything really...Superb quality..really the best and easiest camera to work with by far.
B008HTJLF6,11,22,Except you have to unlock the phone to actually launch the apps.
B008HTJLF6,11,23,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,11,24,I don't actually mind the plastic construction--doesn't feel "cheap" to me at all--but I'll likely get a TPU case for the grippiness.Shortcuts on your lockscreen is a great feature!
B008HTJLF6,12,0,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,12,1,This phone is GREAT.
B008HTJLF6,12,2,Im really not one to write reviews.
B008HTJLF6,12,3,I can work this phone hard, I mean constant youtube videos, some games, taking pictures, making some phone calls and stuff, and doing some e-mails (4 email accounts).. even though I don't sync but 6 minutes on every hour.
B008HTJLF6,12,4,No need to write anything else.Entertainment: Freaking awesome for music, movies, seriously anything.
B008HTJLF6,12,5,I've had this phone for over a month now.. month and few weeks maybe.
B008HTJLF6,12,6,Fantastic upgrade from my Droid X.  ICS by itself is worth the price ($199 from the Verizon store, btw).
B008HTJLF6,12,7,Pure Excellence.
B008HTJLF6,12,8,You can arrange your songs/movies according to folders or anything else you like..Picture/camera: awesome organization, can be according to faces, dates, anything really...Superb quality..really the best and easiest camera to work with by far.
B008HTJLF6,12,9,Moderate use: playing games, making calls, using Tapatalk, checking my Google+, Twitter, Flipboard, and reading other news articles, I can usually get a good 16 hours of battery life.OSI could write several pages just on how much better ICS is than any other Android build I've used, but I'm going to leave it to you to research this.
B008HTJLF6,12,10,I received it set the phone up the same day easy conversion from my Droid X; I used the My Backup Pro app to convert applications and data.
B008HTJLF6,12,11,Phone is really great and I think probably the best outta smartphones I've had.. had about 6-7 so far.Battery on this phone is probably best I've experienced with this phone here.
B008HTJLF6,12,12,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,12,13,This phone with small tweaks which make a huge difference has really become a new phone)I really love this phone..i hope you find my review useful cause i spent time to write it for you people that are deciding ...best of success to you in choosing.
B008HTJLF6,12,14,Verizon decided to opt out of a lot of things that people want this phone for:1) NFC...payments made from the phone using a wireless connection and Google Wallet were switched off by Verizon, all other carriers get it.2)Dropbox--a
B008HTJLF6,12,15,Although samsung has not updated the firmware often the os alone is already good to use.
B008HTJLF6,12,16,Maybe it was just the degree of upgrade after 2 years, but whatever, it's a fantastic phone that I was happy to pay full price for at launch, instead of waiting a month or two for it to get discounted.Edit: 7/26.
B008HTJLF6,12,17,Multitasking is superb as well; you can call and search the web or listen to your navigation while ur on the phone...ridiculous!Voice Interface: I'd estimate like a 96-98% accuracy of the Google voice search (which is EXTREMELY high and crushes "siri" any day).
B008HTJLF6,12,18,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,12,19,I was nervous about switching to a phone that didn't have an actual keyboard but it is definitely worth it!
B008HTJLF6,12,20,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,12,21,In fact it seems well built, but like most phones I would not want to drop it without a case.The 1080p video camera is a nice feature too, and the videos looks great!
B008HTJLF6,12,22,The S-Voice function is also really good but it's slow so I use the google one.Web: Searching the web is faster than my cable company and its super fast as mentioned.
B008HTJLF6,12,23,Great display.
B008HTJLF6,12,24,I know you could always do things to get better battery than I've been having, I personally don't care to root this yet or do any of the tweaks.
B008HTJLF6,13,0,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,13,1,I purchased a silicone case just to keep the back scratch free and provide a little cushion in case dropped.
B008HTJLF6,13,2,If you aren't used to a large screen, the S3 will take a little getting used to.
B008HTJLF6,13,3,The home screens run smoothly even using Go Launcher as a home replacement.
B008HTJLF6,13,4,The display is huge, and the phone is a bit big for one-handed operations, but it's also thin and fits in your pocket no problem.
B008HTJLF6,13,5,In the month that I've had it I've gotten so used to it that now when I pick up my iPod touch, my immediate reaction is, "why did they design this screen so small?"
B008HTJLF6,13,6,I have yet to have a real problem, even tethering works smoothly with multiple devices.I have dropped this phone one time and although it did get some scratches it still looks good and works, no cracked screen or any nonsense.The battery life blows, but I use this thing constantly; movies, internet, reddit, I'm always on it so I just charge it everywhere.
B008HTJLF6,13,7,A good case might alleviate this.Semi-con - This is 100% on me, but don't get too cocky about the Gorilla Glass 2.  I managed to scratch it a tiny bit in the 2 weeks thinking it was invincible, and it's not.
B008HTJLF6,13,8,Almost a shame to put a case on it.Good battery life.
B008HTJLF6,13,9,One small complaint is the battery cover: you have to somewhat pry it off starting with a little slip on top center of the phone.
B008HTJLF6,13,10,There is a home button on the front of the screen near the bottom on the center.
B008HTJLF6,13,11,Another disappointment to me is the way the speaker is placed; it's on the rear of the phone and if you have the phone on a flat table, it muffles the sound from the speaker.ScreenYou're going to be working with a 4.8-inch Super AMOLED HD display.
B008HTJLF6,13,12,Buy a protector.
B008HTJLF6,13,13,I don't actually mind the plastic construction--doesn't feel "cheap" to me at all--but I'll likely get a TPU case for the grippiness.Shortcuts on your lockscreen is a great feature!
B008HTJLF6,13,14,Much more bright than my wife's iPhone 4S.
B008HTJLF6,13,15,The Motorola Droid camera was so slow that it made capturing unique moments nearly impossible.
B008HTJLF6,13,16,It's an amazing display.
B008HTJLF6,13,17,The Samsung Galaxy S3 is without a doubt the best phone for ME.
B008HTJLF6,13,18,Took some very nice pictures at a wedding.Con - Button placement redux (see Major 1 above).
B008HTJLF6,13,19,Sure, there are ways around this, but is annoying nonetheless.Minor - so, yeah, big display, and if you have small-ish hands, 1-handed operations are risky, esp w/the somewhat slippery case.
B008HTJLF6,13,20,HD movies look gorgeous and play smoothly.
B008HTJLF6,13,21,Keys & coins may be fine, but rough kitchen surfaces are not (granite, sandstone, etc).
B008HTJLF6,13,22,Coming from an original Motorola Droid, I was a little offput by the large size of this phone.
B008HTJLF6,13,23,The ability to customize my phone is invaluable to me, which is why I always choose Android over Apple.Camera8-megapixel rear camera, 1.9-megapixel front camera.
B008HTJLF6,13,24,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,14,0,In fact, when opening ANY app that uses data, Verizon has a big pop up that asks you to switch to an open wifi so you dont use their data...you have to physically hit the "no" every single time...even when checking facebook you have to.
B008HTJLF6,14,1,I can finally disable all the annoying Verizon (& Samsung) apps w/o rooting (though you need to root to fully uninstall them).
B008HTJLF6,14,2,It's sooooo anoying.So, in summary, this is the best phone in the world..no exaggeration, literally every website, including Mac World, rave about this thing...Verizon's version is severly limited due to them being greedy, arrogant, idiotic...well you get the idea.If you want easy access to rooting, hacking(which is encouraged with android devices...google even awards people who hack into their devices to improve them...the Nexus Q being the best example...during the reveal of the device at their conference they stopped to tell people how hackable it is)...get the Galaxy Nexus or wait until this Christmas when the next "Nexus" device is out.
B008HTJLF6,14,3,Moderate use: playing games, making calls, using Tapatalk, checking my Google+, Twitter, Flipboard, and reading other news articles, I can usually get a good 16 hours of battery life.OSI could write several pages just on how much better ICS is than any other Android build I've used, but I'm going to leave it to you to research this.

B008HTJLF6,14,7,This phone comes with 50GB of dropbox storage...25GB on some carriers...Verizon's gets 0GB3) The bootloader, or way to easily root the device and get inside to tweak everything about the device (what Android is best for since everything is open-source) is locked and encrypted...Verizon is the only one refusing to open it.4)
B008HTJLF6,14,8,and installations are faster than any other phone i promise (including iphone for sure)Other notes: (I had the Galaxy Sii and i hated it.
B008HTJLF6,14,9,This phone performs basically as fast as my computer and even has a task manager lol.
B008HTJLF6,14,10,Although samsung has not updated the firmware often the os alone is already good to use.
B008HTJLF6,14,11,No ring/vibrate switch from the lockscreen either.Anyway, plenty of software nits that can be fixed by downloading replacement apps or rooting.
B008HTJLF6,14,12,Onboard apps--Verizon's tools like backup wifi detection always turn on and interupt what I'm doing.
B008HTJLF6,14,13,It has 2 gigs of ram, which is still on par with the newest phones, and apps almost never close on me even when I've opened many other ones.
B008HTJLF6,14,14,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,14,15,Took some very nice pictures at a wedding.Con - Button placement redux (see Major 1 above).
B008HTJLF6,14,16,Im really not one to write reviews.
B008HTJLF6,14,17,Really, it's the MSC & power button that might tempt me to leave the G3 a 4* review, but honestly, I just love the phone to death right now, which is kind of the bottom line.
B008HTJLF6,14,18,I asked many people to take pictures for me, and they invariably hit the volume button by accident which operates the digital zoom.
B008HTJLF6,14,19,I know you could always do things to get better battery than I've been having, I personally don't care to root this yet or do any of the tweaks.
B008HTJLF6,14,20,I for one, was just tired of waiting and this device was the last one to allow me my unlimited data.If you have questions, ask.
B008HTJLF6,14,21,cloud based storage system.

B008HTJLF6,15,6,It is simple to use too, my mom who is a die hard apple fan actually used it for ten minutes and lets just say she no longer uses her Iphone.

B008HTJLF6,15,14,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,15,15,I used to work for Verizon, and I've tested a lot of phones.
B008HTJLF6,15,16,Before you purchase this phone I urge you to really think about your needs, and stack them against this review.
B008HTJLF6,15,17,The only reason to not buy an S3 is if you're an Apple Fanboy.
B008HTJLF6,15,18,Coming from an original Motorola Droid, I was a little offput by the large size of this phone.
B008HTJLF6,15,19,Best phone on the market right now.
B008HTJLF6,15,20,Best phone on the market right now.
B008HTJLF6,15,21,Better than Iphone5 or any other Android phone out there.
B008HTJLF6,15,22,Although samsung has not updated the firmware often the os alone is already good to use.
B008HTJLF6,15,23,I just recently upgraded to this phone from my previous HTC Droid Incredible II, and the Galaxy S III is AWESOME!
B008HTJLF6,15,24,Fantastic upgrade from my Droid X.  ICS by itself is worth the price ($199 from the Verizon store, btw).
B008HTJLF6,16,0,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,16,1,Almost a shame to put a case on it.Good battery life.
B008HTJLF6,16,2,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,16,3,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,16,4,I've been going a full day on a single charge with medium-heavy usage with plenty to spare.
B008HTJLF6,16,5,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,16,6,I have yet to have a real problem, even tethering works smoothly with multiple devices.I have dropped this phone one time and although it did get some scratches it still looks good and works, no cracked screen or any nonsense.The battery life blows, but I use this thing constantly; movies, internet, reddit, I'm always on it so I just charge it everywhere.
B008HTJLF6,16,7,i actually takes a lot longer then i would have expected compared to the commercials and the battery life can be drained fairly quickly.
B008HTJLF6,16,8,Not watching movies or anything that requires the LCD to be on for hours at a time, obviously, but for most usage, you should be fine just plugging in at night.Nitpicks:Major 1 - Power button placement on the right, usb port on the bottom.
B008HTJLF6,16,9,I've had this phone for over a month now.. month and few weeks maybe.
B008HTJLF6,16,10,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,16,11,Except you have to unlock the phone to actually launch the apps.
B008HTJLF6,16,12,I got this phone from amazon over two weeks ago.Arrival:It arrived within just 2 days.Aesthetic: It looks really amazing the stupid picture on amazon doesn't do it justice at all.Performance: omg wow.
B008HTJLF6,16,13,The speed is amazing, battery life is about 2 days for me, and I haven't had a single crash since I bought it.
B008HTJLF6,16,14,My other phones would be about dead just about, I'd be hurrying to charge a spare up after 8 or 9 hours.I really love the slick design of the phone.. some people say very cheap feeling or quality but I feel complete opposite and they are probably idiots anyways.
B008HTJLF6,16,15,I purchased a silicone case just to keep the back scratch free and provide a little cushion in case dropped.

B008HTJLF6,16,21,Took some very nice pictures at a wedding.Con - Button placement redux (see Major 1 above).
B008HTJLF6,16,22,Great phone, 5* despite nitpicks.
B008HTJLF6,16,23,Very natural to place your left thumb there in landscape mode.
B008HTJLF6,16,24,I get better signal than I did on my Nexus.Touchwiz is a bit clunky; but as I mentioned above that can be easily remedied by using Apex or Nova.Overall, I would recommend this phone to ANYONE.
B008HTJLF6,17,0,Decent speaker for speakerphone or listening to podcasts.
B008HTJLF6,17,1,My other phones would be about dead just about, I'd be hurrying to charge a spare up after 8 or 9 hours.I really love the slick design of the phone.. some people say very cheap feeling or quality but I feel complete opposite and they are probably idiots anyways.

B008HTJLF6,17,4,The quality of the pictures is also fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,17,5,People will complain that this has a PENTILE display, which has faced very harsh reviews on other phones.
B008HTJLF6,17,6,The camera is sweet too, and I like having burst mode.Oh, and its a phone too, and the calls are clear on both ends.

B008HTJLF6,17,20,Very natural to place your left thumb there in landscape mode.
B008HTJLF6,17,21,The speaker on the back is loud, the sound is amazing, the earbuds this comes with are actually pretty good, the processing power is phenominal.The camera is also the best of any phone...its essentially the iPhone 4S's camera...that Samsung made for them...but tweaked to use more cool features.The front camera works wonders with Tango and Google+...both are Android/Google's "Facetime" and work with anyone who has a front camera, unlike Facetime, which requires iOS.The people that give this bad reviews are doing so because of Verizon, not the phone itself.

B008HTJLF6,18,6,I have yet to have a real problem, even tethering works smoothly with multiple devices.I have dropped this phone one time and although it did get some scratches it still looks good and works, no cracked screen or any nonsense.The battery life blows, but I use this thing constantly; movies, internet, reddit, I'm always on it so I just charge it everywhere.
B008HTJLF6,18,7,The Motorola Droid camera was so slow that it made capturing unique moments nearly impossible.
B008HTJLF6,18,8,Although samsung has not updated the firmware often the os alone is already good to use.
B008HTJLF6,18,9,The camera is sweet too, and I like having burst mode.Oh, and its a phone too, and the calls are clear on both ends.
B008HTJLF6,18,10,I personally am terrified of dropping it due to the case.
B008HTJLF6,18,11,I still keep a few on cuz they come in handy.The device is also incredible fast and smooth, and the screen looks perfect.
B008HTJLF6,18,12,However, due to the high-resolution display there are so many pixels that the PENTILE isn't noticable at all.
B008HTJLF6,18,13,If you aren't used to a large screen, the S3 will take a little getting used to.
B008HTJLF6,18,14,Now for the list of things that make this phone the best android phone to date.The S4 processor with two gigs of ram.The Large 4.8 inch screen, which more than holds it own against all comers.The Camera is the best camera you can get on a phone right now bar none.The Battery life is the best on a smartphone outside of the Maxx, one suggestion would be to limit your background processes by going into developer options and change how many background processes your phone will allow.The Gesture controls are a very nice touch.The form factor is very sleek and sexy.Now for a list of things I don't like quite as much.The power button seems a bit flimsy to me, makes me wonder how it will hold up for two years.The signal is not quite as good as it should be for a phone made in 2012, but it is still very solid nonetheless.
B008HTJLF6,18,15,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,18,16,Gets rid of a huge peeve for my previous phone.Pro - Camera features work well, esp. the Best Shot mode.
B008HTJLF6,18,17,The home screens run smoothly even using Go Launcher as a home replacement.
B008HTJLF6,18,18,I get better signal than I did on my Nexus.Touchwiz is a bit clunky; but as I mentioned above that can be easily remedied by using Apex or Nova.Overall, I would recommend this phone to ANYONE.
B008HTJLF6,18,19,Another disappointment to me is the way the speaker is placed; it's on the rear of the phone and if you have the phone on a flat table, it muffles the sound from the speaker.ScreenYou're going to be working with a 4.8-inch Super AMOLED HD display.
B008HTJLF6,18,20,Stock apps are almost good enough to stick with (almost, not quite, esp. the keyboard & browser).Hardware: good camera, fantastic AMOLED display.
B008HTJLF6,18,21,The Samsung Galaxy S3 is without a doubt the best phone for ME.
B008HTJLF6,18,22,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,18,23,With such a large phone you'd expect it to be heavy, but somehow Samsung made this phone light, thin and airy.
B008HTJLF6,18,24,The only time my battery life isn't wonderful is when the phone is maxed out searching for signal on Coronado.
B008HTJLF6,19,0,16 GB + a 32 GB sd card gives me plenty of storage.
B008HTJLF6,19,1,It also has a decent amount of memory, and it even offers a memory card slot if you don't have enough.
B008HTJLF6,19,2,In fact, when opening ANY app that uses data, Verizon has a big pop up that asks you to switch to an open wifi so you dont use their data...you have to physically hit the "no" every single time...even when checking facebook you have to.
B008HTJLF6,19,3,I purchased a silicone case just to keep the back scratch free and provide a little cushion in case dropped.
B008HTJLF6,19,4,DONT read the one-star reviews, those people are just moping about a dumb issue...I'll explain.
B008HTJLF6,19,5,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,19,6,I used to work for Verizon, and I've tested a lot of phones.
B008HTJLF6,19,7,This phone comes with 50GB of dropbox storage...25GB on some carriers...Verizon's gets 0GB3) The bootloader, or way to easily root the device and get inside to tweak everything about the device (what Android is best for since everything is open-source) is locked and encrypted...Verizon is the only one refusing to open it.4)
B008HTJLF6,19,8,Onboard apps--Verizon's tools like backup wifi detection always turn on and interupt what I'm doing.
B008HTJLF6,19,9,In fact it seems well built, but like most phones I would not want to drop it without a case.The 1080p video camera is a nice feature too, and the videos looks great!
B008HTJLF6,19,10,Doing a looped video test, I can squeeze about 9 hours 15 minutes out of my phone.
B008HTJLF6,19,11,I can work this phone hard, I mean constant youtube videos, some games, taking pictures, making some phone calls and stuff, and doing some e-mails (4 email accounts).. even though I don't sync but 6 minutes on every hour.
B008HTJLF6,19,12,Not watching movies or anything that requires the LCD to be on for hours at a time, obviously, but for most usage, you should be fine just plugging in at night.Nitpicks:Major 1 - Power button placement on the right, usb port on the bottom.
B008HTJLF6,19,13,One of the biggest reasons I wanted a phone upgrade was the camera.
B008HTJLF6,19,14,People will complain that this has a PENTILE display, which has faced very harsh reviews on other phones.
B008HTJLF6,19,15,Verizon decided to opt out of a lot of things that people want this phone for:1) NFC...payments made from the phone using a wireless connection and Google Wallet were switched off by Verizon, all other carriers get it.2)Dropbox--a
B008HTJLF6,19,16,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,19,17,One small complaint is the battery cover: you have to somewhat pry it off starting with a little slip on top center of the phone.
B008HTJLF6,19,18,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,19,19,I received it set the phone up the same day easy conversion from my Droid X; I used the My Backup Pro app to convert applications and data.
B008HTJLF6,19,20,I have yet to have a real problem, even tethering works smoothly with multiple devices.I have dropped this phone one time and although it did get some scratches it still looks good and works, no cracked screen or any nonsense.The battery life blows, but I use this thing constantly; movies, internet, reddit, I'm always on it so I just charge it everywhere.
B008HTJLF6,19,21,Added thoughts after 2 weeks of ownership and experience of travel (air & driving) with the phone (because this review wasn't long enough!).Pro - GPS locks very quickly.
B008HTJLF6,19,22,This phone with small tweaks which make a huge difference has really become a new phone)I really love this phone..i hope you find my review useful cause i spent time to write it for you people that are deciding ...best of success to you in choosing.
B008HTJLF6,19,23,Although samsung has not updated the firmware often the os alone is already good to use.
B008HTJLF6,19,24,Those two launchers are specifically made for the current version of android (ICS).
B008HTJLF6,20,0,I've had this phone for over a month now.. month and few weeks maybe.
B008HTJLF6,20,1,I have yet to have a real problem, even tethering works smoothly with multiple devices.I have dropped this phone one time and although it did get some scratches it still looks good and works, no cracked screen or any nonsense.The battery life blows, but I use this thing constantly; movies, internet, reddit, I'm always on it so I just charge it everywhere.
B008HTJLF6,20,2,I purchased a silicone case just to keep the back scratch free and provide a little cushion in case dropped.
B008HTJLF6,20,3,I have owned the Samsung Galaxy S3 for about six months now.
B008HTJLF6,20,4,I personally am terrified of dropping it due to the case.
B008HTJLF6,20,5,Doing a looped video test, I can squeeze about 9 hours 15 minutes out of my phone.
B008HTJLF6,20,6,The camera is sweet too, and I like having burst mode.Oh, and its a phone too, and the calls are clear on both ends.

B008HTJLF6,20,9,The only time my battery life isn't wonderful is when the phone is maxed out searching for signal on Coronado.
B008HTJLF6,20,10,I know you could always do things to get better battery than I've been having, I personally don't care to root this yet or do any of the tweaks.
B008HTJLF6,20,11,The only time I do not get 4G is when I'm on the island of Coronado, and even then it just cuts in and out.
B008HTJLF6,20,12,Samsung Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,20,13,I got this phone from amazon over two weeks ago.Arrival:It arrived within just 2 days.Aesthetic: It looks really amazing the stupid picture on amazon doesn't do it justice at all.Performance: omg wow.
B008HTJLF6,20,14,I was on the treadmill and I dropped mine.
B008HTJLF6,20,15,Almost a shame to put a case on it.Good battery life.
B008HTJLF6,20,16,I was a little discouraged about getting a phone this big but after purchasing it.
B008HTJLF6,20,17,Since I turned the phone on it has been wonderful!
B008HTJLF6,20,18,This phone with small tweaks which make a huge difference has really become a new phone)I really love this phone..i hope you find my review useful cause i spent time to write it for you people that are deciding ...best of success to you in choosing.
B008HTJLF6,20,19,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,20,20,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,20,21,Before you purchase this phone I urge you to really think about your needs, and stack them against this review.
B008HTJLF6,20,22,Maybe it was just the degree of upgrade after 2 years, but whatever, it's a fantastic phone that I was happy to pay full price for at launch, instead of waiting a month or two for it to get discounted.Edit: 7/26.
B008HTJLF6,20,23,When in quiet places, I generally have a pretty good success rate when using S Voice, but I'm really hoping when Jellybean gets pushed to the S3 that Google Now will really pick up the slack.Pop Up Play - I've never used it, as I see no practical use in it.Share Shot - would be a great feature if the only phone in the world was the S3ProsBeautiful screenGorilla Glass 2Smooth running OSSpeedy, high quality camera4GRobust customization optionsFast GPS lock (I didn't mention this in the review, but the GPS lock on this phone is incredibly fast)ConsLocked Bootloader (Verizon only)No Google Wallet (such a horrible move on Verizon's part)Battery cover hard to remove (minor complaint but still worth noting especially if you ever need to change your battery)Speaker placementConclusion: You would be a wise man indeed to purchase a Samsung Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,20,24,The DX took a long time to lock onto GPS signals, but the SG3 is almost instantaneous when outdoors (or inside of a car that is outdoors).
B008HTJLF6,21,0,Verizon decided to opt out of a lot of things that people want this phone for:1) NFC...payments made from the phone using a wireless connection and Google Wallet were switched off by Verizon, all other carriers get it.2)Dropbox--a
B008HTJLF6,21,1,Everywhere else I have been in San Diego, I get exceptional service.
B008HTJLF6,21,2,I haven't found a thing that my S3 can't run flawlessly.Connectivity (Signal Strength)I'm currently in San Diego, CA.
B008HTJLF6,21,3,I purchased a silicone case just to keep the back scratch free and provide a little cushion in case dropped.
B008HTJLF6,21,4,Before you purchase this phone I urge you to really think about your needs, and stack them against this review.
B008HTJLF6,21,5,This review is based on an unrooted phone on Verizon Wireless.
B008HTJLF6,21,6,The only time I do not get 4G is when I'm on the island of Coronado, and even then it just cuts in and out.
B008HTJLF6,21,7,DONT read the one-star reviews, those people are just moping about a dumb issue...I'll explain.

B008HTJLF6,21,12,I can finally disable all the annoying Verizon (& Samsung) apps w/o rooting (though you need to root to fully uninstall them).
B008HTJLF6,21,13,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,21,14,The camera is sweet too, and I like having burst mode.Oh, and its a phone too, and the calls are clear on both ends.
B008HTJLF6,21,15,The home screens run smoothly even using Go Launcher as a home replacement.
B008HTJLF6,21,16,The speed on the S3 camera is stellar.

B008HTJLF6,21,19,I've had this phone for over a month now.. month and few weeks maybe.
B008HTJLF6,21,20,Since I have a Samsung tablet all my apps and pictures from my tablet automatically came up on my phone!
B008HTJLF6,21,21,If you aren't used to a large screen, the S3 will take a little getting used to.
B008HTJLF6,21,22,The Motorola Droid camera was so slow that it made capturing unique moments nearly impossible.

B008HTJLF6,22,0,Those two launchers are specifically made for the current version of android (ICS).
B008HTJLF6,22,1,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,22,2,Lightning fast 4G LTE.
B008HTJLF6,22,3,The saturation really adds to the screen and all of the colors pop.The quickness is partially due to Verizon, but mostly due to the S4 processor inside which easily matches the Tegra 3 quad-cores in tablets and the overseas version of this.In short, for $200 you won't find a better new phone.
B008HTJLF6,22,4,This is IMO the best android phone to date.
B008HTJLF6,22,5,Best Android Phone To Date.
B008HTJLF6,22,6,It has a few minor bugs that could easily be ironed out with a update from the manufacturer.
B008HTJLF6,22,7,It has a dual core 1.5 ghz processor.
B008HTJLF6,22,8,I will suggest one thing to do to make this phone run to its fullest potential, get rid of touchwiz by using either the Apex Launcher, or NovaLauncher.
B008HTJLF6,22,9,cloud based storage system.
B008HTJLF6,22,10,With a dual core (US) 1.5 GHz processor, and 2 gigs (US) of RAM this thing will be future proof for the next two years that you own it.
B008HTJLF6,22,11,Hardware seems plenty fast despite not being the quad-core international version.
B008HTJLF6,22,12,It's also capable of 4G LTE speeds so the internet is blazing fast as well.Most of my friends have iphones, and they were envious of the looks/screen on this phone.
B008HTJLF6,22,13,It's sooooo anoying.So, in summary, this is the best phone in the world..no exaggeration, literally every website, including Mac World, rave about this thing...Verizon's version is severly limited due to them being greedy, arrogant, idiotic...well you get the idea.If you want easy access to rooting, hacking(which is encouraged with android devices...google even awards people who hack into their devices to improve them...the Nexus Q being the best example...during the reveal of the device at their conference they stopped to tell people how hackable it is)...get the Galaxy Nexus or wait until this Christmas when the next "Nexus" device is out.
B008HTJLF6,22,14,The speed is amazing, battery life is about 2 days for me, and I haven't had a single crash since I bought it.
B008HTJLF6,22,15,I still keep a few on cuz they come in handy.The device is also incredible fast and smooth, and the screen looks perfect.
B008HTJLF6,22,16,I know it's not a quad core like some newer phones, but it is still very fast at doing everything.
B008HTJLF6,22,17,Verizon decided to opt out of a lot of things that people want this phone for:1) NFC...payments made from the phone using a wireless connection and Google Wallet were switched off by Verizon, all other carriers get it.2)Dropbox--a

B008HTJLF6,22,20,The Galaxy S3 is a 4.0.3
B008HTJLF6,22,21,DONT read the one-star reviews, those people are just moping about a dumb issue...I'll explain.
B008HTJLF6,22,22,The inner specs are still pretty impressive, even compared to the new phones.
B008HTJLF6,22,23,Better than Iphone5 or any other Android phone out there.
B008HTJLF6,22,24,This phone comes with 50GB of dropbox storage...25GB on some carriers...Verizon's gets 0GB3) The bootloader, or way to easily root the device and get inside to tweak everything about the device (what Android is best for since everything is open-source) is locked and encrypted...Verizon is the only one refusing to open it.4)
B008HTJLF6,23,0,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,23,1,Stock apps are almost good enough to stick with (almost, not quite, esp. the keyboard & browser).Hardware: good camera, fantastic AMOLED display.

B008HTJLF6,23,6,The Motorola Droid camera was so slow that it made capturing unique moments nearly impossible.
B008HTJLF6,23,7,The display is huge, and the phone is a bit big for one-handed operations, but it's also thin and fits in your pocket no problem.
B008HTJLF6,23,8,In the month that I've had it I've gotten so used to it that now when I pick up my iPod touch, my immediate reaction is, "why did they design this screen so small?"
B008HTJLF6,23,9,I know you could always do things to get better battery than I've been having, I personally don't care to root this yet or do any of the tweaks.
B008HTJLF6,23,10,Could just be personal preference as I'm used to the power button on top on the Droid.
B008HTJLF6,23,11,Took some very nice pictures at a wedding.Con - Button placement redux (see Major 1 above).
B008HTJLF6,23,12,Coming from an original Motorola Droid, I was a little offput by the large size of this phone.
B008HTJLF6,23,13,it took some time getting used to but i found it a lot easier to multitask and had a lot more features then most phones.
B008HTJLF6,23,14,I'm typing this review on my phone right now.
B008HTJLF6,23,15,I have yet to have a real problem, even tethering works smoothly with multiple devices.I have dropped this phone one time and although it did get some scratches it still looks good and works, no cracked screen or any nonsense.The battery life blows, but I use this thing constantly; movies, internet, reddit, I'm always on it so I just charge it everywhere.
B008HTJLF6,23,16,One small complaint is the battery cover: you have to somewhat pry it off starting with a little slip on top center of the phone.

B008HTJLF6,23,23,This is IMO the best android phone to date.
B008HTJLF6,23,24,Best Android Phone To Date.
B008HTJLF6,24,0,The power button is located on the right side of the phone near the top, and a volume rocker is located on the left side near the top.
B008HTJLF6,24,1,There is a home button on the front of the screen near the bottom on the center.
B008HTJLF6,24,2,I'm hitting the volume keys on the left far too often when turning on/off the phone.
B008HTJLF6,24,3,Could just be personal preference as I'm used to the power button on top on the Droid.
B008HTJLF6,24,4,One small complaint is the battery cover: you have to somewhat pry it off starting with a little slip on top center of the phone.
B008HTJLF6,24,5,Very natural to place your left thumb there in landscape mode.
B008HTJLF6,24,6,I asked many people to take pictures for me, and they invariably hit the volume button by accident which operates the digital zoom.
B008HTJLF6,24,7,The DX took a long time to lock onto GPS signals, but the SG3 is almost instantaneous when outdoors (or inside of a car that is outdoors).
B008HTJLF6,24,8,I personally am terrified of dropping it due to the case.
B008HTJLF6,24,9,Added thoughts after 2 weeks of ownership and experience of travel (air & driving) with the phone (because this review wasn't long enough!).Pro - GPS locks very quickly.
B008HTJLF6,24,10,Sure, there are ways around this, but is annoying nonetheless.Minor - so, yeah, big display, and if you have small-ish hands, 1-handed operations are risky, esp w/the somewhat slippery case.
B008HTJLF6,24,11,The only time my battery life isn't wonderful is when the phone is maxed out searching for signal on Coronado.
B008HTJLF6,24,12,Except you have to unlock the phone to actually launch the apps.
B008HTJLF6,24,13,it took some time getting used to but i found it a lot easier to multitask and had a lot more features then most phones.
B008HTJLF6,24,14,Directly left of that is the headphone input.
B008HTJLF6,24,15,Almost a shame to put a case on it.Good battery life.
B008HTJLF6,24,16,The camera is sweet too, and I like having burst mode.Oh, and its a phone too, and the calls are clear on both ends.

B008HTJLF6,24,19,The home screens run smoothly even using Go Launcher as a home replacement.
B008HTJLF6,24,20,Multitasking is superb as well; you can call and search the web or listen to your navigation while ur on the phone...ridiculous!Voice Interface: I'd estimate like a 96-98% accuracy of the Google voice search (which is EXTREMELY high and crushes "siri" any day).
B008HTJLF6,24,21,In fact, when opening ANY app that uses data, Verizon has a big pop up that asks you to switch to an open wifi so you dont use their data...you have to physically hit the "no" every single time...even when checking facebook you have to.
B008HTJLF6,24,22,DONT read the one-star reviews, those people are just moping about a dumb issue...I'll explain.
B008HTJLF6,24,23,I don't actually mind the plastic construction--doesn't feel "cheap" to me at all--but I'll likely get a TPU case for the grippiness.Shortcuts on your lockscreen is a great feature!
B008HTJLF6,24,24,Not watching movies or anything that requires the LCD to be on for hours at a time, obviously, but for most usage, you should be fine just plugging in at night.Nitpicks:Major 1 - Power button placement on the right, usb port on the bottom.
B008HTJLF6,25,0,I can work this phone hard, I mean constant youtube videos, some games, taking pictures, making some phone calls and stuff, and doing some e-mails (4 email accounts).. even though I don't sync but 6 minutes on every hour.
B008HTJLF6,25,1,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,25,2,I've had this phone for over a month now.. month and few weeks maybe.
B008HTJLF6,25,3,In fact, when opening ANY app that uses data, Verizon has a big pop up that asks you to switch to an open wifi so you dont use their data...you have to physically hit the "no" every single time...even when checking facebook you have to.
B008HTJLF6,25,4,Verizon decided to opt out of a lot of things that people want this phone for:1) NFC...payments made from the phone using a wireless connection and Google Wallet were switched off by Verizon, all other carriers get it.2)Dropbox--a
B008HTJLF6,25,5,I for one, was just tired of waiting and this device was the last one to allow me my unlimited data.If you have questions, ask.
B008HTJLF6,25,6,Since I have a Samsung tablet all my apps and pictures from my tablet automatically came up on my phone!
B008HTJLF6,25,7,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,25,8,The only time my battery life isn't wonderful is when the phone is maxed out searching for signal on Coronado.
B008HTJLF6,25,9,No ring/vibrate switch from the lockscreen either.Anyway, plenty of software nits that can be fixed by downloading replacement apps or rooting.
B008HTJLF6,25,10,Multitasking is superb as well; you can call and search the web or listen to your navigation while ur on the phone...ridiculous!Voice Interface: I'd estimate like a 96-98% accuracy of the Google voice search (which is EXTREMELY high and crushes "siri" any day).
B008HTJLF6,25,11,I've been going a full day on a single charge with medium-heavy usage with plenty to spare.
B008HTJLF6,25,12,This phone with small tweaks which make a huge difference has really become a new phone)I really love this phone..i hope you find my review useful cause i spent time to write it for you people that are deciding ...best of success to you in choosing.
B008HTJLF6,25,13,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,25,14,Moderate use: playing games, making calls, using Tapatalk, checking my Google+, Twitter, Flipboard, and reading other news articles, I can usually get a good 16 hours of battery life.OSI could write several pages just on how much better ICS is than any other Android build I've used, but I'm going to leave it to you to research this.
B008HTJLF6,25,15,I have never had so much as a hiccup with this phone, despite running as many memory intensive programs and games as I can.
B008HTJLF6,25,16,My other phones would be about dead just about, I'd be hurrying to charge a spare up after 8 or 9 hours.I really love the slick design of the phone.. some people say very cheap feeling or quality but I feel complete opposite and they are probably idiots anyways.
B008HTJLF6,25,17,It's sooooo anoying.So, in summary, this is the best phone in the world..no exaggeration, literally every website, including Mac World, rave about this thing...Verizon's version is severly limited due to them being greedy, arrogant, idiotic...well you get the idea.If you want easy access to rooting, hacking(which is encouraged with android devices...google even awards people who hack into their devices to improve them...the Nexus Q being the best example...during the reveal of the device at their conference they stopped to tell people how hackable it is)...get the Galaxy Nexus or wait until this Christmas when the next "Nexus" device is out.
B008HTJLF6,25,18,This phone comes with 50GB of dropbox storage...25GB on some carriers...Verizon's gets 0GB3) The bootloader, or way to easily root the device and get inside to tweak everything about the device (what Android is best for since everything is open-source) is locked and encrypted...Verizon is the only one refusing to open it.4)
B008HTJLF6,25,19,The speed is amazing, battery life is about 2 days for me, and I haven't had a single crash since I bought it.
B008HTJLF6,25,20,Now for the list of things that make this phone the best android phone to date.The S4 processor with two gigs of ram.The Large 4.8 inch screen, which more than holds it own against all comers.The Camera is the best camera you can get on a phone right now bar none.The Battery life is the best on a smartphone outside of the Maxx, one suggestion would be to limit your background processes by going into developer options and change how many background processes your phone will allow.The Gesture controls are a very nice touch.The form factor is very sleek and sexy.Now for a list of things I don't like quite as much.The power button seems a bit flimsy to me, makes me wonder how it will hold up for two years.The signal is not quite as good as it should be for a phone made in 2012, but it is still very solid nonetheless.
B008HTJLF6,25,21,i actually takes a lot longer then i would have expected compared to the commercials and the battery life can be drained fairly quickly.
B008HTJLF6,25,22,The fact that u can so easily switch between recording and picture taking is so awesome.Security: you can set it at whatever level of security you want: pins, face recognition, voice recognition, etc...Apps: it has any app you can possible want like recording phone calls, changing your voice, recording class lecture, games, academics...etc.
B008HTJLF6,25,23,I can usually comfortably get through a whole day of moderate usage with maybe 15-30 percent left.
B008HTJLF6,25,24,Since I turned the phone on it has been wonderful!
