B00COYOAYW,0,23,A little plasticy but feels good still.
B00COYOAYW,0,24,Great phone we love it!
B00COYOAYW,1,0,But, there are not many apps available...
B00COYOAYW,1,1,I could refill my prescriptions with an app on my phone which I cannot do since there isn't an app for it on Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,2,However, there are far more Android apps than Windows Phone apps.
B00COYOAYW,1,3,no windows phone!
B00COYOAYW,1,4,Now know this, Android has over 895,000 apps, while Windows 8 has around 170,000 apps.
B00COYOAYW,1,5,its not android!
B00COYOAYW,1,6,There are no apps.
B00COYOAYW,1,7,Doesn't have all of the same apps available as I had with the Android.
B00COYOAYW,1,8,More apps!
B00COYOAYW,1,9,Ya I can't get all the farting apps that android has.
B00COYOAYW,1,10,I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.
B00COYOAYW,1,11,yea youll miss some apps the i phone has but not many.
B00COYOAYW,1,12,If APPS are important to you, do not get this phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,13,Android has over 800 thousand apps and games while Windows 8 only about 185 thousand.
B00COYOAYW,1,14,Windows 8 phones are terrific.
B00COYOAYW,1,15,Can't use Google or IPhone Apps but Windows 8 have their own apps to make up for it.
B00COYOAYW,1,16,Slowly getting used to the Windows phone being very different from the Androids that I've always used.
B00COYOAYW,1,17,windows 8 phones works really well.
B00COYOAYW,1,18,Having had only Android phones before, I didn't know if I'd like a Windows phone, but I do.
B00COYOAYW,1,19,Are there less app's for Windows Phone?
B00COYOAYW,1,20,Not with Windows 8.
B00COYOAYW,1,21,From Android to Windows.
B00COYOAYW,1,22,This is my first windows phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,23,I think windows phone is a better phone  than android phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,24,This ain't no android.
B00COYOAYW,2,0,Dont let the price deceive you.
B00COYOAYW,2,1,killer price.
B00COYOAYW,2,2,Great price, although I see the price keeps going up and down.

B00COYOAYW,3,14,Battery life to a certain extent is good.
B00COYOAYW,3,15,Seems to have better battery life (2x charge a week vs 1.5x a day).
B00COYOAYW,3,16,battery life great - approx day and a half without using battery saver.
B00COYOAYW,3,17,I keep my phone on "Battery Saver", and I can go 24+ hours and still have about 30% battery life by the end of that cycle.
B00COYOAYW,3,18,Battery life was a godsend as she can use it all day without it dying by 3-4pm.
B00COYOAYW,3,19,Battery life got better as it was used.
B00COYOAYW,3,20,I have had it for 3 days and its  a great phone.
B00COYOAYW,3,21,It has really long battery life so you don't have to charge every few hours and recharges quickly too so that is good.
B00COYOAYW,3,22,Excellent/Don't ever drain battery!
B00COYOAYW,3,23,I charge it every other day.
B00COYOAYW,3,24,Battery life is terrible unless you have the battery saver on.

B00COYOAYW,4,23,Good Phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,24,Great Phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,0,Great Camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,1,If you want a professional camera on a phone, this isn't for you.
B00COYOAYW,5,2,The camera is decent (as phone cameras go), There is no flash though.
B00COYOAYW,5,3,Camera not too great and im use to a front facing camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,4,Wish it had a front camera!
B00COYOAYW,5,5,Great phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,6,But the camera is very good, but no flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,7,I only wish it had a better camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,8,I wish it had a front facing camera!
B00COYOAYW,5,9,Great Camera For The Price.
B00COYOAYW,5,10,Although I wish it had flash for the camera, however the phone works great.
B00COYOAYW,5,11,Very good camera too.
B00COYOAYW,5,12,Has a great look, and camera results are awesome.
B00COYOAYW,5,13,great apps & camera & screen.
B00COYOAYW,5,14,Great phone, great price.
B00COYOAYW,5,15,The camera doesn't seem terrific, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.
B00COYOAYW,5,16,But so far, the phone is great.
B00COYOAYW,5,17,Great phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,18,no front facing camera if you are a skyper
B00COYOAYW,5,19,It's a good phone with great features.
B00COYOAYW,5,20,The only thing is that there isn't a front facing camera but still great!
B00COYOAYW,5,21,Would like a better camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,22,Lastly the camera works very well even though the phone does not have flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,23,There is also no flash on the camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,24,One more thing, even without the flash on the camera, it takes VERY good photos.
B00COYOAYW,6,0,They both come with sim cards and you should be able to do it yourself.
B00COYOAYW,6,1,You have to install the micro sim card unless you already have one.
B00COYOAYW,6,2,SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,6,3,SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,6,4,It won't import from the sd card.
B00COYOAYW,6,5,If you have music to upload using an SD card, I suggest you skip Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,6,6,I added a 32 MB micro SD card and I'm able to put all my pictures and music on my phone.
B00COYOAYW,6,7,Otherwise, you would need to activate the new SIM card which comes with the phone and that renders the old SIM card worthless.Contacts Import:Another fail.
B00COYOAYW,6,8,I expected to be able to have massive storage on my micro-sd card, but the phone doesn't let you easily move/transfer/find/play music etc ... from the micro sd card.
B00COYOAYW,6,9,The back plate is removable to access the micro-SD card, sim card and battery.
B00COYOAYW,6,10,I love the SD card expansion for video and music, only wish I could save apps to the SD card.Now how to unlock this thing to take out of the country
B00COYOAYW,6,11,storage options â€“ 8GB internal memory and an expandable micro SD card.
B00COYOAYW,6,12,Micro SD card for storage expansion, nice camera and good set of apps from Nokia.
B00COYOAYW,6,13,The phone came and I converted my SIM card and it has been great ever since.
B00COYOAYW,6,14,Only has about 7GB storage so you need at least a 16 GB SD card for phone updates, photos, videos etc.
B00COYOAYW,6,15,It seems to want everything stored on internal storage (apps especially) which takes up most of the internal memory.4.
B00COYOAYW,6,16,There's 8GB internal memory as well as microSD slot expanded memory.
B00COYOAYW,6,17,We had standard sim cards previously that are too big.
B00COYOAYW,6,18,It requires a micro sim card which it does not state in the description.
B00COYOAYW,6,19,Phone, Camera, MP3 Player and can add plenty of free apps plus up to a 64MB Micro SD Card.
B00COYOAYW,6,20,Yes, similarly, you can't readily load the update to the SD card and run it from there.
B00COYOAYW,6,21,It took me 5 tries to get the SIM card installed correctly.
B00COYOAYW,6,22,FYI it uses a micro sim.
B00COYOAYW,6,23,Tried a 32GB card, which worked.
B00COYOAYW,6,24,I have a 32GB SD card in it with over 15GB free but I can't get the maps to go to the SD card, they are stuck in internal phone memory.
B00COYOAYW,7,0,Works great as a work phone.
B00COYOAYW,7,1,It has been working great!
B00COYOAYW,7,2,Received the phone on time and in working order.

B00COYOAYW,7,18,This phone was everything we expected and in great condition for a used phone.
B00COYOAYW,7,19,good.
B00COYOAYW,7,20,Still working perfectly.
B00COYOAYW,7,21,Phone works well.
B00COYOAYW,7,22,Good replacement phone.
B00COYOAYW,7,23,Great phone for a great price and one of the easiest phones I've ever used.
B00COYOAYW,7,24,i like it it is very good  thanks.
B00COYOAYW,8,0,Good phone but wont work with service.
B00COYOAYW,8,1,My goal was to get it unlocked for use on AT&T.;
B00COYOAYW,8,2,T-mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,8,3,unless wifi calling (wifi calling is free).
B00COYOAYW,8,4,Let me state that I primarily use this phone with the Wi-Fi calling feature, as I do not have cell service at home.
B00COYOAYW,8,5,Only T-Mobile has this service, and not all TMo phones can do it.
B00COYOAYW,8,6,Works great, but if you have a Contract already make sure you call your provider.
B00COYOAYW,8,7,The phone is great.
B00COYOAYW,8,8,WiFi works great.
B00COYOAYW,8,9,The 521 comes with wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,8,10,WiFi is good enough for me.
B00COYOAYW,8,11,But I know it's coming!Great customer service Amazon!!
B00COYOAYW,8,12,this is a great phone and work great.
B00COYOAYW,8,13,unlock code.
B00COYOAYW,8,14,WiFi works great.
B00COYOAYW,8,15,No service even though it showed service in my area online at T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,8,16,It is a locked phone, but T-Mobile will unlock after 6 month.
B00COYOAYW,8,17,T-mobile wifi calling.*
B00COYOAYW,8,18,a only draw back is lock phone; it's very hard to unlock this phone if you did not purchase from T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,8,19,As t mobile has poor coverage at our home, wifi calling was crucial for this phone to work.
B00COYOAYW,8,20,Well I purchased the 521 to use on a Tmobile MVNO prepaid carrier and it works great!
B00COYOAYW,8,21,Wifi connectivity works well.
B00COYOAYW,8,22,Best wifi calling I ever had.
B00COYOAYW,8,23,You can also use WiFi calling on the phone.
B00COYOAYW,8,24,* It does WiFi calling.
B00COYOAYW,9,0,Fast.
B00COYOAYW,9,1,It also has a fast processor.
B00COYOAYW,9,2,great phone.

B00COYOAYW,9,12,It shipped very fast.
B00COYOAYW,9,13,I tried, and it works great.
B00COYOAYW,9,14,The spoiler here is my other phone is 4G LTE.
B00COYOAYW,9,15,You'll like it if you like WIN 8. it works smoothly and its fast.
B00COYOAYW,9,16,I had the iPhone and galaxy and this phone compares to them really well for the price
B00COYOAYW,9,17,Both work well, great improvement over both samsung galaxy 2 and Sprint.
B00COYOAYW,9,18,Great phone for the price.
B00COYOAYW,9,19,Very fast shipment.
B00COYOAYW,9,20,Functions are smooth but not very fast.
B00COYOAYW,9,21,It is as good as they say.
B00COYOAYW,9,22,I considered a no-contract Samsung Galaxy, no-contract iPhone, etc.
B00COYOAYW,9,23,This phone is not crappy.The UI was extremely smooth (I almost like it more than the Android / IPhone approach).
B00COYOAYW,9,24,The internet is super fast!
B00COYOAYW,10,0,love it.
B00COYOAYW,10,1,I Love This Phone.

B00COYOAYW,10,23,Love It!!!
B00COYOAYW,10,24,LOVE IT.
B00COYOAYW,11,0,This is a good set.
B00COYOAYW,11,1,Plus it does not let you change the background color.
B00COYOAYW,11,2,Good phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,3,Love all the features and the large variety of ring tones and setting options.
B00COYOAYW,11,4,Great features, easy to use...
B00COYOAYW,11,5,Not good.
B00COYOAYW,11,6,She likes it, enough features for her, and no complaints so far.
B00COYOAYW,11,7,I gave the wrong review on the illumishield plastic covers.
B00COYOAYW,11,8,Good so far.
B00COYOAYW,11,9,are you Looking for a change?
B00COYOAYW,11,10,It is very user friendly and has functioned superbly.
B00COYOAYW,11,11,Hubby has customized his ringtones, lock screen, and the windows screen colors.
B00COYOAYW,11,12,It has all the apps we need now, probably because we aren't power users, and more are being added all the time.Give this phone a try, it is really nice and easy to use.
B00COYOAYW,11,13,I'm enjoying the change.
B00COYOAYW,11,14,The way to change brightness manually is buried in the Settings and takes several steps to get there.
B00COYOAYW,11,15,I like having the "back" button below the screen as it's always easy to find.
B00COYOAYW,11,16,Power button: It's on the side.
B00COYOAYW,11,17,You can only choose two background colors: black or grey.
B00COYOAYW,11,18,You can choose color and content of your home screen as well as size, color, and location of the icons.
B00COYOAYW,11,19,The third is that I love the NOSTALGIA ring tone as it sounds like a phone from days gone by.
B00COYOAYW,11,20,Thirdly, while the main screen doesn't allow for much customization, you can change the apps on the live tile and change the color of the tiles as well.
B00COYOAYW,11,21,Buttons below the screen on the front: I'm very happy that all three buttons are capacitive rather than mechanical.
B00COYOAYW,11,22,You can choose  color and content of your home screen as well as size, color, and location of the icons.
B00COYOAYW,11,23,If you're a phone power user, I couldn't suggest this.
B00COYOAYW,11,24,If set to Automatic it doesn't work well for me.
B00COYOAYW,12,0,Value for money.
B00COYOAYW,12,1,good for calling and texting.
B00COYOAYW,12,2,Value for money.
B00COYOAYW,12,3,I use my phone, well, to make phone call and send text messages.
B00COYOAYW,12,4,Good phone if you just talk and text.
B00COYOAYW,12,5,For the money, this is more than a good phone.
B00COYOAYW,12,6,Great phone.
B00COYOAYW,12,7,I will recommend this phone because is a great machine.
B00COYOAYW,12,8,Great phone, does just what it says,I have never had a phone with internet before.
B00COYOAYW,12,9,As far as the phone goes, again for the money, this phone is great.
B00COYOAYW,12,10,It got here fast and I think this is a great value for the money.
B00COYOAYW,12,11,You can say "text Joanna", and then dictate your message and send it.
B00COYOAYW,12,12,Oh yeah, it also makes good phone calls and texts.
B00COYOAYW,12,13,It makes phone calls, allows me to send texts and so much more.
B00COYOAYW,12,14,Seemed to work okay as long as you have added extra money to the account for the 10 cent calls and 20 cent texts.
B00COYOAYW,12,15,A great phone for talk & text & music, but not much else.
B00COYOAYW,12,16,This girl sends something like 5,000 text messages a month.
B00COYOAYW,12,17,great value for this money.
B00COYOAYW,12,18,However, the internet is excellent, and the texting autocomplete is among the best I've encountered.
B00COYOAYW,12,19,If all you need in a phone is talk and text, this phone is perfect for you.
B00COYOAYW,12,20,I can make calls and send texts, which are the basic requirement of a phone.
B00COYOAYW,12,21,I can surf the internet and check email.
B00COYOAYW,12,22,buy it, if you really need a phone(to call or text someone), not recommended for DATA users.
B00COYOAYW,12,23,This is a great feature!
B00COYOAYW,12,24,But while I'm talking or texting, I have no issues.
B00COYOAYW,13,0,touch screen, i think $125 is satisfactory.
B00COYOAYW,13,1,The only problem i had was having to go from my usual big screen 4.7 screens to an actual 4.0 one.
B00COYOAYW,13,2,Phone case.
B00COYOAYW,13,3,The screen is super sens, so much that you can hover your finger over the screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,4,I have added a screen protector and a protective case to the phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,5,I have not tried a non-glare screen protector.2.
B00COYOAYW,13,6,When I recently put a screen protector on I couldn't find any scratches on the screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,7,The Lumia is the first touch screen phone I have used.
B00COYOAYW,13,8,Because the case didn't fit my phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,9,wrong screen protector.
B00COYOAYW,13,10,This phone is thinner with a bigger screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,11,There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time.
B00COYOAYW,13,12,I bought screen protector and phone back cover as suggested by Amazaon.
B00COYOAYW,13,13,When I just want to get to the home screen, it'll reboot.
B00COYOAYW,13,14,wish the screen was bigger like the nokia lumia 900 i really like the amoled screen on that phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,15,Ability to have a high contrast screen (for those with poor eyesight or someone who wants a cool looking screen)7.
B00COYOAYW,13,16,The 521 display touch screen is also very easy to use as it is quite sensitive.-
B00COYOAYW,13,17,Once I got a good case for it the problems with it leaping from my pocket were fixed.
B00COYOAYW,13,18,Nice case...fit correctly on my nokia lumina 521however the screen protector was for model nokia 520and did not fit my 521
B00COYOAYW,13,19,Got to find a better case for it though.
B00COYOAYW,13,20,I like the big screen so that the buttons are bigger.
B00COYOAYW,13,21,Screen should be brighter and screen should not shut-off as quickly when plugged in.4.
B00COYOAYW,13,22,Phone is nice - did not come with screen protector or car charger.
B00COYOAYW,13,23,Nokia or the windowsphone store looking for these accessories such as the screen protectors and cases.
B00COYOAYW,13,24,Touch screen sensitivity adjustable.12.
B00COYOAYW,14,0,As for the apps I don't use that many apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,1,Now know this, Android has over 895,000 apps, while Windows 8 has around 170,000 apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,2,Ya I can't get all the farting apps that android has.
B00COYOAYW,14,3,apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,4,This is a WINDOWS phone not an Android Phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,5,The apps seems limited compared to apps you can get for iphone/droid.
B00COYOAYW,14,6,But think about all the useless apps that people have polluted Google play with, the apps that aren't really apps, and the apps that aren't  free.
B00COYOAYW,14,7,You can download an autoshoot app and there you have it.
B00COYOAYW,14,8,Some key apps I would like to have are only on the iPhone and Android.-
B00COYOAYW,14,9,Windows apps are different from those the Android market.
B00COYOAYW,14,10,For now, quite a few of the iphone apps I used do not have a windows version yet.
B00COYOAYW,14,11,These apps are free on iPhone or Android.2.
B00COYOAYW,14,12,Nothing I can really do about that.The apple app store has by far the largest selection of apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,13,But I can't find any app like that on my phone.
B00COYOAYW,14,14,Also when I tried to download a app it didn't let me and I can't even download any apps at all which is sad.
B00COYOAYW,14,15,From Android to Windows.
B00COYOAYW,14,16,Either it is the windows OS or one of the other apps on the phone so I can't say if the windows OS is slow.
B00COYOAYW,14,17,Lack of apps, doesn't have my bank app yet, I use this app all the time2.
B00COYOAYW,14,18,The apps are limited.
B00COYOAYW,14,19,Companies make apps for iphones and androids and few make them for windows phones.3.)
B00COYOAYW,14,20,You would need a window 8 machine if you are able to develop some apps for yourself.
B00COYOAYW,14,21,Lacks apps - some of popular apps missing that are found on iPhone and Android such as flipboard.
B00COYOAYW,14,22,No cohesion between WP's app store and the Win8 store.
B00COYOAYW,14,23,The unifying visual themes are forced throughout each and every app, which means the dysfunction of windows 8 can now be had in every endeavor.-the
B00COYOAYW,14,24,There are few functional apps, so if you rely on google docs, you're in for some frustration.-voice
B00COYOAYW,15,0,What a great buy
B00COYOAYW,15,1,i dont recommend to anyone to buy stuf from them
B00COYOAYW,15,2,don't buy.
B00COYOAYW,15,3,I'd buy it again.
B00COYOAYW,15,4,Never buying a Nokia again.
B00COYOAYW,15,5,Great buy love it I would recommend  it.
B00COYOAYW,15,6,I will never buy another Nokia product again.
B00COYOAYW,15,7,Bought it for my 13 year old she loves it Great buy love it I would recommend  Nokia Lumia 521
B00COYOAYW,15,8,It's been about six months and still going.
B00COYOAYW,15,9,Great Value!
B00COYOAYW,15,10,4 months later, I am still using this phone, and my motivation to purchase another has been dwindled to nothing by this phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,11,I just bought this phone 2 months ago.
B00COYOAYW,15,12,I bought this phone because I had previously liked other Nokia phones I had purchased.
B00COYOAYW,15,13,I should 've bought it there: less stress and efforts...
B00COYOAYW,15,14,This is a great phone for the money.
B00COYOAYW,15,15,Nokia phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,16,dont buy.
B00COYOAYW,15,17,great.
B00COYOAYW,15,18,Great ,cheap phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,19,Great phone!
B00COYOAYW,15,20,you will never repent buying it.
B00COYOAYW,15,21,Which replaced the Nokia n8 phone I just bought her 6 months ago.
B00COYOAYW,15,22,Would Recommend.
B00COYOAYW,15,23,Great phone for the price.
B00COYOAYW,15,24,For this price this phone does everything.
B00COYOAYW,16,0,now the phone wont turn on at all but it shows that the battery is charging.
B00COYOAYW,16,1,Very Poor Battery Life.
B00COYOAYW,16,2,Problems with battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,3,So it blinks (charging) all never charges.
B00COYOAYW,16,4,The charging ion would come up when I would charge but it just wouldn't power up.
B00COYOAYW,16,5,Battery Life.
B00COYOAYW,16,6,The battery would not hold a charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,7,Now it will not even charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,8,I powered the phone off (it had about 80% battery charge).
B00COYOAYW,16,9,Even when the phone did work the battery life was terrible.
B00COYOAYW,16,10,I charge my phone usually every other day.
B00COYOAYW,16,11,I tried everything, if i plug it in (tried for about 17hr charge) it will not keep the charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,12,It wasn't until a few days later that my phone started turning off on it's own even though the battery was fully charged.
B00COYOAYW,16,13,stop working within a month.
B00COYOAYW,16,14,Can I just get 15 or so batteries and replace them each month so I have a good working phone month after month?
B00COYOAYW,16,15,I had to take the battery out.
B00COYOAYW,16,16,Phone keeps shutting off, even after battery is fully charged.
B00COYOAYW,16,17,After 28 days it started to heat at the charging port.
B00COYOAYW,16,18,The battery is just over 1/2 charged now.-
B00COYOAYW,16,19,One day it will go dead in a few hrs and the next time will last 3 days and I don't use it that much.
B00COYOAYW,16,20,I would have to charge it multiple times a day.
B00COYOAYW,16,21,For the first month I kept it in battery-saving mode and one overnight charge would  last 3 days.
B00COYOAYW,16,22,The screen is working, it shows a battery charging, but it won't hold the charge and won't power up.
B00COYOAYW,16,23,Apparently all it needed was a little charging.
B00COYOAYW,16,24,When I plug it in, it says its charging so I've been charging it for a couple of hours but the phone still won't turn on.
B00COYOAYW,17,0,When on speaker it's not clear at all.
B00COYOAYW,17,1,i couldn't use my headphone to listen to music because the sound was really bad, so that I had to buy a new headphone.
B00COYOAYW,17,2,Listen up people!!!
B00COYOAYW,17,3,Loud Speaker.
B00COYOAYW,17,4,Unfortunately, It has bad reception (unless it has to do with T-Mobile) and when on speaker there is a lot of interruption.
B00COYOAYW,17,5,The most important feature for me is that I can hear people clearly without static or disturbance through the connection.
B00COYOAYW,17,6,Others sometimes have a hard time hearing me.
B00COYOAYW,17,7,My calls drop and my bluetooth keeps getting disconnected.
B00COYOAYW,17,8,I need a phone with better mic and speaker since I use the speakerphone a lot.
B00COYOAYW,17,9,no problems with poor connections or dropped calls after 3-4 weeks.2.
B00COYOAYW,17,10,Always getting cut off....dropping calls.
B00COYOAYW,17,11,By the time I turn on the car engine and back out my driveway, it is always connected.
B00COYOAYW,17,12,The music sounds great!
B00COYOAYW,17,13,I haven't heard on any bad things with this phone.
B00COYOAYW,17,14,Using it for a month now, and people tell me it sounds like cell quality.
B00COYOAYW,17,15,The headphone jack!
B00COYOAYW,17,16,I CANT BELIEVE SOME OF THE REVIEWS ON HERE, TALKING BAD ABOUT THE PHONE.
B00COYOAYW,17,17,The speaker is also loud as others have mentioned.
B00COYOAYW,17,18,They didn't fix the problem!
B00COYOAYW,17,19,Listened to a ball game recently with it...set it on the counter and I could hear it clearly from 30 ft.
B00COYOAYW,17,20,Piece of junk no
B00COYOAYW,17,21,have had this phone since November and the audio or speakers are horrible.
B00COYOAYW,17,22,Bought a car that has a Windows-based voice rec/Bluetooth interface and ithe phone just drops the connection each time.
B00COYOAYW,17,23,Sometimes I have to enter a PIN, sometimes I have to tap on it, sometimes a call will come in and I can hear them over Bluetooth but they can't hear me -- so annoying!
B00COYOAYW,17,24,My Samsung Galaxy also an annoying problem when trying to connect to my built in Bluetooth speaker system in my car.
B00COYOAYW,18,0,Overall ,good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,1,The camera is not that good.
B00COYOAYW,18,2,GOOD.
B00COYOAYW,18,3,Camera is too bad.
B00COYOAYW,18,4,So far, so good.
B00COYOAYW,18,5,It Be Good.
B00COYOAYW,18,6,good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,7,its a good phone when it comes to being a phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,8,The camera doesn't even have a flash.
B00COYOAYW,18,9,good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,10,so far so good.
B00COYOAYW,18,11,As for the good, the camera is ....ok.
B00COYOAYW,18,12,better than expected.
B00COYOAYW,18,13,no camera flash
B00COYOAYW,18,14,Good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,15,this phone executes that really well. it doesn't have a front camera.
B00COYOAYW,18,16,good otherwise
B00COYOAYW,18,17,No Good Nokia!
B00COYOAYW,18,18,Battery life is great and camera takes good pictures.
B00COYOAYW,18,19,The camera no good for taking photos where there is no light/when it's dark out.
B00COYOAYW,18,20,Camera is very bad and has no flash.
B00COYOAYW,18,21,I just wish it had a better camera like the new Nokia phones.
B00COYOAYW,18,22,(n8 has way better camera but that is it)This still has a good camera but no flash but nothing the right lighting wont solve.
B00COYOAYW,18,23,It doesn't have a front facing camera.
B00COYOAYW,18,24,Its is good and cheapest smartphone.
B00COYOAYW,19,0,SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,1,Sim Card is used.
B00COYOAYW,19,2,Comes with SIM card (fyi).
B00COYOAYW,19,3,Nice phone but when I couldn't get the SIM cards to activate with MetroPCS, I took the phones to them.They tried with their SIM cards and couldn't get the phone going.
B00COYOAYW,19,4,Phone didn't work with MetroPCS.
B00COYOAYW,19,5,It came with a sim card, but I took my old T-Mobile sim card, and cut it to fit.
B00COYOAYW,19,6,Bought two different sim cards through t mobile still didn't work.
B00COYOAYW,19,7,So, don't through away the sim that comes with the lumia 521; you might need it if your old phone doesn't have a micro sim card.
B00COYOAYW,19,8,i would have kept it if my sim card was compatible...
B00COYOAYW,19,9,Otherwise, you would need to activate the new SIM card which comes with the phone and that renders the old SIM card worthless.Contacts Import:Another fail.
B00COYOAYW,19,10,I am very disappointed with this purchase and found that the sim card was already used.
B00COYOAYW,19,11,It came in a sealed box with a SIM card and activation instructions.I used my existing T-Mobile SIM card and it worked right out of the box.
B00COYOAYW,19,12,I went to Tmobile and they activated the new SIM card and transferred all data from the old SIM card and turned on my new phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,13,Sim Card Sucks.
B00COYOAYW,19,14,We ahd to purchase another sim card from T Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,19,15,They mentioned that they don't cut sim cards, but they could transfer my information to a micro sim card.
B00COYOAYW,19,16,Could not use my current SIM card in the device because it takes a mini sim and I have a regular size sim card
B00COYOAYW,19,17,It even came with micro-SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,18,very good phone for the money its t-mobile but i used 2 different pre-paid sim cards in it just to see if it would worked and it did.
B00COYOAYW,19,19,IT WORKED!
B00COYOAYW,19,20,Well how come it is not working?I put the SIM card in, turn it on and the Maps app is empty.
B00COYOAYW,19,21,The sim card that came with this new phone could not load my old account onto it when I got the new phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,22,No memory.
B00COYOAYW,19,23,Phone seems good but I called T-Mobile costumer service to activate it and they said the sim card was used.
B00COYOAYW,19,24,If you have an old SIM card you can just stick it in and go.
B00COYOAYW,20,0,Quit working, no return to Amazon.
B00COYOAYW,20,1,How do i return it?
B00COYOAYW,20,2,I tried to return it to Amazon but they said I had missed the return date and would not take it back, so much for Amazon's return policy.
B00COYOAYW,20,3,to purchase another phone since could not get this phone to work.
B00COYOAYW,20,4,The phone stopped working less than 2 weeks after I received it.
B00COYOAYW,20,5,When asked to return or try and replace it I was told no and it was one day after the 30 day warranty this happened.
B00COYOAYW,20,6,I returned it and got my money back.
B00COYOAYW,20,7,Had to return them.
B00COYOAYW,20,8,We returned.
B00COYOAYW,20,9,I am thinking the seller sent me a refurbished one.
B00COYOAYW,20,10,Arrived on time.
B00COYOAYW,20,11,I returned the phone to Amazon and got a replacement.
B00COYOAYW,20,12,There is no warranty for this item.
B00COYOAYW,20,13,It took them a whole 6 days after I ordered to even ship the item.
B00COYOAYW,20,14,Btw one came that would not charge and I returned it no problem to amazon and got a replacement phone even before I had shipped the broken one ...kudos amazon !
B00COYOAYW,20,15,No time to wait!
B00COYOAYW,20,16,Be careful when you purchase this product.
B00COYOAYW,20,17,Ended up returning the phone because of this.
B00COYOAYW,20,18,So I returned it.
B00COYOAYW,20,19,The battery is made in Finland, but needs to be sent to Asia before it can be shipped to the U.S. and they just don't have the battery.
B00COYOAYW,20,20,I am really disappointed with this phone purchase.
B00COYOAYW,20,21,I had to return it again.
B00COYOAYW,20,22,Problems with battery.
B00COYOAYW,20,23,No, they do not know when they will have the battery, but they will ship it to me when they get it.
B00COYOAYW,20,24,About ten days later, got a replacement with no back cover!
B00COYOAYW,21,0,It was not the phone, it was the service provider.
B00COYOAYW,21,1,Then I called T-mobile customer support and they found that the settings was the problem.
B00COYOAYW,21,2,Not sure if it's the device or T-Mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,21,3,Nothing has worked.
B00COYOAYW,21,4,One quick call to T-mobile support and I was up and running.
B00COYOAYW,21,5,I contacted Nokia customer service.
B00COYOAYW,21,6,This is the worst customer service I have ever had regrading a cell phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,7,I got the same problem in the replacement and T-mobile stores could not fix the problem.
B00COYOAYW,21,8,To start with, I had problems with the phone as it would come-up with T-mobile and then no service.
B00COYOAYW,21,9,Also TMobile was if little help.
B00COYOAYW,21,10,It took some talking to customer service to get it working correctly, but once they got it fixed, it worked well for about a month or two.
B00COYOAYW,21,11,GPS doesn't work unless you are T-Mobile customer.
B00COYOAYW,21,12,I went to the T-Mobile store to try it and it did not work, but works well with the 925.
B00COYOAYW,21,13,T-mobile stores said it is the problem with the phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,14,so i bought it and added TMOBILE  to it,  prepaid service.
B00COYOAYW,21,15,Horrible phone and service.
B00COYOAYW,21,16,It only does it while I'm at work.
B00COYOAYW,21,17,The customer service representative said he the problem would be escalated and I would be contacted later in the day.Despite being told I would be contacted again, I was not contacted.April 28, 2014, today, I called Nokia customer care.
B00COYOAYW,21,18,Customer service and Tech Support could hear me just fine.
B00COYOAYW,21,19,I am still waiting on them to call me back.
B00COYOAYW,21,20,Poor product quality and poor customer service.
B00COYOAYW,21,21,Tech support ultimately suggested that the problem might be the phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,22,It turns out there is a problem with the phone.I went to T-Mobile in February and they took $20 from me and arranged to have a new phone sent to me.
B00COYOAYW,21,23,took long time to get it to work had to call several people to figure out what was wrong finally called people made the phone and they fixed it
B00COYOAYW,21,24,I had this phone for 4 months ,then it did not work anymore,constantly showing No Service.
B00COYOAYW,22,0,The device can be used.
B00COYOAYW,22,1,Major upgrade from my HTC MyTouch 4G.
B00COYOAYW,22,2,I had purchase others devices and the experiences have been better than this one.
B00COYOAYW,22,3,What an upgrade from Android!
B00COYOAYW,22,4,I think its better, and faster than an android phone, no it is faster.
B00COYOAYW,22,5,Tried using a battery from an ATT 520 and that does not work either.
B00COYOAYW,22,6,I was replacing a TMobile (HTC) G2.
B00COYOAYW,22,7,4G Rarely works.
B00COYOAYW,22,8,I've had the last 3 generations of Galaxy S devices, tried many of the Verizon Droid line devices (X, Droid, Droid2).
B00COYOAYW,22,9,With half the processor of the Android phone it was replacing, it still feels like a hardware upgrade.*
B00COYOAYW,22,10,Its slow!
B00COYOAYW,22,11,All in all a really terrible and disappointing experience.
B00COYOAYW,22,12,I've had the last 3 generations of Galaxy S devices, tried many of the Verizon Droid line devices (X, Droid, Droid2).
B00COYOAYW,22,13,That may be due to the 1GHz dual core processor, but it may also be due to not having dual band WiFi so I couldn't hook it up to my 5GHz WiFi router which is much faster than the 2.4GHz band.-
B00COYOAYW,22,14,No budget 4g phones to buy and all arrows were pointing to this one.
B00COYOAYW,22,15,That is an insane deal for a phone with a dual core processor, 4G connectivity and a micro SD slot.
B00COYOAYW,22,16,Since purchasing this phone, I've also picked up a Samsung Galaxy S4 & an HTC One.
B00COYOAYW,22,17,Window Phone has some annoying issues which Adroid phone does not experience.
B00COYOAYW,22,18,OK, so I know this is supposed to be a review of the phone; it's hardware and software.
B00COYOAYW,22,19,It's not That often, but often enough to be really annoying.With the 2 big issues, I consider 2-star a high rating I'd give.Would I recommend?
B00COYOAYW,22,20,Stop reading my review here, and go buy this thing!
B00COYOAYW,22,21,Great phone at an even better price.
B00COYOAYW,22,22,This phone does not work in 4G mode.
B00COYOAYW,22,23,Any Android phone that you find in this price segment will be using an old OS (you'll be lucky to get Gingerbread), & extremely dated hardware.
B00COYOAYW,22,24,Win8 is much faster than I expected with no lag.Also runs all of the new Windows apps, unlike the no contract Androids that are running 2 year old "Honeycomb" that cannot run new Android software.Overall, great hardware for the price.
B00COYOAYW,23,0,Easy to use phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,1,new to this type of phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,2,For the non-technical type, like myself, the instructions were impossible to follow.
B00COYOAYW,23,3,Almost every word I type.
B00COYOAYW,23,4,This phone was impossible to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,5,Impossible to figure out.
B00COYOAYW,23,6,I have nothing bad to say about the phone, it does every thing i need it to do.
B00COYOAYW,23,7,but i read reviews before buying it and i did not read any type saying that they had the type of problems I'm having.
B00COYOAYW,23,8,The phone is pretty easy to set up.
B00COYOAYW,23,9,its real easy to use
B00COYOAYW,23,10,2 small things wrong..
B00COYOAYW,23,11,Yes.- Easy to use?
B00COYOAYW,23,12,Calling someone, real easy.Not a bad deal at all.
B00COYOAYW,23,13,hate to imaging a fat fingered person typing on this thing.
B00COYOAYW,23,14,Win 8 OS is fairly easy to figure out, and online tutorials are easy to find.4)
B00COYOAYW,23,15,The user interfaces are generally not well organized.Check lists in some apps are more difficult to use than in others.
B00COYOAYW,23,16,So easy to use for the novice smart phone user.
B00COYOAYW,23,17,Unlike Apple products, the virtual keyboard makes it clear when a letter is capitalized.Cons- Nowadays this phone is relatively mediocre- Call quality is ok- Touchscreen is somewhat touchy and the virtual keyboard can be difficult to use- The Wifi calling feature almost never works, and when it's on it interferes with texting- The biggest problem with it is that it's a Windows phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,18,I found it quite easy to use.
B00COYOAYW,23,19,My last phone was a Nokia X2 with a standard buttons and a real QWERTY keyboard.
B00COYOAYW,23,20,Typing text messages is a breeze.
B00COYOAYW,23,21,The phone goes two days or more for me, but I only make calls and texts.
B00COYOAYW,23,22,I do need to use a stylus with the onscreen keyboard.
B00COYOAYW,23,23,So easy.
B00COYOAYW,23,24,It's very easy to use this phone.*
B00COYOAYW,24,0,After i press the power button, it shows "goodbye", then screen turn black.
B00COYOAYW,24,1,I wish they'd put that bing button on the left tho.
B00COYOAYW,24,2,I've tried with turning off the screen while on the call - the same issue.
B00COYOAYW,24,3,I don't like the way the phone calls are set up, I am use to missed, placed, dial, etc.
B00COYOAYW,24,4,First, there're bubbles and lines under the screen film.
B00COYOAYW,24,5,Only locked up once but was able to hold power/lock button down and restart it.
B00COYOAYW,24,6,from time to time getting stuck, .Have to turn it off to get it back.
B00COYOAYW,24,7,has only buttons for volume (up and down), on/off, and camera.
B00COYOAYW,24,8,The power button is accidently pressed all the time.
B00COYOAYW,24,9,Just flicking the screen sometmes will take you to a fb page that you havent seen before!
B00COYOAYW,24,10,I hit the power button on the side, and I got the screen that said slide down to power off - hurray for physical buttons - but touching the screen still produced no results.
B00COYOAYW,24,11,Even if you lock the screen while on a call it unlocks after a bit and happens all over again.Otherwise, no complaints.
B00COYOAYW,24,12,watch the buttons on the side.
B00COYOAYW,24,13,If you miss the vibration or ring, then you don't know you got a text/call until the next time you turn the phone on.Sigh.
B00COYOAYW,24,14,The the screen would turn off even when  I am trying to call out and then the power/screen  button is intermitent working 3. the Speaker is really muffled and has a high tone level4.
B00COYOAYW,24,15,The delete call option is actually easier and quicker to use than the options menu and buttons on the X2.
B00COYOAYW,24,16,Even the buttons come off with the cover!
B00COYOAYW,24,17,The external buttons, especially the camera button, are just right.
B00COYOAYW,24,18,volume buttons suck.
B00COYOAYW,24,19,Maybe the screen lock can be worked around.
B00COYOAYW,24,20,I find it easiest to do by releasing the side opposite the power button first.
B00COYOAYW,24,21,I had placed a call that went to the recipient's voicemail, but when I tried to hang up, tapping 'end call,' or the home and back buttons didn't do anything.
B00COYOAYW,24,22,There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time.
B00COYOAYW,24,23,And a few times, the touch screen has become unresponsive.
B00COYOAYW,24,24,Power button: It's on the side.
B00COYOAYW,25,0,The phone is just used to call and text.
B00COYOAYW,25,1,I can make calls get texts and pictures text.
B00COYOAYW,25,2,It tries to send text and email messages ONCE and that's it.
B00COYOAYW,25,3,I wanted a phone for wi-fi calling and no data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,4,I had set wi-fi calling as wi-fi only.
B00COYOAYW,25,5,It ok if you don't like picture messages.
B00COYOAYW,25,6,They need a phone for calls, texts, and checking their email.
B00COYOAYW,25,7,Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.
B00COYOAYW,25,8,So, wherever there is no wifi, I can only talk and text.
B00COYOAYW,25,9,However this phone did make wi-fi calls and allow internet access without a data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,10,The only problem that we have found is that it will not send picture texts (maybe because we are not paying for data, we only use the wifi).
B00COYOAYW,25,11,T-mobile wifi calling.*
B00COYOAYW,25,12,can't get on internet,can't access facebook,can't send pictures just not satified with it.
B00COYOAYW,25,13,Each time I made one call and sent once text, then put his SIM back into his phone.
B00COYOAYW,25,14,Check out nokiasetup dot com>People and Messaging>Voice Text Messaging.
B00COYOAYW,25,15,The 521 comes with wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,16,If you turn this on, youâ€™ll be able to send and receive voice calls and text messages over any Wi-Fi network with enough bandwidth.
B00COYOAYW,25,17,Phone calls are clear and the phone also comes with Wi-Fi calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,18,unless wifi calling (wifi calling is free).
B00COYOAYW,25,19,The phone goes two days or more for me, but I only make calls and texts.
B00COYOAYW,25,20,Talk text and web.
B00COYOAYW,25,21,Same with text (unless you use say the Facebook messaging app).
B00COYOAYW,25,22,Enable wifi calling for my account on tmobile.com2.
B00COYOAYW,25,23,T-Mobile informed me that this phone could be used without a data plan.
B00COYOAYW,25,24,I use my phone, well, to make phone call and send text messages.
B004T36GCU,0,0,The size and the screen is good.
B004T36GCU,0,1,The phone is amazing, very fast and have a big screen, i think, for the price, is a nice phone
B004T36GCU,0,2,The phone is just great.
B004T36GCU,0,3,The screen response is good and the screen size is big enough to watch movies.
B004T36GCU,0,4,Beautiful screen - 4.3" is a perfect size, clear and sharp2.
B004T36GCU,0,5,Nice Phone.
B004T36GCU,0,6,Very Good phone for the price.
B004T36GCU,0,7,Great Screen, Fast Processor, Awful Battery.
B004T36GCU,0,8,Brightness of the screen is an issue in sunlight.
B004T36GCU,0,9,A very nice HTC phone with a beautiful screen that, unfortunately, didn't work for me.
B004T36GCU,0,10,The phone works perfectly, with a big screen yet still a reasonable size, it's all it needs to be.
B004T36GCU,0,11,Nice.
B004T36GCU,0,12,the battery is not good.
B004T36GCU,0,13,It has athe perfect size scree for my hands.
B004T36GCU,0,14,The phone feels solid.
B004T36GCU,0,15,The display is amazing, the touch screen is flawless.
B004T36GCU,0,16,Picture quality is also good.
B004T36GCU,0,17,Small and easy to carry with one hand.
B004T36GCU,0,18,For most of the HTCs, their big screen is the only attractive thing about it.
B004T36GCU,0,19,This is a nice device.
B004T36GCU,0,20,It's pretty fast.
B004T36GCU,0,21,The display is large yet the phone is small and thin enough to fit into a pocket.
B004T36GCU,0,22,Love this phone as it has so many funcitons and features I can use.
B004T36GCU,0,23,I then got the Ultimate Juice Defender app, and so far, sooooo good!
B004T36GCU,0,24,Camera is awesome, and the size is great.
B004T36GCU,1,0,The phone works and I can run apps on it.
B004T36GCU,1,1,Great Phone.
B004T36GCU,1,2,window was really great.
B004T36GCU,1,3,ANDROID IS GREAT BUT THE PHONE SUXXXXXXXXXXXX!!!!!!!
B004T36GCU,1,4,My first android.
B004T36GCU,1,5,I then got the Ultimate Juice Defender app, and so far, sooooo good!
B004T36GCU,1,6,But, unbeknownst to me, some apps can cause blockers.
B004T36GCU,1,7,I love this phone, is the best phone i ever had, only the android os version is old, need an actualization
B004T36GCU,1,8,Love the the phone, my only issue is, i am still trying to download the BB app, other than that the phone is great!
B004T36GCU,1,9,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,1,10,good.
B004T36GCU,1,11,The phone works well.
B004T36GCU,1,12,Love it.
B004T36GCU,1,13,Android app store is superb.
B004T36GCU,1,14,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,1,15,The Google Play market is perfection, the speed of downloading apps is pretty remarkable, too.
B004T36GCU,1,16,I even had to look on youtube how to do it cause i was giving up.. anyways its a good phone!
B004T36GCU,1,17,Had android 2.3(gingerbread on it) so thats a big plus.
B004T36GCU,1,18,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,1,19,It's also my first smart phone I've owned, and I'm pretty biased towards the Android market; I have no plans of ever owning an iPhone.
B004T36GCU,1,20,I can not download games that i would like to play, such as plants vs zombies 2 and it losses the signal very easy
B004T36GCU,1,21,Wifi and Android performs identically to a Samsung tablet with the same 2.3 operating system.
B004T36GCU,1,22,That it is to say it wasnt working at all.
B004T36GCU,1,23,I am with T-Mobile and could not have all the apps.
B004T36GCU,1,24,Easy to use, many features, many pre-down loaded apps, great price, highly suggest.
B004T36GCU,2,0,great phone.
B004T36GCU,2,1,Great price.
B004T36GCU,2,2,Very good phone for the price!
B004T36GCU,2,3,So overall I'd say this is a great product for a great price.
B004T36GCU,2,4,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,2,5,Good smart phone for a little price!
B004T36GCU,2,6,Good phone at a cheap price.
B004T36GCU,2,7,Good price, nice phone.
B004T36GCU,2,8,Very Good phone for the price.
B004T36GCU,2,9,Good phone for cheap price.
B004T36GCU,2,10,not such a great smartphone.
B004T36GCU,2,11,GREAT DEAL.
B004T36GCU,2,12,The phone is just great.
B004T36GCU,2,13,so far so good.
B004T36GCU,2,14,This is a cool samrt phone and the price is just as great.
B004T36GCU,2,15,I think i got it for a good deal.
B004T36GCU,2,16,Good Product.
B004T36GCU,2,17,NOT VERY GOOD PRODUCT.
B004T36GCU,2,18,Good quality phone, do not regret purchase.
B004T36GCU,2,19,The phone works great and is more than I expected.
B004T36GCU,2,20,I bought this phone as a used product.
B004T36GCU,2,21,nice product.
B004T36GCU,2,22,Easy to use, many features, many pre-down loaded apps, great price, highly suggest.
B004T36GCU,2,23,It's not a Nokia, but its impressive for a smartphone.
B004T36GCU,2,24,I can recommend to anyone that is into smart phone
B004T36GCU,3,0,I tried to take the battery out and try again.
B004T36GCU,3,1,Other phones that I have owned, the battery life had lasted me 3 or 4 days.
B004T36GCU,3,2,Great phone, but no battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,3,the battery is not good.
B004T36GCU,3,4,I have to charge it atleast once a day.
B004T36GCU,3,5,Good! i really like this phone except its batery life.
B004T36GCU,3,6,The battery life is not as bad as some have made it out to be.
B004T36GCU,3,7,Very good smart phone.Everything is good, except that the battery is not strong enough, and could just last for one day long...
B004T36GCU,3,8,Great Phone but bad battery.
B004T36GCU,3,9,it lasts 2-3 days most for me.
B004T36GCU,3,10,The only bad thing about it is the battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,11,battery wasn't good and got replaced.
B004T36GCU,3,12,The battery is so-so--you have to charge it every night but sometimes the battery will last great all day and then others, it's down to yellow before dinner, and there are no more programs running on it than any other day.
B004T36GCU,3,13,I run CyanogenMod 7.2.0 on this device with the TalonACE CFS kernel which results in good battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,14,so far so good.
B004T36GCU,3,15,Still discovering features.Battery life is only good for a day.
B004T36GCU,3,16,The phone is pretty good in all aspects except battery life.
B004T36GCU,3,17,FULLY CHARGED BATTERY DOES NOT LAST UP TO 24H RS, EXCEPT IF YOU DO NOT USE THE PHONE AT ALL.2.
B004T36GCU,3,18,Would not turn back on when i got home from work, letting it charge.
B004T36GCU,3,19,Battery Life - with nothing installed on this phone, and my heavy use, the battery will drain about 20% or more in one hour, and others who have it say the same thing.
B004T36GCU,3,20,And the battery is terrible, barely lasts a day after charging.
B004T36GCU,3,21,After doing this the battery seems to do pretty good.
B004T36GCU,3,22,Great Phone but Batt Life sucks.
B004T36GCU,3,23,On an additional note, all those warnings of poor battery life, I've gotten the battery so far to go 36 to 40 hours btwn charges.
B004T36GCU,3,24,Battery removal is akin to medical surgery.
B004T36GCU,4,0,good.
B004T36GCU,4,1,Good phone.
B004T36GCU,4,2,Good phone.
B004T36GCU,4,3,Really good.
B004T36GCU,4,4,The phone is good.
B004T36GCU,4,5,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,4,6,Not good for anything else.
B004T36GCU,4,7,The call sound is pretty good and the speaker phone works well.
B004T36GCU,4,8,pretty good.
B004T36GCU,4,9,Sound in speaker very bad, internet hoop up, is good, screen was good also.
B004T36GCU,4,10,Phone reception and sound quality are an issue.
B004T36GCU,4,11,when listening to music with headset quality is really good, maybe even better than other phones (using quality headset).
B004T36GCU,4,12,Picture quality is also good.
B004T36GCU,4,13,Again, ok for just making calls.
B004T36GCU,4,14,Ok for just a phone to make and take calls.
B004T36GCU,4,15,Over all I like the phone but every once in a while the sound will go out.
B004T36GCU,4,16,Great phone...with a few flaws.
B004T36GCU,4,17,Excellent so far.
B004T36GCU,4,18,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,4,19,After doing this the battery seems to do pretty good.
B004T36GCU,4,20,Its pretty good overall.
B004T36GCU,4,21,I enjoy this phone, it was a great buy.
B004T36GCU,4,22,The phone look nice, some features are ok, but it has a grand problem with the signal reception.
B004T36GCU,4,23,It had good audio quality when playing or streaming music.
B004T36GCU,4,24,It's a good phone with a lot of features and some flaws.
B004T36GCU,5,0,The picture is great and the camera is great.
B004T36GCU,5,1,Great camera
B004T36GCU,5,2,I would give it five star but no front camera will only get it four.
B004T36GCU,5,3,a great phone so far...
B004T36GCU,5,4,Good smart phone for a little price!
B004T36GCU,5,5,The only thing I am missing is a front camera for video calls.
B004T36GCU,5,6,Camera 8MP is good, but some pictures once token can not be stored if you use flash.
B004T36GCU,5,7,The 8Mp camera is like cell phone camera, not like any kind of 8Mp camera.
B004T36GCU,5,8,It's a really great smart phone for a little price!The only thing that needs it's a back camera for video calls!But all the rest it's a great phone I'm very pleased!
B004T36GCU,5,9,Lacks of a front camera and rear camera below average.
B004T36GCU,5,10,This is a great phone, it is fast, the display is awesome, touch is great, camera is great and it has everything you would expect from an advanced first line smart phone.
B004T36GCU,5,11,the battery is not good.
B004T36GCU,5,12,The camera is also very blurry, unlike the one I had before.
B004T36GCU,5,13,It has good picture quality for a phone it is sensitive to movement when taking the pictures.
B004T36GCU,5,14,It has scratches on the screen and on the camera.
B004T36GCU,5,15,It is a great phone, very functional, easy to handle.Great pictures and videos.I recommend it.
B004T36GCU,5,16,Because it has 8 megapixels I was expected the camera to be sharp with great resolution.
B004T36GCU,5,17,After doing this the battery seems to do pretty good.
B004T36GCU,5,18,Camera is awesome, and the size is great.
B004T36GCU,5,19,Picture messages not working, there is no reception at some places and some calls are drope out, the battery runs out fast but the video recording is clear and great
B004T36GCU,5,20,The best phone in the world has a great screen and downloads so fast and takes great pictures but battery doesnt last no time and i guess thats the down side to having a great phone theres always going to be cons.
B004T36GCU,5,21,Plus, as it's supposed to be a 4G phone,  there is no front camera.
B004T36GCU,5,22,Great Phone but bad battery.
B004T36GCU,5,23,The camera, yes 8 MP.
B004T36GCU,5,24,The pictures are very blury!
B004T36GCU,6,0,wasnt working.
B004T36GCU,6,1,Just insert your sim card n use.
B004T36GCU,6,2,this phone has only one sim card and a SD card which is not a sim card so make sure it has what the description says.
B004T36GCU,6,3,Also suggest you have a microSD with a lot of memory cause the phone memory is not sufficient.
B004T36GCU,6,4,And lastly, they did not include a memory card, meaning I cant even take pictures.
B004T36GCU,6,5,SD Card issues.
B004T36GCU,6,6,I put my SIM card in it and it kept saying "No SIM card in phone".
B004T36GCU,6,7,I don't like this phone because it wouldn't ready my memory card.
B004T36GCU,6,8,Not possible if they don't come with an SD Card.
B004T36GCU,6,9,The phone comes with an 8gb sd card for storage of photos, games, music, ect.
B004T36GCU,6,10,The phoen ia a great phone applications are A+ everything works well.
B004T36GCU,6,11,That cell phone was not working the display so i had to pay to fix that so it was not really good
B004T36GCU,6,12,When I first got the phone and then got my sim chip to work in it the phone was amazing.
B004T36GCU,6,13,Whenever I wanted to take a picture, it kept asking me to insert an SD card when in fact it was already inserted so I had to keep opening and reinserting until the phone recognized the card.
B004T36GCU,6,14,Missing MicroSD card.
B004T36GCU,6,15,The SIM card did work so we could not use the apps, even if it did work we probably would have sent it back because it was not user friendly.
B004T36GCU,6,16,It's just a wonderful phone even though I haven't slot the sim card into it...but the phone doesn't come with ear phone.....why?
B004T36GCU,6,17,First off the phone came without the 8g sd card that it said it came with, Thank goodness I bought a 32g card when i bought the phone.
B004T36GCU,6,18,No matter which one we used, no micro SD card would work on this phone, which is sad because a good majority of the phone's functions need one.
B004T36GCU,6,19,the order should have sd ram memory with it, but their was no sd memory, I need my 8GB memory please
B004T36GCU,6,20,I popped my international SIM into the device and it worked like a charm.
B004T36GCU,6,21,However I would recommend that you purchase it works well.
B004T36GCU,6,22,This device didn't work at all couldn't read any of the SIM cards.
B004T36GCU,6,23,Not a good buy.
B004T36GCU,6,24,Having removable and expandable SD storage is great.In the box was the phone, battery, quick-start guide, a USB cable and USB power adapter.
B004T36GCU,7,0,i want to order one but i'm not sure if it will work good there.
B004T36GCU,7,1,Everything works great.
B004T36GCU,7,2,It works great!
B004T36GCU,7,3,great phone.
B004T36GCU,7,4,the phone was looking great, but is not working as expected.
B004T36GCU,7,5,The phone works well.
B004T36GCU,7,6,other than that my phone works perfectly.
B004T36GCU,7,7,Great while it lasts.
B004T36GCU,7,8,but it just does not work.what
B004T36GCU,7,9,However I would recommend that you purchase it works well.
B004T36GCU,7,10,Not all that great!
B004T36GCU,7,11,This Phone took a long time to come after ordering.
B004T36GCU,7,12,Great phone ,fast arrival, working good and everything but not new.
B004T36GCU,7,13,The phone was damaged and did not work.
B004T36GCU,7,14,a great phone so far...
B004T36GCU,7,15,good for the price.
B004T36GCU,7,16,When I do have a signal the phone works great.
B004T36GCU,7,17,Also I have interruption while talking, and this is all the time.
B004T36GCU,7,18,Good Product.
B004T36GCU,7,19,The phone is a good size and I got it in a timely manor.My phone freezes and drops calls, I have to take out the battery which is not an easy thing to do in order for it to work every time.
B004T36GCU,7,20,the item i received.
B004T36GCU,7,21,I think i got it for a good deal.
B004T36GCU,7,22,i received item and the battery was not working i sent an email to the buyer, he right away sent me another one, even though its not working properly but i think its good for the price
B004T36GCU,7,23,I ordered this phone because I already had one before and loved it.
B004T36GCU,7,24,I am happy with my purchase.
B004T36GCU,8,0,Did not work right on T-Mobile.
B004T36GCU,8,1,It says that the phone is T-Mobile unlocked but it NOT UNLOCKED.

B004T36GCU,10,12,working good, fast,easy to use.
B004T36GCU,10,13,It didn't work for me so I don't recommend it.
B004T36GCU,10,14,I would recommend the phone for anyone from casual user up to those that love their gadgets.
B004T36GCU,10,15,I have already recommended it to my friends, I phone has everything that I needed.
B004T36GCU,10,16,When I first got the phone it was working fine, I love the screen and everything.
B004T36GCU,10,17,NOT ALL FEATURES WORK.
B004T36GCU,10,18,It is easy to operate.I recommend it.
B004T36GCU,10,19,haven't figured how to work it yet.
B004T36GCU,10,20,It works just fine.
B004T36GCU,10,21,The phone looks good.
B004T36GCU,10,22,I do love this phone, but having issues.
B004T36GCU,10,23,recommend
B004T36GCU,10,24,It's nice and simple.
B004T36GCU,11,0,The phone is good.
B004T36GCU,11,1,Really good.
B004T36GCU,11,2,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,11,3,A good phone with low ringing tone.
B004T36GCU,11,4,The layout is user-friendly--it's easy to get from the main menu to apps to the phone features, and it allows you to pick your favorite apps for the main menu.
B004T36GCU,11,5,I can't even use this app on this phone I just purchased because I can't change the language settings to english (us) or (uk).
B004T36GCU,11,6,It's nice and simple.
B004T36GCU,11,7,nice and simple.
B004T36GCU,11,8,It locks up every other day it seems, but other than that it works ok.
B004T36GCU,11,9,also i got a note on the box saying "we have gone green click on the link below to get user manual.. are you serious? a user manual?
B004T36GCU,11,10,After doing some research, I had to set the wallpaper and settings to "default" which helped this problem.
B004T36GCU,11,11,other than that my phone works perfectly.
B004T36GCU,11,12,I've had it for a few weeks now and I have no complaints.
B004T36GCU,11,13,A very good phone, but it comes locked...
B004T36GCU,11,14,great phone.
B004T36GCU,11,15,The online features allow for four windows to be opened at once, and it's easy to navigate and use the finger-pinch movement to zoom in or out of a page.
B004T36GCU,11,16,worked great but kept shutting off and volume button was broke.
B004T36GCU,11,17,The phoen ia a great phone applications are A+ everything works well.
B004T36GCU,11,18,My only complaint is that the bottom of the phone started to strip within a week of using it.
B004T36GCU,11,19,It gets the job done and easy to figure out.
B004T36GCU,11,20,Camera is awesome, and the size is great.
B004T36GCU,11,21,I uploaded my own customer photos to go along with this review.
B004T36GCU,11,22,Please click on the Customer Uploaded photos to view my pictures.The first seller I will review is iCellPhones.
B004T36GCU,11,23,Sound in speaker very bad, internet hoop up, is good, screen was good also.
B004T36GCU,11,24,The phone seems to work fine - It would have been better if there was a user's manual with it.I was not able to even download one from the Internet!
B004T36GCU,12,0,Great while it lasts.
B004T36GCU,12,1,It's a waste of money.
B004T36GCU,12,2,It's a waste of money.
B004T36GCU,12,3,Great Call Quality5.
B004T36GCU,12,4,Don't waste your money.
B004T36GCU,12,5,well at least with the features I can access . . .
B004T36GCU,12,6,Hard to read, text and mail not organized very well.
B004T36GCU,12,7,I would NOT recommend this phone, any positive reviews you have read have been written by people who had not had their phone for very long and want to brag it up (because like I said when it was new it was a very nice phone).
B004T36GCU,12,8,Before I made the purchase, I read all the specifications to ensure it had this specific feature.
B004T36GCU,12,9,It didn't work for me so I don't recommend it.
B004T36GCU,12,10,I then got the Ultimate Juice Defender app, and so far, sooooo good!
B004T36GCU,12,11,I wouldn't recommend it for any serious photography, but it works good for taking pictures of my family, pets, ect.
B004T36GCU,12,12,Not a good buy.
B004T36GCU,12,13,Great phone from a good company.
B004T36GCU,12,14,I have to send it back.
B004T36GCU,12,15,I also save a TON of data usage, another plus (save me some money!)2.
B004T36GCU,12,16,i really enjoyed this phone so much dont listen to other people this phone was great but picture message wouldnt send or recieve bugged alot but had a great time with this phone
B004T36GCU,12,17,LOVED THIS PHONE.
B004T36GCU,12,18,This phone has one of the biggest screens on the market right now, which is great if you surf the web mainly on your phone.
B004T36GCU,12,19,apart from that it is really worth that money.
B004T36GCU,12,20,The touchscreen is about as good as you can expect for a phone; there's only so much room you have to hit each key, and there are arrow keys that allow you to weave through emails or text messages.
B004T36GCU,12,21,Easy to use, many features, many pre-down loaded apps, great price, highly suggest.
B004T36GCU,12,22,Voice quality of this product is not at all good, I bought it with out reading the reviews.If you are looking for a good phone with all basic features, its better not to buy this one
B004T36GCU,12,23,Would probably look for something else next time
B004T36GCU,12,24,working good, fast,easy to use.
B004T36GCU,13,0,It seemed like the phone had been thrown in there, with a slightly off-set screen protector, slightly dusty too.Was it new?
B004T36GCU,13,1,However, there are many cases, where this does not work.
B004T36GCU,13,2,Even with a 780p display, the colors are vivid with the S-LCD screen.*Conclusion*A
B004T36GCU,13,3,The phone has problems.
B004T36GCU,13,4,Inherent screen freeze with this phone.
B004T36GCU,13,5,Oh and one more thing, after a while if you are clumsy like me, the touch screen doesn't respond very well to large fingers, I have small fine fingers and I can use it with no problem.
B004T36GCU,13,6,No scratches, screen was nice and came in the original box.
B004T36GCU,13,7,In some cases, the phone will start up once you remove the battery and put it back in.
B004T36GCU,13,8,Casing flimsy - Battery BAD.
B004T36GCU,13,9,Take your time in taking off the cover for the battery also it is hard to remove.
B004T36GCU,13,10,I have problems with this phone.
B004T36GCU,13,11,So now it works fine however the casing is very very flimsy.
B004T36GCU,13,12,It was sopoussed to be phones working perfectly
B004T36GCU,13,13,I feel cheated and deceived.
B004T36GCU,13,14,I have problems with this phone I bought on February 15.
B004T36GCU,13,15,Disappointed big time
B004T36GCU,13,16,This was not a big deal and after I put my protective case on, I can't even see them...  not that they were that bad to begin with.
B004T36GCU,13,17,It did not work for me.
B004T36GCU,13,18,Two phones has scratches, and sometimes turn off.plus is quite slow during use.
B004T36GCU,13,19,THE PHONE IS NICE.
B004T36GCU,13,20,The screen response is good and the screen size is big enough to watch movies.
B004T36GCU,13,21,This could cause it to get scratched easily, but with a case on the problem is easily solved.Overview: So really, the only con is battery life.
B004T36GCU,13,22,The phone works perfectly, with a big screen yet still a reasonable size, it's all it needs to be.
B004T36GCU,13,23,Secondly eventhough the phone looked fine when i opened the box with a closer look i noticed that the lcd screen was slightly lifted from the phone.
B004T36GCU,13,24,Phone was never dropped, in a hard protective case from day 1, screen protector from day 1 and now less than 6 months later the phone itself will not charge the battery.
B004T36GCU,14,0,Don't get if you need to download apps.
B004T36GCU,14,1,This phone will not download google apps.
B004T36GCU,14,2,Does not download google apps!!
B004T36GCU,14,3,The updates.
B004T36GCU,14,4,Every time I open it, I find the phone is running about 15 apps in the background, most of them apps that came pre-loaded on the phone, apps that I NEVER use and that I can't get rid of.
B004T36GCU,14,5,This is why you can not buy anything on line but apps.
B004T36GCU,14,6,this phone is unable to download certain apps in the play store.
B004T36GCU,14,7,GPS doesn't work.
B004T36GCU,14,8,Also, after that reset, I never was able to load Google Play again, leaving me with the old android market app.
B004T36GCU,14,9,Update.
B004T36GCU,14,10,Once certain apps get downloaded the phone starts to freeze like it has too many cookies or a small virus on it.
B004T36GCU,14,11,second the phone can not handle more then 1 or 2 apps installed from the play store.
B004T36GCU,14,12,By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring.
B004T36GCU,14,13,Android app store is superb.
B004T36GCU,14,14,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,14,15,Too many software issues.
B004T36GCU,14,16,Updates majorly slow this phone down.
B004T36GCU,14,17,But, unbeknownst to me, some apps can cause blockers.
B004T36GCU,14,18,I bought this phone new, and to date although the os has updated, whenever Itry to update it I  cannot.
B004T36GCU,14,19,The phone works good, but I have a problem finding some applications and widgets I use to have...-
B004T36GCU,14,20,Since the problem was with factory installed software I did not see how this was a fix.
B004T36GCU,14,21,some games freeze it up, but some do not, just have to mess around with that and figure out which games work.
B004T36GCU,14,22,An other thing that I don't like is that when I download applications some of them won't go on the SD card and can only be in the phone memory.
B004T36GCU,14,23,I got this to use the square credit card reader but it requires an app to be downloaded from the google store.
B004T36GCU,14,24,If you do buy it make sure you buy an Aker battery which will make the freeze issue slightly better.
B004T36GCU,15,0,dont buy.
B004T36GCU,15,1,Buy something else.
B004T36GCU,15,2,I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE!!!
B004T36GCU,15,3,DONT BUY TO USE OUTSIDE OF THE US.
B004T36GCU,15,4,Dont buy this.
B004T36GCU,15,5,I would NOT recommend buying this phone.
B004T36GCU,15,6,I would not recommend anyone to buy this
B004T36GCU,15,7,buy this phoneever
B004T36GCU,15,8,I will recommend it.!
B004T36GCU,15,9,I will not buy another phone from Amazon again.
B004T36GCU,15,10,I bought this phone about a year ago.
B004T36GCU,15,11,Good Product.
B004T36GCU,15,12,I bought this phone because it was a great deal.
B004T36GCU,15,13,It's been over a month since I bought them so I can't return them.
B004T36GCU,15,14,I wouldnt buy it again.
B004T36GCU,15,15,Bad Purchase.
B004T36GCU,15,16,Good product.
B004T36GCU,15,17,Do not buy this phone.
B004T36GCU,15,18,I wish I have never purchased it and would not recommend it.
B004T36GCU,15,19,Great for about 30 days.
B004T36GCU,15,20,When I bought this phone it was good, now it has problems and I can't get a replacement because of the time that I had the phone.
B004T36GCU,15,21,I bought the phone and by the time i was out of the states it stopped working.
B004T36GCU,15,22,Overall I think my lesson is to try a phone out first before purchasing when at all possible.
B004T36GCU,15,23,I like it but it'll only last two years...
B004T36GCU,15,24,Dropped it once 3 months ago and nothing was wrong.When buying your phone think about how it'll work out 6 months from now before you get into a 2 year contract you can't get out of.
B004T36GCU,16,0,Missing Battery.
B004T36GCU,16,1,Battery wasn't working.
B004T36GCU,16,2,Battery Problems.
B004T36GCU,16,3,Battery issue.
B004T36GCU,16,4,Battery issues.
B004T36GCU,16,5,Poor battery life.
B004T36GCU,16,6,Got to go back to Mexico with new battery next week.
B004T36GCU,16,7,The battery lasts for 4 hours...
B004T36GCU,16,8,Phone would not charge after first day of use.
B004T36GCU,16,9,it won't charge anymore unless i put something between the battery and battery door to make the battery go all the way in and seat better.
B004T36GCU,16,10,battery doesn't hold the charge very well, the phone itself isn't bad, except of the battery, something needs to be done to fix the issue.
B004T36GCU,16,11,stop working proberly after a month.
B004T36GCU,16,12,The phone didn't even charge.
B004T36GCU,16,13,it didn't work.
B004T36GCU,16,14,Am having battery problem. the battery does not last not even 3 hours straight i have to be keep charging the phone
B004T36GCU,16,15,Battery life is about 3/4 of a day with normal use.
B004T36GCU,16,16,The phone freezes all the time so i have to take the battery out to unfreeze it.
B004T36GCU,16,17,BATTERY ISSUES.
B004T36GCU,16,18,I can't even see if my phone works.....
B004T36GCU,16,19,The battery started heating up after only 2 weeks of use.
B004T36GCU,16,20,Phone does not hold charge.
B004T36GCU,16,21,I placed in the battery and put the phone to charge, but it then shut off and would not come on at all.
B004T36GCU,16,22,the phone works well however the battery last very little i keep turning off the apps and remove them and same issue battery does not last ((
B004T36GCU,16,23,The battery life is just pathetic.
B004T36GCU,16,24,Glitchy and no battery life.
B004T36GCU,17,0,when people would call they wouldnt be able to get through most of the time.
B004T36GCU,17,1,it would disconnect calls while in a call.
B004T36GCU,17,2,As if that isn't bad enough, the call quality is terrible!!!
B004T36GCU,17,3,thank you for getting my phone on time,but the one thing it doesn't work very good.If u put the phone on speaker people can't hear you. is very bad that u cannot put your phone on speaker.Last buy from this seller.
B004T36GCU,17,4,The call sound is pretty good and the speaker phone works well.
B004T36GCU,17,5,problem on phone.
B004T36GCU,17,6,phone stopped working deffective phone.
B004T36GCU,17,7,I get a lot of dropped calls also.
B004T36GCU,17,8,Phone reception and sound quality are an issue.
B004T36GCU,17,9,I've tried many ways to fix it, from restart it, to call somebody and unplug headphone while talking and put it on speaker (which fixed the problem at first but that trick doesn't work now), I even tried to do factory reset way but none of these tricks work.
B004T36GCU,17,10,It has a fm radio tuner built in but it uses the ear buds as a antenna so you can't listen to the radio with bluetooth headphones.
B004T36GCU,17,11,I however have some issues.The maximum ring volume is not loud.
B004T36GCU,17,12,Non-working earpiece speaker.
B004T36GCU,17,13,I wish I had listen to the bad reviews before I bought it.
B004T36GCU,17,14,Had some problem with the 'speaker' - hence a problem with the basic functionality.
B004T36GCU,17,15,Also I have interruption while talking, and this is all the time.
B004T36GCU,17,16,While in speaker, people complain of it being too noisy.
B004T36GCU,17,17,Ringer wasn't very loud I sent the phone back my husband is hard of hearing and he couldn't hardly hear it
B004T36GCU,17,18,Anyhow, the phone works fine.
B004T36GCU,17,19,thought was great at first but two weeks later phone started giving me problems kept rebooting on its own would allow me to make calls phone was giving me lots of problems
B004T36GCU,17,20,I am used to hearing my previous phone ring wherever I am in the house, but this one I dont.
B004T36GCU,17,21,I can't play any music or videos unless I plug in my headphone.
B004T36GCU,17,22,when listening to music with headset quality is really good, maybe even better than other phones (using quality headset).
B004T36GCU,17,23,The phone works great and is more than I expected.
B004T36GCU,17,24,Just received it and already having problem.
B004T36GCU,18,0,Really Good!
B004T36GCU,18,1,Good Phone.
B004T36GCU,18,2,not good.!!!
B004T36GCU,18,3,Not good.
B004T36GCU,18,4,It was not good.
B004T36GCU,18,5,I am sure it was probably a good phone.
B004T36GCU,18,6,Everything but the camera.
B004T36GCU,18,7,Other than that is pretty good phone.
B004T36GCU,18,8,Because others said their phone was good.
B004T36GCU,18,9,may be good.
B004T36GCU,18,10,So far so good.
B004T36GCU,18,11,NOt good.
B004T36GCU,18,12,This phone was no good.
B004T36GCU,18,13,good phone.
B004T36GCU,18,14,It isn't even really a good paperweight!!!
B004T36GCU,18,15,Better than I had expected.
B004T36GCU,18,16,Not bad.
B004T36GCU,18,17,My expectation about the phone was bad.
B004T36GCU,18,18,Not a good choice.
B004T36GCU,18,19,The battery life is abysmal, and the camera is lacking.
B004T36GCU,18,20,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good.
B004T36GCU,18,21,Very good cell phone.
B004T36GCU,18,22,Voice quality of this product is not at all good, I bought it with out reading the reviews.If you are looking for a good phone with all basic features, its better not to buy this one
B004T36GCU,18,23,It has the worst camera I have seen on any phone.
B004T36GCU,18,24,it didnot meet my  expectations.
B004T36GCU,19,0,I put my SIM card in it and it kept saying "No SIM card in phone".
B004T36GCU,19,1,this phone has only one sim card and a SD card which is not a sim card so make sure it has what the description says.
B004T36GCU,19,2,Not working.
B004T36GCU,19,3,When the phone card was placed in it, it just would not work.
B004T36GCU,19,4,It tells me that their is no sim in the phone.
B004T36GCU,19,5,This says it is an unlocked phone...yet it did not work for our t-mobile SIM card.
B004T36GCU,19,6,Put the At&t; SIM card in and was on my way!
B004T36GCU,19,7,It does not have the SD card, I'm not sure it might be that way.
B004T36GCU,19,8,Works well.
B004T36GCU,19,9,It hardly works.
B004T36GCU,19,10,Once I put in the old sim card the phone seems to be fine.
B004T36GCU,19,11,not working, would not recognize the att sim card.
B004T36GCU,19,12,The phone didnt came with Memory Card.
B004T36GCU,19,13,The 8gig SD card is missing, but I had another one to use.
B004T36GCU,19,14,This device didn't work at all couldn't read any of the SIM cards.
B004T36GCU,19,15,Missing MicroSD card.
B004T36GCU,19,16,Everything works just fine for my tmobile sim i already have.
B004T36GCU,19,17,Not possible if they don't come with an SD Card.
B004T36GCU,19,18,Even adding an SD card, that's still not valid.
B004T36GCU,19,19,First off the phone came without the 8g sd card that it said it came with, Thank goodness I bought a 32g card when i bought the phone.
B004T36GCU,19,20,No micro sd card.
B004T36GCU,19,21,Other than that phone works fine.
B004T36GCU,19,22,But it worked and I was relieved.
B004T36GCU,19,23,And cant seem to read the sim card at times.
B004T36GCU,19,24,Anyhow, the phone works fine.
B004T36GCU,20,0,return my money.
B004T36GCU,20,1,I had to return the product.
B004T36GCU,20,2,Phone works, seller doesn't.
B004T36GCU,20,3,Will be returning it.
B004T36GCU,20,4,never got this order.
B004T36GCU,20,5,I've returned this phone probably 4-5 times and they've sent me back the same phone.. Same problems occur.
B004T36GCU,20,6,the phone does not work do not.
B004T36GCU,20,7,I want to return it.
B004T36GCU,20,8,I purchased 2 of these from Amazon as a reseller.
B004T36GCU,20,9,I do not know whether it had to do with just that one phone - may be defective but I had to return it to the seller.
B004T36GCU,20,10,DOPif, if at the time of the purchase was to be of RD $ 6,386.00
B004T36GCU,20,11,Phone has no resepition, I am not using the phone at this time.
B004T36GCU,20,12,The company has approved the return, but I am liable for return postage as well.
B004T36GCU,20,13,I did not immediately purchase replacement insurance.
B004T36GCU,20,14,Which means I have to buy that from the amazon marketplace or run after the seller to send me one.
B004T36GCU,20,15,product is very damage.
B004T36GCU,20,16,Even with Amazon fulfilling the orders, you'll still be out money.
B004T36GCU,20,17,I would be careful when buy a phone from this seller.
B004T36GCU,20,18,i received a damaged phone.
B004T36GCU,20,19,Product works well.
B004T36GCU,20,20,I have to work on it before it will come back on.
B004T36GCU,20,21,I can't return the phone because the return policy doesn't permit it.
B004T36GCU,20,22,I will be returning this item because I paid to much for a used phone.
B004T36GCU,20,23,Be careful About Warranty.
B004T36GCU,20,24,Just received it and already having problem.
B004T36GCU,21,0,What a pathetic service?
B004T36GCU,21,1,Still missed about 50% of the calls.
B004T36GCU,21,2,Sometimes it just misses a call.
B004T36GCU,21,3,I have problem with drop calls, it might be a network problem I don't know!
B004T36GCU,21,4,did not work, had to return.
B004T36GCU,21,5,I wouldn't recommened this phone to any one unless u have an at@t service.
B004T36GCU,21,6,I even went to T-mobile store, they told me they had tried it before for some other customers and it did not work well with their network.
B004T36GCU,21,7,it's an at&t; phone , and it's says that works on T-mobile carrier too.but,
B004T36GCU,21,8,I called my company (T-mobile) and they helped me with that.
B004T36GCU,21,9,I was told this my a customer service rep through AT&T; i am now about to receive my fourth one of these..
B004T36GCU,21,10,I wish it worked.
B004T36GCU,21,11,it does not work at all.
B004T36GCU,21,12,If you are in an area with spotty service this phone doesnt work for some reason.
B004T36GCU,21,13,I have no service in most areas.
B004T36GCU,21,14,Within 3 weeks it stopped working.
B004T36GCU,21,15,HTC :- Worst Customer Service and Phone.
B004T36GCU,21,16,The problem is, when I pick up the phone, the signal drops to either one bar or it shows no service.
B004T36GCU,21,17,This may be because i am using it with T-Mobile, while it is AT&T; phone.
B004T36GCU,21,18,Thank for your help.
B004T36GCU,21,19,Need a help.
B004T36GCU,21,20,T-Mobile...uh no!
B004T36GCU,21,21,problems with this product.
B004T36GCU,21,22,Finally we decided to buy another one from T-mobile and that one is working well.
B004T36GCU,21,23,I made several calls to get technical help to make it work , but it was not compatable with T-mobile, and the signals are so weak.
B004T36GCU,21,24,Some network issues are there not sure if its phone issue or network issue

B004T36GCU,22,21,This phone is supposed to be 4G but I have yet to experience any 4G capabilities.
B004T36GCU,22,22,There are differences between both phones, mainly the Desire HD does NOT support 4G.
B004T36GCU,22,23,I ordered the Inspire 4G but got the Desire HD with an Inspire 4G sticker on the box.
B004T36GCU,22,24,HTC Inspire 4G Phone.
B004T36GCU,23,0,Excelente equipo y fÃ¡cil de utilizar el unico punto negativo es que la bateria no dura mucho y el telefono es un poco pesado
B004T36GCU,23,1,Mi queja es la siguiente, llegÃ³ la caja conteniendo el celular solicitado con dos cuestiones, primero faltaba la memory card que se especifica en el contenido de la caja y segundo es evidente que en la malla que cubre lo que seria el auriular, que es la vista del equipo, estÃ¡ como torcida, eso debe ser defecto de fabrica.
B004T36GCU,23,2,Yo realicÃ© esta queja al recibir el producto, peero lo hice por un canal equivocado,
B004T36GCU,23,3,typed unlocked but i found at&t; word typed on the phone back ,absolutely i am not sure that it will work in egypt.and
B004T36GCU,23,4,muy bueno.
B004T36GCU,23,5,Phone turns off when I take pictures, open texts, even open the phone from being on stand-by.
B004T36GCU,23,6,I got this phone about a year ago and returned it for a full refund.. it worked pretty well, I remember having a few small issues with it but not what they were exactly.. one problem was the button to turn the screen off and on was so small, you had to press it extremely hard until it hurt your finger.
B004T36GCU,23,7,And sometimes when typing online, the keyboard will pop up and the online screem will move in such a position that I can't see what I'm typing (this is especially bad with email).
B004T36GCU,23,8,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,23,9,As if that isn't bad enough, the call quality is terrible!!!
B004T36GCU,23,10,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,23,11,I've returned this phone probably 4-5 times and they've sent me back the same phone.. Same problems occur.
B004T36GCU,23,12,It was easy to customize and visually appealing, which is pretty standard for HTC products.
B004T36GCU,23,13,the phone works well however the battery last very little i keep turning off the apps and remove them and same issue battery does not last ((
B004T36GCU,23,14,Absolutely worthless.
B004T36GCU,23,15,The phone works good, but that was a complete dissapointment.
B004T36GCU,23,16,Absolute worst phone I've ever had... Granted, I have T-Mobile.
B004T36GCU,23,17,Even my old blackberry curve has better call quality and battery life.
B004T36GCU,23,18,NOT UNLOCKED.
B004T36GCU,23,19,I'm not going to go through the hassle of doing that.On the other side, I thought the interface was very easy to use and I really wish it would have worked out for me.
B004T36GCU,23,20,The contact import (via Bluetooth) went really well and it was easy to use straight out of the box.
B004T36GCU,23,21,The phone freezes all the time so i have to take the battery out to unfreeze it.
B004T36GCU,23,22,It would give me error messages when I tried to send a text message too when i did have signal.
B004T36GCU,23,23,The interface on this phone was hard to use also.
B004T36GCU,23,24,then the phone wouldnt let me text certain users on my contact list.
B004T36GCU,24,0,button is not working.
B004T36GCU,24,1,when I would lay it down it would turn off and the volume button was broke off... but other than that phone looked new
B004T36GCU,24,2,The phone locks up all of the time.
B004T36GCU,24,3,worked great but kept shutting off and volume button was broke.
B004T36GCU,24,4,The Volume button don't work, I have audio problem.
B004T36GCU,24,5,the phone is unlocked, the button on the side is not working, the screen is blocked by personal password and i got the battery after aweek of waiting.
B004T36GCU,24,6,My complaints are that at times it shuts down without any cause and I couldn't get it to turn back on.
B004T36GCU,24,7,fits my need very well, but i have to say, the volume button on the left actually doesn't work very well.
B004T36GCU,24,8,Still missed about 50% of the calls.
B004T36GCU,24,9,Sometimes it just misses a call.
B004T36GCU,24,10,The phone is slow and some times the plastic cover at the back side of bottom cames out when you try to take out from your pocket.
B004T36GCU,24,11,It is locked phone.
B004T36GCU,24,12,Hardly ideal for something you will be pressing all the time..
B004T36GCU,24,13,Granted, I have not tried anything drastic to reboot the phone, but thusfar, the power button is not restarting the phone.
B004T36GCU,24,14,some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen).
B004T36GCU,24,15,phone looks new, but came with something off volume button to work properly detached hope I will be in contact after trying all functions as it supposed to be a new phone.!
B004T36GCU,24,16,Once it started up, I noticed that the left side of the phone did not work.
B004T36GCU,24,17,It locks up every other day it seems, but other than that it works ok.
B004T36GCU,24,18,When I turned it on first it came on then in a few minutes a red signal came on after that I couldn't get it off the power button did not respond.
B004T36GCU,24,19,the phone doesnt ring or vibrate when i get a incoming call or text i've reset the phone 3 -4 times and it happens everytime.
B004T36GCU,24,20,Would reset ring tone and delete ring tones.
B004T36GCU,24,21,The phone works ok but after half hr to an hr it shuts off an im unable to power it on back using the power button therefore I have take out the battery to power it on .
B004T36GCU,24,22,I was adjusting the volume on Spotify and the plastic volume rocker just...fell out of the phone, and it's difficult to replace.-Called
B004T36GCU,24,23,When comparing the two phones side by side, I noticed that one of the phones has a void sticker over one screw underneath the side cover.
B004T36GCU,24,24,This is after shutting down Wi-Fi, changing the connection settings to preserve battery life, and keeping the screen dimmer than I prefer.
B004T36GCU,25,0,Apps and Text work, voice does not.
B004T36GCU,25,1,When I frist got the phone, it was working fine, I could send picture texts.
B004T36GCU,25,2,It would give me error messages when I tried to send a text message too when i did have signal.
B004T36GCU,25,3,The only way to get the phone on the internet is with wifi.
B004T36GCU,25,4,After changing all of the presets I still was not able to connect to the internet with my data plan or home wifi.
B004T36GCU,25,5,After charging, I was able to make call and send & receive messages but could not get on the network for internet services.
B004T36GCU,25,6,I first got it set up, it seemed everything worked fine.
B004T36GCU,25,7,Then after about 2 wks. it would no longer let me send picture text.
B004T36GCU,25,8,This phone is set up to be used in Canada.
B004T36GCU,25,9,Making it nearly impossible to download anything or make calls or text.
B004T36GCU,25,10,Features  were fine but was unable to send or receive calls so I had to return it.
B004T36GCU,25,11,Had to send it back.
B004T36GCU,25,12,then the phone wouldnt let me text certain users on my contact list.
B004T36GCU,25,13,The only problem is my phones 3g wont work so I always have to look for open wi-fi.
B004T36GCU,25,14,Also, it is an unlocked phone so I was told that my picture messages will never be able to send and I will not be able to download incoming multimedia messages.
B004T36GCU,25,15,But then i started adding apps and connecting my e-mail and the voice went out (microphone).
B004T36GCU,25,16,but i can send regular text.
B004T36GCU,25,17,Still missed about 50% of the calls.
B004T36GCU,25,18,Sometimes it just misses a call.
B004T36GCU,25,19,Unable to receive/send pictures and unable to use internet due to not truly unlocked....phone wants to use at&t; internet and data but I have tmobile
B004T36GCU,25,20,I only sometimes receive MMS messages and I can NEVER send them.I rue spending the money on this phone.
B004T36GCU,25,21,Nice phone, but internet would never work.
B004T36GCU,25,22,They are now sending me a fourth one...i wish i had never had this phone ever....the phone is great...when it actually works...I also know that this phone was recalled from walmart because i work with the cell phones there
B004T36GCU,25,23,When I started using the phone, a lot of things weren't functioning like picture text, no internet connection even when there is a wifi service to connect to, sometimes the phone will automatically cancel my calls & voicemails, very  very slow internet service, social networks wont log in and host of other problems.
B004T36GCU,25,24,The only thing work is the internet as the po ket tablet.
