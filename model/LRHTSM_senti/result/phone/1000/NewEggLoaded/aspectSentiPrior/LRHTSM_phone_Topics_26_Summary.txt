B00COYOAYW,0,0,Size is nice and the screen is nice and bright.2.
B00COYOAYW,0,1,The touch screen is great, the keyboard predictability also great.
B00COYOAYW,0,2,I do like the main screen interface and I do think this would be a good first phone.
B00COYOAYW,0,3,The phone itself is a nice size, a little bigger than what I had before, but not overly big like the more popular phones - it also has a solid build to it but still feels nice and light in your hands.
B00COYOAYW,0,4,* It feels great in the hand - not too big, quite thin and light.
B00COYOAYW,0,5,i had white color and its perfect :)  touch screen works perfectly.
B00COYOAYW,0,6,The only problem i had was having to go from my usual big screen 4.7 screens to an actual 4.0 one.
B00COYOAYW,0,7,touch screen I have ever owned.
B00COYOAYW,0,8,Great, cheap phone.
B00COYOAYW,0,9,This phone is thinner with a bigger screen.
B00COYOAYW,0,10,Not so big that you have to hold it with both hands, and not so small that you feel cheated.
B00COYOAYW,0,11,The screen in sunlight, is not as bright as I'd like.
B00COYOAYW,0,12,Great Phone - Lots of cool features, but touch screen froze fatally after less than a month.
B00COYOAYW,0,13,needs more apps but its a good phone.
B00COYOAYW,0,14,Also powering on the phone takes a while as well to get to the main screen.Other than that the phone is fast and has a really smooth running interface.
B00COYOAYW,0,15,Great phone, if you get a good one.
B00COYOAYW,0,16,As far as quality it feels delicate, not much weight to it how i like it.
B00COYOAYW,0,17,the phone needs more apps but the phone works great, need to get a case cause the phone can get slippery at times but its a very small problem
B00COYOAYW,0,18,* The screen is OK - but not great in sunlight and not the kind of HD resolution we are becoming used to.
B00COYOAYW,0,19,* For a phone with a 4" screen, it is not exactly small.
B00COYOAYW,0,20,Screen is responsive as are the side buttons which feel solid.
B00COYOAYW,0,21,I was lucky enough to nab one of these from big W for $130, which makes it even more of a great deal.
B00COYOAYW,0,22,Don't let the price fool you, this is a great value.
B00COYOAYW,0,23,This is a great phone for seniors or the less technically inept.
B00COYOAYW,0,24,There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time.
B00COYOAYW,1,0,I like the flexibility of the Android phones vs the iPhone but I don't like the Android apps that much.
B00COYOAYW,1,1,no windows phone!
B00COYOAYW,1,2,App store has a bunch of rip-offs and the good apps arent even well made.-
B00COYOAYW,1,3,This is a WINDOWS phone not an Android Phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,4,2)The installed phone apps are much more useful to me then the pre-installed iPhone apps.
B00COYOAYW,1,5,needs more apps but its a good phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,6,Major apps available for Win 8 OS now, secondary apps (eventually).5)
B00COYOAYW,1,7,Windows apps are different from those the Android market.
B00COYOAYW,1,8,This is a Windows 8 phone but it is not like your win 7 desktop.
B00COYOAYW,1,9,I miss the android marketplace, but the features and the 8.1 update more than make up for it.
B00COYOAYW,1,10,Windows is.* Apps?
B00COYOAYW,1,11,Get me back to Android please!
B00COYOAYW,1,12,APP STORE!
B00COYOAYW,1,13,Isnt much you can do with the phone, no really good games, or utility apps you may get out of iOS or Android.
B00COYOAYW,1,14,The phone itself is okay, if it ran android, then it'd be a good phone.
B00COYOAYW,1,15,8) I like the music app much better than the one on the iPhone.
B00COYOAYW,1,16,If only there was a way you could put android on it yourself...wink wink..
B00COYOAYW,1,17,The iPhone has the best app collection out there but it has been around awhile.
B00COYOAYW,1,18,Instagram?...etcIf you mean an "official" app made by the same people who make the app for iOS or Android - maybe yes, maybe no.
B00COYOAYW,1,19,First Downcast is an awesome podcast app, not available on Windows Phone 8  Second mSecure is the password keeper I've been using, not available on Windows 8  Third Toodledo to-do app, not available on Windows 8- Another thing I really miss in Windows Phone 8 is something like "folders" on iOS.
B00COYOAYW,1,20,windows phone - not great.
B00COYOAYW,1,21,The app store is pretty dismal.2.
B00COYOAYW,1,22,Windows Phone 8 OS is easy to learn and operate.3.
B00COYOAYW,1,23,Apps: There are many thousands of Windows Phone 8 applications, but still there are a few that I use regularly that are not available on Windows Phone 8. Alternatives are available but I haven't found any as good as the ones I've been using.
B00COYOAYW,1,24,Even though our house is about 2 miles from their store, the phone doesn't work in our house.
B00COYOAYW,2,0,None of them can be found for under $100 without a 2 year contract.
B00COYOAYW,2,1,6) Price.
B00COYOAYW,2,2,okay for the price.
B00COYOAYW,2,3,nokia 521.
B00COYOAYW,2,4,The price is right.
B00COYOAYW,2,5,Great phone... for its price.
B00COYOAYW,2,6,It is a very good phone for the price.
B00COYOAYW,2,7,Bought 2 of these.
B00COYOAYW,2,8,So I took a risk on the Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,2,9,Affordable, and a good value for this price range overall.8)
B00COYOAYW,2,10,Good phone overall, great price, if Winphone is your thing.
B00COYOAYW,2,11,Don't let the price fool you, this is a great value.
B00COYOAYW,2,12,It's also befuddling that you need to buy a .99
B00COYOAYW,2,13,I used the Mango platform WP 7.5 and decided to try WP 8 and see if the hype is warranted.
B00COYOAYW,2,14,awesome phone for the price - it was on sale for 59.99.
B00COYOAYW,2,15,Bought this for my 13 year old niece.
B00COYOAYW,2,16,That means that whether you pay $100 for the 521 or $700 for the top-of-the-line Lumia 1020, you get the same features in your day-to-day experience.
B00COYOAYW,2,17,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,2,18,And I have only had the 521 for 2 days, and it's getting better.
B00COYOAYW,2,19,good but not really!
B00COYOAYW,2,20,So, if you are looking for the best $100 or less smartphone, get the Nokia Lumia 521, but if you are looking for the best device under $200 I strongly recommend the Moto G.
B00COYOAYW,2,21,My niece wanted a phone for her 13th birthday so I got the Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,2,22,I purchased this phone for my 12 year daughter.
B00COYOAYW,2,23,I just bought this phone 2 months ago.
B00COYOAYW,2,24,for 80 bucks its a good deal.
B00COYOAYW,3,0,Very Poor Battery Life.
B00COYOAYW,3,1,Battery Life.
B00COYOAYW,3,2,Battery life is great.
B00COYOAYW,3,3,You can charge it every day or 1-1/2 days but no more than that.b)
B00COYOAYW,3,4,Battery life to a certain extent is good.
B00COYOAYW,3,5,Good battery life.
B00COYOAYW,3,6,Over the last 4 days, this phone has been restarting itself several times (usually 3 to 7 times) a day.
B00COYOAYW,3,7,One day it will go dead in a few hrs and the next time will last 3 days and I don't use it that much.
B00COYOAYW,3,8,Battery life is great.
B00COYOAYW,3,9,For the first 3 days I had this running, it worked great.
B00COYOAYW,3,10,Slightly above average battery life.7)
B00COYOAYW,3,11,Battery life is good for two solid days -  Though this may be because I stopped using my phone when it stopped informing me of... anything.*
B00COYOAYW,3,12,I powered the phone off (it had about 80% battery charge).
B00COYOAYW,3,13,And I have only had the 521 for 2 days, and it's getting better.
B00COYOAYW,3,14,The battery life is also really nice on this phone.
B00COYOAYW,3,15,As stated above, battery is fairly loose from the battery terminal on the phone, causing it to restart on me several times in a day.
B00COYOAYW,3,16,Now it is turning off halfway through the day after having charged all night the night before.
B00COYOAYW,3,17,Replaceable battery....not too many newer phones has that nowadays.4.
B00COYOAYW,3,18,For the first month I kept it in battery-saving mode and one overnight charge would  last 3 days.
B00COYOAYW,3,19,Great little phone, but battery/phone died after 4 days.
B00COYOAYW,3,20,The first month was great- love the phone.However, after 1 month the phone battery seems to have failed- a charge doesn't even last 1 day - In Battery Saving Mode!
B00COYOAYW,3,21,T-mobile sent me a new battery that didn't help.  1 day lasted 8hrs and I wasn't using it.
B00COYOAYW,3,22,I charge my phone usually every other day.
B00COYOAYW,3,23,Battery life not that great but manageable, maybe i have apps running and dont know it.
B00COYOAYW,3,24,Decent battery life on medium settings5.
B00COYOAYW,4,0,no quality.
B00COYOAYW,4,1,Good sound.
B00COYOAYW,4,2,Call quality was ok but not great, there are much better phones out there.
B00COYOAYW,4,3,The sound and the videos from you tube are loud and clear so if they fix that adobe it will make it a great phone but no adobe not so great.
B00COYOAYW,4,4,If you're in a good reception zone, good call quality.3)
B00COYOAYW,4,5,Great Phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,6,The reviews said they were of good quality , they are very slow and not of quality.
B00COYOAYW,4,7,The phone audio is superior, the speakerphone works very well, it has an FM radio that works great.
B00COYOAYW,4,8,Voice calls are loud and clear.
B00COYOAYW,4,9,Was very surprised how nice this phone is for the price.
B00COYOAYW,4,10,I got this phone refurbished so some of my critiques may be due to extended misuse.Pros:The call quality was really good and exceeded the iphone in many ways.
B00COYOAYW,4,11,My Voice comes out muffled on the recieving endI compared this to the 710 and sound on that phone is much much better.
B00COYOAYW,4,12,Good Applications , Poor Reception.
B00COYOAYW,4,13,The the screen would turn off even when  I am trying to call out and then the power/screen  button is intermitent working 3. the Speaker is really muffled and has a high tone level4.
B00COYOAYW,4,14,I am amazed at how good my music sound when I hook it up to my car stere.
B00COYOAYW,4,15,Build quality on this is cheap.
B00COYOAYW,4,16,Call quality isn't the greatest.
B00COYOAYW,4,17,The speaker is better than my old phone and voice recognition seems to work well.
B00COYOAYW,4,18,Affordable, and a good value for this price range overall.8)
B00COYOAYW,4,19,Great value.
B00COYOAYW,4,20,Great value, great features, needs better software robustness.
B00COYOAYW,4,21,It is a really nice phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,22,Nice phone.
B00COYOAYW,4,23,Good sound quality - decent camera - etc.  Well worth $100.
B00COYOAYW,4,24,The 521 with W8P clearly is the latter.
B00COYOAYW,5,0,The camera is not that good.
B00COYOAYW,5,1,Camera not too great and im use to a front facing camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,2,As for the good, the camera is ....ok.
B00COYOAYW,5,3,this phone executes that really well. it doesn't have a front camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,4,Sweet camera options but the camera is awful.
B00COYOAYW,5,5,I never use the front facing cameras so I don't miss it.
B00COYOAYW,5,6,It doesn't have a front facing camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,7,The camera is adequate in decent light.4.
B00COYOAYW,5,8,Front camera would make it an excellent phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,9,No camera flash.
B00COYOAYW,5,10,There is also no flash on the camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,11,The camera and pictures--I know there is no flash however low light pictures look great for a low end phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,12,A great phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,13,I wish it had a flash and a front facing camera.
B00COYOAYW,5,14,The camera takes decent low light pictures.
B00COYOAYW,5,15,The only redeeming feature is the camera which is excellent.
B00COYOAYW,5,16,Good phone, better than I've expected.
B00COYOAYW,5,17,Rear camera takes *decent* photos (but no flash).6)
B00COYOAYW,5,18,Affordable, and a good value for this price range overall.8)
B00COYOAYW,5,19,Good sound quality - decent camera - etc.  Well worth $100.
B00COYOAYW,5,20,Camera is adequate- nifty camera button on the side, so if you need to activate your camera quickly, you can launch it pretty fast.So those are some of the positives, and the positives are GOOD.
B00COYOAYW,5,21,The only thing I really wish is for a front facing camera and brighter/bolder screen.
B00COYOAYW,5,22,The camera is excellent at this price.
B00COYOAYW,5,23,nice phone.
B00COYOAYW,5,24,Speakerphone is good, works well for when I use it.
B00COYOAYW,6,0,Sim Card is used.
B00COYOAYW,6,1,Nice phone but when I couldn't get the SIM cards to activate with MetroPCS, I took the phones to them.They tried with their SIM cards and couldn't get the phone going.
B00COYOAYW,6,2,Phone didn't work with MetroPCS.
B00COYOAYW,6,3,Unfortunately, Wal-mart wouldn't let me keep the sim card, which contained my phone number that I wanted to keep.
B00COYOAYW,6,4,It took me 5 tries to get the SIM card installed correctly.
B00COYOAYW,6,5,It won't import from the sd card.
B00COYOAYW,6,6,Phone seems good but I called T-Mobile costumer service to activate it and they said the sim card was used.
B00COYOAYW,6,7,Bought 2 of these.
B00COYOAYW,6,8,It requires a micro sim card which it does not state in the description.
B00COYOAYW,6,9,For the first 3 days I had this running, it worked great.
B00COYOAYW,6,10,All I had to do was call T-Mo and the phone number and $80 was transferred over to the 521 and I was good to go.Since the old phone was a back-up phone for my senior husband it was only used for an occasional call or texting ($ .20/.10 each).
B00COYOAYW,6,11,Micro SD card for storage expansion, nice camera and good set of apps from Nokia.
B00COYOAYW,6,12,Could not use my current SIM card in the device because it takes a mini sim and I have a regular size sim card
B00COYOAYW,6,13,This is great for extending storage.8.
B00COYOAYW,6,14,Now Amazon has matched that price which I found amazing but too late.That being said I had checked with T-Mo to make sure I could transfer my old Pay As You Go sim (larger size) with $80 worth of time to the 521 (mini sim).
B00COYOAYW,6,15,Bought two different sim cards through t mobile still didn't work.
B00COYOAYW,6,16,So, I could plan our trip ahead and add locations we wanted to visit, or hotels and didn't have to add them manually on the phone.As a phone, it works great.
B00COYOAYW,6,17,Yes, similarly, you can't readily load the update to the SD card and run it from there.
B00COYOAYW,6,18,There is no 'file manager' to browse the contents of an SD card.
B00COYOAYW,6,19,Good phone, great stand alone media device.
B00COYOAYW,6,20,SD card slot for additional storage....again, not too many newer phones has that.5.
B00COYOAYW,6,21,I can't believe they designed the SIM card keying to be so confusing and ambiguous.I was going to use this phone as my iphone back up or as a smart phone for my dad.
B00COYOAYW,6,22,Buy this phone and a $50 64gb microSD card and you have a full function 64gb media player for $50 less than a 32GB iPod, half the price of a 64gb iPod.
B00COYOAYW,6,23,I have sent files from this phone to an Android tablet and it works good.
B00COYOAYW,6,24,SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,7,0,Nor is it a Samsung.
B00COYOAYW,7,1,I received this phone on time in great condition and loved it.
B00COYOAYW,7,2,You wanna talk about plastic, grab a Samsung galaxy at $600.
B00COYOAYW,7,3,I have now dropped it on the floor or water.
B00COYOAYW,7,4,And here it is, after using iPhone and Samsung galaxy, it surely a compromise, but with this prize, it's awesome deal.
B00COYOAYW,7,5,just received mine yesterday and i cant put it down.
B00COYOAYW,7,6,The only think this had going for it was the price and even then I didn't care for it so I gave it to my grandson.
B00COYOAYW,7,7,But at this price point I can break three of these phones and still be better off than if I'd bought a last-gen Samsung Galaxy.
B00COYOAYW,7,8,It's no iPhone.
B00COYOAYW,7,9,I AM SORRY TO HAVE TO BE SO DOWN ON THIS PHONE BECAUSE IT HAS SOME NICE FEATURES YOU CAN ONLY GET ON PHONES COSTING THREE TIMES AS MUCH.
B00COYOAYW,7,10,I had straight talk with my iphone and that seemed like a better deal, however, slightly slower.
B00COYOAYW,7,11,Trust me, get a case with grip or a so that if u drop it, it wont break.
B00COYOAYW,7,12,My daughter dropped her 520 so I purchased the 521, she wanted a phone that was $200+, get a job.
B00COYOAYW,7,13,I bought this phone as a temporary replacement for my Sony Z1s (I had to send it back to Sony for warranty reasons) and it really has exceeded my expectations for $70.
B00COYOAYW,7,14,If it worked I would have given it a better rating.
B00COYOAYW,7,15,I am not satisfied this time !
B00COYOAYW,7,16,The phone was nice for a little while and even the case I bought with it was nice but less than the month the phone stop turning on.
B00COYOAYW,7,17,i guess it was great for a little while.
B00COYOAYW,7,18,He doesn't care much for it either.
B00COYOAYW,7,19,At first, I was impressed with the features vs price.
B00COYOAYW,7,20,We have since upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy Light, and guess what?
B00COYOAYW,7,21,Bought this phone because my previous phone became my sons play toy.
B00COYOAYW,7,22,Purchased Aug 2013.
B00COYOAYW,7,23,And it works really well at that.
B00COYOAYW,7,24,It works!
B00COYOAYW,8,0,The 521 comes with wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,8,1,Issue 2, also related to wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,8,2,Let me state that I primarily use this phone with the Wi-Fi calling feature, as I do not have cell service at home.
B00COYOAYW,8,3,As t mobile has poor coverage at our home, wifi calling was crucial for this phone to work.
B00COYOAYW,8,4,The phone is great.
B00COYOAYW,8,5,T-mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,8,6,* It does WiFi calling.
B00COYOAYW,8,7,You can also use WiFi calling on the phone.
B00COYOAYW,8,8,I'm keeping the phone but switching service to AT&T.;
B00COYOAYW,8,9,I assume Wi-Fi calls do not.
B00COYOAYW,8,10,GPS doesn't work unless you are T-Mobile customer.
B00COYOAYW,8,11,The so-called wifi calling only gives you the option of making calls over your wifi but does not increase the quality of the call.
B00COYOAYW,8,12,WiFi Calling: This is a great feature that should allow us to make cell phone calls through our home WiFi.
B00COYOAYW,8,13,Also TMobile was if little help.
B00COYOAYW,8,14,Just be aware that T-Mobile service can be excellent in some areas, but somewhat poor in areas where the others are still good.
B00COYOAYW,8,15,You can set it to make only wifi calls or give it a priority.6.
B00COYOAYW,8,16,like the Wi-Fi calling feature I get on T-Mobile because there are a couple places I go regularly where service isn't good but I can still make and take calls over Wi-Fi.
B00COYOAYW,8,17,3) Most of the time I am near a WiFi connection so the Nokia phone makes it very easy to connect to WiFi and use only Wifi unless that is unavailable.
B00COYOAYW,8,18,it only connects to my wifi when it wants to even when all of my other devices are connected to it and working perfectly well.
B00COYOAYW,8,19,If you're in a good reception zone, good call quality.3)
B00COYOAYW,8,20,The T-Mobile service is ok, but it's hard for me to comment because since I've gotten this phone I've mostly been on an island off the coast of NC and there is not good service here anyway.
B00COYOAYW,8,21,Only T-Mobile has this service, and not all TMo phones can do it.
B00COYOAYW,8,22,For the $100 I'll keep it.
B00COYOAYW,8,23,Excellent phone but T-Mobile is horrible.
B00COYOAYW,8,24,Tmobile's Wifi calling is fantastic.
B00COYOAYW,9,0,This is great for extending storage.8.
B00COYOAYW,9,1,It doesnt lag at all and what a relief coming from Android;3.
B00COYOAYW,9,2,Makes the G2 and Nexus 4 sound like toys.2.
B00COYOAYW,9,3,Very impressive.7.
B00COYOAYW,9,4,I though I was upgrading to a better phone, I had a galaxy s android.
B00COYOAYW,9,5,I personally own the surface 1 and beside being slow (compared to my nexus 5) it is pretty nice.
B00COYOAYW,9,6,Nice device, good price.
B00COYOAYW,9,7,This phone to replace an HTC HD7 which had lots of flaky hardware issues.Windows 8 is a good improvement from WP7. Clear smooth and responsive.
B00COYOAYW,9,8,This phone is CHEAP for what you get.  1 Ghz processor with 512 mb ram.
B00COYOAYW,9,9,... it's no S3 er S4 ... but it's still a "good" phone!
B00COYOAYW,9,10,A lousy software design and mediocre hardware.
B00COYOAYW,9,11,A lousy software design and mediocre hardware.
B00COYOAYW,9,12,Would have been better off getting another galaxy s.
B00COYOAYW,9,13,Very little to no lag at all given that it only has 512 mb of ram4.
B00COYOAYW,9,14,This is a nice Windows Phone for a great price.
B00COYOAYW,9,15,Size is nice and the screen is nice and bright.2.
B00COYOAYW,9,16,Also like the unique physical camera button; Overall smooth UI that beats all Android phones I have used so far including the G2, Galaxy S3 and S4.
B00COYOAYW,9,17,good for talking/texting ... not a lot more.
B00COYOAYW,9,18,It has 8 gigs internal memory!So here are the quirks:1.)
B00COYOAYW,9,19,This is one great little phone that actually get things done.
B00COYOAYW,9,20,But it was a free phone so I will keep for 6 months than traded it for an android phone.
B00COYOAYW,9,21,With half the processor of the Android phone it was replacing, it still feels like a hardware upgrade.*
B00COYOAYW,9,22,This version of Pocket Excel was gutted compared to previous versions of Office Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,9,23,But i was using android before this.
B00COYOAYW,9,24,There are two things that must be clarified if you just got this phone and you coming from Android or Iphone.
B00COYOAYW,10,0,Good phone and easy to use.
B00COYOAYW,10,1,She loved it!
B00COYOAYW,10,2,Great features, easy to use...
B00COYOAYW,10,3,I loved my Mac back in the 90's when nobody loved Mac.
B00COYOAYW,10,4,Easy to  use and get to know.
B00COYOAYW,10,5,Great Phone.
B00COYOAYW,10,6,Great value.
B00COYOAYW,10,7,It is easy to use and a great way to get a taste of Windows 8.
B00COYOAYW,10,8,Would not recommend this phone.
B00COYOAYW,10,9,but I love the windows features.
B00COYOAYW,10,10,And you are etuck with the god awful stock keyboard that prevents easy txt editing.-no
B00COYOAYW,10,11,All though it has very good features, It turns itself on and off without even being touched.
B00COYOAYW,10,12,The screen keyboard is cumbersome as with most phones.Unable to use Excel keyboard shortcuts to input time and date because of the keyboard layout.
B00COYOAYW,10,13,I would recommend this phone to someone that wants a easy phone to operate and understand
B00COYOAYW,10,14,Loved it at first.
B00COYOAYW,10,15,I switched from my blackberry to this and I have to say, personally, I love the QWERTY keyboard better than the touchscreen on this phone.
B00COYOAYW,10,16,Win 8 OS is fairly easy to figure out, and online tutorials are easy to find.4)
B00COYOAYW,10,17,I so wanted to love Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,10,18,She loved it and continues to thank me for her birthday gift.
B00COYOAYW,10,19,Easy to use Windows Phone interface.
B00COYOAYW,10,20,Size is nice and the screen is nice and bright.2.
B00COYOAYW,10,21,Good overall phone, but not good reception at my home compared to Galaxy S. Bought this phone for my wife for a Christmas present, overall easy to use and has some good functionality.
B00COYOAYW,10,22,Easy to use the interface for those new to windows like myself3.
B00COYOAYW,10,23,The touch screen is great, the keyboard predictability also great.
B00COYOAYW,10,24,4) Navigation on the phone is super easy.
B00COYOAYW,11,0,I gave the wrong review on the illumishield plastic covers.
B00COYOAYW,11,1,Plus it does not let you change the background color.
B00COYOAYW,11,2,This is a good set.
B00COYOAYW,11,3,Everything about that aspect if very inconvenient and not user friendly.
B00COYOAYW,11,4,Thought I was reviewing the phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,5,You can change the box colors, but my husband wanted wallpapers, which it does not do.
B00COYOAYW,11,6,I've never written a review until now....
B00COYOAYW,11,7,Not good.
B00COYOAYW,11,8,The GPS on this phone also locks onto satellites very quickly.2)
B00COYOAYW,11,9,What makes it weird is that I haven't changed providers, only phones.
B00COYOAYW,11,10,The phone is locked.
B00COYOAYW,11,11,Screen/phone good size for "pocketability" - not too huge.Con List:1)  The power/standby button is VERY poorly placed about halfway down the right side of the phone - where you want to grip it, causing fairly frequent accidental pushes and therefore causing you to have to push the button again to come back out of standby mode.2)  No front facing camera (sorry, no Skype video calls).3)
B00COYOAYW,11,12,Very light easy to carry.
B00COYOAYW,11,13,Some function is not very good, and the bottom is not very connect to the phone.
B00COYOAYW,11,14,Always powers off!! The phone came on time & was packaged nice and that's the only reason for the 2 stars but the phone powers off by itself a lot.
B00COYOAYW,11,15,I cant get over how crappy this phone is, and dont understand how this can get so many positive reviews.
B00COYOAYW,11,16,I would NOT recommend getting this phone if you need it for GPS.
B00COYOAYW,11,17,Awesome, I was a Samsung (original Samsung Galazy S) user, this phone was a major step up in all respects except for the camera.
B00COYOAYW,11,18,I got this mainly for the GPS after reading the reviews here.
B00COYOAYW,11,19,Great features, easy to use...
B00COYOAYW,11,20,Several reviewers have noted this same phenomenon.
B00COYOAYW,11,21,90% of the time when it comes back on it's in airplane mode.
B00COYOAYW,11,22,You can chose the color scheme and design the pins to fit your needs.
B00COYOAYW,11,23,We are happy.. Thanks.
B00COYOAYW,11,24,Dont reward them for the poor design and functionality.
B00COYOAYW,12,0,I used both phones with the same T-Mobile 1500 min of voice and text plus 30 megs of data.
B00COYOAYW,12,1,Value for money.
B00COYOAYW,12,2,For the $100 I'll keep it.
B00COYOAYW,12,3,The use of data over Wi-Fi does count against my data limit.
B00COYOAYW,12,4,There is another for Limited Wi-Fi Connectivity and another for Data Roaming.WiFi works for me.
B00COYOAYW,12,5,If you make good use of them you can get by with the 30 meg limit on the prepay plans.
B00COYOAYW,12,6,It tries to send text and email messages ONCE and that's it.
B00COYOAYW,12,7,I'm going for the #30/mo no contract with 100 voice and unlimited data and text.-
B00COYOAYW,12,8,This is a Windows 8 phone but it is not like your win 7 desktop.
B00COYOAYW,12,9,For the moment we decided to go with the $30/mo T-Mobile prepaid plan from Wal-Mart that comes with 100 min of talk, unlimited text, and 5 GB of data per month.
B00COYOAYW,12,10,Switched my T-Mobile 3-line family plan to their new plan and pay 60% less per month even after an adding a 4th line.
B00COYOAYW,12,11,The T-Mobile Lumia 521 is useful as a secondary phone to throw around the family.
B00COYOAYW,12,12,Truly what I wished for was to be able to use a smartphone on the Verizon network but only use WiFi for data and not pay for a data plan.
B00COYOAYW,12,13,The 521 comes with wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,12,14,Limited functionality - doesn't even seem to have the handy "swipe" feature for writing emails and texts.
B00COYOAYW,12,15,Good phone if you just talk and text.
B00COYOAYW,12,16,I hate this phone with a passion..the wifi calling don't work ever unless you pay for something for it to work ever month..picture aren't great..I wish I never got it
B00COYOAYW,12,17,A great phone for talk & text & music, but not much else.
B00COYOAYW,12,18,In the setting for the Lumia under Celluar is a setting for Data Connection.
B00COYOAYW,12,19,If the T-Mobile plan work well the three members of my family that have phones will switch to this plan which means we will be paying the same monthly amount but now will have unlimited data and text too.
B00COYOAYW,12,20,Music playback quality, however, is good (8/29 - I'm getting used to it).I didn't pay for a data plan upgrade, so I'm limited to 500MB of unthrottled access.
B00COYOAYW,12,21,During the day I usually use 1 hr of streaming video and 1 hr of audio plus checking email and Facebook throughout the day.5.
B00COYOAYW,12,22,The Lumia has data use controls that limit the data use.
B00COYOAYW,12,23,There is no way to talk on the phone and check my email at the same time.
B00COYOAYW,12,24,This only affects voice service, data still functions perfectly, leaving me to think its not a service issue.also, the voice to text feature requires network access to work.
B00COYOAYW,13,0,The only problem i had was having to go from my usual big screen 4.7 screens to an actual 4.0 one.
B00COYOAYW,13,1,Phone case.
B00COYOAYW,13,2,wrong screen protector.
B00COYOAYW,13,3,Size: As I've been using the 4" iPod Touch 5 for about a year using the 521 4" display seems quite natural.
B00COYOAYW,13,4,7) very snappy performanceCons: 1) Screen resolution isn't bad but could be better.
B00COYOAYW,13,5,Because the case didn't fit my phone.
B00COYOAYW,13,6,The screen is super sens, so much that you can hover your finger over the screen.
B00COYOAYW,13,7,The 521 display touch screen is also very easy to use as it is quite sensitive.-
B00COYOAYW,13,8,Home screen is very customizable.-
B00COYOAYW,13,9,The Lumia is the first touch screen phone I have used.
B00COYOAYW,13,10,Nice case...fit correctly on my nokia lumina 521however the screen protector was for model nokia 520and did not fit my 521
B00COYOAYW,13,11,Nokia or the windowsphone store looking for these accessories such as the screen protectors and cases.
B00COYOAYW,13,12,The screen is fine, but not the newer super duper never break never get fingerprint screens.
B00COYOAYW,13,13,I'm not sure why because I have a nokia lumia 521 and that what kind of case it was but didn't fit.
B00COYOAYW,13,14,It would be better to have them displayed all the time.8)
B00COYOAYW,13,15,The screen in sunlight, is not as bright as I'd like.
B00COYOAYW,13,16,Auto rotation of the screen cannot be removed/stopped.
B00COYOAYW,13,17,There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time.
B00COYOAYW,13,18,Display: While the pixel count (800 x 480) is well below my iPod Touch 5th Gen the quality is so close I think the 521 may sometimes be better then the iPod.
B00COYOAYW,13,19,(I suggest to buy a cover, I am 5'3 female weight: 115 lbs.
B00COYOAYW,13,20,3) Phone case is a bit plasticy.
B00COYOAYW,13,21,When I just want to get to the home screen, it'll reboot.
B00COYOAYW,13,22,Size is nice and the screen is nice and bright.2.
B00COYOAYW,13,23,Got to find a better case for it though.
B00COYOAYW,13,24,First, there're bubbles and lines under the screen film.
B00COYOAYW,14,0,Lack of apps, doesn't have my bank app yet, I use this app all the time2.
B00COYOAYW,14,1,Went from an android phone to a windows so some of you can imagine.
B00COYOAYW,14,2,If I buy an app in Windows 8, I have to buy the same app again in WP8.
B00COYOAYW,14,3,Really dissapointting, like Windows 8.
B00COYOAYW,14,4,Some key apps I would like to have are only on the iPhone and Android.-
B00COYOAYW,14,5,Windows Phone!
B00COYOAYW,14,6,If you're looking to use Windows 8 primarily this is the phone for you.
B00COYOAYW,14,7,The weakest link = Windows 8.
B00COYOAYW,14,8,Companies make apps for iphones and androids and few make them for windows phones.3.)
B00COYOAYW,14,9,That means no Instagram, Vine, Snapchat, etc. (Yes, there are copy cat apps for it, but it just isn't the same.)I
B00COYOAYW,14,10,For now, quite a few of the iphone apps I used do not have a windows version yet.
B00COYOAYW,14,11,Windows apps are different from those the Android market.
B00COYOAYW,14,12,The apps are limited.
B00COYOAYW,14,13,No cohesion between WP's app store and the Win8 store.
B00COYOAYW,14,14,No sharing of data between apps.
B00COYOAYW,14,15,Another downside is that the Windows Store for app, games, etc. is SO very limited.
B00COYOAYW,14,16,Windows is.* Apps?
B00COYOAYW,14,17,Instagram?...etcIf you mean an "official" app made by the same people who make the app for iOS or Android - maybe yes, maybe no.
B00COYOAYW,14,18,I still use my previous Android if I need to use those power apps, but this phone is my everyday workhorse.
B00COYOAYW,14,19,The unifying visual themes are forced throughout each and every app, which means the dysfunction of windows 8 can now be had in every endeavor.-the
B00COYOAYW,14,20,A lot of apps that are on the android market, and apple store are not available for Microsoft phones.
B00COYOAYW,14,21,Because of this, I downloaded the MapQuest app which seems to work much better.
B00COYOAYW,14,22,The number of apps available for Windows phones is abysmal.
B00COYOAYW,14,23,The ability to make apps on this phone has been CRIPPLED with the version 8 update.
B00COYOAYW,14,24,Starting an app from its tile also seems to give the same random results if the app is already running.9)
B00COYOAYW,15,0,$79 is too much.
B00COYOAYW,15,1,I've had this phone for about 3 months now and look forward to replacing it.
B00COYOAYW,15,2,Great if you can't afford anything over $250.
B00COYOAYW,15,3,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,4,pricing.
B00COYOAYW,15,5,Replaced after 3 months.
B00COYOAYW,15,6,Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,7,So, if you are looking for the best $100 or less smartphone, get the Nokia Lumia 521, but if you are looking for the best device under $200 I strongly recommend the Moto G.
B00COYOAYW,15,8,i dont recommend to anyone to buy stuf from them
B00COYOAYW,15,9,Should have never purchased this phone.
B00COYOAYW,15,10,I wasted $50 for a month and hardly got to use it.
B00COYOAYW,15,11,Just a great phone for a great price, or so I thought.It began to act glitchy the first month.
B00COYOAYW,15,12,I had a Nokia Lumia 710 which I gave to my husband.
B00COYOAYW,15,13,I bought this phone because I had previously liked other Nokia phones I had purchased.
B00COYOAYW,15,14,And my last phone was the Samsung Infuse (priced at 6 TIMES this Nokia 521).
B00COYOAYW,15,15,Defective Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,15,16,Never buying a Nokia again.
B00COYOAYW,15,17,I should 've bought it there: less stress and efforts...
B00COYOAYW,15,18,I'm going back with my VERIZON Nokia Lumia 821.
B00COYOAYW,15,19,So never buying phone this one or other from amazon.
B00COYOAYW,15,20,Great price too!
B00COYOAYW,15,21,I will never buy another Nokia product again.
B00COYOAYW,15,22,I've had this phone for roughly 2 months now.
B00COYOAYW,15,23,bought the phone at target and with tmboile 50$ plan.
B00COYOAYW,15,24,I tried to return it to Amazon but they said I had missed the return date and would not take it back, so much for Amazon's return policy.
B00COYOAYW,16,0,The battery is just over 1/2 charged now.-
B00COYOAYW,16,1,Not sure what is the cause but the battery is not large enough to reach the 3 pins in the phone.
B00COYOAYW,16,2,Showed the charging icon but battery wouldn't charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,3,now the phone wont turn on at all but it shows that the battery is charging.
B00COYOAYW,16,4,Drains the battery within 4 hours.
B00COYOAYW,16,5,I powered the phone off (it had about 80% battery charge).
B00COYOAYW,16,6,Looks like a defective battery or the phone just doesn't really last more than 5 hours.
B00COYOAYW,16,7,Charges for 48 hours and the charge lasts 4 or 5 (not calls, no data on).
B00COYOAYW,16,8,Even when the phone did work the battery life was terrible.
B00COYOAYW,16,9,(The 721 was back before we were, no charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,10,The charging ion would come up when I would charge but it just wouldn't power up.
B00COYOAYW,16,11,So it blinks (charging) all never charges.
B00COYOAYW,16,12,Swapped the battery for another one.. same issue.
B00COYOAYW,16,13,The battery life.
B00COYOAYW,16,14,The battery is made in Finland, but needs to be sent to Asia before it can be shipped to the U.S. and they just don't have the battery.
B00COYOAYW,16,15,Phone won't turn on after 4 days.
B00COYOAYW,16,16,I tried everything, if i plug it in (tried for about 17hr charge) it will not keep the charge.
B00COYOAYW,16,17,It wasn't until a few days later that my phone started turning off on it's own even though the battery was fully charged.
B00COYOAYW,16,18,After I press the power button to have it "sleep", sometimes (not that often, but "often" enough), (1) with full charge, after 12hr of 0 usage - battery is 0 (2) with 40% battery left, after 2hr, battery is 0.  People may argue "you have things running in background".
B00COYOAYW,16,19,Awful device - Unusable after 2 days.
B00COYOAYW,16,20,Also the battery life on my two years old 710 is still better than the battery life on my brand new 521.
B00COYOAYW,16,21,Good battery life.
B00COYOAYW,16,22,Battery Troubles.
B00COYOAYW,16,23,I assumed the battery had just died, so I left it alone for 6 hours while I finished my shift.
B00COYOAYW,16,24,Tried using a battery from an ATT 520 and that does not work either.
B00COYOAYW,17,0,He would go to call someone and the phone would just not do the call.
B00COYOAYW,17,1,Calls drop sporadically.
B00COYOAYW,17,2,My calls drop and my bluetooth keeps getting disconnected.
B00COYOAYW,17,3,Call quality isn't the greatest.
B00COYOAYW,17,4,When on speaker it's not clear at all.
B00COYOAYW,17,5,Putting the phone on speaker reduces the frequency of this bug, but I cannot be on speaker constantly just because this device/software glitches.
B00COYOAYW,17,6,Takes forever for the calls to go through......that's IF they go through.
B00COYOAYW,17,7,I have a Bluetooth phone in the house and my car has Bluetooth but unfortunately it won't switch when you get in the car like my previous phone.
B00COYOAYW,17,8,Sometimes I have to enter a PIN, sometimes I have to tap on it, sometimes a call will come in and I can hear them over Bluetooth but they can't hear me -- so annoying!
B00COYOAYW,17,9,have had this phone since November and the audio or speakers are horrible.
B00COYOAYW,17,10,Always getting cut off....dropping calls.
B00COYOAYW,17,11,I've tried with turning off the screen while on the call - the same issue.
B00COYOAYW,17,12,I want my ringer volume loud and my multimedia volume low.
B00COYOAYW,17,13,Under normal use, my headphone jack got "loose" after about 2 months, causing the audio to cut in and out whenever the cord brushed up against something.
B00COYOAYW,17,14,He would have to take his battery out and put it back in in order for it  to make calls.Overall very disappointing.
B00COYOAYW,17,15,The speaker is also loud as others have mentioned.
B00COYOAYW,17,16,You don't get any cool pre-installed ring tones, but at least the speaker and the audio volume will be loud.
B00COYOAYW,17,17,Unfortunately, It has bad reception (unless it has to do with T-Mobile) and when on speaker there is a lot of interruption.
B00COYOAYW,17,18,Phone speaker defect.
B00COYOAYW,17,19,headphone jack doesnt always cut out the speaker.
B00COYOAYW,17,20,Frequent dropped calls, poor call quality, etc.
B00COYOAYW,17,21,Piece of junk no
B00COYOAYW,17,22,It can happen in middle of a call or when it's just sitting around.
B00COYOAYW,17,23,Others sometimes have a hard time hearing me.
B00COYOAYW,17,24,The the screen would turn off even when  I am trying to call out and then the power/screen  button is intermitent working 3. the Speaker is really muffled and has a high tone level4.
B00COYOAYW,18,0,good.
B00COYOAYW,18,1,Overall ,good phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,2,The keypad is good! as good as my 4th gen ipod!
B00COYOAYW,18,3,This phone is a good value on the surface.
B00COYOAYW,18,4,Camera is too bad.
B00COYOAYW,18,5,The camera doesn't even have a flash.
B00COYOAYW,18,6,The camera is not that good.
B00COYOAYW,18,7,A 5 star value.
B00COYOAYW,18,8,Good Phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,9,Nokia 521.
B00COYOAYW,18,10,3.5 stars.
B00COYOAYW,18,11,The features look good.
B00COYOAYW,18,12,UPDATE 1/1/14: Pictures taken outdoors in good light are actually pretty good.
B00COYOAYW,18,13,If it wasn't for the predictable disconnection, I would give it 5 stars.
B00COYOAYW,18,14,This phone is pretty good.
B00COYOAYW,18,15,The problem with the camera is it needs good lighting or any movement of the subject or camera causes terrible blur.
B00COYOAYW,18,16,Txting is good.
B00COYOAYW,18,17,No Good Nokia!
B00COYOAYW,18,18,Its is good and cheapest smartphone.
B00COYOAYW,18,19,Affordable, and a good value for this price range overall.8)
B00COYOAYW,18,20,If you compare 5 MP from apple and 5 MP from nokia, you will see the difference.
B00COYOAYW,18,21,The camera is really solid, seems to let in a lot of light although it has no flash.
B00COYOAYW,18,22,not for me, but there are some good thing about this phone.
B00COYOAYW,18,23,This is a good basic smartphone with only one camera, rear-facing, and no flash.
B00COYOAYW,18,24,good quality smartphone.
B00COYOAYW,19,0,SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,1,We just swapped out the SIM card.
B00COYOAYW,19,2,just because they claim I didn't include a sim card that came with the phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,3,Sim Card Sucks.
B00COYOAYW,19,4,No memory.
B00COYOAYW,19,5,It has 8 gigs internal memory!So here are the quirks:1.)
B00COYOAYW,19,6,i would have kept it if my sim card was compatible...
B00COYOAYW,19,7,They mentioned that they don't cut sim cards, but they could transfer my information to a micro sim card.
B00COYOAYW,19,8,If you have music to upload using an SD card, I suggest you skip Windows Phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,9,SD card slot for additional storage....again, not too many newer phones has that.5.
B00COYOAYW,19,10,Could not use my current SIM card in the device because it takes a mini sim and I have a regular size sim card
B00COYOAYW,19,11,I am very disappointed with this purchase and found that the sim card was already used.
B00COYOAYW,19,12,We ahd to purchase another sim card from T Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,19,13,Your music is replicated over 6 times on your memory card for no stupid reason, and there is no fix for it.
B00COYOAYW,19,14,When I received the phone and put in my daughters' old sim cards in the both phones I am getting the error message "This sim card can only be used on specific networks.
B00COYOAYW,19,15,I had to drop it down from 4 stars to 3. HOWEVER, uploading music after installing SD card is MADNESS!
B00COYOAYW,19,16,You can store music on the phone SD card, or in "the cloud" on SkyDrive.
B00COYOAYW,19,17,The sim card that came with this new phone could not load my old account onto it when I got the new phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,18,Well how come it is not working?I put the SIM card in, turn it on and the Maps app is empty.
B00COYOAYW,19,19,It's internal memory is enough for all the apps I use and more.
B00COYOAYW,19,20,I did not get the chance to use it because I have a standard sim card and this one uses a mini sim.
B00COYOAYW,19,21,It will save it to phone memory and there is no way to transfer it to the sd card!So, I just listed the bad things so you'll know, but the truth is I really like this phone.
B00COYOAYW,19,22,Bought two different sim cards through t mobile still didn't work.
B00COYOAYW,19,23,When I check the phones memory, it says that most of the phone memory is taken up by "other"You can save photos, videos, and songs on the sd card.
B00COYOAYW,19,24,Also be aware that the phone use the mini SIM card so I can transfer my current SIM over.Wasted my $$ for nothing on this unit!
B00COYOAYW,20,0,They hung up 3 times.
B00COYOAYW,20,1,My daughter dropped her 520 so I purchased the 521, she wanted a phone that was $200+, get a job.
B00COYOAYW,20,2,The phone stopped working less than 2 weeks after I received it.
B00COYOAYW,20,3,And I don't think there is any warranty after 30 days.
B00COYOAYW,20,4,Replaced after 3 months.
B00COYOAYW,20,5,I've had this phone for roughly 2 months now.
B00COYOAYW,20,6,Had it 6 months and it started turning itself off all the time.
B00COYOAYW,20,7,My phone broken after used for 6 months
B00COYOAYW,20,8,It's broken after I used for 6 months.
B00COYOAYW,20,9,I ordered 2 of these phones and so far the other phone is working just fine.
B00COYOAYW,20,10,stop working within a month.
B00COYOAYW,20,11,It did come in a timely manner.
B00COYOAYW,20,12,There is no warranty for this item.
B00COYOAYW,20,13,from time to time getting stuck, .Have to turn it off to get it back.
B00COYOAYW,20,14,When asked to return or try and replace it I was told no and it was one day after the 30 day warranty this happened.
B00COYOAYW,20,15,Many functions on the phone do not work.
B00COYOAYW,20,16,It took them a whole 6 days after I ordered to even ship the item.
B00COYOAYW,20,17,2nd replacement still not working.
B00COYOAYW,20,18,UPDATE 1/1/14: Maintaining the WiFi connection hasn't been a problem with the replacement phone.I may have received a defective one.
B00COYOAYW,20,19,Plus all the covers we ordered for it didn't for right
B00COYOAYW,20,20,Had problems straight out of box....had to end up paying $20 tot mobile to replace the phone.
B00COYOAYW,20,21,One day it will go dead in a few hrs and the next time will last 3 days and I don't use it that much.
B00COYOAYW,20,22,Ordered two and neither of them worked.
B00COYOAYW,20,23,It turns out there is a problem with the phone.I went to T-Mobile in February and they took $20 from me and arranged to have a new phone sent to me.
B00COYOAYW,20,24,When I started the phone up, it froze on me within 5 minutes.
B00COYOAYW,21,0,phone not unlocked.
B00COYOAYW,21,1,Contact your customer service center for the unlock code.
B00COYOAYW,21,2,It was not the phone, it was the service provider.
B00COYOAYW,21,3,Not sure if it's T-Mobile or Nokia phone...service has become LOUSY!
B00COYOAYW,21,4,I contacted Nokia customer service.
B00COYOAYW,21,5,As much as I dislike the (apparently unfixable) problems with T-mobile's service, I hate T-mobile's attitude about it even more.
B00COYOAYW,21,6,Not sure if it's the device or T-Mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,21,7,The phones are not unlocked -  Spoilt my daughters' Christmas.
B00COYOAYW,21,8,This is the worst customer service I have ever had regrading a cell phone.
B00COYOAYW,21,9,He would go to call someone and the phone would just not do the call.
B00COYOAYW,21,10,No service even though it showed service in my area online at T-Mobile.
B00COYOAYW,21,11,**BUYER BEWARE**  THIS PHONE CANNOT BE UNLOCKED FOR USE OUTSIDE T-MOBILE BY WAY OF PURCHASING A CODE. THIS PHONE CAN ONLY BE UNLOCKED BY T-MOBILE AND IT'S AT THEIR SOLE DISCRETION WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL ACTUALLY GO AHEAD AND UNLOCK IT FOR YOU.
B00COYOAYW,21,12,Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.
B00COYOAYW,21,13,Wish it worked!
B00COYOAYW,21,14,It turns out there is a problem with the phone.I went to T-Mobile in February and they took $20 from me and arranged to have a new phone sent to me.
B00COYOAYW,21,15,required phone services to work.
B00COYOAYW,21,16,Is that too much to ask? Come on lucky number 4...
B00COYOAYW,21,17,Nothing has worked.
B00COYOAYW,21,18,Still, no battery.April 11, 2014 I called Nokia customer care.
B00COYOAYW,21,19,I have made literally dozens of calls trying to find someone at T-mobile who would help me, with no success at all.
B00COYOAYW,21,20,Tmobile told me it was previously reported stolen.
B00COYOAYW,21,21,You can unlock it using [...] it takes about 15 working days to get the code.
B00COYOAYW,21,22,unlock code.
B00COYOAYW,21,23,I specifically chose unlocked cell phone cause i live in Trinidad and as such my daughters will be using a Trinidad cellular service provider.
B00COYOAYW,21,24,Getting them to turn the service back on is a nightmare.
B00COYOAYW,22,0,This phone is CHEAP for what you get.  1 Ghz processor with 512 mb ram.
B00COYOAYW,22,1,It has 8 gigs internal memory!So here are the quirks:1.)
B00COYOAYW,22,2,just thought i'd throw that out though)5.
B00COYOAYW,22,3,My niece wanted a phone for her 13th birthday so I got the Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,22,4,Tried using a battery from an ATT 520 and that does not work either.
B00COYOAYW,22,5,If you're going to spend $30-60 a month on the service, spending $100 or less on the phone seems penny wise and pound foolish.
B00COYOAYW,22,6,If you compare 5 MP from apple and 5 MP from nokia, you will see the difference.
B00COYOAYW,22,7,6) Price.
B00COYOAYW,22,8,Bought this for my 13 year old niece.
B00COYOAYW,22,9,Startup time is less than 30 seconds.
B00COYOAYW,22,10,The only problem i had was having to go from my usual big screen 4.7 screens to an actual 4.0 one.
B00COYOAYW,22,11,So the three phones I was most seriously considering: Google Nexus 4, LG Optimus L9 and Nokia Lumia 521.
B00COYOAYW,22,12,Size: As I've been using the 4" iPod Touch 5 for about a year using the 521 4" display seems quite natural.
B00COYOAYW,22,13,I spent $69.95 at BestBuy and that seemed like the least expensive way to get WP8 hardware.
B00COYOAYW,22,14,That may be due to the 1GHz dual core processor, but it may also be due to not having dual band WiFi so I couldn't hook it up to my 5GHz WiFi router which is much faster than the 2.4GHz band.-
B00COYOAYW,22,15,And my last phone was the Samsung Infuse (priced at 6 TIMES this Nokia 521).
B00COYOAYW,22,16,Supposedly a future release of WP will have this fixed with a "notification center", but for now it is poorly implemented.13)
B00COYOAYW,22,17,I don't want to see it flicking and flashing at me all the time.12)
B00COYOAYW,22,18,All in all a really terrible and disappointing experience.
B00COYOAYW,22,19,I personally own the surface 1 and beside being slow (compared to my nexus 5) it is pretty nice.
B00COYOAYW,22,20,Major apps available for Win 8 OS now, secondary apps (eventually).5)
B00COYOAYW,22,21,I didn't know that until I was reading Help+Tips on the 521 and it was mentioned.
B00COYOAYW,22,22,I bought this 521 as an experiment to try out the T-Mobile service.
B00COYOAYW,22,23,I havnt been able to use it and I need to upgrade soon.it
B00COYOAYW,22,24,I bought it only for temporary (about 4-5 months) while I am waiting for iPhone release.
B00COYOAYW,23,0,Easy to use phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,1,but i read reviews before buying it and i did not read any type saying that they had the type of problems I'm having.
B00COYOAYW,23,2,hate to imaging a fat fingered person typing on this thing.
B00COYOAYW,23,3,*DON'T BUY** Piece of crap didn't work out of box.
B00COYOAYW,23,4,Bad Luck????
B00COYOAYW,23,5,I haven't heard on any bad things with this phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,6,then the exact same thing happend.
B00COYOAYW,23,7,Unfortunately I was at work and got up to wait on a customer and when I returned the screen was lit but not on.
B00COYOAYW,23,8,*fingers crossed*
B00COYOAYW,23,9,This might be an isolated issue and my bad luck.
B00COYOAYW,23,10,As my needs are different, I opted to return it and orderanother type of phone more suitable for my personal needs.
B00COYOAYW,23,11,Wrong.When I got south of the Equator, things went haywire.
B00COYOAYW,23,12,The interface is easy to use and only takes a few minutes to figure out how to find things and customize the display.
B00COYOAYW,23,13,The manual instruction does not give good explanation on how use different things on the phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,14,My biggest complaint is that the screen is impossible to see when one is outside.
B00COYOAYW,23,15,The interface is intuitive - the tiles afford no explanation to figure out what each one does.
B00COYOAYW,23,16,Nokia's are known as global phones, so I figured I'd have no problem using this phone abroad.
B00COYOAYW,23,17,I also can't get apps to most the places I shop, so no coupons with just a couple of swips of a finger.
B00COYOAYW,23,18,Size: As I've been using the 4" iPod Touch 5 for about a year using the 521 4" display seems quite natural.
B00COYOAYW,23,19,Absolute piece of junk.
B00COYOAYW,23,20,The only problem i had was having to go from my usual big screen 4.7 screens to an actual 4.0 one.
B00COYOAYW,23,21,Sturdy construction; this phone should last you for a while.THE BAD:* Apps.
B00COYOAYW,23,22,Unlike Apple products, the virtual keyboard makes it clear when a letter is capitalized.Cons- Nowadays this phone is relatively mediocre- Call quality is ok- Touchscreen is somewhat touchy and the virtual keyboard can be difficult to use- The Wifi calling feature almost never works, and when it's on it interferes with texting- The biggest problem with it is that it's a Windows phone.
B00COYOAYW,23,23,Very disappointed about that, but there is an amazon shopping app and the kindle app also works on this phone so that's indicating to me that soon I will be able to use the amazon cloud player as well.So speaking of the app store you have to fish around in there, the search is not always intuitive so you have to figure out the right keyword to locate things.
B00COYOAYW,23,24,If you're looking to use Windows 8 primarily this is the phone for you.
B00COYOAYW,24,0,After i press the power button, it shows "goodbye", then screen turn black.
B00COYOAYW,24,1,The power button is accidently pressed all the time.
B00COYOAYW,24,2,The problem is the buttons on the side of the phone are right there where I grab it, and I had accidently lowered the ring volume to zero.
B00COYOAYW,24,3,I hit the power button on the side, and I got the screen that said slide down to power off - hurray for physical buttons - but touching the screen still produced no results.
B00COYOAYW,24,4,And a few times, the touch screen has become unresponsive.
B00COYOAYW,24,5,Power button: It's on the side.
B00COYOAYW,24,6,First, there're bubbles and lines under the screen film.
B00COYOAYW,24,7,volume buttons suck.
B00COYOAYW,24,8,The delete call option is actually easier and quicker to use than the options menu and buttons on the X2.
B00COYOAYW,24,9,watch the buttons on the side.
B00COYOAYW,24,10,No track scrubbing...have to old fashion hold the button to rewind3.
B00COYOAYW,24,11,Tried all button combinations to force a reset and nothing works.
B00COYOAYW,24,12,I've tried with turning off the screen while on the call - the same issue.
B00COYOAYW,24,13,No silence button so you have to go through the settings function to silence and unsilence the ringer.
B00COYOAYW,24,14,I click the power button to go to the lock screen again, and it works, but the fact that the touch screen sometimes doesn't register my fingers is kind of iffy.
B00COYOAYW,24,15,I find it easiest to do by releasing the side opposite the power button first.
B00COYOAYW,24,16,The phone side buttons and touch "buttons" are not clearly marked / lit.
B00COYOAYW,24,17,I gave this phone to my mom and she had lots of problems with her cheek pushing the hold/mute buttons during a call.
B00COYOAYW,24,18,I had placed a call that went to the recipient's voicemail, but when I tried to hang up, tapping 'end call,' or the home and back buttons didn't do anything.
B00COYOAYW,24,19,I like having the "back" button below the screen as it's always easy to find.
B00COYOAYW,24,20,The buttons are placed right where you would hold the phone, so that's one adjustment.
B00COYOAYW,24,21,Just flicking the screen sometmes will take you to a fb page that you havent seen before!
B00COYOAYW,24,22,I like to keep missed calls and some special calls listed in the call history so "delete all" is not an option for me.
B00COYOAYW,24,23,The volume shows a number from 0 to 30 in the upper left corner of the screen as you adjust the volume.-
B00COYOAYW,24,24,I tried to reset it (hold down volume down/power for 10s) did nothing.
B00COYOAYW,25,0,I use my phone, well, to make phone call and send text messages.
B00COYOAYW,25,1,It tries to send text and email messages ONCE and that's it.
B00COYOAYW,25,2,The phone is just used to call and text.
B00COYOAYW,25,3,wifi calling keeps taking over at home and prevents multimedia messaging.other
B00COYOAYW,25,4,can't get on internet,can't access facebook,can't send pictures just not satified with it.
B00COYOAYW,25,5,It ok if you don't like picture messages.
B00COYOAYW,25,6,Forget about getting a email or a text written quick because your gonna need to go back and correct the spelling of every other  word.
B00COYOAYW,25,7,Phone calls are clear and the phone also comes with Wi-Fi calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,8,So, wherever there is no wifi, I can only talk and text.
B00COYOAYW,25,9,Giant, space-hogging tiles that don't do anything – The email tile shows ONE unread email.
B00COYOAYW,25,10,The 521 comes with wifi calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,11,I confirmed wifi calling, it worked flawlessly.
B00COYOAYW,25,12,The calls are not clear and it makes horrible sound sometimes, can not record with the camera, can not resend the text messages, have to retype them, text messages do not go through every time so you have to re send and re type them.
B00COYOAYW,25,13,Most of the time when I receive calls I never even get them mainly because the phone has turned off.
B00COYOAYW,25,14,I got it for $60 and it is very responsive for email and surfing and texting.
B00COYOAYW,25,15,As I am not a gamer, I only use the phone for phone calls, text messaging, checking emails and browsing the web while not near my PC, and taking casual photos while my camera is not around.
B00COYOAYW,25,16,Same with text (unless you use say the Facebook messaging app).
B00COYOAYW,25,17,I had to send it back but I assume that will go just as well as I received it!
B00COYOAYW,25,18,Normally, it would start and powerout itself in the middle of text or phone call.
B00COYOAYW,25,19,I do not have any access to the internet, I cannot download any apps.
B00COYOAYW,25,20,Prepaid plan, no data, with wifi.
B00COYOAYW,25,21,* It does WiFi calling.
B00COYOAYW,25,22,EDIT: When wifi calling is enabled, you cannot receive MMS (multi-media messages).
B00COYOAYW,25,23,Wifi calling was a nightmare--sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.
B00COYOAYW,25,24,The so-called wifi calling only gives you the option of making calls over your wifi but does not increase the quality of the call.
B008HTJLF6,0,0,I love the large screen!
B008HTJLF6,0,1,It's quick, responsive and the graphics are great.
B008HTJLF6,0,2,Great display.
B008HTJLF6,0,3,If you're looking for a good phone with a decent screen size i would recommend the s3.
B008HTJLF6,0,4,Great phone!
B008HTJLF6,0,5,Some say it feels cheap, but I don't get that at all.
B008HTJLF6,0,6,If you aren't used to a large screen, the S3 will take a little getting used to.
B008HTJLF6,0,7,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,0,8,A solid phone that is quick and responsive.
B008HTJLF6,0,9,It's a lot lighter than the iPhone and the screen is fantastic!
B008HTJLF6,0,10,I don't actually mind the plastic construction--doesn't feel "cheap" to me at all--but I'll likely get a TPU case for the grippiness.Shortcuts on your lockscreen is a great feature!
B008HTJLF6,0,11,Hands down.
B008HTJLF6,0,12,Amazing features, not sure I'll use them all but nice that they are there.
B008HTJLF6,0,13,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,0,14,In the month that I've had it I've gotten so used to it that now when I pick up my iPod touch, my immediate reaction is, "why did they design this screen so small?"
B008HTJLF6,0,15,She easily slips into my pocket, even with a back case on.FOUR: Surprisingly good battery life.
B008HTJLF6,0,16,Almost a shame to put a case on it.Good battery life.
B008HTJLF6,0,17,i love this phone!
B008HTJLF6,0,18,This is hands down the fastest, smoothest phone I've seen.
B008HTJLF6,0,19,The display is huge, and the phone is a bit big for one-handed operations, but it's also thin and fits in your pocket no problem.
B008HTJLF6,0,20,I have several very nice cases and screen protector on this baby.. have a glass tempered one and loving it, feel I have that protection in case a drop (let's hope not).Only thing at this point I don't really like with phone so far is when I open one of my folders or close, I have the ladys voice-  Folder open/Folder closed..
B008HTJLF6,0,21,Sure, there are ways around this, but is annoying nonetheless.Minor - so, yeah, big display, and if you have small-ish hands, 1-handed operations are risky, esp w/the somewhat slippery case.
B008HTJLF6,0,22,It's an amazing display.
B008HTJLF6,0,23,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,0,24,My daughter had an S3 and loved it, my other daughter has the Iphone 5 and though she loves it, she steered me toward the S3 as well.
B008HTJLF6,1,0,This is IMO the best android phone to date.
B008HTJLF6,1,1,Best Android Phone To Date.
B008HTJLF6,1,2,I like the android system and haven't used an iphone to compare it to.
B008HTJLF6,1,3,I have had a lot of Android phones over the last few years, and this is far and away the best I've ever had.
B008HTJLF6,1,4,Better than Iphone5 or any other Android phone out there.
B008HTJLF6,1,5,Tap into the Google Play store to load your favorite apps, and the SIII feels and functions as good as or better than any desktop or laptop I have ever had.
B008HTJLF6,1,6,Although samsung has not updated the firmware often the os alone is already good to use.
B008HTJLF6,1,7,Much better and faster than an Iphone!! I'M NEVER GOING BACK TO APPLE!! THIS IS THE BEST PHONE I'VE EVER HAD.
B008HTJLF6,1,8,The 2 gig of system memory combined with 16 gig of storage plus the 32 gig I added as expansion provides tons of room for apps and data.
B008HTJLF6,1,9,Good Smartphone for a Good Price.
B008HTJLF6,1,10,Excellent device.
B008HTJLF6,1,11,Great screen easy to see ,seemless operation ,with smart software not loaded with games and helpful hints along the way!
B008HTJLF6,1,12,If you do not have to have the latest and greatest smartphone, this phone will work well for you.
B008HTJLF6,1,13,Our favorite "fun" feature is the S-Beam, it's so easy to take a photo or share a document by just bumping our phones together.
B008HTJLF6,1,14,Very dependable, fast, takes excellent photos, clear voice quality, tons of available apps, works seamlessly with Google, etc.
B008HTJLF6,1,15,GREAT PHONE.
B008HTJLF6,1,16,Best phone on the market right now.
B008HTJLF6,1,17,Best phone on the market right now.
B008HTJLF6,1,18,Those two launchers are specifically made for the current version of android (ICS).
B008HTJLF6,1,19,Google Now is also much more useful in a phone than a tablet.
B008HTJLF6,1,20,Since I have a Samsung tablet all my apps and pictures from my tablet automatically came up on my phone!
B008HTJLF6,1,21,Great battery life.
B008HTJLF6,1,22,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,1,23,Overall, I expect to be very satisfied with this phone for the next 2 years.
B008HTJLF6,1,24,Best phone out there!
B008HTJLF6,2,0,Good Smartphone for a Good Price.
B008HTJLF6,2,1,Amazon had the best available price.
B008HTJLF6,2,2,Still a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,2,3,Overall, I expect to be very satisfied with this phone for the next 2 years.
B008HTJLF6,2,4,Well it's going to take forever for it to get 4.1/4.2
B008HTJLF6,2,5,This is a Nice smart phone.
B008HTJLF6,2,6,Other than that this is a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,2,7,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,2,8,The phone does seem fragile so don't skimp on a good case(otterbox defender).
B008HTJLF6,2,9,Phone is really great and I think probably the best outta smartphones I've had.. had about 6-7 so far.Battery on this phone is probably best I've experienced with this phone here.
B008HTJLF6,2,10,no review should be below 3 stars for this phone.
B008HTJLF6,2,11,Maybe it was just the degree of upgrade after 2 years, but whatever, it's a fantastic phone that I was happy to pay full price for at launch, instead of waiting a month or two for it to get discounted.Edit: 7/26.
B008HTJLF6,2,12,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,2,13,Great phone, 5* despite nitpicks.
B008HTJLF6,2,14,This was about a year ago.
B008HTJLF6,2,15,Less than two years after purchasing an HTC Incredible, which was a state of the art phone at the time, I decided to upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy SIII a few weeks ago.
B008HTJLF6,2,16,I got this phone from amazon over two weeks ago.Arrival:It arrived within just 2 days.Aesthetic: It looks really amazing the stupid picture on amazon doesn't do it justice at all.Performance: omg wow.
B008HTJLF6,2,17,All of the one star reviews must be getting paid by Apple because this phone blows the iPhone 5 out of the water.
B008HTJLF6,2,18,Great camera and camera options.
B008HTJLF6,2,19,A dud product can pop up anywhere, but what I love about Amazon is their willingness to fix any problems as quickly and respectfully as possible.
B008HTJLF6,2,20,I don't regret my decision at all because the GS3 is still a very good upgrade from my Samsung Droid Charge.
B008HTJLF6,2,21,The DNA coming out soon is better, there's a new Nexus device (but it isnt 4g), and the Note 2 is out.
B008HTJLF6,2,22,Really, for what you get for the price, Android offers more options.
B008HTJLF6,2,23,Camera is perfect and it has quite a powerful flash.If you are an android lover as I am you'll love this phone.I have had it overheat a time or 2 while taking lots and lots of pictures for a long time.
B008HTJLF6,2,24,I chose the GS3 over the GS4 because the price has dropped so much and I am trying to save money.
B008HTJLF6,3,0,And the battery life last past a day.
B008HTJLF6,3,1,It has a great battery life for my uses.
B008HTJLF6,3,2,Great battery life.
B008HTJLF6,3,3,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,3,4,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,3,5,I am not a phone gamer so the battery lasts about 10-12 hours with moderate, everyday use and taking pictures.
B008HTJLF6,3,6,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,3,7,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,3,8,BATTERY.
B008HTJLF6,3,9,With light use it lasts more than 24 hours, and with heavy use, like taking pictures all day long it dies in about 8 hours.the
B008HTJLF6,3,10,Battery life isn't great but that is to expected since it is a smart phone and used a lot during the day.
B008HTJLF6,3,11,It takes roughly 2-3 full hours to charge the battery from 5% to full charge.
B008HTJLF6,3,12,I've read bad reports on the battery life, and it's really not a factor.
B008HTJLF6,3,13,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,3,14,What a great phone!
B008HTJLF6,3,15,The speed is amazing, battery life is about 2 days for me, and I haven't had a single crash since I bought it.
B008HTJLF6,3,16,If I do some hard-core surfing, I will have to charge in the evening, but usually, one charge overnight sets me up for the whole day.
B008HTJLF6,3,17,Camera is perfect and it has quite a powerful flash.If you are an android lover as I am you'll love this phone.I have had it overheat a time or 2 while taking lots and lots of pictures for a long time.
B008HTJLF6,3,18,I can usually comfortably get through a whole day of moderate usage with maybe 15-30 percent left.
B008HTJLF6,3,19,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,3,20,It lasts all day for me after one week of use.
B008HTJLF6,3,21,Doing a speed test, I routinely get around 12 Mbps; that is as fast as my home internet connection.Battery Life2100 mAh battery.
B008HTJLF6,3,22,I've been going a full day on a single charge with medium-heavy usage with plenty to spare.
B008HTJLF6,3,23,Phone is really great and I think probably the best outta smartphones I've had.. had about 6-7 so far.Battery on this phone is probably best I've experienced with this phone here.
B008HTJLF6,3,24,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,4,0,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,4,1,Voice call quality is excellent.
B008HTJLF6,4,2,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,4,3,The quality of the pictures is also fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,4,4,This phone works fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,4,5,Great Phone with one glitch.
B008HTJLF6,4,6,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,4,7,People I have talked to also commented on how good it was.Screen-I love it, people who can't see this screen in sunlight must be a little blind.
B008HTJLF6,4,8,Let me start by saying great sound quality and my absolute favorite color!
B008HTJLF6,4,9,If I disconnect the audio connection, the phone call comes through the car phone speaker.
B008HTJLF6,4,10,How embarrassing.The call quality is very nice.
B008HTJLF6,4,11,Decent speaker for speakerphone or listening to podcasts.
B008HTJLF6,4,12,Like I said, there must be some people struggling with their eye sight and not the screen.This is just an excellent phone from what I have seen to this point.
B008HTJLF6,4,13,You can arrange your songs/movies according to folders or anything else you like..Picture/camera: awesome organization, can be according to faces, dates, anything really...Superb quality..really the best and easiest camera to work with by far.
B008HTJLF6,4,14,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,4,15,My S3 outperforms my wife's iPhone 4S in picture quality by far.GimmicksS Voice - The microphone picks up too much ambient noise, especially when driving.
B008HTJLF6,4,16,It is a fantastic piece of hardware.
B008HTJLF6,4,17,It has handled the internet, videos etc. without a glitch.
B008HTJLF6,4,18,Just lying on a restaurant table, I see other people hiding their inadequate phones when they see my little piece of hand-candy.
B008HTJLF6,4,19,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,4,20,Oh, and it looks great.
B008HTJLF6,4,21,Loved it.
B008HTJLF6,4,22,fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,4,23,If you're looking for a good phone with a decent screen size i would recommend the s3.
B008HTJLF6,4,24,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,5,0,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,5,1,Great camera and camera options.
B008HTJLF6,5,2,Other than that this is a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,5,3,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,5,4,The phone does seem fragile so don't skimp on a good case(otterbox defender).
B008HTJLF6,5,5,It has a great camera front and rear and great sound ,this phone is on the front line of technology!
B008HTJLF6,5,6,You can arrange your songs/movies according to folders or anything else you like..Picture/camera: awesome organization, can be according to faces, dates, anything really...Superb quality..really the best and easiest camera to work with by far.
B008HTJLF6,5,7,It's still pretty awesome.
B008HTJLF6,5,8,But besides that tweak, the hardware is solid and the camera is great.
B008HTJLF6,5,9,In fact it seems well built, but like most phones I would not want to drop it without a case.The 1080p video camera is a nice feature too, and the videos looks great!
B008HTJLF6,5,10,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,5,11,The camera is sweet too, and I like having burst mode.Oh, and its a phone too, and the calls are clear on both ends.
B008HTJLF6,5,12,Took some very nice pictures at a wedding.Con - Button placement redux (see Major 1 above).
B008HTJLF6,5,13,The ability to customize my phone is invaluable to me, which is why I always choose Android over Apple.Camera8-megapixel rear camera, 1.9-megapixel front camera.
B008HTJLF6,5,14,The speaker on the back is loud, the sound is amazing, the earbuds this comes with are actually pretty good, the processing power is phenominal.The camera is also the best of any phone...its essentially the iPhone 4S's camera...that Samsung made for them...but tweaked to use more cool features.The front camera works wonders with Tango and Google+...both are Android/Google's "Facetime" and work with anyone who has a front camera, unlike Facetime, which requires iOS.The people that give this bad reviews are doing so because of Verizon, not the phone itself.
B008HTJLF6,5,15,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,5,16,Gets rid of a huge peeve for my previous phone.Pro - Camera features work well, esp. the Best Shot mode.
B008HTJLF6,5,17,It has so many more features.
B008HTJLF6,5,18,Good Smartphone for a Good Price.
B008HTJLF6,5,19,The quality of the pictures is also fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,5,20,Best phone out there!
B008HTJLF6,5,21,The cable to charge it is a standard micro USB cable and if you want to access music, pictures or videos, you can do so by connecting it to ANY computer you want, no need to "pair it/sync it" with your iTunes account.The camera is great for both video as well as regular photographs.After one year of use, it is still very fast.I strongly recommend this phone.
B008HTJLF6,5,22,The fact that u can so easily switch between recording and picture taking is so awesome.Security: you can set it at whatever level of security you want: pins, face recognition, voice recognition, etc...Apps: it has any app you can possible want like recording phone calls, changing your voice, recording class lecture, games, academics...etc.
B008HTJLF6,5,23,It's amazingly fast and so many features.
B008HTJLF6,5,24,You can snap pictures instantly.
B008HTJLF6,6,0,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,6,1,Amazing features, not sure I'll use them all but nice that they are there.
B008HTJLF6,6,2,The 2 gig of system memory combined with 16 gig of storage plus the 32 gig I added as expansion provides tons of room for apps and data.
B008HTJLF6,6,3,Comes with great instructional video loaded that explains how to use everything including how to turn off background running programs to save battery life.
B008HTJLF6,6,4,Simple setup, easy learning curve, Looks amazing, nice sim card feature although I have not used it out of the US yet - we'll see about that.
B008HTJLF6,6,5,It takes roughly 2-3 full hours to charge the battery from 5% to full charge.
B008HTJLF6,6,6,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,6,7,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,6,8,16 GB + a 32 GB sd card gives me plenty of storage.
B008HTJLF6,6,9,for first time smart phone user this is easy to useand enough screen size for manipulate apps and internet.
B008HTJLF6,6,10,I explained that my prior phone an HTC Incredible (version 1) worked perfectly.
B008HTJLF6,6,11,Great camera and camera options.
B008HTJLF6,6,12,Everything works very nicely.
B008HTJLF6,6,13,good for first time smart phone user.
B008HTJLF6,6,14,Camera is perfect and it has quite a powerful flash.If you are an android lover as I am you'll love this phone.I have had it overheat a time or 2 while taking lots and lots of pictures for a long time.
B008HTJLF6,6,15,I am not a phone gamer so the battery lasts about 10-12 hours with moderate, everyday use and taking pictures.
B008HTJLF6,6,16,The cable to charge it is a standard micro USB cable and if you want to access music, pictures or videos, you can do so by connecting it to ANY computer you want, no need to "pair it/sync it" with your iTunes account.The camera is great for both video as well as regular photographs.After one year of use, it is still very fast.I strongly recommend this phone.
B008HTJLF6,6,17,Doing a looped video test, I can squeeze about 9 hours 15 minutes out of my phone.
B008HTJLF6,6,18,Love it!
B008HTJLF6,6,19,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,6,20,It has a great battery life for my uses.
B008HTJLF6,6,21,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,6,22,GREAT phone, love using it, easy to use.
B008HTJLF6,6,23,People I have talked to also commented on how good it was.Screen-I love it, people who can't see this screen in sunlight must be a little blind.
B008HTJLF6,6,24,The design and features of this phone gives the user everything they could need in a device that still fits in your pocket.
B008HTJLF6,7,0,I may look for another Samsung, a Galaxy 4 for my next one.
B008HTJLF6,7,1,My daughter had an S3 and loved it, my other daughter has the Iphone 5 and though she loves it, she steered me toward the S3 as well.
B008HTJLF6,7,2,The Samsung Galaxy S3 is without a doubt the best phone for ME.
B008HTJLF6,7,3,Samsung Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,7,4,GREAT PHONE.
B008HTJLF6,7,5,This is the fifth Samsung Galaxy in our family.
B008HTJLF6,7,6,I have owned the Samsung Galaxy S3 for about six months now.
B008HTJLF6,7,7,It took about three days after ordered the phone to receive it, and I fell in love with it instantly.
B008HTJLF6,7,8,Love this phone!
B008HTJLF6,7,9,I was on the treadmill and I dropped mine.
B008HTJLF6,7,10,got it and LOVED IT!!!
B008HTJLF6,7,11,The Samsung S3 gives you more power for the price than any Iphone.
B008HTJLF6,7,12,I've had mine for about a year, and it has really never given me any problems.
B008HTJLF6,7,13,My son ordered his first, and it worked  out for him, i was due for an upgrade as well,  so I decided lemme try it out.i
B008HTJLF6,7,14,Voice command is not a gimmick like the Iphone.
B008HTJLF6,7,15,I mailed the phone that day and the very next I had a brand new, this time fully functioning, galaxy 3. What could have been an infuriating experience turned out to be easy and stress-free.
B008HTJLF6,7,16,GREAT phone, love using it, easy to use.
B008HTJLF6,7,17,The S3 is a great phone to own for beginners.
B008HTJLF6,7,18,For the first time, I might keep a phone even when I can get a new one.
B008HTJLF6,7,19,I personally am terrified of dropping it due to the case.
B008HTJLF6,7,20,I am new to the world of smart phones, but several of my family members have/had the Galaxy S III or 4.  They all seemed very happy with it so I thought I'd try it out.
B008HTJLF6,7,21,I gave this phone to my mom as a gift because I loved mine so much!
B008HTJLF6,7,22,It has been excellent for me.Overall, this is a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,7,23,Perfect!
B008HTJLF6,7,24,Also, this phone is actually quite a bit better than the iPhone (No wonder Apple is worried).
B008HTJLF6,8,0,Well it's going to take forever for it to get 4.1/4.2
B008HTJLF6,8,1,So the phone is NOT the best on Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,8,2,I would recommend buying a phone on Amazon to anyone, and will do so again myself, knowing that if I ever have an issue there's a team of good-natured, helpful people waiting to help.
B008HTJLF6,8,3,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,8,4,It got so bad that I paid the $200 early termination fee and switched to Verizon and couldn't be happier.
B008HTJLF6,8,5,The DNA coming out soon is better, there's a new Nexus device (but it isnt 4g), and the Note 2 is out.
B008HTJLF6,8,6,I admit, I thought about buying the iPhone 5 and even the 4S on Verizon, but after my wife got the 4S and I spent some quality time with the phone, I was less than impressed with all of the hype.
B008HTJLF6,8,7,(including itunes)...use the money you save on all the sweet lightning deals here.The GS3 on any carrier gets 5/5 and on Verizon with the speed and reception it stays that way (although other carriers offer more features)
B008HTJLF6,8,8,People I have talked to also commented on how good it was.Screen-I love it, people who can't see this screen in sunlight must be a little blind.
B008HTJLF6,8,9,This phone comes with 50GB of dropbox storage...25GB on some carriers...Verizon's gets 0GB3) The bootloader, or way to easily root the device and get inside to tweak everything about the device (what Android is best for since everything is open-source) is locked and encrypted...Verizon is the only one refusing to open it.4)
B008HTJLF6,8,10,I was with another cellular carrier for many years and was getting tired of all the broken promises of network upgrades, better coverage and faster data.
B008HTJLF6,8,11,Voice call quality is excellent.
B008HTJLF6,8,12,Really, for what you get for the price, Android offers more options.
B008HTJLF6,8,13,I live in a small rural town and it has been excellent so far.
B008HTJLF6,8,14,Potentially bad experience turned great.
B008HTJLF6,8,15,It's also capable of 4G LTE speeds so the internet is blazing fast as well.Most of my friends have iphones, and they were envious of the looks/screen on this phone.
B008HTJLF6,8,16,I am on 150 MB family share plan.
B008HTJLF6,8,17,DONT read the one-star reviews, those people are just moping about a dumb issue...I'll explain.
B008HTJLF6,8,18,I really wanted the iphone 5, but could not find one in stock anywhere and got talked into this phone.
B008HTJLF6,8,19,Verizon decided to opt out of a lot of things that people want this phone for:1) NFC...payments made from the phone using a wireless connection and Google Wallet were switched off by Verizon, all other carriers get it.2)Dropbox--a
B008HTJLF6,8,20,Verizon had it on sale for $50, so I opted to get it through Amazon, and received it in two days!
B008HTJLF6,8,21,Renewed my contract with Verizon and only paid $20 for it!
B008HTJLF6,8,22,As soon as Verizon registered my new device, everything is synced!
B008HTJLF6,8,23,I have very few times where I've dropped a call but that very well could be because of the area I was in and not the actual phone itself.
B008HTJLF6,8,24,Mainly use it within Wifi range.
B008HTJLF6,9,0,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,9,1,Lightning fast 4G LTE.
B008HTJLF6,9,2,It has a dual core 1.5 ghz processor.
B008HTJLF6,9,3,The Galaxy S3 is a 4.0.3
B008HTJLF6,9,4,The DNA coming out soon is better, there's a new Nexus device (but it isnt 4g), and the Note 2 is out.
B008HTJLF6,9,5,Lightning fast browser...Awesome!
B008HTJLF6,9,6,I still keep a few on cuz they come in handy.The device is also incredible fast and smooth, and the screen looks perfect.
B008HTJLF6,9,7,Well it's going to take forever for it to get 4.1/4.2
B008HTJLF6,9,8,I may look for another Samsung, a Galaxy 4 for my next one.
B008HTJLF6,9,9,I know it's not a quad core like some newer phones, but it is still very fast at doing everything.
B008HTJLF6,9,10,With a dual core (US) 1.5 GHz processor, and 2 gigs (US) of RAM this thing will be future proof for the next two years that you own it.
B008HTJLF6,9,11,I upgraded from a Motorola Droid 2, and even though that was a good phone, this one really shows how slow that phone was.
B008HTJLF6,9,12,From what can be gathered on the internet, the S3 will still be supported with software updates at least through the next Android version 4.2.2 (and maybe further).
B008HTJLF6,9,13,Do you really need the Galaxy S4? Maybe not.
B008HTJLF6,9,14,It's also capable of 4G LTE speeds so the internet is blazing fast as well.Most of my friends have iphones, and they were envious of the looks/screen on this phone.
B008HTJLF6,9,15,It seems easily as fast as my Nexus 7 and I haven't found anything that won't run on it.
B008HTJLF6,9,16,Still a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,9,17,However, I have no issues with the speed of my S3.
B008HTJLF6,9,18,Great phone, 5* despite nitpicks.
B008HTJLF6,9,19,Until the Galaxy S4, and now the new Google Nexus 7 by Asus, the Galaxy S3 was the best smartphone on the market.
B008HTJLF6,9,20,But I have already moved on to aftemarket batteries (see Zero Lemon batteries) for my S3 and have seen improved battery life...Plus I have spare batteries to boot!Speed: The S4 has the latest and greatest quad core processor and 2G of memory, the S3 has a dual core processor and 2GB of memory, so if you are all about speed, then the S4 may be your best bet.
B008HTJLF6,9,21,16 GB + a 32 GB sd card gives me plenty of storage.
B008HTJLF6,9,22,Great display.
B008HTJLF6,9,23,I just recently upgraded to this phone from my previous HTC Droid Incredible II, and the Galaxy S III is AWESOME!
B008HTJLF6,9,24,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,10,0,GREAT phone, love using it, easy to use.
B008HTJLF6,10,1,With a little explanation I think it would be easy enough for newbies also.
B008HTJLF6,10,2,got it and LOVED IT!!!
B008HTJLF6,10,3,I love this phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,4,LOVE IT!!
B008HTJLF6,10,5,I loved that!!
B008HTJLF6,10,6,GREAT PHONE.
B008HTJLF6,10,7,i love this phone!
B008HTJLF6,10,8,I still love this phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,9,I have to say I love my phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,10,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,11,Love it!
B008HTJLF6,10,12,I love the large screen!
B008HTJLF6,10,13,Great phone!
B008HTJLF6,10,14,Great Phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,15,It is fairly easy to maneuver.
B008HTJLF6,10,16,GREAT PHONE.
B008HTJLF6,10,17,Love this phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,18,I love this phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,19,It has been excellent for me.Overall, this is a great phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,20,I must say I love it.
B008HTJLF6,10,21,I would recommend
B008HTJLF6,10,22,Amazing features, not sure I'll use them all but nice that they are there.
B008HTJLF6,10,23,It's a very easy to navigate phone.
B008HTJLF6,10,24,Phone is really great and I think probably the best outta smartphones I've had.. had about 6-7 so far.Battery on this phone is probably best I've experienced with this phone here.
B008HTJLF6,11,0,Wish the power button was on the top, it would make it easier.
B008HTJLF6,11,1,The power button is located on the right side of the phone near the top, and a volume rocker is located on the left side near the top.
B008HTJLF6,11,2,I also like the blue color.
B008HTJLF6,11,3,Im really not one to write reviews.
B008HTJLF6,11,4,This placement has caused me to unintentionally change the ringer status while trying to lock the phone given how I hold the phone.
B008HTJLF6,11,5,The design and features of this phone gives the user everything they could need in a device that still fits in your pocket.
B008HTJLF6,11,6,Phone is really great and I think probably the best outta smartphones I've had.. had about 6-7 so far.Battery on this phone is probably best I've experienced with this phone here.
B008HTJLF6,11,7,Really, it's the MSC & power button that might tempt me to leave the G3 a 4* review, but honestly, I just love the phone to death right now, which is kind of the bottom line.
B008HTJLF6,11,8,Notwithstanding other reviews here, I found the actual design and form factor of the phone to be a positive.As for the software, I have no complaints.
B008HTJLF6,11,9,The complaints I have are minor and more than likely users fault not the phones.
B008HTJLF6,11,10,GREAT phone, love using it, easy to use.
B008HTJLF6,11,11,Now for the list of things that make this phone the best android phone to date.The S4 processor with two gigs of ram.The Large 4.8 inch screen, which more than holds it own against all comers.The Camera is the best camera you can get on a phone right now bar none.The Battery life is the best on a smartphone outside of the Maxx, one suggestion would be to limit your background processes by going into developer options and change how many background processes your phone will allow.The Gesture controls are a very nice touch.The form factor is very sleek and sexy.Now for a list of things I don't like quite as much.The power button seems a bit flimsy to me, makes me wonder how it will hold up for two years.The signal is not quite as good as it should be for a phone made in 2012, but it is still very solid nonetheless.
B008HTJLF6,11,12,And the good news - I am glad I don't have the iPhone and don't feel left out at all.
B008HTJLF6,11,13,Took some very nice pictures at a wedding.Con - Button placement redux (see Major 1 above).
B008HTJLF6,11,14,This phone with small tweaks which make a huge difference has really become a new phone)I really love this phone..i hope you find my review useful cause i spent time to write it for you people that are deciding ...best of success to you in choosing.
B008HTJLF6,11,15,I find, though, if I just remember to reset the phone once a week (hold the power button and choose the option in the pop-up), it never freezes up.Did I mention that I LOVE THIS PHONE?I have really played around with this puppy, so if you think you've found something I might like, drop a comment.
B008HTJLF6,11,16,Great camera and camera options.
B008HTJLF6,11,17,I am not crazy about Android based sofware, but it is OK.I do love the phone, can't really say I have any complaints about it at all excpet for accidentally hitting the volume key when I turn the power off.
B008HTJLF6,11,18,I get better signal than I did on my Nexus.Touchwiz is a bit clunky; but as I mentioned above that can be easily remedied by using Apex or Nova.Overall, I would recommend this phone to ANYONE.
B008HTJLF6,11,19,Camera is perfect and it has quite a powerful flash.If you are an android lover as I am you'll love this phone.I have had it overheat a time or 2 while taking lots and lots of pictures for a long time.
B008HTJLF6,11,20,This is IMO the best android phone to date.
B008HTJLF6,11,21,Best Android Phone To Date.
B008HTJLF6,11,22,When in quiet places, I generally have a pretty good success rate when using S Voice, but I'm really hoping when Jellybean gets pushed to the S3 that Google Now will really pick up the slack.Pop Up Play - I've never used it, as I see no practical use in it.Share Shot - would be a great feature if the only phone in the world was the S3ProsBeautiful screenGorilla Glass 2Smooth running OSSpeedy, high quality camera4GRobust customization optionsFast GPS lock (I didn't mention this in the review, but the GPS lock on this phone is incredibly fast)ConsLocked Bootloader (Verizon only)No Google Wallet (such a horrible move on Verizon's part)Battery cover hard to remove (minor complaint but still worth noting especially if you ever need to change your battery)Speaker placementConclusion: You would be a wise man indeed to purchase a Samsung Galaxy S3.
B008HTJLF6,11,23,Before you purchase this phone I urge you to really think about your needs, and stack them against this review.
B008HTJLF6,11,24,Added thoughts after 2 weeks of ownership and experience of travel (air & driving) with the phone (because this review wasn't long enough!).Pro - GPS locks very quickly.
B008HTJLF6,12,0,I am on 150 MB family share plan.
B008HTJLF6,12,1,I read emails throughout the day, calls, texts, occasional game, just everyday use.
B008HTJLF6,12,2,I simply love it.
B008HTJLF6,12,3,Phone is really great and I think probably the best outta smartphones I've had.. had about 6-7 so far.Battery on this phone is probably best I've experienced with this phone here.
B008HTJLF6,12,4,I can work this phone hard, I mean constant youtube videos, some games, taking pictures, making some phone calls and stuff, and doing some e-mails (4 email accounts).. even though I don't sync but 6 minutes on every hour.
B008HTJLF6,12,5,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,12,6,Verizon let me keep my plan, and so far I haven't upgraded to 2 GB yet.
B008HTJLF6,12,7,This phone is GREAT.
B008HTJLF6,12,8,At only $25 with 2-year contract extension on Verizon, this is a fantastic phone for the price; it was twice the money at the Verizon store when I was shopping around.
B008HTJLF6,12,9,Love this phone!
B008HTJLF6,12,10,What a great phone!
B008HTJLF6,12,11,I am constantly amazed at what it can do and I try to take advantage of the sync function with Google as well as I can.
B008HTJLF6,12,12,Voice call quality is excellent.
B008HTJLF6,12,13,Verizon had it on sale for $50, so I opted to get it through Amazon, and received it in two days!
B008HTJLF6,12,14,I'm really loving this phone even though few little things that bug me.
B008HTJLF6,12,15,I used to work for Verizon, and I've tested a lot of phones.
B008HTJLF6,12,16,Awkward!Also, I'd love to be able to pull some of the sounds from the phone for my laptop (When email comes in on the phone, I have this cool Temple Bell sound which I had to go scour the Internet to find for my laptop).
B008HTJLF6,12,17,It's amazingly fast and so many features.
B008HTJLF6,12,18,Be it my calendar, sports teams, weather, I am now in the know just by looking at my phone.
B008HTJLF6,12,19,As soon as Verizon registered my new device, everything is synced!
B008HTJLF6,12,20,Simple setup, easy learning curve, Looks amazing, nice sim card feature although I have not used it out of the US yet - we'll see about that.
B008HTJLF6,12,21,Mainly use it within Wifi range.
B008HTJLF6,12,22,Or if you have a question, I'll figure out the answer somehow (e.g.
B008HTJLF6,12,23,Doing a looped video test, I can squeeze about 9 hours 15 minutes out of my phone.
B008HTJLF6,12,24,Camera is perfect and it has quite a powerful flash.If you are an android lover as I am you'll love this phone.I have had it overheat a time or 2 while taking lots and lots of pictures for a long time.
B008HTJLF6,13,0,I did eventually get a screen protector after about 6 weeks.
B008HTJLF6,13,1,Bigger screen more feature equals a happier customer.
B008HTJLF6,13,2,I have an DSLR for the important stuff!Screen: The S4 is bigger (5" vs 4.8") and full HD (1080P vs 720 P).
B008HTJLF6,13,3,A good case might alleviate this.Semi-con - This is 100% on me, but don't get too cocky about the Gorilla Glass 2.  I managed to scratch it a tiny bit in the 2 weeks thinking it was invincible, and it's not.
B008HTJLF6,13,4,Well it's going to take forever for it to get 4.1/4.2
B008HTJLF6,13,5,I have had zero trouble seeing it in direct sunlight and when moving the screen so it is taking the full rays of light, I still can see the screen.
B008HTJLF6,13,6,The large display is bright and shows vibrant colors; watching movies or reading ebooks is a real pleasure.
B008HTJLF6,13,7,So if using your phone as a TV remote control, or being able to perform tasks without touching the screen are big factors for you, then get the S4.
B008HTJLF6,13,8,That is pretty damn cool.
B008HTJLF6,13,9,It's fast, the screen is gorgeous, and everything is responsive.What did Verizon leave out?
B008HTJLF6,13,10,You can create custom music settings, watch flash content, and there's a nice 4.7 inch high definition 1280x720 pixel screen.
B008HTJLF6,13,11,I don't actually mind the plastic construction--doesn't feel "cheap" to me at all--but I'll likely get a TPU case for the grippiness.Shortcuts on your lockscreen is a great feature!
B008HTJLF6,13,12,Sure, there are ways around this, but is annoying nonetheless.Minor - so, yeah, big display, and if you have small-ish hands, 1-handed operations are risky, esp w/the somewhat slippery case.
B008HTJLF6,13,13,The display is huge, and the phone is a bit big for one-handed operations, but it's also thin and fits in your pocket no problem.
B008HTJLF6,13,14,The S3 is simply not as nice of a screen as the S4...but it's perfectly usable and still looks great to my eye.IR sensor:  Simply put, the S4 has them the S3 does not.
B008HTJLF6,13,15,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,13,16,She easily slips into my pocket, even with a back case on.FOUR: Surprisingly good battery life.
B008HTJLF6,13,17,Plus the RAZR MAXX HD is pretty cool.But as far as a phone goes there's nothing wrong with buying this at all.
B008HTJLF6,13,18,The S3 is loaded with features and the camera rivals many point-and-shoot models.
B008HTJLF6,13,19,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,13,20,To me, these sound like cool features I would use once or twice, then probably never again.Additional sensors: The S4 also comes with an array of humidity sensor, thermometer, and a barometric pressure sensor.
B008HTJLF6,13,21,If this is a huge deal breaker, then the S4 does have a better camera (13MP vs 8MP), but I still don't use my phone as my primary camera anyway.
B008HTJLF6,13,22,if you want bigger then you can always get the note 2. Although i was a little disappointed by the touching phones transfer.
B008HTJLF6,13,23,Camera is perfect and it has quite a powerful flash.If you are an android lover as I am you'll love this phone.I have had it overheat a time or 2 while taking lots and lots of pictures for a long time.
B008HTJLF6,13,24,I purchased a silicone case just to keep the back scratch free and provide a little cushion in case dropped.
B008HTJLF6,14,0,I had an iPhone before so getting used to the Android apps was the biggest thing.
B008HTJLF6,14,1,Just give me android.
B008HTJLF6,14,2,The 2 gig of system memory combined with 16 gig of storage plus the 32 gig I added as expansion provides tons of room for apps and data.
B008HTJLF6,14,3,My only complaint is that Samsung should not deviate too much from google android.
B008HTJLF6,14,4,It runs all of todays apps with no problems.Cameras:
B008HTJLF6,14,5,It has 2 gigs of ram, which is still on par with the newest phones, and apps almost never close on me even when I've opened many other ones.
B008HTJLF6,14,6,This phone is a dream.FIVE: Sometimes the OS (Android ICS) freezes.
B008HTJLF6,14,7,Currently, there are not many apps that can use these sensors, but as with anything, there will probably be a lot that spring up in the near future.
B008HTJLF6,14,8,Google account will hold all in the information about all the apps you download, your number, and much more.If you set up Facebook to your phone it will give you the option to sync your friends list with your contact list.
B008HTJLF6,14,9,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,14,10,No ring/vibrate switch from the lockscreen either.Anyway, plenty of software nits that can be fixed by downloading replacement apps or rooting.
B008HTJLF6,14,11,DONT read the one-star reviews, those people are just moping about a dumb issue...I'll explain.
B008HTJLF6,14,12,Verizon has just rolled out the jellybean OS and the phone is even better.I learned that the phone will give a voice news briefing each day at time you set.
B008HTJLF6,14,13,Iphone Killer.
B008HTJLF6,14,14,Voice command is not a gimmick like the Iphone.
B008HTJLF6,14,15,Samsung should just focus on hardware and maybe few embellisments to software but leave google UI alone.
B008HTJLF6,14,16,I can finally disable all the annoying Verizon (& Samsung) apps w/o rooting (though you need to root to fully uninstall them).
B008HTJLF6,14,17,I know you could always do things to get better battery than I've been having, I personally don't care to root this yet or do any of the tweaks.
B008HTJLF6,14,18,I'm not sure I like samsung UI on top of android.
B008HTJLF6,14,19,I like the android system and haven't used an iphone to compare it to.
B008HTJLF6,14,20,I can work this phone hard, I mean constant youtube videos, some games, taking pictures, making some phone calls and stuff, and doing some e-mails (4 email accounts).. even though I don't sync but 6 minutes on every hour.
B008HTJLF6,14,21,Verizon decided to opt out of a lot of things that people want this phone for:1) NFC...payments made from the phone using a wireless connection and Google Wallet were switched off by Verizon, all other carriers get it.2)Dropbox--a
B008HTJLF6,14,22,In fact, when opening ANY app that uses data, Verizon has a big pop up that asks you to switch to an open wifi so you dont use their data...you have to physically hit the "no" every single time...even when checking facebook you have to.
B008HTJLF6,14,23,Moderate use: playing games, making calls, using Tapatalk, checking my Google+, Twitter, Flipboard, and reading other news articles, I can usually get a good 16 hours of battery life.OSI could write several pages just on how much better ICS is than any other Android build I've used, but I'm going to leave it to you to research this.
B008HTJLF6,14,24,But if you want a great phone, that is fully capable of running all of todays apps and at a great price, you still can't go wrong with the S3!There are tons of these comparisons online, here is one I like.
B008HTJLF6,15,0,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,15,1,Well it's going to take forever for it to get 4.1/4.2
B008HTJLF6,15,2,Phone is really great and I think probably the best outta smartphones I've had.. had about 6-7 so far.Battery on this phone is probably best I've experienced with this phone here.
B008HTJLF6,15,3,Great Deal.
B008HTJLF6,15,4,VZW wanted to charge me $99 for a replacement Samsung Galaxy S III...WELL, that seemed a little senseless to me considering my husband only paid $20 for the phone brand new from Amazon Wireless.
B008HTJLF6,15,5,Best "VZ"upgrade.
B008HTJLF6,15,6,Verizon had it on sale for $50, so I opted to get it through Amazon, and received it in two days!
B008HTJLF6,15,7,I've had this phone for over a month now.. month and few weeks maybe.
B008HTJLF6,15,8,Renewed my contract with Verizon and only paid $20 for it!
B008HTJLF6,15,9,GREAT PHONE.
B008HTJLF6,15,10,BUY ONE TODAY, YOU WILL NOT REGRET PURCHASING IT.
B008HTJLF6,15,11,no review should be below 3 stars for this phone.
B008HTJLF6,15,12,Especially this week when places like Sam's Club are having these for 69 cents and Apple refuses to discount anything.
B008HTJLF6,15,13,Really, for what you get for the price, Android offers more options.
B008HTJLF6,15,14,The DNA coming out soon is better, there's a new Nexus device (but it isnt 4g), and the Note 2 is out.
B008HTJLF6,15,15,Best phone ive ever owned.
B008HTJLF6,15,16,I would recommend buying a phone on Amazon to anyone, and will do so again myself, knowing that if I ever have an issue there's a team of good-natured, helpful people waiting to help.
B008HTJLF6,15,17,I upgraded from a Motorola Droid 2, and even though that was a good phone, this one really shows how slow that phone was.
B008HTJLF6,15,18,I checked all settings and just don't see how to stop this, anyone know?all and all this phone is a very great phone and I'd recommend to people out there.
B008HTJLF6,15,19,So the phone is NOT the best on Verizon.
B008HTJLF6,15,20,Good Smartphone for a Good Price.
B008HTJLF6,15,21,Potentially bad experience turned great.
B008HTJLF6,15,22,Amazon had the best available price.
B008HTJLF6,15,23,I decided to get my Galaxy III phone on amazon at the advice of someone within the Verizon store, who told me that I could get the phone cheaper online.
B008HTJLF6,15,24,What a great phone!
B008HTJLF6,16,0,It takes roughly 2-3 full hours to charge the battery from 5% to full charge.
B008HTJLF6,16,1,It usually takes all day for my battery to go down.
B008HTJLF6,16,2,Within forty-eight hours, however, the phone had turned itself off and would not turn back on again.
B008HTJLF6,16,3,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,16,4,I have no issues yet, 3 months usage.
B008HTJLF6,16,5,My battery held for a day and a half - after I finished messing with it every minute of the day.Enjoy it, I am.
B008HTJLF6,16,6,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,16,7,And the battery life last past a day.
B008HTJLF6,16,8,With light use it lasts more than 24 hours, and with heavy use, like taking pictures all day long it dies in about 8 hours.the
B008HTJLF6,16,9,I have absolutely no complaints about the battery life of this phone.
B008HTJLF6,16,10,It has a great battery life for my uses.
B008HTJLF6,16,11,I am not a phone gamer so the battery lasts about 10-12 hours with moderate, everyday use and taking pictures.
B008HTJLF6,16,12,Although many reviewers complain about battery life, I find that I can go an entire day of heavy usage and still have plenty of reserve.
B008HTJLF6,16,13,I don't know how battery life is with non-stop streaming videos on say Youtube or Netflix because I don't use those often but when my children have it took a bit to run the battery down.
B008HTJLF6,16,14,The speed is amazing, battery life is about 2 days for me, and I haven't had a single crash since I bought it.
B008HTJLF6,16,15,I charge it in my car, i charge it at home and I charge it at work, nbd.I highly recommend this phone its great.
B008HTJLF6,16,16,Great battery life.
B008HTJLF6,16,17,Wish the battery lasted longer without having to disable the GPS and some other features to keep it going longer
B008HTJLF6,16,18,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,16,19,Potentially bad experience turned great.
B008HTJLF6,16,20,Battery life isn't great but that is to expected since it is a smart phone and used a lot during the day.
B008HTJLF6,16,21,I managed to lose the phone last week...so salty about that.
B008HTJLF6,16,22,My only complaint is when I turn my phone on silent or vibrate it does NOT silent the alarms set.
B008HTJLF6,16,23,BATTERY.
B008HTJLF6,16,24,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,17,0,If I disconnect the audio connection, the phone call comes through the car phone speaker.
B008HTJLF6,17,1,With the phone synced to the car via bluetooth, when the phone rings, I hear the ring through the car speaker assigned by the car bluetooth for the phone.
B008HTJLF6,17,2,I found that the dock for this phone does sit upright - something I will order soon.The one glitch I discovered was with the bluetooth phone connection to my car - a 2007 Toyota Camry.
B008HTJLF6,17,3,It never lags or makes me wait for anything.Call quality- I am shocked that some have complained about the call quality because I have experienced very good call quality.
B008HTJLF6,17,4,You can hear your callers clearly and loudly.
B008HTJLF6,17,5,When I want to listen to music on my phone, I connect the audio plug to the car stereo aux plug.
B008HTJLF6,17,6,When I press the answer button the call connects but the phone sound does not come through the car phone speaker.
B008HTJLF6,17,7,The standard bluetooth is able to determine if the connection is for phone only or phone and audio.
B008HTJLF6,17,8,A call to Samsung tech support revealed that the bluetooth phone audio will not work when the audio plug is accessed for the aux stereo.
B008HTJLF6,17,9,How embarrassing.The call quality is very nice.
B008HTJLF6,17,10,I have very few times where I've dropped a call but that very well could be because of the area I was in and not the actual phone itself.
B008HTJLF6,17,11,This phone works fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,17,12,Another disappointment to me is the way the speaker is placed; it's on the rear of the phone and if you have the phone on a flat table, it muffles the sound from the speaker.ScreenYou're going to be working with a 4.8-inch Super AMOLED HD display.
B008HTJLF6,17,13,Great Phone with one glitch.
B008HTJLF6,17,14,The camera is sweet too, and I like having burst mode.Oh, and its a phone too, and the calls are clear on both ends.
B008HTJLF6,17,15,I do not believe that samsung has implemented the bluetooth standard correctly.
B008HTJLF6,17,16,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,17,17,My only complaint is when I turn my phone on silent or vibrate it does NOT silent the alarms set.
B008HTJLF6,17,18,So all your friends information is straight at your fingertips.I like the phone's swype feature while texting when I can't use both hands for whatever reason or I don't want to turn down the volume but want to quietly text.The phone's ringer is loud.
B008HTJLF6,17,19,I have a Samsung TV so I can send them wirelessly from the phone to the TV.
B008HTJLF6,17,20,The quality of the pictures is also fantastic.
B008HTJLF6,17,21,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,17,22,The only time I do not get 4G is when I'm on the island of Coronado, and even then it just cuts in and out.
B008HTJLF6,17,23,for first time smart phone user this is easy to useand enough screen size for manipulate apps and internet.
B008HTJLF6,17,24,One small complaint is the battery cover: you have to somewhat pry it off starting with a little slip on top center of the phone.
B008HTJLF6,18,0,Good Smartphone for a Good Price.
B008HTJLF6,18,1,If this is a huge deal breaker, then the S4 does have a better camera (13MP vs 8MP), but I still don't use my phone as my primary camera anyway.
B008HTJLF6,18,2,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,18,3,If you want to crop or edit your photos you will need to download a different app though because nothing comes with the phone to do this.The battery life is decent.
B008HTJLF6,18,4,The camera is also great.
B008HTJLF6,18,5,no review should be below 3 stars for this phone.
B008HTJLF6,18,6,I am not a phone gamer so the battery lasts about 10-12 hours with moderate, everyday use and taking pictures.
B008HTJLF6,18,7,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,18,8,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,18,9,Great camera and camera options.
B008HTJLF6,18,10,I have some instances where my pictures turn out blurry or grainy but that's more than likely due to the light source and or shaky hands and not necessarily the phones fault.
B008HTJLF6,18,11,The battery life is great to.
B008HTJLF6,18,12,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,18,13,Battery life isn't great but that is to expected since it is a smart phone and used a lot during the day.
B008HTJLF6,18,14,Phone is really great and I think probably the best outta smartphones I've had.. had about 6-7 so far.Battery on this phone is probably best I've experienced with this phone here.
B008HTJLF6,18,15,It has a great camera front and rear and great sound ,this phone is on the front line of technology!
B008HTJLF6,18,16,Doing a looped video test, I can squeeze about 9 hours 15 minutes out of my phone.
B008HTJLF6,18,17,And since it's a flagship phone, you get a lot of updates and improvements.
B008HTJLF6,18,18,The DNA coming out soon is better, there's a new Nexus device (but it isnt 4g), and the Note 2 is out.
B008HTJLF6,18,19,I have yet to have a real problem, even tethering works smoothly with multiple devices.I have dropped this phone one time and although it did get some scratches it still looks good and works, no cracked screen or any nonsense.The battery life blows, but I use this thing constantly; movies, internet, reddit, I'm always on it so I just charge it everywhere.
B008HTJLF6,18,20,But besides that tweak, the hardware is solid and the camera is great.
B008HTJLF6,18,21,To me, these sound like cool features I would use once or twice, then probably never again.Additional sensors: The S4 also comes with an array of humidity sensor, thermometer, and a barometric pressure sensor.
B008HTJLF6,18,22,Much better and faster than an Iphone!! I'M NEVER GOING BACK TO APPLE!! THIS IS THE BEST PHONE I'VE EVER HAD.
B008HTJLF6,18,23,I had an iPhone before so getting used to the Android apps was the biggest thing.
B008HTJLF6,18,24,I don't know how battery life is with non-stop streaming videos on say Youtube or Netflix because I don't use those often but when my children have it took a bit to run the battery down.
B008HTJLF6,19,0,16 GB + a 32 GB sd card gives me plenty of storage.
B008HTJLF6,19,1,It also has a decent amount of memory, and it even offers a memory card slot if you don't have enough.
B008HTJLF6,19,2,It has 2 gigs of ram, which is still on par with the newest phones, and apps almost never close on me even when I've opened many other ones.
B008HTJLF6,19,3,You can expand its memory capacity-- mine came with the standard 16GB and then I added 8GB more, my brother's also came with 16GB but he added an extra 16GB.Unlike the iPhone, the Galaxy S3 can be used anywhere.
B008HTJLF6,19,4,Less flexibility in dragging & dropping files, folders, etc from your computer.
B008HTJLF6,19,5,USB port on the bottom makes no sense though.Major 2 - No MSC (Mass Storage Control) transfer, only MTP & PTP.
B008HTJLF6,19,6,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,19,7,I am not a phone gamer so the battery lasts about 10-12 hours with moderate, everyday use and taking pictures.
B008HTJLF6,19,8,The cable to charge it is a standard micro USB cable and if you want to access music, pictures or videos, you can do so by connecting it to ANY computer you want, no need to "pair it/sync it" with your iTunes account.The camera is great for both video as well as regular photographs.After one year of use, it is still very fast.I strongly recommend this phone.
B008HTJLF6,19,9,The 2 gig of system memory combined with 16 gig of storage plus the 32 gig I added as expansion provides tons of room for apps and data.
B008HTJLF6,19,10,Took some very nice pictures at a wedding.Con - Button placement redux (see Major 1 above).
B008HTJLF6,19,11,Except you have to unlock the phone to actually launch the apps.
B008HTJLF6,19,12,Doing a looped video test, I can squeeze about 9 hours 15 minutes out of my phone.
B008HTJLF6,19,13,Camera is perfect and it has quite a powerful flash.If you are an android lover as I am you'll love this phone.I have had it overheat a time or 2 while taking lots and lots of pictures for a long time.
B008HTJLF6,19,14,I've had mine for about a year, and it has really never given me any problems.
B008HTJLF6,19,15,Not watching movies or anything that requires the LCD to be on for hours at a time, obviously, but for most usage, you should be fine just plugging in at night.Nitpicks:Major 1 - Power button placement on the right, usb port on the bottom.
B008HTJLF6,19,16,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,19,17,Straight out of the box it's easily accessible.You need a google account to set up your phone when you first turn it on.
B008HTJLF6,19,18,My eyes aren't what they used to be and it's so easy to read!I had never used an Android phone before so I had a bit of a learning curve because things weren't where I was used to them being.
B008HTJLF6,19,19,I had an iPhone before so getting used to the Android apps was the biggest thing.
B008HTJLF6,19,20,I have no issues yet, 3 months usage.
B008HTJLF6,19,21,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,19,22,There is an option to have 'noise reduction' turned on/off and there is also an option for extra volume turned on/off while on a call.Another complaint I have is when I am on the phone and need to do something like text message I will hit the 'home' key located in the middle of phone on the bottom.
B008HTJLF6,19,23,I've read bad reports on the battery life, and it's really not a factor.
B008HTJLF6,19,24,If this is a huge deal breaker, then the S4 does have a better camera (13MP vs 8MP), but I still don't use my phone as my primary camera anyway.
B008HTJLF6,20,0,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,20,1,I may look for another Samsung, a Galaxy 4 for my next one.
B008HTJLF6,20,2,It takes roughly 2-3 full hours to charge the battery from 5% to full charge.
B008HTJLF6,20,3,I have no issues yet, 3 months usage.
B008HTJLF6,20,4,I've had this phone for over a month now.. month and few weeks maybe.
B008HTJLF6,20,5,I have very few times where I've dropped a call but that very well could be because of the area I was in and not the actual phone itself.
B008HTJLF6,20,6,I've had mine for about a year, and it has really never given me any problems.
B008HTJLF6,20,7,BUY ONE TODAY, YOU WILL NOT REGRET PURCHASING IT.
B008HTJLF6,20,8,I did eventually get a screen protector after about 6 weeks.
B008HTJLF6,20,9,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,20,10,I have owned the Samsung Galaxy S3 for about six months now.
B008HTJLF6,20,11,Overall, I expect to be very satisfied with this phone for the next 2 years.
B008HTJLF6,20,12,I have yet to have a real problem, even tethering works smoothly with multiple devices.I have dropped this phone one time and although it did get some scratches it still looks good and works, no cracked screen or any nonsense.The battery life blows, but I use this thing constantly; movies, internet, reddit, I'm always on it so I just charge it everywhere.
B008HTJLF6,20,13,good for first time smart phone user.
B008HTJLF6,20,14,no review should be below 3 stars for this phone.
B008HTJLF6,20,15,The Galaxy S3 is a 4.0.3
B008HTJLF6,20,16,Within forty-eight hours, however, the phone had turned itself off and would not turn back on again.
B008HTJLF6,20,17,It never lags or makes me wait for anything.Call quality- I am shocked that some have complained about the call quality because I have experienced very good call quality.
B008HTJLF6,20,18,People I have talked to also commented on how good it was.Screen-I love it, people who can't see this screen in sunlight must be a little blind.
B008HTJLF6,20,19,Less than two years after purchasing an HTC Incredible, which was a state of the art phone at the time, I decided to upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy SIII a few weeks ago.
B008HTJLF6,20,20,I purchased a silicone case just to keep the back scratch free and provide a little cushion in case dropped.
B008HTJLF6,20,21,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,20,22,Maybe it was just the degree of upgrade after 2 years, but whatever, it's a fantastic phone that I was happy to pay full price for at launch, instead of waiting a month or two for it to get discounted.Edit: 7/26.
B008HTJLF6,20,23,And the battery life last past a day.
B008HTJLF6,20,24,I mailed the phone that day and the very next I had a brand new, this time fully functioning, galaxy 3. What could have been an infuriating experience turned out to be easy and stress-free.
B008HTJLF6,21,0,Verizon decided to opt out of a lot of things that people want this phone for:1) NFC...payments made from the phone using a wireless connection and Google Wallet were switched off by Verizon, all other carriers get it.2)Dropbox--a
B008HTJLF6,21,1,Well it's going to take forever for it to get 4.1/4.2
B008HTJLF6,21,2,I would recommend buying a phone on Amazon to anyone, and will do so again myself, knowing that if I ever have an issue there's a team of good-natured, helpful people waiting to help.
B008HTJLF6,21,3,I don't usually get 3G coverage with BB, however with S3 i haven't dropped a call yet.
B008HTJLF6,21,4,Everywhere else I have been in San Diego, I get exceptional service.
B008HTJLF6,21,5,Frustrated, I called customer service and spoke with an incredibly empathetic lady who promised to resend a brand new phone to me as soon as I mailed the broken phone to them.
B008HTJLF6,21,6,but that's every single Verizon Droid anyway...it also doesn't have a few things that other carriers get...but again..that's Verizon...reviewing all of those things separately is pointless since you'd have to give those negatives for a lot of Verizon phones....What Verizon DOES do is offer insane 4G speeds and great reception.As far as this device goes you can find it this week for $50 at most places which makes it an instant win over the competition, plus it's got removable storage, something the DNA and Nexus don't have...and a removable giant battery (something the MAXX HD doesn't have).The Note 2 is more powerful and a little cooler, but it might be too big for people.My vote: DNA=1st, Note 2=2nd, GS3=3rd, MAXX HD=4th....overall though, im an android nerd and this thing rocks.As for the Apple people....if it was $200 for both I'd ask what equipment you have in your home...if you say all Apple products then go with the iPhone...but this device is bigger, has an actual HD screen, and you can really make it your own with customizing.
B008HTJLF6,21,7,I am on 150 MB family share plan.
B008HTJLF6,21,8,Especially this week when places like Sam's Club are having these for 69 cents and Apple refuses to discount anything.
B008HTJLF6,21,9,It takes roughly 2-3 full hours to charge the battery from 5% to full charge.
B008HTJLF6,21,10,Verizon had it on sale for $50, so I opted to get it through Amazon, and received it in two days!
B008HTJLF6,21,11,I haven't found a thing that my S3 can't run flawlessly.Connectivity (Signal Strength)I'm currently in San Diego, CA.
B008HTJLF6,21,12,Within forty-eight hours, however, the phone had turned itself off and would not turn back on again.
B008HTJLF6,21,13,no review should be below 3 stars for this phone.
B008HTJLF6,21,14,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,21,15,The DNA coming out soon is better, there's a new Nexus device (but it isnt 4g), and the Note 2 is out.
B008HTJLF6,21,16,Mainly use it within Wifi range.
B008HTJLF6,21,17,It's VERY frustrating because normally I cannot go back and do anything with the call until they hang up and end the call.
B008HTJLF6,21,18,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,21,19,I have very few times where I've dropped a call but that very well could be because of the area I was in and not the actual phone itself.
B008HTJLF6,21,20,The only reason to not buy an S3 is if you're an Apple Fanboy.
B008HTJLF6,21,21,Doing a speed test, I routinely get around 12 Mbps; that is as fast as my home internet connection.Battery Life2100 mAh battery.
B008HTJLF6,21,22,I can finally disable all the annoying Verizon (& Samsung) apps w/o rooting (though you need to root to fully uninstall them).
B008HTJLF6,21,23,People will complain that this has a PENTILE display, which has faced very harsh reviews on other phones.
B008HTJLF6,21,24,On this phone, if you do that in the call list, you call the person (or text them if you drag left).
B008HTJLF6,22,0,With a dual core (US) 1.5 GHz processor, and 2 gigs (US) of RAM this thing will be future proof for the next two years that you own it.
B008HTJLF6,22,1,I hated that I've had to go back to my HTC droid incredible 2.
B008HTJLF6,22,2,I know that this phone does have version 4.0 bluetooth.
B008HTJLF6,22,3,I explained that my prior phone an HTC Incredible (version 1) worked perfectly.
B008HTJLF6,22,4,It has a dual core 1.5 ghz processor.
B008HTJLF6,22,5,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,22,6,I may look for another Samsung, a Galaxy 4 for my next one.
B008HTJLF6,22,7,The fast processor makes all operations smooth with virtually no lag even while running multiple apps.
B008HTJLF6,22,8,It seems easily as fast as my Nexus 7 and I haven't found anything that won't run on it.
B008HTJLF6,22,9,Lightning fast 4G LTE.
B008HTJLF6,22,10,The 2 gig of system memory combined with 16 gig of storage plus the 32 gig I added as expansion provides tons of room for apps and data.
B008HTJLF6,22,11,I still keep a few on cuz they come in handy.The device is also incredible fast and smooth, and the screen looks perfect.
B008HTJLF6,22,12,This is a must have phone if you are looking to upgrade.
B008HTJLF6,22,13,I upgraded from a Motorola Droid 2, and even though that was a good phone, this one really shows how slow that phone was.
B008HTJLF6,22,14,I know it's not a quad core like some newer phones, but it is still very fast at doing everything.
B008HTJLF6,22,15,4G LTE is blazing fast at my location (SE Michigan).ICS, how do I love thee?
B008HTJLF6,22,16,The DNA coming out soon is better, there's a new Nexus device (but it isnt 4g), and the Note 2 is out.
B008HTJLF6,22,17,I can't think of one complaint I might have or had about this phone.
B008HTJLF6,22,18,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,22,19,and installations are faster than any other phone i promise (including iphone for sure)Other notes: (I had the Galaxy Sii and i hated it.
B008HTJLF6,22,20,It's also capable of 4G LTE speeds so the internet is blazing fast as well.Most of my friends have iphones, and they were envious of the looks/screen on this phone.
B008HTJLF6,22,21,My only complaint is that Samsung should not deviate too much from google android.
B008HTJLF6,22,22,16 GB + a 32 GB sd card gives me plenty of storage.
B008HTJLF6,22,23,For a phone with a 4.8" screen the battery life is pretty good.
B008HTJLF6,22,24,Verizon let me keep my plan, and so far I haven't upgraded to 2 GB yet.
B008HTJLF6,23,0,I am still figuring things out about the phone but overall I really do like it.
B008HTJLF6,23,1,for first time smart phone user this is easy to useand enough screen size for manipulate apps and internet.
B008HTJLF6,23,2,On the hardware, the screen is crisp and the user interface is intuitive through ICS.
B008HTJLF6,23,3,good for first time smart phone user.
B008HTJLF6,23,4,S3 is intuitive, simple to use.
B008HTJLF6,23,5,I received it set the phone up the same day easy conversion from my Droid X; I used the My Backup Pro app to convert applications and data.
B008HTJLF6,23,6,It never lags or makes me wait for anything.Call quality- I am shocked that some have complained about the call quality because I have experienced very good call quality.
B008HTJLF6,23,7,S III Outstanding easy step-up and fast.
B008HTJLF6,23,8,The SIII is also an unusually large phone, but it is intended to be a content consumption device, although its size may be a deterrent for some.
B008HTJLF6,23,9,I got this phone from amazon over two weeks ago.Arrival:It arrived within just 2 days.Aesthetic: It looks really amazing the stupid picture on amazon doesn't do it justice at all.Performance: omg wow.
B008HTJLF6,23,10,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,23,11,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,23,12,Coming from BB Bold user, I can't be happier.
B008HTJLF6,23,13,Setting up is a breeze.
B008HTJLF6,23,14,DONT read the one-star reviews, those people are just moping about a dumb issue...I'll explain.
B008HTJLF6,23,15,Very pleased with my device.
B008HTJLF6,23,16,Took some very nice pictures at a wedding.Con - Button placement redux (see Major 1 above).
B008HTJLF6,23,17,Sometimes I can get around this by continuously doing it and eventually getting the notification window to slide down but most of the time I cannot.The 8MP camera is fairly good quality.
B008HTJLF6,23,18,Notwithstanding other reviews here, I found the actual design and form factor of the phone to be a positive.As for the software, I have no complaints.
B008HTJLF6,23,19,The Motorola Droid camera was so slow that it made capturing unique moments nearly impossible.
B008HTJLF6,23,20,ABSOLUTELY GALAMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS DEVICE IS ALWSUM JUST TO SAY THE LEAST.
B008HTJLF6,23,21,In fact, the more I use the phone, the more I like it.
B008HTJLF6,23,22,I've had mine for about a year, and it has really never given me any problems.
B008HTJLF6,23,23,Every time my finger gets to the top bar it turns off, when i lift my finger away from the phone it turns back on.
B008HTJLF6,23,24,In the month that I've had it I've gotten so used to it that now when I pick up my iPod touch, my immediate reaction is, "why did they design this screen so small?"
B008HTJLF6,24,0,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,24,1,The power button is located on the right side of the phone near the top, and a volume rocker is located on the left side near the top.
B008HTJLF6,24,2,The only downside is that the lock button is on the right side of the phone directly across from the volume toggle button that also controls the ringer volume/vibrate/silent status and not on the top of the phone.
B008HTJLF6,24,3,I'm hitting the volume keys on the left far too often when turning on/off the phone.
B008HTJLF6,24,4,There is a home button on the front of the screen near the bottom on the center.
B008HTJLF6,24,5,In fact, one night I forgot to plug it in to recharge and there was still battery the next morning - 20%.I too was not liking the power switch on the right until I got a case, so holding the case I no longer press and hold the volume button, turning the volume all the way down.I too was not liking the power connector at the bottom, but have gotten used to it.
B008HTJLF6,24,6,This placement has caused me to unintentionally change the ringer status while trying to lock the phone given how I hold the phone.
B008HTJLF6,24,7,There is an option to have 'noise reduction' turned on/off and there is also an option for extra volume turned on/off while on a call.Another complaint I have is when I am on the phone and need to do something like text message I will hit the 'home' key located in the middle of phone on the bottom.
B008HTJLF6,24,8,I like having a dedicated menu button and the lack of such hardware-based menu button on the iPhone made it a frustrating experience for me.
B008HTJLF6,24,9,My only complaint is when I turn my phone on silent or vibrate it does NOT silent the alarms set.
B008HTJLF6,24,10,For some reason I can't seem to figure out how to customize the phone screen so that when I choose the phone button it just goes to RECENT CALLS first.
B008HTJLF6,24,11,And on my Palm Pre Plus, to delete things, you dragged them to the side of the screen.
B008HTJLF6,24,12,On this phone, if you do that in the call list, you call the person (or text them if you drag left).
B008HTJLF6,24,13,Every time my finger gets to the top bar it turns off, when i lift my finger away from the phone it turns back on.
B008HTJLF6,24,14,It's VERY frustrating because normally I cannot go back and do anything with the call until they hang up and end the call.
B008HTJLF6,24,15,Could just be personal preference as I'm used to the power button on top on the Droid.
B008HTJLF6,24,16,I always thought that if there was a dock for my phone it should set upright, so the power connector should be at the bottom.
B008HTJLF6,24,17,Unfortunately when I go to slide down the notification window so I can get back to my call my phone locks up and turns off.
B008HTJLF6,24,18,Very natural to place your left thumb there in landscape mode.
B008HTJLF6,24,19,I asked many people to take pictures for me, and they invariably hit the volume button by accident which operates the digital zoom.
B008HTJLF6,24,20,One small complaint is the battery cover: you have to somewhat pry it off starting with a little slip on top center of the phone.
B008HTJLF6,24,21,Wish the power button was on the top, it would make it easier.
B008HTJLF6,24,22,In the month that I've had it I've gotten so used to it that now when I pick up my iPod touch, my immediate reaction is, "why did they design this screen so small?"
B008HTJLF6,24,23,When I press the answer button the call connects but the phone sound does not come through the car phone speaker.
B008HTJLF6,24,24,Changing the photo from a negative, sepia, black and white, cartoonified, washed out, show just yellow, just red, just blue, and just green, solarize, posterize, and warm and soft vintage.
B008HTJLF6,25,0,It's VERY frustrating because normally I cannot go back and do anything with the call until they hang up and end the call.
B008HTJLF6,25,1,VZ wanted twice as much and would have required a plan change.
B008HTJLF6,25,2,It will put the 'call screen' down and I can go to my home screen and do what I need to do.
B008HTJLF6,25,3,I read emails throughout the day, calls, texts, occasional game, just everyday use.
B008HTJLF6,25,4,I can usually spend a total of 8 hours total with non-stop internet use (Facebook, Twitter, browser, etc) and get down to about a 30% battery.
B008HTJLF6,25,5,Updated another phone on my VZ plan.
B008HTJLF6,25,6,On this phone, if you do that in the call list, you call the person (or text them if you drag left).
B008HTJLF6,25,7,Straight out of the box it's easily accessible.You need a google account to set up your phone when you first turn it on.
B008HTJLF6,25,8,My only complaint is when I turn my phone on silent or vibrate it does NOT silent the alarms set.
B008HTJLF6,25,9,Onboard apps--Verizon's tools like backup wifi detection always turn on and interupt what I'm doing.
B008HTJLF6,25,10,DONT read the one-star reviews, those people are just moping about a dumb issue...I'll explain.
B008HTJLF6,25,11,It takes roughly 2-3 full hours to charge the battery from 5% to full charge.
B008HTJLF6,25,12,I can work this phone hard, I mean constant youtube videos, some games, taking pictures, making some phone calls and stuff, and doing some e-mails (4 email accounts).. even though I don't sync but 6 minutes on every hour.
B008HTJLF6,25,13,I for one, was just tired of waiting and this device was the last one to allow me my unlimited data.If you have questions, ask.
B008HTJLF6,25,14,I'm a Words with Friends addict (forgive me, but it's the only game I play), and it uses an Internet connection almost all day.
B008HTJLF6,25,15,Camera is perfect and it has quite a powerful flash.If you are an android lover as I am you'll love this phone.I have had it overheat a time or 2 while taking lots and lots of pictures for a long time.
B008HTJLF6,25,16,I am not a phone gamer so the battery lasts about 10-12 hours with moderate, everyday use and taking pictures.
B008HTJLF6,25,17,I am on 150 MB family share plan.
B008HTJLF6,25,18,The camera is sweet too, and I like having burst mode.Oh, and its a phone too, and the calls are clear on both ends.
B008HTJLF6,25,19,It's a very easy to navigate phone.
B008HTJLF6,25,20,Google account will hold all in the information about all the apps you download, your number, and much more.If you set up Facebook to your phone it will give you the option to sync your friends list with your contact list.
B008HTJLF6,25,21,It usually takes all day for my battery to go down.
B008HTJLF6,25,22,For a family of 4 would you rather buy everyone $800 in total iphone 5's or $4 in this amazing phone?Even Best Buy wants $200 for 4 phones...$200 vs $800 and the GS3 does more stuff.
B008HTJLF6,25,23,I get about 7 or so hours and still at %50 battery, give or take.
B008HTJLF6,25,24,If you want to crop or edit your photos you will need to download a different app though because nothing comes with the phone to do this.The battery life is decent.
