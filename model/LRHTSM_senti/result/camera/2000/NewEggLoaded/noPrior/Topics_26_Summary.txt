I fiddled with the menus and took about 100 pictures and the battery retained less than about 30% of capacity.All in all, I was sorely tempted to keep this camera only for the superb images it produced but it would be silly for me to have one camera for "good" pictures and another camera for "features."	-4.911

This happens using a (spare) battery used in the NEX-5.	-4.743
