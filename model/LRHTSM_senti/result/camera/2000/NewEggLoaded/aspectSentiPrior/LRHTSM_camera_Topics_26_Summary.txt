B005IHAIMA,0,0,Wasabi batteries  that I ordered are working too.
B005IHAIMA,0,1,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,0,2,This should be equated into the total cost of ownership if a viewfinder is important to the consumer.The battery life seems good for now.
B005IHAIMA,0,3,This needs to be corrected!!! Also, Sony's new thing with their cameras is that they will ONLY take a Sony battery.
B005IHAIMA,0,4,I LOVE that you can see what percentage of battery you have remaining.
B005IHAIMA,0,5,Possibly small ones.Battery life is pretty weak.
B005IHAIMA,0,6,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,0,7,No more guessing and losing the perfect shot (happened so many times!) because 1/4 remaining battery equates to 2 percent!This is the first time that the auto modes actually work for me.
B005IHAIMA,0,8,If travelling or needing to use the camera for extended periods, then I suggest purchasing a back-up battery pack.
B005IHAIMA,0,9,I must have mistaken this feature from some other camera I was researching.At this time, the only real negative I can find is the battery door.
B005IHAIMA,0,10,Not exactly efficient, but at least the menus are not hard to navigate or use.The Bad:Battery life - Perhaps I am spoiled, but when I go out for a whole day of shooting pictures and video, I expect the battery to last the whole day.
B005IHAIMA,0,11,The only thing I did not like about the ordering experience is a representative called shortly after I placed my order online to try and sell an extra off-brand battery and memory card.
B005IHAIMA,0,12,I love taking photos of the kiddies/family throughout the year.
B005IHAIMA,0,13,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,0,14,Before I venture out, the pack is fully charged and after a 45 minute school function I will be left with about 78 percent.
B005IHAIMA,0,15,Not a good feeling after paying full price 699$.
B005IHAIMA,0,16,Photos great, video sucks.
B005IHAIMA,0,17,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,0,18,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,0,19,The small size isn't a bad thing for me because I have medium sized hands and the camera was reasonably easy to grip with my right hand.A really nice feature of this camera is the tilt-able touch-screen.
B005IHAIMA,0,20,I have taken a very long time to write a review and I suspect that even now I will not be able to fully express all that this camera can accomplish under the proper hand.
B005IHAIMA,0,21,Also, I can change a lot of the settings that on regular point and shoots I couldn't change i.e. how long the picture review stays on.
B005IHAIMA,0,22,Still, it is a good quality lens that I am happy using, though at a higher price point (5r, natch) I might grumble more about the slowness/sharpness.I found the grip on the camera and the general feel to be good and had no problems in this area.The screen is pretty good in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,0,23,I'm returning the camera to day to Best Buy.DO THE RIGHT THING SONY, RECALL YOUR DEFECTIVE CAMERA!DO THE RIGHT THING BEST BUY, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!DO THE RIGHT THING AMAZON, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!
B005IHAIMA,0,24,The camera is going back to Amazon and it will be a long long while I will ever consider Sony again...
B005IHAIMA,1,0,Tap the screen to focus during movie (haven't tried it for photo--haven't tried it because touch screen so new to me on a camera).
B005IHAIMA,1,1,I recommend getting a screen protector.
B005IHAIMA,1,2,Also the screen is susceptible to scratches.
B005IHAIMA,1,3,It has a great lcd screen and the best of any of the mirrorless cameras I have tried.
B005IHAIMA,1,4,Pictures and video do look great, and I love the way it handles.
B005IHAIMA,1,5,The touch screen is nice that wasn't in NEX-5, and so with NEX-5N you can operate the mode dials or touch the screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,6,I like that you can adjust the screen for above/below views.
B005IHAIMA,1,7,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,8,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,1,9,Great deal on a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,10,I like the user interface and the touch screen is a nice addition.
B005IHAIMA,1,11,It is a quirky camera but the more you use it and get use to it the more you will love it.
B005IHAIMA,1,12,I like the fact that there is an on screen explanation for what a function does.
B005IHAIMA,1,13,Nice in bright light and the tilt feature helps even more.Focus peaking makes it easier to manual focus.
B005IHAIMA,1,14,High quality, continuous focus, and really fun to use.Build quality - This tiny body with tilting touch lcd screen can survive a fall from about 3 or 4 feet high and land flat on the screen and be okay.
B005IHAIMA,1,15,In fact, I love it even though it's kind of a gimmick.The so-so:Screen tilt - It barely tilts enough to be of any real use to me.
B005IHAIMA,1,16,great camera, but it has one problem that is fatal, the flash design is flawed.
B005IHAIMA,1,17,It does the job,but it can be frustrating when you are in a hurry to take that GREAT picture.There is a feature that I really love: the focus aid highlights in a bright red the areas of the frame that are in focus, so you can concentrate on framing the picture, and not come out with a blurry take.
B005IHAIMA,1,18,Can be scratched easily as with all this new touch screen tech out here.
B005IHAIMA,1,19,Initially, I was impressed with the thought of a touch screen camera because I am a Smartphone user and have grown to love touch screens, but after testing I really prefer not to use it on this camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,20,Love the images and the size.
B005IHAIMA,1,21,It flips up and out away from the camera body so you can hold it at waist or chest height or above your head and still have a perfect view of the screen (45 degrees down/80 degrees up).
B005IHAIMA,1,22,So far I am loving it.
B005IHAIMA,1,23,you can resolve this issue by removing the sticker behind the LCD screen and extending out the LCD screen so the camera can cool faster but that will void your warranty.
B005IHAIMA,1,24,This camera really does a nice job and the end result is much better than my trusty P&S.;I took this opportunity to test most of the functions on the camera and found that I really had no use for the touch screen.
B005IHAIMA,2,0,You can put the focus precisely where you want it, which is great when shooting wide-open.
B005IHAIMA,2,1,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,2,2,The 5 is a wonderful little camera and what makes it a winner for me is the amazing image quality.
B005IHAIMA,2,3,The touchsceen is nice and the Auto mode is excellent.I have the kit lens and the 55-210.
B005IHAIMA,2,4,I am upgraded from the M43 and I would say I am very satisfied with it.
B005IHAIMA,2,5,A view finder, which is lacking, would be a great help.The stabilization is not as good as on the Panasonic FZ150 and I find that with the Sony, my videos are pretty "wobbly."
B005IHAIMA,2,6,Compare it to your best Canon DSLR and see who wins.
B005IHAIMA,2,7,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,2,8,Both very nice.
B005IHAIMA,2,9,This makes manually focusing a lens a breeze and very quick, not to mention fun.
B005IHAIMA,2,10,It's almost a return to cameras of the past with their split-screen viewfinders and MF-only lenses.
B005IHAIMA,2,11,I don't find having the flash and viewfinder or mic (both purchased separately) being separate to be an issue.
B005IHAIMA,2,12,It focuses fast enough though there has been a time or two af has failed me.
B005IHAIMA,2,13,There is no camera in the world that's perfect, so I can certainly find some negatives.
B005IHAIMA,2,14,The tm700 has a better stabalizer, not much, and focuses faster, again minor but noticeable.
B005IHAIMA,2,15,The new firmware upgrade makes the Nex series much easier to navagate.
B005IHAIMA,2,16,I own a Canon 5DMKII and this camera produces images that compare with the results I get from the big Canon... highly recommended...
B005IHAIMA,2,17,Fortunately Sony has addressed the issue with a fix and I feel they did it promptly and as well as they could.
B005IHAIMA,2,18,You can purchase a viewfinder for it.
B005IHAIMA,2,19,Love what it can do but not perfect.
B005IHAIMA,2,20,I feel better having done that.
B005IHAIMA,2,21,I got better results with iAuto or Scene modes than w PASM.
B005IHAIMA,2,22,I have a Canon T2i and find the sharpness to be on a par with that.
B005IHAIMA,2,23,It's a very solid camera with very good picture quality and the kit lens is quite nice as well.
B005IHAIMA,2,24,It is a quirky camera but the more you use it and get use to it the more you will love it.
B005IHAIMA,3,0,Sony customer service doesn't have a great track record, but I am willing to be surprised.I already had recommended the camera to several friends.Not any more.
B005IHAIMA,3,1,TBH, Sony customer service was very good and they paid for shipping.
B005IHAIMA,3,2,I call back and Im told that I am already in line to get a call from a Tech.
B005IHAIMA,3,3,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,3,4,Who knows, and at this point, who cares.After one more call to Sony, they said they would have a technician call me, but so far, no one has called.
B005IHAIMA,3,5,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,6,FURTHER UPDATE  ***After dodging my calls, I finally gave up on Sony support.
B005IHAIMA,3,7,UPDATE 01/16/2012  ***This is an excellent camera when it comes to picture quality, so in the end, I did end up going through the Sony "support" program to get my "improvement" for the camera rather than returning it for a refund.
B005IHAIMA,3,8,I call Sony Service and reference the email about the expedited return and repair as well as my original repair #.
B005IHAIMA,3,9,I am told the person that emailed me is out of the office for X amount of time and that a new Tech would contact me.
B005IHAIMA,3,10,I phoned Sony and they informed me that the shutter sound that the camera makes cannot be turned off!
B005IHAIMA,3,11,I offer to provide links to two videos that exhibit the problem.
B005IHAIMA,3,12,Amazon was very good to me when I had to return once before (no strings), but if I had to do this now for clicking or suspicion, I'll have to pay for return shipment to Cameta.
B005IHAIMA,3,13,I know about the problem before I ordered but thought that the odds are very low.
B005IHAIMA,3,14,Great image quality but try before you buy.
B005IHAIMA,3,15,Oh, I almost forgot to mention that the Tamron lenses (if purchased from an authorized seller) have a 6 year warranty...not that you would ever need to collect on this, but Sony's 1 year warranty is a pathetic attempt at best.ORDERI ordered the NEX-5N (body only) from 42photo.com because they had the best price and what I thought was a decent track record.
B005IHAIMA,3,16,Great build and image quality really enjoyable shutter sound :) , annoying external flash the connector feels like it might break so it better to leave the flash always connected to the camera IMHO.
B005IHAIMA,3,17,There is an audio clicking problem for this new camera in video mode...
B005IHAIMA,3,18,Audio clicking problem in video mode.
B005IHAIMA,3,19,Again they do call but not when Im available, but do leave a voicemail that I should call back.
B005IHAIMA,3,20,This Sony is really a fine camera that will satisfy most of your needs... My complaints with the camera are, the LCD panel is not hinged as is the Panasonic G3, which gives you the best ability to take advantage of composing a photo and then storing the panel when not in use, to insure it remains damage free, and there is no socket to connect a external studio flash...  Sony really hit the ball out of the park with the thought and design of the focus assist features, for the user who desires to use their old 35mm camera lenses..
B005IHAIMA,3,21,(:I finally decided to get the Sony NEX 5N due to its size and positive reviews on the web.
B005IHAIMA,3,22,Like most reviewers said, the IQ is so so so so, well let me say it, not "PRIME" quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,23,A great camera for photographing, but not for video recording.
B005IHAIMA,3,24,But, instead, the children heard that first click (then continuously hear the clicks)and turn and look at me instead of doing what they were doing that I wanted to take a photo of.
B005IHAIMA,4,0,Great pictures from a compact camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,1,I have only used it once but it was at night outside and the pictures where amazing.
B005IHAIMA,4,2,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,4,3,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,4,The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.
B005IHAIMA,4,5,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,4,6,I was surprised at the way the pictures came out.
B005IHAIMA,4,7,Great deal on a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,8,You can put the focus precisely where you want it, which is great when shooting wide-open.
B005IHAIMA,4,9,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.
B005IHAIMA,4,10,For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,11,Almost Great.
B005IHAIMA,4,12,That's great for the panoramic mode, HDR mode, or sports.The gimmicks - Yes, the art filters, hdr mode, panoramic mode, and tilting toucnscreen are fun.
B005IHAIMA,4,13,Pictures and video do look great, and I love the way it handles.
B005IHAIMA,4,14,This is the only scene mode I use.Good feature set and manual controls - P/A/S/M - allows me to control my shots when doing more than casual snap shots.Touchscreen interface, once familiarized, is easy to use.Cons:Contrast detect AF struggles in very low light / night shots.
B005IHAIMA,4,15,Nice in bright light and the tilt feature helps even more.Focus peaking makes it easier to manual focus.
B005IHAIMA,4,16,I manual focus when I do landscape work and it makes it easy to use my M mount lenses.Cons would be.
B005IHAIMA,4,17,I got better results with iAuto or Scene modes than w PASM.
B005IHAIMA,4,18,I was never able to figure out how I was doing this, but it happened enough times that I started to learn to check the exposure compensation setting if my pictures looked like they came out too dark in a light setting that should have been fine.
B005IHAIMA,4,19,If I can use it effectively (and all my pics have come out GREAT I must say) then most anyone could.
B005IHAIMA,4,20,There are effects in fully auto mode that I love.
B005IHAIMA,4,21,The include flash...is a flash.
B005IHAIMA,4,22,It takes amazingly clear action shots.
B005IHAIMA,4,23,This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings.
B005IHAIMA,4,24,The "auto" mode actually works fairly well for general use, but you'll want to learn manual mode to create exactly what you want.
B005IHAIMA,5,0,(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,5,1,The images are superb, the start up time and shooting speed are fast!
B005IHAIMA,5,2,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,5,3,The grandchildren will be playing nicely together and I want a candid shot of them and with the super fast continuous I could take several photos of them.
B005IHAIMA,5,4,The most important for me is that it does not have a mode that in I can shoot in RAW while having a minimum shutter of at least, say, 1/125s for shooting my kids activities.
B005IHAIMA,5,5,Yes, beautiful photos, fast continuous shooting.
B005IHAIMA,5,6,I can set the aperture to the minimum with Auto ISO but then the camera will favor something like 1/60s.)
B005IHAIMA,5,7,So, I cannot takes photos at weddings with this camera, I cannot take photos at sports events (Golf mainly) with this camera and cannot take photos of my grandchildren with this camera.
B005IHAIMA,5,8,This is especially frustrating with ISO given that one of the best features of this camera is its ISO capabilities.4.
B005IHAIMA,5,9,The shutter response is nice and fast, and in burst mode can shoot a lot a photos in just a few seconds.I really like how much smaller an lighter this camera is.
B005IHAIMA,5,10,Sony shutter sound obnoxious.
B005IHAIMA,5,11,I'd wager that a good 20% of shots will be missed by anyone using this camera until they learn how to compensate for this issue by using a higher ISO than should be needed or using the shutter priority setting or whatever else.
B005IHAIMA,5,12,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,5,13,There is no lag whatsoever from when the shutter is pressed and released!
B005IHAIMA,5,14,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.
B005IHAIMA,5,15,No aperture control ring - its tedious to change F-Stops and Shutter speed simultaneously through the control ring - also the previews of the aperture change is not as accurate as even a lower-end DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,5,16,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,5,17,But with the Sony it a crap-shoot.The shutter is extremely loud.The camera takes a bit too long to start up.
B005IHAIMA,5,18,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,5,19,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,5,20,Photos taken in Program Auto, Aperture Priority and Shutter Priority are pretty nice and you have a wide variety of creative effects to use to improve your photos.The camera does have many frustrating limitations.
B005IHAIMA,5,21,I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2.
B005IHAIMA,5,22,AF also appears to be too slow for taking pics of action.Overall given it's compactness I think it's great: it's just nowhere close to a decent DSLR for shooting pics of moving kids.
B005IHAIMA,5,23,Very good camera for what it does but frustrating limitations.
B005IHAIMA,5,24,On top of that the camera has no AutoISO in full manual mode and AutoISO is limited to 100-3200.On a DSLR this is less of a problem since it's very quick to switch between A/S modes when the lighting changes.
B005IHAIMA,6,0,The include flash...is a flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,1,The camera is so good with low light that I almost never use the flash, but because the flash comes with a little plastic case that attaches right to the camera strap, the flash is always handy if needed.The bottom line:  I LOVE this camera, and though the menu is cumbersome I'd still buy it again because the low light capabilities are awesome.
B005IHAIMA,6,2,You can buy third-party adapters, but those look a little unstable for mounting a big flash unit to the camera.
B005IHAIMA,6,3,Still, the flash quirk aside, this is a great camera for traveling or walking around.
B005IHAIMA,6,4,A STEAL!!Buy it, get yourself a lens hood, some lens filters, the new holga effect lenses, or the awesome sony lenses, a 4G SD card (takes up to 800 shots all you need trust me), a carrying case for it (recommend Case Logic SLRC-205), the flash, and the viewfinder if you feel you'll need them.Cant be used with photoshop out of the box, but check the web, there are downloads to get around that type of thing.
B005IHAIMA,6,5,Glad i bought it.I paid $623 on EBAY and mine came with a 18/55MM Lens, flash, a small SONY tote bag, 4GB SD Card, and charger/battery.
B005IHAIMA,6,6,I was not able to attach the flash at all and it kept breaking the contact, consequently the flash would not fire.
B005IHAIMA,6,7,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,6,8,You can put the focus precisely where you want it, which is great when shooting wide-open.
B005IHAIMA,6,9,I inserted the memory card into my laptop and was able to confirm that the images turned out good.
B005IHAIMA,6,10,We have not attached the flash so I cannot review its effectiveness.
B005IHAIMA,6,11,I used a SDHC Class 10 16GB card and have had wonderful results.Highly recommend to any individual that wants to slowly step up to a DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,6,12,I do very little direct flash lighting, so it's not something I would use much.I have ordered the optional flash, which has bounce options.
B005IHAIMA,6,13,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,6,14,The LA-EA2 was unboxed first and it came in a really nice semi-hard padded & zippered case.
B005IHAIMA,6,15,Sony does sell a larger flash compatible with the NEX-3 and -5 series, which is quite a bit bigger than the included kit flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,16,I was pretty much shooting blind; luckily my images came out without any glaring issues.
B005IHAIMA,6,17,It packed with 16.1MP APS-C sensor, can record full 1080p 60p/24p, full manual control, 10fps, touch screen, picture effects, fast start up time, super quiet and fast focus....and so on.Reason why I give it a 4 star instead of 5:I wish the body is a little wider taller than the lensNo standard hotshoeNo built in flash (It would be nice to make a camera a little wider and taller with built-in popup flash)No built in EVF (I careless about this because it will make the camera cost more, but its nice to implemented without to increase the price) :)No AF/MF button on the 18-55mm kit lensNo in-body Image Stabilizer like the Alpha Series (Why not SONY?
B005IHAIMA,6,18,great camera, but it has one problem that is fatal, the flash design is flawed.
B005IHAIMA,6,19,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,6,20,The following items were included along with the camera: warranty card, paper manual for the NEX-3/NEX-3C/NEX-5/NEX-5C, software disk, neck strap, usb cable, battery and charger and flash accessory with its respectable case.FIRST IMPRESSIONSI knew this camera was going to be small and compact, but when I took it out of its protective bag, it was even smaller than I anticipated.
B005IHAIMA,6,21,Well built and nicely designed.
B005IHAIMA,6,22,the screw that secures the attachment of the flash to the top of the camera battery is inaccessible to those that have big fingers!
B005IHAIMA,6,23,I also found that the flash unit tends to hang up on the door over the hot shoe which makes it difficult to install in dim light, which of course is when one needs the flash, but this is a minor quibble.
B005IHAIMA,6,24,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,7,0,If you wnat a small package and great quality this is it.
B005IHAIMA,7,1,I also have a Canon G11 (which I love)This is a great in between a DSLR and a POcket cam.
B005IHAIMA,7,2,Both very nice.
B005IHAIMA,7,3,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,7,4,I am loving the pictures I'm getting of my children.
B005IHAIMA,7,5,I seemed to take better pictures overall even though it was slightly larger.
B005IHAIMA,7,6,I used this for well over year now, a lot, and I think it's great.
B005IHAIMA,7,7,I love the quality of DSLRs but have felt that the size of the camera prevents me from taking it with me everywhere, essentially missing out a lot of great photos.
B005IHAIMA,7,8,Compare it to your best Canon DSLR and see who wins.
B005IHAIMA,7,9,With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.
B005IHAIMA,7,10,It is nice and compact.
B005IHAIMA,7,11,Only took 250 shots so far.
B005IHAIMA,7,12,So close to greatness... First, I would like to note that I have owned digital cameras since 1999 including compacts, midsize and DSLRs.
B005IHAIMA,7,13,I wanted something I could still fit in my purse and this is just on the larger side of fitting, but it still does.
B005IHAIMA,7,14,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,7,15,It makes a great travel camera.
B005IHAIMA,7,16,Pictures and video do look great, and I love the way it handles.
B005IHAIMA,7,17,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,7,18,I love the design and features.
B005IHAIMA,7,19,Great pictures from a compact camera.
B005IHAIMA,7,20,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,7,21,Much lighter and smaller than a DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,7,22,Overall I think it is a very nice design.The video appears to be good too.
B005IHAIMA,7,23,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,7,24,I love taking photos of the kiddies/family throughout the year.
B005IHAIMA,8,0,I'm okay with the kit lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,1,A 14mm lens would equal 28mm on a full frame.
B005IHAIMA,8,2,For a kit lens, I am impressed.
B005IHAIMA,8,3,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.
B005IHAIMA,8,4,Other lenses are available, but not a lot.
B005IHAIMA,8,5,Both Tamron lenses cost less than the Sony 16-50mm lens and according to the reviews the difference in IQ, CA, distortion and vignetting was negligible!
B005IHAIMA,8,6,Some more small prime lenses would help us a lot.
B005IHAIMA,8,7,Lens is SILVER not BLACK!!
B005IHAIMA,8,8,The camera is great.
B005IHAIMA,8,9,I have taken to it pretty quick, and have also programmed the custom button settings to my liking.The kit lens seems on par to most kit lenses.
B005IHAIMA,8,10,I am an advanced amateur photograper, and use Nikon DSLR with a bag full of lenses and accessories.
B005IHAIMA,8,11,camera shipped with kit lens attached to the body, so NO rear lens cap and NO body cap are supplied.
B005IHAIMA,8,12,While browsing for a new camera in Seoul, I was unsatisfied with every camera/price I found until I came across a used white Sony NEX 5n with the 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 lens for about $200 less than a new model.
B005IHAIMA,8,13,My current dslr is full frame, and I wanted a little more reach, yet I wanted to avoid having too much lens distortion on the wide end.
B005IHAIMA,8,14,The lens looks like it is hulking out and the hand grip, while useful, isn't pretty.
B005IHAIMA,8,15,Great deal on a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,8,16,But the Amazon ad for the camera and lens combo for the BLACK body shows it with a matching BLACK 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,17,If you wear cargo pants you might want a 30mm lens instead  (such as the Sigma 30mm f/2.9) as your first prime lens,A linear polarizer filter, note: circular polarizers are no advantage on mirrorless cameras and linear ones are cheaper.
B005IHAIMA,8,18,none exist for the Sony E-mount lenes for now and none in the future roadmap sadly, the only small sony lens that exist is the 16mm F2.8 but it's too wide for a main lens for most people and it's not as sharp as i like until stopped down so not very friendly to use at night, the Panasonic 20mm F1.7 is great lens (not the best but for Size/performance it's great) if you want a pancake zoom? this might sound crazy but Panasonic is making a Pancake zoom lens with image stabilization too and so on,While it seems in theory that Sony can just release smaller lenses and win the best of both worlds, it doesn't seems like this is a concern for Sony right now, their 2012 lenses road map include 3 more huge zoom lenses and zero prime let alone a pancake lenses, the Sony upcoming 50mm F1.8 OSS while being very sharp from the samples i have seen (sharper than nikon/canon 50mm primes) it's actually BIGGER than both nikon and canon 50mm lenses for their DSLR which is puzzling to create a tiny body and never release tiny lenses for it at least as an option for those who rather use smaller lenses, Sony Officially unlocked their E-Mount to other lenses companies though so anyone can make Native E mount lens if they want, i only knows of Sigma upcoming E-Mount lens which is 30mm F2.8 small primeSo in short again depends on your use you might prefer m43 because of lenses choices over NEX, i can't get rid of m43 because wide shots is a MUST for me and none is available for sony as of now.About Samsung Mirrorless system, while the sensor size is the same as sony it's not as good as sony sensor (not even close) Samsung support is nowhere near sony or M43 too so I'm not interested in itFor manual lenses users NEX offer the best possibilities for you, you can adapt almost every lens using an adapter for manual focus lenses, using the Focus peaking/zoom functions make focusing a breeze and easy, the Offset microlenses is a huge bonus too, and lets not forget the crop factor (1.5X for NEX versus 2X for M43)Overall i recommend NEX 5n for anyone, it's hard to find anything similar in the market for the price right now (Amazing sensor/small camera/tilt LCD/shoots 1080p60 video/touchscreen/easy to use/etc), it does beat any Entry/mid range nikon/canon DSLR "IF" you are type of a person who just sticks to the zoom kit lens, NEX 5N got a better zoom Kit lens and the better sensor.I hope my thoughts about the mirrorless market for now was fair enough and i hope that my review was helpful :)
B005IHAIMA,8,19,They both have pretty good reviews from professionals and consumers and should offer better IQ than standard kit lenses.
B005IHAIMA,8,20,Until Sigma came out with their 30mm lens for the NEX system (Sigma 30mm F2.8 EX DN- Sony E 330965), I wasn't interested in the system.
B005IHAIMA,8,21,I got bored of carrying around a big DSLR with lenses, cases, filters and all, so I decided to go slimmer and lighter with a mirrorless from Sony.
B005IHAIMA,8,22,To combat this, you need to hold the adapter or lens with your left hand.
B005IHAIMA,8,23,It's a very solid camera with very good picture quality and the kit lens is quite nice as well.
B005IHAIMA,8,24,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,9,0,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,9,1,The image quality of the 5n is amazing.
B005IHAIMA,9,2,Great image quality but try before you buy.
B005IHAIMA,9,3,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,9,4,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,9,5,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,6,Low noise at high iso as well.
B005IHAIMA,9,7,It's a very solid camera with very good picture quality and the kit lens is quite nice as well.
B005IHAIMA,9,8,Performance is great, colors, low light, ISO, WB, dynamic range and picture quality are all solid.
B005IHAIMA,9,9,Also, it is very light in weight which helps.The color accuracy is very good.
B005IHAIMA,9,10,Nice image quality; poor autofocus.
B005IHAIMA,9,11,FANTASTIC for low light, such as in restaurants.
B005IHAIMA,9,12,I desperately want to love this camera based on its image and video quality alone.
B005IHAIMA,9,13,Build quality is excellent.
B005IHAIMA,9,14,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.
B005IHAIMA,9,15,I am not a photographer, just a picture taker who appreciates good image quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,16,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,9,17,It is a good street/travel camera.
B005IHAIMA,9,18,It's quite good for what it is.
B005IHAIMA,9,19,Love the images and the size.
B005IHAIMA,9,20,(It should be no surprise that I love the image quality.)
B005IHAIMA,9,21,Good.
B005IHAIMA,9,22,The 5 is a wonderful little camera and what makes it a winner for me is the amazing image quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,23,I own a Canon 5DMKII and this camera produces images that compare with the results I get from the big Canon... highly recommended...
B005IHAIMA,9,24,This was in an office with artificial lighting.
B005IHAIMA,10,0,I am loving the pictures I'm getting of my children.
B005IHAIMA,10,1,Great deal on a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,10,2,I used this for well over year now, a lot, and I think it's great.
B005IHAIMA,10,3,Its been 2 years since I bought it and it still takes perfect pictures.
B005IHAIMA,10,4,Excellent camera for the price.
B005IHAIMA,10,5,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,10,6,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,10,7,I love this camera.
B005IHAIMA,10,8,I seemed to take better pictures overall even though it was slightly larger.
B005IHAIMA,10,9,I reviewed this camera to the Nikon 1 J1 and ultimately went with this camera instead.
B005IHAIMA,10,10,Solid Camera at Great Price.
B005IHAIMA,10,11,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,10,12,If I can use it effectively (and all my pics have come out GREAT I must say) then most anyone could.
B005IHAIMA,10,13,I bought this camera about a year and a half ago.
B005IHAIMA,10,14,I have returned the product.
B005IHAIMA,10,15,I bought the first one just before a trip to Japan, and during the first week of the trip it just died for no apparent reason.
B005IHAIMA,10,16,All in all an excellent camera for the price, but if spending a few hundred more (OK, several hundred more) for a camera doesn't bother you I would consider the NEX-7.
B005IHAIMA,10,17,Smart move.I say buy it, I was on the fence about this camera for about three months of debating wheter to spend the money or buy the Nikon V1 (which i still will buy good camera) or wait until they get cheaper, which is already happening.
B005IHAIMA,10,18,You can bet that when I buy another camera, it will be from Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,10,19,Almost Great.
B005IHAIMA,10,20,For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,10,21,I've been a point and shoot girl up til now but I decided to buy the Sony to start getting more into photography.
B005IHAIMA,10,22,If you wnat a small package and great quality this is it.
B005IHAIMA,10,23,Nice camera - better than expected.
B005IHAIMA,10,24,Still, you can get great shots at extremely low light with amazing color that was just not possible at this price range until now.The kit lens is good and much better than I expected based upon some of the reviews I read.
B005IHAIMA,11,0,Great pictures from a compact camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,1,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,11,2,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,11,3,Took amazing pics and easy to use.
B005IHAIMA,11,4,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,5,I am most certainly a novice photographer and this camera is a great stepping stone for me.So far I am liking the photo quality I have seen come out of it.
B005IHAIMA,11,6,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,11,7,Takes great pics.
B005IHAIMA,11,8,The image quality is excellent, the controls are good, as is the touch base menu system.
B005IHAIMA,11,9,For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,10,90 degrees up is a godsend for a variety of situations.THE NEUTRAL:The menu system takes a bit of getting used to, but once learned, is fairly easy to navigate.
B005IHAIMA,11,11,It is a good street/travel camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,12,It's quite good for what it is.
B005IHAIMA,11,13,It is nice and compact.
B005IHAIMA,11,14,The user interface is cumbersome and not for everyone.
B005IHAIMA,11,15,If I can use it effectively (and all my pics have come out GREAT I must say) then most anyone could.
B005IHAIMA,11,16,Excellent photos...
B005IHAIMA,11,17,Pictures and video do look great, and I love the way it handles.
B005IHAIMA,11,18,There is much to learn about all of the features which I haven't done yet, but am hopeful I can master.
B005IHAIMA,11,19,I do like to think of myself as an armature, and I am trying to learn more photography so I chose this camera to go with me.Pro: I live the small size of the body (not the lens--more on that later); I like that I can have either full control in manual vs other modes.
B005IHAIMA,11,20,I like the user interface and the touch screen is a nice addition.
B005IHAIMA,11,21,With a quick button push and Sony's well thought out basic controls, I can quickly get to and change the settings I most often access.
B005IHAIMA,11,22,Great image quality but try before you buy.
B005IHAIMA,11,23,I didnt even get a users manual with mine and it only took me 20minutes to go through all the menus and adjust settings to my liking.
B005IHAIMA,11,24,Digging in and really learning the ins and outs of the camera is part of the fun for me.
B005IHAIMA,12,0,Sony camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,1,A great camera for photographing, but not for video recording.
B005IHAIMA,12,2,Takes great pics.
B005IHAIMA,12,3,will Sony do?
B005IHAIMA,12,4,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,12,5,If I can use it effectively (and all my pics have come out GREAT I must say) then most anyone could.
B005IHAIMA,12,6,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,12,7,Great cam for taking videos and having always around.
B005IHAIMA,12,8,In Sept. 2011, Sony has release an official statement that Sony will provide some video recording improvement for those affected NEX5Ns.(What
B005IHAIMA,12,9,The camera is great.
B005IHAIMA,12,10,I love the camera as a photo camera, but waited for this NEX over the previous (NEX-5) specifically for a better video capability - which it has...But...
B005IHAIMA,12,11,camera also overheats pretty easily when you're recording video.
B005IHAIMA,12,12,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,12,13,Too bad because the camera itself is great.
B005IHAIMA,12,14,Atleast this is ok ) when i saw the camera, i didnt see any sony stickers to it(One for the APS-C sensor and other for the LCD screen), because when i looked for "NEX-5N unboxing" videos in youtube, i saw those sony stickers in the video.
B005IHAIMA,12,15,Sony fails with NEX-5N, video with click out of the box.
B005IHAIMA,12,16,I love this camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,17,Amazing Camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,18,Its best feature is the HD video with exceptionally good audio quality, but if your intention is to shoot long videos DON'T, as the camera will OVERHEAT and automatically shut down after about 15 minutes of operation.
B005IHAIMA,12,19,The video is also amazing, but it's only flaw is that is seems to overheat if the video runs continuously for longer than 4-5 minutes.
B005IHAIMA,12,20,It also takes great pics and especially videos.But there are also a couple of flaws which spoil the overall experience.1.
B005IHAIMA,12,21,My conclusion is that the noise is likely not as pronounced in some models or some buyers may not be as concerned because they love the good quality pics it takes.I myself am leaning more towards keeping the 1st NEX-5N from Amazon since the camera seems to work well and I likely won't record videos as much.
B005IHAIMA,12,22,Overall I think it is a very nice design.The video appears to be good too.
B005IHAIMA,12,23,I haven't used it for video yet so I can't comment on that.
B005IHAIMA,12,24,I was surprised at the way the pictures came out.
B005IHAIMA,13,0,This happens using a (spare) battery used in the NEX-5.
B005IHAIMA,13,1,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,13,2,I had sent it in November to Precision camera for repairs and the work order showed that they had done some repair on LCD then.
B005IHAIMA,13,3,The representative assured me that I would have to ship the camera at my expense but it would be repaired and send back at no charge.
B005IHAIMA,13,4,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,13,5,Not exactly efficient, but at least the menus are not hard to navigate or use.The Bad:Battery life - Perhaps I am spoiled, but when I go out for a whole day of shooting pictures and video, I expect the battery to last the whole day.
B005IHAIMA,13,6,I figured the battery was dead, so I threw it on the charger.
B005IHAIMA,13,7,Battery lasts for a while.
B005IHAIMA,13,8,Luckily, I bought an extra battery as back up and that solves it.
B005IHAIMA,13,9,The camera was fine for two months.
B005IHAIMA,13,10,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.
B005IHAIMA,13,11,It works, but it's very harsh and does not cover the image all that evenly and has a very short range.
B005IHAIMA,13,12,I did not have time to confirm this.FIRST USEOnce the battery was fully charged, I reinstalled it into the camera and attached the 50mm E-Mount lens (SEL50F18).
B005IHAIMA,13,13,I have had NEX 5 for a year and half now and I thank myself for buying an extended warranty.
B005IHAIMA,13,14,The camera has inconsistent problem of getting locked up when shooting.
B005IHAIMA,13,15,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.
B005IHAIMA,13,16,A series of Sony Viao laptops drained their batteries even when the computer was off because there was a design failure and the battery circuit could not be closed.
B005IHAIMA,13,17,However there are a few downsides:* The video button is in a very unfortunate place and cannot be disabled, so I have drained my battery a couple of times by accidentally capturing 20 minutes of video of the inside of my bag.*
B005IHAIMA,13,18,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,13,19,This suck because it's otherwise a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,13,20,The battery door on the other cameras I've owned never had any sort of movement when closed.INITIAL START UPI slipped the battery and a 16GB SanDisk Extreme memory card into the camera (SDSDX-016G-X46).
B005IHAIMA,13,21,But the camera error message came back on while I was on vacation.
B005IHAIMA,13,22,I have to send my unit for 5-7 days and it's only going out ground (unless you make a huge stink like I did to get overnight).
B005IHAIMA,13,23,This is REALLY disappointing and as much as I wanted to buy this camera, I will not and do not recommend to do so.
B005IHAIMA,13,24,Pictures and video do look great, and I love the way it handles.
B005IHAIMA,14,0,;-)* The screen is very hard to use in direct sunlight.
B005IHAIMA,14,1,You can customize 3 of the buttons on the back of the camera, and that helps tremendously, but there are still several things I wish were more readily available without fumbling through the menu.There is no viewfinder so you must frame your photos using the LCD screen, which can be difficult in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,14,2,I like that you can adjust the screen for above/below views.
B005IHAIMA,14,3,The screen turns blue and flashes 'camera error'.
B005IHAIMA,14,4,No self portraits here.The screen brightness is pretty dim in sunlight unless you opt for a "sunny weather" setting which then becomes way too bright when you are inside.
B005IHAIMA,14,5,The camera does even have a single scratch on the body or the screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,6,However you can always see it enough to frame the image.*
B005IHAIMA,14,7,Then one summer day last week, while taking some family photos, I touched the square on the touch screen to fix focus on my kid's face and the screen instantly developed a crack on the inside.Called Sony and explained the issue.
B005IHAIMA,14,8,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,14,9,Tap the screen to focus during movie (haven't tried it for photo--haven't tried it because touch screen so new to me on a camera).
B005IHAIMA,14,10,This is the camera I've been looking for for a long time.My camera does not suffer from the "clicking sound" some have trouble with during video shooting.Due to its very small size, there isn't room for a lot of buttons and dials, so most of the camera's settings have to be reached via a rather cumbersome on screen menu.
B005IHAIMA,14,11,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.
B005IHAIMA,14,12,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,14,13,Touchscreen cracked just by touching while trying to focus the object.
B005IHAIMA,14,14,camera also overheats pretty easily when you're recording video.
B005IHAIMA,14,15,i was absolutely looking forward to this camera because it has a touch screen & 1080p recording.
B005IHAIMA,14,16,The kit flash is pretty bad.
B005IHAIMA,14,17,Just crossing my fingers.
B005IHAIMA,14,18,If you buy the viewfinder then you cannot use the enclosed flash while the viewfinder is in use.
B005IHAIMA,14,19,Also the screen is susceptible to scratches.
B005IHAIMA,14,20,It is long, complicated (for me at least) and difficult to read with my tired old eyes.
B005IHAIMA,14,21,I had sent it in November to Precision camera for repairs and the work order showed that they had done some repair on LCD then.
B005IHAIMA,14,22,too bad sony screwed up the video recording.
B005IHAIMA,14,23,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,14,24,Onto colors: It has been a joy shooting images where the colors pop out of the screen!
B005IHAIMA,15,0,The camera has inconsistent problem of getting locked up when shooting.
B005IHAIMA,15,1,If you buy the viewfinder then you cannot use the enclosed flash while the viewfinder is in use.
B005IHAIMA,15,2,No built in viewfinder - you can buy one for $250 extra but I don't want to spend $250 on a viewfinder - a viewfinder and an extra lens take this camera up to 7N territory in cost which has a lot more than just the viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,15,3,In time its shortcomings (primarily slow repeat shooting and poor autofocus) came to really bug me and I've moved on to better cameras.
B005IHAIMA,15,4,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,15,5,I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2.
B005IHAIMA,15,6,The heft increases as you add the lens and a viewfinder if necessary.
B005IHAIMA,15,7,Here are improvements over the NEX-5 (although at times the autofocus still tends to be picky on the subject, which is normal--any camera does this when a close tree or plant is the focus instead of getting a clear shot of a distant building, for example)... (Two other cons will be mentioned.)Pros:-
B005IHAIMA,15,8,Update : Changed rating to 4 stars instead of 5, Original review remain below, So why i did that?
B005IHAIMA,15,9,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.
B005IHAIMA,15,10,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.
B005IHAIMA,15,11,On top of that the camera has no AutoISO in full manual mode and AutoISO is limited to 100-3200.On a DSLR this is less of a problem since it's very quick to switch between A/S modes when the lighting changes.
B005IHAIMA,15,12,This can be improved by adjusting the brightness setting, or for $300+ you can purchase an add-on electronic viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,15,13,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,15,14,I am not sure if it is one or the other, but sometimes it seems the AF is a little bit off.
B005IHAIMA,15,15,The following are the big problems:1.
B005IHAIMA,15,16,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,15,17,Even with the 18-55mm lens it doesn't feel bad.
B005IHAIMA,15,18,If you are going from a straight point and shoot or even a model like the Nikon P100 then you will find my review helpful.
B005IHAIMA,15,19,The first time I noticed it the iso was 3200.
B005IHAIMA,15,20,It does the job,but it can be frustrating when you are in a hurry to take that GREAT picture.There is a feature that I really love: the focus aid highlights in a bright red the areas of the frame that are in focus, so you can concentrate on framing the picture, and not come out with a blurry take.
B005IHAIMA,15,21,The same shot with 800 iso had no trace of the spots.
B005IHAIMA,15,22,I have a Canon T2i and find the sharpness to be on a par with that.
B005IHAIMA,15,23,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,15,24,The other seeming defect is that I've noticed spots in the frame when the background, also indoors, is tan/orange/yellow.
B005IHAIMA,16,0,Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012.
B005IHAIMA,16,1,Still Clicking Sound.
B005IHAIMA,16,2,There is an audio clicking problem for this new camera in video mode...
B005IHAIMA,16,3,Audio clicking problem in video mode.
B005IHAIMA,16,4,My first was returned before being aware of the Service Call issued by Sony for the clicking issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,5,Video defect is not the only problem.
B005IHAIMA,16,6,The clicking is still an issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,7,Defective after Sony Repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,8,Who knows, and at this point, who cares.After one more call to Sony, they said they would have a technician call me, but so far, no one has called.
B005IHAIMA,16,9,I call back and Im told that I am already in line to get a call from a Tech.
B005IHAIMA,16,10,My revised rating and review is based off the poor experience with Sony Technical Support and the repair of the issue.I contacted Sony Service using the repair number of my Service Call repair, after receiving my "repaired" 5n and noticing the new sound issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,11,I call Sony Service and reference the email about the expedited return and repair as well as my original repair #.
B005IHAIMA,16,12,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,16,13,Still clicks.
B005IHAIMA,16,14,Sony is finally acknowledging the problem just not saying what it is and if the fix will completely fix the problem.
B005IHAIMA,16,15,I offer to provide links to two videos that exhibit the problem.
B005IHAIMA,16,16,I just called Sony and they confirmed that the issue is still there and that customers need to send their $700 cameras if they find the clicking issue.I asked them whether they can tell me a way to figure out whether the issue is still present but they said they cannot.
B005IHAIMA,16,17,Finally I contacted Sony support and they told me that the camera had to be sent in for repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,18,I thought SONY has fixed the clicking noise problem in the most recent product.
B005IHAIMA,16,19,I respond with information about lens used and what I have noticed as well as a link to a video that exhibits the problem.The next day notice a missed call but no voicemail.
B005IHAIMA,16,20,Still has the click noise when shooting video.
B005IHAIMA,16,21,It clicks!
B005IHAIMA,16,22,M. F. Click issue is a big problem for this product.
B005IHAIMA,16,23,What's going on with Sony?
B005IHAIMA,16,24,too bad sony screwed up the video recording.
B005IHAIMA,17,0,No auto ISR on Manual mode (some DSLR's will let you do this).Overall,
B005IHAIMA,17,1,I can set the aperture to the minimum with Auto ISO but then the camera will favor something like 1/60s.)
B005IHAIMA,17,2,The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.
B005IHAIMA,17,3,With the NEX-5N, I have to press Menu, scroll to Shoot Mode, scroll from iAuto to Program mode, press Menu again (because selecting another shooting mode kicks you out), select the Brightness/Color menu, scroll to DRO/Auto HDR option and select Auto HDR (or other DRO/HDR mode).
B005IHAIMA,17,4,I have the 18-55mm and 55-210mm lenses.PROS* Sony's Focus Peaking feature makes manual focus really easy for manual first-timers like me.
B005IHAIMA,17,5,With the Canon S95 point-and-shoot, I can switch from Auto to Scene mode through the mode dial and then select HDR option (if I left it in HDR mode then I don't even have to scroll and I've switched to HDR mode in the flick of a dial).
B005IHAIMA,17,6,As someone who usually shoots in aperture priority or manual mode, I'm used to making all the exposure decisions for my photos.
B005IHAIMA,17,7,On top of that the camera has no AutoISO in full manual mode and AutoISO is limited to 100-3200.On a DSLR this is less of a problem since it's very quick to switch between A/S modes when the lighting changes.
B005IHAIMA,17,8,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,17,9,The touch focusing and focus tracking are wonderful.One other thing that surprised me is how useful the intelligent auto setting has turned out.
B005IHAIMA,17,10,In DSLRs switching to manual mode opens up a whole set of opportunities and challenges as with this camera but M mode on this camera is a pain.
B005IHAIMA,17,11,I'd wager that a good 20% of shots will be missed by anyone using this camera until they learn how to compensate for this issue by using a higher ISO than should be needed or using the shutter priority setting or whatever else.
B005IHAIMA,17,12,Also, I can change a lot of the settings that on regular point and shoots I couldn't change i.e. how long the picture review stays on.
B005IHAIMA,17,13,I was never able to figure out how I was doing this, but it happened enough times that I started to learn to check the exposure compensation setting if my pictures looked like they came out too dark in a light setting that should have been fine.
B005IHAIMA,17,14,Switching modes is requires several button pressesLowlight auto focusing slow and very unreliableTouchscreen interface nearly useless.
B005IHAIMA,17,15,Plus, even in the program mode or intelligent auto you can make adjustments to the picture (you can adjust shutter speed by telling the thumb wheel).
B005IHAIMA,17,16,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,17,17,When the light gets dim, I switch back to aperture priority and control the ISO settings.
B005IHAIMA,17,18,Changing some of the settings involves diving into menus (ISO, HDR, etc).
B005IHAIMA,17,19,No dial mode.
B005IHAIMA,17,20,(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,17,21,The most important for me is that it does not have a mode that in I can shoot in RAW while having a minimum shutter of at least, say, 1/125s for shooting my kids activities.
B005IHAIMA,17,22,The intelligent auto setting doesn't understand tripods.Low light is another area where I've been pleased.
B005IHAIMA,17,23,For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,17,24,I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2.
B005IHAIMA,18,0,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,18,1,There is no lag whatsoever from when the shutter is pressed and released!
B005IHAIMA,18,2,They both involve the screen flickering about 1/2 second after you turn the camera off under different circumstances.
B005IHAIMA,18,3,I also noticed the same exact spots when is happened to use iso 100 and 1 second shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,4,Very small lag on the shutter.
B005IHAIMA,18,5,The first time I noticed it the iso was 3200.
B005IHAIMA,18,6,The same shot with 800 iso had no trace of the spots.
B005IHAIMA,18,7,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,18,8,Charging took about 4 hours (which is normal) and then the camera fired right up.You will be prompted to set the date & time right away and then you can start enjoying your new toy.When you turn the camera off, the shutter may operate.
B005IHAIMA,18,9,The spots appeared several times more at iso 3200 in the exact same location in the frame and changing between 18-55 kit lens and f2.8/16 didn't effect the outcome.
B005IHAIMA,18,10,My Nikon did not have that ability and it is such a picture saver when it comes to action scenes or the kids not sitting still.
B005IHAIMA,18,11,This becomes annoying at times.
B005IHAIMA,18,12,So, I cannot takes photos at weddings with this camera, I cannot take photos at sports events (Golf mainly) with this camera and cannot take photos of my grandchildren with this camera.
B005IHAIMA,18,13,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,18,14,(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,15,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,18,16,To combat this, you need to hold the adapter or lens with your left hand.
B005IHAIMA,18,17,This is untrue, of course, as the clicking problem occurs if you move the camera at all during video recording.
B005IHAIMA,18,18,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,18,19,Good job at high ISO (low light).Con:
B005IHAIMA,18,20,It can take 5 steps or more to reach the desired location or certain function.
B005IHAIMA,18,21,I am told that over time, one adapts to this button placement.Several people have complained about the video feature recording a clicking sound and I can confirm that this is the case.
B005IHAIMA,18,22,I am not a photographer, just a picture taker who appreciates good image quality.
B005IHAIMA,18,23,The biggest use I have for it right now is as a landscape ready device, while out with my wildlife gear, allowing me to avoid carrying extra lenses or a second DSLR.Learn more.
B005IHAIMA,18,24,This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings.
B005IHAIMA,19,0,No Sequential Ordering for Video Files!!!
B005IHAIMA,19,1,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,19,2,Don't buy this camera.
B005IHAIMA,19,3,That drives me up the wall, but Sony's proprietary crap is a whooole other story, and this is a photo camera first, not primarily for video.No hot shoe - Not a huge deal for me, but once again Sony proprietary connections forces you to buy their flashes if you want other flash options.Missed AF/Softness - This is sort of a common issue with these cameras.
B005IHAIMA,19,4,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.
B005IHAIMA,19,5,Seriously Sony, make those lazy developers that "work" for you fix it.
B005IHAIMA,19,6,You can buy third-party adapters, but those look a little unstable for mounting a big flash unit to the camera.
B005IHAIMA,19,7,Now please Sony, just put a better hinge on the LCD panel and a PC socket, so I can use it with a studio flash, this camera really deserves a five star rating... but the lack of flash connector and the limited hinge on the LCD panel are the big failures of the camera.. ....
B005IHAIMA,19,8,All other situations require better options, and only the overpriced Sony proprietary crap external mic is available because of their weird attachment.
B005IHAIMA,19,9,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,19,10,Pictures and video do look great, and I love the way it handles.
B005IHAIMA,19,11,I do very little direct flash lighting, so it's not something I would use much.I have ordered the optional flash, which has bounce options.
B005IHAIMA,19,12,The Sony proprietary connections are pretty annoying, along with the focus issue, and it is not the prettiest camera (I would rate it 3.5 stars honestly because of these factors).
B005IHAIMA,19,13,Don't just get carried away with a slightly bigger sensor and ignore the full package.Finally, all above things aside, the picture quality and some features like HDR/DRO, Panaroma, etc. are good.
B005IHAIMA,19,14,I don't find having the flash and viewfinder or mic (both purchased separately) being separate to be an issue.
B005IHAIMA,19,15,The include flash...is a flash.
B005IHAIMA,19,16,camera also overheats pretty easily when you're recording video.
B005IHAIMA,19,17,I own a Canon 5DMKII and this camera produces images that compare with the results I get from the big Canon... highly recommended...
B005IHAIMA,19,18,The camera is so good with low light that I almost never use the flash, but because the flash comes with a little plastic case that attaches right to the camera strap, the flash is always handy if needed.The bottom line:  I LOVE this camera, and though the menu is cumbersome I'd still buy it again because the low light capabilities are awesome.
B005IHAIMA,19,19,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,19,20,However, the battery that gives this error on the camera had a bit of plastic near the connection terminals chipped off, but this shouldn't matter.)-
B005IHAIMA,19,21,You buy a $600 camera and the stupid developers can't even implement sequential file numbers for video files--only photos.
B005IHAIMA,19,22,Attaching/swapping a mic or a flash requires quite long and annoying process.4.
B005IHAIMA,19,23,No built in viewfinder - you can buy one for $250 extra but I don't want to spend $250 on a viewfinder - a viewfinder and an extra lens take this camera up to 7N territory in cost which has a lot more than just the viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,19,24,This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings.
B005IHAIMA,20,0,With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.
B005IHAIMA,20,1,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,20,2,Thanks Sony, you make me look like a better photographer than I am!
B005IHAIMA,20,3,I do see that these lenses are far better and truly stabilize on even the furthest zoom, where the aforementioned would have shake in the image.The camera is 95 percent menu driven and accessed by the touchscreen.
B005IHAIMA,20,4,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,20,5,It is something to get used to though because you can no longer just stick it in your pocket or small purse.
B005IHAIMA,20,6,I can confirm it still has the click problem if you try to record video even moving the camera a little bit.I am not a pro,but I took identical pics w/ the 5n and the Canon T1s, the Canon pics definitely seemed to have more pop with both on auto.
B005IHAIMA,20,7,This was an upgrade from a Nikon P100 model.
B005IHAIMA,20,8,I purchased this outfit (w/18-55mm) as a "walk about" replacement for my standard SLR.
B005IHAIMA,20,9,The image quality would not disappoint even the professional.
B005IHAIMA,20,10,With the 200mm lens it becomes a bit front-end heavy and collapses on its face.
B005IHAIMA,20,11,It's a very solid camera with very good picture quality and the kit lens is quite nice as well.
B005IHAIMA,20,12,I was pretty much shooting blind; luckily my images came out without any glaring issues.
B005IHAIMA,20,13,I've been a point and shoot girl up til now but I decided to buy the Sony to start getting more into photography.
B005IHAIMA,20,14,I am a long time Canon DSLR owner, my current being a T1i, and a small selection of lenses.
B005IHAIMA,20,15,I am reluctant to use this camera for what I had intended and probably will sell, or trade it for the Lumix.
B005IHAIMA,20,16,When the Sony came around I still wasn't confident enough even though it isn't a true DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,20,17,Its been 2 years since I bought it and it still takes perfect pictures.
B005IHAIMA,20,18,Still Clickin' I just bought this camera last week (Aug 1).
B005IHAIMA,20,19,Great image quality but try before you buy.
B005IHAIMA,20,20,At the end of the day it will all be forgotten as you are awed by the images taken with your hands.
B005IHAIMA,20,21,So close to greatness... First, I would like to note that I have owned digital cameras since 1999 including compacts, midsize and DSLRs.
B005IHAIMA,20,22,You can consider this camera if1) You have shot P&S; for long time and want better image quality (Sony or otherwise, a bigger sensor will get u better IQ)2) You know the power of DLSR particularly from Canon or Nikon, but your are willing to forgo that "demanding or assumed" expectations from a DSLR for the sake of compactness (if not portable)3) You are content with kit lens4) You are willing to pay an extra premium, again, for a sleek small sized cameraNow I took off 2 stars for this1) Mine clicks,clicks,clicks.
B005IHAIMA,20,23,Although I do have some previous knoweledge and experience with DSLR cameras both digital and film.
B005IHAIMA,20,24,BACKGROUND & RESEARCHI've owned Pentax, Nikon and Panasonic P&S; cameras and a Canon DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,21,0,I wish the lens cap had a leash.
B005IHAIMA,21,1,Not exactly portable/pocket with the kit lens attached--you may have to get the 16mm pancake lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,2,I also bought 16mm lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,3,It could be also that the N has lens correction.
B005IHAIMA,21,4,As of this review, the following are the available E-Mount lenses for purchase:16mm (SEL16F28); 24mm Zeiss (SEL25F18Z); 30mm Macro (SEL30M35; 50mm (SEL50F18); 18-55mm (SEL1855); 55-210mm (SEL55210); 18-200mm (SEL18200 & SEL18200LE); Sigma 19mm (400965); Sigma 30mm (330965); Tamron 18-200mm (AFB011-700 & AFB011S-700); Kenko 400mm (KE4008K4); Various fisheye lenses from Bower, Rokinon, Samyang, YasuharaSony is scheduled to release the following lenses within the next few months: 35mm (SEL35F18); 10-18mm (SEL1018); 16-50mm (SELP1650)My plan was to purchase the Sony 16-50mm (SAL1650) and the Sony 55-200mm (SAL55200-2) lenses, but the only problem was the 16-50mm lens is $800 new and the used ones on eBay were not offered by reputable sellers (BTW, the 55-200mm was going to be a temporary lens until I saved enough money for a Sony 70-300mm or 70-400mm G lens).Since the purchase of the 16-50mm lens, 55-200mm lens and LA-EA2 adapter would have set me back well over $1,000 I decided to do some more research for alternative lenses and ended up purchasing the Tamron 17-50mm (AF016M700) and the Tamron 70-300 (AFA005S-700).At first, I could not confirm that these lenses would work with the adapter, but was able to locate examples of people who had successfully paired these lenses with the adapter and NEX-5N camera.Also, at the time of purchase, Tamron offered a $75 MIR on the 17-50mm lens and a $100 MIR on the 70-300mm lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,5,I cleaned the lens and sensor, but the spots remained.
B005IHAIMA,21,6,The Camera box was already opened.
B005IHAIMA,21,7,You should have no problem trying to get "that shot" if this adapter is part of your system.PRACTICALITYI would assume that the average user who purchased this camera with the 18-55mm lens (and possibly the 55-210mm lens) would not be disappointed.
B005IHAIMA,21,8,I was a little surprised to see that the product box I received was for a NEX-5N with a double lens kit (16mm & 18-55mm).
B005IHAIMA,21,9,It's a great camera with many of the same features as the NEX-5N and is about the same size and weight (if the adapter and lens was connected to the NEX-5N).
B005IHAIMA,21,10,Body Only: $600Tamron 17-50mm: $425 (after $75 rebate)Tamron 70-300mm: $350 (after $100 rebate)Total: $1,375.00CONCLUSIONNeedless to say, I ended up returning the NEX-5N, 50mm lens and adapter.
B005IHAIMA,21,11,The spots were more definite when the lens I was using was stopped down below f10.
B005IHAIMA,21,12,If you like NEX-5, then... Having used Sony NEX-5 since May (2011), I was turned off by the drawbacks with the 18-55mm kit lens, mainly the barrel distortion and chromatic aberration.
B005IHAIMA,21,13,I was under the impression that the NEX-5N body only was offered from Sony in its respectable box and not one that was separated from the kit lenses.
B005IHAIMA,21,14,I tested with kit lens taking the same photos in both auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,21,15,Both Tamron lenses cost less than the Sony 16-50mm lens and according to the reviews the difference in IQ, CA, distortion and vignetting was negligible!
B005IHAIMA,21,16,camera shipped with kit lens attached to the body, so NO rear lens cap and NO body cap are supplied.
B005IHAIMA,21,17,I got the NEX-5N with 18-55mm lens, in 2 days with Amazon prime.
B005IHAIMA,21,18,Doesn't have Art filters and due for firmware update, if and when available (if I wanted to do artistic effects, use NEX-5 for that)For the battery and (still) quirky autofocus (hint--I bought the body only because the kit lens from the NEX-5 on the NEX-5N saved me $100, and so could you, if you don't plan to buy another lens at the time), this camera given 4 out of 5 stars.
B005IHAIMA,21,19,A dust cap was placed over the sensor opening for shipment, but otherwise, as far as I can tell nothing was done to it.
B005IHAIMA,21,20,To combat this, you need to hold the adapter or lens with your left hand.
B005IHAIMA,21,21,And if you were using a larger lens (like the 70-300) taking your hand from the adapter to the lens could present a problem because you need to be 100% confident in your grip with your right hand since the camera is now front heavy.LA-EA2 PERFORMANCEAll the people that reviewed this adapter were not kidding when they said this thing offers exceptionally fast AF performance.
B005IHAIMA,21,22,The clicking problem persists and I'm not sure the camera case was even opened.
B005IHAIMA,21,23,So far this camera delivers.The cons will be that there are not many lenses available and they are steep in price.
B005IHAIMA,21,24,I did not have time to confirm this.FIRST USEOnce the battery was fully charged, I reinstalled it into the camera and attached the 50mm E-Mount lens (SEL50F18).
B005IHAIMA,22,0,Other than that, it is a great camera especially in low light.
B005IHAIMA,22,1,It's very strongest plus is the high ISO image quality.
B005IHAIMA,22,2,Low noise at high iso as well.
B005IHAIMA,22,3,Good for still photo.
B005IHAIMA,22,4,The image quality of the 5n is amazing.
B005IHAIMA,22,5,This was in an office with artificial lighting.
B005IHAIMA,22,6,Great image quality but try before you buy.
B005IHAIMA,22,7,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,22,8,For instance, a standard outdoor shot will show great color and detail throughout the image, from the pavement to the sky.
B005IHAIMA,22,9,Good job at high ISO (low light).Con:
B005IHAIMA,22,10,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,22,11,Still, you can get great shots at extremely low light with amazing color that was just not possible at this price range until now.The kit lens is good and much better than I expected based upon some of the reviews I read.
B005IHAIMA,22,12,Also, it is very light in weight which helps.The color accuracy is very good.
B005IHAIMA,22,13,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,22,14,Photos great, video sucks.
B005IHAIMA,22,15,I've taken inside shots at night with minimal ambient light, handheld with no flash at ISO setting 25,600 and they turned out very clear with minimal graininess.
B005IHAIMA,22,16,Still, it is a good quality lens that I am happy using, though at a higher price point (5r, natch) I might grumble more about the slowness/sharpness.I found the grip on the camera and the general feel to be good and had no problems in this area.The screen is pretty good in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,22,17,The first time I noticed it the iso was 3200.
B005IHAIMA,22,18,Performance is great, colors, low light, ISO, WB, dynamic range and picture quality are all solid.
B005IHAIMA,22,19,Non traditional hot shoe so I can't fire a wireless flash, quirky navagation, can't focus well in extreme low light, noisy shutter and self timer, dail on the back is easy to nudge a knock your settings off.Pros, amazing image quality and almost no noise up to and including 6400iso.
B005IHAIMA,22,20,It takes startlingly great photos even in low light with no flash.Unfortunately mine still has the clicking noise issue when recording video.
B005IHAIMA,22,21,The color saturation is incredible even at high ISOs.
B005IHAIMA,22,22,That has turned out to be a good lens that gives me some of the compact size and image quality that I felt was lacking.
B005IHAIMA,22,23,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.
B005IHAIMA,22,24,I am not a photographer, just a picture taker who appreciates good image quality.
B005IHAIMA,23,0,Too bad I have to return it to Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.
B005IHAIMA,23,2,You can bet that when I buy another camera, it will be from Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,3,So when I asked for a 3rd replacement they said the policy is 2 tries then refund so I'll be returning both after all.
B005IHAIMA,23,4,I bought the Canon T3i and returned, Sony A65 and returned again.
B005IHAIMA,23,5,Still Clickin' I just bought this camera last week (Aug 1).
B005IHAIMA,23,6,They went out of their way to discuss this problem with me and immediately refunded my purchase.___________________________________________________________________________________________I
B005IHAIMA,23,7,Why the still sell this camera ???Don't buy it !
B005IHAIMA,23,8,Amazon was very good to me when I had to return once before (no strings), but if I had to do this now for clicking or suspicion, I'll have to pay for return shipment to Cameta.
B005IHAIMA,23,9,Do NOT BUY - DEFECTIVE.
B005IHAIMA,23,10,I'm returning the camera to day to Best Buy.DO THE RIGHT THING SONY, RECALL YOUR DEFECTIVE CAMERA!DO THE RIGHT THING BEST BUY, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!DO THE RIGHT THING AMAZON, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!
B005IHAIMA,23,11,I dont want to play camera roulette when I want to buy a new product and waste my money and time guessing what will work.
B005IHAIMA,23,12,Why Is Amazon still selling defective models of this camera?
B005IHAIMA,23,13,I just bought it two days ago and received it today.
B005IHAIMA,23,14,I bought my NEX-5N from Amazon and it arrived promptly on 10/17/2012.
B005IHAIMA,23,15,I've been reading the reviews so one of the first things I tried was the video!
B005IHAIMA,23,16,I purchase this camera, I already tried both T3i and A65 and both of them are returned.
B005IHAIMA,23,17,But the latest one from Amazon still clicks.
B005IHAIMA,23,18,The second camera was ALSO bugged...What Amazon AND Sony doing?
B005IHAIMA,23,19,UPDATE: 21 FEB 2012: Amazon appears to be looking into this issue now - I believe they are intercepting/checking my return to verify this problem.
B005IHAIMA,23,20,Don't buy it - unless you want to return it twice - as I did.... Hi,I bought this camera once believing the CLICK BUG was fixed by Sony and that Amazon, would not sell a problematic product.Immediately after unboxing, I recorded a movie and realized that the Click Bug was affecting my unit...I returned it to Amazon.I thought: maybe i was unlucky... Let me try it again...I reordered it and guess what...
B005IHAIMA,23,21,Too bad because the camera itself is great.
B005IHAIMA,23,22,Thought you can cheat ????For all who are going to buy this product and just bought, make sure you see the "Unboxing videos" in You-tube and check you have similar packings / New product stickers.
B005IHAIMA,23,23,What's going on with Sony?
B005IHAIMA,23,24,The camera is going back to Amazon and it will be a long long while I will ever consider Sony again...
B005IHAIMA,24,0,With that being said, the touchscreen menu is rather fool/idiot-proof because there are instructions on each menu and even helpful tips on how that function would be useful.
B005IHAIMA,24,1,This wheel delves deeper into the menu option for specific functions.
B005IHAIMA,24,2,I thought maybe there was a setting in the menu to switch from PAL to NTSC, so I referenced the manual and to make a long story short, there is not a way to change this.
B005IHAIMA,24,3,It has all the power and more of some of the DSLR's you see in the entry level market.The
B005IHAIMA,24,4,What I don't like is since the menus are only accessible via the touchscreen, it is a fingerprint, sweat and dirt magnet.
B005IHAIMA,24,5,You can customize some hotkeys for quick access, but I'm finding I'd like quick access to even more stuff.
B005IHAIMA,24,6,Of course, you would need to grip this with your left hand so your right hand is free to access the controls, but unfortunately this does present a potential problem when trying to zoom or focus manually (I'll explain later).The Tamron lenses seem to be built very well (and they should be for the price).
B005IHAIMA,24,7,I work in manufacturing and completely understand when something goes wrong on a product.
B005IHAIMA,24,8,I was skeptical about loosing some physical controls , such as the PASM dial and quick dial that the fz35 had, but once you get your way around and setup the soft buttons for easy access, I don't really miss the the fz35 anymore.I was trying to decide between this or the canon t3i as well as the d5100 but they are too bulky.
B005IHAIMA,24,9,I am an amateur photographer and I was looking for a transition SLR that I could practice on w/o having to put much effort into "learning" photography.
B005IHAIMA,24,10,Amateur photographer friendly!
B005IHAIMA,24,11,I'd love more buttons and dials for quick access.
B005IHAIMA,24,12,That camera was a step up from a digital because of it's manual capabilities.
B005IHAIMA,24,13,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,24,14,This review will be very simplistic/basic in its terms because I am an amateur.
B005IHAIMA,24,15,My fingers kept returning to the 4-way control dial - which by the way was designed very well.
B005IHAIMA,24,16,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,24,17,So far the rest of the "pros" are it's easy to use- it has an onscreen information blurb that comes up when you select something; it allows for automatic or manual functionality.
B005IHAIMA,24,18,With a quick button push and Sony's well thought out basic controls, I can quickly get to and change the settings I most often access.
B005IHAIMA,24,19,I still find it rather difficult and cumbersome having to figure out which lens I am going to need for the day.
B005IHAIMA,24,20,Obviously Sony has concentrated on their electronics expertise vs. camera technology in building this unit and it requires a learning curve in order to master the (simple) yet bewildering menu system.
B005IHAIMA,24,21,You can either rotate the outer ring of the dial to move through the menu options or you can press on the dial (up, down, left, right).
B005IHAIMA,24,22,The menus aren't bad, but you have to stop shooting to play with them.
B005IHAIMA,24,23,So if you care about the aesthetics of a thing, then a black body with a silver lens with a grey flash starts to look a bit like Frankenstein's monster.Camera strap is adequate but a bit on the cheap side.No camera case is included.The menu system and camera controls are not very intuitive.
B005IHAIMA,24,24,So after I learn more about cameras and how to use manual speeds or adjustments I can but as a beginner I don't need a special class the camera just does it for me; even when my hand or the subject is moving all of the pics don't come out blurry; all of the options and possible future upgrades so I won't have to buy a whole new camera, this one can grow with me as my knowledge grows.
B005IHAIMA,25,0,I reviewed this camera to the Nikon 1 J1 and ultimately went with this camera instead.
B005IHAIMA,25,1,My next camera will probably be a Nikon or a Canon, from a company that actually takes pride in their cameras.
B005IHAIMA,25,2,This was an upgrade from a Nikon P100 model.
B005IHAIMA,25,3,Sony admitted the issue but never provided a solution.
B005IHAIMA,25,4,This is REALLY disappointing and as much as I wanted to buy this camera, I will not and do not recommend to do so.
B005IHAIMA,25,5,Hopefully, we have an updated model and won't experience that issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,6,This camera takes great photos.
B005IHAIMA,25,7,I just called Sony and they confirmed that the issue is still there and that customers need to send their $700 cameras if they find the clicking issue.I asked them whether they can tell me a way to figure out whether the issue is still present but they said they cannot.
B005IHAIMA,25,8,But no, Sony is doing nothing to fix the problem on units that haven't reached customers -- they're just playing the numbers, hoping to save money because some percentage of customers may not use the video or demand that the defect be fixed.***
B005IHAIMA,25,9,So I am planning on returning my camera if they don't acknowledge and address the issue promptly.
B005IHAIMA,25,10,I love taking photos of the kiddies/family throughout the year.
B005IHAIMA,25,11,If you are going from a straight point and shoot or even a model like the Nikon P100 then you will find my review helpful.
B005IHAIMA,25,12,Photos great, video sucks.
B005IHAIMA,25,13,And then later, when the camera was released, the company played dumb, blamed its customers, and offered a "performance improvement" to pretend that it was doing them a favor.
B005IHAIMA,25,14,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,25,15,I will revise my review when I receive my camera back.
B005IHAIMA,25,16,There is no jittering, freezing or sync issues as I've experienced with the Nikon model.
B005IHAIMA,25,17,The clicking is still an issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,18,this is one of the best cameras I ever had on image quality I sold my dsrl for this and from a normal person point of view photos are great.Video clicking is a pain in the ...I am from out USA and I can't fix it as I bought it in USA.I never thought I would have the problem with SONY.3 month waiting for the firmware upgrade that will fix the problem, no news.I miss old times SONY.Matias[...]
B005IHAIMA,25,19,I was pretty much shooting blind; luckily my images came out without any glaring issues.
B005IHAIMA,25,20,So when you clean off all your video files, the numbering starts over again at 00000.MTS!
B005IHAIMA,25,21,The images and video are stunning.as of 4/1/2012New spots have appeared on the sensor.
B005IHAIMA,25,22,I hear the NEX5R and NEX6 fix most of these problems, so I plan on upgrading to one of those cameras someday (when I have money again).
B005IHAIMA,25,23,They buy expensive lenses and brag about their gear, but that means nothing if you can't use it.This camera works wonders when you learn how to use it.
B005IHAIMA,25,24,I dont want to play camera roulette when I want to buy a new product and waste my money and time guessing what will work.
B002IPHIEG,0,0,battery life5.-touch
B002IPHIEG,0,1,It did this with the battery that came with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,0,2,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,0,3,Battery life could be better.
B002IPHIEG,0,4,It's also super-portable and has an awesome battery life.
B002IPHIEG,0,5,I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.
B002IPHIEG,0,6,I used it as soon as I got the battery charged - and that, the battery, is the only thing I can say is a slight negative.
B002IPHIEG,0,7,The battery has a decent life as well.
B002IPHIEG,0,8,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,0,9,It's been in a drawer for some time now.
B002IPHIEG,0,10,As soon as the battery charged, I started using the camera.
B002IPHIEG,0,11,It is not unusual to go through two batteries in an hour or two, even when they are fully charged.
B002IPHIEG,0,12,Battery life seems pretty good.So what's not to like about this camera?1.
B002IPHIEG,0,13,It didn't last long.
B002IPHIEG,0,14,The battery lasts super long.
B002IPHIEG,0,15,If I had it to do over, I would not buy a camera with a touchscreen.One other thing--this thing eats batteries.
B002IPHIEG,0,16,Its battery charger requires only two hours.
B002IPHIEG,0,17,Battery has to be taken out and charged externally, i prefer the ones which can be charged through usb therefore allowing you to copy photos while also charging the camera.
B002IPHIEG,0,18,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,0,19,here's the things I love about the camera:1.-
B002IPHIEG,0,20,Long story short, outdoor pics were great, the camera size was excellent, and battery life was out of this world.
B002IPHIEG,0,21,We used it on our vacation to Washington DC and it and the battery would last all day.Well worth the investment.
B002IPHIEG,0,22,If only it took good pictures..
B002IPHIEG,0,23,I LOVED it from day one!
B002IPHIEG,0,24,The burst mode is decent, battery life could have been better.
B002IPHIEG,1,0,Remarkable, actually.The touch screen is easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,1,1,It also has a touch screen feature which I'm not so fond of.
B002IPHIEG,1,2,The Large LCD screen is Spectacular as is the color in the photos.
B002IPHIEG,1,3,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,1,4,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,1,5,The screen gets smudged so easily.
B002IPHIEG,1,6,Love it!
B002IPHIEG,1,7,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,1,8,A perfect sized protector will slightly overlap the screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,9,Otherwise this is a great little camera with nice features.
B002IPHIEG,1,10,Great Little Camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,11,Great indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,1,12,Took great pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,1,13,I love this camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,14,I've found that it's best to make those decisions looking at the pictures at full size on a computer screen, rather than on the camera screen -- a shot that looks washed out or too bright on the camera screen is often perfect when seen on a larger monitor.
B002IPHIEG,1,15,It takes beautiful pictures.
B002IPHIEG,1,16,It is an Awesome camera that takes beautiful clear photos!! Great Close up, Great far away!!
B002IPHIEG,1,17,I love that it doesn't have a touch screen (I don't have the patience for those) which adds to it's ease of use.
B002IPHIEG,1,18,No bevel to the LCD frame.
B002IPHIEG,1,19,Being touch screen, it is a different excitement.
B002IPHIEG,1,20,The view screen is very unforgiving and will lead you to believe your shots are more contrasty and grainy than they actually are.
B002IPHIEG,1,21,This is my first touch screen camera and I was hesitant.
B002IPHIEG,1,22,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.
B002IPHIEG,1,23,When your shots look good on the view screen, they will be even more pleasing on a correctly calibrated HD monitor.2) The white balance options never seem to look right on the view screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,24,The touch screen is very intuitive and responsive.
B002IPHIEG,2,0,If you are "technology challenged" then this camera will do all the work for you and make you look like a pro!
B002IPHIEG,2,1,The Best point and shoot for the technology challenged!
B002IPHIEG,2,2,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,2,3,Even in auto mode, the Canon took consistently good pictures, important when handing your camera to someone to shoot your picture.
B002IPHIEG,2,4,The Canon has faster glass (f/2.0),
B002IPHIEG,2,5,Good but poor autofocus.
B002IPHIEG,2,6,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,2,7,It is really hard to take bad shots with this camera, and if you take the time to learn the benefits of the various modes, I am certain you will get great results too.I was also skeptical of getting the rather narrow range of the 35mm lens, thinking I would prefer the wider lens on the WX1 when it comes out next month, but the panorama mode is awesome so I don't miss having the wider lens.
B002IPHIEG,2,8,I just want the cameras to live up to their billing!
B002IPHIEG,2,9,I just want the cameras to live up to their billing!
B002IPHIEG,2,10,You can see the result instantly!Other features worth mention is the 10FPS mode, DRO (Dynamic Range Optimizer) mode which shows better shadow and highlights, and the paint mode (add frames, and write text on pictures).
B002IPHIEG,2,11,All of the technologies work well, and are not just Sony's hype.
B002IPHIEG,2,12,Each one is better then the last.
B002IPHIEG,2,13,With 10.2 mega-pixel, you'd think it would do wonders.
B002IPHIEG,2,14,The images did not have good focus; they just weren't sharp and the color was not nearly as good as other point and shoot camera I have or am very familiar with.
B002IPHIEG,2,15,Wonderful camera.
B002IPHIEG,2,16,This is the only negative thing I can find.
B002IPHIEG,2,17,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,2,18,I wonder if point and shoot cameras like this one could do better.
B002IPHIEG,2,19,I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon.
B002IPHIEG,2,20,The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90.
B002IPHIEG,2,21,But Exmor R isn't as good as promised.
B002IPHIEG,2,22,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,2,23,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.
B002IPHIEG,2,24,If only it took good pictures..
B002IPHIEG,3,0,The mono-microphone is pretty sensitive and provides a good sound quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,1,These give me the quality I require.
B002IPHIEG,3,2,The camera has the usual for Sony good build quality and generally worked fine.
B002IPHIEG,3,3,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,3,4,Just for the record, I never experienced such a problem neither with my T100 nor with my Sony HDR-SR7 camcorder.
B002IPHIEG,3,5,I use it for my blog and the picture quality and audio are great.
B002IPHIEG,3,6,So I was looking for a small camera with a front microphone which could take good low light movie clips.The new Sony DSC-WX1 seemed perfect for these purposes so I purchased it from Amazon which delivered it very promptly.
B002IPHIEG,3,7,The quality is high for a camera in this category, and the video is more than acceptable.
B002IPHIEG,3,8,That is why for a number of years I had successively Sony DSC-T1, T30, and T100 ultra-compacts.
B002IPHIEG,3,9,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,10,I didn't realize that the camera recorded video, so I tried it and it was lower quality than a dedicated video camera, but for a backup it is very acceptable.In short, I think this camera would be great for the everyday photographer, and as a backup camera.
B002IPHIEG,3,11,perfect camera.
B002IPHIEG,3,12,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,3,13,But i tought this camera would be different compare to others.I dont understand other reviewers that they claim about the positive experience they'e had with this camera??!!
B002IPHIEG,3,14,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,3,15,We do a lot of socializing and it's nice to have something easy to record the memories.
B002IPHIEG,3,16,Although the sound is MONO compared to ZS3's Stereo, but the video quality and easy to work with editing software make up the difference!
B002IPHIEG,3,17,I did not compare the movie modes, which have similar specifications.[Appended
B002IPHIEG,3,18,This little gem is about the size of a cell phone and takes very decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,3,19,I am on my 3rd Digital Camera now.....I have had 3 Canons, and decided to stray out of my comfort zone and buy a Sony.
B002IPHIEG,3,20,It has significantly lower level and it resides mostly in the higher frequencies but unlike zooming this is audible all the time you're shooting movie and the constant presense of that creaking sound makes very unpleasant impression.
B002IPHIEG,3,21,Sony DSC-TX1 is pretty good quality, and fun to use.
B002IPHIEG,3,22,The highly technical reviewers generally praised it, but many everyday users reported problems.I decided to buy a TX1 anyway, and I'm glad I did.First the cons.
B002IPHIEG,3,23,Great customer service.
B002IPHIEG,3,24,I prefer small pocket size cameras which can take nice still photos and good movie clips.
B002IPHIEG,4,0,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,4,1,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,4,2,It auto adjust to light so you always get great pictures.
B002IPHIEG,4,3,What shots I took!
B002IPHIEG,4,4,Great low light pictures!
B002IPHIEG,4,5,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,6,This camera takes great pictures day or night!!
B002IPHIEG,4,7,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,4,8,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,9,If only it took good pictures..
B002IPHIEG,4,10,It has an anti blur mode meaning that it shoots 5 shots and blends them into one to create one great picture.
B002IPHIEG,4,11,Fortunately, P with some of the white balance settings used after experimentation will get you great shots.3)
B002IPHIEG,4,12,I'm an avid concert-goer and partier, so I needed a camera that could take great pictures in not-so-great situations.
B002IPHIEG,4,13,However, did you ever try looking at "no flash" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode?
B002IPHIEG,4,14,Good night shots.240-degree
B002IPHIEG,4,15,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,4,16,*  The pet feature is great.
B002IPHIEG,4,17,One stop shot!
B002IPHIEG,4,18,I was able totake pictures with no flash using just the ambient lightand the pictures were beautiful.
B002IPHIEG,4,19,The only thing I don't like about it so far is that it doesn't have the feature of imprinting the date on the picture automatically.
B002IPHIEG,4,20,If your looking for a quick easy point and shoot, this camera is for you.
B002IPHIEG,4,21,Even in auto mode, the Canon took consistently good pictures, important when handing your camera to someone to shoot your picture.
B002IPHIEG,4,22,I highly recommend taking picture in the P mode with white balance set to flash.
B002IPHIEG,4,23,So far, it is working great for me.
B002IPHIEG,4,24,It takes surprisingly very clear pictures in this mode as well.
B002IPHIEG,5,0,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,5,1,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,5,2,The processing time is fast, very fast.
B002IPHIEG,5,3,Shutter lag (time from pushing the shutter button until photo taken),is very low for a pocket camera.What's not so good:-Noise reduction smears details at ISO 400 and above.
B002IPHIEG,5,4,Focus is fast.
B002IPHIEG,5,5,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,5,6,Great indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,5,7,Maybe I wasn't doing it right but they didn't seem to help much.The best bet for action and fast moving subjects with this camera seems to be the burst mode, which rips off 10 shots one after another when the shutter is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,5,8,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.
B002IPHIEG,5,9,If you could control the shutter (which you can't) you might be able to get this camera to better stop action.
B002IPHIEG,5,10,The low light photos (without a flash) are incredible!
B002IPHIEG,5,11,The Sony Cyber-shot takes wonderful indoor / low light pictures with fast shutter speed.
B002IPHIEG,5,12,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,5,13,I was always impressed with their speed, size, and the great pictures I would get from them.
B002IPHIEG,5,14,This camera is the best thing since sliced bread.
B002IPHIEG,5,15,On the other hand a recent review of the upcoming S90 indicated that even with a fast lens and manual controls (allowing you to set the shutter) it wasn't fast enough for action, sports and kids.
B002IPHIEG,5,16,Blazingly fast operation.
B002IPHIEG,5,17,Excellent pictures with the right lighting.
B002IPHIEG,5,18,I want a camera that I don't know is there, that I can whip out in 2 seconds to snap off a shot.
B002IPHIEG,5,19,See for yourself: [...].What's the point of the best picture quality you missed capturing the moment because of poor shutter lag?2) Excellent battery life.
B002IPHIEG,5,20,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,5,21,The sound is also disappointing.PROS:Lots of Fun to UseGreat Low Light PerformanceSmall SizeThere is a "Pet Mode" with very short shutter lag times in shootingThe photos sharpen nicely in Photoshop.
B002IPHIEG,5,22,I just returned a different camera because the shutter lag was horrible and so was the indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,5,23,Even the low light pictures don't seem to have a noise problem.
B002IPHIEG,5,24,The zoom is difficult to use it moves to fast.
B002IPHIEG,6,0,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,6,1,Reformating memory stick is best done on computer.
B002IPHIEG,6,2,I haven't transferred them to the computer, but I don't show my pictures on my computer.
B002IPHIEG,6,3,You can upgrade your video card, but that is expensive and doesn't even work that well.
B002IPHIEG,6,4,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,6,5,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,6,6,We do a lot of socializing and it's nice to have something easy to record the memories.
B002IPHIEG,6,7,It's very easy to operate, and there is no more taking multiple pictures, then download to your computer to stitch them together!
B002IPHIEG,6,8,Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.
B002IPHIEG,6,9,The only problem with it is you NEED to by a memory card, otherwise you can only store a couple of images on the camera's internal memory.
B002IPHIEG,6,10,Although the sound is MONO compared to ZS3's Stereo, but the video quality and easy to work with editing software make up the difference!
B002IPHIEG,6,11,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,6,12,It just is TOO small.
B002IPHIEG,6,13,I finally realize that SMALL is not so good when I buy a camera.
B002IPHIEG,6,14,Use MS Windows software for downloading.Overall: I am happy with purchase.
B002IPHIEG,6,15,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,6,16,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,6,17,Still image and print quality are very important to me.
B002IPHIEG,6,18,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,6,19,One other very minor quirk is that due to the shape & size, it's very easy for your finger to make its way into the picture.
B002IPHIEG,6,20,Great camera.
B002IPHIEG,6,21,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,6,22,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.
B002IPHIEG,6,23,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,6,24,If you have had other cameras that used SD, just think of making a $20 investment into a very reliable, fast card for your camera, and use the SD card in your Wii.The only two complaints I have for this camera are it's low light picture taking, and the format it uses when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,7,0,Great Little Pocket Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,1,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,7,2,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,7,3,Great
B002IPHIEG,7,4,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,5,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,7,6,Great pocket camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,7,Very small (fits in a pocket) and very easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,7,8,I wanted a compact camera to be able to take pictures and then put it in my pocket, and this one is perfect.
B002IPHIEG,7,9,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,7,10,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,7,11,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,7,12,Best compact digital camera I've owned so far!
B002IPHIEG,7,13,Great camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,14,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,15,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,7,16,Nice Small Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,17,A great camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,18,Great Pocket Camera With A Little Tinkering.
B002IPHIEG,7,19,I was looking for better zoom while still maintaining the compact feel.
B002IPHIEG,7,20,*  The pet feature is great.
B002IPHIEG,7,21,Small camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,22,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,7,23,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,24,I wanted a small camera I could keep in my pocket for daily use.
B002IPHIEG,8,0,I believe this is due to the flash being close to the lens.In summary, DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA.
B002IPHIEG,8,1,I would like to thank my boss who pushed me to buy this 24mm wide angle lense camera.Panoramic feature is also great.
B002IPHIEG,8,2,Good Camera- 24mm wide angle is amazing.
B002IPHIEG,8,3,Lastly, from the "what were they thinking??" category, the flash is placed in a position where the lens blocks the flash from illuminating the lower left corner of the image at the wide end of the lens.
B002IPHIEG,8,4,As a former owner of a Sony A700 with 16-80mm Carl z lenses, plus a whole bag of long range lenses.
B002IPHIEG,8,5,Lens distortion is amazingly low, even at wide angle.+
B002IPHIEG,8,6,I dont think I will get back into DSLR due to the bulky, expensive, complex (think dust on your sensor from lens changing).The price of $259 is mind blowing too given all these features.
B002IPHIEG,8,7,Pictures come rounded (probably because of wide angle).3.
B002IPHIEG,8,8,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,8,9,Taking a picture with the camera turned sideways to better frame a specific shot shows a lot of distortion from the wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,8,10,Dealing with toting all that stuff around, cleaning lenses, I finally got sick of it and sold everything on eBay and bought this camera, sure the image quality will never touch the A700 DSLR but I find the joy of photography is having a camera always with you.
B002IPHIEG,8,11,I needed low light capabilities for indoor and nighttime pictures without a flash and a wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,8,12,A nice 24mm wide angle lens, which lets you get very close to things and is also great for cramped indoor settings, buildings and landscapes.
B002IPHIEG,8,13,It is not the same package of everything you have with your DSLR and collection of lenses shrunk down to something the size of a couple of packs of gum.
B002IPHIEG,8,14,If you take a picture with flash at 24mm, what is a really common use I have to say, it gets a black spot in the lower left corner.
B002IPHIEG,8,15,This camera takes great pictures in low-light and that's all about this camera's positive points.
B002IPHIEG,8,16,There is always a shadow in the lower left corner of the pictures (because of very short distance between flash and lens).2.
B002IPHIEG,8,17,Good job Sony for making this.
B002IPHIEG,8,18,If only it took good pictures..
B002IPHIEG,8,19,I was looking for better zoom while still maintaining the compact feel.
B002IPHIEG,8,20,Former DSLR owner.
B002IPHIEG,8,21,No manual controls.The W300 had full manual controls, and I wonder why Sony couldn't have included them here and really made this a top of the line point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,8,22,It does take better photos in low light, but overall picture quality for an amateur user isn't that great.
B002IPHIEG,8,23,(No kidding) The video feature is really awesome, and I believe it is better than most of the "cheap" video camera out there.
B002IPHIEG,8,24,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,0,For me, it was all about picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,1,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,9,2,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,9,3,Great low light pictures!
B002IPHIEG,9,4,It is excellent in low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,5,If only it took good pictures..
B002IPHIEG,9,6,Excellent pictures with the right lighting.
B002IPHIEG,9,7,It was NOT good at all.
B002IPHIEG,9,8,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,9,9,The low light pictures were much better then any other camera I have owned.
B002IPHIEG,9,10,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,9,11,Image quality was not what I expected.
B002IPHIEG,9,12,Picture quality is better than I have had on past cameras, and come out pretty well.
B002IPHIEG,9,13,Excellent low lighting performance.
B002IPHIEG,9,14,The big disappointmet was the bright light image quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,15,Suitable for low light only.
B002IPHIEG,9,16,The low light capability was good, but not that much better than my Sony H20.
B002IPHIEG,9,17,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,9,18,No, the quality of the photos is not in the league of the larger camera.
B002IPHIEG,9,19,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,9,20,Love the low light feature.
B002IPHIEG,9,21,Especially impressive was the low light performance.
B002IPHIEG,9,22,It delivers great pictures in every light.
B002IPHIEG,9,23,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,9,24,It can take 6 consecutive pictures at once, and stack them together to get a high detailed picture, without showing the usual grainy high iso result.
B002IPHIEG,10,0,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,10,1,You can see some of the pictures I took here.
B002IPHIEG,10,2,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,3,Great Camera for price.
B002IPHIEG,10,4,Okay, I really loved this camera and the picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,10,5,The pictures have not been altered in anyway.[...]You can buy this camera with confidence.
B002IPHIEG,10,6,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,10,7,If only it took good pictures..
B002IPHIEG,10,8,Elegant looking camera, love it!
B002IPHIEG,10,9,she loves it.
B002IPHIEG,10,10,Excellent buy for its price; a really good little camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,11,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,10,12,If you're buying it primarily for great pictures you should look at other cameras.
B002IPHIEG,10,13,For me, it was all about picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,10,14,I have had this camera for a little over a year.
B002IPHIEG,10,15,Picture quality is better than I have had on past cameras, and come out pretty well.
B002IPHIEG,10,16,Great indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,10,17,This is a great camera, Ive had it now for over a month andn it's very easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,10,18,I used it at my daughters soccer game with great success.
B002IPHIEG,10,19,not easy making a 16 year old happy, but this does it.
B002IPHIEG,10,20,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,10,21,Great camera only one thing you need to know.
B002IPHIEG,10,22,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,10,23,Great Little Camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,24,I bought this camera a little over a year ago as a Christmas present for my girlfriend.
B002IPHIEG,11,0,Great features, simple and easy to use settings.
B002IPHIEG,11,1,Easy to use2.-
B002IPHIEG,11,2,However, it is very easy to use and the instruction booklet is great.
B002IPHIEG,11,3,It is very intuitive, and easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,11,4,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,5,It has great quality picutres, easy to use, fast, etc!
B002IPHIEG,11,6,This camera doesn't take such nice pictures.
B002IPHIEG,11,7,I use a camera to take nice looking pictures.
B002IPHIEG,11,8,Really good camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,9,Great Little Camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,10,The screen is about as easy to navigate as you could ask for.
B002IPHIEG,11,11,A great camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,12,The camera is easy to use, not too many buttons that you'll never use.
B002IPHIEG,11,13,If your looking for a quick easy point and shoot, this camera is for you.
B002IPHIEG,11,14,It is also intuitive and easy to use the advanced functions without much of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,11,15,The touch screen is so easy to use and the camera fits anywhere.
B002IPHIEG,11,16,So far, it is working great for me.
B002IPHIEG,11,17,The controls are pretty intuitive and easy for an amateur like me to figure out.
B002IPHIEG,11,18,It takes pictures quickly, and the quality of the shots is usually excellent.
B002IPHIEG,11,19,It also took some very nice landscape photos outdoorsusing the simple Easy option.
B002IPHIEG,11,20,Wasn't looking for dslr quality, but something that looked  nice would be useful.
B002IPHIEG,11,21,I found it amazingly easy to use with just that little bit of reading.
B002IPHIEG,11,22,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,11,23,It also has one of the best touchscreen interfaces I've used on a camera, it's not in the way and it's easy and quick to use.
B002IPHIEG,11,24,I'm not a techno wizard, but this camera is pretty easy to use (I do suggest reading the manual because the camera has lots of cool functions) and the photo quality is great.
B002IPHIEG,12,0,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,12,1,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,12,2,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,12,3,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!
B002IPHIEG,12,4,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,12,5,Just amazing in photo and video quality..
B002IPHIEG,12,6,Oh, and the video quality is awesome as well.
B002IPHIEG,12,7,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,12,8,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,12,9,The video quality is excellent.
B002IPHIEG,12,10,720p video, great audio quality.
B002IPHIEG,12,11,Sorry Sony.
B002IPHIEG,12,12,Sorry Sony.
B002IPHIEG,12,13,Sorry Sony!
B002IPHIEG,12,14,Sorry Sony!
B002IPHIEG,12,15,I didn't see the need for it.VIDEO:
B002IPHIEG,12,16,I've owned Sony's DSC-P72, W5, W7 and W300.
B002IPHIEG,12,17,If you're buying it primarily for great pictures you should look at other cameras.
B002IPHIEG,12,18,The Panorama features, HD video, and other features make this a no brainer.
B002IPHIEG,12,19,I use it for my blog and the picture quality and audio are great.
B002IPHIEG,12,20,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,12,21,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,12,22,For me, it was all about picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,12,23,If only it took good pictures..
B002IPHIEG,12,24,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,13,0,Bought the camera and just before one year, the battery cover door broke -not due to mistreating-.
B002IPHIEG,13,1,battery cover can break in one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,2,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,3,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,13,4,The battery door is flimsy.-Hard
B002IPHIEG,13,5,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,13,6,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,13,7,Its great if you want Non-Flash photos and are frequently turning the camera off/on in between shots.BAD- Battery Cover - The battery cover seems very flimsy and bows a bit if you hold the camera by it.
B002IPHIEG,13,8,Sony repaired the damage under the warranty and not cost at all.
B002IPHIEG,13,9,Battery does not last as long as the old Sony I have (T-3 and T-30)2.
B002IPHIEG,13,10,I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.
B002IPHIEG,13,11,Had this camera for about a month now - its a fine camera and has the usual settings/functions as mentioned by others.
B002IPHIEG,13,12,I bought one about 2 months ago and have been using it a lot.
B002IPHIEG,13,13,It is not unusual to go through two batteries in an hour or two, even when they are fully charged.
B002IPHIEG,13,14,Easy to download pictures and clear the photos from the camera.I bought extra memory and will purchase an extra battery for my cruise trip.The only cons I have noticed so far :  Wish it had a more powerful zoom.
B002IPHIEG,13,15,If I had it to do over, I would not buy a camera with a touchscreen.One other thing--this thing eats batteries.
B002IPHIEG,13,16,It is just there all the time.
B002IPHIEG,13,17,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,13,18,The SONY Cable also has Video/Audio connectors, so its a bulky cable.GOOD- Flash Setting - Unlike most Canon's I have had you can turn OFF the flash and it stays off after turning the camera off/on again.
B002IPHIEG,13,19,The ONLY thing that I do not like is having to open the lens cover to take photos...but in the end this will protect the lens, because I dropped two of my Canons and messed up the lens.
B002IPHIEG,13,20,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,13,21,It is a lot better with the picture quality especially in low light.
B002IPHIEG,13,22,Battery door easily opened.
B002IPHIEG,13,23,As soon as the battery charged, I started using the camera.
B002IPHIEG,13,24,I only have a few complaints: it's difficult to figure out how to turn off the red-eye light; there's no setting to take a picture every X minutes, as I've had on other cameras; and full-light pictures tend to not be as great as other cameras.
B002IPHIEG,14,0,Screen delamination or is it moisture haze?
B002IPHIEG,14,1,The LCD screen is adjustable todeal with the brightness of the environment.
B002IPHIEG,14,2,No bevel to the LCD frame.
B002IPHIEG,14,3,Translated to small point and shoot cameras, it's almost impossible for an older pair of eyes to clearly see what's on a 2.7 or 3 inch LCD screen on the back of camera, even if bright sun isn't washing out the screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,4,It should have a viewfinder a bit hard to see in direct sunlight.
B002IPHIEG,14,5,It would come up with a choice of Delete this Picture on the left and Delete all Pictures on the right side of the screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,6,The all seemed to disappear at the point when I asked someone to take our picture.
B002IPHIEG,14,7,This is my first touch screen camera and I won't be going back to the old scroll method.
B002IPHIEG,14,8,There wasn't much to complain about.However I noticed last year that my screen was  getting hazy or splotchy; I don't know what to call it but it looks like a window with condensation all over it and I associated it with moisture or humidity "behine" the glass screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,9,Those can pose some problems when they open when they shouldn't (like in your pocket).The large touch screen makes everything easy.
B002IPHIEG,14,10,Most of the time with the WX1 I really can't make out what's on the screen, because to me its all out of focus (the problem is my eyes, not the camera).
B002IPHIEG,14,11,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.
B002IPHIEG,14,12,But the Touch Screen drove me crazy.
B002IPHIEG,14,13,The view screen is very unforgiving and will lead you to believe your shots are more contrasty and grainy than they actually are.
B002IPHIEG,14,14,This camera doesn't take such nice pictures.
B002IPHIEG,14,15,I use a camera to take nice looking pictures.
B002IPHIEG,14,16,It will mar or scratch the film and possibly damage the very screen you are trying to protect!
B002IPHIEG,14,17,Shadows and dark areas get crushed.Screen washes out in daylight.
B002IPHIEG,14,18,The LCD screen is bright, and high quality.. but its smaller.. and the menu system seems cluttered and annoyingly thought out.
B002IPHIEG,14,19,If the camera has trouble focusing you simply touch the screen where you want it to focus and it focuses on that spot.
B002IPHIEG,14,20,Now I notice that my wife's camera is doing the same thing and I don't know what is going on yet but I cannot reccommend this camera now that I have seen both screens go bad in less than two years.
B002IPHIEG,14,21,Durability  First day I severely scratched the screen on the metal rivet putting it in or taking it out of my jeans pocket a camera this small should be designed to be put in a pocket.3.
B002IPHIEG,14,22,The Large LCD screen is Spectacular as is the color in the photos.
B002IPHIEG,14,23,I had no trouble adapting tonot having a viewfinder.
B002IPHIEG,14,24,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,15,0,Subject was four feet away, but the camera focused almost 6 feet away.
B002IPHIEG,15,1,The subject was OK, but not tack sharp as what was hoped for.
B002IPHIEG,15,2,Good but poor autofocus.
B002IPHIEG,15,3,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,15,4,It also has a pet mode which is suppose to do the same thing for things that move on four legs.
B002IPHIEG,15,5,Second, the autofocus changes haphazardly, switching from foreground to background, sometimes following movement, and preferentially focusing on light sources.
B002IPHIEG,15,6,Problem solved, but it meant shelling out extra money.
B002IPHIEG,15,7,The gist of their complaints seemed to be that the camera took good pictures in low light (although a few didn't even agree with that) and crappy pictures in good light.
B002IPHIEG,15,8,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,15,9,This one, with the exception of a F/3.1 lens (why not 2.8 or better?), seems to answer all my prayers with a price point under $350.SONY.... THEY'RE ALL ABOUT GIMMICKS AND LACK OF TRUE PERFORMANCE.
B002IPHIEG,15,10,Low light pictures are blurry and pixelated.
B002IPHIEG,15,11,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,15,12,I would say, and this may be a mark against it for many people, that the WX1 is not a "point and shoot" camera unless one is familiar with its workings, but when I read the negative comments I wonder if some of the issues complained of could be addressed through a better understanding of the camera.
B002IPHIEG,15,13,If they're anything like me, they have a hard time reading a restaurant menu in dim light, or for that matter anything else a few feet from their face without reading glasses.
B002IPHIEG,15,14,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,15,15,Even in auto mode, the Canon took consistently good pictures, important when handing your camera to someone to shoot your picture.
B002IPHIEG,15,16,Great even in low lighted area.The bad side: The rocker/toggle switch used to zooming in and out the lens is fragile!
B002IPHIEG,15,17,actual video mode button (touchscreen based)-Zoom buttons seems awkward to use during filming-Battery/memory card is squeezed in camera's tiny body-4X optical zoom instead of 5X of DSC-T500If you search the internet for "redban and dsc-tx1"  I have numerous videos and photo samples available from my full review.
B002IPHIEG,15,18,I wonder if point and shoot cameras like this one could do better.
B002IPHIEG,15,19,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,15,20,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,15,21,4) Reviewing photos after a shot ... is too slow.
B002IPHIEG,15,22,It auto adjust to light so you always get great pictures.
B002IPHIEG,15,23,Photos were posted that looked really bad.
B002IPHIEG,15,24,I believe this is due to the flash being close to the lens.In summary, DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA.
B002IPHIEG,16,0,There is static noise when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,16,1,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,16,2,Sony repaired the damage under the warranty and not cost at all.
B002IPHIEG,16,3,Video is usually okay, but has two major problems... First, the noise of zooming in and out is recorded very loudly.
B002IPHIEG,16,4,Great customer service.
B002IPHIEG,16,5,This is not the zooming sound.
B002IPHIEG,16,6,They asked for US$400 to repair a tiny door.I am very disappointed for the customer support from Sony.
B002IPHIEG,16,7,So of course there is no reliable way to take photos and certainly no way to review photos.I called Amazon.com this morning and the customer service representative told me I had to call Sony.I visited the Sony website, entered my information, and was given instructions to ship the camera back to Sony (at my expense) for free warranty repair (luckily it was within the 90 day window).I've owned Canon digital cameras for 7 years and never had a hardware failure in the first three months like this.
B002IPHIEG,16,8,So why am I reviewing a camera that seems like a downgrade?Well Sony is using a new lens system called the "Exmor R".
B002IPHIEG,16,9,And, when directed to the service website to make a repair request, that malfunctioned too.
B002IPHIEG,16,10,Sony said they would repair the camera but that means shipping, waiting, and considerable trouble.
B002IPHIEG,16,11,I took it to my local camera shop to see if they could fix it, but all they do is send it in to Sony to have them repair it (for $260!).
B002IPHIEG,16,12,I reported the problem 32 days after buying so I was out of luck with the retailer.
B002IPHIEG,16,13,The MONO mic sounds fine, but its no where close to being as good as the STEREO mic of the past.
B002IPHIEG,16,14,Recording HD movie were also disappointing, when you are recording you can actually hear sound of zooming and focusing when you play them back.
B002IPHIEG,16,15,Leave quality aside, Sony sucks.
B002IPHIEG,16,16,It is annoying if you don't have a loud background noise to cover it.
B002IPHIEG,16,17,I sent the camera to Sony covered by warranty and customer service (very kindly I must say) told me that the camera was performing under specifications and even if they replaced it with a new one it will have the same flaw, so my only options were to exchange it for a different model or live with it...I'm amazed that they are still selling this camera (that isn't exactly cheap) with this awful flaw, maybe most people won't notice it if they don't take too much close up pictures but be aware of this problem if you're considering getting this camera.
B002IPHIEG,16,18,Did anyone at Sony even take this camera out for a night before shipping it?-
B002IPHIEG,16,19,The only way to stop the camera from zooming in, is to turn it off.
B002IPHIEG,16,20,Fortunately, when returning to P you'll find your settings have returned.
B002IPHIEG,16,21,Had High Hopes - Defective Product.
B002IPHIEG,16,22,I requested for the package to be left at my door with no signature so the shipping company called me within a few minutes to ensure that he would take care of this and gave me his cell phone number in case I needed it.
B002IPHIEG,16,23,It is just there all the time.
B002IPHIEG,16,24,Battery does not last as long as the old Sony I have (T-3 and T-30)2.
B002IPHIEG,17,0,Someone else said that they had no problem shooting at higher speeds in that setting.
B002IPHIEG,17,1,They looked better if I manually set the ISO, but if I'm just pulling it out for a quick shot, i don't want to have to remember to go to manual settings all the time.
B002IPHIEG,17,2,settings adjustments for color hues, saturation.-No
B002IPHIEG,17,3,Switching to any other mode defaults the settings to the terrible AUTO everything requiring the photographer to reset all those undesirable Sony auto settings.
B002IPHIEG,17,4,I know I can always get into manual modes to compensate for things, but I wanted something I didn't always have to do that with.
B002IPHIEG,17,5,It's pretty good, WITH THE RIGHT SETTINGS.
B002IPHIEG,17,6,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,17,7,Also for better exposure you can again adjust the EV.Panorama Shots: This one's tricky, from where you press the shutter to start the panorama it locks the exposure at that point.
B002IPHIEG,17,8,The reason it is not a point and shoot is because auto exposure is just wrong.
B002IPHIEG,17,9,You have to switch the camera to Handheld Twilight mode and adjust the Exposure Value(EV) from -0.3 to -1.7(this is a very important setting that needs to be set on order to remove the noisyness and grain from the photo, a setting people don't adjust and then complain about how bad the photo looks in low light).
B002IPHIEG,17,10,When setting on "P" mode I found out that switching the White Balance from "Auto" or "Daylight" to "Flash" in improves outdoor photos color, tone, exposure and warmness.
B002IPHIEG,17,11,You might also want to try different White Balances,setting correctly results in really nice low light shots.Outdoor shots:This camera in iSCN mode seems to keep the lens all the way open(F2.4)and it adjusts the shutter speed(a big No No)resulting in washed out over exposed photos(yuck).The solution: switch to "P" Mode which closes down the lens to around a nice F5.0 to F7.1(much better) and switch the White Balance to "Flash" .
B002IPHIEG,17,12,Fortunately, P with some of the white balance settings used after experimentation will get you great shots.3)
B002IPHIEG,17,13,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,17,14,I tried this, and with the White Balance set to Flash the pictures basically look the same out of the camera as they do after I've run them through Photoshop and hit Auto Contrast.
B002IPHIEG,17,15,However, did you ever try looking at "no flash" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode?
B002IPHIEG,17,16,It is a lot better with the picture quality especially in low light.
B002IPHIEG,17,17,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,17,18,mode is cool, but the image stitching does not work well enough in my opinion.-No
B002IPHIEG,17,19,Using the Program (as opposed to Automatic) Mode allows you to set the ISO between 160 and 3200, which will force the camera to use a slower or faster shutter speed.
B002IPHIEG,17,20,I wonder if point and shoot cameras like this one could do better.
B002IPHIEG,17,21,In fact, all the auto settings are wrong.
B002IPHIEG,17,22,I still haven't figured out how best to use the WX1, but I learned for, example, that turning the DRO on or off made a substantial difference in IQ, as did learning the idiosyncracies of the white balance and the various settings that were automatically set in the various camera modes.
B002IPHIEG,17,23,A reviewer on Amazon has also noted that you can get more vivid, warm outdoors photos from the WX1 by using the Program mode and moving the White Balance setting from Auto to Flash.
B002IPHIEG,17,24,Yeah, turning on the FLASH white balance for outdoor photos (which makes no sense by the way) --SOMETIMES-- does make the normally blueish outdoor photos look more pleasingly orangeish if you can remember to make this cryptic change or use P mode for your outdoor photos.
B002IPHIEG,18,0,I know that folks will say that I must have pressed the wrong button, and that might be so at times.
B002IPHIEG,18,1,4) Reviewing photos after a shot ... is too slow.
B002IPHIEG,18,2,Taking pictures with this camera is so much fun.Because it is so thin and light, pressing the shutter release button without adding shake to the shot takes a very steady hand.
B002IPHIEG,18,3,Instead it takes ... 3 to 5 seconds because you have to wait for the current photo to be processed and then wait wait wait to press the review button and if you press it twice ... oops, your still in picture-taking mode.
B002IPHIEG,18,4,3) Most importantly for me, the shutter does not click fast enough.
B002IPHIEG,18,5,I rather prefer to use the 2-second timer, which gives me just enough time after pressing the button to steady up the focus frame on my subject.
B002IPHIEG,18,6,The main subject of most of my pictures is my very active toddler, and the Canon's shutter lag time was ridiculous - in some instances it would take a full 2 seconds to take the picture, at which point my kid would no longer be in the room, let alone in the frame.
B002IPHIEG,18,7,Being an SLR user, I am used to instant reaction speed between the moment I press the button and the moment the shutter clicks.
B002IPHIEG,18,8,It's easy to whip out and snap a shot when the moment is right.
B002IPHIEG,18,9,While continuing to hold the desired meter settings with shutter button slightly depressed move (aim) the camera to your subject then shoot.
B002IPHIEG,18,10,I would buy it again.I would ask SONY to change a few things: 1) The power and shutter buttons are too flush and difficult to feel in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,18,11,Surely, the last photo can be put into a memory buffer to immediately be shown when the review button is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,18,12,Only minor complaint is that the lens is located very near where you hold the camera (upper right-hand corner) so you have to be careful not to take a picture of your thumb or finger -- have done that a few times :).
B002IPHIEG,18,13,Second, the screen is not always responsive (which may seem incongruous with my first remark, but that's my experience).
B002IPHIEG,18,14,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.
B002IPHIEG,18,15,So much movement occurs by the subject in the 1 to 4 seconds (depending on lighting) it takes the shutter to click on this Cybershot.
B002IPHIEG,18,16,I was so amazed in the difference!!  See my photos above![...]After 3 weeks of waiting for this camera to be released I now have it in my hands and taken over 500 pictures.
B002IPHIEG,18,17,For example: FOUR button pushes to delete a shot you just took.Sadly, I won't be keeping this thing.
B002IPHIEG,18,18,I only have a few complaints: it's difficult to figure out how to turn off the red-eye light; there's no setting to take a picture every X minutes, as I've had on other cameras; and full-light pictures tend to not be as great as other cameras.
B002IPHIEG,18,19,Whenever I took action shots or shots of kids or pets with the W170, the pictures would always come out blurry.
B002IPHIEG,18,20,First, it is all too easy while shooting to accidently change the settings and all too difficult to get back to what I want--after I realize what's happened.
B002IPHIEG,18,21,So I returned it and began searching for a point-and-shoot camera with a quick shutter speed, which was my main priority.The Sony's shutter speed is exactly what I need.
B002IPHIEG,18,22,Maybe I wasn't doing it right but they didn't seem to help much.The best bet for action and fast moving subjects with this camera seems to be the burst mode, which rips off 10 shots one after another when the shutter is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,18,23,If slide is open you can accidently adjust settings and not be quite ready for that candid shot.(2)
B002IPHIEG,18,24,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,19,0,With the card (which does not come included) and the camera, it runs up to $450.
B002IPHIEG,19,1,Newer models can use either a Sony card or SD card.
B002IPHIEG,19,2,I haven't transferred them to the computer, but I don't show my pictures on my computer.
B002IPHIEG,19,3,The only problem with it is you NEED to by a memory card, otherwise you can only store a couple of images on the camera's internal memory.
B002IPHIEG,19,4,Since my other cameras have been Sony cameras, I have already had memory stick cards and readers, so to me, its not a big deal.
B002IPHIEG,19,5,Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.
B002IPHIEG,19,6,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.
B002IPHIEG,19,7,Tell me what will you do when you want to move pictures from your camera to your computer on the fly, you will need the 10 meter long 10 plug Sony proprietary cable, how about taking the memory card out, oh, that's another proprietary memory stick duo, now how to charge it?
B002IPHIEG,19,8,It's annoying that it only takes the proprietary (and expensive) Sony memory stick instead of the usual SD card that all my other cameras have used, but that's not too big a deal.
B002IPHIEG,19,9,I am also annoyed that you have to purchase Sony's licensed memory card.
B002IPHIEG,19,10,This model has to have Sony card.
B002IPHIEG,19,11,A memory card is essential.So for the price and innovative technology, I really like this camera.
B002IPHIEG,19,12,No HDMI.Expensive Memory Stick Duo.
B002IPHIEG,19,13,There are some quirks with this camera which I wanted to point out.GOOD- Photo Quality - Others cover this so I wont go into it, but basically the photos are very good.BAD- Sony USB Cable - This is proprietary SONY cable, so you have to carry it around with you if you want to download photos from the directly from the camera without removing the Memory Stick.
B002IPHIEG,19,14,The biggest problem I've had is the USB connection - the plug on the camera end has always seemed a little wobbly and unstable, and over time it stopped connecting at all.
B002IPHIEG,19,15,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,19,16,Internal Memory.
B002IPHIEG,19,17,Interface to computer - dedicated cable I have to bring with me on vacation, or a usb sd card reader?
B002IPHIEG,19,18,No standard USB connection.
B002IPHIEG,19,19,(it's really ugly)No USB Charging.
B002IPHIEG,19,20,Now the SD cards have finally caught up to the speed of the MS.
B002IPHIEG,19,21,If you have had other cameras that used SD, just think of making a $20 investment into a very reliable, fast card for your camera, and use the SD card in your Wii.The only two complaints I have for this camera are it's low light picture taking, and the format it uses when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,19,22,Incidentally, the newest duo "pro" cards are not compatible with some older readers even if they accommodate Sony cards.... go figure.4)
B002IPHIEG,19,23,I had high hopes for this Sony, and even went to the trouble of buying a 16GB Memory Stick Duo (hate their proprietary attitude) and an extra battery.
B002IPHIEG,19,24,The memory stick duo is what Sony uses; save to an external hard drive (you're going to need one either for the quantity of VGA photos or the memory required to store all your 10.2 megapixel treasures) and re-use to bring down your expenses if the price differential with other media is such a big factor.
B002IPHIEG,20,0,I purchased this camera after trying and returning the Canon PowerShot SD1300IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Blue).
B002IPHIEG,20,1,Best Point & Shoot Digital Camera I Ever Got ;) SONY TX1.
B002IPHIEG,20,2,That being said, I think the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W290 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization (Dark Blue) would be just fine as well for my needs.If SONY would only stop with the SONY-only cables/cards this would be a much better camera!
B002IPHIEG,20,3,I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon.
B002IPHIEG,20,4,The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90.
B002IPHIEG,20,5,In practice, because this camera has such a wide angle lens to start with, zooming out 5x doesn't seem to get you any closer than a 3x zoom on a point and shoot without a wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,20,6,If its zoom hadn't given out after many active years, I'd still shoot with it.
B002IPHIEG,20,7,My previous point and shoot camera was the Sony W300, which most people considered slim and stylish, and this camera is smaller in all respects than that.
B002IPHIEG,20,8,Overall, best digital camera I have used.
B002IPHIEG,20,9,nothing better.
B002IPHIEG,20,10,This is the best point and shhot camera that i have used, hands down.
B002IPHIEG,20,11,I was still shooting film when the digital age rolled around.
B002IPHIEG,20,12,Mediocre zoom.The WX1 has a 5x zoom, which would seem to be better than the standard 3x zoom found on a typical point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,20,13,Sony Cybershot DSC-TX1 10.1MP "Exmor R" CMOS Digital Camera with 3-inch Touch-Screen LCD Digital Camera in Grey + 4GB Accessory Kit
B002IPHIEG,20,14,It is one of Sony's best kept secrets, and coming from a Canon Powershot diehard, this camera pulled it's weight and then some.
B002IPHIEG,20,15,I'm strictly point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,20,16,not much better than my seven year old Sony DSC-T30.
B002IPHIEG,20,17,The zooming noise from ZR1 can hardly be noticed on the footage as well.
B002IPHIEG,20,18,This is a common issue for cameras this small - but still, a more solid battery cover material would be better.GOOD- Auto Settings - The iAuto/Easy/P settings seem to work well and provide for lots of options.BAD- Battery Life - Not sure if its the use of the iAuto mode, but the battery life seem shorter than previous Sony DSC cameras - even with the Flash OFF on all shots.GOOD/BAD- Its VERY SMALL, even smaller than the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W290 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization (Dark Blue).
B002IPHIEG,20,19,Noisy Zoom Lens.
B002IPHIEG,20,20,I purchased this camera because I wanted something to replace my Sony DSC-W300.
B002IPHIEG,20,21,The downsides of the Canon are its larger size (but still pocketable), the lack of HD video, worse battery life (buy a second battery) and its narrower zoom range (28-105 mm equivalent vs. the Sony's 25-120 mm).
B002IPHIEG,20,22,At this rate, my next compact might be a Canon or Panasonic.
B002IPHIEG,20,23,This made a big difference in the quality of the pictures that I took.
B002IPHIEG,20,24,The Sony is smaller, has better battery life, and does HD video.
B002IPHIEG,21,0,The ONLY thing that I do not like is having to open the lens cover to take photos...but in the end this will protect the lens, because I dropped two of my Canons and messed up the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,1,Only problem that I can see is that the thing has the odd habit of turning on while in your pocket, which opens and expands the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,2,Many of my pictures have spots in them even though I do clean the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,3,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,4,The placement of the lens allows for others to touch or cover the lens with their fingers if they are taking a picture for you.
B002IPHIEG,21,5,Dust trapped inside lens, again!
B002IPHIEG,21,6,It is so much better than the cameras that have the protruding lens that extends when open.
B002IPHIEG,21,7,i like how the lens cover slides down and how slim the camera is.
B002IPHIEG,21,8,Another great feature is the lens cover that acts as an on/off switch.
B002IPHIEG,21,9,There are many problems with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,21,10,Great even in low lighted area.The bad side: The rocker/toggle switch used to zooming in and out the lens is fragile!
B002IPHIEG,21,11,Light and small for the lens range.3)
B002IPHIEG,21,12,The taping will permit you to slide the camera into and out of your pocket or case without peeling back the protector making it useless.
B002IPHIEG,21,13,Then when you receive the camera back from the factory, the spots are gone, but you discover the focus is not as good as it was before you sent the camera for cleaning.... then back to the factory, etc.
B002IPHIEG,21,14,Battery door easily opened.
B002IPHIEG,21,15,The rear element of the lens mechanism will get dirty.
B002IPHIEG,21,16,Its great if you want Non-Flash photos and are frequently turning the camera off/on in between shots.BAD- Battery Cover - The battery cover seems very flimsy and bows a bit if you hold the camera by it.
B002IPHIEG,21,17,I place my thumb along the bottom edge right where the battery cover it and there is no lip to keep your thumb from sliding the door open.
B002IPHIEG,21,18,It fits in my pocket and since the lens doesn't zoom outwards it's fast and ideal for quick shots.
B002IPHIEG,21,19,2) The battery/memory stick panel opens too easily when pulling the camera out of a pocket or tight spot.
B002IPHIEG,21,20,Those can pose some problems when they open when they shouldn't (like in your pocket).The large touch screen makes everything easy.
B002IPHIEG,21,21,After one year of use the rocker/toggle switch broke.
B002IPHIEG,21,22,As a former owner of a Sony A700 with 16-80mm Carl z lenses, plus a whole bag of long range lenses.
B002IPHIEG,21,23,Not worth the price.
B002IPHIEG,21,24,I bought this camera because of its 24mm super wide lens and the promise of Sony's new Exmor R chip.
B002IPHIEG,22,0,Better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,1,It is a lot better with the picture quality especially in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,2,Took great pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,3,Slightly better at low light but terrible with good light.
B002IPHIEG,22,4,Even the low light pictures don't seem to have a noise problem.
B002IPHIEG,22,5,Low light pictures are blurry and pixelated.
B002IPHIEG,22,6,It's better in low light but still very grainy, however it's worse in good bright light.
B002IPHIEG,22,7,Horrible picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,8,The gist of their complaints seemed to be that the camera took good pictures in low light (although a few didn't even agree with that) and crappy pictures in good light.
B002IPHIEG,22,9,Takes great (not perfect) pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,10,Also, many of my pictures that I have taken have been blurry, pixelated, and of poor quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,11,The low light picture taking is always a problem with cameras this size.
B002IPHIEG,22,12,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,22,13,It can take 6 consecutive pictures at once, and stack them together to get a high detailed picture, without showing the usual grainy high iso result.
B002IPHIEG,22,14,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,22,15,A grainy photo is better than no photo at all.
B002IPHIEG,22,16,It does take better photos in low light, but overall picture quality for an amateur user isn't that great.
B002IPHIEG,22,17,Still image and print quality are very important to me.
B002IPHIEG,22,18,nothing better.
B002IPHIEG,22,19,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,20,You can see some of the pictures I took here.
B002IPHIEG,22,21,Image quality was not what I expected.
B002IPHIEG,22,22,Yes, you are slightly more likely to get a better photo in the dark if you really need to take photos in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,22,23,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,22,24,Low light shots were noisier than my Fuji.
B002IPHIEG,23,0,I had a bought a Sony DSC-T3 a few years ago, wanting it so bad I imported one from Japan!
B002IPHIEG,23,1,I returned it in the next day I received.
B002IPHIEG,23,2,Do not buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,3,Having faith and loyalty in the Canon brand (this was our 4th Canon Camera purchase, two of which were Canon AE-1s given as gifts) I contacted Canon and was sorely disappointed.
B002IPHIEG,23,4,Horrible picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,23,5,not much better than my seven year old Sony DSC-T30.
B002IPHIEG,23,6,DSC-WX1b - I purchased this camera for 2 reasons.
B002IPHIEG,23,7,I bought two of the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX1/P camera within months of one another the first from Amazon on 12-17-2009.
B002IPHIEG,23,8,don't buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,9,Better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,23,10,I disregarded several of the negative reviews I read on this, trying to be optimistic, but that isn't working out for me.
B002IPHIEG,23,11,When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked.
B002IPHIEG,23,12,Waited until the price came down a bit and bought it.
B002IPHIEG,23,13,I am going to see if Sony wiill repair or replace them but right now it feels that $329 x 2 was too much to spend for less than two years use.
B002IPHIEG,23,14,Quick focusThe bad:1) The only reason I returned it was the biggest.
B002IPHIEG,23,15,It got me thinking about all of the Sony products we have had in the past.
B002IPHIEG,23,16,Please save your money and time - look elsewhere.
B002IPHIEG,23,17,While waiting to get the camera, I would check Amazon every day to see if anyone who had actually used the camera had put up any reviews yet.
B002IPHIEG,23,18,Not a killer, but annoying.I had great hopes for the picture quality that were not met.
B002IPHIEG,23,19,I bought one about 2 months ago and have been using it a lot.
B002IPHIEG,23,20,When I body-slammed my camera and myself to the paving stones of Salisbury, England, my Sony DSC-T9 performed like nothing had happened until I returned home, four days later.
B002IPHIEG,23,21,With the first 100 pictures of my trip gone I decided I didn't want to be stressed out every time I ask someone to take a picture of us, not to mention the stress of keeping myself from doing it.
B002IPHIEG,23,22,I'm somewhat puzzled after reading several of the poor reviews for this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,23,Very happy with the purchase.
B002IPHIEG,23,24,I just ordered this camera a couple days ago , so far been testing every feature it has.
B002IPHIEG,24,0,(I was up against a new model Nikkon)  The settings all do what they say, but perhaps it's greatest strength would also be it's weakness if any because while the settings are easy to use, and understand with help hints, those little "simple" settings are actually quite complex tools that make all the difference in a photo if you learn the camera and how to use each setting.
B002IPHIEG,24,1,He's picked it up a couple of times, but hasn't yet figured out how to work it...heaven help he should actually READ the manual (which I suggest).
B002IPHIEG,24,2,I had never done this before, and while it was a HUGE learning curve, I learned what this little stick of dynomite camera can and cannot do.
B002IPHIEG,24,3,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,24,4,It's an easy fix with any editing software, but most people probably won't even notice it.
B002IPHIEG,24,5,When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked.
B002IPHIEG,24,6,How is that possible?! (for the answer, see the next line item)- No manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,24,7,First, was to help a friend photograph a wedding.
B002IPHIEG,24,8,It is also intuitive and easy to use the advanced functions without much of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,24,9,Still, this camera seems to me to have a lot of functionality that makes it worth the time learning how to use it properly.
B002IPHIEG,24,10,The touchscreen also got an upgrade even if it's smaller and has more of a iphone'isk menu system.
B002IPHIEG,24,11,this is 2010 not 1985.4.  User interface - menu is difficult to navigate and full of gimmicky 'features' as opposed to useful things.
B002IPHIEG,24,12,The TX1 doesn't have a "movie mode" button like the t500/t900, you have to use the menu system to turn it on.
B002IPHIEG,24,13,Also, I find it easy to hit the power button when the camera's in a crowded pocket.
B002IPHIEG,24,14,Most were the work of apparently accomplished photographers.
B002IPHIEG,24,15,I'm somewhat puzzled after reading several of the poor reviews for this camera.
B002IPHIEG,24,16,Accordingly, before using the WX1, I downloaded and read the manuals in their entirety, trying to familiarize myself with the camera's resources (of which there are quite a few and limits (of which there are also quite a few).
B002IPHIEG,24,17,I am not a amateur photographer and expected the quality of this camera to be much higher considering the cost.
B002IPHIEG,24,18,Someone else said that they had no problem shooting at higher speeds in that setting.
B002IPHIEG,24,19,(minor) Menus are not intuitive or user-friendly.
B002IPHIEG,24,20,Controls are laid out sensibly, and it's easy to switch from automated settings to finer image control.One of the coolest new features is Panorama mode, which makes ultra-wide photos quickly and easily.
B002IPHIEG,24,21,The touch-screen interface is slick, but does have a bit of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,24,22,You're going to have to wipe off the touchscreen a lot.
B002IPHIEG,24,23,Basically you don't have any manual controls at all.
B002IPHIEG,24,24,As others have commented, you really do need to read the manual, experiment with the settings, and learn how to get the best results with it.But no one should be buying this camera because they want the best possible picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,25,0,The only problem I have had is with dust backscatter.
B002IPHIEG,25,1,With that, I will clear up problems previous owners have had.First, I'm sure all of you want to know how good the new Exmor R sensor is.
B002IPHIEG,25,2,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).
B002IPHIEG,25,3,I shoot mostly SLRs D90 and D700 Nikon, so I am not going to compare thosecameras to this one.
B002IPHIEG,25,4,Okay, I really loved this camera and the picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,25,5,Let just start by writing that, I've been a fan and using sony product for about 25-30 years and i spend tens of thousands of dollars on sony products.
B002IPHIEG,25,6,At least the first two Cybershots I had did not have this issue.
B002IPHIEG,25,7,When I can afford it, I'll get a DSLR to replace the SLR's.All of this is to say that I have some experience with photography, although I would not in any way consider myself a "serious" photographer.
B002IPHIEG,25,8,I was looking at this last month when it was announced, and had decided I was going to go with the forthcoming 980 from Canon.
B002IPHIEG,25,9,VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE: Great Camera!
B002IPHIEG,25,10,"Attention Buyers and Owners"!
B002IPHIEG,25,11,Having said that, I would buy this little cutie again 100x before its sucessor is released.
B002IPHIEG,25,12,Sony DSC-WX1 , A disappointing Camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,13,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,25,14,I was shooting in what would normally be considered a dust free area (Church and restaurant)so it is a design flaw.
B002IPHIEG,25,15,After about 5 months with this camera I have produced some very high quality images even at 5 m pixels.
B002IPHIEG,25,16,I bought this when it first came out a couple of years ago , It can take some really amazing photos and some times it takes bad photos not sure if it is me or the camera im kind of a newbie.My friend bought a expensive dslr camera and was like wow what kind of camera do you use ?
B002IPHIEG,25,17,I loved all of the features of this camera but the first thing that i care about is quality of photos which this camera has lack of it.
B002IPHIEG,25,18,I'm somewhat puzzled after reading several of the poor reviews for this camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,19,The previous Sony Cybershot I had also had dust trapped inside the lens also, and it gradually kept accumulating over the past year until I had to abandon it and get this one.
B002IPHIEG,25,20,Having faith and loyalty in the Canon brand (this was our 4th Canon Camera purchase, two of which were Canon AE-1s given as gifts) I contacted Canon and was sorely disappointed.
B002IPHIEG,25,21,I had a bought a Sony DSC-T3 a few years ago, wanting it so bad I imported one from Japan!
B002IPHIEG,25,22,Quality of video was not good enough to pay the extra money.
B002IPHIEG,25,23,Hi everyone and thanks for reading my reviewIf you are reading this chances are that you are in the market for a good point and shoot camera...In my opinion, you have to look no further.Most complaints about this camera basically tell you that the new image sensor that sony uses is not "that great" or that night images are good but day images are not...These complaints would ALL go away if they read the manual.
B002IPHIEG,25,24,I would say, and this may be a mark against it for many people, that the WX1 is not a "point and shoot" camera unless one is familiar with its workings, but when I read the negative comments I wonder if some of the issues complained of could be addressed through a better understanding of the camera.
B00DMS0LCO,0,0,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,0,1,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,0,2,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,0,3,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,0,4,I have never heard of this.why is there a communication problem between a new battery and the battery charger?...following the directions I separated the battery from the charger and put it back on....still blinking rapidly.....repeated this action again and finally the battery started to charge.
B00DMS0LCO,0,5,I put the dead battery that came with the camera on the charger and left it to charge thinking nothing of it.4
B00DMS0LCO,0,6,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,0,7,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,0,8,the battery charger charge TWO batteries fast at the same time?I'd consider a full frame version, if the cons are fix.for
B00DMS0LCO,0,9,NOT COOL.I have 2 after market batteries that would no charge on this charger .Bummer I then ordered an aftermarket charger for 5 $ no big deal.
B00DMS0LCO,0,10,I should be able to charge after market batteries on this charger.sample
B00DMS0LCO,0,11,keep in mind that this battery charger is the same battery charger that comes with the 5dmark ii 7D and a few other models.
B00DMS0LCO,0,12,I added the grip, a couple of batteries and gone to shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,0,13,hours later I see the battery still blinking rapidly ....ooops I guess I should read the directions.
B00DMS0LCO,0,14,its not charging ?
B00DMS0LCO,0,15,As usual, several things have changed, so it will take me some time to feel totally comfortable with it.
B00DMS0LCO,0,16,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,0,17,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,0,18,I know one day I will get used to the positions of the button.
B00DMS0LCO,0,19,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,0,20,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,0,21,When I get the battery, there is no power in it.
B00DMS0LCO,0,22,Interestingly enough the battery still has a charge left after all the pics and a dozen movie clips of some 41sec to 2min duration.
B00DMS0LCO,0,23,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,0,24,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,1,0,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,1,1,Helpful, great illustrations.
B00DMS0LCO,1,2,I  am not a big fan of touch screen operation because the screen gets smudged in a hurry, being anal retentive/ a clean freak this gets annoying to me but I will make the best of it.*
B00DMS0LCO,1,3,The icing on the cake is the Touch Screen with multi-touch operation, as well as Touch AF! Excellent!
B00DMS0LCO,1,4,The still photos can't be touched.
B00DMS0LCO,1,5,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,1,6,Mike Browne and other tutorials on YouTube will help me.
B00DMS0LCO,1,7,I should note that I used the viewfinder primarily rather than the LCD screen for the pics.I found it very frustrating that the camera does not have a dedicated button for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,1,8,always put a screen shield on this camera ASAP you'll be glad you did.the 3 main reasons I sold my 5D mark ii was it didn't have a swivel screen , I love the swivel screen, its a must for video shooting.
B00DMS0LCO,1,9,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,1,10,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,1,11,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,1,12,Seems like a good camera, the rest is up to me.
B00DMS0LCO,1,13,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,1,14,I really like the camera but there may be one big flaw.
B00DMS0LCO,1,15,I hope I can learn to use 20% of the features on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,1,16,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,1,17,camera 7 FPS is awesome + 20 MP is pretty cool.one
B00DMS0LCO,1,18,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,1,19,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,1,20,All the cameras do a great job efficiently.
B00DMS0LCO,1,21,After using my camera for 10 days the buttons on the back (Menu/Playback/Q) stopped working.
B00DMS0LCO,1,22,The next best thing to getting a full frame.
B00DMS0LCO,1,23,The swivel touch screen is not really comfortable to use with your left hand (considering your right hand is holding the camera).
B00DMS0LCO,1,24,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,2,0,I upgraded from a Canon Rebel to the 70d.
B00DMS0LCO,2,1,Focus Issue using the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,2,2,This was an upgrade for me.
B00DMS0LCO,2,3,Excellent upgrade for Canon owners.
B00DMS0LCO,2,4,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,2,5,Focus issue???? Sign the petition!
B00DMS0LCO,2,6,The sensitivity of the autofocus points in Live View is also excellent, arguably more accurate than what can be achieved through the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,2,7,I tend to default to the viewfinder for my composition but the Live View option on the 70d is so good that I am using it as well.
B00DMS0LCO,2,8,I really like the revision to the autofocus point selection options in the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,2,9,Focussing with live view is no problem but focussing correctly when using fast lenses (Sigma f1.8) through the viewfinder results in many missed shots.
B00DMS0LCO,2,10,I find autofocus to be faster and more accurate with all my lenses than had been the case with the 60d.
B00DMS0LCO,2,11,Again the upgrade from previous models is significant with better focus tracking and wonderful HD performance.
B00DMS0LCO,2,12,I have been very happy with my 60Ds, but wanted to get the additional focus points.
B00DMS0LCO,2,13,Gone are the red dots that the 60d had replaced by what I find to be more useful squares with increased options for point selection including a zone focusing mode that the 60d lacks.
B00DMS0LCO,2,14,a wide 80% dedicated to AF (in AF-C mode), it works nicely with Flash that has the AF illuminating light.Overlay of info in view finder makes composition a piece of cake.The red AF confirmation in view finder keeps my eye on the subject not having to wonder off center.The kit lens focus in near silent.
B00DMS0LCO,2,15,The 19 point autofocus system, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder, consistently miss-focus the pictures, with my Canon 300mm F4 IS L lens.
B00DMS0LCO,2,16,Simply compose a shot, touch the specific point on the Live View screen and the 70d can be set up to quickly focus on that spot and shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,2,17,I had to switch back and forth and was frustrated as I prefer to use the viewfinder but HAVE to use live view for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,2,18,Perfect for action and video (video is unbeatable) This Camera I perfect for action photography it is super fast and the autofocus is always right on.The wifi function is very nice but just a gadget for fun.The live view focus is super fast and and combined with the touch it is unbeatable in video and live view mode.The feeling in the hand is similar to the on find in the 5d III it is just way lighter.Another big pro is the variety of lenses, because you can either use the pro lenses with the ef connection or the cheaper ef-s lenses, where canon just recently added the new stm type which is as quiet as the pro lenses, which is nice for video, and a lot faster in focusing then the older ef-s lenses, which is nice for action.
B00DMS0LCO,2,19,In my case Tamron service was aware of the issue and under warranty upgraded my lenses firmware and now everything works perfectly.
B00DMS0LCO,2,20,I am used to the Rebel T series.
B00DMS0LCO,2,21,Over time I have migrated up the line of Canon DSLR cameras from the early Rebel series through to the 60d (the 70d predecessor).
B00DMS0LCO,2,22,Review of Canon 70D; some shortcomings.
B00DMS0LCO,2,23,Instead, you have to flip the switch and use the live view mode.
B00DMS0LCO,2,24,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,3,0,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,3,1,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,3,2,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,3,3,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,3,4,I was attending a concert and wanted to alternate between pictures and movie clips.
B00DMS0LCO,3,5,Please note that this review is just my personal opinion and I might be wrong.
B00DMS0LCO,3,6,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,3,7,Most reviews made it sound like a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,3,8,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,3,9,I have not tried any of the movie editing capabilities; will report later.
B00DMS0LCO,3,10,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,3,11,Impressions after one family travel event.
B00DMS0LCO,3,12,But I decided to buy the Sony because of all the rave reviews I've read; it should meet my needs (hasn't arrived yet).
B00DMS0LCO,3,13,After using my camera for 10 days the buttons on the back (Menu/Playback/Q) stopped working.
B00DMS0LCO,3,14,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,3,15,This is just my personal preference.
B00DMS0LCO,3,16,But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,3,17,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,3,18,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,3,19,Now, the T2i has great image quality (especially based on the year when it came out), but noise and dynamic range are practically the same.
B00DMS0LCO,3,20,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,3,21,I was very anxious for this camera to arrive with all the hype about its enhanced focusing attributes especially for LiveView and in Movie mode.
B00DMS0LCO,3,22,Or better yet....fix it!Update 3/30/14I am sending the camera in for repairsThe lenses I use on this camera are the:- Sigma 1.8 18-35mm- Canon 1.8 85mm- Canon 3.5-5.6
B00DMS0LCO,3,23,Based on all the great reviews, it may only be only some batches - I do not know.
B00DMS0LCO,3,24,Instead, you have to flip the switch and use the live view mode.
B00DMS0LCO,4,0,However, it's still very good.
B00DMS0LCO,4,1,I have had a DSLR previously, but always kept it in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,4,2,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,4,3,It's a great camera with an outstanding feature set.
B00DMS0LCO,4,4,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,4,5,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,4,6,picture from my sigma 170-500mm on auto where beautiful.l
B00DMS0LCO,4,7,Long exposure behavior (I use it for astro pictures at 2-5 minute exposure) is really no difference to the already great T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,4,8,first camera was set up to shoot RAW.
B00DMS0LCO,4,9,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,4,10,I can take multiple pictures for any positions.
B00DMS0LCO,4,11,Haven't done much night shooting, but that's on my to-do list.
B00DMS0LCO,4,12,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,4,13,Helpful, great illustrations.
B00DMS0LCO,4,14,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,4,15,It's well made, easy to use, and the focus is very good - no hunting and pecking but smooth and quick.For video it's live auto-focus is excellent - use the swivel touch screen to keep the focus on a moving subject.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars are the button layouts make it a little counter-intuitive to find and change manual settings like white balance.Of course it's not as good as a full frame camera like the 5dmarkii in low light, or for it's dynamic range.
B00DMS0LCO,4,16,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,4,17,Amazing!
B00DMS0LCO,4,18,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,4,19,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,4,20,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,4,21,I hope I can learn to use 20% of the features on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,4,22,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,4,23,tracking will vary do to lens speed and shooting conditions.
B00DMS0LCO,4,24,High Image Quality from Poor light, quick focusing moving subjects, .... were my primary intend for this.
B00DMS0LCO,5,0,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,5,1,flash works as expected.Nice Hi ISO; doing ISO 3200 more often now.CONISO-A mode under expose (by 1.5 to 2EV) frequently with external flash on bracket.buttons
B00DMS0LCO,5,2,Works like a charm (after I got used to the somewhat tinny sound of the shutter).-
B00DMS0LCO,5,3,a leap in continous AF (in good light).
B00DMS0LCO,5,4,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,5,5,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,5,6,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,5,7,It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots.
B00DMS0LCO,5,8,Yes they are not as fast as the l-lenses/pro lenses but they are a lot cheaper and for that money it is way better then anything else.The only thing that is a little bit sad is that already with an iso of 3200, you can notice a strong noise.
B00DMS0LCO,5,9,The focusing appeared to be very fast and accurate except later I found most of my images were not properly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,5,10,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,5,11,I know one day I will get used to the positions of the button.
B00DMS0LCO,5,12,Image quality in low light a bit noisy- Auto-Focus on the center focus point required +17 manual focus adjustment with a new 50mm f1.4.
B00DMS0LCO,5,13,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,5,14,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,5,15,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,5,16,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,5,17,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,5,18,As usual, several things have changed, so it will take me some time to feel totally comfortable with it.
B00DMS0LCO,5,19,Only for higher ISO and longer exposures one can see a little improvement (but not much more than you can expect in variances from the same sensor model).
B00DMS0LCO,5,20,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,5,21,understand that the "game changing" capabilities of this camera are on the video side, but I don't shoot a lot of video and there are plenty reviews out there on that topic.
B00DMS0LCO,5,22,High Image Quality from Poor light, quick focusing moving subjects, .... were my primary intend for this.
B00DMS0LCO,5,23,In fact, I can't tell the difference between unprocessed results from both sensors, even at 100%, for ISO 800 and below.
B00DMS0LCO,5,24,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,6,0,the on camera flash.
B00DMS0LCO,6,1,Amazon sold this 70d to me as new, it came with with a memory card with other peoples pictures on it.Obviously not new.
B00DMS0LCO,6,2,In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card.
B00DMS0LCO,6,3,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,6,4,I sold my canon 5dmark ii to get this camera, I also have a t3i.I love the speed of this camera shooting jpeg with a fast sd card , that's right you should  have a fast card (80 mb's will do) for this camera especially shooing RAW (lab tests later) video tracking was decent with my 28-105mm canon lens.
B00DMS0LCO,6,5,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,6,6,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,6,7,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,6,8,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,6,9,(with decent light conditions)Color Saturation and Image quality were good (with decent light)7fps was fast enough for me.Weather resistance was useful.Tilt screen was useful.18-135
B00DMS0LCO,6,10,Amazon said it was new, it was not.
B00DMS0LCO,6,11,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,6,12,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,6,13,I am in the process of getting the device replaced as it is still within the return time-frameThe Good:It has everything except a full framesensor.Video AF was excellent.
B00DMS0LCO,6,14,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,6,15,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,6,16,a leap in continous AF (in good light).
B00DMS0LCO,6,17,first camera was set up to shoot RAW.
B00DMS0LCO,6,18,I feel I have most shooting situations covered with the on camera flash although it has its drawbacks.
B00DMS0LCO,6,19,High Image Quality from Poor light, quick focusing moving subjects, .... were my primary intend for this.
B00DMS0LCO,6,20,I have an external speed light/flash I just really never find myself using it.
B00DMS0LCO,6,21,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,6,22,The replacement asked me to set date and time.To their credit, Amazon made it right quickly and without cost to me, but the fact that it happened at all is a bit of a shock.
B00DMS0LCO,6,23,always put a screen shield on this camera ASAP you'll be glad you did.the 3 main reasons I sold my 5D mark ii was it didn't have a swivel screen , I love the swivel screen, its a must for video shooting.
B00DMS0LCO,6,24,Of all the L lenses I've used, this sounded like how cat walks, dead silent.Articulated screen is awesome.wireless
B00DMS0LCO,7,0,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,1,One like this and another small P&S; I can carry in my pocket.
B00DMS0LCO,7,2,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,7,3,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,4,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,7,5,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,7,6,during some video shots I didn't expect the video to be stable but i was surprised to see a decent shot.Pricing was goodConclusion:All the ugly and bad points (except for the lemon part) seems to be been done intentionally by cannon to balance their lineup.I was split between 6D and 70D and ended up buying 70D as I will be using all those bells and whistles than the full-frame.
B00DMS0LCO,7,7,In general Full-Frames are better.Most likely in a year or two we will see a full-frame from cannon having the same 70D features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,8,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,7,9,All the beautiful photos that u see online  are not only using DSLR but have considerable stabilizing equipment and do not forget that the photographer has considerable experience.For Hobbyists/Enthusiasts/ Price Conscious:This is a good camera for us till a full-frame with Video-AF is released by Canon.
B00DMS0LCO,7,10,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,7,11,I should've bought a replacement for the Canon PowerShot s95.So I sent the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 back and purchased the Sony RX100 II.
B00DMS0LCO,7,12,that is a combination of 6d and 70d (today that is 5d, but expensive for non-professionals)Advice:For Families:if you are looking for a camera to get family photos(events and travel) and are trying to buy DSLR please do your self a favor and  try the mirrorless cameras first (Cannon should be coming out with a new EOS-M soon) .
B00DMS0LCO,7,13,Comes surprisingly close to the 24-105mm L lens, but with a wider range and a lot lower price.
B00DMS0LCO,7,14,a sony RX100?
B00DMS0LCO,7,15,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,7,16,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,7,17,When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't.
B00DMS0LCO,7,18,Regardless of the focus mode you use, none works well for moving subjects.The camera takes nice pictures, but there are many better options, and with the release of the new Sony A6000, this camera is good only if you already invested in canon glass, and sadly most of it won't work with this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,7,19,I had an earlier EOS model that I'd had for several years and was expecting this one to feel about the same.
B00DMS0LCO,7,20,always put a screen shield on this camera ASAP you'll be glad you did.the 3 main reasons I sold my 5D mark ii was it didn't have a swivel screen , I love the swivel screen, its a must for video shooting.
B00DMS0LCO,7,21,DSLRs come with a lot of baggage.
B00DMS0LCO,7,22,Also I have not compared it to any products by Nikon - the review below is only for Canon folks.I will start with the negatives first.The Ugly:Plasticky Dial :Canon- Please use metal for the heavily used parts.The Bad:Noise: There is considerable noise in low light both in photos and videos.(realistic
B00DMS0LCO,7,23,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,7,24,I have owned DSLR's before, and I was happy with my Nikon which died after getting sand in the lens which was too expensive to replace.
B00DMS0LCO,8,0,Good kit lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,1,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,8,2,Over priced not a full frame sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,8,3,This one did not go on if the lens cap was on, nor could you put the lens cap on if the hood was attached.
B00DMS0LCO,8,4,For a $1200 camera it should have a full frame senor.Their still not there yet.
B00DMS0LCO,8,5,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,8,6,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.
B00DMS0LCO,8,7,I have owned DSLR's before, and I was happy with my Nikon which died after getting sand in the lens which was too expensive to replace.
B00DMS0LCO,8,8,Perfect for this use, using the kit lens.Impressed with the features.
B00DMS0LCO,8,9,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,8,10,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,8,11,The next best thing to getting a full frame.
B00DMS0LCO,8,12,The lens hood I received was poor.
B00DMS0LCO,8,13,We have to hold off until they produce a camera with a full frame senor for a reasonable price.
B00DMS0LCO,8,14,I added a 18-270 Tamron lens to it, which is lighter than some others with this range.
B00DMS0LCO,8,15,This camera with any attached lens does not balance well for any length of time.
B00DMS0LCO,8,16,Comes surprisingly close to the 24-105mm L lens, but with a wider range and a lot lower price.
B00DMS0LCO,8,17,I realized I might get better results with a better (prime?) lens but I also realized that the camera was just too big and heavy and that I was probably going to leave it home most of the time.
B00DMS0LCO,8,18,Over priced.
B00DMS0LCO,8,19,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,8,20,Magnificent DSLR.
B00DMS0LCO,8,21,I often take photos of birds in flight and I got a lot more keepers compared to my other bodies.
B00DMS0LCO,8,22,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,8,23,But, having back-lit buttons would flatten the learning curve, while I am looking at the picture on LCD and change parameter at the same time.The lens 18-135mm has good focal length; it's sharpness fall off quickly toward the corners.can
B00DMS0LCO,8,24,I have a professional Canon video camera.
B00DMS0LCO,9,0,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,9,1,Too good for me.
B00DMS0LCO,9,2,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,9,3,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,9,4,I do wish at times I could soften the image because the detail can be too telling.
B00DMS0LCO,9,5,(with decent light conditions)Color Saturation and Image quality were good (with decent light)7fps was fast enough for me.Weather resistance was useful.Tilt screen was useful.18-135
B00DMS0LCO,9,6,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,9,7,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,9,8,Good kit lens.
B00DMS0LCO,9,9,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,9,10,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,9,11,But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,9,12,I often take photos of birds in flight and I got a lot more keepers compared to my other bodies.
B00DMS0LCO,9,13,Now, the T2i has great image quality (especially based on the year when it came out), but noise and dynamic range are practically the same.
B00DMS0LCO,9,14,Isn't the idea to capture an image and display it?Conclusion> It is a worthy, light camera capable of good images when properly exposed.
B00DMS0LCO,9,15,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,9,16,The in camera aberration and ISO reduction really works.
B00DMS0LCO,9,17,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,9,18,I did have high hopes for better low light photos with a new processor since the 60D essentially used a 4 year old unit but unfortunately they look almost identical.
B00DMS0LCO,9,19,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,9,20,For the same camera settings, the 70D produces much more aggressive image settings than my T2i, which makes the 70D performance look much better at first glance.
B00DMS0LCO,9,21,tracking will vary do to lens speed and shooting conditions.
B00DMS0LCO,9,22,In fact, I can't tell the difference between unprocessed results from both sensors, even at 100%, for ISO 800 and below.
B00DMS0LCO,9,23,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,9,24,this camera raised the level of usefulness on this sometimes tricky to use lens.
B00DMS0LCO,10,0,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,10,1,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,10,2,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,10,3,That is the reason I bought this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,4,This is a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,5,I actually purchased a T5i because of an amazing Christmas deal.
B00DMS0LCO,10,6,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,10,7,I was always hesitant to purchase one because of price and i didn't think it would change the way i took pictures.
B00DMS0LCO,10,8,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,10,9,No GPS -- otherwise great.
B00DMS0LCO,10,10,I bought this on pre-order, and it's been a fantastic little camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,11,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,10,12,This particular purchase was a gift for my sister in Europe, ordered four days before my recent trip.
B00DMS0LCO,10,13,I had an earlier EOS model that I'd had for several years and was expecting this one to feel about the same.
B00DMS0LCO,10,14,Read the professional reviews.
B00DMS0LCO,10,15,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,10,16,As a result, I've paid full-price for an 'open-box' (being charitable) product.
B00DMS0LCO,10,17,Excellant Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,18,I'm a professional photographer and we have ventured into the photo booth business.
B00DMS0LCO,10,19,However, consider other sellers.Amazon's performance on my purchase was appalling and possibly fraudulent.
B00DMS0LCO,10,20,I'd researched it, consider the Nikon, but I still think I've made the right choice for me.
B00DMS0LCO,10,21,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,10,22,Box was worn from opening, LCD Display had fingerprints all over it, and the lens had fingerprints and misc other spots on it.Needed this for a birthday this Saturday so returning to Amazon for a refund and going to Best Buy and get them to match the price.I am not likely to ever purchase a big ticket item from Amazon as I don't want used cameras, etc.
B00DMS0LCO,10,23,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,10,24,But I decided to buy the Sony because of all the rave reviews I've read; it should meet my needs (hasn't arrived yet).
B00DMS0LCO,11,0,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,11,1,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,11,2,Good Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,3,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,11,4,I'm a professional photographer and we have ventured into the photo booth business.
B00DMS0LCO,11,5,This is what i want it's easy to connect to my smartphone.
B00DMS0LCO,11,6,Helpful, great illustrations.
B00DMS0LCO,11,7,All the cameras do a great job efficiently.
B00DMS0LCO,11,8,The icing on the cake is the Touch Screen with multi-touch operation, as well as Touch AF! Excellent!
B00DMS0LCO,11,9,I hope I can learn to use 20% of the features on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,10,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,11,11,It looks, feels, and can operate much like the 60d that I owned previously so I could use it right out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,11,12,These buttons are customized via the custom controls and i have mine set up for back button focusing.If you have already mastered your Txi Rebel or other entry level DSLR and want to step up without going to a full frame, the 70D is the best choice.
B00DMS0LCO,11,13,I like all the features on the camera and as soon as I work my way through the 400 plus page manual, I am sure that I will take advantage of the versatility that this camera offers.
B00DMS0LCO,11,14,The added perk of the New touch screen technology from the T4i and T5i have greatly improved the speed to many obscure functions sometimes needed in the depths of software.
B00DMS0LCO,11,15,I am determined to learn about creative photography and I have apparently picked a high end camera to begin with.
B00DMS0LCO,11,16,Nice update to an already strong predecessor for semi-pro photographers...video functionality is unreal.
B00DMS0LCO,11,17,The important part is the photographic result, fortunately all this camera's do a great job.The 70D is a worthy replacement to the 60D but if you already own a 60D keep using it.I believe that no camera will make you 100% happy but again, who cares.
B00DMS0LCO,11,18,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,11,19,If you need a camera for only still photography you may be better off buying a 7D or full frame camera for the money even tho it does do a "pretty good" job much like the original 60D.
B00DMS0LCO,11,20,I have had a DSLR previously, but always kept it in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,11,21,The next best thing to getting a full frame.
B00DMS0LCO,11,22,The touchscreen is much more than a gimmick, it is my go to method of set up when I turn the camera on.
B00DMS0LCO,11,23,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,11,24,Have the 60D as well and they are quite similar.
B00DMS0LCO,12,0,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,12,1,Too good for me.
B00DMS0LCO,12,2,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,12,3,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,12,4,However, it's still very good.
B00DMS0LCO,12,5,I really like the features of this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,6,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,12,7,Finally a word about Video performance.
B00DMS0LCO,12,8,I have a professional Canon video camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,9,If you're interested in video production, buy a dedicated video camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,10,Regardless of the focus mode you use, none works well for moving subjects.The camera takes nice pictures, but there are many better options, and with the release of the new Sony A6000, this camera is good only if you already invested in canon glass, and sadly most of it won't work with this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,11,It does however lack a good amount of creative features within the camera for video recording.
B00DMS0LCO,12,12,understand that the "game changing" capabilities of this camera are on the video side, but I don't shoot a lot of video and there are plenty reviews out there on that topic.
B00DMS0LCO,12,13,That said, even my limited skills have resulted in amazing pics.
B00DMS0LCO,12,14,I was attending a concert and wanted to alternate between pictures and movie clips.
B00DMS0LCO,12,15,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,12,16,My Tamron 28-70 VC and 18-270 PZD for example failed to record video with this camera body.
B00DMS0LCO,12,17,Very good camera with only a few minor issues.
B00DMS0LCO,12,18,I wish I knew how to use this thing better.
B00DMS0LCO,12,19,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,12,20,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,12,21,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,12,22,being a videographer for many years DSLR'S  have a way to go to match pro-Sumer video cameras.this
B00DMS0LCO,12,23,I do wish at times I could soften the image because the detail can be too telling.
B00DMS0LCO,12,24,a sony RX100?
B00DMS0LCO,13,0,When I get the battery, there is no power in it.
B00DMS0LCO,13,1,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,13,2,break battery.
B00DMS0LCO,13,3,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,13,4,I put the dead battery that came with the camera on the charger and left it to charge thinking nothing of it.4
B00DMS0LCO,13,5,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,13,6,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,13,7,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,13,8,The replacement asked me to set date and time.To their credit, Amazon made it right quickly and without cost to me, but the fact that it happened at all is a bit of a shock.
B00DMS0LCO,13,9,I think this product was opened before I get it.
B00DMS0LCO,13,10,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,13,11,the battery charger charge TWO batteries fast at the same time?I'd consider a full frame version, if the cons are fix.for
B00DMS0LCO,13,12,Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.
B00DMS0LCO,13,13,I have never heard of this.why is there a communication problem between a new battery and the battery charger?...following the directions I separated the battery from the charger and put it back on....still blinking rapidly.....repeated this action again and finally the battery started to charge.
B00DMS0LCO,13,14,I took it out of the box and the Live View mode wasn't working reliably: I had to reset the camera twice by pulling the battery out in the first few hours of use.
B00DMS0LCO,13,15,Good kit lens.
B00DMS0LCO,13,16,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,13,17,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,13,18,Yes, I bought it direct from Amazon and not from a third party.
B00DMS0LCO,13,19,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,13,20,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,13,21,hours later I see the battery still blinking rapidly ....ooops I guess I should read the directions.
B00DMS0LCO,13,22,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,13,23,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,13,24,keep in mind that this battery charger is the same battery charger that comes with the 5dmark ii 7D and a few other models.
B00DMS0LCO,14,0,I am still trying to figure out how to hold the camera so that I can tap on the back viewing screen where I want the focus.
B00DMS0LCO,14,1,The swivel touch screen is not really comfortable to use with your left hand (considering your right hand is holding the camera).
B00DMS0LCO,14,2,That is why I took one star away.I found the touch LCD and touch control screen on top of the 70D quite useful and adapted to them quickly.
B00DMS0LCO,14,3,Touch flip screen.
B00DMS0LCO,14,4,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,14,5,Focus Issue using the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,14,6,shutter would click when the live view button was pressed, but the LCD screen would stay blank.
B00DMS0LCO,14,7,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,14,8,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,14,9,My first trial shots with this camera yielded some that I thought were pretty soft for the pixel count of the camera.
B00DMS0LCO,14,10,Simply compose a shot, touch the specific point on the Live View screen and the 70d can be set up to quickly focus on that spot and shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,14,11,I like my buttons and I am slow to adjust to what the touch screen offers, but I am catching on.
B00DMS0LCO,14,12,The focusing appeared to be very fast and accurate except later I found most of my images were not properly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,14,13,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,14,14,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,14,15,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,14,16,But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,14,17,Focussing with live view is no problem but focussing correctly when using fast lenses (Sigma f1.8) through the viewfinder results in many missed shots.
B00DMS0LCO,14,18,Photo colors were not true unless taken in direct sunlight.
B00DMS0LCO,14,19,I often take photos of birds in flight and I got a lot more keepers compared to my other bodies.
B00DMS0LCO,14,20,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,14,21,Also I have not compared it to any products by Nikon - the review below is only for Canon folks.I will start with the negatives first.The Ugly:Plasticky Dial :Canon- Please use metal for the heavily used parts.The Bad:Noise: There is considerable noise in low light both in photos and videos.(realistic
B00DMS0LCO,14,22,Images are softer than expected.
B00DMS0LCO,14,23,Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.
B00DMS0LCO,14,24,the directions state if the red blinking light flashes rapidly its not charging .
B00DMS0LCO,15,0,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,15,1,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,15,2,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,15,3,The 19 point autofocus system, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder, consistently miss-focus the pictures, with my Canon 300mm F4 IS L lens.
B00DMS0LCO,15,4,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,5,I never had this problem, or any other issue, with my T3i.
B00DMS0LCO,15,6,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,15,7,Without using FEL, the pictures are way underexposed.If
B00DMS0LCO,15,8,It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots.
B00DMS0LCO,15,9,I am afraid to shoot with it!
B00DMS0LCO,15,10,I have tried most of the tests, micro-adjustments, and other recommendations for those with similar problems, but nothing gives me a consistent focused picture.
B00DMS0LCO,15,11,While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,15,12,Liking the new features having moved up from a canon t3i.
B00DMS0LCO,15,13,fine camera.
B00DMS0LCO,15,14,(The situation is much better when using liveview auto-focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,15,(The situation is much better when using liveview auto-focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,16,If I can't buy a Pro camera for $4000.00
B00DMS0LCO,15,17,If you shoot RAW you will need to buy the new Adobe Lightroom 5 and update it to the 5.2 version to even get it to view.
B00DMS0LCO,15,18,Bought this camera for its auto-focus, returned this camera due to autofocus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,19,It appears the 19-point auto-focus is not focusing on the points indicated in the viewfinder, but on something closer.
B00DMS0LCO,15,20,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,15,21,give me one that feels like a pro camera (like you did with the 40D).
B00DMS0LCO,15,22,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,15,23,I am used to the Rebel T series.
B00DMS0LCO,15,24,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,16,0,I gave it a 1 star because of the customer service I received from canon not for the camera itself because i never got see how the camera performs.
B00DMS0LCO,16,1,Said i can send my brand new camera for repair.
B00DMS0LCO,16,2,Most reviews made it sound like a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,16,3,Same issues.
B00DMS0LCO,16,4,putting this in 1 star just because of audio.
B00DMS0LCO,16,5,Poor customer service is beyond doubt.
B00DMS0LCO,16,6,When i called canon the guy treated me as if I was stupid and was telling me there is no way that there can be a err 30 code because thats a lens error and usually happens after a lot of use.
B00DMS0LCO,16,7,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,8,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,16,9,It just shows how many "clicks" are on your shutter, in your camera.
B00DMS0LCO,16,10,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,16,11,I tried 3 cameras and all have the same problem.
B00DMS0LCO,16,12,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,16,13,Audio plug is worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,16,14,Video focus tracking only worked half the time when handheld.
B00DMS0LCO,16,15,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,16,16,See the Amazon review by Mr. Ralph J. Secoy.
B00DMS0LCO,16,17,Might have received a flawed unit or the kit lens is junk, but I'm sending it back for a refund.
B00DMS0LCO,16,18,The dpreview web site noticed the same thing.
B00DMS0LCO,16,19,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,16,20,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,16,21,Microphone is even more worthless.I plugged in external shotgun mic with a 1/8 adapter.
B00DMS0LCO,16,22,I liked the IQ from this sensor, however, I returned it because I could barely hear the autofocus confirmation beep.
B00DMS0LCO,16,23,If you get a camera that is used I would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one.
B00DMS0LCO,16,24,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,17,0,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,1,All 3 that I tried had the same Auto Focus problems that could not be corrected by the AF Micro Adjustment.
B00DMS0LCO,17,2,first camera was set up to shoot RAW.
B00DMS0LCO,17,3,date was set on the first camera.
B00DMS0LCO,17,4,Uses flash for low-light focus which will blind your subject.-
B00DMS0LCO,17,5,I have tried micro adjustments but that doesn't seem to work as the camera is inconsistent in how it misses focus.
B00DMS0LCO,17,6,Auto Focus Problems on 3 Canon 70d's.
B00DMS0LCO,17,7,Focus issue???? Sign the petition!
B00DMS0LCO,17,8,I use the same flash setup in the flash's manual mode, without using FEL, and adjust the power down to say 1/2 or 1/4 or somewhere in between, the photos seem properly exposed (as long as I dial in the correct flash power adjustment).
B00DMS0LCO,17,9,Defective in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,10,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,17,11,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,17,12,Image quality in low light a bit noisy- Auto-Focus on the center focus point required +17 manual focus adjustment with a new 50mm f1.4.
B00DMS0LCO,17,13,Video focus tracking only worked half the time when handheld.
B00DMS0LCO,17,14,Half of the still photos were not clearly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,17,15,Note, MFA adjustments only apply to P, Av, Tv and M modes.Search for Youtube video "70D Bad Focus Issues" by CameraRec Toby for more info on the focusing issue.
B00DMS0LCO,17,16,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,17,17,Fantastic camera held back by poor software and auto focus issues.
B00DMS0LCO,17,18,It also chooses a high ISO when using the flash (like 1600) guaranteeing some graininess.
B00DMS0LCO,17,19,I have had a DSLR previously, but always kept it in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,20,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,17,21,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,17,22,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,17,23,Focussing with live view is no problem but focussing correctly when using fast lenses (Sigma f1.8) through the viewfinder results in many missed shots.
B00DMS0LCO,17,24,Simply compose a shot, touch the specific point on the Live View screen and the 70d can be set up to quickly focus on that spot and shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,18,0,I wish I can assign the WB to a button, but you can not.
B00DMS0LCO,18,1,Example: you can not assign the buttons you like.
B00DMS0LCO,18,2,It does not remember it.And so many cons.7.Focus, for the second time: Only good for stationary subject.
B00DMS0LCO,18,3,I had to get mine replaced  because the shutter button suddenly stopped bouncing back up.
B00DMS0LCO,18,4,It was snapping and noisyThe onboard microphone was just as bad.
B00DMS0LCO,18,5,I am still trying to figure out how to hold the camera so that I can tap on the back viewing screen where I want the focus.
B00DMS0LCO,18,6,It just shows how many "clicks" are on your shutter, in your camera.
B00DMS0LCO,18,7,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,18,8,I really need to use a mono-pod or tri-pod but this seems a hassle especially for action shots.
B00DMS0LCO,18,9,What you will notice a difference in is the rate at which photos can be shot and processed.
B00DMS0LCO,18,10,Coupled with the fact you have just 1 custom WB, is a difficult job.6.Program shift: you have to do it for every single shot if you shoot in P mood.
B00DMS0LCO,18,11,The redesign of button locations on the rear of the camera make for a fluid interface to the menus screens while maintaining the appeal that higher quality SLRs have had with dedicate Aperature and Shutter speed wheels.
B00DMS0LCO,18,12,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,18,13,Snapping and noisy and well worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,18,14,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,18,15,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,18,16,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,18,17,Long exposure behavior (I use it for astro pictures at 2-5 minute exposure) is really no difference to the already great T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,18,18,It would still work but it was not tactile.
B00DMS0LCO,18,19,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,18,20,I was very anxious for this camera to arrive with all the hype about its enhanced focusing attributes especially for LiveView and in Movie mode.
B00DMS0LCO,18,21,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,18,22,The camera is nice and good, but over rated.It has many cons, some are serious, example:1.Build quality, no way close to a $1000 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,18,23,I tried 3 cameras and all have the same problem.
B00DMS0LCO,18,24,I don't care how good it works, give me form and function!!
B00DMS0LCO,19,0,When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't.
B00DMS0LCO,19,1,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,19,2,Arrived quickly as promised, but would not recognize or format mem card.
B00DMS0LCO,19,3,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,19,4,Here are some cons to think about if they effect you:- Cannot sync full sized JPG and RAW files to Android- Cannot directly upload to Facebook or my TV via DLNA- Cannot take video while WIFI is enabled- Does not support USB 3.0- No IR focus headlight.
B00DMS0LCO,19,5,Without using FEL, the pictures are way underexposed.If
B00DMS0LCO,19,6,My only real disappointment is that it does not have a built-in GPS sensor and I haven't figured out how to make the Canon IOS app work with the GPS.
B00DMS0LCO,19,7,It does however lack a good amount of creative features within the camera for video recording.
B00DMS0LCO,19,8,anyone using Lightroom 4.4 or lower this camera is not compatible with the CR2 aka RAW files for editing.
B00DMS0LCO,19,9,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,19,10,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,19,11,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,19,12,Same results with bouncing the flash off the ceiling.
B00DMS0LCO,19,13,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,19,14,Radio Shack folks provided several types listed in the manual as acceptable , but none worked.
B00DMS0LCO,19,15,NOT COOL.I have 2 after market batteries that would no charge on this charger .Bummer I then ordered an aftermarket charger for 5 $ no big deal.
B00DMS0LCO,19,16,I guess I'll have to resort to FEL use, but that amount flashes takes a toll on an infant.
B00DMS0LCO,19,17,What you will notice a difference in is the rate at which photos can be shot and processed.
B00DMS0LCO,19,18,She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one.
B00DMS0LCO,19,19,I am an amateur photographer and my new 70D that I purchased a couple months ago at B&H; has been doing the same underexposure stunt that so many others have experienced (For example, see in depth discussions by searching the internet for Canon 70D bounce flash underexposure).This occurs whether I'm bouncing the flash off a white ceiling that's about eight feet high or using a Sto-fen diffuser attached to my Canon 430ex II in E-TTL mode.Whether the lens being used is the Canon 15-85 or the 55-250 STM, all low light indoor photos with the diffuser attached and with the flash head tilted 45 degrees, or 180 degrees, or direct facing are very underexposed.
B00DMS0LCO,19,20,But lets me honest, most of us who do photography and cinematography often do all of our editing from computer software outside of the camera ie lightroom/photoshop etc.
B00DMS0LCO,19,21,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,19,22,Nice update to an already strong predecessor for semi-pro photographers...video functionality is unreal.
B00DMS0LCO,19,23,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,19,24,If you shoot RAW you will need to buy the new Adobe Lightroom 5 and update it to the 5.2 version to even get it to view.
B00DMS0LCO,20,0,I also own a Canon PowerShot s95.
B00DMS0LCO,20,1,I've always been a Canon loyalist.
B00DMS0LCO,20,2,Something like a Canon Rebel T5i + Canon EF 28 mm f/1.8 USM may be just what you need.
B00DMS0LCO,20,3,They were polite and blamed them selves not the canon.
B00DMS0LCO,20,4,I currently own a Canon Xti + Tamron 17mm-50mm f/2.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,20,5,No comparison to other offerings from Olympus, Panasonic or Sony.
B00DMS0LCO,20,6,Why I returned 70D+EF 24mm f/1.4 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,20,7,Cameras past and present: canon 5D mark III, Canon 7D (owned currently), Leica M3 35mm film, Canon 60D, And Canon t3iThe nitty gritty on this camera after a week of use:Build/functionality-Its a solid update to the popular 60d dslr.
B00DMS0LCO,20,8,Also the canon is sticking to the 30p.
B00DMS0LCO,20,9,Unless they come up with a fix fairly quickly, I'm not sure I'd ever buy another Canon camera after this.
B00DMS0LCO,20,10,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,20,11,Or better yet....fix it!Update 3/30/14I am sending the camera in for repairsThe lenses I use on this camera are the:- Sigma 1.8 18-35mm- Canon 1.8 85mm- Canon 3.5-5.6
B00DMS0LCO,20,12,I'm not going to restate all the excellent attributes of the camera and lens.
B00DMS0LCO,20,13,It does however lack a good amount of creative features within the camera for video recording.
B00DMS0LCO,20,14,The camera is nice and good, but over rated.It has many cons, some are serious, example:1.Build quality, no way close to a $1000 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,20,15,I consider myself an avid photographer.
B00DMS0LCO,20,16,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,20,17,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,20,18,I realized I might get better results with a better (prime?) lens but I also realized that the camera was just too big and heavy and that I was probably going to leave it home most of the time.
B00DMS0LCO,20,19,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,20,20,Nice update to an already strong predecessor for semi-pro photographers...video functionality is unreal.
B00DMS0LCO,20,21,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,20,22,Maybe I got a bad piece, I still expect better quality control for a camera that cost over a 1000 dollars two stars of for that.
B00DMS0LCO,20,23,One like this and another small P&S; I can carry in my pocket.
B00DMS0LCO,20,24,Most of my lenses are USM or L series which make for much quicker focusing than even the STM but do sacrifice a bit of more noise (still much better than the cheap kit lens tho).Overall this camera is a solid performer.
B00DMS0LCO,21,0,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.
B00DMS0LCO,21,1,I'm using the kit lens (ef-s 18-135 stm).
B00DMS0LCO,21,2,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,21,3,This one did not go on if the lens cap was on, nor could you put the lens cap on if the hood was attached.
B00DMS0LCO,21,4,The replacement started charging from 0-49%.-The rear lens cap on the kit lens was marred noticeably.-The
B00DMS0LCO,21,5,Why I returned 70D+EF 24mm f/1.4 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,21,6,The 70d is quite a bit heavier and the lens is heavy as well.
B00DMS0LCO,21,7,I think this product was opened before I get it.
B00DMS0LCO,21,8,On delivery the box was clearly re-sealed, accessory packaging opened, and other signs of hasty re-packaging evident.
B00DMS0LCO,21,9,I currently own a Canon Xti + Tamron 17mm-50mm f/2.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,21,10,I'm not going to restate all the excellent attributes of the camera and lens.
B00DMS0LCO,21,11,But I haven't completely abandoned Canon; I also picked up a Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM that I'll use on the Canon Xti body.Bottom line: the 70D is a fantastic camera.
B00DMS0LCO,21,12,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,21,13,With a zoom that has a variable aperture, it's a hit and miss approach and quite cumbersome.Also, I tried the same lenses attached to my Canon T3i taking the same photos as I did with the 70D using the same flash and diffuser without using FEL.
B00DMS0LCO,21,14,I've always been a Canon loyalist.
B00DMS0LCO,21,15,When i called canon the guy treated me as if I was stupid and was telling me there is no way that there can be a err 30 code because thats a lens error and usually happens after a lot of use.
B00DMS0LCO,21,16,Because my wife and I recently had our first born child, I started searching for a low light camera + lens combo that is capable of autofocusing during video, which the s95 cannot.My search brought me to the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 II USM lens combo.
B00DMS0LCO,21,17,When I get the battery, there is no power in it.
B00DMS0LCO,21,18,I appreciate the ability to fine tune the autofocus plus or minus if any lens combination were to yield consistent front or back focusing issues.
B00DMS0LCO,21,19,The focusing appeared to be very fast and accurate except later I found most of my images were not properly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,21,20,The included strap was from a 5D, not 70D, and (I now know having bought another) that packaging was missing.
B00DMS0LCO,21,21,While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,21,22,I can put the s95 in my pocket; can't do that with the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4.
B00DMS0LCO,21,23,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,21,24,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,22,0,Without using FEL, the pictures are way underexposed.If
B00DMS0LCO,22,1,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,22,2,Images are softer than expected.
B00DMS0LCO,22,3,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,22,4,She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one.
B00DMS0LCO,22,5,Should be better in 2013.
B00DMS0LCO,22,6,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,22,7,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,22,8,High Image Quality from Poor light, quick focusing moving subjects, .... were my primary intend for this.
B00DMS0LCO,22,9,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,22,10,It also chooses a high ISO when using the flash (like 1600) guaranteeing some graininess.
B00DMS0LCO,22,11,Half of the still photos were not clearly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,22,12,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,22,13,Same results with bouncing the flash off the ceiling.
B00DMS0LCO,22,14,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,22,15,I have tried most of the tests, micro-adjustments, and other recommendations for those with similar problems, but nothing gives me a consistent focused picture.
B00DMS0LCO,22,16,(with decent light conditions)Color Saturation and Image quality were good (with decent light)7fps was fast enough for me.Weather resistance was useful.Tilt screen was useful.18-135
B00DMS0LCO,22,17,The photos all came out looking perfect with no underexposure whatsoever.
B00DMS0LCO,22,18,a leap in continous AF (in good light).
B00DMS0LCO,22,19,The focusing appeared to be very fast and accurate except later I found most of my images were not properly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,22,20,All photos with and without FEL were properly exposed and looked great.I use bounce flash indoors a lot for our one year old granddaughter.
B00DMS0LCO,22,21,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,22,22,But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,22,23,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,22,24,Also I have not compared it to any products by Nikon - the review below is only for Canon folks.I will start with the negatives first.The Ugly:Plasticky Dial :Canon- Please use metal for the heavily used parts.The Bad:Noise: There is considerable noise in low light both in photos and videos.(realistic
B00DMS0LCO,23,0,See the Amazon review by Mr. Ralph J. Secoy.
B00DMS0LCO,23,1,If you get a camera that is used I would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one.
B00DMS0LCO,23,2,Do not buy a 70D from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,3,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,4,I bought two and both were defective out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,23,5,But I decided to buy the Sony because of all the rave reviews I've read; it should meet my needs (hasn't arrived yet).
B00DMS0LCO,23,6,I purchased this camera about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,23,7,It will be returned.
B00DMS0LCO,23,8,Got a used camera from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,9,I really liked this camera but had to return it for a defect.
B00DMS0LCO,23,10,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,23,11,Returned for replacement - hope it's OK!
B00DMS0LCO,23,12,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,23,13,This particular purchase was a gift for my sister in Europe, ordered four days before my recent trip.
B00DMS0LCO,23,14,At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,15,so needless to say I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.
B00DMS0LCO,23,16,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,23,17,Got a USED EOS 70D From Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,18,I'm honestly beginning to wonder if Amazon buys some manufacturer's QC rejects for a discounted price.Triple check everything you buy from Amazon for defects and also verify that you haven't bought a counterfeit item.
B00DMS0LCO,23,19,Amazon is selling used cameras as new!
B00DMS0LCO,23,20,OK, this is a first for me when dealing with Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,21,I've always been a Canon loyalist.
B00DMS0LCO,23,22,Disappointing Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,23,23,I researched this camera well online before deciding to purchase.
B00DMS0LCO,23,24,I should've bought a replacement for the Canon PowerShot s95.So I sent the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 back and purchased the Sony RX100 II.
B00DMS0LCO,24,0,Radio Shack folks provided several types listed in the manual as acceptable , but none worked.
B00DMS0LCO,24,1,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,24,2,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,24,3,Read their review.
B00DMS0LCO,24,4,This Canon EOS 70D sold by Amazon.com
B00DMS0LCO,24,5,I don't care how good it works, give me form and function!!
B00DMS0LCO,24,6,does not have Wi-Fi capability, the opposite of the original product description on the Canon USA website.
B00DMS0LCO,24,7,I hate the feel!!
B00DMS0LCO,24,8,The menu wheel feels like it cost $2 bucks and should be on a $40.00 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,24,9,The Sony RX10 has 3 custom WB and the 70D has just one.5.WB: if you want to chance the custom WB, you have to go and dig into the main menu.
B00DMS0LCO,24,10,give me one that feels like a pro camera (like you did with the 40D).
B00DMS0LCO,24,11,Liking the new features having moved up from a canon t3i.
B00DMS0LCO,24,12,If I can't buy a Pro camera for $4000.00
B00DMS0LCO,24,13,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,24,14,That middle level just below Pro and way above consumer.
B00DMS0LCO,24,15,These buttons are customized via the custom controls and i have mine set up for back button focusing.If you have already mastered your Txi Rebel or other entry level DSLR and want to step up without going to a full frame, the 70D is the best choice.
B00DMS0LCO,24,16,Also the canon is sticking to the 30p.
B00DMS0LCO,24,17,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,24,18,Smaller profile than its predecessor however the grip and feel of the camera still remains solid.
B00DMS0LCO,24,19,Example: you can not assign the buttons you like.
B00DMS0LCO,24,20,I often take photos of birds in flight and I got a lot more keepers compared to my other bodies.
B00DMS0LCO,24,21,Most of my lenses are USM or L series which make for much quicker focusing than even the STM but do sacrifice a bit of more noise (still much better than the cheap kit lens tho).Overall this camera is a solid performer.
B00DMS0LCO,24,22,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,24,23,The added perk of the New touch screen technology from the T4i and T5i have greatly improved the speed to many obscure functions sometimes needed in the depths of software.
B00DMS0LCO,24,24,It does not remember it.And so many cons.7.Focus, for the second time: Only good for stationary subject.
B00DMS0LCO,25,0,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,25,1,Focus issue???? Sign the petition!
B00DMS0LCO,25,2,Or better yet....fix it!Update 3/30/14I am sending the camera in for repairsThe lenses I use on this camera are the:- Sigma 1.8 18-35mm- Canon 1.8 85mm- Canon 3.5-5.6
B00DMS0LCO,25,3,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,25,4,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,25,5,I had not heard of any focusing issues but a quick internet search on "70D focus issues" yielded a large volume of unhappy customers who have spent a lot of time researching the issue.
B00DMS0LCO,25,6,If you agree please sign the petition here and maybe we can get Canon to change this:[...]Update 3/27/14:Check out this video for more info: www dot youtube dot com / watch?v=cA6JnzYSDJEThis is a real problem and if I could still return the camera I would.CANON PLEASE RESPOND.
B00DMS0LCO,25,7,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,25,8,Based on all the great reviews, it may only be only some batches - I do not know.
B00DMS0LCO,25,9,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,25,10,I have tried most of the tests, micro-adjustments, and other recommendations for those with similar problems, but nothing gives me a consistent focused picture.
B00DMS0LCO,25,11,I gave it a 1 star because of the customer service I received from canon not for the camera itself because i never got see how the camera performs.
B00DMS0LCO,25,12,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,25,13,Simply put, I upgraded the wrong camera.
B00DMS0LCO,25,14,In my case Tamron service was aware of the issue and under warranty upgraded my lenses firmware and now everything works perfectly.
B00DMS0LCO,25,15,I thought about getting a replacement but worried about quality control.UPDATE:  I decided to take a chance and purchase a replacement 70D (from a different online retailer this time) and I'm having similar focus issues with it.
B00DMS0LCO,25,16,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,25,17,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,25,18,Over priced not a full frame sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,25,19,But I haven't completely abandoned Canon; I also picked up a Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM that I'll use on the Canon Xti body.Bottom line: the 70D is a fantastic camera.
B00DMS0LCO,25,20,I really like the camera but there may be one big flaw.
B00DMS0LCO,25,21,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,25,22,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,25,23,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,25,24,Plus, it's hard to get candid shots when an FEL pre-flash is being used.This isn't what I bargained for when I "upgraded" my camera body.I'm now wondering if this will negatively effect exposures on outside fill flash photos with a diffuser attached.The fact that Canon hasn't addressed this yet is disconcerting to say the least.
