B005IHAIMA,0,0,Battery lasts for a while.
B005IHAIMA,0,1,I just like to recomand this camera, he is great and a very good price.
B005IHAIMA,0,2,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,0,3,My Canon batteries charge from empty to full power in under 2 hours.-
B005IHAIMA,0,4,This should be equated into the total cost of ownership if a viewfinder is important to the consumer.The battery life seems good for now.
B005IHAIMA,0,5,Very good camera and a very good image.
B005IHAIMA,0,6,have a nice day
B005IHAIMA,0,7,few years back I had a bad taste for Sony due to their camera's being battery (AA) for most styles.
B005IHAIMA,0,8,The flash feeds off the main battery, which can be good and bad.
B005IHAIMA,0,9,I can't say enough good thing about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,0,10,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,0,11,This needs to be corrected!!! Also, Sony's new thing with their cameras is that they will ONLY take a Sony battery.
B005IHAIMA,0,12,I do get significantly more barrel distortion from the SONY 18-55mm lens than from the Canon 17mm-85mm.BATTERYNEX-5N comes with a separate battery recharger, which is handy since the camera drains the battery rather fast it is nice to have a spare battery charging while the camera is being used.
B005IHAIMA,0,13,If you are bringing it along, you have to make the commitment that you'll be carrying a larger camera bag.Like most good cameras, the battery is rechargeable.
B005IHAIMA,0,14,I carry 3 batteries total so running out of juice has not been an issue.
B005IHAIMA,0,15,Not exactly efficient, but at least the menus are not hard to navigate or use.The Bad:Battery life - Perhaps I am spoiled, but when I go out for a whole day of shooting pictures and video, I expect the battery to last the whole day.
B005IHAIMA,0,16,This can be considered a pro too, as Sony did a great job with the regular controls.Pros:The battery lasts a good long time.
B005IHAIMA,0,17,But you probably already know that so I thought I'd mention a few of the cons... none of which would make me downgrade my rating, but could be important to you.CONS (The pros would take too long to write):- The battery takes FOREVER to charge, it took an hour on a new and empty batter just to get enough charge to format my SD card, overnight for a full charge.
B005IHAIMA,0,18,I must have mistaken this feature from some other camera I was researching.At this time, the only real negative I can find is the battery door.
B005IHAIMA,0,19,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,0,20,I figured the battery was dead, so I threw it on the charger.
B005IHAIMA,0,21,I purchased a 3-d party (Wasabi) battery pack (two NP-FW50 batteries, one Wasabi AC charger, one car charger converter for Wasabi AC charger, European converter) which works well with my NEX-5N.
B005IHAIMA,0,22,At the end of the day, does it take amazing quality photos?
B005IHAIMA,0,23,The pictures are excellent.
B005IHAIMA,0,24,This Sony is no SD1000 in size, but I got a small Sony case for the Sony NEX-5N and it is never in the way.It works great with my Eye-Fi card.
B005IHAIMA,1,0,Try it and you'll see.I also like the articulated LCD on the back, and the touch screen, and the simplicity of the menus.
B005IHAIMA,1,1,I recommend getting a screen protector.
B005IHAIMA,1,2,Also the screen is susceptible to scratches.
B005IHAIMA,1,3,Very stealth with the flipout screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,4,Overall the screen is quite good and I only miss it in very bright sun.-
B005IHAIMA,1,5,It has a great lcd screen and the best of any of the mirrorless cameras I have tried.
B005IHAIMA,1,6,Tap the screen to focus during movie (haven't tried it for photo--haven't tried it because touch screen so new to me on a camera).
B005IHAIMA,1,7,Since the screen on this camera is adjustable, can't see a need for it anyway.
B005IHAIMA,1,8,My only problem is that I have polarized sunglasses, and when I wear them, I can't see the image on the display screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,9,With the screen articulated to face up, taking photos is quick and easy.
B005IHAIMA,1,10,The touch screen is nice that wasn't in NEX-5, and so with NEX-5N you can operate the mode dials or touch the screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,11,The LCD screen on the R1 will swivel a full 360 degrees!
B005IHAIMA,1,12,Such crisp images and such a great preview screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,13,The first way is handheld, and using its rear LCD screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,14,the screen cover is high quality and I would recommend to anyone with a Nex5 camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,15,Easy control and settings with touch screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,16,The tilting screen is a great thing, but it doesn't flip around (although it does on the NEX F3), so you can't see yourself.-
B005IHAIMA,1,17,Great Fun.
B005IHAIMA,1,18,It flips up and out away from the camera body so you can hold it at waist or chest height or above your head and still have a perfect view of the screen (45 degrees down/80 degrees up).
B005IHAIMA,1,19,You can customize 3 of the buttons on the back of the camera, and that helps tremendously, but there are still several things I wish were more readily available without fumbling through the menu.There is no viewfinder so you must frame your photos using the LCD screen, which can be difficult in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,1,20,Initially, I was impressed with the thought of a touch screen camera because I am a Smartphone user and have grown to love touch screens, but after testing I really prefer not to use it on this camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,21,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,22,Love the images and the size.
B005IHAIMA,1,23,I also enjoy composing my shots using the adjustable angle screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,24,You MUST buy a the screen protector for this product as it is prone to damage over time.
B005IHAIMA,2,0,I can either have a viewfinder of a flash on, not both.
B005IHAIMA,2,1,Great upgrade or go-to camera.
B005IHAIMA,2,2,Anyway camera showed up, needed a firmware upgrade which was super easy and I am in love.
B005IHAIMA,2,3,Now that Sony has fixed it, it's a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,2,4,With the latest firmware update, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,2,5,I'm an employee in an electronics store and work in the camera department.
B005IHAIMA,2,6,I love it.
B005IHAIMA,2,7,It's an excellent viewfinder, but it's an extra outlay of cash.
B005IHAIMA,2,8,Instead, I would just upgrade to the NEX 7 or another Sony NEX model that comes with the electronic viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,2,9,A view finder, which is lacking, would be a great help.The stabilization is not as good as on the Panasonic FZ150 and I find that with the Sony, my videos are pretty "wobbly."
B005IHAIMA,2,10,I love it.
B005IHAIMA,2,11,Took this ice climbing (with the fixed 1.8/50mm which I love) and portrait-style/climber in action pictures were excellent.
B005IHAIMA,2,12,So if you have any substantial money in lenses that are not E-mount, pick something else.If you get the viewfinder, you have to pick between a flash, or the viewfinder, or the microphone.
B005IHAIMA,2,13,I can't say enough good thing about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,2,14,Love it!!!! Love it love it!!!!
B005IHAIMA,2,15,The lan is very perfect as well.
B005IHAIMA,2,16,The camera is perfect.
B005IHAIMA,2,17,It would be nice if Sony released a firmware update that would enable a setting for maximum ISO.Overall, this is a wonderful camera and I highly recommend it.
B005IHAIMA,2,18,There is a separate electronic viewfinder here on Amazon but the price is just a bit out of my comfort range.
B005IHAIMA,2,19,I am upgraded from the M43 and I would say I am very satisfied with it.
B005IHAIMA,2,20,Not what my D7000 delivers, but it gets the job done once you know how to work the camera to this adventages.
B005IHAIMA,2,21,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,2,22,Super sexy design first off...In silver, this piece of art is like a spy camera symphony, which becomes visually deafening with the additional flash and view finder attached.In my hand the camera is super small w/o a lens.
B005IHAIMA,2,23,The latest firmware update allows users to set auto-exposure bracketing to as wide as 3 stops per shot.
B005IHAIMA,2,24,I have heard that the electronic viewfinder (sold separately) for this camera is amazing but at $300 more it just hasn't been worth it for me to buy it.
B005IHAIMA,3,0,Video Quality is stellar as well.
B005IHAIMA,3,1,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,2,I wanted it for the video quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,3,No clicking sound whatsoever.
B005IHAIMA,3,4,Great value.
B005IHAIMA,3,5,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,6,Good for still photo.
B005IHAIMA,3,7,Image quality is stellar.
B005IHAIMA,3,8,The best value and quality for $650.
B005IHAIMA,3,9,But my impression is very good.At first, I was very anxious about the clicking sound during video recording and I was glad that it was not present.
B005IHAIMA,3,10,great portability and great image quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,11,The defect does not affect the picture quality of still images or video, but it does make the video recording feature unusable as the clicking noise is very noticeable.
B005IHAIMA,3,12,Do a search on Vimeo to see the video quality, you will be impressed.
B005IHAIMA,3,13,Great image quality but try before you buy.
B005IHAIMA,3,14,The video recording is excellent and clear.
B005IHAIMA,3,15,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,16,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,3,17,My quick interview-style video with my wife was broadcast quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,18,But it must go back, the sound is uncalled for.
B005IHAIMA,3,19,A great camera for photographing, but not for video recording.
B005IHAIMA,3,20,Everything is good except the annoying click noise in video mode.
B005IHAIMA,3,21,the video quality is really superb.
B005IHAIMA,3,22,I desperately want to love this camera based on its image and video quality alone.
B005IHAIMA,3,23,I couldn't have taken it with the R1.And the video.
B005IHAIMA,3,24,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,4,0,Tried out the manual modes, but mostly just used Auto because that is what I wanted.
B005IHAIMA,4,1,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,4,2,great camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,3,Great pictures from a compact camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,4,This is a great camera!
B005IHAIMA,4,5,Low light shots are amazing so far.
B005IHAIMA,4,6,Only took 250 shots so far.
B005IHAIMA,4,7,For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,8,However, this camera shoots DSLR quality photos that are amazing in auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,9,I have only used it once but it was at night outside and the pictures where amazing.
B005IHAIMA,4,10,Amazing picture quality in auto mode - I gave up on my DSLR largely because I am such an amateur photographer that I could never get the settings right to take a great photo.
B005IHAIMA,4,11,As he has been using a DSLR for awhile now, the unclear settings didn't set him back as much as us.
B005IHAIMA,4,12,Great transition camera from point and shoots, works as well as most DSLR!!!
B005IHAIMA,4,13,It takes great pictures in a wide variety of settings.
B005IHAIMA,4,14,Instead, it takes amazing low light pictures (even in a mostly dark room) in auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,15,The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.
B005IHAIMA,4,16,The good thing was, I hardly needed to use it even at night because it was so amazing at adjusting to the setting.
B005IHAIMA,4,17,Takes great low light photos- I rarely use the flash with this camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,18,This camera puts forth such great, quality photos in auto mode that I usually do not have to do much editing to get a great picture to share.4)
B005IHAIMA,4,19,Perfect size, lots of features, takes great pictures, even when it is dark.
B005IHAIMA,4,20,I use the Auto mode basically all the time.
B005IHAIMA,4,21,A fun auto stiching panorama mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,22,Even video taken in low light can look good.
B005IHAIMA,4,23,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,4,24,I cannot begin to say enough good thing about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,5,0,I've never owned a camera that could take so many pictures so quickly.
B005IHAIMA,5,1,In evening events like volleyball and soccer, I used ISO 800 and 1600 to still get fast shutter to stop the action.
B005IHAIMA,5,2,(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,5,3,The lens is light, but feels substantial.
B005IHAIMA,5,4,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,5,5,So far, the freedom to set shutter speed for motion shots has been the most fun.
B005IHAIMA,5,6,I wanted something to take pictures of my fast moving children.
B005IHAIMA,5,7,Autofocus is fast and works well for pictures of my kids.
B005IHAIMA,5,8,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,5,9,I also noticed the same exact spots when is happened to use iso 100 and 1 second shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,5,10,The images are superb, the start up time and shooting speed are fast!
B005IHAIMA,5,11,Everyone is in awe when they here the rapid-fire.The shutter also makes a nice "mechanical" sound when you take a shot.
B005IHAIMA,5,12,;)Start-up time is very fast, and shot-to-shot time is even faster.
B005IHAIMA,5,13,Most cameras have to use slow shutter speeds indoors in ambient light, because they just can't control noise and smear at ISO 800 and above.
B005IHAIMA,5,14,I've tried adjusting shutter speed, ISO, etc and still didn't have much luck.
B005IHAIMA,5,15,So, I cannot takes photos at weddings with this camera, I cannot take photos at sports events (Golf mainly) with this camera and cannot take photos of my grandchildren with this camera.
B005IHAIMA,5,16,There is no lag whatsoever from when the shutter is pressed and released!
B005IHAIMA,5,17,The most important for me is that it does not have a mode that in I can shoot in RAW while having a minimum shutter of at least, say, 1/125s for shooting my kids activities.
B005IHAIMA,5,18,Shots are brighter and cleaner than any shots I've ever seen from a digital.The fast continuous shooting mode is impressive.
B005IHAIMA,5,19,Low light shots are amazing so far.
B005IHAIMA,5,20,It shoots so fast, just click and try the next setting up or down for aperture, shutter or ISO and then click again to see how it affects the picture (keeping in mind the camera will automatically adjust the other two for the correct amount of light)!
B005IHAIMA,5,21,:) OH! and picture quality is pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,5,22,Yes, beautiful photos, fast continuous shooting.
B005IHAIMA,5,23,Great transition camera from point and shoots, works as well as most DSLR!!!
B005IHAIMA,5,24,It has made a world of difference in my speed of shooting.
B005IHAIMA,6,0,The include flash...is a flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,1,I can either have a viewfinder of a flash on, not both.
B005IHAIMA,6,2,Want a shot with flash -- just pop up the attachable flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,3,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,6,4,I got this with my sony card and it was expensive but worth every dime.
B005IHAIMA,6,5,The pictures are excellent.
B005IHAIMA,6,6,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,6,7,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,6,8,Now that Sony has fixed it, it's a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,6,9,Perfect size, lots of features, takes great pictures, even when it is dark.
B005IHAIMA,6,10,You can buy third-party adapters, but those look a little unstable for mounting a big flash unit to the camera.
B005IHAIMA,6,11,I do very little direct flash lighting, so it's not something I would use much.I have ordered the optional flash, which has bounce options.
B005IHAIMA,6,12,I inserted the memory card into my laptop and was able to confirm that the images turned out good.
B005IHAIMA,6,13,The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,14,Small but powerful, excellent quality.
B005IHAIMA,6,15,It is great taking pictures indoor and outdoor.It looks good and has a good grip to take pictures comfortably.
B005IHAIMA,6,16,We were working with the 18-55 lens and also the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,6,17,Awesome Still Images and Video Quality.
B005IHAIMA,6,18,I HIGHLY recommend this camera, as well as the 18-55 lens, the 16mm and the fisheye adapter and an extra battery, as well as a large fast memory chip (64GB Komputer Bay class 10 works very well); and the extra audio adapter (but only if you plan to take advantage of the excellent 1080p video).
B005IHAIMA,6,19,Overall I think it is a very nice design.The video appears to be good too.
B005IHAIMA,6,20,The following items were included along with the camera: warranty card, paper manual for the NEX-3/NEX-3C/NEX-5/NEX-5C, software disk, neck strap, usb cable, battery and charger and flash accessory with its respectable case.FIRST IMPRESSIONSI knew this camera was going to be small and compact, but when I took it out of its protective bag, it was even smaller than I anticipated.
B005IHAIMA,6,21,Glad i bought it.I paid $623 on EBAY and mine came with a 18/55MM Lens, flash, a small SONY tote bag, 4GB SD Card, and charger/battery.
B005IHAIMA,6,22,Still, the flash quirk aside, this is a great camera for traveling or walking around.
B005IHAIMA,6,23,Video Quality is stellar as well.
B005IHAIMA,6,24,It's unfortunate that the optional viewfinder is a rather expensive investment at $348 and it takes up the flash location when in use.The flash is removable and has numerous positions for fill, bounce or direct lighting.
B005IHAIMA,7,0,great portability and great image quality.
B005IHAIMA,7,1,I'm using 21/4 Skopar, 28/3.5 Skopar, 35/1.7 Ultron, 50/1.5 Ultron with great results.
B005IHAIMA,7,2,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,7,3,Great value.
B005IHAIMA,7,4,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,7,5,Compact camera with DSLR quality.
B005IHAIMA,7,6,I have for the last 10 years just had a canon powershot that I could put in my pocket.
B005IHAIMA,7,7,The compact size of a point-and-shoot camera with the quality of a DSLR one.
B005IHAIMA,7,8,Best of the Compact Camera lines.
B005IHAIMA,7,9,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,7,10,With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.
B005IHAIMA,7,11,I also have a Canon G11 (which I love)This is a great in between a DSLR and a POcket cam.
B005IHAIMA,7,12,Olympus Zoom 70 to 150mm, all with delicious results.
B005IHAIMA,7,13,If you wnat a small package and great quality this is it.
B005IHAIMA,7,14,I used this for well over year now, a lot, and I think it's great.
B005IHAIMA,7,15,I seemed to take better pictures overall even though it was slightly larger.
B005IHAIMA,7,16,great buy worth every penny
B005IHAIMA,7,17,Also, while 55mm doesn't sound like much, with 16 megapixels and the camera's super-easy way of zooming in on the pics you have taken, it is easy to zoom in after the shot is taken and still get excellent resolution.
B005IHAIMA,7,18,I own the canon elph 300hs and the nikon d3100 and this by far beats both.
B005IHAIMA,7,19,The pictures are excellent.
B005IHAIMA,7,20,No need to carry around a bulky DSLR camera.
B005IHAIMA,7,21,:) OH! and picture quality is pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,7,22,So close to greatness... First, I would like to note that I have owned digital cameras since 1999 including compacts, midsize and DSLRs.
B005IHAIMA,7,23,this is for people who want better quality pics than point and shoot, but doesn't want to carry around those 1-ton DSLRs.
B005IHAIMA,7,24,Easy to use, lightweight, stylish, and it takes dslr quality pictures.
B005IHAIMA,8,0,Negatif yani ise lens portfoyunun zayif olmasi.
B005IHAIMA,8,1,I'm okay with the kit lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,2,So far I only have the 16mm and the kit 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,3,Ama Sony Nex-5n tum fikrimi degistirdi.
B005IHAIMA,8,4,A great Prime Lens for the Nex e-mount Sony 50mm f/1.8 Mid-Range Lens for Sony E Mount Nex Cameras4.
B005IHAIMA,8,5,If you buy one, get the kit with the 18-55 lens which represents the best value.
B005IHAIMA,8,6,I cannot say it was outperformed by say, Nikkor's kit lens in any way.
B005IHAIMA,8,7,Lens for Sony NEX Cameras.
B005IHAIMA,8,8,Compared to DSLR, m43, Point/Shoot, NEX 3, NEX C3.
B005IHAIMA,8,9,Dug up a basket of great legacy lenses to try on the Nex 5n.
B005IHAIMA,8,10,For this reason, it is inevitable and also advantageous to use one's dSLR lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.I am able to use my Nikon F-mount lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.
B005IHAIMA,8,11,So I bought the NEX-5N with the 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,12,After dragging an 18MP dSLR with 18-200 lens to Disneyland and taking only 200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,8,13,Lens are somewhat limited at this point, but with lenses adapters the possibilities are endless.
B005IHAIMA,8,14,I purchased the Nex 5N with the 18-55mm kit lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,15,(Other than more lenses)
B005IHAIMA,8,16,With a pancake lens like the Sony 16mm, the weight and size approximates an XZ2 or LX7.Also, when you point this camera and the pancake lens at a person, there is no "DSLR intimidation" and frown....
B005IHAIMA,8,17,Try finding an 18mm lens for a dSLR, it'll cost as much as the body itself.
B005IHAIMA,8,18,For a kit lens, I am impressed.
B005IHAIMA,8,19,Goodbye DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,8,20,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.
B005IHAIMA,8,21,My current lens of choice is a asahi supertak 50mm f1.4 lens, using an m42 adapter.
B005IHAIMA,8,22,Review of the Sony NEX-5N by a dSLR owner.
B005IHAIMA,8,23,You may like to look for a good used Sony 16mm pancake lens, or a used 16-50 power zoom, as I did.B./
B005IHAIMA,8,24,It's sensor is one of the sharpest sensors I've ever seen.
B005IHAIMA,9,0,Image quality is stellar.
B005IHAIMA,9,1,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,9,2,Picture quality is excellent especially low light pics.
B005IHAIMA,9,3,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,9,4,Even video taken in low light can look good.
B005IHAIMA,9,5,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,9,6,The camera produces really high quality pictures!
B005IHAIMA,9,7,I always wanted a camera that could take DSLR quality images without the size.
B005IHAIMA,9,8,very good camera.
B005IHAIMA,9,9,Video Quality is stellar as well.
B005IHAIMA,9,10,A camcoder can't be any better regarding picture.
B005IHAIMA,9,11,Great image quality but try before you buy.
B005IHAIMA,9,12,It's small and light.
B005IHAIMA,9,13,The picture quality is just nuts from a camera at this price.
B005IHAIMA,9,14,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,9,15,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.

B005IHAIMA,10,22,This is a great value for the money.
B005IHAIMA,10,23,This camera has it all and can do it all, and for damn near 1/2 the price of its competitors.
B005IHAIMA,10,24,I reviewed this camera to the Nikon 1 J1 and ultimately went with this camera instead.
B005IHAIMA,11,0,I found this camera very easy to use.
B005IHAIMA,11,1,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,2,I was looking for a camera which was small in size but was great in taking pictures.

B005IHAIMA,11,20,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,11,21,Really a good cameraI.
B005IHAIMA,11,22,I have been asked a several times if I am a professional photographer (No! It's just a great camera!).
B005IHAIMA,11,23,If you wnat a small package and great quality this is it.
B005IHAIMA,11,24,it's pretty good for girls to have one~
B005IHAIMA,12,0,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,1,Sony does it all.
B005IHAIMA,12,2,Sony camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,3,What surprised me was the quality of HD video.
B005IHAIMA,12,4,Takes outstanding pictures and video.
B005IHAIMA,12,5,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,12,6,Amazing camera at an amazing price - review for Video.
B005IHAIMA,12,7,mainly got this for video, and for the size, so i will not review picture quality (its been done plenty of times).video is amazing, especially coming from a t2i, and using my gf's t4i. the best part is - true autofocus during video.
B005IHAIMA,12,8,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,9,Have used it for a while and this really makes a difference when you are using a Sony High End Camera with Accessaries from Sony
B005IHAIMA,12,10,I love this camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,11,It shoots 24p and 60p video at full 1080 resolution.
B005IHAIMA,12,12,Awesome Still Images and Video Quality.
B005IHAIMA,12,13,Check out video quality of "hungry seagulls" on U-tube.
B005IHAIMA,12,14,Although I did not expect the replacement for NEX 5 to be much better than the C3 except for video and I did not really use video that much and 720p was good enough for me.
B005IHAIMA,12,15,Great cam for taking videos and having always around.
B005IHAIMA,12,16,I upgraded my point and shoot to this Sony and couldn't be more pleased.
B005IHAIMA,12,17,The Sony A55 was perhaps good enough, fast auto-focus even in video, good images, but much too big; I wanted a NEX 5 but with the quality of a A580.
B005IHAIMA,12,18,Overall I think it is a very nice design.The video appears to be good too.
B005IHAIMA,12,19,See our Demo Reel goldencirclemovie all was shot on Sony NEX5N's the most amazing camera for the price!
B005IHAIMA,12,20,The best value and quality for $650.
B005IHAIMA,12,21,and canon fd 75-200mm lenses.The clicking issue was fixed by Sony in 5 days.
B005IHAIMA,12,22,I love the camera as a photo camera, but waited for this NEX over the previous (NEX-5) specifically for a better video capability - which it has...But...
B005IHAIMA,12,23,Canons are great but Sony has stepped it up and I consider them the new kings of HD video with interchangeable lenses.
B005IHAIMA,12,24,I have not yet checked out the HD movie shooting capabilities that it has because I have the incredible Sony HDR-PJ10 Handycam for my video needs, but I am sure I will play around with this feature just to check it out in the near future.Another outstanding Sony Camera!
B005IHAIMA,13,0,This happens using a (spare) battery used in the NEX-5.
B005IHAIMA,13,1,Battery lasts for a while.
B005IHAIMA,13,2,Wasabi batteries  that I ordered are working too.
B005IHAIMA,13,3,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.
B005IHAIMA,13,4,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,13,5,Not exactly efficient, but at least the menus are not hard to navigate or use.The Bad:Battery life - Perhaps I am spoiled, but when I go out for a whole day of shooting pictures and video, I expect the battery to last the whole day.
B005IHAIMA,13,6,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,13,7,Possibly small ones.Battery life is pretty weak.
B005IHAIMA,13,8,I figured the battery was dead, so I threw it on the charger.
B005IHAIMA,13,9,My Canon batteries charge from empty to full power in under 2 hours.-
B005IHAIMA,13,10,Photos great, video sucks.
B005IHAIMA,13,11,The screen turns blue and flashes 'camera error'.
B005IHAIMA,13,12,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.
B005IHAIMA,13,13,A series of Sony Viao laptops drained their batteries even when the computer was off because there was a design failure and the battery circuit could not be closed.
B005IHAIMA,13,14,This is REALLY disappointing and as much as I wanted to buy this camera, I will not and do not recommend to do so.
B005IHAIMA,13,15,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,13,16,this is one of the best cameras I ever had on image quality I sold my dsrl for this and from a normal person point of view photos are great.Video clicking is a pain in the ...I am from out USA and I can't fix it as I bought it in USA.I never thought I would have the problem with SONY.3 month waiting for the firmware upgrade that will fix the problem, no news.I miss old times SONY.Matias[...]
B005IHAIMA,13,17,If your battery is at 100% after about two minutes of any type of use with the camera it wil be down to 98%.Will last probably eight hours if you went out shooting all day, and made sure to turn it off when not in use.I've heard all the stories about these cameras clicking and overheating during recording a movie and almost didnt buy one because of, but ive not had any problem of the sort, but then again my longest short film is 3:00.I dont like the fact that the flash and viewfinder cannot be used in tandem.
B005IHAIMA,13,18,I have waited to buy it for a long time.
B005IHAIMA,13,19,few years back I had a bad taste for Sony due to their camera's being battery (AA) for most styles.
B005IHAIMA,13,20,Charging took about 4 hours (which is normal) and then the camera fired right up.You will be prompted to set the date & time right away and then you can start enjoying your new toy.When you turn the camera off, the shutter may operate.
B005IHAIMA,13,21,I got the camera back after 8 business days, they also included a spare battery (it did not appear to be a mistake on their part, since they included it in the repair list as a no charge item); thank you Sony for that - its better than a 'sorry for the inconvenience' note.
B005IHAIMA,13,22,However, the battery that gives this error on the camera had a bit of plastic near the connection terminals chipped off, but this shouldn't matter.)-
B005IHAIMA,13,23,But the camera error message came back on while I was on vacation.
B005IHAIMA,13,24,Using this with Eye-Fi card, battery last about 160-200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,14,0,I don't like touch screens.
B005IHAIMA,14,1,You can customize 3 of the buttons on the back of the camera, and that helps tremendously, but there are still several things I wish were more readily available without fumbling through the menu.There is no viewfinder so you must frame your photos using the LCD screen, which can be difficult in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,14,2,Also, the touch screen is incredible.
B005IHAIMA,14,3,the screen is very clear and bright.
B005IHAIMA,14,4,I like that you can adjust the screen for above/below views.
B005IHAIMA,14,5,;-)* The screen is very hard to use in direct sunlight.
B005IHAIMA,14,6,They both involve the screen flickering about 1/2 second after you turn the camera off under different circumstances.
B005IHAIMA,14,7,Can be scratched easily as with all this new touch screen tech out here.
B005IHAIMA,14,8,The camera does even have a single scratch on the body or the screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,9,Now please Sony, just put a better hinge on the LCD panel and a PC socket, so I can use it with a studio flash, this camera really deserves a five star rating... but the lack of flash connector and the limited hinge on the LCD panel are the big failures of the camera.. ....
B005IHAIMA,14,10,If someone is considering both of these cameras let me start with the differences between the two cameras that made me choose NEX-5N.My main issue with C3 was seeing the LCD screen in the sun.
B005IHAIMA,14,11,Tap the screen to focus during movie (haven't tried it for photo--haven't tried it because touch screen so new to me on a camera).
B005IHAIMA,14,12,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,14,13,I lately tested the Lumix LX7 and this point is more apparent than with the sony(very bright saturated on camera's screen and much less on the computer's screen.4.
B005IHAIMA,14,14,but a factor should be put in mind that the photos may appear less bright on computer's screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,15,The most helpful setting was "Big font" under Camera options.
B005IHAIMA,14,16,My only problem is that I have polarized sunglasses, and when I wear them, I can't see the image on the display screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,17,My second complaint is that my unit has a dead pixel smack dab in the middle of the rear LCD panel.
B005IHAIMA,14,18,However, if the object tracking is turned on the focus begins movingand shifting even though the thing you are trying to focus on is not moving.
B005IHAIMA,14,19,Turned off object tracking (located under "Camera" top menu)Why: When you are trying to compose a photo where the focus is NOT in the center, you can use the touch screento indicate where the focus should be.
B005IHAIMA,14,20,I barely ever have to use the flash.
B005IHAIMA,14,21,it can't be assessed as a cons but just compare photos few times and you can expect how they will differ on the computer screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,22,OSS Lens (Silver), you're probably going to need to hang it on your shoulder or use a camera case.The rear articulated touch screen is superb.
B005IHAIMA,14,23,A camcoder can't be any better regarding picture.
B005IHAIMA,14,24,I like cameras with physical buttons, wheels and switches because even though they can look difficult at first, once you figure them out you can operate the camera by feel in the dark and/or in daylight but without plastering your eyes to the rear viewscreen the entire time.
B005IHAIMA,15,0,Upgraded the firmware to newest version, Auto focus is fast!
B005IHAIMA,15,1,the lenses make noise, and focus is slow.on the nex, the lenses are silent for focus, and it focuses instantly.
B005IHAIMA,15,2,My Canon G12 is slow to focus.
B005IHAIMA,15,3,The images are just as great, both in contrast and sharpness, when paired with old manual focus lenses once you get the focused right.
B005IHAIMA,15,4,You can put the focus precisely where you want it, which is great when shooting wide-open.
B005IHAIMA,15,5,Everyone should give manual lenses a shot since the camera offers several options when focuses.
B005IHAIMA,15,6,The camera has inconsistent problem of getting locked up when shooting.
B005IHAIMA,15,7,It's almost a return to cameras of the past with their split-screen viewfinders and MF-only lenses.
B005IHAIMA,15,8,Auto focus is improved but not very fast.The kit lens  18-55 is not the best but can be usable in most situations.
B005IHAIMA,15,9,Nice image quality; poor autofocus.
B005IHAIMA,15,10,However, if the object tracking is turned on the focus begins movingand shifting even though the thing you are trying to focus on is not moving.
B005IHAIMA,15,11,If you buy the viewfinder then you cannot use the enclosed flash while the viewfinder is in use.
B005IHAIMA,15,12,No built in viewfinder - you can buy one for $250 extra but I don't want to spend $250 on a viewfinder - a viewfinder and an extra lens take this camera up to 7N territory in cost which has a lot more than just the viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,15,13,This makes manually focusing a lens a breeze and very quick, not to mention fun.
B005IHAIMA,15,14,Here are improvements over the NEX-5 (although at times the autofocus still tends to be picky on the subject, which is normal--any camera does this when a close tree or plant is the focus instead of getting a clear shot of a distant building, for example)... (Two other cons will be mentioned.)Pros:-
B005IHAIMA,15,15,In time its shortcomings (primarily slow repeat shooting and poor autofocus) came to really bug me and I've moved on to better cameras.
B005IHAIMA,15,16,I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2.
B005IHAIMA,15,17,The camera is very fast to focus and shoot images.
B005IHAIMA,15,18,I tested with kit lens taking the same photos in both auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,15,19,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.
B005IHAIMA,15,20,After it focuses you can also manually fine-tune the focus to your object.
B005IHAIMA,15,21,Plus the flange distance of the mount is so short you can put pretty much ANY lens you want on this thing from Leica/Zeiss/Voigtlander M glass to old Nikon & Canon manual focus lenses.
B005IHAIMA,15,22,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.
B005IHAIMA,15,23,Auto focus is near perfect in good light, and very good in low light.Macro with the kit zoom, using menu setting "Camera - AF/MF - DMF".  can give some pretty nice shots, but you will need to stay 9-10" away with this lens to focus.
B005IHAIMA,15,24,mainly got this for video, and for the size, so i will not review picture quality (its been done plenty of times).video is amazing, especially coming from a t2i, and using my gf's t4i. the best part is - true autofocus during video.
B005IHAIMA,16,0,I call back and Im told that I am already in line to get a call from a Tech.
B005IHAIMA,16,1,Who knows, and at this point, who cares.After one more call to Sony, they said they would have a technician call me, but so far, no one has called.
B005IHAIMA,16,2,Finally I contacted Sony support and they told me that the camera had to be sent in for repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,3,FURTHER UPDATE  ***After dodging my calls, I finally gave up on Sony support.
B005IHAIMA,16,4,The person again states that the Tech is already set to call me.The next day I get the call.
B005IHAIMA,16,5,My first was returned before being aware of the Service Call issued by Sony for the clicking issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,6,My revised rating and review is based off the poor experience with Sony Technical Support and the repair of the issue.I contacted Sony Service using the repair number of my Service Call repair, after receiving my "repaired" 5n and noticing the new sound issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,7,Unfortunately they require that the camera be shipped to a Sony service center for repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,8,I call Sony Service and reference the email about the expedited return and repair as well as my original repair #.
B005IHAIMA,16,9,You sure you want to buy something new at a cost of $700 and send it back straight to the service center and wait for 5 days or more and still have that problem there after it comes back?
B005IHAIMA,16,10,My next camera will probably be a Nikon or a Canon, from a company that actually takes pride in their cameras.
B005IHAIMA,16,11,I just called Sony and they confirmed that the issue is still there and that customers need to send their $700 cameras if they find the clicking issue.I asked them whether they can tell me a way to figure out whether the issue is still present but they said they cannot.
B005IHAIMA,16,12,Defective after Sony Repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,13,Sony is finally acknowledging the problem just not saying what it is and if the fix will completely fix the problem.
B005IHAIMA,16,14,The representative assured me that I would have to ship the camera at my expense but it would be repaired and send back at no charge.
B005IHAIMA,16,15,TBH, Sony customer service was very good and they paid for shipping.
B005IHAIMA,16,16,A day later I received an email advising I would receive a response soon.Two days later I receive an email from a Tech stating they would overnight the body and expedite the repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,17,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,16,18,Again they do call but not when Im available, but do leave a voicemail that I should call back.
B005IHAIMA,16,19,There is an audio clicking problem for this new camera in video mode...
B005IHAIMA,16,20,Audio clicking problem in video mode.
B005IHAIMA,16,21,DO NOT BUY UNTIL SONY ADDRESSES CLICKING ISSUE.
B005IHAIMA,16,22,But back it goes to Sony for repair, since I'm now out of the return period.
B005IHAIMA,16,23,I called early yesterday and still no sign of mine.Sony takes 5-7 days to complete the repair and then returns it to you.Note that it ships GROUND both ways so your camera is out of service for a good few weeks.
B005IHAIMA,16,24,Immediately upon receiving my exhange I sent the body in for the click repair.
B005IHAIMA,17,0,Having the two cameras set up differently means not having to fumble around trying to change menu settings btw auto and manual while on a shoot.
B005IHAIMA,17,1,No auto ISR on Manual mode (some DSLR's will let you do this).Overall,
B005IHAIMA,17,2,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,17,3,As he has been using a DSLR for awhile now, the unclear settings didn't set him back as much as us.
B005IHAIMA,17,4,The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.
B005IHAIMA,17,5,The controls are much better, allowing things like manual focus, manual exposure, etc.
B005IHAIMA,17,6,Manual adjustments....don't be scared....no problem.
B005IHAIMA,17,7,I then used the Right Key Setting on the rotary dial for White Balance, and the Soft Key B Setting for ISO.
B005IHAIMA,17,8,90% of my photos are in program mode so I don't even really adjust aperture or shutter.
B005IHAIMA,17,9,On top of that the camera has no AutoISO in full manual mode and AutoISO is limited to 100-3200.On a DSLR this is less of a problem since it's very quick to switch between A/S modes when the lighting changes.
B005IHAIMA,17,10,It's simple, just switch to the Menu mode and then select Brightness/Color and ISO setting is right there.
B005IHAIMA,17,11,From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.
B005IHAIMA,17,12,With the Canon S95 point-and-shoot, I can switch from Auto to Scene mode through the mode dial and then select HDR option (if I left it in HDR mode then I don't even have to scroll and I've switched to HDR mode in the flick of a dial).
B005IHAIMA,17,13,I use my manual lenses on M or A modes, but have been using several of the scene modes where it will adjust shutter speed and ISO and other parameters to give you their scene shot.
B005IHAIMA,17,14,I was never able to figure out how I was doing this, but it happened enough times that I started to learn to check the exposure compensation setting if my pictures looked like they came out too dark in a light setting that should have been fine.
B005IHAIMA,17,15,With the NEX-5N, I have to press Menu, scroll to Shoot Mode, scroll from iAuto to Program mode, press Menu again (because selecting another shooting mode kicks you out), select the Brightness/Color menu, scroll to DRO/Auto HDR option and select Auto HDR (or other DRO/HDR mode).
B005IHAIMA,17,16,Also, I can change a lot of the settings that on regular point and shoots I couldn't change i.e. how long the picture review stays on.
B005IHAIMA,17,17,I can set the aperture to the minimum with Auto ISO but then the camera will favor something like 1/60s.)
B005IHAIMA,17,18,I used 2 of these for ISO and White Balance.
B005IHAIMA,17,19,It is obvious that the documentation that Sony provided with the camera was not designed for an experienced dSLR user but once I figured out where the shutter and aperture mode was on manual mode, it was very easy to set and use.On Manual Mode, the rotary dial controls the shutter setting.
B005IHAIMA,17,20,Auto ISO is available as an option.
B005IHAIMA,17,21,For most of us, there are only a few special settings that we change with any frequency.
B005IHAIMA,17,22,You can put this camera in automatic mode and still get better pictures than a point and shoot, and as you learn more about the camera, those pictures will only improve.Compared to the NEX 3 and C3, the 5N adds some great features.
B005IHAIMA,17,23,You will almost never need to use the flash on the NEX, and that alone will make a huge difference versus washed out flash photos from a point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,17,24,This change has made me more willing to learn and adopt to the different sets of controls in these cameras.
B005IHAIMA,18,0,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,18,1,I also noticed the same exact spots when is happened to use iso 100 and 1 second shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,2,The same shot with 800 iso had no trace of the spots.
B005IHAIMA,18,3,Very small lag on the shutter.
B005IHAIMA,18,4,The first time I noticed it the iso was 3200.
B005IHAIMA,18,5,It does take time to figure out the menues, but once you do you will find this camera very responsive with nearly no shutter lag.
B005IHAIMA,18,6,There are no visible spots or dust under iso 3200 and faster than 1 second.
B005IHAIMA,18,7,good price and item! very good pictures taken by this camera, I'll get other lens to shot special pictures.
B005IHAIMA,18,8,I love that I can switch from movie to still by using different buttons (movie button starts and stops movie, and stills are initiated through the shutter release).
B005IHAIMA,18,9,I'm a long time Nikon user, going back over 40 years.
B005IHAIMA,18,10,The images and video are stunning.as of 4/1/2012New spots have appeared on the sensor.
B005IHAIMA,18,11,It takes amazingly clear action shots.
B005IHAIMA,18,12,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,18,13,Also, I can change a lot of the settings that on regular point and shoots I couldn't change i.e. how long the picture review stays on.
B005IHAIMA,18,14,I have been a Canon and Nikon DSLR owner for a long time.
B005IHAIMA,18,15,It is still going strong and we use it all the time without fail it takes the nicest photos with the least amount of out of focus shots I have ever had.
B005IHAIMA,18,16,Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012.
B005IHAIMA,18,17,No problems at 1080p/24fps.Only regret is we didn't buy this a year ago.PROS:Amazing picture and video quality.
B005IHAIMA,18,18,I've not yet contacted Sony customer service but will.as of 3/20/2012I've upgraded the firmware to 1.01, verified it, and retaken some shots of tan walls to see if spots persisted and they do.
B005IHAIMA,18,19,I just called Sony and they confirmed that the issue is still there and that customers need to send their $700 cameras if they find the clicking issue.I asked them whether they can tell me a way to figure out whether the issue is still present but they said they cannot.
B005IHAIMA,18,20,There is no lag whatsoever from when the shutter is pressed and released!
B005IHAIMA,18,21,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,18,22,The tm700 has a better stabalizer, not much, and focuses faster, again minor but noticeable.
B005IHAIMA,18,23,While shooting I went 114 shots (keepers) over 2 hours and was only down to 60%.
B005IHAIMA,18,24,I like that you can set up to 5 menu items under a custom button and switch things fast.
B005IHAIMA,19,0,Using this with Eye-Fi card, battery last about 160-200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,19,1,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,19,2,good price and item! very good pictures taken by this camera, I'll get other lens to shot special pictures.
B005IHAIMA,19,3,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,19,4,The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.
B005IHAIMA,19,5,I got this with my sony card and it was expensive but worth every dime.
B005IHAIMA,19,6,No problems at 1080p/24fps.Only regret is we didn't buy this a year ago.PROS:Amazing picture and video quality.
B005IHAIMA,19,7,Video defect is not the only problem.
B005IHAIMA,19,8,Picture shooting effect is good and easy to handle.
B005IHAIMA,19,9,You can buy third-party adapters, but those look a little unstable for mounting a big flash unit to the camera.
B005IHAIMA,19,10,Its best feature is the HD video with exceptionally good audio quality, but if your intention is to shoot long videos DON'T, as the camera will OVERHEAT and automatically shut down after about 15 minutes of operation.
B005IHAIMA,19,11,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,19,12,They both involve the screen flickering about 1/2 second after you turn the camera off under different circumstances.
B005IHAIMA,19,13,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.
B005IHAIMA,19,14,Sony does sell a larger flash compatible with the NEX-3 and -5 series, which is quite a bit bigger than the included kit flash.
B005IHAIMA,19,15,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,19,16,But, the photos it took were okay when small, but not so good on a bigger computer screen.
B005IHAIMA,19,17,You buy a $600 camera and the stupid developers can't even implement sequential file numbers for video files--only photos.
B005IHAIMA,19,18,This needs to be corrected!!! Also, Sony's new thing with their cameras is that they will ONLY take a Sony battery.
B005IHAIMA,19,19,This Sony is no SD1000 in size, but I got a small Sony case for the Sony NEX-5N and it is never in the way.It works great with my Eye-Fi card.
B005IHAIMA,19,20,The flash feeds off the main battery, which can be good and bad.
B005IHAIMA,19,21,No Sequential Ordering for Video Files!!!
B005IHAIMA,19,22,:) OH! and picture quality is pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,19,23,I was looking for a camera which was small in size but was great in taking pictures.
B005IHAIMA,19,24,The only thing I would love is if I could record video using the same effects as I can for still shots, but that is a very minor deal to me.
B005IHAIMA,20,0,I have owned Canon 40D, Canon 5D Mark ii, Canon T2i and so on...
B005IHAIMA,20,1,Durability and good looks...its a Sony.
B005IHAIMA,20,2,With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.
B005IHAIMA,20,3,Its a sony.
B005IHAIMA,20,4,This is my first real venture into something more than a point and shoot (though I did have a very short stint with a Rebel a year or so ago but felt overwhelmed.)
B005IHAIMA,20,5,So far this camera delivers.The cons will be that there are not many lenses available and they are steep in price.
B005IHAIMA,20,6,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,20,7,I have been a Canon and Nikon DSLR owner for a long time.
B005IHAIMA,20,8,Although I do have some previous knoweledge and experience with DSLR cameras both digital and film.
B005IHAIMA,20,9,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,20,10,Replaced my DSLR Canon Rebel XS with this Sony.
B005IHAIMA,20,11,I have for the last 10 years just had a canon powershot that I could put in my pocket.
B005IHAIMA,20,12,It has more dynamic range than a full-frame Canon 5D Mark II, and it has better video quality as well.
B005IHAIMA,20,13,I used to use a Canon SD1000 for a pocket shooter, but that was limited in usefulness (obviously).
B005IHAIMA,20,14,With the 55-210 mm telephoto zoom lens (or any of the other large superzooms for the E-mount like the Sony Alpha SEL18200 E-mount 18-200mm F3.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,20,15,This was an upgrade from a Nikon P100 model.
B005IHAIMA,20,16,Thanks Sony, you make me look like a better photographer than I am!
B005IHAIMA,20,17,No problems at 1080p/24fps.Only regret is we didn't buy this a year ago.PROS:Amazing picture and video quality.
B005IHAIMA,20,18,I purchased this outfit (w/18-55mm) as a "walk about" replacement for my standard SLR.
B005IHAIMA,20,19,I bought the Canon T3i and returned, Sony A65 and returned again.
B005IHAIMA,20,20,this is for people who want better quality pics than point and shoot, but doesn't want to carry around those 1-ton DSLRs.
B005IHAIMA,20,21,I don't care for cameras where every function is controlled by a touchscreen (e.g., the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX55 16.2 MP Slim Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 3.3-Inch OLED touch screen (Black), which is a fine micro-camera but a little dodgy to control because of the way that touchscreen occupies almost the entire back surface of the camera).
B005IHAIMA,20,22,That has turned out to be a good lens that gives me some of the compact size and image quality that I felt was lacking.
B005IHAIMA,20,23,I own the canon elph 300hs and the nikon d3100 and this by far beats both.
B005IHAIMA,20,24,I can't say enough good thing about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,21,0,By the way, the 18-55 len is a little heavy.
B005IHAIMA,21,1,Not exactly portable/pocket with the kit lens attached--you may have to get the 16mm pancake lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,2,I wish the lens cap had a leash.
B005IHAIMA,21,3,good price and item! very good pictures taken by this camera, I'll get other lens to shot special pictures.
B005IHAIMA,21,4,I cleaned the lens and sensor, but the spots remained.
B005IHAIMA,21,5,Mine came with a SILVER lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,6,A dust cap was placed over the sensor opening for shipment, but otherwise, as far as I can tell nothing was done to it.
B005IHAIMA,21,7,camera shipped with kit lens attached to the body, so NO rear lens cap and NO body cap are supplied.
B005IHAIMA,21,8,bought UV filter and Len cap string because the cap came without a string.Thanks all reviewers contribution, and thanks dpreview.com
B005IHAIMA,21,9,Lens is SILVER not BLACK!!
B005IHAIMA,21,10,The lens is a little bulky but hasn't been an issue.
B005IHAIMA,21,11,But the Amazon ad for the camera and lens combo for the BLACK body shows it with a matching BLACK 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,12,The only thing is that the lens cap has no string or anything, so I have to be careful where I put it and not leave it on the table or something.
B005IHAIMA,21,13,I have yet to buy additional lenses, but plan on grabbing the larger zoon lens and the macro lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,14,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,21,15,The spots were more definite when the lens I was using was stopped down below f10.
B005IHAIMA,21,16,It's a very solid camera with very good picture quality and the kit lens is quite nice as well.
B005IHAIMA,21,17,I also bought 16mm lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,18,To combat this, you need to hold the adapter or lens with your left hand.
B005IHAIMA,21,19,So if you wanted what the photo shows (go through them til you see the shot of the front of the camera lens combo from above,) be aware it comes with a SILVER and not BLACK version of the lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,20,In addition, the kit lens is pretty slow.
B005IHAIMA,21,21,The clicking problem persists and I'm not sure the camera case was even opened.
B005IHAIMA,21,22,The lens looks like it is hulking out and the hand grip, while useful, isn't pretty.
B005IHAIMA,21,23,The kit flash is pretty bad.
B005IHAIMA,21,24,f/2.8 pancake prime lens: With a 35mm equivalent FOV of 24mm, it would have been nicer if this lens had a wider-opening aperture.
B005IHAIMA,22,0,It's very strongest plus is the high ISO image quality.
B005IHAIMA,22,1,Other than that, it is a great camera especially in low light.
B005IHAIMA,22,2,Low light...no problem.
B005IHAIMA,22,3,Good for still photo.
B005IHAIMA,22,4,Low noise at high iso as well.
B005IHAIMA,22,5,Low light shots are amazing so far.
B005IHAIMA,22,6,I can't believe how good this thing is in low light conditions.
B005IHAIMA,22,7,Picture quality is excellent especially low light pics.
B005IHAIMA,22,8,I wanted it for the video quality.
B005IHAIMA,22,9,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,22,10,Good job at high ISO (low light).Con:
B005IHAIMA,22,11,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,22,12,I have been able to take low light shots, indoor, sunny outdoor, nighttime etc. without any issues.
B005IHAIMA,22,13,Very good camera and a very good image.
B005IHAIMA,22,14,The first being that at higher ISO levels in low light there is a fair deal of noise.
B005IHAIMA,22,15,Still, you can get great shots at extremely low light with amazing color that was just not possible at this price range until now.The kit lens is good and much better than I expected based upon some of the reviews I read.
B005IHAIMA,22,16,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.
B005IHAIMA,22,17,I've taken inside shots at night with minimal ambient light, handheld with no flash at ISO setting 25,600 and they turned out very clear with minimal graininess.
B005IHAIMA,22,18,It is still going strong and we use it all the time without fail it takes the nicest photos with the least amount of out of focus shots I have ever had.
B005IHAIMA,22,19,No problems at 1080p/24fps.Only regret is we didn't buy this a year ago.PROS:Amazing picture and video quality.
B005IHAIMA,22,20,The NEX-5N to me is the camera that gives you the best of everything, it did in fact produce better OOC jpeg images than the 550d in some low light settings.
B005IHAIMA,22,21,It performed much better than my other cameras, but I was not blown away.For standard indoor lighting, the Sony does do pretty well.
B005IHAIMA,22,22,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,22,23,Still, it is a good quality lens that I am happy using, though at a higher price point (5r, natch) I might grumble more about the slowness/sharpness.I found the grip on the camera and the general feel to be good and had no problems in this area.The screen is pretty good in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,22,24,:) OH! and picture quality is pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,23,0,You can bet that when I buy another camera, it will be from Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,1,Too bad I have to return it to Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,2,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.
B005IHAIMA,23,3,Why the still sell this camera ???Don't buy it !
B005IHAIMA,23,4,Still Clickin' I just bought this camera last week (Aug 1).
B005IHAIMA,23,5,Overall, this really is a good product!
B005IHAIMA,23,6,They went out of their way to discuss this problem with me and immediately refunded my purchase.___________________________________________________________________________________________I
B005IHAIMA,23,7,Amazon was very good to me when I had to return once before (no strings), but if I had to do this now for clicking or suspicion, I'll have to pay for return shipment to Cameta.
B005IHAIMA,23,8,I'm returning the camera to day to Best Buy.DO THE RIGHT THING SONY, RECALL YOUR DEFECTIVE CAMERA!DO THE RIGHT THING BEST BUY, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!DO THE RIGHT THING AMAZON, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!
B005IHAIMA,23,9,I've been reading the reviews so one of the first things I tried was the video!
B005IHAIMA,23,10,Why Is Amazon still selling defective models of this camera?
B005IHAIMA,23,11,I dont want to play camera roulette when I want to buy a new product and waste my money and time guessing what will work.
B005IHAIMA,23,12,I have waited to buy it for a long time.
B005IHAIMA,23,13,I say "infuriating" because when paying $700 you don't expect to have to settle for a defective product.
B005IHAIMA,23,14,I just bought it two days ago and received it today.
B005IHAIMA,23,15,Bought this after reading a couple score reviews on the top entry-level cameras in the genre.
B005IHAIMA,23,16,Do NOT BUY - DEFECTIVE.
B005IHAIMA,23,17,I bought my NEX-5N from Amazon and it arrived promptly on 10/17/2012.
B005IHAIMA,23,18,UPDATE: 21 FEB 2012: Amazon appears to be looking into this issue now - I believe they are intercepting/checking my return to verify this problem.
B005IHAIMA,23,19,No problems at 1080p/24fps.Only regret is we didn't buy this a year ago.PROS:Amazing picture and video quality.
B005IHAIMA,23,20,My 30 day return period would have expired by the time I returned to the USA, but I chatted online with Amazon support and they arranged for an extension of the return period until I got home.
B005IHAIMA,23,21,helped me made my final decision.Last year bought Panasonic FZ280 and Nikon 3100 end up returned them all and wait to last Christmas.
B005IHAIMA,23,22,(Due to where I live I couldn't buy it on Amazon and get it shipped to me when I needed it by.)I've
B005IHAIMA,23,23,This puts me just 4 days of my return window with Amazon closing so I am forced to return the defective camera for refund.
B005IHAIMA,23,24,It was January 30, and I had one more day before Amazon's extended return period for the holidays ended.
B005IHAIMA,24,0,This change has made me more willing to learn and adopt to the different sets of controls in these cameras.
B005IHAIMA,24,1,Full manual control is available if you're up to the task, or are just that persnickety.
B005IHAIMA,24,2,The help menu does really help with basic use of the camera.
B005IHAIMA,24,3,With that being said, the touchscreen menu is rather fool/idiot-proof because there are instructions on each menu and even helpful tips on how that function would be useful.
B005IHAIMA,24,4,Touchscreen menu is not as confusing as some people said.
B005IHAIMA,24,5,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,24,6,Under the "Setup" Menu", one can proceed to the Custom Key Settings.
B005IHAIMA,24,7,It's simple, just switch to the Menu mode and then select Brightness/Color and ISO setting is right there.
B005IHAIMA,24,8,I didnt even get a users manual with mine and it only took me 20minutes to go through all the menus and adjust settings to my liking.
B005IHAIMA,24,9,With a quick button push and Sony's well thought out basic controls, I can quickly get to and change the settings I most often access.
B005IHAIMA,24,10,Even though you can access most menu items through the physical dial and buttons, the touch screen works very fast.
B005IHAIMA,24,11,I like that you can set up to 5 menu items under a custom button and switch things fast.
B005IHAIMA,24,12,Having the two cameras set up differently means not having to fumble around trying to change menu settings btw auto and manual while on a shoot.
B005IHAIMA,24,13,You can program these settings for quick access.
B005IHAIMA,24,14,It's easy to use and takes beautiful photos, even on the automatic setting.
B005IHAIMA,24,15,For most of us, there are only a few special settings that we change with any frequency.
B005IHAIMA,24,16,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,24,17,My mindset is essentially that of learning and adopting to the different camera controls rather than one wanting to maintain a consistent set of controls among the different cameras.
B005IHAIMA,24,18,The NEX-5N overcomes these problems by including a control wheel and several physical buttons that change function depending on current shooting mode.
B005IHAIMA,24,19,I only changed a few menu items from what dpreview.com
B005IHAIMA,24,20,There is much to learn about all of the features which I haven't done yet, but am hopeful I can master.
B005IHAIMA,24,21,This wheel delves deeper into the menu option for specific functions.
B005IHAIMA,24,22,A BEST BUY, but learning the menu system takes time.... ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Added 4-24-13 : AFTER 5 MONTHS EXPERIENCEThis camera is really impressive over time, as I have now had several of my club member's cameras for a day or two loan, and I find the 5N unbeatable.
B005IHAIMA,24,23,The learning curve for this camera can be steep, and frequently changing modes is unnecessarily awkward.
B005IHAIMA,24,24,I thought maybe there was a setting in the menu to switch from PAL to NTSC, so I referenced the manual and to make a long story short, there is not a way to change this.
B005IHAIMA,25,0,Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012.
B005IHAIMA,25,1,Video "clicking" noise issue fixed.
B005IHAIMA,25,2,The clicking is still an issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,3,M. F. Click issue is a big problem for this product.
B005IHAIMA,25,4,Be aware if you want to use it to make home video.
B005IHAIMA,25,5,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,25,6,I thought SONY has fixed the clicking noise problem in the most recent product.
B005IHAIMA,25,7,Still has the click noise when shooting video.
B005IHAIMA,25,8,My next camera will probably be a Nikon or a Canon, from a company that actually takes pride in their cameras.
B005IHAIMA,25,9,DO NOT BUY UNTIL SONY ADDRESSES CLICKING ISSUE.
B005IHAIMA,25,10,A great camera for photographing, but not for video recording.
B005IHAIMA,25,11,I have to explain that the camera has already been sent in for that issue and that the problem is something else.
B005IHAIMA,25,12,The key concern is the video "clicking" noise issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,13,No Sequential Ordering for Video Files!!!
B005IHAIMA,25,14,In Sept. 2011, Sony has release an official statement that Sony will provide some video recording improvement for those affected NEX5Ns.(What
B005IHAIMA,25,15,However...When the camera is released, the video clicking issues has been widely reported.
B005IHAIMA,25,16,Photos great, video sucks.
B005IHAIMA,25,17,This is REALLY disappointing and as much as I wanted to buy this camera, I will not and do not recommend to do so.
B005IHAIMA,25,18,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,25,19,Thought you can cheat ????For all who are going to buy this product and just bought, make sure you see the "Unboxing videos" in You-tube and check you have similar packings / New product stickers.
B005IHAIMA,25,20,Sony is aware of the problem and has developed a fix.
B005IHAIMA,25,21,NEX5N click of death.The camera producing background clicking sounds while recording a video.
B005IHAIMA,25,22,I'm a long time Nikon user, going back over 40 years.
B005IHAIMA,25,23,Sony fails with NEX-5N, video with click out of the box.
B005IHAIMA,25,24,And the test video also shows the same thing.
B002IPHIEG,0,0,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,0,1,It's also super-portable and has an awesome battery life.
B002IPHIEG,0,2,It did this with the battery that came with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,0,3,battery life5.-touch
B002IPHIEG,0,4,The battery has a decent life as well.
B002IPHIEG,0,5,Battery life could be better.
B002IPHIEG,0,6,I used it as soon as I got the battery charged - and that, the battery, is the only thing I can say is a slight negative.
B002IPHIEG,0,7,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,0,8,Battery life seems pretty good.So what's not to like about this camera?1.
B002IPHIEG,0,9,As soon as the battery charged, I started using the camera.
B002IPHIEG,0,10,Battery does not last as long as the old Sony I have (T-3 and T-30)2.
B002IPHIEG,0,11,I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.
B002IPHIEG,0,12,The battery lasts super long.
B002IPHIEG,0,13,Battery life is better than any other compact digital I have owned.
B002IPHIEG,0,14,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,0,15,Loved this camera - i had it for 1.5 - 2 yrs and i was good for several more years if it weren't for the evil rain that destroyed it.
B002IPHIEG,0,16,I love this camera, this is my second in four years....I dropped the first from my horse.....This camera has a great slim design that fits well into a pocket...it takes great pictures and the batteries last a long time.
B002IPHIEG,0,17,Long story short, outdoor pics were great, the camera size was excellent, and battery life was out of this world.
B002IPHIEG,0,18,I used to always buy Casio for my point and shoots, my SLR is also a NIKON but I've only heard great things about Sony from my friends only downside being the battery life so I made sure to buy an extra battery...apparently they've improved on that issue and the battery life has been fine.
B002IPHIEG,0,19,Takes good pictures inside or out.
B002IPHIEG,0,20,We used it on our vacation to Washington DC and it and the battery would last all day.Well worth the investment.
B002IPHIEG,0,21,The burst mode is decent, battery life could have been better.
B002IPHIEG,0,22,Great low light pictures!
B002IPHIEG,0,23,Easy to download pictures and clear the photos from the camera.I bought extra memory and will purchase an extra battery for my cruise trip.The only cons I have noticed so far :  Wish it had a more powerful zoom.
B002IPHIEG,0,24,Battery has to be taken out and charged externally, i prefer the ones which can be charged through usb therefore allowing you to copy photos while also charging the camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,0,It also has a touch screen feature which I'm not so fond of.
B002IPHIEG,1,1,Love the touch screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,2,The camera is all touch screen and is more of an iPod Touch feel to it.
B002IPHIEG,1,3,A perfect sized protector will slightly overlap the screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,4,The touch screen is so easy to use and the camera fits anywhere.
B002IPHIEG,1,5,The screen gets smudged so easily.
B002IPHIEG,1,6,Some people might not like the touch screen, but it's actually quite easy to manipulate.
B002IPHIEG,1,7,The touch screen is very sensitive.
B002IPHIEG,1,8,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,9,But, I'm really glad I have both of them because they each have some very positive features.UPDATE 7/20/12: From the beginning, the touch screen had an unusual look as if a screen protector was on it.
B002IPHIEG,1,10,The touch screen is very intuitive and responsive.
B002IPHIEG,1,11,That screen is easy to maneuver around.
B002IPHIEG,1,12,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,1,13,This is my first touch screen camera and I was hesitant.
B002IPHIEG,1,14,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,1,15,The Large LCD screen is Spectacular as is the color in the photos.
B002IPHIEG,1,16,The view screen is very unforgiving and will lead you to believe your shots are more contrasty and grainy than they actually are.
B002IPHIEG,1,17,The important thing is to not touch the adhesive.
B002IPHIEG,1,18,For all of my intents and purposes this camera is great, I really wanted a big screen, I wanted touchscreen and I wanted it small.
B002IPHIEG,1,19,When your shots look good on the view screen, they will be even more pleasing on a correctly calibrated HD monitor.2) The white balance options never seem to look right on the view screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,20,I've found that it's best to make those decisions looking at the pictures at full size on a computer screen, rather than on the camera screen -- a shot that looks washed out or too bright on the camera screen is often perfect when seen on a larger monitor.
B002IPHIEG,1,21,Being touch screen, it is a different excitement.
B002IPHIEG,1,22,It takes beautiful pictures.
B002IPHIEG,1,23,Great Little Camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,24,These images needed to impress on a 67" HD screen.
B002IPHIEG,2,0,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,2,1,Good but poor autofocus.
B002IPHIEG,2,2,With finger swipes you can view new photos, even draw on photos using your finger or the included stylus.
B002IPHIEG,2,3,But Exmor R isn't as good as promised.
B002IPHIEG,2,4,The camera did a fine job correcting red eye, but the flash system left odd shadows against people.
B002IPHIEG,2,5,I bought this camera because of its 24mm super wide lens and the promise of Sony's new Exmor R chip.
B002IPHIEG,2,6,Subject was four feet away, but the camera focused almost 6 feet away.
B002IPHIEG,2,7,Wonderful camera.
B002IPHIEG,2,8,Even in auto mode, the Canon took consistently good pictures, important when handing your camera to someone to shoot your picture.
B002IPHIEG,2,9,I wish these camera makers would actually improve with subsequent models - I just don't get it!
B002IPHIEG,2,10,I wish these camera makers would actually improve with subsequent models - I just don't get it!
B002IPHIEG,2,11,I just want the cameras to live up to their billing!
B002IPHIEG,2,12,I just want the cameras to live up to their billing!
B002IPHIEG,2,13,It also tells you when some one is blinking, which is kind of an odd useless feature given the fact that I am well aware when someone has blinked during a photo.
B002IPHIEG,2,14,Not a real upgrade from DSC-T900.
B002IPHIEG,2,15,Maybe if you're a Pro, this slick twilight SONY mode may lure you in.
B002IPHIEG,2,16,actual video mode button (touchscreen based)-Zoom buttons seems awkward to use during filming-Battery/memory card is squeezed in camera's tiny body-4X optical zoom instead of 5X of DSC-T500If you search the internet for "redban and dsc-tx1"  I have numerous videos and photo samples available from my full review.
B002IPHIEG,2,17,Oh and one more thing, don't tell me to just get a DSLR or it's just a P &S; - I know that already!
B002IPHIEG,2,18,Oh and one more thing, don't tell me to just get a DSLR or it's just a P &S; - I know that already!
B002IPHIEG,2,19,The Canon has faster glass (f/2.0),
B002IPHIEG,2,20,;)Comes with AC battery charger.Red Eye Fix in-camera after photo is taken.CONSExmor R isn't quite as amazing as promised.Movie mode records in MPEG-4, not h.264 or AVCHD Lite.
B002IPHIEG,2,21,So overall given that this camera is a point and shoot and not anything else it is well worth the money.
B002IPHIEG,2,22,We set the camera to various ISO settings to try and minimize the noise, but no good.
B002IPHIEG,2,23,We set the camera to various ISO settings to try and minimize the noise, but no good.
B002IPHIEG,2,24,About the video be sure and buy a fast chip if you want good video Sony pro duo is a bit to slow for action shots.
B002IPHIEG,3,0,Vedio quality is great as well.
B002IPHIEG,3,1,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,3,2,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,3,3,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,3,4,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,3,5,I use it for my blog and the picture quality and audio are great.
B002IPHIEG,3,6,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,3,7,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!
B002IPHIEG,3,8,Oh, and the video quality is awesome as well.
B002IPHIEG,3,9,Just amazing in photo and video quality..
B002IPHIEG,3,10,720p video, great audio quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,11,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,12,Overall is good.
B002IPHIEG,3,13,The mono-microphone is pretty sensitive and provides a good sound quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,14,Horrible picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,15,There is static noise when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,3,16,The video quality is exceptional for a camera of this size as well.
B002IPHIEG,3,17,If you're buying it primarily for great pictures you should look at other cameras.
B002IPHIEG,3,18,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,19,I would have liked stereo sound recording but is that even possible on such a small camera?
B002IPHIEG,3,20,Date Stamp is done with the PMB software.HD video quality is actually better than the DMC-ZS3 AVCHD-lite.
B002IPHIEG,3,21,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,3,22,Although the sound is MONO compared to ZS3's Stereo, but the video quality and easy to work with editing software make up the difference!
B002IPHIEG,3,23,This is a great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,3,24,Recording HD movie were also disappointing, when you are recording you can actually hear sound of zooming and focusing when you play them back.
B002IPHIEG,4,0,One stop shot!
B002IPHIEG,4,1,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,4,2,What shots I took!
B002IPHIEG,4,3,It auto adjust to light so you always get great pictures.
B002IPHIEG,4,4,Great low light pictures!
B002IPHIEG,4,5,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,4,6,Really good camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,7,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,4,8,It has an anti blur mode meaning that it shoots 5 shots and blends them into one to create one great picture.
B002IPHIEG,4,9,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,10,If your looking for a quick easy point and shoot, this camera is for you.
B002IPHIEG,4,11,If only it took good pictures..
B002IPHIEG,4,12,You need to know what mode to be in to get a good shot and, as an amateur, I am not always sure what to do.
B002IPHIEG,4,13,Overall is good.
B002IPHIEG,4,14,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,4,15,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,4,16,I'm an avid concert-goer and partier, so I needed a camera that could take great pictures in not-so-great situations.
B002IPHIEG,4,17,I was able totake pictures with no flash using just the ambient lightand the pictures were beautiful.
B002IPHIEG,4,18,If you have low light though, it is capable of giving you some great shots.
B002IPHIEG,4,19,However, did you ever try looking at "no flash" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode?
B002IPHIEG,4,20,I had a very hard time to find a right mode to take pictures with a very bright white light at night.However, overall this camera is good.
B002IPHIEG,4,21,The pictures it takes are AMAZING - low light and normal.
B002IPHIEG,4,22,Vedio quality is great as well.
B002IPHIEG,4,23,All my shots have turned out great!
B002IPHIEG,4,24,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,5,0,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,5,1,Its shot response more fast than I think.
B002IPHIEG,5,2,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,5,3,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,5,4,I want a camera that I don't know is there, that I can whip out in 2 seconds to snap off a shot.
B002IPHIEG,5,5,Whenever I took action shots or shots of kids or pets with the W170, the pictures would always come out blurry.
B002IPHIEG,5,6,Excellent pictures with the right lighting.
B002IPHIEG,5,7,The processing time is fast, very fast.
B002IPHIEG,5,8,Maybe I wasn't doing it right but they didn't seem to help much.The best bet for action and fast moving subjects with this camera seems to be the burst mode, which rips off 10 shots one after another when the shutter is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,5,9,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,5,10,It takes pictures quickly, and the quality of the shots is usually excellent.
B002IPHIEG,5,11,3) Most importantly for me, the shutter does not click fast enough.
B002IPHIEG,5,12,Great indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,5,13,Taking pictures with this camera is so much fun.Because it is so thin and light, pressing the shutter release button without adding shake to the shot takes a very steady hand.
B002IPHIEG,5,14,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,5,15,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.
B002IPHIEG,5,16,Shutter lag (time from pushing the shutter button until photo taken),is very low for a pocket camera.What's not so good:-Noise reduction smears details at ISO 400 and above.
B002IPHIEG,5,17,I was always impressed with their speed, size, and the great pictures I would get from them.
B002IPHIEG,5,18,The Sony Cyber-shot takes wonderful indoor / low light pictures with fast shutter speed.
B002IPHIEG,5,19,I just returned a different camera because the shutter lag was horrible and so was the indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,5,20,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,5,21,It's easy to whip out and snap a shot when the moment is right.
B002IPHIEG,5,22,On the other hand a recent review of the upcoming S90 indicated that even with a fast lens and manual controls (allowing you to set the shutter) it wasn't fast enough for action, sports and kids.
B002IPHIEG,5,23,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,5,24,The waiter was walking around the table trying to take shots to get "everyone" in as many pictures as she could.
B002IPHIEG,6,0,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,6,1,I haven't transferred them to the computer, but I don't show my pictures on my computer.
B002IPHIEG,6,2,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,6,3,You can upgrade your video card, but that is expensive and doesn't even work that well.
B002IPHIEG,6,4,This camera doesn't take such nice pictures.
B002IPHIEG,6,5,I use a camera to take nice looking pictures.
B002IPHIEG,6,6,Reformating memory stick is best done on computer.
B002IPHIEG,6,7,Newer models can use either a Sony card or SD card.
B002IPHIEG,6,8,This model has to have Sony card.
B002IPHIEG,6,9,If only it took good pictures..
B002IPHIEG,6,10,Overall: If you are interested in a small, light, good looking and compact point-and-forget camera that makes ok pictures, this camera might work for you.
B002IPHIEG,6,11,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,6,12,It just is TOO small.
B002IPHIEG,6,13,Use MS Windows software for downloading.Overall: I am happy with purchase.
B002IPHIEG,6,14,For me, it was all about picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,6,15,Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.
B002IPHIEG,6,16,Still image and print quality are very important to me.
B002IPHIEG,6,17,Interface to computer - dedicated cable I have to bring with me on vacation, or a usb sd card reader?
B002IPHIEG,6,18,Great camera.
B002IPHIEG,6,19,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,6,20,I thought before buying that this would just be easier than stiching the photos on my computer.
B002IPHIEG,6,21,Better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,6,22,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.
B002IPHIEG,6,23,I bought this camera to be an everday everywhere type of camera, I didn't expect the world when it comes to picture quality, but I find it not worth taking because the picture quality is so poor.I have four major gripes with this camera1.
B002IPHIEG,6,24,There are some quirks with this camera which I wanted to point out.GOOD- Photo Quality - Others cover this so I wont go into it, but basically the photos are very good.BAD- Sony USB Cable - This is proprietary SONY cable, so you have to carry it around with you if you want to download photos from the directly from the camera without removing the Memory Stick.
B002IPHIEG,7,0,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,7,1,Great Little Pocket Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,2,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,7,3,Great little digital.
B002IPHIEG,7,4,Great
B002IPHIEG,7,5,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,6,Great pocket camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,7,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,7,8,This Sony camera is a great small portable digital camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,9,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,7,10,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,7,11,Overall, best digital camera I have used.
B002IPHIEG,7,12,I wanted a compact camera to be able to take pictures and then put it in my pocket, and this one is perfect.
B002IPHIEG,7,13,Best compact digital camera I've owned so far!
B002IPHIEG,7,14,Very good pocket camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,15,Great Pocket Camera With A Little Tinkering.
B002IPHIEG,7,16,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,17,I had wanted a small pocket camera for those times when I wanted to just slip a camera in my pocket for those unplanned photo opts.
B002IPHIEG,7,18,Very small (fits in a pocket) and very easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,7,19,This is a great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,20,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,7,21,Wanted a highly-portable pocket camera that also took decent quality pictures.
B002IPHIEG,7,22,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,23,This is a very very nice pocket camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,24,This made a big difference in the quality of the pictures that I took.
B002IPHIEG,8,0,As a former owner of a Sony A700 with 16-80mm Carl z lenses, plus a whole bag of long range lenses.
B002IPHIEG,8,1,The image quality is not going to be as good as a larger camera with a non-folded lens system and a bigger sensor.
B002IPHIEG,8,2,Former DSLR owner.
B002IPHIEG,8,3,I love this camera!GREAT THINGS about this: The slim design with a built-in cover to protect the lens instead of needing a lens cap is great.
B002IPHIEG,8,4,Dealing with toting all that stuff around, cleaning lenses, I finally got sick of it and sold everything on eBay and bought this camera, sure the image quality will never touch the A700 DSLR but I find the joy of photography is having a camera always with you.
B002IPHIEG,8,5,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,8,6,Perhaps we may get to see interchangeable lenses on future compact cameras.
B002IPHIEG,8,7,No manual controls.The W300 had full manual controls, and I wonder why Sony couldn't have included them here and really made this a top of the line point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,8,8,It is not the same package of everything you have with your DSLR and collection of lenses shrunk down to something the size of a couple of packs of gum.
B002IPHIEG,8,9,Lens distortion is amazingly low, even at wide angle.+
B002IPHIEG,8,10,It does take better photos in low light, but overall picture quality for an amateur user isn't that great.
B002IPHIEG,8,11,This is not to say they are DSLR quality, but they don't look bad at all for a point and shoot.Other positives:4.
B002IPHIEG,8,12,Sony DSC-TX1 is pretty good quality, and fun to use.
B002IPHIEG,8,13,When I can afford it, I'll get a DSLR to replace the SLR's.All of this is to say that I have some experience with photography, although I would not in any way consider myself a "serious" photographer.
B002IPHIEG,8,14,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,8,15,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,8,16,Taking a picture with the camera turned sideways to better frame a specific shot shows a lot of distortion from the wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,8,17,I would like to thank my boss who pushed me to buy this 24mm wide angle lense camera.Panoramic feature is also great.
B002IPHIEG,8,18,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,8,19,Pictures cant beat the best point and shoot cameras out there but no complaints at all - in fact, shoots good low light pictures.
B002IPHIEG,8,20,Other than this it's a great, "little" camera for those who want the quality, versatility and optics provided by Sony and their "G" series of lenses.
B002IPHIEG,8,21,You can also put the camera in High ISO mode, which allows for faster shutter speed.Canon's soon to be released S90 seems to have become the great new hope for shutterbugs longing for a small point and shoot that takes great low light photos instead of the WX1, primarily because it not only also has a fast lens and improved sensor, but also manual controls and raw capabilities.2.
B002IPHIEG,8,22,The low light capability was good, but not that much better than my Sony H20.
B002IPHIEG,8,23,You'd expect excellent quality with normal lighting, but it's more like above average for the price range and lens.
B002IPHIEG,8,24,Overall: If you are interested in a small, light, good looking and compact point-and-forget camera that makes ok pictures, this camera might work for you.
B002IPHIEG,9,0,Great low light pictures!
B002IPHIEG,9,1,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,9,2,Took great pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,3,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,9,4,For me, it was all about picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,5,It is a lot better with the picture quality especially in low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,6,Better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,7,It is excellent in low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,8,Suitable for low light only.
B002IPHIEG,9,9,Excellent low lighting performance.
B002IPHIEG,9,10,small but wish it better low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,11,Excellent pictures with the right lighting.
B002IPHIEG,9,12,If only it took good pictures..
B002IPHIEG,9,13,Picture quality is better than I have had on past cameras, and come out pretty well.
B002IPHIEG,9,14,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,9,15,Contrary to some reviews, the image quality has been oustanding.
B002IPHIEG,9,16,The big disappointmet was the bright light image quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,17,If you have low light though, it is capable of giving you some great shots.
B002IPHIEG,9,18,Photo quality under poor light conditions is amazing; photos are better than expected.
B002IPHIEG,9,19,The low light photos (without a flash) are incredible!
B002IPHIEG,9,20,The low light capability was good, but not that much better than my Sony H20.
B002IPHIEG,9,21,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,9,22,Love the low light feature.
B002IPHIEG,9,23,It can take 6 consecutive pictures at once, and stack them together to get a high detailed picture, without showing the usual grainy high iso result.
B002IPHIEG,9,24,Still image and print quality are very important to me.
B002IPHIEG,10,0,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,1,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,10,2,You can see some of the pictures I took here.
B002IPHIEG,10,3,The pictures have not been altered in anyway.[...]You can buy this camera with confidence.
B002IPHIEG,10,4,Great Camera for price.
B002IPHIEG,10,5,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,10,6,Elegant looking camera, love it!
B002IPHIEG,10,7,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,10,8,If only it took good pictures..
B002IPHIEG,10,9,she loves it.
B002IPHIEG,10,10,good features for the price.
B002IPHIEG,10,11,If you're buying it primarily for great pictures you should look at other cameras.
B002IPHIEG,10,12,Excellent buy for its price; a really good little camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,13,great camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,14,Better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,10,15,I have had this camera for a little over a year.
B002IPHIEG,10,16,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,10,17,Such a great camera!
B002IPHIEG,10,18,Great indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,10,19,Takes better pictures than any other camera I've owned.
B002IPHIEG,10,20,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,21,For me, it was all about picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,10,22,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,10,23,Picture quality is better than I have had on past cameras, and come out pretty well.
B002IPHIEG,10,24,This camera takes great pictures day or night!!
B002IPHIEG,11,0,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,1,A great camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,2,Easy to use2.-
B002IPHIEG,11,3,Great features, simple and easy to use settings.
B002IPHIEG,11,4,Very easy to use and great options!
B002IPHIEG,11,5,Great Little Camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,6,It has great quality picutres, easy to use, fast, etc!
B002IPHIEG,11,7,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,11,8,However, it is very easy to use and the instruction booklet is great.
B002IPHIEG,11,9,Such a great camera!
B002IPHIEG,11,10,This camera doesn't take such nice pictures.
B002IPHIEG,11,11,I use a camera to take nice looking pictures.
B002IPHIEG,11,12,Great size and lots of features.
B002IPHIEG,11,13,It is very intuitive, and easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,11,14,So far, it is working great for me.
B002IPHIEG,11,15,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,11,16,The camera is easy to use, not too many buttons that you'll never use.
B002IPHIEG,11,17,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,11,18,The screen is about as easy to navigate as you could ask for.
B002IPHIEG,11,19,It takes pictures quickly, and the quality of the shots is usually excellent.
B002IPHIEG,11,20,This kills an otherwise great night-time camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,21,The controls are pretty intuitive and easy for an amateur like me to figure out.
B002IPHIEG,11,22,The quality of photos are exceptional, nice small size, solid build, a great package.
B002IPHIEG,11,23,Wasn't looking for dslr quality, but something that looked  nice would be useful.
B002IPHIEG,11,24,It is also intuitive and easy to use the advanced functions without much of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,12,0,Another good Sony camera.
B002IPHIEG,12,1,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,12,2,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,12,3,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!
B002IPHIEG,12,4,Sorry Sony.
B002IPHIEG,12,5,Sorry Sony!
B002IPHIEG,12,6,Sorry Sony.
B002IPHIEG,12,7,Sorry Sony!
B002IPHIEG,12,8,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,12,9,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,12,10,The video quality is excellent.
B002IPHIEG,12,11,The Panorama features, HD video, and other features make this a no brainer.
B002IPHIEG,12,12,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,12,13,not much better than my seven year old Sony DSC-T30.
B002IPHIEG,12,14,I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon.
B002IPHIEG,12,15,The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90.
B002IPHIEG,12,16,I'm very happy with the Sony Cyber shot.
B002IPHIEG,12,17,Haven't shot any video.
B002IPHIEG,12,18,All in all I really love this camera and recommend it for video or stills.
B002IPHIEG,12,19,Sony did a great job on this camera.
B002IPHIEG,12,20,Good job Sony for making this.
B002IPHIEG,12,21,I have had it for about a month now and love taking pics and video.
B002IPHIEG,12,22,HD Video.
B002IPHIEG,12,23,It was NOT good at all.
B002IPHIEG,12,24,I've owned Sony's DSC-P72, W5, W7 and W300.
B002IPHIEG,13,0,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,13,1,It is not unusual to go through two batteries in an hour or two, even when they are fully charged.
B002IPHIEG,13,2,battery life5.-touch
B002IPHIEG,13,3,It's been in a drawer for some time now.
B002IPHIEG,13,4,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,5,Bought the camera and just before one year, the battery cover door broke -not due to mistreating-.
B002IPHIEG,13,6,battery cover can break in one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,7,If I had it to do over, I would not buy a camera with a touchscreen.One other thing--this thing eats batteries.
B002IPHIEG,13,8,The battery door is flimsy.-Hard
B002IPHIEG,13,9,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,13,10,Its great if you want Non-Flash photos and are frequently turning the camera off/on in between shots.BAD- Battery Cover - The battery cover seems very flimsy and bows a bit if you hold the camera by it.
B002IPHIEG,13,11,It didn't last long.
B002IPHIEG,13,12,Had this camera for about a month now - its a fine camera and has the usual settings/functions as mentioned by others.
B002IPHIEG,13,13,I used it as soon as I got the battery charged - and that, the battery, is the only thing I can say is a slight negative.
B002IPHIEG,13,14,I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.
B002IPHIEG,13,15,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,13,16,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,13,17,I can go days without charging it, while taking hundreds of pictures in the meantime.After using the camera for about three months, I have discovered a few details I'm unhappy with.
B002IPHIEG,13,18,As soon as the battery charged, I started using the camera.
B002IPHIEG,13,19,The biggest problem I've had is the USB connection - the plug on the camera end has always seemed a little wobbly and unstable, and over time it stopped connecting at all.
B002IPHIEG,13,20,Easy to download pictures and clear the photos from the camera.I bought extra memory and will purchase an extra battery for my cruise trip.The only cons I have noticed so far :  Wish it had a more powerful zoom.
B002IPHIEG,13,21,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,13,22,This camera takes great pictures day or night!!
B002IPHIEG,13,23,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,13,24,Sony repaired the damage under the warranty and not cost at all.
B002IPHIEG,14,0,Screen delamination or is it moisture haze?
B002IPHIEG,14,1,The LCD screen is adjustable todeal with the brightness of the environment.
B002IPHIEG,14,2,That screen is easy to maneuver around.
B002IPHIEG,14,3,The only bad point I have found....is sometimes I hit the touch screen when I am taking the picture and this changes my setting.
B002IPHIEG,14,4,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.
B002IPHIEG,14,5,The Sony "touch screen" only gets a 3 rating.
B002IPHIEG,14,6,No bevel to the LCD frame.
B002IPHIEG,14,7,Translated to small point and shoot cameras, it's almost impossible for an older pair of eyes to clearly see what's on a 2.7 or 3 inch LCD screen on the back of camera, even if bright sun isn't washing out the screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,8,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,14,9,Remarkable, actually.The touch screen is easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,14,10,This camera doesn't take such nice pictures.
B002IPHIEG,14,11,I use a camera to take nice looking pictures.
B002IPHIEG,14,12,There wasn't much to complain about.However I noticed last year that my screen was  getting hazy or splotchy; I don't know what to call it but it looks like a window with condensation all over it and I associated it with moisture or humidity "behine" the glass screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,13,Now I notice that my wife's camera is doing the same thing and I don't know what is going on yet but I cannot reccommend this camera now that I have seen both screens go bad in less than two years.
B002IPHIEG,14,14,If the camera has trouble focusing you simply touch the screen where you want it to focus and it focuses on that spot.
B002IPHIEG,14,15,It should have a viewfinder a bit hard to see in direct sunlight.
B002IPHIEG,14,16,Those can pose some problems when they open when they shouldn't (like in your pocket).The large touch screen makes everything easy.
B002IPHIEG,14,17,The LCD screen is bright, and high quality.. but its smaller.. and the menu system seems cluttered and annoyingly thought out.
B002IPHIEG,14,18,The all seemed to disappear at the point when I asked someone to take our picture.
B002IPHIEG,14,19,Not a killer, but annoying.I had great hopes for the picture quality that were not met.
B002IPHIEG,14,20,They use the old red green blue inputs.
B002IPHIEG,14,21,Most of the time with the WX1 I really can't make out what's on the screen, because to me its all out of focus (the problem is my eyes, not the camera).
B002IPHIEG,14,22,I only have a few complaints: it's difficult to figure out how to turn off the red-eye light; there's no setting to take a picture every X minutes, as I've had on other cameras; and full-light pictures tend to not be as great as other cameras.
B002IPHIEG,14,23,Durability  First day I severely scratched the screen on the metal rivet putting it in or taking it out of my jeans pocket a camera this small should be designed to be put in a pocket.3.
B002IPHIEG,14,24,Took great pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,15,0,Focus is fast.
B002IPHIEG,15,1,No problems encountered so far.
B002IPHIEG,15,2,Takes great (not perfect) pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,15,3,This one, with the exception of a F/3.1 lens (why not 2.8 or better?), seems to answer all my prayers with a price point under $350.SONY.... THEY'RE ALL ABOUT GIMMICKS AND LACK OF TRUE PERFORMANCE.
B002IPHIEG,15,4,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,15,5,It took better photos than any point and shoot I have come across, however it is no match for a full scale camera.
B002IPHIEG,15,6,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,15,7,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,15,8,When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked.
B002IPHIEG,15,9,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,15,10,It does take better photos in low light, but overall picture quality for an amateur user isn't that great.
B002IPHIEG,15,11,The images did not have good focus; they just weren't sharp and the color was not nearly as good as other point and shoot camera I have or am very familiar with.
B002IPHIEG,15,12,It is a lot better with the picture quality especially in low light.
B002IPHIEG,15,13,Slightly better at low light but terrible with good light.
B002IPHIEG,15,14,Parallax firmware can be utilized to overcome servo focus errors.So why is the TX1 not a 5 star camera?
B002IPHIEG,15,15,It auto adjust to light so you always get great pictures.
B002IPHIEG,15,16,The gist of their complaints seemed to be that the camera took good pictures in low light (although a few didn't even agree with that) and crappy pictures in good light.
B002IPHIEG,15,17,I would say, and this may be a mark against it for many people, that the WX1 is not a "point and shoot" camera unless one is familiar with its workings, but when I read the negative comments I wonder if some of the issues complained of could be addressed through a better understanding of the camera.
B002IPHIEG,15,18,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,15,19,Hi everyone and thanks for reading my reviewIf you are reading this chances are that you are in the market for a good point and shoot camera...In my opinion, you have to look no further.Most complaints about this camera basically tell you that the new image sensor that sony uses is not "that great" or that night images are good but day images are not...These complaints would ALL go away if they read the manual.
B002IPHIEG,15,20,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,15,21,The only slow operation is changing to View mode just after taking a picture, which takes 1-2s.However, there's a big fat problem with the WX1:  manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,15,22,Our 5 year old camera shoots pictures that are much better and sharp.
B002IPHIEG,15,23,I wonder if point and shoot cameras like this one could do better.
B002IPHIEG,15,24,The reason it is not a point and shoot is because auto exposure is just wrong.
B002IPHIEG,16,0,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,16,1,Sony repaired the damage under the warranty and not cost at all.
B002IPHIEG,16,2,Great customer service.
B002IPHIEG,16,3,They asked for US$400 to repair a tiny door.I am very disappointed for the customer support from Sony.
B002IPHIEG,16,4,I took it to my local camera shop to see if they could fix it, but all they do is send it in to Sony to have them repair it (for $260!).
B002IPHIEG,16,5,So of course there is no reliable way to take photos and certainly no way to review photos.I called Amazon.com this morning and the customer service representative told me I had to call Sony.I visited the Sony website, entered my information, and was given instructions to ship the camera back to Sony (at my expense) for free warranty repair (luckily it was within the 90 day window).I've owned Canon digital cameras for 7 years and never had a hardware failure in the first three months like this.
B002IPHIEG,16,6,Sony said they would repair the camera but that means shipping, waiting, and considerable trouble.
B002IPHIEG,16,7,They suggested I contact Sony (I didn't buy the camera from them).
B002IPHIEG,16,8,And, when directed to the service website to make a repair request, that malfunctioned too.
B002IPHIEG,16,9,So why am I reviewing a camera that seems like a downgrade?Well Sony is using a new lens system called the "Exmor R".
B002IPHIEG,16,10,If not, make sure you check it before your 30 day return option expires
B002IPHIEG,16,11,I reported the problem 32 days after buying so I was out of luck with the retailer.
B002IPHIEG,16,12,Did anyone at Sony even take this camera out for a night before shipping it?-
B002IPHIEG,16,13,I requested for the package to be left at my door with no signature so the shipping company called me within a few minutes to ensure that he would take care of this and gave me his cell phone number in case I needed it.
B002IPHIEG,16,14,Had High Hopes - Defective Product.
B002IPHIEG,16,15,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,16,16,I was very impressed that I ordered the camera on a Saturday, it was shipped out the same day and at my house on Tuesday...great service...thank you!!!
B002IPHIEG,16,17,I love the camera, unfortunately I returned it, because it had a lot of scratches, next time I'll buy a new one.
B002IPHIEG,16,18,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,16,19,The MONO mic sounds fine, but its no where close to being as good as the STEREO mic of the past.
B002IPHIEG,16,20,It works, but you need to have nimble fingers and if you've used an iPhone/iPod you'll be disappointed in Sony.
B002IPHIEG,16,21,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.
B002IPHIEG,16,22,I am going to see if Sony wiill repair or replace them but right now it feels that $329 x 2 was too much to spend for less than two years use.
B002IPHIEG,16,23,I pre-ordered this camera on 8/20/2009 (based on a glowing review [...]) and it arrived on 9/21/2009.
B002IPHIEG,16,24,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,17,0,settings adjustments for color hues, saturation.-No
B002IPHIEG,17,1,They looked better if I manually set the ISO, but if I'm just pulling it out for a quick shot, i don't want to have to remember to go to manual settings all the time.
B002IPHIEG,17,2,When setting on "P" mode I found out that switching the White Balance from "Auto" or "Daylight" to "Flash" in improves outdoor photos color, tone, exposure and warmness.
B002IPHIEG,17,3,I know I can always get into manual modes to compensate for things, but I wanted something I didn't always have to do that with.
B002IPHIEG,17,4,i would have liked that i had more control over the specifications in the pictures, too automatic for me.
B002IPHIEG,17,5,Controls are laid out sensibly, and it's easy to switch from automated settings to finer image control.One of the coolest new features is Panorama mode, which makes ultra-wide photos quickly and easily.
B002IPHIEG,17,6,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,17,7,After a while, pictures seem overexposed with white stripes accross.
B002IPHIEG,17,8,Switching to any other mode defaults the settings to the terrible AUTO everything requiring the photographer to reset all those undesirable Sony auto settings.
B002IPHIEG,17,9,I tried this, and with the White Balance set to Flash the pictures basically look the same out of the camera as they do after I've run them through Photoshop and hit Auto Contrast.
B002IPHIEG,17,10,Yeah, turning on the FLASH white balance for outdoor photos (which makes no sense by the way) --SOMETIMES-- does make the normally blueish outdoor photos look more pleasingly orangeish if you can remember to make this cryptic change or use P mode for your outdoor photos.
B002IPHIEG,17,11,Someone else said that they had no problem shooting at higher speeds in that setting.
B002IPHIEG,17,12,The reason it is not a point and shoot is because auto exposure is just wrong.
B002IPHIEG,17,13,However, did you ever try looking at "no flash" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode?
B002IPHIEG,17,14,You may need to set the EV to -.3=>-.7 for less contrasty scenes.
B002IPHIEG,17,15,Also for better exposure you can again adjust the EV.Panorama Shots: This one's tricky, from where you press the shutter to start the panorama it locks the exposure at that point.
B002IPHIEG,17,16,You have to switch the camera to Handheld Twilight mode and adjust the Exposure Value(EV) from -0.3 to -1.7(this is a very important setting that needs to be set on order to remove the noisyness and grain from the photo, a setting people don't adjust and then complain about how bad the photo looks in low light).
B002IPHIEG,17,17,You might also want to try different White Balances,setting correctly results in really nice low light shots.Outdoor shots:This camera in iSCN mode seems to keep the lens all the way open(F2.4)and it adjusts the shutter speed(a big No No)resulting in washed out over exposed photos(yuck).The solution: switch to "P" Mode which closes down the lens to around a nice F5.0 to F7.1(much better) and switch the White Balance to "Flash" .
B002IPHIEG,17,18,I hated it doesn't has black and white mode.
B002IPHIEG,17,19,I highly recommend taking picture in the P mode with white balance set to flash.
B002IPHIEG,17,20,A reviewer on Amazon has also noted that you can get more vivid, warm outdoors photos from the WX1 by using the Program mode and moving the White Balance setting from Auto to Flash.
B002IPHIEG,17,21,I had a very hard time to find a right mode to take pictures with a very bright white light at night.However, overall this camera is good.
B002IPHIEG,17,22,In fact, all the auto settings are wrong.
B002IPHIEG,17,23,I did not compare the movie modes, which have similar specifications.[Appended
B002IPHIEG,17,24,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,18,0,4) Reviewing photos after a shot ... is too slow.
B002IPHIEG,18,1,Instead it takes ... 3 to 5 seconds because you have to wait for the current photo to be processed and then wait wait wait to press the review button and if you press it twice ... oops, your still in picture-taking mode.
B002IPHIEG,18,2,With that, I will clear up problems previous owners have had.First, I'm sure all of you want to know how good the new Exmor R sensor is.
B002IPHIEG,18,3,I know that folks will say that I must have pressed the wrong button, and that might be so at times.
B002IPHIEG,18,4,With the first 100 pictures of my trip gone I decided I didn't want to be stressed out every time I ask someone to take a picture of us, not to mention the stress of keeping myself from doing it.
B002IPHIEG,18,5,Surely, the last photo can be put into a memory buffer to immediately be shown when the review button is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,18,6,I was so amazed in the difference!!  See my photos above![...]After 3 weeks of waiting for this camera to be released I now have it in my hands and taken over 500 pictures.
B002IPHIEG,18,7,3) Most importantly for me, the shutter does not click fast enough.
B002IPHIEG,18,8,I would buy it again.I would ask SONY to change a few things: 1) The power and shutter buttons are too flush and difficult to feel in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,18,9,The all seemed to disappear at the point when I asked someone to take our picture.
B002IPHIEG,18,10,Took great pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,18,11,It would come up with a choice of Delete this Picture on the left and Delete all Pictures on the right side of the screen.
B002IPHIEG,18,12,When taking shutter speed it takes a while to recording and process it to save it and show up on camera.
B002IPHIEG,18,13,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,18,14,Shadows and low light shots even with flash end up RED!- (minor) Placement of on/off button is too far left for one-handed turning on/off.-
B002IPHIEG,18,15,The zoom is difficult to use it moves to fast.
B002IPHIEG,18,16,About all it can't do is pinch-zoom, and I'm guessing that's more of a patent issue than anything else.
B002IPHIEG,18,17,If its zoom hadn't given out after many active years, I'd still shoot with it.
B002IPHIEG,18,18,I like this camera but the only thing I dont like about it, is that the sensor light the redish-orangish light bothers me.
B002IPHIEG,18,19,Once I finally got a battery that functioned again, I found that the shutter would no longer open/close properly.
B002IPHIEG,18,20,Maybe I wasn't doing it right but they didn't seem to help much.The best bet for action and fast moving subjects with this camera seems to be the burst mode, which rips off 10 shots one after another when the shutter is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,18,21,VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE: Great Camera!
B002IPHIEG,18,22,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.
B002IPHIEG,18,23,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,18,24,Now the camera powers on and stays on.Unfortunately, my problems were not over.
B002IPHIEG,19,0,With the card (which does not come included) and the camera, it runs up to $450.
B002IPHIEG,19,1,The only problem with it is you NEED to by a memory card, otherwise you can only store a couple of images on the camera's internal memory.
B002IPHIEG,19,2,I am also annoyed that you have to purchase Sony's licensed memory card.
B002IPHIEG,19,3,Since my other cameras have been Sony cameras, I have already had memory stick cards and readers, so to me, its not a big deal.
B002IPHIEG,19,4,It's annoying that it only takes the proprietary (and expensive) Sony memory stick instead of the usual SD card that all my other cameras have used, but that's not too big a deal.
B002IPHIEG,19,5,Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.
B002IPHIEG,19,6,Internal Memory.
B002IPHIEG,19,7,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.
B002IPHIEG,19,8,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,19,9,Taking HD Video takes up so much space on the memory card.
B002IPHIEG,19,10,Tell me what will you do when you want to move pictures from your camera to your computer on the fly, you will need the 10 meter long 10 plug Sony proprietary cable, how about taking the memory card out, oh, that's another proprietary memory stick duo, now how to charge it?
B002IPHIEG,19,11,There are some quirks with this camera which I wanted to point out.GOOD- Photo Quality - Others cover this so I wont go into it, but basically the photos are very good.BAD- Sony USB Cable - This is proprietary SONY cable, so you have to carry it around with you if you want to download photos from the directly from the camera without removing the Memory Stick.
B002IPHIEG,19,12,The biggest problem I've had is the USB connection - the plug on the camera end has always seemed a little wobbly and unstable, and over time it stopped connecting at all.
B002IPHIEG,19,13,No HDMI.Expensive Memory Stick Duo.
B002IPHIEG,19,14,If you have had other cameras that used SD, just think of making a $20 investment into a very reliable, fast card for your camera, and use the SD card in your Wii.The only two complaints I have for this camera are it's low light picture taking, and the format it uses when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,19,15,The only thing is that it is not supplied with a HDMI cable as standard..........
B002IPHIEG,19,16,But, if you take movies you have to locate the subdirectory on the memory card and access that directly.
B002IPHIEG,19,17,Incidentally, the newest duo "pro" cards are not compatible with some older readers even if they accommodate Sony cards.... go figure.4)
B002IPHIEG,19,18,My only negative is it didn't have a Memory Stick included.The battery doesn't last as long as the T100.
B002IPHIEG,19,19,(it's really ugly)No USB Charging.
B002IPHIEG,19,20,No standard USB connection.
B002IPHIEG,19,21,I had high hopes for this Sony, and even went to the trouble of buying a 16GB Memory Stick Duo (hate their proprietary attitude) and an extra battery.
B002IPHIEG,19,22,Its NOT one of those universal mini-USB/USB cables like you can use on Canons.
B002IPHIEG,19,23,What can't a mini USB connection do?
B002IPHIEG,19,24,The SONY Cable also has Video/Audio connectors, so its a bulky cable.GOOD- Flash Setting - Unlike most Canon's I have had you can turn OFF the flash and it stays off after turning the camera off/on again.
B002IPHIEG,20,0,My last four digital cameras were all Canon, and i was happy with them.
B002IPHIEG,20,1,Our last camera was a canon Powershot S2 IS.
B002IPHIEG,20,2,I purchased this camera after trying and returning the Canon PowerShot SD1300IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Blue).
B002IPHIEG,20,3,For a camera of this price, I feel it needs a much better zoom.
B002IPHIEG,20,4,I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon.
B002IPHIEG,20,5,The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90.
B002IPHIEG,20,6,I am replacing a Cannon with only 3.1 megapixels and this is somuch better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,20,7,I was looking for better zoom while still maintaining the compact feel.
B002IPHIEG,20,8,I purchased this camera because I wanted something to replace my Sony DSC-W300.
B002IPHIEG,20,9,Having faith and loyalty in the Canon brand (this was our 4th Canon Camera purchase, two of which were Canon AE-1s given as gifts) I contacted Canon and was sorely disappointed.
B002IPHIEG,20,10,That being said, I think the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W290 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization (Dark Blue) would be just fine as well for my needs.If SONY would only stop with the SONY-only cables/cards this would be a much better camera!
B002IPHIEG,20,11,It seems like most the Sony models lack on the zoom capability.-
B002IPHIEG,20,12,nothing better.
B002IPHIEG,20,13,I think my next one will be a Casio or Canon.
B002IPHIEG,20,14,At this rate, my next compact might be a Canon or Panasonic.
B002IPHIEG,20,15,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,20,16,I was in the market for point and shoot digital.
B002IPHIEG,20,17,Mediocre zoom.The WX1 has a 5x zoom, which would seem to be better than the standard 3x zoom found on a typical point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,20,18,I bought this camera as a replacement for an older version of Sony Cybershot.
B002IPHIEG,20,19,Nice Small Camera.
B002IPHIEG,20,20,Small, but you'll pay the price.
B002IPHIEG,20,21,In practice, because this camera has such a wide angle lens to start with, zooming out 5x doesn't seem to get you any closer than a 3x zoom on a point and shoot without a wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,20,22,This is the best point and shhot camera that i have used, hands down.
B002IPHIEG,20,23,All of these things make this camera very "hip" and up to the times.My concerns:- Small zoom.
B002IPHIEG,20,24,After 6-8 weeks I noticed that it wasn't holding a charge for as long as I would expect (I've owned several of the Canon PowerShot family of compact digital cameras).
B002IPHIEG,21,0,Many of my pictures have spots in them even though I do clean the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,1,Dust trapped inside lens, again!
B002IPHIEG,21,2,The ONLY thing that I do not like is having to open the lens cover to take photos...but in the end this will protect the lens, because I dropped two of my Canons and messed up the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,3,I believe this is due to the flash being close to the lens.In summary, DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA.
B002IPHIEG,21,4,The placement of the lens allows for others to touch or cover the lens with their fingers if they are taking a picture for you.
B002IPHIEG,21,5,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,6,It is so much better than the cameras that have the protruding lens that extends when open.
B002IPHIEG,21,7,Only problem that I can see is that the thing has the odd habit of turning on while in your pocket, which opens and expands the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,8,The only problem I have had is with dust backscatter.
B002IPHIEG,21,9,Lastly, from the "what were they thinking??" category, the flash is placed in a position where the lens blocks the flash from illuminating the lower left corner of the image at the wide end of the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,10,Light and small for the lens range.3)
B002IPHIEG,21,11,i like how the lens cover slides down and how slim the camera is.
B002IPHIEG,21,12,Great even in low lighted area.The bad side: The rocker/toggle switch used to zooming in and out the lens is fragile!
B002IPHIEG,21,13,I was advised that this is a technical problem caused by the flash being to close to the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,14,Pictures come rounded (probably because of wide angle).3.
B002IPHIEG,21,15,Works well in most lighting conditions with/without flash.
B002IPHIEG,21,16,There are many problems with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,21,17,If you take a picture with flash at 24mm, what is a really common use I have to say, it gets a black spot in the lower left corner.
B002IPHIEG,21,18,Another great feature is the lens cover that acts as an on/off switch.
B002IPHIEG,21,19,There is always a shadow in the lower left corner of the pictures (because of very short distance between flash and lens).2.
B002IPHIEG,21,20,Only minor complaint is that the lens is located very near where you hold the camera (upper right-hand corner) so you have to be careful not to take a picture of your thumb or finger -- have done that a few times :).
B002IPHIEG,21,21,Wanted a highly-portable pocket camera that also took decent quality pictures.
B002IPHIEG,21,22,Battery door easily opened.
B002IPHIEG,21,23,Aren't they caring about quality anymore... hope this is an isolate case.
B002IPHIEG,21,24,All my shots have turned out great!
B002IPHIEG,22,0,The low light pictures were much better then any other camera I have owned.
B002IPHIEG,22,1,Slightly better at low light but terrible with good light.
B002IPHIEG,22,2,Low light pictures are blurry and pixelated.
B002IPHIEG,22,3,Even the low light pictures don't seem to have a noise problem.
B002IPHIEG,22,4,It's better in low light but still very grainy, however it's worse in good bright light.
B002IPHIEG,22,5,Also, many of my pictures that I have taken have been blurry, pixelated, and of poor quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,6,For me, it was all about picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,7,The gist of their complaints seemed to be that the camera took good pictures in low light (although a few didn't even agree with that) and crappy pictures in good light.
B002IPHIEG,22,8,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,22,9,A grainy photo is better than no photo at all.
B002IPHIEG,22,10,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,22,11,Yes, you are slightly more likely to get a better photo in the dark if you really need to take photos in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,22,12,The low light picture taking is always a problem with cameras this size.
B002IPHIEG,22,13,If only it took good pictures..
B002IPHIEG,22,14,I never had a problem with blurriness or noise in my pictures.
B002IPHIEG,22,15,nothing better.
B002IPHIEG,22,16,Image quality was not what I expected.
B002IPHIEG,22,17,Takes great (not perfect) pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,18,Low light shots were noisier than my Fuji.
B002IPHIEG,22,19,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,20,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,22,21,You can see some of the pictures I took here.
B002IPHIEG,22,22,Good night shots.240-degree
B002IPHIEG,22,23,It is excellent in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,24,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,23,0,I returned it in the next day I received.
B002IPHIEG,23,1,I disregarded several of the negative reviews I read on this, trying to be optimistic, but that isn't working out for me.
B002IPHIEG,23,2,I bought two of the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX1/P camera within months of one another the first from Amazon on 12-17-2009.
B002IPHIEG,23,3,DSC-WX1b - I purchased this camera for 2 reasons.
B002IPHIEG,23,4,don't buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,5,While waiting to get the camera, I would check Amazon every day to see if anyone who had actually used the camera had put up any reviews yet.
B002IPHIEG,23,6,I'm somewhat puzzled after reading several of the poor reviews for this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,7,No problems encountered so far.
B002IPHIEG,23,8,You have to package the camera yourself and ship it to Texas for several weeks with no replacement in the interim.
B002IPHIEG,23,9,I did all my research (reading product reviews from Amazon, CNET, BestBuy etc.) and decided to try out the WX1 and I'm glad I did.
B002IPHIEG,23,10,I had a bought a Sony DSC-T3 a few years ago, wanting it so bad I imported one from Japan!
B002IPHIEG,23,11,I am going to see if Sony wiill repair or replace them but right now it feels that $329 x 2 was too much to spend for less than two years use.
B002IPHIEG,23,12,Quick focusThe bad:1) The only reason I returned it was the biggest.
B002IPHIEG,23,13,When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked.
B002IPHIEG,23,14,I truly believe you'll be very happy if you decide to purchase this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,15,Return shipping is included in this price.
B002IPHIEG,23,16,With the first 100 pictures of my trip gone I decided I didn't want to be stressed out every time I ask someone to take a picture of us, not to mention the stress of keeping myself from doing it.
B002IPHIEG,23,17,When I body-slammed my camera and myself to the paving stones of Salisbury, England, my Sony DSC-T9 performed like nothing had happened until I returned home, four days later.
B002IPHIEG,23,18,Waited until the price came down a bit and bought it.
B002IPHIEG,23,19,This was my main reason for purchase, and it failed my test.2)
B002IPHIEG,23,20,I got it from the Amazon warehouse, so the used price helped make it more palatable plus it's arrival in 2 days thanks to Prime!
B002IPHIEG,23,21,I now need to buy a new camera for an upcoming trip, and I can assure you it will not be a Sony.Hope this helps,Damian
B002IPHIEG,23,22,I've owned Sony cameras for years and would never look at another brand of camera, until now.
B002IPHIEG,23,23,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,23,24,Bought this camera despite reading all the negative reviews and I must say, I'm glad I did.
B002IPHIEG,24,0,The touch-screen interface is slick, but does have a bit of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,24,1,(I was up against a new model Nikkon)  The settings all do what they say, but perhaps it's greatest strength would also be it's weakness if any because while the settings are easy to use, and understand with help hints, those little "simple" settings are actually quite complex tools that make all the difference in a photo if you learn the camera and how to use each setting.
B002IPHIEG,24,2,He's picked it up a couple of times, but hasn't yet figured out how to work it...heaven help he should actually READ the manual (which I suggest).
B002IPHIEG,24,3,How is that possible?! (for the answer, see the next line item)- No manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,24,4,It definitely works well in some settings, but in other settings, it is going to suffer.
B002IPHIEG,24,5,It also has one of the best touchscreen interfaces I've used on a camera, it's not in the way and it's easy and quick to use.
B002IPHIEG,24,6,I had never done this before, and while it was a HUGE learning curve, I learned what this little stick of dynomite camera can and cannot do.
B002IPHIEG,24,7,Touchscreen makes managing functions fairly easy, and camera's "Easy" mode performs very intelligently in most settings.
B002IPHIEG,24,8,I'm not a techno wizard, but this camera is pretty easy to use (I do suggest reading the manual because the camera has lots of cool functions) and the photo quality is great.
B002IPHIEG,24,9,I know that folks will say that I must have pressed the wrong button, and that might be so at times.
B002IPHIEG,24,10,The touchscreen also got an upgrade even if it's smaller and has more of a iphone'isk menu system.
B002IPHIEG,24,11,Third, when trying to get back to the settings I want in the middle of a photo opp, it can be confusing trying to find the right screen.Fourth (and worst), the image size seems to change without my actually choosing it.
B002IPHIEG,24,12,First, it is all too easy while shooting to accidently change the settings and all too difficult to get back to what I want--after I realize what's happened.
B002IPHIEG,24,13,Take time to read and understand the instruction manual!Be sure and buy an xtra battery as the camera will gobble up the available "juice" while shooting.
B002IPHIEG,24,14,It is also intuitive and easy to use the advanced functions without much of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,24,15,First, was to help a friend photograph a wedding.
B002IPHIEG,24,16,I did read the reviews about what settings to use, and that is definitely something you need to know.
B002IPHIEG,24,17,this is 2010 not 1985.4.  User interface - menu is difficult to navigate and full of gimmicky 'features' as opposed to useful things.
B002IPHIEG,24,18,Also, I find it easy to hit the power button when the camera's in a crowded pocket.
B002IPHIEG,24,19,The controls are pretty intuitive and easy for an amateur like me to figure out.
B002IPHIEG,24,20,Controls are laid out sensibly, and it's easy to switch from automated settings to finer image control.One of the coolest new features is Panorama mode, which makes ultra-wide photos quickly and easily.
B002IPHIEG,24,21,I do a lot of shooting under pressure.
B002IPHIEG,24,22,As others have commented, you really do need to read the manual, experiment with the settings, and learn how to get the best results with it.But no one should be buying this camera because they want the best possible picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,24,23,The only bad point I have found....is sometimes I hit the touch screen when I am taking the picture and this changes my setting.
B002IPHIEG,24,24,I haven't used this mode too much yet, hoping to get better at using it.
B002IPHIEG,25,0,There is static noise when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,25,1,Video is usually okay, but has two major problems... First, the noise of zooming in and out is recorded very loudly.
B002IPHIEG,25,2,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).
B002IPHIEG,25,3,don't buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,4,All in all I really love this camera and recommend it for video or stills.
B002IPHIEG,25,5,If you plan on taking any video you will def.
B002IPHIEG,25,6,Just for the record, I never experienced such a problem neither with my T100 nor with my Sony HDR-SR7 camcorder.
B002IPHIEG,25,7,Sony DSC-WX1 , A disappointing Camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,8,Recording HD movie were also disappointing, when you are recording you can actually hear sound of zooming and focusing when you play them back.
B002IPHIEG,25,9,I dont know if its my camera but this camera kinda sucks at recording, becuz whenever i record it makes a sound in the background recording and its really annoying.
B002IPHIEG,25,10,Huge Disappointed.
B002IPHIEG,25,11,I did some research and found that I was FAR from the only one experiencing this issue.
B002IPHIEG,25,12,I've always been a sony camera guy, but this camera has a really big issue that I couldn't believe that it was real when I start testing the camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,13,Leave quality aside, Sony sucks.
B002IPHIEG,25,14,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,25,15,I now need to buy a new camera for an upcoming trip, and I can assure you it will not be a Sony.Hope this helps,Damian
B002IPHIEG,25,16,Let just start by writing that, I've been a fan and using sony product for about 25-30 years and i spend tens of thousands of dollars on sony products.
B002IPHIEG,25,17,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,25,18,So check, check, and check!
B002IPHIEG,25,19,I loved all of the features of this camera but the first thing that i care about is quality of photos which this camera has lack of it.
B002IPHIEG,25,20,That is why for a number of years I had successively Sony DSC-T1, T30, and T100 ultra-compacts.
B002IPHIEG,25,21,And of course it had to be Sony.
B002IPHIEG,25,22,With video recording, I was very happy to finally be able to zoom in and out while recording, however, I am not happy that it records in mp4 format.
B002IPHIEG,25,23,I had a bought a Sony DSC-T3 a few years ago, wanting it so bad I imported one from Japan!
B002IPHIEG,25,24,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B00DMS0LCO,0,0,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,0,1,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,0,2,the battery charger charge TWO batteries fast at the same time?I'd consider a full frame version, if the cons are fix.for
B00DMS0LCO,0,3,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,0,4,I added the grip, a couple of batteries and gone to shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,0,5,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,0,6,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,0,7,This way, I can charge it while the car is running rather than getting (my 5th) brick invertor.can
B00DMS0LCO,0,8,I put the dead battery that came with the camera on the charger and left it to charge thinking nothing of it.4
B00DMS0LCO,0,9,I have owned DSLR's before, and I was happy with my Nikon which died after getting sand in the lens which was too expensive to replace.
B00DMS0LCO,0,10,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,0,11,I know one day I will get used to the positions of the button.
B00DMS0LCO,0,12,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,0,13,When I get the battery, there is no power in it.
B00DMS0LCO,0,14,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,0,15,NOT COOL.I have 2 after market batteries that would no charge on this charger .Bummer I then ordered an aftermarket charger for 5 $ no big deal.
B00DMS0LCO,0,16,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,0,17,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,0,18,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,0,19,I have never heard of this.why is there a communication problem between a new battery and the battery charger?...following the directions I separated the battery from the charger and put it back on....still blinking rapidly.....repeated this action again and finally the battery started to charge.
B00DMS0LCO,0,20,All the cameras do a great job efficiently.
B00DMS0LCO,0,21,I should be able to charge after market batteries on this charger.sample
B00DMS0LCO,0,22,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,0,23,When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't.
B00DMS0LCO,0,24,However, if I look at my trusty Rebel T2i, which has been used in rain, on the beach, thrown in the backpack on many bike rides and abused in hours and hours of astrophotography sessions (usually covered in frozen dew), it still looks and behaves almost like new.
B00DMS0LCO,1,0,Touch flip screen.
B00DMS0LCO,1,1,The still photos can't be touched.
B00DMS0LCO,1,2,That is why I took one star away.I found the touch LCD and touch control screen on top of the 70D quite useful and adapted to them quickly.
B00DMS0LCO,1,3,The icing on the cake is the Touch Screen with multi-touch operation, as well as Touch AF! Excellent!
B00DMS0LCO,1,4,I  am not a big fan of touch screen operation because the screen gets smudged in a hurry, being anal retentive/ a clean freak this gets annoying to me but I will make the best of it.*
B00DMS0LCO,1,5,The swivel touch screen is not really comfortable to use with your left hand (considering your right hand is holding the camera).
B00DMS0LCO,1,6,Responsiveness is just as good as on my iPod Touch.-
B00DMS0LCO,1,7,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,1,8,always put a screen shield on this camera ASAP you'll be glad you did.the 3 main reasons I sold my 5D mark ii was it didn't have a swivel screen , I love the swivel screen, its a must for video shooting.
B00DMS0LCO,1,9,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,1,10,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,1,11,I like my buttons and I am slow to adjust to what the touch screen offers, but I am catching on.
B00DMS0LCO,1,12,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,1,13,Instead, you have to flip the switch and use the live view mode.
B00DMS0LCO,1,14,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,1,15,Simply compose a shot, touch the specific point on the Live View screen and the 70d can be set up to quickly focus on that spot and shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,1,16,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,1,17,I am still trying to figure out how to hold the camera so that I can tap on the back viewing screen where I want the focus.
B00DMS0LCO,1,18,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,1,19,I really like the features of this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,1,20,Images are softer than expected.
B00DMS0LCO,1,21,While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,1,22,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,1,23,I had to switch back and forth and was frustrated as I prefer to use the viewfinder but HAVE to use live view for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,1,24,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,2,0,a wide 80% dedicated to AF (in AF-C mode), it works nicely with Flash that has the AF illuminating light.Overlay of info in view finder makes composition a piece of cake.The red AF confirmation in view finder keeps my eye on the subject not having to wonder off center.The kit lens focus in near silent.
B00DMS0LCO,2,1,I tend to default to the viewfinder for my composition but the Live View option on the 70d is so good that I am using it as well.
B00DMS0LCO,2,2,Instead, you have to flip the switch and use the live view mode.
B00DMS0LCO,2,3,I really like the revision to the autofocus point selection options in the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,2,4,No GPS -- otherwise great.
B00DMS0LCO,2,5,I had to switch back and forth and was frustrated as I prefer to use the viewfinder but HAVE to use live view for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,2,6,Perfect for action and video (video is unbeatable) This Camera I perfect for action photography it is super fast and the autofocus is always right on.The wifi function is very nice but just a gadget for fun.The live view focus is super fast and and combined with the touch it is unbeatable in video and live view mode.The feeling in the hand is similar to the on find in the 5d III it is just way lighter.Another big pro is the variety of lenses, because you can either use the pro lenses with the ef connection or the cheaper ef-s lenses, where canon just recently added the new stm type which is as quiet as the pro lenses, which is nice for video, and a lot faster in focusing then the older ef-s lenses, which is nice for action.
B00DMS0LCO,2,7,The sensitivity of the autofocus points in Live View is also excellent, arguably more accurate than what can be achieved through the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,2,8,The next best thing to getting a full frame.
B00DMS0LCO,2,9,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,2,10,The 19 point autofocus system, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder, consistently miss-focus the pictures, with my Canon 300mm F4 IS L lens.
B00DMS0LCO,2,11,a leap in continous AF (in good light).
B00DMS0LCO,2,12,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,2,13,Some of the stand out features are the vari-angle touchscreen lcd, wifi, 19 autofocus points, live view auto focus (Dual Pixel CMOS AF) and the the burst rate is high and consistent.I also love the fact that you get add'l buttons such as dof preview, af, drive, iso, meter mode, af on, ae lock and af point selection.
B00DMS0LCO,2,14,Simply compose a shot, touch the specific point on the Live View screen and the 70d can be set up to quickly focus on that spot and shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,2,15,I have been very happy with my 60Ds, but wanted to get the additional focus points.
B00DMS0LCO,2,16,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,2,17,I find autofocus to be faster and more accurate with all my lenses than had been the case with the 60d.
B00DMS0LCO,2,18,Yes they are not as fast as the l-lenses/pro lenses but they are a lot cheaper and for that money it is way better then anything else.The only thing that is a little bit sad is that already with an iso of 3200, you can notice a strong noise.
B00DMS0LCO,2,19,Gone are the red dots that the 60d had replaced by what I find to be more useful squares with increased options for point selection including a zone focusing mode that the 60d lacks.
B00DMS0LCO,2,20,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,2,21,The photos all came out looking perfect with no underexposure whatsoever.
B00DMS0LCO,2,22,I am comparing this to my Lumix FZ200 which takes just as good movies with a dedicated button and has a 600mm f2.8 Leika lens and cost 1/3 the price of the 70D.
B00DMS0LCO,2,23,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.
B00DMS0LCO,2,24,The in camera aberration and ISO reduction really works.
B00DMS0LCO,3,0,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,3,1,Most reviews made it sound like a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,3,2,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,3,3,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,3,4,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,3,5,It does however lack a good amount of creative features within the camera for video recording.
B00DMS0LCO,3,6,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,3,7,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,3,8,I have not tried any of the movie editing capabilities; will report later.
B00DMS0LCO,3,9,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,3,10,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,3,11,I was attending a concert and wanted to alternate between pictures and movie clips.
B00DMS0LCO,3,12,Nice update to an already strong predecessor for semi-pro photographers...video functionality is unreal.
B00DMS0LCO,3,13,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,3,14,The dpreview web site noticed the same thing.
B00DMS0LCO,3,15,Of all the L lenses I've used, this sounded like how cat walks, dead silent.Articulated screen is awesome.wireless
B00DMS0LCO,3,16,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,3,17,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,3,18,But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,3,19,Read their review.
B00DMS0LCO,3,20,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,3,21,I have tried most of the tests, micro-adjustments, and other recommendations for those with similar problems, but nothing gives me a consistent focused picture.
B00DMS0LCO,3,22,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,3,23,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,3,24,Now, the T2i has great image quality (especially based on the year when it came out), but noise and dynamic range are practically the same.
B00DMS0LCO,4,0,However, it's still very good.
B00DMS0LCO,4,1,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,4,2,It's a great camera with an outstanding feature set.
B00DMS0LCO,4,3,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,4,4,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,4,5,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,4,6,Uses flash for low-light focus which will blind your subject.-
B00DMS0LCO,4,7,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,4,8,Without using FEL, the pictures are way underexposed.If
B00DMS0LCO,4,9,first camera was set up to shoot RAW.
B00DMS0LCO,4,10,the on camera flash.
B00DMS0LCO,4,11,All photos with and without FEL were properly exposed and looked great.I use bounce flash indoors a lot for our one year old granddaughter.
B00DMS0LCO,4,12,Haven't done much night shooting, but that's on my to-do list.
B00DMS0LCO,4,13,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,4,14,Amazing!
B00DMS0LCO,4,15,I use the same flash setup in the flash's manual mode, without using FEL, and adjust the power down to say 1/2 or 1/4 or somewhere in between, the photos seem properly exposed (as long as I dial in the correct flash power adjustment).
B00DMS0LCO,4,16,It's well made, easy to use, and the focus is very good - no hunting and pecking but smooth and quick.For video it's live auto-focus is excellent - use the swivel touch screen to keep the focus on a moving subject.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars are the button layouts make it a little counter-intuitive to find and change manual settings like white balance.Of course it's not as good as a full frame camera like the 5dmarkii in low light, or for it's dynamic range.
B00DMS0LCO,4,17,Image quality in low light a bit noisy- Auto-Focus on the center focus point required +17 manual focus adjustment with a new 50mm f1.4.
B00DMS0LCO,4,18,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,4,19,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,4,20,I can take multiple pictures for any positions.
B00DMS0LCO,4,21,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,4,22,The photos all came out looking perfect with no underexposure whatsoever.
B00DMS0LCO,4,23,I have had a DSLR previously, but always kept it in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,4,24,picture from my sigma 170-500mm on auto where beautiful.l
B00DMS0LCO,5,0,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,5,1,Works like a charm (after I got used to the somewhat tinny sound of the shutter).-
B00DMS0LCO,5,2,It just shows how many "clicks" are on your shutter, in your camera.
B00DMS0LCO,5,3,Long exposure behavior (I use it for astro pictures at 2-5 minute exposure) is really no difference to the already great T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,5,4,As usual, several things have changed, so it will take me some time to feel totally comfortable with it.
B00DMS0LCO,5,5,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,5,6,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,5,7,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,5,8,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,5,9,While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,5,10,The focusing appeared to be very fast and accurate except later I found most of my images were not properly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,5,11,I like my buttons and I am slow to adjust to what the touch screen offers, but I am catching on.
B00DMS0LCO,5,12,I often take photos of birds in flight and I got a lot more keepers compared to my other bodies.
B00DMS0LCO,5,13,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,5,14,Responsiveness is just as good as on my iPod Touch.-
B00DMS0LCO,5,15,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,5,16,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,5,17,I have been very happy with my 60Ds, but wanted to get the additional focus points.
B00DMS0LCO,5,18,Regardless of the focus mode you use, none works well for moving subjects.The camera takes nice pictures, but there are many better options, and with the release of the new Sony A6000, this camera is good only if you already invested in canon glass, and sadly most of it won't work with this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,5,19,The camera was tracking nicely when shooting a low flying eagle against the background of trees and fields.-
B00DMS0LCO,5,20,But for those who may be considering moving up the Canon line or hopping in for the first time hopefully I can help.
B00DMS0LCO,5,21,The swivel touch screen is not really comfortable to use with your left hand (considering your right hand is holding the camera).
B00DMS0LCO,5,22,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,5,23,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,5,24,understand that the "game changing" capabilities of this camera are on the video side, but I don't shoot a lot of video and there are plenty reviews out there on that topic.
B00DMS0LCO,6,0,In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card.
B00DMS0LCO,6,1,When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't.
B00DMS0LCO,6,2,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,6,3,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,6,4,This is what i want it's easy to connect to my smartphone.
B00DMS0LCO,6,5,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,6,6,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,6,7,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,6,8,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,6,9,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,6,10,I can take multiple pictures for any positions.
B00DMS0LCO,6,11,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,6,12,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,6,13,My home is reasonably well lit and I was surprised when the flash popped up as I attempted to take a photo of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,6,14,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,6,15,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,6,16,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,6,17,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,6,18,I also took some video which caused the lens to hunt even though the camera was pointed directly at my daughter and the room was well lit.
B00DMS0LCO,6,19,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,6,20,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,6,21,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,6,22,Amazing!
B00DMS0LCO,6,23,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,6,24,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,7,0,One like this and another small P&S; I can carry in my pocket.
B00DMS0LCO,7,1,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,7,2,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,3,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,4,I have owned DSLR's before, and I was happy with my Nikon which died after getting sand in the lens which was too expensive to replace.
B00DMS0LCO,7,5,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,7,6,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,7,7,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,7,8,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,7,9,I should've bought a replacement for the Canon PowerShot s95.So I sent the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 back and purchased the Sony RX100 II.
B00DMS0LCO,7,10,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,7,11,a sony RX100?
B00DMS0LCO,7,12,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.
B00DMS0LCO,7,13,always put a screen shield on this camera ASAP you'll be glad you did.the 3 main reasons I sold my 5D mark ii was it didn't have a swivel screen , I love the swivel screen, its a must for video shooting.
B00DMS0LCO,7,14,When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't.
B00DMS0LCO,7,15,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,7,16,Regardless of the focus mode you use, none works well for moving subjects.The camera takes nice pictures, but there are many better options, and with the release of the new Sony A6000, this camera is good only if you already invested in canon glass, and sadly most of it won't work with this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,7,17,This Canon EOS 70D sold by Amazon.com
B00DMS0LCO,7,18,Comes surprisingly close to the 24-105mm L lens, but with a wider range and a lot lower price.
B00DMS0LCO,7,19,Over time I have migrated up the line of Canon DSLR cameras from the early Rebel series through to the 60d (the 70d predecessor).
B00DMS0LCO,7,20,Basically, I'm getting this so, I won't miss a shot shooting photo journalist style.Since there are so many reviews to read, I'm keeping it short.PROFastest and most reliable AF in its class in good outdoor light.with
B00DMS0LCO,7,21,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,7,22,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,7,23,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,7,24,No comparison to other offerings from Olympus, Panasonic or Sony.
B00DMS0LCO,8,0,Good kit lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,1,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,8,2,I'm not going to restate all the excellent attributes of the camera and lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,3,Over priced not a full frame sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,8,4,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.
B00DMS0LCO,8,5,I currently own a Canon Xti + Tamron 17mm-50mm f/2.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,6,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.
B00DMS0LCO,8,7,a sony RX100?
B00DMS0LCO,8,8,this camera raised the level of usefulness on this sometimes tricky to use lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,9,This is a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,8,10,This one did not go on if the lens cap was on, nor could you put the lens cap on if the hood was attached.
B00DMS0LCO,8,11,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,8,12,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,8,13,For a $1200 camera it should have a full frame senor.Their still not there yet.
B00DMS0LCO,8,14,Why I returned 70D+EF 24mm f/1.4 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,15,Over priced.
B00DMS0LCO,8,16,I have a professional Canon video camera.
B00DMS0LCO,8,17,As a long-time Canon user with a 5D MKIII, multiple 'L' series lenses, etc.
B00DMS0LCO,8,18,However, consider other sellers.Amazon's performance on my purchase was appalling and possibly fraudulent.
B00DMS0LCO,8,19,We have to hold off until they produce a camera with a full frame senor for a reasonable price.
B00DMS0LCO,8,20,This camera with any attached lens does not balance well for any length of time.
B00DMS0LCO,8,21,Perfect for this use, using the kit lens.Impressed with the features.
B00DMS0LCO,8,22,Most of my lenses are USM or L series which make for much quicker focusing than even the STM but do sacrifice a bit of more noise (still much better than the cheap kit lens tho).Overall this camera is a solid performer.
B00DMS0LCO,8,23,Should be better in 2013.
B00DMS0LCO,8,24,This is a perfect only body for the serious photographer or a second for full-frame owners.
B00DMS0LCO,9,0,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,9,1,Too good for me.
B00DMS0LCO,9,2,I do wish at times I could soften the image because the detail can be too telling.
B00DMS0LCO,9,3,Images are softer than expected.
B00DMS0LCO,9,4,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,9,5,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,9,6,a leap in continous AF (in good light).
B00DMS0LCO,9,7,(with decent light conditions)Color Saturation and Image quality were good (with decent light)7fps was fast enough for me.Weather resistance was useful.Tilt screen was useful.18-135
B00DMS0LCO,9,8,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,9,9,High Image Quality from Poor light, quick focusing moving subjects, .... were my primary intend for this.
B00DMS0LCO,9,10,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,9,11,I'm not going to restate all the excellent attributes of the camera and lens.
B00DMS0LCO,9,12,Should be better in 2013.
B00DMS0LCO,9,13,Isn't the idea to capture an image and display it?Conclusion> It is a worthy, light camera capable of good images when properly exposed.
B00DMS0LCO,9,14,I took some amazing natural light / low light pictures and video of my daughter with the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4.However, I couldn't see myself lugging that thing around everywhere.
B00DMS0LCO,9,15,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,9,16,flash works as expected.Nice Hi ISO; doing ISO 3200 more often now.CONISO-A mode under expose (by 1.5 to 2EV) frequently with external flash on bracket.buttons
B00DMS0LCO,9,17,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,9,18,Most of my lenses are USM or L series which make for much quicker focusing than even the STM but do sacrifice a bit of more noise (still much better than the cheap kit lens tho).Overall this camera is a solid performer.
B00DMS0LCO,9,19,The focusing appeared to be very fast and accurate except later I found most of my images were not properly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,9,20,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,9,21,I did have high hopes for better low light photos with a new processor since the 60D essentially used a 4 year old unit but unfortunately they look almost identical.
B00DMS0LCO,9,22,I wish I knew how to use this thing better.
B00DMS0LCO,9,23,Basically, I'm getting this so, I won't miss a shot shooting photo journalist style.Since there are so many reviews to read, I'm keeping it short.PROFastest and most reliable AF in its class in good outdoor light.with
B00DMS0LCO,9,24,No GPS -- otherwise great.
B00DMS0LCO,10,0,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,10,1,That is the reason I bought this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,2,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,10,3,I actually purchased a T5i because of an amazing Christmas deal.
B00DMS0LCO,10,4,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,10,5,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,10,6,I was always hesitant to purchase one because of price and i didn't think it would change the way i took pictures.
B00DMS0LCO,10,7,I bought this on pre-order, and it's been a fantastic little camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,8,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,10,9,This particular purchase was a gift for my sister in Europe, ordered four days before my recent trip.
B00DMS0LCO,10,10,I'm a professional photographer and we have ventured into the photo booth business.
B00DMS0LCO,10,11,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,10,12,I'm honestly beginning to wonder if Amazon buys some manufacturer's QC rejects for a discounted price.Triple check everything you buy from Amazon for defects and also verify that you haven't bought a counterfeit item.
B00DMS0LCO,10,13,The camera is nice and good, but over rated.It has many cons, some are serious, example:1.Build quality, no way close to a $1000 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,14,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,10,15,Perfect for this use, using the kit lens.Impressed with the features.
B00DMS0LCO,10,16,Read their review.
B00DMS0LCO,10,17,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,10,18,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,10,19,I should've bought a replacement for the Canon PowerShot s95.So I sent the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 back and purchased the Sony RX100 II.
B00DMS0LCO,10,20,But when i read a review of the 70D online, and understood the differences, i immediately knew i needed to step up to a mid-range body.The 70D is an amazing camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,21,Review of Canon 70D; some shortcomings.
B00DMS0LCO,10,22,I purchased this camera about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,10,23,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,10,24,Based on all the great reviews, it may only be only some batches - I do not know.
B00DMS0LCO,11,0,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,11,1,Good Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,2,Too good for me.
B00DMS0LCO,11,3,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,11,4,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,11,5,This is a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,6,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,11,7,I'm a professional photographer and we have ventured into the photo booth business.
B00DMS0LCO,11,8,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,11,9,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,11,10,All the cameras do a great job efficiently.
B00DMS0LCO,11,11,Read the professional reviews.
B00DMS0LCO,11,12,The icing on the cake is the Touch Screen with multi-touch operation, as well as Touch AF! Excellent!
B00DMS0LCO,11,13,Excellant Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,14,The added perk of the New touch screen technology from the T4i and T5i have greatly improved the speed to many obscure functions sometimes needed in the depths of software.
B00DMS0LCO,11,15,The important part is the photographic result, fortunately all this camera's do a great job.The 70D is a worthy replacement to the 60D but if you already own a 60D keep using it.I believe that no camera will make you 100% happy but again, who cares.
B00DMS0LCO,11,16,But, having back-lit buttons would flatten the learning curve, while I am looking at the picture on LCD and change parameter at the same time.The lens 18-135mm has good focal length; it's sharpness fall off quickly toward the corners.can
B00DMS0LCO,11,17,I added the grip, a couple of batteries and gone to shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,11,18,That said, even my limited skills have resulted in amazing pics.
B00DMS0LCO,11,19,Have the 60D as well and they are quite similar.
B00DMS0LCO,11,20,Perfect for this use, using the kit lens.Impressed with the features.
B00DMS0LCO,11,21,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,11,22,I do wish at times I could soften the image because the detail can be too telling.
B00DMS0LCO,11,23,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,11,24,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,12,0,However, it's still very good.
B00DMS0LCO,12,1,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,12,2,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,12,3,I have a professional Canon video camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,4,Very good camera with only a few minor issues.
B00DMS0LCO,12,5,I really like the features of this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,6,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,12,7,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,12,8,The next best thing to getting a full frame.
B00DMS0LCO,12,9,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,12,10,If you're interested in video production, buy a dedicated video camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,11,For a $1200 camera it should have a full frame senor.Their still not there yet.
B00DMS0LCO,12,12,Over priced not a full frame sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,12,13,understand that the "game changing" capabilities of this camera are on the video side, but I don't shoot a lot of video and there are plenty reviews out there on that topic.
B00DMS0LCO,12,14,Regardless of the focus mode you use, none works well for moving subjects.The camera takes nice pictures, but there are many better options, and with the release of the new Sony A6000, this camera is good only if you already invested in canon glass, and sadly most of it won't work with this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,15,I'd researched it, consider the Nikon, but I still think I've made the right choice for me.
B00DMS0LCO,12,16,All the cameras do a great job efficiently.
B00DMS0LCO,12,17,Nice update to an already strong predecessor for semi-pro photographers...video functionality is unreal.
B00DMS0LCO,12,18,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,12,19,If you need a camera for only still photography you may be better off buying a 7D or full frame camera for the money even tho it does do a "pretty good" job much like the original 60D.
B00DMS0LCO,12,20,As a family camera, this is an excellent choice.
B00DMS0LCO,12,21,a sony RX100?
B00DMS0LCO,12,22,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,12,23,They were polite and blamed them selves not the canon.
B00DMS0LCO,12,24,Over priced.
B00DMS0LCO,13,0,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,13,1,When I get the battery, there is no power in it.
B00DMS0LCO,13,2,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,13,3,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,13,4,break battery.
B00DMS0LCO,13,5,I put the dead battery that came with the camera on the charger and left it to charge thinking nothing of it.4
B00DMS0LCO,13,6,I have never heard of this.why is there a communication problem between a new battery and the battery charger?...following the directions I separated the battery from the charger and put it back on....still blinking rapidly.....repeated this action again and finally the battery started to charge.
B00DMS0LCO,13,7,NOT COOL.I have 2 after market batteries that would no charge on this charger .Bummer I then ordered an aftermarket charger for 5 $ no big deal.
B00DMS0LCO,13,8,keep in mind that this battery charger is the same battery charger that comes with the 5dmark ii 7D and a few other models.
B00DMS0LCO,13,9,It would still work but it was not tactile.
B00DMS0LCO,13,10,I should be able to charge after market batteries on this charger.sample
B00DMS0LCO,13,11,hours later I see the battery still blinking rapidly ....ooops I guess I should read the directions.
B00DMS0LCO,13,12,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,13,13,the battery charger charge TWO batteries fast at the same time?I'd consider a full frame version, if the cons are fix.for
B00DMS0LCO,13,14,its not charging ?
B00DMS0LCO,13,15,I think this product was opened before I get it.
B00DMS0LCO,13,16,Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.
B00DMS0LCO,13,17,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,13,18,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,13,19,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,13,20,Interestingly enough the battery still has a charge left after all the pics and a dozen movie clips of some 41sec to 2min duration.
B00DMS0LCO,13,21,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,13,22,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,13,23,about an hour of use, my rating may change.
B00DMS0LCO,13,24,the directions state if the red blinking light flashes rapidly its not charging .
B00DMS0LCO,14,0,I am still trying to figure out how to hold the camera so that I can tap on the back viewing screen where I want the focus.
B00DMS0LCO,14,1,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,14,2,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,14,3,I should note that I used the viewfinder primarily rather than the LCD screen for the pics.I found it very frustrating that the camera does not have a dedicated button for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,14,4,Focus Issue using the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,14,5,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,14,6,I had to switch back and forth and was frustrated as I prefer to use the viewfinder but HAVE to use live view for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,14,7,No real complaints to date.
B00DMS0LCO,14,8,Simply compose a shot, touch the specific point on the Live View screen and the 70d can be set up to quickly focus on that spot and shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,14,9,That is why I took one star away.I found the touch LCD and touch control screen on top of the 70D quite useful and adapted to them quickly.
B00DMS0LCO,14,10,putting this in 1 star just because of audio.
B00DMS0LCO,14,11,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,14,12,The swivel touch screen is not really comfortable to use with your left hand (considering your right hand is holding the camera).
B00DMS0LCO,14,13,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,14,14,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,14,15,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,14,16,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,14,17,Just garbage
B00DMS0LCO,14,18,As usual, several things have changed, so it will take me some time to feel totally comfortable with it.
B00DMS0LCO,14,19,After using my camera for 10 days the buttons on the back (Menu/Playback/Q) stopped working.
B00DMS0LCO,14,20,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,14,21,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,14,22,Photo colors were not true unless taken in direct sunlight.
B00DMS0LCO,14,23,I can immediately see my settings and make alterations with a touch of a finger.
B00DMS0LCO,14,24,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,15,0,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,15,1,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,15,2,Focus Issue using the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,15,3,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,15,4,Auto Focus Problems on 3 Canon 70d's.
B00DMS0LCO,15,5,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,15,6,The 19 point autofocus system, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder, consistently miss-focus the pictures, with my Canon 300mm F4 IS L lens.
B00DMS0LCO,15,7,The focusing appeared to be very fast and accurate except later I found most of my images were not properly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,15,8,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,9,All 3 that I tried had the same Auto Focus problems that could not be corrected by the AF Micro Adjustment.
B00DMS0LCO,15,10,I never had this problem, or any other issue, with my T3i.
B00DMS0LCO,15,11,I tried 3 cameras and all have the same problem.
B00DMS0LCO,15,12,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,15,13,It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots.
B00DMS0LCO,15,14,Image quality in low light a bit noisy- Auto-Focus on the center focus point required +17 manual focus adjustment with a new 50mm f1.4.
B00DMS0LCO,15,15,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,15,16,I have tried most of the tests, micro-adjustments, and other recommendations for those with similar problems, but nothing gives me a consistent focused picture.
B00DMS0LCO,15,17,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.
B00DMS0LCO,15,18,Liking the new features having moved up from a canon t3i.
B00DMS0LCO,15,19,fine camera.
B00DMS0LCO,15,20,(The situation is much better when using liveview auto-focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,21,(The situation is much better when using liveview auto-focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,22,Focussing with live view is no problem but focussing correctly when using fast lenses (Sigma f1.8) through the viewfinder results in many missed shots.
B00DMS0LCO,15,23,I have tried micro adjustments but that doesn't seem to work as the camera is inconsistent in how it misses focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,24,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,16,0,Said i can send my brand new camera for repair.
B00DMS0LCO,16,1,I gave it a 1 star because of the customer service I received from canon not for the camera itself because i never got see how the camera performs.
B00DMS0LCO,16,2,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,3,Poor customer service is beyond doubt.
B00DMS0LCO,16,4,After discussion, Amazon agreed to send a replacement but this did not arrive in time for my flight and was cancelled.I wrote, I called, I suggested that the replacement be delivered directly.
B00DMS0LCO,16,5,When i called canon the guy treated me as if I was stupid and was telling me there is no way that there can be a err 30 code because thats a lens error and usually happens after a lot of use.
B00DMS0LCO,16,6,After using my camera for 10 days the buttons on the back (Menu/Playback/Q) stopped working.
B00DMS0LCO,16,7,putting this in 1 star just because of audio.
B00DMS0LCO,16,8,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,16,9,As a result, I've paid full-price for an 'open-box' (being charitable) product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,10,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,16,11,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,16,12,They worked again when I tilted the camera at an angle and this might be because of some loose contact .
B00DMS0LCO,16,13,I purchased this camera about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,16,14,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,16,15,But for those who may be considering moving up the Canon line or hopping in for the first time hopefully I can help.
B00DMS0LCO,16,16,If you get a camera that is used I would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one.
B00DMS0LCO,16,17,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,16,18,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,19,Audio plug is worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,16,20,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,16,21,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,16,22,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,16,23,Maybe I got a bad piece, I still expect better quality control for a camera that cost over a 1000 dollars two stars of for that.
B00DMS0LCO,16,24,It just shows how many "clicks" are on your shutter, in your camera.
B00DMS0LCO,17,0,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,1,I have had a DSLR previously, but always kept it in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,2,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,17,3,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,17,4,date was set on the first camera.
B00DMS0LCO,17,5,first camera was set up to shoot RAW.
B00DMS0LCO,17,6,Defective in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,7,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,17,8,I use the same flash setup in the flash's manual mode, without using FEL, and adjust the power down to say 1/2 or 1/4 or somewhere in between, the photos seem properly exposed (as long as I dial in the correct flash power adjustment).
B00DMS0LCO,17,9,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,17,10,Without using FEL, the pictures are way underexposed.If
B00DMS0LCO,17,11,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.

B00DMS0LCO,17,15,Image quality in low light a bit noisy- Auto-Focus on the center focus point required +17 manual focus adjustment with a new 50mm f1.4.
B00DMS0LCO,17,16,It also chooses a high ISO when using the flash (like 1600) guaranteeing some graininess.
B00DMS0LCO,17,17,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,17,18,It does not remember it.And so many cons.7.Focus, for the second time: Only good for stationary subject.
B00DMS0LCO,17,19,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,17,20,flash works as expected.Nice Hi ISO; doing ISO 3200 more often now.CONISO-A mode under expose (by 1.5 to 2EV) frequently with external flash on bracket.buttons
B00DMS0LCO,17,21,I was very anxious for this camera to arrive with all the hype about its enhanced focusing attributes especially for LiveView and in Movie mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,22,All 3 that I tried had the same Auto Focus problems that could not be corrected by the AF Micro Adjustment.
B00DMS0LCO,17,23,shutter would click when the live view button was pressed, but the LCD screen would stay blank.
B00DMS0LCO,17,24,It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots.
B00DMS0LCO,18,0,I wish I can assign the WB to a button, but you can not.
B00DMS0LCO,18,1,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,18,2,Coupled with the fact you have just 1 custom WB, is a difficult job.6.Program shift: you have to do it for every single shot if you shoot in P mood.
B00DMS0LCO,18,3,I had to get mine replaced  because the shutter button suddenly stopped bouncing back up.
B00DMS0LCO,18,4,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,18,5,I am still trying to figure out how to hold the camera so that I can tap on the back viewing screen where I want the focus.

B00DMS0LCO,18,8,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,18,9,shutter would click when the live view button was pressed, but the LCD screen would stay blank.
B00DMS0LCO,18,10,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,18,11,I really need to use a mono-pod or tri-pod but this seems a hassle especially for action shots.
B00DMS0LCO,18,12,Maybe I got a bad piece, I still expect better quality control for a camera that cost over a 1000 dollars two stars of for that.
B00DMS0LCO,18,13,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,18,14,I was wondering how canon would release a camera with major defect like this.
B00DMS0LCO,18,15,It would still work but it was not tactile.
B00DMS0LCO,18,16,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,18,17,Read their review.
B00DMS0LCO,18,18,I had not heard of any focusing issues but a quick internet search on "70D focus issues" yielded a large volume of unhappy customers who have spent a lot of time researching the issue.
B00DMS0LCO,18,19,Over priced not a full frame sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,18,20,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,18,21,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,18,22,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,18,23,Also I have not compared it to any products by Nikon - the review below is only for Canon folks.I will start with the negatives first.The Ugly:Plasticky Dial :Canon- Please use metal for the heavily used parts.The Bad:Noise: There is considerable noise in low light both in photos and videos.(realistic
B00DMS0LCO,18,24,But for those who may be considering moving up the Canon line or hopping in for the first time hopefully I can help.
B00DMS0LCO,19,0,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,19,1,Without using FEL, the pictures are way underexposed.If
B00DMS0LCO,19,2,NOT COOL.I have 2 after market batteries that would no charge on this charger .Bummer I then ordered an aftermarket charger for 5 $ no big deal.
B00DMS0LCO,19,3,Arrived quickly as promised, but would not recognize or format mem card.
B00DMS0LCO,19,4,Amazon sold this 70d to me as new, it came with with a memory card with other peoples pictures on it.Obviously not new.
B00DMS0LCO,19,5,I sold my canon 5dmark ii to get this camera, I also have a t3i.I love the speed of this camera shooting jpeg with a fast sd card , that's right you should  have a fast card (80 mb's will do) for this camera especially shooing RAW (lab tests later) video tracking was decent with my 28-105mm canon lens.
B00DMS0LCO,19,6,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,19,7,Here are some cons to think about if they effect you:- Cannot sync full sized JPG and RAW files to Android- Cannot directly upload to Facebook or my TV via DLNA- Cannot take video while WIFI is enabled- Does not support USB 3.0- No IR focus headlight.
B00DMS0LCO,19,8,I put the dead battery that came with the camera on the charger and left it to charge thinking nothing of it.4
B00DMS0LCO,19,9,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,19,10,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,19,11,Unless they come up with a fix fairly quickly, I'm not sure I'd ever buy another Canon camera after this.
B00DMS0LCO,19,12,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,19,13,I have an external speed light/flash I just really never find myself using it.
B00DMS0LCO,19,14,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,19,15,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,19,16,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,19,17,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,19,18,She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one.
B00DMS0LCO,19,19,Returned for replacement - hope it's OK!
B00DMS0LCO,19,20,In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card.
B00DMS0LCO,19,21,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,19,22,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,19,23,I feel I have most shooting situations covered with the on camera flash although it has its drawbacks.
B00DMS0LCO,19,24,Same results with bouncing the flash off the ceiling.
B00DMS0LCO,20,0,I've always been a Canon loyalist.
B00DMS0LCO,20,1,I also own a Canon PowerShot s95.
B00DMS0LCO,20,2,I should've bought a replacement for the Canon PowerShot s95.So I sent the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 back and purchased the Sony RX100 II.
B00DMS0LCO,20,3,Something like a Canon Rebel T5i + Canon EF 28 mm f/1.8 USM may be just what you need.
B00DMS0LCO,20,4,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,20,5,I had an earlier EOS model that I'd had for several years and was expecting this one to feel about the same.
B00DMS0LCO,20,6,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,20,7,I upgraded from a Canon Rebel to the 70d.
B00DMS0LCO,20,8,I added a 18-270 Tamron lens to it, which is lighter than some others with this range.
B00DMS0LCO,20,9,I'd researched it, consider the Nikon, but I still think I've made the right choice for me.
B00DMS0LCO,20,10,I was a little disappointed with the weight.
B00DMS0LCO,20,11,But I haven't completely abandoned Canon; I also picked up a Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM that I'll use on the Canon Xti body.Bottom line: the 70D is a fantastic camera.
B00DMS0LCO,20,12,Canon EOS 70D rating.
B00DMS0LCO,20,13,I can put the s95 in my pocket; can't do that with the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4.
B00DMS0LCO,20,14,Cameras past and present: canon 5D mark III, Canon 7D (owned currently), Leica M3 35mm film, Canon 60D, And Canon t3iThe nitty gritty on this camera after a week of use:Build/functionality-Its a solid update to the popular 60d dslr.
B00DMS0LCO,20,15,I don't care how good it works, give me form and function!!
B00DMS0LCO,20,16,I currently own a Canon Xti + Tamron 17mm-50mm f/2.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,20,17,Why I returned 70D+EF 24mm f/1.4 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,20,18,In general Full-Frames are better.Most likely in a year or two we will see a full-frame from cannon having the same 70D features.
B00DMS0LCO,20,19,The more I thought about it, I realized that the hefty 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 would get in the way of me taking the pictures and video I want to take.
B00DMS0LCO,20,20,I consider myself an avid photographer.
B00DMS0LCO,20,21,I have owned DSLR's before, and I was happy with my Nikon which died after getting sand in the lens which was too expensive to replace.
B00DMS0LCO,20,22,No one will say it but switch from a solid "prosumer" camera like my Canon 40D (now 7 years old) and the 70D feels like a kids toy.
B00DMS0LCO,20,23,Maybe I got a bad piece, I still expect better quality control for a camera that cost over a 1000 dollars two stars of for that.
B00DMS0LCO,20,24,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,21,0,Good kit lens.
B00DMS0LCO,21,1,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,21,2,I'm using the kit lens (ef-s 18-135 stm).
B00DMS0LCO,21,3,The replacement started charging from 0-49%.-The rear lens cap on the kit lens was marred noticeably.-The
B00DMS0LCO,21,4,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,21,5,This one did not go on if the lens cap was on, nor could you put the lens cap on if the hood was attached.
B00DMS0LCO,21,6,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.
B00DMS0LCO,21,7,So Far, So Good.
B00DMS0LCO,21,8,I realized I might get better results with a better (prime?) lens but I also realized that the camera was just too big and heavy and that I was probably going to leave it home most of the time.
B00DMS0LCO,21,9,I have owned DSLR's before, and I was happy with my Nikon which died after getting sand in the lens which was too expensive to replace.
B00DMS0LCO,21,10,Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.
B00DMS0LCO,21,11,The 70d is quite a bit heavier and the lens is heavy as well.
B00DMS0LCO,21,12,Comes surprisingly close to the 24-105mm L lens, but with a wider range and a lot lower price.
B00DMS0LCO,21,13,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,21,14,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,21,15,It is a Brand New Camera, and when I first opened the package, I found quite a few specks of small dusts on the assembly mirror, it is UNACCETABLE manufacturing control when you consider how EXPENSIVE this 1 pound little machine is.Shame on Canon, This camera will DESERVE one Star.
B00DMS0LCO,21,16,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,21,17,Bought this camera for its auto-focus, returned this camera due to autofocus.
B00DMS0LCO,21,18,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,21,19,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,21,20,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,21,21,I posted a separate review under the individual lens item on Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,21,22,In my case Tamron service was aware of the issue and under warranty upgraded my lenses firmware and now everything works perfectly.
B00DMS0LCO,21,23,I received an obviously used camera.
B00DMS0LCO,21,24,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,22,0,Without using FEL, the pictures are way underexposed.If
B00DMS0LCO,22,1,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,22,2,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,22,3,She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one.
B00DMS0LCO,22,4,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,22,5,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,22,6,But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,22,7,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,22,8,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,22,9,Half of the still photos were not clearly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,22,10,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,22,11,Some report significant low light performance improvements over the older 18 MP sensor, but you might want to check the noise reduction settings in DPP.
B00DMS0LCO,22,12,The photos all came out looking perfect with no underexposure whatsoever.
B00DMS0LCO,22,13,For the same camera settings, the 70D produces much more aggressive image settings than my T2i, which makes the 70D performance look much better at first glance.
B00DMS0LCO,22,14,Also I have not compared it to any products by Nikon - the review below is only for Canon folks.I will start with the negatives first.The Ugly:Plasticky Dial :Canon- Please use metal for the heavily used parts.The Bad:Noise: There is considerable noise in low light both in photos and videos.(realistic
B00DMS0LCO,22,15,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,22,16,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,22,17,Now, the T2i has great image quality (especially based on the year when it came out), but noise and dynamic range are practically the same.
B00DMS0LCO,22,18,(with decent light conditions)Color Saturation and Image quality were good (with decent light)7fps was fast enough for me.Weather resistance was useful.Tilt screen was useful.18-135
B00DMS0LCO,22,19,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,22,20,Only for higher ISO and longer exposures one can see a little improvement (but not much more than you can expect in variances from the same sensor model).
B00DMS0LCO,22,21,Photo colors were not true unless taken in direct sunlight.
B00DMS0LCO,22,22,Maybe not as good as I would expect, but the keeper rate is considerably higher.
B00DMS0LCO,22,23,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,22,24,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,23,0,Amazon said it was new, it was not.
B00DMS0LCO,23,1,See the Amazon review by Mr. Ralph J. Secoy.
B00DMS0LCO,23,2,If you get a camera that is used I would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one.
B00DMS0LCO,23,3,It will be returned.
B00DMS0LCO,23,4,I really liked this camera but had to return it for a defect.
B00DMS0LCO,23,5,I bought two and both were defective out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,23,6,Got a used camera from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,7,Do not buy a 70D from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,8,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,23,9,At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,10,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,23,11,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,12,so needless to say I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.
B00DMS0LCO,23,13,Returned for replacement - hope it's OK!
B00DMS0LCO,23,14,I'm honestly beginning to wonder if Amazon buys some manufacturer's QC rejects for a discounted price.Triple check everything you buy from Amazon for defects and also verify that you haven't bought a counterfeit item.
B00DMS0LCO,23,15,I purchased this camera about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,23,16,Amazon is selling used cameras as new!
B00DMS0LCO,23,17,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,23,18,OK, this is a first for me when dealing with Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,19,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,20,But I decided to buy the Sony because of all the rave reviews I've read; it should meet my needs (hasn't arrived yet).
B00DMS0LCO,23,21,Why I returned 70D+EF 24mm f/1.4 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,23,22,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,23,I researched this camera well online before deciding to purchase.
B00DMS0LCO,23,24,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,24,0,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,24,1,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,24,2,I hope I can learn to use 20% of the features on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,24,3,But for those who may be considering moving up the Canon line or hopping in for the first time hopefully I can help.
B00DMS0LCO,24,4,These buttons are customized via the custom controls and i have mine set up for back button focusing.If you have already mastered your Txi Rebel or other entry level DSLR and want to step up without going to a full frame, the 70D is the best choice.
B00DMS0LCO,24,5,give me one that feels like a pro camera (like you did with the 40D).
B00DMS0LCO,24,6,I like all the features on the camera and as soon as I work my way through the 400 plus page manual, I am sure that I will take advantage of the versatility that this camera offers.
B00DMS0LCO,24,7,It looks, feels, and can operate much like the 60d that I owned previously so I could use it right out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,24,8,For the same camera settings, the 70D produces much more aggressive image settings than my T2i, which makes the 70D performance look much better at first glance.
B00DMS0LCO,24,9,I upgraded from a Canon Rebel to the 70d.
B00DMS0LCO,24,10,I hate the feel!!
B00DMS0LCO,24,11,The Sony RX10 has 3 custom WB and the 70D has just one.5.WB: if you want to chance the custom WB, you have to go and dig into the main menu.
B00DMS0LCO,24,12,If I can't buy a Pro camera for $4000.00
B00DMS0LCO,24,13,Radio Shack folks provided several types listed in the manual as acceptable , but none worked.
B00DMS0LCO,24,14,Over time I have migrated up the line of Canon DSLR cameras from the early Rebel series through to the 60d (the 70d predecessor).
B00DMS0LCO,24,15,So for anyone comparing the 70d to any cameras from competing camera manufacturers this is not the review that you will find most helpful.
B00DMS0LCO,24,16,I can immediately see my settings and make alterations with a touch of a finger.
B00DMS0LCO,24,17,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,24,18,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,24,19,Excellent upgrade for Canon owners.
B00DMS0LCO,24,20,No one will say it but switch from a solid "prosumer" camera like my Canon 40D (now 7 years old) and the 70D feels like a kids toy.
B00DMS0LCO,24,21,The menu wheel feels like it cost $2 bucks and should be on a $40.00 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,24,22,The touchscreen is much more than a gimmick, it is my go to method of set up when I turn the camera on.
B00DMS0LCO,24,23,I wish I can assign the WB to a button, but you can not.
B00DMS0LCO,24,24,I have had a DSLR previously, but always kept it in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,25,0,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,25,1,My Tamron 28-70 VC and 18-270 PZD for example failed to record video with this camera body.
B00DMS0LCO,25,2,Focus issue???? Sign the petition!
B00DMS0LCO,25,3,Nice update to an already strong predecessor for semi-pro photographers...video functionality is unreal.
B00DMS0LCO,25,4,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,25,5,I had not heard of any focusing issues but a quick internet search on "70D focus issues" yielded a large volume of unhappy customers who have spent a lot of time researching the issue.
B00DMS0LCO,25,6,Helpful, great illustrations.
B00DMS0LCO,25,7,I really like the camera but there may be one big flaw.
B00DMS0LCO,25,8,Note, MFA adjustments only apply to P, Av, Tv and M modes.Search for Youtube video "70D Bad Focus Issues" by CameraRec Toby for more info on the focusing issue.
B00DMS0LCO,25,9,Finally a word about Video performance.
B00DMS0LCO,25,10,With the STM lenses its fairly quick in its focusing and extremely quiet since they were design specifically for camera bodies like the 70D, t4i, and t5i in a video application.
B00DMS0LCO,25,11,In my case Tamron service was aware of the issue and under warranty upgraded my lenses firmware and now everything works perfectly.
B00DMS0LCO,25,12,But for those who may be considering moving up the Canon line or hopping in for the first time hopefully I can help.
B00DMS0LCO,25,13,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,25,14,If you agree please sign the petition here and maybe we can get Canon to change this:[...]Update 3/27/14:Check out this video for more info: www dot youtube dot com / watch?v=cA6JnzYSDJEThis is a real problem and if I could still return the camera I would.CANON PLEASE RESPOND.
B00DMS0LCO,25,15,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,25,16,Again the upgrade from previous models is significant with better focus tracking and wonderful HD performance.
B00DMS0LCO,25,17,Most reviews made it sound like a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,25,18,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,25,19,So for anyone comparing the 70d to any cameras from competing camera manufacturers this is not the review that you will find most helpful.
B00DMS0LCO,25,20,Mike Browne and other tutorials on YouTube will help me.
B00DMS0LCO,25,21,I have tried most of the tests, micro-adjustments, and other recommendations for those with similar problems, but nothing gives me a consistent focused picture.
B00DMS0LCO,25,22,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,25,23,I'm honestly beginning to wonder if Amazon buys some manufacturer's QC rejects for a discounted price.Triple check everything you buy from Amazon for defects and also verify that you haven't bought a counterfeit item.
B00DMS0LCO,25,24,Background info on my experience/use: semi pro portrait/event photographer, professional landscape photographer.
