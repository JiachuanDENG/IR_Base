B005IHAIMA,0,0,I just like to recomand this camera, he is great and a very good price.
B005IHAIMA,0,1,Very good camera and a very good image.
B005IHAIMA,0,2,have a nice day
B005IHAIMA,0,3,The flash feeds off the main battery, which can be good and bad.
B005IHAIMA,0,4,My Canon batteries charge from empty to full power in under 2 hours.-
B005IHAIMA,0,5,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,0,6,This happens using a (spare) battery used in the NEX-5.
B005IHAIMA,0,7,I can't say enough good thing about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,0,8,I have waited to buy it for a long time.
B005IHAIMA,0,9,This should be equated into the total cost of ownership if a viewfinder is important to the consumer.The battery life seems good for now.
B005IHAIMA,0,10,Really a good cameraI.
B005IHAIMA,0,11,Possibly small ones.Battery life is pretty weak.
B005IHAIMA,0,12,few years back I had a bad taste for Sony due to their camera's being battery (AA) for most styles.
B005IHAIMA,0,13,This can be considered a pro too, as Sony did a great job with the regular controls.Pros:The battery lasts a good long time.
B005IHAIMA,0,14,At the end of the day, does it take amazing quality photos?
B005IHAIMA,0,15,If you are bringing it along, you have to make the commitment that you'll be carrying a larger camera bag.Like most good cameras, the battery is rechargeable.
B005IHAIMA,0,16,This needs to be corrected!!! Also, Sony's new thing with their cameras is that they will ONLY take a Sony battery.
B005IHAIMA,0,17,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,0,18,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,0,19,No more guessing and losing the perfect shot (happened so many times!) because 1/4 remaining battery equates to 2 percent!This is the first time that the auto modes actually work for me.
B005IHAIMA,0,20,Picture shooting effect is good and easy to handle.
B005IHAIMA,0,21,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,0,22,While shooting I went 114 shots (keepers) over 2 hours and was only down to 60%.
B005IHAIMA,0,23,I LOVE that you can see what percentage of battery you have remaining.
B005IHAIMA,0,24,Finally, I got it at a good price.
B005IHAIMA,1,0,Very stealth with the flipout screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,1,Easy control and settings with touch screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,2,Overall the screen is quite good and I only miss it in very bright sun.-
B005IHAIMA,1,3,Try it and you'll see.I also like the articulated LCD on the back, and the touch screen, and the simplicity of the menus.
B005IHAIMA,1,4,the screen is very clear and bright.
B005IHAIMA,1,5,This camera is quite good.
B005IHAIMA,1,6,Also the screen is susceptible to scratches.
B005IHAIMA,1,7,Tap the screen to focus during movie (haven't tried it for photo--haven't tried it because touch screen so new to me on a camera).
B005IHAIMA,1,8,The touch screen is nice that wasn't in NEX-5, and so with NEX-5N you can operate the mode dials or touch the screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,9,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,1,10,He loves using it.
B005IHAIMA,1,11,the screen cover is high quality and I would recommend to anyone with a Nex5 camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,12,It has a great lcd screen and the best of any of the mirrorless cameras I have tried.
B005IHAIMA,1,13,But, the photos it took were okay when small, but not so good on a bigger computer screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,14,Such crisp images and such a great preview screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,15,I recommend getting a screen protector.
B005IHAIMA,1,16,The tilting screen is a great thing, but it doesn't flip around (although it does on the NEX F3), so you can't see yourself.-
B005IHAIMA,1,17,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,1,18,Great deal on a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,19,The LCD screen on the R1 will swivel a full 360 degrees!
B005IHAIMA,1,20,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,21,The photos look very sharp and nice.
B005IHAIMA,1,22,I think the design is very nice.
B005IHAIMA,1,23,With the screen articulated to face up, taking photos is quick and easy.
B005IHAIMA,1,24,Very nice camera.
B005IHAIMA,2,0,Excellent cameraWas undecided between the Canon T3i and this model but it is very good.
B005IHAIMA,2,1,I have owned Canon 40D, Canon 5D Mark ii, Canon T2i and so on...
B005IHAIMA,2,2,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.
B005IHAIMA,2,3,Amazing camera at an amazing price - review for Video.
B005IHAIMA,2,4,mainly got this for video, and for the size, so i will not review picture quality (its been done plenty of times).video is amazing, especially coming from a t2i, and using my gf's t4i. the best part is - true autofocus during video.
B005IHAIMA,2,5,If you buy the viewfinder then you cannot use the enclosed flash while the viewfinder is in use.
B005IHAIMA,2,6,I have been a Canon and Nikon DSLR owner for a long time.
B005IHAIMA,2,7,However, this camera shoots DSLR quality photos that are amazing in auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,2,8,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,2,9,It has more dynamic range than a full-frame Canon 5D Mark II, and it has better video quality as well.
B005IHAIMA,2,10,I would go for a slightly more expensive DSLR for that such as a Canon Ti.
B005IHAIMA,2,11,My last camera was a Canon Rebel, and I was ready to upgrade to something smaller.
B005IHAIMA,2,12,It focuses fast enough though there has been a time or two af has failed me.
B005IHAIMA,2,13,The kit zoom is very comendable and the video features are excellent.
B005IHAIMA,2,14,I can either have a viewfinder of a flash on, not both.
B005IHAIMA,2,15,I don't care about the video feature, but it works well.
B005IHAIMA,2,16,the t2i was great, and if you have investment of canon lenses this isn't worth the switch, but for me it was otherwise.i
B005IHAIMA,2,17,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,2,18,Amazing picture quality in auto mode - I gave up on my DSLR largely because I am such an amateur photographer that I could never get the settings right to take a great photo.
B005IHAIMA,2,19,You can put the focus precisely where you want it, which is great when shooting wide-open.
B005IHAIMA,2,20,Only downfall is the live view LCD doesn't let the battery last as long as a DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,2,21,Plus it does very well with symmetrical lenses compared to the other systems out there.
B005IHAIMA,2,22,I've had a couple of DSLR's in the past 7 years and that is all I've shot with.
B005IHAIMA,2,23,the lenses make noise, and focus is slow.on the nex, the lenses are silent for focus, and it focuses instantly.
B005IHAIMA,2,24,No built in viewfinder - you can buy one for $250 extra but I don't want to spend $250 on a viewfinder - a viewfinder and an extra lens take this camera up to 7N territory in cost which has a lot more than just the viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,3,0,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,1,Great value.
B005IHAIMA,3,2,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,3,But it must go back, the sound is uncalled for.
B005IHAIMA,3,4,Great cam for taking videos and having always around.
B005IHAIMA,3,5,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,3,6,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,7,I phoned Sony and they informed me that the shutter sound that the camera makes cannot be turned off!
B005IHAIMA,3,8,Sony customer service doesn't have a great track record, but I am willing to be surprised.I already had recommended the camera to several friends.Not any more.
B005IHAIMA,3,9,Without much experience, I was able to record fantastic pictures.
B005IHAIMA,3,10,Sony shutter sound obnoxious.
B005IHAIMA,3,11,The defect does not affect the picture quality of still images or video, but it does make the video recording feature unusable as the clicking noise is very noticeable.
B005IHAIMA,3,12,compare engine also confirmed this.The video quality is excellent.
B005IHAIMA,3,13,While I believe in Sony's ability to design great products, I am not impressed with their warranty service and  tech support.
B005IHAIMA,3,14,I am told that over time, one adapts to this button placement.Several people have complained about the video feature recording a clicking sound and I can confirm that this is the case.
B005IHAIMA,3,15,Who knows, and at this point, who cares.After one more call to Sony, they said they would have a technician call me, but so far, no one has called.
B005IHAIMA,3,16,I purchased the Sony NEX-5N and I am returning it.
B005IHAIMA,3,17,Right now I try to take videos with an external mic so it's less of an issue.
B005IHAIMA,3,18,UPDATE 01/16/2012  ***This is an excellent camera when it comes to picture quality, so in the end, I did end up going through the Sony "support" program to get my "improvement" for the camera rather than returning it for a refund.
B005IHAIMA,3,19,But, instead, the children heard that first click (then continuously hear the clicks)and turn and look at me instead of doing what they were doing that I wanted to take a photo of.
B005IHAIMA,3,20,I was very confused when I was buying this camera because of the (-) reviews because of a clicking sound that it makes while recording videos.Sony probably fixed that bug and my camera doesn't have such an issue.This is a great camera for those who wants quality images, exchangeable lenses and more compact size than an SLR camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,21,This needs to be corrected!!! Also, Sony's new thing with their cameras is that they will ONLY take a Sony battery.
B005IHAIMA,3,22,No clicking sound whatsoever.
B005IHAIMA,3,23,Words cannot describe how much I love this camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,24,Tested several times trying to confirm the "click" issue, and I hope that not happen on mine.The result is happy, No click issue at all using internal mic.Picture is very good.and
B005IHAIMA,4,0,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,4,1,This is a great camera!
B005IHAIMA,4,2,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,3,Only took 250 shots so far.
B005IHAIMA,4,4,Tried out the manual modes, but mostly just used Auto because that is what I wanted.
B005IHAIMA,4,5,However, this camera shoots DSLR quality photos that are amazing in auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,6,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,7,As he has been using a DSLR for awhile now, the unclear settings didn't set him back as much as us.
B005IHAIMA,4,8,Amazing picture quality in auto mode - I gave up on my DSLR largely because I am such an amateur photographer that I could never get the settings right to take a great photo.
B005IHAIMA,4,9,Takes great low light photos- I rarely use the flash with this camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,10,I use the Auto mode basically all the time.
B005IHAIMA,4,11,The good thing was, I hardly needed to use it even at night because it was so amazing at adjusting to the setting.
B005IHAIMA,4,12,Instead, it takes amazing low light pictures (even in a mostly dark room) in auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,13,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,14,A fun auto stiching panorama mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,15,Very smart auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,16,This camera puts forth such great, quality photos in auto mode that I usually do not have to do much editing to get a great picture to share.4)
B005IHAIMA,4,17,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,4,18,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,4,19,My back says this camera is great!
B005IHAIMA,4,20,great camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,21,The controls are much better, allowing things like manual focus, manual exposure, etc.
B005IHAIMA,4,22,Low light shots are amazing so far.
B005IHAIMA,4,23,Rarely use flash, but flash itself is good.
B005IHAIMA,4,24,Auto focus is near perfect in good light, and very good in low light.Macro with the kit zoom, using menu setting "Camera - AF/MF - DMF".  can give some pretty nice shots, but you will need to stay 9-10" away with this lens to focus.
B005IHAIMA,5,0,The lens is light, but feels substantial.
B005IHAIMA,5,1,Good.
B005IHAIMA,5,2,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,5,3,In evening events like volleyball and soccer, I used ISO 800 and 1600 to still get fast shutter to stop the action.
B005IHAIMA,5,4,It is great taking pictures indoor and outdoor.It looks good and has a good grip to take pictures comfortably.
B005IHAIMA,5,5,It feels sturdy and all the exterior parts seem nicely crafted.
B005IHAIMA,5,6,So, I cannot takes photos at weddings with this camera, I cannot take photos at sports events (Golf mainly) with this camera and cannot take photos of my grandchildren with this camera.
B005IHAIMA,5,7,Autofocus is fast and works well for pictures of my kids.
B005IHAIMA,5,8,Great camera!
B005IHAIMA,5,9,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,5,10,Shots are brighter and cleaner than any shots I've ever seen from a digital.The fast continuous shooting mode is impressive.
B005IHAIMA,5,11,Everyone is in awe when they here the rapid-fire.The shutter also makes a nice "mechanical" sound when you take a shot.
B005IHAIMA,5,12,The grandchildren will be playing nicely together and I want a candid shot of them and with the super fast continuous I could take several photos of them.
B005IHAIMA,5,13,So far, the freedom to set shutter speed for motion shots has been the most fun.
B005IHAIMA,5,14,I've tried adjusting shutter speed, ISO, etc and still didn't have much luck.
B005IHAIMA,5,15,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,5,16,Yes, beautiful photos, fast continuous shooting.
B005IHAIMA,5,17,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,5,18,Feels fantastic in your hand.
B005IHAIMA,5,19,Even video taken in low light can look good.
B005IHAIMA,5,20,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,5,21,;)Start-up time is very fast, and shot-to-shot time is even faster.
B005IHAIMA,5,22,Low light shots are amazing so far.
B005IHAIMA,5,23,Overall the camera feels good in your hand, the mechanical parts (hinges and other controls) feel well made and pretty sturdy.
B005IHAIMA,5,24,I wanted something to take pictures of my fast moving children.
B005IHAIMA,6,0,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,6,1,I got this with my sony card and it was expensive but worth every dime.
B005IHAIMA,6,2,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,6,3,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,6,4,The include flash...is a flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,5,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,6,6,Perfect size, lots of features, takes great pictures, even when it is dark.
B005IHAIMA,6,7,Bought adapter for eight inch scope and took great photos of the moon.
B005IHAIMA,6,8,This is a great value for the money.
B005IHAIMA,6,9,I HIGHLY recommend this camera, as well as the 18-55 lens, the 16mm and the fisheye adapter and an extra battery, as well as a large fast memory chip (64GB Komputer Bay class 10 works very well); and the extra audio adapter (but only if you plan to take advantage of the excellent 1080p video).
B005IHAIMA,6,10,Overall I think it is a very nice design.The video appears to be good too.
B005IHAIMA,6,11,Wish I bought the one with built in wifi.
B005IHAIMA,6,12,It overheats  and turns off after about ten minutes of shooting 1080 video.
B005IHAIMA,6,13,The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,14,We were working with the 18-55 lens and also the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,6,15,Picture quality is excellent especially low light pics.
B005IHAIMA,6,16,This Sony is no SD1000 in size, but I got a small Sony case for the Sony NEX-5N and it is never in the way.It works great with my Eye-Fi card.
B005IHAIMA,6,17,Glad i bought it.I paid $623 on EBAY and mine came with a 18/55MM Lens, flash, a small SONY tote bag, 4GB SD Card, and charger/battery.
B005IHAIMA,6,18,I inserted the memory card into my laptop and was able to confirm that the images turned out good.
B005IHAIMA,6,19,Best Value in the space.
B005IHAIMA,6,20,I almost never need the flash because of its excellent high ISO capability.
B005IHAIMA,6,21,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,6,22,Small but powerful, excellent quality.
B005IHAIMA,6,23,Excellent photos...
B005IHAIMA,6,24,I do very little direct flash lighting, so it's not something I would use much.I have ordered the optional flash, which has bounce options.
B005IHAIMA,7,0,I was looking for a camera which was small in size but was great in taking pictures.
B005IHAIMA,7,1,great portability and great image quality.
B005IHAIMA,7,2,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,7,3,I also have a Canon G11 (which I love)This is a great in between a DSLR and a POcket cam.
B005IHAIMA,7,4,If you wnat a small package and great quality this is it.
B005IHAIMA,7,5,Great value.
B005IHAIMA,7,6,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,7,7,Great transition camera from point and shoots, works as well as most DSLR!!!
B005IHAIMA,7,8,Compact camera with DSLR quality.
B005IHAIMA,7,9,The compact size of a point-and-shoot camera with the quality of a DSLR one.
B005IHAIMA,7,10,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,7,11,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,7,12,We bought it for our honeymoon this year and it was great!
B005IHAIMA,7,13,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,7,14,Best of the Compact Camera lines.
B005IHAIMA,7,15,Both very nice.
B005IHAIMA,7,16,For more than 15 years, I've only used point and shoot cameras.
B005IHAIMA,7,17,I have for the last 10 years just had a canon powershot that I could put in my pocket.
B005IHAIMA,7,18,The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.
B005IHAIMA,7,19,I used this for well over year now, a lot, and I think it's great.
B005IHAIMA,7,20,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,7,21,With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.
B005IHAIMA,7,22,I own the canon elph 300hs and the nikon d3100 and this by far beats both.
B005IHAIMA,7,23,great quality in small package.
B005IHAIMA,7,24,I upgraded my point and shoot to this Sony and couldn't be more pleased.
B005IHAIMA,8,0,Negatif yani ise lens portfoyunun zayif olmasi.
B005IHAIMA,8,1,So far I only have the 16mm and the kit 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,2,I'm okay with the kit lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,3,I cannot say it was outperformed by say, Nikkor's kit lens in any way.
B005IHAIMA,8,4,A great Prime Lens for the Nex e-mount Sony 50mm f/1.8 Mid-Range Lens for Sony E Mount Nex Cameras4.
B005IHAIMA,8,5,Dug up a basket of great legacy lenses to try on the Nex 5n.
B005IHAIMA,8,6,If you buy one, get the kit with the 18-55 lens which represents the best value.
B005IHAIMA,8,7,After dragging an 18MP dSLR with 18-200 lens to Disneyland and taking only 200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,8,8,Lens for Sony NEX Cameras.
B005IHAIMA,8,9,By the way, the 18-55 len is a little heavy.
B005IHAIMA,8,10,(Other than more lenses)
B005IHAIMA,8,11,It was known for its great lens and sensor, but had no image stabilization.
B005IHAIMA,8,12,Compared to DSLR, m43, Point/Shoot, NEX 3, NEX C3.
B005IHAIMA,8,13,It's a very solid camera with very good picture quality and the kit lens is quite nice as well.
B005IHAIMA,8,14,I purchased the Nex 5N with the 18-55mm kit lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,15,Try finding an 18mm lens for a dSLR, it'll cost as much as the body itself.
B005IHAIMA,8,16,With the 55-210 mm telephoto zoom lens (or any of the other large superzooms for the E-mount like the Sony Alpha SEL18200 E-mount 18-200mm F3.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,8,17,With a pancake lens like the Sony 16mm, the weight and size approximates an XZ2 or LX7.Also, when you point this camera and the pancake lens at a person, there is no "DSLR intimidation" and frown....
B005IHAIMA,8,18,For a kit lens, I am impressed.
B005IHAIMA,8,19,We were working with the 18-55 lens and also the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,8,20,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,8,21,It's sensor is one of the sharpest sensors I've ever seen.
B005IHAIMA,8,22,For this reason, it is inevitable and also advantageous to use one's dSLR lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.I am able to use my Nikon F-mount lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.
B005IHAIMA,8,23,Lens are somewhat limited at this point, but with lenses adapters the possibilities are endless.
B005IHAIMA,8,24,the kit lens is fine but of course i will be getting better lenses and the fact they have an adapter which will fit almost any lens made is fantastic.
B005IHAIMA,9,0,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,9,1,Picture quality is excellent especially low light pics.
B005IHAIMA,9,2,Even video taken in low light can look good.
B005IHAIMA,9,3,Great image quality but try before you buy.
B005IHAIMA,9,4,I wanted it for the video quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,5,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,9,6,Low noise at high iso as well.
B005IHAIMA,9,7,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,9,8,I always wanted a camera that could take DSLR quality images without the size.
B005IHAIMA,9,9,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,9,10,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,9,11,very good camera.
B005IHAIMA,9,12,Any the photos' quility is high.
B005IHAIMA,9,13,It's small and light.
B005IHAIMA,9,14,The camera has great ISO performance and very good color replication.
B005IHAIMA,9,15,The high ISO quality and resolution at most ISO's really amazes me.
B005IHAIMA,9,16,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,9,17,Awesome Still Images and Video Quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,18,FANTASTIC for low light, such as in restaurants.
B005IHAIMA,9,19,This will give most people all the image quality they will ever need and then some.
B005IHAIMA,9,20,It was known for its great lens and sensor, but had no image stabilization.
B005IHAIMA,9,21,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.
B005IHAIMA,9,22,Excellent sharpness, color saturation and low light performance.
B005IHAIMA,9,23,The camera produces really high quality pictures!

B005IHAIMA,11,9,Picture shooting effect is good and easy to handle.
B005IHAIMA,11,10,Love it!!!! Love it love it!!!!
B005IHAIMA,11,11,It is a good street/travel camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,12,It's quite good for what it is.
B005IHAIMA,11,13,Great Fun.
B005IHAIMA,11,14,very easy to handle.
B005IHAIMA,11,15,I am most certainly a novice photographer and this camera is a great stepping stone for me.So far I am liking the photo quality I have seen come out of it.
B005IHAIMA,11,16,Great for point and shoot or more advanced photographers.
B005IHAIMA,11,17,I have been asked a several times if I am a professional photographer (No! It's just a great camera!).
B005IHAIMA,11,18,Great transition camera from point and shoots, works as well as most DSLR!!!
B005IHAIMA,11,19,Really a good cameraI.
B005IHAIMA,11,20,Compact camera with DSLR quality.
B005IHAIMA,11,21,I used this for well over year now, a lot, and I think it's great.
B005IHAIMA,11,22,This camera really gives me professional shots without hiring a photographer.
B005IHAIMA,11,23,I love it.
B005IHAIMA,11,24,If you're someone that doesn't care to learn the manual settings of a camera, this camera has a lot of automatic functions to choose from but it has great manual functions as well.
B005IHAIMA,12,0,I wanted it for the video quality.
B005IHAIMA,12,1,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,2,What surprised me was the quality of HD video.
B005IHAIMA,12,3,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,4,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,12,5,I couldn't have taken it with the R1.And the video.
B005IHAIMA,12,6,This camera takes great photos.
B005IHAIMA,12,7,Good for still photo.
B005IHAIMA,12,8,A great camera for photographing, but not for video recording.
B005IHAIMA,12,9,Takes great pics.
B005IHAIMA,12,10,Video "clicking" noise issue fixed.
B005IHAIMA,12,11,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,12,12,Takes outstanding pictures and video.
B005IHAIMA,12,13,:) OH! and picture quality is pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,12,14,Everything is good except the annoying click noise in video mode.
B005IHAIMA,12,15,Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012.
B005IHAIMA,12,16,Still has the click noise when shooting video.
B005IHAIMA,12,17,Check out video quality of "hungry seagulls" on U-tube.
B005IHAIMA,12,18,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,12,19,Awesome Still Images and Video Quality.
B005IHAIMA,12,20,There is an audio clicking problem for this new camera in video mode...
B005IHAIMA,12,21,Audio clicking problem in video mode.
B005IHAIMA,12,22,Now that Sony has fixed it, it's a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,23,Amazing camera at an amazing price - review for Video.
B005IHAIMA,12,24,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,13,0,Wasabi batteries  that I ordered are working too.
B005IHAIMA,13,1,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,13,2,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.
B005IHAIMA,13,3,Battery lasts for a while.
B005IHAIMA,13,4,I figured the battery was dead, so I threw it on the charger.
B005IHAIMA,13,5,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,13,6,Not exactly efficient, but at least the menus are not hard to navigate or use.The Bad:Battery life - Perhaps I am spoiled, but when I go out for a whole day of shooting pictures and video, I expect the battery to last the whole day.
B005IHAIMA,13,7,My Canon batteries charge from empty to full power in under 2 hours.-
B005IHAIMA,13,8,Low light...no problem.
B005IHAIMA,13,9,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,13,10,It is still going strong and we use it all the time without fail it takes the nicest photos with the least amount of out of focus shots I have ever had.
B005IHAIMA,13,11,The screen turns blue and flashes 'camera error'.
B005IHAIMA,13,12,A series of Sony Viao laptops drained their batteries even when the computer was off because there was a design failure and the battery circuit could not be closed.
B005IHAIMA,13,13,I purchased a 3-d party (Wasabi) battery pack (two NP-FW50 batteries, one Wasabi AC charger, one car charger converter for Wasabi AC charger, European converter) which works well with my NEX-5N.
B005IHAIMA,13,14,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,13,15,I must have mistaken this feature from some other camera I was researching.At this time, the only real negative I can find is the battery door.
B005IHAIMA,13,16,I do get significantly more barrel distortion from the SONY 18-55mm lens than from the Canon 17mm-85mm.BATTERYNEX-5N comes with a separate battery recharger, which is handy since the camera drains the battery rather fast it is nice to have a spare battery charging while the camera is being used.
B005IHAIMA,13,17,Using this with Eye-Fi card, battery last about 160-200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,13,18,This is REALLY disappointing and as much as I wanted to buy this camera, I will not and do not recommend to do so.
B005IHAIMA,13,19,Charging took about 4 hours (which is normal) and then the camera fired right up.You will be prompted to set the date & time right away and then you can start enjoying your new toy.When you turn the camera off, the shutter may operate.
B005IHAIMA,13,20,I don't care about the video feature, but it works well.
B005IHAIMA,13,21,The battery door on the other cameras I've owned never had any sort of movement when closed.INITIAL START UPI slipped the battery and a 16GB SanDisk Extreme memory card into the camera (SDSDX-016G-X46).
B005IHAIMA,13,22,However there are a few downsides:* The video button is in a very unfortunate place and cannot be disabled, so I have drained my battery a couple of times by accidentally capturing 20 minutes of video of the inside of my bag.*
B005IHAIMA,13,23,Sony is finally acknowledging the problem just not saying what it is and if the fix will completely fix the problem.
B005IHAIMA,13,24,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,14,0,I don't like touch screens.
B005IHAIMA,14,1,My only problem is that I have polarized sunglasses, and when I wear them, I can't see the image on the display screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,2,I can either have a viewfinder of a flash on, not both.
B005IHAIMA,14,3,You can customize 3 of the buttons on the back of the camera, and that helps tremendously, but there are still several things I wish were more readily available without fumbling through the menu.There is no viewfinder so you must frame your photos using the LCD screen, which can be difficult in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,14,4,I like that you can adjust the screen for above/below views.
B005IHAIMA,14,5,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,14,6,There are always stubborn streaks on the screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,7,Also, the touch screen is incredible.
B005IHAIMA,14,8,You MUST buy a the screen protector for this product as it is prone to damage over time.
B005IHAIMA,14,9,If someone is considering both of these cameras let me start with the differences between the two cameras that made me choose NEX-5N.My main issue with C3 was seeing the LCD screen in the sun.
B005IHAIMA,14,10,The screen turns blue and flashes 'camera error'.
B005IHAIMA,14,11,The screen almost seems "soft" and easily scratched if you are not really careful.
B005IHAIMA,14,12,you can resolve this issue by removing the sticker behind the LCD screen and extending out the LCD screen so the camera can cool faster but that will void your warranty.
B005IHAIMA,14,13,The camera does even have a single scratch on the body or the screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,14,The first way is handheld, and using its rear LCD screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,15,Also, the LCD screen had finger prints.I dont want to Buy a used product with Full Price, $775(including tax)  and not ready to deal with other issues with the camera.(Already
B005IHAIMA,14,16,;-)* The screen is very hard to use in direct sunlight.
B005IHAIMA,14,17,Now please Sony, just put a better hinge on the LCD panel and a PC socket, so I can use it with a studio flash, this camera really deserves a five star rating... but the lack of flash connector and the limited hinge on the LCD panel are the big failures of the camera.. ....
B005IHAIMA,14,18,With the screen articulated to face up, taking photos is quick and easy.
B005IHAIMA,14,19,My second complaint is that my unit has a dead pixel smack dab in the middle of the rear LCD panel.
B005IHAIMA,14,20,They both involve the screen flickering about 1/2 second after you turn the camera off under different circumstances.
B005IHAIMA,14,21,No self portraits here.The screen brightness is pretty dim in sunlight unless you opt for a "sunny weather" setting which then becomes way too bright when you are inside.
B005IHAIMA,14,22,I unboxed it, attached a lens and tried the 2 settings (iso 3200 on a light background and then 1 second exposure on blue sky) that revealed the sensor spots I've had an issue with and similar spots appeared on this camera too.
B005IHAIMA,14,23,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.
B005IHAIMA,14,24,Then one summer day last week, while taking some family photos, I touched the square on the touch screen to fix focus on my kid's face and the screen instantly developed a crack on the inside.Called Sony and explained the issue.
B005IHAIMA,15,0,Upgraded the firmware to newest version, Auto focus is fast!
B005IHAIMA,15,1,My Canon G12 is slow to focus.
B005IHAIMA,15,2,Waiting for the new firmware to fix it.
B005IHAIMA,15,3,The camera has inconsistent problem of getting locked up when shooting.
B005IHAIMA,15,4,The lack of a viewfinder take some adjusting to, and adding it is half the price of the camera.
B005IHAIMA,15,5,Replaced my DSLR Canon Rebel XS with this Sony.
B005IHAIMA,15,6,Video defect is not the only problem.
B005IHAIMA,15,7,I first purchased Sony NEX-C3 and liked  many things about it, but two problems caused me to trade it in for Sony NEX-5N, which addressed those two problems.
B005IHAIMA,15,8,In time its shortcomings (primarily slow repeat shooting and poor autofocus) came to really bug me and I've moved on to better cameras.
B005IHAIMA,15,9,Upon receiving this camera, I put it through its paces and I immediately noticed two firmware bugs that should have been obvious to Sony, if they had done proper testing.
B005IHAIMA,15,10,Hopefully, SONY will provide some modifications in firmware upgrades to make the camera a little easier to use.
B005IHAIMA,15,11,I have no idea what they 'upgraded' but so far the problem is gone.
B005IHAIMA,15,12,So if you have any substantial money in lenses that are not E-mount, pick something else.If you get the viewfinder, you have to pick between a flash, or the viewfinder, or the microphone.
B005IHAIMA,15,13,I can confirm that AF is extremely fast and accurate with this adapter...much faster than the 50mm E-Mount lens I tested.
B005IHAIMA,15,14,UPDATE: 21 FEB 2012: Amazon appears to be looking into this issue now - I believe they are intercepting/checking my return to verify this problem.
B005IHAIMA,15,15,Nice image quality; poor autofocus.
B005IHAIMA,15,16,The additional (but expensive) FDA-EV1S Electronic Viewfinder is pretty much a must for manual lens use, and also makes the process much more enjoyable to look "through" an actual viewfinder and use that point of contact as an additional point of stability to add steadiness to shots in lower light.
B005IHAIMA,15,17,If this were the only slightly buried item, I would say no problem.
B005IHAIMA,15,18,So far this camera delivers.The cons will be that there are not many lenses available and they are steep in price.
B005IHAIMA,15,19,Plus the flange distance of the mount is so short you can put pretty much ANY lens you want on this thing from Leica/Zeiss/Voigtlander M glass to old Nikon & Canon manual focus lenses.
B005IHAIMA,15,20,No built in viewfinder - you can buy one for $250 extra but I don't want to spend $250 on a viewfinder - a viewfinder and an extra lens take this camera up to 7N territory in cost which has a lot more than just the viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,15,21,The 'upgrade' seems to work, so far I have not had any more issues but I still suspect that it is a software problem since the sound is exactly the same as that produced when you use the control buttons.
B005IHAIMA,15,22,However the mount on the OLED electronic viewfinder is only compatible with NEX-5N and is not compatible with NEX-C3.Update: I now own the OLED view finder.
B005IHAIMA,15,23,The images are just as great, both in contrast and sharpness, when paired with old manual focus lenses once you get the focused right.
B005IHAIMA,15,24,With the latest firmware update, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,16,0,I call back and Im told that I am already in line to get a call from a Tech.
B005IHAIMA,16,1,Who knows, and at this point, who cares.After one more call to Sony, they said they would have a technician call me, but so far, no one has called.
B005IHAIMA,16,2,Finally I contacted Sony support and they told me that the camera had to be sent in for repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,3,The representative assured me that I would have to ship the camera at my expense but it would be repaired and send back at no charge.
B005IHAIMA,16,4,FURTHER UPDATE  ***After dodging my calls, I finally gave up on Sony support.
B005IHAIMA,16,5,My revised rating and review is based off the poor experience with Sony Technical Support and the repair of the issue.I contacted Sony Service using the repair number of my Service Call repair, after receiving my "repaired" 5n and noticing the new sound issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,6,Unfortunately they require that the camera be shipped to a Sony service center for repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,7,My first was returned before being aware of the Service Call issued by Sony for the clicking issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,8,I call Sony Service and reference the email about the expedited return and repair as well as my original repair #.
B005IHAIMA,16,9,My next camera will probably be a Nikon or a Canon, from a company that actually takes pride in their cameras.
B005IHAIMA,16,10,I just called Sony and they confirmed that the issue is still there and that customers need to send their $700 cameras if they find the clicking issue.I asked them whether they can tell me a way to figure out whether the issue is still present but they said they cannot.
B005IHAIMA,16,11,Defective after Sony Repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,12,You sure you want to buy something new at a cost of $700 and send it back straight to the service center and wait for 5 days or more and still have that problem there after it comes back?
B005IHAIMA,16,13,The person again states that the Tech is already set to call me.The next day I get the call.
B005IHAIMA,16,14,TBH, Sony customer service was very good and they paid for shipping.
B005IHAIMA,16,15,Again they do call but not when Im available, but do leave a voicemail that I should call back.
B005IHAIMA,16,16,I received this camera around 11/10 and called the next day for a replacement.
B005IHAIMA,16,17,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,16,18,A day later I received an email advising I would receive a response soon.Two days later I receive an email from a Tech stating they would overnight the body and expedite the repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,19,Sony is finally acknowledging the problem just not saying what it is and if the fix will completely fix the problem.
B005IHAIMA,16,20,I later find out they tried to call but I was not avialable.
B005IHAIMA,16,21,But back it goes to Sony for repair, since I'm now out of the return period.
B005IHAIMA,16,22,After the long wait, you would think Sony has fixed the clicking issue and the defective ones are all depleted from the channels.
B005IHAIMA,16,23,Immediately upon receiving my exhange I sent the body in for the click repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,24,Don't know the Sony repair engineers assessed it as physically damaged.Gonna get it back, sell it for whatever I can get and swear never to buy a Sony product again!!!
B005IHAIMA,17,0,After it focuses you can also manually fine-tune the focus to your object.
B005IHAIMA,17,1,No auto ISR on Manual mode (some DSLR's will let you do this).Overall,
B005IHAIMA,17,2,I use my manual lenses on M or A modes, but have been using several of the scene modes where it will adjust shutter speed and ISO and other parameters to give you their scene shot.
B005IHAIMA,17,3,The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.
B005IHAIMA,17,4,Manual adjustments....don't be scared....no problem.
B005IHAIMA,17,5,Having the two cameras set up differently means not having to fumble around trying to change menu settings btw auto and manual while on a shoot.
B005IHAIMA,17,6,The controls are much better, allowing things like manual focus, manual exposure, etc.
B005IHAIMA,17,7,As he has been using a DSLR for awhile now, the unclear settings didn't set him back as much as us.
B005IHAIMA,17,8,I then used the Right Key Setting on the rotary dial for White Balance, and the Soft Key B Setting for ISO.
B005IHAIMA,17,9,It's simple, just switch to the Menu mode and then select Brightness/Color and ISO setting is right there.
B005IHAIMA,17,10,If you shoot manual focus lenses and/or in RAW mode, the C3 probably is sufficient.
B005IHAIMA,17,11,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,17,12,The touch focusing and focus tracking are wonderful.One other thing that surprised me is how useful the intelligent auto setting has turned out.
B005IHAIMA,17,13,On top of that the camera has no AutoISO in full manual mode and AutoISO is limited to 100-3200.On a DSLR this is less of a problem since it's very quick to switch between A/S modes when the lighting changes.
B005IHAIMA,17,14,90% of my photos are in program mode so I don't even really adjust aperture or shutter.
B005IHAIMA,17,15,For most of us, there are only a few special settings that we change with any frequency.
B005IHAIMA,17,16,From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.
B005IHAIMA,17,17,I have the 18-55mm and 55-210mm lenses.PROS* Sony's Focus Peaking feature makes manual focus really easy for manual first-timers like me.
B005IHAIMA,17,18,With the NEX-5N, I have to press Menu, scroll to Shoot Mode, scroll from iAuto to Program mode, press Menu again (because selecting another shooting mode kicks you out), select the Brightness/Color menu, scroll to DRO/Auto HDR option and select Auto HDR (or other DRO/HDR mode).
B005IHAIMA,17,19,With the Canon S95 point-and-shoot, I can switch from Auto to Scene mode through the mode dial and then select HDR option (if I left it in HDR mode then I don't even have to scroll and I've switched to HDR mode in the flick of a dial).
B005IHAIMA,17,20,As someone who usually shoots in aperture priority or manual mode, I'm used to making all the exposure decisions for my photos.
B005IHAIMA,17,21,Everyone should give manual lenses a shot since the camera offers several options when focuses.
B005IHAIMA,17,22,With customization, most of the functions I change often are very easy to access (ISO, exposure compensation, white balance, AF/MF, AF mode, AF area, metering mode).
B005IHAIMA,17,23,Camera focuses very quickly in all light conditions.
B005IHAIMA,17,24,One thing this camera is lacking is a setting that would let me set a maximum automatic ISO.
B005IHAIMA,18,0,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,18,1,(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,2,I also noticed the same exact spots when is happened to use iso 100 and 1 second shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,3,Very small lag on the shutter.
B005IHAIMA,18,4,Then, of course, you would like to change shutter speed, f/stop, and the ISO setting.
B005IHAIMA,18,5,The images are superb, the start up time and shooting speed are fast!
B005IHAIMA,18,6,I love that I can switch from movie to still by using different buttons (movie button starts and stops movie, and stills are initiated through the shutter release).
B005IHAIMA,18,7,It has made a world of difference in my speed of shooting.
B005IHAIMA,18,8,So we changed it to that setting and spent awhile trying to make faces while partially pressing the shutter.
B005IHAIMA,18,9,It does take time to figure out the menues, but once you do you will find this camera very responsive with nearly no shutter lag.
B005IHAIMA,18,10,Most cameras have to use slow shutter speeds indoors in ambient light, because they just can't control noise and smear at ISO 800 and above.
B005IHAIMA,18,11,The first time I noticed it the iso was 3200.
B005IHAIMA,18,12,Switching modes is requires several button pressesLowlight auto focusing slow and very unreliableTouchscreen interface nearly useless.
B005IHAIMA,18,13,There is no lag whatsoever from when the shutter is pressed and released!
B005IHAIMA,18,14,Simply hold down the button that you push to take pictures and this camera automatically shoots off in rapid fire mode.
B005IHAIMA,18,15,The most important for me is that it does not have a mode that in I can shoot in RAW while having a minimum shutter of at least, say, 1/125s for shooting my kids activities.
B005IHAIMA,18,16,Turned off face registration and smile shutter (located under "Set Up")Why: these options got in the way of a good photo compositionTRIPODI was able to use the tripod quick release I use for my SLR.
B005IHAIMA,18,17,Also, I can change a lot of the settings that on regular point and shoots I couldn't change i.e. how long the picture review stays on.
B005IHAIMA,18,18,The mechanical wheel will change the shutter speed, and then pushing in the lower portion of the wheel will switch to the f/stop.
B005IHAIMA,18,19,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,18,20,From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.
B005IHAIMA,18,21,If you are like me and are trying to shoot little kids and pets that are constantly in motion, you may only have a split second to capture a smile or a moment when your kids or pets are actually looking at the camera.
B005IHAIMA,18,22,In shutter priority mode, it allows you to select shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,23,The same shot with 800 iso had no trace of the spots.
B005IHAIMA,18,24,It's simple, just switch to the Menu mode and then select Brightness/Color and ISO setting is right there.
B005IHAIMA,19,0,Using this with Eye-Fi card, battery last about 160-200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,19,1,You can buy third-party adapters, but those look a little unstable for mounting a big flash unit to the camera.
B005IHAIMA,19,2,There are also one or two model camera cases that accommodate the flash when it is mounted.
B005IHAIMA,19,3,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,19,4,Sony does sell a larger flash compatible with the NEX-3 and -5 series, which is quite a bit bigger than the included kit flash.
B005IHAIMA,19,5,The following items were included along with the camera: warranty card, paper manual for the NEX-3/NEX-3C/NEX-5/NEX-5C, software disk, neck strap, usb cable, battery and charger and flash accessory with its respectable case.FIRST IMPRESSIONSI knew this camera was going to be small and compact, but when I took it out of its protective bag, it was even smaller than I anticipated.
B005IHAIMA,19,6,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,19,7,great camera, but it has one problem that is fatal, the flash design is flawed.
B005IHAIMA,19,8,it can't be assessed as a cons but just compare photos few times and you can expect how they will differ on the computer screen.
B005IHAIMA,19,9,buy it nowww!
B005IHAIMA,19,10,They fix this in newer models with the universal horseshoe, but as long as you are just an average Joe who will just go with the included flash, it isn't a deal breaker.
B005IHAIMA,19,11,I can either have a viewfinder of a flash on, not both.
B005IHAIMA,19,12,The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.
B005IHAIMA,19,13,Well, there is, but it's a Sony proprietary slot-thing that is a pain in the neck to work with in the field.
B005IHAIMA,19,14,I was not able to attach the flash at all and it kept breaking the contact, consequently the flash would not fire.
B005IHAIMA,19,15,This allows it to run some apps, use a remote viewfinder, and wirelessly transfer photos from the camera.
B005IHAIMA,19,16,the accessory flash from sony which is higher and can make bouncing is expenive (148 US$).
B005IHAIMA,19,17,The only complaint I have about this camera is that the flash was a bit annoying to carry around separately and seemed like it could fall off easily.
B005IHAIMA,19,18,I figured the battery was dead, so I threw it on the charger.
B005IHAIMA,19,19,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,19,20,the screw that secures the attachment of the flash to the top of the camera battery is inaccessible to those that have big fingers!
B005IHAIMA,19,21,I'm a long time Nikon user, going back over 40 years.
B005IHAIMA,19,22,Awesome Still Images and Video Quality.
B005IHAIMA,19,23,But note that you cannot fit the camera into some of the cases specifically made for the Sony NEX series if the flash is mounted to the top of the camera.
B005IHAIMA,19,24,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,20,0,Its a sony.
B005IHAIMA,20,1,The zoom is okay but I don't have much to compare it to.
B005IHAIMA,20,2,Durability and good looks...its a Sony.
B005IHAIMA,20,3,I would go for a slightly more expensive DSLR for that such as a Canon Ti.
B005IHAIMA,20,4,You can spend twice as much on an SLR, but you won't get better pictures.
B005IHAIMA,20,5,I own a Canon 5DMKII and this camera produces images that compare with the results I get from the big Canon... highly recommended...
B005IHAIMA,20,6,This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings.
B005IHAIMA,20,7,That is pretty common for digital cameras, but still a little disappointing considering the price of this camera.
B005IHAIMA,20,8,I upgraded from a super-zoom (lumix fz35).
B005IHAIMA,20,9,Sure, lens selection is limited (for now), but I really just love this camera!
B005IHAIMA,20,10,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,20,11,So far this camera delivers.The cons will be that there are not many lenses available and they are steep in price.
B005IHAIMA,20,12,I have for the last 10 years just had a canon powershot that I could put in my pocket.
B005IHAIMA,20,13,You may like to look for a good used Sony 16mm pancake lens, or a used 16-50 power zoom, as I did.B./
B005IHAIMA,20,14,Recommended for size, weight, image quality, video quality and reliability.
B005IHAIMA,20,15,That has turned out to be a good lens that gives me some of the compact size and image quality that I felt was lacking.
B005IHAIMA,20,16,I used to use a Canon SD1000 for a pocket shooter, but that was limited in usefulness (obviously).
B005IHAIMA,20,17,It looks that Sony came up with a fix and the noise is not longer an issue...at least in my case.Some friends of mine have the regular and bulky ones and this one is so compact and better looking.
B005IHAIMA,20,18,It is still going strong and we use it all the time without fail it takes the nicest photos with the least amount of out of focus shots I have ever had.
B005IHAIMA,20,19,No problems at 1080p/24fps.Only regret is we didn't buy this a year ago.PROS:Amazing picture and video quality.
B005IHAIMA,20,20,It shoots as good as my friends big canon camera and the focus is crispy and sharp.
B005IHAIMA,20,21,No noise, nice and compact camera.
B005IHAIMA,20,22,Your lens options are quite limited and pretty expensive.
B005IHAIMA,20,23,good price and item! very good pictures taken by this camera, I'll get other lens to shot special pictures.
B005IHAIMA,20,24,The pictures posted on Amazon are very good at hiding the true size of this lens.I also bought the 16mm wide angle lens for its compact profile, and was not disappointed.
B005IHAIMA,21,0,Not exactly portable/pocket with the kit lens attached--you may have to get the 16mm pancake lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,1,I wish the lens cap had a leash.
B005IHAIMA,21,2,Negatif yani ise lens portfoyunun zayif olmasi.
B005IHAIMA,21,3,So I bought the NEX-5N with the 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,4,I also bought 16mm lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,5,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.
B005IHAIMA,21,6,To combat this, you need to hold the adapter or lens with your left hand.
B005IHAIMA,21,7,The lens is a little bulky but hasn't been an issue.
B005IHAIMA,21,8,Mine came with a SILVER lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,9,I have yet to buy additional lenses, but plan on grabbing the larger zoon lens and the macro lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,10,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.
B005IHAIMA,21,11,A dust cap was placed over the sensor opening for shipment, but otherwise, as far as I can tell nothing was done to it.
B005IHAIMA,21,12,I found it to be uncomfortable to hold the lens because it was an extra 1-1.5 inches further from the camera, so I placed my hand under the adapter.
B005IHAIMA,21,13,Body Only: $600Tamron 17-50mm: $425 (after $75 rebate)Tamron 70-300mm: $350 (after $100 rebate)Total: $1,375.00CONCLUSIONNeedless to say, I ended up returning the NEX-5N, 50mm lens and adapter.
B005IHAIMA,21,14,You should have no problem trying to get "that shot" if this adapter is part of your system.PRACTICALITYI would assume that the average user who purchased this camera with the 18-55mm lens (and possibly the 55-210mm lens) would not be disappointed.
B005IHAIMA,21,15,I got the NEX-5N with 18-55mm lens, in 2 days with Amazon prime.
B005IHAIMA,21,16,I purchased the kit with the 18-55m lens and the camera takes flawless shots.
B005IHAIMA,21,17,But the Amazon ad for the camera and lens combo for the BLACK body shows it with a matching BLACK 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,18,The clicking problem persists and I'm not sure the camera case was even opened.
B005IHAIMA,21,19,This was more comfortable, but now it would be impossible to zoom or MF with the lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,20,The lens looks like it is hulking out and the hand grip, while useful, isn't pretty.
B005IHAIMA,21,21,For a kit lens, I am impressed.
B005IHAIMA,21,22,I even found by accident a case for my 18-55mm lens here on Amazon under Heiden Traveler Cylinder Watch Case and it just happens to hold and protect my lens perfectly.
B005IHAIMA,21,23,Lens is SILVER not BLACK!!
B005IHAIMA,21,24,As of this review, the following are the available E-Mount lenses for purchase:16mm (SEL16F28); 24mm Zeiss (SEL25F18Z); 30mm Macro (SEL30M35; 50mm (SEL50F18); 18-55mm (SEL1855); 55-210mm (SEL55210); 18-200mm (SEL18200 & SEL18200LE); Sigma 19mm (400965); Sigma 30mm (330965); Tamron 18-200mm (AFB011-700 & AFB011S-700); Kenko 400mm (KE4008K4); Various fisheye lenses from Bower, Rokinon, Samyang, YasuharaSony is scheduled to release the following lenses within the next few months: 35mm (SEL35F18); 10-18mm (SEL1018); 16-50mm (SELP1650)My plan was to purchase the Sony 16-50mm (SAL1650) and the Sony 55-200mm (SAL55200-2) lenses, but the only problem was the 16-50mm lens is $800 new and the used ones on eBay were not offered by reputable sellers (BTW, the 55-200mm was going to be a temporary lens until I saved enough money for a Sony 70-300mm or 70-400mm G lens).Since the purchase of the 16-50mm lens, 55-200mm lens and LA-EA2 adapter would have set me back well over $1,000 I decided to do some more research for alternative lenses and ended up purchasing the Tamron 17-50mm (AF016M700) and the Tamron 70-300 (AFA005S-700).At first, I could not confirm that these lenses would work with the adapter, but was able to locate examples of people who had successfully paired these lenses with the adapter and NEX-5N camera.Also, at the time of purchase, Tamron offered a $75 MIR on the 17-50mm lens and a $100 MIR on the 70-300mm lens.
B005IHAIMA,22,0,Other than that, it is a great camera especially in low light.
B005IHAIMA,22,1,It's very strongest plus is the high ISO image quality.
B005IHAIMA,22,2,Good for still photo.
B005IHAIMA,22,3,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,22,4,Low light...no problem.
B005IHAIMA,22,5,I can't believe how good this thing is in low light conditions.
B005IHAIMA,22,6,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,22,7,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,22,8,Good job at high ISO (low light).Con:
B005IHAIMA,22,9,Still, you can get great shots at extremely low light with amazing color that was just not possible at this price range until now.The kit lens is good and much better than I expected based upon some of the reviews I read.
B005IHAIMA,22,10,Very good camera and a very good image.
B005IHAIMA,22,11,I have been able to take low light shots, indoor, sunny outdoor, nighttime etc. without any issues.
B005IHAIMA,22,12,Photos great, video sucks.
B005IHAIMA,22,13,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,22,14,Still, it is a good quality lens that I am happy using, though at a higher price point (5r, natch) I might grumble more about the slowness/sharpness.I found the grip on the camera and the general feel to be good and had no problems in this area.The screen is pretty good in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,22,15,Picture quality is excellent especially low light pics.
B005IHAIMA,22,16,The first being that at higher ISO levels in low light there is a fair deal of noise.
B005IHAIMA,22,17,Nice image quality; poor autofocus.
B005IHAIMA,22,18,Even at night with nothing but moon light.
B005IHAIMA,22,19,I've taken inside shots at night with minimal ambient light, handheld with no flash at ISO setting 25,600 and they turned out very clear with minimal graininess.
B005IHAIMA,22,20,It performed much better than my other cameras, but I was not blown away.For standard indoor lighting, the Sony does do pretty well.
B005IHAIMA,22,21,Also, it is very light in weight which helps.The color accuracy is very good.
B005IHAIMA,22,22,For instance, a standard outdoor shot will show great color and detail throughout the image, from the pavement to the sky.
B005IHAIMA,22,23,The camera takes beautiful photos and allows for some great effects within the camera if you don't want to edit your photo using PhotoShop or GIMP.
B005IHAIMA,22,24,Too bad because the camera itself is great.
B005IHAIMA,23,0,You can bet that when I buy another camera, it will be from Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,1,Too bad I have to return it to Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,2,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.
B005IHAIMA,23,3,I have returned the product.
B005IHAIMA,23,4,Still Clickin' I just bought this camera last week (Aug 1).
B005IHAIMA,23,5,Overall, this really is a good product!
B005IHAIMA,23,6,Why the still sell this camera ???Don't buy it !
B005IHAIMA,23,7,Amazon was very good to me when I had to return once before (no strings), but if I had to do this now for clicking or suspicion, I'll have to pay for return shipment to Cameta.
B005IHAIMA,23,8,I bought the Canon T3i and returned, Sony A65 and returned again.
B005IHAIMA,23,9,I can't return the camera but I will return the 18-200 lens.
B005IHAIMA,23,10,I dont want to play camera roulette when I want to buy a new product and waste my money and time guessing what will work.
B005IHAIMA,23,11,I just bought it two days ago and received it today.
B005IHAIMA,23,12,I bought this camera about a year and a half ago.
B005IHAIMA,23,13,I'm returning the camera to day to Best Buy.DO THE RIGHT THING SONY, RECALL YOUR DEFECTIVE CAMERA!DO THE RIGHT THING BEST BUY, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!DO THE RIGHT THING AMAZON, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!
B005IHAIMA,23,14,Why Is Amazon still selling defective models of this camera?
B005IHAIMA,23,15,I bought the first one just before a trip to Japan, and during the first week of the trip it just died for no apparent reason.
B005IHAIMA,23,16,This puts me just 4 days of my return window with Amazon closing so I am forced to return the defective camera for refund.
B005IHAIMA,23,17,It was January 30, and I had one more day before Amazon's extended return period for the holidays ended.
B005IHAIMA,23,18,You then have to argue with Sony about replacing the new camera you sent to them for repair - good luck with that.
B005IHAIMA,23,19,I bought my NEX-5N from Amazon and it arrived promptly on 10/17/2012.
B005IHAIMA,23,20,UPDATE: 21 FEB 2012: Amazon appears to be looking into this issue now - I believe they are intercepting/checking my return to verify this problem.
B005IHAIMA,23,21,I didn't pay $700 to get a defective camera that needed to be fixed.
B005IHAIMA,23,22,When I got back home, I decided to just get a replacement from Amazon, because I still liked the camera design and was hoping that I just had a lemon.
B005IHAIMA,23,23,I also bought 16mm lens.
B005IHAIMA,23,24,So when I asked for a 3rd replacement they said the policy is 2 tries then refund so I'll be returning both after all.
B005IHAIMA,24,0,This change has made me more willing to learn and adopt to the different sets of controls in these cameras.
B005IHAIMA,24,1,With that being said, the touchscreen menu is rather fool/idiot-proof because there are instructions on each menu and even helpful tips on how that function would be useful.
B005IHAIMA,24,2,Under the "Setup" Menu", one can proceed to the Custom Key Settings.
B005IHAIMA,24,3,I like that you can set up to 5 menu items under a custom button and switch things fast.
B005IHAIMA,24,4,Touchscreen menu is not as confusing as some people said.
B005IHAIMA,24,5,The help menu does really help with basic use of the camera.
B005IHAIMA,24,6,You can set the controls to hot keys for easy access.
B005IHAIMA,24,7,90 degrees up is a godsend for a variety of situations.THE NEUTRAL:The menu system takes a bit of getting used to, but once learned, is fairly easy to navigate.
B005IHAIMA,24,8,I only changed a few menu items from what dpreview.com
B005IHAIMA,24,9,The instruction manual details this.
B005IHAIMA,24,10,From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.
B005IHAIMA,24,11,Even though you can access most menu items through the physical dial and buttons, the touch screen works very fast.
B005IHAIMA,24,12,It's simple, just switch to the Menu mode and then select Brightness/Color and ISO setting is right there.
B005IHAIMA,24,13,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,24,14,I didnt even get a users manual with mine and it only took me 20minutes to go through all the menus and adjust settings to my liking.
B005IHAIMA,24,15,I thought maybe there was a setting in the menu to switch from PAL to NTSC, so I referenced the manual and to make a long story short, there is not a way to change this.
B005IHAIMA,24,16,There are a myriad of settings to chose from, and the controls seem quite intuitive.The camera body itself is very light weight and feels good in the hand.
B005IHAIMA,24,17,Sony, if you read these Amazon reviews, please add the option to control shooting mode from the bottom-right button on the camera!
B005IHAIMA,24,18,My mindset is essentially that of learning and adopting to the different camera controls rather than one wanting to maintain a consistent set of controls among the different cameras.
B005IHAIMA,24,19,But don't expect miracles; you'll still have to learn some basics about photography, as I'm finding out.
B005IHAIMA,24,20,I think the camera and lens looks comical.The menus - They make sense, but for the sake of simplicity with the button layout, sometimes you have to go in and out of the menus to get the settings you want.
B005IHAIMA,24,21,You can program these settings for quick access.
B005IHAIMA,24,22,This wheel delves deeper into the menu option for specific functions.
B005IHAIMA,24,23,If you're someone that doesn't care to learn the manual settings of a camera, this camera has a lot of automatic functions to choose from but it has great manual functions as well.
B005IHAIMA,24,24,The small size isn't a bad thing for me because I have medium sized hands and the camera was reasonably easy to grip with my right hand.A really nice feature of this camera is the tilt-able touch-screen.
B005IHAIMA,25,0,My next camera will probably be a Nikon or a Canon, from a company that actually takes pride in their cameras.
B005IHAIMA,25,1,DO NOT BUY UNTIL SONY ADDRESSES CLICKING ISSUE.
B005IHAIMA,25,2,I have to explain that the camera has already been sent in for that issue and that the problem is something else.
B005IHAIMA,25,3,M. F. Click issue is a big problem for this product.
B005IHAIMA,25,4,I'm a long time Nikon user, going back over 40 years.
B005IHAIMA,25,5,This was an upgrade from a Nikon P100 model.
B005IHAIMA,25,6,Inanilmaz. 2 sene once caldirdigim Nikon D200'den sonra iyi bir kamera almanin cok pahaliya mal olacagini dusunuyordum.
B005IHAIMA,25,7,Don't buy this camera.
B005IHAIMA,25,8,The clicking is still an issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,9,This is REALLY disappointing and as much as I wanted to buy this camera, I will not and do not recommend to do so.
B005IHAIMA,25,10,Sony is finally acknowledging the problem just not saying what it is and if the fix will completely fix the problem.
B005IHAIMA,25,11,great camera, but it has one problem that is fatal, the flash design is flawed.
B005IHAIMA,25,12,I found this camera to be a good substitute for my DSLR when I travel.Ali Julia review
B005IHAIMA,25,13,But Sony evidently has serious quality control problems.
B005IHAIMA,25,14,If you are going from a straight point and shoot or even a model like the Nikon P100 then you will find my review helpful.
B005IHAIMA,25,15,Thought you can cheat ????For all who are going to buy this product and just bought, make sure you see the "Unboxing videos" in You-tube and check you have similar packings / New product stickers.
B005IHAIMA,25,16,I first purchased Sony NEX-C3 and liked  many things about it, but two problems caused me to trade it in for Sony NEX-5N, which addressed those two problems.
B005IHAIMA,25,17,I love taking photos of the kiddies/family throughout the year.
B005IHAIMA,25,18,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,25,19,See my detailed product review of the NEX-5N at: [...]
B005IHAIMA,25,20,I bought the silver model and reviewed it before I discovered/heard off the clicking issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,21,I just called Sony and they confirmed that the issue is still there and that customers need to send their $700 cameras if they find the clicking issue.I asked them whether they can tell me a way to figure out whether the issue is still present but they said they cannot.
B005IHAIMA,25,22,Sony admitted the issue but never provided a solution.
B005IHAIMA,25,23,Hopefully, we have an updated model and won't experience that issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,24,I dont want to play camera roulette when I want to buy a new product and waste my money and time guessing what will work.
B002IPHIEG,0,0,battery life5.-touch
B002IPHIEG,0,1,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,0,2,I used it as soon as I got the battery charged - and that, the battery, is the only thing I can say is a slight negative.
B002IPHIEG,0,3,Battery life seems pretty good.So what's not to like about this camera?1.
B002IPHIEG,0,4,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,0,5,Battery does not last as long as the old Sony I have (T-3 and T-30)2.
B002IPHIEG,0,6,As soon as the battery charged, I started using the camera.
B002IPHIEG,0,7,Battery life is better than any other compact digital I have owned.
B002IPHIEG,0,8,I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.
B002IPHIEG,0,9,Long story short, outdoor pics were great, the camera size was excellent, and battery life was out of this world.
B002IPHIEG,0,10,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,0,11,My only negative is it didn't have a Memory Stick included.The battery doesn't last as long as the T100.
B002IPHIEG,0,12,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,0,13,Great little digital.
B002IPHIEG,0,14,Otherwise this is a great little camera with nice features.
B002IPHIEG,0,15,I used to always buy Casio for my point and shoots, my SLR is also a NIKON but I've only heard great things about Sony from my friends only downside being the battery life so I made sure to buy an extra battery...apparently they've improved on that issue and the battery life has been fine.
B002IPHIEG,0,16,I love this camera, this is my second in four years....I dropped the first from my horse.....This camera has a great slim design that fits well into a pocket...it takes great pictures and the batteries last a long time.
B002IPHIEG,0,17,Haven't shot any video.
B002IPHIEG,0,18,It is just there all the time.
B002IPHIEG,0,19,I bought the camera last week and took shots for a few hours and compared against my relatively old Fuji Finepix f40fd.The good:1) Cool features.
B002IPHIEG,0,20,The battery charger is well designed with no cord so it is easy to carry around.
B002IPHIEG,0,21,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,0,22,This camera is small enough to go any where you go and take decent quality photos.
B002IPHIEG,0,23,here's the things I love about the camera:1.-
B002IPHIEG,0,24,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,1,0,Screen delamination or is it moisture haze?
B002IPHIEG,1,1,It also has a touch screen feature which I'm not so fond of.
B002IPHIEG,1,2,Love the touch screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,3,The camera is all touch screen and is more of an iPod Touch feel to it.
B002IPHIEG,1,4,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.
B002IPHIEG,1,5,Some people might not like the touch screen, but it's actually quite easy to manipulate.
B002IPHIEG,1,6,The touch screen is very sensitive.
B002IPHIEG,1,7,The screen gets smudged so easily.
B002IPHIEG,1,8,The important thing is to not touch the adhesive.
B002IPHIEG,1,9,The touch screen is very intuitive and responsive.
B002IPHIEG,1,10,Remarkable, actually.The touch screen is easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,1,11,A perfect sized protector will slightly overlap the screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,12,When your shots look good on the view screen, they will be even more pleasing on a correctly calibrated HD monitor.2) The white balance options never seem to look right on the view screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,13,I've found that it's best to make those decisions looking at the pictures at full size on a computer screen, rather than on the camera screen -- a shot that looks washed out or too bright on the camera screen is often perfect when seen on a larger monitor.
B002IPHIEG,1,14,However, due to the size, close-ups, video quality, and touch screen, I would recommend this camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,15,The best thing is that screen touch sensitivity improves with the application of a protector.
B002IPHIEG,1,16,I love that it doesn't have a touch screen (I don't have the patience for those) which adds to it's ease of use.
B002IPHIEG,1,17,But the Touch Screen drove me crazy.
B002IPHIEG,1,18,Took great pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,1,19,These images needed to impress on a 67" HD screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,20,It will mar or scratch the film and possibly damage the very screen you are trying to protect!
B002IPHIEG,1,21,And the 3 inch touch screen would be a very nice upgrade from my tiny 1.2 or so inch on the canon.Since the big thing I was looking for was better indoor pictures with lower light and less grainy blacks, that was the first set of shots I took.
B002IPHIEG,1,22,Like other LCD screens, it can be hard to see in bright sunlight, but it's still usable.All in all, I'm very happy with the TX1.
B002IPHIEG,1,23,Certain features of this camera have greatly impressed me.
B002IPHIEG,1,24,The view screen is very unforgiving and will lead you to believe your shots are more contrasty and grainy than they actually are.
B002IPHIEG,2,0,Better in some aspects than a canon Rebel Xsi.
B002IPHIEG,2,1,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,2,2,Oh and one more thing, don't tell me to just get a DSLR or it's just a P &S; - I know that already!
B002IPHIEG,2,3,Oh and one more thing, don't tell me to just get a DSLR or it's just a P &S; - I know that already!
B002IPHIEG,2,4,Even in auto mode, the Canon took consistently good pictures, important when handing your camera to someone to shoot your picture.
B002IPHIEG,2,5,Date Stamp is done with the PMB software.HD video quality is actually better than the DMC-ZS3 AVCHD-lite.
B002IPHIEG,2,6,The Canon has faster glass (f/2.0),
B002IPHIEG,2,7,When taking pictures in Low light without a tripod this camera absolutely kicks the ass of the canon rebel xsi (with stabilised lens).
B002IPHIEG,2,8,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,2,9,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,2,10,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,2,11,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,2,12,It does take better photos in low light, but overall picture quality for an amateur user isn't that great.
B002IPHIEG,2,13,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,2,14,I took about 700 pictures and shot about 50 videos with the Canon on my trip and feel that I clearly made the right choice.
B002IPHIEG,2,15,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,2,16,You can upgrade your video card, but that is expensive and doesn't even work that well.
B002IPHIEG,2,17,I loved all of the features of this camera but the first thing that i care about is quality of photos which this camera has lack of it.
B002IPHIEG,2,18,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,2,19,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,2,20,You can also put the camera in High ISO mode, which allows for faster shutter speed.Canon's soon to be released S90 seems to have become the great new hope for shutterbugs longing for a small point and shoot that takes great low light photos instead of the WX1, primarily because it not only also has a fast lens and improved sensor, but also manual controls and raw capabilities.2.
B002IPHIEG,2,21,If the camera has trouble focusing you simply touch the screen where you want it to focus and it focuses on that spot.
B002IPHIEG,2,22,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,2,23,The zoom capabilities and low-light shooting is unlike any point and shoot I've owned.
B002IPHIEG,2,24,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,3,0,The mono-microphone is pretty sensitive and provides a good sound quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,1,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,2,Leave quality aside, Sony sucks.
B002IPHIEG,3,3,The camera has the usual for Sony good build quality and generally worked fine.
B002IPHIEG,3,4,So I was looking for a small camera with a front microphone which could take good low light movie clips.The new Sony DSC-WX1 seemed perfect for these purposes so I purchased it from Amazon which delivered it very promptly.
B002IPHIEG,3,5,I have a media computer hooked up to my HDTV and the pictures just look terrible!I mentioned above that the video was good and this is true - and I knew this going in - but why did Sony remove the stereo recording?
B002IPHIEG,3,6,I have a media computer hooked up to my HDTV and the pictures just look terrible!I mentioned above that the video was good and this is true - and I knew this going in - but why did Sony remove the stereo recording?
B002IPHIEG,3,7,Although the sound is MONO compared to ZS3's Stereo, but the video quality and easy to work with editing software make up the difference!
B002IPHIEG,3,8,Sony DSC-TX1 is pretty good quality, and fun to use.
B002IPHIEG,3,9,I use it for my blog and the picture quality and audio are great.
B002IPHIEG,3,10,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,3,11,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,3,12,That is why for a number of years I had successively Sony DSC-T1, T30, and T100 ultra-compacts.
B002IPHIEG,3,13,I've used stereo audio before which is nice, but versatility and image quality must prevail.
B002IPHIEG,3,14,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,3,15,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,3,16,The microphone is mono, not stereo, but it's sensitive and the sound quality is good.The touch screen is very responsive, well-organized, and easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,3,17,Great customer service.
B002IPHIEG,3,18,I prefer small pocket size cameras which can take nice still photos and good movie clips.
B002IPHIEG,3,19,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,20,Great features, simple and easy to use settings.
B002IPHIEG,3,21,Fortunately, when returning to P you'll find your settings have returned.
B002IPHIEG,3,22,I have said a million times say that I love my DSC-T500It films amazing HD video, takes great photos, and overall is just a perfect pocket cam.
B002IPHIEG,3,23,As others have commented, you really do need to read the manual, experiment with the settings, and learn how to get the best results with it.But no one should be buying this camera because they want the best possible picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,24,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.
B002IPHIEG,4,0,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,4,1,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,4,2,It auto adjust to light so you always get great pictures.
B002IPHIEG,4,3,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,4,However, did you ever try looking at "no flash" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode?
B002IPHIEG,4,5,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,4,6,It has an anti blur mode meaning that it shoots 5 shots and blends them into one to create one great picture.
B002IPHIEG,4,7,What shots I took!
B002IPHIEG,4,8,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,4,9,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,4,10,Decrease the EV setting by .07.
B002IPHIEG,4,11,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,4,12,All my shots have turned out great!
B002IPHIEG,4,13,It has an anti-blur mode which is awesome indoors without a flash.
B002IPHIEG,4,14,Great size and lots of features.
B002IPHIEG,4,15,I purchased this camera for the Panorama mode, and low light shooting.
B002IPHIEG,4,16,It's pretty good, WITH THE RIGHT SETTINGS.
B002IPHIEG,4,17,Otherwise this is a great little camera with nice features.
B002IPHIEG,4,18,Controls are laid out sensibly, and it's easy to switch from automated settings to finer image control.One of the coolest new features is Panorama mode, which makes ultra-wide photos quickly and easily.
B002IPHIEG,4,19,Though I'd read, while this camera is a star as a point and shoot for low light, its daytime shots, or shots in artifical light, were not good.
B002IPHIEG,4,20,The indoor shots seem pretty good (I'm still working on this.
B002IPHIEG,4,21,Captures great indoor pictures4.-good
B002IPHIEG,4,22,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,4,23,I confess, I don't quite know the difference between the two modes, and they both churn out terrific low-light photos.The point is, a camera this small probably shouldn't turn out great low light shots.
B002IPHIEG,4,24,Besides the obvious use as seen in the ads, it works extraordinarily well in low light, and even outdoors at dusk.
B002IPHIEG,5,0,Focus is fast.
B002IPHIEG,5,1,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,5,2,I want a camera that I don't know is there, that I can whip out in 2 seconds to snap off a shot.
B002IPHIEG,5,3,Good but poor autofocus.
B002IPHIEG,5,4,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,5,5,Maybe I wasn't doing it right but they didn't seem to help much.The best bet for action and fast moving subjects with this camera seems to be the burst mode, which rips off 10 shots one after another when the shutter is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,5,6,The speed and auto-focusing are good.
B002IPHIEG,5,7,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,5,8,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.
B002IPHIEG,5,9,Whenever I took action shots or shots of kids or pets with the W170, the pictures would always come out blurry.
B002IPHIEG,5,10,Taking pictures with this camera is so much fun.Because it is so thin and light, pressing the shutter release button without adding shake to the shot takes a very steady hand.
B002IPHIEG,5,11,Great camera.
B002IPHIEG,5,12,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,5,13,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,5,14,Every shot is clear with no blurriness.
B002IPHIEG,5,15,A really nice camera.
B002IPHIEG,5,16,If you could control the shutter (which you can't) you might be able to get this camera to better stop action.
B002IPHIEG,5,17,It is very portable and feels nice in the hand.
B002IPHIEG,5,18,On the other hand a recent review of the upcoming S90 indicated that even with a fast lens and manual controls (allowing you to set the shutter) it wasn't fast enough for action, sports and kids.
B002IPHIEG,5,19,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,5,20,It could have used some more zoom and people with large hands might find it hard to hold.
B002IPHIEG,5,21,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,5,22,I rather prefer to use the 2-second timer, which gives me just enough time after pressing the button to steady up the focus frame on my subject.
B002IPHIEG,5,23,The second feature allows this camera to shoot up to 10f/sec.
B002IPHIEG,5,24,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,6,0,Taking HD Video takes up so much space on the memory card.
B002IPHIEG,6,1,Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.
B002IPHIEG,6,2,We do a lot of socializing and it's nice to have something easy to record the memories.
B002IPHIEG,6,3,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.
B002IPHIEG,6,4,Date Stamp is done with the PMB software.HD video quality is actually better than the DMC-ZS3 AVCHD-lite.
B002IPHIEG,6,5,Since my other cameras have been Sony cameras, I have already had memory stick cards and readers, so to me, its not a big deal.
B002IPHIEG,6,6,I bought an 8 gig card for it and it seems adequate so far.This is a great product that has really worked well for me.
B002IPHIEG,6,7,You can upgrade your video card, but that is expensive and doesn't even work that well.
B002IPHIEG,6,8,Nice Small Camera.
B002IPHIEG,6,9,Incidentally, the newest duo "pro" cards are not compatible with some older readers even if they accommodate Sony cards.... go figure.4)
B002IPHIEG,6,10,Overall: If you are interested in a small, light, good looking and compact point-and-forget camera that makes ok pictures, this camera might work for you.
B002IPHIEG,6,11,The indoor shots seem pretty good (I'm still working on this.
B002IPHIEG,6,12,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,6,13,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,6,14,need a bigger memory.
B002IPHIEG,6,15,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,6,16,I was always impressed with their speed, size, and the great pictures I would get from them.
B002IPHIEG,6,17,Be prepared to download to the computer, or a portable computer drive that stores a lot of gigs.
B002IPHIEG,6,18,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,6,19,The SONY Cable also has Video/Audio connectors, so its a bulky cable.GOOD- Flash Setting - Unlike most Canon's I have had you can turn OFF the flash and it stays off after turning the camera off/on again.
B002IPHIEG,6,20,If you have had other cameras that used SD, just think of making a $20 investment into a very reliable, fast card for your camera, and use the SD card in your Wii.The only two complaints I have for this camera are it's low light picture taking, and the format it uses when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,6,21,It worked better than I expected!
B002IPHIEG,6,22,With video recording, I was very happy to finally be able to zoom in and out while recording, however, I am not happy that it records in mp4 format.
B002IPHIEG,6,23,If you plan on taking any video you will def.
B002IPHIEG,6,24,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.
B002IPHIEG,7,0,Great little digital.
B002IPHIEG,7,1,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,7,2,A great camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,3,Great Pocket Camera With A Little Tinkering.
B002IPHIEG,7,4,Very small (fits in a pocket) and very easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,7,5,I'm strictly point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,7,6,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,7,7,Best point and shoot available.
B002IPHIEG,7,8,Nice Small Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,9,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,7,10,Great camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,11,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,7,12,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,13,Best compact digital camera I've owned so far!
B002IPHIEG,7,14,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,7,15,Wasn't looking for dslr quality, but something that looked  nice would be useful.
B002IPHIEG,7,16,Picture quality is fantastic for such a small camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,17,Very good pocket camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,18,So far, it is working great for me.
B002IPHIEG,7,19,The Camera That Stole Me Away From Canon!
B002IPHIEG,7,20,Best Point & Shoot Digital Camera I Ever Got ;) SONY TX1.
B002IPHIEG,7,21,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,7,22,an excellent point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,7,23,For a camera of this price, I feel it needs a much better zoom.
B002IPHIEG,7,24,This is a very very nice pocket camera.
B002IPHIEG,8,0,The image quality is not going to be as good as a larger camera with a non-folded lens system and a bigger sensor.
B002IPHIEG,8,1,As a former owner of a Sony A700 with 16-80mm Carl z lenses, plus a whole bag of long range lenses.
B002IPHIEG,8,2,Taking a picture with the camera turned sideways to better frame a specific shot shows a lot of distortion from the wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,8,3,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,8,4,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,8,5,The low light capability was good, but not that much better than my Sony H20.
B002IPHIEG,8,6,I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon.
B002IPHIEG,8,7,The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90.
B002IPHIEG,8,8,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,8,9,Great size, good-to-great performance.
B002IPHIEG,8,10,If that's what you're after, you really should buy a DSLR.
B002IPHIEG,8,11,Former DSLR owner.
B002IPHIEG,8,12,I love this camera!GREAT THINGS about this: The slim design with a built-in cover to protect the lens instead of needing a lens cap is great.
B002IPHIEG,8,13,They're much bigger, but the image quality is unmatched.The real reason to buy this camera is to take pictures that you wouldn't take otherwise.
B002IPHIEG,8,14,Dealing with toting all that stuff around, cleaning lenses, I finally got sick of it and sold everything on eBay and bought this camera, sure the image quality will never touch the A700 DSLR but I find the joy of photography is having a camera always with you.
B002IPHIEG,8,15,I needed low light capabilities for indoor and nighttime pictures without a flash and a wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,8,16,Perhaps we may get to see interchangeable lenses on future compact cameras.
B002IPHIEG,8,17,While the Sony was good, the Canon was the clear winner here.
B002IPHIEG,8,18,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,8,19,Sony DSC-TX1 is pretty good quality, and fun to use.
B002IPHIEG,8,20,They both work well, though the results are even better if you brace the camera somehow instead of shooting totally freehand.
B002IPHIEG,8,21,Light and small for the lens range.3)
B002IPHIEG,8,22,I dont think I will get back into DSLR due to the bulky, expensive, complex (think dust on your sensor from lens changing).The price of $259 is mind blowing too given all these features.
B002IPHIEG,8,23,It does take better photos in low light, but overall picture quality for an amateur user isn't that great.
B002IPHIEG,8,24,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,9,0,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,9,1,It is excellent in low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,2,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,9,3,small but wish it better low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,4,Image quality was not what I expected.
B002IPHIEG,9,5,Photo quality under poor light conditions is amazing; photos are better than expected.
B002IPHIEG,9,6,Excellent low lighting performance.
B002IPHIEG,9,7,For me, it was all about picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,8,The low light capability was good, but not that much better than my Sony H20.
B002IPHIEG,9,9,The big disappointmet was the bright light image quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,10,Took great pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,11,Excellent pictures with the right lighting.
B002IPHIEG,9,12,The video quality is excellent.
B002IPHIEG,9,13,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,9,14,It was NOT good at all.
B002IPHIEG,9,15,The colors and lighting in the videos are excellent.
B002IPHIEG,9,16,It's been said that these new optics have TWICE the low light quality as the previous cameras.
B002IPHIEG,9,17,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,9,18,Picture quality is better than I have had on past cameras, and come out pretty well.
B002IPHIEG,9,19,Low light shots were noisier than my Fuji.
B002IPHIEG,9,20,No, the quality of the photos is not in the league of the larger camera.
B002IPHIEG,9,21,It does take better photos in low light, but overall picture quality for an amateur user isn't that great.
B002IPHIEG,9,22,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,9,23,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,9,24,The other disappointment is the low light image quality which is supposed to be much better than average.
B002IPHIEG,10,0,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,10,1,Excellent buy for its price; a really good little camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,2,I have had this camera for a little over a year.
B002IPHIEG,10,3,So far, it is working great for me.
B002IPHIEG,10,4,What a great camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,5,A great camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,6,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,7,I'm somewhat puzzled after reading several of the poor reviews for this camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,8,I truly believe you'll be very happy if you decide to purchase this camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,9,not much better than my seven year old Sony DSC-T30.
B002IPHIEG,10,10,I did purchase this camera elsewhere.
B002IPHIEG,10,11,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,10,12,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,10,13,Waited until the price came down a bit and bought it.
B002IPHIEG,10,14,Just purchased this camera few days ago and I'm absolutely happy with it..
B002IPHIEG,10,15,The price is somewhat high, but I guess that's what always happens with the hottest new camera model of the year.
B002IPHIEG,10,16,I disregarded several of the negative reviews I read on this, trying to be optimistic, but that isn't working out for me.
B002IPHIEG,10,17,When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked.
B002IPHIEG,10,18,I absolutly love and highly recommend it.
B002IPHIEG,10,19,I mean NOTHING.CAMERA NOT RECOMMENDED.
B002IPHIEG,10,20,I bought this camera a little over a year ago as a Christmas present for my girlfriend.
B002IPHIEG,10,21,Picture quality is better than I have had on past cameras, and come out pretty well.
B002IPHIEG,10,22,If only it took good pictures..
B002IPHIEG,10,23,After a LOT of research, I decided to bite the bullet and get this camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,24,Other than this, I absolutely recommend this product.
B002IPHIEG,11,0,Great features, simple and easy to use settings.
B002IPHIEG,11,1,Great size and lots of features.
B002IPHIEG,11,2,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,11,3,It is very intuitive, and easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,11,4,I'm not a techno wizard, but this camera is pretty easy to use (I do suggest reading the manual because the camera has lots of cool functions) and the photo quality is great.
B002IPHIEG,11,5,So far, it is working great for me.
B002IPHIEG,11,6,The screen is about as easy to navigate as you could ask for.
B002IPHIEG,11,7,Easy to use2.-
B002IPHIEG,11,8,Great little digital.
B002IPHIEG,11,9,A great camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,10,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,11,11,I found it amazingly easy to use with just that little bit of reading.
B002IPHIEG,11,12,That being said, if you are a casual user looking for a point and shoot that is easy and fun to use and small in size, this is the camera for you.
B002IPHIEG,11,13,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,11,14,It's perfect for what I bought it for, and if you read the manual and learn how to use it, you'll get great results.
B002IPHIEG,11,15,So far it has worked really well.
B002IPHIEG,11,16,All the features are a little hard to grasp.
B002IPHIEG,11,17,It also has one of the best touchscreen interfaces I've used on a camera, it's not in the way and it's easy and quick to use.
B002IPHIEG,11,18,A nice advance of over previously-owned T-100, T-300.
B002IPHIEG,11,19,It is very light and easy to carry.
B002IPHIEG,11,20,This could be my user error, so I take some responsibility, it just seems like this should be easy to accomplish.Overall it's a great point and shoot camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,21,As others have commented, you really do need to read the manual, experiment with the settings, and learn how to get the best results with it.But no one should be buying this camera because they want the best possible picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,11,22,For one thing, it is extremely easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,11,23,an excellent point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,11,24,It does take better photos in low light, but overall picture quality for an amateur user isn't that great.
B002IPHIEG,12,0,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,12,1,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,12,2,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,12,3,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!
B002IPHIEG,12,4,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,12,5,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,12,6,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,12,7,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,12,8,The video quality is excellent.
B002IPHIEG,12,9,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,12,10,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,12,11,I use it for my blog and the picture quality and audio are great.
B002IPHIEG,12,12,The video quality is exceptional for a camera of this size as well.
B002IPHIEG,12,13,Haven't shot any video.
B002IPHIEG,12,14,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,12,15,I didn't see the need for it.VIDEO:
B002IPHIEG,12,16,The Panorama features, HD video, and other features make this a no brainer.
B002IPHIEG,12,17,Sony DSC-TX1 is pretty good quality, and fun to use.
B002IPHIEG,12,18,If you're buying it primarily for great pictures you should look at other cameras.
B002IPHIEG,12,19,good features for the price.
B002IPHIEG,12,20,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,12,21,HD Video.
B002IPHIEG,12,22,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,12,23,If you plan on taking any video you will def.
B002IPHIEG,12,24,It still doesn't seem to be as good as my "old" cameras).-
B002IPHIEG,13,0,It did this with the battery that came with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,13,1,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,13,2,It is not unusual to go through two batteries in an hour or two, even when they are fully charged.
B002IPHIEG,13,3,battery life5.-touch
B002IPHIEG,13,4,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,13,5,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,6,Bought the camera and just before one year, the battery cover door broke -not due to mistreating-.
B002IPHIEG,13,7,battery cover can break in one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,8,The battery door is flimsy.-Hard
B002IPHIEG,13,9,If I had it to do over, I would not buy a camera with a touchscreen.One other thing--this thing eats batteries.
B002IPHIEG,13,10,Battery door easily opened.
B002IPHIEG,13,11,Its great if you want Non-Flash photos and are frequently turning the camera off/on in between shots.BAD- Battery Cover - The battery cover seems very flimsy and bows a bit if you hold the camera by it.
B002IPHIEG,13,12,Its battery charger requires only two hours.
B002IPHIEG,13,13,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,13,14,I did this at least a couple of times.
B002IPHIEG,13,15,Now the camera powers on and stays on.Unfortunately, my problems were not over.
B002IPHIEG,13,16,Had this camera for about a month now - its a fine camera and has the usual settings/functions as mentioned by others.
B002IPHIEG,13,17,It's been in a drawer for some time now.
B002IPHIEG,13,18,Manufacturer warranty only good for one year) the camera began failing in multiple ways.I'd power the camera on and immediately a message would pop up indicating that I needed to use a compatible battery, then would power off.
B002IPHIEG,13,19,Once I finally got a battery that functioned again, I found that the shutter would no longer open/close properly.
B002IPHIEG,13,20,I used it as soon as I got the battery charged - and that, the battery, is the only thing I can say is a slight negative.
B002IPHIEG,13,21,When I got home from my 7 day trip, I realized that the first 5 days of my vacation had been deleted without my even knowing it.
B002IPHIEG,13,22,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,13,23,With the first 100 pictures of my trip gone I decided I didn't want to be stressed out every time I ask someone to take a picture of us, not to mention the stress of keeping myself from doing it.
B002IPHIEG,13,24,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,14,0,Screen delamination or is it moisture haze?
B002IPHIEG,14,1,No bevel to the LCD frame.
B002IPHIEG,14,2,The only bad point I have found....is sometimes I hit the touch screen when I am taking the picture and this changes my setting.
B002IPHIEG,14,3,It should have a viewfinder a bit hard to see in direct sunlight.
B002IPHIEG,14,4,Translated to small point and shoot cameras, it's almost impossible for an older pair of eyes to clearly see what's on a 2.7 or 3 inch LCD screen on the back of camera, even if bright sun isn't washing out the screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,5,Most of the time with the WX1 I really can't make out what's on the screen, because to me its all out of focus (the problem is my eyes, not the camera).
B002IPHIEG,14,6,Those can pose some problems when they open when they shouldn't (like in your pocket).The large touch screen makes everything easy.
B002IPHIEG,14,7,Now I notice that my wife's camera is doing the same thing and I don't know what is going on yet but I cannot reccommend this camera now that I have seen both screens go bad in less than two years.
B002IPHIEG,14,8,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.
B002IPHIEG,14,9,If the camera has trouble focusing you simply touch the screen where you want it to focus and it focuses on that spot.
B002IPHIEG,14,10,Display failed after 2 months.
B002IPHIEG,14,11,Shadows and dark areas get crushed.Screen washes out in daylight.
B002IPHIEG,14,12,There wasn't much to complain about.However I noticed last year that my screen was  getting hazy or splotchy; I don't know what to call it but it looks like a window with condensation all over it and I associated it with moisture or humidity "behine" the glass screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,13,don't care if other people think that's bad, because that's the only way I display the pics.)
B002IPHIEG,14,14,Quick and once you get use to the touch screen easy to use! Just took this pocket rocket to San Diego on a trip and it turned out some very good shots in low light and regular day time lighting.
B002IPHIEG,14,15,LCD image quality is surprising bad, with crude contrast and tinged colors.--
B002IPHIEG,14,16,If you take a picture with flash at 24mm, what is a really common use I have to say, it gets a black spot in the lower left corner.
B002IPHIEG,14,17,And then 2-3 weeks ago when I turned it on the display started "going all white" -- first in stripes and then full-screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,18,Durability  First day I severely scratched the screen on the metal rivet putting it in or taking it out of my jeans pocket a camera this small should be designed to be put in a pocket.3.
B002IPHIEG,14,19,The big disappointmet was the bright light image quality.
B002IPHIEG,14,20,But the Touch Screen drove me crazy.
B002IPHIEG,14,21,Disappointing image quality a deal breaker.
B002IPHIEG,14,22,A grainy photo is better than no photo at all.
B002IPHIEG,14,23,The Large LCD screen is Spectacular as is the color in the photos.
B002IPHIEG,14,24,I've had a couple cameras like this and the clear plastic gets scratched quickly.
B002IPHIEG,15,0,I wonder if point and shoot cameras like this one could do better.
B002IPHIEG,15,1,In case you're wondering, it never went back to Amazon although I do wonder if I might regret not having waited for the Canon S90 when that arrives.You can find some test shots I took here: [...]
B002IPHIEG,15,2,Even the low light pictures don't seem to have a noise problem.
B002IPHIEG,15,3,4) Reviewing photos after a shot ... is too slow.
B002IPHIEG,15,4,So why am I reviewing a camera that seems like a downgrade?Well Sony is using a new lens system called the "Exmor R".
B002IPHIEG,15,5,No manual controls.The W300 had full manual controls, and I wonder why Sony couldn't have included them here and really made this a top of the line point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,15,6,Not a real upgrade from DSC-T900.
B002IPHIEG,15,7,It's been said that these new optics have TWICE the low light quality as the previous cameras.
B002IPHIEG,15,8,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,15,9,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,15,10,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,15,11,The other disappointment is the low light image quality which is supposed to be much better than average.
B002IPHIEG,15,12,While waiting to get the camera, I would check Amazon every day to see if anyone who had actually used the camera had put up any reviews yet.
B002IPHIEG,15,13,Zoom is basically absent here, but I don't have a problem with it (especially for the price).
B002IPHIEG,15,14,Slightly better at low light but terrible with good light.
B002IPHIEG,15,15,This camera has the ability to zoom while recording which is something that I have not been able to do in my past Sony point n' shoots.
B002IPHIEG,15,16,Better in some aspects than a canon Rebel Xsi.
B002IPHIEG,15,17,But.. the T900 was slimmer and had a few tiny software upgrades that still made it a great camera.Now just months after the release of the T900, Sony surprisingly pulled the T900 from the shelves and released a new camera called the DSC-TX1.
B002IPHIEG,15,18,This is not to say they are DSLR quality, but they don't look bad at all for a point and shoot.Other positives:4.
B002IPHIEG,15,19,I have a feeling sony is prepping a true sequel to the T500/T900.
B002IPHIEG,15,20,Our 5 year old camera shoots pictures that are much better and sharp.
B002IPHIEG,15,21,The camera can basically see better in the dark then you can.
B002IPHIEG,15,22,It is a lot better with the picture quality especially in low light.
B002IPHIEG,15,23,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,15,24,Second, the autofocus changes haphazardly, switching from foreground to background, sometimes following movement, and preferentially focusing on light sources.
B002IPHIEG,16,0,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,16,1,Sony repaired the damage under the warranty and not cost at all.
B002IPHIEG,16,2,Great customer service.
B002IPHIEG,16,3,I took it to my local camera shop to see if they could fix it, but all they do is send it in to Sony to have them repair it (for $260!).
B002IPHIEG,16,4,They asked for US$400 to repair a tiny door.I am very disappointed for the customer support from Sony.
B002IPHIEG,16,5,So why am I reviewing a camera that seems like a downgrade?Well Sony is using a new lens system called the "Exmor R".
B002IPHIEG,16,6,Sony said they would repair the camera but that means shipping, waiting, and considerable trouble.
B002IPHIEG,16,7,So of course there is no reliable way to take photos and certainly no way to review photos.I called Amazon.com this morning and the customer service representative told me I had to call Sony.I visited the Sony website, entered my information, and was given instructions to ship the camera back to Sony (at my expense) for free warranty repair (luckily it was within the 90 day window).I've owned Canon digital cameras for 7 years and never had a hardware failure in the first three months like this.
B002IPHIEG,16,8,And, when directed to the service website to make a repair request, that malfunctioned too.
B002IPHIEG,16,9,Did anyone at Sony even take this camera out for a night before shipping it?-
B002IPHIEG,16,10,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,16,11,I reported the problem 32 days after buying so I was out of luck with the retailer.
B002IPHIEG,16,12,I now need to buy a new camera for an upcoming trip, and I can assure you it will not be a Sony.Hope this helps,Damian
B002IPHIEG,16,13,I requested for the package to be left at my door with no signature so the shipping company called me within a few minutes to ensure that he would take care of this and gave me his cell phone number in case I needed it.
B002IPHIEG,16,14,Had High Hopes - Defective Product.
B002IPHIEG,16,15,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.
B002IPHIEG,16,16,So I will wait, and see what happens in the next few months.
B002IPHIEG,16,17,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,16,18,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,16,19,You have to package the camera yourself and ship it to Texas for several weeks with no replacement in the interim.
B002IPHIEG,16,20,battery cover can break in one year.
B002IPHIEG,16,21,Now the camera powers on and stays on.Unfortunately, my problems were not over.
B002IPHIEG,16,22,He's picked it up a couple of times, but hasn't yet figured out how to work it...heaven help he should actually READ the manual (which I suggest).
B002IPHIEG,16,23,Video is usually okay, but has two major problems... First, the noise of zooming in and out is recorded very loudly.
B002IPHIEG,16,24,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,17,0,settings adjustments for color hues, saturation.-No
B002IPHIEG,17,1,They looked better if I manually set the ISO, but if I'm just pulling it out for a quick shot, i don't want to have to remember to go to manual settings all the time.
B002IPHIEG,17,2,I know I can always get into manual modes to compensate for things, but I wanted something I didn't always have to do that with.
B002IPHIEG,17,3,When setting on "P" mode I found out that switching the White Balance from "Auto" or "Daylight" to "Flash" in improves outdoor photos color, tone, exposure and warmness.
B002IPHIEG,17,4,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,17,5,The reason it is not a point and shoot is because auto exposure is just wrong.
B002IPHIEG,17,6,Switching to any other mode defaults the settings to the terrible AUTO everything requiring the photographer to reset all those undesirable Sony auto settings.
B002IPHIEG,17,7,Controls are laid out sensibly, and it's easy to switch from automated settings to finer image control.One of the coolest new features is Panorama mode, which makes ultra-wide photos quickly and easily.
B002IPHIEG,17,8,Yeah, turning on the FLASH white balance for outdoor photos (which makes no sense by the way) --SOMETIMES-- does make the normally blueish outdoor photos look more pleasingly orangeish if you can remember to make this cryptic change or use P mode for your outdoor photos.
B002IPHIEG,17,9,You might also want to try different White Balances,setting correctly results in really nice low light shots.Outdoor shots:This camera in iSCN mode seems to keep the lens all the way open(F2.4)and it adjusts the shutter speed(a big No No)resulting in washed out over exposed photos(yuck).The solution: switch to "P" Mode which closes down the lens to around a nice F5.0 to F7.1(much better) and switch the White Balance to "Flash" .
B002IPHIEG,17,10,However, did you ever try looking at "no flash" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode?
B002IPHIEG,17,11,Within those photos I have found out the best settings for the right scenes and conditions.
B002IPHIEG,17,12,It's pretty good, WITH THE RIGHT SETTINGS.
B002IPHIEG,17,13,You may need to set the EV to -.3=>-.7 for less contrasty scenes.
B002IPHIEG,17,14,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,17,15,You have to switch the camera to Handheld Twilight mode and adjust the Exposure Value(EV) from -0.3 to -1.7(this is a very important setting that needs to be set on order to remove the noisyness and grain from the photo, a setting people don't adjust and then complain about how bad the photo looks in low light).
B002IPHIEG,17,16,Took shots at the same time from the same distances with the same lighting, both left on automatic.
B002IPHIEG,17,17,UPDATE: I just found out today that a White Balance setting might be the key to this camera for outdoor shots.
B002IPHIEG,17,18,I hated it doesn't has black and white mode.
B002IPHIEG,17,19,Also for better exposure you can again adjust the EV.Panorama Shots: This one's tricky, from where you press the shutter to start the panorama it locks the exposure at that point.
B002IPHIEG,17,20,In fact, all the auto settings are wrong.
B002IPHIEG,17,21,This camera has the ability to zoom while recording which is something that I have not been able to do in my past Sony point n' shoots.
B002IPHIEG,17,22,No manual controls.The W300 had full manual controls, and I wonder why Sony couldn't have included them here and really made this a top of the line point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,17,23,Fortunately, P with some of the white balance settings used after experimentation will get you great shots.3)
B002IPHIEG,17,24,The SONY seems to handle these bright outdoor shots slightly better with either the P or EASY Settings.All in all, its a fine camera.
B002IPHIEG,18,0,4) Reviewing photos after a shot ... is too slow.
B002IPHIEG,18,1,3) Most importantly for me, the shutter does not click fast enough.
B002IPHIEG,18,2,Instead it takes ... 3 to 5 seconds because you have to wait for the current photo to be processed and then wait wait wait to press the review button and if you press it twice ... oops, your still in picture-taking mode.
B002IPHIEG,18,3,It's been in a drawer for some time now.
B002IPHIEG,18,4,Shutter lag (time from pushing the shutter button until photo taken),is very low for a pocket camera.What's not so good:-Noise reduction smears details at ISO 400 and above.
B002IPHIEG,18,5,I know that folks will say that I must have pressed the wrong button, and that might be so at times.
B002IPHIEG,18,6,Being an SLR user, I am used to instant reaction speed between the moment I press the button and the moment the shutter clicks.
B002IPHIEG,18,7,Surely, the last photo can be put into a memory buffer to immediately be shown when the review button is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,18,8,The zoom is difficult to use it moves to fast.
B002IPHIEG,18,9,I would buy it again.I would ask SONY to change a few things: 1) The power and shutter buttons are too flush and difficult to feel in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,18,10,I do a lot of shooting under pressure.
B002IPHIEG,18,11,So much movement occurs by the subject in the 1 to 4 seconds (depending on lighting) it takes the shutter to click on this Cybershot.
B002IPHIEG,18,12,Someone else said that they had no problem shooting at higher speeds in that setting.
B002IPHIEG,18,13,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.
B002IPHIEG,18,14,The Sony Cyber-shot takes wonderful indoor / low light pictures with fast shutter speed.
B002IPHIEG,18,15,For example: FOUR button pushes to delete a shot you just took.Sadly, I won't be keeping this thing.
B002IPHIEG,18,16,It didn't last long.
B002IPHIEG,18,17,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,18,18,I sometimes dont even need to use the flash!! yes sometimes you don't need the flash at night! it's perfect for night shootings..I only wish it has a button to switch from picture shooting to video... here you have to do it through the touch screen and it needs 2 clicks to switch..by the way the touch screen works wekk..
B002IPHIEG,18,19,I just returned a different camera because the shutter lag was horrible and so was the indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,18,20,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,18,21,Shadows and low light shots even with flash end up RED!- (minor) Placement of on/off button is too far left for one-handed turning on/off.-
B002IPHIEG,18,22,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,18,23,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,18,24,I wonder if point and shoot cameras like this one could do better.
B002IPHIEG,19,0,I haven't transferred them to the computer, but I don't show my pictures on my computer.
B002IPHIEG,19,1,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,19,2,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.
B002IPHIEG,19,3,Since my other cameras have been Sony cameras, I have already had memory stick cards and readers, so to me, its not a big deal.
B002IPHIEG,19,4,Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.
B002IPHIEG,19,5,There are some quirks with this camera which I wanted to point out.GOOD- Photo Quality - Others cover this so I wont go into it, but basically the photos are very good.BAD- Sony USB Cable - This is proprietary SONY cable, so you have to carry it around with you if you want to download photos from the directly from the camera without removing the Memory Stick.
B002IPHIEG,19,6,Tell me what will you do when you want to move pictures from your camera to your computer on the fly, you will need the 10 meter long 10 plug Sony proprietary cable, how about taking the memory card out, oh, that's another proprietary memory stick duo, now how to charge it?
B002IPHIEG,19,7,Internal Memory.
B002IPHIEG,19,8,Incidentally, the newest duo "pro" cards are not compatible with some older readers even if they accommodate Sony cards.... go figure.4)
B002IPHIEG,19,9,(it's really ugly)No USB Charging.
B002IPHIEG,19,10,No HDMI.Expensive Memory Stick Duo.
B002IPHIEG,19,11,Interface to computer - dedicated cable I have to bring with me on vacation, or a usb sd card reader?
B002IPHIEG,19,12,No standard USB connection.
B002IPHIEG,19,13,If you have had other cameras that used SD, just think of making a $20 investment into a very reliable, fast card for your camera, and use the SD card in your Wii.The only two complaints I have for this camera are it's low light picture taking, and the format it uses when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,19,14,The SONY Cable also has Video/Audio connectors, so its a bulky cable.GOOD- Flash Setting - Unlike most Canon's I have had you can turn OFF the flash and it stays off after turning the camera off/on again.
B002IPHIEG,19,15,Its NOT one of those universal mini-USB/USB cables like you can use on Canons.
B002IPHIEG,19,16,I had high hopes for this Sony, and even went to the trouble of buying a 16GB Memory Stick Duo (hate their proprietary attitude) and an extra battery.
B002IPHIEG,19,17,battery life5.-touch
B002IPHIEG,19,18,A memory card is essential.So for the price and innovative technology, I really like this camera.
B002IPHIEG,19,19,The memory stick duo is what Sony uses; save to an external hard drive (you're going to need one either for the quantity of VGA photos or the memory required to store all your 10.2 megapixel treasures) and re-use to bring down your expenses if the price differential with other media is such a big factor.
B002IPHIEG,19,20,What can't a mini USB connection do?
B002IPHIEG,19,21,As a bonus, you can zoom while recording video.There's drawbacks, of course - Sony's continued, stubborn insistence on Memory Stick is irksome, but honestly, I don't move memory cards around much.
B002IPHIEG,19,22,You can upgrade your video card, but that is expensive and doesn't even work that well.
B002IPHIEG,19,23,proprietary cable: I guess this is the most annoying and irritating feature (or non feature) of the camera: Sony created this  weird looking dongle that is supposed to make life easier... you plug in the camera one end (again, proprietary port, not the standard mini usb port you would find in other cameras) and on the other end you have a standard video and audio jacks that you would plug into your TV  and a USB port for downloading pictures.
B002IPHIEG,19,24,Almost impossible to see.Proprietary USB/Composite video cable.
B002IPHIEG,20,0,Our last camera was a canon Powershot S2 IS.
B002IPHIEG,20,1,My last four digital cameras were all Canon, and i was happy with them.
B002IPHIEG,20,2,I was looking for better zoom while still maintaining the compact feel.
B002IPHIEG,20,3,I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon.
B002IPHIEG,20,4,The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90.
B002IPHIEG,20,5,My 5 year old Sony that finally broke was 7 mp and had much better still image quality.
B002IPHIEG,20,6,That being said, I think the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W290 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization (Dark Blue) would be just fine as well for my needs.If SONY would only stop with the SONY-only cables/cards this would be a much better camera!
B002IPHIEG,20,7,At this rate, my next compact might be a Canon or Panasonic.
B002IPHIEG,20,8,Okay, I really loved this camera and the picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,20,9,Our 5 year old camera shoots pictures that are much better and sharp.
B002IPHIEG,20,10,I purchased this camera because I wanted something to replace my Sony DSC-W300.
B002IPHIEG,20,11,Sony DSC-WX1 , A disappointing Camera.
B002IPHIEG,20,12,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).
B002IPHIEG,20,13,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,20,14,Still image and print quality are very important to me.
B002IPHIEG,20,15,This is replacing a Canon Powershot SD40 Elph that I liked very much other than the grainy blacks...So I thought I'd take a chance.
B002IPHIEG,20,16,Having owned 3 other Sony cameras and a Panasonic, I am somewhat picky.
B002IPHIEG,20,17,The video quality is exceptional for a camera of this size as well.
B002IPHIEG,20,18,If its zoom hadn't given out after many active years, I'd still shoot with it.
B002IPHIEG,20,19,I tried most of this camera's features, the result was disappointing.
B002IPHIEG,20,20,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,20,21,not much better than my seven year old Sony DSC-T30.
B002IPHIEG,20,22,So what is the point of buying 10MP camera when 5 mega pixel shots are better?
B002IPHIEG,20,23,I was looking at this last month when it was announced, and had decided I was going to go with the forthcoming 980 from Canon.
B002IPHIEG,20,24,I had a bought a Sony DSC-T3 a few years ago, wanting it so bad I imported one from Japan!
B002IPHIEG,21,0,The ONLY thing that I do not like is having to open the lens cover to take photos...but in the end this will protect the lens, because I dropped two of my Canons and messed up the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,1,Dust trapped inside lens, again!
B002IPHIEG,21,2,Many of my pictures have spots in them even though I do clean the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,3,It is so much better than the cameras that have the protruding lens that extends when open.
B002IPHIEG,21,4,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,5,There are many problems with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,21,6,The placement of the lens allows for others to touch or cover the lens with their fingers if they are taking a picture for you.
B002IPHIEG,21,7,Another great feature is the lens cover that acts as an on/off switch.
B002IPHIEG,21,8,The only problem I have had is with dust backscatter.
B002IPHIEG,21,9,Great even in low lighted area.The bad side: The rocker/toggle switch used to zooming in and out the lens is fragile!
B002IPHIEG,21,10,It just is TOO small.
B002IPHIEG,21,11,All my shots have turned out great!
B002IPHIEG,21,12,Very small (fits in a pocket) and very easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,21,13,Those can pose some problems when they open when they shouldn't (like in your pocket).The large touch screen makes everything easy.
B002IPHIEG,21,14,Its great if you want Non-Flash photos and are frequently turning the camera off/on in between shots.BAD- Battery Cover - The battery cover seems very flimsy and bows a bit if you hold the camera by it.
B002IPHIEG,21,15,I was advised that this is a technical problem caused by the flash being to close to the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,16,Only minor complaint is that the lens is located very near where you hold the camera (upper right-hand corner) so you have to be careful not to take a picture of your thumb or finger -- have done that a few times :).
B002IPHIEG,21,17,Works well in most lighting conditions with/without flash.
B002IPHIEG,21,18,After one year of use the rocker/toggle switch broke.
B002IPHIEG,21,19,It is an Awesome camera that takes beautiful clear photos!! Great Close up, Great far away!!
B002IPHIEG,21,20,I just have a small ding on one of the corners of the unit.
B002IPHIEG,21,21,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.
B002IPHIEG,21,22,Lens distortion is amazingly low, even at wide angle.+
B002IPHIEG,21,23,Quick and once you get use to the touch screen easy to use! Just took this pocket rocket to San Diego on a trip and it turned out some very good shots in low light and regular day time lighting.
B002IPHIEG,21,24,A dump in the river while canoeing, even using a plastic baggie to protect, still let in enough moisture that the Lumix camera was DOA when taken into a repair shop.
B002IPHIEG,22,0,Slightly better at low light but terrible with good light.
B002IPHIEG,22,1,It is a lot better with the picture quality especially in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,2,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,22,3,It's better in low light but still very grainy, however it's worse in good bright light.
B002IPHIEG,22,4,The low light pictures were much better then any other camera I have owned.
B002IPHIEG,22,5,Great indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,6,Better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,7,A grainy photo is better than no photo at all.
B002IPHIEG,22,8,Low light pictures are blurry and pixelated.
B002IPHIEG,22,9,Even the low light pictures don't seem to have a noise problem.
B002IPHIEG,22,10,Yes, you are slightly more likely to get a better photo in the dark if you really need to take photos in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,22,11,Still image and print quality are very important to me.
B002IPHIEG,22,12,Also, many of my pictures that I have taken have been blurry, pixelated, and of poor quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,13,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,22,14,Image quality was not what I expected.
B002IPHIEG,22,15,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,22,16,The video quality is exceptional for a camera of this size as well.
B002IPHIEG,22,17,Works well in most lighting conditions with/without flash.
B002IPHIEG,22,18,The low light picture taking is always a problem with cameras this size.
B002IPHIEG,22,19,The colors and lighting in the videos are excellent.
B002IPHIEG,22,20,It's pretty good, WITH THE RIGHT SETTINGS.
B002IPHIEG,22,21,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,22,22,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,22,23,The indoor shots seem pretty good (I'm still working on this.
B002IPHIEG,22,24,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,23,0,I returned it in the next day I received.
B002IPHIEG,23,1,don't buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,2,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).
B002IPHIEG,23,3,Do not buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,4,Having faith and loyalty in the Canon brand (this was our 4th Canon Camera purchase, two of which were Canon AE-1s given as gifts) I contacted Canon and was sorely disappointed.
B002IPHIEG,23,5,Please save your money and time - look elsewhere.
B002IPHIEG,23,6,I am going to see if Sony wiill repair or replace them but right now it feels that $329 x 2 was too much to spend for less than two years use.
B002IPHIEG,23,7,I bought one about 2 months ago and have been using it a lot.
B002IPHIEG,23,8,Sony DSC-WX1 , A disappointing Camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,9,You have to package the camera yourself and ship it to Texas for several weeks with no replacement in the interim.
B002IPHIEG,23,10,I bought two of the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX1/P camera within months of one another the first from Amazon on 12-17-2009.
B002IPHIEG,23,11,Had High Hopes - Defective Product.
B002IPHIEG,23,12,This was my main reason for purchase, and it failed my test.2)
B002IPHIEG,23,13,It got me thinking about all of the Sony products we have had in the past.
B002IPHIEG,23,14,Quick focusThe bad:1) The only reason I returned it was the biggest.
B002IPHIEG,23,15,I've owned Sony cameras for years and would never look at another brand of camera, until now.
B002IPHIEG,23,16,Not worth the price.
B002IPHIEG,23,17,I now need to buy a new camera for an upcoming trip, and I can assure you it will not be a Sony.Hope this helps,Damian
B002IPHIEG,23,18,I had a bought a Sony DSC-T3 a few years ago, wanting it so bad I imported one from Japan!
B002IPHIEG,23,19,I'll probably return mine for a Lumix TS1
B002IPHIEG,23,20,I bought this camera a little over a year ago as a Christmas present for my girlfriend.
B002IPHIEG,23,21,While waiting to get the camera, I would check Amazon every day to see if anyone who had actually used the camera had put up any reviews yet.
B002IPHIEG,23,22,Quality of video was not good enough to pay the extra money.
B002IPHIEG,23,23,Aren't they caring about quality anymore... hope this is an isolate case.
B002IPHIEG,23,24,I did all my research (reading product reviews from Amazon, CNET, BestBuy etc.) and decided to try out the WX1 and I'm glad I did.
B002IPHIEG,24,0,I looked all over to try to find which settings to change but I never found it.
B002IPHIEG,24,1,this is 2010 not 1985.4.  User interface - menu is difficult to navigate and full of gimmicky 'features' as opposed to useful things.
B002IPHIEG,24,2,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,24,3,The TX1 doesn't have a "movie mode" button like the t500/t900, you have to use the menu system to turn it on.
B002IPHIEG,24,4,How is that possible?! (for the answer, see the next line item)- No manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,24,5,First, it is all too easy while shooting to accidently change the settings and all too difficult to get back to what I want--after I realize what's happened.
B002IPHIEG,24,6,It is not always the case, though; my last shoot, I know I did not change the settings but they changed to the lowest setting nonetheless.If I could afford a more professional camera, I would get it, but as a freelance writer a point-and-shoot is it and it has to be easy to handle.
B002IPHIEG,24,7,When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked.
B002IPHIEG,24,8,I know that folks will say that I must have pressed the wrong button, and that might be so at times.
B002IPHIEG,24,9,I do a lot of shooting under pressure.
B002IPHIEG,24,10,Still, this camera seems to me to have a lot of functionality that makes it worth the time learning how to use it properly.
B002IPHIEG,24,11,Very small (fits in a pocket) and very easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,24,12,(minor) Menus are not intuitive or user-friendly.
B002IPHIEG,24,13,Third, when trying to get back to the settings I want in the middle of a photo opp, it can be confusing trying to find the right screen.Fourth (and worst), the image size seems to change without my actually choosing it.
B002IPHIEG,24,14,Also, I find it easy to hit the power button when the camera's in a crowded pocket.
B002IPHIEG,24,15,Wasn't looking for dslr quality, but something that looked  nice would be useful.
B002IPHIEG,24,16,I found the menus a bit confusing and not intuitive even though I am an iPhone junkie and very tech savvy.
B002IPHIEG,24,17,I'm not a techno wizard, but this camera is pretty easy to use (I do suggest reading the manual because the camera has lots of cool functions) and the photo quality is great.
B002IPHIEG,24,18,I'm somewhat puzzled after reading several of the poor reviews for this camera.
B002IPHIEG,24,19,Controls are laid out sensibly, and it's easy to switch from automated settings to finer image control.One of the coolest new features is Panorama mode, which makes ultra-wide photos quickly and easily.
B002IPHIEG,24,20,This doesn't do it.I was looking for a small simple camera to carry with me.
B002IPHIEG,24,21,As others have commented, you really do need to read the manual, experiment with the settings, and learn how to get the best results with it.But no one should be buying this camera because they want the best possible picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,24,22,Great features, simple and easy to use settings.
B002IPHIEG,24,23,No manual controls.The W300 had full manual controls, and I wonder why Sony couldn't have included them here and really made this a top of the line point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,24,24,Someone else said that they had no problem shooting at higher speeds in that setting.
B002IPHIEG,25,0,The only problem I have had is with dust backscatter.
B002IPHIEG,25,1,don't buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,2,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).
B002IPHIEG,25,3,With that, I will clear up problems previous owners have had.First, I'm sure all of you want to know how good the new Exmor R sensor is.
B002IPHIEG,25,4,I'm somewhat puzzled after reading several of the poor reviews for this camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,5,Good camera with an awful flaw in the design that affects some pictures.
B002IPHIEG,25,6,I shoot mostly SLRs D90 and D700 Nikon, so I am not going to compare thosecameras to this one.
B002IPHIEG,25,7,About all it can't do is pinch-zoom, and I'm guessing that's more of a patent issue than anything else.
B002IPHIEG,25,8,When I can afford it, I'll get a DSLR to replace the SLR's.All of this is to say that I have some experience with photography, although I would not in any way consider myself a "serious" photographer.
B002IPHIEG,25,9,Sony DSC-WX1 , A disappointing Camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,10,I now need to buy a new camera for an upcoming trip, and I can assure you it will not be a Sony.Hope this helps,Damian
B002IPHIEG,25,11,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,25,12,I returned it in the next day I received.
B002IPHIEG,25,13,I had a bought a Sony DSC-T3 a few years ago, wanting it so bad I imported one from Japan!
B002IPHIEG,25,14,I loved all of the features of this camera but the first thing that i care about is quality of photos which this camera has lack of it.
B002IPHIEG,25,15,I sent the camera to Sony covered by warranty and customer service (very kindly I must say) told me that the camera was performing under specifications and even if they replaced it with a new one it will have the same flaw, so my only options were to exchange it for a different model or live with it...I'm amazed that they are still selling this camera (that isn't exactly cheap) with this awful flaw, maybe most people won't notice it if they don't take too much close up pictures but be aware of this problem if you're considering getting this camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,16,Quality of video was not good enough to pay the extra money.
B002IPHIEG,25,17,I've always been a sony camera guy, but this camera has a really big issue that I couldn't believe that it was real when I start testing the camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,18,I would say, and this may be a mark against it for many people, that the WX1 is not a "point and shoot" camera unless one is familiar with its workings, but when I read the negative comments I wonder if some of the issues complained of could be addressed through a better understanding of the camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,19,Hi everyone and thanks for reading my reviewIf you are reading this chances are that you are in the market for a good point and shoot camera...In my opinion, you have to look no further.Most complaints about this camera basically tell you that the new image sensor that sony uses is not "that great" or that night images are good but day images are not...These complaints would ALL go away if they read the manual.
B002IPHIEG,25,20,I was shooting in what would normally be considered a dust free area (Church and restaurant)so it is a design flaw.
B002IPHIEG,25,21,I did some research and found that I was FAR from the only one experiencing this issue.
B002IPHIEG,25,22,VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE: Great Camera!
B002IPHIEG,25,23,When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked.
B002IPHIEG,25,24,Recently I upgraded from the Sony dsc w1 to the wx1 (5 years of technology development in between).
B00DMS0LCO,0,0,Very good quality pictures
B00DMS0LCO,0,1,But overall, it seemed like a nice lens and shoots nice pictures.BATTERY LIFEWithout WiFi the battery life is quite good.
B00DMS0LCO,0,2,I have been using this camera during a couple of days and i can say only good things about it.
B00DMS0LCO,0,3,Battery life is great with the wi-fi turned off.
B00DMS0LCO,0,4,wanted to let people know that I am getting about 950 photo's and about 25 minutes of video per battery charge.
B00DMS0LCO,0,5,The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good.
B00DMS0LCO,0,6,I've never considered myself a serious videographer, but this camera could change that.Battery Life: Battery life seems very good and I am still working off the same charge from when I pulled the camera out of the box about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,0,7,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,0,8,Battery life is almost twice than the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,0,9,I purchased two off-brand batteries as backups to the Canon battery, and I've never been left stranded yet and I use the WiFi a lot.SUMMARYOverall this is a great camera and I highly recommend it!
B00DMS0LCO,0,10,I may consider a battery grip for this camera and have owned a couple of Canon battery grips with previous Canons.
B00DMS0LCO,0,11,However, to me this has never been an issue since I ALWAYS carry a spare battery.
B00DMS0LCO,0,12,I could probably do an entire day of shooting with the WiFi off without changing batteries.
B00DMS0LCO,0,13,Once more I know that I have a very good camera.
B00DMS0LCO,0,14,No GPS -- otherwise great.
B00DMS0LCO,0,15,Great Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,0,16,Wi-Fi eats batteries fast, so carry spares.
B00DMS0LCO,0,17,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,0,18,I am not using Wi-Fi right now.3-9-2014went to the NUCLEAR COWBOYZ show and shot over 45 minutes of video and about 150 stills.
B00DMS0LCO,0,19,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,0,20,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,0,21,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,0,22,I bought this on pre-order, and it's been a fantastic little camera.
B00DMS0LCO,0,23,I put the dead battery that came with the camera on the charger and left it to charge thinking nothing of it.4
B00DMS0LCO,0,24,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,1,0,Oh, and same thing with the touch screen.
B00DMS0LCO,1,1,The camera also has a good grip and the detachable lcd screen is a nice to have feature
B00DMS0LCO,1,2,Nice camera.
B00DMS0LCO,1,3,Love the flip out rear touch screen LCD.
B00DMS0LCO,1,4,Touch flip screen.
B00DMS0LCO,1,5,I love this camera so much, takes amazing photos, touch screen, Wifi, I love it.
B00DMS0LCO,1,6,Oh, and by the way, the screen is touch controlled.
B00DMS0LCO,1,7,The 70D is so easy to use and change settings with, thanks to the capacitive touch screen which is just like the touch screen on a nice smartphone.
B00DMS0LCO,1,8,Very good camera.
B00DMS0LCO,1,9,I also like that in Live-View, I can simply touch the screen on the point I want the camera to focus on, and the camera focuses to that point and releases the shutter.-WiFi:
B00DMS0LCO,1,10,The touch screen is the best feature Canon added to this camera; simply swipe through photos, pinch to zoom... Setting changes are so quick and easy.
B00DMS0LCO,1,11,I find that getting used to the touch screen may take some time & again I worry a tad about the durability of a screen that can be rotated six ways from Sunday, but the controls are all in the right places & the menus on the touch screen make sense and are easy to get through.
B00DMS0LCO,1,12,That is why I took one star away.I found the touch LCD and touch control screen on top of the 70D quite useful and adapted to them quickly.
B00DMS0LCO,1,13,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,1,14,However, I've been surprised to find that the thing I like best about this camera is it's ease of use, particularly Canon's implementation of the LCD monitor touch screen.
B00DMS0LCO,1,15,Anyway, the fold-out display is a great feature, and it also folds face-in to protect the display when not in use.The ability to touch various points on the LCD display while in Live View or shooting video, and shift focus while shooting is - to me at least - worth the price of admission.
B00DMS0LCO,1,16,I did not think I would like the touch screen but it turns out I use it most of the time to adjust my settings.
B00DMS0LCO,1,17,This was the first thing I tried, and the screen auto-flips when it is rotated.
B00DMS0LCO,1,18,Responsiveness is just as good as on my iPod Touch.-
B00DMS0LCO,1,19,No LCD tilt or touch.
B00DMS0LCO,1,20,No LCD tilt or touch.
B00DMS0LCO,1,21,The still photos can't be touched.
B00DMS0LCO,1,22,The articulated touch screen makes live view, video and menu settings very convenient.
B00DMS0LCO,1,23,I love the touch screen.Cons:- Plastic body.-
B00DMS0LCO,1,24,The icing on the cake is the Touch Screen with multi-touch operation, as well as Touch AF! Excellent!
B00DMS0LCO,2,0,I upgraded from a Canon Rebel to the 70d.
B00DMS0LCO,2,1,Upgraded from a Canon Rebel XS.
B00DMS0LCO,2,2,I have several Canon Cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,2,3,I went the Canon DSLR route due to looking at astrophotography.
B00DMS0LCO,2,4,This review is coming from someone upgrading from a Canon Kiss X4 (T2i/550D).
B00DMS0LCO,2,5,The Canon EOS 70D borrows many features from the Canon lineup.
B00DMS0LCO,2,6,This was an upgrade for me.
B00DMS0LCO,2,7,Keep it in context and the 70D is the best all around camera Canon has ever made by far.
B00DMS0LCO,2,8,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,2,9,70D What a great camera!
B00DMS0LCO,2,10,I had a Canon Rebel T3 and was looking to upgrade my camera.
B00DMS0LCO,2,11,Continuous Focus Video Works Great even with non-STM lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,2,12,This is the best camera except for my Canon Mark5II
B00DMS0LCO,2,13,What an upgrade...
B00DMS0LCO,2,14,Upgraded from a Rebel T2i to 70D - Very pleased.
B00DMS0LCO,2,15,AF with video.
B00DMS0LCO,2,16,Liking the new features having moved up from a canon t3i.
B00DMS0LCO,2,17,They all work great on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,2,18,Best Canon I've Used So Far.
B00DMS0LCO,2,19,I love the new Canon EOS 70D!
B00DMS0LCO,2,20,Not Canon teleconverters, however.
B00DMS0LCO,2,21,There's nothing from Canon behind it.
B00DMS0LCO,2,22,Canon doesn't often make game-changing cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,2,23,Regardless of what Canon says, pretend it's a sieve if you're in more than a drizzle.
B00DMS0LCO,2,24,The autofocusing system works nicely and focuses much faster than my Rebel.
B00DMS0LCO,3,0,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,3,1,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,3,2,I wish I could have taken part in early reviews of this system so I could have been working with these awesome features.
B00DMS0LCO,3,3,The Wi-Fi feature is great for sending photo to your phone or tablet or email or sharing on social media sites but it needs to be disabled manually for movie shooting and USB connection which is very annoying.
B00DMS0LCO,3,4,This is what i want it's easy to connect to my smartphone.
B00DMS0LCO,3,5,Great Camera!
B00DMS0LCO,3,6,The canon customer service said it is not possible to capture image and show the live view at the same time.
B00DMS0LCO,3,7,This is a great feature because you don't have to buy a dedicated shutter release.Canon was super smart about how they implemented this wireless connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,3,8,Once you've connected your phone to the camera's hotspot you just launch the Canon app.
B00DMS0LCO,3,9,Excellent.
B00DMS0LCO,3,10,On general photos, the quality has been excellent.
B00DMS0LCO,3,11,The pictures were so concerning I called Canon tech support (which was excellent by the way).
B00DMS0LCO,3,12,Please note that this review is just my personal opinion and I might be wrong.
B00DMS0LCO,3,13,I have not tested the WiFi yet but will soon.
B00DMS0LCO,3,14,The quality and que materials is so good, meets the specifications of the website and sending fulfilled in time.
B00DMS0LCO,3,15,It has built in wifi that syncs to your phone, tablet and computer.
B00DMS0LCO,3,16,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,3,17,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,3,18,I had hated the lag time when taking photos with my old camera or cell phone camera, but that is not an issue at all with the 70D.
B00DMS0LCO,3,19,Also, having built-in Wifi on a camera is something I thought I would never use, but I was wrong.
B00DMS0LCO,3,20,I am in the process of getting the device replaced as it is still within the return time-frameThe Good:It has everything except a full framesensor.Video AF was excellent.
B00DMS0LCO,3,21,Still, this is easily corrected via an external microphone.This camera has even been a great choice for my wife.
B00DMS0LCO,3,22,It works extremely well and I'm so glad I have it!
B00DMS0LCO,3,23,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,3,24,I am satisfied with my purchase.
B00DMS0LCO,4,0,Auto focus is great, manual focus is great.
B00DMS0LCO,4,1,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,4,2,Hence in low light, in LV mode the camera will not focus at all!
B00DMS0LCO,4,3,In LV mode, when you are switching between still photo shooting modes using mode dial, LV switches off which is somewhat annoying.8.
B00DMS0LCO,4,4,Excellent Camera with Great Features.
B00DMS0LCO,4,5,Lastly, I think it would be really convenient, if in VF mode, when you are switching shooting modes using mode dial, the LV panel could automatically show the information about that shooting mode.
B00DMS0LCO,4,6,This means continuous shoot is not useable in LV mode!
B00DMS0LCO,4,7,I have had a DSLR previously, but always kept it in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,4,8,very good.
B00DMS0LCO,4,9,However, it's still very good.
B00DMS0LCO,4,10,a leap in continous AF (in good light).
B00DMS0LCO,4,11,Helpful, great illustrations.
B00DMS0LCO,4,12,The Goods.
B00DMS0LCO,4,13,The 19 cross-type AF points is more than what I need but there is no way to select the AF points in Basic modes (A+, No Flash, CA) when using VF.
B00DMS0LCO,4,14,The camera is quick to focus, acquires moving subjects and allows for great photo's.
B00DMS0LCO,4,15,Great Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,4,16,Also, I've had a lot more in focus shots, the focusing system is leaps and bounds what I was used to.
B00DMS0LCO,4,17,I only shoot in manual, I don't see an advantage with the other modes.
B00DMS0LCO,4,18,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,4,19,I needed a DSLR which can capture videos and take photos in low light.
B00DMS0LCO,4,20,Great exposure bracketing for HDR shooting.
B00DMS0LCO,4,21,I'm just an amature that likes shooting video and pictures.
B00DMS0LCO,4,22,This is an excellent camera and provides all the features I need such as HDR and High Speed shots.
B00DMS0LCO,4,23,Most of the stills were at ISO 6400-12800 and shot in sport mode for high speed.
B00DMS0LCO,4,24,The bride and groom were very pleased at how "easy" it was to walk around and shoot a bunch of photos without having to do a lot of re-shoots and lighting fixes.
B00DMS0LCO,5,0,Looks and feels great.
B00DMS0LCO,5,1,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,5,2,Extremely fast focusing speed.
B00DMS0LCO,5,3,the other feature that is very nice to me is the 7 frames per second, having both cameras that is sometimes the difference between getting and missing a good shot.
B00DMS0LCO,5,4,It has a fast focusing system and the 7fps is great for sports shooting.
B00DMS0LCO,5,5,Great and fast auto focus.
B00DMS0LCO,5,6,Great high speed shutter for kids' sports.
B00DMS0LCO,5,7,The camera has a good feel to it and although it is a bit heavier that previous camera I've owned it still feels good in my hands.
B00DMS0LCO,5,8,Extremely fast shutter action, quiet, 7+ snaps per second.
B00DMS0LCO,5,9,Very impress that every shot is sharp and in focus.
B00DMS0LCO,5,10,Great high speed shutter for my kids' sporting events.
B00DMS0LCO,5,11,I used 3200 ISO with a 60-80 shutter speed to get the exposure right and came away with some great baby shots.
B00DMS0LCO,5,12,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,5,13,The camera is quick to focus, acquires moving subjects and allows for great photo's.
B00DMS0LCO,5,14,I really liked it as there was no shutter lag and burst speeds help get the action.
B00DMS0LCO,5,15,The shutter speed and FPS work great so that I can freeze the birds midflight and get tack sharp photos too.
B00DMS0LCO,5,16,The video and shooting autofocus work great although I have had a few times where it would not autofocus on something usually in really low light conditions.
B00DMS0LCO,5,17,They all work great on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,5,18,Most of the stills were at ISO 6400-12800 and shot in sport mode for high speed.
B00DMS0LCO,5,19,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,5,20,I love the new focus system, it gives me nice sharp pic's right where I want them.
B00DMS0LCO,5,21,Moving up from my old T1i was the best move for me.
B00DMS0LCO,5,22,Excellent Camera with Great Features.
B00DMS0LCO,5,23,The camera is comfortable to hold, and is lite but doesn't feel cheap.
B00DMS0LCO,5,24,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,6,0,I also purchased the PNY 62GB SXD memory card, I would rather have more than less.
B00DMS0LCO,6,1,I have also used the WiFi to transfer photos to my computer, but its pretty slow, so I usually just use the USB cable instead.-Drive
B00DMS0LCO,6,2,In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card.
B00DMS0LCO,6,3,one card slot.
B00DMS0LCO,6,4,Dual SD cards.
B00DMS0LCO,6,5,Highly recommended.
B00DMS0LCO,6,6,A 32GB SD card is good for about 45 minutes with ALL-I compression and two hours with IPB.
B00DMS0LCO,6,7,Buy this camera!!
B00DMS0LCO,6,8,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,6,9,She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one.
B00DMS0LCO,6,10,Modes:  The camera has a lot of great drive modes, including a burst-mode of 7 per second.
B00DMS0LCO,6,11,It shoots HD videos, uses the more compact SD memory cards, has in camera HDR and lots of other new features not found on my 40D or earlier successors.
B00DMS0LCO,6,12,In one-shot mode, this difference is invisible; very fast cards would only make sense if you were time-limited on card-to-computer transfers with a USB 3.0, SATA, or Firewire card reader.IN SUM:This is the most significant DSLR Canon has introduced since the 7D.
B00DMS0LCO,6,13,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,6,14,Shots can be taken in RAW and/or JPEG, saved to the memory card for post processing in your favorite software.
B00DMS0LCO,6,15,So when I read about the 70D I decided to go for it with the 18-135 lens and a super fast 80mb/s transfer rate memory card, are real must for high end video.
B00DMS0LCO,6,16,It's nice to be able to shoot a photo and transfer it directly to my iPhone to edit and share!
B00DMS0LCO,6,17,Please note RAW takes up more memory than JPG.
B00DMS0LCO,6,18,All photos with and without FEL were properly exposed and looked great.I use bounce flash indoors a lot for our one year old granddaughter.
B00DMS0LCO,6,19,Same results with bouncing the flash off the ceiling.
B00DMS0LCO,6,20,I highly recommend this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,6,21,(It also supports EyeFi cards, presumably because Canon already had the drivers in the OS build and didn't see a need to take them out.)
B00DMS0LCO,6,22,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,6,23,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,6,24,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,7,0,Best Canon at this price point yet!
B00DMS0LCO,7,1,great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,7,2,But, I do like the size and feel of this Canon.
B00DMS0LCO,7,3,One like this and another small P&S; I can carry in my pocket.
B00DMS0LCO,7,4,very good.
B00DMS0LCO,7,5,Easy to use, with good image quality and lots of options.
B00DMS0LCO,7,6,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,7,7,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,8,I love it !!!
B00DMS0LCO,7,9,I love this  camera !!!
B00DMS0LCO,7,10,But, this is a nice, solid lens at a good cost.Video: The primary selling point on this is the focus when using video.
B00DMS0LCO,7,11,This is the camera for you if you have been holding off upgrading to a higher line...Canon has taken some of the best features of their camera lines, form the 1D to the Rebel line and put it together in a nice package.
B00DMS0LCO,7,12,But it appears as though Canon got everything right in this one.
B00DMS0LCO,7,13,It's the best I have used yet.
B00DMS0LCO,7,14,Best AF available at this time in a SLR.
B00DMS0LCO,7,15,the other feature that is very nice to me is the 7 frames per second, having both cameras that is sometimes the difference between getting and missing a good shot.
B00DMS0LCO,7,16,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,17,But, a nice shotgun mike would probably make a nice addition for the serious videographer.
B00DMS0LCO,7,18,I am using this camera with tameron 17-50 vc and a cannon 70-300 IS L and love it.
B00DMS0LCO,7,19,If I had $700 to buy a movie DSLR that would fit into a small bag, I'd save another $500 and buy a bigger bag rather than take the SL1 over the 70D.vs.
B00DMS0LCO,7,20,I took a break and tried out the Nikon cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,7,21,Strong points include a smooth zoom action, no zoom creep, and nearly inaudible focus and stabilization.
B00DMS0LCO,7,22,I love the fact that its not as heavey and bulky.
B00DMS0LCO,7,23,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,7,24,This is the third Canon DSLR that I have used (20d way back when, 7d more recently, now this), and I think it may well be the best in just about every respect.
B00DMS0LCO,8,0,I have the 18-135 and it is a great lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,1,I have a 50mm lens and will be getting better lenses....
B00DMS0LCO,8,2,The included 18mm-55mm kit lens is, well, the included kit lens; no frills but sufficient to get you started.
B00DMS0LCO,8,3,I'm not going to restate all the excellent attributes of the camera and lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,4,Good kit lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,5,This is a great camera and the packaged kit lens is quite good if you get the 18-135mm.
B00DMS0LCO,8,6,Great camera if APS-C-sized sensor is what you're looking for.
B00DMS0LCO,8,7,I usually shoot with a 24-105mm lens, so this lens feels a little cheaper than the L quality I'm accustomed to.
B00DMS0LCO,8,8,The 18-35 mm kit lens gives a lot of range, and I tested the camera out with my other lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,8,9,I wanted the "body only" and quickly found the price of the body only was still the same.
B00DMS0LCO,8,10,If you do not HAVE to have a full frame DSLR, this is the best Canon APS-C DSLR ever.
B00DMS0LCO,8,11,I just purchased this beauty with the 18-55 STM lens and the 55-250 IS lens kit.
B00DMS0LCO,8,12,The lens is relatively sharp, especially for a kit lens.Overall, if you think you might ever want to shoot video then I'd definitely take this over Nikon, Sony, or any other manufacturer's current offerings in the price range.
B00DMS0LCO,8,13,I currently own a Canon Xti + Tamron 17mm-50mm f/2.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,14,Over priced not a full frame sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,8,15,Pair this camera with an STM lens and you've got camcorder like video on a DSLR.The 18-135mm kit lens gives you a great range as a walk around lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,16,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.
B00DMS0LCO,8,17,This one did not go on if the lens cap was on, nor could you put the lens cap on if the hood was attached.
B00DMS0LCO,8,18,IS USM zoom - my heaviest lens at the moment - the camera feels surprisingly balanced.The crop sensor obviously changes the effect of the lenses, but having a full sensor and a crop sensor both, it's like having 2 sets of lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,8,19,I'm using the kit lens (ef-s 18-135 stm).
B00DMS0LCO,8,20,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,8,21,Even better, if makes a great second body if you shoot full frame but want to have more options for your existing lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,8,22,I have owned Canons for about the past 20 years and have to say this is the best I have owned yet for the price point.The stock lens: Excellent lens for a kit lens and truly responsive in terms of focus vs. stabilization and lighting.
B00DMS0LCO,8,23,I have had this camera for a little over a month now and am only working with the kit lens and body right out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,8,24,I use only Sigma lenses on it right now... the 30mm "A", the 18-200 "C", and the 150-500.
B00DMS0LCO,9,0,I am very impressed with the image quality in low or ambient light, where the ISO is under 1000.
B00DMS0LCO,9,1,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,9,2,The image quality is excellent, with good, low ISO noise up to ISO 3200, and, with good noise-reduction software, up to 12,800.Although I bought it for ISO 25,600, where the image quality is adequate with noise reduction, I find its video features very good.
B00DMS0LCO,9,3,Amazing picture quality!
B00DMS0LCO,9,4,Easy to use, with good image quality and lots of options.
B00DMS0LCO,9,5,The low light performance is fantastic with the noise levels almost unnoticeable even at ISO 6400.
B00DMS0LCO,9,6,Great image quality & amazing autofocus!
B00DMS0LCO,9,7,Images are softer than expected.
B00DMS0LCO,9,8,This camera makes taking pictures or video in low light easy, no visible noise at even very high ISO.
B00DMS0LCO,9,9,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,9,10,Too good for me.
B00DMS0LCO,9,11,I needed a DSLR which can capture videos and take photos in low light.
B00DMS0LCO,9,12,I do wish at times I could soften the image because the detail can be too telling.
B00DMS0LCO,9,13,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,9,14,Canon certainly has a high quality lineup, and has gone the distance in putting forth a lower priced high quality camera for the masses.
B00DMS0LCO,9,15,Excellent Quality Build and Impressive Photos.
B00DMS0LCO,9,16,The range of the ISO and the shutter speed is great and the difference it makes in the picture quality is amazing!
B00DMS0LCO,9,17,I am coming from a T3I (which I was more than happy with the image quality but needed more features).
B00DMS0LCO,9,18,The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good.
B00DMS0LCO,9,19,Video is about average when indoors or in low light, but that's to be expected.
B00DMS0LCO,9,20,Colors are preserved better at high ISOs.
B00DMS0LCO,9,21,The video and shooting autofocus work great although I have had a few times where it would not autofocus on something usually in really low light conditions.
B00DMS0LCO,9,22,Coming from a T2i the image quality is excellent (specially in low light).
B00DMS0LCO,9,23,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,9,24,They are higher priced and do not have the quality of this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,0,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,1,Great deal on a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,2,However, it's still very good.
B00DMS0LCO,10,3,Buy this camera!!
B00DMS0LCO,10,4,Over priced.
B00DMS0LCO,10,5,I bought this camera for videography and couldn't be more happy with it.
B00DMS0LCO,10,6,This is a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,7,Love This Camera!
B00DMS0LCO,10,8,After reading everything that was out there about this camera, I decided to buy one.
B00DMS0LCO,10,9,Also, the amazon price was $1200 when I bought it - and I am surprised that the price has dropped at all.
B00DMS0LCO,10,10,Based on all the great reviews, it may only be only some batches - I do not know.
B00DMS0LCO,10,11,Great product.
B00DMS0LCO,10,12,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,10,13,That is the reason I bought this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,14,Canon was a no-brainer - I wouldn't buy anything else.
B00DMS0LCO,10,15,Better than expected.
B00DMS0LCO,10,16,Great DSLR !
B00DMS0LCO,10,17,I am satisfied with my purchase.
B00DMS0LCO,10,18,When researching my purchase, I initially thought I would purchase the Canon T5i, but after reading various reviews, I decided to go for the 70D.
B00DMS0LCO,10,19,I highly recommend the product.
B00DMS0LCO,10,20,I love it !!!
B00DMS0LCO,10,21,I love this  camera !!!
B00DMS0LCO,10,22,Read the professional reviews.
B00DMS0LCO,10,23,I read other reviews and people try to compare this to other cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,10,24,Highly recommended.
B00DMS0LCO,11,0,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,11,1,Good Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,2,Too good for me.
B00DMS0LCO,11,3,The operations are really easy, and I really like this camera
B00DMS0LCO,11,4,Great Camera!
B00DMS0LCO,11,5,great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,6,Helpful, great illustrations.
B00DMS0LCO,11,7,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,11,8,Great Camera for Pro and Novice alike!
B00DMS0LCO,11,9,Excellent DSLR for beginner and intermediate photographers alike.
B00DMS0LCO,11,10,I'm a professional photographer and we have ventured into the photo booth business.
B00DMS0LCO,11,11,You do have to know some of the basics of how DSLR cameras work.
B00DMS0LCO,11,12,I hope I can learn to use 20% of the features on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,13,While I have a *lot* of learning to do, I already love the camera and look forward to using it more and more as time goes on.
B00DMS0LCO,11,14,I def recommend this camera to any amateur photographer like myself.
B00DMS0LCO,11,15,Easy to use, with good image quality and lots of options.
B00DMS0LCO,11,16,I am not a professional photographer, but I was looking for good, high quality photos and I knew the 70D would give me all that I was looking for in a camera for many years to come.
B00DMS0LCO,11,17,While it may take a while for a beginning amateur photographer to learn how to use all the numerous features, it is well worth the learning experience.
B00DMS0LCO,11,18,I'm a beginner to photography, and this camera is extremely user friendly.
B00DMS0LCO,11,19,I have a lot more to learn about using the 70D and its many features and capabilities, but thus far I am very impressed and highly recommend this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,20,There are a lot of auto or semi-auto modes good for the beginner, as well as full manual controls (which is really why you would want to buy a camera like this anyway).
B00DMS0LCO,11,21,Great product.
B00DMS0LCO,11,22,Image quality and high ISO performance are a delight, and the improvements in how the cameras Menu and its many features can be accessed make it easy, almost intuitive, to use most of the camera's many features.
B00DMS0LCO,11,23,If you are new to DSLR I strongly recommend you spend some time understanding what these 3 terms mean and how they influence the quality of the picture taken.
B00DMS0LCO,11,24,I love this camera so much, takes amazing photos, touch screen, Wifi, I love it.
B00DMS0LCO,12,0,Great camera!
B00DMS0LCO,12,1,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,12,2,The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good.
B00DMS0LCO,12,3,However, it's still very good.
B00DMS0LCO,12,4,I'm just an amature that likes shooting video and pictures.
B00DMS0LCO,12,5,Great Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,6,I haven't edited any of the video, so I do no know if the lens sounds show up on the video.
B00DMS0LCO,12,7,Great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,8,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,12,9,Videos are excellent.
B00DMS0LCO,12,10,Very good quality pictures
B00DMS0LCO,12,11,I love the autofocus on video.
B00DMS0LCO,12,12,Once more I know that I have a very good camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,13,very good.
B00DMS0LCO,12,14,Great deal on a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,15,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,12,16,noise in video.
B00DMS0LCO,12,17,I was amazed and the people who watched my video's in HD were surprised.
B00DMS0LCO,12,18,The 70Ds video shooting is SO incredibly good that I am now looking for opportunities to record things!
B00DMS0LCO,12,19,Most reviews made it sound like a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,20,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,12,21,Autofocus and a good lens and you're be making amazing movies in no time
B00DMS0LCO,12,22,I really like the features of this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,23,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,12,24,And it seems a very good value for the price.
B00DMS0LCO,13,0,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,13,1,When I get the battery, there is no power in it.
B00DMS0LCO,13,2,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,13,3,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,13,4,This camera has won me over and it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,13,5,break battery.
B00DMS0LCO,13,6,It would still work but it was not tactile.
B00DMS0LCO,13,7,I put the dead battery that came with the camera on the charger and left it to charge thinking nothing of it.4
B00DMS0LCO,13,8,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,13,9,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,13,10,I had second thoughts but turns out the Canon charger worked and battery had no issues whatsoever.
B00DMS0LCO,13,11,the battery charger charge TWO batteries fast at the same time?I'd consider a full frame version, if the cons are fix.for
B00DMS0LCO,13,12,I've never considered myself a serious videographer, but this camera could change that.Battery Life: Battery life seems very good and I am still working off the same charge from when I pulled the camera out of the box about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,13,13,I have never heard of this.why is there a communication problem between a new battery and the battery charger?...following the directions I separated the battery from the charger and put it back on....still blinking rapidly.....repeated this action again and finally the battery started to charge.
B00DMS0LCO,13,14,One thing that always drove me crazy was that the battery meter.
B00DMS0LCO,13,15,its not charging ?
B00DMS0LCO,13,16,I think this product was opened before I get it.
B00DMS0LCO,13,17,Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.
B00DMS0LCO,13,18,On my previous cameras the battery meter would show full, then be at low, skipping the midrange all together.
B00DMS0LCO,13,19,NOT COOL.I have 2 after market batteries that would no charge on this charger .Bummer I then ordered an aftermarket charger for 5 $ no big deal.
B00DMS0LCO,13,20,keep in mind that this battery charger is the same battery charger that comes with the 5dmark ii 7D and a few other models.
B00DMS0LCO,13,21,wanted to let people know that I am getting about 950 photo's and about 25 minutes of video per battery charge.
B00DMS0LCO,13,22,I took it out of the box and the Live View mode wasn't working reliably: I had to reset the camera twice by pulling the battery out in the first few hours of use.
B00DMS0LCO,13,23,But overall, it seemed like a nice lens and shoots nice pictures.BATTERY LIFEWithout WiFi the battery life is quite good.
B00DMS0LCO,13,24,I should be able to charge after market batteries on this charger.sample
B00DMS0LCO,14,0,A big plus is that you can touch the LCD to type in passwords, etc.
B00DMS0LCO,14,1,I should note that I used the viewfinder primarily rather than the LCD screen for the pics.I found it very frustrating that the camera does not have a dedicated button for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,14,2,I did not think I would like the touch screen but it turns out I use it most of the time to adjust my settings.
B00DMS0LCO,14,3,shutter would click when the live view button was pressed, but the LCD screen would stay blank.
B00DMS0LCO,14,4,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,14,5,Love the flip out rear touch screen LCD.
B00DMS0LCO,14,6,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,14,7,This camera has won me over and it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,14,8,The articulated touch screen makes live view, video and menu settings very convenient.
B00DMS0LCO,14,9,The camera also has a good grip and the detachable lcd screen is a nice to have feature
B00DMS0LCO,14,10,The transmissive LCD display--transparent LCD over the focusing screen--can display icons, AF patterns, metering patterns, grid and plain matte screens and an electronic level.FLASH: The popup flash is great for fill and snapshots, and functions as a wireless E-TTL master.
B00DMS0LCO,14,11,Some photos, like one reviewer said, are indeed soft, and I notice it on the black rectangles/squares when I thought it was in focus in the viewfinder, and the photo simply is not.
B00DMS0LCO,14,12,when I bought this camera, I was scared to buy something I thought I was maybe overspending on a product I would not need.
B00DMS0LCO,14,13,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,14,14,I had to switch back and forth and was frustrated as I prefer to use the viewfinder but HAVE to use live view for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,14,15,If you read all the hype, when you get it you will be a little disappointed it doesn't have a scratch your butt button isn't on it.
B00DMS0LCO,14,16,Instead, you have to flip the switch and use the live view mode.
B00DMS0LCO,14,17,The T4i sensor had a couple of phase-detect pixels in the middle to make things less bad.
B00DMS0LCO,14,18,Oh, and same thing with the touch screen.
B00DMS0LCO,14,19,That is why I took one star away.I found the touch LCD and touch control screen on top of the 70D quite useful and adapted to them quickly.
B00DMS0LCO,14,20,There are lots of buttons and dials to press and turn plus the LCD touch screen options, so you have a lot of ground to cover in just knowing what and when to press what.
B00DMS0LCO,14,21,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,14,22,Simply compose a shot, touch the specific point on the Live View screen and the 70d can be set up to quickly focus on that spot and shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,14,23,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,14,24,That can be a big deal when you are doing the family portraits, for example.
B00DMS0LCO,15,0,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,15,1,Focus Issue using the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,15,2,Auto Focus Problems on 3 Canon 70d's.
B00DMS0LCO,15,3,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,15,4,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,15,5,The 19 point autofocus system, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder, consistently miss-focus the pictures, with my Canon 300mm F4 IS L lens.
B00DMS0LCO,15,6,I never had this problem, or any other issue, with my T3i.
B00DMS0LCO,15,7,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,15,8,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,15,9,Or better yet....fix it!Update 3/30/14I am sending the camera in for repairsThe lenses I use on this camera are the:- Sigma 1.8 18-35mm- Canon 1.8 85mm- Canon 3.5-5.6
B00DMS0LCO,15,10,All 3 that I tried had the same Auto Focus problems that could not be corrected by the AF Micro Adjustment.
B00DMS0LCO,15,11,Focussing with live view is no problem but focussing correctly when using fast lenses (Sigma f1.8) through the viewfinder results in many missed shots.
B00DMS0LCO,15,12,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,15,13,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,15,14,The subject was out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,15,Instead, you have to flip the switch and use the live view mode.
B00DMS0LCO,15,16,I have been very happy with my 60Ds, but wanted to get the additional focus points.
B00DMS0LCO,15,17,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,18,Autofocus confirmation beep.
B00DMS0LCO,15,19,The issue is reported to be with the view-finder not focusing as clearly as possible compared to live view.
B00DMS0LCO,15,20,Firmware updates since may have negated that issue; I don't know.
B00DMS0LCO,15,21,Thanks to the dense AF grid, the 70D is much less likely to miss during full-grid shooting for lack of having a point on contrast.While it's definitely an upgrade over the 60D, there are few caveats to this system relative to the 7D:First, it has only three of the 7D's five AF modes: Full Auto (19 point), Zone AF (5 zones), and Single-Point (1 point).
B00DMS0LCO,15,22,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.
B00DMS0LCO,15,23,Hence in low light, in LV mode the camera will not focus at all!
B00DMS0LCO,15,24,Review of Canon 70D; some shortcomings.
B00DMS0LCO,16,0,Said i can send my brand new camera for repair.
B00DMS0LCO,16,1,I gave it a 1 star because of the customer service I received from canon not for the camera itself because i never got see how the camera performs.
B00DMS0LCO,16,2,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,3,Poor customer service is beyond doubt.
B00DMS0LCO,16,4,When i called canon the guy treated me as if I was stupid and was telling me there is no way that there can be a err 30 code because thats a lens error and usually happens after a lot of use.
B00DMS0LCO,16,5,After discussion, Amazon agreed to send a replacement but this did not arrive in time for my flight and was cancelled.I wrote, I called, I suggested that the replacement be delivered directly.
B00DMS0LCO,16,6,I'm kind of sick of putting up with these issues this long, but hey, "finally accomplished" is better than never.
B00DMS0LCO,16,7,The canon customer service said it is not possible to capture image and show the live view at the same time.
B00DMS0LCO,16,8,As a result, I've paid full-price for an 'open-box' (being charitable) product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,9,I'm just an amature that likes shooting video and pictures.
B00DMS0LCO,16,10,Two Defective Units Before Heading to Best Buy.
B00DMS0LCO,16,11,I bought two and both were defective out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,16,12,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,16,13,The pictures were so concerning I called Canon tech support (which was excellent by the way).
B00DMS0LCO,16,14,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,16,15,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,16,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,16,17,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,16,18,This works well, and the plethora of upgraded features from the previous models is, well "what I expected from these things years ago".
B00DMS0LCO,16,19,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,16,20,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,16,21,In my case Tamron service was aware of the issue and under warranty upgraded my lenses firmware and now everything works perfectly.
B00DMS0LCO,16,22,Canon will probably respond with an update to resolve the issue as they have in the past.
B00DMS0LCO,16,23,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,16,24,Finally.STILLS:Image quality is very good.
B00DMS0LCO,17,0,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,1,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,17,2,You can use manual focus if you need more control.
B00DMS0LCO,17,3,With my 60D, I had to focus manually, or use autofocus in still-picture mode before switching to video.
B00DMS0LCO,17,4,The subject was out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,17,5,All 3 that I tried had the same Auto Focus problems that could not be corrected by the AF Micro Adjustment.
B00DMS0LCO,17,6,A new button near the shutter changes AF modes.
B00DMS0LCO,17,7,Uses flash for low-light focus which will blind your subject.-
B00DMS0LCO,17,8,date was set on the first camera.
B00DMS0LCO,17,9,This mode allows selection of the exposure range to as much as +- 3 EV.
B00DMS0LCO,17,10,In LV mode, when you are switching between still photo shooting modes using mode dial, LV switches off which is somewhat annoying.8.
B00DMS0LCO,17,11,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,17,12,Lastly, I think it would be really convenient, if in VF mode, when you are switching shooting modes using mode dial, the LV panel could automatically show the information about that shooting mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,13,first camera was set up to shoot RAW.
B00DMS0LCO,17,14,Auto White Balance is Almost Perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,17,15,It also allows for doing this once or for every shot until the setting is disabled.
B00DMS0LCO,17,16,all their auto white balance was horrible.
B00DMS0LCO,17,17,Under the camera 3 tab, turn the dial to set the exposure range.
B00DMS0LCO,17,18,Now it's in focus.
B00DMS0LCO,17,19,There's no focus-racking when focus stops.
B00DMS0LCO,17,20,In the Custom Function Settings C.Fn 1-5, the number of shots taken with AEB can be changed from the usual 3 shots to 5 or 7. When set at 5, you can vary the exposure all the way to +-6 EV.
B00DMS0LCO,17,21,It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots.
B00DMS0LCO,17,22,Once you have played enough with the A+ (Fully Automatic Shooting) mode, I recommend going to the SCENE (Special scene) mode and work through those settings  (Page 81 on the PDF instruction manual).
B00DMS0LCO,17,23,(3) The camera also does Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB).
B00DMS0LCO,17,24,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,18,0,(Yes that is a must as you tend to press buttons and you can get unexpected results).
B00DMS0LCO,18,1,The live feed doesn't come back until a few seconds after you've released the shutter button.
B00DMS0LCO,18,2,It just shows how many "clicks" are on your shutter, in your camera.
B00DMS0LCO,18,3,Shutter speed, how long th shutter remains open 1/x is also set automatically, as well as the ISO setting.)
B00DMS0LCO,18,4,A new button near the shutter changes AF modes.
B00DMS0LCO,18,5,The main difference is being able to shoot movies now... flip one switch and press the record button!
B00DMS0LCO,18,6,I love the ability to switch quickly between the 3 different AF options by hitting the small button next to the shutter release button.
B00DMS0LCO,18,7,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,18,8,I also like that in Live-View, I can simply touch the screen on the point I want the camera to focus on, and the camera focuses to that point and releases the shutter.-WiFi:
B00DMS0LCO,18,9,In LV mode, when you are switching between still photo shooting modes using mode dial, LV switches off which is somewhat annoying.8.
B00DMS0LCO,18,10,I am still trying to figure out how to hold the camera so that I can tap on the back viewing screen where I want the focus.
B00DMS0LCO,18,11,Most of the stills were at ISO 6400-12800 and shot in sport mode for high speed.
B00DMS0LCO,18,12,It also works perfectly while shooting videos where the focus changes during the shot.
B00DMS0LCO,18,13,I used 3200 ISO with a 60-80 shutter speed to get the exposure right and came away with some great baby shots.
B00DMS0LCO,18,14,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,18,15,While capturing video if you want to take a still photo, there is quite a few frame drops (about 1 sec as mentioned in the manual) even when using SD card with 95mb/s speed.
B00DMS0LCO,18,16,As a result, I used One Shot with single-point selection for most subjects.
B00DMS0LCO,18,17,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,18,18,When the camera doesn't select the right objects, I usually switch to single-point selection, and then use the toggle on the back of the camera to move to the correct point.
B00DMS0LCO,18,19,Extremely fast shutter action, quiet, 7+ snaps per second.
B00DMS0LCO,18,20,Different lenses change focus at different speeds.
B00DMS0LCO,18,21,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,18,22,Great high speed shutter for kids' sports.
B00DMS0LCO,18,23,Great high speed shutter for my kids' sporting events.
B00DMS0LCO,18,24,If you want to take video pictures, this is the only SLR available at this time, where your subject will remain in focus as they move.
B00DMS0LCO,19,0,When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't.
B00DMS0LCO,19,1,Amazon sold this 70d to me as new, it came with with a memory card with other peoples pictures on it.Obviously not new.
B00DMS0LCO,19,2,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,19,3,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,19,4,Going from Nikon to Canon is like going from a Microsoft PC to an Apple PC.
B00DMS0LCO,19,5,I have also used the WiFi to transfer photos to my computer, but its pretty slow, so I usually just use the USB cable instead.-Drive
B00DMS0LCO,19,6,But overall, it seemed like a nice lens and shoots nice pictures.BATTERY LIFEWithout WiFi the battery life is quite good.
B00DMS0LCO,19,7,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,19,8,Arrived quickly as promised, but would not recognize or format mem card.
B00DMS0LCO,19,9,Most of my work is done with a tripod and with a cable release.
B00DMS0LCO,19,10,I also purchased the PNY 62GB SXD memory card, I would rather have more than less.
B00DMS0LCO,19,11,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,19,12,However, if you're downloading pictures to your device, a real internet connection will be faster than using the camera as an access point.
B00DMS0LCO,19,13,It just works.
B00DMS0LCO,19,14,operating manual before you buy, IMHO.)
B00DMS0LCO,19,15,She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one.
B00DMS0LCO,19,16,With WiFi on (especially when the camera is acting as the access point), the battery goes pretty quickly.
B00DMS0LCO,19,17,Unless they come up with a fix fairly quickly, I'm not sure I'd ever buy another Canon camera after this.
B00DMS0LCO,19,18,Same results with bouncing the flash off the ceiling.
B00DMS0LCO,19,19,I purchased two off-brand batteries as backups to the Canon battery, and I've never been left stranded yet and I use the WiFi a lot.SUMMARYOverall this is a great camera and I highly recommend it!
B00DMS0LCO,19,20,Audio plug is worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,19,21,I used a SanDisk Extreme Pro 64GB SDXC card.
B00DMS0LCO,19,22,wanted to let people know that I am getting about 950 photo's and about 25 minutes of video per battery charge.
B00DMS0LCO,19,23,Great buy highly recommend you buy itexpensive but its well worth your money!only bad thing i would say is not being able to use the wifi feature with videos
B00DMS0LCO,19,24,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,20,0,I've always been a Canon loyalist.
B00DMS0LCO,20,1,I also own a Canon PowerShot s95.
B00DMS0LCO,20,2,They were polite and blamed them selves not the canon.
B00DMS0LCO,20,3,This works well, and the plethora of upgraded features from the previous models is, well "what I expected from these things years ago".
B00DMS0LCO,20,4,I have cheaper canons that do a better job.
B00DMS0LCO,20,5,I should've bought a replacement for the Canon PowerShot s95.So I sent the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 back and purchased the Sony RX100 II.
B00DMS0LCO,20,6,Better than expected.
B00DMS0LCO,20,7,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,20,8,I had a Canon Rebel T3 and was looking to upgrade my camera.
B00DMS0LCO,20,9,Also the canon is sticking to the 30p.
B00DMS0LCO,20,10,Why I returned 70D+EF 24mm f/1.4 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,20,11,I added a 18-270 Tamron lens to it, which is lighter than some others with this range.
B00DMS0LCO,20,12,No comparison to other offerings from Olympus, Panasonic or Sony.
B00DMS0LCO,20,13,Way to go Canon!
B00DMS0LCO,20,14,I had an earlier EOS model that I'd had for several years and was expecting this one to feel about the same.
B00DMS0LCO,20,15,Something like a Canon Rebel T5i + Canon EF 28 mm f/1.8 USM may be just what you need.
B00DMS0LCO,20,16,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,20,17,Previously I had film SLR, several advanced digital cameras and camcorders.
B00DMS0LCO,20,18,I currently own a Canon Xti + Tamron 17mm-50mm f/2.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,20,19,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,20,20,I am definitely happy with this purchase.
B00DMS0LCO,20,21,Easy to use, with good image quality and lots of options.
B00DMS0LCO,20,22,I had Canon 20d, 30d & 40d and Pro 1, G6, G9 and G11, Sx50 HS, Pentax ist, Panasonic FZ200, and i.m.h.o.
B00DMS0LCO,20,23,The Canon EOS 70D borrows many features from the Canon lineup.
B00DMS0LCO,20,24,I purchased this camera as an upgrade from the Canon EOS Rebel XTi that I've had for the past several years.
B00DMS0LCO,21,0,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,21,1,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,21,2,I also bought a camera bag to hold all the stuff, lens filters to protect the lenses, and a 50mm 1.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,21,3,The included 18mm-55mm kit lens is, well, the included kit lens; no frills but sufficient to get you started.
B00DMS0LCO,21,4,The replacement started charging from 0-49%.-The rear lens cap on the kit lens was marred noticeably.-The
B00DMS0LCO,21,5,This one did not go on if the lens cap was on, nor could you put the lens cap on if the hood was attached.
B00DMS0LCO,21,6,I just purchased this beauty with the 18-55 STM lens and the 55-250 IS lens kit.
B00DMS0LCO,21,7,I have had this camera for a little over a month now and am only working with the kit lens and body right out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,21,8,Body is not too big and not too small, just right!
B00DMS0LCO,21,9,I realized I might get better results with a better (prime?) lens but I also realized that the camera was just too big and heavy and that I was probably going to leave it home most of the time.
B00DMS0LCO,21,10,Note, not every AF lens in your bag finds 'exact' focus in the real world!
B00DMS0LCO,21,11,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,21,12,I have a 50mm lens and will be getting better lenses....
B00DMS0LCO,21,13,Maybe it is something all cameras with an infrared sensor has problems with.
B00DMS0LCO,21,14,I have owned DSLR's before, and I was happy with my Nikon which died after getting sand in the lens which was too expensive to replace.
B00DMS0LCO,21,15,After using my camera for 10 days the buttons on the back (Menu/Playback/Q) stopped working.
B00DMS0LCO,21,16,This is a great camera and the packaged kit lens is quite good if you get the 18-135mm.
B00DMS0LCO,21,17,If you want a bigger body then just get a added grip, problem solved.
B00DMS0LCO,21,18,Take the time to carefully read the manual on setting it up.
B00DMS0LCO,21,19,Easy to use, with good image quality and lots of options.
B00DMS0LCO,21,20,One like this and another small P&S; I can carry in my pocket.
B00DMS0LCO,21,21,I usually shoot with a 24-105mm lens, so this lens feels a little cheaper than the L quality I'm accustomed to.
B00DMS0LCO,21,22,Just hit one button, pull out the screen and zoom in to the area you wish to be in perfect focus.
B00DMS0LCO,21,23,That was a nice surprise, because I thought it wouldn't work.I still have to get used to the focusing bit.
B00DMS0LCO,21,24,Oh yes, the proof... Come on Amazon, you can train your packaging staff better than that.
B00DMS0LCO,22,0,I am very impressed with the image quality in low or ambient light, where the ISO is under 1000.
B00DMS0LCO,22,1,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,22,2,The image quality is excellent, with good, low ISO noise up to ISO 3200, and, with good noise-reduction software, up to 12,800.Although I bought it for ISO 25,600, where the image quality is adequate with noise reduction, I find its video features very good.
B00DMS0LCO,22,3,Colors are preserved better at high ISOs.
B00DMS0LCO,22,4,Face-tracking is effective even with conventional indoor household lighting.(+/-)
B00DMS0LCO,22,5,My Nikon L820 only takes good photos with the flash, or in great light, and its video was just terrible.
B00DMS0LCO,22,6,Half of the still photos were not clearly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,22,7,Indoors in low light, closer to 3-5 MPH.
B00DMS0LCO,22,8,Those two also have slightly more detail from their 24 MP sensors, similar high-ISO noise, and less shadow noise at low ISO.
B00DMS0LCO,22,9,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,22,10,Just a really good camera that will take me years to really learn but will provide me with strong photos and videos.
B00DMS0LCO,22,11,I did some close ups of outdoor and family indoor shots under varying lighting conditions and in all instance great images.
B00DMS0LCO,22,12,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,22,13,Finally.STILLS:Image quality is very good.
B00DMS0LCO,22,14,All mirrorless bodies still do this in low light and most in bright light.(+)
B00DMS0LCO,22,15,I needed a DSLR which can capture videos and take photos in low light.
B00DMS0LCO,22,16,This camera makes taking pictures or video in low light easy, no visible noise at even very high ISO.
B00DMS0LCO,22,17,The video and shooting autofocus work great although I have had a few times where it would not autofocus on something usually in really low light conditions.
B00DMS0LCO,22,18,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,22,19,Photo colors were not true unless taken in direct sunlight.
B00DMS0LCO,22,20,Noise levels are low, even when shooting RAW and the video quality is great though not a vast improvement.
B00DMS0LCO,22,21,Very good quality pictures
B00DMS0LCO,22,22,There's about a half-stop less noise in JPEG and raw relative to the 18MP bodies and less low-frequency blotchiness at high ISOs.
B00DMS0LCO,22,23,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,22,24,And it seems a very good value for the price.
B00DMS0LCO,23,0,I bought the right one.
B00DMS0LCO,23,1,when I bought this camera, I was scared to buy something I thought I was maybe overspending on a product I would not need.
B00DMS0LCO,23,2,If you get a camera that is used I would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one.
B00DMS0LCO,23,3,It will be returned.
B00DMS0LCO,23,4,Returned for replacement - hope it's OK!
B00DMS0LCO,23,5,I ended up putting more money into a camera than I had planed, And my nervous stomach ache is gone.
B00DMS0LCO,23,6,I purchased this camera about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,23,7,I bought two and both were defective out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,23,8,I really liked this camera but had to return it for a defect.
B00DMS0LCO,23,9,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,10,Got a used camera from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,11,See the Amazon review by Mr. Ralph J. Secoy.
B00DMS0LCO,23,12,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,23,13,This camera has won me over and it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,23,14,Amazon is selling used cameras as new!
B00DMS0LCO,23,15,At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,16,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,23,17,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,18,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,23,19,I'm honestly beginning to wonder if Amazon buys some manufacturer's QC rejects for a discounted price.Triple check everything you buy from Amazon for defects and also verify that you haven't bought a counterfeit item.
B00DMS0LCO,23,20,OK, this is a first for me when dealing with Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,21,Do not buy a 70D from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,22,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,23,The overwhelming majority of the camera equipment I've bought from Amazon has been defective.
B00DMS0LCO,23,24,Box was worn from opening, LCD Display had fingerprints all over it, and the lens had fingerprints and misc other spots on it.Needed this for a birthday this Saturday so returning to Amazon for a refund and going to Best Buy and get them to match the price.I am not likely to ever purchase a big ticket item from Amazon as I don't want used cameras, etc.
B00DMS0LCO,24,0,Take the time to carefully read the manual on setting it up.
B00DMS0LCO,24,1,operating manual before you buy, IMHO.)
B00DMS0LCO,24,2,You can use manual focus if you need more control.
B00DMS0LCO,24,3,Also I didn't find a way to enable/disable flash using the "Quick Control" button in advanced modes such as P. It is however present in basic modes such as A+!6.
B00DMS0LCO,24,4,The physical UI is better, though the menu UI is less polished, as are some software features.
B00DMS0LCO,24,5,If you can find it, buy it!
B00DMS0LCO,24,6,New Canon user!
B00DMS0LCO,24,7,Read their review.
B00DMS0LCO,24,8,I wish I can assign the WB to a button, but you can not.
B00DMS0LCO,24,9,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,24,10,In LV mode, when you are switching between still photo shooting modes using mode dial, LV switches off which is somewhat annoying.8.
B00DMS0LCO,24,11,Overall, I am very excited about my switch to Canon, I have no complaints thus far and the only thing I need to do now is learn this new button layout which I am not at all used to.
B00DMS0LCO,24,12,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,24,13,Five buttons have switched functions relative to the 60D.
B00DMS0LCO,24,14,Just a really good camera that will take me years to really learn but will provide me with strong photos and videos.
B00DMS0LCO,24,15,Way to go Canon!
B00DMS0LCO,24,16,It just works.
B00DMS0LCO,24,17,A new button near the shutter changes AF modes.
B00DMS0LCO,24,18,Like any new system there is the typical learning curve but very easy to use.
B00DMS0LCO,24,19,Lastly, I think it would be really convenient, if in VF mode, when you are switching shooting modes using mode dial, the LV panel could automatically show the information about that shooting mode.
B00DMS0LCO,24,20,The dial works, it's just small.
B00DMS0LCO,24,21,Example: you can not assign the buttons you like.
B00DMS0LCO,24,22,I expected this to happen but it illustrates photographers need to control the point of focus and shouldn't expect cameras to read their mind.
B00DMS0LCO,24,23,The Sony RX10 has 3 custom WB and the 70D has just one.5.WB: if you want to chance the custom WB, you have to go and dig into the main menu.
B00DMS0LCO,24,24,I do miss the solid built-like-a-tank magnesium body of the 7D, but the 70D is simply a better camera all around, and as it should be, it's like 5 years newer!Some reviewers have mentioned that the quick control wheel/dial thing feels cheap and rather chintzy, and i have to concur, it's definitely the 'cheapest' feeling part of the 70d, but with the the other dial on the front near the shutter button as well the touch screen i never really have to use that dial anyway, so it's not really a big deal.Photography wise, i am getting fantastic photos, as i expected.
B00DMS0LCO,25,0,Coming from using Nikons (D7000 and D600), I got tired of terrible back focus issues and oil spots on my sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,25,1,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,25,2,After accumulating four lenses, I kicked myself for not waiting to buy a Nikon instead.
B00DMS0LCO,25,3,If you can find it, buy it!
B00DMS0LCO,25,4,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,25,5,Maybe it is something all cameras with an infrared sensor has problems with.
B00DMS0LCO,25,6,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,25,7,I have used Xsi, 7D, 6D, 60D, 5Dii  5Diii and Nikon D90, D600 , D7000, and D7100.
B00DMS0LCO,25,8,Just a really good camera that will take me years to really learn but will provide me with strong photos and videos.
B00DMS0LCO,25,9,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,25,10,Focus issue???? Sign the petition!
B00DMS0LCO,25,11,Canon will probably respond with an update to resolve the issue as they have in the past.
B00DMS0LCO,25,12,Same issues.
B00DMS0LCO,25,13,Great upgrade!
B00DMS0LCO,25,14,For most people that will buy a camera just to put pictures on the internet, the 20.2 really wont' make much of a difference to them.
B00DMS0LCO,25,15,New Canon user!
B00DMS0LCO,25,16,No problems yet, nothing that I've found problematic.
B00DMS0LCO,25,17,The quality is very good in the stills [I do not blow up to 10 times], and the video's were very good.
B00DMS0LCO,25,18,I had not heard of any focusing issues but a quick internet search on "70D focus issues" yielded a large volume of unhappy customers who have spent a lot of time researching the issue.
B00DMS0LCO,25,19,My first DSLR.
B00DMS0LCO,25,20,I have been reading every review that has come available on the Internet and also You-tube.
B00DMS0LCO,25,21,For what I typical shoot, this hasn't been a problem.
B00DMS0LCO,25,22,Honestly, I don't feel this issue should deter you from purchasing, the camera is amazing.
B00DMS0LCO,25,23,This is my first DSLR, so you may want to take this review with a grain of salt.
B00DMS0LCO,25,24,I really like the camera but there may be one big flaw.
