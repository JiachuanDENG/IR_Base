B005IHAIMA,0,0,Using this with Eye-Fi card, battery last about 160-200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,0,1,I just like to recomand this camera, he is great and a very good price.
B005IHAIMA,0,2,Very good camera and a very good image.
B005IHAIMA,0,3,have a nice day
B005IHAIMA,0,4,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,0,5,The flash feeds off the main battery, which can be good and bad.
B005IHAIMA,0,6,My Canon batteries charge from empty to full power in under 2 hours.-
B005IHAIMA,0,7,Really a good cameraI.
B005IHAIMA,0,8,Wasabi batteries  that I ordered are working too.
B005IHAIMA,0,9,I have waited to buy it for a long time.
B005IHAIMA,0,10,I can't say enough good thing about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,0,11,This should be equated into the total cost of ownership if a viewfinder is important to the consumer.The battery life seems good for now.
B005IHAIMA,0,12,few years back I had a bad taste for Sony due to their camera's being battery (AA) for most styles.
B005IHAIMA,0,13,This needs to be corrected!!! Also, Sony's new thing with their cameras is that they will ONLY take a Sony battery.
B005IHAIMA,0,14,No more guessing and losing the perfect shot (happened so many times!) because 1/4 remaining battery equates to 2 percent!This is the first time that the auto modes actually work for me.
B005IHAIMA,0,15,At the end of the day, does it take amazing quality photos?
B005IHAIMA,0,16,If you are bringing it along, you have to make the commitment that you'll be carrying a larger camera bag.Like most good cameras, the battery is rechargeable.
B005IHAIMA,0,17,Finally, I got it at a good price.
B005IHAIMA,0,18,This can be considered a pro too, as Sony did a great job with the regular controls.Pros:The battery lasts a good long time.
B005IHAIMA,0,19,I must have mistaken this feature from some other camera I was researching.At this time, the only real negative I can find is the battery door.
B005IHAIMA,0,20,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,0,21,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,0,22,I figured the battery was dead, so I threw it on the charger.
B005IHAIMA,0,23,I carry 3 batteries total so running out of juice has not been an issue.
B005IHAIMA,0,24,The camera is going back to Amazon and it will be a long long while I will ever consider Sony again...
B005IHAIMA,1,0,I don't like touch screens.
B005IHAIMA,1,1,Try it and you'll see.I also like the articulated LCD on the back, and the touch screen, and the simplicity of the menus.
B005IHAIMA,1,2,Overall the screen is quite good and I only miss it in very bright sun.-
B005IHAIMA,1,3,Tap the screen to focus during movie (haven't tried it for photo--haven't tried it because touch screen so new to me on a camera).
B005IHAIMA,1,4,Easy control and settings with touch screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,5,Also the screen is susceptible to scratches.
B005IHAIMA,1,6,I recommend getting a screen protector.
B005IHAIMA,1,7,the screen is very clear and bright.
B005IHAIMA,1,8,It has a great lcd screen and the best of any of the mirrorless cameras I have tried.
B005IHAIMA,1,9,The touch screen is nice that wasn't in NEX-5, and so with NEX-5N you can operate the mode dials or touch the screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,10,the screen cover is high quality and I would recommend to anyone with a Nex5 camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,11,This camera is quite good.
B005IHAIMA,1,12,Such crisp images and such a great preview screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,13,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,1,14,The first way is handheld, and using its rear LCD screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,15,This camera takes great photos.
B005IHAIMA,1,16,With the screen articulated to face up, taking photos is quick and easy.
B005IHAIMA,1,17,The tilting screen is a great thing, but it doesn't flip around (although it does on the NEX F3), so you can't see yourself.-
B005IHAIMA,1,18,Very stealth with the flipout screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,19,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,20,Can be scratched easily as with all this new touch screen tech out here.
B005IHAIMA,1,21,But, the photos it took were okay when small, but not so good on a bigger computer screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,22,Recommended for size, weight, image quality, video quality and reliability.
B005IHAIMA,1,23,The most helpful setting was "Big font" under Camera options.
B005IHAIMA,1,24,Since the screen on this camera is adjustable, can't see a need for it anyway.
B005IHAIMA,2,0,Excellent cameraWas undecided between the Canon T3i and this model but it is very good.
B005IHAIMA,2,1,Upgraded the firmware to newest version, Auto focus is fast!
B005IHAIMA,2,2,Love what it can do but not perfect.
B005IHAIMA,2,3,Great Fun.
B005IHAIMA,2,4,Anyway camera showed up, needed a firmware upgrade which was super easy and I am in love.
B005IHAIMA,2,5,It's almost a return to cameras of the past with their split-screen viewfinders and MF-only lenses.
B005IHAIMA,2,6,I love it.
B005IHAIMA,2,7,If you shoot fast moving subjects like sports, you'll prefer a DSLR as the autofocus on the NEX just isn't as good.
B005IHAIMA,2,8,My last camera was a Canon Rebel, and I was ready to upgrade to something smaller.
B005IHAIMA,2,9,A view finder, which is lacking, would be a great help.The stabilization is not as good as on the Panasonic FZ150 and I find that with the Sony, my videos are pretty "wobbly."
B005IHAIMA,2,10,The fps is super fast, as is the focus.
B005IHAIMA,2,11,Pictures and video do look great, and I love the way it handles.
B005IHAIMA,2,12,Love the images and the size.
B005IHAIMA,2,13,Even video taken in low light can look good.
B005IHAIMA,2,14,As much as I love this camera, I may try the upgrade, but at nearly treble the cost for a 50% increase in image size, that will wait quite a bit.
B005IHAIMA,2,15,You can put the focus precisely where you want it, which is great when shooting wide-open.
B005IHAIMA,2,16,I feel better having done that.
B005IHAIMA,2,17,Took this ice climbing (with the fixed 1.8/50mm which I love) and portrait-style/climber in action pictures were excellent.
B005IHAIMA,2,18,I am upgraded from the M43 and I would say I am very satisfied with it.
B005IHAIMA,2,19,Auto focus is near perfect in good light, and very good in low light.Macro with the kit zoom, using menu setting "Camera - AF/MF - DMF".  can give some pretty nice shots, but you will need to stay 9-10" away with this lens to focus.
B005IHAIMA,2,20,It would be good if the auto ISO was customizable, and maybe it will be in a future firmware update.
B005IHAIMA,2,21,It was time for me to upgrade from my Nikon D50 (a 6.1 megapixel dinosaur I came to find out).
B005IHAIMA,2,22,Love it!!!! Love it love it!!!!
B005IHAIMA,2,23,Only downfall is the live view LCD doesn't let the battery last as long as a DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,2,24,It should be noted that e-mount lenses are very well priced when compared to other systems.
B005IHAIMA,3,0,Video Quality is stellar as well.
B005IHAIMA,3,1,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,2,I just like to recomand this camera, he is great and a very good price.
B005IHAIMA,3,3,Very good camera and a very good image.
B005IHAIMA,3,4,great portability and great image quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,5,Great value.
B005IHAIMA,3,6,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,7,But it must go back, the sound is uncalled for.
B005IHAIMA,3,8,the video quality is really superb.
B005IHAIMA,3,9,Good for still photo.
B005IHAIMA,3,10,Image quality is stellar.
B005IHAIMA,3,11,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,12,:) OH! and picture quality is pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,3,13,A great camera for photographing, but not for video recording.
B005IHAIMA,3,14,Do a search on Vimeo to see the video quality, you will be impressed.
B005IHAIMA,3,15,I couldn't have taken it with the R1.And the video.
B005IHAIMA,3,16,But my impression is very good.At first, I was very anxious about the clicking sound during video recording and I was glad that it was not present.
B005IHAIMA,3,17,Everything is good except the annoying click noise in video mode.
B005IHAIMA,3,18,The best value and quality for $650.
B005IHAIMA,3,19,The defect does not affect the picture quality of still images or video, but it does make the video recording feature unusable as the clicking noise is very noticeable.
B005IHAIMA,3,20,The video recording is excellent and clear.
B005IHAIMA,3,21,Awesome Still Images and Video Quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,22,And the test video also shows the same thing.
B005IHAIMA,3,23,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,3,24,The videos are excellent, with good stabilization and decent sound.
B005IHAIMA,4,0,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,4,1,This is a great camera!
B005IHAIMA,4,2,Tried out the manual modes, but mostly just used Auto because that is what I wanted.
B005IHAIMA,4,3,As he has been using a DSLR for awhile now, the unclear settings didn't set him back as much as us.
B005IHAIMA,4,4,However, this camera shoots DSLR quality photos that are amazing in auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,5,Great transition camera from point and shoots, works as well as most DSLR!!!
B005IHAIMA,4,6,Only took 250 shots so far.
B005IHAIMA,4,7,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,8,Amazing picture quality in auto mode - I gave up on my DSLR largely because I am such an amateur photographer that I could never get the settings right to take a great photo.
B005IHAIMA,4,9,For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,10,Low light shots are amazing so far.
B005IHAIMA,4,11,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,4,12,great camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,13,The rest of us are moving up from a point and shoot and are still learning how to use a DSLR.This camera has a few features that could be a little better, but overall it's great.
B005IHAIMA,4,14,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,15,The good thing was, I hardly needed to use it even at night because it was so amazing at adjusting to the setting.
B005IHAIMA,4,16,I use the Auto mode basically all the time.
B005IHAIMA,4,17,Takes great low light photos- I rarely use the flash with this camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,18,Even video taken in low light can look good.
B005IHAIMA,4,19,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,4,20,A fun auto stiching panorama mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,21,The intelligent auto is great.
B005IHAIMA,4,22,Instead, it takes amazing low light pictures (even in a mostly dark room) in auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,4,23,The controls are much better, allowing things like manual focus, manual exposure, etc.
B005IHAIMA,4,24,This camera puts forth such great, quality photos in auto mode that I usually do not have to do much editing to get a great picture to share.4)
B005IHAIMA,5,0,In evening events like volleyball and soccer, I used ISO 800 and 1600 to still get fast shutter to stop the action.
B005IHAIMA,5,1,The images are superb, the start up time and shooting speed are fast!
B005IHAIMA,5,2,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,5,3,I've tried adjusting shutter speed, ISO, etc and still didn't have much luck.
B005IHAIMA,5,4,Everyone is in awe when they here the rapid-fire.The shutter also makes a nice "mechanical" sound when you take a shot.
B005IHAIMA,5,5,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,5,6,Great For the Moment Camera.
B005IHAIMA,5,7,So far, the freedom to set shutter speed for motion shots has been the most fun.
B005IHAIMA,5,8,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,5,9,;)Start-up time is very fast, and shot-to-shot time is even faster.
B005IHAIMA,5,10,The lens is light, but feels substantial.
B005IHAIMA,5,11,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,5,12,Autofocus is fast and works well for pictures of my kids.
B005IHAIMA,5,13,So, I cannot takes photos at weddings with this camera, I cannot take photos at sports events (Golf mainly) with this camera and cannot take photos of my grandchildren with this camera.
B005IHAIMA,5,14,I wanted something to take pictures of my fast moving children.
B005IHAIMA,5,15,One great feature is being able to magnify the sceen image to 4.8X or even 9.5X after the camera has auto-focused on subject, by turning the focusing ring on the lens.......this can also be done with a telescopic lens by tapping the image on the touch screen.
B005IHAIMA,5,16,This is easy though since all I have to do is tap the screen in the spot I want the camera to focus and it focuses.
B005IHAIMA,5,17,Great transition camera from point and shoots, works as well as most DSLR!!!
B005IHAIMA,5,18,Incredibly fast, small and powerful.
B005IHAIMA,5,19,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,5,20,Shots are brighter and cleaner than any shots I've ever seen from a digital.The fast continuous shooting mode is impressive.
B005IHAIMA,5,21,The shutter response is nice and fast, and in burst mode can shoot a lot a photos in just a few seconds.I really like how much smaller an lighter this camera is.
B005IHAIMA,5,22,:) OH! and picture quality is pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,5,23,ISO performance holds up to 100% on screen inspection up to ISO 6400, though the auto ISO only goes up to ISO 3200.
B005IHAIMA,5,24,I also noticed the same exact spots when is happened to use iso 100 and 1 second shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,6,0,The include flash...is a flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,1,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,6,2,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,6,3,Video Quality is stellar as well.
B005IHAIMA,6,4,I got this with my sony card and it was expensive but worth every dime.
B005IHAIMA,6,5,Image quality is stellar.
B005IHAIMA,6,6,I do very little direct flash lighting, so it's not something I would use much.I have ordered the optional flash, which has bounce options.
B005IHAIMA,6,7,I inserted the memory card into my laptop and was able to confirm that the images turned out good.
B005IHAIMA,6,8,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,6,9,The camera is very fast to focus and shoot images.
B005IHAIMA,6,10,Excellent camera for the price.
B005IHAIMA,6,11,I don't find having the flash and viewfinder or mic (both purchased separately) being separate to be an issue.
B005IHAIMA,6,12,It's unfortunate that the optional viewfinder is a rather expensive investment at $348 and it takes up the flash location when in use.The flash is removable and has numerous positions for fill, bounce or direct lighting.
B005IHAIMA,6,13,Excellent photos...
B005IHAIMA,6,14,The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,15,Overall I think it is a very nice design.The video appears to be good too.
B005IHAIMA,6,16,The camera is so good with low light that I almost never use the flash, but because the flash comes with a little plastic case that attaches right to the camera strap, the flash is always handy if needed.The bottom line:  I LOVE this camera, and though the menu is cumbersome I'd still buy it again because the low light capabilities are awesome.
B005IHAIMA,6,17,Perfect size, lots of features, takes great pictures, even when it is dark.
B005IHAIMA,6,18,Photos great, video sucks.
B005IHAIMA,6,19,A STEAL!!Buy it, get yourself a lens hood, some lens filters, the new holga effect lenses, or the awesome sony lenses, a 4G SD card (takes up to 800 shots all you need trust me), a carrying case for it (recommend Case Logic SLRC-205), the flash, and the viewfinder if you feel you'll need them.Cant be used with photoshop out of the box, but check the web, there are downloads to get around that type of thing.
B005IHAIMA,6,20,We were working with the 18-55 lens and also the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,6,21,I took a ton of shots in low light over the holidays, and the camera did extremely well with no flash, so well that I doubt I will ever use the included flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,22,Glad i bought it.I paid $623 on EBAY and mine came with a 18/55MM Lens, flash, a small SONY tote bag, 4GB SD Card, and charger/battery.
B005IHAIMA,6,23,I was pretty much shooting blind; luckily my images came out without any glaring issues.
B005IHAIMA,6,24,If you are bringing it along, you have to make the commitment that you'll be carrying a larger camera bag.Like most good cameras, the battery is rechargeable.
B005IHAIMA,7,0,I'm using 21/4 Skopar, 28/3.5 Skopar, 35/1.7 Ultron, 50/1.5 Ultron with great results.
B005IHAIMA,7,1,I was looking for a camera which was small in size but was great in taking pictures.
B005IHAIMA,7,2,If you wnat a small package and great quality this is it.
B005IHAIMA,7,3,Great value.
B005IHAIMA,7,4,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,7,5,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,7,6,Both very nice.
B005IHAIMA,7,7,great quality in small package.
B005IHAIMA,7,8,I also have a Canon G11 (which I love)This is a great in between a DSLR and a POcket cam.
B005IHAIMA,7,9,The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.
B005IHAIMA,7,10,Compact camera with DSLR quality.
B005IHAIMA,7,11,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,7,12,Best of the Compact Camera lines.
B005IHAIMA,7,13,great portability and great image quality.
B005IHAIMA,7,14,The compact size of a point-and-shoot camera with the quality of a DSLR one.
B005IHAIMA,7,15,I have for the last 10 years just had a canon powershot that I could put in my pocket.
B005IHAIMA,7,16,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,7,17,Since that camera, I've owned over 35 digital cameras and have witnessed the evolution of digital imaging, with great excitement, to the present day.All the while I've been waiting for the size and weight of digital SLR's to come down.
B005IHAIMA,7,18,Also, while 55mm doesn't sound like much, with 16 megapixels and the camera's super-easy way of zooming in on the pics you have taken, it is easy to zoom in after the shot is taken and still get excellent resolution.
B005IHAIMA,7,19,We traveled mainly by public transit and by foot so its compact size and light weight in combination the Sony LCS-BBF carrying case made it easy to carry everywhere.
B005IHAIMA,7,20,We bought it for our honeymoon this year and it was great!
B005IHAIMA,7,21,great buy worth every penny
B005IHAIMA,7,22,Easy to use, lightweight, stylish, and it takes dslr quality pictures.
B005IHAIMA,7,23,I just like to recomand this camera, he is great and a very good price.
B005IHAIMA,7,24,I wanted something I could still fit in my purse and this is just on the larger side of fitting, but it still does.
B005IHAIMA,8,0,So far I only have the 16mm and the kit 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,1,I'm okay with the kit lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,2,Dug up a basket of great legacy lenses to try on the Nex 5n.
B005IHAIMA,8,3,Lens for Sony NEX Cameras.
B005IHAIMA,8,4,If you buy one, get the kit with the 18-55 lens which represents the best value.
B005IHAIMA,8,5,Compared to DSLR, m43, Point/Shoot, NEX 3, NEX C3.
B005IHAIMA,8,6,With a pancake lens like the Sony 16mm, the weight and size approximates an XZ2 or LX7.Also, when you point this camera and the pancake lens at a person, there is no "DSLR intimidation" and frown....
B005IHAIMA,8,7,A great Prime Lens for the Nex e-mount Sony 50mm f/1.8 Mid-Range Lens for Sony E Mount Nex Cameras4.
B005IHAIMA,8,8,I cannot say it was outperformed by say, Nikkor's kit lens in any way.
B005IHAIMA,8,9,(Other than more lenses)
B005IHAIMA,8,10,Lens are somewhat limited at this point, but with lenses adapters the possibilities are endless.
B005IHAIMA,8,11,After dragging an 18MP dSLR with 18-200 lens to Disneyland and taking only 200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,8,12,So I bought the NEX-5N with the 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,13,I purchased the Nex 5N with the 18-55mm kit lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,14,It was known for its great lens and sensor, but had no image stabilization.
B005IHAIMA,8,15,It's sensor is one of the sharpest sensors I've ever seen.
B005IHAIMA,8,16,For a kit lens, I am impressed.
B005IHAIMA,8,17,For this reason, it is inevitable and also advantageous to use one's dSLR lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.I am able to use my Nikon F-mount lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.
B005IHAIMA,8,18,The image quality of this new sensor put in the 5N is extraordinary.
B005IHAIMA,8,19,It's a very solid camera with very good picture quality and the kit lens is quite nice as well.
B005IHAIMA,8,20,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,8,21,Nex 5n is a blast!
B005IHAIMA,8,22,With the 55-210 mm telephoto zoom lens (or any of the other large superzooms for the E-mount like the Sony Alpha SEL18200 E-mount 18-200mm F3.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,8,23,We were working with the 18-55 lens and also the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3
B005IHAIMA,8,24,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.
B005IHAIMA,9,0,Image quality is stellar.
B005IHAIMA,9,1,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,9,2,Great image quality but try before you buy.
B005IHAIMA,9,3,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,9,4,very good camera.
B005IHAIMA,9,5,Even video taken in low light can look good.
B005IHAIMA,9,6,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,9,7,Video Quality is stellar as well.
B005IHAIMA,9,8,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,9,9,I wanted it for the video quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,10,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,9,11,I always wanted a camera that could take DSLR quality images without the size.
B005IHAIMA,9,12,Low noise at high iso as well.
B005IHAIMA,9,13,Any the photos' quility is high.
B005IHAIMA,9,14,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,9,15,It's small and light.
B005IHAIMA,9,16,The camera has great ISO performance and very good color replication.
B005IHAIMA,9,17,This will give most people all the image quality they will ever need and then some.
B005IHAIMA,9,18,Excellent sharpness, color saturation and low light performance.
B005IHAIMA,9,19,Awesome Still Images and Video Quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,20,The camera produces really high quality pictures!
B005IHAIMA,9,21,FANTASTIC for low light, such as in restaurants.
B005IHAIMA,9,22,The high ISO quality and resolution at most ISO's really amazes me.
B005IHAIMA,9,23,:) OH! and picture quality is pretty good.

B005IHAIMA,10,5,The picture quality is just nuts from a camera at this price.
B005IHAIMA,10,6,This camera has it all and can do it all, and for damn near 1/2 the price of its competitors.
B005IHAIMA,10,7,I used this for well over year now, a lot, and I think it's great.

B005IHAIMA,10,22,I love this camera.
B005IHAIMA,10,23,I bought this camera about a year and a half ago.
B005IHAIMA,10,24,I like this product because it works very well and cost very little.
B005IHAIMA,11,0,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,1,I found this camera very easy to use.
B005IHAIMA,11,2,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,3,It's lightweight, easy to use and I get great photos with it.
B005IHAIMA,11,4,This camera takes great photos.
B005IHAIMA,11,5,Great pictures from a compact camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,6,I am not a professional photographer, but this camera is great, the look, easy access, weight and functions...I just love it
B005IHAIMA,11,7,Love it!!!! Love it love it!!!!
B005IHAIMA,11,8,A camera that is just easy to use and takes great pics.
B005IHAIMA,11,9,Great Fun.
B005IHAIMA,11,10,I was looking for a camera which was small in size but was great in taking pictures.
B005IHAIMA,11,11,Picture shooting effect is good and easy to handle.
B005IHAIMA,11,12,very easy to handle.
B005IHAIMA,11,13,I have been asked a several times if I am a professional photographer (No! It's just a great camera!).
B005IHAIMA,11,14,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,11,15,I love it.
B005IHAIMA,11,16,I am most certainly a novice photographer and this camera is a great stepping stone for me.So far I am liking the photo quality I have seen come out of it.
B005IHAIMA,11,17,It is great taking pictures indoor and outdoor.It looks good and has a good grip to take pictures comfortably.
B005IHAIMA,11,18,Great for point and shoot or more advanced photographers.
B005IHAIMA,11,19,If you're someone that doesn't care to learn the manual settings of a camera, this camera has a lot of automatic functions to choose from but it has great manual functions as well.
B005IHAIMA,11,20,Great transition camera from point and shoots, works as well as most DSLR!!!
B005IHAIMA,11,21,Really a good cameraI.
B005IHAIMA,11,22,The size of the camera, its feather weight and easy controls including an excellent LCD screen make this a fun to use camera and easy to carry everywhere.
B005IHAIMA,11,23,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,11,24,The image quality is excellent, the controls are good, as is the touch base menu system.
B005IHAIMA,12,0,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,1,Great camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,2,Takes great pics.
B005IHAIMA,12,3,Great Camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,4,If I can use it effectively (and all my pics have come out GREAT I must say) then most anyone could.
B005IHAIMA,12,5,What surprised me was the quality of HD video.
B005IHAIMA,12,6,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,12,7,Great deal on a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,8,Takes outstanding pictures and video.
B005IHAIMA,12,9,Great cam for taking videos and having always around.
B005IHAIMA,12,10,Check out video quality of "hungry seagulls" on U-tube.
B005IHAIMA,12,11,Amazing camera at an amazing price - review for Video.
B005IHAIMA,12,12,Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012.
B005IHAIMA,12,13,mainly got this for video, and for the size, so i will not review picture quality (its been done plenty of times).video is amazing, especially coming from a t2i, and using my gf's t4i. the best part is - true autofocus during video.
B005IHAIMA,12,14,It also takes great pics and especially videos.But there are also a couple of flaws which spoil the overall experience.1.
B005IHAIMA,12,15,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,12,16,Perfect size, lots of features, takes great pictures, even when it is dark.
B005IHAIMA,12,17,Be aware if you want to use it to make home video.
B005IHAIMA,12,18,Excellent camera from Sony.
B005IHAIMA,12,19,The kit zoom is very comendable and the video features are excellent.
B005IHAIMA,12,20,Great upgrade or go-to camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,21,Excellent still photos but the clicking problem in the video makes it not worth the money.
B005IHAIMA,12,22,Took amazing pics and easy to use.
B005IHAIMA,12,23,I love this camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,24,The only thing I would love is if I could record video using the same effects as I can for still shots, but that is a very minor deal to me.
B005IHAIMA,13,0,This happens using a (spare) battery used in the NEX-5.
B005IHAIMA,13,1,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,13,2,Battery lasts for a while.
B005IHAIMA,13,3,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.
B005IHAIMA,13,4,I figured the battery was dead, so I threw it on the charger.
B005IHAIMA,13,5,Not exactly efficient, but at least the menus are not hard to navigate or use.The Bad:Battery life - Perhaps I am spoiled, but when I go out for a whole day of shooting pictures and video, I expect the battery to last the whole day.
B005IHAIMA,13,6,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,13,7,Possibly small ones.Battery life is pretty weak.
B005IHAIMA,13,8,I do get significantly more barrel distortion from the SONY 18-55mm lens than from the Canon 17mm-85mm.BATTERYNEX-5N comes with a separate battery recharger, which is handy since the camera drains the battery rather fast it is nice to have a spare battery charging while the camera is being used.
B005IHAIMA,13,9,My Canon batteries charge from empty to full power in under 2 hours.-
B005IHAIMA,13,10,I purchased a 3-d party (Wasabi) battery pack (two NP-FW50 batteries, one Wasabi AC charger, one car charger converter for Wasabi AC charger, European converter) which works well with my NEX-5N.
B005IHAIMA,13,11,It is still going strong and we use it all the time without fail it takes the nicest photos with the least amount of out of focus shots I have ever had.
B005IHAIMA,13,12,I did not have time to confirm this.FIRST USEOnce the battery was fully charged, I reinstalled it into the camera and attached the 50mm E-Mount lens (SEL50F18).
B005IHAIMA,13,13,A series of Sony Viao laptops drained their batteries even when the computer was off because there was a design failure and the battery circuit could not be closed.
B005IHAIMA,13,14,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,13,15,This is REALLY disappointing and as much as I wanted to buy this camera, I will not and do not recommend to do so.
B005IHAIMA,13,16,They both involve the screen flickering about 1/2 second after you turn the camera off under different circumstances.
B005IHAIMA,13,17,Low light...no problem.
B005IHAIMA,13,18,But the camera error message came back on while I was on vacation.
B005IHAIMA,13,19,The screen turns blue and flashes 'camera error'.
B005IHAIMA,13,20,few years back I had a bad taste for Sony due to their camera's being battery (AA) for most styles.
B005IHAIMA,13,21,Using this with Eye-Fi card, battery last about 160-200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,13,22,It is small enough and good enough, not quite great but good enough.
B005IHAIMA,13,23,Luckily, I bought an extra battery as back up and that solves it.
B005IHAIMA,13,24,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,14,0,I don't like touch screens.
B005IHAIMA,14,1,My only problem is that I have polarized sunglasses, and when I wear them, I can't see the image on the display screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,2,I like that you can adjust the screen for above/below views.
B005IHAIMA,14,3,You can customize 3 of the buttons on the back of the camera, and that helps tremendously, but there are still several things I wish were more readily available without fumbling through the menu.There is no viewfinder so you must frame your photos using the LCD screen, which can be difficult in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,14,4,;-)* The screen is very hard to use in direct sunlight.
B005IHAIMA,14,5,The screen turns blue and flashes 'camera error'.
B005IHAIMA,14,6,You MUST buy a the screen protector for this product as it is prone to damage over time.
B005IHAIMA,14,7,Very stealth with the flipout screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,8,With the screen articulated to face up, taking photos is quick and easy.
B005IHAIMA,14,9,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,14,10,The finder is very big and you can change the angle of finder display which allow users to shoot in various ways.
B005IHAIMA,14,11,Can be scratched easily as with all this new touch screen tech out here.
B005IHAIMA,14,12,Also, the touch screen is incredible.
B005IHAIMA,14,13,Also, the LCD screen had finger prints.I dont want to Buy a used product with Full Price, $775(including tax)  and not ready to deal with other issues with the camera.(Already
B005IHAIMA,14,14,you can resolve this issue by removing the sticker behind the LCD screen and extending out the LCD screen so the camera can cool faster but that will void your warranty.
B005IHAIMA,14,15,If someone is considering both of these cameras let me start with the differences between the two cameras that made me choose NEX-5N.My main issue with C3 was seeing the LCD screen in the sun.
B005IHAIMA,14,16,Then one summer day last week, while taking some family photos, I touched the square on the touch screen to fix focus on my kid's face and the screen instantly developed a crack on the inside.Called Sony and explained the issue.
B005IHAIMA,14,17,great camera, but it has one problem that is fatal, the flash design is flawed.
B005IHAIMA,14,18,However you can always see it enough to frame the image.*
B005IHAIMA,14,19,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.
B005IHAIMA,14,20,This can be improved by adjusting the brightness setting, or for $300+ you can purchase an add-on electronic viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,14,21,Dead pixels in LCD panels are a fact of life, and 1 dead pixel on a screen is well within acceptable QA limits, and would not be considered a defect.
B005IHAIMA,14,22,For those times when I do get down on one knee to take a shot, I can take an even lower angle in my shots.Coming immediately from using a dSLR, I do notice a short lag when compared to the optical viewfinder of a dSLR.
B005IHAIMA,14,23,Easy control and settings with touch screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,24,the screw that secures the attachment of the flash to the top of the camera battery is inaccessible to those that have big fingers!
B005IHAIMA,15,0,I can either have a viewfinder of a flash on, not both.
B005IHAIMA,15,1,If you buy the viewfinder then you cannot use the enclosed flash while the viewfinder is in use.
B005IHAIMA,15,2,With the latest firmware update, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,15,3,My Canon G12 is slow to focus.
B005IHAIMA,15,4,It focuses fast enough though there has been a time or two af has failed me.
B005IHAIMA,15,5,No built in viewfinder - you can buy one for $250 extra but I don't want to spend $250 on a viewfinder - a viewfinder and an extra lens take this camera up to 7N territory in cost which has a lot more than just the viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,15,6,I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2.
B005IHAIMA,15,7,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.
B005IHAIMA,15,8,So if you have any substantial money in lenses that are not E-mount, pick something else.If you get the viewfinder, you have to pick between a flash, or the viewfinder, or the microphone.
B005IHAIMA,15,9,Now that Sony has fixed it, it's a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,15,10,Instead, I would just upgrade to the NEX 7 or another Sony NEX model that comes with the electronic viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,15,11,The new firmware upgrade makes the Nex series much easier to navagate.
B005IHAIMA,15,12,In time its shortcomings (primarily slow repeat shooting and poor autofocus) came to really bug me and I've moved on to better cameras.
B005IHAIMA,15,13,The camera has inconsistent problem of getting locked up when shooting.
B005IHAIMA,15,14,I first purchased Sony NEX-C3 and liked  many things about it, but two problems caused me to trade it in for Sony NEX-5N, which addressed those two problems.
B005IHAIMA,15,15,Upgraded the firmware to newest version, Auto focus is fast!
B005IHAIMA,15,16,The latest firmware update allows users to set auto-exposure bracketing to as wide as 3 stops per shot.
B005IHAIMA,15,17,Hopefully, SONY will provide some modifications in firmware upgrades to make the camera a little easier to use.
B005IHAIMA,15,18,The additional (but expensive) FDA-EV1S Electronic Viewfinder is pretty much a must for manual lens use, and also makes the process much more enjoyable to look "through" an actual viewfinder and use that point of contact as an additional point of stability to add steadiness to shots in lower light.
B005IHAIMA,15,19,In particular, I'd love to have a wide lens - 11mm or so - for REAL pano shots.
B005IHAIMA,15,20,It's an excellent viewfinder, but it's an extra outlay of cash.
B005IHAIMA,15,21,Great upgrade or go-to camera.
B005IHAIMA,15,22,Everyone should give manual lenses a shot since the camera offers several options when focuses.
B005IHAIMA,15,23,Wow.Downside:  I wish there were more lenses available for this, and faster ones too.
B005IHAIMA,15,24,Originally, it was only 0.7 stops, which is pretty much useless.
B005IHAIMA,16,0,I call back and Im told that I am already in line to get a call from a Tech.
B005IHAIMA,16,1,Finally I contacted Sony support and they told me that the camera had to be sent in for repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,2,Who knows, and at this point, who cares.After one more call to Sony, they said they would have a technician call me, but so far, no one has called.
B005IHAIMA,16,3,Defective after Sony Repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,4,The representative assured me that I would have to ship the camera at my expense but it would be repaired and send back at no charge.
B005IHAIMA,16,5,FURTHER UPDATE  ***After dodging my calls, I finally gave up on Sony support.
B005IHAIMA,16,6,I call Sony Service and reference the email about the expedited return and repair as well as my original repair #.
B005IHAIMA,16,7,My first was returned before being aware of the Service Call issued by Sony for the clicking issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,8,My revised rating and review is based off the poor experience with Sony Technical Support and the repair of the issue.I contacted Sony Service using the repair number of my Service Call repair, after receiving my "repaired" 5n and noticing the new sound issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,9,The person again states that the Tech is already set to call me.The next day I get the call.
B005IHAIMA,16,10,My next camera will probably be a Nikon or a Canon, from a company that actually takes pride in their cameras.
B005IHAIMA,16,11,Again they do call but not when Im available, but do leave a voicemail that I should call back.
B005IHAIMA,16,12,You sure you want to buy something new at a cost of $700 and send it back straight to the service center and wait for 5 days or more and still have that problem there after it comes back?
B005IHAIMA,16,13,TBH, Sony customer service was very good and they paid for shipping.
B005IHAIMA,16,14,I just called Sony and they confirmed that the issue is still there and that customers need to send their $700 cameras if they find the clicking issue.I asked them whether they can tell me a way to figure out whether the issue is still present but they said they cannot.
B005IHAIMA,16,15,Unfortunately they require that the camera be shipped to a Sony service center for repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,16,I later find out they tried to call but I was not avialable.
B005IHAIMA,16,17,I received this camera around 11/10 and called the next day for a replacement.
B005IHAIMA,16,18,Sony is finally acknowledging the problem just not saying what it is and if the fix will completely fix the problem.
B005IHAIMA,16,19,But back it goes to Sony for repair, since I'm now out of the return period.
B005IHAIMA,16,20,A day later I received an email advising I would receive a response soon.Two days later I receive an email from a Tech stating they would overnight the body and expedite the repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,21,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,16,22,Don't know the Sony repair engineers assessed it as physically damaged.Gonna get it back, sell it for whatever I can get and swear never to buy a Sony product again!!!
B005IHAIMA,16,23,Immediately upon receiving my exhange I sent the body in for the click repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,24,Amazon was very good to me when I had to return once before (no strings), but if I had to do this now for clicking or suspicion, I'll have to pay for return shipment to Cameta.
B005IHAIMA,17,0,Having the two cameras set up differently means not having to fumble around trying to change menu settings btw auto and manual while on a shoot.
B005IHAIMA,17,1,After it focuses you can also manually fine-tune the focus to your object.
B005IHAIMA,17,2,The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.
B005IHAIMA,17,3,No auto ISR on Manual mode (some DSLR's will let you do this).Overall,
B005IHAIMA,17,4,I use my manual lenses on M or A modes, but have been using several of the scene modes where it will adjust shutter speed and ISO and other parameters to give you their scene shot.
B005IHAIMA,17,5,Manual adjustments....don't be scared....no problem.
B005IHAIMA,17,6,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,17,7,I then used the Right Key Setting on the rotary dial for White Balance, and the Soft Key B Setting for ISO.
B005IHAIMA,17,8,The controls are much better, allowing things like manual focus, manual exposure, etc.
B005IHAIMA,17,9,It's simple, just switch to the Menu mode and then select Brightness/Color and ISO setting is right there.
B005IHAIMA,17,10,On top of that the camera has no AutoISO in full manual mode and AutoISO is limited to 100-3200.On a DSLR this is less of a problem since it's very quick to switch between A/S modes when the lighting changes.
B005IHAIMA,17,11,Auto ISO is available as an option.
B005IHAIMA,17,12,The touch focusing and focus tracking are wonderful.One other thing that surprised me is how useful the intelligent auto setting has turned out.
B005IHAIMA,17,13,90% of my photos are in program mode so I don't even really adjust aperture or shutter.
B005IHAIMA,17,14,With the NEX-5N, I have to press Menu, scroll to Shoot Mode, scroll from iAuto to Program mode, press Menu again (because selecting another shooting mode kicks you out), select the Brightness/Color menu, scroll to DRO/Auto HDR option and select Auto HDR (or other DRO/HDR mode).
B005IHAIMA,17,15,I tested with kit lens taking the same photos in both auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,17,16,From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.
B005IHAIMA,17,17,I used 2 of these for ISO and White Balance.
B005IHAIMA,17,18,As someone who usually shoots in aperture priority or manual mode, I'm used to making all the exposure decisions for my photos.
B005IHAIMA,17,19,I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2.
B005IHAIMA,17,20,If you shoot manual focus lenses and/or in RAW mode, the C3 probably is sufficient.
B005IHAIMA,17,21,Auto focus is near perfect in good light, and very good in low light.Macro with the kit zoom, using menu setting "Camera - AF/MF - DMF".  can give some pretty nice shots, but you will need to stay 9-10" away with this lens to focus.
B005IHAIMA,17,22,With the Canon S95 point-and-shoot, I can switch from Auto to Scene mode through the mode dial and then select HDR option (if I left it in HDR mode then I don't even have to scroll and I've switched to HDR mode in the flick of a dial).
B005IHAIMA,17,23,It is obvious that the documentation that Sony provided with the camera was not designed for an experienced dSLR user but once I figured out where the shutter and aperture mode was on manual mode, it was very easy to set and use.On Manual Mode, the rotary dial controls the shutter setting.
B005IHAIMA,17,24,For most of us, there are only a few special settings that we change with any frequency.
B005IHAIMA,18,0,Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*
B005IHAIMA,18,1,(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,2,In shutter priority mode, it allows you to select shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,3,Very small lag on the shutter.
B005IHAIMA,18,4,I also noticed the same exact spots when is happened to use iso 100 and 1 second shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,5,Then, of course, you would like to change shutter speed, f/stop, and the ISO setting.
B005IHAIMA,18,6,It has made a world of difference in my speed of shooting.
B005IHAIMA,18,7,My 21YO said "I'm 21, I should be able to find all the settings within 5 seconds - if I can't, there's something wrong."
B005IHAIMA,18,8,This is untrue, of course, as the clicking problem occurs if you move the camera at all during video recording.
B005IHAIMA,18,9,It overheats  and turns off after about ten minutes of shooting 1080 video.
B005IHAIMA,18,10,The most important for me is that it does not have a mode that in I can shoot in RAW while having a minimum shutter of at least, say, 1/125s for shooting my kids activities.
B005IHAIMA,18,11,So we changed it to that setting and spent awhile trying to make faces while partially pressing the shutter.
B005IHAIMA,18,12,The manual focus on that is slightly noisier, and it shows up if recording video, but that is literally the only complaint I have for this camera.
B005IHAIMA,18,13,The first time I noticed it the iso was 3200.
B005IHAIMA,18,14,camera also overheats pretty easily when you're recording video.
B005IHAIMA,18,15,Most cameras have to use slow shutter speeds indoors in ambient light, because they just can't control noise and smear at ISO 800 and above.
B005IHAIMA,18,16,From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.
B005IHAIMA,18,17,Video is always in 16:9 ratio.ISO: The NEX-5N has ISO 100, and goes all the way to ISO 12,800.
B005IHAIMA,18,18,The Nikon D7000 shutter sounds sounds better despite having have to flip up the mirror before shutter release.
B005IHAIMA,18,19,Charging took about 4 hours (which is normal) and then the camera fired right up.You will be prompted to set the date & time right away and then you can start enjoying your new toy.When you turn the camera off, the shutter may operate.
B005IHAIMA,18,20,You may like to look for a good used Sony 16mm pancake lens, or a used 16-50 power zoom, as I did.B./
B005IHAIMA,18,21,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,18,22,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,18,23,I use my manual lenses on M or A modes, but have been using several of the scene modes where it will adjust shutter speed and ISO and other parameters to give you their scene shot.
B005IHAIMA,18,24,This sensitivity means you can shoot without flash much of the time, even indoors and in low light.
B005IHAIMA,19,0,They fix this in newer models with the universal horseshoe, but as long as you are just an average Joe who will just go with the included flash, it isn't a deal breaker.
B005IHAIMA,19,1,The following items were included along with the camera: warranty card, paper manual for the NEX-3/NEX-3C/NEX-5/NEX-5C, software disk, neck strap, usb cable, battery and charger and flash accessory with its respectable case.FIRST IMPRESSIONSI knew this camera was going to be small and compact, but when I took it out of its protective bag, it was even smaller than I anticipated.
B005IHAIMA,19,2,This Sony is no SD1000 in size, but I got a small Sony case for the Sony NEX-5N and it is never in the way.It works great with my Eye-Fi card.
B005IHAIMA,19,3,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,19,4,Using this with Eye-Fi card, battery last about 160-200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,19,5,Now that Sony has fixed it, it's a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,19,6,Attaching/swapping a mic or a flash requires quite long and annoying process.4.
B005IHAIMA,19,7,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,19,8,it can't be assessed as a cons but just compare photos few times and you can expect how they will differ on the computer screen.
B005IHAIMA,19,9,Wish I bought the one with built in wifi.
B005IHAIMA,19,10,Well, there is, but it's a Sony proprietary slot-thing that is a pain in the neck to work with in the field.
B005IHAIMA,19,11,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,19,12,the accessory flash from sony which is higher and can make bouncing is expenive (148 US$).
B005IHAIMA,19,13,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,19,14,I can either have a viewfinder of a flash on, not both.
B005IHAIMA,19,15,I got this with my sony card and it was expensive but worth every dime.
B005IHAIMA,19,16,You can buy third-party adapters, but those look a little unstable for mounting a big flash unit to the camera.
B005IHAIMA,19,17,Right now I try to take videos with an external mic so it's less of an issue.
B005IHAIMA,19,18,I must have mistaken this feature from some other camera I was researching.At this time, the only real negative I can find is the battery door.
B005IHAIMA,19,19,The only thing I did not like about the ordering experience is a representative called shortly after I placed my order online to try and sell an extra off-brand battery and memory card.
B005IHAIMA,19,20,But, the photos it took were okay when small, but not so good on a bigger computer screen.
B005IHAIMA,19,21,The compact size really made it easy for us to carry but the best thing was, it took great pictures even without the flash.
B005IHAIMA,19,22,I purchased a 3-d party (Wasabi) battery pack (two NP-FW50 batteries, one Wasabi AC charger, one car charger converter for Wasabi AC charger, European converter) which works well with my NEX-5N.
B005IHAIMA,19,23,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,19,24,Sony does sell a larger flash compatible with the NEX-3 and -5 series, which is quite a bit bigger than the included kit flash.
B005IHAIMA,20,0,Replaced my DSLR Canon Rebel XS with this Sony.
B005IHAIMA,20,1,Its a sony.
B005IHAIMA,20,2,I have owned Canon 40D, Canon 5D Mark ii, Canon T2i and so on...
B005IHAIMA,20,3,Thanks Sony, you make me look like a better photographer than I am!
B005IHAIMA,20,4,With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.
B005IHAIMA,20,5,I used this for well over year now, a lot, and I think it's great.
B005IHAIMA,20,6,Durability and good looks...its a Sony.
B005IHAIMA,20,7,The image quality would not disappoint even the professional.
B005IHAIMA,20,8,Compare it to your best Canon DSLR and see who wins.
B005IHAIMA,20,9,I love taking photos of the kiddies/family throughout the year.
B005IHAIMA,20,10,Although I do have some previous knoweledge and experience with DSLR cameras both digital and film.
B005IHAIMA,20,11,This was an upgrade from a Nikon P100 model.
B005IHAIMA,20,12,For about 10 years I have been using a digital P&S; as a second camera that I carry around.
B005IHAIMA,20,13,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,20,14,Since that camera, I've owned over 35 digital cameras and have witnessed the evolution of digital imaging, with great excitement, to the present day.All the while I've been waiting for the size and weight of digital SLR's to come down.
B005IHAIMA,20,15,I believe this type of cameras are the big trend -- SLR quality but no mechanical parts and the high price thereafter.
B005IHAIMA,20,16,I have been a Canon and Nikon DSLR owner for a long time.
B005IHAIMA,20,17,The zoom is okay but I don't have much to compare it to.
B005IHAIMA,20,18,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,20,19,This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings.
B005IHAIMA,20,20,I own a Canon 5DMKII and this camera produces images that compare with the results I get from the big Canon... highly recommended...
B005IHAIMA,20,21,That is pretty common for digital cameras, but still a little disappointing considering the price of this camera.
B005IHAIMA,20,22,I'm a long time Nikon user, going back over 40 years.
B005IHAIMA,20,23,I am not going to carry a bulky DSLR, and anyway, the quality of my Panasonic P&S; pics were fair enough - well, mostly.
B005IHAIMA,20,24,I upgraded my point and shoot to this Sony and couldn't be more pleased.
B005IHAIMA,21,0,Negatif yani ise lens portfoyunun zayif olmasi.
B005IHAIMA,21,1,By the way, the 18-55 len is a little heavy.
B005IHAIMA,21,2,Not exactly portable/pocket with the kit lens attached--you may have to get the 16mm pancake lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,3,To combat this, you need to hold the adapter or lens with your left hand.
B005IHAIMA,21,4,bought UV filter and Len cap string because the cap came without a string.Thanks all reviewers contribution, and thanks dpreview.com
B005IHAIMA,21,5,f/2.8 pancake prime lens: With a 35mm equivalent FOV of 24mm, it would have been nicer if this lens had a wider-opening aperture.
B005IHAIMA,21,6,camera shipped with kit lens attached to the body, so NO rear lens cap and NO body cap are supplied.
B005IHAIMA,21,7,I have yet to buy additional lenses, but plan on grabbing the larger zoon lens and the macro lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,8,But the Amazon ad for the camera and lens combo for the BLACK body shows it with a matching BLACK 18-55 lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,9,good price and item! very good pictures taken by this camera, I'll get other lens to shot special pictures.
B005IHAIMA,21,10,I cleaned the lens and sensor, but the spots remained.
B005IHAIMA,21,11,For this reason, it is inevitable and also advantageous to use one's dSLR lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.I am able to use my Nikon F-mount lenses on the NEX-5N through an adapter.
B005IHAIMA,21,12,I got the NEX-5N with 18-55mm lens, in 2 days with Amazon prime.
B005IHAIMA,21,13,I purchased the kit with the 18-55m lens and the camera takes flawless shots.
B005IHAIMA,21,14,In this manner, I have no problem using my bigger Nikkor F-mount prime and zoom lens with the NEX-5N such as the Nikkor 24-70mm f/2.8, Nikkor 180mm f/2.8 or Zeiss 100mm f/2.0 despite these lenses not having any dedicated lens collar.I have started testing the NEX-5N using my Nikkor lenses and comparing the image I captured using the same lens but mounted on the Nikon D7000.
B005IHAIMA,21,15,As of this review, the following are the available E-Mount lenses for purchase:16mm (SEL16F28); 24mm Zeiss (SEL25F18Z); 30mm Macro (SEL30M35; 50mm (SEL50F18); 18-55mm (SEL1855); 55-210mm (SEL55210); 18-200mm (SEL18200 & SEL18200LE); Sigma 19mm (400965); Sigma 30mm (330965); Tamron 18-200mm (AFB011-700 & AFB011S-700); Kenko 400mm (KE4008K4); Various fisheye lenses from Bower, Rokinon, Samyang, YasuharaSony is scheduled to release the following lenses within the next few months: 35mm (SEL35F18); 10-18mm (SEL1018); 16-50mm (SELP1650)My plan was to purchase the Sony 16-50mm (SAL1650) and the Sony 55-200mm (SAL55200-2) lenses, but the only problem was the 16-50mm lens is $800 new and the used ones on eBay were not offered by reputable sellers (BTW, the 55-200mm was going to be a temporary lens until I saved enough money for a Sony 70-300mm or 70-400mm G lens).Since the purchase of the 16-50mm lens, 55-200mm lens and LA-EA2 adapter would have set me back well over $1,000 I decided to do some more research for alternative lenses and ended up purchasing the Tamron 17-50mm (AF016M700) and the Tamron 70-300 (AFA005S-700).At first, I could not confirm that these lenses would work with the adapter, but was able to locate examples of people who had successfully paired these lenses with the adapter and NEX-5N camera.Also, at the time of purchase, Tamron offered a $75 MIR on the 17-50mm lens and a $100 MIR on the 70-300mm lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,16,After dragging an 18MP dSLR with 18-200 lens to Disneyland and taking only 200 shots.
B005IHAIMA,21,17,Mine came with a SILVER lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,18,With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,19,Body Only: $600Tamron 17-50mm: $425 (after $75 rebate)Tamron 70-300mm: $350 (after $100 rebate)Total: $1,375.00CONCLUSIONNeedless to say, I ended up returning the NEX-5N, 50mm lens and adapter.
B005IHAIMA,21,20,Despite being a pancake lens, this prime lens is big enough that it actually is wider than the NEX-5N both at the top and at the bottom.
B005IHAIMA,21,21,The adapter is almost as large as a Sony 16mm f/2.8 prime lens so using 3rd party lenses on the NEX-5N as I have done with my Nikkor lenses will result in a substantially bigger package than when using Sony's native designed for NEX E-mount lenses.The bigger package aside, I find it easy to manually focus my Nikkor lenses on the NEX-5N.
B005IHAIMA,21,22,Try finding an 18mm lens for a dSLR, it'll cost as much as the body itself.
B005IHAIMA,21,23,The only thing is that the lens cap has no string or anything, so I have to be careful where I put it and not leave it on the table or something.
B005IHAIMA,21,24,A dust cap was placed over the sensor opening for shipment, but otherwise, as far as I can tell nothing was done to it.
B005IHAIMA,22,0,It's very strongest plus is the high ISO image quality.
B005IHAIMA,22,1,Other than that, it is a great camera especially in low light.
B005IHAIMA,22,2,Picture quality is excellent especially low light pics.
B005IHAIMA,22,3,Good for still photo.
B005IHAIMA,22,4,I can't believe how good this thing is in low light conditions.
B005IHAIMA,22,5,Low light shots are amazing so far.
B005IHAIMA,22,6,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,22,7,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.
B005IHAIMA,22,8,Good job at high ISO (low light).Con:
B005IHAIMA,22,9,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,22,10,The quality of the low light shots is also great!
B005IHAIMA,22,11,A good travel companion: light, great low light performance, very good still photos.
B005IHAIMA,22,12,Still, you can get great shots at extremely low light with amazing color that was just not possible at this price range until now.The kit lens is good and much better than I expected based upon some of the reviews I read.
B005IHAIMA,22,13,In both cases, some delicate fine-tuning with noise reduction during post-processing will yield very good images still.
B005IHAIMA,22,14,Very good camera and a very good image.
B005IHAIMA,22,15,Small, light, high quality photo!
B005IHAIMA,22,16,Low light...no problem.
B005IHAIMA,22,17,I have been able to take low light shots, indoor, sunny outdoor, nighttime etc. without any issues.
B005IHAIMA,22,18,The first being that at higher ISO levels in low light there is a fair deal of noise.
B005IHAIMA,22,19,The NEX-5N to me is the camera that gives you the best of everything, it did in fact produce better OOC jpeg images than the 550d in some low light settings.
B005IHAIMA,22,20,Even at night with nothing but moon light.
B005IHAIMA,22,21,It performed much better than my other cameras, but I was not blown away.For standard indoor lighting, the Sony does do pretty well.
B005IHAIMA,22,22,The sensor quality is just as great as originally- Images have bite, but some may say that it is not Leica-like smudgey/creamy.
B005IHAIMA,22,23,I've taken inside shots at night with minimal ambient light, handheld with no flash at ISO setting 25,600 and they turned out very clear with minimal graininess.
B005IHAIMA,22,24,Also, it is very light in weight which helps.The color accuracy is very good.
B005IHAIMA,23,0,Too bad I have to return it to Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,1,You can bet that when I buy another camera, it will be from Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,2,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.
B005IHAIMA,23,3,I have returned the product.
B005IHAIMA,23,4,Overall, this really is a good product!
B005IHAIMA,23,5,Why the still sell this camera ???Don't buy it !
B005IHAIMA,23,6,Amazon was very good to me when I had to return once before (no strings), but if I had to do this now for clicking or suspicion, I'll have to pay for return shipment to Cameta.
B005IHAIMA,23,7,Still Clickin' I just bought this camera last week (Aug 1).
B005IHAIMA,23,8,I can't return the camera but I will return the 18-200 lens.
B005IHAIMA,23,9,I'm returning the camera to day to Best Buy.DO THE RIGHT THING SONY, RECALL YOUR DEFECTIVE CAMERA!DO THE RIGHT THING BEST BUY, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!DO THE RIGHT THING AMAZON, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!
B005IHAIMA,23,10,I just bought it two days ago and received it today.
B005IHAIMA,23,11,I dont want to play camera roulette when I want to buy a new product and waste my money and time guessing what will work.
B005IHAIMA,23,12,Why Is Amazon still selling defective models of this camera?
B005IHAIMA,23,13,Too bad because the camera itself is great.
B005IHAIMA,23,14,Don't buy this camera.
B005IHAIMA,23,15,UPDATE: 21 FEB 2012: Amazon appears to be looking into this issue now - I believe they are intercepting/checking my return to verify this problem.
B005IHAIMA,23,16,helped me made my final decision.Last year bought Panasonic FZ280 and Nikon 3100 end up returned them all and wait to last Christmas.
B005IHAIMA,23,17,Good for still photo.
B005IHAIMA,23,18,(Due to where I live I couldn't buy it on Amazon and get it shipped to me when I needed it by.)I've
B005IHAIMA,23,19,My 30 day return period would have expired by the time I returned to the USA, but I chatted online with Amazon support and they arranged for an extension of the return period until I got home.
B005IHAIMA,23,20,This puts me just 4 days of my return window with Amazon closing so I am forced to return the defective camera for refund.
B005IHAIMA,23,21,When I got back home, I decided to just get a replacement from Amazon, because I still liked the camera design and was hoping that I just had a lemon.
B005IHAIMA,23,22,I bought my NEX-5N from Amazon and it arrived promptly on 10/17/2012.
B005IHAIMA,23,23,I didn't pay $700 to get a defective camera that needed to be fixed.
B005IHAIMA,23,24,It was January 30, and I had one more day before Amazon's extended return period for the holidays ended.
B005IHAIMA,24,0,This change has made me more willing to learn and adopt to the different sets of controls in these cameras.
B005IHAIMA,24,1,With that being said, the touchscreen menu is rather fool/idiot-proof because there are instructions on each menu and even helpful tips on how that function would be useful.
B005IHAIMA,24,2,Full manual control is available if you're up to the task, or are just that persnickety.
B005IHAIMA,24,3,Touchscreen menu is not as confusing as some people said.
B005IHAIMA,24,4,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,24,5,Under the "Setup" Menu", one can proceed to the Custom Key Settings.
B005IHAIMA,24,6,This wheel delves deeper into the menu option for specific functions.
B005IHAIMA,24,7,With a quick button push and Sony's well thought out basic controls, I can quickly get to and change the settings I most often access.
B005IHAIMA,24,8,I like that you can set up to 5 menu items under a custom button and switch things fast.
B005IHAIMA,24,9,Having the two cameras set up differently means not having to fumble around trying to change menu settings btw auto and manual while on a shoot.
B005IHAIMA,24,10,It is obvious that the documentation that Sony provided with the camera was not designed for an experienced dSLR user but once I figured out where the shutter and aperture mode was on manual mode, it was very easy to set and use.On Manual Mode, the rotary dial controls the shutter setting.
B005IHAIMA,24,11,The help menu does really help with basic use of the camera.
B005IHAIMA,24,12,But don't expect miracles; you'll still have to learn some basics about photography, as I'm finding out.
B005IHAIMA,24,13,From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.
B005IHAIMA,24,14,Even though you can access most menu items through the physical dial and buttons, the touch screen works very fast.
B005IHAIMA,24,15,I only changed a few menu items from what dpreview.com
B005IHAIMA,24,16,What I don't like is since the menus are only accessible via the touchscreen, it is a fingerprint, sweat and dirt magnet.
B005IHAIMA,24,17,I didnt even get a users manual with mine and it only took me 20minutes to go through all the menus and adjust settings to my liking.
B005IHAIMA,24,18,The on screen functions take getting used to if you are already accustomed to a DSLR with analog wheels and buttons.
B005IHAIMA,24,19,You can set the controls to hot keys for easy access.
B005IHAIMA,24,20,Sony, if you read these Amazon reviews, please add the option to control shooting mode from the bottom-right button on the camera!
B005IHAIMA,24,21,My mindset is essentially that of learning and adopting to the different camera controls rather than one wanting to maintain a consistent set of controls among the different cameras.
B005IHAIMA,24,22,It's simple, just switch to the Menu mode and then select Brightness/Color and ISO setting is right there.
B005IHAIMA,24,23,The instruction manual details this.
B005IHAIMA,24,24,I use the Auto mode basically all the time.
B005IHAIMA,25,0,Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012.
B005IHAIMA,25,1,Video "clicking" noise issue fixed.
B005IHAIMA,25,2,The clicking is still an issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,3,DO NOT BUY UNTIL SONY ADDRESSES CLICKING ISSUE.
B005IHAIMA,25,4,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,25,5,M. F. Click issue is a big problem for this product.
B005IHAIMA,25,6,My next camera will probably be a Nikon or a Canon, from a company that actually takes pride in their cameras.
B005IHAIMA,25,7,I have to explain that the camera has already been sent in for that issue and that the problem is something else.
B005IHAIMA,25,8,I'm a long time Nikon user, going back over 40 years.
B005IHAIMA,25,9,No problems at 1080p/24fps.Only regret is we didn't buy this a year ago.PROS:Amazing picture and video quality.
B005IHAIMA,25,10,Don't buy this camera.
B005IHAIMA,25,11,Photos great, video sucks.
B005IHAIMA,25,12,Video defect is not the only problem.
B005IHAIMA,25,13,However...When the camera is released, the video clicking issues has been widely reported.
B005IHAIMA,25,14,Still has the click noise when shooting video.
B005IHAIMA,25,15,Sony is finally acknowledging the problem just not saying what it is and if the fix will completely fix the problem.
B005IHAIMA,25,16,I thought SONY has fixed the clicking noise problem in the most recent product.
B005IHAIMA,25,17,The key concern is the video "clicking" noise issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,18,After the long wait, you would think Sony has fixed the clicking issue and the defective ones are all depleted from the channels.
B005IHAIMA,25,19,I do not foresee this becoming an issue unless I use the NEX-5N as a salt shaker while taking video.
B005IHAIMA,25,20,In Sept. 2011, Sony has release an official statement that Sony will provide some video recording improvement for those affected NEX5Ns.(What
B005IHAIMA,25,21,This was an upgrade from a Nikon P100 model.
B005IHAIMA,25,22,A great camera for photographing, but not for video recording.
B005IHAIMA,25,23,There is an audio clicking problem for this new camera in video mode...
B005IHAIMA,25,24,Audio clicking problem in video mode.
B002IPHIEG,0,0,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,0,1,The battery has a decent life as well.
B002IPHIEG,0,2,I used it as soon as I got the battery charged - and that, the battery, is the only thing I can say is a slight negative.
B002IPHIEG,0,3,Battery life could be better.
B002IPHIEG,0,4,Battery life seems pretty good.So what's not to like about this camera?1.
B002IPHIEG,0,5,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,0,6,As soon as the battery charged, I started using the camera.
B002IPHIEG,0,7,Battery does not last as long as the old Sony I have (T-3 and T-30)2.
B002IPHIEG,0,8,Battery life is better than any other compact digital I have owned.
B002IPHIEG,0,9,battery life5.-touch
B002IPHIEG,0,10,The battery lasts super long.
B002IPHIEG,0,11,I love this camera, this is my second in four years....I dropped the first from my horse.....This camera has a great slim design that fits well into a pocket...it takes great pictures and the batteries last a long time.
B002IPHIEG,0,12,I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.
B002IPHIEG,0,13,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,0,14,We used it on our vacation to Washington DC and it and the battery would last all day.Well worth the investment.
B002IPHIEG,0,15,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,0,16,Long story short, outdoor pics were great, the camera size was excellent, and battery life was out of this world.
B002IPHIEG,0,17,Great little digital.
B002IPHIEG,0,18,Haven't shot any video.
B002IPHIEG,0,19,It is just there all the time.
B002IPHIEG,0,20,Only downside... battery only lasts about 80 minutes, but generics are cheap.
B002IPHIEG,0,21,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,0,22,It is very compact and portable and with a decent compact size.It has a decent battery life.
B002IPHIEG,0,23,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,0,24,I used to always buy Casio for my point and shoots, my SLR is also a NIKON but I've only heard great things about Sony from my friends only downside being the battery life so I made sure to buy an extra battery...apparently they've improved on that issue and the battery life has been fine.
B002IPHIEG,1,0,Screen delamination or is it moisture haze?
B002IPHIEG,1,1,Love the touch screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,2,The camera is all touch screen and is more of an iPod Touch feel to it.
B002IPHIEG,1,3,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.
B002IPHIEG,1,4,It also has a touch screen feature which I'm not so fond of.
B002IPHIEG,1,5,The touch screen is so easy to use and the camera fits anywhere.
B002IPHIEG,1,6,The screen gets smudged so easily.
B002IPHIEG,1,7,Some people might not like the touch screen, but it's actually quite easy to manipulate.
B002IPHIEG,1,8,That screen is easy to maneuver around.
B002IPHIEG,1,9,A perfect sized protector will slightly overlap the screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,10,The touch screen is very intuitive and responsive.
B002IPHIEG,1,11,The Large LCD screen is Spectacular as is the color in the photos.
B002IPHIEG,1,12,Great Little Camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,13,The touch screen is very sensitive.
B002IPHIEG,1,14,Remarkable, actually.The touch screen is easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,1,15,This is my first touch screen camera and I was hesitant.
B002IPHIEG,1,16,It is an Awesome camera that takes beautiful clear photos!! Great Close up, Great far away!!
B002IPHIEG,1,17,But, I'm really glad I have both of them because they each have some very positive features.UPDATE 7/20/12: From the beginning, the touch screen had an unusual look as if a screen protector was on it.
B002IPHIEG,1,18,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,1,19,When your shots look good on the view screen, they will be even more pleasing on a correctly calibrated HD monitor.2) The white balance options never seem to look right on the view screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,20,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,1,21,The important thing is to not touch the adhesive.
B002IPHIEG,1,22,However, due to the size, close-ups, video quality, and touch screen, I would recommend this camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,23,For all of my intents and purposes this camera is great, I really wanted a big screen, I wanted touchscreen and I wanted it small.
B002IPHIEG,1,24,I've found that it's best to make those decisions looking at the pictures at full size on a computer screen, rather than on the camera screen -- a shot that looks washed out or too bright on the camera screen is often perfect when seen on a larger monitor.
B002IPHIEG,2,0,Good but poor autofocus.
B002IPHIEG,2,1,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,2,2,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,2,3,Takes better pictures than any other camera I've owned.
B002IPHIEG,2,4,Also, I don't like that you have to be in 4:3 mode to get the full 10 mp but I think that's just an area of the picture issue (I love shooting in 16:9 . . .
B002IPHIEG,2,5,Suppose that can't be helped.
B002IPHIEG,2,6,This kills an otherwise great night-time camera.
B002IPHIEG,2,7,It just works.
B002IPHIEG,2,8,The subject was OK, but not tack sharp as what was hoped for.
B002IPHIEG,2,9,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,2,10,Oh and one more thing, don't tell me to just get a DSLR or it's just a P &S; - I know that already!
B002IPHIEG,2,11,Oh and one more thing, don't tell me to just get a DSLR or it's just a P &S; - I know that already!
B002IPHIEG,2,12,Even in auto mode, the Canon took consistently good pictures, important when handing your camera to someone to shoot your picture.
B002IPHIEG,2,13,Subject was four feet away, but the camera focused almost 6 feet away.
B002IPHIEG,2,14,The Canon has faster glass (f/2.0),
B002IPHIEG,2,15,It is really hard to take bad shots with this camera, and if you take the time to learn the benefits of the various modes, I am certain you will get great results too.I was also skeptical of getting the rather narrow range of the 35mm lens, thinking I would prefer the wider lens on the WX1 when it comes out next month, but the panorama mode is awesome so I don't miss having the wider lens.
B002IPHIEG,2,16,I haven't used this mode too much yet, hoping to get better at using it.
B002IPHIEG,2,17,(No kidding) The video feature is really awesome, and I believe it is better than most of the "cheap" video camera out there.
B002IPHIEG,2,18,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,2,19,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,2,20,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,2,21,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,2,22,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,2,23,Love it.
B002IPHIEG,2,24,A 3 star camera I've learned to love.
B002IPHIEG,3,0,Vedio quality is great as well.
B002IPHIEG,3,1,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,3,2,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,3,3,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,3,4,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,3,5,Overall is good.
B002IPHIEG,3,6,Oh, and the video quality is awesome as well.
B002IPHIEG,3,7,I use it for my blog and the picture quality and audio are great.
B002IPHIEG,3,8,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,9,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!
B002IPHIEG,3,10,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,3,11,There is static noise when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,3,12,The mono-microphone is pretty sensitive and provides a good sound quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,13,good features for the price.
B002IPHIEG,3,14,720p video, great audio quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,15,Sony DSC-TX1 is pretty good quality, and fun to use.
B002IPHIEG,3,16,Horrible picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,17,Better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,18,Otherwise this is a great little camera with nice features.
B002IPHIEG,3,19,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,3,20,Date Stamp is done with the PMB software.HD video quality is actually better than the DMC-ZS3 AVCHD-lite.
B002IPHIEG,3,21,The camera is great for the functionality, clear photos and movies and the price was right.
B002IPHIEG,3,22,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,23,Recording HD movie were also disappointing, when you are recording you can actually hear sound of zooming and focusing when you play them back.
B002IPHIEG,3,24,The video function works great but I wish I  had  a mike I could plug in for better sound.
B002IPHIEG,4,0,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,4,1,One stop shot!
B002IPHIEG,4,2,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,4,3,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,4,I'm strictly point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,4,5,It auto adjust to light so you always get great pictures.
B002IPHIEG,4,6,You need to know what mode to be in to get a good shot and, as an amateur, I am not always sure what to do.
B002IPHIEG,4,7,Vedio quality is great as well.
B002IPHIEG,4,8,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,9,If your looking for a quick easy point and shoot, this camera is for you.
B002IPHIEG,4,10,Overall is good.
B002IPHIEG,4,11,Best point and shoot available.
B002IPHIEG,4,12,It has an anti blur mode meaning that it shoots 5 shots and blends them into one to create one great picture.
B002IPHIEG,4,13,If you have low light though, it is capable of giving you some great shots.
B002IPHIEG,4,14,However, did you ever try looking at "no flash" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode?
B002IPHIEG,4,15,Great camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,16,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,4,17,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,18,Good night shots.240-degree
B002IPHIEG,4,19,an excellent point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,4,20,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,4,21,What shots I took!
B002IPHIEG,4,22,Decrease the EV setting by .07.
B002IPHIEG,4,23,I purchased this camera for the Panorama mode, and low light shooting.
B002IPHIEG,4,24,The auto feature is generally gives good result and if somebody is not satisfied with that it also has some very good scene settings as well.
B002IPHIEG,5,0,Its shot response more fast than I think.
B002IPHIEG,5,1,Easy to use, nice pictures, and it's very fast to focus and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,5,2,Focus is fast.
B002IPHIEG,5,3,I want a camera that I don't know is there, that I can whip out in 2 seconds to snap off a shot.
B002IPHIEG,5,4,What shots I took!
B002IPHIEG,5,5,It's easy to whip out and snap a shot when the moment is right.
B002IPHIEG,5,6,The processing time is fast, very fast.
B002IPHIEG,5,7,Maybe I wasn't doing it right but they didn't seem to help much.The best bet for action and fast moving subjects with this camera seems to be the burst mode, which rips off 10 shots one after another when the shutter is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,5,8,It takes pictures quickly, and the quality of the shots is usually excellent.
B002IPHIEG,5,9,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.
B002IPHIEG,5,10,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,5,11,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,5,12,The zoom is difficult to use it moves to fast.
B002IPHIEG,5,13,Shutter lag (time from pushing the shutter button until photo taken),is very low for a pocket camera.What's not so good:-Noise reduction smears details at ISO 400 and above.
B002IPHIEG,5,14,Great indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,5,15,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,5,16,If you could control the shutter (which you can't) you might be able to get this camera to better stop action.
B002IPHIEG,5,17,On the other hand a recent review of the upcoming S90 indicated that even with a fast lens and manual controls (allowing you to set the shutter) it wasn't fast enough for action, sports and kids.
B002IPHIEG,5,18,I replaced a Canon SD1400IS with this one, because I have two little kids, and needed a super fast focusing camera to keep from missing shots.
B002IPHIEG,5,19,The high speed mode is one of the best I have seen in a small digicam.
B002IPHIEG,5,20,About the video be sure and buy a fast chip if you want good video Sony pro duo is a bit to slow for action shots.
B002IPHIEG,5,21,See for yourself: [...].What's the point of the best picture quality you missed capturing the moment because of poor shutter lag?2) Excellent battery life.
B002IPHIEG,5,22,If your looking for a quick easy point and shoot, this camera is for you.
B002IPHIEG,5,23,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,5,24,It could have used some more zoom and people with large hands might find it hard to hold.
B002IPHIEG,6,0,Reformating memory stick is best done on computer.
B002IPHIEG,6,1,I haven't transferred them to the computer, but I don't show my pictures on my computer.
B002IPHIEG,6,2,Taking HD Video takes up so much space on the memory card.
B002IPHIEG,6,3,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,6,4,We do a lot of socializing and it's nice to have something easy to record the memories.
B002IPHIEG,6,5,Easy to download pictures and clear the photos from the camera.I bought extra memory and will purchase an extra battery for my cruise trip.The only cons I have noticed so far :  Wish it had a more powerful zoom.
B002IPHIEG,6,6,But, if you take movies you have to locate the subdirectory on the memory card and access that directly.
B002IPHIEG,6,7,Use MS Windows software for downloading.Overall: I am happy with purchase.
B002IPHIEG,6,8,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,6,9,I bought an 8 gig card for it and it seems adequate so far.This is a great product that has really worked well for me.
B002IPHIEG,6,10,need a bigger memory.
B002IPHIEG,6,11,It has an anti-blur mode which is awesome indoors without a flash.
B002IPHIEG,6,12,You can upgrade your video card, but that is expensive and doesn't even work that well.
B002IPHIEG,6,13,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,6,14,The indoor shots seem pretty good (I'm still working on this.
B002IPHIEG,6,15,I thought before buying that this would just be easier than stiching the photos on my computer.
B002IPHIEG,6,16,I finally realize that SMALL is not so good when I buy a camera.
B002IPHIEG,6,17,Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.
B002IPHIEG,6,18,Be prepared to download to the computer, or a portable computer drive that stores a lot of gigs.
B002IPHIEG,6,19,As a bonus, you can zoom while recording video.There's drawbacks, of course - Sony's continued, stubborn insistence on Memory Stick is irksome, but honestly, I don't move memory cards around much.
B002IPHIEG,6,20,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,6,21,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.
B002IPHIEG,6,22,However, it is very easy to use and the instruction booklet is great.
B002IPHIEG,6,23,Great Little Camera.
B002IPHIEG,6,24,The memory stick duo is what Sony uses; save to an external hard drive (you're going to need one either for the quantity of VGA photos or the memory required to store all your 10.2 megapixel treasures) and re-use to bring down your expenses if the price differential with other media is such a big factor.
B002IPHIEG,7,0,Great Little Pocket Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,1,Great
B002IPHIEG,7,2,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,3,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,7,4,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,7,5,Great little digital.
B002IPHIEG,7,6,Great pocket camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,7,Great camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,8,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,7,9,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,10,Very small (fits in a pocket) and very easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,7,11,This Sony camera is a great small portable digital camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,12,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,7,13,Great Pocket Camera With A Little Tinkering.
B002IPHIEG,7,14,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,15,Best compact digital camera I've owned so far!
B002IPHIEG,7,16,I had wanted a small pocket camera for those times when I wanted to just slip a camera in my pocket for those unplanned photo opts.
B002IPHIEG,7,17,This is a great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,18,Overall, best digital camera I have used.
B002IPHIEG,7,19,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,7,20,Very good pocket camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,21,I was looking for better zoom while still maintaining the compact feel.
B002IPHIEG,7,22,This is a very very nice pocket camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,23,Excellent buy for its price; a really good little camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,24,The camera size is perfect for carrying in your pack or cargo pocket (it's a little large for reg.
B002IPHIEG,8,0,Another good Sony camera.
B002IPHIEG,8,1,The image quality is not going to be as good as a larger camera with a non-folded lens system and a bigger sensor.
B002IPHIEG,8,2,As a former owner of a Sony A700 with 16-80mm Carl z lenses, plus a whole bag of long range lenses.
B002IPHIEG,8,3,Contrary to some reviews, the image quality has been oustanding.
B002IPHIEG,8,4,I would like to thank my boss who pushed me to buy this 24mm wide angle lense camera.Panoramic feature is also great.
B002IPHIEG,8,5,This is my third Sony camera.
B002IPHIEG,8,6,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,8,7,Good Camera- 24mm wide angle is amazing.
B002IPHIEG,8,8,Light and small for the lens range.3)
B002IPHIEG,8,9,If that's what you're after, you really should buy a DSLR.
B002IPHIEG,8,10,Great size, good-to-great performance.
B002IPHIEG,8,11,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,8,12,Lens distortion is amazingly low, even at wide angle.+
B002IPHIEG,8,13,Taking a picture with the camera turned sideways to better frame a specific shot shows a lot of distortion from the wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,8,14,I love this camera!GREAT THINGS about this: The slim design with a built-in cover to protect the lens instead of needing a lens cap is great.
B002IPHIEG,8,15,They're much bigger, but the image quality is unmatched.The real reason to buy this camera is to take pictures that you wouldn't take otherwise.
B002IPHIEG,8,16,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,8,17,The low light capability was good, but not that much better than my Sony H20.
B002IPHIEG,8,18,Dealing with toting all that stuff around, cleaning lenses, I finally got sick of it and sold everything on eBay and bought this camera, sure the image quality will never touch the A700 DSLR but I find the joy of photography is having a camera always with you.
B002IPHIEG,8,19,Former DSLR owner.
B002IPHIEG,8,20,It does take better photos in low light, but overall picture quality for an amateur user isn't that great.
B002IPHIEG,8,21,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,8,22,They both work well, though the results are even better if you brace the camera somehow instead of shooting totally freehand.
B002IPHIEG,8,23,It is so much better than the cameras that have the protruding lens that extends when open.
B002IPHIEG,8,24,Perhaps we may get to see interchangeable lenses on future compact cameras.
B002IPHIEG,9,0,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,9,1,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,9,2,Contrary to some reviews, the image quality has been oustanding.
B002IPHIEG,9,3,It is excellent in low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,4,small but wish it better low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,5,If you have low light though, it is capable of giving you some great shots.
B002IPHIEG,9,6,It was NOT good at all.
B002IPHIEG,9,7,The low light capability was good, but not that much better than my Sony H20.
B002IPHIEG,9,8,Photo quality under poor light conditions is amazing; photos are better than expected.
B002IPHIEG,9,9,Excellent low lighting performance.
B002IPHIEG,9,10,The big disappointmet was the bright light image quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,11,Took great pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,12,Love the low light feature.
B002IPHIEG,9,13,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,9,14,No, the quality of the photos is not in the league of the larger camera.
B002IPHIEG,9,15,The colors and lighting in the videos are excellent.
B002IPHIEG,9,16,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,9,17,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,9,18,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,9,19,Excellent pictures with the right lighting.
B002IPHIEG,9,20,Picture quality is better than I have had on past cameras, and come out pretty well.
B002IPHIEG,9,21,Great indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,22,It's been said that these new optics have TWICE the low light quality as the previous cameras.
B002IPHIEG,9,23,Besides the obvious use as seen in the ads, it works extraordinarily well in low light, and even outdoors at dusk.
B002IPHIEG,9,24,Especially impressive was the low light performance.
B002IPHIEG,10,0,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,10,1,Great Camera for price.
B002IPHIEG,10,2,Elegant looking camera, love it!
B002IPHIEG,10,3,Excellent buy for its price; a really good little camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,4,she loves it.
B002IPHIEG,10,5,I have had this camera for a little over a year.
B002IPHIEG,10,6,Purchased in May 2011.
B002IPHIEG,10,7,So far, it is working great for me.
B002IPHIEG,10,8,I LOVED it!
B002IPHIEG,10,9,For the price the camera is defiantly worth it i recommend it 100%
B002IPHIEG,10,10,Love it.
B002IPHIEG,10,11,He got it about 2 years ago for $300+.
B002IPHIEG,10,12,Such a great camera!
B002IPHIEG,10,13,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,10,14,A great camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,15,Just purchased this camera few days ago and I'm absolutely happy with it..
B002IPHIEG,10,16,I bought this camera a little over a year ago as a Christmas present for my girlfriend.
B002IPHIEG,10,17,not easy making a 16 year old happy, but this does it.
B002IPHIEG,10,18,I love the camera, unfortunately I returned it, because it had a lot of scratches, next time I'll buy a new one.
B002IPHIEG,10,19,Highly recommend this product.
B002IPHIEG,10,20,Very happy with the purchase.
B002IPHIEG,10,21,Having faith and loyalty in the Canon brand (this was our 4th Canon Camera purchase, two of which were Canon AE-1s given as gifts) I contacted Canon and was sorely disappointed.
B002IPHIEG,10,22,I am so glad that I Bought this camera!!
B002IPHIEG,10,23,Gotta Love It.
B002IPHIEG,10,24,The price is somewhat high, but I guess that's what always happens with the hottest new camera model of the year.
B002IPHIEG,11,0,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,1,A great camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,2,Great features, simple and easy to use settings.
B002IPHIEG,11,3,Very easy to use and great options!
B002IPHIEG,11,4,Easy to use2.-
B002IPHIEG,11,5,Great Little Camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,6,However, it is very easy to use and the instruction booklet is great.
B002IPHIEG,11,7,Really good camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,8,Such a great camera!
B002IPHIEG,11,9,It has great quality picutres, easy to use, fast, etc!
B002IPHIEG,11,10,So far, it is working great for me.
B002IPHIEG,11,11,Great size and lots of features.
B002IPHIEG,11,12,The camera is easy to use, not too many buttons that you'll never use.
B002IPHIEG,11,13,It is very intuitive, and easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,11,14,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,11,15,This is a great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,16,I'm not a techno wizard, but this camera is pretty easy to use (I do suggest reading the manual because the camera has lots of cool functions) and the photo quality is great.
B002IPHIEG,11,17,It is also intuitive and easy to use the advanced functions without much of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,11,18,The screen is about as easy to navigate as you could ask for.
B002IPHIEG,11,19,Very easy to use once you get into it.-
B002IPHIEG,11,20,Great little digital.
B002IPHIEG,11,21,Easy to use.Panoramic feature is incredible easy to use  and has an astonishing result.Sharp image.Light and small.
B002IPHIEG,11,22,This kills an otherwise great night-time camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,23,The controls are pretty intuitive and easy for an amateur like me to figure out.
B002IPHIEG,11,24,I found it amazingly easy to use with just that little bit of reading.
B002IPHIEG,12,0,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,12,1,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,12,2,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,12,3,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,12,4,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,12,5,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!
B002IPHIEG,12,6,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,12,7,great camera.
B002IPHIEG,12,8,The video quality is excellent.
B002IPHIEG,12,9,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,12,10,The video quality is exceptional for a camera of this size as well.
B002IPHIEG,12,11,Such a great camera!
B002IPHIEG,12,12,The Panorama features, HD video, and other features make this a no brainer.
B002IPHIEG,12,13,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,12,14,I have had it for about a month now and love taking pics and video.
B002IPHIEG,12,15,HD Video.
B002IPHIEG,12,16,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,12,17,I need to educate myself on this...being able to edit and play with the HD video files.
B002IPHIEG,12,18,Haven't shot any video.
B002IPHIEG,12,19,Date Stamp is done with the PMB software.HD video quality is actually better than the DMC-ZS3 AVCHD-lite.
B002IPHIEG,12,20,It was NOT good at all.
B002IPHIEG,12,21,Sony did a great job on this camera.
B002IPHIEG,12,22,It seems all my video files are HUGE.
B002IPHIEG,12,23,Great size and lots of features.
B002IPHIEG,12,24,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,13,0,It did this with the battery that came with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,13,1,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,13,2,It is not unusual to go through two batteries in an hour or two, even when they are fully charged.
B002IPHIEG,13,3,It's been in a drawer for some time now.
B002IPHIEG,13,4,battery life5.-touch
B002IPHIEG,13,5,Bought the camera and just before one year, the battery cover door broke -not due to mistreating-.
B002IPHIEG,13,6,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,7,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,13,8,battery cover can break in one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,9,The battery door is flimsy.-Hard
B002IPHIEG,13,10,If I had it to do over, I would not buy a camera with a touchscreen.One other thing--this thing eats batteries.
B002IPHIEG,13,11,Its great if you want Non-Flash photos and are frequently turning the camera off/on in between shots.BAD- Battery Cover - The battery cover seems very flimsy and bows a bit if you hold the camera by it.
B002IPHIEG,13,12,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,13,13,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,13,14,Had this camera for about a month now - its a fine camera and has the usual settings/functions as mentioned by others.
B002IPHIEG,13,15,Now the camera powers on and stays on.Unfortunately, my problems were not over.
B002IPHIEG,13,16,It didn't last long.
B002IPHIEG,13,17,I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.
B002IPHIEG,13,18,Battery door easily opened.
B002IPHIEG,13,19,Manufacturer warranty only good for one year) the camera began failing in multiple ways.I'd power the camera on and immediately a message would pop up indicating that I needed to use a compatible battery, then would power off.
B002IPHIEG,13,20,Once I finally got a battery that functioned again, I found that the shutter would no longer open/close properly.
B002IPHIEG,13,21,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,13,22,Quick and once you get use to the touch screen easy to use! Just took this pocket rocket to San Diego on a trip and it turned out some very good shots in low light and regular day time lighting.
B002IPHIEG,13,23,Easy to download pictures and clear the photos from the camera.I bought extra memory and will purchase an extra battery for my cruise trip.The only cons I have noticed so far :  Wish it had a more powerful zoom.
B002IPHIEG,13,24,As soon as the battery charged, I started using the camera.
B002IPHIEG,14,0,The LCD screen is adjustable todeal with the brightness of the environment.
B002IPHIEG,14,1,That screen is easy to maneuver around.
B002IPHIEG,14,2,No bevel to the LCD frame.
B002IPHIEG,14,3,The only bad point I have found....is sometimes I hit the touch screen when I am taking the picture and this changes my setting.
B002IPHIEG,14,4,The Sony "touch screen" only gets a 3 rating.
B002IPHIEG,14,5,Translated to small point and shoot cameras, it's almost impossible for an older pair of eyes to clearly see what's on a 2.7 or 3 inch LCD screen on the back of camera, even if bright sun isn't washing out the screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,6,Being touch screen, it is a different excitement.
B002IPHIEG,14,7,It should have a viewfinder a bit hard to see in direct sunlight.
B002IPHIEG,14,8,Those can pose some problems when they open when they shouldn't (like in your pocket).The large touch screen makes everything easy.
B002IPHIEG,14,9,The LCD screen is bright, and high quality.. but its smaller.. and the menu system seems cluttered and annoyingly thought out.
B002IPHIEG,14,10,But the Touch Screen drove me crazy.
B002IPHIEG,14,11,Most of the time with the WX1 I really can't make out what's on the screen, because to me its all out of focus (the problem is my eyes, not the camera).
B002IPHIEG,14,12,If the camera has trouble focusing you simply touch the screen where you want it to focus and it focuses on that spot.
B002IPHIEG,14,13,Durability  First day I severely scratched the screen on the metal rivet putting it in or taking it out of my jeans pocket a camera this small should be designed to be put in a pocket.3.
B002IPHIEG,14,14,Display failed after 2 months.
B002IPHIEG,14,15,With finger swipes you can view new photos, even draw on photos using your finger or the included stylus.
B002IPHIEG,14,16,This annoyed me as iAUTO couldn't get it right all the time, and I'd miss shots of a 2yr old trying to change setting on the touch screen, which kinda sucks as it gets so dirty from oily fingers.I'm waiting for the new Canon SX210 IS - much higher zoom, likely HD as-good as SONY, wide angle lens and larger 3" screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,17,Quick and once you get use to the touch screen easy to use! Just took this pocket rocket to San Diego on a trip and it turned out some very good shots in low light and regular day time lighting.
B002IPHIEG,14,18,I hoped I helped you in some way.
B002IPHIEG,14,19,It works, but you need to have nimble fingers and if you've used an iPhone/iPod you'll be disappointed in Sony.
B002IPHIEG,14,20,And then 2-3 weeks ago when I turned it on the display started "going all white" -- first in stripes and then full-screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,21,I've had a couple cameras like this and the clear plastic gets scratched quickly.
B002IPHIEG,14,22,The big disappointmet was the bright light image quality.
B002IPHIEG,14,23,When your shots look good on the view screen, they will be even more pleasing on a correctly calibrated HD monitor.2) The white balance options never seem to look right on the view screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,24,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,15,0,No problems encountered so far.
B002IPHIEG,15,1,Most of the time with the WX1 I really can't make out what's on the screen, because to me its all out of focus (the problem is my eyes, not the camera).
B002IPHIEG,15,2,It also turned out that with the DRO turned off, many of the problems with the IQ of daytime shots were addressed.
B002IPHIEG,15,3,It's not a HUGE difference, but it was noticeable when shooting.So for whatever reason the video does NOT benefit from the new low light lens system.
B002IPHIEG,15,4,In case you're wondering, it never went back to Amazon although I do wonder if I might regret not having waited for the Canon S90 when that arrives.You can find some test shots I took here: [...]
B002IPHIEG,15,5,It turned out that the the problem was that in one case (the no greater than 800 case), the DRO was on.
B002IPHIEG,15,6,When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked.
B002IPHIEG,15,7,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,15,8,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,15,9,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,15,10,All I got were very blurry pictures which was a huge disappointment after never having this problem in the past.
B002IPHIEG,15,11,Even the low light pictures don't seem to have a noise problem.
B002IPHIEG,15,12,I would say, and this may be a mark against it for many people, that the WX1 is not a "point and shoot" camera unless one is familiar with its workings, but when I read the negative comments I wonder if some of the issues complained of could be addressed through a better understanding of the camera.
B002IPHIEG,15,13,Though I'd read, while this camera is a star as a point and shoot for low light, its daytime shots, or shots in artifical light, were not good.
B002IPHIEG,15,14,Photos were posted that looked really bad.
B002IPHIEG,15,15,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,15,16,The only slow operation is changing to View mode just after taking a picture, which takes 1-2s.However, there's a big fat problem with the WX1:  manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,15,17,It's a great pocket camera and it seems to have conquered the low light issues, to a point at least.
B002IPHIEG,15,18,It's been said that these new optics have TWICE the low light quality as the previous cameras.
B002IPHIEG,15,19,Not a real upgrade from DSC-T900.
B002IPHIEG,15,20,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,15,21,The indoor shots seem pretty good (I'm still working on this.
B002IPHIEG,15,22,If they're anything like me, they have a hard time reading a restaurant menu in dim light, or for that matter anything else a few feet from their face without reading glasses.
B002IPHIEG,15,23,Someone else said that they had no problem shooting at higher speeds in that setting.
B002IPHIEG,15,24,About the video be sure and buy a fast chip if you want good video Sony pro duo is a bit to slow for action shots.
B002IPHIEG,16,0,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,16,1,Sony repaired the damage under the warranty and not cost at all.
B002IPHIEG,16,2,Great customer service.
B002IPHIEG,16,3,I took it to my local camera shop to see if they could fix it, but all they do is send it in to Sony to have them repair it (for $260!).
B002IPHIEG,16,4,They asked for US$400 to repair a tiny door.I am very disappointed for the customer support from Sony.
B002IPHIEG,16,5,They suggested I contact Sony (I didn't buy the camera from them).
B002IPHIEG,16,6,Sony said they would repair the camera but that means shipping, waiting, and considerable trouble.
B002IPHIEG,16,7,So of course there is no reliable way to take photos and certainly no way to review photos.I called Amazon.com this morning and the customer service representative told me I had to call Sony.I visited the Sony website, entered my information, and was given instructions to ship the camera back to Sony (at my expense) for free warranty repair (luckily it was within the 90 day window).I've owned Canon digital cameras for 7 years and never had a hardware failure in the first three months like this.
B002IPHIEG,16,8,And, when directed to the service website to make a repair request, that malfunctioned too.
B002IPHIEG,16,9,So why am I reviewing a camera that seems like a downgrade?Well Sony is using a new lens system called the "Exmor R".
B002IPHIEG,16,10,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,16,11,If not, make sure you check it before your 30 day return option expires
B002IPHIEG,16,12,I found the following message in Sony's online repair area: The cost to repair this unit under our Flat Rate Program is $211.00,
B002IPHIEG,16,13,I was very impressed that I ordered the camera on a Saturday, it was shipped out the same day and at my house on Tuesday...great service...thank you!!!
B002IPHIEG,16,14,Had High Hopes - Defective Product.
B002IPHIEG,16,15,Did anyone at Sony even take this camera out for a night before shipping it?-
B002IPHIEG,16,16,I reported the problem 32 days after buying so I was out of luck with the retailer.
B002IPHIEG,16,17,Fortunately, when returning to P you'll find your settings have returned.
B002IPHIEG,16,18,I requested for the package to be left at my door with no signature so the shipping company called me within a few minutes to ensure that he would take care of this and gave me his cell phone number in case I needed it.
B002IPHIEG,16,19,Return shipping is included in this price.
B002IPHIEG,16,20,You have to package the camera yourself and ship it to Texas for several weeks with no replacement in the interim.
B002IPHIEG,16,21,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.
B002IPHIEG,16,22,I love the camera, unfortunately I returned it, because it had a lot of scratches, next time I'll buy a new one.
B002IPHIEG,16,23,It works, but you need to have nimble fingers and if you've used an iPhone/iPod you'll be disappointed in Sony.
B002IPHIEG,16,24,battery cover can break in one year.
B002IPHIEG,17,0,However, did you ever try looking at "no flash" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode?
B002IPHIEG,17,1,settings adjustments for color hues, saturation.-No
B002IPHIEG,17,2,They looked better if I manually set the ISO, but if I'm just pulling it out for a quick shot, i don't want to have to remember to go to manual settings all the time.
B002IPHIEG,17,3,This one is always blurry, nomatter the mode.
B002IPHIEG,17,4,I highly recommend taking picture in the P mode with white balance set to flash.
B002IPHIEG,17,5,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,17,6,Yeah, turning on the FLASH white balance for outdoor photos (which makes no sense by the way) --SOMETIMES-- does make the normally blueish outdoor photos look more pleasingly orangeish if you can remember to make this cryptic change or use P mode for your outdoor photos.
B002IPHIEG,17,7,Someone else said that they had no problem shooting at higher speeds in that setting.
B002IPHIEG,17,8,When setting on "P" mode I found out that switching the White Balance from "Auto" or "Daylight" to "Flash" in improves outdoor photos color, tone, exposure and warmness.
B002IPHIEG,17,9,I know I can always get into manual modes to compensate for things, but I wanted something I didn't always have to do that with.
B002IPHIEG,17,10,You might also want to try different White Balances,setting correctly results in really nice low light shots.Outdoor shots:This camera in iSCN mode seems to keep the lens all the way open(F2.4)and it adjusts the shutter speed(a big No No)resulting in washed out over exposed photos(yuck).The solution: switch to "P" Mode which closes down the lens to around a nice F5.0 to F7.1(much better) and switch the White Balance to "Flash" .
B002IPHIEG,17,11,It's pretty good, WITH THE RIGHT SETTINGS.
B002IPHIEG,17,12,Switching to any other mode defaults the settings to the terrible AUTO everything requiring the photographer to reset all those undesirable Sony auto settings.
B002IPHIEG,17,13,The reason it is not a point and shoot is because auto exposure is just wrong.
B002IPHIEG,17,14,Within those photos I have found out the best settings for the right scenes and conditions.
B002IPHIEG,17,15,You may need to set the EV to -.3=>-.7 for less contrasty scenes.
B002IPHIEG,17,16,You have to switch the camera to Handheld Twilight mode and adjust the Exposure Value(EV) from -0.3 to -1.7(this is a very important setting that needs to be set on order to remove the noisyness and grain from the photo, a setting people don't adjust and then complain about how bad the photo looks in low light).
B002IPHIEG,17,17,Yes, you are slightly more likely to get a better photo in the dark if you really need to take photos in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,17,18,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,17,19,I had a very hard time to find a right mode to take pictures with a very bright white light at night.However, overall this camera is good.
B002IPHIEG,17,20,Fortunately, P with some of the white balance settings used after experimentation will get you great shots.3)
B002IPHIEG,17,21,It's been in a drawer for some time now.
B002IPHIEG,17,22,UPDATE: I just found out today that a White Balance setting might be the key to this camera for outdoor shots.
B002IPHIEG,17,23,Took shots at the same time from the same distances with the same lighting, both left on automatic.
B002IPHIEG,17,24,I sometimes dont even need to use the flash!! yes sometimes you don't need the flash at night! it's perfect for night shootings..I only wish it has a button to switch from picture shooting to video... here you have to do it through the touch screen and it needs 2 clicks to switch..by the way the touch screen works wekk..
B002IPHIEG,18,0,4) Reviewing photos after a shot ... is too slow.
B002IPHIEG,18,1,3) Most importantly for me, the shutter does not click fast enough.
B002IPHIEG,18,2,Instead it takes ... 3 to 5 seconds because you have to wait for the current photo to be processed and then wait wait wait to press the review button and if you press it twice ... oops, your still in picture-taking mode.
B002IPHIEG,18,3,I know that folks will say that I must have pressed the wrong button, and that might be so at times.
B002IPHIEG,18,4,When taking shutter speed it takes a while to recording and process it to save it and show up on camera.
B002IPHIEG,18,5,Taking pictures with this camera is so much fun.Because it is so thin and light, pressing the shutter release button without adding shake to the shot takes a very steady hand.
B002IPHIEG,18,6,Being an SLR user, I am used to instant reaction speed between the moment I press the button and the moment the shutter clicks.
B002IPHIEG,18,7,The processing time is fast, very fast.
B002IPHIEG,18,8,Surely, the last photo can be put into a memory buffer to immediately be shown when the review button is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,18,9,I rather prefer to use the 2-second timer, which gives me just enough time after pressing the button to steady up the focus frame on my subject.
B002IPHIEG,18,10,I would buy it again.I would ask SONY to change a few things: 1) The power and shutter buttons are too flush and difficult to feel in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,18,11,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.
B002IPHIEG,18,12,There are many problems however:1.
B002IPHIEG,18,13,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,18,14,So much movement occurs by the subject in the 1 to 4 seconds (depending on lighting) it takes the shutter to click on this Cybershot.
B002IPHIEG,18,15,For example: FOUR button pushes to delete a shot you just took.Sadly, I won't be keeping this thing.
B002IPHIEG,18,16,I do a lot of shooting under pressure.
B002IPHIEG,18,17,I dont know if its my camera but this camera kinda sucks at recording, becuz whenever i record it makes a sound in the background recording and its really annoying.
B002IPHIEG,18,18,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,18,19,Shadows and low light shots even with flash end up RED!- (minor) Placement of on/off button is too far left for one-handed turning on/off.-
B002IPHIEG,18,20,The only slow operation is changing to View mode just after taking a picture, which takes 1-2s.However, there's a big fat problem with the WX1:  manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,18,21,I tested out tha image quality on the shutter speed,its ok but still kinda blurs when taking it, same with Pandoroma sweep.
B002IPHIEG,18,22,I like this camera but the only thing I dont like about it, is that the sensor light the redish-orangish light bothers me.
B002IPHIEG,18,23,Maybe I wasn't doing it right but they didn't seem to help much.The best bet for action and fast moving subjects with this camera seems to be the burst mode, which rips off 10 shots one after another when the shutter is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,18,24,On the other hand a recent review of the upcoming S90 indicated that even with a fast lens and manual controls (allowing you to set the shutter) it wasn't fast enough for action, sports and kids.
B002IPHIEG,19,0,With the card (which does not come included) and the camera, it runs up to $450.
B002IPHIEG,19,1,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,19,2,Newer models can use either a Sony card or SD card.
B002IPHIEG,19,3,(it's really ugly)No USB Charging.
B002IPHIEG,19,4,I am also annoyed that you have to purchase Sony's licensed memory card.
B002IPHIEG,19,5,Since my other cameras have been Sony cameras, I have already had memory stick cards and readers, so to me, its not a big deal.
B002IPHIEG,19,6,No HDMI.Expensive Memory Stick Duo.
B002IPHIEG,19,7,Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.
B002IPHIEG,19,8,It's annoying that it only takes the proprietary (and expensive) Sony memory stick instead of the usual SD card that all my other cameras have used, but that's not too big a deal.
B002IPHIEG,19,9,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.
B002IPHIEG,19,10,Tell me what will you do when you want to move pictures from your camera to your computer on the fly, you will need the 10 meter long 10 plug Sony proprietary cable, how about taking the memory card out, oh, that's another proprietary memory stick duo, now how to charge it?
B002IPHIEG,19,11,No standard USB connection.
B002IPHIEG,19,12,The biggest problem I've had is the USB connection - the plug on the camera end has always seemed a little wobbly and unstable, and over time it stopped connecting at all.
B002IPHIEG,19,13,This model has to have Sony card.
B002IPHIEG,19,14,There are some quirks with this camera which I wanted to point out.GOOD- Photo Quality - Others cover this so I wont go into it, but basically the photos are very good.BAD- Sony USB Cable - This is proprietary SONY cable, so you have to carry it around with you if you want to download photos from the directly from the camera without removing the Memory Stick.
B002IPHIEG,19,15,Internal Memory.
B002IPHIEG,19,16,Battery has to be taken out and charged externally, i prefer the ones which can be charged through usb therefore allowing you to copy photos while also charging the camera.
B002IPHIEG,19,17,Interface to computer - dedicated cable I have to bring with me on vacation, or a usb sd card reader?
B002IPHIEG,19,18,Its NOT one of those universal mini-USB/USB cables like you can use on Canons.
B002IPHIEG,19,19,The SONY Cable also has Video/Audio connectors, so its a bulky cable.GOOD- Flash Setting - Unlike most Canon's I have had you can turn OFF the flash and it stays off after turning the camera off/on again.
B002IPHIEG,19,20,My only negative is it didn't have a Memory Stick included.The battery doesn't last as long as the T100.
B002IPHIEG,19,21,Incidentally, the newest duo "pro" cards are not compatible with some older readers even if they accommodate Sony cards.... go figure.4)
B002IPHIEG,19,22,I had high hopes for this Sony, and even went to the trouble of buying a 16GB Memory Stick Duo (hate their proprietary attitude) and an extra battery.
B002IPHIEG,19,23,The only thing is that it is not supplied with a HDMI cable as standard..........
B002IPHIEG,19,24,If you have had other cameras that used SD, just think of making a $20 investment into a very reliable, fast card for your camera, and use the SD card in your Wii.The only two complaints I have for this camera are it's low light picture taking, and the format it uses when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,20,0,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,20,1,not much better than my seven year old Sony DSC-T30.
B002IPHIEG,20,2,Our last camera was a canon Powershot S2 IS.
B002IPHIEG,20,3,I was in the market for point and shoot digital.
B002IPHIEG,20,4,My last four digital cameras were all Canon, and i was happy with them.
B002IPHIEG,20,5,Best Point & Shoot Digital Camera I Ever Got ;) SONY TX1.
B002IPHIEG,20,6,nothing better.
B002IPHIEG,20,7,Our 5 year old camera shoots pictures that are much better and sharp.
B002IPHIEG,20,8,I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon.
B002IPHIEG,20,9,The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90.
B002IPHIEG,20,10,Sony DSC-WX1 , A disappointing Camera.
B002IPHIEG,20,11,I bought the TX1 after using a borrowed one and comparing it to Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, and the newest compact Sonys: TX100, TX7, T110.
B002IPHIEG,20,12,I am replacing a Cannon with only 3.1 megapixels and this is somuch better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,20,13,I was looking for better zoom while still maintaining the compact feel.
B002IPHIEG,20,14,I purchased this camera because I wanted something to replace my Sony DSC-W300.
B002IPHIEG,20,15,My 5 year old Sony that finally broke was 7 mp and had much better still image quality.
B002IPHIEG,20,16,Okay, I really loved this camera and the picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,20,17,The Camera That Stole Me Away From Canon!
B002IPHIEG,20,18,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).
B002IPHIEG,20,19,I purchased this camera after trying and returning the Canon PowerShot SD1300IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Blue).
B002IPHIEG,20,20,I bought this camera to replace my Sony T90 point and shoot when it finally died.
B002IPHIEG,20,21,Having faith and loyalty in the Canon brand (this was our 4th Canon Camera purchase, two of which were Canon AE-1s given as gifts) I contacted Canon and was sorely disappointed.
B002IPHIEG,20,22,I think my next one will be a Casio or Canon.
B002IPHIEG,20,23,I wonder if point and shoot cameras like this one could do better.
B002IPHIEG,20,24,This made a big difference in the quality of the pictures that I took.
B002IPHIEG,21,0,Many of my pictures have spots in them even though I do clean the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,1,The ONLY thing that I do not like is having to open the lens cover to take photos...but in the end this will protect the lens, because I dropped two of my Canons and messed up the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,2,Dust trapped inside lens, again!
B002IPHIEG,21,3,It is so much better than the cameras that have the protruding lens that extends when open.
B002IPHIEG,21,4,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,5,Only problem that I can see is that the thing has the odd habit of turning on while in your pocket, which opens and expands the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,6,The placement of the lens allows for others to touch or cover the lens with their fingers if they are taking a picture for you.
B002IPHIEG,21,7,Light and small for the lens range.3)
B002IPHIEG,21,8,There are many problems with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,21,9,i like how the lens cover slides down and how slim the camera is.
B002IPHIEG,21,10,The only problem I have had is with dust backscatter.
B002IPHIEG,21,11,Great even in low lighted area.The bad side: The rocker/toggle switch used to zooming in and out the lens is fragile!
B002IPHIEG,21,12,Another great feature is the lens cover that acts as an on/off switch.
B002IPHIEG,21,13,I believe this is due to the flash being close to the lens.In summary, DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA.
B002IPHIEG,21,14,Lastly, from the "what were they thinking??" category, the flash is placed in a position where the lens blocks the flash from illuminating the lower left corner of the image at the wide end of the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,15,As a former owner of a Sony A700 with 16-80mm Carl z lenses, plus a whole bag of long range lenses.
B002IPHIEG,21,16,There are many problems however:1.
B002IPHIEG,21,17,Only minor complaint is that the lens is located very near where you hold the camera (upper right-hand corner) so you have to be careful not to take a picture of your thumb or finger -- have done that a few times :).
B002IPHIEG,21,18,Works well in most lighting conditions with/without flash.
B002IPHIEG,21,19,I was advised that this is a technical problem caused by the flash being to close to the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,20,There is always a shadow in the lower left corner of the pictures (because of very short distance between flash and lens).2.
B002IPHIEG,21,21,Then when you receive the camera back from the factory, the spots are gone, but you discover the focus is not as good as it was before you sent the camera for cleaning.... then back to the factory, etc.
B002IPHIEG,21,22,If you take a picture with flash at 24mm, what is a really common use I have to say, it gets a black spot in the lower left corner.
B002IPHIEG,21,23,I place my thumb along the bottom edge right where the battery cover it and there is no lip to keep your thumb from sliding the door open.
B002IPHIEG,21,24,All my shots have turned out great!
B002IPHIEG,22,0,Slightly better at low light but terrible with good light.
B002IPHIEG,22,1,It is a lot better with the picture quality especially in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,2,The low light pictures were much better then any other camera I have owned.
B002IPHIEG,22,3,It's better in low light but still very grainy, however it's worse in good bright light.
B002IPHIEG,22,4,Yes, you are slightly more likely to get a better photo in the dark if you really need to take photos in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,22,5,Still image and print quality are very important to me.
B002IPHIEG,22,6,A grainy photo is better than no photo at all.
B002IPHIEG,22,7,Better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,8,Even the low light pictures don't seem to have a noise problem.
B002IPHIEG,22,9,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,22,10,Low light pictures are blurry and pixelated.
B002IPHIEG,22,11,Image quality was not what I expected.
B002IPHIEG,22,12,nothing better.
B002IPHIEG,22,13,It takes very clear photos in day light and at night time or low light conditions.
B002IPHIEG,22,14,It is excellent in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,15,The low light picture taking is always a problem with cameras this size.
B002IPHIEG,22,16,It does take better photos in low light, but overall picture quality for an amateur user isn't that great.
B002IPHIEG,22,17,Works well in most lighting conditions with/without flash.
B002IPHIEG,22,18,Also, many of my pictures that I have taken have been blurry, pixelated, and of poor quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,19,Low light shots were noisier than my Fuji.
B002IPHIEG,22,20,The colors and lighting in the videos are excellent.
B002IPHIEG,22,21,We set the camera to various ISO settings to try and minimize the noise, but no good.
B002IPHIEG,22,22,We set the camera to various ISO settings to try and minimize the noise, but no good.
B002IPHIEG,22,23,Photo quality under poor light conditions is amazing; photos are better than expected.
B002IPHIEG,22,24,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,23,0,I returned it in the next day I received.
B002IPHIEG,23,1,don't buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,2,I'm somewhat puzzled after reading several of the poor reviews for this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,3,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).
B002IPHIEG,23,4,Do not buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,5,Please save your money and time - look elsewhere.
B002IPHIEG,23,6,I bought one about 2 months ago and have been using it a lot.
B002IPHIEG,23,7,I truly believe you'll be very happy if you decide to purchase this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,8,When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked.
B002IPHIEG,23,9,I now need to buy a new camera for an upcoming trip, and I can assure you it will not be a Sony.Hope this helps,Damian
B002IPHIEG,23,10,Had High Hopes - Defective Product.
B002IPHIEG,23,11,This was my main reason for purchase, and it failed my test.2)
B002IPHIEG,23,12,Quick focusThe bad:1) The only reason I returned it was the biggest.
B002IPHIEG,23,13,While waiting to get the camera, I would check Amazon every day to see if anyone who had actually used the camera had put up any reviews yet.
B002IPHIEG,23,14,Waited until the price came down a bit and bought it.
B002IPHIEG,23,15,I did all my research (reading product reviews from Amazon, CNET, BestBuy etc.) and decided to try out the WX1 and I'm glad I did.
B002IPHIEG,23,16,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,23,17,I am going to see if Sony wiill repair or replace them but right now it feels that $329 x 2 was too much to spend for less than two years use.
B002IPHIEG,23,18,I got it from the Amazon warehouse, so the used price helped make it more palatable plus it's arrival in 2 days thanks to Prime!
B002IPHIEG,23,19,When I body-slammed my camera and myself to the paving stones of Salisbury, England, my Sony DSC-T9 performed like nothing had happened until I returned home, four days later.
B002IPHIEG,23,20,With the first 100 pictures of my trip gone I decided I didn't want to be stressed out every time I ask someone to take a picture of us, not to mention the stress of keeping myself from doing it.
B002IPHIEG,23,21,Had lots of hope.
B002IPHIEG,23,22,You have to package the camera yourself and ship it to Texas for several weeks with no replacement in the interim.
B002IPHIEG,23,23,I've owned Sony cameras for years and would never look at another brand of camera, until now.
B002IPHIEG,23,24,Not worth the price.
B002IPHIEG,24,0,Basically you don't have any manual controls at all.
B002IPHIEG,24,1,I looked all over to try to find which settings to change but I never found it.
B002IPHIEG,24,2,Take time to read and understand the instruction manual!Be sure and buy an xtra battery as the camera will gobble up the available "juice" while shooting.
B002IPHIEG,24,3,I figured out most of the settings without even reading the instructions.
B002IPHIEG,24,4,That screen is easy to maneuver around.
B002IPHIEG,24,5,How is that possible?! (for the answer, see the next line item)- No manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,24,6,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,24,7,this is 2010 not 1985.4.  User interface - menu is difficult to navigate and full of gimmicky 'features' as opposed to useful things.
B002IPHIEG,24,8,First, it is all too easy while shooting to accidently change the settings and all too difficult to get back to what I want--after I realize what's happened.
B002IPHIEG,24,9,When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked.
B002IPHIEG,24,10,It is not always the case, though; my last shoot, I know I did not change the settings but they changed to the lowest setting nonetheless.If I could afford a more professional camera, I would get it, but as a freelance writer a point-and-shoot is it and it has to be easy to handle.
B002IPHIEG,24,11,I'm somewhat puzzled after reading several of the poor reviews for this camera.
B002IPHIEG,24,12,The TX1 doesn't have a "movie mode" button like the t500/t900, you have to use the menu system to turn it on.
B002IPHIEG,24,13,Still, this camera seems to me to have a lot of functionality that makes it worth the time learning how to use it properly.
B002IPHIEG,24,14,Third, when trying to get back to the settings I want in the middle of a photo opp, it can be confusing trying to find the right screen.Fourth (and worst), the image size seems to change without my actually choosing it.
B002IPHIEG,24,15,I am a point-and-shoot camera user with no professional experience in this area.I found myself carrying both cameras at the same time.
B002IPHIEG,24,16,The touchscreen also got an upgrade even if it's smaller and has more of a iphone'isk menu system.
B002IPHIEG,24,17,The movies however are what I find are a better quality and the format is easier for me to use.
B002IPHIEG,24,18,He's picked it up a couple of times, but hasn't yet figured out how to work it...heaven help he should actually READ the manual (which I suggest).
B002IPHIEG,24,19,The controls are pretty intuitive and easy for an amateur like me to figure out.
B002IPHIEG,24,20,Wasn't looking for dslr quality, but something that looked  nice would be useful.
B002IPHIEG,24,21,It worked better than I expected!
B002IPHIEG,24,22,I do a lot of shooting under pressure.
B002IPHIEG,24,23,The only slow operation is changing to View mode just after taking a picture, which takes 1-2s.However, there's a big fat problem with the WX1:  manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,24,24,Most were the work of apparently accomplished photographers.
B002IPHIEG,25,0,The only problem I have had is with dust backscatter.
B002IPHIEG,25,1,With that, I will clear up problems previous owners have had.First, I'm sure all of you want to know how good the new Exmor R sensor is.
B002IPHIEG,25,2,Just for the record, I never experienced such a problem neither with my T100 nor with my Sony HDR-SR7 camcorder.
B002IPHIEG,25,3,don't buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,4,It got me thinking about all of the Sony products we have had in the past.
B002IPHIEG,25,5,So check, check, and check!
B002IPHIEG,25,6,Leave quality aside, Sony sucks.
B002IPHIEG,25,7,Video is usually okay, but has two major problems... First, the noise of zooming in and out is recorded very loudly.
B002IPHIEG,25,8,Good camera with an awful flaw in the design that affects some pictures.
B002IPHIEG,25,9,About all it can't do is pinch-zoom, and I'm guessing that's more of a patent issue than anything else.
B002IPHIEG,25,10,So far I think the picture quality is really good too.
B002IPHIEG,25,11,I did some research and found that I was FAR from the only one experiencing this issue.
B002IPHIEG,25,12,And of course it had to be Sony.
B002IPHIEG,25,13,After about 5 months with this camera I have produced some very high quality images even at 5 m pixels.
B002IPHIEG,25,14,I've always been a sony camera guy, but this camera has a really big issue that I couldn't believe that it was real when I start testing the camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,15,With video recording, I was very happy to finally be able to zoom in and out while recording, however, I am not happy that it records in mp4 format.
B002IPHIEG,25,16,I now need to buy a new camera for an upcoming trip, and I can assure you it will not be a Sony.Hope this helps,Damian
B002IPHIEG,25,17,Many suggested that buying a cheap knock-off battery would fix the issue, and they were absolutely correct.
B002IPHIEG,25,18,I sent the camera to Sony covered by warranty and customer service (very kindly I must say) told me that the camera was performing under specifications and even if they replaced it with a new one it will have the same flaw, so my only options were to exchange it for a different model or live with it...I'm amazed that they are still selling this camera (that isn't exactly cheap) with this awful flaw, maybe most people won't notice it if they don't take too much close up pictures but be aware of this problem if you're considering getting this camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,19,I was shooting in what would normally be considered a dust free area (Church and restaurant)so it is a design flaw.
B002IPHIEG,25,20,Recording HD movie were also disappointing, when you are recording you can actually hear sound of zooming and focusing when you play them back.
B002IPHIEG,25,21,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,25,22,I bought this when it first came out a couple of years ago , It can take some really amazing photos and some times it takes bad photos not sure if it is me or the camera im kind of a newbie.My friend bought a expensive dslr camera and was like wow what kind of camera do you use ?
B002IPHIEG,25,23,Having said that, I would buy this little cutie again 100x before its sucessor is released.
B002IPHIEG,25,24,I returned it in the next day I received.
B00DMS0LCO,0,0,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,0,1,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,0,2,I added the grip, a couple of batteries and gone to shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,0,3,I don't care how good it works, give me form and function!!
B00DMS0LCO,0,4,I have never heard of this.why is there a communication problem between a new battery and the battery charger?...following the directions I separated the battery from the charger and put it back on....still blinking rapidly.....repeated this action again and finally the battery started to charge.
B00DMS0LCO,0,5,the battery charger charge TWO batteries fast at the same time?I'd consider a full frame version, if the cons are fix.for
B00DMS0LCO,0,6,Long exposure behavior (I use it for astro pictures at 2-5 minute exposure) is really no difference to the already great T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,0,7,I put the dead battery that came with the camera on the charger and left it to charge thinking nothing of it.4
B00DMS0LCO,0,8,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,0,9,When I get the battery, there is no power in it.
B00DMS0LCO,0,10,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,0,11,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,0,12,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,0,13,All the cameras do a great job efficiently.
B00DMS0LCO,0,14,NOT COOL.I have 2 after market batteries that would no charge on this charger .Bummer I then ordered an aftermarket charger for 5 $ no big deal.
B00DMS0LCO,0,15,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,0,16,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,0,17,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,0,18,But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,0,19,I have owned DSLR's before, and I was happy with my Nikon which died after getting sand in the lens which was too expensive to replace.
B00DMS0LCO,0,20,Isn't the idea to capture an image and display it?Conclusion> It is a worthy, light camera capable of good images when properly exposed.
B00DMS0LCO,0,21,I waited 7 years to upgrade and I feel like I bought a toy.
B00DMS0LCO,0,22,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,0,23,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,0,24,However, if I look at my trusty Rebel T2i, which has been used in rain, on the beach, thrown in the backpack on many bike rides and abused in hours and hours of astrophotography sessions (usually covered in frozen dew), it still looks and behaves almost like new.
B00DMS0LCO,1,0,Touch flip screen.
B00DMS0LCO,1,1,Responsiveness is just as good as on my iPod Touch.-
B00DMS0LCO,1,2,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,1,3,I  am not a big fan of touch screen operation because the screen gets smudged in a hurry, being anal retentive/ a clean freak this gets annoying to me but I will make the best of it.*
B00DMS0LCO,1,4,The still photos can't be touched.
B00DMS0LCO,1,5,The swivel touch screen is not really comfortable to use with your left hand (considering your right hand is holding the camera).
B00DMS0LCO,1,6,The icing on the cake is the Touch Screen with multi-touch operation, as well as Touch AF! Excellent!
B00DMS0LCO,1,7,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,1,8,always put a screen shield on this camera ASAP you'll be glad you did.the 3 main reasons I sold my 5D mark ii was it didn't have a swivel screen , I love the swivel screen, its a must for video shooting.
B00DMS0LCO,1,9,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,1,10,The camera is nice and good, but over rated.It has many cons, some are serious, example:1.Build quality, no way close to a $1000 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,1,11,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,1,12,I am still trying to figure out how to hold the camera so that I can tap on the back viewing screen where I want the focus.
B00DMS0LCO,1,13,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,1,14,(with decent light conditions)Color Saturation and Image quality were good (with decent light)7fps was fast enough for me.Weather resistance was useful.Tilt screen was useful.18-135
B00DMS0LCO,1,15,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,1,16,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,1,17,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,1,18,It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots.
B00DMS0LCO,1,19,I feel I have most shooting situations covered with the on camera flash although it has its drawbacks.
B00DMS0LCO,1,20,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,1,21,While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,1,22,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,1,23,Images are softer than expected.
B00DMS0LCO,1,24,camera 7 FPS is awesome + 20 MP is pretty cool.one
B00DMS0LCO,2,0,I upgraded from a Canon Rebel to the 70d.
B00DMS0LCO,2,1,Again the upgrade from previous models is significant with better focus tracking and wonderful HD performance.
B00DMS0LCO,2,2,I tend to default to the viewfinder for my composition but the Live View option on the 70d is so good that I am using it as well.
B00DMS0LCO,2,3,a leap in continous AF (in good light).
B00DMS0LCO,2,4,Excellent upgrade for Canon owners.
B00DMS0LCO,2,5,But for those who may be considering moving up the Canon line or hopping in for the first time hopefully I can help.
B00DMS0LCO,2,6,The sensitivity of the autofocus points in Live View is also excellent, arguably more accurate than what can be achieved through the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,2,7,Good kit lens.
B00DMS0LCO,2,8,All the cameras do a great job efficiently.
B00DMS0LCO,2,9,a wide 80% dedicated to AF (in AF-C mode), it works nicely with Flash that has the AF illuminating light.Overlay of info in view finder makes composition a piece of cake.The red AF confirmation in view finder keeps my eye on the subject not having to wonder off center.The kit lens focus in near silent.
B00DMS0LCO,2,10,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,2,11,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,2,12,Yes they are not as fast as the l-lenses/pro lenses but they are a lot cheaper and for that money it is way better then anything else.The only thing that is a little bit sad is that already with an iso of 3200, you can notice a strong noise.
B00DMS0LCO,2,13,Instead, you have to flip the switch and use the live view mode.
B00DMS0LCO,2,14,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.
B00DMS0LCO,2,15,If you need a camera for only still photography you may be better off buying a 7D or full frame camera for the money even tho it does do a "pretty good" job much like the original 60D.
B00DMS0LCO,2,16,Perfect for action and video (video is unbeatable) This Camera I perfect for action photography it is super fast and the autofocus is always right on.The wifi function is very nice but just a gadget for fun.The live view focus is super fast and and combined with the touch it is unbeatable in video and live view mode.The feeling in the hand is similar to the on find in the 5d III it is just way lighter.Another big pro is the variety of lenses, because you can either use the pro lenses with the ef connection or the cheaper ef-s lenses, where canon just recently added the new stm type which is as quiet as the pro lenses, which is nice for video, and a lot faster in focusing then the older ef-s lenses, which is nice for action.
B00DMS0LCO,2,17,In my case Tamron service was aware of the issue and under warranty upgraded my lenses firmware and now everything works perfectly.
B00DMS0LCO,2,18,The 19 point autofocus system, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder, consistently miss-focus the pictures, with my Canon 300mm F4 IS L lens.
B00DMS0LCO,2,19,I have used Xsi, 7D, 6D, 60D, 5Dii  5Diii and Nikon D90, D600 , D7000, and D7100.
B00DMS0LCO,2,20,I had to switch back and forth and was frustrated as I prefer to use the viewfinder but HAVE to use live view for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,2,21,For the same camera settings, the 70D produces much more aggressive image settings than my T2i, which makes the 70D performance look much better at first glance.
B00DMS0LCO,2,22,Nice update to an already strong predecessor for semi-pro photographers...video functionality is unreal.
B00DMS0LCO,2,23,I find autofocus to be faster and more accurate with all my lenses than had been the case with the 60d.
B00DMS0LCO,2,24,I really like the revision to the autofocus point selection options in the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,3,0,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,3,1,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,3,2,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,3,3,Helpful, great illustrations.
B00DMS0LCO,3,4,Most reviews made it sound like a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,3,5,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,3,6,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,3,7,This is what i want it's easy to connect to my smartphone.
B00DMS0LCO,3,8,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,3,9,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,3,10,But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,3,11,Of all the L lenses I've used, this sounded like how cat walks, dead silent.Articulated screen is awesome.wireless
B00DMS0LCO,3,12,I was attending a concert and wanted to alternate between pictures and movie clips.
B00DMS0LCO,3,13,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,3,14,I have not tried any of the movie editing capabilities; will report later.
B00DMS0LCO,3,15,Now, the T2i has great image quality (especially based on the year when it came out), but noise and dynamic range are practically the same.
B00DMS0LCO,3,16,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,3,17,The camera is nice and good, but over rated.It has many cons, some are serious, example:1.Build quality, no way close to a $1000 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,3,18,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,3,19,Mike Browne and other tutorials on YouTube will help me.
B00DMS0LCO,3,20,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,3,21,Amazing!
B00DMS0LCO,3,22,Very good camera with only a few minor issues.
B00DMS0LCO,3,23,Based on all the great reviews, it may only be only some batches - I do not know.
B00DMS0LCO,3,24,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,4,0,However, it's still very good.
B00DMS0LCO,4,1,I have had a DSLR previously, but always kept it in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,4,2,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,4,3,Helpful, great illustrations.
B00DMS0LCO,4,4,Uses flash for low-light focus which will blind your subject.-
B00DMS0LCO,4,5,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,4,6,Amazing!
B00DMS0LCO,4,7,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,4,8,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,4,9,Seems like a good camera, the rest is up to me.
B00DMS0LCO,4,10,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,4,11,It's well made, easy to use, and the focus is very good - no hunting and pecking but smooth and quick.For video it's live auto-focus is excellent - use the swivel touch screen to keep the focus on a moving subject.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars are the button layouts make it a little counter-intuitive to find and change manual settings like white balance.Of course it's not as good as a full frame camera like the 5dmarkii in low light, or for it's dynamic range.
B00DMS0LCO,4,12,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,4,13,It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots.
B00DMS0LCO,4,14,Image quality in low light a bit noisy- Auto-Focus on the center focus point required +17 manual focus adjustment with a new 50mm f1.4.
B00DMS0LCO,4,15,I hope I can learn to use 20% of the features on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,4,16,It's a great camera with an outstanding feature set.
B00DMS0LCO,4,17,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,4,18,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,4,19,It does however lack a good amount of creative features within the camera for video recording.
B00DMS0LCO,4,20,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,4,21,I like all the features on the camera and as soon as I work my way through the 400 plus page manual, I am sure that I will take advantage of the versatility that this camera offers.
B00DMS0LCO,4,22,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,4,23,Fantastic camera held back by poor software and auto focus issues.
B00DMS0LCO,4,24,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,5,0,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,5,1,Works like a charm (after I got used to the somewhat tinny sound of the shutter).-
B00DMS0LCO,5,2,As usual, several things have changed, so it will take me some time to feel totally comfortable with it.
B00DMS0LCO,5,3,I like my buttons and I am slow to adjust to what the touch screen offers, but I am catching on.
B00DMS0LCO,5,4,It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots.
B00DMS0LCO,5,5,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,5,6,I should note that I used the viewfinder primarily rather than the LCD screen for the pics.I found it very frustrating that the camera does not have a dedicated button for movies.
B00DMS0LCO,5,7,Responsiveness is just as good as on my iPod Touch.-
B00DMS0LCO,5,8,a leap in continous AF (in good light).
B00DMS0LCO,5,9,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,5,10,I know one day I will get used to the positions of the button.
B00DMS0LCO,5,11,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,5,12,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,5,13,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,5,14,What you will notice a difference in is the rate at which photos can be shot and processed.
B00DMS0LCO,5,15,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,5,16,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,5,17,The redesign of button locations on the rear of the camera make for a fluid interface to the menus screens while maintaining the appeal that higher quality SLRs have had with dedicate Aperature and Shutter speed wheels.
B00DMS0LCO,5,18,It does however lack a good amount of creative features within the camera for video recording.
B00DMS0LCO,5,19,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,5,20,The focusing appeared to be very fast and accurate except later I found most of my images were not properly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,5,21,But, having back-lit buttons would flatten the learning curve, while I am looking at the picture on LCD and change parameter at the same time.The lens 18-135mm has good focal length; it's sharpness fall off quickly toward the corners.can
B00DMS0LCO,5,22,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,5,23,High Image Quality from Poor light, quick focusing moving subjects, .... were my primary intend for this.
B00DMS0LCO,5,24,Nice update to an already strong predecessor for semi-pro photographers...video functionality is unreal.
B00DMS0LCO,6,0,In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card.
B00DMS0LCO,6,1,When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't.
B00DMS0LCO,6,2,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,6,3,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,6,4,the on camera flash.
B00DMS0LCO,6,5,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,6,6,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,6,7,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,6,8,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,6,9,My home is reasonably well lit and I was surprised when the flash popped up as I attempted to take a photo of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,6,10,I feel I have most shooting situations covered with the on camera flash although it has its drawbacks.
B00DMS0LCO,6,11,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,6,12,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,6,13,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,6,14,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,6,15,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,6,16,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,6,17,I have an external speed light/flash I just really never find myself using it.
B00DMS0LCO,6,18,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,6,19,I also took some video which caused the lens to hunt even though the camera was pointed directly at my daughter and the room was well lit.
B00DMS0LCO,6,20,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,6,21,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,6,22,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,6,23,I have been very happy with my 60Ds, but wanted to get the additional focus points.
B00DMS0LCO,6,24,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,7,0,One like this and another small P&S; I can carry in my pocket.
B00DMS0LCO,7,1,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,7,2,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,3,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,7,4,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,7,5,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,7,6,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,7,7,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,7,8,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,7,9,When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't.

B00DMS0LCO,7,11,I like all the features on the camera and as soon as I work my way through the 400 plus page manual, I am sure that I will take advantage of the versatility that this camera offers.
B00DMS0LCO,7,12,a sony RX100?
B00DMS0LCO,7,13,I don't care how good it works, give me form and function!!
B00DMS0LCO,7,14,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,7,15,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,7,16,But, having back-lit buttons would flatten the learning curve, while I am looking at the picture on LCD and change parameter at the same time.The lens 18-135mm has good focal length; it's sharpness fall off quickly toward the corners.can
B00DMS0LCO,7,17,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,7,18,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,7,19,I added a 18-270 Tamron lens to it, which is lighter than some others with this range.
B00DMS0LCO,7,20,Regardless of the focus mode you use, none works well for moving subjects.The camera takes nice pictures, but there are many better options, and with the release of the new Sony A6000, this camera is good only if you already invested in canon glass, and sadly most of it won't work with this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,7,21,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,7,22,It's a great camera with an outstanding feature set.
B00DMS0LCO,7,23,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,7,24,Basically, I'm getting this so, I won't miss a shot shooting photo journalist style.Since there are so many reviews to read, I'm keeping it short.PROFastest and most reliable AF in its class in good outdoor light.with
B00DMS0LCO,8,0,I'm not going to restate all the excellent attributes of the camera and lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,1,Over priced not a full frame sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,8,2,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,8,3,This one did not go on if the lens cap was on, nor could you put the lens cap on if the hood was attached.
B00DMS0LCO,8,4,a sony RX100?
B00DMS0LCO,8,5,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,8,6,For a $1200 camera it should have a full frame senor.Their still not there yet.
B00DMS0LCO,8,7,I currently own a Canon Xti + Tamron 17mm-50mm f/2.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,8,Most of my lenses are USM or L series which make for much quicker focusing than even the STM but do sacrifice a bit of more noise (still much better than the cheap kit lens tho).Overall this camera is a solid performer.
B00DMS0LCO,8,9,The next best thing to getting a full frame.
B00DMS0LCO,8,10,I added a 18-270 Tamron lens to it, which is lighter than some others with this range.
B00DMS0LCO,8,11,Over priced.
B00DMS0LCO,8,12,We have to hold off until they produce a camera with a full frame senor for a reasonable price.
B00DMS0LCO,8,13,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,8,14,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,8,15,The lens hood I received was poor.
B00DMS0LCO,8,16,No comparison to other offerings from Olympus, Panasonic or Sony.
B00DMS0LCO,8,17,I have used many DSLRs including Nikon.
B00DMS0LCO,8,18,Excellent upgrade for Canon owners.
B00DMS0LCO,8,19,Why I returned 70D+EF 24mm f/1.4 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,8,20,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,8,21,I have a professional Canon video camera.
B00DMS0LCO,8,22,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,8,23,As a long-time Canon user with a 5D MKIII, multiple 'L' series lenses, etc.
B00DMS0LCO,8,24,Micro four thirds?
B00DMS0LCO,9,0,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,9,1,Too good for me.
B00DMS0LCO,9,2,I do wish at times I could soften the image because the detail can be too telling.
B00DMS0LCO,9,3,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,9,4,Images are softer than expected.
B00DMS0LCO,9,5,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,9,6,a leap in continous AF (in good light).
B00DMS0LCO,9,7,(with decent light conditions)Color Saturation and Image quality were good (with decent light)7fps was fast enough for me.Weather resistance was useful.Tilt screen was useful.18-135
B00DMS0LCO,9,8,High Image Quality from Poor light, quick focusing moving subjects, .... were my primary intend for this.
B00DMS0LCO,9,9,Should be better in 2013.

B00DMS0LCO,9,11,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,9,12,But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,9,13,Isn't the idea to capture an image and display it?Conclusion> It is a worthy, light camera capable of good images when properly exposed.
B00DMS0LCO,9,14,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,9,15,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,9,16,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,9,17,Now, the T2i has great image quality (especially based on the year when it came out), but noise and dynamic range are practically the same.
B00DMS0LCO,9,18,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.

B00DMS0LCO,9,21,I did have high hopes for better low light photos with a new processor since the 60D essentially used a 4 year old unit but unfortunately they look almost identical.
B00DMS0LCO,9,22,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,9,23,I often take photos of birds in flight and I got a lot more keepers compared to my other bodies.
B00DMS0LCO,9,24,The in camera aberration and ISO reduction really works.
B00DMS0LCO,10,0,That is the reason I bought this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,1,I actually purchased a T5i because of an amazing Christmas deal.
B00DMS0LCO,10,2,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,10,3,I bought this on pre-order, and it's been a fantastic little camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,4,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,10,5,I waited 7 years to upgrade and I feel like I bought a toy.
B00DMS0LCO,10,6,I was always hesitant to purchase one because of price and i didn't think it would change the way i took pictures.
B00DMS0LCO,10,7,If I can't buy a Pro camera for $4000.00
B00DMS0LCO,10,8,This is a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,9,Read the professional reviews.
B00DMS0LCO,10,10,No GPS -- otherwise great.
B00DMS0LCO,10,11,I'd researched it, consider the Nikon, but I still think I've made the right choice for me.
B00DMS0LCO,10,12,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,10,13,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,10,14,Perfect for this use, using the kit lens.Impressed with the features.
B00DMS0LCO,10,15,As a result, I've paid full-price for an 'open-box' (being charitable) product.
B00DMS0LCO,10,16,But I decided to buy the Sony because of all the rave reviews I've read; it should meet my needs (hasn't arrived yet).
B00DMS0LCO,10,17,However, consider other sellers.Amazon's performance on my purchase was appalling and possibly fraudulent.
B00DMS0LCO,10,18,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,10,19,Excellant Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,10,20,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,10,21,I'm a professional photographer and we have ventured into the photo booth business.
B00DMS0LCO,10,22,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,10,23,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,10,24,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,11,0,Good Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,1,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,11,2,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,11,3,Helpful, great illustrations.
B00DMS0LCO,11,4,I'm a professional photographer and we have ventured into the photo booth business.
B00DMS0LCO,11,5,There have been some great pictures and some not as good or worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,11,6,I hope I can learn to use 20% of the features on this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,7,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,11,8,Excellant Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,9,Nice update to an already strong predecessor for semi-pro photographers...video functionality is unreal.
B00DMS0LCO,11,10,Perfect for this use, using the kit lens.Impressed with the features.
B00DMS0LCO,11,11,The added perk of the New touch screen technology from the T4i and T5i have greatly improved the speed to many obscure functions sometimes needed in the depths of software.
B00DMS0LCO,11,12,Have the 60D as well and they are quite similar.
B00DMS0LCO,11,13,It looks, feels, and can operate much like the 60d that I owned previously so I could use it right out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,11,14,I have had a DSLR previously, but always kept it in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,11,15,The important part is the photographic result, fortunately all this camera's do a great job.The 70D is a worthy replacement to the 60D but if you already own a 60D keep using it.I believe that no camera will make you 100% happy but again, who cares.
B00DMS0LCO,11,16,The icing on the cake is the Touch Screen with multi-touch operation, as well as Touch AF! Excellent!
B00DMS0LCO,11,17,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,11,18,I am determined to learn about creative photography and I have apparently picked a high end camera to begin with.
B00DMS0LCO,11,19,Read the professional reviews.
B00DMS0LCO,11,20,All the cameras do a great job efficiently.
B00DMS0LCO,11,21,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,11,22,But when i read a review of the 70D online, and understood the differences, i immediately knew i needed to step up to a mid-range body.The 70D is an amazing camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,23,This is a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,24,Responsiveness is just as good as on my iPod Touch.-
B00DMS0LCO,12,0,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,12,1,Too good for me.
B00DMS0LCO,12,2,However, it's still very good.
B00DMS0LCO,12,3,I really like the features of this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,4,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,12,5,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,12,6,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,12,7,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,12,8,Very good camera with only a few minor issues.
B00DMS0LCO,12,9,If you're interested in video production, buy a dedicated video camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,10,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,12,11,It does however lack a good amount of creative features within the camera for video recording.
B00DMS0LCO,12,12,I have a professional Canon video camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,13,That said, even my limited skills have resulted in amazing pics.
B00DMS0LCO,12,14,Finally a word about Video performance.
B00DMS0LCO,12,15,a sony RX100?
B00DMS0LCO,12,16,understand that the "game changing" capabilities of this camera are on the video side, but I don't shoot a lot of video and there are plenty reviews out there on that topic.
B00DMS0LCO,12,17,I do wish at times I could soften the image because the detail can be too telling.
B00DMS0LCO,12,18,being a videographer for many years DSLR'S  have a way to go to match pro-Sumer video cameras.this
B00DMS0LCO,12,19,Regardless of the focus mode you use, none works well for moving subjects.The camera takes nice pictures, but there are many better options, and with the release of the new Sony A6000, this camera is good only if you already invested in canon glass, and sadly most of it won't work with this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,20,However, even thought the video side is awesome, I find it bulky and hard to balance.
B00DMS0LCO,12,21,It's balanced and positioning of all controls makes sense for video.
B00DMS0LCO,12,22,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,12,23,One caution, some third party lenses may not work well in Video mode or may have other compatibility issues with this camera that did not show up on the 60d.
B00DMS0LCO,12,24,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,13,0,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,13,1,When I get the battery, there is no power in it.
B00DMS0LCO,13,2,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,13,3,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,13,4,break battery.
B00DMS0LCO,13,5,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,13,6,I put the dead battery that came with the camera on the charger and left it to charge thinking nothing of it.4
B00DMS0LCO,13,7,the battery charger charge TWO batteries fast at the same time?I'd consider a full frame version, if the cons are fix.for
B00DMS0LCO,13,8,I have never heard of this.why is there a communication problem between a new battery and the battery charger?...following the directions I separated the battery from the charger and put it back on....still blinking rapidly.....repeated this action again and finally the battery started to charge.
B00DMS0LCO,13,9,its not charging ?
B00DMS0LCO,13,10,keep in mind that this battery charger is the same battery charger that comes with the 5dmark ii 7D and a few other models.
B00DMS0LCO,13,11,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,13,12,I think this product was opened before I get it.
B00DMS0LCO,13,13,NOT COOL.I have 2 after market batteries that would no charge on this charger .Bummer I then ordered an aftermarket charger for 5 $ no big deal.
B00DMS0LCO,13,14,I should be able to charge after market batteries on this charger.sample
B00DMS0LCO,13,15,It would still work but it was not tactile.
B00DMS0LCO,13,16,hours later I see the battery still blinking rapidly ....ooops I guess I should read the directions.
B00DMS0LCO,13,17,I took it out of the box and the Live View mode wasn't working reliably: I had to reset the camera twice by pulling the battery out in the first few hours of use.
B00DMS0LCO,13,18,At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.
B00DMS0LCO,13,19,about an hour of use, my rating may change.
B00DMS0LCO,13,20,This way, I can charge it while the car is running rather than getting (my 5th) brick invertor.can
B00DMS0LCO,13,21,I know one day I will get used to the positions of the button.
B00DMS0LCO,13,22,the directions state if the red blinking light flashes rapidly its not charging .
B00DMS0LCO,13,23,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,13,24,After using my camera for 10 days the buttons on the back (Menu/Playback/Q) stopped working.
B00DMS0LCO,14,0,That is why I took one star away.I found the touch LCD and touch control screen on top of the 70D quite useful and adapted to them quickly.
B00DMS0LCO,14,1,I am still trying to figure out how to hold the camera so that I can tap on the back viewing screen where I want the focus.
B00DMS0LCO,14,2,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,14,3,Focus Issue using the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,14,4,Simply compose a shot, touch the specific point on the Live View screen and the 70d can be set up to quickly focus on that spot and shoot.
B00DMS0LCO,14,5,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,14,6,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,14,7,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,14,8,Touch flip screen.
B00DMS0LCO,14,9,The swivel touch screen is not really comfortable to use with your left hand (considering your right hand is holding the camera).
B00DMS0LCO,14,10,Basically, I'm getting this so, I won't miss a shot shooting photo journalist style.Since there are so many reviews to read, I'm keeping it short.PROFastest and most reliable AF in its class in good outdoor light.with
B00DMS0LCO,14,11,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,14,12,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,14,13,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,14,14,shutter would click when the live view button was pressed, but the LCD screen would stay blank.
B00DMS0LCO,14,15,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,14,16,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,14,17,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,14,18,Photo colors were not true unless taken in direct sunlight.
B00DMS0LCO,14,19,Also I have not compared it to any products by Nikon - the review below is only for Canon folks.I will start with the negatives first.The Ugly:Plasticky Dial :Canon- Please use metal for the heavily used parts.The Bad:Noise: There is considerable noise in low light both in photos and videos.(realistic
B00DMS0LCO,14,20,After using my camera for 10 days the buttons on the back (Menu/Playback/Q) stopped working.
B00DMS0LCO,14,21,But for those who may be considering moving up the Canon line or hopping in for the first time hopefully I can help.
B00DMS0LCO,14,22,Half of the still photos were not clearly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,14,23,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,14,24,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,15,0,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,15,1,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,15,2,Focus Issue using the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,15,3,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,15,4,The 19 point autofocus system, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder, consistently miss-focus the pictures, with my Canon 300mm F4 IS L lens.
B00DMS0LCO,15,5,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,15,6,I never had this problem, or any other issue, with my T3i.
B00DMS0LCO,15,7,Auto Focus Problems on 3 Canon 70d's.
B00DMS0LCO,15,8,This was an upgrade for me.
B00DMS0LCO,15,9,Focussing with live view is no problem but focussing correctly when using fast lenses (Sigma f1.8) through the viewfinder results in many missed shots.
B00DMS0LCO,15,10,I tried 3 cameras and all have the same problem.
B00DMS0LCO,15,11,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.
B00DMS0LCO,15,12,I really like the revision to the autofocus point selection options in the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,15,13,Liking the new features having moved up from a canon t3i.
B00DMS0LCO,15,14,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,15,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,15,16,The focusing appeared to be very fast and accurate except later I found most of my images were not properly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,15,17,I have tried most of the tests, micro-adjustments, and other recommendations for those with similar problems, but nothing gives me a consistent focused picture.
B00DMS0LCO,15,18,It appears the 19-point auto-focus is not focusing on the points indicated in the viewfinder, but on something closer.
B00DMS0LCO,15,19,Or better yet....fix it!Update 3/30/14I am sending the camera in for repairsThe lenses I use on this camera are the:- Sigma 1.8 18-35mm- Canon 1.8 85mm- Canon 3.5-5.6
B00DMS0LCO,15,20,While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,15,21,(The situation is much better when using liveview auto-focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,22,(The situation is much better when using liveview auto-focus.
B00DMS0LCO,15,23,I am used to the Rebel T series.
B00DMS0LCO,15,24,It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots.
B00DMS0LCO,16,0,Said i can send my brand new camera for repair.
B00DMS0LCO,16,1,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,2,I gave it a 1 star because of the customer service I received from canon not for the camera itself because i never got see how the camera performs.
B00DMS0LCO,16,3,Poor customer service is beyond doubt.
B00DMS0LCO,16,4,After discussion, Amazon agreed to send a replacement but this did not arrive in time for my flight and was cancelled.I wrote, I called, I suggested that the replacement be delivered directly.
B00DMS0LCO,16,5,When i called canon the guy treated me as if I was stupid and was telling me there is no way that there can be a err 30 code because thats a lens error and usually happens after a lot of use.
B00DMS0LCO,16,6,As a result, I've paid full-price for an 'open-box' (being charitable) product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,7,After using my camera for 10 days the buttons on the back (Menu/Playback/Q) stopped working.
B00DMS0LCO,16,8,does not have Wi-Fi capability, the opposite of the original product description on the Canon USA website.
B00DMS0LCO,16,9,If you get a camera that is used I would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one.
B00DMS0LCO,16,10,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,16,11,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,16,12,If you do video then this could be a good option.
B00DMS0LCO,16,13,so needless to say I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.
B00DMS0LCO,16,14,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,16,15,Maybe I got a bad piece, I still expect better quality control for a camera that cost over a 1000 dollars two stars of for that.
B00DMS0LCO,16,16,Amazon is selling used cameras as new!
B00DMS0LCO,16,17,In my case Tamron service was aware of the issue and under warranty upgraded my lenses firmware and now everything works perfectly.
B00DMS0LCO,16,18,I purchased this camera about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,16,19,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).

B00DMS0LCO,16,21,This is a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,16,22,Returned for replacement - hope it's OK!
B00DMS0LCO,16,23,Oh yes, the proof... Come on Amazon, you can train your packaging staff better than that.
B00DMS0LCO,16,24,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,17,0,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,1,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,17,2,date was set on the first camera.
B00DMS0LCO,17,3,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,17,4,All 3 that I tried had the same Auto Focus problems that could not be corrected by the AF Micro Adjustment.
B00DMS0LCO,17,5,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,17,6,Uses flash for low-light focus which will blind your subject.-
B00DMS0LCO,17,7,first camera was set up to shoot RAW.
B00DMS0LCO,17,8,I use the same flash setup in the flash's manual mode, without using FEL, and adjust the power down to say 1/2 or 1/4 or somewhere in between, the photos seem properly exposed (as long as I dial in the correct flash power adjustment).
B00DMS0LCO,17,9,Defective in full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,17,10,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,17,11,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,17,12,Image quality in low light a bit noisy- Auto-Focus on the center focus point required +17 manual focus adjustment with a new 50mm f1.4.
B00DMS0LCO,17,13,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,17,14,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,17,15,Half of the still photos were not clearly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,17,16,She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one.
B00DMS0LCO,17,17,Video focus tracking only worked half the time when handheld.
B00DMS0LCO,17,18,Focus Issue using the viewfinder.
B00DMS0LCO,17,19,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,17,20,It's a great camera with an outstanding feature set.
B00DMS0LCO,17,21,All photos with and without FEL were properly exposed and looked great.I use bounce flash indoors a lot for our one year old granddaughter.
B00DMS0LCO,17,22,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,17,23,It also chooses a high ISO when using the flash (like 1600) guaranteeing some graininess.
B00DMS0LCO,17,24,I have tried micro adjustments but that doesn't seem to work as the camera is inconsistent in how it misses focus.
B00DMS0LCO,18,0,I wish I can assign the WB to a button, but you can not.
B00DMS0LCO,18,1,It just shows how many "clicks" are on your shutter, in your camera.
B00DMS0LCO,18,2,Example: you can not assign the buttons you like.
B00DMS0LCO,18,3,It does not remember it.And so many cons.7.Focus, for the second time: Only good for stationary subject.
B00DMS0LCO,18,4,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,18,5,shutter would click when the live view button was pressed, but the LCD screen would stay blank.
B00DMS0LCO,18,6,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,18,7,first camera was set up to shoot RAW.
B00DMS0LCO,18,8,I had to get mine replaced  because the shutter button suddenly stopped bouncing back up.
B00DMS0LCO,18,9,I tried 3 cameras and all have the same problem.
B00DMS0LCO,18,10,Snapping and noisy and well worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,18,11,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,18,12,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,18,13,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,18,14,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.

B00DMS0LCO,18,18,It was snapping and noisyThe onboard microphone was just as bad.
B00DMS0LCO,18,19,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,18,20,What you will notice a difference in is the rate at which photos can be shot and processed.
B00DMS0LCO,18,21,The camera is nice and good, but over rated.It has many cons, some are serious, example:1.Build quality, no way close to a $1000 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,18,22,Half of the still photos were not clearly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,18,23,camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right.
B00DMS0LCO,18,24,I like my buttons and I am slow to adjust to what the touch screen offers, but I am catching on.
B00DMS0LCO,19,0,Amazon sold this 70d to me as new, it came with with a memory card with other peoples pictures on it.Obviously not new.
B00DMS0LCO,19,1,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,19,2,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,19,3,Audio plug is worthless.
B00DMS0LCO,19,4,Arrived quickly as promised, but would not recognize or format mem card.
B00DMS0LCO,19,5,battery be charged via USB?
B00DMS0LCO,19,6,Amazon said it was new, it was not.
B00DMS0LCO,19,7,the battery charger charge TWO batteries fast at the same time?I'd consider a full frame version, if the cons are fix.for
B00DMS0LCO,19,8,Microphone is even more worthless.I plugged in external shotgun mic with a 1/8 adapter.
B00DMS0LCO,19,9,Unless they come up with a fix fairly quickly, I'm not sure I'd ever buy another Canon camera after this.
B00DMS0LCO,19,10,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,19,11,NOT COOL.I have 2 after market batteries that would no charge on this charger .Bummer I then ordered an aftermarket charger for 5 $ no big deal.
B00DMS0LCO,19,12,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,19,13,She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one.
B00DMS0LCO,19,14,Same results with bouncing the flash off the ceiling.
B00DMS0LCO,19,15,I guess I'll have to resort to FEL use, but that amount flashes takes a toll on an infant.
B00DMS0LCO,19,16,problem I did encounter is the battery charger.
B00DMS0LCO,19,17,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,19,18,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,19,19,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,19,20,I am an amateur photographer and my new 70D that I purchased a couple months ago at B&H; has been doing the same underexposure stunt that so many others have experienced (For example, see in depth discussions by searching the internet for Canon 70D bounce flash underexposure).This occurs whether I'm bouncing the flash off a white ceiling that's about eight feet high or using a Sto-fen diffuser attached to my Canon 430ex II in E-TTL mode.Whether the lens being used is the Canon 15-85 or the 55-250 STM, all low light indoor photos with the diffuser attached and with the flash head tilted 45 degrees, or 180 degrees, or direct facing are very underexposed.
B00DMS0LCO,19,21,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,19,22,Basically, I'm getting this so, I won't miss a shot shooting photo journalist style.Since there are so many reviews to read, I'm keeping it short.PROFastest and most reliable AF in its class in good outdoor light.with
B00DMS0LCO,19,23,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,19,24,In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card.
B00DMS0LCO,20,0,I've always been a Canon loyalist.
B00DMS0LCO,20,1,I also own a Canon PowerShot s95.
B00DMS0LCO,20,2,They were polite and blamed them selves not the canon.
B00DMS0LCO,20,3,I should've bought a replacement for the Canon PowerShot s95.So I sent the 70D + EF 24mm f/1.4 back and purchased the Sony RX100 II.
B00DMS0LCO,20,4,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,20,5,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,20,6,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,20,7,Also the canon is sticking to the 30p.
B00DMS0LCO,20,8,I had an earlier EOS model that I'd had for several years and was expecting this one to feel about the same.
B00DMS0LCO,20,9,Unless they come up with a fix fairly quickly, I'm not sure I'd ever buy another Canon camera after this.
B00DMS0LCO,20,10,Something like a Canon Rebel T5i + Canon EF 28 mm f/1.8 USM may be just what you need.
B00DMS0LCO,20,11,No comparison to other offerings from Olympus, Panasonic or Sony.
B00DMS0LCO,20,12,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,20,13,I consider myself an avid photographer.
B00DMS0LCO,20,14,Cameras past and present: canon 5D mark III, Canon 7D (owned currently), Leica M3 35mm film, Canon 60D, And Canon t3iThe nitty gritty on this camera after a week of use:Build/functionality-Its a solid update to the popular 60d dslr.
B00DMS0LCO,20,15,Why I returned 70D+EF 24mm f/1.4 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,20,16,I currently own a Canon Xti + Tamron 17mm-50mm f/2.8 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,20,17,I have cheaper canons that do a better job.
B00DMS0LCO,20,18,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,20,19,I Just have one big observation, CHEAP!!
B00DMS0LCO,20,20,I added a 18-270 Tamron lens to it, which is lighter than some others with this range.
B00DMS0LCO,20,21,I waited 7 years to upgrade and I feel like I bought a toy.
B00DMS0LCO,20,22,Canon EOS 70D rating.
B00DMS0LCO,20,23,I don't mean the price (that's not cheap)I mean the construction.
B00DMS0LCO,20,24,No one will say it but switch from a solid "prosumer" camera like my Canon 40D (now 7 years old) and the 70D feels like a kids toy.
B00DMS0LCO,21,0,Good kit lens.
B00DMS0LCO,21,1,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,21,2,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,21,3,The replacement started charging from 0-49%.-The rear lens cap on the kit lens was marred noticeably.-The
B00DMS0LCO,21,4,I'm using the kit lens (ef-s 18-135 stm).
B00DMS0LCO,21,5,This one did not go on if the lens cap was on, nor could you put the lens cap on if the hood was attached.
B00DMS0LCO,21,6,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.
B00DMS0LCO,21,7,I realized I might get better results with a better (prime?) lens but I also realized that the camera was just too big and heavy and that I was probably going to leave it home most of the time.
B00DMS0LCO,21,8,I have owned DSLR's before, and I was happy with my Nikon which died after getting sand in the lens which was too expensive to replace.
B00DMS0LCO,21,9,The 70d is quite a bit heavier and the lens is heavy as well.
B00DMS0LCO,21,10,So Far, So Good.
B00DMS0LCO,21,11,Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.
B00DMS0LCO,21,12,Comes surprisingly close to the 24-105mm L lens, but with a wider range and a lot lower price.
B00DMS0LCO,21,13,With a zoom that has a variable aperture, it's a hit and miss approach and quite cumbersome.Also, I tried the same lenses attached to my Canon T3i taking the same photos as I did with the 70D using the same flash and diffuser without using FEL.
B00DMS0LCO,21,14,Oh yes, the proof... Come on Amazon, you can train your packaging staff better than that.
B00DMS0LCO,21,15,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,21,16,Bought this camera for its auto-focus, returned this camera due to autofocus.
B00DMS0LCO,21,17,On delivery the box was clearly re-sealed, accessory packaging opened, and other signs of hasty re-packaging evident.
B00DMS0LCO,21,18,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.
B00DMS0LCO,21,19,It is a Brand New Camera, and when I first opened the package, I found quite a few specks of small dusts on the assembly mirror, it is UNACCETABLE manufacturing control when you consider how EXPENSIVE this 1 pound little machine is.Shame on Canon, This camera will DESERVE one Star.
B00DMS0LCO,21,20,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,21,21,I posted a separate review under the individual lens item on Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,21,22,Or better yet....fix it!Update 3/30/14I am sending the camera in for repairsThe lenses I use on this camera are the:- Sigma 1.8 18-35mm- Canon 1.8 85mm- Canon 3.5-5.6
B00DMS0LCO,21,23,The focusing appeared to be very fast and accurate except later I found most of my images were not properly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,21,24,One like this and another small P&S; I can carry in my pocket.
B00DMS0LCO,22,0,low light conditions like indoors during evening time)  .
B00DMS0LCO,22,1,lens image stabilization seems to be good.
B00DMS0LCO,22,2,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,22,3,Half of the still photos were not clearly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,22,4,But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,22,5,I've not had the time to use it like I plan to, but so far, I've taken some good photos with it.
B00DMS0LCO,22,6,For the same camera settings, the 70D produces much more aggressive image settings than my T2i, which makes the 70D performance look much better at first glance.
B00DMS0LCO,22,7,Now, the T2i has great image quality (especially based on the year when it came out), but noise and dynamic range are practically the same.
B00DMS0LCO,22,8,Some report significant low light performance improvements over the older 18 MP sensor, but you might want to check the noise reduction settings in DPP.
B00DMS0LCO,22,9,so far so good.
B00DMS0LCO,22,10,The camera takes great pics especially in low light and great movies as well.
B00DMS0LCO,22,11,Only for higher ISO and longer exposures one can see a little improvement (but not much more than you can expect in variances from the same sensor model).
B00DMS0LCO,22,12,Also I have not compared it to any products by Nikon - the review below is only for Canon folks.I will start with the negatives first.The Ugly:Plasticky Dial :Canon- Please use metal for the heavily used parts.The Bad:Noise: There is considerable noise in low light both in photos and videos.(realistic
B00DMS0LCO,22,13,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,22,14,Photo colors were not true unless taken in direct sunlight.
B00DMS0LCO,22,15,Maybe not as good as I would expect, but the keeper rate is considerably higher.
B00DMS0LCO,22,16,In fact, I can't tell the difference between unprocessed results from both sensors, even at 100%, for ISO 800 and below.
B00DMS0LCO,22,17,The in camera aberration and ISO reduction really works.
B00DMS0LCO,22,18,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,22,19,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,22,20,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,22,21,Research online indicates that the camera is simply not good enough for these fast lenses and that the only way acquire accurate focus is by using liveview....I am not sure if this is true....I expected a camera at this price point to do better.
B00DMS0LCO,22,22,My first trial shots with this camera yielded some that I thought were pretty soft for the pixel count of the camera.
B00DMS0LCO,22,23,18-135mmUpdate 4/5/14I did send camera in on 4/31Got it back from Canon on 4/4 - SUPER FAST TURNAROUNDFocus seems to be much improved but larger aperture and low light...Liveview focus is still more accurate.Added 1 star
B00DMS0LCO,22,24,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.
B00DMS0LCO,23,0,See the Amazon review by Mr. Ralph J. Secoy.
B00DMS0LCO,23,1,If you get a camera that is used I would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one.
B00DMS0LCO,23,2,It will be returned.
B00DMS0LCO,23,3,I bought two and both were defective out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,23,4,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,23,5,Returned for replacement - hope it's OK!
B00DMS0LCO,23,6,I really liked this camera but had to return it for a defect.
B00DMS0LCO,23,7,I purchased this camera about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,23,8,At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,9,Got a used camera from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,10,Do not buy a 70D from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,11,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,23,12,Why I returned 70D+EF 24mm f/1.4 lens.
B00DMS0LCO,23,13,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,23,14,so needless to say I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.
B00DMS0LCO,23,15,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,16,Amazon is selling used cameras as new!
B00DMS0LCO,23,17,Read their review.
B00DMS0LCO,23,18,But I decided to buy the Sony because of all the rave reviews I've read; it should meet my needs (hasn't arrived yet).
B00DMS0LCO,23,19,I researched this camera well online before deciding to purchase.
B00DMS0LCO,23,20,OK, this is a first for me when dealing with Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,21,I'm honestly beginning to wonder if Amazon buys some manufacturer's QC rejects for a discounted price.Triple check everything you buy from Amazon for defects and also verify that you haven't bought a counterfeit item.
B00DMS0LCO,23,22,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,23,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,24,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,24,0,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,24,1,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,24,2,After using my camera for 10 days the buttons on the back (Menu/Playback/Q) stopped working.
B00DMS0LCO,24,3,Read their review.
B00DMS0LCO,24,4,These buttons are customized via the custom controls and i have mine set up for back button focusing.If you have already mastered your Txi Rebel or other entry level DSLR and want to step up without going to a full frame, the 70D is the best choice.
B00DMS0LCO,24,5,I get good quality of pictures and it is easy to operate it.
B00DMS0LCO,24,6,The Sony RX10 has 3 custom WB and the 70D has just one.5.WB: if you want to chance the custom WB, you have to go and dig into the main menu.
B00DMS0LCO,24,7,I hate the feel!!
B00DMS0LCO,24,8,The menu wheel feels like it cost $2 bucks and should be on a $40.00 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,24,9,The touchscreen is much more than a gimmick, it is my go to method of set up when I turn the camera on.
B00DMS0LCO,24,10,Radio Shack folks provided several types listed in the manual as acceptable , but none worked.
B00DMS0LCO,24,11,My only real disappointment is that it does not have a built-in GPS sensor and I haven't figured out how to make the Canon IOS app work with the GPS.
B00DMS0LCO,24,12,It looks, feels, and can operate much like the 60d that I owned previously so I could use it right out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,24,13,I can immediately see my settings and make alterations with a touch of a finger.
B00DMS0LCO,24,14,But for those who may be considering moving up the Canon line or hopping in for the first time hopefully I can help.
B00DMS0LCO,24,15,If I can't buy a Pro camera for $4000.00
B00DMS0LCO,24,16,give me one that feels like a pro camera (like you did with the 40D).
B00DMS0LCO,24,17,Over time I have migrated up the line of Canon DSLR cameras from the early Rebel series through to the 60d (the 70d predecessor).
B00DMS0LCO,24,18,Excellent upgrade for Canon owners.
B00DMS0LCO,24,19,I like all the features on the camera and as soon as I work my way through the 400 plus page manual, I am sure that I will take advantage of the versatility that this camera offers.
B00DMS0LCO,24,20,I have used many DSLRs including Nikon.
B00DMS0LCO,24,21,That middle level just below Pro and way above consumer.
B00DMS0LCO,24,22,Multiple modes allow you to change focus settings quickly thru simple strokes on the screen.
B00DMS0LCO,24,23,No comparison to other offerings from Olympus, Panasonic or Sony.
B00DMS0LCO,24,24,The camera is nice and good, but over rated.It has many cons, some are serious, example:1.Build quality, no way close to a $1000 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,25,0,Same issues.
B00DMS0LCO,25,1,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,25,2,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,25,3,Most reviews made it sound like a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,25,4,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,25,5,Focus issue???? Sign the petition!
B00DMS0LCO,25,6,Camera takes great pictures and has lots of great features.
B00DMS0LCO,25,7,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,25,8,I had not heard of any focusing issues but a quick internet search on "70D focus issues" yielded a large volume of unhappy customers who have spent a lot of time researching the issue.
B00DMS0LCO,25,9,Note, MFA adjustments only apply to P, Av, Tv and M modes.Search for Youtube video "70D Bad Focus Issues" by CameraRec Toby for more info on the focusing issue.
B00DMS0LCO,25,10,those who are trying to compare 70D and Nikon 7100.
B00DMS0LCO,25,11,If you agree please sign the petition here and maybe we can get Canon to change this:[...]Update 3/27/14:Check out this video for more info: www dot youtube dot com / watch?v=cA6JnzYSDJEThis is a real problem and if I could still return the camera I would.CANON PLEASE RESPOND.
B00DMS0LCO,25,12,I really like the camera but there may be one big flaw.
B00DMS0LCO,25,13,Great camera and lots of features, problem with wi-fi connectivity.
B00DMS0LCO,25,14,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,25,15,Regardless of the focus mode you use, none works well for moving subjects.The camera takes nice pictures, but there are many better options, and with the release of the new Sony A6000, this camera is good only if you already invested in canon glass, and sadly most of it won't work with this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,25,16,I researched this camera well online before deciding to purchase.
B00DMS0LCO,25,17,I thought about getting a replacement but worried about quality control.UPDATE:  I decided to take a chance and purchase a replacement 70D (from a different online retailer this time) and I'm having similar focus issues with it.
B00DMS0LCO,25,18,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,25,19,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,25,20,during some video shots I didn't expect the video to be stable but i was surprised to see a decent shot.Pricing was goodConclusion:All the ugly and bad points (except for the lemon part) seems to be been done intentionally by cannon to balance their lineup.I was split between 6D and 70D and ended up buying 70D as I will be using all those bells and whistles than the full-frame.
B00DMS0LCO,25,21,Image quality in low light a bit noisy- Auto-Focus on the center focus point required +17 manual focus adjustment with a new 50mm f1.4.
B00DMS0LCO,25,22,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,25,23,Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.
B00DMS0LCO,25,24,Disappointing Camera.
