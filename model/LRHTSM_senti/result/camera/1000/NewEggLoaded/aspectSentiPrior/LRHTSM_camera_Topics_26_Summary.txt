B005IHAIMA,0,0,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,0,1,This needs to be corrected!!! Also, Sony's new thing with their cameras is that they will ONLY take a Sony battery.
B005IHAIMA,0,2,I did not have time to confirm this.FIRST USEOnce the battery was fully charged, I reinstalled it into the camera and attached the 50mm E-Mount lens (SEL50F18).
B005IHAIMA,0,3,This should be equated into the total cost of ownership if a viewfinder is important to the consumer.The battery life seems good for now.
B005IHAIMA,0,4,Some people have reported that the battery life will drop by 15-20% after this analysis due to the processing of the pixel mapping procedure.
B005IHAIMA,0,5,Before I venture out, the pack is fully charged and after a 45 minute school function I will be left with about 78 percent.
B005IHAIMA,0,6,No more guessing and losing the perfect shot (happened so many times!) because 1/4 remaining battery equates to 2 percent!This is the first time that the auto modes actually work for me.
B005IHAIMA,0,7,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,0,8,However there are a few downsides:* The video button is in a very unfortunate place and cannot be disabled, so I have drained my battery a couple of times by accidentally capturing 20 minutes of video of the inside of my bag.*
B005IHAIMA,0,9,I must have mistaken this feature from some other camera I was researching.At this time, the only real negative I can find is the battery door.
B005IHAIMA,0,10,I LOVE that you can see what percentage of battery you have remaining.
B005IHAIMA,0,11,Very nice camera.
B005IHAIMA,0,12,Possibly small ones.Battery life is pretty weak.
B005IHAIMA,0,13,I inserted the memory card into my laptop and was able to confirm that the images turned out good.
B005IHAIMA,0,14,If travelling or needing to use the camera for extended periods, then I suggest purchasing a back-up battery pack.
B005IHAIMA,0,15,The grandchildren will be playing nicely together and I want a candid shot of them and with the super fast continuous I could take several photos of them.
B005IHAIMA,0,16,That is with recording for about 9 minutes and using 10fps option.
B005IHAIMA,0,17,A series of Sony Viao laptops drained their batteries even when the computer was off because there was a design failure and the battery circuit could not be closed.
B005IHAIMA,0,18,I found it to be uncomfortable to hold the lens because it was an extra 1-1.5 inches further from the camera, so I placed my hand under the adapter.
B005IHAIMA,0,19,Glad i bought it.I paid $623 on EBAY and mine came with a 18/55MM Lens, flash, a small SONY tote bag, 4GB SD Card, and charger/battery.
B005IHAIMA,0,20,You buy a $600 camera and the stupid developers can't even implement sequential file numbers for video files--only photos.
B005IHAIMA,0,21,Excellent camera but far from perfect - I wouldn't use 42photo.com
B005IHAIMA,0,22,I've had this camera for a few days now, and have taken probably 45 photos.
B005IHAIMA,0,23,Sony 2-, Amazon 5+ I have mixed thoughts about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,0,24,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,1,0,It has a great lcd screen and the best of any of the mirrorless cameras I have tried.
B005IHAIMA,1,1,It flips up and out away from the camera body so you can hold it at waist or chest height or above your head and still have a perfect view of the screen (45 degrees down/80 degrees up).
B005IHAIMA,1,2,I recommend getting a screen protector.
B005IHAIMA,1,3,Also the screen is susceptible to scratches.
B005IHAIMA,1,4,High quality, continuous focus, and really fun to use.Build quality - This tiny body with tilting touch lcd screen can survive a fall from about 3 or 4 feet high and land flat on the screen and be okay.
B005IHAIMA,1,5,You can customize 3 of the buttons on the back of the camera, and that helps tremendously, but there are still several things I wish were more readily available without fumbling through the menu.There is no viewfinder so you must frame your photos using the LCD screen, which can be difficult in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,1,6,The small size isn't a bad thing for me because I have medium sized hands and the camera was reasonably easy to grip with my right hand.A really nice feature of this camera is the tilt-able touch-screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,7,Initially, I was impressed with the thought of a touch screen camera because I am a Smartphone user and have grown to love touch screens, but after testing I really prefer not to use it on this camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,8,This camera really does a nice job and the end result is much better than my trusty P&S.;I took this opportunity to test most of the functions on the camera and found that I really had no use for the touch screen.
B005IHAIMA,1,9,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,1,10,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.
B005IHAIMA,1,11,Pictures and video do look great, and I love the way it handles.
B005IHAIMA,1,12,I think the touch screen on my 4 year old, off brand GPS unit works better.While I was browsing through the menus, I viewed the setup options for video recording.
B005IHAIMA,1,13,In fact, I love it even though it's kind of a gimmick.The so-so:Screen tilt - It barely tilts enough to be of any real use to me.
B005IHAIMA,1,14,The metal construction is great.
B005IHAIMA,1,15,That is kind of cool, but pricey.The body - The camera body is small, sleek, and built well.
B005IHAIMA,1,16,I would highly recommend it to those inquiring about it, but acknowledge it is not for everyone.
B005IHAIMA,1,17,I am not a photographer, just a picture taker who appreciates good image quality.
B005IHAIMA,1,18,Newer models, like 5T fully tilt so you can do selfies.Touch screen - Using it to focus is cool.
B005IHAIMA,1,19,Without a lens attached, this camera was no bigger than an average sized P&S; and was as light as a feather.
B005IHAIMA,1,20,It is long, complicated (for me at least) and difficult to read with my tired old eyes.
B005IHAIMA,1,21,;-)* The screen is very hard to use in direct sunlight.
B005IHAIMA,1,22,It is a quirky camera but the more you use it and get use to it the more you will love it.
B005IHAIMA,1,23,Still, it is a good quality lens that I am happy using, though at a higher price point (5r, natch) I might grumble more about the slowness/sharpness.I found the grip on the camera and the general feel to be good and had no problems in this area.The screen is pretty good in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,1,24,The lens looks like it is hulking out and the hand grip, while useful, isn't pretty.
B005IHAIMA,2,0,The 5 is a wonderful little camera and what makes it a winner for me is the amazing image quality.
B005IHAIMA,2,1,I started with the Nex 3, upgraded to the 5 and now have a 7 pre ordered.
B005IHAIMA,2,2,Nice image quality; poor autofocus.
B005IHAIMA,2,3,A view finder, which is lacking, would be a great help.The stabilization is not as good as on the Panasonic FZ150 and I find that with the Sony, my videos are pretty "wobbly."
B005IHAIMA,2,4,They buy expensive lenses and brag about their gear, but that means nothing if you can't use it.This camera works wonders when you learn how to use it.
B005IHAIMA,2,5,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,2,6,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,2,7,007'S DSLR/ILC.
B005IHAIMA,2,8,This camera takes great photos.
B005IHAIMA,2,9,I am upgraded from the M43 and I would say I am very satisfied with it.
B005IHAIMA,2,10,I am not a photographer, just a picture taker who appreciates good image quality.
B005IHAIMA,2,11,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,2,12,Pictures and video do look great, and I love the way it handles.
B005IHAIMA,2,13,Love what it can do but not perfect.
B005IHAIMA,2,14,I feel better having done that.
B005IHAIMA,2,15,In time its shortcomings (primarily slow repeat shooting and poor autofocus) came to really bug me and I've moved on to better cameras.
B005IHAIMA,2,16,Nice in bright light and the tilt feature helps even more.Focus peaking makes it easier to manual focus.
B005IHAIMA,2,17,The new firmware upgrade makes the Nex series much easier to navagate.
B005IHAIMA,2,18,Compare it to your best Canon DSLR and see who wins.
B005IHAIMA,2,19,The tm700 has a better stabalizer, not much, and focuses faster, again minor but noticeable.
B005IHAIMA,2,20,I dont know exactly what it is but they look amazing compared to the old.
B005IHAIMA,2,21,I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2.
B005IHAIMA,2,22,I can't return the camera but I will return the 18-200 lens.
B005IHAIMA,2,23,A great camera for photographing, but not for video recording.
B005IHAIMA,2,24,There is no camera in the world that's perfect, so I can certainly find some negatives.
B005IHAIMA,3,0,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,3,1,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,3,2,A great camera for photographing, but not for video recording.
B005IHAIMA,3,3,I am not a photographer, just a picture taker who appreciates good image quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,4,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,3,5,Build quality is excellent.
B005IHAIMA,3,6,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,3,7,If you wnat a small package and great quality this is it.
B005IHAIMA,3,8,Good for still photo.
B005IHAIMA,3,9,It makes a great travel camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,10,It is a good street/travel camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,11,It's quite good for what it is.
B005IHAIMA,3,12,Excellent still photos but the clicking problem in the video makes it not worth the money.
B005IHAIMA,3,13,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,14,Its best feature is the HD video with exceptionally good audio quality, but if your intention is to shoot long videos DON'T, as the camera will OVERHEAT and automatically shut down after about 15 minutes of operation.
B005IHAIMA,3,15,You can put the focus precisely where you want it, which is great when shooting wide-open.
B005IHAIMA,3,16,Sony customer service doesn't have a great track record, but I am willing to be surprised.I already had recommended the camera to several friends.Not any more.
B005IHAIMA,3,17,Had to turn off and turn on again.Overall, I am HIGHLY recommended this camera to anyone looking to purchase a camera with DSRL-like image quality and ability to shoot 1080p 60p/24p video.
B005IHAIMA,3,18,That makes the NEX-5N into a very good street photography camera.That's a lot of rambling to say that this is a good camera for experienced photographers, within limits.
B005IHAIMA,3,19,This is untrue, of course, as the clicking problem occurs if you move the camera at all during video recording.
B005IHAIMA,3,20,For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,3,21,Still, the flash quirk aside, this is a great camera for traveling or walking around.
B005IHAIMA,3,22,But video recording is a major feature of this camera, and the clicking sound makes video recording largely useless, so keeping the camera in its current form was not an option for me.I sent the camera to Sony's service center in Laredo, Texas, and it came back from Sony in a nice brown box, professionally packaged.
B005IHAIMA,3,23,But, instead, the children heard that first click (then continuously hear the clicks)and turn and look at me instead of doing what they were doing that I wanted to take a photo of.
B005IHAIMA,3,24,Both very nice.
B005IHAIMA,4,0,This camera takes great photos.
B005IHAIMA,4,1,Only took 250 shots so far.
B005IHAIMA,4,2,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,4,3,No auto ISR on Manual mode (some DSLR's will let you do this).Overall,
B005IHAIMA,4,4,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,4,5,That's great for the panoramic mode, HDR mode, or sports.The gimmicks - Yes, the art filters, hdr mode, panoramic mode, and tilting toucnscreen are fun.
B005IHAIMA,4,6,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.
B005IHAIMA,4,7,The touchsceen is nice and the Auto mode is excellent.I have the kit lens and the 55-210.
B005IHAIMA,4,8,This is the only scene mode I use.Good feature set and manual controls - P/A/S/M - allows me to control my shots when doing more than casual snap shots.Touchscreen interface, once familiarized, is easy to use.Cons:Contrast detect AF struggles in very low light / night shots.
B005IHAIMA,4,9,Nice in bright light and the tilt feature helps even more.Focus peaking makes it easier to manual focus.
B005IHAIMA,4,10,The Sweep Panorama feature is great, but again, unless there is optimal lighting at ALL ranges the resulting image will be disappointing.
B005IHAIMA,4,11,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.
B005IHAIMA,4,12,People have looked at my photos and asked me what camera I use and are shocked when they see it.
B005IHAIMA,4,13,It doesn't happen to a lot of photos, but does happen.
B005IHAIMA,4,14,I got better results with iAuto or Scene modes than w PASM.
B005IHAIMA,4,15,I manual focus when I do landscape work and it makes it easy to use my M mount lenses.Cons would be.
B005IHAIMA,4,16,Almost Great.
B005IHAIMA,4,17,There are effects in fully auto mode that I love.
B005IHAIMA,4,18,The "auto" mode actually works fairly well for general use, but you'll want to learn manual mode to create exactly what you want.
B005IHAIMA,4,19,I noticed that sometimes in auto mode, it would choose to not flash, and instead crank up ISO to 1600 or even 3200 for a shot.I have not yet experienced the clicking type sound that some earlier purchasers have experienced, but i'll try some different scenarios, and see if mine is ok.Overall, I am very happy with this camera,  It's light, it's fast, and it takes good photos (even when the light doesn't agree).
B005IHAIMA,4,20,It has a great lcd screen and the best of any of the mirrorless cameras I have tried.
B005IHAIMA,4,21,The 5 is a wonderful little camera and what makes it a winner for me is the amazing image quality.
B005IHAIMA,4,22,I've had this camera for a few days now, and have taken probably 45 photos.
B005IHAIMA,4,23,This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings.
B005IHAIMA,4,24,The panoramic setting is a little finicky.
B005IHAIMA,5,0,I also noticed the same exact spots when is happened to use iso 100 and 1 second shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,5,1,(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,5,2,I can set the aperture to the minimum with Auto ISO but then the camera will favor something like 1/60s.)
B005IHAIMA,5,3,This is especially frustrating with ISO given that one of the best features of this camera is its ISO capabilities.4.
B005IHAIMA,5,4,The most important for me is that it does not have a mode that in I can shoot in RAW while having a minimum shutter of at least, say, 1/125s for shooting my kids activities.
B005IHAIMA,5,5,The images are superb, the start up time and shooting speed are fast!
B005IHAIMA,5,6,The first time I noticed it the iso was 3200.
B005IHAIMA,5,7,I'd wager that a good 20% of shots will be missed by anyone using this camera until they learn how to compensate for this issue by using a higher ISO than should be needed or using the shutter priority setting or whatever else.
B005IHAIMA,5,8,The same shot with 800 iso had no trace of the spots.
B005IHAIMA,5,9,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,5,10,Yes, beautiful photos, fast continuous shooting.
B005IHAIMA,5,11,No aperture control ring - its tedious to change F-Stops and Shutter speed simultaneously through the control ring - also the previews of the aperture change is not as accurate as even a lower-end DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,5,12,The shutter response is nice and fast, and in burst mode can shoot a lot a photos in just a few seconds.I really like how much smaller an lighter this camera is.
B005IHAIMA,5,13,So, I cannot takes photos at weddings with this camera, I cannot take photos at sports events (Golf mainly) with this camera and cannot take photos of my grandchildren with this camera.
B005IHAIMA,5,14,The grandchildren will be playing nicely together and I want a candid shot of them and with the super fast continuous I could take several photos of them.
B005IHAIMA,5,15,There are no visible spots or dust under iso 3200 and faster than 1 second.
B005IHAIMA,5,16,I've had this camera for a few days now, and have taken probably 45 photos.
B005IHAIMA,5,17,Very small lag on the shutter.
B005IHAIMA,5,18,There is no lag whatsoever from when the shutter is pressed and released!
B005IHAIMA,5,19,Low noise at high iso as well.
B005IHAIMA,5,20,It focuses fast enough though there has been a time or two af has failed me.
B005IHAIMA,5,21,The 5 is a wonderful little camera and what makes it a winner for me is the amazing image quality.
B005IHAIMA,5,22,Changing some of the settings involves diving into menus (ISO, HDR, etc).
B005IHAIMA,5,23,The following are the big problems:1.
B005IHAIMA,5,24,Photos taken in Program Auto, Aperture Priority and Shutter Priority are pretty nice and you have a wide variety of creative effects to use to improve your photos.The camera does have many frustrating limitations.
B005IHAIMA,6,0,007'S DSLR/ILC.
B005IHAIMA,6,1,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,6,2,I used a SDHC Class 10 16GB card and have had wonderful results.Highly recommend to any individual that wants to slowly step up to a DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,6,3,Glad i bought it.I paid $623 on EBAY and mine came with a 18/55MM Lens, flash, a small SONY tote bag, 4GB SD Card, and charger/battery.
B005IHAIMA,6,4,The camera is so good with low light that I almost never use the flash, but because the flash comes with a little plastic case that attaches right to the camera strap, the flash is always handy if needed.The bottom line:  I LOVE this camera, and though the menu is cumbersome I'd still buy it again because the low light capabilities are awesome.
B005IHAIMA,6,5,A STEAL!!Buy it, get yourself a lens hood, some lens filters, the new holga effect lenses, or the awesome sony lenses, a 4G SD card (takes up to 800 shots all you need trust me), a carrying case for it (recommend Case Logic SLRC-205), the flash, and the viewfinder if you feel you'll need them.Cant be used with photoshop out of the box, but check the web, there are downloads to get around that type of thing.
B005IHAIMA,6,6,No built in viewfinder - you can buy one for $250 extra but I don't want to spend $250 on a viewfinder - a viewfinder and an extra lens take this camera up to 7N territory in cost which has a lot more than just the viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,6,7,There is not a viewfinder included; one can be purchased separately right here on Amazon for 274 dollars.
B005IHAIMA,6,8,And the camera has what appears to be a pretty good built in help system.P.S.
B005IHAIMA,6,9,So there, they have satisfied the P&S; crowd of mom, dads, and occasional shooters who only use thier cameras on vacation.If you are a hobbyist or professional photog, you have the choice of buying the viewfinder and flash and different lenses making this little thing a pretty formidable choice for the compact DSLR market.It goes both ways on the ILC/DSLR front.SONY is trying to make everyone happy on this one.
B005IHAIMA,6,10,It packed with 16.1MP APS-C sensor, can record full 1080p 60p/24p, full manual control, 10fps, touch screen, picture effects, fast start up time, super quiet and fast focus....and so on.Reason why I give it a 4 star instead of 5:I wish the body is a little wider taller than the lensNo standard hotshoeNo built in flash (It would be nice to make a camera a little wider and taller with built-in popup flash)No built in EVF (I careless about this because it will make the camera cost more, but its nice to implemented without to increase the price) :)No AF/MF button on the 18-55mm kit lensNo in-body Image Stabilizer like the Alpha Series (Why not SONY?
B005IHAIMA,6,11,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,6,12,IT is too expensive for not being a DSLR and every thing that is standard on other digital cameras needs to be purchased separately; down to the viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,6,13,Sony 2-, Amazon 5+ I have mixed thoughts about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,6,14,I've also ordered the 50 1.8 lens, and am looking forward to it.
B005IHAIMA,6,15,FANTASTIC for low light, such as in restaurants.
B005IHAIMA,6,16,I am loving the pictures I'm getting of my children.
B005IHAIMA,6,17,You buy a $600 camera and the stupid developers can't even implement sequential file numbers for video files--only photos.
B005IHAIMA,6,18,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,6,19,The include flash...is a flash.
B005IHAIMA,6,20,This can be improved by adjusting the brightness setting, or for $300+ you can purchase an add-on electronic viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,6,21,The touchsceen is nice and the Auto mode is excellent.I have the kit lens and the 55-210.
B005IHAIMA,6,22,I was pretty much shooting blind; luckily my images came out without any glaring issues.
B005IHAIMA,6,23,It flips up and out away from the camera body so you can hold it at waist or chest height or above your head and still have a perfect view of the screen (45 degrees down/80 degrees up).
B005IHAIMA,6,24,The 5 is a wonderful little camera and what makes it a winner for me is the amazing image quality.
B005IHAIMA,7,0,Only took 250 shots so far.
B005IHAIMA,7,1,I also have a Canon G11 (which I love)This is a great in between a DSLR and a POcket cam.
B005IHAIMA,7,2,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,7,3,So close to greatness... First, I would like to note that I have owned digital cameras since 1999 including compacts, midsize and DSLRs.
B005IHAIMA,7,4,If you wnat a small package and great quality this is it.
B005IHAIMA,7,5,It was a no-brainer, especially because it out specs most of the mirrorless competition.The Good:The sensor - APS-C sized, digital dx DSLR quality sensor at 16.1 MP, could possibly be the same or similar to the one in my old Nikon D7000.
B005IHAIMA,7,6,Both very nice.
B005IHAIMA,7,7,Compare it to your best Canon DSLR and see who wins.
B005IHAIMA,7,8,I love the quality of DSLRs but have felt that the size of the camera prevents me from taking it with me everywhere, essentially missing out a lot of great photos.
B005IHAIMA,7,9,I wanted something I could still fit in my purse and this is just on the larger side of fitting, but it still does.
B005IHAIMA,7,10,I used this for well over year now, a lot, and I think it's great.
B005IHAIMA,7,11,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,7,12,I seemed to take better pictures overall even though it was slightly larger.
B005IHAIMA,7,13,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.
B005IHAIMA,7,14,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,7,15,The 5 is a wonderful little camera and what makes it a winner for me is the amazing image quality.
B005IHAIMA,7,16,I reviewed this camera to the Nikon 1 J1 and ultimately went with this camera instead.
B005IHAIMA,7,17,You need to hold it to feel how small it isSolid construction.
B005IHAIMA,7,18,I thought I would be using the extra flash more then I am, but I'm still getting great pictures without it.
B005IHAIMA,7,19,It's very strongest plus is the high ISO image quality.
B005IHAIMA,7,20,Much lighter and smaller than a DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,7,21,That has turned out to be a good lens that gives me some of the compact size and image quality that I felt was lacking.
B005IHAIMA,7,22,Good detail.
B005IHAIMA,7,23,A very portable camera with very impressive results.
B005IHAIMA,7,24,Sony 2-, Amazon 5+ I have mixed thoughts about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,8,0,I'm okay with the kit lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,1,For a kit lens, I am impressed.
B005IHAIMA,8,2,Body Only: $600Tamron 17-50mm: $425 (after $75 rebate)Tamron 70-300mm: $350 (after $100 rebate)Total: $1,375.00CONCLUSIONNeedless to say, I ended up returning the NEX-5N, 50mm lens and adapter.
B005IHAIMA,8,3,007'S DSLR/ILC.
B005IHAIMA,8,4,Not exactly portable/pocket with the kit lens attached--you may have to get the 16mm pancake lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,5,I've also ordered the 50 1.8 lens, and am looking forward to it.
B005IHAIMA,8,6,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.
B005IHAIMA,8,7,NEX 5N vs NEX 7 vs NEX C3 vs other Mirrorless Cameras Mini Review.
B005IHAIMA,8,8,Until Sigma came out with their 30mm lens for the NEX system (Sigma 30mm F2.8 EX DN- Sony E 330965), I wasn't interested in the system.
B005IHAIMA,8,9,It's a very solid camera with very good picture quality and the kit lens is quite nice as well.
B005IHAIMA,8,10,While browsing for a new camera in Seoul, I was unsatisfied with every camera/price I found until I came across a used white Sony NEX 5n with the 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 lens for about $200 less than a new model.
B005IHAIMA,8,11,Both Tamron lenses cost less than the Sony 16-50mm lens and according to the reviews the difference in IQ, CA, distortion and vignetting was negligible!
B005IHAIMA,8,12,Other lenses are available, but not a lot.
B005IHAIMA,8,13,The lens looks like it is hulking out and the hand grip, while useful, isn't pretty.
B005IHAIMA,8,14,camera shipped with kit lens attached to the body, so NO rear lens cap and NO body cap are supplied.
B005IHAIMA,8,15,As of this review, the following are the available E-Mount lenses for purchase:16mm (SEL16F28); 24mm Zeiss (SEL25F18Z); 30mm Macro (SEL30M35; 50mm (SEL50F18); 18-55mm (SEL1855); 55-210mm (SEL55210); 18-200mm (SEL18200 & SEL18200LE); Sigma 19mm (400965); Sigma 30mm (330965); Tamron 18-200mm (AFB011-700 & AFB011S-700); Kenko 400mm (KE4008K4); Various fisheye lenses from Bower, Rokinon, Samyang, YasuharaSony is scheduled to release the following lenses within the next few months: 35mm (SEL35F18); 10-18mm (SEL1018); 16-50mm (SELP1650)My plan was to purchase the Sony 16-50mm (SAL1650) and the Sony 55-200mm (SAL55200-2) lenses, but the only problem was the 16-50mm lens is $800 new and the used ones on eBay were not offered by reputable sellers (BTW, the 55-200mm was going to be a temporary lens until I saved enough money for a Sony 70-300mm or 70-400mm G lens).Since the purchase of the 16-50mm lens, 55-200mm lens and LA-EA2 adapter would have set me back well over $1,000 I decided to do some more research for alternative lenses and ended up purchasing the Tamron 17-50mm (AF016M700) and the Tamron 70-300 (AFA005S-700).At first, I could not confirm that these lenses would work with the adapter, but was able to locate examples of people who had successfully paired these lenses with the adapter and NEX-5N camera.Also, at the time of purchase, Tamron offered a $75 MIR on the 17-50mm lens and a $100 MIR on the 70-300mm lens.
B005IHAIMA,8,16,It's a great camera with many of the same features as the NEX-5N and is about the same size and weight (if the adapter and lens was connected to the NEX-5N).
B005IHAIMA,8,17,The lens is a little bulky but hasn't been an issue.
B005IHAIMA,8,18,You can pay a boatload of cash for an adapter and pay another boatload of cash to use Sony Alpha dslr lenses.
B005IHAIMA,8,19,I found it to be uncomfortable to hold the lens because it was an extra 1-1.5 inches further from the camera, so I placed my hand under the adapter.
B005IHAIMA,8,20,I did consider the Sony NEX series, but shrugged it off because of the price (at  the time the kits that caught my eye were sub $1,000).
B005IHAIMA,8,21,I have taken to it pretty quick, and have also programmed the custom button settings to my liking.The kit lens seems on par to most kit lenses.
B005IHAIMA,8,22,none exist for the Sony E-mount lenes for now and none in the future roadmap sadly, the only small sony lens that exist is the 16mm F2.8 but it's too wide for a main lens for most people and it's not as sharp as i like until stopped down so not very friendly to use at night, the Panasonic 20mm F1.7 is great lens (not the best but for Size/performance it's great) if you want a pancake zoom? this might sound crazy but Panasonic is making a Pancake zoom lens with image stabilization too and so on,While it seems in theory that Sony can just release smaller lenses and win the best of both worlds, it doesn't seems like this is a concern for Sony right now, their 2012 lenses road map include 3 more huge zoom lenses and zero prime let alone a pancake lenses, the Sony upcoming 50mm F1.8 OSS while being very sharp from the samples i have seen (sharper than nikon/canon 50mm primes) it's actually BIGGER than both nikon and canon 50mm lenses for their DSLR which is puzzling to create a tiny body and never release tiny lenses for it at least as an option for those who rather use smaller lenses, Sony Officially unlocked their E-Mount to other lenses companies though so anyone can make Native E mount lens if they want, i only knows of Sigma upcoming E-Mount lens which is 30mm F2.8 small primeSo in short again depends on your use you might prefer m43 because of lenses choices over NEX, i can't get rid of m43 because wide shots is a MUST for me and none is available for sony as of now.About Samsung Mirrorless system, while the sensor size is the same as sony it's not as good as sony sensor (not even close) Samsung support is nowhere near sony or M43 too so I'm not interested in itFor manual lenses users NEX offer the best possibilities for you, you can adapt almost every lens using an adapter for manual focus lenses, using the Focus peaking/zoom functions make focusing a breeze and easy, the Offset microlenses is a huge bonus too, and lets not forget the crop factor (1.5X for NEX versus 2X for M43)Overall i recommend NEX 5n for anyone, it's hard to find anything similar in the market for the price right now (Amazing sensor/small camera/tilt LCD/shoots 1080p60 video/touchscreen/easy to use/etc), it does beat any Entry/mid range nikon/canon DSLR "IF" you are type of a person who just sticks to the zoom kit lens, NEX 5N got a better zoom Kit lens and the better sensor.I hope my thoughts about the mirrorless market for now was fair enough and i hope that my review was helpful :)
B005IHAIMA,8,23,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,8,24,Some more small prime lenses would help us a lot.
B005IHAIMA,9,0,It's very strongest plus is the high ISO image quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,1,I am not a photographer, just a picture taker who appreciates good image quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,2,The image quality of the 5n is amazing.
B005IHAIMA,9,3,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,9,4,You will be amazed by the photo quality this little camera provided.
B005IHAIMA,9,5,Also, it is very light in weight which helps.The color accuracy is very good.
B005IHAIMA,9,6,Low noise at high iso as well.
B005IHAIMA,9,7,Performance is great, colors, low light, ISO, WB, dynamic range and picture quality are all solid.
B005IHAIMA,9,8,The 5 is a wonderful little camera and what makes it a winner for me is the amazing image quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,9,Nice interchangeble lenses of good quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,10,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.
B005IHAIMA,9,11,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,9,12,I own a Canon 5DMKII and this camera produces images that compare with the results I get from the big Canon... highly recommended...
B005IHAIMA,9,13,The image is sharp and color is accurate.
B005IHAIMA,9,14,The Sweep Panorama feature is great, but again, unless there is optimal lighting at ALL ranges the resulting image will be disappointing.
B005IHAIMA,9,15,FANTASTIC for low light, such as in restaurants.
B005IHAIMA,9,16,This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings.
B005IHAIMA,9,17,Still, you can get great shots at extremely low light with amazing color that was just not possible at this price range until now.The kit lens is good and much better than I expected based upon some of the reviews I read.
B005IHAIMA,9,18,Love the images and the size.
B005IHAIMA,9,19,Easiest camera for casual shooters to get professional looking shots even in low light.
B005IHAIMA,9,20,Good detail.
B005IHAIMA,9,21,Nice camera - better than expected.
B005IHAIMA,9,22,Compare it to your best Canon DSLR and see who wins.
B005IHAIMA,9,23,I'm really enjoying it's strengths such as stunningly vivid daylight shots and excellent low light quality.
B005IHAIMA,9,24,I got it at the end of Jan 2012.
B005IHAIMA,10,0,Its been 2 years since I bought it and it still takes perfect pictures.
B005IHAIMA,10,1,Excellent camera for the price.
B005IHAIMA,10,2,I reviewed this camera to the Nikon 1 J1 and ultimately went with this camera instead.
B005IHAIMA,10,3,I used this for well over year now, a lot, and I think it's great.
B005IHAIMA,10,4,I am loving the pictures I'm getting of my children.
B005IHAIMA,10,5,The Sony NEX-5r has just come out and the price on this camera, the 5n, has dropped to around $500.
B005IHAIMA,10,6,I bought the Canon T3i and returned, Sony A65 and returned again.
B005IHAIMA,10,7,Great little camera.
B005IHAIMA,10,8,I love this camera.
B005IHAIMA,10,9,Solid Camera at Great Price.
B005IHAIMA,10,10,I bought this camera about a year and a half ago.
B005IHAIMA,10,11,I got this camera for a 6 month trip; I have a DSLR but didn't want to lug everything around.
B005IHAIMA,10,12,I purchase this camera, I already tried both T3i and A65 and both of them are returned.
B005IHAIMA,10,13,This camera takes great photos.
B005IHAIMA,10,14,Still Clickin' I just bought this camera last week (Aug 1).
B005IHAIMA,10,15,I started with the Nex 3, upgraded to the 5 and now have a 7 pre ordered.
B005IHAIMA,10,16,After doing a fair amount of research, I decided to buy the 5n due to a variety of stellar reviews and the hard to beat new price.
B005IHAIMA,10,17,The lightweight and features noted were enough to convince me that it could serve as a good back up and after reading the technical reviews posted by many I made my choice favoring the Sony over a Lumix with comparable features.
B005IHAIMA,10,18,I'm returning the camera to day to Best Buy.DO THE RIGHT THING SONY, RECALL YOUR DEFECTIVE CAMERA!DO THE RIGHT THING BEST BUY, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!DO THE RIGHT THING AMAZON, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!
B005IHAIMA,10,19,I've also ordered the 50 1.8 lens, and am looking forward to it.
B005IHAIMA,10,20,Compare it to your best Canon DSLR and see who wins.
B005IHAIMA,10,21,Sony is currently selling this camera for 499 plus tax (no where near as good as the current Amazon price) but I'll try my luck there since I do like the camera.P.S.
B005IHAIMA,10,22,The Sony NEX-5N must be the best camera value at the moment at these closeout prices.
B005IHAIMA,10,23,I will not ditch my DSLR for it--but I will give it to my wife once I am done with the trip so she has a camera.
B005IHAIMA,10,24,All in all an excellent camera for the price, but if spending a few hundred more (OK, several hundred more) for a camera doesn't bother you I would consider the NEX-7.
B005IHAIMA,11,0,This camera takes great photos.
B005IHAIMA,11,1,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,11,2,90 degrees up is a godsend for a variety of situations.THE NEUTRAL:The menu system takes a bit of getting used to, but once learned, is fairly easy to navigate.
B005IHAIMA,11,3,The image quality is excellent, the controls are good, as is the touch base menu system.
B005IHAIMA,11,4,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,11,5,For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,11,6,Shoots like a machine gunTouch screen allows touch focusingLovely peek focusing for those of you who like to tweak autofocusCons:User interface not great.
B005IHAIMA,11,7,I love the design and features.
B005IHAIMA,11,8,Super easy to handle, and maneuver with.
B005IHAIMA,11,9,I found using the manual controls more intuitive than the touch controls, but to each his own.The size of the camera with the kit lens verges on being too big, but manages to still feel compact enough.
B005IHAIMA,11,10,Great image quality in a small package.
B005IHAIMA,11,11,You need to hold it to feel how small it isSolid construction.
B005IHAIMA,11,12,This camera is NOT a POINT and SHOOT (didn't expect that it would be) and for the price should at least provide simple shooting capability and high quality images at its basic settings.
B005IHAIMA,11,13,Also, it is very light in weight which helps.The color accuracy is very good.
B005IHAIMA,11,14,The on screen functions take getting used to if you are already accustomed to a DSLR with analog wheels and buttons.
B005IHAIMA,11,15,It has all the power and more of some of the DSLR's you see in the entry level market.The
B005IHAIMA,11,16,Almost Great.
B005IHAIMA,11,17,With a quick button push and Sony's well thought out basic controls, I can quickly get to and change the settings I most often access.
B005IHAIMA,11,18,The image quality of the 5n is amazing.
B005IHAIMA,11,19,Very balanced.The moveable rear LCD is awesome for all photographers, but a gift for professionals.
B005IHAIMA,11,20,I do like to think of myself as an armature, and I am trying to learn more photography so I chose this camera to go with me.Pro: I live the small size of the body (not the lens--more on that later); I like that I can have either full control in manual vs other modes.
B005IHAIMA,11,21,Nice camera - better than expected.
B005IHAIMA,11,22,Its like holding a PS3 controller.
B005IHAIMA,11,23,If you wnat a small package and great quality this is it.
B005IHAIMA,11,24,Build quality is excellent.
B005IHAIMA,12,0,Takes great pics.
B005IHAIMA,12,1,Amazing Camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,2,I love this camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,3,Took amazing pics and easy to use.
B005IHAIMA,12,4,Great cam for taking videos and having always around.
B005IHAIMA,12,5,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,12,6,The video is also amazing, but it's only flaw is that is seems to overheat if the video runs continuously for longer than 4-5 minutes.
B005IHAIMA,12,7,Pictures and video do look great, and I love the way it handles.
B005IHAIMA,12,8,It also takes great pics and especially videos.But there are also a couple of flaws which spoil the overall experience.1.
B005IHAIMA,12,9,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.
B005IHAIMA,12,10,My conclusion is that the noise is likely not as pronounced in some models or some buyers may not be as concerned because they love the good quality pics it takes.I myself am leaning more towards keeping the 1st NEX-5N from Amazon since the camera seems to work well and I likely won't record videos as much.
B005IHAIMA,12,11,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,12,12,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,12,13,Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012.
B005IHAIMA,12,14,I've been reading the reviews so one of the first things I tried was the video!
B005IHAIMA,12,15,The image quality of the 5n is amazing.
B005IHAIMA,12,16,Some flaws too ... Well first and foremost it's a very nice camera.
B005IHAIMA,12,17,A good camera with a few flaws.
B005IHAIMA,12,18,If I can use it effectively (and all my pics have come out GREAT I must say) then most anyone could.
B005IHAIMA,12,19,Just had a baby and this camera was great to capture our memories.
B005IHAIMA,12,20,Major whiff on the part of Sony and basically keeps this camera from being truly great.
B005IHAIMA,12,21,I tried all three side by side and realized my first one from Amazon clicked considerably less than the other two (though obviously not perfect since it put me through all this adventure).So based on my personal experience temporarily owning 3 NEX-5Ns AND playing with one at Best Buy, I hesitate to believe that there are actually models out there with zero video recording issues.
B005IHAIMA,12,22,Almost Great.
B005IHAIMA,12,23,You buy a $600 camera and the stupid developers can't even implement sequential file numbers for video files--only photos.
B005IHAIMA,12,24,Right now I try to take videos with an external mic so it's less of an issue.
B005IHAIMA,13,0,Battery lasts for a while.
B005IHAIMA,13,1,I did not have time to confirm this.FIRST USEOnce the battery was fully charged, I reinstalled it into the camera and attached the 50mm E-Mount lens (SEL50F18).
B005IHAIMA,13,2,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,13,3,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,13,4,you'll get about 20 minutes of video before it shuts down.
B005IHAIMA,13,5,007'S DSLR/ILC.
B005IHAIMA,13,6,Luckily, I bought an extra battery as back up and that solves it.
B005IHAIMA,13,7,Before I venture out, the pack is fully charged and after a 45 minute school function I will be left with about 78 percent.
B005IHAIMA,13,8,You have to turn the camera off and turn it back on to start using it again.
B005IHAIMA,13,9,Supposedly, the battery needs to be fully charged the first time the camera is switched on.
B005IHAIMA,13,10,Not exactly efficient, but at least the menus are not hard to navigate or use.The Bad:Battery life - Perhaps I am spoiled, but when I go out for a whole day of shooting pictures and video, I expect the battery to last the whole day.
B005IHAIMA,13,11,A series of Sony Viao laptops drained their batteries even when the computer was off because there was a design failure and the battery circuit could not be closed.
B005IHAIMA,13,12,I figured the battery was dead, so I threw it on the charger.
B005IHAIMA,13,13,Possibly small ones.Battery life is pretty weak.
B005IHAIMA,13,14,If your battery is at 100% after about two minutes of any type of use with the camera it wil be down to 98%.Will last probably eight hours if you went out shooting all day, and made sure to turn it off when not in use.I've heard all the stories about these cameras clicking and overheating during recording a movie and almost didnt buy one because of, but ive not had any problem of the sort, but then again my longest short film is 3:00.I dont like the fact that the flash and viewfinder cannot be used in tandem.
B005IHAIMA,13,15,The battery door on the other cameras I've owned never had any sort of movement when closed.INITIAL START UPI slipped the battery and a 16GB SanDisk Extreme memory card into the camera (SDSDX-016G-X46).
B005IHAIMA,13,16,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,13,17,I had sent it in November to Precision camera for repairs and the work order showed that they had done some repair on LCD then.
B005IHAIMA,13,18,The camera has inconsistent problem of getting locked up when shooting.
B005IHAIMA,13,19,No more guessing and losing the perfect shot (happened so many times!) because 1/4 remaining battery equates to 2 percent!This is the first time that the auto modes actually work for me.
B005IHAIMA,13,20,Sony must give all us who face the problem a new camera because how I now can be sure that 1) the camera will be really fixed and 2) the fix is permanent and it does not fail after 2 months again.
B005IHAIMA,13,21,This should be equated into the total cost of ownership if a viewfinder is important to the consumer.The battery life seems good for now.
B005IHAIMA,13,22,I found it to be uncomfortable to hold the lens because it was an extra 1-1.5 inches further from the camera, so I placed my hand under the adapter.
B005IHAIMA,13,23,If I were just shooting pictures, it would last a few days, but the video is so good I can't resist.Microphone - This bugs me the most.
B005IHAIMA,13,24,This is REALLY disappointing and as much as I wanted to buy this camera, I will not and do not recommend to do so.
B005IHAIMA,14,0,You can customize 3 of the buttons on the back of the camera, and that helps tremendously, but there are still several things I wish were more readily available without fumbling through the menu.There is no viewfinder so you must frame your photos using the LCD screen, which can be difficult in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,14,1,;-)* The screen is very hard to use in direct sunlight.
B005IHAIMA,14,2,I like that you can adjust the screen for above/below views.
B005IHAIMA,14,3,Can be scratched easily as with all this new touch screen tech out here.
B005IHAIMA,14,4,The screen turns blue and flashes 'camera error'.
B005IHAIMA,14,5,Then one summer day last week, while taking some family photos, I touched the square on the touch screen to fix focus on my kid's face and the screen instantly developed a crack on the inside.Called Sony and explained the issue.
B005IHAIMA,14,6,Now please Sony, just put a better hinge on the LCD panel and a PC socket, so I can use it with a studio flash, this camera really deserves a five star rating... but the lack of flash connector and the limited hinge on the LCD panel are the big failures of the camera.. ....
B005IHAIMA,14,7,The camera does even have a single scratch on the body or the screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,8,No self portraits here.The screen brightness is pretty dim in sunlight unless you opt for a "sunny weather" setting which then becomes way too bright when you are inside.
B005IHAIMA,14,9,you can resolve this issue by removing the sticker behind the LCD screen and extending out the LCD screen so the camera can cool faster but that will void your warranty.
B005IHAIMA,14,10,Touchscreen cracked just by touching while trying to focus the object.
B005IHAIMA,14,11,I've had this camera for a few days now, and have taken probably 45 photos.
B005IHAIMA,14,12,Sony must give all us who face the problem a new camera because how I now can be sure that 1) the camera will be really fixed and 2) the fix is permanent and it does not fail after 2 months again.
B005IHAIMA,14,13,Within a day after the Sony Repair Center in Laredo received my camera, they left a voice mail on the phone that there is an estimate of $ 210.86 for physical damage.
B005IHAIMA,14,14,I had sent it in November to Precision camera for repairs and the work order showed that they had done some repair on LCD then.
B005IHAIMA,14,15,There are always stubborn streaks on the screen.
B005IHAIMA,14,16,However you can always see it enough to frame the image.*
B005IHAIMA,14,17,too bad sony screwed up the video recording.
B005IHAIMA,14,18,i was absolutely looking forward to this camera because it has a touch screen & 1080p recording.
B005IHAIMA,14,19,camera also overheats pretty easily when you're recording video.
B005IHAIMA,14,20,It's not a big deal, but I noticed that it will move ever so slightly with very little effort.
B005IHAIMA,14,21,Sony dropped the ball!
B005IHAIMA,14,22,sony does offer a free repair to help alleviate this issue but i don't want deal with the hassle.the
B005IHAIMA,14,23,I have also recently read that sony is making a hotshoe adapter to allow owners to use traditional SLR flash units, like my Canon 550EX.The adjustable live view screen works really well.
B005IHAIMA,14,24,I do very little direct flash lighting, so it's not something I would use much.I have ordered the optional flash, which has bounce options.
B005IHAIMA,15,0,If you buy the viewfinder then you cannot use the enclosed flash while the viewfinder is in use.
B005IHAIMA,15,1,I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2.
B005IHAIMA,15,2,No built in viewfinder - you can buy one for $250 extra but I don't want to spend $250 on a viewfinder - a viewfinder and an extra lens take this camera up to 7N territory in cost which has a lot more than just the viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,15,3,It's almost a return to cameras of the past with their split-screen viewfinders and MF-only lenses.
B005IHAIMA,15,4,The camera has inconsistent problem of getting locked up when shooting.
B005IHAIMA,15,5,The heft increases as you add the lens and a viewfinder if necessary.
B005IHAIMA,15,6,You can put the focus precisely where you want it, which is great when shooting wide-open.
B005IHAIMA,15,7,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,15,8,This makes manually focusing a lens a breeze and very quick, not to mention fun.
B005IHAIMA,15,9,The following are the big problems:1.
B005IHAIMA,15,10,This can be improved by adjusting the brightness setting, or for $300+ you can purchase an add-on electronic viewfinder.
B005IHAIMA,15,11,I can confirm that AF is extremely fast and accurate with this adapter...much faster than the 50mm E-Mount lens I tested.
B005IHAIMA,15,12,It's not enough to break the connection or cause AF problems, but it is noticeable.
B005IHAIMA,15,13,I've tried using an adapter for Canon lenses and they work ok but not great.
B005IHAIMA,15,14,Upon receiving this camera, I put it through its paces and I immediately noticed two firmware bugs that should have been obvious to Sony, if they had done proper testing.
B005IHAIMA,15,15,I found that the camera I received was the European version (PAL, 50i) and was extremely disappointed in the seller as they were supposed to send the US version (NTSC, 60i).
B005IHAIMA,15,16,Other than that you are stuck to either trying to utilize a hot shoe adapter + radio trigger, an external slave flash in manual mode and triggered optically (think Nikon SU-4), or else some sort of home-brew setup.
B005IHAIMA,15,17,The only big downside to this body is the lack of a true hot shoe (the new NEX-6 addressed this).
B005IHAIMA,15,18,Body Only: $600Tamron 17-50mm: $425 (after $75 rebate)Tamron 70-300mm: $350 (after $100 rebate)Total: $1,375.00CONCLUSIONNeedless to say, I ended up returning the NEX-5N, 50mm lens and adapter.
B005IHAIMA,15,19,I found it to be uncomfortable to hold the lens because it was an extra 1-1.5 inches further from the camera, so I placed my hand under the adapter.
B005IHAIMA,15,20,In time its shortcomings (primarily slow repeat shooting and poor autofocus) came to really bug me and I've moved on to better cameras.
B005IHAIMA,15,21,Even with the 18-55mm lens it doesn't feel bad.
B005IHAIMA,15,22,Video defect is not the only problem.
B005IHAIMA,15,23,It flips up and out away from the camera body so you can hold it at waist or chest height or above your head and still have a perfect view of the screen (45 degrees down/80 degrees up).
B005IHAIMA,15,24,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,16,0,Still Clicking Sound.
B005IHAIMA,16,1,Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012.
B005IHAIMA,16,2,There is an audio clicking problem for this new camera in video mode...
B005IHAIMA,16,3,Audio clicking problem in video mode.
B005IHAIMA,16,4,too bad sony screwed up the video recording.
B005IHAIMA,16,5,But back it goes to Sony for repair, since I'm now out of the return period.
B005IHAIMA,16,6,This explains why Sony is now collapsing rapidly.
B005IHAIMA,16,7,Defective after Sony Repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,8,Who knows, and at this point, who cares.After one more call to Sony, they said they would have a technician call me, but so far, no one has called.
B005IHAIMA,16,9,So I did.Same issue, still clicking, still unbearable.The photo quality is great, the video is unbearable, Sony service is the wort ever ever and ever.DO NOT BUY FOR NOW.
B005IHAIMA,16,10,I call back and Im told that I am already in line to get a call from a Tech.
B005IHAIMA,16,11,My first was returned before being aware of the Service Call issued by Sony for the clicking issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,12,I call Sony Service and reference the email about the expedited return and repair as well as my original repair #.
B005IHAIMA,16,13,I offer to provide links to two videos that exhibit the problem.
B005IHAIMA,16,14,Still clicks.
B005IHAIMA,16,15,The tech apparently is unaware of the issue as he immediately starts explaining that Sony has a Service Notice for the clicking.
B005IHAIMA,16,16,I received this Nex-5N on May 18. Somebody told me that clicking sound issue while video recording is solved so that I bought this camera.
B005IHAIMA,16,17,What's going on with Sony?
B005IHAIMA,16,18,This is untrue, of course, as the clicking problem occurs if you move the camera at all during video recording.
B005IHAIMA,16,19,I just called Sony and they confirmed that the issue is still there and that customers need to send their $700 cameras if they find the clicking issue.I asked them whether they can tell me a way to figure out whether the issue is still present but they said they cannot.
B005IHAIMA,16,20,The clicking is still an issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,21,My revised rating and review is based off the poor experience with Sony Technical Support and the repair of the issue.I contacted Sony Service using the repair number of my Service Call repair, after receiving my "repaired" 5n and noticing the new sound issue.
B005IHAIMA,16,22,Finally I contacted Sony support and they told me that the camera had to be sent in for repair.
B005IHAIMA,16,23,Video defect is not the only problem.
B005IHAIMA,16,24,The defect does not affect the picture quality of still images or video, but it does make the video recording feature unusable as the clicking noise is very noticeable.
B005IHAIMA,17,0,I like viewfinders in manual mode because they let me more effectively preview the shot before I take it.2.
B005IHAIMA,17,1,The camera works really well if you primarily want to use the intelligent auto setting or one of the screen settings.
B005IHAIMA,17,2,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,17,3,No auto ISR on Manual mode (some DSLR's will let you do this).Overall,
B005IHAIMA,17,4,The most important for me is that it does not have a mode that in I can shoot in RAW while having a minimum shutter of at least, say, 1/125s for shooting my kids activities.
B005IHAIMA,17,5,On top of that the camera has no AutoISO in full manual mode and AutoISO is limited to 100-3200.On a DSLR this is less of a problem since it's very quick to switch between A/S modes when the lighting changes.
B005IHAIMA,17,6,I can set the aperture to the minimum with Auto ISO but then the camera will favor something like 1/60s.)
B005IHAIMA,17,7,In DSLRs switching to manual mode opens up a whole set of opportunities and challenges as with this camera but M mode on this camera is a pain.
B005IHAIMA,17,8,As someone who usually shoots in aperture priority or manual mode, I'm used to making all the exposure decisions for my photos.
B005IHAIMA,17,9,In time its shortcomings (primarily slow repeat shooting and poor autofocus) came to really bug me and I've moved on to better cameras.
B005IHAIMA,17,10,The touch focusing and focus tracking are wonderful.One other thing that surprised me is how useful the intelligent auto setting has turned out.
B005IHAIMA,17,11,Also, I can change a lot of the settings that on regular point and shoots I couldn't change i.e. how long the picture review stays on.
B005IHAIMA,17,12,I was never able to figure out how I was doing this, but it happened enough times that I started to learn to check the exposure compensation setting if my pictures looked like they came out too dark in a light setting that should have been fine.
B005IHAIMA,17,13,When the light gets dim, I switch back to aperture priority and control the ISO settings.
B005IHAIMA,17,14,In a dark setting, I can take a photo with the Lx3 at 1/15 with little worry of motion blur.
B005IHAIMA,17,15,At the same time it's better than any DSLR for taking videos because of AF during videos.
B005IHAIMA,17,16,I'd wager that a good 20% of shots will be missed by anyone using this camera until they learn how to compensate for this issue by using a higher ISO than should be needed or using the shutter priority setting or whatever else.
B005IHAIMA,17,17,Switching modes is requires several button pressesLowlight auto focusing slow and very unreliableTouchscreen interface nearly useless.
B005IHAIMA,17,18,For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera.
B005IHAIMA,17,19,Nice image quality; poor autofocus.
B005IHAIMA,17,20,Plus, even in the program mode or intelligent auto you can make adjustments to the picture (you can adjust shutter speed by telling the thumb wheel).
B005IHAIMA,17,21,The intelligent auto setting doesn't understand tripods.Low light is another area where I've been pleased.
B005IHAIMA,17,22,Onto colors: It has been a joy shooting images where the colors pop out of the screen!
B005IHAIMA,17,23,But in comparison to the Lumix, where you can switch aspect ratios manually, switch shooting modes manually, and in general access everything you want a little easier, the Sony really loses in this area.It is somehow easy to accidentally adjust the settings on the camera to under-expose (exposure compensation).
B005IHAIMA,17,24,The following are the big problems:1.
B005IHAIMA,18,0,I also noticed the same exact spots when is happened to use iso 100 and 1 second shutter speed.
B005IHAIMA,18,1,They both involve the screen flickering about 1/2 second after you turn the camera off under different circumstances.
B005IHAIMA,18,2,The first time I noticed it the iso was 3200.
B005IHAIMA,18,3,If you do so, it will take you 5-10 seconds to stop the movie that is being recorded if your SD card is slow, wait for it to write to flash and resume normal shooting.
B005IHAIMA,18,4,The same shot with 800 iso had no trace of the spots.
B005IHAIMA,18,5,Very small lag on the shutter.
B005IHAIMA,18,6,The spots appeared several times more at iso 3200 in the exact same location in the frame and changing between 18-55 kit lens and f2.8/16 didn't effect the outcome.
B005IHAIMA,18,7,Charging took about 4 hours (which is normal) and then the camera fired right up.You will be prompted to set the date & time right away and then you can start enjoying your new toy.When you turn the camera off, the shutter may operate.
B005IHAIMA,18,8,I'd wager that a good 20% of shots will be missed by anyone using this camera until they learn how to compensate for this issue by using a higher ISO than should be needed or using the shutter priority setting or whatever else.
B005IHAIMA,18,9,In time its shortcomings (primarily slow repeat shooting and poor autofocus) came to really bug me and I've moved on to better cameras.
B005IHAIMA,18,10,In general controls are not very convenient and are easily messed up by accidental presses.2.
B005IHAIMA,18,11,Changing some of the settings involves diving into menus (ISO, HDR, etc).
B005IHAIMA,18,12,I can't return the camera but I will return the 18-200 lens.
B005IHAIMA,18,13,On this camera this requires using 3 additional steps.
B005IHAIMA,18,14,There is no lag whatsoever from when the shutter is pressed and released!
B005IHAIMA,18,15,No, but I enjoy this camera and it gets a solid 4 stars.
B005IHAIMA,18,16,And if you were using a larger lens (like the 70-300) taking your hand from the adapter to the lens could present a problem because you need to be 100% confident in your grip with your right hand since the camera is now front heavy.LA-EA2 PERFORMANCEAll the people that reviewed this adapter were not kidding when they said this thing offers exceptionally fast AF performance.
B005IHAIMA,18,17,This is especially frustrating with ISO given that one of the best features of this camera is its ISO capabilities.4.
B005IHAIMA,18,18,Good job at high ISO (low light).Con:
B005IHAIMA,18,19,I inserted the memory card into my laptop and was able to confirm that the images turned out good.
B005IHAIMA,18,20,Only took 250 shots so far.
B005IHAIMA,18,21,AF also appears to be too slow for taking pics of action.Overall given it's compactness I think it's great: it's just nowhere close to a decent DSLR for shooting pics of moving kids.
B005IHAIMA,18,22,Body Only: $600Tamron 17-50mm: $425 (after $75 rebate)Tamron 70-300mm: $350 (after $100 rebate)Total: $1,375.00CONCLUSIONNeedless to say, I ended up returning the NEX-5N, 50mm lens and adapter.
B005IHAIMA,18,23,I thought maybe there was a setting in the menu to switch from PAL to NTSC, so I referenced the manual and to make a long story short, there is not a way to change this.
B005IHAIMA,18,24,It takes startlingly great photos even in low light with no flash.Unfortunately mine still has the clicking noise issue when recording video.
B005IHAIMA,19,0,The include flash...is a flash.
B005IHAIMA,19,1,I inserted the memory card into my laptop and was able to confirm that the images turned out good.
B005IHAIMA,19,2,I've had this camera for a few days now, and have taken probably 45 photos.
B005IHAIMA,19,3,You can buy third-party adapters, but those look a little unstable for mounting a big flash unit to the camera.
B005IHAIMA,19,4,I've also ordered the 50 1.8 lens, and am looking forward to it.
B005IHAIMA,19,5,I do very little direct flash lighting, so it's not something I would use much.I have ordered the optional flash, which has bounce options.
B005IHAIMA,19,6,Sony does sell a larger flash compatible with the NEX-3 and -5 series, which is quite a bit bigger than the included kit flash.
B005IHAIMA,19,7,the screw that secures the attachment of the flash to the top of the camera battery is inaccessible to those that have big fingers!
B005IHAIMA,19,8,I was not able to attach the flash at all and it kept breaking the contact, consequently the flash would not fire.
B005IHAIMA,19,9,The following items were included along with the camera: warranty card, paper manual for the NEX-3/NEX-3C/NEX-5/NEX-5C, software disk, neck strap, usb cable, battery and charger and flash accessory with its respectable case.FIRST IMPRESSIONSI knew this camera was going to be small and compact, but when I took it out of its protective bag, it was even smaller than I anticipated.
B005IHAIMA,19,10,So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?
B005IHAIMA,19,11,I also found that the flash unit tends to hang up on the door over the hot shoe which makes it difficult to install in dim light, which of course is when one needs the flash, but this is a minor quibble.
B005IHAIMA,19,12,Also, the use of the small flash unit tends to produce "flare" or "burnt" casting and has a range limitation (expected) but flares within the 6' range.
B005IHAIMA,19,13,The mounting for the flash unit is also prone to coming loose and requires constant attention before any use.
B005IHAIMA,19,14,great camera, but it has one problem that is fatal, the flash design is flawed.
B005IHAIMA,19,15,If you use an add on viewfinder, you have to remove the flash because they both use the only attachment fixture...so it's either flash OR viewfinder, but not both at the same time.
B005IHAIMA,19,16,Now please Sony, just put a better hinge on the LCD panel and a PC socket, so I can use it with a studio flash, this camera really deserves a five star rating... but the lack of flash connector and the limited hinge on the LCD panel are the big failures of the camera.. ....
B005IHAIMA,19,17,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again.I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back.
B005IHAIMA,19,18,I must have mistaken this feature from some other camera I was researching.At this time, the only real negative I can find is the battery door.
B005IHAIMA,19,19,You should have no problem trying to get "that shot" if this adapter is part of your system.PRACTICALITYI would assume that the average user who purchased this camera with the 18-55mm lens (and possibly the 55-210mm lens) would not be disappointed.
B005IHAIMA,19,20,However there are a few downsides:* The video button is in a very unfortunate place and cannot be disabled, so I have drained my battery a couple of times by accidentally capturing 20 minutes of video of the inside of my bag.*
B005IHAIMA,19,21,Glad i bought it.I paid $623 on EBAY and mine came with a 18/55MM Lens, flash, a small SONY tote bag, 4GB SD Card, and charger/battery.
B005IHAIMA,19,22,Attaching/swapping a mic or a flash requires quite long and annoying process.4.
B005IHAIMA,19,23,Its back to precision camera again after it got completely locked up day before yesterday .I used to like the camera.. its versatility and size and features and I have made substantial investment in various lenses including the 18-200 and the new bigger flash, but I am now beginning to question the reliability of its mechanics.
B005IHAIMA,19,24,:)  It's direct only, and doesn't provide any bounce option.
B005IHAIMA,20,0,With my Nikon P100 I had 26X optical zoom with wide angle lens.
B005IHAIMA,20,1,I would be able to sit on my terrace and zoom in across the street at the neighbors pear tree and actual pears.
B005IHAIMA,20,2,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,20,3,I had a Canon T1i for about 2 years Good camera- BUT too bulky to take all the time.
B005IHAIMA,20,4,This was an upgrade from a Nikon P100 model.
B005IHAIMA,20,5,I upgraded from a super-zoom (lumix fz35).
B005IHAIMA,20,6,007'S DSLR/ILC.
B005IHAIMA,20,7,Although I do have some previous knoweledge and experience with DSLR cameras both digital and film.
B005IHAIMA,20,8,Finally, it's clunky... not like a true DSLR but something to get used to from your little cute point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,20,9,I do see that these lenses are far better and truly stabilize on even the furthest zoom, where the aforementioned would have shake in the image.The camera is 95 percent menu driven and accessed by the touchscreen.
B005IHAIMA,20,10,So far this camera delivers.The cons will be that there are not many lenses available and they are steep in price.
B005IHAIMA,20,11,BACKGROUND & RESEARCHI've owned Pentax, Nikon and Panasonic P&S; cameras and a Canon DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,20,12,The image quality would not disappoint even the professional.
B005IHAIMA,20,13,When the Sony came around I still wasn't confident enough even though it isn't a true DSLR.
B005IHAIMA,20,14,Even with the 18-55mm lens it doesn't feel bad.
B005IHAIMA,20,15,I was pretty much shooting blind; luckily my images came out without any glaring issues.
B005IHAIMA,20,16,Big Step up from P&S; This is my first mirror-less camera.
B005IHAIMA,20,17,These cameras served their purpose, but all were ditched except the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5 because of its 10x zoom, IQ, ease of use and convenience vs. a big DSLR.Fast forward 2-3 years...The TZ5 went on many adventures, had been dropped more than a few times (never by me of course) and AF performance suffered.
B005IHAIMA,20,18,At the end of the day it will all be forgotten as you are awed by the images taken with your hands.
B005IHAIMA,20,19,I wanted something smaller that I can take anywhere.
B005IHAIMA,20,20,It can take 5 steps or more to reach the desired location or certain function.
B005IHAIMA,20,21,I own a Canon 5DMKII and this camera produces images that compare with the results I get from the big Canon... highly recommended...
B005IHAIMA,20,22,That camera was a step up from a digital because of it's manual capabilities.
B005IHAIMA,20,23,Its been 2 years since I bought it and it still takes perfect pictures.
B005IHAIMA,20,24,I love taking photos of the kiddies/family throughout the year.
B005IHAIMA,21,0,I wish the lens cap had a leash.
B005IHAIMA,21,1,Body Only: $600Tamron 17-50mm: $425 (after $75 rebate)Tamron 70-300mm: $350 (after $100 rebate)Total: $1,375.00CONCLUSIONNeedless to say, I ended up returning the NEX-5N, 50mm lens and adapter.
B005IHAIMA,21,2,camera shipped with kit lens attached to the body, so NO rear lens cap and NO body cap are supplied.
B005IHAIMA,21,3,As of this review, the following are the available E-Mount lenses for purchase:16mm (SEL16F28); 24mm Zeiss (SEL25F18Z); 30mm Macro (SEL30M35; 50mm (SEL50F18); 18-55mm (SEL1855); 55-210mm (SEL55210); 18-200mm (SEL18200 & SEL18200LE); Sigma 19mm (400965); Sigma 30mm (330965); Tamron 18-200mm (AFB011-700 & AFB011S-700); Kenko 400mm (KE4008K4); Various fisheye lenses from Bower, Rokinon, Samyang, YasuharaSony is scheduled to release the following lenses within the next few months: 35mm (SEL35F18); 10-18mm (SEL1018); 16-50mm (SELP1650)My plan was to purchase the Sony 16-50mm (SAL1650) and the Sony 55-200mm (SAL55200-2) lenses, but the only problem was the 16-50mm lens is $800 new and the used ones on eBay were not offered by reputable sellers (BTW, the 55-200mm was going to be a temporary lens until I saved enough money for a Sony 70-300mm or 70-400mm G lens).Since the purchase of the 16-50mm lens, 55-200mm lens and LA-EA2 adapter would have set me back well over $1,000 I decided to do some more research for alternative lenses and ended up purchasing the Tamron 17-50mm (AF016M700) and the Tamron 70-300 (AFA005S-700).At first, I could not confirm that these lenses would work with the adapter, but was able to locate examples of people who had successfully paired these lenses with the adapter and NEX-5N camera.Also, at the time of purchase, Tamron offered a $75 MIR on the 17-50mm lens and a $100 MIR on the 70-300mm lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,4,I cleaned the lens and sensor, but the spots remained.
B005IHAIMA,21,5,You should have no problem trying to get "that shot" if this adapter is part of your system.PRACTICALITYI would assume that the average user who purchased this camera with the 18-55mm lens (and possibly the 55-210mm lens) would not be disappointed.
B005IHAIMA,21,6,I got it at the end of Jan 2012.
B005IHAIMA,21,7,Even with the 18-55mm lens it doesn't feel bad.
B005IHAIMA,21,8,But since the current E-Mount lens line-up is not impressive and you need an adapter and the purchase of the body only from a trusted seller like Amazon is another $150 than what I paid, it just doesn't make sense for me to keep this camera.CHECK OUT THE MATH (Amazon Pricing)NEX-5N Body Only: $500LA-EA2 Adapter: $275Tamron 17-50mm: $425 (after $75 rebate)Tamron 70-300mm: $350 (after $100 rebate)Total: $1,550.00STL-A57
B005IHAIMA,21,9,To combat this, you need to hold the adapter or lens with your left hand.
B005IHAIMA,21,10,I unboxed it, attached a lens and tried the 2 settings (iso 3200 on a light background and then 1 second exposure on blue sky) that revealed the sensor spots I've had an issue with and similar spots appeared on this camera too.
B005IHAIMA,21,11,The spots were more definite when the lens I was using was stopped down below f10.
B005IHAIMA,21,12,Both Tamron lenses cost less than the Sony 16-50mm lens and according to the reviews the difference in IQ, CA, distortion and vignetting was negligible!
B005IHAIMA,21,13,I also bought 16mm lens.
B005IHAIMA,21,14,For all other routine purposes for a normal user, 18-55mm kit lens will deliver the same results.2.
B005IHAIMA,21,15,A dust cap was placed over the sensor opening for shipment, but otherwise, as far as I can tell nothing was done to it.
B005IHAIMA,21,16,It could be also that the N has lens correction.
B005IHAIMA,21,17,The spots appeared several times more at iso 3200 in the exact same location in the frame and changing between 18-55 kit lens and f2.8/16 didn't effect the outcome.
B005IHAIMA,21,18,It works, but it's very harsh and does not cover the image all that evenly and has a very short range.
B005IHAIMA,21,19,The same shot with 800 iso had no trace of the spots.
B005IHAIMA,21,20,Yes, these lenses would probably be good for the average user, but I am far from the average user and want the best for my budget.Note: A-Mount lenses will only work with the NEX-5N if the Sony LA-EA1 ($140) or LA-EA2 ($275) adapter is used.LENSESEven though the selection of E-Mount lenses is limited, a wide variety of focal lengths are covered.
B005IHAIMA,21,21,This is only noticeable if you're trying to take a a quick picture of something... by the time you've taken off the lens cap and started up the camera the shot will be missed.The focus isn't particularly fast or good.
B005IHAIMA,21,22,I tested with kit lens taking the same photos in both auto mode.
B005IHAIMA,21,23,I was under the impression that the NEX-5N body only was offered from Sony in its respectable box and not one that was separated from the kit lenses.
B005IHAIMA,21,24,I used the setup cleaning mode to no effect and I've only used it in pristine condition and for only a month so we'll see.as of 3/30/2012I purchased a cleaning kit for the sensor and was able after 20 or so passes with the various pads and wipes to remove all the spots.
B005IHAIMA,22,0,Low noise at high iso as well.
B005IHAIMA,22,1,The quality is good.
B005IHAIMA,22,2,The image quality of the 5n is amazing.
B005IHAIMA,22,3,Good job at high ISO (low light).Con:
B005IHAIMA,22,4,Performance is great, colors, low light, ISO, WB, dynamic range and picture quality are all solid.
B005IHAIMA,22,5,Nice image quality; poor autofocus.
B005IHAIMA,22,6,It takes startlingly great photos even in low light with no flash.Unfortunately mine still has the clicking noise issue when recording video.
B005IHAIMA,22,7,I've had this camera for a few days now, and have taken probably 45 photos.
B005IHAIMA,22,8,I have been able to take low light shots, indoor, sunny outdoor, nighttime etc. without any issues.
B005IHAIMA,22,9,Still, you can get great shots at extremely low light with amazing color that was just not possible at this price range until now.The kit lens is good and much better than I expected based upon some of the reviews I read.
B005IHAIMA,22,10,That's not to say that there is no noise, but at ISO3200, I can capture very pleasant photos, which I've never really been able to do before.
B005IHAIMA,22,11,Not great, but pretty good.
B005IHAIMA,22,12,Also, it is very light in weight which helps.The color accuracy is very good.
B005IHAIMA,22,13,For instance, a standard outdoor shot will show great color and detail throughout the image, from the pavement to the sky.
B005IHAIMA,22,14,The first time I noticed it the iso was 3200.
B005IHAIMA,22,15,It's very strongest plus is the high ISO image quality.
B005IHAIMA,22,16,In normal lighting situations, it did a great job, quite consistently.
B005IHAIMA,22,17,I started looking for a new camera, because I wanted better high ISO performance (I shoot a lot of photos in low light situations), and something lighter while still taking good photos.
B005IHAIMA,22,18,Non traditional hot shoe so I can't fire a wireless flash, quirky navagation, can't focus well in extreme low light, noisy shutter and self timer, dail on the back is easy to nudge a knock your settings off.Pros, amazing image quality and almost no noise up to and including 6400iso.
B005IHAIMA,22,19,I've also noticed it at home or anywhere there's not a particularly bright light source.
B005IHAIMA,22,20,Good for still photo.
B005IHAIMA,22,21,Still, it is a good quality lens that I am happy using, though at a higher price point (5r, natch) I might grumble more about the slowness/sharpness.I found the grip on the camera and the general feel to be good and had no problems in this area.The screen is pretty good in bright light.
B005IHAIMA,22,22,It totally beats the pants off of my T1i in low light with no flash.
B005IHAIMA,22,23,That has turned out to be a good lens that gives me some of the compact size and image quality that I felt was lacking.
B005IHAIMA,22,24,The camera takes beautiful photos and allows for some great effects within the camera if you don't want to edit your photo using PhotoShop or GIMP.
B005IHAIMA,23,0,Sony 2-, Amazon 5+ I have mixed thoughts about this camera.
B005IHAIMA,23,1,I got it at the end of Jan 2012.
B005IHAIMA,23,2,You can bet that when I buy another camera, it will be from Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,3,Still Clickin' I just bought this camera last week (Aug 1).
B005IHAIMA,23,4,So when I asked for a 3rd replacement they said the policy is 2 tries then refund so I'll be returning both after all.
B005IHAIMA,23,5,It was January 30, and I had one more day before Amazon's extended return period for the holidays ended.
B005IHAIMA,23,6,Too bad I have to return it to Amazon.
B005IHAIMA,23,7,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.
B005IHAIMA,23,8,I have returned the product.
B005IHAIMA,23,9,UPDATE: 21 FEB 2012: Amazon appears to be looking into this issue now - I believe they are intercepting/checking my return to verify this problem.
B005IHAIMA,23,10,My 30 day return period would have expired by the time I returned to the USA, but I chatted online with Amazon support and they arranged for an extension of the return period until I got home.
B005IHAIMA,23,11,I didn't pay $700 to get a defective camera that needed to be fixed.
B005IHAIMA,23,12,Ordered the black kit from Amazon (sold by Amazon)on March 1, 2012, received on 03/08/2012.
B005IHAIMA,23,13,Why the still sell this camera ???Don't buy it !
B005IHAIMA,23,14,I can't return the camera but I will return the 18-200 lens.
B005IHAIMA,23,15,They went out of their way to discuss this problem with me and immediately refunded my purchase.___________________________________________________________________________________________I
B005IHAIMA,23,16,Amazon was very good to me when I had to return once before (no strings), but if I had to do this now for clicking or suspicion, I'll have to pay for return shipment to Cameta.
B005IHAIMA,23,17,I bought my NEX-5N from Amazon and it arrived promptly on 10/17/2012.
B005IHAIMA,23,18,I'm returning the camera to day to Best Buy.DO THE RIGHT THING SONY, RECALL YOUR DEFECTIVE CAMERA!DO THE RIGHT THING BEST BUY, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!DO THE RIGHT THING AMAZON, STOP SELLING DEFECTIVE CAMERA FROM SONY!
B005IHAIMA,23,19,When I pointed out that the return was within their extended holiday return period, they gave me a credit for the restocking fee plus $50 for "good will."
B005IHAIMA,23,20,Do NOT BUY - DEFECTIVE.
B005IHAIMA,23,21,The second camera was ALSO bugged...What Amazon AND Sony doing?
B005IHAIMA,23,22,If they have, then Amazon is not getting fresh shipments because the camera that I just received (on March 12th, 2012) and ordered on March 8th, 2012 (sold by Amazon), still has the infuriating clicking problem with the sound in videos.
B005IHAIMA,23,23,I say "infuriating" because when paying $700 you don't expect to have to settle for a defective product.
B005IHAIMA,23,24,Something is fishy here and Sony should also provide enough of their product to the Tier 1 online vendors who are trustable.Watch out for this:1.
B005IHAIMA,24,0,With that being said, the touchscreen menu is rather fool/idiot-proof because there are instructions on each menu and even helpful tips on how that function would be useful.
B005IHAIMA,24,1,90 degrees up is a godsend for a variety of situations.THE NEUTRAL:The menu system takes a bit of getting used to, but once learned, is fairly easy to navigate.
B005IHAIMA,24,2,This wheel delves deeper into the menu option for specific functions.
B005IHAIMA,24,3,With a quick button push and Sony's well thought out basic controls, I can quickly get to and change the settings I most often access.
B005IHAIMA,24,4,Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.
B005IHAIMA,24,5,I do like to think of myself as an armature, and I am trying to learn more photography so I chose this camera to go with me.Pro: I live the small size of the body (not the lens--more on that later); I like that I can have either full control in manual vs other modes.
B005IHAIMA,24,6,I didnt even get a users manual with mine and it only took me 20minutes to go through all the menus and adjust settings to my liking.
B005IHAIMA,24,7,What I don't like is since the menus are only accessible via the touchscreen, it is a fingerprint, sweat and dirt magnet.
B005IHAIMA,24,8,The on screen functions take getting used to if you are already accustomed to a DSLR with analog wheels and buttons.
B005IHAIMA,24,9,Changing some of the settings involves diving into menus (ISO, HDR, etc).
B005IHAIMA,24,10,I thought maybe there was a setting in the menu to switch from PAL to NTSC, so I referenced the manual and to make a long story short, there is not a way to change this.
B005IHAIMA,24,11,I was skeptical about loosing some physical controls , such as the PASM dial and quick dial that the fz35 had, but once you get your way around and setup the soft buttons for easy access, I don't really miss the the fz35 anymore.I was trying to decide between this or the canon t3i as well as the d5100 but they are too bulky.
B005IHAIMA,24,12,That's just a small irk though.Hopefully this helps if you're a photography novice like I am.
B005IHAIMA,24,13,This is the camera I've been looking for for a long time.My camera does not suffer from the "clicking sound" some have trouble with during video shooting.Due to its very small size, there isn't room for a lot of buttons and dials, so most of the camera's settings have to be reached via a rather cumbersome on screen menu.
B005IHAIMA,24,14,I did setup the custom buttons which make the usage easy.
B005IHAIMA,24,15,I've been a point and shoot girl up til now but I decided to buy the Sony to start getting more into photography.
B005IHAIMA,24,16,Until Sigma came out with their 30mm lens for the NEX system (Sigma 30mm F2.8 EX DN- Sony E 330965), I wasn't interested in the system.
B005IHAIMA,24,17,I think the camera and lens looks comical.The menus - They make sense, but for the sake of simplicity with the button layout, sometimes you have to go in and out of the menus to get the settings you want.
B005IHAIMA,24,18,Menu is a little confusing for beginner.
B005IHAIMA,24,19,In your hands it feels like a small point and shoot.
B005IHAIMA,24,20,I hate being forced into nothing but touchscreen, I like the buttons most times on devices that aren't phones.
B005IHAIMA,24,21,So if you care about the aesthetics of a thing, then a black body with a silver lens with a grey flash starts to look a bit like Frankenstein's monster.Camera strap is adequate but a bit on the cheap side.No camera case is included.The menu system and camera controls are not very intuitive.
B005IHAIMA,24,22,The result is a "IMPROVEMENT" (read the word).
B005IHAIMA,24,23,If you are going from a straight point and shoot or even a model like the Nikon P100 then you will find my review helpful.
B005IHAIMA,24,24,The image quality is excellent, the controls are good, as is the touch base menu system.
B005IHAIMA,25,0,Sony must give all us who face the problem a new camera because how I now can be sure that 1) the camera will be really fixed and 2) the fix is permanent and it does not fail after 2 months again.
B005IHAIMA,25,1,My next camera will probably be a Nikon or a Canon, from a company that actually takes pride in their cameras.
B005IHAIMA,25,2,I have to explain that the camera has already been sent in for that issue and that the problem is something else.
B005IHAIMA,25,3,Clicking problem during video is still an issue 10/2012.
B005IHAIMA,25,4,Shame on you Sony.
B005IHAIMA,25,5,DO NOT BUY UNTIL SONY ADDRESSES CLICKING ISSUE.
B005IHAIMA,25,6,Sony admitted the issue but never provided a solution.
B005IHAIMA,25,7,I just called Sony and they confirmed that the issue is still there and that customers need to send their $700 cameras if they find the clicking issue.I asked them whether they can tell me a way to figure out whether the issue is still present but they said they cannot.
B005IHAIMA,25,8,In Sept. 2011, Sony has release an official statement that Sony will provide some video recording improvement for those affected NEX5Ns.(What
B005IHAIMA,25,9,You buy a $600 camera and the stupid developers can't even implement sequential file numbers for video files--only photos.
B005IHAIMA,25,10,The clicking is still an issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,11,I offer to provide links to two videos that exhibit the problem.
B005IHAIMA,25,12,However...When the camera is released, the video clicking issues has been widely reported.
B005IHAIMA,25,13,NEX-5N had some clikcing problems, which Sony offered replacements)Shame on Sony Retailer who sold this product to me.
B005IHAIMA,25,14,Atleast this is ok ) when i saw the camera, i didnt see any sony stickers to it(One for the APS-C sensor and other for the LCD screen), because when i looked for "NEX-5N unboxing" videos in youtube, i saw those sony stickers in the video.
B005IHAIMA,25,15,Still Clickin' I just bought this camera last week (Aug 1).
B005IHAIMA,25,16,Be aware if you want to use it to make home video.
B005IHAIMA,25,17,UPDATE: 21 FEB 2012: Amazon appears to be looking into this issue now - I believe they are intercepting/checking my return to verify this problem.
B005IHAIMA,25,18,Someone is Sony's quality and engineering department has not done their jobs well.
B005IHAIMA,25,19,Sony fails with NEX-5N, video with click out of the box.
B005IHAIMA,25,20,This explains why Sony is now collapsing rapidly.
B005IHAIMA,25,21,I bought the silver model and reviewed it before I discovered/heard off the clicking issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,22,will Sony do?
B005IHAIMA,25,23,My first was returned before being aware of the Service Call issued by Sony for the clicking issue.
B005IHAIMA,25,24,They only do ground shipment (to/from Laredo, Texas), which means that my brand new camera will probably be out of service for quite a while.To say the least, I'm disappointed with Sony.
B002IPHIEG,0,0,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,0,1,The battery has a decent life as well.
B002IPHIEG,0,2,I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.
B002IPHIEG,0,3,Battery life seems pretty good.So what's not to like about this camera?1.
B002IPHIEG,0,4,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,0,5,I used it as soon as I got the battery charged - and that, the battery, is the only thing I can say is a slight negative.
B002IPHIEG,0,6,battery life5.-touch
B002IPHIEG,0,7,Furthermore, surely, SONY could ALSO enable battery charging from the USB.6)
B002IPHIEG,0,8,Loved this camera - i had it for 1.5 - 2 yrs and i was good for several more years if it weren't for the evil rain that destroyed it.
B002IPHIEG,0,9,Only downside... battery only lasts about 80 minutes, but generics are cheap.
B002IPHIEG,0,10,Long story short, outdoor pics were great, the camera size was excellent, and battery life was out of this world.
B002IPHIEG,0,11,As soon as the battery charged, I started using the camera.
B002IPHIEG,0,12,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,0,13,here's the things I love about the camera:1.-
B002IPHIEG,0,14,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,0,15,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,0,16,Battery has to be taken out and charged externally, i prefer the ones which can be charged through usb therefore allowing you to copy photos while also charging the camera.
B002IPHIEG,0,17,The burst mode is decent, battery life could have been better.
B002IPHIEG,0,18,Takes up to 350 shots on a single charge!
B002IPHIEG,0,19,The battery charger is well designed with no cord so it is easy to carry around.
B002IPHIEG,0,20,I love this camera, this is my second in four years....I dropped the first from my horse.....This camera has a great slim design that fits well into a pocket...it takes great pictures and the batteries last a long time.
B002IPHIEG,0,21,It is packed with features and consistently puts out very decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,0,22,This camera is small enough to go any where you go and take decent quality photos.
B002IPHIEG,0,23,I bought an 8 gig card for it and it seems adequate so far.This is a great product that has really worked well for me.
B002IPHIEG,0,24,This little gem is about the size of a cell phone and takes very decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,1,0,Screen delamination or is it moisture haze?
B002IPHIEG,1,1,But the Touch Screen drove me crazy.
B002IPHIEG,1,2,Remarkable, actually.The touch screen is easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,1,3,Love the touch screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,4,It also has a touch screen feature which I'm not so fond of.
B002IPHIEG,1,5,The camera is all touch screen and is more of an iPod Touch feel to it.
B002IPHIEG,1,6,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.
B002IPHIEG,1,7,Some people might not like the touch screen, but it's actually quite easy to manipulate.
B002IPHIEG,1,8,A really nice camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,9,The Large LCD screen is Spectacular as is the color in the photos.
B002IPHIEG,1,10,The screen gets smudged so easily.
B002IPHIEG,1,11,The touch screen is very sensitive.
B002IPHIEG,1,12,That screen is easy to maneuver around.
B002IPHIEG,1,13,It just is not good for viewing on the big screen, it most likely be OK for 4 by 6 printing but I did not try to print my samples.
B002IPHIEG,1,14,It just is not good for viewing on the big screen, it most likely be OK for 4 by 6 printing but I did not try to print my samples.
B002IPHIEG,1,15,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,1,16,But, I'm really glad I have both of them because they each have some very positive features.UPDATE 7/20/12: From the beginning, the touch screen had an unusual look as if a screen protector was on it.
B002IPHIEG,1,17,The touch screen is very intuitive and responsive.
B002IPHIEG,1,18,A perfect sized protector will slightly overlap the screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,19,When your shots look good on the view screen, they will be even more pleasing on a correctly calibrated HD monitor.2) The white balance options never seem to look right on the view screen.
B002IPHIEG,1,20,Nice Small Camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,21,However, due to the size, close-ups, video quality, and touch screen, I would recommend this camera.
B002IPHIEG,1,22,And the 3 inch touch screen would be a very nice upgrade from my tiny 1.2 or so inch on the canon.Since the big thing I was looking for was better indoor pictures with lower light and less grainy blacks, that was the first set of shots I took.
B002IPHIEG,1,23,The view screen is very unforgiving and will lead you to believe your shots are more contrasty and grainy than they actually are.
B002IPHIEG,1,24,These images needed to impress on a 67" HD screen.
B002IPHIEG,2,0,Good but poor autofocus.
B002IPHIEG,2,1,It just works.
B002IPHIEG,2,2,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,2,3,Suppose that can't be helped.
B002IPHIEG,2,4,It's a nice gear for family.
B002IPHIEG,2,5,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,2,6,The 24mm f2.4 lens is it's best feature, don't let anyone else fool you.
B002IPHIEG,2,7,This kills an otherwise great night-time camera.
B002IPHIEG,2,8,It does exactly what I thought it would and better.
B002IPHIEG,2,9,Takes better pictures than any other camera I've owned.
B002IPHIEG,2,10,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,2,11,Love it!
B002IPHIEG,2,12,It is really hard to take bad shots with this camera, and if you take the time to learn the benefits of the various modes, I am certain you will get great results too.I was also skeptical of getting the rather narrow range of the 35mm lens, thinking I would prefer the wider lens on the WX1 when it comes out next month, but the panorama mode is awesome so I don't miss having the wider lens.
B002IPHIEG,2,13,You can see the result instantly!Other features worth mention is the 10FPS mode, DRO (Dynamic Range Optimizer) mode which shows better shadow and highlights, and the paint mode (add frames, and write text on pictures).
B002IPHIEG,2,14,The Canon has faster glass (f/2.0),
B002IPHIEG,2,15,It's been said that these new optics have TWICE the low light quality as the previous cameras.
B002IPHIEG,2,16,It does an amazing job.So why am I returning this camera?Well for most people I would say buy this camera now.. its a great photo camera for it's size, and has some really neat features.
B002IPHIEG,2,17,Loved this camera - i had it for 1.5 - 2 yrs and i was good for several more years if it weren't for the evil rain that destroyed it.
B002IPHIEG,2,18,It comes with 5X zoom, optical image stabilization, and best of all Sony CMOS sensor which gives great photos in low light without a serious loss of picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,2,19,You can upgrade your video card, but that is expensive and doesn't even work that well.
B002IPHIEG,2,20,Our 5 year old camera shoots pictures that are much better and sharp.
B002IPHIEG,2,21,So far it has worked really well.
B002IPHIEG,2,22,I paid more for it and don't feel ripped off.
B002IPHIEG,2,23,VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE: Great Camera!
B002IPHIEG,2,24,This camera is really nice; low light pictures take a long time to take, but look great.
B002IPHIEG,3,0,Vedio quality is great as well.
B002IPHIEG,3,1,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,2,great camera.
B002IPHIEG,3,3,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,3,4,Great camera.
B002IPHIEG,3,5,Most pictures come out great.
B002IPHIEG,3,6,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,3,7,The video quality is excellent.
B002IPHIEG,3,8,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,3,9,Overall is good.
B002IPHIEG,3,10,Oh, and the video quality is awesome as well.
B002IPHIEG,3,11,I use it for my blog and the picture quality and audio are great.
B002IPHIEG,3,12,720p video, great audio quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,13,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!
B002IPHIEG,3,14,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,3,15,I also love the video quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,16,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,3,17,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,3,18,The video quality is exceptional for a camera of this size as well.
B002IPHIEG,3,19,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,3,20,Great for traveling and sight seeing.
B002IPHIEG,3,21,Great customer service.
B002IPHIEG,3,22,Otherwise this is a great little camera with nice features.
B002IPHIEG,3,23,Great indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,3,24,Okay, I really loved this camera and the picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,4,0,What shots I took!
B002IPHIEG,4,1,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,4,2,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,4,3,*  The pet feature is great.
B002IPHIEG,4,4,One stop shot!
B002IPHIEG,4,5,It auto adjust to light so you always get great pictures.
B002IPHIEG,4,6,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,7,If you have low light though, it is capable of giving you some great shots.
B002IPHIEG,4,8,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,9,I'm strictly point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,4,10,I confess, I don't quite know the difference between the two modes, and they both churn out terrific low-light photos.The point is, a camera this small probably shouldn't turn out great low light shots.
B002IPHIEG,4,11,It has an anti blur mode meaning that it shoots 5 shots and blends them into one to create one great picture.
B002IPHIEG,4,12,Fortunately, P with some of the white balance settings used after experimentation will get you great shots.3)
B002IPHIEG,4,13,Overall is good.
B002IPHIEG,4,14,Decrease the EV setting by .07.
B002IPHIEG,4,15,5) Panorama mode is so much fun and results in excellent shots.
B002IPHIEG,4,16,Though I'd read, while this camera is a star as a point and shoot for low light, its daytime shots, or shots in artifical light, were not good.
B002IPHIEG,4,17,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,4,18,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,4,19,A very neat feature.Overall, I like the camera a lot.
B002IPHIEG,4,20,Good night shots.240-degree
B002IPHIEG,4,21,I purchased this camera for the Panorama mode, and low light shooting.
B002IPHIEG,4,22,Great
B002IPHIEG,4,23,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,4,24,an excellent point and shoot.
B002IPHIEG,5,0,Focus is fast.
B002IPHIEG,5,1,Its shot response more fast than I think.
B002IPHIEG,5,2,I want a camera that I don't know is there, that I can whip out in 2 seconds to snap off a shot.
B002IPHIEG,5,3,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,5,4,If I could, I would probably give the WX1 4 1/2 stars.
B002IPHIEG,5,5,Decrease the EV setting by .07.
B002IPHIEG,5,6,We set the camera to various ISO settings to try and minimize the noise, but no good.
B002IPHIEG,5,7,We set the camera to various ISO settings to try and minimize the noise, but no good.
B002IPHIEG,5,8,Using the Program (as opposed to Automatic) Mode allows you to set the ISO between 160 and 3200, which will force the camera to use a slower or faster shutter speed.
B002IPHIEG,5,9,Maybe I wasn't doing it right but they didn't seem to help much.The best bet for action and fast moving subjects with this camera seems to be the burst mode, which rips off 10 shots one after another when the shutter is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,5,10,These functions really work as advertised, although the sweep panoramas I've gotten so far haven't been as good quality as what I could have stitched together on my PC.Not so great: The TX1 doesn't have a full manual control over shutter speed and aperture (although you can choose different shooting modes that tend to favor wide apertures or fast or slow shutter speeds, and you can manually set the ISO and EV.) There's no exposure bracketing mode.
B002IPHIEG,5,11,You should note that if the DRO is on, you can't use a ISO higher than 800.
B002IPHIEG,5,12,Shutter lag (time from pushing the shutter button until photo taken),is very low for a pocket camera.What's not so good:-Noise reduction smears details at ISO 400 and above.
B002IPHIEG,5,13,The speed and auto-focusing are good.
B002IPHIEG,5,14,This will allow you to fix the ISO at 160, which is fine 90% of the time.
B002IPHIEG,5,15,I was always impressed with their speed, size, and the great pictures I would get from them.
B002IPHIEG,5,16,I got it for $159 and feel like I stole it.
B002IPHIEG,5,17,On the other hand a recent review of the upcoming S90 indicated that even with a fast lens and manual controls (allowing you to set the shutter) it wasn't fast enough for action, sports and kids.
B002IPHIEG,5,18,The high speed mode is one of the best I have seen in a small digicam.
B002IPHIEG,5,19,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.
B002IPHIEG,5,20,However, the TX1 is limited to a maximum shutter of only 1 second!
B002IPHIEG,5,21,If you could control the shutter (which you can't) you might be able to get this camera to better stop action.
B002IPHIEG,5,22,You can also put the camera in High ISO mode, which allows for faster shutter speed.Canon's soon to be released S90 seems to have become the great new hope for shutterbugs longing for a small point and shoot that takes great low light photos instead of the WX1, primarily because it not only also has a fast lens and improved sensor, but also manual controls and raw capabilities.2.
B002IPHIEG,5,23,It has an anti-blur mode which is awesome indoors without a flash.
B002IPHIEG,5,24,Improved low-light performance but a maxium exposure time of 1 second.
B002IPHIEG,6,0,Newer models can use either a Sony card or SD card.
B002IPHIEG,6,1,You can upgrade your video card, but that is expensive and doesn't even work that well.
B002IPHIEG,6,2,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,6,3,It went back after about 300 pictures of varying types.
B002IPHIEG,6,4,We do a lot of socializing and it's nice to have something easy to record the memories.
B002IPHIEG,6,5,Reformating memory stick is best done on computer.
B002IPHIEG,6,6,When I first saw this new camera, I thought this could me my next love, but we had a very short honeymoon - about 3 hours - then the ugly separation ensued!I'll be brief and to the point - the video was pretty good, but the pictures were actually horrible.
B002IPHIEG,6,7,When I first saw this new camera, I thought this could me my next love, but we had a very short honeymoon - about 3 hours - then the ugly separation ensued!I'll be brief and to the point - the video was pretty good, but the pictures were actually horrible.
B002IPHIEG,6,8,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,6,9,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,6,10,Loved this camera - i had it for 1.5 - 2 yrs and i was good for several more years if it weren't for the evil rain that destroyed it.
B002IPHIEG,6,11,This model has to have Sony card.
B002IPHIEG,6,12,The aesthetics of the camera is not very great, I would love to see some design elements in it for the camera at this price.I would recommend this camera to anyone who can manage to spend little extra money to buy this 24mm wide lense, its worth it.
B002IPHIEG,6,13,Overall I am being nice giving it a 3.I really wanted to love this camera, but no way.
B002IPHIEG,6,14,It has an anti-blur mode which is awesome indoors without a flash.
B002IPHIEG,6,15,Use MS Windows software for downloading.Overall: I am happy with purchase.
B002IPHIEG,6,16,Overall: If you are interested in a small, light, good looking and compact point-and-forget camera that makes ok pictures, this camera might work for you.
B002IPHIEG,6,17,Usually you will get 3 or 4 dividable sheets in a pack costing about $3.
B002IPHIEG,6,18,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.
B002IPHIEG,6,19,I must say, the reason i were attracted to this camera were, 1) sony quality 2)G-Lens and 3) The sensor and processor.
B002IPHIEG,6,20,Since my other cameras have been Sony cameras, I have already had memory stick cards and readers, so to me, its not a big deal.
B002IPHIEG,6,21,I'm pretty tech savvy and went through ALL of the setting, trying everything possible to get good consistent pictures, but to no avail!
B002IPHIEG,6,22,I'm pretty tech savvy and went through ALL of the setting, trying everything possible to get good consistent pictures, but to no avail!
B002IPHIEG,6,23,The low light capability was good, but not that much better than my Sony H20.
B002IPHIEG,6,24,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,7,0,Great Little Pocket Camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,1,Great little digital.
B002IPHIEG,7,2,Great features not so great picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,7,3,The photos do look great in a non zoom manner.
B002IPHIEG,7,4,Great Pocket Camera With A Little Tinkering.
B002IPHIEG,7,5,Very good pocket camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,6,Very small (fits in a pocket) and very easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,7,7,This Sony camera is a great small portable digital camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,8,The quality of the photos are very nice.
B002IPHIEG,7,9,I wanted a small camera I could keep in my pocket for daily use.
B002IPHIEG,7,10,Great
B002IPHIEG,7,11,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,12,At 10.2 megapixels, 4x zoom, and 1280x720 video, the specs are about twice as good as the T7.
B002IPHIEG,7,13,This is a very very nice pocket camera.
B002IPHIEG,7,14,I tried many of new 10 and 12 MP cameras, to my surprised, All of them took better picture at 5MP than 8 or 10MP.
B002IPHIEG,7,15,I do NOT recommend this camera not even at $100
B002IPHIEG,7,16,Like any camera this size, they had to make sacrifices to get the smallness.
B002IPHIEG,7,17,*  The pet feature is great.
B002IPHIEG,7,18,I own a digital SLR, and wanted to take something I could hand to my boys to take photos with.
B002IPHIEG,7,19,I had wanted a small pocket camera for those times when I wanted to just slip a camera in my pocket for those unplanned photo opts.
B002IPHIEG,7,20,Perfect pocket shot.
B002IPHIEG,7,21,Haven't shot any video.
B002IPHIEG,7,22,Most shots will now come out great.
B002IPHIEG,7,23,Best compact digital camera I've owned so far!
B002IPHIEG,7,24,Picture quality is fantastic for such a small camera.
B002IPHIEG,8,0,The 24mm f2.4 lens is it's best feature, don't let anyone else fool you.
B002IPHIEG,8,1,I would like to thank my boss who pushed me to buy this 24mm wide angle lense camera.Panoramic feature is also great.
B002IPHIEG,8,2,Having owned 3 other Sony cameras and a Panasonic, I am somewhat picky.
B002IPHIEG,8,3,Still, it is really, really good, especially for what it is with such a small body.
B002IPHIEG,8,4,Good Camera- 24mm wide angle is amazing.
B002IPHIEG,8,5,As a former owner of a Sony A700 with 16-80mm Carl z lenses, plus a whole bag of long range lenses.
B002IPHIEG,8,6,It just is TOO small.
B002IPHIEG,8,7,It was little more than my budget but as I look back now it was worth spending $50 more for this 24mm wide angle feature.
B002IPHIEG,8,8,Okay, I really loved this camera and the picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,8,9,I dont think I will get back into DSLR due to the bulky, expensive, complex (think dust on your sensor from lens changing).The price of $259 is mind blowing too given all these features.
B002IPHIEG,8,10,Lens distortion is amazingly low, even at wide angle.+
B002IPHIEG,8,11,Dust trapped inside lens, again!
B002IPHIEG,8,12,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,8,13,I love this camera!GREAT THINGS about this: The slim design with a built-in cover to protect the lens instead of needing a lens cap is great.
B002IPHIEG,8,14,I must say, the reason i were attracted to this camera were, 1) sony quality 2)G-Lens and 3) The sensor and processor.
B002IPHIEG,8,15,The good: Nice photos.
B002IPHIEG,8,16,Dealing with toting all that stuff around, cleaning lenses, I finally got sick of it and sold everything on eBay and bought this camera, sure the image quality will never touch the A700 DSLR but I find the joy of photography is having a camera always with you.
B002IPHIEG,8,17,Better luck next time Sony!
B002IPHIEG,8,18,Sony dropped the ball on this one, unfortunately.What's good:+ Range of focal lengths from true wide angle to slight telephoto.+
B002IPHIEG,8,19,I bought this camera because of its 24mm super wide lens and the promise of Sony's new Exmor R chip.
B002IPHIEG,8,20,Loved this camera - i had it for 1.5 - 2 yrs and i was good for several more years if it weren't for the evil rain that destroyed it.
B002IPHIEG,8,21,This will allow you to fix the ISO at 160, which is fine 90% of the time.
B002IPHIEG,8,22,The other reviews cover that pretty well so I'll keep it brief.After only 1 month the shutter stopped closing completely, and the repair process is no fun at all.It's been LESS THAN 2 MONTHS since I bought this camera and there is already dust trapped INSIDE the lens, so many of my pictures have visible spots all over them.Sony's customer service is far from good compared to other companies I've worked with.
B002IPHIEG,8,23,Certain features of this camera have greatly impressed me.
B002IPHIEG,8,24,Light and small for the lens range.3)
B002IPHIEG,9,0,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,9,1,small but wish it better low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,2,It is excellent in low light.
B002IPHIEG,9,3,It was NOT good at all.
B002IPHIEG,9,4,Photo quality under poor light conditions is amazing; photos are better than expected.
B002IPHIEG,9,5,The low light capability was good, but not that much better than my Sony H20.
B002IPHIEG,9,6,The big disappointmet was the bright light image quality.
B002IPHIEG,9,7,The low light pictures were much better then any other camera I have owned.
B002IPHIEG,9,8,Excellent low lighting performance.
B002IPHIEG,9,9,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,9,10,After about 5 months with this camera I have produced some very high quality images even at 5 m pixels.
B002IPHIEG,9,11,If you have low light though, it is capable of giving you some great shots.
B002IPHIEG,9,12,Loved this camera - i had it for 1.5 - 2 yrs and i was good for several more years if it weren't for the evil rain that destroyed it.
B002IPHIEG,9,13,But, you do get mixed results on the photos.
B002IPHIEG,9,14,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,9,15,Image quality was not what I expected.
B002IPHIEG,9,16,Still image and print quality are very important to me.
B002IPHIEG,9,17,It can take 6 consecutive pictures at once, and stack them together to get a high detailed picture, without showing the usual grainy high iso result.
B002IPHIEG,9,18,It does take better photos in low light, but overall picture quality for an amateur user isn't that great.
B002IPHIEG,9,19,The size and video are great.
B002IPHIEG,9,20,I wanted the following: 1) crisp, good pictures 2) good low-light capabilities 3) portability--small but powerful and 4)HD video.
B002IPHIEG,9,21,It's been said that these new optics have TWICE the low light quality as the previous cameras.
B002IPHIEG,9,22,Picture quality is better than I have had on past cameras, and come out pretty well.
B002IPHIEG,9,23,No, the quality of the photos is not in the league of the larger camera.
B002IPHIEG,9,24,The colors and lighting in the videos are excellent.
B002IPHIEG,10,0,Loved this camera - i had it for 1.5 - 2 yrs and i was good for several more years if it weren't for the evil rain that destroyed it.
B002IPHIEG,10,1,Purchased in May 2011.
B002IPHIEG,10,2,He got it about 2 years ago for $300+.
B002IPHIEG,10,3,Excellent buy for its price; a really good little camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,4,I bought an 8 gig card for it and it seems adequate so far.This is a great product that has really worked well for me.
B002IPHIEG,10,5,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,10,6,I have been using Sony digicams for almost 10 years now.
B002IPHIEG,10,7,So far, it is working great for me.
B002IPHIEG,10,8,Such a great camera!
B002IPHIEG,10,9,A great camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,10,I LOVED it!
B002IPHIEG,10,11,I bought this camera a little over a year ago as a Christmas present for my girlfriend.
B002IPHIEG,10,12,here's the things I love about the camera:1.-
B002IPHIEG,10,13,I used it at my daughters soccer game with great success.
B002IPHIEG,10,14,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,10,15,I am on my 3rd Digital Camera now.....I have had 3 Canons, and decided to stray out of my comfort zone and buy a Sony.
B002IPHIEG,10,16,I took to Italy last year and it proved to be the perfect camera for the trip.
B002IPHIEG,10,17,I bought two of the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-TX1/P camera within months of one another the first from Amazon on 12-17-2009.
B002IPHIEG,10,18,I am so glad that I Bought this camera!!
B002IPHIEG,10,19,not much better than my seven year old Sony DSC-T30.
B002IPHIEG,10,20,Highly recommend this product.
B002IPHIEG,10,21,I have had this camera for a little over a year.
B002IPHIEG,10,22,I truly believe you'll be very happy if you decide to purchase this camera.
B002IPHIEG,10,23,I absolutly love and highly recommend it.
B002IPHIEG,10,24,I did purchase this camera elsewhere.
B002IPHIEG,11,0,Great Camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,1,A great camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,2,Very easy to use and great options!
B002IPHIEG,11,3,It is very intuitive, and easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,11,4,Great features, simple and easy to use settings.
B002IPHIEG,11,5,Very easy to use once you get into it.-
B002IPHIEG,11,6,Great
B002IPHIEG,11,7,Great little camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,8,The screen is about as easy to navigate as you could ask for.
B002IPHIEG,11,9,It is also intuitive and easy to use the advanced functions without much of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,11,10,Great features, great size, lots of controls, decent photos.
B002IPHIEG,11,11,Such a great camera!
B002IPHIEG,11,12,It is very light and easy to carry.
B002IPHIEG,11,13,Great size and lots of features.
B002IPHIEG,11,14,So far, it is working great for me.
B002IPHIEG,11,15,Easy to use2.-
B002IPHIEG,11,16,That being said, if you are a casual user looking for a point and shoot that is easy and fun to use and small in size, this is the camera for you.
B002IPHIEG,11,17,This could be my user error, so I take some responsibility, it just seems like this should be easy to accomplish.Overall it's a great point and shoot camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,18,A nice advance of over previously-owned T-100, T-300.
B002IPHIEG,11,19,It also has one of the best touchscreen interfaces I've used on a camera, it's not in the way and it's easy and quick to use.
B002IPHIEG,11,20,This kills an otherwise great night-time camera.
B002IPHIEG,11,21,It's perfect for what I bought it for, and if you read the manual and learn how to use it, you'll get great results.
B002IPHIEG,11,22,I found it amazingly easy to use with just that little bit of reading.
B002IPHIEG,11,23,I have the same camera in blue and am very pleased with it, since it's very compact and fairly easy to use.
B002IPHIEG,11,24,Wasn't looking for dslr quality, but something that looked  nice would be useful.
B002IPHIEG,12,0,The videos do look good though.
B002IPHIEG,12,1,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,12,2,DON'T GET IF YOU WANT GOOD VIDEO.
B002IPHIEG,12,3,Is a good camera, as all sony cameras, takes good pictures effortless.
B002IPHIEG,12,4,The Panorama features, HD video, and other features make this a no brainer.
B002IPHIEG,12,5,Another good Sony camera.
B002IPHIEG,12,6,Great camera for a while.
B002IPHIEG,12,7,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!
B002IPHIEG,12,8,I have had it for about a month now and love taking pics and video.
B002IPHIEG,12,9,good features for the price.
B002IPHIEG,12,10,Date Stamp is done with the PMB software.HD video quality is actually better than the DMC-ZS3 AVCHD-lite.
B002IPHIEG,12,11,It does take great photos and video, however, the zoom toggle no longer works.
B002IPHIEG,12,12,While the Sony was good, the Canon was the clear winner here.
B002IPHIEG,12,13,If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you.
B002IPHIEG,12,14,Sony DSC-TX1 is pretty good quality, and fun to use.
B002IPHIEG,12,15,All in all I really love this camera and recommend it for video or stills.
B002IPHIEG,12,16,Such a great camera!
B002IPHIEG,12,17,If you're buying it primarily for great pictures you should look at other cameras.
B002IPHIEG,12,18,The video quality is excellent.
B002IPHIEG,12,19,While the video had more static, it was alot better.
B002IPHIEG,12,20,Very easy to use and great options!
B002IPHIEG,12,21,great day pics and motion pics night with out flash could be better video is amazing like it were a camcorder.
B002IPHIEG,12,22,The camera is great for the functionality, clear photos and movies and the price was right.
B002IPHIEG,12,23,I need to educate myself on this...being able to edit and play with the HD video files.
B002IPHIEG,12,24,HD Video.
B002IPHIEG,13,0,It did this with the battery that came with the camera.
B002IPHIEG,13,1,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,13,2,battery life5.-touch
B002IPHIEG,13,3,It is not unusual to go through two batteries in an hour or two, even when they are fully charged.
B002IPHIEG,13,4,Bought the camera and just before one year, the battery cover door broke -not due to mistreating-.
B002IPHIEG,13,5,If I had it to do over, I would not buy a camera with a touchscreen.One other thing--this thing eats batteries.
B002IPHIEG,13,6,battery cover can break in one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,7,I bought a new second camera and the same problem - battery cover door broke- just before one year.
B002IPHIEG,13,8,The battery door is flimsy.-Hard
B002IPHIEG,13,9,Battery does not last as long as the old Sony I have (T-3 and T-30)2.
B002IPHIEG,13,10,The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).
B002IPHIEG,13,11,Its great if you want Non-Flash photos and are frequently turning the camera off/on in between shots.BAD- Battery Cover - The battery cover seems very flimsy and bows a bit if you hold the camera by it.
B002IPHIEG,13,12,Display failed after 2 months.
B002IPHIEG,13,13,I pre-ordered this camera on 8/20/2009 (based on a glowing review [...]) and it arrived on 9/21/2009.
B002IPHIEG,13,14,I used to always buy Casio for my point and shoots, my SLR is also a NIKON but I've only heard great things about Sony from my friends only downside being the battery life so I made sure to buy an extra battery...apparently they've improved on that issue and the battery life has been fine.
B002IPHIEG,13,15,Great WHEN it worked.
B002IPHIEG,13,16,I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.
B002IPHIEG,13,17,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,13,18,I bought one about 2 months ago and have been using it a lot.
B002IPHIEG,13,19,It is just there all the time.
B002IPHIEG,13,20,The reason it's four stars is because the battery is rubbish after about 6 months (but still holds a charge for a full day) so I'm replacing it now because I sometimes forget to charge it for the next day.
B002IPHIEG,13,21,Now the camera powers on and stays on.Unfortunately, my problems were not over.
B002IPHIEG,13,22,Only downside... battery only lasts about 80 minutes, but generics are cheap.
B002IPHIEG,13,23,Manufacturer warranty only good for one year) the camera began failing in multiple ways.I'd power the camera on and immediately a message would pop up indicating that I needed to use a compatible battery, then would power off.
B002IPHIEG,13,24,Had this camera for about a month now - its a fine camera and has the usual settings/functions as mentioned by others.
B002IPHIEG,14,0,But the Touch Screen drove me crazy.
B002IPHIEG,14,1,The Sony "touch screen" only gets a 3 rating.
B002IPHIEG,14,2,Screen delamination or is it moisture haze?
B002IPHIEG,14,3,Translated to small point and shoot cameras, it's almost impossible for an older pair of eyes to clearly see what's on a 2.7 or 3 inch LCD screen on the back of camera, even if bright sun isn't washing out the screen.
B002IPHIEG,14,4,No bevel to the LCD frame.
B002IPHIEG,14,5,This is my first touch screen camera and I won't be going back to the old scroll method.
B002IPHIEG,14,6,The only bad point I have found....is sometimes I hit the touch screen when I am taking the picture and this changes my setting.
B002IPHIEG,14,7,It will mar or scratch the film and possibly damage the very screen you are trying to protect!
B002IPHIEG,14,8,Most of the time with the WX1 I really can't make out what's on the screen, because to me its all out of focus (the problem is my eyes, not the camera).
B002IPHIEG,14,9,It should have a viewfinder a bit hard to see in direct sunlight.
B002IPHIEG,14,10,If the camera has trouble focusing you simply touch the screen where you want it to focus and it focuses on that spot.
B002IPHIEG,14,11,The view screen is very unforgiving and will lead you to believe your shots are more contrasty and grainy than they actually are.
B002IPHIEG,14,12,Now I notice that my wife's camera is doing the same thing and I don't know what is going on yet but I cannot reccommend this camera now that I have seen both screens go bad in less than two years.
B002IPHIEG,14,13,The LCD plastic sits at the highest point on the back of the camera.
B002IPHIEG,14,14,Maybe there's a way to use some complex custom settings, but otherwise flash photos are washed out, blurry, grainy, etc. Had it for less than 2 years- screen appears to be failing.
B002IPHIEG,14,15,If I could, I would probably give the WX1 4 1/2 stars.
B002IPHIEG,14,16,That screen is easy to maneuver around.
B002IPHIEG,14,17,The SONY seems to handle these bright outdoor shots slightly better with either the P or EASY Settings.All in all, its a fine camera.
B002IPHIEG,14,18,The LCD screen is bright, and high quality.. but its smaller.. and the menu system seems cluttered and annoyingly thought out.
B002IPHIEG,14,19,Those can pose some problems when they open when they shouldn't (like in your pocket).The large touch screen makes everything easy.
B002IPHIEG,14,20,Shadows and dark areas get crushed.Screen washes out in daylight.
B002IPHIEG,14,21,I've had a couple cameras like this and the clear plastic gets scratched quickly.
B002IPHIEG,14,22,The Large LCD screen is Spectacular as is the color in the photos.
B002IPHIEG,14,23,This camera is under $200 at Walmart.
B002IPHIEG,14,24,This annoyed me as iAUTO couldn't get it right all the time, and I'd miss shots of a 2yr old trying to change setting on the touch screen, which kinda sucks as it gets so dirty from oily fingers.I'm waiting for the new Canon SX210 IS - much higher zoom, likely HD as-good as SONY, wide angle lens and larger 3" screen.
B002IPHIEG,15,0,No problems encountered so far.
B002IPHIEG,15,1,Subject was four feet away, but the camera focused almost 6 feet away.
B002IPHIEG,15,2,Great small camera, love the 24mm, but the camera back focuses way too much.
B002IPHIEG,15,3,The subject was OK, but not tack sharp as what was hoped for.
B002IPHIEG,15,4,The zoom's a bit unresponsive, not allowing very fine adjustment.
B002IPHIEG,15,5,Good but poor autofocus.
B002IPHIEG,15,6,There wasn't much to complain about.However I noticed last year that my screen was  getting hazy or splotchy; I don't know what to call it but it looks like a window with condensation all over it and I associated it with moisture or humidity "behine" the glass screen.
B002IPHIEG,15,7,I would say, and this may be a mark against it for many people, that the WX1 is not a "point and shoot" camera unless one is familiar with its workings, but when I read the negative comments I wonder if some of the issues complained of could be addressed through a better understanding of the camera.
B002IPHIEG,15,8,It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.
B002IPHIEG,15,9,The reason it is not a point and shoot is because auto exposure is just wrong.
B002IPHIEG,15,10,They are easy to use, shoot nice movies, have a big screen and great results.
B002IPHIEG,15,11,A NON-DOCUMENTED use is setting the mode to shoot upwards but turning the camera sideways to obtain a taller horizontal view.My only real disappointment is the video mode.
B002IPHIEG,15,12,I was looking for a small point and shoot camera for live music shows that I could sneak into places that wouldn't allow detachable lens cameras, or cameras at all.
B002IPHIEG,15,13,It also turned out that with the DRO turned off, many of the problems with the IQ of daytime shots were addressed.
B002IPHIEG,15,14,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,15,15,It turned out that the the problem was that in one case (the no greater than 800 case), the DRO was on.
B002IPHIEG,15,16,At the current state of the art, no point and shoot camera is going to do a great job in this area.All in all its a cool little camera which does things most point and shoots don't and also doesn't do things most point and shoots don't.
B002IPHIEG,15,17,It's not a HUGE difference, but it was noticeable when shooting.So for whatever reason the video does NOT benefit from the new low light lens system.
B002IPHIEG,15,18,I reported the problem 32 days after buying so I was out of luck with the retailer.
B002IPHIEG,15,19,While continuing to hold the desired meter settings with shutter button slightly depressed move (aim) the camera to your subject then shoot.
B002IPHIEG,15,20,Light and small for the lens range.3)
B002IPHIEG,15,21,Most of the time with the WX1 I really can't make out what's on the screen, because to me its all out of focus (the problem is my eyes, not the camera).
B002IPHIEG,15,22,There are many problems however:1.
B002IPHIEG,15,23,It also has a pet mode which is suppose to do the same thing for things that move on four legs.
B002IPHIEG,15,24,Great even in low lighted area.The bad side: The rocker/toggle switch used to zooming in and out the lens is fragile!
B002IPHIEG,16,0,There is static noise when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,16,1,This time, Sony did not want to repair under the warranty because they claimed it was due to mistreatment.
B002IPHIEG,16,2,This is not the zooming sound.
B002IPHIEG,16,3,Sony repaired the damage under the warranty and not cost at all.
B002IPHIEG,16,4,Video is usually okay, but has two major problems... First, the noise of zooming in and out is recorded very loudly.
B002IPHIEG,16,5,I reported the problem 32 days after buying so I was out of luck with the retailer.
B002IPHIEG,16,6,They asked for US$400 to repair a tiny door.I am very disappointed for the customer support from Sony.
B002IPHIEG,16,7,Recording HD movie were also disappointing, when you are recording you can actually hear sound of zooming and focusing when you play them back.
B002IPHIEG,16,8,So of course there is no reliable way to take photos and certainly no way to review photos.I called Amazon.com this morning and the customer service representative told me I had to call Sony.I visited the Sony website, entered my information, and was given instructions to ship the camera back to Sony (at my expense) for free warranty repair (luckily it was within the 90 day window).I've owned Canon digital cameras for 7 years and never had a hardware failure in the first three months like this.
B002IPHIEG,16,9,The zooming noise from ZR1 can hardly be noticed on the footage as well.
B002IPHIEG,16,10,I dont know if its my camera but this camera kinda sucks at recording, becuz whenever i record it makes a sound in the background recording and its really annoying.
B002IPHIEG,16,11,Sony said they would repair the camera but that means shipping, waiting, and considerable trouble.
B002IPHIEG,16,12,They suggested I contact Sony (I didn't buy the camera from them).
B002IPHIEG,16,13,The mono-microphone is pretty sensitive and provides a good sound quality.
B002IPHIEG,16,14,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).
B002IPHIEG,16,15,I would have liked stereo sound recording but is that even possible on such a small camera?
B002IPHIEG,16,16,But once I started taking video I immediately uncovered the first and the major problem, which became a deal-breaker - it's lens produces very loud mechanical noise when you're doing zoom in or out.When you apply zoom it sounds like you're starting an aged truck in cold weather.
B002IPHIEG,16,17,Just for the record, I never experienced such a problem neither with my T100 nor with my Sony HDR-SR7 camcorder.
B002IPHIEG,16,18,So why am I reviewing a camera that seems like a downgrade?Well Sony is using a new lens system called the "Exmor R".
B002IPHIEG,16,19,As far as the recording goes, the HD videos are great!
B002IPHIEG,16,20,Sony DSC-WX1 , A disappointing Camera.
B002IPHIEG,16,21,That is why for a number of years I had successively Sony DSC-T1, T30, and T100 ultra-compacts.
B002IPHIEG,16,22,Video quality is very good, and you can zoom in while recording.
B002IPHIEG,16,23,Great Video, Pictures not so good.
B002IPHIEG,16,24,I found the following message in Sony's online repair area: The cost to repair this unit under our Flat Rate Program is $211.00,
B002IPHIEG,17,0,Fortunately, P with some of the white balance settings used after experimentation will get you great shots.3)
B002IPHIEG,17,1,settings adjustments for color hues, saturation.-No
B002IPHIEG,17,2,Decrease the EV setting by .07.
B002IPHIEG,17,3,When setting on "P" mode I found out that switching the White Balance from "Auto" or "Daylight" to "Flash" in improves outdoor photos color, tone, exposure and warmness.
B002IPHIEG,17,4,However, did you ever try looking at "no flash" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode?
B002IPHIEG,17,5,I know I can always get into manual modes to compensate for things, but I wanted something I didn't always have to do that with.
B002IPHIEG,17,6,If your looking for a quick easy point and shoot, this camera is for you.
B002IPHIEG,17,7,I cannot seem to change the color rendition anywhere, but I can get it to take 10 shots in a row, which are all equally ugly.
B002IPHIEG,17,8,You may need to set the EV to -.3=>-.7 for less contrasty scenes.
B002IPHIEG,17,9,They looked better if I manually set the ISO, but if I'm just pulling it out for a quick shot, i don't want to have to remember to go to manual settings all the time.
B002IPHIEG,17,10,You have to switch the camera to Handheld Twilight mode and adjust the Exposure Value(EV) from -0.3 to -1.7(this is a very important setting that needs to be set on order to remove the noisyness and grain from the photo, a setting people don't adjust and then complain about how bad the photo looks in low light).
B002IPHIEG,17,11,mode is cool, but the image stitching does not work well enough in my opinion.-No
B002IPHIEG,17,12,Switching to any other mode defaults the settings to the terrible AUTO everything requiring the photographer to reset all those undesirable Sony auto settings.
B002IPHIEG,17,13,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,17,14,Yeah, turning on the FLASH white balance for outdoor photos (which makes no sense by the way) --SOMETIMES-- does make the normally blueish outdoor photos look more pleasingly orangeish if you can remember to make this cryptic change or use P mode for your outdoor photos.
B002IPHIEG,17,15,I will go into that later.This camera really has some cool features, Like Sweep Panorama, Smile Shutter, Handheld Twilight and AntiMotion Blur Mode.The key is setting the camera up for the right scenes, which means not keeping it set on Intelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode(AKA Auto everything).
B002IPHIEG,17,16,You might also want to try different White Balances,setting correctly results in really nice low light shots.Outdoor shots:This camera in iSCN mode seems to keep the lens all the way open(F2.4)and it adjusts the shutter speed(a big No No)resulting in washed out over exposed photos(yuck).The solution: switch to "P" Mode which closes down the lens to around a nice F5.0 to F7.1(much better) and switch the White Balance to "Flash" .
B002IPHIEG,17,17,I hated it doesn't has black and white mode.
B002IPHIEG,17,18,A reviewer on Amazon has also noted that you can get more vivid, warm outdoors photos from the WX1 by using the Program mode and moving the White Balance setting from Auto to Flash.
B002IPHIEG,17,19,The reason it is not a point and shoot is because auto exposure is just wrong.
B002IPHIEG,17,20,Also for better exposure you can again adjust the EV.Panorama Shots: This one's tricky, from where you press the shutter to start the panorama it locks the exposure at that point.
B002IPHIEG,17,21,UPDATE: I just found out today that a White Balance setting might be the key to this camera for outdoor shots.
B002IPHIEG,17,22,It's pretty good, WITH THE RIGHT SETTINGS.
B002IPHIEG,17,23,And some outdoor night shots.
B002IPHIEG,17,24,Second, the autofocus changes haphazardly, switching from foreground to background, sometimes following movement, and preferentially focusing on light sources.
B002IPHIEG,18,0,I know that folks will say that I must have pressed the wrong button, and that might be so at times.
B002IPHIEG,18,1,4) Reviewing photos after a shot ... is too slow.
B002IPHIEG,18,2,3) Most importantly for me, the shutter does not click fast enough.
B002IPHIEG,18,3,Instead it takes ... 3 to 5 seconds because you have to wait for the current photo to be processed and then wait wait wait to press the review button and if you press it twice ... oops, your still in picture-taking mode.
B002IPHIEG,18,4,So much movement occurs by the subject in the 1 to 4 seconds (depending on lighting) it takes the shutter to click on this Cybershot.
B002IPHIEG,18,5,Taking pictures with this camera is so much fun.Because it is so thin and light, pressing the shutter release button without adding shake to the shot takes a very steady hand.
B002IPHIEG,18,6,However, the TX1 is limited to a maximum shutter of only 1 second!
B002IPHIEG,18,7,I rather prefer to use the 2-second timer, which gives me just enough time after pressing the button to steady up the focus frame on my subject.
B002IPHIEG,18,8,Surely, the last photo can be put into a memory buffer to immediately be shown when the review button is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,18,9,Being an SLR user, I am used to instant reaction speed between the moment I press the button and the moment the shutter clicks.
B002IPHIEG,18,10,Even in daytime scenes at ISO 125 there was enough noise to make me change into 5 megapixel mode.
B002IPHIEG,18,11,When taking shutter speed it takes a while to recording and process it to save it and show up on camera.
B002IPHIEG,18,12,I would buy it again.I would ask SONY to change a few things: 1) The power and shutter buttons are too flush and difficult to feel in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,18,13,I want a camera that I don't know is there, that I can whip out in 2 seconds to snap off a shot.
B002IPHIEG,18,14,The zoom is difficult to use it moves to fast.
B002IPHIEG,18,15,You can jack up the ISO to compensate, but this feature is buried in a menu (as is EV compensation).
B002IPHIEG,18,16,There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small.
B002IPHIEG,18,17,Compared to my old Nikon Coolpix S1, the TX1 only requires half the exposure time.
B002IPHIEG,18,18,It has a 10 shot feature, by pressing the button down it will shoot 10 shots in a row, of any quality you choose, the only bad part is you have to wait for the camera to save the photos, still a very neat and useful feature.However, the resolution is not as great as I'd like it to be.
B002IPHIEG,18,19,I took about 100 images at a recent wedding I attended and at least half of them have ugly white rings which are present at different locations on the affected images.
B002IPHIEG,18,20,This only happens on the images that the flash fired.
B002IPHIEG,18,21,I suspect that they accidentally hit the trash can with the left hand thumb and then inadvertenly touched the Delete All Pictures choice with their right thumb.
B002IPHIEG,18,22,Maybe I wasn't doing it right but they didn't seem to help much.The best bet for action and fast moving subjects with this camera seems to be the burst mode, which rips off 10 shots one after another when the shutter is pressed.
B002IPHIEG,18,23,Have to get use to holding it from the edges.
B002IPHIEG,18,24,Second, the screen is not always responsive (which may seem incongruous with my first remark, but that's my experience).
B002IPHIEG,19,0,This camera is under $200 at Walmart.
B002IPHIEG,19,1,Tell me what will you do when you want to move pictures from your camera to your computer on the fly, you will need the 10 meter long 10 plug Sony proprietary cable, how about taking the memory card out, oh, that's another proprietary memory stick duo, now how to charge it?
B002IPHIEG,19,2,you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.-
B002IPHIEG,19,3,Since my other cameras have been Sony cameras, I have already had memory stick cards and readers, so to me, its not a big deal.
B002IPHIEG,19,4,Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.
B002IPHIEG,19,5,We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers.
B002IPHIEG,19,6,I haven't transferred them to the computer, but I don't show my pictures on my computer.
B002IPHIEG,19,7,Interface to computer - dedicated cable I have to bring with me on vacation, or a usb sd card reader?
B002IPHIEG,19,8,5) Come on SONY!! What is it about the ridiculous proprietary connections you put on your cameras.
B002IPHIEG,19,9,There are some quirks with this camera which I wanted to point out.GOOD- Photo Quality - Others cover this so I wont go into it, but basically the photos are very good.BAD- Sony USB Cable - This is proprietary SONY cable, so you have to carry it around with you if you want to download photos from the directly from the camera without removing the Memory Stick.
B002IPHIEG,19,10,A memory card is essential.So for the price and innovative technology, I really like this camera.
B002IPHIEG,19,11,No HDMI.Expensive Memory Stick Duo.
B002IPHIEG,19,12,Internal Memory.
B002IPHIEG,19,13,The only thing is that it is not supplied with a HDMI cable as standard..........
B002IPHIEG,19,14,Incidentally, the newest duo "pro" cards are not compatible with some older readers even if they accommodate Sony cards.... go figure.4)
B002IPHIEG,19,15,Taking HD Video takes up so much space on the memory card.
B002IPHIEG,19,16,Furthermore, surely, SONY could ALSO enable battery charging from the USB.6)
B002IPHIEG,19,17,If you have had other cameras that used SD, just think of making a $20 investment into a very reliable, fast card for your camera, and use the SD card in your Wii.The only two complaints I have for this camera are it's low light picture taking, and the format it uses when recording video.
B002IPHIEG,19,18,My only negative is it didn't have a Memory Stick included.The battery doesn't last as long as the T100.
B002IPHIEG,19,19,I had high hopes for this Sony, and even went to the trouble of buying a 16GB Memory Stick Duo (hate their proprietary attitude) and an extra battery.
B002IPHIEG,19,20,here's the things I love about the camera:1.-
B002IPHIEG,19,21,It turned out that the the problem was that in one case (the no greater than 800 case), the DRO was on.
B002IPHIEG,19,22,The memory stick duo is what Sony uses; save to an external hard drive (you're going to need one either for the quantity of VGA photos or the memory required to store all your 10.2 megapixel treasures) and re-use to bring down your expenses if the price differential with other media is such a big factor.
B002IPHIEG,19,23,What can't a mini USB connection do?
B002IPHIEG,19,24,(No speed advantage with Ultra II or HX cards)Mac software only includes music transfer software for in-camera slideshow mode.
B002IPHIEG,20,0,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,20,1,I am replacing a Cannon with only 3.1 megapixels and this is somuch better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,20,2,This camera is under $200 at Walmart.
B002IPHIEG,20,3,I think my next one will be a Casio or Canon.
B002IPHIEG,20,4,I was looking for better zoom while still maintaining the compact feel.
B002IPHIEG,20,5,nothing better.
B002IPHIEG,20,6,Best Point & Shoot Digital Camera I Ever Got ;) SONY TX1.
B002IPHIEG,20,7,Our 5 year old camera shoots pictures that are much better and sharp.
B002IPHIEG,20,8,If its zoom hadn't given out after many active years, I'd still shoot with it.
B002IPHIEG,20,9,For a camera of this price, I feel it needs a much better zoom.
B002IPHIEG,20,10,Our last camera was a canon Powershot S2 IS.
B002IPHIEG,20,11,I've had a Sony DSC T1 (5MP) for the past 7 years and felt it was time to upgrade.
B002IPHIEG,20,12,That being said, I think the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W290 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization (Dark Blue) would be just fine as well for my needs.If SONY would only stop with the SONY-only cables/cards this would be a much better camera!
B002IPHIEG,20,13,I was still shooting film when the digital age rolled around.
B002IPHIEG,20,14,Also, I tried a Canon SD940IS.
B002IPHIEG,20,15,Better luck next time Sony!
B002IPHIEG,20,16,This one, with the exception of a F/3.1 lens (why not 2.8 or better?), seems to answer all my prayers with a price point under $350.SONY.... THEY'RE ALL ABOUT GIMMICKS AND LACK OF TRUE PERFORMANCE.
B002IPHIEG,20,17,It seems like most the Sony models lack on the zoom capability.-
B002IPHIEG,20,18,At this rate, my next compact might be a Canon or Panasonic.
B002IPHIEG,20,19,This is not to say they are DSLR quality, but they don't look bad at all for a point and shoot.Other positives:4.
B002IPHIEG,20,20,Having faith and loyalty in the Canon brand (this was our 4th Canon Camera purchase, two of which were Canon AE-1s given as gifts) I contacted Canon and was sorely disappointed.
B002IPHIEG,20,21,I wonder if point and shoot cameras like this one could do better.
B002IPHIEG,20,22,I bought the TX1 after using a borrowed one and comparing it to Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, and the newest compact Sonys: TX100, TX7, T110.
B002IPHIEG,20,23,should note that, if you are willing to carry a somewhat larger portable, you can get substantially better image quality.
B002IPHIEG,20,24,This is my 3rd Sony Cybershot.
B002IPHIEG,21,0,Many of my pictures have spots in them even though I do clean the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,1,The ONLY thing that I do not like is having to open the lens cover to take photos...but in the end this will protect the lens, because I dropped two of my Canons and messed up the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,2,Light and small for the lens range.3)
B002IPHIEG,21,3,The placement of the lens allows for others to touch or cover the lens with their fingers if they are taking a picture for you.
B002IPHIEG,21,4,There are many problems however:1.
B002IPHIEG,21,5,I believe this is due to the flash being close to the lens.In summary, DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA.
B002IPHIEG,21,6,I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens.Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,7,Pictures come rounded (probably because of wide angle).3.
B002IPHIEG,21,8,It is so much better than the cameras that have the protruding lens that extends when open.
B002IPHIEG,21,9,The rear element of the lens mechanism will get dirty.
B002IPHIEG,21,10,Usually you will get 3 or 4 dividable sheets in a pack costing about $3.
B002IPHIEG,21,11,Lastly, from the "what were they thinking??" category, the flash is placed in a position where the lens blocks the flash from illuminating the lower left corner of the image at the wide end of the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,12,I was advised that this is a technical problem caused by the flash being to close to the lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,13,There is always a shadow in the lower left corner of the pictures (because of very short distance between flash and lens).2.
B002IPHIEG,21,14,Another great feature is the lens cover that acts as an on/off switch.
B002IPHIEG,21,15,Taking a picture with the camera turned sideways to better frame a specific shot shows a lot of distortion from the wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,16,Then when you receive the camera back from the factory, the spots are gone, but you discover the focus is not as good as it was before you sent the camera for cleaning.... then back to the factory, etc.
B002IPHIEG,21,17,Works well in most lighting conditions with/without flash.
B002IPHIEG,21,18,The only problem I have had is with dust backscatter.
B002IPHIEG,21,19,If you take a picture with flash at 24mm, what is a really common use I have to say, it gets a black spot in the lower left corner.
B002IPHIEG,21,20,I place my thumb along the bottom edge right where the battery cover it and there is no lip to keep your thumb from sliding the door open.
B002IPHIEG,21,21,It turned out that the the problem was that in one case (the no greater than 800 case), the DRO was on.
B002IPHIEG,21,22,I needed low light capabilities for indoor and nighttime pictures without a flash and a wide angle lens.
B002IPHIEG,21,23,Only minor complaint is that the lens is located very near where you hold the camera (upper right-hand corner) so you have to be careful not to take a picture of your thumb or finger -- have done that a few times :).
B002IPHIEG,21,24,The taping will permit you to slide the camera into and out of your pocket or case without peeling back the protector making it useless.
B002IPHIEG,22,0,Suitable for low light only.
B002IPHIEG,22,1,Slightly better at low light but terrible with good light.
B002IPHIEG,22,2,Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.
B002IPHIEG,22,3,It is a lot better with the picture quality especially in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,4,Took great pictures in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,5,quality is not that great.
B002IPHIEG,22,6,It's better in low light but still very grainy, however it's worse in good bright light.
B002IPHIEG,22,7,Better picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,8,Great indoor picture quality.
B002IPHIEG,22,9,Even the low light pictures don't seem to have a noise problem.
B002IPHIEG,22,10,The low light pictures were much better then any other camera I have owned.
B002IPHIEG,22,11,Works well in most lighting conditions with/without flash.
B002IPHIEG,22,12,Low light pictures are blurry and pixelated.
B002IPHIEG,22,13,Image quality was not what I expected.
B002IPHIEG,22,14,Yes, you are slightly more likely to get a better photo in the dark if you really need to take photos in the dark.
B002IPHIEG,22,15,The gist of their complaints seemed to be that the camera took good pictures in low light (although a few didn't even agree with that) and crappy pictures in good light.
B002IPHIEG,22,16,A grainy photo is better than no photo at all.
B002IPHIEG,22,17,It takes very clear photos in day light and at night time or low light conditions.
B002IPHIEG,22,18,It's been said that these new optics have TWICE the low light quality as the previous cameras.
B002IPHIEG,22,19,I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,20,Low light photos are quite good even at ISO 3200.
B002IPHIEG,22,21,Low light capabilities - I dislike using a flash and wanted something that could take good pictures in natural light, and could function well in dark places.The low light capabilities of this camera are astonishing.
B002IPHIEG,22,22,It is excellent in low light.
B002IPHIEG,22,23,There are many problems however:1.
B002IPHIEG,22,24,The low light picture taking is always a problem with cameras this size.
B002IPHIEG,23,0,I reported the problem 32 days after buying so I was out of luck with the retailer.
B002IPHIEG,23,1,I returned it in the next day I received.
B002IPHIEG,23,2,When I got home from my 7 day trip, I realized that the first 5 days of my vacation had been deleted without my even knowing it.
B002IPHIEG,23,3,I must say this is THE ONLY reason to hang onto this $300-400 camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,4,I am going to see if Sony wiill repair or replace them but right now it feels that $329 x 2 was too much to spend for less than two years use.
B002IPHIEG,23,5,Quick focusThe bad:1) The only reason I returned it was the biggest.
B002IPHIEG,23,6,I bought one about 2 months ago and have been using it a lot.
B002IPHIEG,23,7,Usually you will get 3 or 4 dividable sheets in a pack costing about $3.
B002IPHIEG,23,8,While waiting to get the camera, I would check Amazon every day to see if anyone who had actually used the camera had put up any reviews yet.
B002IPHIEG,23,9,It turned out that the the problem was that in one case (the no greater than 800 case), the DRO was on.
B002IPHIEG,23,10,I had a bought a Sony DSC-T3 a few years ago, wanting it so bad I imported one from Japan!
B002IPHIEG,23,11,I'm somewhat puzzled after reading several of the poor reviews for this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,12,With the first 100 pictures of my trip gone I decided I didn't want to be stressed out every time I ask someone to take a picture of us, not to mention the stress of keeping myself from doing it.
B002IPHIEG,23,13,I got it from the Amazon warehouse, so the used price helped make it more palatable plus it's arrival in 2 days thanks to Prime!
B002IPHIEG,23,14,don't buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,15,This camera is under $200 at Walmart.
B002IPHIEG,23,16,If you want ultimate still-picture quality, this is not the one for you.The long review:I bought this camera to replace my aging Sony DSC-T7.
B002IPHIEG,23,17,I did all my research (reading product reviews from Amazon, CNET, BestBuy etc.) and decided to try out the WX1 and I'm glad I did.
B002IPHIEG,23,18,I've owned this camera for almost 4 years now, and I barely use it.
B002IPHIEG,23,19,If not, make sure you check it before your 30 day return option expires
B002IPHIEG,23,20,I bought this camera a little over a year ago as a Christmas present for my girlfriend.
B002IPHIEG,23,21,I purchased two cameras and compared them for several days prior to the trip.
B002IPHIEG,23,22,Do not buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,23,23,He got it about 2 years ago for $300+.
B002IPHIEG,23,24,Decrease the EV setting by .07.
B002IPHIEG,24,0,I looked all over to try to find which settings to change but I never found it.
B002IPHIEG,24,1,this is 2010 not 1985.4.  User interface - menu is difficult to navigate and full of gimmicky 'features' as opposed to useful things.
B002IPHIEG,24,2,First, it is all too easy while shooting to accidently change the settings and all too difficult to get back to what I want--after I realize what's happened.
B002IPHIEG,24,3,How is that possible?! (for the answer, see the next line item)- No manual controls.
B002IPHIEG,24,4,Take time to read and understand the instruction manual!Be sure and buy an xtra battery as the camera will gobble up the available "juice" while shooting.
B002IPHIEG,24,5,I know that folks will say that I must have pressed the wrong button, and that might be so at times.
B002IPHIEG,24,6,The touch-screen interface is slick, but does have a bit of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,24,7,He's picked it up a couple of times, but hasn't yet figured out how to work it...heaven help he should actually READ the manual (which I suggest).
B002IPHIEG,24,8,That screen is easy to maneuver around.
B002IPHIEG,24,9,I figured out most of the settings without even reading the instructions.
B002IPHIEG,24,10,It is not always the case, though; my last shoot, I know I did not change the settings but they changed to the lowest setting nonetheless.If I could afford a more professional camera, I would get it, but as a freelance writer a point-and-shoot is it and it has to be easy to handle.
B002IPHIEG,24,11,Third, when trying to get back to the settings I want in the middle of a photo opp, it can be confusing trying to find the right screen.Fourth (and worst), the image size seems to change without my actually choosing it.
B002IPHIEG,24,12,It is also intuitive and easy to use the advanced functions without much of a learning curve.
B002IPHIEG,24,13,Touchscreen makes managing functions fairly easy, and camera's "Easy" mode performs very intelligently in most settings.
B002IPHIEG,24,14,Also, I find it easy to hit the power button when the camera's in a crowded pocket.
B002IPHIEG,24,15,You can use as a "point and shoot" using the "Easy Mode" feature for the average photographer or hit the menu and you then have all the MANY features at your disposal for the more advanced person.
B002IPHIEG,24,16,The TX1 doesn't have a "movie mode" button like the t500/t900, you have to use the menu system to turn it on.
B002IPHIEG,24,17,Also took it to dinner with our prospective in-laws...9 people sitting at a round table.
B002IPHIEG,24,18,That is the touchscreen.
B002IPHIEG,24,19,This doesn't do it.I was looking for a small simple camera to carry with me.
B002IPHIEG,24,20,I do a lot of shooting under pressure.
B002IPHIEG,24,21,The touchscreen also got an upgrade even if it's smaller and has more of a iphone'isk menu system.
B002IPHIEG,24,22,I'm sure they'll improve this in the future though.To load the Sony "still" pictures into Picasa is an easy process.
B002IPHIEG,24,23,I am a point-and-shoot camera user with no professional experience in this area.I found myself carrying both cameras at the same time.
B002IPHIEG,24,24,Instead of the usual 3 pics, you have up to 10 to choose from.
B002IPHIEG,25,0,I must say, the reason i were attracted to this camera were, 1) sony quality 2)G-Lens and 3) The sensor and processor.
B002IPHIEG,25,1,and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1).
B002IPHIEG,25,2,I do NOT recommend this camera not even at $100
B002IPHIEG,25,3,Sony DSC-WX1 , A disappointing Camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,4,I NEED my camera all the time so what am I supposed to do?I have had 4 Sony Cybershots over a period of 7 years and I think I've had it.
B002IPHIEG,25,5,Usually you will get 3 or 4 dividable sheets in a pack costing about $3.
B002IPHIEG,25,6,Let just start by writing that, I've been a fan and using sony product for about 25-30 years and i spend tens of thousands of dollars on sony products.
B002IPHIEG,25,7,It got me thinking about all of the Sony products we have had in the past.
B002IPHIEG,25,8,Sorry Sony.
B002IPHIEG,25,9,Sorry Sony.
B002IPHIEG,25,10,Sorry Sony!
B002IPHIEG,25,11,Sorry Sony!
B002IPHIEG,25,12,The only problem I have had is with dust backscatter.
B002IPHIEG,25,13,Good camera with an awful flaw in the design that affects some pictures.
B002IPHIEG,25,14,I've owned Sony cameras for years and would never look at another brand of camera, until now.
B002IPHIEG,25,15,I love the features of this camera, but I'm still tossed about it, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars.
B002IPHIEG,25,16,With that, I will clear up problems previous owners have had.First, I'm sure all of you want to know how good the new Exmor R sensor is.
B002IPHIEG,25,17,don't buy this camera.
B002IPHIEG,25,18,A 3 star camera I've learned to love.
B002IPHIEG,25,19,The Sony H20 and even my 4 year old Canon SD850IS were MUCH better.
B002IPHIEG,25,20,I am going to see if Sony wiill repair or replace them but right now it feels that $329 x 2 was too much to spend for less than two years use.
B002IPHIEG,25,21,Loved this camera - i had it for 1.5 - 2 yrs and i was good for several more years if it weren't for the evil rain that destroyed it.
B002IPHIEG,25,22,I was looking at this last month when it was announced, and had decided I was going to go with the forthcoming 980 from Canon.
B002IPHIEG,25,23,If you plan on taking any video you will def.
B002IPHIEG,25,24,It seems all my video files are HUGE.
B00DMS0LCO,0,0,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,0,1,Long exposure behavior (I use it for astro pictures at 2-5 minute exposure) is really no difference to the already great T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,0,2,Over priced.
B00DMS0LCO,0,3,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,0,4,So we wait.....
B00DMS0LCO,0,5,When I get the battery, there is no power in it.
B00DMS0LCO,0,6,For a $1200 camera it should have a full frame senor.Their still not there yet.
B00DMS0LCO,0,7,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,0,8,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,0,9,Maybe not as good as I would expect, but the keeper rate is considerably higher.
B00DMS0LCO,0,10,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,0,11,However, if I look at my trusty Rebel T2i, which has been used in rain, on the beach, thrown in the backpack on many bike rides and abused in hours and hours of astrophotography sessions (usually covered in frozen dew), it still looks and behaves almost like new.
B00DMS0LCO,0,12,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,0,13,The replacement asked me to set date and time.To their credit, Amazon made it right quickly and without cost to me, but the fact that it happened at all is a bit of a shock.
B00DMS0LCO,0,14,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,0,15,I have not had the camera for long, so I'm not covering close to all features, but focus on the primary ones (80/20 rule).It was between the T5i, 60D and the 70D for me, prior to picking the 70D.Pros:- While just a bit smaller, the body is almost identical to the 6D, with similar layout and pretty much the same feel (which I love).
B00DMS0LCO,0,16,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,0,17,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,0,18,But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,0,19,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,0,20,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,0,21,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,0,22,I often take photos of birds in flight and I got a lot more keepers compared to my other bodies.
B00DMS0LCO,0,23,When i called canon the guy treated me as if I was stupid and was telling me there is no way that there can be a err 30 code because thats a lens error and usually happens after a lot of use.
B00DMS0LCO,0,24,I don't care how good it works, give me form and function!!
B00DMS0LCO,1,0,Should be better in 2013.
B00DMS0LCO,1,1,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.
B00DMS0LCO,1,2,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.
B00DMS0LCO,1,3,The swivel touch screen is not really comfortable to use with your left hand (considering your right hand is holding the camera).
B00DMS0LCO,1,4,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,1,5,The camera is nice and good, but over rated.It has many cons, some are serious, example:1.Build quality, no way close to a $1000 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,1,6,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,1,7,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,1,8,Touch flip screen.
B00DMS0LCO,1,9,While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,1,10,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,1,11,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,1,12,For a $1200 camera it should have a full frame senor.Their still not there yet.
B00DMS0LCO,1,13,A 4 or 5 steps.
B00DMS0LCO,1,14,I have not had the camera for long, so I'm not covering close to all features, but focus on the primary ones (80/20 rule).It was between the T5i, 60D and the 70D for me, prior to picking the 70D.Pros:- While just a bit smaller, the body is almost identical to the 6D, with similar layout and pretty much the same feel (which I love).
B00DMS0LCO,1,15,The 19 point autofocus system, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder, consistently miss-focus the pictures, with my Canon 300mm F4 IS L lens.
B00DMS0LCO,1,16,Responsiveness is just as good as on my iPod Touch.-
B00DMS0LCO,1,17,I have tried most of the tests, micro-adjustments, and other recommendations for those with similar problems, but nothing gives me a consistent focused picture.
B00DMS0LCO,1,18,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,1,19,Review mostly for still image photography and compared to 6D and T2i (550D) Second Update (3/15): I tried another sample and phase detection autofocus works a lot better on this one.
B00DMS0LCO,1,20,I don't care how good it works, give me form and function!!
B00DMS0LCO,1,21,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,1,22,I tried 3 cameras and all have the same problem.
B00DMS0LCO,1,23,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,1,24,We have to hold off until they produce a camera with a full frame senor for a reasonable price.
B00DMS0LCO,2,0,If I can't buy a Pro camera for $4000.00
B00DMS0LCO,2,1,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,2,2,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.
B00DMS0LCO,2,3,give me one that feels like a pro camera (like you did with the 40D).
B00DMS0LCO,2,4,The 19 point autofocus system, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder, consistently miss-focus the pictures, with my Canon 300mm F4 IS L lens.
B00DMS0LCO,2,5,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,2,6,I don't mean the price (that's not cheap)I mean the construction.
B00DMS0LCO,2,7,I know it's not a "PRO" camera but it is a "prosumer".
B00DMS0LCO,2,8,I Just have one big observation, CHEAP!!
B00DMS0LCO,2,9,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,2,10,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,2,11,Auto-focus.
B00DMS0LCO,2,12,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,2,13,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,2,14,For a $1200 camera it should have a full frame senor.Their still not there yet.
B00DMS0LCO,2,15,While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,2,16,So I bumped it up a star, but not back to the original 4 stars, given the existence of QC problems and lack of improvement in sensor performance.===========================================================================================================================Update:
B00DMS0LCO,2,17,Regardless of the focus mode you use, none works well for moving subjects.The camera takes nice pictures, but there are many better options, and with the release of the new Sony A6000, this camera is good only if you already invested in canon glass, and sadly most of it won't work with this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,2,18,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.
B00DMS0LCO,2,19,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,2,20,Over priced not a full frame sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,2,21,Works like a charm (after I got used to the somewhat tinny sound of the shutter).-
B00DMS0LCO,2,22,For some, who want more ruggedness, such as found in the 7D or 5D's, this might be a negative.
B00DMS0LCO,2,23,I hate the feel!!
B00DMS0LCO,2,24,Bought this camera for its auto-focus, returned this camera due to autofocus.
B00DMS0LCO,3,0,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,3,1,It would still work but it was not tactile.
B00DMS0LCO,3,2,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,3,3,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,3,4,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.
B00DMS0LCO,3,5,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,3,6,Auto Focus Problems on 3 Canon 70d's.
B00DMS0LCO,3,7,Most reviews made it sound like a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,3,8,I have tried most of the tests, micro-adjustments, and other recommendations for those with similar problems, but nothing gives me a consistent focused picture.
B00DMS0LCO,3,9,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,3,10,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,3,11,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,3,12,A 4 or 5 steps.
B00DMS0LCO,3,13,I don't care how good it works, give me form and function!!
B00DMS0LCO,3,14,I am at a loss to see the overwhelming positive reviews of the Canon 70D, although this is a large part of my purchasing them.
B00DMS0LCO,3,15,The photos all came out looking perfect with no underexposure whatsoever.
B00DMS0LCO,3,16,Based on all the great reviews, it may only be only some batches - I do not know.
B00DMS0LCO,3,17,Poor customer service is beyond doubt.
B00DMS0LCO,3,18,Now, the T2i has great image quality (especially based on the year when it came out), but noise and dynamic range are practically the same.
B00DMS0LCO,3,19,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,3,20,With a zoom that has a variable aperture, it's a hit and miss approach and quite cumbersome.Also, I tried the same lenses attached to my Canon T3i taking the same photos as I did with the 70D using the same flash and diffuser without using FEL.
B00DMS0LCO,3,21,If I can't buy a Pro camera for $4000.00
B00DMS0LCO,3,22,Research focus problems before you buy it.
B00DMS0LCO,3,23,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,3,24,Works like a charm (after I got used to the somewhat tinny sound of the shutter).-
B00DMS0LCO,4,0,It's a great camera with an outstanding feature set.
B00DMS0LCO,4,1,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,4,2,first camera was set up to shoot RAW.
B00DMS0LCO,4,3,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,4,4,All photos with and without FEL were properly exposed and looked great.I use bounce flash indoors a lot for our one year old granddaughter.
B00DMS0LCO,4,5,I use the same flash setup in the flash's manual mode, without using FEL, and adjust the power down to say 1/2 or 1/4 or somewhere in between, the photos seem properly exposed (as long as I dial in the correct flash power adjustment).
B00DMS0LCO,4,6,Uses flash for low-light focus which will blind your subject.-
B00DMS0LCO,4,7,The photos all came out looking perfect with no underexposure whatsoever.
B00DMS0LCO,4,8,She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one.
B00DMS0LCO,4,9,For the same camera settings, the 70D produces much more aggressive image settings than my T2i, which makes the 70D performance look much better at first glance.
B00DMS0LCO,4,10,Image quality in low light a bit noisy- Auto-Focus on the center focus point required +17 manual focus adjustment with a new 50mm f1.4.
B00DMS0LCO,4,11,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,4,12,It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots.
B00DMS0LCO,4,13,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,4,14,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,4,15,Same results with bouncing the flash off the ceiling.
B00DMS0LCO,4,16,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.
B00DMS0LCO,4,17,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,4,18,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,4,19,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,4,20,date was set on the first camera.
B00DMS0LCO,4,21,Note, MFA adjustments only apply to P, Av, Tv and M modes.Search for Youtube video "70D Bad Focus Issues" by CameraRec Toby for more info on the focusing issue.
B00DMS0LCO,4,22,Fantastic camera held back by poor software and auto focus issues.
B00DMS0LCO,4,23,understand that the "game changing" capabilities of this camera are on the video side, but I don't shoot a lot of video and there are plenty reviews out there on that topic.
B00DMS0LCO,4,24,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,5,0,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.
B00DMS0LCO,5,1,Should be better in 2013.
B00DMS0LCO,5,2,The focusing appeared to be very fast and accurate except later I found most of my images were not properly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,5,3,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.
B00DMS0LCO,5,4,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,5,5,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,5,6,Works like a charm (after I got used to the somewhat tinny sound of the shutter).-
B00DMS0LCO,5,7,For the same camera settings, the 70D produces much more aggressive image settings than my T2i, which makes the 70D performance look much better at first glance.
B00DMS0LCO,5,8,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.
B00DMS0LCO,5,9,7 fps.

B00DMS0LCO,5,12,Responsiveness is just as good as on my iPod Touch.-
B00DMS0LCO,5,13,It also chooses a high ISO when using the flash (like 1600) guaranteeing some graininess.
B00DMS0LCO,5,14,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,5,15,It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots.
B00DMS0LCO,5,16,A 4 or 5 steps.
B00DMS0LCO,5,17,I use the same flash setup in the flash's manual mode, without using FEL, and adjust the power down to say 1/2 or 1/4 or somewhere in between, the photos seem properly exposed (as long as I dial in the correct flash power adjustment).
B00DMS0LCO,5,18,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,5,19,For a $1200 camera it should have a full frame senor.Their still not there yet.
B00DMS0LCO,5,20,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,5,21,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,5,22,Maybe not as good as I would expect, but the keeper rate is considerably higher.
B00DMS0LCO,5,23,Long exposure behavior (I use it for astro pictures at 2-5 minute exposure) is really no difference to the already great T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,5,24,In fact, I can't tell the difference between unprocessed results from both sensors, even at 100%, for ISO 800 and below.
B00DMS0LCO,6,0,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,6,1,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,6,2,In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card.
B00DMS0LCO,6,3,A 4 or 5 steps.
B00DMS0LCO,6,4,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,6,5,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,6,6,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,6,7,In fact, I can't tell the difference between unprocessed results from both sensors, even at 100%, for ISO 800 and below.

B00DMS0LCO,6,11,I thought about getting a replacement but worried about quality control.UPDATE:  I decided to take a chance and purchase a replacement 70D (from a different online retailer this time) and I'm having similar focus issues with it.
B00DMS0LCO,6,12,I use the same flash setup in the flash's manual mode, without using FEL, and adjust the power down to say 1/2 or 1/4 or somewhere in between, the photos seem properly exposed (as long as I dial in the correct flash power adjustment).
B00DMS0LCO,6,13,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,6,14,Two Defective Units Before Heading to Best Buy.
B00DMS0LCO,6,15,Microphone is even more worthless.I plugged in external shotgun mic with a 1/8 adapter.
B00DMS0LCO,6,16,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.
B00DMS0LCO,6,17,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,6,18,The swivel touch screen is not really comfortable to use with your left hand (considering your right hand is holding the camera).
B00DMS0LCO,6,19,I'm using the kit lens (ef-s 18-135 stm).
B00DMS0LCO,6,20,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.
B00DMS0LCO,6,21,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,6,22,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,6,23,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,6,24,When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't.
B00DMS0LCO,7,0,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,7,1,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,7,2,Now, the T2i has great image quality (especially based on the year when it came out), but noise and dynamic range are practically the same.
B00DMS0LCO,7,3,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.
B00DMS0LCO,7,4,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.

B00DMS0LCO,7,19,The only significant difference is that DPP takes a lot longer to generate the high definition view...  Now, in a way, that still justifies having a full frame camera (and I prefer the smaller APS-C sensor for astrophotography and wild life), the 6D is just an order of magnitude better when it comes to image quality, but one could have hoped for some improvements over the last 4-5 years here.
B00DMS0LCO,7,20,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,7,21,The camera is nice and good, but over rated.It has many cons, some are serious, example:1.Build quality, no way close to a $1000 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,7,22,I have not had the camera for long, so I'm not covering close to all features, but focus on the primary ones (80/20 rule).It was between the T5i, 60D and the 70D for me, prior to picking the 70D.Pros:- While just a bit smaller, the body is almost identical to the 6D, with similar layout and pretty much the same feel (which I love).
B00DMS0LCO,7,23,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.
B00DMS0LCO,7,24,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,8,0,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.
B00DMS0LCO,8,1,Good kit lens.

B00DMS0LCO,8,17,While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,8,18,In fact the poor build quality affects the controls, like the rear wheel, it's so cheap plastic that it's difficult to turn.2.Focus: With the kit lens(I have the 18-135mm) is good and accurate, but forget about it if you will use most other lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,8,19,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.

B00DMS0LCO,9,14,Some report significant low light performance improvements over the older 18 MP sensor, but you might want to check the noise reduction settings in DPP.
B00DMS0LCO,9,15,Maybe not as good as I would expect, but the keeper rate is considerably higher.
B00DMS0LCO,9,16,We have to hold off until they produce a camera with a full frame senor for a reasonable price.

B00DMS0LCO,9,22,Over priced.
B00DMS0LCO,9,23,Setting noise reduction to 0 (or the same value) for both, will make such differences mostly go away...Overall, the additional features (such as wireless, better auto-focus, better body, LCD display) make it worth the higher price compared to the T5i and 60D (at least the first two here) to me, but ultimately, you can probably take the same quality still pictures with all three (at least if the subject is not moving too fast...).

B00DMS0LCO,10,6,I'm honestly beginning to wonder if Amazon buys some manufacturer's QC rejects for a discounted price.Triple check everything you buy from Amazon for defects and also verify that you haven't bought a counterfeit item.
B00DMS0LCO,10,7,As a result, I've paid full-price for an 'open-box' (being charitable) product.
B00DMS0LCO,10,8,I am at a loss to see the overwhelming positive reviews of the Canon 70D, although this is a large part of my purchasing them.
B00DMS0LCO,10,9,No one will say it but switch from a solid "prosumer" camera like my Canon 40D (now 7 years old) and the 70D feels like a kids toy.

B00DMS0LCO,10,14,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,10,15,However, consider other sellers.Amazon's performance on my purchase was appalling and possibly fraudulent.
B00DMS0LCO,10,16,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,10,17,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,10,18,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,10,19,When i called canon the guy treated me as if I was stupid and was telling me there is no way that there can be a err 30 code because thats a lens error and usually happens after a lot of use.
B00DMS0LCO,10,20,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,10,21,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,10,22,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,10,23,Based on all the great reviews, it may only be only some batches - I do not know.

B00DMS0LCO,11,14,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,11,15,Using your smart phone or iPad/iPod as a remote, without much complications, is something that I got hooked on with the 6D.-
B00DMS0LCO,11,16,Regardless of the focus mode you use, none works well for moving subjects.The camera takes nice pictures, but there are many better options, and with the release of the new Sony A6000, this camera is good only if you already invested in canon glass, and sadly most of it won't work with this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,11,17,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).

B00DMS0LCO,11,24,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,12,0,Surprising!3.The video: While many say it's great, it's no way compared to the Sony cameras.
B00DMS0LCO,12,1,I have not explored it in detail, but out of the box it works great.
B00DMS0LCO,12,2,Regardless of the focus mode you use, none works well for moving subjects.The camera takes nice pictures, but there are many better options, and with the release of the new Sony A6000, this camera is good only if you already invested in canon glass, and sadly most of it won't work with this camera.
B00DMS0LCO,12,3,A 4 or 5 steps.
B00DMS0LCO,12,4,understand that the "game changing" capabilities of this camera are on the video side, but I don't shoot a lot of video and there are plenty reviews out there on that topic.
B00DMS0LCO,12,5,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,12,6,It's a great camera with an outstanding feature set.
B00DMS0LCO,12,7,there are so many options, just sadly not this one.
B00DMS0LCO,12,8,a sony RX100?
B00DMS0LCO,12,9,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,12,10,They were polite and blamed them selves not the canon.
B00DMS0LCO,12,11,Now, the T2i has great image quality (especially based on the year when it came out), but noise and dynamic range are practically the same.
B00DMS0LCO,12,12,I often take photos of birds in flight and I got a lot more keepers compared to my other bodies.
B00DMS0LCO,12,13,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,12,14,Also the canon is sticking to the 30p.
B00DMS0LCO,12,15,Lots of great positive reviews on here.
B00DMS0LCO,12,16,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,12,17,I tried 3 cameras and all have the same problem.
B00DMS0LCO,12,18,I wanted to like it and gave it a few more tries and chances, but the results were consistent (in a bad way).
B00DMS0LCO,12,19,Works like a charm (after I got used to the somewhat tinny sound of the shutter).-
B00DMS0LCO,12,20,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,12,21,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.
B00DMS0LCO,12,22,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,12,23,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,12,24,Half of the still photos were not clearly focused.
B00DMS0LCO,13,0,When I get the battery, there is no power in it.
B00DMS0LCO,13,1,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,13,2,used camera had the battery fully charged.
B00DMS0LCO,13,3,break battery.
B00DMS0LCO,13,4,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,13,5,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,13,6,Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.
B00DMS0LCO,13,7,The replacement asked me to set date and time.To their credit, Amazon made it right quickly and without cost to me, but the fact that it happened at all is a bit of a shock.
B00DMS0LCO,13,8,The replacement started charging from 0-49%.-The rear lens cap on the kit lens was marred noticeably.-The
B00DMS0LCO,13,9,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,13,10,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,13,11,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,13,12,The only way to recover from this was to remove and reseat the battery.-The
B00DMS0LCO,13,13,I think this product was opened before I get it.
B00DMS0LCO,13,14,Coupled with the fact you have just 1 custom WB, is a difficult job.6.Program shift: you have to do it for every single shot if you shoot in P mood.
B00DMS0LCO,13,15,I use the same flash setup in the flash's manual mode, without using FEL, and adjust the power down to say 1/2 or 1/4 or somewhere in between, the photos seem properly exposed (as long as I dial in the correct flash power adjustment).
B00DMS0LCO,13,16,There should be a CD and several errata and warranty cards loose.
B00DMS0LCO,13,17,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,13,18,first camera was set up to shoot RAW.
B00DMS0LCO,13,19,All photos with and without FEL were properly exposed and looked great.I use bounce flash indoors a lot for our one year old granddaughter.
B00DMS0LCO,13,20,I tried 3 cameras and all have the same problem.
B00DMS0LCO,13,21,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.

B00DMS0LCO,14,12,The swivel touch screen is not really comfortable to use with your left hand (considering your right hand is holding the camera).

B00DMS0LCO,16,9,The Sony RX10 has 3 custom WB and the 70D has just one.5.WB: if you want to chance the custom WB, you have to go and dig into the main menu.
B00DMS0LCO,16,10,I had not heard of any focusing issues but a quick internet search on "70D focus issues" yielded a large volume of unhappy customers who have spent a lot of time researching the issue.
B00DMS0LCO,16,11,I gave it a 1 star because of the customer service I received from canon not for the camera itself because i never got see how the camera performs.
B00DMS0LCO,16,12,Most reviews made it sound like a great camera.
B00DMS0LCO,16,13,Upon using the camera for the first time, and transferring the photos to my computer, I noticed that the first image number was number 7695!
B00DMS0LCO,16,14,If you get a camera that is used I would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one.
B00DMS0LCO,16,15,When i called canon the guy treated me as if I was stupid and was telling me there is no way that there can be a err 30 code because thats a lens error and usually happens after a lot of use.

B00DMS0LCO,16,20,I was very anxious for this camera to arrive with all the hype about its enhanced focusing attributes especially for LiveView and in Movie mode.

B00DMS0LCO,17,20,date was set on the first camera.
B00DMS0LCO,17,21,It also chooses a high ISO when using the flash (like 1600) guaranteeing some graininess.
B00DMS0LCO,17,22,Review mostly for still image photography and compared to 6D and T2i (550D) Second Update (3/15): I tried another sample and phase detection autofocus works a lot better on this one.

B00DMS0LCO,18,7,Example: you can not assign the buttons you like.
B00DMS0LCO,18,8,I hate the feel!!
B00DMS0LCO,18,9,It was snapping and noisyThe onboard microphone was just as bad.
B00DMS0LCO,18,10,Coupled with the fact you have just 1 custom WB, is a difficult job.6.Program shift: you have to do it for every single shot if you shoot in P mood.

B00DMS0LCO,18,14,I had to get mine replaced  because the shutter button suddenly stopped bouncing back up.
B00DMS0LCO,18,15,I am afraid to shoot with it!
B00DMS0LCO,18,16,No one will say it but switch from a solid "prosumer" camera like my Canon 40D (now 7 years old) and the 70D feels like a kids toy.
B00DMS0LCO,18,17,The 19 point autofocus, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder,  will ONLY focus on the closest subject, no matter what the main subject of the frame is.
B00DMS0LCO,18,18,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.

B00DMS0LCO,18,20,In fact, I can't tell the difference between unprocessed results from both sensors, even at 100%, for ISO 800 and below.
B00DMS0LCO,18,21,The camera is nice and good, but over rated.It has many cons, some are serious, example:1.Build quality, no way close to a $1000 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,18,22,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,18,23,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.

B00DMS0LCO,19,2,When I put the SD card into my computer really wanted to be excited and wanted to love what I was seeing but I wasn't.
B00DMS0LCO,19,3,The first thing I did was charge the battery, the next thing I did was take photos of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,19,4,In other words, I paid for a new camera and got a used one!I immediately returned it.When you purchase a new camera, the first image should say (when transferred to your computer) img_0001, the next img_0002, etc.This has absolutely nothing to do with your memory card.
B00DMS0LCO,19,5,Here are some cons to think about if they effect you:- Cannot sync full sized JPG and RAW files to Android- Cannot directly upload to Facebook or my TV via DLNA- Cannot take video while WIFI is enabled- Does not support USB 3.0- No IR focus headlight.
B00DMS0LCO,19,6,Arrived quickly as promised, but would not recognize or format mem card.
B00DMS0LCO,19,7,She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one.
B00DMS0LCO,19,8,I am an amateur photographer and my new 70D that I purchased a couple months ago at B&H; has been doing the same underexposure stunt that so many others have experienced (For example, see in depth discussions by searching the internet for Canon 70D bounce flash underexposure).This occurs whether I'm bouncing the flash off a white ceiling that's about eight feet high or using a Sto-fen diffuser attached to my Canon 430ex II in E-TTL mode.Whether the lens being used is the Canon 15-85 or the 55-250 STM, all low light indoor photos with the diffuser attached and with the flash head tilted 45 degrees, or 180 degrees, or direct facing are very underexposed.
B00DMS0LCO,19,9,I guess I'll have to resort to FEL use, but that amount flashes takes a toll on an infant.
B00DMS0LCO,19,10,the Battery does not work, even I charge the power.
B00DMS0LCO,19,11,My home is reasonably well lit and I was surprised when the flash popped up as I attempted to take a photo of my daughter.
B00DMS0LCO,19,12,Microphone is even more worthless.I plugged in external shotgun mic with a 1/8 adapter.
B00DMS0LCO,19,13,I never had this problem, or any other issue, with my T3i.
B00DMS0LCO,19,14,Unless they come up with a fix fairly quickly, I'm not sure I'd ever buy another Canon camera after this.
B00DMS0LCO,19,15,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,19,16,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,19,17,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,19,18,All photos with and without FEL were properly exposed and looked great.I use bounce flash indoors a lot for our one year old granddaughter.
B00DMS0LCO,19,19,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.
B00DMS0LCO,19,20,I also took some video which caused the lens to hunt even though the camera was pointed directly at my daughter and the room was well lit.
B00DMS0LCO,19,21,If I can't buy a Pro camera for $4000.00
B00DMS0LCO,19,22,The flash is working 100% this time but the images are still blurry when using full auto through the viewfinder (live view focuses properly).
B00DMS0LCO,19,23,I use the same flash setup in the flash's manual mode, without using FEL, and adjust the power down to say 1/2 or 1/4 or somewhere in between, the photos seem properly exposed (as long as I dial in the correct flash power adjustment).
B00DMS0LCO,19,24,Note, MFA adjustments only apply to P, Av, Tv and M modes.Search for Youtube video "70D Bad Focus Issues" by CameraRec Toby for more info on the focusing issue.
B00DMS0LCO,20,0,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,20,1,One like this and another small P&S; I can carry in my pocket.
B00DMS0LCO,20,2,I have cheaper canons that do a better job.
B00DMS0LCO,20,3,I have owned DSLR's before, and I was happy with my Nikon which died after getting sand in the lens which was too expensive to replace.
B00DMS0LCO,20,4,I realized I might get better results with a better (prime?) lens but I also realized that the camera was just too big and heavy and that I was probably going to leave it home most of the time.
B00DMS0LCO,20,5,a sony RX100?
B00DMS0LCO,20,6,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,20,7,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,20,8,Maybe there is a middle ground, a camera that can offer both small size and great features.
B00DMS0LCO,20,9,Disappointing Camera.
B00DMS0LCO,20,10,A 4 or 5 steps.
B00DMS0LCO,20,11,Should be better in 2013.
B00DMS0LCO,20,12,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.
B00DMS0LCO,20,13,Maybe I got a bad piece, I still expect better quality control for a camera that cost over a 1000 dollars two stars of for that.
B00DMS0LCO,20,14,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,20,15,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,20,16,The only significant difference is that DPP takes a lot longer to generate the high definition view...  Now, in a way, that still justifies having a full frame camera (and I prefer the smaller APS-C sensor for astrophotography and wild life), the 6D is just an order of magnitude better when it comes to image quality, but one could have hoped for some improvements over the last 4-5 years here.
B00DMS0LCO,20,17,Auto Focus Problems on 3 Canon 70d's.
B00DMS0LCO,20,18,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.
B00DMS0LCO,20,19,With that I have decided to return this camera and either wait for the Sony A6000 or maybe find something else better suited to my needs (small with a changeable lens).
B00DMS0LCO,20,20,In fact, I can't tell the difference between unprocessed results from both sensors, even at 100%, for ISO 800 and below.
B00DMS0LCO,20,21,You expect much more from a 20.2mp camera.
B00DMS0LCO,20,22,For a $1200 camera it should have a full frame senor.Their still not there yet.
B00DMS0LCO,20,23,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,20,24,Over priced not a full frame sensor.
B00DMS0LCO,21,0,I'm using the kit lens (ef-s 18-135 stm).
B00DMS0LCO,21,1,The replacement started charging from 0-49%.-The rear lens cap on the kit lens was marred noticeably.-The
B00DMS0LCO,21,2,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,21,3,Err 30.
B00DMS0LCO,21,4,Good kit lens.
B00DMS0LCO,21,5,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.
B00DMS0LCO,21,6,With a zoom that has a variable aperture, it's a hit and miss approach and quite cumbersome.Also, I tried the same lenses attached to my Canon T3i taking the same photos as I did with the 70D using the same flash and diffuser without using FEL.
B00DMS0LCO,21,7,When i called canon the guy treated me as if I was stupid and was telling me there is no way that there can be a err 30 code because thats a lens error and usually happens after a lot of use.
B00DMS0LCO,21,8,On delivery the box was clearly re-sealed, accessory packaging opened, and other signs of hasty re-packaging evident.
B00DMS0LCO,21,9,While I was able to get some nice shots in earlier sessions (primarily with the 400mm lens), I did encounter the autofocus problem now that others have noticed with faster lenses.
B00DMS0LCO,21,10,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,21,11,Comes surprisingly close to the 24-105mm L lens, but with a wider range and a lot lower price.
B00DMS0LCO,21,12,This is most likely due to the lens I used (Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8), but cannot say with 100% certainty.
B00DMS0LCO,21,13,The included strap was from a 5D, not 70D, and (I now know having bought another) that packaging was missing.
B00DMS0LCO,21,14,In fact, I can't tell the difference between unprocessed results from both sensors, even at 100%, for ISO 800 and below.
B00DMS0LCO,21,15,taken with the camera were numbered starting at 2561 instead of 0001.-The

B00DMS0LCO,21,17,Auto Focus Problems on 3 Canon 70d's.
B00DMS0LCO,21,18,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,21,19,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,21,20,Here are signs you can use if you suspect similar:-The USB cable and neck strap should be sealed in individual plastic bags.
B00DMS0LCO,21,21,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,21,22,Unless they come up with a fix fairly quickly, I'm not sure I'd ever buy another Canon camera after this.
B00DMS0LCO,21,23,This is a perfect only body for the serious photographer or a second for full-frame owners.
B00DMS0LCO,21,24,I realized I might get better results with a better (prime?) lens but I also realized that the camera was just too big and heavy and that I was probably going to leave it home most of the time.
B00DMS0LCO,22,0,This is probably due to the kit lens and so I disabled the flash and tried to take photos in the existing light, I then took more photos with the flash.
B00DMS0LCO,22,1,For the same camera settings, the 70D produces much more aggressive image settings than my T2i, which makes the 70D performance look much better at first glance.
B00DMS0LCO,22,2,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,22,3,In fact, I can't tell the difference between unprocessed results from both sensors, even at 100%, for ISO 800 and below.
B00DMS0LCO,22,4,It also chooses a high ISO when using the flash (like 1600) guaranteeing some graininess.
B00DMS0LCO,22,5,All I know is that sometimes (15% of the time) I get a nice clear picture,  but most of the time the pictures are out of focus.
B00DMS0LCO,22,6,It appears that using the viewfinder can cause a large percentage of images to be out of focus but using the LiveView will almost always focus sharply.
B00DMS0LCO,22,7,Some report significant low light performance improvements over the older 18 MP sensor, but you might want to check the noise reduction settings in DPP.
B00DMS0LCO,22,8,But based on first tests, it does not.Cons:- Image quality is pretty much the same as with the T2i.
B00DMS0LCO,22,9,Image quality in low light a bit noisy- Auto-Focus on the center focus point required +17 manual focus adjustment with a new 50mm f1.4.
B00DMS0LCO,22,10,In comparison, my old T2i, while not perfect, missed only 3% with the same shots and lens and the 6D was perfect.
B00DMS0LCO,22,11,Photos were often blurry when using the full auto mode.
B00DMS0LCO,22,12,Occasionally the built-in flash didn't fire even in low light situations.
B00DMS0LCO,22,13,I was able to take well focused and shake-free footage with both the 18-135mm STM kit lens as well as my 24-105mm L lens, without really trying much...My main review though is for the still image use and comparing it to my aging T2i (which this will replace) and my Canon 6D.
B00DMS0LCO,22,14,Based on all the great reviews, it may only be only some batches - I do not know.
B00DMS0LCO,22,15,The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not.
B00DMS0LCO,22,16,I got one that has the focus problem.
B00DMS0LCO,22,17,I'm using the kit lens (ef-s 18-135 stm).
B00DMS0LCO,22,18,Quality of the videos was not full HD when viewed at home.
B00DMS0LCO,22,19,Photo colors were not true unless taken in direct sunlight.
B00DMS0LCO,22,20,Maybe not as good as I would expect, but the keeper rate is considerably higher.
B00DMS0LCO,22,21,It's probably a great camera with the right lens and in the right hands but make sure this is what you really want.
B00DMS0LCO,22,22,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,22,23,It seems to be limited to the center autofocus point, but in certain shooting situations, it missed focus in about 30-50% of my shots.
B00DMS0LCO,22,24,I tried the 50mm 1.4, the 50mm 1.8 and the 85mm 1.8, and with all of them the camera can not focus except in live view.
B00DMS0LCO,23,0,Amazon said it was new, it was not.
B00DMS0LCO,23,1,Got a USED EOS 70D From Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,2,Do not buy a 70D from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,3,Err 30.
B00DMS0LCO,23,4,See the Amazon review by Mr. Ralph J. Secoy.
B00DMS0LCO,23,5,If you get a camera that is used I would return it and keep doing so until you get a new one.
B00DMS0LCO,23,6,I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.
B00DMS0LCO,23,7,Immediate contact with Amazon resulted in an assurance that the product was new and that there was no way this was a returned/re-packaged product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,8,Got a used camera from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,9,I bought two and both were defective out of the box.
B00DMS0LCO,23,10,Since my purchases, I have seen that others have similar problems under reviews at other sites.
B00DMS0LCO,23,11,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
B00DMS0LCO,23,12,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,23,13,I tried 3 cameras and all have the same problem.
B00DMS0LCO,23,14,Amazon is selling used cameras as new!
B00DMS0LCO,23,15,It will be returned.
B00DMS0LCO,23,16,I really liked this camera but had to return it for a defect.
B00DMS0LCO,23,17,This particular purchase was a gift for my sister in Europe, ordered four days before my recent trip.
B00DMS0LCO,23,18,I purchased this camera about a month ago.
B00DMS0LCO,23,19,I'm honestly beginning to wonder if Amazon buys some manufacturer's QC rejects for a discounted price.Triple check everything you buy from Amazon for defects and also verify that you haven't bought a counterfeit item.
B00DMS0LCO,23,20,so needless to say I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.
B00DMS0LCO,23,21,Bought the package and an additional lens for over $1,800 and I guess Amazon thinks it is OK to ship used product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,22,At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.
B00DMS0LCO,23,23,I ended up driving to Best Buy and buying one that was okay.I own about $10,000 worth of cameras and lenses, many of which I attempted to buy from Amazon.
B00DMS0LCO,23,24,Returned for replacement - hope it's OK!
B00DMS0LCO,24,0,Radio Shack folks provided several types listed in the manual as acceptable , but none worked.
B00DMS0LCO,24,1,The menu wheel feels like it cost $2 bucks and should be on a $40.00 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,24,2,Did not work.
B00DMS0LCO,24,3,Come on Canon, It feels like I am holding a $200.00
B00DMS0LCO,24,4,If I can't buy a Pro camera for $4000.00
B00DMS0LCO,24,5,I don't care how good it works, give me form and function!!
B00DMS0LCO,24,6,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,24,7,The Sony RX10 has 3 custom WB and the 70D has just one.5.WB: if you want to chance the custom WB, you have to go and dig into the main menu.
B00DMS0LCO,24,8,I hate the feel!!
B00DMS0LCO,24,9,give me one that feels like a pro camera (like you did with the 40D).

B00DMS0LCO,24,11,In subsequent photography outings I am getting less than 30% focused issues.
B00DMS0LCO,24,12,Coupled with the fact you have just 1 custom WB, is a difficult job.6.Program shift: you have to do it for every single shot if you shoot in P mood.
B00DMS0LCO,24,13,understand that the "game changing" capabilities of this camera are on the video side, but I don't shoot a lot of video and there are plenty reviews out there on that topic.
B00DMS0LCO,24,14,A 4 or 5 steps.
B00DMS0LCO,24,15,It does not remember it.And so many cons.7.Focus, for the second time: Only good for stationary subject.
B00DMS0LCO,24,16,The 19 point autofocus system, when using auto-select mode in the viewfinder, consistently miss-focus the pictures, with my Canon 300mm F4 IS L lens.
B00DMS0LCO,24,17,I am afraid to shoot with it!
B00DMS0LCO,24,18,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,24,19,Read the professional reviews.
B00DMS0LCO,24,20,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,24,21,I use the same flash setup in the flash's manual mode, without using FEL, and adjust the power down to say 1/2 or 1/4 or somewhere in between, the photos seem properly exposed (as long as I dial in the correct flash power adjustment).
B00DMS0LCO,24,22,Excellent camera, build quality could use a little work.
B00DMS0LCO,24,23,Returned for replacement - hope it's OK!
B00DMS0LCO,24,24,Especially selecting the focus point by touch is a nice feature.

B00DMS0LCO,25,2,1.
B00DMS0LCO,25,3,Err 30.
B00DMS0LCO,25,4,I gave it a 1 star because of the customer service I received from canon not for the camera itself because i never got see how the camera performs.
B00DMS0LCO,25,5,I tried 3 cameras and all have the same problem.
B00DMS0LCO,25,6,Took it out for trials 3 times and was disappointed with all 3 shoots.
B00DMS0LCO,25,7,So I bumped it up a star, but not back to the original 4 stars, given the existence of QC problems and lack of improvement in sensor performance.===========================================================================================================================Update:
B00DMS0LCO,25,8,This Canon EOS 70D sold by Amazon.com
B00DMS0LCO,25,9,In fact, I can't tell the difference between unprocessed results from both sensors, even at 100%, for ISO 800 and below.
B00DMS0LCO,25,10,Maybe I got a bad piece, I still expect better quality control for a camera that cost over a 1000 dollars two stars of for that.
B00DMS0LCO,25,11,It is a Brand New Camera, and when I first opened the package, I found quite a few specks of small dusts on the assembly mirror, it is UNACCETABLE manufacturing control when you consider how EXPENSIVE this 1 pound little machine is.Shame on Canon, This camera will DESERVE one Star.
B00DMS0LCO,25,12,does not have Wi-Fi capability, the opposite of the original product description on the Canon USA website.
B00DMS0LCO,25,13,This means that someone (or multiple people) had used this particular camera, had taken 7694 photos with it, returned it, and now I purchased it with 7694 photos "on" the shutter.
B00DMS0LCO,25,14,Never got to take even 1 shot with this camera, straight out of the box I got Error code Err 30 which is a lens error I tried it with the lens off and with it on and still got the same error code.
B00DMS0LCO,25,15,I never had this problem, or any other issue, with my T3i.
B00DMS0LCO,25,16,I was discouraged until someone asked me if I was having focus issues because they were debating on whether to buy this camera but the large volume of focusing issue feedback was making him think twice.
B00DMS0LCO,25,17,I was wondering how canon would release a camera with major defect like this.
B00DMS0LCO,25,18,When i called canon the guy treated me as if I was stupid and was telling me there is no way that there can be a err 30 code because thats a lens error and usually happens after a lot of use.

B00DMS0LCO,25,23,The camera is nice and good, but over rated.It has many cons, some are serious, example:1.Build quality, no way close to a $1000 camera.
B00DMS0LCO,25,24,If you receive a camera that says anything other than img_0001 on your first photo taken, you have a used camera!I have a feeling that this is going on all the time, and people don't catch it (it happened to me with a few other cameras I purchased from Amazon...I returned all of them).
