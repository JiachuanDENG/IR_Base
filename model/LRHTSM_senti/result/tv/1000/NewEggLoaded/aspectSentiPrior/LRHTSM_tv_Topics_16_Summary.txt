B00BCGROJG,0,0,Good picture but not as good as my old Pioneer plazma.
B00BCGROJG,0,1,I think I need to tweek the picture on it a little more but it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,0,2,3 out of 3 screens had a dead pixel.
B00BCGROJG,0,3,There are many, many settings that affect brightness, many settings that affect color balance, etc... so even the last few settings will make a big difference to how the picture looks.
B00BCGROJG,0,4,Angle viewing is distorts the color.
B00BCGROJG,0,5,Great picture quality... leakage of blacks.. First of all.
B00BCGROJG,0,6,Great brights but the darks are not all that :o( I love this TV BUT my only problem is with dark scenes.
B00BCGROJG,0,7,Also, the side viewing angle is not great as screen colors become significantly washed out.
B00BCGROJG,0,8,The picture looks fantastic on these screens.
B00BCGROJG,0,9,Great bright picture, this tv is in our family room and the tv has no problem in a room with light.2.
B00BCGROJG,0,10,Good tv. a lot of good things about this tv.
B00BCGROJG,0,11,Great TV after Adjustment/Tuning.
B00BCGROJG,0,12,This HD LED TV look really good in my living room.
B00BCGROJG,0,13,Great Picture But..... Great picture with amazing contrast and color "pop" but.....the viewing angles are not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,0,14,But if you sit about 45 degrees, the color setting is out of wack.
B00BCGROJG,0,15,The picture quality is amazing during bright scenes.
B00BCGROJG,0,16,However, the picture during dark scenes or if you are watching at night in a dark room is not the best.
B00BCGROJG,0,17,We love the thinness if this tv, it looks like a picture on the wall.
B00BCGROJG,0,18,No dead pixels or anything like that.
B00BCGROJG,0,19,The TV physical size is great and thin, but the viewing angle on this TV is bad.
B00BCGROJG,0,20,Each screen had exactly one dead pixel.
B00BCGROJG,0,21,Great TV!
B00BCGROJG,0,22,Great picture quality out the box!
B00BCGROJG,0,23,Good value for $1600.
B00BCGROJG,0,24,Very good picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,1,0,Its good for the price.
B00BCGROJG,1,1,Great picture/dead in 3 months.
B00BCGROJG,1,2,Samsung 65 in.
B00BCGROJG,1,3,Other than that great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,4,Great TV but a quirk.
B00BCGROJG,1,5,Do I think the picture quality is as good as the PANNY?
B00BCGROJG,1,6,Good picture but not as good as my old Pioneer plazma.
B00BCGROJG,1,7,I think I need to tweek the picture on it a little more but it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,1,8,Great LED for price, but remote not the best.
B00BCGROJG,1,9,Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,1,10,Not plasma but very good for LCD LED.
B00BCGROJG,1,11,Otherwise a great television.
B00BCGROJG,1,12,Dont buy Samsung - they don't last.
B00BCGROJG,1,13,Same quality, different year.
B00BCGROJG,1,14,Everything looks great after 1 month of ownership.
B00BCGROJG,1,15,Good value for $1600.
B00BCGROJG,1,16,This is a very nice LED for the price.
B00BCGROJG,1,17,Overall, for people who do not own the 2011, or 2012 models, this tv is a GREAT buy.
B00BCGROJG,1,18,As good as my 6 year old Samsung Plasma.. pretty much.
B00BCGROJG,1,19,I know that in 2011, the d7000 was the best, but now that it is 2 years later, the f7100 should exceed it..
B00BCGROJG,1,20,I have now had this TV for about 2 months and it works great.
B00BCGROJG,1,21,In summary - don't buy Samsung led TVs unless you want to pay hundreds of dollars in repairs.At first my TV picture would go blank intermittently and this was right after I bought my TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,22,Even though my husband and I swore off Samsung because of the issues with our plasma TV, we fell in love with it because the picture looked awesome compared to the other TVs in the store.
B00BCGROJG,1,23,I am happy OVERALL with the set because it really does have the best picture from an LCD of this size I have seen under $9,000.
B00BCGROJG,1,24,I recent bought this TV to replace my 5 years old Sony LCD TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,0,Great Picture, poor sound.
B00BCGROJG,2,1,The speakers are good too.
B00BCGROJG,2,2,Great Picture Quality but not so great sound quality.
B00BCGROJG,2,3,picture is great, sound is OK (but that's why you have a home theater system).
B00BCGROJG,2,4,Sound quality is good too.
B00BCGROJG,2,5,The TV picture quality is amazing, however the sound quality is really poor.
B00BCGROJG,2,6,great picture, lousy gimmicks.
B00BCGROJG,2,7,Great TV!
B00BCGROJG,2,8,Very nice picture.
B00BCGROJG,2,9,After a little research, it turns out that the wireless system they use is just not good.
B00BCGROJG,2,10,I've tried all audio settings and it doesn't get any better
B00BCGROJG,2,11,Great picture but back access panel to tv buzzes when low bass tones are coming from speakers had to wedge a piece of rubber under panel to stop buzzing
B00BCGROJG,2,12,As expected, the picture is great!
B00BCGROJG,2,13,The picture is excellent.
B00BCGROJG,2,14,every time when i turn on the TV, the sound bar is turned on automatically.
B00BCGROJG,2,15,The picture looks good, but I suspect it will look much better after adjusting it like other folks have had to do.
B00BCGROJG,2,16,Good picture but not as good as my old Pioneer plazma.
B00BCGROJG,2,17,Sometimes it works fine and other times I have to turn my tv off and on every 5 minutes.
B00BCGROJG,2,18,The quality, sound, picture is excellent!
B00BCGROJG,2,19,The louder you make the sound, the louder that dink noises becomes.
B00BCGROJG,2,20,Everything looks great after 1 month of ownership.
B00BCGROJG,2,21,I am happy with the unit, but not amazed.
B00BCGROJG,2,22,Set-up was easy too.I went from a 12 year rear projection unit to this new flat panel, the picture is definately better, but I guess my expectation where a little to high.
B00BCGROJG,2,23,We love the thinness if this tv, it looks like a picture on the wall.
B00BCGROJG,2,24,Samsung 7100 great quality for the money.
B00BCGROJG,3,0,Great TV - Not So Great Delivery Service.
B00BCGROJG,3,1,The delivery service NEVER reached out to me to set up a delivery time or to verify my phone #.
B00BCGROJG,3,2,I bought this a Christmas gift and had it shipped to Canada, since amazon wouldn't ship to Toronto.
B00BCGROJG,3,3,the day of delivery the driver would call ahead to confirm with me.  it was scheduled for 10am-2pm.
B00BCGROJG,3,4,TV arrived on time (2 days!) and worked no problem.
B00BCGROJG,3,5,A few more days go by and I receive a  voicemail from another representative requesting that I call them back.
B00BCGROJG,3,6,After a half hour she called back and said to call the driver.
B00BCGROJG,3,7,I noticed that the tv was at the delivery station so i called them to see what the status was and the girl there said, "what day would you like the tv delivered?"
B00BCGROJG,3,8,I WILL NEVER ORDER A BIG ITEM ON AMAZON AGAIN.
B00BCGROJG,3,9,The TV shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,10,A few days went by but no email arrived.
B00BCGROJG,3,11,We ordered the TV through Amazon and they delivered on time and it was very easy to deal with them.
B00BCGROJG,3,12,Awesome TV for 3 days, Delivery was not the best.
B00BCGROJG,3,13,Then they will really try to screw you and nopt service or replace the TV.
B00BCGROJG,3,14,Samsung got the tech.
B00BCGROJG,3,15,I had to wait longer than expected due to the shipping company's availability.
B00BCGROJG,3,16,Amazon was great.
B00BCGROJG,3,17,We received the TV on the promised ship date.
B00BCGROJG,3,18,Love the tv HATED the delivery service in my area.
B00BCGROJG,3,19,After 5 phone calls to Samsung, a rep decided we had the wrong screws and said he would send the correct ones that day.
B00BCGROJG,3,20,i called the girl back and she repeated my number back that was absolutely wrong.
B00BCGROJG,3,21,When I screwed in the first base, the plastic was stripped, so I called Samsung and another was shipped to me for free.
B00BCGROJG,3,22,Five days later I get a phone call finally acknowledging receipt of my email, and I was told it would take another seven to fourteen days for me to receive the needed hardware.
B00BCGROJG,3,23,I ended up helping the delivery guy unbox the unit.
B00BCGROJG,3,24,Fast and easy delivery.
B00BCGROJG,4,0,Awsome picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,4,1,Great Picture Quality but not so great sound quality.
B00BCGROJG,4,2,Great Picture, poor sound.
B00BCGROJG,4,3,It took me awhile to get my picture quality the way I liked it.
B00BCGROJG,4,4,The picture quality is good.
B00BCGROJG,4,5,Do I think the picture quality is as good as the PANNY?
B00BCGROJG,4,6,I don't but this is a great TV.
B00BCGROJG,4,7,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,4,8,Great Picture but so many settings it takes forever to set the colors and picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,4,9,The TV is great, picture quality is phenomenal.
B00BCGROJG,4,10,Very good picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,4,11,The picture is great and it was easy to setup.
B00BCGROJG,4,12,The TV picture quality is amazing, however the sound quality is really poor.
B00BCGROJG,4,13,Great picture quality... leakage of blacks.. First of all.
B00BCGROJG,4,14,Beautiful picture, once set up.So this is a great tv.
B00BCGROJG,4,15,The quality, sound, picture is excellent!
B00BCGROJG,4,16,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,4,17,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,4,18,Good picture but not as good as my old Pioneer plazma.
B00BCGROJG,4,19,The picture is excellent.
B00BCGROJG,4,20,Great picture quality out the box!
B00BCGROJG,4,21,At first this TV has an amazing picture and some great features.
B00BCGROJG,4,22,Picture is very sharp and I am pleasantly amazed by the picture quality however audio quality is poor.
B00BCGROJG,4,23,Great TV - Very Thin - Good Value.
B00BCGROJG,4,24,Great TV!
B00BCGROJG,5,0,Great buy.
B00BCGROJG,5,1,Samsung 7100 great quality for the money.
B00BCGROJG,5,2,Based on picture quality alone, it is a great buy for the money.
B00BCGROJG,5,3,I would not recommend this Samsung nor would I buy another one.
B00BCGROJG,5,4,Very good product.
B00BCGROJG,5,5,Very good picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,5,6,The TV is a decent value for the features and price but would caution anyone looking for a high quality product.
B00BCGROJG,5,7,Great picture quality out the box!
B00BCGROJG,5,8,good nice price nice 3d system.Please buy now there is no regret..thanks too
B00BCGROJG,5,9,This is my first ever Samsung product.
B00BCGROJG,5,10,At first this TV has an amazing picture and some great features.
B00BCGROJG,5,11,Great Picture Quality but not so great sound quality.
B00BCGROJG,5,12,I'm not going to repeat what a lot of the reviews have already said about the picture.
B00BCGROJG,5,13,Excellent product.
B00BCGROJG,5,14,Nice 240 Hz refresh rate.
B00BCGROJG,5,15,I would definitely buy it again and recommend it, but they need a redesign on their remote.
B00BCGROJG,5,16,Very nice picture.
B00BCGROJG,5,17,Also, the response rate is great.
B00BCGROJG,5,18,Samsung UN60F7100 Has Amazing Picture Qaulity.
B00BCGROJG,5,19,I have always owned LG products (mostly Televisions), but I decided to go with Samsung after seeing a friend of mines television set.Picture quality is great.
B00BCGROJG,5,20,the video quality is great but that's the only positive thing I can say about it.
B00BCGROJG,5,21,Great buy but I didn't expect the touch-pad type remote control.Easy to follow the manual provided for setting up.
B00BCGROJG,5,22,I am happy OVERALL with the set because it really does have the best picture from an LCD of this size I have seen under $9,000.
B00BCGROJG,5,23,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,5,24,The TV picture quality is amazing, however the sound quality is really poor.
B00BCGROJG,6,0,The internet apps (Netflix and Hulu) work great.
B00BCGROJG,6,1,Samsung un65f7100 3d smart tv .very
B00BCGROJG,6,2,Its good.
B00BCGROJG,6,3,I had to play with the settings on my tv and xbox to get it working again.
B00BCGROJG,6,4,It works fine now on gaming mode, but I still can't have the numbers come up in diablo 3.  Otherwise the tv works great.
B00BCGROJG,6,5,Conversion of 2D to3 D was not great but playing 3D movies is a great experience.
B00BCGROJG,6,6,In regards to the smart features, a good Blueray player or Playstation 3/4 will render all of the apps sluggish, bland and overall worthless.
B00BCGROJG,6,7,I have the 7100 set up primarily  for watching movies.
B00BCGROJG,6,8,It has great picture, the apps work great, and the sound is is decent (which is all you can ask for on tvs now-a-days).
B00BCGROJG,6,9,As expected, the picture is great!
B00BCGROJG,6,10,The picture quality is good.
B00BCGROJG,6,11,Very good only one thing when u whatch back 90s or begining 20s movies look very fake movie lol i mean this tv has lot of tech those movie seems to be very stedio filmApp look ok but skype never come up
B00BCGROJG,6,12,I think I need to tweek the picture on it a little more but it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,6,13,We played a few Sony Demos on it as well as watched a few 3d movies on it, and It was marginally better than the Samsung UN75F7100.
B00BCGROJG,6,14,Up scaling 2D to 3D quite good.
B00BCGROJG,6,15,great picture, lousy gimmicks.
B00BCGROJG,6,16,Also the 4k is more expensive by $2000.The 3d movies we watched were nearly just as good on the UN75F7100.
B00BCGROJG,6,17,good nice price nice 3d system.Please buy now there is no regret..thanks too
B00BCGROJG,6,18,It said it had registered on the screen, but 3D didn't work.
B00BCGROJG,6,19,If you are going to use this TV for primarily watching movies or 3D content,  I would recommend at a minimum the 55" or 60" screens.
B00BCGROJG,6,20,Very nice smart tv.
B00BCGROJG,6,21,It said I should re-install the app.
B00BCGROJG,6,22,They sometimes take a good minute to detect that the TV is playing a 3D movies.
B00BCGROJG,6,23,I have given 4 stars because the response time is more while browsing the apps.
B00BCGROJG,6,24,Very good picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,7,0,I set up each hdmi port specifically for their purpose, TV, Bluray, and 360.
B00BCGROJG,7,1,I have a connection of 30MB with cable connections, a very good, strong connection from an ASUS N66u Dual band router.
B00BCGROJG,7,2,I am very happy with it, especially the fact that it connects to my TV's remote via Samsung's 'Anynet' connection.
B00BCGROJG,7,3,Beside the HDMI inputs, you can connect only 1 component video source OR 1 composite video source, not both at the same time.
B00BCGROJG,7,4,The picture is excellent and has plenty of features (more that I need)Now the cons : You can not set up favorites on a HDMI connection and the full tv guide is always opened at channel 1.
B00BCGROJG,7,5,Beautiful picture, once set up.So this is a great tv.
B00BCGROJG,7,6,If that is used to view the tv while browsing channels, then the default setting of tiny tvand giant channel icons doesn't do any good.
B00BCGROJG,7,7,Good tv. a lot of good things about this tv.
B00BCGROJG,7,8,Web-link (using ethernet cable) works OK but limited usefulness.
B00BCGROJG,7,9,I love being able to see all my pictures and videos any time without the need of a DVD player.
B00BCGROJG,7,10,If you switch the source to antenna the favorites are available but the sound and image quality is considerably poorer.
B00BCGROJG,7,11,The BR remote is easier to use.Great picture, great wireless, and light!
B00BCGROJG,7,12,Great Picture Quality but not so great sound quality.
B00BCGROJG,7,13,It cannot be used to select a channel from the guide--I have to use my cable box remote to select channels.
B00BCGROJG,7,14,They should include a standard button remote like the blu-ray player.
B00BCGROJG,7,15,Great Picture but so many settings it takes forever to set the colors and picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,7,16,I'm still moving from one channel to another--one at a time--and have no control over size of the picture, etc.
B00BCGROJG,7,17,I would recommend using your cable box remote or a universal remote.
B00BCGROJG,7,18,Here is what i found on the lcdtvbuyingguide setting.
B00BCGROJG,7,19,Then, when I select a channel, the TV chooses the analog channel and I have to reach for the cable remote to punch in the digital one.However...I bought a Samsung 3D dvd player to go with it, and Avatar is amazing in 3D.Overall, it is close to a 5, my bride says she is never going to the movies again, much prefers the TV.And, no matter what they say, size DOES matter!
B00BCGROJG,7,20,We use the Direct TV remote for television and the Samsung for all else but the blu-ray.
B00BCGROJG,7,21,Laptop's miniDP-to-HDMI works well.
B00BCGROJG,7,22,Once you adjust the picture settings it looks amazing.
B00BCGROJG,7,23,I did not know how to getrid of that for the first movie we watched except to set to "movie" mode instead of standard.
B00BCGROJG,7,24,I purchased the Samsung DVD player to go with the TV and I love that it switched to DVD automatically as soon as I insert a DVD into the DVD slot.
B00BCGROJG,8,0,Defective screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,1,This time, I had them set up the TV on the floor and look at both screens side by side.
B00BCGROJG,8,2,When he saw the screen he said they should not be this bad and I got a bad panel.
B00BCGROJG,8,3,The first set I took home had 6 - 8 gray bard radiating up vertically from top to bottom whenever the screen was black or letter-boxed -- VERY disturbing.
B00BCGROJG,8,4,It also had this bouncing white square go across the top of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,5,But when vertical bars radiate from  the bottom on a Macbook, it means the LED screen or bar at the bottom of the screen is going bad.
B00BCGROJG,8,6,Picture is dark.
B00BCGROJG,8,7,At night, however, the edge-lit LEDs bleed into the screen from the corners and some other cloudy areas show up too.
B00BCGROJG,8,8,This means that you can see shadows, or flashlight patterns of light emanating from the corners of the TV pointing towards the center, this effect is usually only noticed in very dark movie scenes or pure black backgrounds.
B00BCGROJG,8,9,I got the 65", and Yes, it does have some leakage light on the 4 conners.
B00BCGROJG,8,10,If you watch a movie with a lot of blacks, dark scenes, you will notice a significant amount of white clouding in the blacked out areas.
B00BCGROJG,8,11,The screen is quite mirror-like but ok in our room.
B00BCGROJG,8,12,3 out of 3 screens had a dead pixel.
B00BCGROJG,8,13,After a day, noticed fluorescent green lines at the edge of face or bright objects and more noticeable at the left half of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,14,most annoying aspect is that the screen has from time to time gone dark -- not completely dark but the brightness is only about a quarter of normal.
B00BCGROJG,8,15,When on a totally black screen there is what I guess they call "clouding" near the 4 corners but mainly the left side top and bottom.
B00BCGROJG,8,16,Once we got into watching DARK movies in a DARK room, we quickly realized that "CLOUDING" and "FLASH LIGHTING" was going to be an issue.
B00BCGROJG,8,17,Even turning the back light down to zero would not eliminate the clouding.
B00BCGROJG,8,18,The last tv panel was so bad it looked like I was watching movies through cloud cover....clouds that didn't move!!
B00BCGROJG,8,19,Vertical banding was visible on the right half of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,20,The bottom right corner had a white streak of light like the corner of the panel was pinched by a screw or something.
B00BCGROJG,8,21,I don't see how anyone could watch a darkish movie like batman or harry potter at night and not be annoyed the whole time.
B00BCGROJG,8,22,But this panel up close shows what appears to be black pressure point patches on the top left, top center, and top right corner.
B00BCGROJG,8,23,Since the screen on the self diagnostic  picture is completely full of color, the problem did not appear.
B00BCGROJG,8,24,Visually dark movies can be very moving, but at times I've felt they were hiding too much.
B00BCGROJG,9,0,Last Samsung purchase.
B00BCGROJG,9,1,Do not buy Samsung!!
B00BCGROJG,9,2,TV was purchased for an 85 year old.
B00BCGROJG,9,3,Now 2 years later - same problem.
B00BCGROJG,9,4,TV was DOA at 15 months.
B00BCGROJG,9,5,I made the mistake of not starting with Samsung when the problems first stared a year ago.Random turning itself off.
B00BCGROJG,9,6,Very pleased with Purchase.
B00BCGROJG,9,7,*****W A R N I N G*****Do not buy SAMSUNG Televisions!!!
B00BCGROJG,9,8,For 58.00 more you now have a 5 year warranty.
B00BCGROJG,9,9,We vowed NEVER to get another Samsung again.
B00BCGROJG,9,10,This TV is 8 days old!!! It's still under the manufacturer's warranty obviously, but given our past 2 circumstances with Samsung, I would advise anyone: DO NOT PURCHASE A SAMSUNG TV WITHOUT AN EXTENDED WARRANTY.
B00BCGROJG,9,11,We haven't tried the 3D yet, but we didn't purchase this tv for the 3D, we bought it for the 240hz which is only available on most 3d tvs.-
B00BCGROJG,9,12,This is my second TV purchase in the past 10 years, my previous set being a 32" Samsung LCD which was mid/high end back in 2004.
B00BCGROJG,9,13,I bought and returned two Samsung UN65F7100 tvs recently from a store.
B00BCGROJG,9,14,I bought a Samsung 550 soundbar.
B00BCGROJG,9,15,I purchased one from Best Buy in early October 2013.
B00BCGROJG,9,16,I just purchased this TV (UN55F7100) over the weekend from a local store and I am very pleased.
B00BCGROJG,9,17,We've decided to get a 4 year warranty on top of the existing one year manufacturer's warranty because we have little faith in the longevity of any Samsung TV.
B00BCGROJG,9,18,Samsung TV's have serious problems.
B00BCGROJG,9,19,Buy a set for a 1000.00
B00BCGROJG,9,20,I purchased a large and expensive Samsung LED TV from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,9,21,My first 2 Vizio TV's are still working fine and one is over 5 years old.
B00BCGROJG,9,22,I am having issues with a 14 month old Samsung that cost $3000.It is a 65" LCD LED 3 D Samsung.I am in the Costco extended warranty.
B00BCGROJG,9,23,(I even wrote a review about it under Samsung PN58C500.)
B00BCGROJG,9,24,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,10,0,The louder you make the sound, the louder that dink noises becomes.
B00BCGROJG,10,1,picture is great, sound is OK (but that's why you have a home theater system).
B00BCGROJG,10,2,I am running sound through my Denon AVR E300 receiver and it is great.
B00BCGROJG,10,3,The sound is not as bad as some reviewers say, at least for me, but I will be purchasing speakers later simply because that's what they're for!
B00BCGROJG,10,4,First off, you bought a TV, not a sound system.
B00BCGROJG,10,5,We cannot wall mount it.The speakers are no doubt better on the sony which has speakers on either side of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,10,6,The apps on the TV cannot give you 5.1 sound because the output must go from your cable (or satellite) box to the home theater system, not from the digital audio out from the TV.
B00BCGROJG,10,7,Great Picture Quality but not so great sound quality.
B00BCGROJG,10,8,A small annoying thing that I still don't know if there's a fix for is that "dink" noise that the volume control makes.
B00BCGROJG,10,9,About 8 days later, my son was watching it when it suddenly turned off, made a loud buzzing sound, started smelling like burnt something, and now will no longer turn on.
B00BCGROJG,10,10,That may mean running a different line behind the walls if that is your setup.3.
B00BCGROJG,10,11,It took me awhile to get my picture quality the way I liked it.
B00BCGROJG,10,12,Great picture - quality assurance lacking though.
B00BCGROJG,10,13,But I am sure people will complain about a separate box as much as I am saying it should be separate.4.
B00BCGROJG,10,14,This then required a separate sound connection since I don't use the TV as a source for the sound.
B00BCGROJG,10,15,When the TV is powered on, it will also start the receiver.
B00BCGROJG,10,16,The picture looks good, but I suspect it will look much better after adjusting it like other folks have had to do.
B00BCGROJG,10,17,Great Picture, poor sound.
B00BCGROJG,10,18,If anyone ever tries to 'review' an audio system (whether by CNET or a 'professional') you should stop reading that section and move on to the next, its always a waste of time.
B00BCGROJG,10,19,The TV picture quality is amazing, however the sound quality is really poor.
B00BCGROJG,10,20,But if you're buying a TV at this level, you wouldn't expect anything less.
B00BCGROJG,10,21,The screws supplied would not work with the base.
B00BCGROJG,10,22,great picture, lousy gimmicks.
B00BCGROJG,10,23,It has great picture, the apps work great, and the sound is is decent (which is all you can ask for on tvs now-a-days).
B00BCGROJG,10,24,I've tried all audio settings and it doesn't get any better
B00BCGROJG,11,0,Samsung customer service wasn't very helpful in acknowledging the problem.
B00BCGROJG,11,1,I called Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,11,2,Called Samsung and we had service scheduled.
B00BCGROJG,11,3,The customer service is a joke as well.
B00BCGROJG,11,4,A pattern is emerging, so a call to Samsung, not the service center.
B00BCGROJG,11,5,Customer service was no help.
B00BCGROJG,11,6,They kept on harping that there is nothing they could do until their so called agencies confirmed that there is a problem.
B00BCGROJG,11,7,Samsung customer service is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced.
B00BCGROJG,11,8,After more than 2 hours on the call I got them to assign the ticket to a new customer service center.
B00BCGROJG,11,9,The repair firm had no record of the ticket and when I called back Samsung to find out what's up, there was no record of the repair ticket number.
B00BCGROJG,11,10,Boo Samsung, boo!
B00BCGROJG,11,11,I have had tremendous success with Samsung and Amazon's service has always been good to me.
B00BCGROJG,11,12,TV great, customer service not so much.
B00BCGROJG,11,13,They will not replace them under warranty and say they are normal.
B00BCGROJG,11,14,First service cancelled due to weather?
B00BCGROJG,11,15,A few more days go by and I receive a  voicemail from another representative requesting that I call them back.
B00BCGROJG,11,16,We were scheduled another appointment early the next week, no call, no fix, after a call we were told the wrong part was sent.
B00BCGROJG,11,17,I called Samsung to exchange them.
B00BCGROJG,11,18,Another appointment scheduled for the next week and no fix, no call, another call to the service center, Part came in broken, we will schedule you for early next week.
B00BCGROJG,11,19,Worst when I called support again to record the issue they give me a repair ticket number and a phone number to call.
B00BCGROJG,11,20,So she said she would have someone from tech support (or some such department) call me.
B00BCGROJG,11,21,I have had the TV for a week now and am still waiting on repair.
B00BCGROJG,11,22,Call Samsung and have them replace the panel or live with it.
B00BCGROJG,11,23,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,11,24,Samsung will not replace the unit but wants to send a repairman out to fix it.
B00BCGROJG,12,0,Great Picture but so many settings it takes forever to set the colors and picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,12,1,Picture settings.
B00BCGROJG,12,2,The picture quality on this TV blows them away.
B00BCGROJG,12,3,The picture quality is unbelievable.
B00BCGROJG,12,4,Thus far the picture quality on this TV is great.. no doubt about that.
B00BCGROJG,12,5,The picture was ok.
B00BCGROJG,12,6,It took me awhile to get my picture quality the way I liked it.
B00BCGROJG,12,7,The picture quality was much better though.
B00BCGROJG,12,8,The TV itself looks terrific and the picture once you get it set is amazing.
B00BCGROJG,12,9,There are many, many settings that affect brightness, many settings that affect color balance, etc... so even the last few settings will make a big difference to how the picture looks.
B00BCGROJG,12,10,Without his recommendations I would never even have found most of the picture and color settings.
B00BCGROJG,12,11,They just run the picture test mode and verify that there’s a uniformed picture.
B00BCGROJG,12,12,Picture quality is poor, and viewing angle is narrow.
B00BCGROJG,12,13,I think I need to tweek the picture on it a little more but it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,12,14,Very good picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,12,15,By far the best picture quality of any TV we've owned.
B00BCGROJG,12,16,The picture looks good, but I suspect it will look much better after adjusting it like other folks have had to do.
B00BCGROJG,12,17,Great tv but.
B00BCGROJG,12,18,But the tv picture looks great.
B00BCGROJG,12,19,Nice picture, once it is adjusted.What
B00BCGROJG,12,20,The TV is still fantastic.Update about 6 months in; we're still marveling at the picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,12,21,I have no complaints about the picture, but admittedly I'm not very picky about picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,12,22,I did not like theSmart picture thingy.
B00BCGROJG,12,23,I did not know how to getrid of that for the first movie we watched except to set to "movie" mode instead of standard.
B00BCGROJG,12,24,Great picture quality (Out the box in Movie Mode).
B00BCGROJG,13,0,Buy a set for a 1000.00
B00BCGROJG,13,1,Last Samsung I will ever buy.
B00BCGROJG,13,2,Beware before buying.
B00BCGROJG,13,3,I have a few Samsung products including this TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,4,By all means buy this TV but DO NOT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THE ALLSHARE 'SOFTWARE PRODUCT'!
B00BCGROJG,13,5,BUYING A SAMSUNG IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
B00BCGROJG,13,6,BUYING A SAMSUNG IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
B00BCGROJG,13,7,I want to thank the reviewer who provided all the setting info.
B00BCGROJG,13,8,I would definitely buy it again and recommend it, but they need a redesign on their remote.
B00BCGROJG,13,9,Others are a Galaxy tablet and an all in one computer.I gave two stars based only the product itself.One would think or hope, that Samsung's so-called support personnel were trained in their products.
B00BCGROJG,13,10,I will revise this review once I get the TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,11,But, as a consumer, I think some of the product management/marketing decisions for this product are all wrong.
B00BCGROJG,13,12,Good product - horrid support.
B00BCGROJG,13,13,DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!!
B00BCGROJG,13,14,Samsung phone/tablet division needs to take over it's TV division's software quality control.Don't buy this TV for it's smarts ... it really is NOT smart & very sluggish (slow) if you to do anything of substance on the web.Potentially a great product ... but Samsung TV division needs to fix its software quality control problems.
B00BCGROJG,13,15,So to sum it up I am very unhappy with the product itself and would not recommend a Samsung TV to anyone!
B00BCGROJG,13,16,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,13,17,I'm going to try settings that other folks have listed in these reviews and hope they know whatthey're doing.
B00BCGROJG,13,18,Samsung also needs to get it's quality control better.
B00BCGROJG,13,19,But there is a problem that Samsung customer service just confirmed exists in the software that controls the remote control.
B00BCGROJG,13,20,Samsung LED Products Suffer huge Clouding/Flashlighting Problems.
B00BCGROJG,13,21,Samsung LED Products Suffer huge Clouding/Flashlighting Problems.
B00BCGROJG,13,22,The remote, however, is dysfunctional.
B00BCGROJG,13,23,Review for Samsung UN75F7100  75" LED TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,24,Great Picture but so many settings it takes forever to set the colors and picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,14,0,wireless is not work.
B00BCGROJG,14,1,It said I should re-install the app.
B00BCGROJG,14,2,Fortunately, you can use your smartphone or tablet that has the YouTube app to “cast” the video on the TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,3,i couldn't use the Wi-fi to watch the internet TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,4,The internet apps (Netflix and Hulu) work great.
B00BCGROJG,14,5,This causes me to have to re-enter passwords and re-download apps.
B00BCGROJG,14,6,this TV wireless connection is very bad.
B00BCGROJG,14,7,Great Smart Features, they most likely have any app or service you could want.Cons:1.
B00BCGROJG,14,8,Has access to a lot of apps.4-
B00BCGROJG,14,9,Samsung 1, users 0.Ultimately, we ignored all of Samsung's smart features, browser, etc.
B00BCGROJG,14,10,I get a network error watching Netflix and Hulu, but I use the Plex app most of all.
B00BCGROJG,14,11,The Wi-Fi disconnects from time to time.3-
B00BCGROJG,14,12,The only differences are the different smart hub, and the remotes.
B00BCGROJG,14,13,bottom-line is this smart TV just like a Not-Smart-TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,14,My only complaint is about the apps.
B00BCGROJG,14,15,At the same times apps like netflix and amazon will be reset.
B00BCGROJG,14,16,very slow and
B00BCGROJG,14,17,They came down 3 times to my place and then completely lied to Samsung that they have fixed the problem when they didn't.
B00BCGROJG,14,18,The is also prove that the Samsung TV has a very slow chip.
B00BCGROJG,14,19,However, I've had issues with my apps being deleted or reset or updated Randomly apps like vudu or hbogo will be deleted.
B00BCGROJG,14,20,The remote was a little odd at first but I've gotten used to it.
B00BCGROJG,14,21,The is a smart TV. 5 star for the TV part. 1 start for "smart" part.
B00BCGROJG,14,22,Before purchasing this TV in particular I did some research regarding its “smart” features.
B00BCGROJG,14,23,I purchased the Samsung 46" 7100 w/ built in wireless (a must have for my purchase), set it up & was very pleased - wireless feature working and all.
B00BCGROJG,14,24,Netflix, Amazon, and Youtube work as expected.
B00BCGROJG,15,0,It also has Arc, so all you need is one HDMI to the TV/receiver.
B00BCGROJG,15,1,The remote control is a little funky and takes time getting used to.
B00BCGROJG,15,2,All HDMI ports don't work.
B00BCGROJG,15,3,It cannot be used to select a channel from the guide--I have to use my cable box remote to select channels.
B00BCGROJG,15,4,The remote, however, is dysfunctional.
B00BCGROJG,15,5,Instead you have to press the “more” button on the remote that will give you a virtual remote on the screen that will let you change to a specific channel.
B00BCGROJG,15,6,Only in the remote did not find the mute button, that is more important to have it.
B00BCGROJG,15,7,Plugged in power and HDMI and it worked.
B00BCGROJG,15,8,You will need to use a universal remote (making sure you disable the powering on from the remote as the TV will do this on it's own) or the receiver remote to change the receiver input back to the correct device.
B00BCGROJG,15,9,The only issue i really have is the remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,10,But tv works well overall.
B00BCGROJG,15,11,Beside the HDMI inputs, you can connect only 1 component video source OR 1 composite video source, not both at the same time.
B00BCGROJG,15,12,Here too, the remote is irritating.
B00BCGROJG,15,13,I'd rather have buttons.
B00BCGROJG,15,14,There aren't any buttons!
B00BCGROJG,15,15,REMOTE PROBLEMS NOT CLEAR ON BATTER REPLACEMET !
B00BCGROJG,15,16,The only thing I don't like is the remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,17,Great TV, Crappy remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,18,Sorry, doesn't work.
B00BCGROJG,15,19,Well, gee, that's what I thought a TV with a remote should do.
B00BCGROJG,15,20,Smart Touch remote - ok but a little limited as you may still need to use a second remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,21,The TV and the Home Theater are both Samsung, but the remotes will never control the other device.
B00BCGROJG,15,22,I am sitting there clicking the TV remote, but looking at the DVD remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,23,However, the problem is after the TV allows the receiver to power on, it will ALWAYS send a change source signal to change to the source to TV.
B00BCGROJG,15,24,I want to be able to turn it on, pick a source (cable / DVD / AmazonTV / USB / etc.) and go.
B00AOA9BL0,0,0,so far, not so good.
B00AOA9BL0,0,1,Screen looks good but stops.
B00AOA9BL0,0,2,Playback stops in the middle of a movie, not conducive to a great viewing experience.

B00AOA9BL0,1,8,good when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,1,9,When it works its good.
B00AOA9BL0,1,10,I too have the blast internet service, so that's not the issue; it's the app.It SHOULD be free with the cost of service.Please don't wait to fix until it's no longer free...how about fixing it just because it's the right thing to do?When it does work, i.e., not frozen or constantly buffering, it works well.....nice sound, picture, etc.

B00AOA9BL0,1,16,The player only works half the time.
B00AOA9BL0,1,17,I just watched half of an hour long show, and got to see the same ad about 30 times.
B00AOA9BL0,1,18,maybe it works better on an ipad or something else.
B00AOA9BL0,1,19,All the shows I want to watch are available but don't always play even when i can get them to play on the computer.
B00AOA9BL0,1,20,it is not worth your time or effort isay remove it from choices!!!
B00AOA9BL0,1,21,Sometimes it continues playing sound but has a blank screen.
B00AOA9BL0,1,22,Good day, Sir.
B00AOA9BL0,1,23,It stops working all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,1,24,I turned off the parental guard, and I typed Big Brother in the search box.

B00AOA9BL0,3,4,I have deleted and reinstalled many times but it still freezes.
B00AOA9BL0,3,5,Happens about once every 2 weeks.
B00AOA9BL0,3,6,What annoyed me is that I sent them an email asking for a code or the correct one but it was never answered.
B00AOA9BL0,3,7,I guess my big TV is too old for this product!

B00AOA9BL0,5,10,Uverse is starting to look good.
B00AOA9BL0,5,11,Good for tv shows if you have cable, terrible for movies if you only have streampix.

B00AOA9BL0,5,22,was great.
B00AOA9BL0,5,23,not good.
B00AOA9BL0,5,24,Good day, Sir.
B00AOA9BL0,6,0,It works all right if don't want to watch a show without interruptions.
B00AOA9BL0,6,1,When it works it's great.
B00AOA9BL0,6,2,It's great whwn it works.
B00AOA9BL0,6,3,needs work.
B00AOA9BL0,6,4,Work on it
B00AOA9BL0,6,5,NEEDS AN UPDATE/NEW APP.
B00AOA9BL0,6,6,I would like to see these incorporated into this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,7,NEEDS WORK.
B00AOA9BL0,6,8,Great app when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,6,9,Great when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,6,10,works when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,6,11,They will not let you watch it on your TV.
B00AOA9BL0,6,12,When it works its good.
B00AOA9BL0,6,13,good when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,6,14,Otherwise it is a good app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,15,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,6,16,When it works.
B00AOA9BL0,6,17,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,6,18,was great.
B00AOA9BL0,6,19,Fix this app to make it more stable.
B00AOA9BL0,6,20,Great...
B00AOA9BL0,6,21,Worked great for watching shows/movies and downloading them.
B00AOA9BL0,6,22,not so good.
B00AOA9BL0,6,23,not good.
B00AOA9BL0,6,24,Ad,s work good but program son,t work.
B00AOA9BL0,7,0,I like the options for the different episodes and channels - those were done ok.
B00AOA9BL0,7,1,needs a rewind button, otherwise, it's great.
B00AOA9BL0,7,2,Must have Comcast as a cable or high speed internet connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,3,If you purchase HBO, Starz, and a lot of options beyond basic cable, you will have a lot to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,7,4,Not much to watch if you only subscribe to the lower tiers of cable.
B00AOA9BL0,7,5,Disappointed that there are so very few, like a handful, of programs or movies to watch unless you have premium cable.
B00AOA9BL0,7,6,There are too many other ways to get HD onto my tablet.Gregg
B00AOA9BL0,7,7,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,7,8,you can not use your hmdi cable you can only watch it on your device.
B00AOA9BL0,7,9,3 stars for neutral rating as you must have Comcast as a cable or high speed internet connection
B00AOA9BL0,7,10,Ad,s work good but program son,t work.
B00AOA9BL0,7,11,Probably a good app but I will never know.
B00AOA9BL0,7,12,I was only able to access cable channels and not some of my other favorites, such as NBC, CBS, ABC, CW, and FOX Networks.
B00AOA9BL0,7,13,I think it should work while connected on 4 G. Well I guess this is the beggining of the real wireless video on demand.
B00AOA9BL0,7,14,All the shows I want to watch are available but don't always play even when i can get them to play on the computer.
B00AOA9BL0,7,15,I've had cable TV for years but tend to watch the same programs all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,7,16,On my iPad and iPhone I can change the channel, like a remote or record programs from outside my home.
B00AOA9BL0,7,17,Picture is great  but I cannot hear the audio  very dissappointed .
B00AOA9BL0,7,18,Good but needs more channels.
B00AOA9BL0,7,19,It works sometimes... Pros: it allows you to watch anything that you can access with your On-Demand service through Comcast on up to 3 devices.
B00AOA9BL0,7,20,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,7,21,It gets very annoying when one is trying to watch a good movie or show.
B00AOA9BL0,7,22,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,7,23,Once connected videos won't load keep getting " video cannot load please try again.
B00AOA9BL0,7,24,When it works it's great.
B00AOA9BL0,8,0,Only works part time.
B00AOA9BL0,8,1,Have to keep moving slide bar on time left in program.
B00AOA9BL0,8,2,I just watched half of an hour long show, and got to see the same ad about 30 times.
B00AOA9BL0,8,3,I like that I can watch shows on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,8,4,It also has problems with &#34;playback&#34;... all together annoying '': \
B00AOA9BL0,8,5,There is also no "back 10 seconds" button, so a few times when i tried to jump back a bit to hear some dialog I missed, I ended up on top of another commercial break.
B00AOA9BL0,8,6,Too bad.
B00AOA9BL0,8,7,Ad,s work good but program son,t work.
B00AOA9BL0,8,8,Since the transition to "TV Go", I have not been able to watch a complete episode nor movie.
B00AOA9BL0,8,9,Screen looks good but stops.
B00AOA9BL0,8,10,I've had cable TV for years but tend to watch the same programs all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,8,11,Been having a lot of issues with tv shows an  movies not playing.
B00AOA9BL0,8,12,It gets very annoying when one is trying to watch a good movie or show.
B00AOA9BL0,8,13,Takes longer to watch the show.
B00AOA9BL0,8,14,Disappointed that there are so very few, like a handful, of programs or movies to watch unless you have premium cable.
B00AOA9BL0,8,15,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,8,16,Playback stops in the middle of a movie, not conducive to a great viewing experience.
B00AOA9BL0,8,17,Great concept but... Whenever I try to watch something, the program I'm watching will freeze about halfway through the program when it is coming back from a commercial break, and nothing I do to try to get it to let me watch the rest of my program works.
B00AOA9BL0,8,18,Always have problems with stopping and digital errors.
B00AOA9BL0,8,19,On my iPad and iPhone I can change the channel, like a remote or record programs from outside my home.
B00AOA9BL0,8,20,If you purchase HBO, Starz, and a lot of options beyond basic cable, you will have a lot to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,8,21,It works all right if don't want to watch a show without interruptions.
B00AOA9BL0,8,22,All the shows I want to watch are available but don't always play even when i can get them to play on the computer.
B00AOA9BL0,8,23,It stalled a lot and then gives u an error message after buffing for a while.
B00AOA9BL0,8,24,Sometimes kicks you out, and you have to start all over again.
B00AOA9BL0,9,0,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,9,1,ok application for the price.
B00AOA9BL0,9,2,This could happen once or twice per show or sometimes so often it's not even worth the trouble.
B00AOA9BL0,9,3,If the bug gets fixed, I'll gladly change my review x
B00AOA9BL0,9,4,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,9,5,The player only works half the time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,6,Often times just plainly won't work, gives a blank screen that completely stops responding.
B00AOA9BL0,9,7,It's free is the only good thing that I didn't buy it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,8,It stops working all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,9,When watching shows it won't play at full volume even if its set with the volume all the way up.
B00AOA9BL0,9,10,If you purchase HBO, Starz, and a lot of options beyond basic cable, you will have a lot to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,9,11,My rating is based on the frequent pauses, lose of volume, and the 3min time out that last longer than specified.
B00AOA9BL0,9,12,I just watched half of an hour long show, and got to see the same ad about 30 times.
B00AOA9BL0,9,13,It's great whwn it works.
B00AOA9BL0,9,14,When it works it's great.
B00AOA9BL0,9,15,Great when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,9,16,Worth getting and would be five star if not for the volume issue.
B00AOA9BL0,9,17,I too have the blast internet service, so that's not the issue; it's the app.It SHOULD be free with the cost of service.Please don't wait to fix until it's no longer free...how about fixing it just because it's the right thing to do?When it does work, i.e., not frozen or constantly buffering, it works well.....nice sound, picture, etc.
B00AOA9BL0,9,18,maybe it works better on an ipad or something else.
B00AOA9BL0,9,19,If I had to pay for it, I would rate it a 1/5 and not purchase it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,20,Only works part time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,21,good when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,9,22,When it works its good.
B00AOA9BL0,9,23,works when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,9,24,There were lots of new shows that I would have liked to start watching, but just not enough episodes of each season to enjoy a new show.
B00AOA9BL0,10,0,Volume controls are set to low, hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,10,1,sound is a pain.
B00AOA9BL0,10,2,its okay, but sometimes hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,10,3,Try to make it work, no dice.
B00AOA9BL0,10,4,maybe it works better on an ipad or something else.
B00AOA9BL0,10,5,No Volume Control.
B00AOA9BL0,10,6,Also, there are no volume controls on the player and with the volume turned all the way up on the Kindle you can still barely hear anything.
B00AOA9BL0,10,7,Otherwise you can't hear it.
B00AOA9BL0,10,8,You need to go to settings menu and monkey around and then it will work.
B00AOA9BL0,10,9,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,10,10,It works quite well if you are willing to wear earphones all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,10,11,Picture is great  but I cannot hear the audio  very dissappointed .
B00AOA9BL0,10,12,Overrides my kindle' s volume controls.
B00AOA9BL0,10,13,could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,10,14,It's okay but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,10,15,Also the volume control on this app is quite low and have to have headphones on in order to hear it clearly.
B00AOA9BL0,10,16,When watching shows it won't play at full volume even if its set with the volume all the way up.
B00AOA9BL0,10,17,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,10,18,Sometimes it continues playing sound but has a blank screen.
B00AOA9BL0,10,19,I find that it's an overall ok app but definitely lacking in some regards.
B00AOA9BL0,10,20,I find live TV needs to be included, along with more episode options on certain shows.
B00AOA9BL0,10,21,All the shows I want to watch are available but don't always play even when i can get them to play on the computer.
B00AOA9BL0,10,22,Often times just plainly won't work, gives a blank screen that completely stops responding.
B00AOA9BL0,10,23,i'd eventually get it on by clicking the back arrow and then restarting again.
B00AOA9BL0,10,24,Good for tv shows if you have cable, terrible for movies if you only have streampix.
B00AOA9BL0,11,0,Who do I call ?
B00AOA9BL0,11,1,Terrible customer service
B00AOA9BL0,11,2,Good day, Sir.
B00AOA9BL0,11,3,I am hoping that with new releases/updates that some of these issues will be resolved.
B00AOA9BL0,11,4,Often times just plainly won't work, gives a blank screen that completely stops responding.
B00AOA9BL0,11,5,I turned off the parental guard, and I typed Big Brother in the search box.
B00AOA9BL0,11,6,App was doing great until last update.
B00AOA9BL0,11,7,My only issue with is that none of the major networks are available such as CBS, NBC, FOX, etc.
B00AOA9BL0,11,8,I find live TV needs to be included, along with more episode options on certain shows.
B00AOA9BL0,11,9,This is my only issue and if these networks get added then this will be a 5-star app in my book
B00AOA9BL0,11,10,It stops working all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,11,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,11,12,Clearly they are not interested in keeping their on-the-go customers.
B00AOA9BL0,11,13,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,11,14,The kicker is that once it starts this, it keeps doing it until you power off the device, wait 10 seconds or so, and then power it back on.
B00AOA9BL0,11,15,The player only works half the time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,16,I just watched half of an hour long show, and got to see the same ad about 30 times.
B00AOA9BL0,11,17,I too have the blast internet service, so that's not the issue; it's the app.It SHOULD be free with the cost of service.Please don't wait to fix until it's no longer free...how about fixing it just because it's the right thing to do?When it does work, i.e., not frozen or constantly buffering, it works well.....nice sound, picture, etc.
B00AOA9BL0,11,18,Only works part time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,19,Makes it rather useless for keeping up with new shows when you can only see half of the season and not in a logical order.Considering this app is part of a PAID cable subscription, I'm EXTREMELY disappointed.
B00AOA9BL0,11,20,The app is great when it works, I am connected online yet it tells me to connect.
B00AOA9BL0,11,21,sucks since they updated it.
B00AOA9BL0,11,22,It's free is the only good thing that I didn't buy it.
B00AOA9BL0,11,23,It works quite well if you are willing to wear earphones all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,24,I find that it's an overall ok app but definitely lacking in some regards.
B00AOA9BL0,12,0,only good if you have starz and showtime.
B00AOA9BL0,12,1,Otherwise I'm good with it.
B00AOA9BL0,12,2,Screen looks good but stops.
B00AOA9BL0,12,3,Good for tv shows if you have cable, terrible for movies if you only have streampix.
B00AOA9BL0,12,4,not to good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,5,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,6,nice, but....
B00AOA9BL0,12,7,It gets very annoying when one is trying to watch a good movie or show.
B00AOA9BL0,12,8,Other wise it's a great app especially if you have premium channels like I do.
B00AOA9BL0,12,9,VERY BAD.
B00AOA9BL0,12,10,Ad,s work good but program son,t work.
B00AOA9BL0,12,11,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,12,12,Could be better!
B00AOA9BL0,12,13,When the app does work the picture is crisp and it is a good experience.
B00AOA9BL0,12,14,Been having a lot of issues with tv shows an  movies not playing.
B00AOA9BL0,12,15,You need to go to settings menu and monkey around and then it will work.
B00AOA9BL0,12,16,If you purchase HBO, Starz, and a lot of options beyond basic cable, you will have a lot to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,12,17,You can not sort bookmarked movies from TV shows, nor can you sort your favorites in any manner whatsoever.There is no manner to watch either live TV (save a few news and sports programs) or watch purchased on demand material.TV shows seemed to be limited to 1, maybe 2 seasons.The depth of the available offerings that you can watch with this approach is limited to the cable TV subscription you purchase.
B00AOA9BL0,12,18,Good day, Sir.
B00AOA9BL0,12,19,I've had cable TV for years but tend to watch the same programs all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,12,20,Disappointed that there are so very few, like a handful, of programs or movies to watch unless you have premium cable.
B00AOA9BL0,12,21,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,12,22,It also has problems with &#34;playback&#34;... all together annoying '': \
B00AOA9BL0,12,23,Now IMHO the way the Featured page is set up makes it almost useless.
B00AOA9BL0,12,24,good when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,13,0,big waste.
B00AOA9BL0,13,1,it is not worth your time or effort isay remove it from choices!!!
B00AOA9BL0,13,2,Often times just plainly won't work, gives a blank screen that completely stops responding.
B00AOA9BL0,13,3,This is really pretty limited unless you want to spend a lot of money on premium channels.
B00AOA9BL0,13,4,My rating is based on the frequent pauses, lose of volume, and the 3min time out that last longer than specified.
B00AOA9BL0,13,5,Hope will get better.
B00AOA9BL0,13,6,Unreliable performance.
B00AOA9BL0,13,7,One major flaw.
B00AOA9BL0,13,8,Seems to function pretty well, just not exactly what I was hoping for.
B00AOA9BL0,13,9,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,13,10,50 percent of the time on my phone it completely locks up and I have to remove the battery.
B00AOA9BL0,13,11,not reliable.
B00AOA9BL0,13,12,I hope they fix this!!
B00AOA9BL0,13,13,Also I expected to be able to get all available shows that are available with my television service contract, but some channels, and programming are not available.
B00AOA9BL0,13,14,Ad,s work good but program son,t work.
B00AOA9BL0,13,15,Hope it gets fixed soon.
B00AOA9BL0,13,16,Stay tuned (pun intended).
B00AOA9BL0,13,17,Playback is very choppy and they lose connection all the time!
B00AOA9BL0,13,18,playback is not great.
B00AOA9BL0,13,19,It's possible that I was doing something wrong but I gave up and uninstalled it.
B00AOA9BL0,13,20,Worth getting and would be five star if not for the volume issue.
B00AOA9BL0,13,21,All in all, I guess if it is all you have, it would be better than nothing, but still leaves a lot to me desired.
B00AOA9BL0,13,22,You need to go to settings menu and monkey around and then it will work.
B00AOA9BL0,13,23,I thought I would be able to see some of my science channels and couldn't, it was limited to only a few.
B00AOA9BL0,13,24,If you purchase HBO, Starz, and a lot of options beyond basic cable, you will have a lot to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,14,0,Don't like the shortage of apps available.
B00AOA9BL0,14,1,This was one of my favorite apps...until the last update.
B00AOA9BL0,14,2,Hbo has its own app.
B00AOA9BL0,14,3,I haven't used this app much.
B00AOA9BL0,14,4,It stops working.
B00AOA9BL0,14,5,Okay--when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,14,6,It stops working all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,7,App was doing great until last update.
B00AOA9BL0,14,8,Worked great...before latest update.
B00AOA9BL0,14,9,This issue I have with said content is its crippling effect on the app thus far.
B00AOA9BL0,14,10,The above not withstanding, this app should mature just fine.
B00AOA9BL0,14,11,When I first got this app, it was great.
B00AOA9BL0,14,12,The app needs work so that programs are available to watch more consistently.
B00AOA9BL0,14,13,I'm sure it's a great app if I can figure it out!
B00AOA9BL0,14,14,I like this app but don't love it.
B00AOA9BL0,14,15,Constantly having to reboot app.
B00AOA9BL0,14,16,I downloaded this app because I wanted to watch the latest episode of Big Brother.
B00AOA9BL0,14,17,Never have this problem with Netflix app on the same device with the same Wi-Fi connection.
B00AOA9BL0,14,18,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,19,The first day I downloaded the app to my Kindle it worked great and I watched a TV show for the first time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,20,You can watch tv and movies which isn't at all what I wanted.
B00AOA9BL0,14,21,Update is no good :/ I loved this app prior to the most recent update.
B00AOA9BL0,14,22,The app is great when it works, I am connected online yet it tells me to connect.
B00AOA9BL0,14,23,I like that I can watch shows on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,14,24,Since the transition to "TV Go", I have not been able to watch a complete episode nor movie.
B00AOA9BL0,15,0,It works quite well if you are willing to wear earphones all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,15,1,This really isn't your cable subscription on your tablet.
B00AOA9BL0,15,2,On my iPad and iPhone I can change the channel, like a remote or record programs from outside my home.
B00AOA9BL0,15,3,Won't change the channel.
B00AOA9BL0,15,4,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,15,5,Can only see some of the channels.
B00AOA9BL0,15,6,The kicker is that once it starts this, it keeps doing it until you power off the device, wait 10 seconds or so, and then power it back on.
B00AOA9BL0,15,7,Try to make it work, no dice.
B00AOA9BL0,15,8,I thought I would be able to see some of my science channels and couldn't, it was limited to only a few.
B00AOA9BL0,15,9,Recent changes make this a BIG thumbs DOWN.
B00AOA9BL0,15,10,I don't know if it is my Comcast connection of the devise.
B00AOA9BL0,15,11,No Volume Control.
B00AOA9BL0,15,12,its ok on the kindle fire but locks the hdmi output so you cant connect to the TV.
B00AOA9BL0,15,13,Always have problems with stopping and digital errors.
B00AOA9BL0,15,14,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,15,15,its ok on the kindle fire but locks the hdmi output so you cant connect to the TV.Major limitation and offensive when I pay so much to Comcast every month.
B00AOA9BL0,15,16,Their contracting must have changed recently with several networks as shows that formerly had full past seasons and full current seasons are now reduced to the past 3 every other episodes.Yes, you read that correctly.
B00AOA9BL0,15,17,It stops working all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,15,18,I've had cable TV for years but tend to watch the same programs all the time.
B00AOA9BL0,15,19,I would get no more than 2 seconds of play before it would stop.
B00AOA9BL0,15,20,Too may featued channels required.
B00AOA9BL0,15,21,Often times just plainly won't work, gives a blank screen that completely stops responding.
B00AOA9BL0,15,22,Reasonable selection although some of my tv favorites are missing.
B00AOA9BL0,15,23,Too bad.
B00AOA9BL0,15,24,Ad,s work good but program son,t work.
