B0074FGLUM,0,0,We've had to change the lighting in our room when viewing.
B0074FGLUM,0,1,Light in image goes dark and light sometimes.
B0074FGLUM,0,2,Good, but not great.
B0074FGLUM,0,3,The Dreaded LED Viewing Angle Bugaboo!
B0074FGLUM,0,4,Great picture, REALLY BAD GLARE.
B0074FGLUM,0,5,The screen is semi-glossy, which I dislike greatly because I can see reflections of myself or the room in darker scenes.
B0074FGLUM,0,6,The off axis viewing angle is not so good.
B0074FGLUM,0,7,4. The best picture size setting is screen fit.
B0074FGLUM,0,8,While watching TV, it can get dark for no reason.
B0074FGLUM,0,9,The lights are directly behind the screen (i.e.
B0074FGLUM,0,10,If you watch from the sides of from above, the colors seem to be a bit over-saturated.
B0074FGLUM,0,11,And I have other flat screen TV's that have GORGEOUS coloring and sharp pictures in my home, so I know what watching a TV should look like... even though you are doing your best to make me feel like an idiot).
B0074FGLUM,0,12,Good.
B0074FGLUM,0,13,I sit 9 feet from the screen.
B0074FGLUM,0,14,The lighting is mostly even, but there is noticeably dimming in the corners of the set.
B0074FGLUM,0,15,I've made DOZENS of setting adjustments and spoken with Samsung six times.
B0074FGLUM,0,16,I don't see how people can think the picture quality is good, let alone great.
B0074FGLUM,0,17,Despite light coming from the side, it doesn't effect the picture quality or anything.
B0074FGLUM,0,18,It's way too reflective and glaring, as well as hard to see from an angle.
B0074FGLUM,0,19,So, I did just that and the picture was even better.
B0074FGLUM,0,20,Since I loved the first Samsung, I decided to but a Samsung once again.My old Samsung was a LCD from the 6 series, 2010 model (which I unfortunately could not bring over while I moved).This TV is a LED from the 5 series.
B0074FGLUM,0,21,Samsung Model UN40EH5300F 40" Led TV.
B0074FGLUM,0,22,It's light, easy to attach the base to the stand (just 8 small screws!), and the picture quality is good.Cons: The stand does not rotate or pivot.
B0074FGLUM,0,23,Nope, I don't like it at all, and really don't have much good to say about this TV!
B0074FGLUM,0,24,Other than that it's nice, sleek, shiny frame and good stand.
B0074FGLUM,1,0,Samsung UN32EH5300 32-Inch.
B0074FGLUM,1,1,Good TV for its price.
B0074FGLUM,1,2,Great Picture, Smart TV isn't that great.
B0074FGLUM,1,3,It's a good TV, but the picture quality is not a good as my other Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,1,4,Picture quality is very good.
B0074FGLUM,1,5,SAMSUNG makes a great tv otherwise.
B0074FGLUM,1,6,The Sony TV is great I love it.
B0074FGLUM,1,7,I had previously owned two Samsung lcd TV's and was very happy with them - great picture.
B0074FGLUM,1,8,The picture is great.
B0074FGLUM,1,9,It's not a very good tv.
B0074FGLUM,1,10,Price Good, TV Not so SMART.
B0074FGLUM,1,11,It is a good value as a television.
B0074FGLUM,1,12,I bought this television because of the brand and the price.

B0074FGLUM,1,17,Bargain Samsung HDTV not such a great buy.
B0074FGLUM,1,18,Samsung LED TV review - UN40EH5300 40 inch.
B0074FGLUM,1,19,It was and is great.

B0074FGLUM,1,21,great functionality and quality for the price . . .
B0074FGLUM,1,22,So I thought this Samsung Smart tv would be a great buy.
B0074FGLUM,1,23,Samsung 32 Inch 1080p Smart LED HDTV.
B0074FGLUM,1,24,NOt the BEST TV I've every bought, but decent for the price.
B0074FGLUM,2,0,Sound quality.
B0074FGLUM,2,1,Good quality picture and sound.
B0074FGLUM,2,2,great picture and sound.
B0074FGLUM,2,3,Great picture.

B0074FGLUM,2,6,Great picture, great sound, great value.
B0074FGLUM,2,7,Great picture.
B0074FGLUM,2,8,Sound quality is poor.
B0074FGLUM,2,9,As a TV it works well and sounds good.
B0074FGLUM,2,10,Great sound quality3.)
B0074FGLUM,2,11,The picture quality is great and sound is better than I expected.However
B0074FGLUM,2,12,Great picture, terrible sound quality.
B0074FGLUM,2,13,I am now running sound through my home theatre system and sound is greatly improved.
B0074FGLUM,2,14,Picture and sound quality are reasonable but not great.
B0074FGLUM,2,15,Neither picture or sound quality are outstanding.
B0074FGLUM,2,16,WiFi is Great, Picture is Great, Sound is Horrible.......
B0074FGLUM,2,17,Sound is an issue.
B0074FGLUM,2,18,The TV itself is just what I expected in regards to the picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,2,19,Need to add a sound bar if you like fuller sound.
B0074FGLUM,2,20,Sound - Pretty good for the price.
B0074FGLUM,2,21,The sound is very low, but I bought a philips sound bar... cheap but good.
B0074FGLUM,2,22,Other than the complaints, it's just an  average consumer-grade TV. the picture isn't particularly great, the sound isn't particularly great, the remote isn't particularly great, or anything like that.
B0074FGLUM,2,23,It's a good TV with some issues.
B0074FGLUM,2,24,Picture and sound are fine, but the actual usage of this is a horrible experience.
B0074FGLUM,3,0,I can't tell if the tv is great or not.
B0074FGLUM,3,1,Arrived Smashed.
B0074FGLUM,3,2,If I would have known what peripherals that didn't work with this TV,  I never would have purchased it.

B0074FGLUM,3,7,Product arrived damaged.
B0074FGLUM,3,8,But I'm an Amazon junky and can't stand the service at Best Buy.
B0074FGLUM,3,9,I used to love Samsung and their customer service, until my last purchase.
B0074FGLUM,3,10,I had no problem returning it to Amazon, and I got another Samsung (more expensive) smart TV from Amazon.
B0074FGLUM,3,11,CONTACTING SHIPPER AND AMAZON.
B0074FGLUM,3,12,before I ordered and received the goods at the time and was pleased.
B0074FGLUM,3,13,Poor customer service.
B0074FGLUM,3,14,I replaced with a new Lg that works great.
B0074FGLUM,3,15,This Item was not available for free pick up service or return shipping.
B0074FGLUM,3,16,Then we have to order a new one because they won't ship a replacement.
B0074FGLUM,3,17,and I WANTED this TV (and usually love Amazon).
B0074FGLUM,3,18,Amazon was notified as soon as my Granddaughter opened it and tried to get it working .

B0074FGLUM,4,12,Great picture, great sound, great value.
B0074FGLUM,4,13,TV has a great picture, sounds great, and looks great but....................The TV when in Smart TV mode seems very sluggish when going through the apps.
B0074FGLUM,4,14,TV picture quality was pretty good.
B0074FGLUM,4,15,This TV was easy to set up and has great picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,4,16,Picture quality is clear and I used other's settings mentioned on here for the picture adjustments.
B0074FGLUM,4,17,Great picture, sound quality is lacking.
B0074FGLUM,4,18,Great picture2.)
B0074FGLUM,4,19,Great sound quality3.)
B0074FGLUM,4,20,Not as good.
B0074FGLUM,4,21,The quality is amazing on this.
B0074FGLUM,4,22,The TV is great for a low-priced smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,4,23,I love the quality of the color and the clarity.
B0074FGLUM,4,24,great functionality and quality for the price . . .
B0074FGLUM,5,0,Not great, but good
B0074FGLUM,5,1,It's a good TV, but the picture quality is not a good as my other Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,5,2,I strongly recommend the 5500 !
B0074FGLUM,5,3,DO NOT BUY.
B0074FGLUM,5,4,good TV for the money.
B0074FGLUM,5,5,If I had it to do over again I would buy  LG.
B0074FGLUM,5,6,Not as good.
B0074FGLUM,5,7,I can't tell if the tv is great or not.
B0074FGLUM,5,8,It was and is great.
B0074FGLUM,5,9,Pictures great, but product is not as advertised.
B0074FGLUM,5,10,I don't see how people can think the picture quality is good, let alone great.
B0074FGLUM,5,11,The TV is great for a low-priced smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,5,12,The picture quality is great, but TV cannot do what is advertised.
B0074FGLUM,5,13,Great TV, but not so 'Smart'.
B0074FGLUM,5,14,For the price and reviews I got a little trigger happy and bought two of these at one time.
B0074FGLUM,5,15,Sorry Samsung...love your products, but this one is a miss.
B0074FGLUM,5,16,Will never buy from Samsung again.
B0074FGLUM,5,17,So I thought this Samsung Smart tv would be a great buy.
B0074FGLUM,5,18,Samsung Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,5,19,Ok for The money.
B0074FGLUM,5,20,Save your money, buy the non-"smart" version.
B0074FGLUM,5,21,I am disappointed in the product.
B0074FGLUM,5,22,The TV is great, the picture and sound quality are exceptional.
B0074FGLUM,5,23,However, I would still rate the product as inferior.
B0074FGLUM,5,24,Great product.
B0074FGLUM,6,0,Please fix the apps!
B0074FGLUM,6,1,Now, however, nothing seems to work.
B0074FGLUM,6,2,Stopped working.
B0074FGLUM,6,3,The WI-FI also works great.
B0074FGLUM,6,4,There are no apps for my favorite channels (or at least, I haven't found them yet - they are not well organized).
B0074FGLUM,6,5,Great picture2.)
B0074FGLUM,6,6,Great picture, the apps are slow.
B0074FGLUM,6,7,This became an issue when I wanted to watch the same show that another user was watching.
B0074FGLUM,6,8,I love having a smart TV, were able to have some of our favorite apps right on the tv but I feel they should have more apps available.I would love to see show time not just the preview of it but the full app.
B0074FGLUM,6,9,I know this isn't an issue with my internet connection, rather the apps on the TV themselves.3.)
B0074FGLUM,6,10,Nice TV - Good Picture - Nice Features - SLOW Apps.
B0074FGLUM,6,11,It's not a very good tv.
B0074FGLUM,6,12,When trying to watch anything on a app it runs super slow.
B0074FGLUM,6,13,A lot of the apps don't function well.
B0074FGLUM,6,14,Great...when it works.
B0074FGLUM,6,15,The app on the TV does not differentiate between users on the same Netflix account.
B0074FGLUM,6,16,LG has better apps.
B0074FGLUM,6,17,Don't crank the volume up too much when you watch a Metallica concert though.
B0074FGLUM,6,18,The apps load slowly when you try to open them.
B0074FGLUM,6,19,Netflix app works by the way.
B0074FGLUM,6,20,Internet funcrions are slow but work well.
B0074FGLUM,6,21,Great features but didnt work long.
B0074FGLUM,6,22,It has nice image and good apps selection.
B0074FGLUM,6,23,Easy to install and the apps works all right even though the load a bit slow now and then.
B0074FGLUM,6,24,My internet connection is very good so it is not the connection it's the tv
B0074FGLUM,7,0,Great picture.
B0074FGLUM,7,1,The HDMI connection with only work with Samsung DVD players, Samsung computers, etc. and will not work for devices using the HDMI cable everyone else in the industry uses.
B0074FGLUM,7,2,My internet connection is very good so it is not the connection it's the tv
B0074FGLUM,7,3,I like the picture quality and the remote features, but after setting it up and connecting it to our antenna the reception has been poor, especially on local channels.
B0074FGLUM,7,4,Instead one can go for a HD tv and all these can be streamed fron DVD players or any other game devices.
B0074FGLUM,7,5,TV Did not connect to my wireless.
B0074FGLUM,7,6,The setup was easy but the TV could not connect to internet with a direct or a WiFi connection.
B0074FGLUM,7,7,It had perfect synergy with our Samsung Blu-Ray player where all the settings we automatically set and the picture was perfect when watching Blu-Rays.
B0074FGLUM,7,8,TV picture quality was pretty good.
B0074FGLUM,7,9,When we first set this TV up, it worked fine.
B0074FGLUM,7,10,The picture quality is just okay, not great, even though many settings are offered to adjust the picture and the sound.
B0074FGLUM,7,11,Need to find out how to get non HD channels to show full screen picture.
B0074FGLUM,7,12,The connectivity to this TV is quite poor.
B0074FGLUM,7,13,My $60 blu-ray player I have in another room works far better than the TV does.
B0074FGLUM,7,14,Or, I got a signal booster to make it work.
B0074FGLUM,7,15,Oh well I hooked up a cheap Sony Blu-ray player and everything works great.
B0074FGLUM,7,16,The WI-FI also works great.
B0074FGLUM,7,17,However, Picture quality very good and has a great set of features...IT DOES NOT SUPPORT .MOV VIDEO FORMATS!!!
B0074FGLUM,7,18,Great picture, great sound, great value.
B0074FGLUM,7,19,It's the same cable that I had working with my SONY just seconds before, but Samsung says I need to buy a Samsung cable....  Also on the positive side, if you can call it that, the remote control is better than many I have used.
B0074FGLUM,7,20,My sources have been apple tv, dvd, and digital cable (without converter).
B0074FGLUM,7,21,a good resolution when I plugged the BluRay to it though.
B0074FGLUM,7,22,TV good even in dented box.
B0074FGLUM,7,23,I am not an audiophile at all, but I can't find an audio setting I like for watching regular TV or movies.
B0074FGLUM,7,24,This TV however has missed out on 16 Pin S-video input.
B0074FGLUM,8,0,Smashed screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,1,I looked at it, and noticed that the screen had been shattered at the top and had spread across half the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,2,The tv screen is already showing issues.
B0074FGLUM,8,3,Now there is a 1/4 diameter black circle on the bottom edge of the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,4,The screen was black and red, with white spiderweb-like lines all over the plasma screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,5,Sometimes the screen goes completely black.
B0074FGLUM,8,6,went black on the 29th day.
B0074FGLUM,8,7,Damaged Screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,8,The TV screen is totally shattered!!!!!
B0074FGLUM,8,9,A large circular space of the screen (top left) and corner of the screen (top right) was totally WHITE.
B0074FGLUM,8,10,screen dead after one week.
B0074FGLUM,8,11,Also the screen has a 3 inch blotch at the bottom that is visible when viewing dark scenes.
B0074FGLUM,8,12,tv came with the broken screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,13,But a few days later, it just wouldn't quit power recyling itself -- screen goes blank, power light goes off, then it tries to power on again, you see the splash screen but never get a picture, shuts off and tries to power on again with no success.
B0074FGLUM,8,14,3 months later I have dead pixels and dark lines across the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,15,Dead pixel.
B0074FGLUM,8,16,The picture on the tv was choppy and had lines going down as if lights were broken or something.
B0074FGLUM,8,17,I purchased this TV in September of 2013 and last week the screen went black.
B0074FGLUM,8,18,I thought it was the tv protector so I left it up and I notice the screen Is just popped out from the Tv.
B0074FGLUM,8,19,the colors are very poor especially when viewed from one side not front.download
B0074FGLUM,8,20,Brightness problems.
B0074FGLUM,8,21,TV was damaged with a broken screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,22,had to return it because dead pictel in center of screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,23,When it works, its great, When the screen is black and wont power up it sucks.
B0074FGLUM,8,24,It's almost imperceptible with a light background, but when the background is dark, it becomes annoyingly prominent.
B0074FGLUM,9,0,I only used it for 5 months.
B0074FGLUM,9,1,After 6 months of use Samsung UN40EH5300 stopped working!!
B0074FGLUM,9,2,I will be returning this and never buying a samsung tv again.
B0074FGLUM,9,3,But we will think twice before buying anything from amazon.
B0074FGLUM,9,4,Will never buy a TV from Amazon.
B0074FGLUM,9,5,Only works until right after warranty is out... 1 year, 2 months.
B0074FGLUM,9,6,I purchased this TV and used it for about a month before returning it.
B0074FGLUM,9,7,Never again - I will never buy another Samsung product again.
B0074FGLUM,9,8,I will go with the latter, and will never buy a Samsung product again.
B0074FGLUM,9,9,Purchased this product August, 2012.
B0074FGLUM,9,10,gave out after 1.5 years!
B0074FGLUM,9,11,I bought this TV last year.
B0074FGLUM,9,12,I had purchased Samsung UN40EH5300 smart TV almost a month ago.
B0074FGLUM,9,13,Didnt expect the product to breakdown within 1 month of purchase.
B0074FGLUM,9,14,BUy something else.
B0074FGLUM,9,15,Please do not buy this TV if you are looking to buy a smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,9,16,I purchased this TV just a year and a few months ago and the power is out.
B0074FGLUM,9,17,Should have gone with my first instinct and purchased a Panasonic which I will know do.
B0074FGLUM,9,18,I am going to ask Samsung for money back.
B0074FGLUM,9,19,Samsung was really nasty to me about it saying it is out of warranty.
B0074FGLUM,9,20,Do not Purchase this television.
B0074FGLUM,9,21,Used it for 2 months and wish I could get my money back.
B0074FGLUM,9,22,I've asked to have Samsung replace this TV with a working model.
B0074FGLUM,9,23,I bought this TV from Amazon without seeing it in the store.
B0074FGLUM,9,24,I haven't even owned the TV for 6 months.
B0074FGLUM,10,0,The sound on this TV was unbearable!
B0074FGLUM,10,1,Cannot control external speaker volume.
B0074FGLUM,10,2,The sound is so horrible I am contemplating getting a sound bar.
B0074FGLUM,10,3,Problems with Speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,4,The problem is that the volume control of the TV does not control the output of the external speaker.
B0074FGLUM,10,5,You have to turn the sound up super-high to hear voices.
B0074FGLUM,10,6,The TV has an external speaker connection.
B0074FGLUM,10,7,Audio problems.
B0074FGLUM,10,8,I tried all the sound menu settings, but never got it to work the way I needed it to.
B0074FGLUM,10,9,The only problem is the speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,10,The only way to use a headphone is the Audio out jack on the back of the TV.
B0074FGLUM,10,11,It is not reinforced along the backbone with bends to keep it from being susceptible to vibrations from the *speaker ports* and wall mounts caused by the lower mounted speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,12,So I have no way of muting my external speakers as they are just speakers, they are not a audio receiver unit with a separate remote control.
B0074FGLUM,10,13,The sound system on this TV is horrible!
B0074FGLUM,10,14,The volume variation is one issue.
B0074FGLUM,10,15,Granted, I could get a sound bar, but shouldn't have to.[b]non
B0074FGLUM,10,16,But we have had a problem with the sound on both monitors.
B0074FGLUM,10,17,It is hard to plug in, especially if you have the TV wall mounted.
B0074FGLUM,10,18,The image quality is still fine though :-) and I can get audio through external speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,19,This TV does not have a headphone jack on the television.Major deficiency.
B0074FGLUM,10,20,Horrible Sound.
B0074FGLUM,10,21,It made a clicking sound when the power button was depressed, but no image or sound.
B0074FGLUM,10,22,Sometimes, I can route the sound to an outside speaker (via my receiver) and sometimes it decides that no all sound must go through the TV,.
B0074FGLUM,10,23,I have to buy my own speakers to connect them to the TV to hear it clear.
B0074FGLUM,10,24,The speakers on this tv aren't good at all.
B0074FGLUM,11,0,Samsung Customer Service.
B0074FGLUM,11,1,Samsung customer service is anything but service.
B0074FGLUM,11,2,KNOWN PROBLEM! (BUT) Samsung fixed it!
B0074FGLUM,11,3,Samsung "Customer Service" is no help, so you are on your own.
B0074FGLUM,11,4,Nothing happened so I called again.
B0074FGLUM,11,5,I called Samsung and they outsource their tech support to somewhere in China.
B0074FGLUM,11,6,Samsung was really nasty to me about it saying it is out of warranty.
B0074FGLUM,11,7,I called Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,11,8,So I called Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,11,9,update: Called Samsung service.
B0074FGLUM,11,10,Very poor customer support lines.
B0074FGLUM,11,11,I waited patiently for 4 days and no calls from them.
B0074FGLUM,11,12,Samsung customer service could not resolve this.
B0074FGLUM,11,13,I went through a month of calls to Samsung, called Netflix, called my ISP.
B0074FGLUM,11,14,Well 4 days later I called Samsung customer service and was informed 32 inch t.v.'s must be shipped to be serviced.
B0074FGLUM,11,15,When I called to have THAT replaced, I was told I had to wait another 2 weeks.
B0074FGLUM,11,16,I researched and saw that Samsung was the bomb.com
B0074FGLUM,11,17,What has happened to SAMSUNG?
B0074FGLUM,11,18,They're probably grumpy because they're fielding so many calls on this very issue.
B0074FGLUM,11,19,I know the TV needed a hardware fix and Samsung should've sent someone out to service it, but I could not get any help from their Customer Service.
B0074FGLUM,11,20,I've called support many times.
B0074FGLUM,11,21,Now i have to wait another week for someone to come out and service it.
B0074FGLUM,11,22,I have used many other samsung TVs in my rental cottages ( over 10) and have never had any problems with samsung
B0074FGLUM,11,23,The remote was DOA on arrival and call after call to Samsung have got me nowhere.
B0074FGLUM,11,24,Had a couple of problems with this TV and called Samsung for help.
B0074FGLUM,12,0,PICTURE QUALITY.

B0074FGLUM,12,9,Changed the picture settings (following the settings another reviewer suggested) and liked the picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,12,10,For a TV I always praise Samsung for the picture quality and this is the same!
B0074FGLUM,12,11,Picture quality is good though.
B0074FGLUM,12,12,It's great but...
B0074FGLUM,12,13,This TV was easy to set up and has great picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,12,14,My previous Samsung 46" 640 has a much better picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,12,15,Great picture, great sound, great value.
B0074FGLUM,12,16,The Picture Quality is below my expectation.
B0074FGLUM,12,17,great picture and tv works well
B0074FGLUM,12,18,Picture dims.
B0074FGLUM,12,19,I don't see how people can think the picture quality is good, let alone great.
B0074FGLUM,12,20,Picture and everything is great.
B0074FGLUM,12,21,the tv is a tv... good picture and decent sound.
B0074FGLUM,12,22,Picture quality is excellent.
B0074FGLUM,12,23,The TV is fine - good picture, etc.
B0074FGLUM,12,24,not a great image.
B0074FGLUM,13,0,I will never buy anothey Samsung product and AMAZON  should have a disclaimer with tis information before anyone buys a Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,13,1,Don't buy any Samsung TV's.

B0074FGLUM,13,9,If I could do it over again, I'D BUY ANY TV BUT A SAMSUNG SMART TV!
B0074FGLUM,13,10,Don't buy.
B0074FGLUM,13,11,I read many other reviews with the same issue.
B0074FGLUM,13,12,Google: Samsung has poor Quality Control before buying!
B0074FGLUM,13,13,Not recommended to purchase this immature product.
B0074FGLUM,13,14,Review of this TV.

B0074FGLUM,13,16,Do not buy.
B0074FGLUM,13,17,Dont Buy this Smart Tv!!!!
B0074FGLUM,13,18,Don't take on this problem.
B0074FGLUM,13,19,My Samsung TV quit working just after 1 year.
B0074FGLUM,13,20,review.
B0074FGLUM,13,21,Review for Samsung UN32EH5300 smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,13,22,Update to previous review.
B0074FGLUM,13,23,Based on what I've seen, Samsung KNOWS about this problem, and hasn't fixed it in years.Sigh.
B0074FGLUM,13,24,First time I've said that about a Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,14,0,smart tv???
B0074FGLUM,14,1,not very smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,2,not so smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,3,Not smart at all.
B0074FGLUM,14,4,not Smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,5,samsung smart tv not so smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,6,Samsung Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,7,Netflix app works by the way.
B0074FGLUM,14,8,For trying to be a smart TV, it's only 3-stars "smart."
B0074FGLUM,14,9,I've tried using the Smart apps and what not.
B0074FGLUM,14,10,SMART TV is not really SMART.
B0074FGLUM,14,11,It is not smart enough yet.
B0074FGLUM,14,12,Smart TV isn't so smart anymore.
B0074FGLUM,14,13,We can not say it is a smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,14,Dont get a samsung tv !!!
B0074FGLUM,14,15,It's much smarter than the samsung smart tv.
B0074FGLUM,14,16,Smart seems to be a misnomer.
B0074FGLUM,14,17,Smart?
B0074FGLUM,14,18,I am only using the Netflix app with this TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,19,It is not smart at all.
B0074FGLUM,14,20,samsung not so smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,21,Can this not be fixed by Samsung?
B0074FGLUM,14,22,not really a smart tv.
B0074FGLUM,14,23,There is no youtube app available anymore from samsung for this tv.
B0074FGLUM,14,24,Netflix doesn't work TVP-805.
B0074FGLUM,15,0,Remote is still old traditional remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,1,The TV comes with a "remote controller or wand".
B0074FGLUM,15,2,This means another remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,3,My Cable box also has such a remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,4,I can't believe that this TV doesn't come with a universal remote to control the cable box and other accessories.
B0074FGLUM,15,5,So all you see after you hook it up are the HDMI cables looping trying to get behind the TV.
B0074FGLUM,15,6,No universal remote?????
B0074FGLUM,15,7,All HDMI ports don't work.
B0074FGLUM,15,8,We use the TV for our cable.
B0074FGLUM,15,9,The HDMI connection with only work with Samsung DVD players, Samsung computers, etc. and will not work for devices using the HDMI cable everyone else in the industry uses.
B0074FGLUM,15,10,This set does not have any control buttons on the actual unit.
B0074FGLUM,15,11,Very hard to type using this remote.I like the LG TV remotes.
B0074FGLUM,15,12,Transmitter connects to PC,receiver connects to TV.
B0074FGLUM,15,13,As it's a 'smart' TV, why don't you put a small keyboard on remote control?
B0074FGLUM,15,14,This is endless unless you unplug it, the power button on remote or TV have no capability to keep it off.
B0074FGLUM,15,15,When you adjust volume control, change channels, etc the remote gives off a "beep" noise.
B0074FGLUM,15,16,the remote makes it difficult to manoeuvre the cursor.
B0074FGLUM,15,17,It works this time.
B0074FGLUM,15,18,Turning off and on a few times seemed to get it back to normal.
B0074FGLUM,15,19,THOUGHT WAS GETTING A FEW  MORE CHANNELS.
B0074FGLUM,15,20,Winner of the worst remote control design ever!
B0074FGLUM,15,21,I try cleaning the TV same problem and this happened to me on the second time I put on the TV to now and this day 23/01/2014 and the remote and TV has never fallen!
B0074FGLUM,15,22,First go around with smart tv at the home.Issues: devices will not allow for Comcast channel changing.
B0074FGLUM,15,23,May not work as well as a PC monitor for Mac as you would expect!
B0074FGLUM,15,24,UI with remote is difficult.
B00BCGROJG,0,0,This is the brightest and clearest viewing screen that you will ever view.
B00BCGROJG,0,1,I think I need to tweek the picture on it a little more but it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,0,2,I think because it's 3D they gave it a nice strong black light and 10 is about where normal viewing should be.
B00BCGROJG,0,3,Great TV for the Living Room.
B00BCGROJG,0,4,The screen size is perfect for someone that likes movies.
B00BCGROJG,0,5,I mean if you want a good TV with a nice screen get it!!!
B00BCGROJG,0,6,Also, the side viewing angle is not great as screen colors become significantly washed out.
B00BCGROJG,0,7,It looks great In our conference room.
B00BCGROJG,0,8,Great bright picture, this tv is in our family room and the tv has no problem in a room with light.2.
B00BCGROJG,0,9,In our living room there are off angle seats and you can tell the blacks are not as dark off angle.
B00BCGROJG,0,10,Great picture quality... leakage of blacks.. First of all.
B00BCGROJG,0,11,Do I think the picture quality is as good as the PANNY?
B00BCGROJG,0,12,However, the picture during dark scenes or if you are watching at night in a dark room is not the best.
B00BCGROJG,0,13,Great brights but the darks are not all that :o( I love this TV BUT my only problem is with dark scenes.
B00BCGROJG,0,14,The picture looks fantastic on these screens.
B00BCGROJG,0,15,The picture is still good, just not as great as when you are in front of it.
B00BCGROJG,0,16,Great TV - Very Thin - Good Value.
B00BCGROJG,0,17,I must say I love this TV, we have never watched so much TV in our living room.
B00BCGROJG,0,18,Great TVs make everything you watch look better.
B00BCGROJG,0,19,Great flat screen TV.
B00BCGROJG,0,20,Perfect screen with lighting issue gone!
B00BCGROJG,0,21,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,0,22,Perfect size, great picture and a smart TV too.
B00BCGROJG,0,23,Brightness is better and washed when viewing at an angle.Other than the viewing angle, the TV is a good buy at $2K.
B00BCGROJG,0,24,Great Picture But..... Great picture with amazing contrast and color "pop" but.....the viewing angles are not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,1,0,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,1,Great tv at a great price.
B00BCGROJG,1,2,Great tv
B00BCGROJG,1,3,Everyone would commend on how great the picture is.

B00BCGROJG,1,8,I love my Samsung TV!!
B00BCGROJG,1,9,None of the Sonys we liked were available (2012 models); then, we saw this Samsung for a very good price and decided to buy.
B00BCGROJG,1,10,Its picture is very good and cant get enough of it.
B00BCGROJG,1,11,Good value for $1600.
B00BCGROJG,1,12,Great picture/dead in 3 months.
B00BCGROJG,1,13,so good.

B00BCGROJG,1,15,Samsung UN65F7100 review.
B00BCGROJG,1,16,Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,1,17,Do I think the picture quality is as good as the PANNY?
B00BCGROJG,1,18,Good picture but not as good as my old Pioneer plazma.
B00BCGROJG,1,19,This is a great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,20,Otherwise a great television.
B00BCGROJG,1,21,Samsung makes the best HD TV at a good price better than Sony and Sharp and all others.
B00BCGROJG,1,22,Very Good TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,23,We've always loved Samsung and love this TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,24,Buy It! Great TV!

B00BCGROJG,2,9,Great picture.
B00BCGROJG,2,10,I don't but this is a great TV.

B00BCGROJG,2,13,TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,2,14,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,15,Great TV!
B00BCGROJG,2,16,The sound is good, but I'm going to get some speakers for a better audio experience.
B00BCGROJG,2,17,The sound is not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,2,18,The sound is acceptable, but an external sound system is really necessary for sound immersion.
B00BCGROJG,2,19,Everything is good.
B00BCGROJG,2,20,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,2,21,Very nice picture.
B00BCGROJG,2,22,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,2,23,Great Picture, Poor Smarts.
B00BCGROJG,2,24,I am running sound through my Denon AVR E300 receiver and it is great.
B00BCGROJG,3,0,Great TV - Not So Great Delivery Service.

B00BCGROJG,6,0,They work ok, not great, but ok.
B00BCGROJG,6,1,Loaded with apps just like your smartphone.
B00BCGROJG,6,2,The internet apps (Netflix and Hulu) work great.
B00BCGROJG,6,3,Its good.
B00BCGROJG,6,4,Great Smart Features, they most likely have any app or service you could want.Cons:1.
B00BCGROJG,6,5,So far so good....
B00BCGROJG,6,6,Nearly all Apps are free.
B00BCGROJG,6,7,great!
B00BCGROJG,6,8,That seems to work.I love to watch my sports, specifically hockey and with the Stanley Cup Playoffs currently playing, to me it is like watching it Live- Awesome picture.
B00BCGROJG,6,9,3D does work, watched few 3D movies from Netflix.
B00BCGROJG,6,10,Smart TV...is great.
B00BCGROJG,6,11,Great Smart TV.
B00BCGROJG,6,12,The apps are great and works well, only draw back is with remote.
B00BCGROJG,6,13,This smart TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,6,14,Not a feature we were looking for but it works well.3.
B00BCGROJG,6,15,Did pretty good with Netflix over WiFi.
B00BCGROJG,6,16,Apps are great, setup easy.
B00BCGROJG,6,17,Can't wait to watch a 3D movie.
B00BCGROJG,6,18,Love it!
B00BCGROJG,6,19,The install went great and the tv worked well for about 2 months.
B00BCGROJG,6,20,Great picture.
B00BCGROJG,6,21,Some work great with no errors or slowness and others constantly buffer and I know it's not my end because I have a very fast internet service.
B00BCGROJG,6,22,Good things come in without a problem like this.
B00BCGROJG,6,23,3D works well.Think I made a great choice, Very much satisfied with it!
B00BCGROJG,6,24,Great features.
B00BCGROJG,7,0,I've only watched cable tv so far (via the cable box and HDMI), but I've seen the Samsung GUI and it looks amazing, so I'll be trying that as soon as the tv is connected to the internet.
B00BCGROJG,7,1,I think I need to tweek the picture on it a little more but it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,7,2,Great picture quality out the box!
B00BCGROJG,7,3,This Tv is a Great value.
B00BCGROJG,7,4,I connected them with HDMI cables, while hooking sound system with optical cable directly to TV.
B00BCGROJG,7,5,Great picture quality (Out the box in Movie Mode).
B00BCGROJG,7,6,I love being able to see all my pictures and videos any time without the need of a DVD player.
B00BCGROJG,7,7,The blu-ray movie I watched was Despicable me, if you have watched this movie before you would know the cute little minions.
B00BCGROJG,7,8,Resolution looks amazing, especially while playing video games and watching HD (I wouldn't buy this TV if I didn't have these two).
B00BCGROJG,7,9,Picture is great.
B00BCGROJG,7,10,Great Picture but so many settings it takes forever to set the colors and picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,7,11,Was plug and play right out of the box.
B00BCGROJG,7,12,The picture is amazingly clear and perfect on the HD channels.
B00BCGROJG,7,13,I also have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and the AllShare is great for sending my videos and pictures to the TV for viewing.
B00BCGROJG,7,14,I can't plug my Direct TV HDMI cable to the Samsung ARC input and maybe someone on here will be able to steer me to the right direction.
B00BCGROJG,7,15,With 4 HDMI inputs and all sorts of USB drive options you can watch an endless stream of video.The sound quality is very good.
B00BCGROJG,7,16,I have home theater system, cable box and DVD and BRay.
B00BCGROJG,7,17,Great Picture on HD Channels.
B00BCGROJG,7,18,The HDMI to cable box connection assures a great out of the box picture.
B00BCGROJG,7,19,I want to be able to turn it on, pick a source (cable / DVD / AmazonTV / USB / etc.) and go.
B00BCGROJG,7,20,Great Picture Quality but not so great sound quality.
B00BCGROJG,7,21,SO FAR SO GOOD.
B00BCGROJG,7,22,Good tv. a lot of good things about this tv.
B00BCGROJG,7,23,I would rate it between 4 to 5 stars and here's why.After a few hours of playing with the picture settings and advanced settings, using a Time Warner cable box with HDMI connection, the picture is spectacular for 95% of the HD content.
B00BCGROJG,7,24,I did not know how to getrid of that for the first movie we watched except to set to "movie" mode instead of standard.
B00BCGROJG,8,0,Defective screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,1,It also had this bouncing white square go across the top of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,2,3 out of 3 screens had a dead pixel.
B00BCGROJG,8,3,The first set I took home had 6 - 8 gray bard radiating up vertically from top to bottom whenever the screen was black or letter-boxed -- VERY disturbing.
B00BCGROJG,8,4,Watching it is a pleasure.
B00BCGROJG,8,5,But when vertical bars radiate from  the bottom on a Macbook, it means the LED screen or bar at the bottom of the screen is going bad.
B00BCGROJG,8,6,Again, 4 red stuck pixels on the screen, and some pinkish hue to only the right side of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,7,As soon as it powered on,  the lower left corner of the TV had an estimated 100+ of black and white pixels going jagged and horizontal across the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,8,Perfect screen with lighting issue gone!
B00BCGROJG,8,9,Picture is dark.
B00BCGROJG,8,10,most annoying aspect is that the screen has from time to time gone dark -- not completely dark but the brightness is only about a quarter of normal.
B00BCGROJG,8,11,Since the screen on the self diagnostic  picture is completely full of color, the problem did not appear.
B00BCGROJG,8,12,Picture settings.
B00BCGROJG,8,13,Very noticeable in dark scenes.
B00BCGROJG,8,14,This set has a terrible side viewing angle.
B00BCGROJG,8,15,If you watch a movie with a lot of blacks, dark scenes, you will notice a significant amount of white clouding in the blacked out areas.
B00BCGROJG,8,16,When on a totally black screen there is what I guess they call "clouding" near the 4 corners but mainly the left side top and bottom.
B00BCGROJG,8,17,When you are watching it you are pretty much looking all screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,18,I got the 65", and Yes, it does have some leakage light on the 4 conners.
B00BCGROJG,8,19,After a day, noticed fluorescent green lines at the edge of face or bright objects and more noticeable at the left half of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,20,white clouding on the lower left hand if the screen, visible only when the image is perfectly black.
B00BCGROJG,8,21,It's not the settings themselves that has the issue.
B00BCGROJG,8,22,Immediately noticed 2 red stuck pixels on the screen and some clouding in upper right and lower left sides of the TV.
B00BCGROJG,8,23,Whenever the screen was completely full of color, the picture was fine.
B00BCGROJG,8,24,And now the television displays a white box that moves across the screen whenever watching a letterbox movie or the resolution does not match full screen size.
B00BCGROJG,9,0,TV was DOA at 15 months.
B00BCGROJG,9,1,Do not buy Samsung!!
B00BCGROJG,9,2,Last Samsung purchase.
B00BCGROJG,9,3,TV was purchased for an 85 year old.
B00BCGROJG,9,4,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,9,5,For 58.00 more you now have a 5 year warranty.
B00BCGROJG,9,6,Buy a set for a 1000.00
B00BCGROJG,9,7,Dont buy Samsung - they don't last.
B00BCGROJG,9,8,BUYING A SAMSUNG IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
B00BCGROJG,9,9,BUYING A SAMSUNG IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
B00BCGROJG,9,10,We vowed NEVER to get another Samsung again.
B00BCGROJG,9,11,Now 2 years later - same problem.
B00BCGROJG,9,12,8 months ago I purchased a 55" Samsung for my bedroom.
B00BCGROJG,9,13,Just buy it.
B00BCGROJG,9,14,I purchased a large and expensive Samsung LED TV from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,9,15,Inside I found out was missing 4 3d tv glasses. 2 months later, I'm still dealing with samsung trying to get my missing 4 3d glasses.
B00BCGROJG,9,16,This is my second TV purchase in the past 10 years, my previous set being a 32" Samsung LCD which was mid/high end back in 2004.
B00BCGROJG,9,17,These are much better than the glasses Samsung provided.
B00BCGROJG,9,18,This will buy me some time so I can try again when the 2014's come out.
B00BCGROJG,9,19,(I even wrote a review about it under Samsung PN58C500.)
B00BCGROJG,9,20,65" Samsung replaces 55" Panasonic VT30.
B00BCGROJG,9,21,Just do your research on what model of 3D glasses the TV comes with.
B00BCGROJG,9,22,We thought long and hard about it, and in the end decided to give Samsung another try.We purchased the UN65F7100 TV on 8/19/13.
B00BCGROJG,9,23,I want my money back.I do not see the point of you not accepting a return without the box when AMAZON and SAMSUNG doesn't have any problems with the same item at all.
B00BCGROJG,9,24,We could have purchased this locally through the Big Box store, but Amazon was a better deal.
B00BCGROJG,10,0,Before someone tells me that I shouldn't use tv speakers and should instead use a surround sound system, I get that.
B00BCGROJG,10,1,every time when i turn on the TV, the sound bar is turned on automatically.
B00BCGROJG,10,2,annoying was the TV speakers rattle sometimes, at low volume, when on surround sound mode.
B00BCGROJG,10,3,Sound quality is good too.
B00BCGROJG,10,4,The louder you make the sound, the louder that dink noises becomes.
B00BCGROJG,10,5,picture is great, sound is OK (but that's why you have a home theater system).
B00BCGROJG,10,6,Sound is OK and the TV has a few different sound settings but nothing special.
B00BCGROJG,10,7,OTHER REVIEWS COMPLAINED ABOUT THE SOUND NOT BEING LOUD ENOUGH BUT I DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK THAT WAS A PROBLEM.
B00BCGROJG,10,8,The sound is acceptable, but an external sound system is really necessary for sound immersion.
B00BCGROJG,10,9,The sound is not as bad as some reviewers say, at least for me, but I will be purchasing speakers later simply because that's what they're for!
B00BCGROJG,10,10,They also set it up to where I can have the TV sound only or switch to the 5.1 Surround Sound with one touch.
B00BCGROJG,10,11,The apps on the TV cannot give you 5.1 sound because the output must go from your cable (or satellite) box to the home theater system, not from the digital audio out from the TV.
B00BCGROJG,10,12,First off, you bought a TV, not a sound system.
B00BCGROJG,10,13,A small annoying thing that I still don't know if there's a fix for is that "dink" noise that the volume control makes.
B00BCGROJG,10,14,Once it turned off by itself.
B00BCGROJG,10,15,The sound is good, but I'm going to get some speakers for a better audio experience.
B00BCGROJG,10,16,Clear picture, and great sound even without sound system.
B00BCGROJG,10,17,Sound seems comparable to others but who doesn't expect to have a sound system of comparable value connected eventually?
B00BCGROJG,10,18,Here are a few that come with this TV:This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low.
B00BCGROJG,10,19,Here are a few that come with this TV:This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low.
B00BCGROJG,10,20,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,10,21,Sound is fine (was a concern to me).
B00BCGROJG,10,22,It made a clicking sound when you pressed the power button, but no image or sound.
B00BCGROJG,10,23,Mounts very close to the wall so the wires do not show.
B00BCGROJG,10,24,Speakers are on bottom edge; perhaps those who didn't like the sound have mounted their set too close to a surface at the bottom edge.
B00BCGROJG,11,0,Samsung customer service wasn't very helpful in acknowledging the problem.
B00BCGROJG,11,1,I called Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,11,2,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,11,3,Customer service was no help.
B00BCGROJG,11,4,Called Samsung and we had service scheduled.
B00BCGROJG,11,5,A pattern is emerging, so a call to Samsung, not the service center.
B00BCGROJG,11,6,After more than 2 hours on the call I got them to assign the ticket to a new customer service center.
B00BCGROJG,11,7,Pray that you don't have any problems with it.
B00BCGROJG,11,8,Boo Samsung, boo!
B00BCGROJG,11,9,Samsung customer service is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced.
B00BCGROJG,11,10,Having Problems.
B00BCGROJG,11,11,I got a replacement and that unit had the same issue on the same day!
B00BCGROJG,11,12,I called Samsung to exchange them.
B00BCGROJG,11,13,Well you betcha I have problems.
B00BCGROJG,11,14,Worst when I called support again to record the issue they give me a repair ticket number and a phone number to call.
B00BCGROJG,11,15,TV great, customer service not so much.
B00BCGROJG,11,16,Dont buy Samsung - they don't last.
B00BCGROJG,11,17,I do not want this repaired.
B00BCGROJG,11,18,We vowed NEVER to get another Samsung again.
B00BCGROJG,11,19,Call Samsung and have them replace the panel or live with it.
B00BCGROJG,11,20,I have had tremendous success with Samsung and Amazon's service has always been good to me.
B00BCGROJG,11,21,They will not replace them under warranty and say they are normal.
B00BCGROJG,11,22,I called Samsung back and was told that the email would arrive only after the exchange was approved by executive level customer service.
B00BCGROJG,11,23,I have had the TV for a week now and am still waiting on repair.
B00BCGROJG,11,24,Customer support was incompetent.
B00BCGROJG,12,0,Awsome picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,12,1,Here is what i found on the lcdtvbuyingguide setting.
B00BCGROJG,12,2,Picture settings.
B00BCGROJG,12,3,Very good picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,12,4,Holy Cow..........what a Picture.
B00BCGROJG,12,5,Very good Quality Tv.
B00BCGROJG,12,6,The picture was ok.
B00BCGROJG,12,7,The picture quality was much better though.
B00BCGROJG,12,8,Let me know if anyone wants to compare picture settings.
B00BCGROJG,12,9,As expected, the picture is great!
B00BCGROJG,12,10,Great TV, but be alerted...
B00BCGROJG,12,11,There are many, many settings that affect brightness, many settings that affect color balance, etc... so even the last few settings will make a big difference to how the picture looks.
B00BCGROJG,12,12,By far the best picture quality of any TV we've owned.
B00BCGROJG,12,13,The picture is excellent.
B00BCGROJG,12,14,Thus far the picture quality on this TV is great.. no doubt about that.
B00BCGROJG,12,15,Flesh tones are mixed in standard setting with some picture calibration of the settings I was able to get them very good.
B00BCGROJG,12,16,Great picture quality (Out the box in Movie Mode).
B00BCGROJG,12,17,Then I went into setting and made set it to default.
B00BCGROJG,12,18,This TV has a perfect picture image.
B00BCGROJG,12,19,Great picture quality out the box!
B00BCGROJG,12,20,Good tv.
B00BCGROJG,12,21,The picture is perfect.
B00BCGROJG,12,22,Out of the box the picture image is not so good.
B00BCGROJG,12,23,Nice picture, once it is adjusted.What
B00BCGROJG,12,24,The picture quality of this television out of the box is good - but the default settings are atrocious!
B00BCGROJG,13,0,*****W A R N I N G*****Do not buy SAMSUNG Televisions!!!
B00BCGROJG,13,1,Samsung TV purchased.
B00BCGROJG,13,2,Beware before buying.
B00BCGROJG,13,3,Great buy.
B00BCGROJG,13,4,If I have any problems I will update this review.
B00BCGROJG,13,5,Samsung phone/tablet division needs to take over it's TV division's software quality control.Don't buy this TV for it's smarts ... it really is NOT smart & very sluggish (slow) if you to do anything of substance on the web.Potentially a great product ... but Samsung TV division needs to fix its software quality control problems.
B00BCGROJG,13,6,Review for Samsung UN75F7100  75" LED TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,7,I almost did not buy this TV after reading some of the 5-star reviews!
B00BCGROJG,13,8,I have a few Samsung products including this TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,9,Samsung also needs to get it's quality control better.
B00BCGROJG,13,10,By all means buy this TV but DO NOT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THE ALLSHARE 'SOFTWARE PRODUCT'!
B00BCGROJG,13,11,Samsung LED Products Suffer huge Clouding/Flashlighting Problems.
B00BCGROJG,13,12,Samsung LED Products Suffer huge Clouding/Flashlighting Problems.
B00BCGROJG,13,13,Props to Samsung and their quality control.
B00BCGROJG,13,14,I would definitely buy it again and recommend it, but they need a redesign on their remote.
B00BCGROJG,13,15,I will revise this review once I get the TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,16,feature I was disappointed in was that the stand cannot be made to swivel 360degs.
B00BCGROJG,13,17,And I had to write a review!The picture quality on this tv is unsurpassed!
B00BCGROJG,13,18,Overall a great product.
B00BCGROJG,13,19,Great buy but I didn't expect the touch-pad type remote control.Easy to follow the manual provided for setting up.
B00BCGROJG,13,20,Last Samsung I will ever buy.
B00BCGROJG,13,21,It's not the settings themselves that has the issue.
B00BCGROJG,13,22,They denied any responsibility for their product.
B00BCGROJG,13,23,Buyer beware!
B00BCGROJG,13,24,Stay away from Samsung TV's.
B00BCGROJG,14,0,Plus the smart tv with all the apps this tv has it all...
B00BCGROJG,14,1,bottom-line is this smart TV just like a Not-Smart-TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,2,The smart TV app?
B00BCGROJG,14,3,wireless is not work.
B00BCGROJG,14,4,There does seem to be a "flow" problem with the SMART tv at times.
B00BCGROJG,14,5,The internet apps (Netflix and Hulu) work great.
B00BCGROJG,14,6,The same problem was found on the Amazon App in the Smart Hub but not as bad.
B00BCGROJG,14,7,Getting back to the Smart Hub.
B00BCGROJG,14,8,At the same times apps like netflix and amazon will be reset.
B00BCGROJG,14,9,Not too smart.
B00BCGROJG,14,10,I get a network error watching Netflix and Hulu, but I use the Plex app most of all.
B00BCGROJG,14,11,Netflix, Amazon, and Youtube work as expected.
B00BCGROJG,14,12,i couldn't use the Wi-fi to watch the internet TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,13,This if forgivable as you DO NOT WANT TO USE THEIR SMART TV anyway if you can.
B00BCGROJG,14,14,The is a smart TV. 5 star for the TV part. 1 start for "smart" part.
B00BCGROJG,14,15,Samsung, please update and fix this hiccup.
B00BCGROJG,14,16,Unlike some smart TV's it has a browser that you can go anywhere on the internet that you can like a smart phone.
B00BCGROJG,14,17,I also found that every app in the Smart Hub was very fast and did not cause me to become impatient.
B00BCGROJG,14,18,Previews are available on like 10 different apps.
B00BCGROJG,14,19,Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,14,20,Apps can't be reorganized.
B00BCGROJG,14,21,I think that if I don't want an app, I should be able to de-install it.
B00BCGROJG,14,22,Sometimes it works fine and other times I have to turn my tv off and on every 5 minutes.
B00BCGROJG,14,23,this TV wireless connection is very bad.
B00BCGROJG,14,24,Then when I tried to send a YouTube video from my Samsung Galaxy S3 to the TV, I couldn't not get it to connect.
B00BCGROJG,15,0,The remote control is a little funky and takes time getting used to.
B00BCGROJG,15,1,The remote, however, is dysfunctional.
B00BCGROJG,15,2,It cannot be used to select a channel from the guide--I have to use my cable box remote to select channels.
B00BCGROJG,15,3,I didn't see any.I will say that the remote takes some getting used to.
B00BCGROJG,15,4,Only issue is the remote contrôl.
B00BCGROJG,15,5,would anyone need 4 HDMI inputs?
B00BCGROJG,15,6,The only issue i really have is the remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,7,I'd rather have buttons.
B00BCGROJG,15,8,If there is one thing that I dislike, it is the remote control.
B00BCGROJG,15,9,There aren't any buttons!
B00BCGROJG,15,10,The only thing I don't like is the remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,11,Instead you have to press the “more” button on the remote that will give you a virtual remote on the screen that will let you change to a specific channel.
B00BCGROJG,15,12,All HDMI ports don't work.
B00BCGROJG,15,13,It would be nice, though, to have these buttons on the remote.-
B00BCGROJG,15,14,You will need to use a universal remote (making sure you disable the powering on from the remote as the TV will do this on it's own) or the receiver remote to change the receiver input back to the correct device.
B00BCGROJG,15,15,Intuitive.The remote with a touch pad works okay.
B00BCGROJG,15,16,Only in the remote did not find the mute button, that is more important to have it.
B00BCGROJG,15,17,Plugged in power and HDMI and it worked.
B00BCGROJG,15,18,Smart Touch remote - ok but a little limited as you may still need to use a second remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,19,I would recommend using your cable box remote or a universal remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,20,Could Samsung simplify the remote by not using the swype pad?
B00BCGROJG,15,21,I like and use the tv remote sometimes paired with the cable remote but my wife is strictly a cable remote user.
B00BCGROJG,15,22,But tv works well overall.
B00BCGROJG,15,23,The only thing that I do not like its the mute button on the remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,24,Well, gee, that's what I thought a TV with a remote should do.
B00AOA9BL0,0,0,Watching on  such a small screen does.
B00AOA9BL0,0,1,Great.
B00AOA9BL0,0,2,Sitting on my back porch watching missed TV shows its nice.
B00AOA9BL0,0,3,Works great!
B00AOA9BL0,0,4,good.
B00AOA9BL0,0,5,Shows the bitrate on some movies right in the middle of the screen.
B00AOA9BL0,0,6,Any time I can take CNN to the bathroom is a good thing.
B00AOA9BL0,0,7,I watched the Dark Shadow movie the other day and it was good.
B00AOA9BL0,0,8,Works Great on My Ipod.
B00AOA9BL0,0,9,I'm on the go.Now i can watch TV on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,0,10,I do wish you could attach to a tv to watch on bigger screen.
B00AOA9BL0,0,11,great but.
B00AOA9BL0,0,12,I love watching TV while I am using the treadmill but we have no TV in the exercise room.
B00AOA9BL0,0,13,On the minus side, there must be a better a way to sort through shows especially alphabetically.
B00AOA9BL0,0,14,Still, all in all there is a great variety of shows available.
B00AOA9BL0,0,15,Better!
B00AOA9BL0,0,16,When you close out and start back up it should bring you to a home screen instead of where you left off..
B00AOA9BL0,0,17,Being able to watch some shows live being away from home is great also.
B00AOA9BL0,0,18,i want watch walking dead while eating corn on the cob at the inlaws in Londrina Brasil.
B00AOA9BL0,0,19,Good but one big flaw.
B00AOA9BL0,0,20,Great App!
B00AOA9BL0,0,21,It gets very annoying when one is trying to watch a good movie or show.
B00AOA9BL0,0,22,Would be great if it didn't freeze up all the time!
B00AOA9BL0,0,23,I don't miss a thing.
B00AOA9BL0,0,24,only one big concern.
B00AOA9BL0,1,0,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,1,1,Best around.
B00AOA9BL0,1,2,I love to bookmark my faves and just veg out and get caught up on my shows.
B00AOA9BL0,1,3,Great television for mobile people into the go.
B00AOA9BL0,1,4,But I have good reason now.
B00AOA9BL0,1,5,Other than that it's got good shows and I love it
B00AOA9BL0,1,6,Been trying for months and no success.
B00AOA9BL0,1,7,I had no reason to believe it wouldn't be the same fantastic quality.
B00AOA9BL0,1,8,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,1,9,Picture quality is good.
B00AOA9BL0,1,10,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,1,11,When it works, I love it.
B00AOA9BL0,1,12,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,1,13,Its good, not great.
B00AOA9BL0,1,14,Good luck!
B00AOA9BL0,1,15,I like it...I use it...I'm happy!
B00AOA9BL0,1,16,Except for when it sometimes doesn't work, it's awesome.
B00AOA9BL0,1,17,Overall I am happy with it.
B00AOA9BL0,1,18,When I first got it it was awesome an worked great.
B00AOA9BL0,1,19,For the most part it is a great one stop shop for channels.
B00AOA9BL0,1,20,So it works great about 90% of the time, and I really like it.
B00AOA9BL0,1,21,Works great most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,1,22,The picture and sound were both great.
B00AOA9BL0,1,23,Otherwise good picture quality and user friendly.
B00AOA9BL0,1,24,Pretty Good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,0,Otherwise, there is no sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,1,The picture and sound were both great.
B00AOA9BL0,2,2,Not hard when there are no other sounds around though.
B00AOA9BL0,2,3,Its good, not great.
B00AOA9BL0,2,4,Great quality.
B00AOA9BL0,2,5,sound is better.
B00AOA9BL0,2,6,The last one I had was very low and I never went on it much because of the sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,7,Picture is great  but I cannot hear the audio  very dissappointed .
B00AOA9BL0,2,8,Overall good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,9,good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,10,Sound issue.
B00AOA9BL0,2,11,Good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,12,Good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,2,13,good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,14,great but.
B00AOA9BL0,2,15,The sound is good with headphones.
B00AOA9BL0,2,16,Good experience.
B00AOA9BL0,2,17,If they could fix the sound, I'd give it 5 stars.
B00AOA9BL0,2,18,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,19,good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,2,20,Picture quality is good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,21,Would be great if it worked.
B00AOA9BL0,2,22,Thanks for big sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,23,SO FAR SO GOOD.
B00AOA9BL0,2,24,Good App, Horrible Sound.
B00AOA9BL0,3,0,never worked.
B00AOA9BL0,3,1,worked great at first.
B00AOA9BL0,3,2,Worked great for about a week.
B00AOA9BL0,3,3,who knows why either, as Amazon.
B00AOA9BL0,3,4,Would be great if it worked.
B00AOA9BL0,3,5,There's nowhere on Amazon to go to get help.
B00AOA9BL0,3,6,So far it's really great.
B00AOA9BL0,3,7,Good day, Sir.
B00AOA9BL0,3,8,Tried this 3 or 4 time over 2 days.
B00AOA9BL0,3,9,That's one less homework assignment when you arrive home.

B00AOA9BL0,3,14,Called amazon, Comcast, no help.
B00AOA9BL0,3,15,serviceable.
B00AOA9BL0,3,16,It does not work with all the boxes in the house.
B00AOA9BL0,3,17,So far so good!
B00AOA9BL0,3,18,Though I am satisfied with my services, the customer service would rate at best a D-, and cost for those services about the same.
B00AOA9BL0,3,19,Who do I call ?
B00AOA9BL0,3,20,Still, all in all there is a great variety of shows available.
B00AOA9BL0,3,21,Good value, especially if you like binge-watching tv shows.
B00AOA9BL0,3,22,Did not work for me or many others.
B00AOA9BL0,3,23,Worked amazingly at first.
B00AOA9BL0,3,24,Okay product.
B00AOA9BL0,4,0,Picture quality is good.

B00AOA9BL0,4,10,It works just sometimes it has to buffer to get really good picture and quality
B00AOA9BL0,4,11,Easy to use too.
B00AOA9BL0,4,12,Others looked great.
B00AOA9BL0,4,13,It's really good and I like it a lot.
B00AOA9BL0,4,14,Watching movies is great!

B00AOA9BL0,4,20,The picture and sound were both great.
B00AOA9BL0,4,21,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,4,22,I love it it's amazing.
B00AOA9BL0,4,23,But it works really good
B00AOA9BL0,4,24,It works really good.
B00AOA9BL0,5,0,Like others have said...Good but not great!
B00AOA9BL0,5,1,I'm sure this is a great product.
B00AOA9BL0,5,2,Review.
B00AOA9BL0,5,3,no good!
B00AOA9BL0,5,4,If I could rate this a zero I would so I rate as a one!
B00AOA9BL0,5,5,Other than that it's a very good thing to have.
B00AOA9BL0,5,6,I would recommend to others.
B00AOA9BL0,5,7,would recommend
B00AOA9BL0,5,8,I recommend that you get it,and give a try.
B00AOA9BL0,5,9,I would recommend it.
B00AOA9BL0,5,10,not recommend it to anyone
B00AOA9BL0,5,11,Would not recommend.
B00AOA9BL0,5,12,However, for the times I have used it I rate it okay.
B00AOA9BL0,5,13,It's free is the only good thing that I didn't buy it.
B00AOA9BL0,5,14,Good but definitely needs more live tv.
B00AOA9BL0,5,15,Definite recommend.
B00AOA9BL0,5,16,Definitely recommend for those who like to watch tv on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,5,17,Waste of time it is no good should be taken off so no one else wastes their time What a shame
B00AOA9BL0,5,18,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,5,19,nice.
B00AOA9BL0,5,20,Good product even if the search is cumbersome.
B00AOA9BL0,5,21,If I had to pay for it, I would rate it a 1/5 and not purchase it.
B00AOA9BL0,5,22,I would absolutely recommend!
B00AOA9BL0,5,23,I absolutely recommend it!
B00AOA9BL0,5,24,waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,6,0,Otherwise, the app is okay.
B00AOA9BL0,6,1,What has happened to this app?
B00AOA9BL0,6,2,Ok. Ok app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,3,I like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,4,I like this app!
B00AOA9BL0,6,5,Cannot use app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,6,NOT A GO APP.
B00AOA9BL0,6,7,gGood app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,8,Must have app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,9,I would like to see these incorporated into this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,10,The potential for this app is there.
B00AOA9BL0,6,11,I like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,12,Using this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,13,Well keep using this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,14,So far I really dig this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,15,I really like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,16,This app will not work on my reg.
B00AOA9BL0,6,17,This app works very well.
B00AOA9BL0,6,18,I like the app and usually it works.
B00AOA9BL0,6,19,Please patch this app with a fix!
B00AOA9BL0,6,20,this app is borked.
B00AOA9BL0,6,21,This app doesn't work at all!
B00AOA9BL0,6,22,Don't like the shortage of apps available.
B00AOA9BL0,6,23,Instead of downloading all the different apps to watch shows and tv on, I can just use this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,24,I downloaded this app, but it only works w/iTunes app.
B00AOA9BL0,7,0,If I wanted to watch it at home I would use the cable box.
B00AOA9BL0,7,1,The quality it'snot hd and mightnot translate well if you connect it to your tv but it did fine on the device.
B00AOA9BL0,7,2,Cable went out during a recent ice storm.
B00AOA9BL0,7,3,Help, I just bought a new hdtv to connect to my fire hd via hdmi cable, and no shows will play whether connected to the tv or not.
B00AOA9BL0,7,4,Good.
B00AOA9BL0,7,5,I was able to watch ONE video and the same thing happened again.
B00AOA9BL0,7,6,works great.
B00AOA9BL0,7,7,Best to have a good internet connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,8,As if the price of cable wasn't enough.
B00AOA9BL0,7,9,You can watch tv and movies which isn't at all what I wanted.
B00AOA9BL0,7,10,Otherwise, it's a very good player.
B00AOA9BL0,7,11,If anyone can make the video player actually work as described, please let me know!
B00AOA9BL0,7,12,Won't change the channel.
B00AOA9BL0,7,13,Great ap.
B00AOA9BL0,7,14,The HD quality is superb.
B00AOA9BL0,7,15,It works for what I need it for.
B00AOA9BL0,7,16,Also tried them at Starbucks, didn't really work there.
B00AOA9BL0,7,17,I get shows I could  not get on Netflix with good reception, and clear video.
B00AOA9BL0,7,18,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,7,19,All shows all movies ALL THE TIME.
B00AOA9BL0,7,20,Great app.
B00AOA9BL0,7,21,Doesn't always want  to work though.
B00AOA9BL0,7,22,When I first got this app, it was great.
B00AOA9BL0,7,23,Of course, it would be nice if Viacom network shows were available or if cable wasn't so absurdly overpriced, but you can't have everything.
B00AOA9BL0,7,24,Just wish I could connect to my home dvr.
B00AOA9BL0,8,0,Gotta get these problems fixed or no one will want it!!
B00AOA9BL0,8,1,There is a green bar at the top of your screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,2,Only works part time.
B00AOA9BL0,8,3,Really wanted this to work- tried to watch Hollywood Game Night.
B00AOA9BL0,8,4,First show there were a few times it stopped and then started.
B00AOA9BL0,8,5,Have to keep moving slide bar on time left in program.
B00AOA9BL0,8,6,Sometimes it continues playing sound but has a blank screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,7,It's noticeable enough to be annoying.
B00AOA9BL0,8,8,Great if you'd like to watch aTV show on your 5 inch screen, better if you had a kindle.
B00AOA9BL0,8,9,Impossible to watch a show without interruption.
B00AOA9BL0,8,10,Often times just plainly won't work, gives a blank screen that completely stops responding.
B00AOA9BL0,8,11,It also has problems with &#34;playback&#34;... all together annoying '': \
B00AOA9BL0,8,12,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,8,13,Watching on  such a small screen does.
B00AOA9BL0,8,14,Screen looks good but stops.
B00AOA9BL0,8,15,Don't bother unless you have a larger device unless you'd like to watch TV on a little screen as it doesn't fill the entire screen with the show.Hope that this helps.Time to uninstall.
B00AOA9BL0,8,16,Out of the 20+ times I've tried this, maybe 3 or 4 times I was actually able to watch something.
B00AOA9BL0,8,17,I have to keep my finger on the screen and use my other hand to immediately tap the nav button I want when I lift my &#34;first&#34; hand.The steady and high quality video makes up for it, mostly!
B00AOA9BL0,8,18,Thankfully, after almost a year they FINALLY fixed that problem!More.recently,
B00AOA9BL0,8,19,It's as if you're watching stop-motion video... everyone is moving just a little slow and choppy.
B00AOA9BL0,8,20,I watched the Dark Shadow movie the other day and it was good.
B00AOA9BL0,8,21,On the Xmas version of Hollywood Game Night ~ it kept starting and stopping and finally stopped completely.
B00AOA9BL0,8,22,I mean, I can only go without Doctor Who and Top Gear for so long.
B00AOA9BL0,8,23,Fade in fade out.
B00AOA9BL0,8,24,I just watched half of an hour long show, and got to see the same ad about 30 times.
B00AOA9BL0,9,0,This has never worked in the 5 months I have it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,1,Had It 5 Months- Never Worked.
B00AOA9BL0,9,2,I've had this for a few months now and it has never worked once.
B00AOA9BL0,9,3,Buy a nook
B00AOA9BL0,9,4,Did not work with my TV.
B00AOA9BL0,9,5,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,9,6,Thankfully, after almost a year they FINALLY fixed that problem!More.recently,
B00AOA9BL0,9,7,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,9,8,I so wished I knew about this trouble before my purchase.
B00AOA9BL0,9,9,I guess my big TV is too old for this product!
B00AOA9BL0,9,10,Hope will get better.
B00AOA9BL0,9,11,Other than that I am happy.
B00AOA9BL0,9,12,I will pay better attention in the future, sorry for any trouble I caused.
B00AOA9BL0,9,13,Disappointing.
B00AOA9BL0,9,14,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,9,15,So it works great about 90% of the time, and I really like it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,16,Works great most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,17,Must need to purchase something from Amazon to enjoy yet another free app.
B00AOA9BL0,9,18,Works - Most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,19,Worth a try.
B00AOA9BL0,9,20,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,9,21,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,9,22,This app has worked ok over the last year, but for the last three weeks it's been horrible!
B00AOA9BL0,9,23,Waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,24,Dont waste your storage...or your time.
B00AOA9BL0,10,0,volume.
B00AOA9BL0,10,1,I can't hear anything and my volume is all the way up.
B00AOA9BL0,10,2,Volume.
B00AOA9BL0,10,3,Volume controls are set to low, hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,10,4,its okay, but sometimes hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,10,5,volume is awful!
B00AOA9BL0,10,6,BUT desperately need volume button.
B00AOA9BL0,10,7,needs volume button.
B00AOA9BL0,10,8,volume too low and needs quick rewind button.
B00AOA9BL0,10,9,The only way to adjust is with the headset volume control.
B00AOA9BL0,10,10,As mentioned by others the volume is very low even with head phones and using external speakers only makes it slightly more of normal  volume level but not really loud so if your hard of hearing or are you are multitasking you may not really hear much.
B00AOA9BL0,10,11,With out headphones it is quite hard to hear.That's the only bad thing.
B00AOA9BL0,10,12,The volume doesn't get very loud, so I have to hook up speakers to hear shows on xfinity.
B00AOA9BL0,10,13,can't hear anything!
B00AOA9BL0,10,14,Needs a volume control on the app itself.
B00AOA9BL0,10,15,This app has no volume control and the audio track volume is so low I can't hear it clearly even with headphones!
B00AOA9BL0,10,16,Try to make it work, no dice.
B00AOA9BL0,10,17,The only thing I do not like about this app is there is no volume control.
B00AOA9BL0,10,18,Even with Blue Tooth headphones, the volume is just too low.
B00AOA9BL0,10,19,Even when set to the highest level you can barely hear the sound.
B00AOA9BL0,10,20,Also the volume control on this app is quite low and have to have headphones on in order to hear it clearly.
B00AOA9BL0,10,21,Also, there are no volume controls on the player and with the volume turned all the way up on the Kindle you can still barely hear anything.
B00AOA9BL0,10,22,And I have good hearing.
B00AOA9BL0,10,23,For those having problems with the volume being to low I found that if you go to settings in the app, then playback options, then click on volume control you can make it pretty loud.
B00AOA9BL0,10,24,Overrides my kindle' s volume controls.
B00AOA9BL0,11,0,I think that's what they called it?
B00AOA9BL0,11,1,I even have emailed about this and was told to call and get help that way.
B00AOA9BL0,11,2,Terrible customer service
B00AOA9BL0,11,3,I have the paid service, yet it work intermittly.
B00AOA9BL0,11,4,And on the many  phone calls to comcast for tech support, this was never mentioned!
B00AOA9BL0,11,5,Did not work with my TV.
B00AOA9BL0,11,6,I wish I could give this service a better score, but it keeps going down.
B00AOA9BL0,11,7,Fix or I will get a different cable service all together.
B00AOA9BL0,11,8,YOU GUYS NEED TO WORK ON IT.
B00AOA9BL0,11,9,Why can't they just email me back and help me out that way?
B00AOA9BL0,11,10,I had the best Guy, Michael, come out to address a number of problems I was experiencing and he set this up for me.
B00AOA9BL0,11,11,I am hoping that with new releases/updates that some of these issues will be resolved.
B00AOA9BL0,11,12,Installed three weeks ago, repair men have come to "fix" the problems only to have something else pop up or the repair that was made didn't quite fix it.
B00AOA9BL0,11,13,It didn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,11,14,I pay $150.00  a month and I should get this option!! Thanks comcast for stopping everything in the world that customers pay for!!!!!!
B00AOA9BL0,11,15,It works, BUT...
B00AOA9BL0,11,16,It tok a day and a few phone calls, but I finally got the app working.
B00AOA9BL0,11,17,Waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,18,Dont waste your storage...or your time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,19,For the amount I pay, I expected better service.
B00AOA9BL0,11,20,I am doing something wrong and you know how to correct it, Please contact me.
B00AOA9BL0,11,21,Though I am satisfied with my services, the customer service would rate at best a D-, and cost for those services about the same.
B00AOA9BL0,11,22,Worked well before and now it gives a error message (for 3 months now) They need to fix it asap.
B00AOA9BL0,11,23,I am getting close to changing to another paid service.
B00AOA9BL0,11,24,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,12,0,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,1,Good but choppy.
B00AOA9BL0,12,2,It's good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,12,3,good but not excellent.
B00AOA9BL0,12,4,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,12,5,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,12,6,Screen looks good but stops.
B00AOA9BL0,12,7,Works perfectly with excellent picture.
B00AOA9BL0,12,8,Pretty good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,9,Quality is good and there are a ton of shows to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,12,10,good, but long way from great.
B00AOA9BL0,12,11,Great so.
B00AOA9BL0,12,12,Picture quality is good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,13,When it works, it's great but it stops and starts and gets blurry often.
B00AOA9BL0,12,14,not to good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,15,The picture and sound were both great.
B00AOA9BL0,12,16,I wish the controls were a bit better.
B00AOA9BL0,12,17,Clear picture and sound, awesome to be able to watch shows on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,12,18,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,12,19,I probably will only use this app to watch BBC America while I am away at college.
B00AOA9BL0,12,20,This app needs a little tweaking.
B00AOA9BL0,12,21,When the app does work the picture is crisp and it is a good experience.
B00AOA9BL0,12,22,VERY BAD.
B00AOA9BL0,12,23,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,12,24,Good picture, bad sound, no choices.
B00AOA9BL0,13,0,Twp Star Review.
B00AOA9BL0,13,1,I cannot review a product that I cannot access.
B00AOA9BL0,13,2,I rated it why do I need to write a review?
B00AOA9BL0,13,3,I rated it why do I need to write a review?
B00AOA9BL0,13,4,Will change review when I do
B00AOA9BL0,13,5,There are no updates that would work.
B00AOA9BL0,13,6,Hate this product.
B00AOA9BL0,13,7,Disappointed and aggrivated now.
B00AOA9BL0,13,8,Gave it a one star because it did not work, don't like the word hate.
B00AOA9BL0,13,9,You should be able to at least buy the upgrade or get a trade in and not have to buy a whole new device to be up to date.
B00AOA9BL0,13,10,Now IMHO the way the Featured page is set up makes it almost useless.
B00AOA9BL0,13,11,As usual, I feel cheated in that I'm always required to buy a new device every year in order to keep up when there's NOTHING wrong with the device I already have.
B00AOA9BL0,13,12,I tried a couple of times.
B00AOA9BL0,13,13,BEWARE.
B00AOA9BL0,13,14,Be careful and get it in writing.
B00AOA9BL0,13,15,It is unacceptable that I know there is a problem when apparently they don't know or they don't care.
B00AOA9BL0,13,16,I believe this to be unfair and scam to buyers.
B00AOA9BL0,13,17,huge disappointment.
B00AOA9BL0,13,18,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,13,19,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,13,20,Instructions not clear.
B00AOA9BL0,13,21,Works perfect, but Amazon needs to update when this app updates nationally.
B00AOA9BL0,13,22,Waste of time it is no good should be taken off so no one else wastes their time What a shame
B00AOA9BL0,13,23,Waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,13,24,Dont waste your storage...or your time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,0,it actualy works.
B00AOA9BL0,14,1,Does not work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,2,I didn't have any problems with the old app.
B00AOA9BL0,14,3,Works - Most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,4,Netflix has more variety.but
B00AOA9BL0,14,5,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,6,Good app... when it works!
B00AOA9BL0,14,7,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,8,works well even with a less than ideal network connection.
B00AOA9BL0,14,9,It didn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,10,I probably will only use this app to watch BBC America while I am away at college.
B00AOA9BL0,14,11,It seems to be working now.
B00AOA9BL0,14,12,Never have this problem with Netflix app on the same device with the same Wi-Fi connection.
B00AOA9BL0,14,13,I have this app on all my devices and it stops playing after about 30 every time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,14,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,15,App was doing great until last update.
B00AOA9BL0,14,16,There are no updates that would work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,17,great when it works!
B00AOA9BL0,14,18,It worked and then they did something so it will not let me connect to the internet through my router.
B00AOA9BL0,14,19,Works well by trial and error.
B00AOA9BL0,14,20,I don't have this trouble with Netflix or other video streaming, so I know it's not my wireless connection.
B00AOA9BL0,14,21,Of all the streaming video apps I use this is the worst.
B00AOA9BL0,14,22,Just watch on your tv.
B00AOA9BL0,14,23,Guess it is the Netflix app for those shows.)
B00AOA9BL0,14,24,Amazon app store, any suggestions or workarounds?
B00AOA9BL0,15,0,No HDMI out...boo!
B00AOA9BL0,15,1,Works Okay.
B00AOA9BL0,15,2,Can only see some of the channels.
B00AOA9BL0,15,3,Is it me or has anyone else had this problem.
B00AOA9BL0,15,4,It's channel selection is almost useless and I cannot get picture,I only get sound when I can get a channel.
B00AOA9BL0,15,5,It seems to be working now.

B00AOA9BL0,15,8,Huh? I thought that this is cable TV to go.

B00AOA9BL0,15,11,The only source for many shows.
B00AOA9BL0,15,12,Works well with Comcast although one has to be careful when scrolling thru the channel guide or you will be accidentally changing channels.Great having channel guide, DVR manager, Movies and more on one screen.
