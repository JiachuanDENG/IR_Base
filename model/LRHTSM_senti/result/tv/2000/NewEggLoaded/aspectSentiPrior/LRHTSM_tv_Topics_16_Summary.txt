B0074FGLUM,0,0,4. The best picture size setting is screen fit.
B0074FGLUM,0,1,It's actual size is just 31".
B0074FGLUM,0,2,Great picture, great sound, great value.
B0074FGLUM,0,3,Great picture, easy to use, looks great on my tv mount.
B0074FGLUM,0,4,If you are to use it as desktop monitor occasionally, less than 20% of the time, as a multi-media monitor in your living room, or for occasional browsing, then it may just be fine but otherwise as a full time desktop monitor it is not just good enough.
B0074FGLUM,0,5,But a few days later, it just wouldn't quit power recyling itself -- screen goes blank, power light goes off, then it tries to power on again, you see the splash screen but never get a picture, shuts off and tries to power on again with no success.
B0074FGLUM,0,6,People with dark skins look greenish, people with fair skins look purple...and by the way I am not watching Zombie movies.I thought in returning the set but I already had a mounting wall in place, paid for the mounting job etc  it is an annoyance to return the set and have to wait to buy another one.In a rebellious act of desperation I dared to change Gordon's magical settings with not better results to report, land of the dead with people looking like zombies, green and purple skins.I am not so sure if I had too great of an expectation based on the good reviews but for me this TV does not deserve more than three starts.
B0074FGLUM,0,7,Even with the AVSforum picture settings, the color is off and objects appear blurred around the edges.
B0074FGLUM,0,8,Its a great picture and color for an HD set but not for a smart set, I would not purchase this item if I had known what it could not do.
B0074FGLUM,0,9,We might need a good touch based remote for moving your cursor.Otherwise its good for picture quality and value for money.
B0074FGLUM,0,10,tv picture quality is fantastic, which is to be expected from a samsung set.
B0074FGLUM,0,11,ok,  just ESPN)My old Samsung Plasma TV looks much clear and the Vizio TV that we have in another room both had much more vivid images.
B0074FGLUM,0,12,3 months later I have dead pixels and dark lines across the screen.
B0074FGLUM,0,13,Much thinner and lighter (12 lbs) than old TV sets, though not as thin as newest sets.
B0074FGLUM,0,14,I had previously owned two Samsung lcd TV's and was very happy with them - great picture.
B0074FGLUM,0,15,The picture is not as good as plasma in terms of clarity when looking a people's faces, but it is a fine picture.
B0074FGLUM,0,16,I needed this T.V for a small media room to watch sports, action movies, explosions, people fighting, man stuff.Well I got the T.V and just opening the Box and connecting it to the source like too many have mentioned this TV does not win any awards.
B0074FGLUM,0,17,May not work as well as a PC monitor for Mac as you would expect!
B0074FGLUM,0,18,Picture quality is very good.
B0074FGLUM,0,19,Samsung Model UN40EH5300F 40" Led TV.
B0074FGLUM,0,20,I looked at it, and noticed that the screen had been shattered at the top and had spread across half the screen.
B0074FGLUM,0,21,i got it set up and then started watching tv, then i started to notice something the sound comes and goes.
B0074FGLUM,0,22,I purchased the Samsung not only because of the picture quality but the good reputation in the name.
B0074FGLUM,0,23,Other than this picture quality and everything is very good.
B0074FGLUM,0,24,In first set i got dead pixels which were only visible from 6 to 10 inch of the screen, ofcourse no one watch from that closer but hey i paid for perfect condition brand new TV then why should i take one with defect.
B0074FGLUM,1,0,I purchased this TV at Wal-Mart at a very good price.
B0074FGLUM,1,1,At its discounted price, this TV was a good deal.
B0074FGLUM,1,2,I purchased the Samsung not only because of the picture quality but the good reputation in the name.
B0074FGLUM,1,3,It's not a very good tv.
B0074FGLUM,1,4,I bought this TV due to Samsung's good reputation.
B0074FGLUM,1,5,Price Good, TV Not so SMART.
B0074FGLUM,1,6,I had previously owned two Samsung lcd TV's and was very happy with them - great picture.
B0074FGLUM,1,7,I had it for 2 months and it was great.
B0074FGLUM,1,8,NOt the BEST TV I've every bought, but decent for the price.
B0074FGLUM,1,9,Bargain Samsung HDTV not such a great buy.
B0074FGLUM,1,10,Great visual tho.
B0074FGLUM,1,11,THe picture is very good.
B0074FGLUM,1,12,TV picture quality was pretty good.
B0074FGLUM,1,13,The main reason for buying this model was because the price and size was right for me and it was a "Smart" TV.
B0074FGLUM,1,14,Good picture- could be great, but this is NOT a smart TV! First of all, this review is not about Amazon- we LOVE Amazon Prime!
B0074FGLUM,1,15,Needless to say I will never purchase a Samsung item again.
B0074FGLUM,1,16,not bad for the price.
B0074FGLUM,1,17,Don't buy a Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,1,18,Great picture, great sound, great value.
B0074FGLUM,1,19,Then I got my 32" inches Samsung, I was so excited because according to the reviews this is one of the best 32" LED HDTV that you can get around $380.
B0074FGLUM,1,20,Next time I'll buy this in a store.
B0074FGLUM,1,21,AND SAMSUNG IS SUPPOSE TO BE LIKE THE BEST BRAND EVER.
B0074FGLUM,1,22,I researched and saw that Samsung was the bomb.com
B0074FGLUM,1,23,I regret the purchase.
B0074FGLUM,1,24,samsung tv  UN40EH55300 40- inch 1080 60Hz HDtv.
B0074FGLUM,2,0,THe picture is very good.
B0074FGLUM,2,1,As a TV it works well and sounds good.
B0074FGLUM,2,2,The speakers on this tv aren't good at all.
B0074FGLUM,2,3,It was and is great.
B0074FGLUM,2,4,The picture is good, so as a tv, this is more than acceptable.
B0074FGLUM,2,5,good as a tv, but not really smart.
B0074FGLUM,2,6,Great picture, great sound, great value.
B0074FGLUM,2,7,The picture, sound, build quality, and remote are all what I expected.
B0074FGLUM,2,8,It's a good TV with some issues.
B0074FGLUM,2,9,great picture and sound.
B0074FGLUM,2,10,Excellent picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,2,11,The TV is just overrated, not as good as I expected.
B0074FGLUM,2,12,The wall behind the TV hears it good.
B0074FGLUM,2,13,Sound is amazing, the 3D effect is really nice and I found myself looking around as the surround parts happened as the sounds seemed to be really coming from the sides.
B0074FGLUM,2,14,That's a bug.Another issue is connections to an external speaker.
B0074FGLUM,2,15,Picture quality is no better than much cheaper competitors.
B0074FGLUM,2,16,Picture quality is very good.
B0074FGLUM,2,17,This tv is also the one that you have to be directly in front of and a certain distance away to get the best of its poor clarity.I will say all the features of the "smart" part of the tv are good - but if you have a bad picture - the smart part is of little value.
B0074FGLUM,2,18,Great picture, easy to use, looks great on my tv mount.
B0074FGLUM,2,19,I have to buy my own speakers to connect them to the TV to hear it clear.
B0074FGLUM,2,20,So I thought this Samsung Smart tv would be a great buy.
B0074FGLUM,2,21,I purchased the Samsung not only because of the picture quality but the good reputation in the name.
B0074FGLUM,2,22,I have a 32 inch same brand ,no noise works good.
B0074FGLUM,2,23,I am very very very disappointed with the picture.
B0074FGLUM,2,24,Other than this picture quality and everything is very good.
B0074FGLUM,3,0,Great visual tho.
B0074FGLUM,3,1,I wanted to like this TV, as we've had great success with Samsung in the past.
B0074FGLUM,3,2,I called Samsung and they outsource their tech support to somewhere in China.
B0074FGLUM,3,3,I researched and saw that Samsung was the bomb.com
B0074FGLUM,3,4,The TV works good.
B0074FGLUM,3,5,Poor customer service.
B0074FGLUM,3,6,ok let me say this came in fast and also was packaged great.
B0074FGLUM,3,7,Been getting customer support for over 3 hours and counting to get set up...
B0074FGLUM,3,8,Samsung does not support this feature, even with TV's purchased thru Amazon.
B0074FGLUM,3,9,no amazon still.
B0074FGLUM,3,10,No HBO GO, No Amazon.
B0074FGLUM,3,11,Very poor customer support lines.
B0074FGLUM,3,12,Called Costco concierge services and they told me they get this complaint all the time and she has a Samsung herself with the same problem.
B0074FGLUM,3,13,I had it for 2 months and it was great.
B0074FGLUM,3,14,Actually I may also call Costco tech suppport as that comes free too...
B0074FGLUM,3,15,Called Samsung tech support, got the run-around, asked for a supervisor, got sent to an answering machine.
B0074FGLUM,3,16,Customer support is nonexistent.
B0074FGLUM,3,17,No help on a call to Samsung but I can live with it.
B0074FGLUM,3,18,I did not receive my "free samsung keyboard" which was part of the purchase deal; I also had to return the tv for a swap-poor quality control by samsung.
B0074FGLUM,3,19,Samsung denies they have a problem, that it's your problem, service provider, wireless firewall, etc., etc.
B0074FGLUM,3,20,I have been unable to get Samsung customer support or a good manual.
B0074FGLUM,3,21,I've only had this thing for 2 months) so we are going to send tech support out to you in 2 wks.
B0074FGLUM,3,22,The guy told me next time go with Toshiba.
B0074FGLUM,3,23,When I first bought this tv, the system was down for a week (I called and the guy told me this).
B0074FGLUM,3,24,As i said in review heading TV is good if you are lucky enough to have one without these quality control related Samsung issues otherwise all the very best with Samsung warranty support.I went through this lengthy cycle/hassle as i just crossed the amazon return period before i discovered first issue in my TV and i ended up going through warranty.Samsung - If you are reading this, please improve your quality control methods before delivering the products to consumer.
B0074FGLUM,4,0,The picture on this TV is great.
B0074FGLUM,4,1,Great picture, great sound, great value.
B0074FGLUM,4,2,Picture quality is very good.

B0074FGLUM,4,4,TV picture quality was pretty good.
B0074FGLUM,4,5,Excellent picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,4,6,The color is off, no vivid color and dull.
B0074FGLUM,4,7,Nice picture.
B0074FGLUM,4,8,I love the quality of the color and the clarity.
B0074FGLUM,4,9,Picture dims.
B0074FGLUM,4,10,Not as good.
B0074FGLUM,4,11,Great.....When it works.....
B0074FGLUM,4,12,At first the picture is sharp and bright, but after awhile it fades to a fairly dim visage, hard to see .
B0074FGLUM,4,13,The TV itself is great.
B0074FGLUM,4,14,Its a great picture and color for an HD set but not for a smart set, I would not purchase this item if I had known what it could not do.
B0074FGLUM,4,15,great picture and sound.
B0074FGLUM,4,16,I can't tell if the tv is great or not.
B0074FGLUM,4,17,When I first set this TV up I was very impressed.
B0074FGLUM,4,18,Other than this picture quality and everything is very good.
B0074FGLUM,4,19,Image not as clear or vivid as I expected even after Gordon's Magical set up.
B0074FGLUM,4,20,Pros--Samsung has one of the best displays crisp clean clean and colorful, beautiful.-Adding
B0074FGLUM,4,21,The picture quality is great, no complaints there.
B0074FGLUM,4,22,I wanted to like this TV, as we've had great success with Samsung in the past.
B0074FGLUM,4,23,We might need a good touch based remote for moving your cursor.Otherwise its good for picture quality and value for money.
B0074FGLUM,4,24,I set the TV sound to "clear dialogue" mode which did absolutely nothing.I gave 2 stars because the picture quality is satisfactory.Don't buy a smart TV from Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,5,0,It was and is great.
B0074FGLUM,5,1,Picture quality is very good.
B0074FGLUM,5,2,If I had it to do over again I would buy  LG.
B0074FGLUM,5,3,The picture quality is great, but TV cannot do what is advertised.
B0074FGLUM,5,4,Pictures great, but product is not as advertised.
B0074FGLUM,5,5,So I thought this Samsung Smart tv would be a great buy.
B0074FGLUM,5,6,Samsung makes a great product, but Samsung software just can't compete.
B0074FGLUM,5,7,Excellent picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,5,8,I have a Samsung washer and dryer.
B0074FGLUM,5,9,good TV but not very smart.
B0074FGLUM,5,10,Picture is just as good, more reliable, less money.Good luck.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bought
B0074FGLUM,5,11,Samsung LED TV review - UN40EH5300 40 inch.
B0074FGLUM,5,12,Come on Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,5,13,Don't buy it.
B0074FGLUM,5,14,Samsung 32 inch LED Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,5,15,I am very very very disappointed with the picture.
B0074FGLUM,5,16,Not real happy with the quality of this product...
B0074FGLUM,5,17,Great looking TV, read about the software and WiFI.
B0074FGLUM,5,18,I love Samsung but this T-V. is not 120 Hz .
B0074FGLUM,5,19,Picture quality is no better than much cheaper competitors.
B0074FGLUM,5,20,The is allot to see for the money.
B0074FGLUM,5,21,My Samsung smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,5,22,Disappointment Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,5,23,Too many things to do to use the features.
B0074FGLUM,5,24,Great picture, great sound, great value.
B0074FGLUM,6,0,You can watch movies with netflix without any prob.
B0074FGLUM,6,1,not very smart.
B0074FGLUM,6,2,NO YOUTUBE APP.
B0074FGLUM,6,3,Samsung smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,6,4,The TV works good.
B0074FGLUM,6,5,To use the Smart TV features is very hard.
B0074FGLUM,6,6,NOT as "smart" as liked it to be.
B0074FGLUM,6,7,Samsung Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,6,8,Had their engineers just overlooked this important feature?
B0074FGLUM,6,9,Right now I would be happy if they youtube app worked.
B0074FGLUM,6,10,Internet browsing for watching video or anything else is awful.
B0074FGLUM,6,11,I wanted to like this TV, as we've had great success with Samsung in the past.
B0074FGLUM,6,12,The picture on this TV is great.
B0074FGLUM,6,13,Not as good.
B0074FGLUM,6,14,If you are willing to work through that, however, the experience of using the TV is very good.
B0074FGLUM,6,15,We use it mostly for watching Netflix and also web browsing.
B0074FGLUM,6,16,I bought this TV due to Samsung's good reputation.
B0074FGLUM,6,17,Seamless transfer from a pc to Samsung Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,6,18,Samsung Apps absolutely embarrassing.
B0074FGLUM,6,19,A lot of the apps don't function well.
B0074FGLUM,6,20,Unfortunately, none of the apps would work properly, as the Smart Hub would connect.
B0074FGLUM,6,21,You can watch videos continiously using iphone and share the videos
B0074FGLUM,6,22,Smart TV isn't.
B0074FGLUM,6,23,It's not a very good tv.
B0074FGLUM,6,24,Through their "Smart Hub" feature, Samsung claims to have gathered together all the apps and functionality you'd need for a great multimedia experience, but they're lying.
B0074FGLUM,7,0,TV Did not connect to my wireless.
B0074FGLUM,7,1,This TV however has missed out on 16 Pin S-video input.
B0074FGLUM,7,2,Instead one can go for a HD tv and all these can be streamed fron DVD players or any other game devices.
B0074FGLUM,7,3,The HDMI connection with only work with Samsung DVD players, Samsung computers, etc. and will not work for devices using the HDMI cable everyone else in the industry uses.
B0074FGLUM,7,4,The picture on cable was excellent but then I tried switching to Netflix and noticed a significant decrease in picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,7,5,When we first set this TV up, it worked fine.
B0074FGLUM,7,6,TV picture quality was pretty good.
B0074FGLUM,7,7,It doubled as an amazing gaming computer monitor.
B0074FGLUM,7,8,This TV is great at displaying TV shows, movies, and all that.
B0074FGLUM,7,9,It had perfect synergy with our Samsung Blu-Ray player where all the settings we automatically set and the picture was perfect when watching Blu-Rays.
B0074FGLUM,7,10,Or, I got a signal booster to make it work.
B0074FGLUM,7,11,The TV itself is nice however, I keep getting a notice that despite the TV stating I am connected to my wireless network I cannot actually connect or use any of the smart TV options.
B0074FGLUM,7,12,Great picture, great sound, great value.
B0074FGLUM,7,13,Sometime it connects just fine, sometimes it will not connect at all,  and then sometimes it connects with no sound!
B0074FGLUM,7,14,It has its good and bad days.Pros:* good picture quality* I love being able to plug an external hard drive or thumb drive in and play a movie.*
B0074FGLUM,7,15,a good resolution when I plugged the BluRay to it though.
B0074FGLUM,7,16,The picture on this TV is great.
B0074FGLUM,7,17,However, Picture quality very good and has a great set of features...IT DOES NOT SUPPORT .MOV VIDEO FORMATS!!!
B0074FGLUM,7,18,The only way I was able to get it work was to connect it directly to the LAN.
B0074FGLUM,7,19,so if you are buying it hoping to connect to wireless dont.
B0074FGLUM,7,20,And using the remote to access functionality and type is just clunky.Most TVs have HDMI ports.
B0074FGLUM,7,21,Plus, of course, they know their sets don't have the best software and wireless connectivity.
B0074FGLUM,7,22,Good TV with a very poor wireless capability.
B0074FGLUM,7,23,Samsung's SMART software is the dealbreaker in the market which has it all including AllShare which allows all format of files to be played including .MKVs, .AVIs, .WMVs, .MPGs, .VOBs, .FLVs etc and also plays videos, pictures from all kinds of input hardware like USB Flash Drive, HDMI and also wirelessly from the Windows/Mac laptops.
B0074FGLUM,7,24,There is a HD Zoom button that is very easy to bump accidentally, so your TV is on a zoom setting forever until you push it again.
B0074FGLUM,8,0,Smashed screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,1,The tv screen is already showing issues.
B0074FGLUM,8,2,I looked at it, and noticed that the screen had been shattered at the top and had spread across half the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,3,The TV screen is totally shattered!!!!!
B0074FGLUM,8,4,Sometimes the screen goes completely black.
B0074FGLUM,8,5,3 months later I have dead pixels and dark lines across the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,6,I am so upset I may make mistakes but my television screen is damaged, there are lines across the screen so that I cannot see any thing clearly and then it went blank.
B0074FGLUM,8,7,We liked the large screen and the clear image.
B0074FGLUM,8,8,In first set i got dead pixels which were only visible from 6 to 10 inch of the screen, ofcourse no one watch from that closer but hey i paid for perfect condition brand new TV then why should i take one with defect.
B0074FGLUM,8,9,If you try to watch a show like Archer on this in 1080p, you can see a ghosted image of the black outlines of the characters.
B0074FGLUM,8,10,I was extremely disappointed when I found out that the TV screen is totally shattered after I turned it on.
B0074FGLUM,8,11,reason of trying with all colors is sometimes these dead pixels only visible on specific color background2.
B0074FGLUM,8,12,I experienced the "ghosting" on my black screen that some people have complained about and there was also on pixel out.
B0074FGLUM,8,13,Each tv came with its own quirks like, dark corners, and v shaped dark spots in the center of the backlight.If youre buying this for a parent or someone to just watch television on and they dont care about all this?
B0074FGLUM,8,14,One single white dot in the middle of your screen gets really annoying.
B0074FGLUM,8,15,There was also a light coming from behind the TV, maybe through the vents, which was obnoxious in low lighting.All in all, this was better than the tv I had, but not nearly the tv I wanted.
B0074FGLUM,8,16,I sit 9 feet from the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,17,Its terribly noticeable.
B0074FGLUM,8,18,After warrenty repair still dead pixels were there as instead of changing screen they replace the complete motherboard/circuit of the TV.
B0074FGLUM,8,19,I then pulled the actual tv from the box and set it on the stand.
B0074FGLUM,8,20,The issue is the pointer part doesn't work when you get it.
B0074FGLUM,8,21,So much for me and my friends wanting to watch a movie.
B0074FGLUM,8,22,The pointer will appear, but you can't make it move.
B0074FGLUM,8,23,WRONG I can see pixels and the picture becomes distorted if I am watching anything faster than a turtle.
B0074FGLUM,8,24,Best way to check dead pixel is to connect laptop, open browser in fullscreen by pressing F11 and then notice pixels closely throughout the screen by having background color as BLACK, WHITE, RED, BLUE and GREEN.
B0074FGLUM,9,0,Samsung UN46E5300.
B0074FGLUM,9,1,gave out after 1.5 years!
B0074FGLUM,9,2,Don't purchase this TV.
B0074FGLUM,9,3,But we will think twice before buying anything from amazon.
B0074FGLUM,9,4,Will never buy a TV from Amazon.
B0074FGLUM,9,5,Bargain Samsung HDTV not such a great buy.
B0074FGLUM,9,6,My sister purchased the 6500 model and is more miserable than I am so I chalk it up to Samsung putting out junk.
B0074FGLUM,9,7,Purchased during holiday season so was less expensive than most times of the year.
B0074FGLUM,9,8,Needless to say I will never purchase a Samsung item again.
B0074FGLUM,9,9,First time I've said that about a Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,9,10,I purchased this TV and used it for about a month before returning it.
B0074FGLUM,9,11,Will not purchase from Samsung again.
B0074FGLUM,9,12,Can this not be fixed by Samsung?
B0074FGLUM,9,13,I had no problem returning it to Amazon, and I got another Samsung (more expensive) smart TV from Amazon.
B0074FGLUM,9,14,Didnt expect the product to breakdown within 1 month of purchase.
B0074FGLUM,9,15,I have 5year old Samsung that has made me fan of Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,9,16,Disappointed with Samsung and it will color my future Samsung purchases.
B0074FGLUM,9,17,I am really mad at myself for buying this and will never buy another smart tv.
B0074FGLUM,9,18,Wish I hadn't bought it.
B0074FGLUM,9,19,I purchased the Samsung not only because of the picture quality but the good reputation in the name.
B0074FGLUM,9,20,I purchased this TV at Wal-Mart at a very good price.
B0074FGLUM,9,21,Samsung never again!
B0074FGLUM,9,22,Samsung Model UN40EH5300F 40" Led TV.
B0074FGLUM,9,23,I won't buy another Samsung TV.
B0074FGLUM,9,24,No problems with this tv after having it near a month.
B0074FGLUM,10,0,The sound on this TV was unbearable!
B0074FGLUM,10,1,The sound is so horrible I am contemplating getting a sound bar.
B0074FGLUM,10,2,Sound quality is poor.
B0074FGLUM,10,3,Problems with Speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,4,Horrible Sound.
B0074FGLUM,10,5,The only way to use a headphone is the Audio out jack on the back of the TV.
B0074FGLUM,10,6,But we have had a problem with the sound on both monitors.
B0074FGLUM,10,7,i got it set up and then started watching tv, then i started to notice something the sound comes and goes.
B0074FGLUM,10,8,Granted, I could get a sound bar, but shouldn't have to.[b]non
B0074FGLUM,10,9,It is hard to plug in, especially if you have the TV wall mounted.
B0074FGLUM,10,10,Did I mention 1950's tv??I gave it two stars because the picture and sound are adequate (sound is NOT good).
B0074FGLUM,10,11,The only way I'd consider keeping it was if I had a sound bar.
B0074FGLUM,10,12,I've also had issues with the sound cutting out consistently.
B0074FGLUM,10,13,The picture, sound, build quality, and remote are all what I expected.
B0074FGLUM,10,14,I had to turn up the volume so loud to hear the dialogue when a show was on and then turn it way down when scenes involving music or background noise came on because it would be way too loud.
B0074FGLUM,10,15,Picture and sound are fine, but the actual usage of this is a horrible experience.
B0074FGLUM,10,16,However, the speakers are on the back and are muffled by the cabinet meaning that for some shows, we have the volume a 100.
B0074FGLUM,10,17,The speakers on this tv aren't good at all.
B0074FGLUM,10,18,If you plan on watching TV at 7:00, you better start turning it on at 6:00.
B0074FGLUM,10,19,I have to buy my own speakers to connect them to the TV to hear it clear.
B0074FGLUM,10,20,The picture quality is great, no complaints there.
B0074FGLUM,10,21,40 years owning tv's and I have never had the cable connector snap off of a tv set and yes 3 tv's in my home are on a pivotal wall mount.
B0074FGLUM,10,22,The audio will also play through both the headphones and speakers unless you use the mute button, or shutoff the external speakers (which is buried deep in the settings)Now here is the mind numbing part...the volume control does not work with the audio out/Headphones, and if you use the mute button, a big icon moves across the screen showing the mute is on, and YOU CANNOT SHUT IT OFF!I realize a lot of people do not use headphones with a TV, but if you do, do not buy this TV unless you have an external receiver that supports headphones.Smart TV:Works ok, but has some annoying issues.
B0074FGLUM,10,23,In our case, it ends up costing twice as much as buying new external speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,24,It also sometimes loses picture and will be just audio while watching netflix.
B0074FGLUM,11,0,Poor Customer service- inferior materials.
B0074FGLUM,11,1,Nothing happened so I called again.
B0074FGLUM,11,2,They're probably grumpy because they're fielding so many calls on this very issue.
B0074FGLUM,11,3,I know the TV needed a hardware fix and Samsung should've sent someone out to service it, but I could not get any help from their Customer Service.
B0074FGLUM,11,4,Called Costco concierge services and they told me they get this complaint all the time and she has a Samsung herself with the same problem.
B0074FGLUM,11,5,They told me that they were backed up and it may take up to five more days.
B0074FGLUM,11,6,I'm going to give it a few more days, but I may end up returning it.
B0074FGLUM,11,7,I had one repair through the Samsung warranty and 2 days later it started again.
B0074FGLUM,11,8,Within 2 months of having this TV I had to call for a replacement.
B0074FGLUM,11,9,Now we began the odyssey of trying to deal with customer service and get this fixed.
B0074FGLUM,11,10,I already had to call customer service (took forever) for a new remote because the first just stopped working, now I'm forced to call them again for this issue, who has time for that??
B0074FGLUM,11,11,I don't know if I should just see if I can get amazon to take it back or go through with the return and repair.
B0074FGLUM,11,12,Samsung customer support said this tv shouldnt do that, and offered to send a tech out, but i just had it replaced twice.
B0074FGLUM,11,13,Customer service told that I need a box to get 1080 after I complained.
B0074FGLUM,11,14,Called about repair or warranty and it isn't covered and will cost $290.00
B0074FGLUM,11,15,I have talked to Samsung twice and they have been very polite but have not solved the problem.
B0074FGLUM,11,16,Called Samsung tech support, got the run-around, asked for a supervisor, got sent to an answering machine.
B0074FGLUM,11,17,No issues as i can again send it for repair under warranty :( and wait for 2 to 3 weeks to receive the repaired TV back with issue still exists.
B0074FGLUM,11,18,And the customer service is so bad, there's really no point in calling them.
B0074FGLUM,11,19,Samsung denies they have a problem, that it's your problem, service provider, wireless firewall, etc., etc.
B0074FGLUM,11,20,An hour call into Samsung tech support, who was very accommodating, proved completely fruitless, as they wound up suggesting getting someone out there to service the unit.
B0074FGLUM,11,21,to repair.
B0074FGLUM,11,22,I've opened an Service Request with Samsung since the TV comes with a 12 month parts and labor warranty.
B0074FGLUM,11,23,This wouldn't be so awful, if the technicians were more customer oriented, and arrived on time.
B0074FGLUM,11,24,Come on Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,12,0,Other than this picture quality and everything is very good.
B0074FGLUM,12,1,The picture on this TV was just not up to par.
B0074FGLUM,12,2,great picture and sound.
B0074FGLUM,12,3,Poor quality.
B0074FGLUM,12,4,the tv is a tv... good picture and decent sound.
B0074FGLUM,12,5,not a great image.
B0074FGLUM,12,6,tv picture quality is fantastic, which is to be expected from a samsung set.
B0074FGLUM,12,7,The picture quality is great, no complaints there.
B0074FGLUM,12,8,The TV is fine - good picture, etc.
B0074FGLUM,12,9,Much thinner and lighter (12 lbs) than old TV sets, though not as thin as newest sets.
B0074FGLUM,12,10,Not a good as the reviews said.
B0074FGLUM,12,11,I bought a 1080 p TV and was unhappy withe picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,12,12,PICTURE QUALITY IS LACKING.
B0074FGLUM,12,13,Not impressed, even after adjusting to suggested calibration settings.
B0074FGLUM,12,14,The quality of the picture is terrible.
B0074FGLUM,12,15,NOT A GOOD TV.
B0074FGLUM,12,16,Its a great picture and color for an HD set but not for a smart set, I would not purchase this item if I had known what it could not do.
B0074FGLUM,12,17,However, Picture quality very good and has a great set of features...IT DOES NOT SUPPORT .MOV VIDEO FORMATS!!!
B0074FGLUM,12,18,Even with the AVSforum picture settings, the color is off and objects appear blurred around the edges.
B0074FGLUM,12,19,I wish the "Smart" part of it was as good as the picture.
B0074FGLUM,12,20,I can't say enough good things about samsung as a TV.
B0074FGLUM,12,21,There is no doubt on Clarity, quality of picture is good.4.
B0074FGLUM,12,22,The picture is better using manual adjustments, but you can't save the settings.
B0074FGLUM,12,23,The HD is good on this tv.
B0074FGLUM,12,24,Well let me tell you the picture is horrible.
B0074FGLUM,13,0,DO NOT buy this product.
B0074FGLUM,13,1,Don't buy.
B0074FGLUM,13,2,Okay TV... but buyer beware.
B0074FGLUM,13,3,However, I would still rate the product as inferior.
B0074FGLUM,13,4,The refresh rate for this TV is 60hz I was told by a crutchfield salesman that a 120hz rate is better so I sent this TV back and am trying a 120hz refresh rated TV.
B0074FGLUM,13,5,I read the reviews here and saw others had the same problem, followed advice, looked up fixes in other forums, did all the troubleshooting recommended by Samsung I could do before contacting them, but none of it solved the problem.
B0074FGLUM,13,6,Buyer beware!
B0074FGLUM,13,7,Buyer Beware.
B0074FGLUM,13,8,I recently purchased this TV based on the reviews it got on Amazons site.
B0074FGLUM,13,9,The product I recieved is missing the 8 tiny screws that render it useless unless I buy a wall stand (not an option as I rent and they want no screws in the walls)  So incredibly disappointed that I spent a small fortune on a product I can't use.
B0074FGLUM,13,10,If you like ballet and opera you will like paraclassics.Shame on Samsung...time for a Samsung update in support of Consumers rights!
B0074FGLUM,13,11,The remote could be better.
B0074FGLUM,13,12,I read the reviews of this T.V. and also did some research out of Amazon before I made a buying decision.
B0074FGLUM,13,13,If you're thinking of buying this as a gift, I would also strongly suggest looking elsewhere.
B0074FGLUM,13,14,If I were rating this TV solely for the picture quality, I'd give it five stars, but I could not get the Smart Hub feature on the Samsung UN40EH5300 40-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV to work.
B0074FGLUM,13,15,A quick google search revealed that this is a known issue with Samsung products.
B0074FGLUM,13,16,Will not purchase from Samsung again.
B0074FGLUM,13,17,If it were my PC, I'd be buying RAM for it.
B0074FGLUM,13,18,The standard remote that comes with the TV makes it very difficult to navigate and type, which is basically Samsung's way of saying "You need to buy our keyboard to fully utilize our product."It
B0074FGLUM,13,19,I think that the "Smart" part of the product is seriously lacking, it all feels like a failed beta version.
B0074FGLUM,13,20,pros and cons.
B0074FGLUM,13,21,only it will work.
B0074FGLUM,13,22,My advice is to buy a cheaper TV and a Chromecast; you'll get the same thing as with this TV . . .
B0074FGLUM,13,23,PICTURE QUALITY IS LACKING.
B0074FGLUM,13,24,First time I've said that about a Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,14,0,Sometimes it will launch apps, other times it wont.
B0074FGLUM,14,1,I am only using the Netflix app with this TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,2,It works this time.
B0074FGLUM,14,3,Sometimes it even works.
B0074FGLUM,14,4,not Smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,5,not so smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,6,only it will work.
B0074FGLUM,14,7,That didn't work either.
B0074FGLUM,14,8,The problem is that I want to watch streaming video that has no app (rifftrax).
B0074FGLUM,14,9,The apps (Netflix & Youtube) seem to work fine.
B0074FGLUM,14,10,But when it came to setting it up for Smart apps (like Netflix), it would not work.
B0074FGLUM,14,11,It always tries to update, even after it has just been updated.
B0074FGLUM,14,12,Smart TV isn't so smart anymore.
B0074FGLUM,14,13,Well, it has never worked right.
B0074FGLUM,14,14,most of the times it does updating, not a good smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,15,I bought this tv thinking that I can stream Netflix, YouTube, and other apps but I am able to stream only Netflix and it also doesn't work many times.
B0074FGLUM,14,16,But this review is about the smart part of it.Most of the apps works well, especially the netflix.Youtube app also works well, but lacks the movies interface that is available on the PCs.
B0074FGLUM,14,17,There are apps for amazon prime and netflix (haven't tried the netflix yet, don't really use it).
B0074FGLUM,14,18,Great until Netflix and Amazon streaming stopped working.
B0074FGLUM,14,19,Other times it will just update itself for a while.
B0074FGLUM,14,20,Unfortunately, YouTube & Google aren't doing the work to make their YouTube app compliant with these rulings.
B0074FGLUM,14,21,It is not smart enough yet.
B0074FGLUM,14,22,YouTube never works and browser never works.
B0074FGLUM,14,23,The smart hub tends to freeze or don't load up the apps.
B0074FGLUM,14,24,At first Netflix would fire up with no problems.
B0074FGLUM,15,0,Remote is still old traditional remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,1,This means another remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,2,The HDMI connection with only work with Samsung DVD players, Samsung computers, etc. and will not work for devices using the HDMI cable everyone else in the industry uses.
B0074FGLUM,15,3,It works this time.
B0074FGLUM,15,4,Very hard to type using this remote.I like the LG TV remotes.
B0074FGLUM,15,5,Turning off and on a few times seemed to get it back to normal.
B0074FGLUM,15,6,universal remote [/b]Whose idea was it to include a complicated remote but not give it features for cable or a DVD player?
B0074FGLUM,15,7,This is endless unless you unplug it, the power button on remote or TV have no capability to keep it off.
B0074FGLUM,15,8,If Mac went to sleep, I would have to reboot it for it to connect to the TV.
B0074FGLUM,15,9,May not work as well as a PC monitor for Mac as you would expect!
B0074FGLUM,15,10,You have to use the remote to peck out each word and command like you do on say NetFlex or Comcast.
B0074FGLUM,15,11,The connectivity to this TV is quite poor.
B0074FGLUM,15,12,Turn on the TV.2.
B0074FGLUM,15,13,Sometimes it even works.
B0074FGLUM,15,14,The issue is the pointer part doesn't work when you get it.
B0074FGLUM,15,15,But a few days later, it just wouldn't quit power recyling itself -- screen goes blank, power light goes off, then it tries to power on again, you see the splash screen but never get a picture, shuts off and tries to power on again with no success.
B0074FGLUM,15,16,Hit the Smart TV button.3.
B0074FGLUM,15,17,The only way out of it is to exit the Smart TV interface and re-enter it with many remote control operations to get back to where you are.
B0074FGLUM,15,18,Get a dumb TV and connect through the HDMI port.
B0074FGLUM,15,19,Turn off the TV, start over.
B0074FGLUM,15,20,First go around with smart tv at the home.Issues: devices will not allow for Comcast channel changing.
B0074FGLUM,15,21,And using the remote to access functionality and type is just clunky.Most TVs have HDMI ports.
B0074FGLUM,15,22,Now it could be something with my HDMI cable or adapter that is messing up the handshake, so I cannot say for sure if it was also the problem with this HDTV.
B0074FGLUM,15,23,popups stay up for about 15 seconds, if you cant find the sammy remote to hit cancel.
B0074FGLUM,15,24,Give the nature of my issues which were largely intermittent, someone would likely be given my TV and a ticket that says "Network Connection Problems", hook it up to a network and turn youtube on for 30 seconds and send it back saying everything works fine now.
B00BCGROJG,0,0,This is the brightest and clearest viewing screen that you will ever view.
B00BCGROJG,0,1,It looks great In our conference room.
B00BCGROJG,0,2,Good picture.
B00BCGROJG,0,3,Great TV - Very Thin - Good Value.
B00BCGROJG,0,4,I mean if you want a good TV with a nice screen get it!!!
B00BCGROJG,0,5,I think because it's 3D they gave it a nice strong black light and 10 is about where normal viewing should be.
B00BCGROJG,0,6,There are many, many settings that affect brightness, many settings that affect color balance, etc... so even the last few settings will make a big difference to how the picture looks.
B00BCGROJG,0,7,Great picture.
B00BCGROJG,0,8,The screen size is perfect for someone that likes movies.
B00BCGROJG,0,9,I think I need to tweek the picture on it a little more but it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,0,10,Do I think the picture quality is as good as the PANNY?
B00BCGROJG,0,11,Its light like a picture frame, kinda crazy how light it is.
B00BCGROJG,0,12,Also, the side viewing angle is not great as screen colors become significantly washed out.
B00BCGROJG,0,13,But if you sit about 45 degrees, the color setting is out of wack.
B00BCGROJG,0,14,In our living room there are off angle seats and you can tell the blacks are not as dark off angle.
B00BCGROJG,0,15,Great bright picture, this tv is in our family room and the tv has no problem in a room with light.2.
B00BCGROJG,0,16,great picture, lousy gimmicks.
B00BCGROJG,0,17,But it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,0,18,Great brights but the darks are not all that :o( I love this TV BUT my only problem is with dark scenes.
B00BCGROJG,0,19,The picture is still good, just not as great as when you are in front of it.
B00BCGROJG,0,20,Good tv. a lot of good things about this tv.
B00BCGROJG,0,21,Great flat screen TV.
B00BCGROJG,0,22,It is a really great tv, but the quality is virtually the same when seeing both side by side.
B00BCGROJG,0,23,Great Picture But..... Great picture with amazing contrast and color "pop" but.....the viewing angles are not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,0,24,3 out of 3 screens had a dead pixel.
B00BCGROJG,1,0,Great tv at a great price.
B00BCGROJG,1,1,Great tv
B00BCGROJG,1,2,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,3,Its good for the price.
B00BCGROJG,1,4,Everyone would commend on how great the picture is.
B00BCGROJG,1,5,The best tv for the price.
B00BCGROJG,1,6,Samsung TV, so good.
B00BCGROJG,1,7,Last Samsung purchase.
B00BCGROJG,1,8,This is a great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,9,Great Picture.
B00BCGROJG,1,10,Great Buy.
B00BCGROJG,1,11,Not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,1,12,Its picture is very good and cant get enough of it.
B00BCGROJG,1,13,Do I think the picture quality is as good as the PANNY?
B00BCGROJG,1,14,Other than that great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,15,Great TV but a quirk.
B00BCGROJG,1,16,Good value for $1600.
B00BCGROJG,1,17,I love my Samsung TV!!
B00BCGROJG,1,18,None of the Sonys we liked were available (2012 models); then, we saw this Samsung for a very good price and decided to buy.
B00BCGROJG,1,19,so good.
B00BCGROJG,1,20,Everything looks great after 1 month of ownership.
B00BCGROJG,1,21,I think I need to tweek the picture on it a little more but it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,1,22,Otherwise a great television.
B00BCGROJG,1,23,I got a used one from the amazon warehouse and it is as good as new with phenomenal picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,1,24,great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,0,Great Picture, poor sound.
B00BCGROJG,2,1,Great Picture Quality but not so great sound quality.
B00BCGROJG,2,2,The speakers are good too.
B00BCGROJG,2,3,Overall picture quality is very good.
B00BCGROJG,2,4,Now I have the ultimate in sound and picture.
B00BCGROJG,2,5,The sound is not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,2,6,The TV picture quality is amazing, however the sound quality is really poor.
B00BCGROJG,2,7,Clear picture, and great sound even without sound system.
B00BCGROJG,2,8,Sound quality is good too.
B00BCGROJG,2,9,picture is great, sound is OK (but that's why you have a home theater system).
B00BCGROJG,2,10,The sound is good, but I'm going to get some speakers for a better audio experience.
B00BCGROJG,2,11,The sound is acceptable, but an external sound system is really necessary for sound immersion.
B00BCGROJG,2,12,TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,2,13,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,14,Everything is good.
B00BCGROJG,2,15,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,2,16,Great TV!
B00BCGROJG,2,17,As expected, the picture is great!
B00BCGROJG,2,18,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,2,19,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,2,20,great picture, lousy gimmicks.
B00BCGROJG,2,21,Before someone tells me that I shouldn't use tv speakers and should instead use a surround sound system, I get that.
B00BCGROJG,2,22,First off, you bought a TV, not a sound system.
B00BCGROJG,2,23,I am running sound through my Denon AVR E300 receiver and it is great.
B00BCGROJG,2,24,This unit has a spectacular picture.
B00BCGROJG,3,0,Great TV - Not So Great Delivery Service.
B00BCGROJG,3,1,Tried AMAZON ..4 days later, tv in house lookin' great.
B00BCGROJG,3,2,I was very skeptical about ordering a tv through Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,3,TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,3,4,The delivery guy showed up two hours early, not know the delivery time... luckily I was home.
B00BCGROJG,3,5,I ordered it through Amazon, and had a delivery scheduled.
B00BCGROJG,3,6,TV great, customer service not so much.
B00BCGROJG,3,7,This tv is amazing, the delivery was great!!
B00BCGROJG,3,8,TV arrived on time (2 days!) and worked no problem.
B00BCGROJG,3,9,Amazon delivery was on time and TV arrived in PERFECT condition.
B00BCGROJG,3,10,Great Deal.
B00BCGROJG,3,11,"What happened is that I scheduled the delivery time (online) with CEVA, their shipping company, for Aug 28th between 3 and 6pm and arranged to get home early from work.
B00BCGROJG,3,12,Awesome TV for 3 days, Delivery was not the best.
B00BCGROJG,3,13,The TV shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,14,The "enhanced" delivery was less then enhanced but the TV arrived in perfect condition.
B00BCGROJG,3,15,We ordered the TV through Amazon and they delivered on time and it was very easy to deal with them.
B00BCGROJG,3,16,There went another $20 on Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,17,Amazon was great.
B00BCGROJG,3,18,I do recommend that when you purchase one that you go online or to Samsung tech support for help setting up the screen settings which are many but help to make this TV the best I have ever seen!
B00BCGROJG,3,19,I ended up helping the delivery guy unbox the unit.
B00BCGROJG,3,20,delivery guy who brought it by and set it up was very helpful as well
B00BCGROJG,3,21,I've not had a problem with Amazon so I haven't had to test their customer service.
B00BCGROJG,3,22,Product works great, delivery was on time (I got to specify a 3 hour window), and they even came in and installed the base to the tv and waited for me to make sure everything worked.
B00BCGROJG,3,23,Great piece of work.
B00BCGROJG,3,24,The 2% rewards points Amazon offered along with the free shipping was nice too.Get the 5yr warranty.
B00BCGROJG,4,0,Great Picture.
B00BCGROJG,4,1,Everyone would commend on how great the picture is.
B00BCGROJG,4,2,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,4,3,Great picture.
B00BCGROJG,4,4,Awsome picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,4,5,Great Picture but so many settings it takes forever to set the colors and picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,4,6,It took me awhile to get my picture quality the way I liked it.
B00BCGROJG,4,7,Great picture.
B00BCGROJG,4,8,Quality Picture.
B00BCGROJG,4,9,The TV is great, picture quality is phenomenal.
B00BCGROJG,4,10,Great picture.
B00BCGROJG,4,11,Great Picture Quality but not so great sound quality.
B00BCGROJG,4,12,The picture of this TV is just amazing.
B00BCGROJG,4,13,Good picture.
B00BCGROJG,4,14,The picture quality is great.
B00BCGROJG,4,15,Great picture quality... leakage of blacks.. First of all.
B00BCGROJG,4,16,The picture quality is good.
B00BCGROJG,4,17,PICTURE.
B00BCGROJG,4,18,great TV.
B00BCGROJG,4,19,But once he did get the settings right...the picture is amazing.
B00BCGROJG,4,20,I got this for the picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,4,21,I don't but this is a great TV.

B00BCGROJG,5,17,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,5,18,Great Picture, Poor Smarts.
B00BCGROJG,5,19,Based on picture quality alone, it is a great buy for the money.
B00BCGROJG,5,20,Great picture, great for sports.
B00BCGROJG,5,21,As with all Samsung Smart TV,s they are the best.
B00BCGROJG,5,22,The product is really good I like the Samsung design is nice and good picture qualityAnd then like a good choice in this product
B00BCGROJG,5,23,This is a great smart tv.
B00BCGROJG,5,24,Great smart tv.
B00BCGROJG,6,0,3D does work, watched few 3D movies from Netflix.
B00BCGROJG,6,1,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,6,2,The apps are great and works well, only draw back is with remote.
B00BCGROJG,6,3,We tried the 3D, but never really got too into it, but it does come with 4 Samsung 3D glasses.
B00BCGROJG,6,4,Samsung un65f7100 3d smart tv .very
B00BCGROJG,6,5,Great Smart TV.
B00BCGROJG,6,6,love this TV perfect picture, watched our first 3d movie it was great!!! everything we have is samsung and they all work together!
B00BCGROJG,6,7,This smart TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,6,8,Smart TV...is great.
B00BCGROJG,6,9,Micro-dimming feature and smart hub are great features.
B00BCGROJG,6,10,This is a great smart tv.
B00BCGROJG,6,11,Great smart tv.
B00BCGROJG,6,12,great for watching sports, movies and gaming
B00BCGROJG,6,13,Great Picture, Poor Smarts.
B00BCGROJG,6,14,I have Stars which has 3D movies for subscribers to their movies.
B00BCGROJG,6,15,I really enjoy watching 3D movies.
B00BCGROJG,6,16,3D was great.
B00BCGROJG,6,17,Great 3D experience.
B00BCGROJG,6,18,The picture is great and the 3D worked fine with my one 3D Bluray movie Gravity.
B00BCGROJG,6,19,Conversion of 2D to3 D was not great but playing 3D movies is a great experience.
B00BCGROJG,6,20,Great Smart Features, they most likely have any app or service you could want.Cons:1.
B00BCGROJG,6,21,I have the 7100 set up primarily  for watching movies.
B00BCGROJG,6,22,The picture is great, screen mirroring, Samsung Apps..
B00BCGROJG,6,23,Can't wait to watch a 3D movie.
B00BCGROJG,6,24,Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter.
B00BCGROJG,7,0,The HDMI to cable box connection assures a great out of the box picture.
B00BCGROJG,7,1,I can't plug my Direct TV HDMI cable to the Samsung ARC input and maybe someone on here will be able to steer me to the right direction.
B00BCGROJG,7,2,I had to play with the settings on my tv and xbox to get it working again.
B00BCGROJG,7,3,With 4 HDMI inputs and all sorts of USB drive options you can watch an endless stream of video.The sound quality is very good.
B00BCGROJG,7,4,Was plug and play right out of the box.
B00BCGROJG,7,5,The picture is amazingly clear and perfect on the HD channels.
B00BCGROJG,7,6,Picture is great.
B00BCGROJG,7,7,I would rate it between 4 to 5 stars and here's why.After a few hours of playing with the picture settings and advanced settings, using a Time Warner cable box with HDMI connection, the picture is spectacular for 95% of the HD content.
B00BCGROJG,7,8,This is where some playing with the picture mode and color/tint options may come into play.A glance at the TV's specs will show you that there are plenty of connections available.
B00BCGROJG,7,9,Moving on to the TV gadgets, it comes with a bunch of the USB ports and another bunch of HDMI ports as well a 3mm jack port for your sound and a RF so you can interact with your cable or satellite box, and also components RCA ports for your Xbox, PS3 etc.
B00BCGROJG,7,10,I have a connection of 30MB with cable connections, a very good, strong connection from an ASUS N66u Dual band router.
B00BCGROJG,7,11,Beside the HDMI inputs, you can connect only 1 component video source OR 1 composite video source, not both at the same time.
B00BCGROJG,7,12,Great Picture Quality but not so great sound quality.
B00BCGROJG,7,13,I've also made sure I'm on a channel with little-to-no interference.
B00BCGROJG,7,14,I love being able to see all my pictures and videos any time without the need of a DVD player.
B00BCGROJG,7,15,Sound quality is good too.
B00BCGROJG,7,16,It has great picture, the apps work great, and the sound is is decent (which is all you can ask for on tvs now-a-days).
B00BCGROJG,7,17,It works fine now on gaming mode, but I still can't have the numbers come up in diablo 3.  Otherwise the tv works great.
B00BCGROJG,7,18,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,7,19,The picture is excellent and has plenty of features (more that I need)Now the cons : You can not set up favorites on a HDMI connection and the full tv guide is always opened at channel 1.
B00BCGROJG,7,20,Great Picture but so many settings it takes forever to set the colors and picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,7,21,It cannot be used to select a channel from the guide--I have to use my cable box remote to select channels.
B00BCGROJG,7,22,Great price.
B00BCGROJG,7,23,Now I have the ultimate in sound and picture.
B00BCGROJG,7,24,The TV is hooked up to the internet at first I used the wireless connection to see what the performance was like and it was fine.
B00BCGROJG,8,0,3 out of 3 screens had a dead pixel.
B00BCGROJG,8,1,Defective screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,2,The first set I took home had 6 - 8 gray bard radiating up vertically from top to bottom whenever the screen was black or letter-boxed -- VERY disturbing.
B00BCGROJG,8,3,When he saw the screen he said they should not be this bad and I got a bad panel.
B00BCGROJG,8,4,It also had this bouncing white square go across the top of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,5,This time, I had them set up the TV on the floor and look at both screens side by side.
B00BCGROJG,8,6,Perfect screen with lighting issue gone!
B00BCGROJG,8,7,Picture is dark.
B00BCGROJG,8,8,As soon as it powered on,  the lower left corner of the TV had an estimated 100+ of black and white pixels going jagged and horizontal across the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,9,Well, do you like visually dark movies, like many Batman movies, or Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow?
B00BCGROJG,8,10,Once we got into watching DARK movies in a DARK room, we quickly realized that "CLOUDING" and "FLASH LIGHTING" was going to be an issue.
B00BCGROJG,8,11,Again, 4 red stuck pixels on the screen, and some pinkish hue to only the right side of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,12,But when vertical bars radiate from  the bottom on a Macbook, it means the LED screen or bar at the bottom of the screen is going bad.
B00BCGROJG,8,13,However,  you get bad flash-lighting and uniformity issues along the sides of the tv, most noticeable in dark scenes with bright areas or end credits.
B00BCGROJG,8,14,The last tv panel was so bad it looked like I was watching movies through cloud cover....clouds that didn't move!!
B00BCGROJG,8,15,This means that you can see shadows, or flashlight patterns of light emanating from the corners of the TV pointing towards the center, this effect is usually only noticed in very dark movie scenes or pure black backgrounds.
B00BCGROJG,8,16,Very noticeable in dark scenes.
B00BCGROJG,8,17,There are many, many settings that affect brightness, many settings that affect color balance, etc... so even the last few settings will make a big difference to how the picture looks.
B00BCGROJG,8,18,If you watch a movie with a lot of blacks, dark scenes, you will notice a significant amount of white clouding in the blacked out areas.
B00BCGROJG,8,19,Even turning the back light down to zero would not eliminate the clouding.
B00BCGROJG,8,20,LED is similar to LCD, LED basically means that the TV is back-lit better and in turn makes sure their are no dark spots on the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,21,LED is similar to LCD, LED basically means that the TV is back-lit better and in turn makes sure their are no dark spots on the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,22,Nothing that will ever show the darkness flaws on the screen.Bottom Line: If you watch TV in a lit room, and don't watch dark movies like "The Dark Knight", "The Purge", "Star Trek into Darkness", or any movie with a prolonged dark scene, then get it.If you want see an perfectly amazing dark picture from a TV that retails for $5,000.
B00BCGROJG,8,23,Furthermore, room lighting must be nearly dark to notice this flaw.
B00BCGROJG,8,24,The left side of the screen seems slightly brighter than the right when viewing a black screen.....it does not appear to affect the picture when watching content - but just worth mentioning.3)
B00BCGROJG,9,0,Do not buy Samsung!!
B00BCGROJG,9,1,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,9,2,TV was purchased for an 85 year old.
B00BCGROJG,9,3,We vowed NEVER to get another Samsung again.
B00BCGROJG,9,4,Dont buy Samsung - they don't last.
B00BCGROJG,9,5,Samsung 65 in.
B00BCGROJG,9,6,*****W A R N I N G*****Do not buy SAMSUNG Televisions!!!
B00BCGROJG,9,7,I purchased one from Best Buy in early October 2013.
B00BCGROJG,9,8,For 58.00 more you now have a 5 year warranty.
B00BCGROJG,9,9,(I even wrote a review about it under Samsung PN58C500.)
B00BCGROJG,9,10,TV was DOA at 15 months.
B00BCGROJG,9,11,Now 2 years later - same problem.
B00BCGROJG,9,12,Samsung is great on all products we have owned.
B00BCGROJG,9,13,I purchased a large and expensive Samsung LED TV from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,9,14,Everything you would expect from a Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,9,15,Last Samsung I will ever buy.
B00BCGROJG,9,16,Just buy it.
B00BCGROJG,9,17,I bought a Samsung 550 soundbar.
B00BCGROJG,9,18,Buy a set for a 1000.00
B00BCGROJG,9,19,This TV is 8 days old!!! It's still under the manufacturer's warranty obviously, but given our past 2 circumstances with Samsung, I would advise anyone: DO NOT PURCHASE A SAMSUNG TV WITHOUT AN EXTENDED WARRANTY.
B00BCGROJG,9,20,The 8000 series samsung looked the best followed by any of the samsungs afterwards.
B00BCGROJG,9,21,This is my second TV purchase in the past 10 years, my previous set being a 32" Samsung LCD which was mid/high end back in 2004.
B00BCGROJG,9,22,8 months ago I purchased a 55" Samsung for my bedroom.
B00BCGROJG,9,23,I am having issues with a 14 month old Samsung that cost $3000.It is a 65" LCD LED 3 D Samsung.I am in the Costco extended warranty.
B00BCGROJG,9,24,I paid 2300.00 for my 7100 series Samsung LCD TV thinking I was buying quality.
B00BCGROJG,10,0,Before someone tells me that I shouldn't use tv speakers and should instead use a surround sound system, I get that.
B00BCGROJG,10,1,The louder you make the sound, the louder that dink noises becomes.
B00BCGROJG,10,2,picture is great, sound is OK (but that's why you have a home theater system).
B00BCGROJG,10,3,annoying was the TV speakers rattle sometimes, at low volume, when on surround sound mode.
B00BCGROJG,10,4,The sound is acceptable, but an external sound system is really necessary for sound immersion.
B00BCGROJG,10,5,The sound from the built-in speakers is fair but I use external speakers so that doesn't really matter too much to me.
B00BCGROJG,10,6,OTHER REVIEWS COMPLAINED ABOUT THE SOUND NOT BEING LOUD ENOUGH BUT I DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK THAT WAS A PROBLEM.
B00BCGROJG,10,7,The sound is not as bad as some reviewers say, at least for me, but I will be purchasing speakers later simply because that's what they're for!
B00BCGROJG,10,8,The apps on the TV cannot give you 5.1 sound because the output must go from your cable (or satellite) box to the home theater system, not from the digital audio out from the TV.
B00BCGROJG,10,9,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,10,10,Great Picture Quality but not so great sound quality.
B00BCGROJG,10,11,The sound is good, but I'm going to get some speakers for a better audio experience.
B00BCGROJG,10,12,Clear picture, and great sound even without sound system.
B00BCGROJG,10,13,Sound is fine (was a concern to me).
B00BCGROJG,10,14,See  my reviews under URCMEThe TV  sound is fair but not spectacular, so I have my Samsung Sound Bar plugged into the digital outlet that Samsung provides giving the TV outstanding  sound.
B00BCGROJG,10,15,A small annoying thing that I still don't know if there's a fix for is that "dink" noise that the volume control makes.
B00BCGROJG,10,16,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,10,17,About 8 days later, my son was watching it when it suddenly turned off, made a loud buzzing sound, started smelling like burnt something, and now will no longer turn on.
B00BCGROJG,10,18,Sound quality of the LG was great.
B00BCGROJG,10,19,I'm not sure what I should have expected.
B00BCGROJG,10,20,The picture is still good, just not as great as when you are in front of it.
B00BCGROJG,10,21,If you messed it up and the TV is not working properly, don't work hard and take it of the wall (like I did).
B00BCGROJG,10,22,It took me awhile to get my picture quality the way I liked it.
B00BCGROJG,10,23,great picture, lousy gimmicks.
B00BCGROJG,10,24,Once it turned off by itself.
B00BCGROJG,11,0,Samsung customer service wasn't very helpful in acknowledging the problem.
B00BCGROJG,11,1,I called Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,11,2,They kept on harping that there is nothing they could do until their so called agencies confirmed that there is a problem.
B00BCGROJG,11,3,Called Samsung and we had service scheduled.
B00BCGROJG,11,4,Customer service was no help.
B00BCGROJG,11,5,The delivery service NEVER reached out to me to set up a delivery time or to verify my phone #.
B00BCGROJG,11,6,I have had tremendous success with Samsung and Amazon's service has always been good to me.
B00BCGROJG,11,7,Samsung customer service is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced.
B00BCGROJG,11,8,After more than 2 hours on the call I got them to assign the ticket to a new customer service center.
B00BCGROJG,11,9,A pattern is emerging, so a call to Samsung, not the service center.
B00BCGROJG,11,10,Pray that you don't have any problems with it.
B00BCGROJG,11,11,A few more days go by and I receive a  voicemail from another representative requesting that I call them back.
B00BCGROJG,11,12,So she said she would have someone from tech support (or some such department) call me.
B00BCGROJG,11,13,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,11,14,Having Problems.
B00BCGROJG,11,15,By then I can set up a delivery date that works for me.
B00BCGROJG,11,16,We were scheduled another appointment early the next week, no call, no fix, after a call we were told the wrong part was sent.
B00BCGROJG,11,17,Another appointment scheduled for the next week and no fix, no call, another call to the service center, Part came in broken, we will schedule you for early next week.
B00BCGROJG,11,18,I have had the TV for a week now and am still waiting on repair.
B00BCGROJG,11,19,I called Samsung to exchange them.
B00BCGROJG,11,20,This is horrible service!
B00BCGROJG,11,21,I called Samsung back and was told that the email would arrive only after the exchange was approved by executive level customer service.
B00BCGROJG,11,22,Well you betcha I have problems.
B00BCGROJG,11,23,This is the e-mail i received from Amazon with NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER!Because the TV was defective, we'll pay for the return shipping costs.
B00BCGROJG,11,24,They came down 3 times to my place and then completely lied to Samsung that they have fixed the problem when they didn't.
B00BCGROJG,12,0,Here is what i found on the lcdtvbuyingguide setting.
B00BCGROJG,12,1,Picture settings.
B00BCGROJG,12,2,Great Picture but so many settings it takes forever to set the colors and picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,12,3,Picture is phenomenal!
B00BCGROJG,12,4,I think I need to tweek the picture on it a little more but it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,12,5,Very good picture quality.
B00BCGROJG,12,6,Flesh tones are mixed in standard setting with some picture calibration of the settings I was able to get them very good.
B00BCGROJG,12,7,There are many, many settings that affect brightness, many settings that affect color balance, etc... so even the last few settings will make a big difference to how the picture looks.
B00BCGROJG,12,8,The picture looks good, but I suspect it will look much better after adjusting it like other folks have had to do.
B00BCGROJG,12,9,I did not like theSmart picture thingy.
B00BCGROJG,12,10,Great tv but.
B00BCGROJG,12,11,Picture is great.
B00BCGROJG,12,12,The picture quality was much better though.
B00BCGROJG,12,13,The picture quality of this television out of the box is good - but the default settings are atrocious!
B00BCGROJG,12,14,Without his recommendations I would never even have found most of the picture and color settings.
B00BCGROJG,12,15,Let me know if anyone wants to compare picture settings.
B00BCGROJG,12,16,Nice picture, once it is adjusted.What
B00BCGROJG,12,17,Beautiful picture, once set up.So this is a great tv.
B00BCGROJG,12,18,I have only had for a few weeks but picture is great.
B00BCGROJG,12,19,great!
B00BCGROJG,12,20,The picture was ok.
B00BCGROJG,12,21,I will look into it and I am sure that I can re-adjust a setting to fix this issue.
B00BCGROJG,12,22,Picture quality is poor, and viewing angle is narrow.
B00BCGROJG,12,23,They just run the picture test mode and verify that there’s a uniformed picture.
B00BCGROJG,12,24,Then I went into setting and made set it to default.
B00BCGROJG,13,0,I would definitely buy it again and recommend it, but they need a redesign on their remote.
B00BCGROJG,13,1,I almost did not buy this TV after reading some of the 5-star reviews!
B00BCGROJG,13,2,For the product a 5 stars.
B00BCGROJG,13,3,The TV would have gotten 4 stars if the remote was usable.
B00BCGROJG,13,4,The remote, however, is dysfunctional.
B00BCGROJG,13,5,Besides that I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a new TV
B00BCGROJG,13,6,If there is one thing that I dislike, it is the remote control.
B00BCGROJG,13,7,Beware before buying.
B00BCGROJG,13,8,I have a few Samsung products including this TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,9,I will revise this review once I get the TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,10,I read several different reviews on this product before purchasing so I was aware of difficulty of using before receiving.
B00BCGROJG,13,11,Buyer beware!
B00BCGROJG,13,12,Here is what i found on the lcdtvbuyingguide setting.
B00BCGROJG,13,13,They denied any responsibility for their product.
B00BCGROJG,13,14,Our only complaint is that provided remote control is very difficult to use and is feature poor.
B00BCGROJG,13,15,I will look into it and I am sure that I can re-adjust a setting to fix this issue.
B00BCGROJG,13,16,Only 4 screws to attach the base.
B00BCGROJG,13,17,This is my first ever Samsung product.
B00BCGROJG,13,18,I'm going to try settings that other folks have listed in these reviews and hope they know whatthey're doing.
B00BCGROJG,13,19,The screws supplied would not work with the base.
B00BCGROJG,13,20,I've done my research and read all the reviews and I'm here to say if you buy this tv you will not regret it!Out of the box its super easy to set up!
B00BCGROJG,13,21,The only thing that I have not tried is the voice control on the remote.
B00BCGROJG,13,22,Overall I would highly suggest this tv based on my own experience and will alter this review if anything comes up.
B00BCGROJG,13,23,This new generation remote works very well moving between normal TV and the smart TV settings.
B00BCGROJG,13,24,Read these reviews and you see that they have failed miserably; not with the product but withthe marketing of it due to defaults and simple settings.
B00BCGROJG,14,0,The internet apps (Netflix and Hulu) work great.
B00BCGROJG,14,1,The smart TV app?
B00BCGROJG,14,2,wireless is not work.
B00BCGROJG,14,3,There does seem to be a "flow" problem with the SMART tv at times.
B00BCGROJG,14,4,I get a network error watching Netflix and Hulu, but I use the Plex app most of all.
B00BCGROJG,14,5,At the same times apps like netflix and amazon will be reset.
B00BCGROJG,14,6,i couldn't use the Wi-fi to watch the internet TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,7,Apps can't be reorganized.
B00BCGROJG,14,8,I think that if I don't want an app, I should be able to de-install it.
B00BCGROJG,14,9,The same problem was found on the Amazon App in the Smart Hub but not as bad.
B00BCGROJG,14,10,Connected without a problem.
B00BCGROJG,14,11,It said I should re-install the app.
B00BCGROJG,14,12,Previews are available on like 10 different apps.
B00BCGROJG,14,13,Netflix, Amazon, and Youtube work as expected.
B00BCGROJG,14,14,It doesn't work.
B00BCGROJG,14,15,The is a smart TV. 5 star for the TV part. 1 start for "smart" part.
B00BCGROJG,14,16,The Wi-Fi disconnects from time to time.3-
B00BCGROJG,14,17,Samsung apps (like NFL for instance) can't be deleted.
B00BCGROJG,14,18,Fortunately, you can use your smartphone or tablet that has the YouTube app to “cast” the video on the TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,19,Sometimes it works fine and other times I have to turn my tv off and on every 5 minutes.
B00BCGROJG,14,20,I had to use the Netflix app on my bluray player instead... bummer... and a disappointment.
B00BCGROJG,14,21,Has access to a lot of apps.4-
B00BCGROJG,14,22,They came down 3 times to my place and then completely lied to Samsung that they have fixed the problem when they didn't.
B00BCGROJG,14,23,All of the big apps are available for free on the play store and most of them work without any problems.
B00BCGROJG,14,24,The "tools" menu doesn't work when you are in the Smart Hub or streaming movies.-
B00BCGROJG,15,0,Here too, the remote is irritating.
B00BCGROJG,15,1,The remote control is a little funky and takes time getting used to.
B00BCGROJG,15,2,It is the first metal remote I've seen.
B00BCGROJG,15,3,The remote, however, is dysfunctional.
B00BCGROJG,15,4,would anyone need 4 HDMI inputs?
B00BCGROJG,15,5,I didn't see any.I will say that the remote takes some getting used to.
B00BCGROJG,15,6,It also has Arc, so all you need is one HDMI to the TV/receiver.
B00BCGROJG,15,7,Instead you have to press the “more” button on the remote that will give you a virtual remote on the screen that will let you change to a specific channel.
B00BCGROJG,15,8,It cannot be used to select a channel from the guide--I have to use my cable box remote to select channels.
B00BCGROJG,15,9,The only issue i really have is the remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,10,All HDMI ports don't work.
B00BCGROJG,15,11,There aren't any buttons!
B00BCGROJG,15,12,I'd rather have buttons.
B00BCGROJG,15,13,If there is one thing that I dislike, it is the remote control.
B00BCGROJG,15,14,Plugged in power and HDMI and it worked.
B00BCGROJG,15,15,The only thing I don't like is the remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,16,Great TV, Crappy remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,17,You will need to use a universal remote (making sure you disable the powering on from the remote as the TV will do this on it's own) or the receiver remote to change the receiver input back to the correct device.
B00BCGROJG,15,18,Intuitive.The remote with a touch pad works okay.
B00BCGROJG,15,19,Beside the HDMI inputs, you can connect only 1 component video source OR 1 composite video source, not both at the same time.
B00BCGROJG,15,20,But tv works well overall.
B00BCGROJG,15,21,Smart Touch remote - ok but a little limited as you may still need to use a second remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,22,It would be nice, though, to have these buttons on the remote.-
B00BCGROJG,15,23,I like and use the tv remote sometimes paired with the cable remote but my wife is strictly a cable remote user.
B00BCGROJG,15,24,Only in the remote did not find the mute button, that is more important to have it.

B00AOA9BL0,0,6,I'd give this five stars if I could have viewed the Olympics when I was out of town the other day.
B00AOA9BL0,0,7,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,0,8,It gets very annoying when one is trying to watch a good movie or show.

B00AOA9BL0,1,8,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,1,9,I had no reason to believe it wouldn't be the same fantastic quality.
B00AOA9BL0,1,10,ok application for the price.
B00AOA9BL0,1,11,It's a big deal for me.
B00AOA9BL0,1,12,Wish they would provide full service for all the channels, including locals, that I pay a great deal for at home.
B00AOA9BL0,1,13,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.

B00AOA9BL0,1,21,If it isn't a big deal for you, you'll probably like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,1,22,When it works it is great to have these shows/movies available at my fingertips.
B00AOA9BL0,1,23,good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,1,24,Great when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,2,0,Sound more than occasionally would be good too.

B00AOA9BL0,2,4,Would be great if it worked.
B00AOA9BL0,2,5,Video quality is acceptable though not great.

B00AOA9BL0,2,7,Not much good without video.
B00AOA9BL0,2,8,It's always low even though my volume is all the way up.
B00AOA9BL0,2,9,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,2,10,Like others have said...Good but not great!
B00AOA9BL0,2,11,good enough.
B00AOA9BL0,2,12,so far, not so good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,13,Good idea but it needs to be improve.
B00AOA9BL0,2,14,It is not my device  because sound  is  great for all other applications
B00AOA9BL0,2,15,Even with Blue Tooth headphones, the volume is just too low.
B00AOA9BL0,2,16,Good, but quirky.
B00AOA9BL0,2,17,Not What Expected.
B00AOA9BL0,2,18,works when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,2,19,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,2,20,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,2,21,Can't get volume.
B00AOA9BL0,2,22,Still has room for improvement.
B00AOA9BL0,2,23,When I first got it it was awesome an worked great.
B00AOA9BL0,2,24,Good but...
B00AOA9BL0,3,0,Would be great if it worked.
B00AOA9BL0,3,1,worked great at first.
B00AOA9BL0,3,2,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,3,3,Did not work with my TV.
B00AOA9BL0,3,4,serviceable.
B00AOA9BL0,3,5,Called amazon, Comcast, no help.
B00AOA9BL0,3,6,It does not work with all the boxes in the house.
B00AOA9BL0,3,7,Is it me or has anyone else had this problem.
B00AOA9BL0,3,8,Worked amazingly at first.
B00AOA9BL0,3,9,Though I am satisfied with my services, the customer service would rate at best a D-, and cost for those services about the same.
B00AOA9BL0,3,10,I found that if I am busy around the house and I want to watch something ie; golf tournament I take my phone with me.
B00AOA9BL0,3,11,Great for knowing when your favorit shows are on and want to learn about new upcoming shows and events.
B00AOA9BL0,3,12,I tried a couple of times.
B00AOA9BL0,3,13,This app was helpful back in the day when we had TV.
B00AOA9BL0,3,14,Okay product.
B00AOA9BL0,3,15,Now 7 techs later and no one can fix it.
B00AOA9BL0,3,16,When I first got it it was awesome an worked great.
B00AOA9BL0,3,17,Can't steam any movies or shows.Edit:: After a week longer and 10 more techs comcast told me if I wanted them to fix the app/whatever's keeping it from working, I have to pay $50.
B00AOA9BL0,3,18,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,3,19,I agree with some of the other reviews that if Comcast can charge you an arm and leg for cable it would be nice if all the perks they offered actually work.
B00AOA9BL0,3,20,It's free is the only good thing that I didn't buy it.
B00AOA9BL0,3,21,It's great whwn it works.
B00AOA9BL0,3,22,I was able to watch most of my shows at any time, and not have to worry about my schedule.

B00AOA9BL0,4,5,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,4,6,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,4,7,Like others have said...Good but not great!
B00AOA9BL0,4,8,Playback a little jerky in spots but very good picture clarity and balance.
B00AOA9BL0,4,9,Excellent Design Poor Content.
B00AOA9BL0,4,10,But, it's great When it Works (clear picture, no buffering, saves your data).
B00AOA9BL0,4,11,If this feature was available this app would be much more useful.The other feature is actually having parental controls.
B00AOA9BL0,4,12,great.
B00AOA9BL0,4,13,great but not.
B00AOA9BL0,4,14,Crystal clear and very fast.
B00AOA9BL0,4,15,When I first got it it was awesome an worked great.
B00AOA9BL0,4,16,Right now, the only option is to show (or not show) adult movies.
B00AOA9BL0,4,17,App looks great and navigation is easy, for the most part.
B00AOA9BL0,4,18,This is a very nice app.
B00AOA9BL0,4,19,nice app.
B00AOA9BL0,4,20,When the app does work the picture is crisp and it is a good experience.
B00AOA9BL0,4,21,Basic features aren't available.
B00AOA9BL0,4,22,It allows me to watch anywhere with great quality of video.
B00AOA9BL0,4,23,It's great whwn it works.
B00AOA9BL0,4,24,The buffering, sound, and fast forward/rewind could be tweaked.
B00AOA9BL0,5,0,good, but long way from great.
B00AOA9BL0,5,1,Ok but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,5,2,No good it should be pulled it is no good.
B00AOA9BL0,5,3,Waste of time it is no good should be taken off so no one else wastes their time What a shame
B00AOA9BL0,5,4,When I first got it it was awesome an worked great.
B00AOA9BL0,5,5,If you buy this you are wasting time if you don't have wifi where you are going if they get downloadable Disney I will be very happy and happy to write a five star review.
B00AOA9BL0,5,6,Don't waste your time or effort on this.
B00AOA9BL0,5,7,Will change review when I do
B00AOA9BL0,5,8,Good in theory but doesn't work the way advertised.....
B00AOA9BL0,5,9,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,5,10,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,5,11,If I had to pay for it, I would rate it a 1/5 and not purchase it.
B00AOA9BL0,5,12,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,5,13,Being able to watch some shows live being away from home is great also.
B00AOA9BL0,5,14,was great.
B00AOA9BL0,5,15,it is not worth your time or effort isay remove it from choices!!!
B00AOA9BL0,5,16,I'm sure this is a great product.
B00AOA9BL0,5,17,Not  a lot to pick from but has good choices.
B00AOA9BL0,5,18,They have spent TONS of money marketing this feature for downloading shows to go,  but good luck finding anything worth downloading.
B00AOA9BL0,5,19,Not a happy camper.
B00AOA9BL0,5,20,big waste.
B00AOA9BL0,5,21,Like others have said...Good but not great!
B00AOA9BL0,5,22,If this feature was available this app would be much more useful.The other feature is actually having parental controls.
B00AOA9BL0,5,23,To be honest, the real reason I'm not too happy is the fact that I couldn't change the quality of the video.
B00AOA9BL0,5,24,Has some good features.
B00AOA9BL0,6,0,Otherwise, the app is okay.
B00AOA9BL0,6,1,What has happened to this app?
B00AOA9BL0,6,2,Hbo has its own app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,3,I would like to see these incorporated into this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,4,Great app for on the Go but not at home.
B00AOA9BL0,6,5,When the app works, it's great.
B00AOA9BL0,6,6,Otherwise it is a good app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,7,Great App.
B00AOA9BL0,6,8,I've watched around 5 movies so far.
B00AOA9BL0,6,9,They will not let you watch it on your TV.
B00AOA9BL0,6,10,Just watch on your tv.
B00AOA9BL0,6,11,okay but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,6,12,It's great whwn it works.
B00AOA9BL0,6,13,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,6,14,great.
B00AOA9BL0,6,15,great but not.
B00AOA9BL0,6,16,was great.
B00AOA9BL0,6,17,don't confuse this with being able to watch like on tv.
B00AOA9BL0,6,18,Doesn't always want  to work though.
B00AOA9BL0,6,19,Great...when it works...
B00AOA9BL0,6,20,other wise it is a really nice app
B00AOA9BL0,6,21,I probably will only use this app to watch BBC America while I am away at college.
B00AOA9BL0,6,22,only good if you have starz and showtime.
B00AOA9BL0,6,23,Has some good features.
B00AOA9BL0,6,24,Probably a good app but I will never know.
B00AOA9BL0,7,0,No HDMI out...boo!
B00AOA9BL0,7,1,When it works it is good.
B00AOA9BL0,7,2,Goes to 5 stars with the HDMI out working.
B00AOA9BL0,7,3,Where are Discovery and the Science channel?
B00AOA9BL0,7,4,Netflix has HDMI out.
B00AOA9BL0,7,5,not good.
B00AOA9BL0,7,6,great but.
B00AOA9BL0,7,7,nice layout and easy to use.
B00AOA9BL0,7,8,Must have Comcast as a cable or high speed internet connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,9,Are all channels not available?
B00AOA9BL0,7,10,There are too many other ways to get HD onto my tablet.Gregg
B00AOA9BL0,7,11,Help, I just bought a new hdtv to connect to my fire hd via hdmi cable, and no shows will play whether connected to the tv or not.
B00AOA9BL0,7,12,If you purchase HBO, Starz, and a lot of options beyond basic cable, you will have a lot to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,7,13,3 stars for neutral rating as you must have Comcast as a cable or high speed internet connection
B00AOA9BL0,7,14,I'm not able to access all the show under my premium network and some in the regular network.
B00AOA9BL0,7,15,Easy to use
B00AOA9BL0,7,16,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,7,17,Lots of shows available with lots of past season content.
B00AOA9BL0,7,18,Missing some of my favorite channels!
B00AOA9BL0,7,19,No network tv stations.
B00AOA9BL0,7,20,All the shows I want to watch are available but don't always play even when i can get them to play on the computer.
B00AOA9BL0,7,21,you can not use your hmdi cable you can only watch it on your device.
B00AOA9BL0,7,22,When I first got this app, it was great.
B00AOA9BL0,7,23,It allows me to watch anywhere with great quality of video.
B00AOA9BL0,7,24,Well designed layout but it would be nice to access live or programs now showing on the cable.
B00AOA9BL0,8,0,There is a green bar at the top of your screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,1,I do wish you could attach to a tv to watch on bigger screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,2,Impossible to watch a show without interruption.
B00AOA9BL0,8,3,Only works part time.
B00AOA9BL0,8,4,Have to keep moving slide bar on time left in program.
B00AOA9BL0,8,5,Check the settings panel; both volume and brightness control can be exposed.
B00AOA9BL0,8,6,I like that I can watch shows on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,8,7,Don't bother unless you have a larger device unless you'd like to watch TV on a little screen as it doesn't fill the entire screen with the show.Hope that this helps.Time to uninstall.
B00AOA9BL0,8,8,Also, tried watching some shows and the words didn't match up with their mouths.
B00AOA9BL0,8,9,Takes longer to watch the show.
B00AOA9BL0,8,10,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,8,11,Out of the 20+ times I've tried this, maybe 3 or 4 times I was actually able to watch something.
B00AOA9BL0,8,12,Ad,s work good but program son,t work.
B00AOA9BL0,8,13,disappointed much room for improvement!
B00AOA9BL0,8,14,Been having a lot of issues with tv shows an  movies not playing.
B00AOA9BL0,8,15,Often times just plainly won't work, gives a blank screen that completely stops responding.
B00AOA9BL0,8,16,So I go to reload the  program, watch the stupid ad again, but low and behold another screen freeze.
B00AOA9BL0,8,17,I can barely every finish a show without turning it off for "not responding".
B00AOA9BL0,8,18,I just watched half of an hour long show, and got to see the same ad about 30 times.
B00AOA9BL0,8,19,Really wanted this to work- tried to watch Hollywood Game Night.
B00AOA9BL0,8,20,I watch Netflix, Amazon Instant Video and HBO GO without any problems.
B00AOA9BL0,8,21,It gets very annoying when one is trying to watch a good movie or show.
B00AOA9BL0,8,22,ok. gives a lot to view but you can only watch what your are paying for on your cable bill.
B00AOA9BL0,8,23,Disappointed that there are so very few, like a handful, of programs or movies to watch unless you have premium cable.
B00AOA9BL0,8,24,Great concept but... Whenever I try to watch something, the program I'm watching will freeze about halfway through the program when it is coming back from a commercial break, and nothing I do to try to get it to let me watch the rest of my program works.
B00AOA9BL0,9,0,Buy a nook
B00AOA9BL0,9,1,Been trying for months and no success.
B00AOA9BL0,9,2,And consider all problems.
B00AOA9BL0,9,3,I so wished I knew about this trouble before my purchase.
B00AOA9BL0,9,4,I'm sure this is a great product.
B00AOA9BL0,9,5,Not a fan of the ads during shows and movies but hey that is why I killed my television 15 years ago.
B00AOA9BL0,9,6,Overall I am happy with it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,7,When I purchased this I did not realize that that was the case.
B00AOA9BL0,9,8,As if the price of cable wasn't enough.
B00AOA9BL0,9,9,I will pay better attention in the future, sorry for any trouble I caused.
B00AOA9BL0,9,10,This could happen once or twice per show or sometimes so often it's not even worth the trouble.
B00AOA9BL0,9,11,Hope will get better.
B00AOA9BL0,9,12,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,9,13,great when it works, frustrating when it doesn't.
B00AOA9BL0,9,14,There are fewer newer showS however there are  more more older series.
B00AOA9BL0,9,15,Seems to function pretty well, just not exactly what I was hoping for.
B00AOA9BL0,9,16,Did not work for me or many others.
B00AOA9BL0,9,17,most people pay full price for cable,comcast gives cable for a much discounted rate subsidazed by all tax payers...plus who wants to see aljazeera while other more domestic stations get rejected by comcast?no,thanks.
B00AOA9BL0,9,18,Must need to purchase something from Amazon to enjoy yet another free app.
B00AOA9BL0,9,19,Kindof a waste considering I was really looking forward to it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,20,Fix these issues and I would gladly give it a 5 but for now it's a 2 1/2 for the inconvenience.
B00AOA9BL0,9,21,Waste of time it is no good should be taken off so no one else wastes their time What a shame
B00AOA9BL0,9,22,Though I am satisfied with my services, the customer service would rate at best a D-, and cost for those services about the same.
B00AOA9BL0,9,23,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,9,24,Its rather disappointing.
B00AOA9BL0,10,0,Otherwise, there is no sound.
B00AOA9BL0,10,1,Sound issue.
B00AOA9BL0,10,2,This is the only way I can hear anything.
B00AOA9BL0,10,3,I can't hear anything and my volume is all the way up.
B00AOA9BL0,10,4,Volume controls are set to low, hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,10,5,If they could fix the sound, I'd give it 5 stars.
B00AOA9BL0,10,6,Volume is toolow even on highest setting.
B00AOA9BL0,10,7,volume is awful!
B00AOA9BL0,10,8,Even when set to the highest level you can barely hear the sound.
B00AOA9BL0,10,9,its okay, but sometimes hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,10,10,Good App, Horrible Sound.
B00AOA9BL0,10,11,The volume used to be an issue.
B00AOA9BL0,10,12,All I can get is sound and when I try to exit the app,I have to turn my kindle all the way off.
B00AOA9BL0,10,13,The volume doesn't get very loud, so I have to hook up speakers to hear shows on xfinity.
B00AOA9BL0,10,14,But to hear sound from app requires the use of earphones.
B00AOA9BL0,10,15,As mentioned by others the volume is very low even with head phones and using external speakers only makes it slightly more of normal  volume level but not really loud so if your hard of hearing or are you are multitasking you may not really hear much.
B00AOA9BL0,10,16,No Volume Control.
B00AOA9BL0,10,17,Otherwise you can't hear it.
B00AOA9BL0,10,18,can't hear anything!
B00AOA9BL0,10,19,sound is a pain.
B00AOA9BL0,10,20,Try to make it work, no dice.
B00AOA9BL0,10,21,And I have good hearing.
B00AOA9BL0,10,22,Also, there are no volume controls on the player and with the volume turned all the way up on the Kindle you can still barely hear anything.
B00AOA9BL0,10,23,The sound being extremely low has been my only complaint until recently.
B00AOA9BL0,10,24,volume too low and needs quick rewind button.
B00AOA9BL0,11,0,Who do I call ?
B00AOA9BL0,11,1,buggy service.
B00AOA9BL0,11,2,never worked.

B00AOA9BL0,11,19,Worked for two weeks then became crappy.
B00AOA9BL0,11,20,Why can't they just email me back and help me out that way?
B00AOA9BL0,11,21,Misleading company.
B00AOA9BL0,11,22,And on the many  phone calls to comcast for tech support, this was never mentioned!
B00AOA9BL0,11,23,Waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,24,Dont waste your storage...or your time.
B00AOA9BL0,12,0,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,1,Like others have said...Good but not great!
B00AOA9BL0,12,2,Good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,3,Neither good nor bad.
B00AOA9BL0,12,4,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,12,5,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,12,6,Screen looks good but stops.
B00AOA9BL0,12,7,Otherwise I'm good with it.
B00AOA9BL0,12,8,not to good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,9,Good App,but...
B00AOA9BL0,12,10,Good picture, bad sound, no choices.
B00AOA9BL0,12,11,used to be good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,12,not good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,13,no good!
B00AOA9BL0,12,14,Still, all in all there is a great variety of shows available.
B00AOA9BL0,12,15,Others looked great.
B00AOA9BL0,12,16,good and bad.
B00AOA9BL0,12,17,Quality is good and there are a ton of shows to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,12,18,When the app does work the picture is crisp and it is a good experience.
B00AOA9BL0,12,19,It was a bit hard to get set up and I had to enlist a younger person to help.
B00AOA9BL0,12,20,VERY BAD.
B00AOA9BL0,12,21,many shoes have no sound!!  would be better if i could watch live tv and every station that i pay for
B00AOA9BL0,12,22,Otherwise, it's a very good player.
B00AOA9BL0,12,23,Now IMHO the way the Featured page is set up makes it almost useless.
B00AOA9BL0,12,24,Too bad.
B00AOA9BL0,13,0,Twp Star Review.
B00AOA9BL0,13,1,Review.
B00AOA9BL0,13,2,I rated it why do I need to write a review?
B00AOA9BL0,13,3,I rated it why do I need to write a review?
B00AOA9BL0,13,4,A review that require me to say more than I wanted to is equally irritating
B00AOA9BL0,13,5,Did not work with my TV.
B00AOA9BL0,13,6,When It Works.
B00AOA9BL0,13,7,I think 3 stars is generous.
B00AOA9BL0,13,8,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,13,9,BEWARE.
B00AOA9BL0,13,10,Wish I could give it 0 stars...
B00AOA9BL0,13,11,Hate this product.
B00AOA9BL0,13,12,Actually my rating is zero stars, it does not work.
B00AOA9BL0,13,13,So jave to give it one star.
B00AOA9BL0,13,14,not recommend it to anyone
B00AOA9BL0,13,15,waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,13,16,I believe this to be unfair and scam to buyers.
B00AOA9BL0,13,17,Would not recommend.
B00AOA9BL0,13,18,I guess my big TV is too old for this product!
B00AOA9BL0,13,19,Who is controlling the shows and networks that are on this?
B00AOA9BL0,13,20,Not recommended unless you live in Philadelphia or some other area they cover.
B00AOA9BL0,13,21,Waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,13,22,Dont waste your storage...or your time.
B00AOA9BL0,13,23,There's nowhere on Amazon to go to get help.
B00AOA9BL0,13,24,keep up with simple requests or billing or simple costumer service.i
B00AOA9BL0,14,0,Ok. Ok app.
B00AOA9BL0,14,1,Fix this app to make it more stable.
B00AOA9BL0,14,2,NOT A GO APP.
B00AOA9BL0,14,3,NEEDS AN UPDATE/NEW APP.
B00AOA9BL0,14,4,This app will not work on my reg.
B00AOA9BL0,14,5,The potential for this app is there.
B00AOA9BL0,14,6,It works.... IT works but that is about all I can say about it.
B00AOA9BL0,14,7,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,8,did not work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,9,It seems to be working now.
B00AOA9BL0,14,10,It stops working.
B00AOA9BL0,14,11,would not work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,12,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,13,It works, BUT...
B00AOA9BL0,14,14,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,15,Does not work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,16,doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,17,Okay--when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,14,18,needs work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,19,If only it worked...
B00AOA9BL0,14,20,not working.
B00AOA9BL0,14,21,Does not work at all.
B00AOA9BL0,14,22,Work on it
B00AOA9BL0,14,23,Other then that it's work well.
B00AOA9BL0,14,24,Wish they'd work this out!
B00AOA9BL0,15,0,Won't change the channel.
B00AOA9BL0,15,1,It works for what I need it for.
B00AOA9BL0,15,2,Huh? I thought that this is cable TV to go.
B00AOA9BL0,15,3,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,15,4,The kicker is that once it starts this, it keeps doing it until you power off the device, wait 10 seconds or so, and then power it back on.
B00AOA9BL0,15,5,On my iPad and iPhone I can change the channel, like a remote or record programs from outside my home.
B00AOA9BL0,15,6,Does not allow HDMI output.
B00AOA9BL0,15,7,The working icon just goes around in circles.
B00AOA9BL0,15,8,I thought I would be able to see some of my science channels and couldn't, it was limited to only a few.
B00AOA9BL0,15,9,Wrong Channel.
B00AOA9BL0,15,10,I would have thought there would be more of a selection of shows.
B00AOA9BL0,15,11,I turned off the parental guard, and I typed Big Brother in the search box.
B00AOA9BL0,15,12,won't even work.
B00AOA9BL0,15,13,Can't get this to work on ASUS MEMO pad HD7.
B00AOA9BL0,15,14,Needs easier playback controls such as a 10 second rewind button.
B00AOA9BL0,15,15,Just wish I could connect to my home dvr.
B00AOA9BL0,15,16,Cool app but if you try to connect to your tv via the cable it stops all video and asks you disconnect cable.
B00AOA9BL0,15,17,Often times just plainly won't work, gives a blank screen that completely stops responding.
B00AOA9BL0,15,18,Hope it would have the same features as on the PC such as viewing videos but alas no.
B00AOA9BL0,15,19,Can only see some of the channels.
B00AOA9BL0,15,20,Volume is toolow even on highest setting.
B00AOA9BL0,15,21,The other main drawback is that it won't allow you to connect the video stream to a TV by HDMI.
B00AOA9BL0,15,22,volume too low and needs quick rewind button.
B00AOA9BL0,15,23,Help, I just bought a new hdtv to connect to my fire hd via hdmi cable, and no shows will play whether connected to the tv or not.
B00AOA9BL0,15,24,The iPad implementation allows one to change channels on every home TV connected in the house and numerous sorts on available programming with integrated DTV programming.
