B0074FGLUM,0,0,Smashed screen.
B0074FGLUM,0,1,Great Screen.
B0074FGLUM,0,2,It's a really nice size and I can't tell the difference between the 40" and 42" in a room the size of a living room.
B0074FGLUM,0,3,Nice!! Great LED screen!
B0074FGLUM,0,4,We've had to change the lighting in our room when viewing.

B0074FGLUM,0,6,The viewing angle is very good from anywhere in the room.
B0074FGLUM,0,7,The picture will run off the screen .
B0074FGLUM,0,8,The Samsung screen is just "glossier".

B0074FGLUM,0,11,I concur it is very nice even in a bright room.
B0074FGLUM,0,12,really good, not quite great.
B0074FGLUM,0,13,Viewing it in a totally dark room I can say the blacks are truly black with very little if any light leak.SOUND:Surprisingly good sound quality for a flat screen.
B0074FGLUM,0,14,The screen is semi-glossy, which I dislike greatly because I can see reflections of myself or the room in darker scenes.
B0074FGLUM,0,15,The Sony screen seemed to absorb light instead of reflecting it.
B0074FGLUM,0,16,Great TV and picture after you get the settings right.
B0074FGLUM,0,17,Nice sharp picture and good color.
B0074FGLUM,0,18,The picture is fantastic in all lighting of the room.
B0074FGLUM,0,19,It is my understanding that this has to do with the placement of the LED lights behind the screen opposed to on the sides of the screen.
B0074FGLUM,0,20,Good but not great.
B0074FGLUM,0,21,The off axis viewing angle is not so good.

B0074FGLUM,6,24,Good picture.
B0074FGLUM,7,0,So all you see after you hook it up are the HDMI cables looping trying to get behind the TV.
B0074FGLUM,7,1,Do away with cable!!
B0074FGLUM,7,2,The HDMI connection with only work with Samsung DVD players, Samsung computers, etc. and will not work for devices using the HDMI cable everyone else in the industry uses.

B0074FGLUM,7,8,It doesn't have an S-VHS port for my old (but cherished) S-VHS video player.
B0074FGLUM,7,9,This can be particularly tricky because the only ports on the TV are HDMI or USB.
B0074FGLUM,7,10,HDMI ports plus a component input.-Price
B0074FGLUM,7,11,I have a wii and an old dvd player so I can only hook up one.
B0074FGLUM,7,12,Good but not great.
B0074FGLUM,7,13,HD picture doesn't look good,  may be I missed some setup.
B0074FGLUM,7,14,Instead one can go for a HD tv and all these can be streamed fron DVD players or any other game devices.
B0074FGLUM,7,15,It works great for this.
B0074FGLUM,7,16,It includes 3 HDMI ports. 1 HDMI port also has an audio port for using with a computer with DVI to HDMI adapter.
B0074FGLUM,7,17,I don't have cable.
B0074FGLUM,7,18,It also only has 1 set of component in port.
B0074FGLUM,7,19,This one only has hdmi and 1 a/v.
B0074FGLUM,7,20,I like the picture quality and the remote features, but after setting it up and connecting it to our antenna the reception has been poor, especially on local channels.
B0074FGLUM,7,21,The sound is not the best but connected to sound on computer it works just fine.
B0074FGLUM,7,22,Connection to the Internet is simple and the picture quality is great.
B0074FGLUM,7,23,We have it connected via a hard connection and are not using the wireless.
B0074FGLUM,7,24,Great TV.
B0074FGLUM,8,0,The tv screen is already showing issues.
B0074FGLUM,8,1,The screen was black and red, with white spiderweb-like lines all over the plasma screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,2,Now there is a 1/4 diameter black circle on the bottom edge of the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,3,Sometimes the screen goes completely black.
B0074FGLUM,8,4,went black on the 29th day.
B0074FGLUM,8,5,Damaged Screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,6,Also the screen has a 3 inch blotch at the bottom that is visible when viewing dark scenes.
B0074FGLUM,8,7,The TV screen is totally shattered!!!!!
B0074FGLUM,8,8,I purchased this TV in September of 2013 and last week the screen went black.
B0074FGLUM,8,9,A large circular space of the screen (top left) and corner of the screen (top right) was totally WHITE.
B0074FGLUM,8,10,the colors are very poor especially when viewed from one side not front.download
B0074FGLUM,8,11,The Dreaded LED Viewing Angle Bugaboo!
B0074FGLUM,8,12,3 months later I have dead pixels and dark lines across the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,13,Brightness problems.
B0074FGLUM,8,14,I thought it was the tv protector so I left it up and I notice the screen Is just popped out from the Tv.
B0074FGLUM,8,15,tv came with the broken screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,16,It's almost imperceptible with a light background, but when the background is dark, it becomes annoyingly prominent.
B0074FGLUM,8,17,had to return it because dead pictel in center of screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,18,Another issue is that the TV makes a humming noise, which I've noticed tends to be loudest when a very bright image is on the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,19,I sit down and turn it on and all I see is a white line on top.
B0074FGLUM,8,20,Two dark spots in the middle of the screen where the backlight was not uniform.
B0074FGLUM,8,21,A solid gray line appeared on the right side of the screen running from top to bottom and about four inches wide.
B0074FGLUM,8,22,I looked at it, and noticed that the screen had been shattered at the top and had spread across half the screen.
B0074FGLUM,8,23,screen dead after one week.
B0074FGLUM,8,24,Was watching a DVD and the screen kept lightening and darkening within seconds over and over - this was at night with the room almost totally dark.
B0074FGLUM,9,0,I only used it for 5 months.
B0074FGLUM,9,1,After 6 months of use Samsung UN40EH5300 stopped working!!
B0074FGLUM,9,2,Only works until right after warranty is out... 1 year, 2 months.
B0074FGLUM,9,3,this tv doses not work in Australia.
B0074FGLUM,9,4,My Samsung TV quit working just after 1 year.
B0074FGLUM,9,5,DO  NOT BUY.
B0074FGLUM,9,6,I will be returning this and never buying a samsung tv again.
B0074FGLUM,9,7,Samsung was really nasty to me about it saying it is out of warranty.
B0074FGLUM,9,8,I purchased this TV just a year and a few months ago and the power is out.
B0074FGLUM,9,9,Samsung UN46E5300.
B0074FGLUM,9,10,I purchased this TV and used it for about a month before returning it.
B0074FGLUM,9,11,TV was great up until two months in.
B0074FGLUM,9,12,I will never buy this Samsung TV again all buy anything from themThey didn't tell us it dose not work in AustraliaBefore we got itAll its good for is the rubbish tipYou think they would of told us now I have to buy a new t
B0074FGLUM,9,13,Never again - I will never buy another Samsung product again.
B0074FGLUM,9,14,I will go with the latter, and will never buy a Samsung product again.
B0074FGLUM,9,15,No problems with this tv after having it near a month.
B0074FGLUM,9,16,Now 2 years later - same problem.
B0074FGLUM,9,17,I bought this TV last year.
B0074FGLUM,9,18,All said, good purchase.
B0074FGLUM,9,19,good purchase.
B0074FGLUM,9,20,Now, however, nothing seems to work.
B0074FGLUM,9,21,Stopped working.
B0074FGLUM,9,22,I only had this tv for a few month and had problems.
B0074FGLUM,9,23,I just retired a 30 year old Panasonic (which still works just fine)  and replaced it with this Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,9,24,I had purchased Samsung UN40EH5300 smart TV almost a month ago.
B0074FGLUM,10,0,Sound quality.
B0074FGLUM,10,1,The sound on this TV was unbearable!
B0074FGLUM,10,2,Cannot control external speaker volume.
B0074FGLUM,10,3,Problems with Speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,4,The TV has an external speaker connection.
B0074FGLUM,10,5,You have to turn it on yourself.
B0074FGLUM,10,6,The problem is that the volume control of the TV does not control the output of the external speaker.
B0074FGLUM,10,7,Using add-on speakers means volume control on remote does not work.
B0074FGLUM,10,8,I tried all the sound menu settings, but never got it to work the way I needed it to.
B0074FGLUM,10,9,The only problem is the speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,10,It is not reinforced along the backbone with bends to keep it from being susceptible to vibrations from the *speaker ports* and wall mounts caused by the lower mounted speakers.
B0074FGLUM,10,11,You have to turn the sound up super-high to hear voices.
B0074FGLUM,10,12,Audio problems.
B0074FGLUM,10,13,So I have no way of muting my external speakers as they are just speakers, they are not a audio receiver unit with a separate remote control.
B0074FGLUM,10,14,The sound is so horrible I am contemplating getting a sound bar.
B0074FGLUM,10,15,Sound quality is fine.
B0074FGLUM,10,16,It is hard to plug in, especially if you have the TV wall mounted.
B0074FGLUM,10,17,The volume variation is one issue.
B0074FGLUM,10,18,Sometimes, I can route the sound to an outside speaker (via my receiver) and sometimes it decides that no all sound must go through the TV,.
B0074FGLUM,10,19,adjust sound when using external speakers.-Single
B0074FGLUM,10,20,Great picture, sound quality is lacking.
B0074FGLUM,10,21,The sound system on this TV is horrible!
B0074FGLUM,10,22,But we have had a problem with the sound on both monitors.
B0074FGLUM,10,23,The picture, sound, build quality, and remote are all what I expected.
B0074FGLUM,10,24,Granted, I could get a sound bar, but shouldn't have to.[b]non
B0074FGLUM,11,0,Samsung Customer Service.
B0074FGLUM,11,1,Samsung customer service is anything but service.
B0074FGLUM,11,2,KNOWN PROBLEM! (BUT) Samsung fixed it!
B0074FGLUM,11,3,Samsung "Customer Service" is no help, so you are on your own.
B0074FGLUM,11,4,Poor customer service.
B0074FGLUM,11,5,Nothing happened so I called again.
B0074FGLUM,11,6,New Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,11,7,update: Called Samsung service.
B0074FGLUM,11,8,So I called Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,11,9,I called Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,11,10,I called Samsung and they outsource their tech support to somewhere in China.
B0074FGLUM,11,11,Very poor customer support lines.
B0074FGLUM,11,12,Well 4 days later I called Samsung customer service and was informed 32 inch t.v.'s must be shipped to be serviced.
B0074FGLUM,11,13,Samsung was really nasty to me about it saying it is out of warranty.
B0074FGLUM,11,14,But nothing samsung support couldn't fix.
B0074FGLUM,11,15,Samsung customer service could not resolve this.
B0074FGLUM,11,16,When I called to have THAT replaced, I was told I had to wait another 2 weeks.
B0074FGLUM,11,17,I waited patiently for 4 days and no calls from them.
B0074FGLUM,11,18,What has happened to SAMSUNG?
B0074FGLUM,11,19,They really know how to treat customers.
B0074FGLUM,11,20,I went through a month of calls to Samsung, called Netflix, called my ISP.
B0074FGLUM,11,21,I know the TV needed a hardware fix and Samsung should've sent someone out to service it, but I could not get any help from their Customer Service.
B0074FGLUM,11,22,I've called support many times.
B0074FGLUM,11,23,I researched and saw that Samsung was the bomb.com
B0074FGLUM,11,24,The service will be in home, not at a service center.
B0074FGLUM,12,0,The picture and color is not very good though.
B0074FGLUM,12,1,PICTURE QUALITY.
B0074FGLUM,12,2,It's great but...
B0074FGLUM,12,3,not a great image.
B0074FGLUM,12,4,Changed the picture settings (following the settings another reviewer suggested) and liked the picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,12,5,I found there to be enough settings to make the adjustments that were needed.
B0074FGLUM,12,6,The picture quality is good.
B0074FGLUM,12,7,Picture quality is good.
B0074FGLUM,12,8,Good TV.
B0074FGLUM,12,9,MAYBE IT CAN BE ADJUSTED.....I DON'T KNOW.
B0074FGLUM,12,10,Good TV at a great price.
B0074FGLUM,12,11,Good quality TV.
B0074FGLUM,12,12,I don't see how people can think the picture quality is good, let alone great.
B0074FGLUM,12,13,Overall good.
B0074FGLUM,12,14,Great picture, great sound, great value.
B0074FGLUM,12,15,Great image and sound.
B0074FGLUM,12,16,This TV is great at displaying TV shows, movies, and all that.
B0074FGLUM,12,17,This TV was easy to set up and has great picture quality.
B0074FGLUM,12,18,Other than this picture quality and everything is very good.
B0074FGLUM,12,19,Great price, and the picture is really good once you get it dialed in using helpful settings from reviews here.
B0074FGLUM,12,20,THE COLORS AREN'T AS BRIGHT AND CLEAR AND I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE.
B0074FGLUM,12,21,i got it set up and then started watching tv, then i started to notice something the sound comes and goes.
B0074FGLUM,12,22,The picture quality is great, no complaints there.
B0074FGLUM,12,23,Picture quality is clear and I used other's settings mentioned on here for the picture adjustments.
B0074FGLUM,12,24,If your using it for TV it seems good  enough and if your like me and your using it also as a monitor then it's fine.
B0074FGLUM,13,0,No more Samsung products for me.
B0074FGLUM,13,1,I will never buy anothey Samsung product and AMAZON  should have a disclaimer with tis information before anyone buys a Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,13,2,Don't buy any Samsung TV's.
B0074FGLUM,13,3,I will never by by this product again.
B0074FGLUM,13,4,Never again - I will never buy another Samsung product again.
B0074FGLUM,13,5,I will go with the latter, and will never buy a Samsung product again.
B0074FGLUM,13,6,Samsung 46EH5300.
B0074FGLUM,13,7,Don't think I will ever buy another Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,13,8,KNOWN PROBLEM! (BUT) Samsung fixed it!
B0074FGLUM,13,9,DO NOT buy this product.
B0074FGLUM,13,10,I think its Samsung.
B0074FGLUM,13,11,First time I've said that about a Samsung product.
B0074FGLUM,13,12,Samsung Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,13,13,BUy something else.
B0074FGLUM,13,14,Review for Samsung UN32EH5300 smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,13,15,I have used many other samsung TVs in my rental cottages ( over 10) and have never had any problems with samsung
B0074FGLUM,13,16,Review of this TV.
B0074FGLUM,13,17,Don't buy.
B0074FGLUM,13,18,If I could do it over again, I'D BUY ANY TV BUT A SAMSUNG SMART TV!
B0074FGLUM,13,19,I own 3 other Samsung TVs with no issues.
B0074FGLUM,13,20,I read many other reviews with the same issue.
B0074FGLUM,13,21,Poor quality.
B0074FGLUM,13,22,Google: Samsung has poor Quality Control before buying!
B0074FGLUM,13,23,Not recommended to purchase this immature product.
B0074FGLUM,13,24,Not what I expected from Samsung... Or is it?!?
B0074FGLUM,14,0,Smart TV vs Chromcast.
B0074FGLUM,14,1,smart tv???
B0074FGLUM,14,2,not very smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,3,not so smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,4,Not smart at all.
B0074FGLUM,14,5,not Smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,6,samsung smart tv not so smart.
B0074FGLUM,14,7,But the "smart" part is really a toy.
B0074FGLUM,14,8,Samsung Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,9,Samsung smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,10,I  still use my chromcast for netflix since its quicker but I use the tv's other apps happily.
B0074FGLUM,14,11,For trying to be a smart TV, it's only 3-stars "smart."
B0074FGLUM,14,12,SMART TV is not really SMART.
B0074FGLUM,14,13,It is not smart at all.
B0074FGLUM,14,14,Netflix app works by the way.
B0074FGLUM,14,15,I've tried using the Smart apps and what not.
B0074FGLUM,14,16,It is not smart enough yet.
B0074FGLUM,14,17,We can not say it is a smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,18,Horray for Smart TV.
B0074FGLUM,14,19,Smart TV???
B0074FGLUM,14,20,The Netflix App had a picture of HBO2Go instead.
B0074FGLUM,14,21,Smart seems to be a misnomer.
B0074FGLUM,14,22,Smart?
B0074FGLUM,14,23,Dont get a samsung tv !!!
B0074FGLUM,14,24,This is the first SMART TV I've owned.
B0074FGLUM,15,0,Remote is still old traditional remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,1,The TV comes with a "remote controller or wand".
B0074FGLUM,15,2,My Cable box also has such a remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,3,This means another remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,4,No universal remote?????
B0074FGLUM,15,5,All HDMI ports don't work.
B0074FGLUM,15,6,Very hard to type using this remote.I like the LG TV remotes.
B0074FGLUM,15,7,This set does not have any control buttons on the actual unit.
B0074FGLUM,15,8,The HDMI connection with only work with Samsung DVD players, Samsung computers, etc. and will not work for devices using the HDMI cable everyone else in the industry uses.
B0074FGLUM,15,9,It has 3 HDMI inputs.
B0074FGLUM,15,10,My DVD I connected with an AV cable I had but could not get it to work.
B0074FGLUM,15,11,Once in the app I am able to use the remote to change channels up and down and directly via the numberpad.
B0074FGLUM,15,12,It works this time.
B0074FGLUM,15,13,I can't believe that this TV doesn't come with a universal remote to control the cable box and other accessories.
B0074FGLUM,15,14,AnyNet+ is nice because I can change the input to my PlayStation 3 with the TV remote, and it will change the input on my Onkyo receiver and turn the PS3 on, and let me control the PS3 with the TV remote.
B0074FGLUM,15,15,As it's a 'smart' TV, why don't you put a small keyboard on remote control?
B0074FGLUM,15,16,Only one button on the TV itself, one button press turns on, but once the unit is on the button brings up a menu and you have to move the button around to navigate this menu.
B0074FGLUM,15,17,Turning off and on a few times seemed to get it back to normal.
B0074FGLUM,15,18,But Samsung skimped on the remote so it's getting 3 stars.
B0074FGLUM,15,19,When powered on, TV will not start in Smart mode, you always have to push the button on the remote to start.-
B0074FGLUM,15,20,When you adjust volume control, change channels, etc the remote gives off a "beep" noise.
B0074FGLUM,15,21,Disappointed in remote control controls could be more intuitive.
B0074FGLUM,15,22,In the end just don't lose the remote and the TV should work great.
B0074FGLUM,15,23,universal remote [/b]Whose idea was it to include a complicated remote but not give it features for cable or a DVD player?
B0074FGLUM,15,24,The set up was so easy, all I had to do was to keep pressing the enter button.
B00BCGROJG,0,0,I mean if you want a good TV with a nice screen get it!!!
B00BCGROJG,0,1,Great TV for the Living Room.
B00BCGROJG,0,2,It looks great In our conference room.
B00BCGROJG,0,3,The screen size is perfect for someone that likes movies.
B00BCGROJG,0,4,In our living room there are off angle seats and you can tell the blacks are not as dark off angle.
B00BCGROJG,0,5,Great TV - Very Thin - Good Value.
B00BCGROJG,0,6,Also, the side viewing angle is not great as screen colors become significantly washed out.
B00BCGROJG,0,7,Good picture.
B00BCGROJG,0,8,3 out of 3 screens had a dead pixel.
B00BCGROJG,0,9,Great flat screen TV.
B00BCGROJG,0,10,Love the Big Screen!
B00BCGROJG,0,11,I think because it's 3D they gave it a nice strong black light and 10 is about where normal viewing should be.
B00BCGROJG,0,12,The screen is quite mirror-like but ok in our room.
B00BCGROJG,0,13,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,0,14,Great bright picture, this tv is in our family room and the tv has no problem in a room with light.2.
B00BCGROJG,0,15,I think I need to tweek the picture on it a little more but it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,0,16,Great TV after Adjustment/Tuning.
B00BCGROJG,0,17,The trade off though, is my plasma has burn in, and didn't look as good as this tv in a bright living room.
B00BCGROJG,0,18,Great brights but the darks are not all that :o( I love this TV BUT my only problem is with dark scenes.
B00BCGROJG,0,19,Brightness is better and washed when viewing at an angle.Other than the viewing angle, the TV is a good buy at $2K.
B00BCGROJG,0,20,The picture is still good, just not as great as when you are in front of it.
B00BCGROJG,0,21,Good.
B00BCGROJG,0,22,very good.
B00BCGROJG,0,23,The tv is very sleek and looks really good with the screen going nearly to the edge.

B00BCGROJG,1,9,Great purchase!
B00BCGROJG,1,10,I love my Samsung TV!!
B00BCGROJG,1,11,This is probably the best TV I've bought ever.
B00BCGROJG,1,12,None of the Sonys we liked were available (2012 models); then, we saw this Samsung for a very good price and decided to buy.
B00BCGROJG,1,13,Great Picture.
B00BCGROJG,1,14,We've always loved Samsung and love this TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,15,Not plasma but very good for LCD LED.
B00BCGROJG,1,16,Samsung has some great TVs.
B00BCGROJG,1,17,Samsung makes the best HD TV at a good price better than Sony and Sharp and all others.
B00BCGROJG,1,18,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,1,19,But it looks great.
B00BCGROJG,1,20,Best TV ever!
B00BCGROJG,1,21,great TV.
B00BCGROJG,1,22,Great price.
B00BCGROJG,1,23,I love it.
B00BCGROJG,1,24,I wanted an LED TV vs. a Plasma, but in the store they both looked great.I've had this UN55F7100 Samsung model for about a week now.
B00BCGROJG,2,0,Great Picture, poor sound.
B00BCGROJG,2,1,Great Picture Quality but not so great sound quality.

B00BCGROJG,2,8,I don't but this is a great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,9,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,10,The TV picture quality is amazing, however the sound quality is really poor.
B00BCGROJG,2,11,Before someone tells me that I shouldn't use tv speakers and should instead use a surround sound system, I get that.
B00BCGROJG,2,12,Great picture, sound, etc....HIGHLY recommend!
B00BCGROJG,2,13,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,14,The sound is not great at all.
B00BCGROJG,2,15,The quality, sound, picture is excellent!
B00BCGROJG,2,16,But the picture quality is great.
B00BCGROJG,2,17,Awesome... Except sound everything is great.
B00BCGROJG,2,18,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,19,Great tv.
B00BCGROJG,2,20,picture is great, sound is OK (but that's why you have a home theater system).
B00BCGROJG,2,21,The sound is acceptable, but an external sound system is really necessary for sound immersion.
B00BCGROJG,2,22,The sound is good, but I'm going to get some speakers for a better audio experience.
B00BCGROJG,2,23,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,2,24,Everything is good.
B00BCGROJG,3,0,Great TV - Not So Great Delivery Service.
B00BCGROJG,3,1,quick delivery.
B00BCGROJG,3,2,There went another $20 on Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,3,I was very skeptical about ordering a tv through Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,3,4,Delivery went unhitched also - a first!
B00BCGROJG,3,5,I ordered it through Amazon, and had a delivery scheduled.

B00BCGROJG,4,15,But once he did get the settings right...the picture is amazing.
B00BCGROJG,4,16,Without his recommendations I would never even have found most of the picture and color settings.
B00BCGROJG,4,17,Great picture quality... leakage of blacks.. First of all.

B00BCGROJG,6,13,Works great on just WIFI.
B00BCGROJG,6,14,love this TV perfect picture, watched our first 3d movie it was great!!! everything we have is samsung and they all work together!
B00BCGROJG,6,15,All I want to do now is watch something on this TV!
B00BCGROJG,6,16,It has great picture, the apps work great, and the sound is is decent (which is all you can ask for on tvs now-a-days).
B00BCGROJG,6,17,Smart TV...is great.
B00BCGROJG,6,18,That seems to work.I love to watch my sports, specifically hockey and with the Stanley Cup Playoffs currently playing, to me it is like watching it Live- Awesome picture.
B00BCGROJG,6,19,Great Smart TV.
B00BCGROJG,6,20,This smart TV is great.
B00BCGROJG,6,21,Love it!
B00BCGROJG,6,22,Love it!
B00BCGROJG,6,23,Love my new tv, the resolution is great and the sound is also great, the only thing would be that i wish i could use google play
B00BCGROJG,6,24,Can't wait to watch a 3D movie.
B00BCGROJG,7,0,Great Picture on HD Channels.
B00BCGROJG,7,1,very good TV great picture.
B00BCGROJG,7,2,I've only watched cable tv so far (via the cable box and HDMI), but I've seen the Samsung GUI and it looks amazing, so I'll be trying that as soon as the tv is connected to the internet.
B00BCGROJG,7,3,Resolution looks amazing, especially while playing video games and watching HD (I wouldn't buy this TV if I didn't have these two).
B00BCGROJG,7,4,I connected them with HDMI cables, while hooking sound system with optical cable directly to TV.
B00BCGROJG,7,5,The HDMI to cable box connection assures a great out of the box picture.
B00BCGROJG,7,6,The blu-ray movie I watched was Despicable me, if you have watched this movie before you would know the cute little minions.
B00BCGROJG,7,7,I had to play with the settings on my tv and xbox to get it working again.
B00BCGROJG,7,8,SO FAR SO GOOD.
B00BCGROJG,7,9,Amazing tv, especially for video games!
B00BCGROJG,7,10,Was plug and play right out of the box.
B00BCGROJG,7,11,Good tv. a lot of good things about this tv.
B00BCGROJG,7,12,I can't plug my Direct TV HDMI cable to the Samsung ARC input and maybe someone on here will be able to steer me to the right direction.
B00BCGROJG,7,13,This is a great TV.
B00BCGROJG,7,14,Amazing TV!!! I'm still playing with this TV but I can tell you that so far I'm in love with it.
B00BCGROJG,7,15,I have home theater system, cable box and DVD and BRay.
B00BCGROJG,7,16,Great Picture Quality but not so great sound quality.
B00BCGROJG,7,17,I have a Samsung surround sound hooked up to it making movies and video games amazing.
B00BCGROJG,7,18,The picture is amazingly clear and perfect on the HD channels.
B00BCGROJG,7,19,I set up each hdmi port specifically for their purpose, TV, Bluray, and 360.
B00BCGROJG,7,20,Great price.
B00BCGROJG,7,21,It works fine now on gaming mode, but I still can't have the numbers come up in diablo 3.  Otherwise the tv works great.
B00BCGROJG,7,22,Beside the HDMI inputs, you can connect only 1 component video source OR 1 composite video source, not both at the same time.
B00BCGROJG,7,23,I tested this TV by playing a blu-ray, a dvd and a videogame.
B00BCGROJG,7,24,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,8,0,This is the brightest and clearest viewing screen that you will ever view.
B00BCGROJG,8,1,Defective screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,2,When he saw the screen he said they should not be this bad and I got a bad panel.
B00BCGROJG,8,3,Perfect screen with lighting issue gone!
B00BCGROJG,8,4,But when vertical bars radiate from  the bottom on a Macbook, it means the LED screen or bar at the bottom of the screen is going bad.
B00BCGROJG,8,5,Again, 4 red stuck pixels on the screen, and some pinkish hue to only the right side of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,6,The first set I took home had 6 - 8 gray bard radiating up vertically from top to bottom whenever the screen was black or letter-boxed -- VERY disturbing.
B00BCGROJG,8,7,This time, I had them set up the TV on the floor and look at both screens side by side.
B00BCGROJG,8,8,Very noticeable in dark scenes.
B00BCGROJG,8,9,Picture is dark.
B00BCGROJG,8,10,If you watch a movie with a lot of blacks, dark scenes, you will notice a significant amount of white clouding in the blacked out areas.
B00BCGROJG,8,11,most annoying aspect is that the screen has from time to time gone dark -- not completely dark but the brightness is only about a quarter of normal.
B00BCGROJG,8,12,When on a totally black screen there is what I guess they call "clouding" near the 4 corners but mainly the left side top and bottom.
B00BCGROJG,8,13,Furthermore, room lighting must be nearly dark to notice this flaw.
B00BCGROJG,8,14,After a day, noticed fluorescent green lines at the edge of face or bright objects and more noticeable at the left half of the screen.
B00BCGROJG,8,15,It's not the settings themselves that has the issue.
B00BCGROJG,8,16,Nothing that will ever show the darkness flaws on the screen.Bottom Line: If you watch TV in a lit room, and don't watch dark movies like "The Dark Knight", "The Purge", "Star Trek into Darkness", or any movie with a prolonged dark scene, then get it.If you want see an perfectly amazing dark picture from a TV that retails for $5,000.
B00BCGROJG,8,17,Once we got into watching DARK movies in a DARK room, we quickly realized that "CLOUDING" and "FLASH LIGHTING" was going to be an issue.
B00BCGROJG,8,18,The last tv panel was so bad it looked like I was watching movies through cloud cover....clouds that didn't move!!
B00BCGROJG,8,19,Since the screen on the self diagnostic  picture is completely full of color, the problem did not appear.
B00BCGROJG,8,20,The left side of the screen seems slightly brighter than the right when viewing a black screen.....it does not appear to affect the picture when watching content - but just worth mentioning.3)
B00BCGROJG,8,21,This set has a terrible side viewing angle.
B00BCGROJG,8,22,But this panel up close shows what appears to be black pressure point patches on the top left, top center, and top right corner.
B00BCGROJG,8,23,Immediately noticed 2 red stuck pixels on the screen and some clouding in upper right and lower left sides of the TV.
B00BCGROJG,8,24,white clouding on the lower left hand if the screen, visible only when the image is perfectly black.
B00BCGROJG,9,0,Do not buy Samsung!!
B00BCGROJG,9,1,Last Samsung purchase.
B00BCGROJG,9,2,it works.
B00BCGROJG,9,3,For 58.00 more you now have a 5 year warranty.
B00BCGROJG,9,4,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,9,5,I have now had this TV for about 2 months and it works great.
B00BCGROJG,9,6,Samsung 65 in.
B00BCGROJG,9,7,Buy a set for a 1000.00
B00BCGROJG,9,8,Dont buy Samsung - they don't last.
B00BCGROJG,9,9,Great picture/dead in 3 months.
B00BCGROJG,9,10,Now 2 years later - same problem.
B00BCGROJG,9,11,*****W A R N I N G*****Do not buy SAMSUNG Televisions!!!
B00BCGROJG,9,12,Having Problems.
B00BCGROJG,9,13,Television never worked from day one.
B00BCGROJG,9,14,I made the mistake of not starting with Samsung when the problems first stared a year ago.Random turning itself off.
B00BCGROJG,9,15,We vowed NEVER to get another Samsung again.
B00BCGROJG,9,16,Problem with my set.
B00BCGROJG,9,17,TV was purchased for an 85 year old.
B00BCGROJG,9,18,My first 2 Vizio TV's are still working fine and one is over 5 years old.
B00BCGROJG,9,19,BUYING A SAMSUNG IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
B00BCGROJG,9,20,BUYING A SAMSUNG IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
B00BCGROJG,9,21,I purchased a large and expensive Samsung LED TV from Amazon.
B00BCGROJG,9,22,did not buy via Amazon but have had it a couple of months.
B00BCGROJG,9,23,I am having issues with a 14 month old Samsung that cost $3000.It is a 65" LCD LED 3 D Samsung.I am in the Costco extended warranty.
B00BCGROJG,9,24,DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!!
B00BCGROJG,10,0,Sound quality is good too.
B00BCGROJG,10,1,every time when i turn on the TV, the sound bar is turned on automatically.
B00BCGROJG,10,2,Sound is OK and the TV has a few different sound settings but nothing special.
B00BCGROJG,10,3,picture is great, sound is OK (but that's why you have a home theater system).
B00BCGROJG,10,4,Once it turned off by itself.
B00BCGROJG,10,5,The sound is not as bad as some reviewers say, at least for me, but I will be purchasing speakers later simply because that's what they're for!
B00BCGROJG,10,6,Great Picture Quality but not so great sound quality.
B00BCGROJG,10,7,I then cycled through the various settings and things changed for the better.Sound quality, while not great, was still much better than expected.
B00BCGROJG,10,8,Unit can be hung using the Samsung cable system mount without any issues.
B00BCGROJG,10,9,Sound quality of the LG was great.
B00BCGROJG,10,10,The sound is acceptable, but an external sound system is really necessary for sound immersion.
B00BCGROJG,10,11,If mounted on the wall the sound will be better as it will reflect.
B00BCGROJG,10,12,The apps on the TV cannot give you 5.1 sound because the output must go from your cable (or satellite) box to the home theater system, not from the digital audio out from the TV.
B00BCGROJG,10,13,Clear picture, and great sound even without sound system.
B00BCGROJG,10,14,Also, this TV is not hooked up to a audio receiver, we are using the built in speakers and it sounds good.
B00BCGROJG,10,15,Setup is quite easy; you assemble the stand parts (2) with 4 *very tiny* screws, and then attach the stand to the TV with yet another 4 of the same screws.
B00BCGROJG,10,16,Get a sound bar... huge difference!
B00BCGROJG,10,17,A small annoying thing that I still don't know if there's a fix for is that "dink" noise that the volume control makes.
B00BCGROJG,10,18,Also, the sound/picture sync adjustment is not effective when you use the audio optical output, just the sound that is output through the HDMI connection.The inputs for older equipment are limited.
B00BCGROJG,10,19,The sound is good, but I'm going to get some speakers for a better audio experience.
B00BCGROJG,10,20,If you messed it up and the TV is not working properly, don't work hard and take it of the wall (like I did).
B00BCGROJG,10,21,The screws supplied would not work with the base.
B00BCGROJG,10,22,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,10,23,Before someone tells me that I shouldn't use tv speakers and should instead use a surround sound system, I get that.
B00BCGROJG,10,24,Getting the contrast right was the most difficult issue.The tv has a digital optical audio output for audio receivers that do not have HDMI inputs.
B00BCGROJG,11,0,I called Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,11,1,If it becomes toast like my Samsung you still win.
B00BCGROJG,11,2,I have had tremendous success with Samsung and Amazon's service has always been good to me.
B00BCGROJG,11,3,Boo Samsung, boo!
B00BCGROJG,11,4,Customer service was no help.
B00BCGROJG,11,5,Called Samsung and we had service scheduled.
B00BCGROJG,11,6,Samsung customer service is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced.
B00BCGROJG,11,7,Pray that you don't have any problems with it.
B00BCGROJG,11,8,TV great, customer service not so much.
B00BCGROJG,11,9,Samsung customer service wasn't very helpful in acknowledging the problem.
B00BCGROJG,11,10,Dont buy Samsung - they don't last.
B00BCGROJG,11,11,I called Samsung to exchange them.
B00BCGROJG,11,12,I have had the TV for a week now and am still waiting on repair.
B00BCGROJG,11,13,After more than 2 hours on the call I got them to assign the ticket to a new customer service center.
B00BCGROJG,11,14,Well you betcha I have problems.
B00BCGROJG,11,15,I contacted Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,11,16,Then they will really try to screw you and nopt service or replace the TV.
B00BCGROJG,11,17,She finally concluded that I need to have the set serviced.
B00BCGROJG,11,18,They will not replace them under warranty and say they are normal.
B00BCGROJG,11,19,Last Samsung I will ever buy.
B00BCGROJG,11,20,I do not want this repaired.
B00BCGROJG,11,21,This is horrible service!
B00BCGROJG,11,22,2000.00 to repair.
B00BCGROJG,11,23,So she said she would have someone from tech support (or some such department) call me.
B00BCGROJG,11,24,Call Samsung and have them replace the panel or live with it.
B00BCGROJG,12,0,Great TV, but be alerted...
B00BCGROJG,12,1,great!
B00BCGROJG,12,2,Very good Quality Tv.
B00BCGROJG,12,3,I came along at least a very good thing.
B00BCGROJG,12,4,Then I went into setting and made set it to default.
B00BCGROJG,12,5,Good things come in without a problem like this.
B00BCGROJG,12,6,Problem with my set.
B00BCGROJG,12,7,I did not know how to getrid of that for the first movie we watched except to set to "movie" mode instead of standard.
B00BCGROJG,12,8,Good tv.
B00BCGROJG,12,9,There are many, many settings that affect brightness, many settings that affect color balance, etc... so even the last few settings will make a big difference to how the picture looks.
B00BCGROJG,12,10,Great tv!
B00BCGROJG,12,11,Nice tv, good brightness and colors.
B00BCGROJG,12,12,great but.
B00BCGROJG,12,13,I will look into it and I am sure that I can re-adjust a setting to fix this issue.
B00BCGROJG,12,14,Picture settings.
B00BCGROJG,12,15,Great TV.
B00BCGROJG,12,16,I have seen this set hooked up at Best Buy and it was very good so I am thinking it was just this set.
B00BCGROJG,12,17,The blu-ray movie I watched was Despicable me, if you have watched this movie before you would know the cute little minions.
B00BCGROJG,12,18,TV looked fine and set up nice.
B00BCGROJG,12,19,Looks good sounds good all around great set .
B00BCGROJG,12,20,Watching TV is very sharp, clear.
B00BCGROJG,12,21,The picture quality of this television out of the box is good - but the default settings are atrocious!
B00BCGROJG,12,22,It's not the settings themselves that has the issue.
B00BCGROJG,12,23,Its great for outdoor scenery & sports.
B00BCGROJG,12,24,The picture quality is great, just be sure to shut off all the different motion settings.
B00BCGROJG,13,0,Samsung UN65F7100 review.
B00BCGROJG,13,1,Samsung TV purchased.
B00BCGROJG,13,2,Last Samsung I will ever buy.
B00BCGROJG,13,3,*****W A R N I N G*****Do not buy SAMSUNG Televisions!!!
B00BCGROJG,13,4,Besides that I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a new TV
B00BCGROJG,13,5,Beware before buying.
B00BCGROJG,13,6,I almost did not buy this TV after reading some of the 5-star reviews!
B00BCGROJG,13,7,If I have any problems I will update this review.
B00BCGROJG,13,8,I have a few Samsung products including this TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,9,Review for Samsung UN75F7100  75" LED TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,10,Samsung also needs to get it's quality control better.
B00BCGROJG,13,11,Samsung LED Products Suffer huge Clouding/Flashlighting Problems.
B00BCGROJG,13,12,Samsung LED Products Suffer huge Clouding/Flashlighting Problems.
B00BCGROJG,13,13,Overall, I am disappointed with amazon and Samsung and I wouldn't recommend either of them.Regards,DD
B00BCGROJG,13,14,Samsung phone/tablet division needs to take over it's TV division's software quality control.Don't buy this TV for it's smarts ... it really is NOT smart & very sluggish (slow) if you to do anything of substance on the web.Potentially a great product ... but Samsung TV division needs to fix its software quality control problems.
B00BCGROJG,13,15,I would definitely buy it again and recommend it, but they need a redesign on their remote.
B00BCGROJG,13,16,I will revise this review once I get the TV.
B00BCGROJG,13,17,And I had to write a review!The picture quality on this tv is unsurpassed!
B00BCGROJG,13,18,I'm not going to buy a product from a company that so blatantly discriminates against older people.
B00BCGROJG,13,19,We purchased this TV in September 2013.
B00BCGROJG,13,20,Good product - horrid support.
B00BCGROJG,13,21,By all means buy this TV but DO NOT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THE ALLSHARE 'SOFTWARE PRODUCT'!
B00BCGROJG,13,22,Props to Samsung and their quality control.
B00BCGROJG,13,23,I will look into it and I am sure that I can re-adjust a setting to fix this issue.
B00BCGROJG,13,24,Definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a new TV
B00BCGROJG,14,0,bottom-line is this smart TV just like a Not-Smart-TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,1,The smart TV app?
B00BCGROJG,14,2,This if forgivable as you DO NOT WANT TO USE THEIR SMART TV anyway if you can.
B00BCGROJG,14,3,wireless is not work.
B00BCGROJG,14,4,There does seem to be a "flow" problem with the SMART tv at times.
B00BCGROJG,14,5,The internet apps (Netflix and Hulu) work great.
B00BCGROJG,14,6,The same problem was found on the Amazon App in the Smart Hub but not as bad.
B00BCGROJG,14,7,Getting back to the Smart Hub.
B00BCGROJG,14,8,At the same times apps like netflix and amazon will be reset.
B00BCGROJG,14,9,Micro-dimming feature and smart hub are great features.
B00BCGROJG,14,10,Previews are available on like 10 different apps.
B00BCGROJG,14,11,Not too smart.
B00BCGROJG,14,12,I get a network error watching Netflix and Hulu, but I use the Plex app most of all.
B00BCGROJG,14,13,i couldn't use the Wi-fi to watch the internet TV.
B00BCGROJG,14,14,The is a smart TV. 5 star for the TV part. 1 start for "smart" part.
B00BCGROJG,14,15,Unlike some smart TV's it has a browser that you can go anywhere on the internet that you can like a smart phone.
B00BCGROJG,14,16,I also found that every app in the Smart Hub was very fast and did not cause me to become impatient.
B00BCGROJG,14,17,Netflix, Amazon, and Youtube work as expected.
B00BCGROJG,14,18,You can see so clearly it's scary sometimes!The SMART Apps are okay.
B00BCGROJG,14,19,Samsung.
B00BCGROJG,14,20,Apps can't be reorganized.
B00BCGROJG,14,21,I think that if I don't want an app, I should be able to de-install it.
B00BCGROJG,14,22,The only differences are the different smart hub, and the remotes.
B00BCGROJG,14,23,this TV wireless connection is very bad.
B00BCGROJG,14,24,The YouTube app is much slower than my laptop and they are both using the same wireless network.
B00BCGROJG,15,0,The remote control is a little funky and takes time getting used to.
B00BCGROJG,15,1,It cannot be used to select a channel from the guide--I have to use my cable box remote to select channels.
B00BCGROJG,15,2,The remote, however, is dysfunctional.
B00BCGROJG,15,3,I didn't see any.I will say that the remote takes some getting used to.
B00BCGROJG,15,4,would anyone need 4 HDMI inputs?
B00BCGROJG,15,5,There aren't any buttons!
B00BCGROJG,15,6,If there is one thing that I dislike, it is the remote control.
B00BCGROJG,15,7,The only thing I don't like is the remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,8,Instead you have to press the “more” button on the remote that will give you a virtual remote on the screen that will let you change to a specific channel.
B00BCGROJG,15,9,It would be nice, though, to have these buttons on the remote.-
B00BCGROJG,15,10,All HDMI ports don't work.
B00BCGROJG,15,11,You will need to use a universal remote (making sure you disable the powering on from the remote as the TV will do this on it's own) or the receiver remote to change the receiver input back to the correct device.
B00BCGROJG,15,12,I like and use the tv remote sometimes paired with the cable remote but my wife is strictly a cable remote user.
B00BCGROJG,15,13,The only issue i really have is the remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,14,Intuitive.The remote with a touch pad works okay.
B00BCGROJG,15,15,Smart Touch remote - ok but a little limited as you may still need to use a second remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,16,But tv works well overall.
B00BCGROJG,15,17,I would recommend using your cable box remote or a universal remote.
B00BCGROJG,15,18,Only in the remote did not find the mute button, that is more important to have it.
B00BCGROJG,15,19,Sorry, doesn't work.
B00BCGROJG,15,20,Could Samsung simplify the remote by not using the swype pad?
B00BCGROJG,15,21,I'd rather have buttons.
B00BCGROJG,15,22,REMOTE PROBLEMS NOT CLEAR ON BATTER REPLACEMET !
B00BCGROJG,15,23,I'll probably get a universal remote with keys.
B00BCGROJG,15,24,Well, gee, that's what I thought a TV with a remote should do.
B00AOA9BL0,0,0,Screen looks good but stops.
B00AOA9BL0,0,1,Watching on  such a small screen does.
B00AOA9BL0,0,2,Great.
B00AOA9BL0,0,3,good.
B00AOA9BL0,0,4,Works great!
B00AOA9BL0,0,5,Works Great on My Ipod.
B00AOA9BL0,0,6,Sitting on my back porch watching missed TV shows its nice.
B00AOA9BL0,0,7,Shows the bitrate on some movies right in the middle of the screen.
B00AOA9BL0,0,8,I watched the Dark Shadow movie the other day and it was good.
B00AOA9BL0,0,9,I do wish you could attach to a tv to watch on bigger screen.
B00AOA9BL0,0,10,Any time I can take CNN to the bathroom is a good thing.
B00AOA9BL0,0,11,I'm on the go.Now i can watch TV on the go.
B00AOA9BL0,0,12,almost perfect.
B00AOA9BL0,0,13,Great if you'd like to watch aTV show on your 5 inch screen, better if you had a kindle.
B00AOA9BL0,0,14,I love watching TV while I am using the treadmill but we have no TV in the exercise room.
B00AOA9BL0,0,15,Better!
B00AOA9BL0,0,16,On the minus side, there must be a better a way to sort through shows especially alphabetically.
B00AOA9BL0,0,17,i want watch walking dead while eating corn on the cob at the inlaws in Londrina Brasil.
B00AOA9BL0,0,18,Being able to watch some shows live being away from home is great also.
B00AOA9BL0,0,19,only one big concern.
B00AOA9BL0,0,20,Would be great if it didn't freeze up all the time!
B00AOA9BL0,0,21,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,0,22,I don't miss a thing.
B00AOA9BL0,0,23,Don't bother unless you have a larger device unless you'd like to watch TV on a little screen as it doesn't fill the entire screen with the show.Hope that this helps.Time to uninstall.
B00AOA9BL0,0,24,It gets very annoying when one is trying to watch a good movie or show.
B00AOA9BL0,1,0,Best around.
B00AOA9BL0,1,1,I love to bookmark my faves and just veg out and get caught up on my shows.
B00AOA9BL0,1,2,It's free is the only good thing that I didn't buy it.
B00AOA9BL0,1,3,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,1,4,Good!
B00AOA9BL0,1,5,Doesn't get much better than that.
B00AOA9BL0,1,6,Overall I am happy with it.
B00AOA9BL0,1,7,Been trying for months and no success.
B00AOA9BL0,1,8,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,1,9,That would be even better.
B00AOA9BL0,1,10,Doesn't get any better.
B00AOA9BL0,1,11,Other than that it's got good shows and I love it
B00AOA9BL0,1,12,Love being able to take what I pay for where ever I go.
B00AOA9BL0,1,13,Good but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,1,14,It's good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,1,15,good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,1,16,good, but long way from great.
B00AOA9BL0,1,17,My family has been using it for years.
B00AOA9BL0,1,18,For the most part it is a great one stop shop for channels.
B00AOA9BL0,1,19,Like others have said...Good but not great!
B00AOA9BL0,1,20,Awesome!!!
B00AOA9BL0,1,21,A Good Player.
B00AOA9BL0,1,22,family loves it now has CC so i can use it too.
B00AOA9BL0,1,23,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,1,24,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,2,0,Otherwise, there is no sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,1,The picture and sound were both great.
B00AOA9BL0,2,2,Not hard when there are no other sounds around though.
B00AOA9BL0,2,3,Its good, not great.
B00AOA9BL0,2,4,Great quality.
B00AOA9BL0,2,5,great but.
B00AOA9BL0,2,6,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,7,sound is better.
B00AOA9BL0,2,8,The sound is good with headphones.
B00AOA9BL0,2,9,Picture is great  but I cannot hear the audio  very dissappointed .
B00AOA9BL0,2,10,The last one I had was very low and I never went on it much because of the sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,11,Good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,12,good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,13,Overall good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,14,good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,15,Sound issue.
B00AOA9BL0,2,16,Good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,2,17,Pretty good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,18,Thanks for big sound.
B00AOA9BL0,2,19,pretty good.
B00AOA9BL0,2,20,Would be great if it worked.
B00AOA9BL0,2,21,Sound more than occasionally would be good too.
B00AOA9BL0,2,22,Overall good value.
B00AOA9BL0,2,23,It's a good way to watch when there is no tv around.
B00AOA9BL0,2,24,Good experience.
B00AOA9BL0,3,0,never worked.
B00AOA9BL0,3,1,Did not work with my TV.
B00AOA9BL0,3,2,Would be great if it worked.
B00AOA9BL0,3,3,Worked great for about a week.
B00AOA9BL0,3,4,There's nowhere on Amazon to go to get help.
B00AOA9BL0,3,5,So far it's really great.
B00AOA9BL0,3,6,worked great at first.
B00AOA9BL0,3,7,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,3,8,Good day, Sir.
B00AOA9BL0,3,9,how come it doesn't work on.the
B00AOA9BL0,3,10,who knows why either, as Amazon.
B00AOA9BL0,3,11,It does not work with all the boxes in the house.
B00AOA9BL0,3,12,That's one less homework assignment when you arrive home.
B00AOA9BL0,3,13,Good. no problems yet.
B00AOA9BL0,3,14,YOU GUYS NEED TO WORK ON IT.
B00AOA9BL0,3,15,Also tried them at Starbucks, didn't really work there.
B00AOA9BL0,3,16,Who do I call ?
B00AOA9BL0,3,17,Called amazon, Comcast, no help.
B00AOA9BL0,3,18,But free is good.
B00AOA9BL0,3,19,Maybe one day it will.
B00AOA9BL0,3,20,hasn't worked and still trying.
B00AOA9BL0,3,21,serviceable.
B00AOA9BL0,3,22,Works perfectly with excellent picture.
B00AOA9BL0,3,23,it has tried and failed several times times.
B00AOA9BL0,3,24,So it works great about 90% of the time, and I really like it.
B00AOA9BL0,4,0,Easy to use
B00AOA9BL0,4,1,Ok but not great.
B00AOA9BL0,4,2,Watching movies is great!
B00AOA9BL0,4,3,great for watching shows on the go.

B00AOA9BL0,4,13,Easy navigation.
B00AOA9BL0,4,14,Not Easy.
B00AOA9BL0,4,15,You need to go to settings menu and monkey around and then it will work.
B00AOA9BL0,4,16,nice layout and easy to use.
B00AOA9BL0,4,17,Easy to use and navigate, I just wish I could get ppv on it.

B00AOA9BL0,5,0,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,5,1,no good!
B00AOA9BL0,5,2,Like others have said...Good but not great!
B00AOA9BL0,5,3,Has some good features.
B00AOA9BL0,5,4,I'm sure this is a great product.
B00AOA9BL0,5,5,Other than that it's a very good thing to have.
B00AOA9BL0,5,6,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,5,7,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,5,8,It's great when I'm not at home
B00AOA9BL0,5,9,Review.
B00AOA9BL0,5,10,I rated it why do I need to write a review?
B00AOA9BL0,5,11,I rated it why do I need to write a review?
B00AOA9BL0,5,12,It's good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,5,13,If I could rate this a zero I would so I rate as a one!
B00AOA9BL0,5,14,Good but definitely needs more live tv.
B00AOA9BL0,5,15,But I have good reason now.
B00AOA9BL0,5,16,No good it should be pulled it is no good.
B00AOA9BL0,5,17,Otherwise good picture quality and user friendly.
B00AOA9BL0,5,18,good but could be better.
B00AOA9BL0,5,19,The only reason I gave it one star is because I could not  give it a no star rating.
B00AOA9BL0,5,20,good, but long way from great.
B00AOA9BL0,5,21,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,5,22,not what I wantednot how I wanted itI wouldnt recommend it to everyoneit cost too much money
B00AOA9BL0,5,23,Picture quality is good.
B00AOA9BL0,5,24,was great.
B00AOA9BL0,6,0,I like this app!
B00AOA9BL0,6,1,Otherwise, the app is okay.
B00AOA9BL0,6,2,What has happened to this app?
B00AOA9BL0,6,3,Ok. Ok app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,4,Cannot use app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,5,I like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,6,NOT A GO APP.
B00AOA9BL0,6,7,I really like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,8,NEEDS AN UPDATE/NEW APP.
B00AOA9BL0,6,9,I would like to see these incorporated into this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,10,Must have app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,11,The potential for this app is there.
B00AOA9BL0,6,12,gGood app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,13,Using this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,14,I like this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,15,This app will not work on my reg.
B00AOA9BL0,6,16,This app works very well.
B00AOA9BL0,6,17,This app doesn't work at all!
B00AOA9BL0,6,18,I like the app and usually it works.
B00AOA9BL0,6,19,You also need an ID to get into the app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,20,I wasn't able to get into this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,21,Well keep using this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,22,So far I really dig this app.
B00AOA9BL0,6,23,Please patch this app with a fix!
B00AOA9BL0,6,24,this app is borked.
B00AOA9BL0,7,0,No HDMI out...boo!
B00AOA9BL0,7,1,If I wanted to watch it at home I would use the cable box.
B00AOA9BL0,7,2,The quality it'snot hd and mightnot translate well if you connect it to your tv but it did fine on the device.
B00AOA9BL0,7,3,As if the price of cable wasn't enough.
B00AOA9BL0,7,4,Netflix has HDMI out.
B00AOA9BL0,7,5,The movies are great.
B00AOA9BL0,7,6,Good.
B00AOA9BL0,7,7,Cable went out during a recent ice storm.
B00AOA9BL0,7,8,Help, I just bought a new hdtv to connect to my fire hd via hdmi cable, and no shows will play whether connected to the tv or not.
B00AOA9BL0,7,9,Goes to 5 stars with the HDMI out working.
B00AOA9BL0,7,10,Best to have a good internet connection.
B00AOA9BL0,7,11,When it works it is good.
B00AOA9BL0,7,12,Otherwise, it's a very good player.
B00AOA9BL0,7,13,I was able to watch ONE video and the same thing happened again.
B00AOA9BL0,7,14,The HD quality is superb.
B00AOA9BL0,7,15,You can watch tv and movies which isn't at all what I wanted.
B00AOA9BL0,7,16,works great.
B00AOA9BL0,7,17,Can only see some of the channels.
B00AOA9BL0,7,18,Great ap.
B00AOA9BL0,7,19,I get shows I could  not get on Netflix with good reception, and clear video.
B00AOA9BL0,7,20,If anyone can make the video player actually work as described, please let me know!
B00AOA9BL0,7,21,Are all channels not available?
B00AOA9BL0,7,22,Does not allow HDMI output.
B00AOA9BL0,7,23,Just wish I could connect to my home dvr.
B00AOA9BL0,7,24,It works for what I need it for.
B00AOA9BL0,8,0,Gotta get these problems fixed or no one will want it!!
B00AOA9BL0,8,1,There is a green bar at the top of your screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,2,Really wanted this to work- tried to watch Hollywood Game Night.
B00AOA9BL0,8,3,When you close out and start back up it should bring you to a home screen instead of where you left off..
B00AOA9BL0,8,4,First show there were a few times it stopped and then started.
B00AOA9BL0,8,5,Only works part time.
B00AOA9BL0,8,6,TOO MANY IMAGES OPEN.
B00AOA9BL0,8,7,Watching on  such a small screen does.
B00AOA9BL0,8,8,I watched the Dark Shadow movie the other day and it was good.
B00AOA9BL0,8,9,Have to keep moving slide bar on time left in program.
B00AOA9BL0,8,10,Shows the bitrate on some movies right in the middle of the screen.
B00AOA9BL0,8,11,Out of the 20+ times I've tried this, maybe 3 or 4 times I was actually able to watch something.
B00AOA9BL0,8,12,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,8,13,AND HOW DO YOU CLOSE THE NUMEROUS IMAGES?
B00AOA9BL0,8,14,Started off great, but as weeks went by, there was less & I was able to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,8,15,On the Xmas version of Hollywood Game Night ~ it kept starting and stopping and finally stopped completely.
B00AOA9BL0,8,16,It gets very annoying when one is trying to watch a good movie or show.
B00AOA9BL0,8,17,The only problem that I have with this is the fact that there are only about 10-15 channels that you can watch live.
B00AOA9BL0,8,18,Been having a lot of issues with tv shows an  movies not playing.
B00AOA9BL0,8,19,I constantly get a pop up message telling me too many images open.
B00AOA9BL0,8,20,Great concept but... Whenever I try to watch something, the program I'm watching will freeze about halfway through the program when it is coming back from a commercial break, and nothing I do to try to get it to let me watch the rest of my program works.
B00AOA9BL0,8,21,Well it came that way I didn't open them but it doesn't say how to close them!!!also this pops up *.53.Amazon.com
B00AOA9BL0,8,22,Fade in fade out.
B00AOA9BL0,8,23,This worked immediately for watching NBC sports, I'm a hockey fan.
B00AOA9BL0,8,24,It also has problems with &#34;playback&#34;... all together annoying '': \
B00AOA9BL0,9,0,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,9,1,Buy a nook
B00AOA9BL0,9,2,Thankfully, after almost a year they FINALLY fixed that problem!More.recently,
B00AOA9BL0,9,3,This has never worked in the 5 months I have it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,4,Had It 5 Months- Never Worked.
B00AOA9BL0,9,5,Works Fine.
B00AOA9BL0,9,6,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,9,7,I have a tech come out every other month for 4 years and my garbage signal has yet to be fixed.
B00AOA9BL0,9,8,I watched a couple of shows with no problems.
B00AOA9BL0,9,9,I've had this for a few months now and it has never worked once.
B00AOA9BL0,9,10,I so wished I knew about this trouble before my purchase.
B00AOA9BL0,9,11,Waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,12,Dont waste your storage...or your time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,13,So it works great about 90% of the time, and I really like it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,14,Works great most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,15,When it works, it works fine.
B00AOA9BL0,9,16,only works about half the time.
B00AOA9BL0,9,17,Worked great for about a week.
B00AOA9BL0,9,18,It works.... IT works but that is about all I can say about it.
B00AOA9BL0,9,19,Must need to purchase something from Amazon to enjoy yet another free app.
B00AOA9BL0,9,20,Started off great, but as weeks went by, there was less & I was able to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,9,21,Other than that I am happy.
B00AOA9BL0,9,22,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,9,23,It would start to but just stop cold after the 7 second  mark.
B00AOA9BL0,9,24,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,10,0,Volume controls are set to low, hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,10,1,I can't hear anything and my volume is all the way up.
B00AOA9BL0,10,2,volume.
B00AOA9BL0,10,3,Volume.
B00AOA9BL0,10,4,Try to make it work, no dice.
B00AOA9BL0,10,5,its okay, but sometimes hard to hear.
B00AOA9BL0,10,6,If they could fix the sound, I'd give it 5 stars.
B00AOA9BL0,10,7,various channels have different volume settings and is difficult toadjust sound properly.
B00AOA9BL0,10,8,The only way to adjust is with the headset volume control.
B00AOA9BL0,10,9,volume is awful!
B00AOA9BL0,10,10,This app has no volume control and the audio track volume is so low I can't hear it clearly even with headphones!
B00AOA9BL0,10,11,The volume doesn't get very loud, so I have to hook up speakers to hear shows on xfinity.
B00AOA9BL0,10,12,BUT desperately need volume button.
B00AOA9BL0,10,13,needs volume button.
B00AOA9BL0,10,14,With out headphones it is quite hard to hear.That's the only bad thing.
B00AOA9BL0,10,15,And I have good hearing.
B00AOA9BL0,10,16,Great so.
B00AOA9BL0,10,17,volume too low and needs quick rewind button.
B00AOA9BL0,10,18,Good App, Horrible Sound.
B00AOA9BL0,10,19,can't hear anything!
B00AOA9BL0,10,20,Needs work.
B00AOA9BL0,10,21,Needs a volume control on the app itself.
B00AOA9BL0,10,22,Also the volume control on this app is quite low and have to have headphones on in order to hear it clearly.
B00AOA9BL0,10,23,Even when set to the highest level you can barely hear the sound.
B00AOA9BL0,10,24,The only thing I do not like about this app is there is no volume control.
B00AOA9BL0,11,0,I think that's what they called it?
B00AOA9BL0,11,1,Terrible customer service
B00AOA9BL0,11,2,Tried this 3 or 4 time over 2 days.
B00AOA9BL0,11,3,Horrible horrible customer service and company.
B00AOA9BL0,11,4,Fix or I will get a different cable service all together.
B00AOA9BL0,11,5,It didn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,11,6,I even have emailed about this and was told to call and get help that way.
B00AOA9BL0,11,7,Installed three weeks ago, repair men have come to "fix" the problems only to have something else pop up or the repair that was made didn't quite fix it.
B00AOA9BL0,11,8,It tok a day and a few phone calls, but I finally got the app working.
B00AOA9BL0,11,9,Tried contacting their online help about the app waited and waited and never got any kind of response.
B00AOA9BL0,11,10,Waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,11,Dont waste your storage...or your time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,12,I am getting close to changing to another paid service.
B00AOA9BL0,11,13,I am hoping that with new releases/updates that some of these issues will be resolved.
B00AOA9BL0,11,14,For the amount I pay, I expected better service.
B00AOA9BL0,11,15,Like others say...we do pay pretty good money for our internet and cable services, think you guys can offer something a lot better by fixing the problems.
B00AOA9BL0,11,16,I have the paid service, yet it work intermittly.
B00AOA9BL0,11,17,WIsh it actually worked half the time... ... WIsh it actually worked half the time....
B00AOA9BL0,11,18,Keep loosing the supposed "perks" of this package which involves phone calls to trouble shoot what is going on.
B00AOA9BL0,11,19,Worked well before and now it gives a error message (for 3 months now) They need to fix it asap.
B00AOA9BL0,11,20,It will not load, or times out.
B00AOA9BL0,11,21,App was doing great until last update.
B00AOA9BL0,11,22,This information should be made available to the customer upfront so that they do not waste time.
B00AOA9BL0,11,23,So it works great about 90% of the time, and I really like it.
B00AOA9BL0,11,24,Works great most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,12,0,good but not excellent.
B00AOA9BL0,12,1,not to good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,2,Quality is good and there are a ton of shows to watch.
B00AOA9BL0,12,3,nice.
B00AOA9BL0,12,4,good, but long way from great.
B00AOA9BL0,12,5,When it works, it's great but it stops and starts and gets blurry often.
B00AOA9BL0,12,6,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,12,7,If it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad if it is excellent then it is.
B00AOA9BL0,12,8,Good shows , good times.
B00AOA9BL0,12,9,It gets very annoying when one is trying to watch a good movie or show.
B00AOA9BL0,12,10,Too bad.
B00AOA9BL0,12,11,When it does work, the picture and sound quality are good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,12,Great so.
B00AOA9BL0,12,13,One thing that brothers me, is some of the really good movies are taken off too soon.
B00AOA9BL0,12,14,Good appNeeds more movies for basic people with basic cable not many live shows available either other than that it's good food HD videos fast streaming
B00AOA9BL0,12,15,I thought this would be good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,16,This app needs a little tweaking.
B00AOA9BL0,12,17,Good for tv shows if you have cable, terrible for movies if you only have streampix.
B00AOA9BL0,12,18,It allows me to watch anywhere with great quality of video.
B00AOA9BL0,12,19,Any time I can take CNN to the bathroom is a good thing.
B00AOA9BL0,12,20,I figure I should be able to watch it in hd on my hd tablet.
B00AOA9BL0,12,21,Very good ap with a very good price ($0.00).
B00AOA9BL0,12,22,Watching movies is great!
B00AOA9BL0,12,23,You can watch some stuff, don't expect to be able to watch all on-demand shows like on TV if it was so it would be good.
B00AOA9BL0,12,24,It also has problems with &#34;playback&#34;... all together annoying '': \
B00AOA9BL0,13,0,Twp Star Review.
B00AOA9BL0,13,1,Will change review when I do
B00AOA9BL0,13,2,You should be able to at least buy the upgrade or get a trade in and not have to buy a whole new device to be up to date.
B00AOA9BL0,13,3,waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,13,4,There are no updates that would work.
B00AOA9BL0,13,5,Hope will get better.
B00AOA9BL0,13,6,If you buy this you are wasting time if you don't have wifi where you are going if they get downloadable Disney I will be very happy and happy to write a five star review.
B00AOA9BL0,13,7,I tried a couple of times.
B00AOA9BL0,13,8,Hate this product.
B00AOA9BL0,13,9,Good value, especially if you like binge-watching tv shows.
B00AOA9BL0,13,10,Gave it a one star because it did not work, don't like the word hate.
B00AOA9BL0,13,11,Be careful and get it in writing.
B00AOA9BL0,13,12,expected more.
B00AOA9BL0,13,13,It is unacceptable that I know there is a problem when apparently they don't know or they don't care.
B00AOA9BL0,13,14,I thought this would be good.
B00AOA9BL0,13,15,Waste of time it is no good should be taken off so no one else wastes their time What a shame
B00AOA9BL0,13,16,Either way I wasted my time twice.
B00AOA9BL0,13,17,Make it the same quality as on my phone an I will give it 5 stars no problem.
B00AOA9BL0,13,18,BEWARE.
B00AOA9BL0,13,19,I rated it why do I need to write a review?
B00AOA9BL0,13,20,I rated it why do I need to write a review?
B00AOA9BL0,13,21,Waste of time.
B00AOA9BL0,13,22,Dont waste your storage...or your time.
B00AOA9BL0,13,23,I will pay better attention in the future, sorry for any trouble I caused.
B00AOA9BL0,13,24,I believe this to be unfair and scam to buyers.
B00AOA9BL0,14,0,it actualy works.
B00AOA9BL0,14,1,Does not work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,2,dont work to well.
B00AOA9BL0,14,3,Works - Most of the time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,4,Even with a 105MB connection, the app was very slow.
B00AOA9BL0,14,5,I didn't have any problems with the old app.
B00AOA9BL0,14,6,Never have this problem with Netflix app on the same device with the same Wi-Fi connection.
B00AOA9BL0,14,7,App was doing great until last update.
B00AOA9BL0,14,8,It didn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,9,I have this app on all my devices and it stops playing after about 30 every time.
B00AOA9BL0,14,10,There are no updates that would work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,11,It worked and then they did something so it will not let me connect to the internet through my router.
B00AOA9BL0,14,12,Maybe it's error but I have issues with this app.
B00AOA9BL0,14,13,This issue I have with said content is its crippling effect on the app thus far.
B00AOA9BL0,14,14,Doesn't work.
B00AOA9BL0,14,15,I don't have this trouble with Netflix or other video streaming, so I know it's not my wireless connection.
B00AOA9BL0,14,16,I probably will only use this app to watch BBC America while I am away at college.
B00AOA9BL0,14,17,The app is great when it works, I am connected online yet it tells me to connect.
B00AOA9BL0,14,18,Works Fine.
B00AOA9BL0,14,19,Works well by trial and error.
B00AOA9BL0,14,20,It is definitely a thing with this app since I do not need to do this with Amazon's video streaming or lunchroom.
B00AOA9BL0,14,21,I would not recommend this app
B00AOA9BL0,14,22,It just kept buffering even though I had a strong wireless connection at home.
B00AOA9BL0,14,23,Guess it is the Netflix app for those shows.)
B00AOA9BL0,14,24,This was one of my favorite apps...until the last update.
B00AOA9BL0,15,0,Is it me or has anyone else had this problem.
B00AOA9BL0,15,1,The app works great, when it works.
B00AOA9BL0,15,2,Wrong Channel.
B00AOA9BL0,15,3,Cool app but if you try to connect to your tv via the cable it stops all video and asks you disconnect cable.
B00AOA9BL0,15,4,Huh? I thought that this is cable TV to go.
B00AOA9BL0,15,5,The kicker is that once it starts this, it keeps doing it until you power off the device, wait 10 seconds or so, and then power it back on.
B00AOA9BL0,15,6,You need to be a Comcast infinity member and have a ID/email set up.
B00AOA9BL0,15,7,Works very well from laptop with Chromecast, -- but setting needs to be changed to make it work from Tablet.
B00AOA9BL0,15,8,Works well with Comcast although one has to be careful when scrolling thru the channel guide or you will be accidentally changing channels.Great having channel guide, DVR manager, Movies and more on one screen.
B00AOA9BL0,15,9,I have no problem connecting other devices to my Wi-Fi.
B00AOA9BL0,15,10,Needs easier playback controls such as a 10 second rewind button.
B00AOA9BL0,15,11,I have Comcast for TV now but I could not get it set up for some reason.
B00AOA9BL0,15,12,There is a default setting that needs to be changed to allow this to work on a Tablet - especially Samsung tablets.
B00AOA9BL0,15,13,You go into the main dropdown menu.
B00AOA9BL0,15,14,After a smooth install, player requires to much input to get working.
B00AOA9BL0,15,15,Easy as Scroll, select, and watch.
B00AOA9BL0,15,16,It comes in handy but when watching a show its not that easy to navigate through the menus to switch shows or to just find a new one.
B00AOA9BL0,15,17,I would have thought there would be more of a selection of shows.
B00AOA9BL0,15,18,Won't change the channel.
B00AOA9BL0,15,19,I've had cable TV for years but tend to watch the same programs all the time.
