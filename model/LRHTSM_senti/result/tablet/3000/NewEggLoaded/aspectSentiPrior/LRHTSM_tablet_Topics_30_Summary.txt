B008DWG5HE,0,4,I really love this device (using it right now).
B008DWG5HE,0,5,is really good the read books.
B008DWG5HE,0,6,For those who wants to use this device to read.
B008DWG5HE,0,7,I love the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,0,8,Love.
B008DWG5HE,0,9,I LOVE it.
B008DWG5HE,0,10,The SGN 10.1 is my second tablet, the first being the original Kindle Fire.
B008DWG5HE,0,11,I suggest you buy amazon kindle fire HD, although there's no S-pen.
B008DWG5HE,0,12,Love love.
B008DWG5HE,0,13,The tablet is a really nice change and I love love love it.
B008DWG5HE,0,14,I own an original ipad, a Sony xperia, a Kindle 7" and a Kindle 8.9" and now the Galaxy note.
B008DWG5HE,0,15,I have read other reviews of people complaining about the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,0,16,Great for reading books, I love the settings and while I would not get a Note just for reading books, it is a great addition for an item I was already getting regardless.-
B008DWG5HE,0,17,The screen is bright and the colors are vibrant.
B008DWG5HE,0,18,I have read reviews talking about the screen resolution in comparison with the Ipads Retina and other tablets with higher resolutions.
B008DWG5HE,0,19,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,0,20,LOVE.I got this as a gift with some strong hints on my part that I really wanted one.
B008DWG5HE,0,21,The display on the Ipad 3 is better and you can certainly notice the difference when you look at them side buy side.
B008DWG5HE,0,22,I love it!
B008DWG5HE,0,23,Sorry Amazon, I really enjoyed my Fire, but there were too many "cons" on my list to consider purchasing the new Kindle Fire HD.When researching my new tablet, I looked at all available options.
B008DWG5HE,0,24,The ipad is boring to use, the xperia is a little bit better and the kindles are excellent for Amazon consumption and not alot more.
B008DWG5HE,1,0,I think this will be a useful app as well.
B008DWG5HE,1,1,You will need how to install apps and visit the app store.
B008DWG5HE,1,2,Other apps can give you .psd
B008DWG5HE,1,3,Kindle app works great and Amazon Prime movies work well in the browser.
B008DWG5HE,1,4,One for their store and one for their apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,5,it great.
B008DWG5HE,1,6,There's a great selection of apps optimized for tablets from Google Play, Amazon App Store, and Samsung Apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,7,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,1,8,What it has works great!
B008DWG5HE,1,9,Did not work from google store.
B008DWG5HE,1,10,It comes loaded with a lot of great features and programs like the Samsung App store and the Android Play store.
B008DWG5HE,1,11,Love all the apps it's got.
B008DWG5HE,1,12,I can read books using the Kindle app, or using Adobe Reader, or Zinio Reader, Amazon Book reader.
B008DWG5HE,1,13,Very inconvenient location.Apps:Here are some the of the apps I use.
B008DWG5HE,1,14,One app in particular- ironically- the AMAZON mobile app- was not available for use on the Samsung Tablets.
B008DWG5HE,1,15,I also watch Netflix movies , read kindle books and Google play magazines on it.
B008DWG5HE,1,16,I also find the Samsungs to be every bit as intuitive as the Ipad was.Apps: There are maybe 2 apps that the Itunes store has that I "need" in the Android app market, but all of the other apps that I already purchased for my Android phone were readily and easily available for download from the Google Apps store ("PLAY").
B008DWG5HE,1,17,I had a Hava streaming box for TV - the app on iPad wasn't working, but it's Android app worked perfect...
B008DWG5HE,1,18,All my favorite Android apps look great on it.
B008DWG5HE,1,19,Skype app for Android works really well!5)
B008DWG5HE,1,20,You'll also get some tips on the various app's that support it.
B008DWG5HE,1,21,But, the upside is that there is an app and a fix for everything.
B008DWG5HE,1,22,I have more shortcuts to apps than I know what to do with.
B008DWG5HE,1,23,Although 16:9 is great for video and gaming.
B008DWG5HE,1,24,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,2,0,For that, I think the price is right on this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,2,1,Great Tablet, Very Happy!
B008DWG5HE,2,2,Great.
B008DWG5HE,2,3,I love it!
B008DWG5HE,2,4,GO REFURBISHED...THE PRODUCT WAS AS GOOD AS NEW...SAVE MONEY...BE HAPPY...!!! Love the product.
B008DWG5HE,2,5,Great tablet but do your research before buying.
B008DWG5HE,2,6,I am very happy with this purchase.
B008DWG5HE,2,7,Love this tablet way better than an ipad!
B008DWG5HE,2,8,love it!
B008DWG5HE,2,9,For the price I paid, I am happy with this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,2,10,Love love.
B008DWG5HE,2,11,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,2,12,It is great to:1.
B008DWG5HE,2,13,Great Tablet!
B008DWG5HE,2,14,I should have bought an Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,2,15,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,2,16,This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device.
B008DWG5HE,2,17,I compared prices and specification and of course Amazon price won!
B008DWG5HE,2,18,Price.
B008DWG5HE,2,19,Productivity at work.
B008DWG5HE,2,20,This tablet is the best one I have owned so far... iPad, Nexus 7... they may be good but this thing does so much more.
B008DWG5HE,2,21,Just Great compared to new IPAD.
B008DWG5HE,2,22,It was great.
B008DWG5HE,2,23,I'm in love.
B008DWG5HE,2,24,Productivity at home.
B008DWG5HE,3,0,Battery life is short.2.
B008DWG5HE,3,1,It had ample battery life sufficient for my use.
B008DWG5HE,3,2,Battery doesn't last long.
B008DWG5HE,3,3,Long battery life as it lastsall day.
B008DWG5HE,3,4,Long battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,5,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,3,6,Battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,7,Battery life excellent.
B008DWG5HE,3,8,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,3,9,Always seems like we are charging it.
B008DWG5HE,3,10,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,3,11,The battery is still at 75% when I get home after a whole day in the field..
B008DWG5HE,3,12,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,3,13,See how long the battery lasts.
B008DWG5HE,3,14,Battery seems to last pretty long.
B008DWG5HE,3,15,Longer battery life than the iPad or GTab.
B008DWG5HE,3,16,I think I was down to 77% or something so battery life should be fine.
B008DWG5HE,3,17,Battery life is very good, it is easily an all day device with wifi on and high brightness while taking notes.
B008DWG5HE,3,18,I usually have the brightness set to 10-15% or slightly less in classrooms or at home because that's all I really need but also to conserve battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,19,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B008DWG5HE,3,20,If you are playing a game the battery goes low way to quick.
B008DWG5HE,3,21,The battery doesn't last that long as I would have liked but that's fine with me.
B008DWG5HE,3,22,I've worked on it almost non-stop all day, and the battery has held up pretty well.
B008DWG5HE,3,23,However, times are a changing and I'm seeing how the right tablet can enhance my work life (I"m an attorney).
B008DWG5HE,3,24,Same usage as entry 1) above, except at 30% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 10 hours.
B008DWG5HE,4,0,Here is the good and the .. well it is all pretty good.1.
B008DWG5HE,4,1,Feels solid to me and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,4,2,i like the multi screen and  the resolution es good my be in mucho better iPad screen  but is  more productive that other tablet
B008DWG5HE,4,3,Nice to have speakers up front, but it would be nice if they were a little louder.4.
B008DWG5HE,4,4,This is as good as it gets.
B008DWG5HE,4,5,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,4,6,And the sound quality and volume were excellent.
B008DWG5HE,4,7,OK, let;s get it over with, the screen isn't as high resolution as the Apple, but it;s pretty good.
B008DWG5HE,4,8,Resolution is good enough, I can't say I miss my iPad.
B008DWG5HE,4,9,The build quality seems fine to me.
B008DWG5HE,4,10,solid build.
B008DWG5HE,4,11,The build quality is fine.
B008DWG5HE,4,12,The screen is also big, so you can see the videos better.
B008DWG5HE,4,13,Evernote works nicely on the big screen.9.
B008DWG5HE,4,14,Screen has lower resolution than an iPad, but it still looks very good.>Update
B008DWG5HE,4,15,Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine.
B008DWG5HE,4,16,I still think they could be louder on tablets but this design is a  good start.8.
B008DWG5HE,4,17,Maybe I'm not as discerning, but I'm thrilled with the build quality of the Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,4,18,Great tablet, but would be better if it was cheaper.
B008DWG5HE,4,19,Build quality is top notch.
B008DWG5HE,4,20,The front facing speakers sound very good compared to other tablets I have used.
B008DWG5HE,4,21,Feature-Packed Tablet, Better than Expected.
B008DWG5HE,4,22,The screen is excellent.
B008DWG5HE,4,23,Speakers stereo separation is very good but the lower frequency sound is poor.6.
B008DWG5HE,4,24,The tablet itself is sturdy, with great resolution.
B008DWG5HE,5,0,It has picture in picture video.
B008DWG5HE,5,1,very good.
B008DWG5HE,5,2,picture great sound!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,5,3,Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great.
B008DWG5HE,5,4,The rear-facing camera takes really decent images!6)
B008DWG5HE,5,5,- Camera is awesome under normal light.
B008DWG5HE,5,6,It has a decent front camera for video chat, and the a decent rear camera with a flash, tablets are not cameras but this one is above average.10)
B008DWG5HE,5,7,Pictures and videos are stunning.
B008DWG5HE,5,8,I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet.
B008DWG5HE,5,9,For low lighted scenarios, quality of photo may go down.
B008DWG5HE,5,10,It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something.
B008DWG5HE,5,11,Pretty amazing.
B008DWG5HE,5,12,It is easy to use, and the screen/display is great!
B008DWG5HE,5,13,I do not have any problem with screen resolution.Camera is okay but I  prepare to use my regular camera, cannon g10.I did not use android before.
B008DWG5HE,5,14,Cameras are not the best you will see out there but both work nice.
B008DWG5HE,5,15,But from the demos I have watched I think it will be fun!A few things to consider though before purchasing...first, the camera doesn't take the greatest pictures.
B008DWG5HE,5,16,It seems required for any portable device to have a camera nowadays, and both front and back are there, but the photos aren't great.
B008DWG5HE,5,17,Speaking of portable - the video capabilities of this thing for AMAZING!Anyway - my overall assessment is: I LOVE THIS TABLET.
B008DWG5HE,5,18,I will say that for a tablet this thing is AWESOME.
B008DWG5HE,5,19,Of course, I can always use the S pen to write in the characters if I want to take a quick note, however if i wish to type, it's a little harder.The camera is pretty good, both front and back.
B008DWG5HE,5,20,So I didn't send it back.Great device love it my kids love it.great
B008DWG5HE,5,21,The front 5MP camera (with LED flash!) takes decent photos and videos, especially for social networking apps like Instagram & Twitter.
B008DWG5HE,5,22,Great camera for video and still shooting.
B008DWG5HE,5,23,Awesome screen allows for great graphics.
B008DWG5HE,5,24,It has front facing speakers like all tablets should have.16)
B008DWG5HE,6,0,would like more smooth and good resolution.
B008DWG5HE,6,1,It's very responsive and sublime to touch.
B008DWG5HE,6,2,Amazingly fast and responsive!
B008DWG5HE,6,3,Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.
B008DWG5HE,6,4,Speed is great and the screen is great, I take more productivity tools over high resolution screen tablet anyday.
B008DWG5HE,6,5,It did not disappoint.Firstly, this tablet is fast, really fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,6,It is very fast and smooth.
B008DWG5HE,6,7,Resolution looks great.
B008DWG5HE,6,8,This tablet gets the basics right: a high quality, bright screen, and fast processor.
B008DWG5HE,6,9,This screen is beautiful!
B008DWG5HE,6,10,Note: the iPad 3 is only 1GHz processor, and dual core, not quad.*
B008DWG5HE,6,11,The screen is plenty bright, the tablet is snappy and responsive.
B008DWG5HE,6,12,The quad core is sickly fast.d.
B008DWG5HE,6,13,So far I am very pleased with the speed, clarity of the screen and the general performance of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,6,14,Screen - screen resolution is one of the reasons I was hesitant to try Galaxy Note.
B008DWG5HE,6,15,Don't expect a quad core to be amazingly faster than a dual core, but it can handle concurrent tasks with aplomb.Cons:1.
B008DWG5HE,6,16,I know that ipad has many good note apps but what is the point of using them if there is no palm rejection feature?Other than taking notes, the performance is also blazing fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,17,The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.
B008DWG5HE,6,18,There was a noticeable improvement in responsiveness and speed.
B008DWG5HE,6,19,I like spen functionality ... and would like more smooth and good resolution.
B008DWG5HE,6,20,Scrolling is fast.Screen - FAIRLY GOOD - Same screen as Galaxy Tab 2. Similar to ipad 2.
B008DWG5HE,6,21,But if you hate lag, you'll love a quad core because there's just about always enough processor for whatever the device is doing.
B008DWG5HE,6,22,The screen is excellent.
B008DWG5HE,6,23,Fantastic that this has 2 GB RAM Memory, again, you can tell when running intensive, multiple apps, especially gaming.
B008DWG5HE,6,24,I really don't see a ton of value in the S-Pen YET, but hopefully this feature will evolve and become a key strength.General touch responsiveness - GOOD - scrolling home screens is much more responsive than the Galaxy Tab 2, very close to the responsiveness of the Transformer Prime.Web Surfing - VERY GOOD - Page loads are very fast, much faster than the Galaxy Tab 2, very similar to ipad2 speeds.
B008DWG5HE,7,0,SD card slot usles.
B008DWG5HE,7,1,Having 2 MB of memory is a plus.
B008DWG5HE,7,2,not really 32 GB.
B008DWG5HE,7,3,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,4,So if you want the note go for 32GB or you'll be sorry.
B008DWG5HE,7,5,Expandable Storage.*
B008DWG5HE,7,6,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,7,Another great feature is that even though this device comes with 32 GB internal memory, I can insert a 64 GB card.
B008DWG5HE,7,8,I also love having the micro SD card option as then I don't worry about space.
B008DWG5HE,7,9,I bought this partly because of the sd card slot.According to Samsung you can't run apps from it and they can't store their data there.
B008DWG5HE,7,10,But if you are just getting your Note, i would suggest waiting until you get the update before using the card so you can just use the exFAT format.My particular card is a Sandisk "MobileUltra" SDXC card with a Class10 rating.
B008DWG5HE,7,11,I bought the "32 GB" version but it really only has 26 GB of total memory - about 24 of which are available with the product out of the box.
B008DWG5HE,7,12,I purchased the 16 gig version of the tablet along with a 32 gig SD card for just that purpose, only to find out that I can't do that.
B008DWG5HE,7,13,It will handle up to a Micro 64GB SDXC storage card which writes up to 30mbps, really adding lots of extra storage since most tablets only support 32GB.
B008DWG5HE,7,14,I am running a 64GB card and it works great.
B008DWG5HE,7,15,The tablet itself is nice with some goodfeatures.
B008DWG5HE,7,16,I bought the 16-gs, because it was cheap, now 32 gs is cheaper, if you want it buy this tablet,  buy the  32gs,,,, because the aps can not be moved to sd memory ,, I have the 16gs, and I have little memory and it sucks,but the tablet works good
B008DWG5HE,7,17,you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory?
B008DWG5HE,7,18,Bought the 32GB model AND popped in a 32 GB sdhc for tons of storage (not possible to do in either of the other two devices.
B008DWG5HE,7,19,What is best about this product is the 32gb of storage.
B008DWG5HE,7,20,Seems quite sturdy and mine doesnt creak in my hands.I got the 16gb version as it was readily available, and i added a 64gb card to the slot, for less than the $50 extra for the 32g model.
B008DWG5HE,7,21,The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,22,I purchased a 32GB micro SD card to increase storage space for my videos.
B008DWG5HE,7,23,Thank you so much for adding the card slot, Samsung!The audio quality is very good.
B008DWG5HE,7,24,Did I mention it has an option for an external SD card to go along with the 32GB that it already has?
B008DWG5HE,8,0,What it has works great!
B008DWG5HE,8,1,WIFI ONLY.
B008DWG5HE,8,2,Good Device.
B008DWG5HE,8,3,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,8,4,It was run over and still looked good but just didn't work.
B008DWG5HE,8,5,It works great.
B008DWG5HE,8,6,They love it and it works great.
B008DWG5HE,8,7,This is a great device and very useful for teaching and other such tasks.
B008DWG5HE,8,8,Works without WiFi.
B008DWG5HE,8,9,This device has replaced my laptop as my main computing device.
B008DWG5HE,8,10,Great in some ways.
B008DWG5HE,8,11,WiFi works fine.
B008DWG5HE,8,12,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,8,13,I read ebook, surf web, and watch videos.
B008DWG5HE,8,14,Kindle app works great and Amazon Prime movies work well in the browser.
B008DWG5HE,8,15,I do like working with photos and the note functions are good as well.
B008DWG5HE,8,16,Its great being able to see what's on my other devices and use them as I need from one tablet.
B008DWG5HE,8,17,I can't tell any difference in quality between it and my laptop when watching the same video on both (the laptop was ~$1700 before a coupon).
B008DWG5HE,8,18,I found another app that works better for me.
B008DWG5HE,8,19,I bought this to use for work and travel.
B008DWG5HE,8,20,No problems connecting to any bt devices so far.
B008DWG5HE,8,21,Here is the good and the .. well it is all pretty good.1.
B008DWG5HE,8,22,Video chatting works great as well.
B008DWG5HE,8,23,I still like it and will make some time to work with it more.
B008DWG5HE,8,24,This device works perfectly for these tasks.
B008DWG5HE,9,0,And well, after trying several apps, I must say that best for writing are: Quill, Write and Papyrus.
B008DWG5HE,9,1,You resume writing, "accuracy".
B008DWG5HE,9,2,It works great.
B008DWG5HE,9,3,You can write as though you were using a pen and paper.
B008DWG5HE,9,4,8/16  Attention Evernote UsersThe S-Pen works great with Evernote Notes!
B008DWG5HE,9,5,The S-Pen feels like a real pen when you are writing not like those gummy bear stylus tips that the other tablets use to write with.
B008DWG5HE,9,6,S Note and PS Touch are geared to work well with the new Samsung Galaxy S Pen.
B008DWG5HE,9,7,The S Pen is so accurate that you can hand write whole sheets of handwritten text with it.
B008DWG5HE,9,8,The handwriting recognition seems to work well, although I haven't used it much yet.As far as the tablet overall, the responsiveness is great, and the screen is perfect.
B008DWG5HE,9,9,You have the best features on the go and the stylus works so well with it.
B008DWG5HE,9,10,If you hand write a few words and then pause, the handwriting is converted to text.
B008DWG5HE,9,11,Some times you can press the button on the S Pen to erase instead of write and some times you can just use your finger to erase while using the S Pen to write.
B008DWG5HE,9,12,The handwriting app is good.
B008DWG5HE,9,13,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,9,14,Finally, a tablet with a stylus good enough for drawing.
B008DWG5HE,9,15,Well, if that's the case, I must say that this tablet, works great for painting and sketching, is excellent in these two applications.
B008DWG5HE,9,16,Evernote works nicely on the big screen.9.
B008DWG5HE,9,17,This works so much better than the pens on ipads or other types of android tablets.
B008DWG5HE,9,18,Good tablet for 2012.
B008DWG5HE,9,19,It has the S Pen, meaning your can write, draw and lots lots lots more.11)
B008DWG5HE,9,20,Im note a great typer so handwriting notes in meetings works well for me.
B008DWG5HE,9,21,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,9,22,* Hand Writing Instead of Typing - The default keyboard has an option that lets you hand write in any input field instead of typing.
B008DWG5HE,9,23,I love the S pen feature because I take a lot of notes for work and it's easier than using my finger tip and a lot cleaner.
B008DWG5HE,9,24,There are many note taking apps available, some better then others, but there is no better hand writing experience with a tablet then this, except maybe the new Samsung Windows 8 tablet, but that's a whole different beast.
B008DWG5HE,10,0,good produict and works very well.
B008DWG5HE,10,1,Work and Home Companion.
B008DWG5HE,10,2,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,10,3,This tablet is a great size.
B008DWG5HE,10,4,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,5,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,10,6,It is beautiful and works great!
B008DWG5HE,10,7,Nice product.
B008DWG5HE,10,8,In few works !
B008DWG5HE,10,9,great.
B008DWG5HE,10,10,nice to use.
B008DWG5HE,10,11,Evernote works nicely on the big screen.9.
B008DWG5HE,10,12,This tablet works very well and has many nice features.
B008DWG5HE,10,13,Solid product with great screen.
B008DWG5HE,10,14,I have only had this for a month, but it seems like a great product.
B008DWG5HE,10,15,The weight and size of the two tablets is about the same.
B008DWG5HE,10,16,And it works as advertised.
B008DWG5HE,10,17,Nice Unit.
B008DWG5HE,10,18,Great apps, great entertainment.
B008DWG5HE,10,19,Great product good price, does all it is was meant to do. will do business with this vendlor once again
B008DWG5HE,10,20,10.1 size gives me a larger screen for productivity but not so large that it becomes less portable.
B008DWG5HE,10,21,I think it's easy to use and has everything you need for anything you want.
B008DWG5HE,10,22,Great product now I am just looking for a good key board to go with it for when I have a surface to use it on.
B008DWG5HE,10,23,It is easy to use, and the screen/display is great!
B008DWG5HE,10,24,The 10 inch display is fine plus its size and weight.
B008DWG5HE,11,0,Also, the Note 10.1 has no built in full size or mini USB or HDMI ports.
B008DWG5HE,11,1,This kit provides access to many USB devices (including printers, USB sticks, keyboards, mouses and SD cards).
B008DWG5HE,11,2,It will handle HDMI to a big screen and USB keyboards, mice, game controllers, external hard drives, I have have tried a 500GB external hard drive, and it should do even larger, just pickup the adapters.
B008DWG5HE,11,3,Evernote works nicely on the big screen.9.
B008DWG5HE,11,4,I bought an SD Card reader for $8 and hdmi adapter for $34 - hooked up a bluetooth mouse and keyboard and I can use my TV like a smart TV now.
B008DWG5HE,11,5,Female USB OTG adapter) which allows you to hook up a flash card reader or a USB thumb drive to your tablet.
B008DWG5HE,11,6,The problem from my point of view is that samsung removed the hdmi port and usb port in order to sell accessories.
B008DWG5HE,11,7,What it has works great!
B008DWG5HE,11,8,Only thing I am not too keen on was there was no built in Swype keyboard like my HTC phone, but I bought the app so that was fixable
B008DWG5HE,11,9,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,11,10,Battery life excellent.
B008DWG5HE,11,11,I really love this device (using it right now).
B008DWG5HE,11,12,When I plug in a USB external hard drive to the tablet, the tablet tells me that the USB device requires too much power to operate (stick with the thumb drives, or AC adapter powered external HDDs).
B008DWG5HE,11,13,"NexusMediaImporter" is a great app for dowloading raw files into your Note.You will need this or similar adapter, which works quite well for the cheap price:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YWIRBS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00(Sanoxy
B008DWG5HE,11,14,It also supports Bluetooth.I was very impressed with the battery life.
B008DWG5HE,11,15,Bad charger, Bad Quick Commands... Elsewise, nice.
B008DWG5HE,11,16,It's not always easy to get wireless - especially if driving.
B008DWG5HE,11,17,I've found I don't use the extra ports all that much so it isn't a big deal for me.
B008DWG5HE,11,18,There should be a micro or mini USB port on the left side of the device (in landscape) so that it can be used in landscape or portrait while propped up on a stand.
B008DWG5HE,11,19,Easy transfer of Data from extSD on my Galaxy Note 2 phone to Galaxy Note 10.1 .. connect both to a PC in USB drive mode and copy files/directories without a fuss.3.
B008DWG5HE,11,20,Bought the case from Poetic and well you can't tell what it's made of in a case...4.
B008DWG5HE,11,21,You need multiple expensive accessories just to hook up USB host, SD cards, and HDMI.
B008DWG5HE,11,22,Also, have adapter to transfer pics to tablet, but haven't gotten that to work yet.
B008DWG5HE,11,23,Samsung does offer adapters that connect to the charging port--but that is an extra cost and an inconvience.
B008DWG5HE,11,24,Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such.
B008DWG5HE,12,0,The Android system permits it.
B008DWG5HE,12,1,It is beautiful and works great!
B008DWG5HE,12,2,This tablet works very well and has many nice features.
B008DWG5HE,12,3,No Flashplayer operation.....I wanted this instead of the Apple iPad...now its just like the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,12,4,Love it!
B008DWG5HE,12,5,I am new to Android products, but there is no reason to go back to Apple.And it does all the other things tablets/iPads do.
B008DWG5HE,12,6,but I love this thing so much I just want her to have one.
B008DWG5HE,12,7,It does take some getting use to the Android operating system when trying to navigate the web.
B008DWG5HE,12,8,LOVE IT, BUT.........
B008DWG5HE,12,9,Love it!
B008DWG5HE,12,10,I love it!
B008DWG5HE,12,11,I love it!
B008DWG5HE,12,12,GPS is fast.
B008DWG5HE,12,13,I gave this a 4 star rating only bc I don't know how to work everything yet.
B008DWG5HE,12,14,If you are looking for a tablet that you can actually work from home on get a real tablet with a windows operating system.
B008DWG5HE,12,15,It has run every android app I've thrown at it.
B008DWG5HE,12,16,If you're you're looking for an Android tablet I strongly recommend this one.
B008DWG5HE,12,17,Great Hardware.
B008DWG5HE,12,18,Great Hardware hampered by inferior software.
B008DWG5HE,12,19,This is  the only good thing about it.
B008DWG5HE,12,20,I loved my new tablet.
B008DWG5HE,12,21,one is about Jelly Bean update.Samsung is preparing for the Jelly Bean update.When that happens, you will get the latest Android OS, BUT you will lose the Adobe Flash Player.Adobe Dev.
B008DWG5HE,12,22,However, I am quite familiar to android OS on my phone.
B008DWG5HE,12,23,Just like the samsung galaxy 4 phone, love it, easy to use basics.
B008DWG5HE,12,24,It is smooth, fast, nice looking, and has the S-Pen.
B008DWG5HE,13,0,bad service so far I have not received the goods since being purchased from the 15th of January  nnnn n.
B008DWG5HE,13,1,Samsung was on the path to great product until they started to make it exclusive to thier products!!
B008DWG5HE,13,2,I returned this item.
B008DWG5HE,13,3,Tablet came on time but in a rather large box.
B008DWG5HE,13,4,Product is fine and I love Samsung products but seller gets 3 stars for product seal broken.
B008DWG5HE,13,5,First of all, this item has shipped 3 days after I actually placed order.Second, the item was defective!!!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,13,6,Don't Buy Refurbished from this company.
B008DWG5HE,13,7,All the other features are great but what good are they if you can't print your reciept after purchasing your item  from Amazon?
B008DWG5HE,13,8,contacted and was told that its new and not refurbished item.
B008DWG5HE,13,9,I have purchased so many things through amazon over the last 7 or so years but this is my first review.
B008DWG5HE,13,10,Shipped on time and tablet was intact, exceptions were fine.
B008DWG5HE,13,11,I can't even help but cap-lock on these things, I love this product so much.
B008DWG5HE,13,12,I've also ordered a few accessories from here on Amazon which haven't even arrived yet.
B008DWG5HE,13,13,Satisfied customer that I am with this purchase than BestBuy.
B008DWG5HE,13,14,The tablet box seal was broken.i
B008DWG5HE,13,15,Better than Apple products.
B008DWG5HE,13,16,I've been a fan of Apple products so far.
B008DWG5HE,13,17,GO REFURBISHED...THE PRODUCT WAS AS GOOD AS NEW...SAVE MONEY...BE HAPPY...!!! Love the product.
B008DWG5HE,13,18,The only thing that I was mad abt is.that the sticker on the box was opened but the product itself seemed un touched.
B008DWG5HE,13,19,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B008DWG5HE,13,20,I should be getting the phone and hopefully other brands by them once I have a home.
B008DWG5HE,13,21,So I didn't send it back.Great device love it my kids love it.great
B008DWG5HE,13,22,Great time saver.Notes: Some observations I have made.-
B008DWG5HE,13,23,Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs.
B008DWG5HE,13,24,They love it and it works great.
B008DWG5HE,14,0,I have owned 2 other android tablets before this and this 1 is by far the best.
B008DWG5HE,14,1,Best Android tablet I have owned.
B008DWG5HE,14,2,I love this Samsung device.
B008DWG5HE,14,3,I love my Samsung galaxy note.
B008DWG5HE,14,4,I have an Ipad as well as this Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,14,5,Good Device.
B008DWG5HE,14,6,I debated for a while between the ipad and the samsung galaxy note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,14,7,I have owned 8 Android Tablets and one Windows tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,8,One of the best TABLETs in ANDROID market.
B008DWG5HE,14,9,It even has Microsoft Office for Android on it!
B008DWG5HE,14,10,This device is very similar to the Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,14,11,Windows 8 Tablets - Since recent IFA Berlin showed several upcoming Windows 8 tablet, I have decided to give a quick comparison to them.3.
B008DWG5HE,14,12,The Galaxy Note 10.1 has the potential of being the best of both worlds.
B008DWG5HE,14,13,Their reputation on the software update is the best of all android tablet maker.
B008DWG5HE,14,14,I love my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1!
B008DWG5HE,14,15,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,14,16,I was torn between this and the Microsoft Surface Pro.
B008DWG5HE,14,17,Great.
B008DWG5HE,14,18,I like this device a lot.
B008DWG5HE,14,19,I have owned the original iPad, The iPad 2, The New iPad, HTC Flyer 7" with scribe, original Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and now the Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,14,20,The digitizer is pretty good, but I actually prefer the Surface pro digitizer but that is more of an ultrabook then a tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,21,Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine.
B008DWG5HE,14,22,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,14,23,So Android at this time is the best bet for me.
B008DWG5HE,14,24,I currently own an iPad too and I have to say it kicks iPad's ass.
B008DWG5HE,15,0,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B008DWG5HE,15,1,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,15,2,One complaint is that the screen is VERY bright and I've not found a way to dim it.
B008DWG5HE,15,3,The screen is very sensitive.
B008DWG5HE,15,4,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,15,5,With the sun shining directly on the screen, I can read it fine.
B008DWG5HE,15,6,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B008DWG5HE,15,7,Screen rotation is a bit too sensitive.
B008DWG5HE,15,8,I really believe this tablet wont last at $500 for too long.The second big problem is the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,9,I actually found out that it will not only run split screens plus 5 apps like I mentioned but up to 11.The screen resolution is NOT an issue at all.
B008DWG5HE,15,10,When using the tablet outdoors in bright sunlight, I find that the screen is bright enough to read text comfortably providing it is positioned properly with respect to the sun.
B008DWG5HE,15,11,It is bright and colors are vibrant.
B008DWG5HE,15,12,Thus, unless you are looking directly at a right angle to where the pen is touching the glass, the image on the screen does not appear where you expect it to appear.
B008DWG5HE,15,13,Yes, the iPad has a screen that is a bit more vibrant, but unless they are sitting side by side you will NOT notice the difference.
B008DWG5HE,15,14,Also, when  viewing dark  movie scenes, the screen appears washed out around the edges, with the upper left corner appearing orangeish, the lower right corner appearing bluish, and a whitish fringe appearing all around the edges.
B008DWG5HE,15,15,The screen dimensions are optimal for viewing, reading, and writing--and doing all three on the go.Seriously.
B008DWG5HE,15,16,With the screen facing away from the sun, however, reflections of myself and the scenery behind me dominate the screen and make it difficult to read the text.
B008DWG5HE,15,17,It is punchy with good blacks and looks plenty sharp at the normal viewing distance of a 10" screen.
B008DWG5HE,15,18,The screen is fine.2.5.
B008DWG5HE,15,19,5 open screens at once on and Android SupervTablet.VersusCons: 1) It gets a knock for only having a 1280x800 resolution display screen, but, really it has adjustments like a TV has and your can set picture settings.
B008DWG5HE,15,20,The display is nice and bright and the unit can be used even outside on a sunny day.
B008DWG5HE,15,21,Also, there is a gap between the surface of the glass (where the pen tip touches), and the screen below the glass where the image appears.
B008DWG5HE,15,22,Unfortunately, the screen has amazingly terrible backlight bleeding.This seems to stem from a multicolored spot on the screen that is visible at an angle.
B008DWG5HE,15,23,Also, there is a slight lag time between the pen motion and the appearance of the image on the screen.
B008DWG5HE,15,24,It does have quite a large bezel around the screen but oddly it makes it a bit easier to hold.
B008DWG5HE,16,0,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,16,1,You will need how to install apps and visit the app store.
B008DWG5HE,16,2,It does NOT have flash player nor can you download it from the app store.
B008DWG5HE,16,3,The problem with all tablets is app support.
B008DWG5HE,16,4,One for their store and one for their apps.
B008DWG5HE,16,5,Therefore, this tablet will not run Flash video.
B008DWG5HE,16,6,Also, every app I have looked at seems to be 40-50% cheaper on the Amazon app site than on Play Store.
B008DWG5HE,16,7,Did not work from google store.
B008DWG5HE,16,8,It has run every android app I've thrown at it.
B008DWG5HE,16,9,I was very disapointed when I found out I can'get on Amazon Video, etc.
B008DWG5HE,16,10,Very inconvenient location.Apps:Here are some the of the apps I use.
B008DWG5HE,16,11,Kindle app works great and Amazon Prime movies work well in the browser.
B008DWG5HE,16,12,Flash not supported.
B008DWG5HE,16,13,There's a great selection of apps optimized for tablets from Google Play, Amazon App Store, and Samsung Apps.
B008DWG5HE,16,14,Probably Google will come up with an app to do this and at the same time track what you watch.
B008DWG5HE,16,15,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,16,16,It's asking I download Adobe flash player.
B008DWG5HE,16,17,October 19On the FLASH PLAYER:There are several ways to get around not having flash player.
B008DWG5HE,16,18,However, if you want to watch videos from any other source, for example; Amazon Prime, facebook videos, yahoo videos, etc. they can't be played due to the Adobe Flash being blocked.
B008DWG5HE,16,19,Can watch Amazon Prime videos (after loading flash),8.
B008DWG5HE,16,20,Does not support Adobe Flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,21,No flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,22,There is no obvious way to view Amazon Prime videos or to view many Internet sites that use flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,23,To my dismay Adobe (the company who makes Flash video software) stopped supporting Flash for android.
B008DWG5HE,16,24,Great tablet but it does not support flash!
B008DWG5HE,17,0,if you purchase their products you are on your own after they get your money.
B008DWG5HE,17,1,It was run over and still looked good but just didn't work.
B008DWG5HE,17,2,I bought the Note after reading the many reviews here.
B008DWG5HE,17,3,I expected this product to last for at least a couple of years.
B008DWG5HE,17,4,Insurance bought me another.
B008DWG5HE,17,5,I have purchased so many things through amazon over the last 7 or so years but this is my first review.
B008DWG5HE,17,6,I saw the James Franco commercial and immediately decided to buy it.
B008DWG5HE,17,7,I bought first one, during the trial, it freezes soon, So, I returned it and excanged with new one.
B008DWG5HE,17,8,would not have bought knowing this.
B008DWG5HE,17,9,My company spends 1000s of dollar in amazon purchasing.
B008DWG5HE,17,10,This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device.
B008DWG5HE,17,11,Then the 10.1 Note came out and not only did I buy this I also bought my wife the tab 2 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,17,12,Seven months later, after many problems,  Asus refunded my money.
B008DWG5HE,17,13,I almost did not purchase this device because all the reviews were so negative.
B008DWG5HE,17,14,This device is much better than what all the reviews say.
B008DWG5HE,17,15,This purchase was a mistake :(
B008DWG5HE,17,16,As you have probably read from other reviews, this feels like a cheap McDonalds toy.
B008DWG5HE,17,17,To be honest, the sanctions against the first tab provoked me to buy it.
B008DWG5HE,17,18,I returned it in 1 month, it had similar problems.
B008DWG5HE,17,19,I tried a "do it yourself repair that did not work and order a new device.
B008DWG5HE,17,20,I guess that isn't too bad, so long as it works.
B008DWG5HE,17,21,It's one thing to crash, and another thing to crash ALL THE TIME and preventing you from using other apps and having a good experience.Save your money.
B008DWG5HE,17,22,Missing parts not once, not twice but 3 times, and all boxes were open.
B008DWG5HE,17,23,trust me,DO NOT BUY THIS.*Extra info: I bought this device at a local ELECTRONICS store because I was on the fence about buying it.
B008DWG5HE,17,24,Much better.
B008DWG5HE,18,0,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,18,1,I was able assemble the adopter /battery charger.
B008DWG5HE,18,2,charging cord.
B008DWG5HE,18,3,Battery charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,4,But, Alas! after plugging the charger in for a couple of hours and seeing a battery charge symbol on the screen I elected to turn in on and________---------________ Nothing!
B008DWG5HE,18,5,I'm having battery charging issues though!
B008DWG5HE,18,6,Had one before and the battery died.
B008DWG5HE,18,7,Unit takes a long time to charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,8,As of now I must Hard shut down to get to full charge and sometimes that doesn't even do it.
B008DWG5HE,18,9,The first one wouldn't even turn on!
B008DWG5HE,18,10,The battery is still at 75% when I get home after a whole day in the field..
B008DWG5HE,18,11,It doesn't stop even long enough for me to hold down the power key and turn the device off completely.I have researched everything, and can not find anything on why it is doing this, or how to fix it!
B008DWG5HE,18,12,Last week it went into a reboot mode and I could not get it to turn off.
B008DWG5HE,18,13,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,18,14,The charging cable that comes with the unit is very short and does not let you charge the unit while using it unless you sit next to the wall outlet.
B008DWG5HE,18,15,So yes, you can fully charge it while using it.
B008DWG5HE,18,16,Using supplied Samung charger I plug in, go to bed, wake up and its at 26%? Battery icon shows it's charging.
B008DWG5HE,18,17,I held-in the start button for 10, 20, 30 seconds up to a couple of minutes and one time the screen came alive with some inverted yellow triangle flashing.
B008DWG5HE,18,18,The shipment received on time.
B008DWG5HE,18,19,Charged it while at work on Friday and then again when I went to bed Sunday morning about 3am.
B008DWG5HE,18,20,If you attempt to charge this tablet via your computer, the tablet will show the battery icon as not charging.
B008DWG5HE,18,21,I could go about 3 days or so before I realized I needed to charge the unit.
B008DWG5HE,18,22,Ridiculously short charging cord...pay this much for a tablet..you would think they would give a longer cord.
B008DWG5HE,18,23,Left the charger on over-night and again, the screen with the yellow triangle.
B008DWG5HE,18,24,Long battery life as it lastsall day.
B008DWG5HE,19,0,3.5mm headphone jack is on the top of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,19,1,And the sound quality and volume were excellent.
B008DWG5HE,19,2,Videos are full screen with front-facing stereo speakers.
B008DWG5HE,19,3,I am not expert on sound system, so all I cared was whether I can hear sound loud enough.
B008DWG5HE,19,4,Cheap plastic.
B008DWG5HE,19,5,The audio became occasionally inoperative and the headphone jack would crackle when using my ear buds.
B008DWG5HE,19,6,Some people lie about build quality and they claim it makes squeaky sound when they grap it.
B008DWG5HE,19,7,I can get click sound by pressing corner, sticking button (first one was volume, second one was power).
B008DWG5HE,19,8,I sometimes plug in some computer speakers and listen to music at work through it.
B008DWG5HE,19,9,The plastic screeches and groans.One of previous actual "exceptional" devices  I owned was the touch pad, which had a plastic back.
B008DWG5HE,19,10,With infinity, some of my video files were only barely audible even with maximum sound setting if there are any background sounds.
B008DWG5HE,19,11,I cant say I want to keep it though because of a couple of problems that make this tablet a joke.The most significant is the quality of materials.
B008DWG5HE,19,12,Galaxy Note 10.1 is just like others I have no problem hearing sounds.
B008DWG5HE,19,13,Even the plastic peel-off things on the Note was intact.
B008DWG5HE,19,14,You can even close out one or more windows (either individually or all at once) with a simple swipe or tap.Then it also comes with dual speakers so if you don't have earphones, you can still easily hear the video or music you're listening to.
B008DWG5HE,19,15,Speakers stereo separation is very good but the lower frequency sound is poor.6.
B008DWG5HE,19,16,Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine.
B008DWG5HE,19,17,It's so easy to watch videos and movies and shows on it in landscape with those speakers when you're with company.
B008DWG5HE,19,18,I sincerely believe they could have built a better tablet than this (at the price they are asking for it).
B008DWG5HE,19,19,It was run over and still looked good but just didn't work.
B008DWG5HE,19,20,The S note can record sound and record writing as you are taking notes.
B008DWG5HE,19,21,And when I use the Peel remote that controls my TV, DVD, and sound system they are floored.
B008DWG5HE,19,22,Music on any tab to my stereo system is awesome and is quite an issue to talk about when people see me using my tab to run it.
B008DWG5HE,19,23,This is a sacrilegious statement, I know, but hear me out.
B008DWG5HE,19,24,I really believe this tablet wont last at $500 for too long.The second big problem is the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,20,0,Great camera for video and still shooting.
B008DWG5HE,20,1,Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great.
B008DWG5HE,20,2,I then realized this happens mostly for apps that use the front facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,3,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,4,The camera takes nice pictures.
B008DWG5HE,20,5,The camera is very, very mediocre.
B008DWG5HE,20,6,But if you are working with it alone you will see that it is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.The camera is by far one of the weakest things in the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,7,The only issue I could see was no HD display and the rear camera could have been a little better.
B008DWG5HE,20,8,Kies is great and works just as well with photos.
B008DWG5HE,20,9,It has a decent front camera for video chat, and the a decent rear camera with a flash, tablets are not cameras but this one is above average.10)
B008DWG5HE,20,10,Both the front 1.9MP camera and 5MP camera fully live up to their specs.
B008DWG5HE,20,11,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,12,The first thing that stuck out to me were the speakers being in the front, rather than the rear.
B008DWG5HE,20,13,The video quality, at least through Skype, is much better  than the iPad 3 for some reason.
B008DWG5HE,20,14,* Cameras - Amazon removed the images I posted for some reason so just take my word that the cameras work well.
B008DWG5HE,20,15,The only reason I have this four stars was that the camera sometimes does not focus well if you are taking a photo of a room.
B008DWG5HE,20,16,I still like it and will make some time to work with it more.
B008DWG5HE,20,17,Because of the many features it has also almost replaced my digital camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,18,The speakers are loud and front facing, woo-hoo!
B008DWG5HE,20,19,Video chatting works great as well.
B008DWG5HE,20,20,I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet.
B008DWG5HE,20,21,I personally would never use a tablet to take pictures, but if i did, i would be very disappointed.
B008DWG5HE,20,22,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,23,It's everything in one sleek package  I do think that a case is in order as the top of the tablet, housing for the rear facing camera is a little wiggly.
B008DWG5HE,20,24,I guess it make sense for these apps to not allow you to use the Note upside down, otherwise your camera output to apps such as Skype would result in your face showing upside down to the person you would be chatting with at the time.
B008DWG5HE,21,0,This tablet has a fast processor.
B008DWG5HE,21,1,Well done Samsung!The Note is quite responsive, having a quad-core processor and 2Gb RAM.
B008DWG5HE,21,2,I found the s3 to be slow considering it has 2gb of ram.
B008DWG5HE,21,3,When it is at maximum speed, infinity and galaxy browser loaded pages in equal speed.
B008DWG5HE,21,4,Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 16 GB.
B008DWG5HE,21,5,What really sold me on the Note was the hardware: 1.4 GHz QUAD-core processor and 2GB of RAM.
B008DWG5HE,21,6,I got the first Galaxy Tab, thought it was a great size but horrible implementation, too slow, hanging all the time.
B008DWG5HE,21,7,When I played with this tab in the store and found Photoshop Touch on it along with a quad core and 2 gig of ram, I had to have it.
B008DWG5HE,21,8,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,21,9,The note 2 10.1 has twice the ram as the tab model.
B008DWG5HE,21,10,The old tablet had its issues with freezing up after the last update along with not enough ram.
B008DWG5HE,21,11,I think the processor is fine and speedy.
B008DWG5HE,21,12,Obviously, infinity is not 4 times slower than Galaxy Note but this may be reason why my PDF file opened fine on Mantano with Galaxy Note but not on Infinity.Memory: Samsung Galaxy Note - 2GB.
B008DWG5HE,21,13,But once experiencing the stability & speed of Galaxy Note 10.1, I don't think I can go back to infinity or any other android tablet that gives us freeze or crush every hour.=============
B008DWG5HE,21,14,But the same file opens instantaneously on Galaxy Note  and obviously no crush or ANR.So despite infinity being fast system on its own, I have to give this one also to Galaxy Note.Winner: Galaxy Note 10.14.
B008DWG5HE,21,15,Sunspider benchmark of infinity was decently fast so browser should be fast, which again it was when working.
B008DWG5HE,21,16,But after couple hours of use, infinity browser always seemed to slow down or crush.
B008DWG5HE,21,17,Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.
B008DWG5HE,21,18,The extra RAM is also necessary as the Note can perform some "multitasking" by way of a number of apps that have been designed to run alongside each other.
B008DWG5HE,21,19,Don't expect a quad core to be amazingly faster than a dual core, but it can handle concurrent tasks with aplomb.Cons:1.
B008DWG5HE,21,20,Note: the iPad 3 is only 1GHz processor, and dual core, not quad.*
B008DWG5HE,21,21,I have bought a number of tablet styli for other tablets but have been generally disappointed with their performance.
B008DWG5HE,21,22,I also tried using other launchers asi know touch wiz tends to slow down the device down like it has on my s3.
B008DWG5HE,21,23,The latest upgrade really helped performance.
B008DWG5HE,21,24,I tested this by simply going to the same site at same time for couple pages.
B008DWG5HE,22,0,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,1,I bought this 16G tablet and installed a 16G SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,2,The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,3,While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-
B008DWG5HE,22,4,SD card not properly used.
B008DWG5HE,22,5,I purchased a 32GB micro SD card to increase storage space for my videos.
B008DWG5HE,22,6,Also, with their mini-sd drive (I bought the SD 64 gb card) you can put music on there if you didn't want to use Kies.
B008DWG5HE,22,7,It accessed the SD card witout any issues.
B008DWG5HE,22,8,I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.
B008DWG5HE,22,9,you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory?
B008DWG5HE,22,10,When I downloaded a 3.5gb game, it asked me if I wanted to save to external SD instead of on-board memory (YES!).
B008DWG5HE,22,11,Did I mention it has an option for an external SD card to go along with the 32GB that it already has?
B008DWG5HE,22,12,You cannot use Apps2SD, for example, to move apps from the Note's built-in memory to an external SD card without *rooting the device.
B008DWG5HE,22,13,Warning... Samsung tablets and phones do not allow you to store apps in the SD memory.
B008DWG5HE,22,14,It comes with 16 Gb of native storage, but Can be expanded by 64GB with a micro Sd card.One thing that I love about Android devices is you're not stuck with one music or movie player.
B008DWG5HE,22,15,You will need how to install apps and visit the app store.
B008DWG5HE,22,16,SD card slot usles.
B008DWG5HE,22,17,I have a cheap 7" non Samsung tablet and I can move apps as I want.
B008DWG5HE,22,18,It seems reasonable that it is the user who should determine if speed or memory space is more important.
B008DWG5HE,22,19,I bought this partly because of the sd card slot.According to Samsung you can't run apps from it and they can't store their data there.
B008DWG5HE,22,20,I did some reading and decided on the 16GB since the tablet has space for ample expansion, and you can get a far larger micro SD card for the $50 difference- I got the 64GB SanDisk class 10 one.
B008DWG5HE,22,21,All you can put there are pictures, music, etc.
B008DWG5HE,22,22,This was a major concern as the tablet could accept a 64gb micro SD card for expansion and would lend itself to installing more apps in the future.
B008DWG5HE,22,23,Samsung told me that the reason they want apps on the main memory is for speed of access.
B008DWG5HE,22,24,You actually start with more like 11.6GB free space after the OS and whatnot, and 59.5GB on the card (I'm not sure why about that, I think it may have come with stuff on it).
B008DWG5HE,23,0,I really liked note 10.1 until I connected to wifi.
B008DWG5HE,23,1,I don't really need wifi that much and use the note to take notes, and would rather not have to back everything up again, so I'm going without the wifi.
B008DWG5HE,23,2,slow wifi on the note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,23,3,Pleade do a google search for slow wifi on the note 10.1.Tim
B008DWG5HE,23,4,It says in the settings that it's connected to the school network, but when I try to access the internet, it doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,23,5,Perfect for these WiFi devices.
B008DWG5HE,23,6,They are all set up on our wireless network.
B008DWG5HE,23,7,It is useful but for those problems.
B008DWG5HE,23,8,Lots and lots of problems !!!!
B008DWG5HE,23,9,I don't know if the problem is with the device, android OS, the school network or any combination of the three but the problem is that since this device isn't as popular as the iPad, the problem isn't going to be solved anytime soon.So if you need reliable access to wifi, this device may not be for you.
B008DWG5HE,23,10,My girlfriend has taken video footage with her phone (an Apple phone, that she has never had a problem with she says) of this device freaking out for minutes on end.
B008DWG5HE,23,11,Has some issues.
B008DWG5HE,23,12,Works without WiFi.
B008DWG5HE,23,13,So no websites which use Java can work....and I believe this is on all Android devices.
B008DWG5HE,23,14,The device must be reset.
B008DWG5HE,23,15,It connects quickly and hasn't had any issues.
B008DWG5HE,23,16,WiFi suddenly doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,23,17,I also connect to multiple WiFi networks at work and other locations and never have an issue trying to connect.-
B008DWG5HE,23,18,Web pages load quickly but not as quickly as other devices.
B008DWG5HE,23,19,I have NO perfomance issues.... everything works very smooth.... not sure where some of the reviews on the web state that it is slow..... whatever...
B008DWG5HE,23,20,You also can not connect your printer either via WIFI or direct.
B008DWG5HE,23,21,MAJOR peeve:  This is a mobile device which most people are going to use as a web device.
B008DWG5HE,23,22,Missing parts not once, not twice but 3 times, and all boxes were open.
B008DWG5HE,23,23,I also experienced the wifi dropping on the second note I tried.
B008DWG5HE,23,24,The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router.
B008DWG5HE,24,0,We can't do anything on it, we can't even get to the home screen without it going nuts.
B008DWG5HE,24,1,The keyboard does not work well.
B008DWG5HE,24,2,Be careful about screen protectors: most are "squishy" and so don't really work with the stylus.
B008DWG5HE,24,3,However lately when he moves it a certain way the screen gets lines across it and is unreadable.
B008DWG5HE,24,4,The continual problems I have had with the note is that the left side of the touch screen lacks sensitivity when using the virtual keyboard.
B008DWG5HE,24,5,And touching the wrong part of the screen will send you to some unexpected places.
B008DWG5HE,24,6,Everything on screen is still visible, just no touch function at all with either finger or pen.
B008DWG5HE,24,7,I'm sure time will cure that issue.
B008DWG5HE,24,8,If he moves it when that happens, the screen will straighten out for a bit and then go back to lines.
B008DWG5HE,24,9,I often have to press screen buttons multiple times to get it to register.-
B008DWG5HE,24,10,To get it to work you have to detach the tablet from the cover then move it.
B008DWG5HE,24,11,I am a avid typer (can you tell by the length of my article?), but for typing I was satisfied with using the touch screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,12,There are times when you press a button or select something with the pen and it does not register, and you have to press a second time.-
B008DWG5HE,24,13,However, the potentiometer was very sensitive and at first I over adjusted so that the pen was writing on the screen when it wasn't even touching the glass.
B008DWG5HE,24,14,It comes with a pen, and it works pretty well.
B008DWG5HE,24,15,If you put a magnet near a spot on the screen (for example: if your tablet case/folio has a magnet for attaching a strap to it, and you then fold the folio so that the magnet is behind your tablet and behind the screen within 1 cm), the S-Pen's position will not match what shows up on the screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,16,The S-Pen works using magnetic inductance, and therefore, magnets that are within 1 or 2 centimeters of the screen can affect the proper functioning of the S-Pen.
B008DWG5HE,24,17,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,24,18,After a week's use, this is proving to be the most productive tablet for work yet.
B008DWG5HE,24,19,The "n" and "m" keys often do not register properly causing multiple delays in touch typing.
B008DWG5HE,24,20,This just works much better for me in a business environment.The S pen takes a bit of getting used to but I find it becoming more and more instinctive to use.
B008DWG5HE,24,21,The touchscreen keyboard goes nuts with ghost typing; it opens and closes programs, goes from one page to the other, and has acutally changed settings as well.
B008DWG5HE,24,22,The only downside is I have yet to find a really good protective case for the Note.
B008DWG5HE,24,23,The tablet feel in hand is great and I actually didn't even put a case on it!
B008DWG5HE,24,24,Turned out the pen was attached onto the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,25,0,Wish I would have gone with the I-Pad.
B008DWG5HE,25,1,iPad is a much better device.
B008DWG5HE,25,2,I would rather have all Samsung Note  10.1's then I would Ipads.
B008DWG5HE,25,3,This device runs Android 2.3.
B008DWG5HE,25,4,I debated for a while between the ipad and the samsung galaxy note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,5,This device is much better than what all the reviews say.
B008DWG5HE,25,6,It can do everything the iPad can do, and more.
B008DWG5HE,25,7,I have owned the original iPad, The iPad 2, The New iPad, HTC Flyer 7" with scribe, original Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and now the Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,8,From that outlook, it is better than the Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,9,I'm sure time will cure that issue.
B008DWG5HE,25,10,Samsung blames the printer that has no problems with other android or even a ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,11,It's Samsung time now.
B008DWG5HE,25,12,This device is very similar to the Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,13,Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,25,14,I also didn't like how on ipad you can only line up the Apps in little rows.
B008DWG5HE,25,15,And I confess, I bought one of the first iPads when they came out, have upgraded every time since so am pretty much married to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,25,16,I'll update my review later after that update to let y'all know what I observe.
B008DWG5HE,25,17,***One more thing...I know my next phone will be Samsung Galaxy Note II.
B008DWG5HE,25,18,Samsung Galaxy Note Rules the Day.
B008DWG5HE,25,19,Have you???Hope Samsung is reading these reviews cuz i have a few suggestions for the Note line of tablets-1.
B008DWG5HE,25,20,I found another app that works better for me.
B008DWG5HE,25,21,I have an iPad and mini IPad and not sure if galaxy is as friendly use as apple products.
B008DWG5HE,25,22,I own many Samsung products, and am delighted with all.
B008DWG5HE,25,23,The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time.
B008DWG5HE,25,24,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,26,0,Minus another for that port being for a proprietary power plug.
B008DWG5HE,26,1,You can transfer files but the power output from standard USB ports is not strong enough to power the Note.
B008DWG5HE,26,2,Mainly, when I try and charge the Note while using it, the charging cable fits into the bottom of the device.
B008DWG5HE,26,3,When I plug in a USB external hard drive to the tablet, the tablet tells me that the USB device requires too much power to operate (stick with the thumb drives, or AC adapter powered external HDDs).
B008DWG5HE,26,4,Just be aware, you will NOT be able to charge this baby by simply plugging the charging cable into the USB port of your computer.
B008DWG5HE,26,5,However the lack of a HDMI or USB port hampers its versatility.
B008DWG5HE,26,6,Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such.
B008DWG5HE,26,7,I will, however, note that the utter lack of external ports is disappointing.
B008DWG5HE,26,8,Apparently the output from a PC USB port isn't enough to charge the Note (which I can understand).
B008DWG5HE,26,9,I even tried connecting the tablet to the USB adapter to a USB SD card reader and finally to an SD card.
B008DWG5HE,26,10,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,26,11,I like the Lightning port better than the old 30 pin connector but still, proprietary?
B008DWG5HE,26,12,I would expect proprietary connectors as part of the draconian iApple ecosystem, but Android devices should all have standard USB ports and separate power sockets.
B008DWG5HE,26,13,To plug a flash/thumb drive directly into the Note 10.1 you have to buy a adapter.
B008DWG5HE,26,14,The cable gets mashed on the bottom of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,26,15,isn't a solid-quality keyboard case yet.
B008DWG5HE,26,16,But unless Samsung starts making more pragmatic devices, I'm going to look somewhere else.In short - minus one star for only one port.
B008DWG5HE,26,17,When I try to charge it from a source that doesn't provide enough power (it needs 5v 2A), the tablet tells me that it is receiving inadequate power.
B008DWG5HE,26,18,You can work with any bluetooth keyboard as I understand it, though I've not done so yet.
B008DWG5HE,26,19,Bummed to have to buy a charger now when this one should be came with the correct charger.
B008DWG5HE,26,20,Note 10.1, I got an additional cable... still not cool.Okay, I don't have to charge the Note that often so it is not too bad.
B008DWG5HE,26,21,The Nexus 7 was nice, but was too small for tethering to my DSLR and lacked a micro SD port.
B008DWG5HE,26,22,You actually have to plug your wall charger into it then then to the TV and once that is done it works great!
B008DWG5HE,26,23,I can't then go ahead and place the device on my lap because I will pinch the charging cable.
B008DWG5HE,26,24,You can't just hook up a micro-USB cable for charging, so if you didn't bring your Samsung charger, you're out of luck.
B008DWG5HE,27,0,After a week's use, this is proving to be the most productive tablet for work yet.
B008DWG5HE,27,1,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,27,2,I bought first one, during the trial, it freezes soon, So, I returned it and excanged with new one.
B008DWG5HE,27,3,I have had it for a week now, and still no crash.
B008DWG5HE,27,4,Last week it went into a reboot mode and I could not get it to turn off.
B008DWG5HE,27,5,I have used the Note 10.1 now for three weeks.
B008DWG5HE,27,6,It freezes too often.
B008DWG5HE,27,7,It freezes too often.
B008DWG5HE,27,8,I used all three of them several times a day for a period of three weeks.
B008DWG5HE,27,9,Keeps freezing and then randomly rebooting.
B008DWG5HE,27,10,I returned it in 1 month, it had similar problems.
B008DWG5HE,27,11,S Note is the highlight of the unit and the reason I bought the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,27,12,But as soon as we/she learns the operating system I'm sure it will be just fine.
B008DWG5HE,27,13,I have had it for a couple of months and it has NEVER crashed on me, not once!
B008DWG5HE,27,14,If you already have the browser in split screen mode, it doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,27,15,The first 3 weeks I learned something more useful every day.
B008DWG5HE,27,16,but it occurs the same problem.
B008DWG5HE,27,17,Weird things like when the screen was locked and I rotated the tablet there would be a flash of the home screen or one of the programs running in the background.
B008DWG5HE,27,18,So I got my Note 10.1 a few days ago a I`ve been playing with it, both for work and recreation.
B008DWG5HE,27,19,A month in, it keeps crashing.
B008DWG5HE,27,20,Every week, I find something new that I can do with this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,27,21,Slow, locks up and doesn't do much.
B008DWG5HE,27,22,Not only would it freeze up it would lose what I was working on.
B008DWG5HE,27,23,The lack of that last star is for slight difference in screen quality.
B008DWG5HE,27,24,I have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it.
B008DWG5HE,28,0,It took 2 weeks for repairs.
B008DWG5HE,28,1,According to Samsung customer service it wont be unblocked any time soon.
B008DWG5HE,28,2,Poor Inspection process and Bypassing Customer Service responsbility.
B008DWG5HE,28,3,Tried discussing with Samsung support and they were no help.
B008DWG5HE,28,4,Samsung's customer service experience.
B008DWG5HE,28,5,Samsung customer service is horrible.
B008DWG5HE,28,6,The shipment received on time.
B008DWG5HE,28,7,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,28,8,They said to return it back to sam's club, sam's club says to contact Samsung instead.
B008DWG5HE,28,9,Called customer support and they had me reset it to factory settings.
B008DWG5HE,28,10,If I bought the product from Amazon, why do I have to contact the maufacturer's Website.
B008DWG5HE,28,11,If Amazon is selling a product, I expect Amazon customer service to provide the required service.
B008DWG5HE,28,12,People talk about having to call into Samsung support over and over and over again, the flippant attitudes of the support people, and the unwillingness for Samsung to stand behind their product and provide a new unit when it's obvious a unit is defective.For the complete lack of customer support and poor quality/design, I will not be buying ANY Samsung tablet.
B008DWG5HE,28,13,Made my purchase in February and have had nothing but problems.
B008DWG5HE,28,14,Immediately notified Amazon.
B008DWG5HE,28,15,I tried a "do it yourself repair that did not work and order a new device.
B008DWG5HE,28,16,Amazon responded promptly to contact Samsung Website.
B008DWG5HE,28,17,This would be ok if it fixed the problem but it didn't.
B008DWG5HE,28,18,So, I decieded returning it as well.
B008DWG5HE,28,19,I guess I'll have to send it in for service.
B008DWG5HE,28,20,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B008DWG5HE,28,21,I hope I don't have any warranty issues...
B008DWG5HE,28,22,NOT HAPPY!!!! Got a defective product!
B008DWG5HE,28,23,if you purchase their products you are on your own after they get your money.
B008DWG5HE,28,24,I wanted to send this unit back to Amazon.com but Samsung has held up the progress because of the adapter and my 30 days  return warranty has expired with Amazon.I would have never had this problem with Apple.
B008DWG5HE,29,0,Skype app for Android works really well!5)
B008DWG5HE,29,1,I found another app that works better for me.
B008DWG5HE,29,2,I will update as I get more with my Note in the future.FYI: I am an expert in windows and linux.
B008DWG5HE,29,3,For a while it would freeze up a lot while using the note app.
B008DWG5HE,29,4,Even if you install printer share, it is hard to use and not all apps work with it.
B008DWG5HE,29,5,I need to do more than a few things at once and I need all of my features at the same time.
B008DWG5HE,29,6,I have owned 8 Android Tablets and one Windows tablet.
B008DWG5HE,29,7,I installed it because my Windows 7 PC would not properly identify my Note until KIES was installed.
B008DWG5HE,29,8,The keyboard does not work well.
B008DWG5HE,29,9,I did a hard set twice and it came back as fast as new but it would slow again as I added Apps back in.
B008DWG5HE,29,10,I need a few apps that work, not 20 where half of them are crap and the other half half work with one or two stand outs.
B008DWG5HE,29,11,Not sure what changed, maybe it was an update from Samsung, but it seems to be working better now.One of my biggest pet peeves is you can't print from this unless you print to a Samsung printer.
B008DWG5HE,29,12,You can also resize the windows and move them around.Touch Wiz is on top of Android and Works Seamlessly with it.
B008DWG5HE,29,13,I am also disappointed that you can't shrink windows down to a single bar at the bottom of the screen like you can in Microsoft Windows for PC.
B008DWG5HE,29,14,Instead, if you want to make a window disappear from the screen, you have to close the app appearing in the window.
B008DWG5HE,29,15,No reboots, complex downloads or installs etc.then cam iMacs and time machines and MacBooks.I found that I spent way less time fixing computers and instead was using them.
B008DWG5HE,29,16,Slow OS updating.
B008DWG5HE,29,17,You can only print with a Samsung device or eprint, which mostly just prints the link, not the actual page you would like to print.
B008DWG5HE,29,18,The multitasking is little more than samsung showing you 2 apps at once; you still can only really do one useful thing at once.
B008DWG5HE,29,19,Unfortunately, only selected apps will work in the multi-window system.
B008DWG5HE,29,20,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,29,21,I would have rated this 5 stars if it wasn't slow.
B008DWG5HE,29,22,Since I started using this a few have updated themselves and fixed the problem, but it varies by the app maker.
B008DWG5HE,29,23,The OS was fast at first but as I added Apps it got slower and choppy.
B008DWG5HE,29,24,I had about 100 apps installed and 2 widgets on the home screen.

B00CYQPM42,1,0,Not enough apps.
B00CYQPM42,1,1,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,1,2,There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation.
B00CYQPM42,1,3,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,1,4,Also if i want to install google apps it is possible.
B00CYQPM42,1,5,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,1,6,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,1,7,I have found many useful lifestyle apps (food diaries, calorie counters, etc).
B00CYQPM42,1,8,not playing videos.
B00CYQPM42,1,9,I'm really enjoying all the Apps and playing "Candycrush"!
B00CYQPM42,1,10,The only downfall is no Google play store access.
B00CYQPM42,1,11,my daughter really wanted the furby boom app for her furby and we found out later it was only available through google play..
B00CYQPM42,1,12,app.
B00CYQPM42,1,13,You know there HAS to be an app for that!
B00CYQPM42,1,14,Yes, this is tied to the Amazon App store.
B00CYQPM42,1,15,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,1,16,LOVE MY KINDLE FIRE. it works great and my faimly can use for various different sites, apps and books on it,
B00CYQPM42,1,17,I do read Kindle books.
B00CYQPM42,1,18,I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet.
B00CYQPM42,1,19,If Amazon would just switch to Google Play for the app store, then there is nothing that would stop them from ruling the world!
B00CYQPM42,1,20,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,1,21,With an Android device, you can access the Amazon Android store, but with a Kindle Fire, you cannot access the Google Play store.
B00CYQPM42,1,22,My Granddaughter plays games on it and loves it too now she does not have to play them on my little phone.
B00CYQPM42,1,23,The limitations put on the Kindle regarding apps is a drawback for those used to using google apps.
B00CYQPM42,1,24,They do not play.
B00CYQPM42,2,0,PRICED JUST RIGHT.
B00CYQPM42,2,1,Got it at a great price
B00CYQPM42,2,2,Great for the price.

B00CYQPM42,3,0,Battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,1,battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,2,aweful battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,3,battery doesn't last.
B00CYQPM42,3,4,The battery life is much longer.
B00CYQPM42,3,5,Already went threw the hints on how to save battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,6,The battery life is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,3,7,Battery life is pretty good.
B00CYQPM42,3,8,Everything works great, but the battery life is not nearly as long as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,3,9,Battery life is great so far.-
B00CYQPM42,3,10,Not to happy with the battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,11,Battery life is ok - probably need to recharge every other day with normal use.
B00CYQPM42,3,12,Have to charge it almost every day.
B00CYQPM42,3,13,The lousy battery life is my main complaint, however.
B00CYQPM42,3,14,Seems battery doesn't last as long as first kindle.
B00CYQPM42,3,15,Light weightBattery life is over 10 hours.
B00CYQPM42,3,16,And the battery life is the best I have ever had.
B00CYQPM42,3,17,Battery life is not as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,3,18,My previous kindle charged quickly even in use and had an amazing battery life!
B00CYQPM42,3,19,Nice, but does not hold a charge long enough.
B00CYQPM42,3,20,I expected the battery to last much longer.
B00CYQPM42,3,21,There are battery savers that shut down what isn’t needed and does make a difference in battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,22,It is very easy to use, has great battery life, and is light in your hands.
B00CYQPM42,3,23,Really good.
B00CYQPM42,3,24,Battery life is solid.
B00CYQPM42,4,0,The sound is also much better and louder.
B00CYQPM42,4,1,Sound good.
B00CYQPM42,4,2,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,3,This feels really good in your hand and the screen is BEAUTIFUL.
B00CYQPM42,4,4,very nice apps, the resolution and sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,5,The colors are richer and sound is much better.
B00CYQPM42,4,6,Sound is really good (not home theater quality or anything) but better than any phone I've heard.
B00CYQPM42,4,7,And the sound!
B00CYQPM42,4,8,I feel like the hd speakers are a little better than this, but not much.
B00CYQPM42,4,9,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,4,10,The HD quality is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,11,The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.
B00CYQPM42,4,12,Really great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,13,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,14,Great Device, Better than expected.
B00CYQPM42,4,15,The built in speakers are also better than my iPad 1.
B00CYQPM42,4,16,I would tell anyone that this is a great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,17,The screen resolution is fantastic.
B00CYQPM42,4,18,the audio books sound very good
B00CYQPM42,4,19,The sound while listening to audiobooks and movies is very good.
B00CYQPM42,4,20,The kindle display is good and the speakers are terrific for such a small device.
B00CYQPM42,4,21,I have an iPad with one speaker n the Kindle sounds a lot better.
B00CYQPM42,4,22,The color is amazing and the sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,23,It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder.
B00CYQPM42,4,24,The screen resolution, colors, and brightness as well as the sound quality cannot be matched by the other tablets out there.
B00CYQPM42,5,0,this is not good because it does not seem you can take a picture of something you are looking at.
B00CYQPM42,5,1,Takes great pictures!
B00CYQPM42,5,2,I did not like the way the camera was.
B00CYQPM42,5,3,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,4,The picture quality is absurd.
B00CYQPM42,5,5,The camera is awesome...
B00CYQPM42,5,6,My only love about it is the camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,7,Clear picture, quality sound.
B00CYQPM42,5,8,As great as the ads said it would be!
B00CYQPM42,5,9,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,10,It could only be more perfect if it had a front facing camera!
B00CYQPM42,5,11,she does however have a problem with the camera part, apparently you can only take pictures that are facing the front of the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,5,12,VERY GOOD! Love this thing...........except the camera is on the WRONG side.
B00CYQPM42,5,13,Very easy to use and the picture quality is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,5,14,I also don't like the front only camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,15,Love the clear, crisp picture.
B00CYQPM42,5,16,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,5,17,Great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,5,18,The only camera is on the front side (screen side), so taking video or a picture with it is difficult because you can't see the screen.
B00CYQPM42,5,19,The picture quality is awesome and I love playing games on it.
B00CYQPM42,5,20,Picture is clear, color is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,21,Very good better than what a t I expected.The only thing is the camera it only have front and not back.But I guess that's why it have the kindle hdx8.9 cause that have both.
B00CYQPM42,5,22,The camera could be a little better, but very nice to be able to Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,23,A great tablet at a great price.
B00CYQPM42,5,24,Great tablet at a great price...
B00CYQPM42,6,0,The processor is fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,1,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,6,2,Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.
B00CYQPM42,6,3,The screen is beautiful and it is incredibly fast!
B00CYQPM42,6,4,Awesome screen.
B00CYQPM42,6,5,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,6,6,Great value!
B00CYQPM42,6,7,Amazing, Fast, Beautiful display.
B00CYQPM42,6,8,The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD.
B00CYQPM42,6,9,The unit has a lovely display, it's responsive and a great overall tablet.
B00CYQPM42,6,10,the quad core processing unit makes gaming easy and reading smooth.
B00CYQPM42,6,11,It's extremely faster now, light weight, the screen is amazingly clear.
B00CYQPM42,6,12,The improved 'carousel' and apps screen is also a nice improvement.
B00CYQPM42,6,13,Great Value for Optimal Performance.
B00CYQPM42,6,14,OH my the screen is gorgeous.
B00CYQPM42,6,15,The screen resolution is perfect.
B00CYQPM42,6,16,Fast, easy to use, intuitive and did I mention that screen?
B00CYQPM42,6,17,I like how much faster the processor and Wi-Fi are too!
B00CYQPM42,6,18,This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class.
B00CYQPM42,6,19,First things first; the screen!
B00CYQPM42,6,20,I can load webpages as fast as my laptop - never have been able to do that on a tablet before.
B00CYQPM42,6,21,Very Good but not intuitive.
B00CYQPM42,6,22,The screen is gorgeous.
B00CYQPM42,6,23,Screen is gorgeous and so clear it's like 3D at times.
B00CYQPM42,6,24,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,7,0,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,7,1,She has so much more storage space.
B00CYQPM42,7,2,However, this tablet is so much faster and with the 64 GB of storage I can do so much more.
B00CYQPM42,7,3,MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229.
B00CYQPM42,7,4,Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover.
B00CYQPM42,7,5,64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB.
B00CYQPM42,7,6,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,7,7,The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB.
B00CYQPM42,7,8,In this day and age, a table ought to have a Micro SD memory card slot for expansion, and an HDMI connector - ESPECIALLY a media tablet like these!
B00CYQPM42,7,9,This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size.
B00CYQPM42,7,10,To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80.
B00CYQPM42,7,11,Movies, books, audio, and apps all run in superior order, with the only down side, is memory expandability (an extra slot for loading more solid state memory as a card).
B00CYQPM42,7,12,too many slot pop ups.
B00CYQPM42,7,13,I got the 32 GB version, so there is plenty of room for games and other apps.
B00CYQPM42,7,14,Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at $229 for the 16GB of memory model ($309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature.
B00CYQPM42,7,15,32GB will provide you more memory space for pics, hd movies, etc. Apps eat up a lot of memory quickly.I recommend that Amazon provide the approx number of movies etc can be stored on each kindle model with its specs.
B00CYQPM42,7,16,If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.
B00CYQPM42,7,17,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,7,18,To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40.
B00CYQPM42,7,19,Not the best tablet, but perhaps the best value.
B00CYQPM42,7,20,PRIME VIDEOS:-----------------------------This is the main reason I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version.
B00CYQPM42,7,21,If you're not sold on the reigning king of the tablet space, this is a good option for most users.
B00CYQPM42,7,22,If the latter is something you expect to do regularly, you might want to consider the 32GB or 64GB versions, or pay the additional price for the 4G version, which is available on the 7" tablet for the first time.
B00CYQPM42,7,23,The original Fire did not have a MicroSD slot either, and I was hoping Amazon would add one, but they did not.
B00CYQPM42,7,24,For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL
B00CYQPM42,8,0,Works great.
B00CYQPM42,8,1,I know they are working on it , but not fixed yet.
B00CYQPM42,8,2,Good device.
B00CYQPM42,8,3,Great for watching movies and surfing the web.
B00CYQPM42,8,4,Watching movies works for me - the 7" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.
B00CYQPM42,8,5,It works very well for music, reading docucuments and general web page browsing mhm habit video watching I is quite unreliable.
B00CYQPM42,8,6,Love It!! What a great device!!
B00CYQPM42,8,7,I do however have problems reading and watching movies while out in the sun.
B00CYQPM42,8,8,Web cripple.
B00CYQPM42,8,9,Keep up the good work Amazon!
B00CYQPM42,8,10,It's Great.
B00CYQPM42,8,11,Otherwise a v good device for a commuter who likes to watch a movie while traveling to and fro work each day,display is exceptional.
B00CYQPM42,8,12,I take it everywhere and use it all the time for work and play.
B00CYQPM42,8,13,The 7" is working great.
B00CYQPM42,8,14,not playing videos.
B00CYQPM42,8,15,Great traveling companion.
B00CYQPM42,8,16,I read and write email, surf the web, read and listen to books and watch videos.
B00CYQPM42,8,17,Regardless if your looking for something to watch Netflix on, read books, and surf the web it's excellent.
B00CYQPM42,8,18,Also love Fashioning and web surfing on it.
B00CYQPM42,8,19,It's easy to use and provides a high-quality experience for reading e-Books, browsing the Internet and watching video.
B00CYQPM42,8,20,I use it for not only reading but gaming, email, and surfing the net.
B00CYQPM42,8,21,I bought the tablet so I could watch my television shows while I eat without having to hall around my laptop around.
B00CYQPM42,8,22,Well I have to tell ya that this little device is as good as Amazon says!
B00CYQPM42,8,23,Good browser.
B00CYQPM42,8,24,I watched movies, streamed music, watched video, surfed, read articles and books, used the alarm and calender, used yahoo weather app, played games.
B00CYQPM42,9,0,I am using it to write this review, actually.
B00CYQPM42,9,1,The touch sceen on the iPad also works a lot smoother and is more accurate.
B00CYQPM42,9,2,Very sensitive to the touch.
B00CYQPM42,9,3,I normally don't write reviews, even when I like something.
B00CYQPM42,9,4,They are small and fit comfortable in your hands, easy set up, easy screens to screens, everything is at your finger tips.
B00CYQPM42,9,5,It works very sporadic.
B00CYQPM42,9,6,I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).
B00CYQPM42,9,7,Great Tablet.
B00CYQPM42,9,8,What I do like is when it does work it's pretty accurate as far as words.
B00CYQPM42,9,9,Love Love Love.
B00CYQPM42,9,10,I love this because it substitutes for my laptop and is easier to carry with me in my purse.
B00CYQPM42,9,11,The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen.
B00CYQPM42,9,12,The notepad app. is a nice feature.
B00CYQPM42,9,13,Great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,9,14,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,9,15,The reason I only gave it  4 stars is some of the features that come with it don't work as they should.
B00CYQPM42,9,16,One in three times it will work.
B00CYQPM42,9,17,There's Candy Crush, which is important, of course :) I own an iPad, too; but it's too big and heavy for me to read and use for school work.
B00CYQPM42,9,18,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,9,19,I love the ability to highlight, write notes, etc. on books and PDF files.
B00CYQPM42,9,20,Excellence in the palm of my hand.
B00CYQPM42,9,21,(In my opinion anyway) the iPad is a lot easier to navigate around on, speech to text always works as well.
B00CYQPM42,9,22,It has a great screen, it's lightweight, and the price is right.
B00CYQPM42,9,23,I love this tablet- as a college student I am able to have my books with me everywhere I go.
B00CYQPM42,9,24,Now I can't wait to get a nice case to keep it safe and some clear anti-glare screen covers.
B00CYQPM42,10,0,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,10,1,Nice tablet, but... Great little tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,2,Really great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,3,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,4,Very nice.
B00CYQPM42,10,5,Works great.
B00CYQPM42,10,6,The 7" is working great.
B00CYQPM42,10,7,I never had a tablet before and this is nice because it is the right size to take any place with you.
B00CYQPM42,10,8,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,9,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,10,10,GREAT PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,10,11,But all in all, if you like thin, fast it is great.
B00CYQPM42,10,12,Very nice product
B00CYQPM42,10,13,Another great product.
B00CYQPM42,10,14,Very Nice.
B00CYQPM42,10,15,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,10,16,A great product.
B00CYQPM42,10,17,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,10,18,Very nice display
B00CYQPM42,10,19,Nice product and very easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,10,20,Just the right size!
B00CYQPM42,10,21,Really good.
B00CYQPM42,10,22,For the price it was a great deal.
B00CYQPM42,10,23,Good size screen and colors.
B00CYQPM42,10,24,Display and refresh are great!
B00CYQPM42,11,0,The placement of the USB port for charger is a great improvement.
B00CYQPM42,11,1,I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.
B00CYQPM42,11,2,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,11,3,The is some glare in bright light but that is the trade-off for color.The included apps are good enough.
B00CYQPM42,11,4,With the wifi off…battery life is very good.
B00CYQPM42,11,5,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,11,6,When I realized too late that it had no HDMI out, I bought a Tronsmart miracast device.
B00CYQPM42,11,7,The improved 'carousel' and apps screen is also a nice improvement.
B00CYQPM42,11,8,This device is well designed, color is excellent, good battery life, good sized screen, easy to use and generally all around handy device to have and the price is excellent for what you get.
B00CYQPM42,11,9,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,11,10,The display quality is truly awesome, the screen size is perfect for games and reading.
B00CYQPM42,11,11,Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One.
B00CYQPM42,11,12,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,11,13,Movies look great, games look great, photos and games look great.
B00CYQPM42,11,14,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,11,15,It's like a mini laptop to go!
B00CYQPM42,11,16,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,11,17,Then they took away the HDMI port which I use often to play a movies on my TV.
B00CYQPM42,11,18,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,11,19,The Lack of even a mini USB port.
B00CYQPM42,11,20,Instead of placing the USB port on the bottom of the HDX (like it is on the HD) it is placed at the top left side which helps when using the carrying case.
B00CYQPM42,11,21,It will work but not as smoothly or easily as a simple cable would.
B00CYQPM42,11,22,Everything works great, but the battery life is not nearly as long as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,11,23,Easy to use, lots of apps, light weight, and the screen is very clear.
B00CYQPM42,11,24,Watching movies works for me - the 7" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.
B00CYQPM42,12,0,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,12,1,It is so easy to run and does so many things.'
B00CYQPM42,12,2,They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.
B00CYQPM42,12,3,I love it.
B00CYQPM42,12,4,Easy to navigate.love
B00CYQPM42,12,5,I love it so far.
B00CYQPM42,12,6,I love it!
B00CYQPM42,12,7,Love it!!!
B00CYQPM42,12,8,It's Great.
B00CYQPM42,12,9,like he says, it does it all, and the graphics are great and so easy to take along wherever you go.
B00CYQPM42,12,10,So far this thing is GREAT.
B00CYQPM42,12,11,Operates fast and smooth.
B00CYQPM42,12,12,I love it.
B00CYQPM42,12,13,I know they are working on it , but not fixed yet.
B00CYQPM42,12,14,The only thing is that the HDX has a different look for the Android Operating System which is actually very nice.
B00CYQPM42,12,15,This thing is great!
B00CYQPM42,12,16,Display is amazingly sharp, and the android OS is very fast.
B00CYQPM42,12,17,A great tablet at a great price.
B00CYQPM42,12,18,Great tablet at a great price...
B00CYQPM42,12,19,She loves it.
B00CYQPM42,12,20,Easy to operate and easy to carry with her wherever she goes
B00CYQPM42,12,21,it..love it.
B00CYQPM42,12,22,love it.
B00CYQPM42,12,23,It works very sporadic.
B00CYQPM42,12,24,Excellent Device but very resiticted operationg system.
B00CYQPM42,13,0,Great product!
B00CYQPM42,13,1,If I had known I wouldn't have purchased this product.
B00CYQPM42,13,2,Great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,3,Great customer service!!
B00CYQPM42,13,4,I returned this product.
B00CYQPM42,13,5,I even called customer service and they said there's was a problem with it.
B00CYQPM42,13,6,This product will replace iPads in no time.My Dad loves the MayDay.
B00CYQPM42,13,7,Thank you Amazon for making such a wonderful product and for having such wonderful customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,8,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,13,9,Plus great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,10,Keep up the great work Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,13,11,GREAT PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,13,12,I have never had a problem with Amazon in all the years that I have been their customer.
B00CYQPM42,13,13,Congratulations to Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,13,14,So I contacted Amazon customer service and let me just say they really are as amazing as everyone says!
B00CYQPM42,13,15,I'm pretty aggravated any time I have to deal with Amazon Customer Service.
B00CYQPM42,13,16,I think they are a great value and being backed by amazon means they will be supported for a long time.
B00CYQPM42,13,17,You now must purchase an additional product from amazon at a cost of around $100.
B00CYQPM42,13,18,I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one.
B00CYQPM42,13,19,Easy to use and if you do have a question great customer service if quickly available.
B00CYQPM42,13,20,However, I am largely happy with my purchase, and am definitely happy with Amazon's customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,21,He's not real computer savvy and this is his first tablet and he's been able to do all the things without having to "call for help" from me or the helpful person at Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,13,22,It was the best customer service experience I've ever had.
B00CYQPM42,13,23,Although it's old tech now, one thing I love about Samsung products is they LAST.
B00CYQPM42,13,24,I placed my order on November 15th and received it on November 18th.
B00CYQPM42,14,0,I also own a Samsung Note 8, several iPads and have several other tablets as well.
B00CYQPM42,14,1,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,14,2,My next was an iPad 2 and then a Microsoft Surface Pro.
B00CYQPM42,14,3,Not the best tablet, but perhaps the best value.
B00CYQPM42,14,4,My first was a Samsung Galaxy 7.5.
B00CYQPM42,14,5,This device is the best digital do hicky I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,14,6,Each of my devices seems to fit a particular niche and I very much like them as well.
B00CYQPM42,14,7,Good Product!
B00CYQPM42,14,8,Spearkers, one of the best in relation to same size tabsSmooth software.
B00CYQPM42,14,9,Cheaper than an ipad mini with a better screen, this device is a no brainer.
B00CYQPM42,14,10,Although it's old tech now, one thing I love about Samsung products is they LAST.
B00CYQPM42,14,11,Great buy for the value.
B00CYQPM42,14,12,Great improvement!
B00CYQPM42,14,13,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,14,14,For him it's a nice improvement from the iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,14,15,Amazing device.
B00CYQPM42,14,16,This is by far my best experience with a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,14,17,Better than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,14,18,Better than my ipad.
B00CYQPM42,14,19,It was right there for free in the app store and works beautifully on this device.
B00CYQPM42,14,20,The device is everything I hoped for.
B00CYQPM42,14,21,If you can afford it the iPad is two times the machine.
B00CYQPM42,14,22,Love it!
B00CYQPM42,14,23,I am a medical professional and must have epocrates installed on my device.
B00CYQPM42,14,24,Thirdly, everything seems to work nicely.
B00CYQPM42,15,0,Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.
B00CYQPM42,15,1,I have been sent 3 Kindle Fire HDXs and they all had the same problem.
B00CYQPM42,15,2,Kindle Fire HDX.
B00CYQPM42,15,3,There are 4 obvious shadows at the bottom of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,4,kindle fire 7 Quit working.
B00CYQPM42,15,5,Kindle vs Kindle Fire HD vs Fire HDX.
B00CYQPM42,15,6,The device is noticeable lighter (395g for Kindle Fire HD vs 303g for Kindle Fire HDX).
B00CYQPM42,15,7,Sent 3 Kindle Fire HDX-All Defective.
B00CYQPM42,15,8,I am very disappointed with the new kindle fire hdx.
B00CYQPM42,15,9,Kindle Fire HDX 7", HDX Display  I like it because it is lighter than previous ones.
B00CYQPM42,15,10,As for the rest, the screen is very sharp, and colors are great.
B00CYQPM42,15,11,Defective Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,15,12,Is it worth it to upgrade from Kindle Fire to Kindle Fire HDX?
B00CYQPM42,15,13,The interface is polished, the screen is bright and sharp.
B00CYQPM42,15,14,There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX.
B00CYQPM42,15,15,I am not very happy with this Kindle Fire HDX.
B00CYQPM42,15,16,This is the middle model of the three models that Amazon is shipping this year: the Kindle Fire HD, the Kindle Fire HDX (this tablet), and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9".
B00CYQPM42,15,17,The display on this Fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year's model as well as this year's model of the Fire HD.
B00CYQPM42,15,18,Kindle Fire HDX 7" I like my Kindle Fire HDX very well and does all I need it to do.
B00CYQPM42,15,19,The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.
B00CYQPM42,15,20,The front page was a bookshelf which is ok but couldn’t organize like the reg kindle.Kindle Fire HD:  I hate the carousel on kindle fire HD.
B00CYQPM42,15,21,Not sure if you can change the screen rotation.
B00CYQPM42,15,22,There must be a better place for that  button.I do like  the Kindle Fire
B00CYQPM42,15,23,Secondly, the screen resolution is amazing ... far better than my old Kindle Fire.
B00CYQPM42,15,24,screen is sharp.
B00CYQPM42,16,0,To few apps.
B00CYQPM42,16,1,Does not do Google plus and most apps...
B00CYQPM42,16,2,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,16,3,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,16,4,All it needs is a suitable app store.
B00CYQPM42,16,5,App store is awful!!!!!!!!!!
B00CYQPM42,16,6,Amazon you need to fix your App store
B00CYQPM42,16,7,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,16,8,Why is there no app for an update for Flash Player?
B00CYQPM42,16,9,No podcast player app.
B00CYQPM42,16,10,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,16,11,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,16,12,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,16,13,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,16,14,With an Android device, you can access the Amazon Android store, but with a Kindle Fire, you cannot access the Google Play store.
B00CYQPM42,16,15,Yes, this is tied to the Amazon App store.
B00CYQPM42,16,16,I can't download any videos as I get an error that it is already downloaded to another one of my devices!!
B00CYQPM42,16,17,By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.
B00CYQPM42,16,18,The child or toddler apps I did download would freeze, not only the app but also the tablet!
B00CYQPM42,16,19,If Amazon would just switch to Google Play for the app store, then there is nothing that would stop them from ruling the world!
B00CYQPM42,16,20,No YouTube app.
B00CYQPM42,16,21,I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.
B00CYQPM42,16,22,Runs on a android system but does not allow google play.
B00CYQPM42,16,23,Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more.
B00CYQPM42,16,24,The responsibility of Downloading and Installing of the Magic 2014 application belongs to the Amazon App Store (after all, it is Amazon App Store people who authorized this to be released in their store).
B00CYQPM42,17,0,My son (8) bought this with his own money.
B00CYQPM42,17,1,I FOUND THAT THE PRICE WAS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,17,2,I wish I never bought it!
B00CYQPM42,17,3,This was my 4th kindle and I will not be wasting my money on one ever again.
B00CYQPM42,17,4,This was a gift not sure I would purchase.
B00CYQPM42,17,5,This is the most expensive waste of money!
B00CYQPM42,17,6,I purchased this as a gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,7,I am really disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,8,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,9,I bought two of these for Christmas, one for me one and one as a gift, at $179.
B00CYQPM42,17,10,Wish I had purchased something else.
B00CYQPM42,17,11,It was a Christmas present.
B00CYQPM42,17,12,So we purchased one for Christmas.
B00CYQPM42,17,13,I know that you get what you pay for, so I guess I should have gotten an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,14,Much better than an Apple I-Pad!
B00CYQPM42,17,15,OfficeSuite is read only, must purchase for $4.99, price is not bad.
B00CYQPM42,17,16,The same thing happened when I bought the Kindle Paperwhite a  year ago.
B00CYQPM42,17,17,I guess I'm going to pay $200 more for and Ipad which I didn't want to do in the first place.
B00CYQPM42,17,18,Do not purchase as a gift or you will have a hard time getting warranty replacement.
B00CYQPM42,17,19,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,20,This is my first time with a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,17,21,Disappointing after owning an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,22,Overal disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,23,Disappointed in this.
B00CYQPM42,17,24,I am just very disappointed in it for what I paid for.
B00CYQPM42,18,0,The battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,18,1,Battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,18,2,Does not hold it's charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,3,Cannot turn it off.
B00CYQPM42,18,4,I don't want to have to turn on Quiet Time all the time just to get this to stop.
B00CYQPM42,18,5,The first one after less than a week woudn't charge.. Sent it back and they sent us a new one.
B00CYQPM42,18,6,One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,7,Low battery life.
B00CYQPM42,18,8,The Kindle recently died, the battery cannot be charged, even when using a different charger.
B00CYQPM42,18,9,Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours.
B00CYQPM42,18,10,I have to hold the power button down for 15 seconds or more for it to shut off.
B00CYQPM42,18,11,There is no time zone for EST.
B00CYQPM42,18,12,Battery life is great so far.-
B00CYQPM42,18,13,If the cord is propped up I can leave it plugged in all night and it won't charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,14,The kindle came to me holding a charge so I could instantaneously turn it on and play with it.
B00CYQPM42,18,15,The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger.
B00CYQPM42,18,16,The battery charger is faulty and the only way I can charge the kindle is to prop up the cord.
B00CYQPM42,18,17,Battery only last for two to three  hours.
B00CYQPM42,18,18,battery doesn't last.
B00CYQPM42,18,19,Every time I turn the tablet on I get  advertising.
B00CYQPM42,18,20,Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%.
B00CYQPM42,18,21,For the same amount of use, I'm used to charging every 2 weeks or so instead of every 3-4 days.-
B00CYQPM42,18,22,(Yes, there are ways to extend battery life, such as turning off wifi when not using it.
B00CYQPM42,18,23,Then I recharged it, and again tested that same 2.5 hour previously downloaded movie -- with wifi turned off, "airplane mode" turned on, and brightness set at about 70%, the battery drained from fully charged to 65%.
B00CYQPM42,18,24,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,19,0,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,19,1,I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones.
B00CYQPM42,19,2,In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough.
B00CYQPM42,19,3,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,19,4,found the speakers to have decent sound.
B00CYQPM42,19,5,If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side.
B00CYQPM42,19,6,I'm not sure how they do it but the sound and volume on this thing is incredible.
B00CYQPM42,19,7,If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder.
B00CYQPM42,19,8,With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste.
B00CYQPM42,19,9,I bought this for my father who has low vision.
B00CYQPM42,19,10,Not for Low Vision.
B00CYQPM42,19,11,It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers.
B00CYQPM42,19,12,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,19,13,Sound, power, silly-pretty display, feel...and did I mention power???
B00CYQPM42,19,14,I am very happy with the resolution and the sound.
B00CYQPM42,19,15,A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find!
B00CYQPM42,19,16,The power button and volume control have been moved.
B00CYQPM42,19,17,The speakers are located in the top, when in landscape mode, which is somewhat different from many other tablets, and adds to the usefulness of the tablet for watching videos.
B00CYQPM42,19,18,Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me.
B00CYQPM42,19,19,IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side.
B00CYQPM42,19,20,Users can get confused with volume buttons on the other side.
B00CYQPM42,19,21,Battery holds up well..speakers could have more volume.
B00CYQPM42,19,22,The sound stage is narrow.
B00CYQPM42,19,23,I keep finding things that  I didn't know were there.
B00CYQPM42,19,24,The price is low, particularly for what you get, and it's a small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet with a stunning display and superb sound.
B00CYQPM42,20,0,that isn't really a camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,1,The HDX has a front facing camera, but lacks a rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,2,It also doesn't have a rear facing camera, it only has a front facing one, like for apps such as Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,3,I don't like just front camera ure feature..rather, I prefer rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,4,The poor quality front facing only camera on it.
B00CYQPM42,20,5,The 7” version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.
B00CYQPM42,20,6,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,7,Also the camera is the worst part, the camera is only on the front of the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,8,#1 the camera on this model is only front facing but it seems that on all of the other HDX models that are larger they have a front AND rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,9,The rear facing camera would make my 32BG purchase choice more useful.
B00CYQPM42,20,10,The Nexus 7 has both a rear and a front camera, while the Fire HDX only has a front camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,11,I bought the unit over the nook because it stated that the unit had a camera, but did not specify that it was only and front facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,12,I ONLY WISH THE CAMERA WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
B00CYQPM42,20,13,don't need a picture of my ugly mug looking at my kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,14,You need a camera for Skype or other video app.-
B00CYQPM42,20,15,If you take the time to put a camera, why not make give it a front and rear with more megapixels to really compete with other tablets?
B00CYQPM42,20,16,The only pictures you can take of are yourself because if you turn it around you can't see what you are taking a picture of.
B00CYQPM42,20,17,she does however have a problem with the camera part, apparently you can only take pictures that are facing the front of the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,18,But - she has a phone and a digital camera for that!
B00CYQPM42,20,19,A camera on the back would be much preferable.
B00CYQPM42,20,20,I had hoped I would be able to use it to take pictures and video as well as use it for video chat.
B00CYQPM42,20,21,I am not sure what use the camera on the front is, unless you like to take selfies holding what amounts to a book in front of you.
B00CYQPM42,20,22,If you want to take pics with your Kindle, get the one with camera on both sides.
B00CYQPM42,20,23,It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,24,I perhaps would have liked the buy the double camera better but I didn't realize the camera only shoots forward at yourself rather than a normal pic (unless I'm missing something).
B00CYQPM42,21,0,Not disappointed one bit as it met all my expectations.
B00CYQPM42,21,1,For the price it has its drawbacks such as often freezing when the battery gets low.
B00CYQPM42,21,2,Compared to a nexus 7 which is the same price, the HDX seems to have a slower processor.
B00CYQPM42,21,3,It comes with a 2.2GHz quad-core processor, which is the standard in the latest tablets.
B00CYQPM42,21,4,Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.
B00CYQPM42,21,5,Great Device, Better than expected.
B00CYQPM42,21,6,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,21,7,All in all it's okay, but I feel I could have done better with my 200 bucks by getting a nexus 7.
B00CYQPM42,21,8,The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory.
B00CYQPM42,21,9,HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor.
B00CYQPM42,21,10,It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.
B00CYQPM42,21,11,The HDX and the iPad Mini both have dual band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi.
B00CYQPM42,21,12,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,21,13,However its overall usefulness overrides this annoying tendency.
B00CYQPM42,21,14,It delivered improved performance as advertised.I gave it to my wife for Christmas.
B00CYQPM42,21,15,The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon.
B00CYQPM42,21,16,Everything works great, but the battery life is not nearly as long as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,21,17,The Nexus is dual band but not dual antenna.
B00CYQPM42,21,18,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,21,19,If you expect to take pictures with your tablet, the HDX isn't for you.Battery Life: HDX = 11 hours (17 hours when reading); Nexus = 9 hours; iPad Mini = 10 hours.
B00CYQPM42,21,20,The battery life is not as good as last year's model.
B00CYQPM42,21,21,The A7 is only a dual-core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks, it definitely holds its own against the quad-core Snapdragon.
B00CYQPM42,21,22,I'm still in that process after two hours of playing around.====================THE
B00CYQPM42,21,23,After all, words or graphic don't appear on the edges of the screen.Battery life - Still needs work onAfter the OS update, there seems to be a slight improvement with the battery life.
B00CYQPM42,21,24,I like how several of the apps respond better on the HDX.
B00CYQPM42,22,0,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,22,1,It is REALLY hard to quit apps.
B00CYQPM42,22,2,Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space.
B00CYQPM42,22,3,The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB.
B00CYQPM42,22,4,16g not enough to download hd movies!
B00CYQPM42,22,5,Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage.
B00CYQPM42,22,6,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,7,Very good device otherwise,but unfortunately they don't tell you that 16 g (really 12gig due to internal system requirements) is not enough to download a movie in hd.
B00CYQPM42,22,8,vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video.
B00CYQPM42,22,9,About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download.
B00CYQPM42,22,10,But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased.
B00CYQPM42,22,11,Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality.
B00CYQPM42,22,12,This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,22,13,Still having a few problems finding things on this one, after I got used to the last model.
B00CYQPM42,22,14,So multiply the hours above by 5 to get an estimate of the maximum number of hours of SD videos you can download.
B00CYQPM42,22,15,Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB
B00CYQPM42,22,16,GB) of storage per hour.
B00CYQPM42,22,17,She recognized right away that there was a problem since there was no video feed.
B00CYQPM42,22,18,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,22,19,64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB.
B00CYQPM42,22,20,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,22,21,The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!
B00CYQPM42,22,22,I also like that there is a "on device" and "cloud" app storage so I can move apps to the Cloud when I don't want them for a time.
B00CYQPM42,22,23,It turns out HD has 3 quality settings and SD has 3 quality settings.
B00CYQPM42,22,24,The fact that the device does not support storage expansion.
B00CYQPM42,23,0,WIFI Connectivity.
B00CYQPM42,23,1,Won't Connect to my Wireless Router.
B00CYQPM42,23,2,My other devices have never had an issue.
B00CYQPM42,23,3,wi-fi drops constantly.
B00CYQPM42,23,4,The wi-fi connection drops constantly for no apparent reason.
B00CYQPM42,23,5,It is hard and slow to connect to WiFI unlike my other Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,6,i got this particular model so i could have internet/ wifi anywhere.
B00CYQPM42,23,7,Next time i will take the ipad.
B00CYQPM42,23,8,Thus, I ran into the very same connectivity issues that I had with my old Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,9,Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems.
B00CYQPM42,23,10,It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day.
B00CYQPM42,23,11,At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem.
B00CYQPM42,23,12,Whenever I would connect to Wifi the Kindle would shut down and reboot.
B00CYQPM42,23,13,Today, I was at Starbucks, where I tried connecting to the internet through their free WIFI service, but failed to connect.
B00CYQPM42,23,14,it constantly loses my wi-fi singnal (at least 2-3 times per day).
B00CYQPM42,23,15,Some days it works fine but once it starts acting up, it will continuously drop connection every 2 - 10 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,23,16,If the connection issues were resolved, I would give this 5 stars.
B00CYQPM42,23,17,I have a slow internet connection, and only one option for a service provider.
B00CYQPM42,23,18,I don't want to have to turn on Quiet Time all the time just to get this to stop.
B00CYQPM42,23,19,I spend a lot of time in places where I cannot get phone or wifi signals.
B00CYQPM42,23,20,I find this rather funny as I mentioned this is a software specific problem with the installation and has nothing to do with my modem or Internet connection.
B00CYQPM42,23,21,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,23,22,It came with instructions as to how to connect to WiFi, so I got that going the first night.
B00CYQPM42,23,23,I continuously have problems with my Kindle not hooking up to my wireless, which in turn makes it a pretty useless device.
B00CYQPM42,23,24,The HDX apparently only works wireless.
B00CYQPM42,24,0,even that would not work.
B00CYQPM42,24,1,Like HDX very much and wish a touch cover like keyboard case to make it more productive.
B00CYQPM42,24,2,The only thing I don't like is the keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,24,3,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,24,4,For example, something like Surface touch cover.
B00CYQPM42,24,5,I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times.
B00CYQPM42,24,6,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,24,7,My only complaint about this product is that it's way too sensitive to touch.
B00CYQPM42,24,8,I miss being able to click on the top of the screen to get to settings.
B00CYQPM42,24,9,I don't want to have to turn on Quiet Time all the time just to get this to stop.
B00CYQPM42,24,10,Got a Poetic magnetic cover and it works great!
B00CYQPM42,24,11,Now I just have to find a pretty case for it!!
B00CYQPM42,24,12,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,24,13,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,14,So far not happy at all with a product that almost cost me $300.00 and has a HORRIBLE VERY OBVIOUS blue/purple line that goes alone the whole screen on both sides.
B00CYQPM42,24,15,I'm not too fond of the cover I ordered because it doesn't hold the stylus - bet that stylus will be lost in a day..lol
B00CYQPM42,24,16,I wish Amazon could come out some keyboard case for HDX.
B00CYQPM42,24,17,You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on.
B00CYQPM42,24,18,It's hard to scroll through screens without opening something about which you have no interest.
B00CYQPM42,24,19,But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,20,Will need to find a way to change the keyboard layout.
B00CYQPM42,24,21,I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).
B00CYQPM42,24,22,The screen is very clear and the options for use are almost endless.
B00CYQPM42,24,23,when it would not work  I tried manually entering data.
B00CYQPM42,24,24,I keep finding things that  I didn't know were there.
B00CYQPM42,25,0,So it would have been obvious to just get the iPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,1,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,25,2,Galaxy tab, Nexus, iPad, iPad mini).
B00CYQPM42,25,3,Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.
B00CYQPM42,25,4,Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One.
B00CYQPM42,25,5,It is so FAST…compared to my android ASUS transformer tablet.
B00CYQPM42,25,6,This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.
B00CYQPM42,25,7,Next time I'm buying an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,8,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,25,9,You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.
B00CYQPM42,25,10,I got this because my Android phone's screen was too small for reading and some gaming and note taking.
B00CYQPM42,25,11,;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.
B00CYQPM42,25,12,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,25,13,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,25,14,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,25,15,Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them.
B00CYQPM42,25,16,I've got better things to do with my time that hack a product right out of the box.
B00CYQPM42,25,17,Kindle Fire- best kept secret for devices.
B00CYQPM42,25,18,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,25,19,Although it should be mentioned that this may be partially be design, since there are many apps that do not work (yet) on this kindle's version of android.
B00CYQPM42,25,20,I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet.
B00CYQPM42,25,21,First things first; the screen!
B00CYQPM42,25,22,I have used, recently, a Nexus 7 (2013) and an iPad Air.
B00CYQPM42,25,23,Cheaper than an ipad mini with a better screen, this device is a no brainer.
B00CYQPM42,25,24,Great tablet, but again the 7" screen doesn't cut it.
B00CYQPM42,26,0,The Lack of even a mini USB port.
B00CYQPM42,26,1,Micro USB Connector - Bite it Apple!
B00CYQPM42,26,2,For the first time ever - a plug adapter is included!
B00CYQPM42,26,3,Only thing that is really lacking is a USB port otherwise it is a great little product.
B00CYQPM42,26,4,Amazon is including a plug adapter so you can actually charge the device through a regular electrical outlet.
B00CYQPM42,26,5,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,26,6,The USB port sticks out at an odd angle, making it difficult to plug in.
B00CYQPM42,26,7,The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3.
B00CYQPM42,26,8,Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away.
B00CYQPM42,26,9,It's just very odd and makes charging annoying.2)
B00CYQPM42,26,10,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,26,11,You have to connect it at an angle on the device (around 30 degrees).
B00CYQPM42,26,12,The product came with the standard usb/wall charger and nothing more, but you don't need anything else.
B00CYQPM42,26,13,My phone did and our laptop did but mind showed me a keyboard and asked for a pin????
B00CYQPM42,26,14,have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle.
B00CYQPM42,26,15,The bottom line is that this is not a repairable device.
B00CYQPM42,26,16,6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit.
B00CYQPM42,26,17,You will not regret it since this device is designed to be taken everywhere.
B00CYQPM42,26,18,I am able to use 3rd-party app stores to upload missing apps and outdated ones on the Amazon App Store, but still!2) USB Connection Port - The connection port on the device can be a bit of a nuisance.
B00CYQPM42,26,19,I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.
B00CYQPM42,26,20,Something to keep in mind if youre shopping around for a tablet.Also I guess the HD models could hook up to a TV with a HDMI cable.
B00CYQPM42,26,21,It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device.
B00CYQPM42,26,22,My rating is not here to convince you one way or the other that the device is or is not worth your $$.
B00CYQPM42,26,23,One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge.
B00CYQPM42,26,24,Bottom line, if you like a tablet you'll likely appreciate this device.
B00CYQPM42,27,0,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,27,1,I bought this for my wife and have had it maybe month and everything stopped working can not even unlock screen when you reset it.
B00CYQPM42,27,2,This is the second one that the freezing happens so I'm not sure if it's something mechanical or what the reason is for it freezing.
B00CYQPM42,27,3,But now, it's been over 2 weeks since they received it and I still don't have a working tablet.
B00CYQPM42,27,4,I would have given it 5 stars but some of the apps will flip upside down when I have the screen locked in one place.
B00CYQPM42,27,5,Some days it works fine but once it starts acting up, it will continuously drop connection every 2 - 10 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,27,6,So, I sent it back and got a replacement from Amazon.And then that replacement's display started flickering randomly.
B00CYQPM42,27,7,I bought the I-Biason case which has held us well despite the multiple drops already.
B00CYQPM42,27,8,After 6 months it died.
B00CYQPM42,27,9,My worked great from the start and I loved that I was able to receive the day before I went out of the country.
B00CYQPM42,27,10,They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.
B00CYQPM42,27,11,I have used it everyday for last three weeks.
B00CYQPM42,27,12,The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!
B00CYQPM42,27,13,I have to hold the power button down for 15 seconds or more for it to shut off.
B00CYQPM42,27,14,It's a Christmas present and I wanted it ready for her as soon as she opened it for Christmas.
B00CYQPM42,27,15,I even showed my grown daughter the "offending" screen (saying nothing of the complaints) asking her if she saw anything, anything at all unusual or bothersome about the reading screen.
B00CYQPM42,27,16,Other than that, I LOVE IT!
B00CYQPM42,27,17,only two things i dislike: The Boot up time after you turn it off is slow, and the fact that i can't use Google Play.
B00CYQPM42,27,18,Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,27,19,The only thing I didn't like was that it took several weeks to arrive.
B00CYQPM42,27,20,Works perfect, the kids love them!
B00CYQPM42,27,21,Easy to install and use and and any problems May day is there at your fingertips.
B00CYQPM42,27,22,One in three times it will work.
B00CYQPM42,27,23,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,27,24,I bought one for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.
B00CYQPM42,28,0,I have contacted support about these problems.
B00CYQPM42,28,1,I am going to contact support again to see if they can help.
B00CYQPM42,28,2,I called customer service AGAIN and asked if I was eligible for a refund and they told me that because this was a replacement device I could not have a refund.
B00CYQPM42,28,3,I want to return it.
B00CYQPM42,28,4,poor support.
B00CYQPM42,28,5,When I called customer service they were great (the reason that this go any stars) I received a replacement and I am having the same issues.
B00CYQPM42,28,6,The device is 5 months old...After contacting Amazon Kindle support a fourth time, someone finally helped me.
B00CYQPM42,28,7,Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept.
B00CYQPM42,28,8,I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support.
B00CYQPM42,28,9,Very happy customer.
B00CYQPM42,28,10,It took a few days for a very supportive customer service chap from Ireland to sort out the problem.
B00CYQPM42,28,11,Therefore, I am no longer receiving any more emails about this issue which means the problems are not fixed and now I don't know what to do about it.
B00CYQPM42,28,12,If I had to do it again, I would not buy it and I want to send it back
B00CYQPM42,28,13,i contacted customer service and it took them a week to send a canned email with instructions on how to load an email.
B00CYQPM42,28,14,Its a poorly developed product with poor customer service.
B00CYQPM42,28,15,I explained this to the tech advisors and they told me to send it back.
B00CYQPM42,28,16,He sent a few emails telling me he was working on the problem and the last email I received stated his superiors said I should update my kindle with the new update because it would fix my problems..
B00CYQPM42,28,17,So far I've had no problems with my Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,28,18,I called customer care, they helped me quickly reset the device to factory settings and it seemed to have fixed it.
B00CYQPM42,28,19,So after contacting Amazon three times for this issue to get a replacement Kindle, I am still stuck with an unusable Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,28,20,I gave it one star because of the charging problems that Amazon wouldn't fix.
B00CYQPM42,28,21,Even if I had to go that way, it's still great service that I could return the device this long after the purchase, for any reason.If
B00CYQPM42,28,22,I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call.
B00CYQPM42,28,23,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,28,24,I gave it to my niece who is 10, so of course she does not have an Amazon account and cannot call to get the Kindle replaced.
B00CYQPM42,29,0,It still has a lot of kinks to be worked out.
B00CYQPM42,29,1,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,29,2,There is no time zone for EST.
B00CYQPM42,29,3,Just hanged up with the CS and they assure that is a software feature, and that can be fixed with a software update.
B00CYQPM42,29,4,This is my first time with a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,29,5,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,29,6,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,29,7,The device shuts down and restarts while reading.
B00CYQPM42,29,8,I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently.
B00CYQPM42,29,9,Lots of freezing and unexpected hangs.
B00CYQPM42,29,10,Having a lot of issues with this!!!
B00CYQPM42,29,11,The browser often hangs for no reason, even when my broadband is working fine.More rrestarting.
B00CYQPM42,29,12,Otherwise it's a great little machine!
B00CYQPM42,29,13,I have also run into situations where I've had to reinstall apps for them to work properly again.
B00CYQPM42,29,14,I would give this a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the problems I have had with getting Skype to work.
B00CYQPM42,29,15,The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!
B00CYQPM42,29,16,Great, but needs a couple small tweeks.
B00CYQPM42,29,17,Difficult to read on a sunny beach but great everywhere else.
B00CYQPM42,29,18,There is supposed to be a fix being worked on here in the near future and released for wide distribution.
B00CYQPM42,29,19,In the mean time I guess I will just keep to skyping on the PC.
B00CYQPM42,29,20,had hard time setting up skype.
B00CYQPM42,29,21,She had me "update" the system.
B00CYQPM42,29,22,She couldn't comprehend that I could not complete her troubleshooting checklist because the device was not working!
B00CYQPM42,29,23,I use it a lot more than I use my desktop now.
B00CYQPM42,29,24,Shuts down while reading.
B007P4YAPK,0,0,Back when I had the Kindle Fire, I'd have the brightness all the way down and it would STILL be too bright.-
B007P4YAPK,0,1,i also love that i can alter the size of the font and the color background of my pages.
B007P4YAPK,0,2,Otherwise I love it
B007P4YAPK,0,3,I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire.
B007P4YAPK,0,4,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,0,5,Love the crisp display and the vibrant colors.
B007P4YAPK,0,6,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,0,7,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,0,8,Once again... yes the screen on this tablet is great, but yes there is a VISIBLE improvement on the New iPad.
B007P4YAPK,0,9,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,0,10,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,0,11,Not noticeable when it's on, but unmistakable when the screen is dark.Otherwise, it's beautiful, light, functional and zippy.
B007P4YAPK,0,12,i had balked at getting a tablet for a very long time as i love the feeling of having a real book, so the size matters to me.
B007P4YAPK,0,13,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,0,14,I love it, but there is room for improvement.
B007P4YAPK,0,15,The blue color is a really nice dark blue, you won't be disappointed, many features and very good speed.
B007P4YAPK,0,16,My sister has the New iPad and yes I can tell the difference in the screen.
B007P4YAPK,0,17,The next best was the "blue" so I ordered it.
B007P4YAPK,0,18,Considering the mediocre resolution (1280X800) the screen was actually bright and decent, although it took a little while for me to get used to it, considering it replaced my retina iPad.
B007P4YAPK,0,19,I've encountered exactly the same thing on my wife's iPad 3 too many times to count.The screen is very good and in fact better than it needs to be in order to be both functional and pleasurable to use.
B007P4YAPK,0,20,The resolution is beautiful and the brightness is remarkable.
B007P4YAPK,0,21,I've purchased five iPads over the years, starting with the very first generation and none had screen issues; neither did my Samsung Galaxy Tab.
B007P4YAPK,0,22,the size was a major factor for me - i wanted something that would rival the size of a "real" book and this is perfect.
B007P4YAPK,0,23,But about a month ago, I noticed small little blotches in my screen that are white to greyish in color, but are only visible when the screen is displaying deep blacks.
B007P4YAPK,0,24,At first I was thinking I wouldn't be able to tell the difference... but I was wrong.This does not make me want to get the New iPad however, because I don't like the "Apple" way of doing things.
B007P4YAPK,1,0,Another problem is app to app integration.
B007P4YAPK,1,1,Netflix and the music players work well, but what I really use it is for the following:1.
B007P4YAPK,1,2,The apps loads fast.
B007P4YAPK,1,3,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,1,4,Google apps works well, and it is easy with the keyboard to deal with email.8.
B007P4YAPK,1,5,If you have an android phone, this is the way to go - all my phone apps were added automatically to tablet.4.
B007P4YAPK,1,6,I use it to read books, watch movies, listen to music, catch up on the news, play educational games, etc....
B007P4YAPK,1,7,it won`t download Adobe media player and some things need that to play on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,8,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,1,9,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,10,I was used to my husband's iPad but once I set up my home screen and downloaded some apps, I was good to go.
B007P4YAPK,1,11,And I've had no problem finding apps on Google Play to fill all of my needs.
B007P4YAPK,1,12,I went straight for swiftkey3 and works great with the TF300T.Native browser works great.Very little bloatware, thank you ASUS.If your looking for your first tablet you should know: Apps in the android line are NOT up to par with Apple apps, simple truth.
B007P4YAPK,1,13,It happened when the wife or kids were playing Mahjong, Smarf or fish tank games.
B007P4YAPK,1,14,The only other small problem I've had is when maximizing Youtube videos to full-screen - sometimes it doesn't play correctly, (EDIT 070612 -- the Youtube App automatically updated recently and I no longer sometimes have a problem with maximizing video - it works perfectly now every time.)I've
B007P4YAPK,1,15,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,1,16,The only thing that I was disappointed about was the inability to stream videos except youtube.
B007P4YAPK,1,17,Seems it may work a little too well.
B007P4YAPK,1,18,HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.
B007P4YAPK,1,19,While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps.
B007P4YAPK,1,20,But it works great with netflix, crunchyroll, xfinity, brighthousetv etc. so its nice for watching stuff while working out.
B007P4YAPK,1,21,The camera takes clear pictures and you are able to play video games that has lots of speed and motion.
B007P4YAPK,1,22,So easy to set up and all the apps on my droid phone downloaded to my tablet after logging into my gmail account which was so cool.
B007P4YAPK,1,23,It does a great job at everything it does - the only time I ever see lag is multitasking between applications which heavily use the internet - such as a p2p application and netflix at the same time... doesn't work well.
B007P4YAPK,1,24,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,0,Great tablet for the price.
B007P4YAPK,2,1,Good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,2,If you're looking for something comprehensive like the iPad I would recommend this.
B007P4YAPK,2,3,Good Product.
B007P4YAPK,2,4,Great! Great product.
B007P4YAPK,2,5,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,2,6,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,2,7,This is a good tablet for the price I paid for it.
B007P4YAPK,2,8,Worth buying.
B007P4YAPK,2,9,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,2,10,Good .
B007P4YAPK,2,11,Good price.
B007P4YAPK,2,12,This lesser quality comes with a lesser price tag so it all works out.
B007P4YAPK,2,13,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,14,Overall, I love this product.
B007P4YAPK,2,15,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,16,I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B007P4YAPK,2,17,I would recommend this to anyone who wants a pretty high spec tablet but without the high end price.
B007P4YAPK,2,18,I would highly recommend not buying an Asus product.
B007P4YAPK,2,19,The price was good at the time but now it is even better of course.
B007P4YAPK,2,20,My friend recommended it and I went along with the recommendation.
B007P4YAPK,2,21,Bought this for the wife and she really likes it.
B007P4YAPK,2,22,Love the ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,2,23,Very good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,24,Purchased in April 2012.
B007P4YAPK,3,0,The battery lasts about 7 hours.
B007P4YAPK,3,1,Great battery life also
B007P4YAPK,3,2,Great battery life too.
B007P4YAPK,3,3,Very good battery life; especially using the dock.5.
B007P4YAPK,3,4,Battery life is around 7 hours for almost constant use.
B007P4YAPK,3,5,See how long the battery lasts.
B007P4YAPK,3,6,nice for it's time.
B007P4YAPK,3,7,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B007P4YAPK,3,8,It does seem to charge fast though and hold a charge very well while the display is off.
B007P4YAPK,3,9,But like I said before, that is not needed because the battery is amply sufficient.
B007P4YAPK,3,10,It is a good qualify tablet.
B007P4YAPK,3,11,Good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,3,12,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,3,13,Color reproduction is excellent though.Battery life has generally been very good for me though it will not hold up great under gaming.
B007P4YAPK,3,14,Good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,3,15,Battery lasts a pretty long time, especially when fitted with keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,3,16,Had it for 3 days and could not charge it.
B007P4YAPK,3,17,Battery life is above average, usually lasting a day and a half with moderate use.
B007P4YAPK,3,18,Charging is relatively fast.
B007P4YAPK,3,19,The unit seemed very nice with a lot of good features until 3 days went by and it would not take a charge.
B007P4YAPK,3,20,The battery life is very impressive also.My only gripe with this is the screen.
B007P4YAPK,3,21,toshiba tablets have swappable batteries thereby doubling there usage time with one xtra battery.
B007P4YAPK,3,22,The SL101 screen has a more heavy-duty feel, but doesn't have a second battery.
B007P4YAPK,3,23,Battery life is still around 10 hours tablet and 15 hours with keyboard attached (battery in each) running 740p HD movies with wifi and blue tooth off.
B007P4YAPK,3,24,The TF300 is much lighter than my laptop, and has similar battery life.
B007P4YAPK,4,0,The build quality was much better, everything aligned and in place.
B007P4YAPK,4,1,The product build quality is not good as well.
B007P4YAPK,4,2,I like the build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,3,Good enough but could be better!
B007P4YAPK,4,4,Good Product.
B007P4YAPK,4,5,The design and build are both very good.
B007P4YAPK,4,6,Good tablet with sound issue.
B007P4YAPK,4,7,It feels good, is easy to hold, and the screen is very nice, if not as bright as the Prime.
B007P4YAPK,4,8,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,4,9,Apart from needing more sound from the speakers, its a very good product.
B007P4YAPK,4,10,Decent product performance, shoddy build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,11,Screen seems pretty robust.
B007P4YAPK,4,12,All in all, I THOUGHT this was going to be a solid product but in the end, the price of the tablet ended up being too good to be true because of the build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,13,The display was crisp and the sound was surprisingly loud with only 1 speaker.
B007P4YAPK,4,14,The design is nice and it feels pretty sturdy.
B007P4YAPK,4,15,The design is also great.
B007P4YAPK,4,16,I am impressed with the look, feel and 'heft' of the tablet - good quality of fit and finish.
B007P4YAPK,4,17,The Tablet itself is of poor quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,18,Decent sound.8.
B007P4YAPK,4,19,Poor quality product.
B007P4YAPK,4,20,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,4,21,Very thin, and has a good grip feeling thanks to the textured back.
B007P4YAPK,4,22,A surprisingly good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,4,23,I do belive that this is a good tablet, I just think that I got one that is not built quite right.
B007P4YAPK,4,24,Sound isn't the best (only one speaker), but it does get surprisingly loud for a little thing.Overall, so far I like the TF300 a LOT.
B007P4YAPK,5,0,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,1,tablet is good.
B007P4YAPK,5,2,camera is really sluggish but the quality is good in good light.
B007P4YAPK,5,3,I usually have the screen at 80-100%- I really like that the screen can actually get pretty dark.
B007P4YAPK,5,4,this tablet is great.
B007P4YAPK,5,5,The camera takes clear pictures and you are able to play video games that has lots of speed and motion.
B007P4YAPK,5,6,What a great tablet for the $$$ Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,7,I can't say how much I love this tablet it's fast quality device with one exception in that Skype video is the very bad!This is a software problem and so I am hopefull that it will be fixed.
B007P4YAPK,5,8,great but a some things wrong.
B007P4YAPK,5,9,There is something about the camera in the TF201 with indoor light.
B007P4YAPK,5,10,Best tablet with one exception - SKYPE.
B007P4YAPK,5,11,Otherwise I love it
B007P4YAPK,5,12,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,13,it takes excellent pictures: beach wise, whc is very sunny or even in dark places like a church and sunset pix are pretty good,even the rainbow and the clouds  look amazing; i have no problems w/ all my Kindle books....i just love it
B007P4YAPK,5,14,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,5,15,Nice tablet, though
B007P4YAPK,5,16,i love it.
B007P4YAPK,5,17,The pics are clear, games are clear and respond well to touch.
B007P4YAPK,5,18,The size is perfect and it is easy to use and fast.
B007P4YAPK,5,19,But all and all I like it its a good price.
B007P4YAPK,5,20,Some quick touch ups in an app, and the photo was pretty acceptable.-
B007P4YAPK,5,21,It's great for using in the dark.
B007P4YAPK,5,22,The front facing camera is clearly designed to be used in landscape mode.
B007P4YAPK,5,23,And the video quality is also below average especially when you move around when shooting.It comes out blurry unless you move really, really slow.But overall this still is a powerful and smooth tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,24,Very good if you get good one.
B007P4YAPK,6,0,It fast, good for gamings and browsing.
B007P4YAPK,6,1,It's fast, smooth and very responsive, to my touch.
B007P4YAPK,6,2,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,6,3,It out performs most everything out there, has great graphics, and is well made.
B007P4YAPK,6,4,It has a quad core and 32Gig of storage.
B007P4YAPK,6,5,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,6,6,Snappy responses and Tegra 3 video a plus.
B007P4YAPK,6,7,Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,8,good product.
B007P4YAPK,6,9,It has all of the speed that I need.
B007P4YAPK,6,10,The TF300 actually makes a pretty good little word processor.
B007P4YAPK,6,11,Tegra 3 is a beast when it comes to games.
B007P4YAPK,6,12,If anyone can actually tell the difference in speed, they are pretty good, because it is only 0.1MHz difference.
B007P4YAPK,6,13,The browser speed seemed a little slow and the touch screen response is sometimes delayed but I love it so far.
B007P4YAPK,6,14,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,6,15,HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.
B007P4YAPK,6,16,The screen is beautiful and I love the expandable memory capability.
B007P4YAPK,6,17,watsapp is not compatable with this tab :(... Overall its a good tab whithdecent performance and bright ui
B007P4YAPK,6,18,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,6,19,The Tegra 3 processor is also very zippy - the only slowdowns I have had with the tablet have been internet connection speed related.
B007P4YAPK,6,20,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,6,21,Decent product performance, shoddy build quality.
B007P4YAPK,6,22,What a great tablet for the $$$ Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,23,Good tablet for the time.
B007P4YAPK,6,24,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,7,0,I added a 32 Gig micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,7,1,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,7,2,I also love the fact that I can add memory to it although I still have a lot of memory left on the pre-installed memory card.
B007P4YAPK,7,3,RAM is expandable via a microSD card which is also a big plus.
B007P4YAPK,7,4,I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts.
B007P4YAPK,7,5,Very nice for the price.
B007P4YAPK,7,6,Secondly the keyboard has an sd slot which lets you add an additional 32 gb of memory thereby making it a 96 gb tablet beating out both the ipad and the toshibas.
B007P4YAPK,7,7,The included SD slot makes it very expandable and is something that Nexus devices will never have.
B007P4YAPK,7,8,Not the best, but fast enough to be relevant in 2014 and with a decent display and great expandability.
B007P4YAPK,7,9,The best processor, decent memory, expandability, and at a price point that doesn't make my checkbook cry.Update for the new (4.3)
B007P4YAPK,7,10,The memory is 32gb, which is more then enough for most people.
B007P4YAPK,7,11,The prime does come in a 64 gig model but, i find that a 32 works just fine for me especially if you dont mind taking the time to swap out micro sd cards thus making the memory a moot point and i didnt feel like waiting on the toshiba(i like instant gratification).
B007P4YAPK,7,12,A 32gb tablet and 10 inch screen for the price is hard to beat.
B007P4YAPK,7,13,The expandable memory on the ASUS is also very convenient.
B007P4YAPK,7,14,good product, but this model does not have sim card slot... builtin appliction for microsoft word editing is not impressive.
B007P4YAPK,7,15,I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable!
B007P4YAPK,7,16,The screen is beautiful and I love the expandable memory capability.
B007P4YAPK,7,17,It feels good, is easy to hold, and the screen is very nice, if not as bright as the Prime.
B007P4YAPK,7,18,The touch screen works great for the access.I had looked at tablets last year and tried a 7 inch one.
B007P4YAPK,7,19,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,7,20,Because you cant beat the price of 96GB pad (32 miniSD + 32gb SD in the Dock + 32 gb internal pad = 96GB), and the Ice Scream Sandwhich OS, and the "Netbook-Like" functionality, I have to give this atleast 4+ stars.Buy this, you will love it.
B007P4YAPK,7,21,Still has full size  SDHC card slot on keyboard (yeah) and a Micro SDHC slot on the tablet  (big time yeah).
B007P4YAPK,7,22,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,7,23,good product.
B007P4YAPK,7,24,Good but...
B007P4YAPK,8,0,Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,8,1,But it works great with netflix, crunchyroll, xfinity, brighthousetv etc. so its nice for watching stuff while working out.
B007P4YAPK,8,2,Very good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,8,3,It is easy to learn, but there are problems.
B007P4YAPK,8,4,I like how easy it is to use.I use it more then my laptop.
B007P4YAPK,8,5,I wished that it worked better with all the Facebook games!
B007P4YAPK,8,6,Great Tablet, Iffy browser.
B007P4YAPK,8,7,Great tablet  - but has problems.
B007P4YAPK,8,8,Both Wifi and GPS work great.
B007P4YAPK,8,9,I bought this as a substitute for a laptop.Overall the performance was very good .But I really wanted one with cellphone connectivity which this model doesn't have.Wi-Fi  worked well but I am not always in range of  a hotspot.Passed it to a young person who is thrilled to have it!!!.
B007P4YAPK,8,10,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,8,11,This tablet is my first foray into mobile devices smaller than a laptop computer.
B007P4YAPK,8,12,I can do just about all things I usually do on my computer but most important of all I can travel anywhere and have access to most of the apps that I used.
B007P4YAPK,8,13,it's faster then my laptop.
B007P4YAPK,8,14,When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.
B007P4YAPK,8,15,Ours works very well and we enjoy it.
B007P4YAPK,8,16,The wifi works very well, a little better than my laptop (my laptop is a few years old) in fact.
B007P4YAPK,8,17,Netflix and the music players work well, but what I really use it is for the following:1.
B007P4YAPK,8,18,I have to do work on a linux server - very easy to ssh to servers at work, and run serious programs there.
B007P4YAPK,8,19,Really love it for this, so I can take it anywhere, and connect to the internet.
B007P4YAPK,8,20,Wi-Fi has been great and it tethers absolutely great from my phone when I am not in Wi-Fi reach.
B007P4YAPK,8,21,I like the size and use it instead of my laptop.
B007P4YAPK,8,22,It just isn't working for my intended use - to read articles, browse and shop.
B007P4YAPK,8,23,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,8,24,I have to learn how to download some of the things that make it work.It charges fast and I love the portability of it.
B007P4YAPK,9,0,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,9,1,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,9,2,Now, the SL101's keyboard is OK.
B007P4YAPK,9,3,It does better with touch.
B007P4YAPK,9,4,Also, when you have the screen at the best angle it can get (pretty much all the way back), when you touch the screen it has a tendency to tilt back because of the very fine balance the keyboard and the screen have.
B007P4YAPK,9,5,It always feels like I am trying to contort my hand to touch it, reaching over the keyboard, especially when it comes to touching the lower part of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,6,Google apps works well, and it is easy with the keyboard to deal with email.8.
B007P4YAPK,9,7,Touching the screen tips the balance.
B007P4YAPK,9,8,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,9,I love the keyboard dock.
B007P4YAPK,9,10,Coupled with the keyboard dock it makes a pretty good laptop replacement.
B007P4YAPK,9,11,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,9,12,Great little touch pad.
B007P4YAPK,9,13,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,9,14,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,9,15,It holds up well against any other tablet I've worked with and better than some.
B007P4YAPK,9,16,When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.
B007P4YAPK,9,17,It feels very natural to reach from the keyboard to touching the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,18,Also, the on screen ASUS keyboard is very glitchy.
B007P4YAPK,9,19,Love the keyboard, and all the functions that go with it.
B007P4YAPK,9,20,The best part is that I can take notes with the dock while I'm at school, then review those notes on the train with just the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,9,21,Great for reading without the keyboard, and perfect for email and editing with the keyboard.Highly recommended.
B007P4YAPK,9,22,The keyboard also adds quite a few other features which i find i like.
B007P4YAPK,9,23,The angle and position is perfect for promoting the use of your finger to touch the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,24,Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.
B007P4YAPK,10,0,What a great tablet for the $$$ Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,1,Nice tablet, though
B007P4YAPK,10,2,Great! Great product.
B007P4YAPK,10,3,Great.
B007P4YAPK,10,4,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,10,5,Great Right?
B007P4YAPK,10,6,Everything was great, but....
B007P4YAPK,10,7,Nice.
B007P4YAPK,10,8,Nice tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,9,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,10,Great tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,11,Great Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,12,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,10,13,nice tablet! the tablet is nice, it works fine, it is fast and versatile.the
B007P4YAPK,10,14,The size is perfect and it is easy to use and fast.
B007P4YAPK,10,15,Nice 10" Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,16,Great product.
B007P4YAPK,10,17,I love my tablet, once I got one that worked.
B007P4YAPK,10,18,Everything is good --- when it is working.I have been using the tablet for less than a month.
B007P4YAPK,10,19,Nice.
B007P4YAPK,10,20,This is a great tablet!
B007P4YAPK,10,21,this new tablet i got its working just fine with no issues.
B007P4YAPK,10,22,It is a good qualify tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,23,Good tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,24,Very easy to use, lightweight, and perfectly customizable.
B007P4YAPK,11,0,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,11,1,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,11,2,I would have liked to be able to use the keyboard from a distance, without it being connected to the tablet, which would have been nice considering the HDMI port.
B007P4YAPK,11,3,Came with keyboard that includes extra battery.
B007P4YAPK,11,4,Not necessary if you get the keyboard, however, as the keyboard has a full sized usb port built in.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Just found out that standard USB chargers (of any amperage) do not charge this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,11,5,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,11,6,Now, the SL101's keyboard is OK.
B007P4YAPK,11,7,I never tried to see if the old keyboard would work on the new one...the new one is a bit different...has one USB port instead of two (negative).
B007P4YAPK,11,8,HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6.
B007P4YAPK,11,9,Although I didn't buy it, I like the docking keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,11,10,Still has full size  SDHC card slot on keyboard (yeah) and a Micro SDHC slot on the tablet  (big time yeah).
B007P4YAPK,11,11,The SL101 has a keyboard built into it and is marginally lighter than the TF300 with the keyboard attached.
B007P4YAPK,11,12,Having said that, I added a Poetic Hardback case which added a lot of stiffness/rigidity to the tablet.I'm very happy with the TF300, screen quality is good, has hdmi out, expandable storage via micro sd card slot, and you can add a USB adapter (which I bought) for external storage.
B007P4YAPK,11,13,I still prefer to be able to have additional power instead, but it would have been a nice feature to have bluetooth on the keyboard too.
B007P4YAPK,11,14,I purchased the keyboard dock and a bluetooth mouse to accompany the TF300.
B007P4YAPK,11,15,With the optional keyboard dock, expansion and battery life are increased dramatically even further.
B007P4YAPK,11,16,We bought the keyboard to get the extra battery life, and it is good for that, but the keyboard itself does not work well unless it is on a perfectly flat, stable surface.
B007P4YAPK,11,17,The included SD slot makes it very expandable and is something that Nexus devices will never have.
B007P4YAPK,11,18,The USB connection to my PC allows me to read this tablet like a hard drive.
B007P4YAPK,11,19,The screen could be better but its more than adequate, plenty of memory for the price with room to grow like a Micro SD slot and with the optional keyboard dock you get a full size SD slot plus you get a full size USB port for attaching external storage devices if you really are one of those that carries movie and music collections around.There's many positive things about this tablet but the one that impresses me the most is "optional" keyboard dock that turns this thing into a mini 10" notebook with a very usable keyboard and it closes and opens just like a notebook and it adds 5 extra hours of battery life.
B007P4YAPK,11,20,The dock was a nice option.
B007P4YAPK,11,21,The TF300 when detached from the keyboard is very light.
B007P4YAPK,11,22,The only tiny drawback is that it doesn't have a mini USB port, and the screen is not as sharp as the Dell XPS tablet that I own.
B007P4YAPK,11,23,My friend prefers a standard mouse and can use his USB mouse no problem.
B007P4YAPK,11,24,I added a 32 Gig micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,12,0,This is a really nice tablet with the up to date Android operating system and is easy to navigate.
B007P4YAPK,12,1,Also you can now upgrade Android to Jelly Bean.
B007P4YAPK,12,2,Great Android ICS Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,12,3,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,12,4,You get a fast system, nice screen, the Ice Cream Sandwich with it.
B007P4YAPK,12,5,The device shipped with Jelly Bean rather than Ice Cream Sandwich.
B007P4YAPK,12,6,Great, but... Asus TF300 is a great product, works perfect.
B007P4YAPK,12,7,Seems it may work a little too well.
B007P4YAPK,12,8,Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) is excellent.
B007P4YAPK,12,9,I would have liked to root the tablet, but a root exploit is only available for ICS on this device.
B007P4YAPK,12,10,Interfaces just like my android phone.
B007P4YAPK,12,11,Shipped with Jelly Bean.
B007P4YAPK,12,12,My phone is an android so I understood the basics of how to operate.
B007P4YAPK,12,13,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,12,14,Great Right?
B007P4YAPK,12,15,Everything was great, but....
B007P4YAPK,12,16,The only bad thing is android does not support flash anymore, other than that (which is not the product itself) it is perfect!
B007P4YAPK,12,17,I had to go on line and find out how to operate it for the most part.
B007P4YAPK,12,18,I would recommend the tablet, just updated to Jelly Bean but ICS was fine.
B007P4YAPK,12,19,Am just getting into the modern world and this is something I have to learn.. perhaps the things I dislike are fixable when I find out how to do it.
B007P4YAPK,12,20,Just got it last week - love it!
B007P4YAPK,12,21,Many of the features are linked in to the operating system, Android 4.0 or "ice cream sandwich" ICS, and is finally up to par with Apple OS.
B007P4YAPK,12,22,And I love it even more.
B007P4YAPK,12,23,However, one of the main reasons I got this tablet was its upgrade to the Ice Cream Sandwich OS, and with the exception of the ability to make folders and thereby only needing one screen for all of my apps (I always have many more than I need), I'm NOT impressed with that new operating system.
B007P4YAPK,12,24,It works extremely well....  Until you shave.
B007P4YAPK,13,0,overall i am happy with my purchase, and with the costumer service from amazon.
B007P4YAPK,13,1,A++++++ for amazon customer service!!
B007P4YAPK,13,2,I waitied until the end of the day, and called Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,13,3,I just want to commend Amazon on their amazing customer service.
B007P4YAPK,13,4,The tablet is great and the service was great.
B007P4YAPK,13,5,Full Disclosure: I did not buy this product from Amazon, but from Staples.
B007P4YAPK,13,6,6 weeks later, the product was returned and it works for 1 month.
B007P4YAPK,13,7,Do Not Buy Anything From This Company.
B007P4YAPK,13,8,So we came back to Amazon to get a replacement and were told that they would not replace the item.
B007P4YAPK,13,9,This has been classified as CID (Customer Induced Damage) and is excluded from warranty coverage.
B007P4YAPK,13,10,They have no incentive to provide any actual customer service.
B007P4YAPK,13,11,To add insult to injury, when we called Asus service they strongly encouraged us to return the unit to Amazon for replacement.
B007P4YAPK,13,12,I have successfully used Amazon for years, so I was very disappointed in the way Amazon handled my order for the Asus 201.
B007P4YAPK,13,13,so I called ASUS support by phone.
B007P4YAPK,13,14,first one i got from amazon was defective, but i called amazon and they sent me a new one real fast with no hold ups.
B007P4YAPK,13,15,She called me back the next afternoon to see if I had received it yet.
B007P4YAPK,13,16,No warranty or support.
B007P4YAPK,13,17,I love my tablet, once I got one that worked.
B007P4YAPK,13,18,I purchased this on the reviews on Amazon and from Cnet, and other sites that I have visited.
B007P4YAPK,13,19,I can't return it to Staples.
B007P4YAPK,13,20,I'll give the tablet another chance and it's been shipped back to Amazon for a replacement.UPDATE: First of all the Amazon replacement program is AMAZING.
B007P4YAPK,13,21,Poor quality product.
B007P4YAPK,13,22,Continued contact with their customer service indicates that they WILL NOT EVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES REPLACE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.
B007P4YAPK,13,23,There was a time when all ASUS computers were made in Taiwan...
B007P4YAPK,13,24,SO I contacted ASUS Support and got it repaired, but the the problems were not completely fixed.
B007P4YAPK,14,0,Might not have noticed but I also have access to Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 devices.
B007P4YAPK,14,1,This product may be right for someone, but not me since the Android phone I currently have has the same features as this and I really do not need two devices so similar.
B007P4YAPK,14,2,Think I'll wait for the iPad 3. Nice try ASUS, but you've have GOT to perfect this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,14,3,As much as I prefer Android, this experience has made me lean towards an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,14,4,This is the best tablet hands down.
B007P4YAPK,14,5,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,14,6,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,14,7,It poops on the ipad.
B007P4YAPK,14,8,Ultimately, the mouse on Android is not that great of an add-on.
B007P4YAPK,14,9,It mostly worked, but not always, and not as fast as I'd have preferred, and it took a lot of tweaking.
B007P4YAPK,14,10,And I love it even more.
B007P4YAPK,14,11,Give me the simplicity and functionality of an Android device like this any day.
B007P4YAPK,14,12,Compared to the ACER, this is much quicker and snappier.Owning a Xoom and Galaxy Tab 10.1, the Asus feels flimsy, you can twist the body on this thing quite easily.
B007P4YAPK,14,13,Best tablet.
B007P4YAPK,14,14,I don't want a $600 device.
B007P4YAPK,14,15,Love it!
B007P4YAPK,14,16,While it is not a perfect laptop replacement (scrolling using the mouse or mousepad in particular takes a bit of getting used to and is subpar compared to a laptop), using the keyboard and mouse with the pre-installed office suite is simple, easy, and impressively powerful too.
B007P4YAPK,14,17,My 2 year old Samsung Galaxy S I now feels like a Ferrari compared to this product.
B007P4YAPK,14,18,nice tablet! the tablet is nice, it works fine, it is fast and versatile.the
B007P4YAPK,14,19,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,14,20,Just got it last week - love it!
B007P4YAPK,14,21,It does better with touch.
B007P4YAPK,14,22,I guess it didn't sell that well, but all thing being equal between devices, I'd prefer it.
B007P4YAPK,14,23,I personally think that it is unfortunate ASUS seems to be dropping the SL101 form-factor.
B007P4YAPK,14,24,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,15,0,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,15,1,When my screen is black, I notice some light bleed in a few of the corners, but it's nothing major and becomes unnoticeable when the screen is displaying colors other than black.
B007P4YAPK,15,2,There was also some light bleed on the edges of the screen, noticeable only when viewing dark images/video.
B007P4YAPK,15,3,The screen resolution is very crisp indoors.
B007P4YAPK,15,4,drops, excessive pressure, something being dropped on to the screen, misuse, etc.).
B007P4YAPK,15,5,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B007P4YAPK,15,6,Where ever I was, when set on auto, the tablet screen always adjusted to the most dim.
B007P4YAPK,15,7,But about a month ago, I noticed small little blotches in my screen that are white to greyish in color, but are only visible when the screen is displaying deep blacks.
B007P4YAPK,15,8,I haven't had any problems with it.
B007P4YAPK,15,9,The screen was okay other than some backlight bleeding along the edges.
B007P4YAPK,15,10,I would have been fine if the color was washed out like the bottom or bright white like the top, but the gradient just annoyed me.
B007P4YAPK,15,11,They were about the size of a pea and appeared in two different areas of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,12,This is actually my second TF300 that has had issues with the display as the first tablet I bought had really bad problems with what looks like bad contrasts that caused my screen to make very distinct graduations between colors when they were gradually going from a black to white like a fading sensation.
B007P4YAPK,15,13,They were noticeably brighter than the rest of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,14,The only con: can't really use it in very bright sunlight.
B007P4YAPK,15,15,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,15,16,For normal use this is fine because the screen flips automatically but some programs, mainly games, insist on displaying in only in native orientation.The screen is more than bright enough for indoor use but not enough for daylight outdoors.
B007P4YAPK,15,17,It took me a while to adjust to the lower resolution and more subdued colors.
B007P4YAPK,15,18,I got it from a shop, Worked well, but noticed a dead pixel on the first one.
B007P4YAPK,15,19,There is nothing wrong with the TF300 screen, but side-by-side, the SL101 seems more vibrant and has better darkness (contrast).
B007P4YAPK,15,20,The huge bleeding on one side of the screen became a non issue at this point.
B007P4YAPK,15,21,That being said, the Pad's screen is a bit underwhelming.
B007P4YAPK,15,22,I have poor eyesight, but I can clearly read the screen even with full sun shining on it.
B007P4YAPK,15,23,The screen does have some minor light bleed that is noticeable when the background is black but nothing that I consider overly objectionable.
B007P4YAPK,15,24,But as soon as I restored my account and opened gmail (white background) I noticed a gradient in the "yellowness" or warmth of the screen from top to bottom!
B007P4YAPK,16,0,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,16,1,Slow to load apps.
B007P4YAPK,16,2,Especially if you needed something that supports Flash.
B007P4YAPK,16,3,I didn't have an opportunity to use it for the Amazon Prime Instant Videos before it stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,16,4,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,16,5,Apparently, you need to have an 'app' in order to do most everything, and apparently they think everyone uses google mail and has a google acccount.
B007P4YAPK,16,6,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,16,7,Great product only one issue, Adobe Flash says it is not supporting this version of android OS which makes viewing certain web pages not possible.
B007P4YAPK,16,8,So far mostly he has just used free games.
B007P4YAPK,16,9,I still have complaints with some apps not optimized though, but this I think is the same with all android devices.
B007P4YAPK,16,10,Certain apps don't work on the tab and alot of apps seem like they are still in the beta phase.
B007P4YAPK,16,11,Using the Flash Player crashes after a while.
B007P4YAPK,16,12,My son likes to play games, that is his main use of the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,16,13,I got this fixed simply installing the app "juicy defender plus"Tegra 3 compatibility issues with several games, most of them fixed after rebooting, the game just freeze after 10-15 seconds.
B007P4YAPK,16,14,Still waiting for the games to start showing up for it in the play storeAnother plus is the support and following this tablet is seeing at Xda forums already.
B007P4YAPK,16,15,However, the same problem happens with the default browser and Google Chrome.
B007P4YAPK,16,16,Apps, browser and native email program freeze up all the time, probably about 10-20% of the time.3.
B007P4YAPK,16,17,Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you.
B007P4YAPK,16,18,My only disappointment is that there isn't a version of Adobe Flash player for this OS yet!
B007P4YAPK,16,19,But as it is, I still have the opportunity to create a new gmail account to use exclusively with google play.
B007P4YAPK,16,20,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,16,21,After booting, turn airplane mode off.The last problem is more with quality control on the google play store, than the tablet myself.
B007P4YAPK,16,22,I do miss the fact that I can get Adobe Flash Player install, but hey I guess one can't have everything......yet!
B007P4YAPK,16,23,However, he did try to buy a couple of games on the android market.
B007P4YAPK,16,24,some times I get unresponsive messages, or some other times my browser just close out.Browser issues, I tried them all, skyfire, chrome, firefox beta, browser ICS, opera, dolphin all of them behave erratically randomly.Screen quality is so so, not as great as tf201 and overall not better(visually) than tf101some google play store apps/games no longer worked.
B007P4YAPK,17,0,Not good product.
B007P4YAPK,17,1,It is a waste of money
B007P4YAPK,17,2,What a waste of money, I could Just Puke!!!
B007P4YAPK,17,3,Very good if you get good one.
B007P4YAPK,17,4,So, like the title of my review says, this will be my last Asus purchase.
B007P4YAPK,17,5,they doesn't return full money.
B007P4YAPK,17,6,I'm 62 years old and have dealt with quite a few.I will NEVER, EVER, buy any ASUS product again and will never recommend that company.
B007P4YAPK,17,7,Guess I should have bought an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,17,8,Do not buy this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,17,9,I purchased this tablet along wit 3 other items.
B007P4YAPK,17,10,My first tablet, my last ASUS product.
B007P4YAPK,17,11,Please DO NOT waste your $.
B007P4YAPK,17,12,I wasted so much $ on this.
B007P4YAPK,17,13,If you must have one, spend the extra money and buy an iPad...or buy a cheap notebook instead.
B007P4YAPK,17,14,Don't buy this junk!
B007P4YAPK,17,15,Do not purchase this product you may regret it in the end and could end up spending more then you think for this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,17,16,It was very, VERY much worth the money.
B007P4YAPK,17,17,I'm so, so disappointed.
B007P4YAPK,17,18,I will never buy ASUS again.
B007P4YAPK,17,19,I purchased the Asus tablet as a reasonable-priced iPad.
B007P4YAPK,17,20,Stay away from such products.Save yourself money, time and frustration.
B007P4YAPK,17,21,I bought this tablet in best buy and paid the full price for it when it first came out.
B007P4YAPK,17,22,Overall, for the price of this tablet, I don't think you can get any better!
B007P4YAPK,17,23,This product soured me on tablets.
B007P4YAPK,17,24,If you want a 7" tablet that is the tablet to buy.
B007P4YAPK,18,0,WON'T CHARGE.
B007P4YAPK,18,1,My tablet would not charge from either charger, but both chargers work with her tablet.
B007P4YAPK,18,2,I plugged it in and did not get the battery symbol.
B007P4YAPK,18,3,Had it for 3 days and could not charge it.
B007P4YAPK,18,4,"52seconds on 100% battery charge.." really?
B007P4YAPK,18,5,If you see the battery symbol is low charge for 8 hours.
B007P4YAPK,18,6,This time i couldn't turn it back on.
B007P4YAPK,18,7,My battery can be charging or fully charged and the unit would give me the most random battery status.
B007P4YAPK,18,8,When the battery is very low, even if it's plugged in, you cannot turn it on for 5 minutes or so until it charges up a little (not sure this is specific to only this tablet).5.
B007P4YAPK,18,9,The battery is full, but the thing keeps turning off.
B007P4YAPK,18,10,It keeps turning off.
B007P4YAPK,18,11,I have had this unit for a month plus 4 days and it will no longer charge.
B007P4YAPK,18,12,However, within about a month, it started turning itself completely off, and It started to get cumbersome turning it back on.
B007P4YAPK,18,13,I usually get 2 days out of it before I charge it.
B007P4YAPK,18,14,This tablet was used no more than two hours a day.
B007P4YAPK,18,15,Only problems I have had with it is that it would not always turn on.
B007P4YAPK,18,16,Battery life is around 7 hours for almost constant use.
B007P4YAPK,18,17,A few other times the screen wouldn't turn back on even though I'm pushing the power button multiple times.
B007P4YAPK,18,18,Other times, I would do the same thing and the docking station would immediately go from a full charge to zero WITHOUT charging the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,18,19,But this week it started turning off randomly.
B007P4YAPK,18,20,How can you receive something new and it doesn't even turn on.
B007P4YAPK,18,21,I am in the process of 8 hour charging.
B007P4YAPK,18,22,( I am hoping that I left it on and the battery went dead) If it does not turn on after 8 hours call them again.
B007P4YAPK,18,23,Then one night I plugged it in to charge overnight and woke up the next morning to find that both the connector on the charger and the charger port had overheated and melted.
B007P4YAPK,18,24,Sent back to Asus two times because it would not turn on after recharging.
B007P4YAPK,19,0,Good tablet with sound issue.
B007P4YAPK,19,1,It has surprisingly loud audio, but it lacks stereo output (either because there's just one speaker, or, if there are two speakers, they're too close together).
B007P4YAPK,19,2,I bought this tablet in February of 2013 and it stopped working (no video, no audio) in June, 2014.
B007P4YAPK,19,3,It's a little top heavy and having the speakers on the side is a little annoying but worth the price!
B007P4YAPK,19,4,This means that watching a movie or playing a game in landscape (as they should be watched/played) meant that you only got sound out of one side, which doesn't sound like a big problem but it actually is really annoying really quickly considering that tablet speakers tend to be tinny sounding and aurally grating.
B007P4YAPK,19,5,As for speakers, it only has one, on the right (or bottom) side.
B007P4YAPK,19,6,Cannot believe the lack of quality!
B007P4YAPK,19,7,Imagine someone talking loudly into one ear, and you'll know what it was like to listen to this speaker at any useable volume.
B007P4YAPK,19,8,The applications all downloaded easily and work well, I bought an external speaker to listen through the speakers on the tablet are fine.
B007P4YAPK,19,9,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,19,10,did not see issues related to bleeding screen, system resets, etc.However, occasionally, sound will be muted/gone.
B007P4YAPK,19,11,I wish there were speakers on both, or even three sides like some competitors have, but they sound clear and are loud enough for me.
B007P4YAPK,19,12,It is a little slow on refresh, but the resolution is good.
B007P4YAPK,19,13,I hear it is pretty good with Skype too, but I did not try that.
B007P4YAPK,19,14,If I want louder I plug in headphones or connect some via bluetooth.Now on to the bad.
B007P4YAPK,19,15,This lesser quality comes with a lesser price tag so it all works out.
B007P4YAPK,19,16,It still retained that swirled finish, which looked very nice and was practical too, since it provided a better grip.The single external speaker was pitiful as most tablet speakers are.
B007P4YAPK,19,17,After a short while, I find out the screen does not respond to touch on the narrow edge near the headphone jack.
B007P4YAPK,19,18,Good enough but could be better!
B007P4YAPK,19,19,The only things I have a small gripe about are, there is a little light leakage at the corners of the screen when the background is black, and the WiFi could be better.
B007P4YAPK,19,20,The build quality (or maybe the internal design) is not what I would call "bulletproof".
B007P4YAPK,19,21,Even if there were 2, there is no way you could get stereo sound with speakers so close together, so one is enough.I decided to buy the matching keyboard for it, and now when I show friends my purchase they say "Oh!
B007P4YAPK,19,22,I am extremely disappointed.
B007P4YAPK,19,23,However, the TF300t speaker was particularly irritating because it was on the side of the tablet when held in landscape.
B007P4YAPK,19,24,However, after several weeks of usage I did notice a few things that made me wish for better design.First I do get a little lag every now and then, even a little freezing of apps.
B007P4YAPK,20,0,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B007P4YAPK,20,1,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,20,2,The camera is decent quality, the image is grainy and when zoomed in the image is very jagged/razor-like.
B007P4YAPK,20,3,The camera has become completely useless.
B007P4YAPK,20,4,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,20,5,Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera.
B007P4YAPK,20,6,bad digitizer and no manufacturer suppor.
B007P4YAPK,20,7,The repair shops have great difficulty finding digitizer screens to replace them with.
B007P4YAPK,20,8,It holds up well against any other tablet I've worked with and better than some.
B007P4YAPK,20,9,If it ever freezes which is usually caused by an app I just wait a few seconds and everything goes back to normal.Camera/Webcam- Both the camera and webcam are decent for this tablet; I was not expecting them to be head turning so no complaints here.-
B007P4YAPK,20,10,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,20,11,I was at work and received a text saying it had been delivered to my front door.
B007P4YAPK,20,12,They have several of these tablets in their shop and can't get digitizers for them.
B007P4YAPK,20,13,Weird, since I don't have many images on the device.
B007P4YAPK,20,14,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,20,15,I usually have the screen at 80-100%- I really like that the screen can actually get pretty dark.
B007P4YAPK,20,16,Some quick touch ups in an app, and the photo was pretty acceptable.-
B007P4YAPK,20,17,i have not had occasion to use the camera other than to check out how it works.
B007P4YAPK,20,18,I restarted it and once again it worked for 2 to 3 weeks until the screen stopped working again...When I called asus this time they said there is nothing they can do because it is out of warranty!
B007P4YAPK,20,19,In my personal opinion I like this tablet and the only thing that is wrong with it is that there are not many apps that are made for android tablets yet.
B007P4YAPK,20,20,I have a tight-fitting slim-fit case that has a clasp that holds it shut.
B007P4YAPK,20,21,Cannot believe the lack of quality!
B007P4YAPK,20,22,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B007P4YAPK,20,23,This lesser quality comes with a lesser price tag so it all works out.
B007P4YAPK,20,24,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,21,0,The speed of the processor was a let down.
B007P4YAPK,21,1,Is it too much to ask to be able to load pages at a speed greater than dialup?
B007P4YAPK,21,2,However, it is still slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,3,Has quad core processor, 1 GB RAM, and cannot handle any process intensive tasks.
B007P4YAPK,21,4,Again, my hypothesis is slow read speeds.-
B007P4YAPK,21,5,Was hoping it was a little bit better.
B007P4YAPK,21,6,Video is OK.- Performance is very slow when in power saving mode/balanced mode but tends to be a little better when in performance mode.
B007P4YAPK,21,7,Personally not a fan of Samsung either, but hey I would bet that it performs well than this piece of junk even though the processor is dual core only.-
B007P4YAPK,21,8,Hopefully a new breed of tegra 3 competitors(tablets) will emerge anytime soon with faster and improved SoC's(28nm instead 40nm fab process on tegra 3 SoC) as samsung exynos quad core and qualcomm snapdragon S4.
B007P4YAPK,21,9,It's just that the READ SPEEDS are slow (despite it being an SSD).
B007P4YAPK,21,10,Reloading and reconfiguring a bit of a pain but download speeds now as I would wish them to be.
B007P4YAPK,21,11,If you are not going to ROM it you might be disappointed with the speed of the device using the stock ROM it comes with.
B007P4YAPK,21,12,It's not because there's something wrong with the OS or processor.
B007P4YAPK,21,13,Quad core vs. duo core is main one but also now has 8mp full 1080p HI DEF video capability (old was 5mp 740p video) both taking and sending to your monitor.
B007P4YAPK,21,14,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,21,15,Slow to load apps.
B007P4YAPK,21,16,The OS will think something is wrong, but in reality, it's just the data isn't loading fast enough.
B007P4YAPK,21,17,I use mine strictly on home wifi, with the highest speed router on the market.
B007P4YAPK,21,18,Apps, graphics, so what?
B007P4YAPK,21,19,Its an awsome tablet in the price range.
B007P4YAPK,21,20,Mine runs at 1.6 Ghz when I need it to.
B007P4YAPK,21,21,If you play a game like minion rush which is not even that process intensive, then it keeps skipping during display.-
B007P4YAPK,21,22,I've purchased five iPads over the years, starting with the very first generation and none had screen issues; neither did my Samsung Galaxy Tab.
B007P4YAPK,21,23,The worst thing is the performance degradation is not noticeable when trying out the tablet in the store, but as you use it and try to do a little multitasking then it just breaks.-
B007P4YAPK,21,24,some games behave funny, seems like some compatibility issues towards tegra 3 chipset.Wifi Issues, sometimes it takes an unusual extra time just to display some pages.
B007P4YAPK,22,0,HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6.
B007P4YAPK,22,1,transferring larger files or folders from the micro sd card will fail a lot of times it just sits there with its little window open with nothing happening.
B007P4YAPK,22,2,The tablet has difficulty recognizing a microSD card when it is plugged in.
B007P4YAPK,22,3,It treats SD cards like you're only swapping a bit of data and taking it out.
B007P4YAPK,22,4,I added a 32 Gig micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,22,5,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,22,6,first wifi direct connects but that is it, its not in the menu to transfer files and it does not accept incoming files this is a pain because wifi direct can transfer large files (music video) in seconds sometime quicker than USB.
B007P4YAPK,22,7,The system still running, and I can still retrieve my file using the USB.
B007P4YAPK,22,8,I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts.
B007P4YAPK,22,9,I have been told that there is a better key board app that can be down loaded.
B007P4YAPK,22,10,As a result, they ate up a non-trivial amount of processing power and memory.
B007P4YAPK,22,11,Having said that, I added a Poetic Hardback case which added a lot of stiffness/rigidity to the tablet.I'm very happy with the TF300, screen quality is good, has hdmi out, expandable storage via micro sd card slot, and you can add a USB adapter (which I bought) for external storage.
B007P4YAPK,22,12,It doesn't care that you put it in there because you wanted more space for the tablet alone!
B007P4YAPK,22,13,The included SD slot makes it very expandable and is something that Nexus devices will never have.
B007P4YAPK,22,14,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,22,15,Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you.
B007P4YAPK,22,16,I was used to my husband's iPad but once I set up my home screen and downloaded some apps, I was good to go.
B007P4YAPK,22,17,I'll have to write it down & file it for safekeeping.
B007P4YAPK,22,18,I also love the fact that I can add memory to it although I still have a lot of memory left on the pre-installed memory card.
B007P4YAPK,22,19,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,22,20,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,22,21,Apps, browser and native email program freeze up all the time, probably about 10-20% of the time.3.
B007P4YAPK,22,22,The camera takes clear pictures and you are able to play video games that has lots of speed and motion.
B007P4YAPK,22,23,This was a common problem for this model, and in general, is a common problem with IPS screens.The biggest drawback to this tablet is the 1GB of RAM.
B007P4YAPK,22,24,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,23,0,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,23,1,The WiFi is slow, even though I have a high speed N network using a top-notch wireless router.
B007P4YAPK,23,2,My only complaint with it is that its wireless doesn't seem to make as good of a connection as it should.
B007P4YAPK,23,3,I have a pretty strong wireless signal in my bedroom but this tablet seems to often drop the signal.
B007P4YAPK,23,4,Browsing the Internet crashes.
B007P4YAPK,23,5,The one thing I have an issue with is the browser.
B007P4YAPK,23,6,Everything worked for nearly 9 days.
B007P4YAPK,23,7,Several times per days like lugs or something.
B007P4YAPK,23,8,For those that work im sure it's a pretty nifty tablet, but im all set.
B007P4YAPK,23,9,And I'm sure they'll address the web browser in the next update.
B007P4YAPK,23,10,However, the same problem happens with the default browser and Google Chrome.
B007P4YAPK,23,11,Accessing my network drive crashes.
B007P4YAPK,23,12,Then same problems happen again.
B007P4YAPK,23,13,Nothing but problems.
B007P4YAPK,23,14,But you will still receive notifications and stay connected to wifi once screen is off.
B007P4YAPK,23,15,We first tried a factory reset but it did not resolve the problem.
B007P4YAPK,23,16,Now, I've used Swiftkey on three other phones AND the Nexus 7, and had no problems with it.
B007P4YAPK,23,17,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,23,18,My wifi connection rarely registers a full signal even though I use the tablet in the same room as the router most of the time.7.
B007P4YAPK,23,19,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,23,20,Right now I am having problems with my tablet staying on, and the browser closing on me, and when I shut it down it seem to be back on.
B007P4YAPK,23,21,A re-installation of the app usually fixes this problem.
B007P4YAPK,23,22,And 2- even though the network is connected while sleeping (there's actually a setting for this), upon waking you have to wait for any updates to install before you can really use it for anything.Update 12\19 2013; I'm downgrading the network performance to poor/unacceptable.
B007P4YAPK,23,23,The tablet hangs a lot, even after all kinds of reset, restarts problem still persists.
B007P4YAPK,23,24,Sometimes when the device has been asleep, or freshly booted wifi refuses to turn on.
B007P4YAPK,24,0,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,24,1,Touch screen didn't work!
B007P4YAPK,24,2,The on screen keyboard takes some getting used to.
B007P4YAPK,24,3,Cracked Screen.
B007P4YAPK,24,4,Screen Cracked while in Dock.
B007P4YAPK,24,5,When i recieved my tf-300, the touch screen didn't work.
B007P4YAPK,24,6,The touch screen does not work correctly.
B007P4YAPK,24,7,ASUS TF 300 touch screen quit after 5 weeks.
B007P4YAPK,24,8,The touch screen stopped responding but for awhile I could dock it to the keyboard and it would respond.
B007P4YAPK,24,9,Constantly Freezes, touch screen stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,24,10,Then touch screen started behaving crazy.
B007P4YAPK,24,11,Tablet worked flawlessly, but the keyboard docking station kept giving me problems.
B007P4YAPK,24,12,This tablet was great ... for a month, then the touch screen became unresponsive for no apparent reason.
B007P4YAPK,24,13,Tablet looks very good until I have a problems with touch screen.After about 4 weeks of using screen at top right part become occasionally unresponsive.
B007P4YAPK,24,14,I returned that one the next day because it was so slow and the touch screen was random.
B007P4YAPK,24,15,Several times per days like lugs or something.
B007P4YAPK,24,16,I literally put the tablet in the dock, closed the dock, came back later and when I opened the dock the screen had cracked tremendously on the top right.
B007P4YAPK,24,17,Touchscreen was unresponsive the first time, power button and rebooting issues the other times.
B007P4YAPK,24,18,Unfortunately, after 4 months, the screen stopped sensing touch input.
B007P4YAPK,24,19,This was it... until it stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,24,20,Everything worked for nearly 9 days.
B007P4YAPK,24,21,Although I didn't buy it, I like the docking keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,24,22,This unit worked fine until the screen spontaneously cracked on its own after simply being shut with its docking station which should protect it and was then opened.
B007P4YAPK,24,23,Even when we're not touching or using the tablet I noticed it just reboots itself.
B007P4YAPK,24,24,Because i use the screen and don't intend on buying the dock so this problem is irrelevant to me.
B007P4YAPK,25,0,At first I was thinking I wouldn't be able to tell the difference... but I was wrong.This does not make me want to get the New iPad however, because I don't like the "Apple" way of doing things.
B007P4YAPK,25,1,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,25,2,I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire.
B007P4YAPK,25,3,Asus Tf 300.
B007P4YAPK,25,4,I purchased the Asus tablet as a reasonable-priced iPad.
B007P4YAPK,25,5,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,25,6,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,25,7,Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,25,8,I've purchased five iPads over the years, starting with the very first generation and none had screen issues; neither did my Samsung Galaxy Tab.
B007P4YAPK,25,9,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,25,10,Give me the simplicity and functionality of an Android device like this any day.
B007P4YAPK,25,11,I don't want a $600 device.
B007P4YAPK,25,12,Also, the on screen ASUS keyboard is very glitchy.
B007P4YAPK,25,13,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,25,14,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,25,15,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,25,16,The screen is inferior to both the Transformer Prime and the Apple Ipad 2 (its nearest Ipad competitor).6.
B007P4YAPK,25,17,Software-wise, ASUS tends to give you more liberty than others, like motorola, samsung, apple, etc. You'll get OTA updates a lot, enough to make you feel like you're not being left out.
B007P4YAPK,25,18,My 2 year old Samsung Galaxy S I now feels like a Ferrari compared to this product.
B007P4YAPK,25,19,Hopefully this will change since there are so many great Android products out now.
B007P4YAPK,25,20,Good tablet for the time.
B007P4YAPK,25,21,not good.
B007P4YAPK,25,22,That's always  good thing!
B007P4YAPK,25,23,Feature set for the price is great.. Asus seems to be the top as far as updates go.
B007P4YAPK,25,24,Bought the Keyboard that only works on this asus product, bought a nice case, and bought a screen protector.
B007P4YAPK,26,0,It also gives me usb ports.
B007P4YAPK,26,1,computer USB port or standard usb charger will not charge it.as
B007P4YAPK,26,2,I don't like the propriety plug, and the no USB port.
B007P4YAPK,26,3,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,26,4,Not necessary if you get the keyboard, however, as the keyboard has a full sized usb port built in.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Just found out that standard USB chargers (of any amperage) do not charge this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,26,5,Be aware that when you are charging the keyboard, the tablet won't always charge to 100%.
B007P4YAPK,26,6,That cable that comes with it can get power from an ordinary USB port, but the amount of power would be so low it would take the whole day to recharge from a standard USB.
B007P4YAPK,26,7,I would have liked to be able to use the keyboard from a distance, without it being connected to the tablet, which would have been nice considering the HDMI port.
B007P4YAPK,26,8,This tablet requires the ASUS-only 15 volt adapter in the wall to charge.
B007P4YAPK,26,9,Plugging in a micro hdmi cord was a little difficult due to this, and I am sure the port would break off if i did it often.
B007P4YAPK,26,10,Using the provided transformer, the tablet and keyboard are recharged within a few hours.The keyboard has support for 1 USB port, which I did not try yet except to recharge my phone.
B007P4YAPK,26,11,Then my HDMI port got a short.
B007P4YAPK,26,12,Almost all other chargers use the USB standard 5 volts (including iPad or Nexus 7).
B007P4YAPK,26,13,I have the USB adapter but its not great.
B007P4YAPK,26,14,You may want to charge them separately.
B007P4YAPK,26,15,Do micro-USBs not provide enough power?
B007P4YAPK,26,16,Only problem was the micro chip port.
B007P4YAPK,26,17,My tablet would not charge from either charger, but both chargers work with her tablet.
B007P4YAPK,26,18,Also, the keyboards don't appear to be getting stocked anymore, so, if you're going to get one, get one soon.Also, if you get this tablet, this is a handy addition: ASUS USB Kit for Eee Pad Transformer TF101, TF101G, TF201 & TF300 Tablets  This is a dongle that plugs into the charging port and allows you to use USB devices (Hard Drive, thumb drive, keyboard, mouse, gaming pad) with the pad.
B007P4YAPK,26,19,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,26,20,Also, you pretty much have to use the tablet upside-down when the adapter or the power cord is connected.
B007P4YAPK,26,21,However, if you feel you have to do it, that cable plugs into the tablet, to recharge as you use it.
B007P4YAPK,26,22,In the end, I decided that the USB adapter and this tablet would suffice.
B007P4YAPK,26,23,If I want louder I plug in headphones or connect some via bluetooth.Now on to the bad.
B007P4YAPK,26,24,The USB adapter works but I would have much preferred a cable because it becomes a rather long moment arm hanging off of a delicate connector when it is in place.
B007P4YAPK,27,0,Cracked Screen.
B007P4YAPK,27,1,I did what they said and it worked, but then only two weeks later the screen stopped responding again.
B007P4YAPK,27,2,Constantly Freezes, touch screen stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,27,3,It just didn't work.
B007P4YAPK,27,4,The tablet worked fine for a few weeks.
B007P4YAPK,27,5,Although during the second day I did have a screen glitch where the screen would gitter up and down.
B007P4YAPK,27,6,The unit was 80 days old when I woke up one morning and found a cracked screen.
B007P4YAPK,27,7,When we received the tablet back the touch screen worked perfectly.
B007P4YAPK,27,8,After a couple of week I received the tablet back, when I turned on the tablet the initial screen worked and and i set it down.
B007P4YAPK,27,9,Touchscreen stopped working...
B007P4YAPK,27,10,Anyway, I don't even know how it cracked.
B007P4YAPK,27,11,I've been without the tablet for 2 months now.
B007P4YAPK,27,12,Screen Cracked while in Dock.
B007P4YAPK,27,13,Then the glass cracked.
B007P4YAPK,27,14,I have not yet tried to contact Asus but will try in a couple of weeks.Overall the tablet was working fine.
B007P4YAPK,27,15,Indeed, I can't see it if I am not looking at it closely.After the third week of my use, suddenly one day, I found the screen cracked!
B007P4YAPK,27,16,Add me to the group of cracked screen.
B007P4YAPK,27,17,This unit works perfectly, no more shut downs for no reason.
B007P4YAPK,27,18,Without even installing any apps the system started constantly freezing.
B007P4YAPK,27,19,Buyer Beware - Screen VERY EASY to crack.
B007P4YAPK,27,20,I have really enjoyed my transformer but with the 10" screen I advise getting a cover for it at the same time and you should look into the accident ins from squaretrade as well because I dropped my tablet and the LED screen cracked totally my fault but it still worked great I have sent it to squaretrade to have the screen replaced should be back to me within 10 days
B007P4YAPK,27,21,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,27,22,As my TF300 screen cracked during normal use and was never dropped or mishandled, I was wary of the same thing happening again, (despite my suspicion that the glass in my original TF300 was faulty from the start as the screen did dip slightly and have permanent marks on it right out of the box from new.
B007P4YAPK,27,23,It worked ok over the 20 months or so I had it but always seemed a little laggy and hitchy.
B007P4YAPK,27,24,The tf300 is a dud.If yours hasn't cracked, it will.
B007P4YAPK,28,0,I contacted ASUS customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,1,It took about 3 weeks until the tablet returned and about one week later the problem returned.I sent it to ASUS repair again, and it was returned about 3 weeks later.
B007P4YAPK,28,2,A++++++ for amazon customer service!!
B007P4YAPK,28,3,They have no incentive to provide any actual customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,4,He said tech support was very backlogged.
B007P4YAPK,28,5,so I called ASUS support by phone.
B007P4YAPK,28,6,No warranty or support.
B007P4YAPK,28,7,I was assured that my tablet was still under warranty and that I could send it in for assessment and possible repair.
B007P4YAPK,28,8,Horrible customer support from ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,28,9,I waitied until the end of the day, and called Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,28,10,As for that tech support...........I just hopeI don't have to use it.
B007P4YAPK,28,11,Tech support marginal.
B007P4YAPK,28,12,While ASUS is willing to make the repairs, I have to pay the shipping to their repair facility.
B007P4YAPK,28,13,Disappointing Customer Service.
B007P4YAPK,28,14,She called me back the next afternoon to see if I had received it yet.
B007P4YAPK,28,15,they told me I needed to send it in--at my cost--they would evaluate it and send me a quote.
B007P4YAPK,28,16,have not recieved my tablet back from the Asus repair facility they have had it since 7/8/12.
B007P4YAPK,28,17,I had problems with the tablet freezing and I called tech support several times.
B007P4YAPK,28,18,So we came back to Amazon to get a replacement and were told that they would not replace the item.
B007P4YAPK,28,19,They don't have the replacement number for their own product?
B007P4YAPK,28,20,To add insult to injury, when we called Asus service they strongly encouraged us to return the unit to Amazon for replacement.
B007P4YAPK,28,21,That is a problem Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,28,22,Asus said they only repair and we would have to pay to send the item to them.
B007P4YAPK,28,23,I then said to tell me what the replacement part number was if I wanted to repair it myself.
B007P4YAPK,28,24,They told me it was at the repair facility but had not been received.
B007P4YAPK,29,0,Touch screen didn't work!
B007P4YAPK,29,1,Slow to load apps.
B007P4YAPK,29,2,Asus just downloaded a firmware update tonight so lets see if that fixes anything.7/7/12:
B007P4YAPK,29,3,Unfortunately, in the real world, things tend to work differently.
B007P4YAPK,29,4,So far, there's nothing I've tried to do with it that's slowed it down.I did notice two glitches; the browser shut down a couple of times for no reason and had a hard time coming back up.
B007P4YAPK,29,5,I like all capacity this tablet gives me, the only thing i don't like very much is the presicion for pointing places on the screen.
B007P4YAPK,29,6,Random reboots.
B007P4YAPK,29,7,o ---Update #1: Sept 4th, 2012.
B007P4YAPK,29,8,This time i couldn't turn it back on.
B007P4YAPK,29,9,The reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because there have been a few glitches where apps will randomly close on its own.
B007P4YAPK,29,10,If your tablet didn't update automatically (mine didn't) do so manually under Settings/About Tablet/System Firmware Update.
B007P4YAPK,29,11,You'd think it was a Microsoft OS the way it crashes so much.
B007P4YAPK,29,12,It wasn't the hardware but the software that was disappointing.
B007P4YAPK,29,13,A re-installation of the app usually fixes this problem.
B007P4YAPK,29,14,Good hardware, shady software.
B007P4YAPK,29,15,It has taken some time to familiarize myself with the Android OS, but I'm getting the hang of it now.
B007P4YAPK,29,16,Random reboots happen when moved or shaken after 8 months.
B007P4YAPK,29,17,It's fast and reliable, but i seems the only time I ever use it is when my laptop is further away or completely shutdown.
B007P4YAPK,29,18,Sometime was slow and would occasionally hang up.
B007P4YAPK,29,19,it can hang and things can crash.for
B007P4YAPK,29,20,Pre-installed softwares are not upto the mark.Softwares are not customized, its as we can find in ICS 4.0.If Asus will modify the softwares like samsung.
B007P4YAPK,29,21,Sometimes i'm forced to use my little finger.
B007P4YAPK,29,22,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,29,23,So, why 4 stars instead of 5? The instructions are non-existent.
B007P4YAPK,29,24,Lot of bloatware apps included that makes your tablet slower than it already is.-
