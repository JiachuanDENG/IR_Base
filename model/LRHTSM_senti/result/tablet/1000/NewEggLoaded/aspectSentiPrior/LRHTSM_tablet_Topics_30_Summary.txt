B008DWG5HE,0,0,For those who wants to use this device to read.
B008DWG5HE,0,1,I love it!
B008DWG5HE,0,2,I suggest you buy amazon kindle fire HD, although there's no S-pen.
B008DWG5HE,0,3,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,0,4,But if I use this device, I cannot see the character clearly.
B008DWG5HE,0,5,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,0,6,Larger screen for reading, magazine viewing and pictures than a Nook.
B008DWG5HE,0,7,Colors are bright, text is crisp when viewed like you would normally, and 720p (HD) videos look fantastic.
B008DWG5HE,0,8,We`ve gone from black and white to 12" color TVs all the way to easily available 60" LED TVs....why would I want to revert to a 10" screen to watch movies etc....that`s what my 42" is for.
B008DWG5HE,0,9,Good device....needs a few improvements.
B008DWG5HE,0,10,For the naysayers who complain about the screen resolution and compare it to the Retina display on the iPad, my first comment is guess what?
B008DWG5HE,0,11,I am guessing, from reading comparative reviews of the ASus transformer infinity, that these things would not occur on a high resolution screen.
B008DWG5HE,0,12,Although the display is colorful and vivid, the resolution lags other tablets in this price class like the Asus Transformer Pad Infinity and the iPad (3rd Gen).
B008DWG5HE,0,13,Because S-pen is not that useful.I returned it after one day because of the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,0,14,Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as "floaters" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,0,15,I'm on my second book out of a 3 book series using the Kindle app.
B008DWG5HE,0,16,I also read a lot, and while the 10.1" format is a bit clunky for e-reading compared to my 7" Nook Color (the large size makes it more awkward to hold even though it's actually lighter), it's adequate for the purpose.However, that's the beauty of android tablets -- there's sizes and types for everyone.
B008DWG5HE,0,17,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B008DWG5HE,0,18,And I confess, I bought one of the first iPads when they came out, have upgraded every time since so am pretty much married to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,0,19,The Galaxy Note had some of the best and most consistently good reviews on the Internet, and given how much I loved and used my previous tablet, I decided to upgrade to the Galaxy.Good:- Lightweight- Good screen- Good sound- The S-Pen is nice, though I use it mostly in games and programs when the touch zones are too small for my fingers.
B008DWG5HE,0,20,It is bright and colors are vibrant.
B008DWG5HE,0,21,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B008DWG5HE,0,22,I've been carrying around a sketchbook and pencil forever, but it's frustrating to only be able to work in shades of gray (who wants to cart around a case of colored pencils or pastels to all places?) as well as having to scan and re-touch the scans of any sketches I make.The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is what I ended up upgrading from a Nook Color.
B008DWG5HE,0,23,The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.
B008DWG5HE,0,24,This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device.
B008DWG5HE,1,0,Other apps can give you .psd
B008DWG5HE,1,1,I'm on my second book out of a 3 book series using the Kindle app.
B008DWG5HE,1,2,I found it logical for the most part.The app selection seems very good.
B008DWG5HE,1,3,Their store is useful but that is all I use.
B008DWG5HE,1,4,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,1,5,You can always browse the Google Play store before buying the tablet to see if what you want is there (although not all apps are supported by all devices- I learned sadly the Popcap games there are not supported for this tablet).
B008DWG5HE,1,6,It also supports Nook and Kindle (and I'm sure others) so you can shop at other app stores too for your games, music, movies, books, etc, you are not tied just to Google.I think this tablet is a great size for reading, I generally tilt it sideways for browsing the web or reading.
B008DWG5HE,1,7,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,1,8,While downloading apps, the Google Play Store froze on the Asus, never on the Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,1,9,I can use the many apps available on the play store for personal activities as well as work tasks.
B008DWG5HE,1,10,I managed to set up this tablet using a few productivity apps for work and the apps cost me nothing.Pros: Huge number of apps available on play store that are built for tablet use.
B008DWG5HE,1,11,Therefore, this tablet will not run Flash video.
B008DWG5HE,1,12,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B008DWG5HE,1,13,But hey that's what Google is for.
B008DWG5HE,1,14,Thus, I cannot watch Amazon Prime TV/Movies, nor can I access some of the other web pages I frequent.
B008DWG5HE,1,15,That will no longer be a problem as I can have my notes all on this one device.I've downloaded several free apps...one of my favorites is Evernote...great for taking notes....grocery lists, work out logs, Sunday School lessons so I can teach paperless!!
B008DWG5HE,1,16,One of the problems- Every time I clicked on any link/button to install flash, the device would take me to the play store and tell me flash wasn't available.I eventually found an application that requires flash, downloaded it, and let it install flash automatically, thus bypassing all automatic links to the google play store.However, once flash player is installed, it still doesn't work as well as a PC with the sites I frequent (rosetta stone, amazon).
B008DWG5HE,1,17,I rarely use google for anything, much less use my pad for music, movies, books, magazines or the popular social media.
B008DWG5HE,1,18,I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app.
B008DWG5HE,1,19,It's only for S Note app.  - Multiscreen feature can only be used with few built-in apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,20,If I had not downloaded an old version of Flash for android on the web, I would have had to return this amazing tablet!Be wary that without Flash software you will not be able to run objects like Amazon instant videos since they require it.
B008DWG5HE,1,21,While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,22,I can make whatever mix of widgets and app icons wherever I want (you have 6 full screens you can lay out and swipe between, so I made themed ones- email, news, calendar, games, internet apps, and music/videos).
B008DWG5HE,1,23,Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you.
B008DWG5HE,1,24,Web pages load quickly but not as quickly as other devices.
B008DWG5HE,2,0,Great.
B008DWG5HE,2,1,This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device.
B008DWG5HE,2,2,Great tablet but do your research before buying.
B008DWG5HE,2,3,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,2,4,I bought this before I went on Vacation last summer, So I have now owned it for about 9 months.
B008DWG5HE,2,5,From one artist to any others out there, do not buy this product.
B008DWG5HE,2,6,All of these awesome devices are coming out at actual competitive prices, who the heck can justify paying 550 for THIS?!
B008DWG5HE,2,7,I went to Best Buy several times to poke at this tablet before deciding to buy.
B008DWG5HE,2,8,Samsung was on the path to great product until they started to make it exclusive to thier products!!
B008DWG5HE,2,9,I have owned 2 other android tablets before this and this 1 is by far the best.
B008DWG5HE,2,10,Best Android tablet I have owned.
B008DWG5HE,2,11,I love it!
B008DWG5HE,2,12,I should have bought an Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,2,13,At roughly $200 it is a great price and very snappy tablet.
B008DWG5HE,2,14,I compared prices and specification and of course Amazon price won!
B008DWG5HE,2,15,Great tablet for the money.
B008DWG5HE,2,16,And I confess, I bought one of the first iPads when they came out, have upgraded every time since so am pretty much married to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,2,17,All the other features are great but what good are they if you can't print your reciept after purchasing your item  from Amazon?
B008DWG5HE,2,18,It seems that everytime a new tablet comes out like this, set at this price point, people ask "is this the ipad killer"?
B008DWG5HE,2,19,Got this tablet for my husband as a gift and for 6 months it was great and he was extremely happy with it.
B008DWG5HE,2,20,This is my first purchase of a tablet and I choose Samsung Galaxy note 10.1 ( I was thinking about this for over an year and trying to get it at the right time and price).
B008DWG5HE,2,21,Now that the price has dropped for this device since the new model has been released this tablet is a great deal.
B008DWG5HE,2,22,That is one thing the ipad seems to have over Samsung is the devices seem a little more resistant to trauma.
B008DWG5HE,2,23,I saw the James Franco commercial and immediately decided to buy it.
B008DWG5HE,2,24,My point is just this, for $500, which what HIGH END tablets are going for, I would expect a little better.
B008DWG5HE,3,0,It had ample battery life sufficient for my use.
B008DWG5HE,3,1,Battery doesn't last long.
B008DWG5HE,3,2,Long battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,3,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,3,4,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,3,5,Battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,6,Always seems like we are charging it.
B008DWG5HE,3,7,I think I was down to 77% or something so battery life should be fine.
B008DWG5HE,3,8,I have to charge pretty much every other day and at times daily if I use it a lot.
B008DWG5HE,3,9,Same usage as entry 1) above, except at 30% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 10 hours.
B008DWG5HE,3,10,The battery doesn't last that long as I would have liked but that's fine with me.
B008DWG5HE,3,11,The battery does seem to do well and I had the screen pretty bright and working on a digital sketch for about 2 hours.
B008DWG5HE,3,12,Pretty good.Thus, as you can see, the battery life seems to depend heavily on how brightly the screen is set.
B008DWG5HE,3,13,home page takes about 15 seconds to fully load.Battery:I timed various usages with a chronometer and this is what I found:1) 1-1/2 hour of video at 100% brightness, 1 hour of internet with wifi on, the rest of the time using polaris office and s-note side-by-side at 60% brightness, power saving mode off - battery only lasted 6-1/2 hours.
B008DWG5HE,3,14,Battery drain seems faster than iPad.
B008DWG5HE,3,15,The display is nice and bright and the unit can be used even outside on a sunny day.
B008DWG5HE,3,16,I don't really use the Note features but so far battery life is decent, speed is quite good for an older model and the tablet is pretty light.
B008DWG5HE,3,17,Definitely not good.2) Continual looping the movie "Immortals" at 50% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 9 hours.
B008DWG5HE,3,18,If you are playing a game the battery goes low way to quick.
B008DWG5HE,3,19,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,3,20,It also supports Bluetooth.I was very impressed with the battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,21,It is powerful.
B008DWG5HE,3,22,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B008DWG5HE,3,23,Work and Home Companion.
B008DWG5HE,3,24,My only real complaint is the inability to find a nice case for it; everything I find seems to be cheap and/or garbage.It runs nicely, has a pretty good battery 5+ hours, and is pleasant on the eyes aesthetically and resolution wise.I would recommend this as a very good alternative to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,4,0,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,4,1,Great tablet, but would be better if it was cheaper.
B008DWG5HE,4,2,Feature-Packed Tablet, Better than Expected.
B008DWG5HE,4,3,Build quality is top notch.
B008DWG5HE,4,4,I sincerely believe they could have built a better tablet than this (at the price they are asking for it).
B008DWG5HE,4,5,iPad is a much better device.
B008DWG5HE,4,6,You should have not issues covering the speakers with your hands.Build Quality - GOOD - Nice fit and finish, no loose parts, no surprises.
B008DWG5HE,4,7,But to those people I also ask, wouldnt it be much better, or wouldnt you feel like you got your money's worth more if it had a solid metal backing, or maybe even a better screen res?
B008DWG5HE,4,8,But the two things that are holding it back, in my opinion is the cheap build quality and screen res.
B008DWG5HE,4,9,movies (it can even stream them from my server), which the tegra 2 cpus struggled with- very good at multitasking using the including multitasking apps- excellent at note taking using both the built in s-note app and Quill- long battery life (only had to charge it once or so a week)- nice loud stereo speakersCons:- no HD screen; although the screen isn't bad, given the price of the tablet and how this is a flagship model it should have come with a higher resolution screen like its competitors from Asus and Apple- build quality; again while not bad, it just doesnt feel like a $500US tablet with all the plastic.-
B008DWG5HE,4,10,Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine.
B008DWG5HE,4,11,It did not disappoint.Firstly, this tablet is fast, really fast.
B008DWG5HE,4,12,It has the look and feel of a top of the line tablet--and at this price it should.
B008DWG5HE,4,13,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,4,14,And the sound quality and volume were excellent.
B008DWG5HE,4,15,I wanted a tablet that had a 10.1" screen, could play HD .mkv
B008DWG5HE,4,16,- Volume is good, even louder than my laptops.
B008DWG5HE,4,17,I also like the two-tone white and silver plastics, the white in particular has a nice pearlescent finish.Specs: Some impressive internal specs with 2GBs of RAMCons:Display: Screen resolution is very low compared to the competition which makes this poor for reading text.Construction: All plastic construction which creeks and flexes to a small degree.Performance: Despite it's impressive specs, the tablet is noticeably laggy in all aspects of its operation.
B008DWG5HE,4,18,My wife has an iPad2 which I think is a better tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,19,Many of the application that I have on my galaxy note phone I've also installed on my tablet, and they move much more briskly on the tablet.Secondly, although the tablet is made up of plastic, it does not feel cheap, and feels quite robust.
B008DWG5HE,4,20,Still feels a bit plasticy, not as nice as ipad.Software - Everything seems to run without any hiccups, more polished and less buggy than what I've seen on Asus tablets.Let me know if there are any other aspects you'd like to get feedback on to help you make your decision on this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,21,As the owner of a galaxy note phone, I had very high expectations of this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,22,OK, let;s get it over with, the screen isn't as high resolution as the Apple, but it;s pretty good.
B008DWG5HE,4,23,Some quick first impressions of the Note 10.1 - This tablet is what the Transformer Prime should have been.
B008DWG5HE,4,24,The back has that brushed metal texture look, so you could tell that the designers were going for that, deceptive as it might be.
B008DWG5HE,5,0,picture great sound!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,5,1,It is easy to use, and the screen/display is great!
B008DWG5HE,5,2,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B008DWG5HE,5,3,But from the demos I have watched I think it will be fun!A few things to consider though before purchasing...first, the camera doesn't take the greatest pictures.
B008DWG5HE,5,4,Now you can tell me that its not cheap plastic, that it might even be some super polymer or what ever but to me it felt cheap.
B008DWG5HE,5,5,The battery does seem to do well and I had the screen pretty bright and working on a digital sketch for about 2 hours.
B008DWG5HE,5,6,It seems required for any portable device to have a camera nowadays, and both front and back are there, but the photos aren't great.
B008DWG5HE,5,7,The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.
B008DWG5HE,5,8,- Camera is awesome under normal light.
B008DWG5HE,5,9,It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something.
B008DWG5HE,5,10,Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine.
B008DWG5HE,5,11,However, I did try to set up the TV remote feature and for some reason it partly worked and then did not work at all.
B008DWG5HE,5,12,Pictures look well defined and clear.
B008DWG5HE,5,13,Cheap plastic.
B008DWG5HE,5,14,There was little training available and it was not as easy as I had hoped.
B008DWG5HE,5,15,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,5,16,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B008DWG5HE,5,17,Its still a good feature if you don't have super high expectations.The camera is adequate, but unimpressive.
B008DWG5HE,5,18,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,5,19,If I'm taking serious pictures, I'll stick to the digital camera I got.
B008DWG5HE,5,20,I will try setting it up again since I think this would be a pretty cool feature.
B008DWG5HE,5,21,Sorry but have to find something else.
B008DWG5HE,5,22,For low lighted scenarios, quality of photo may go down.
B008DWG5HE,5,23,Its thin and uses Gorilla Glass.
B008DWG5HE,5,24,Amazingly fast and responsive!
B008DWG5HE,6,0,It did not disappoint.Firstly, this tablet is fast, really fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,1,Amazingly fast and responsive!
B008DWG5HE,6,2,Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.
B008DWG5HE,6,3,At roughly $200 it is a great price and very snappy tablet.
B008DWG5HE,6,4,Don't expect a quad core to be amazingly faster than a dual core, but it can handle concurrent tasks with aplomb.Cons:1.
B008DWG5HE,6,5,But if you hate lag, you'll love a quad core because there's just about always enough processor for whatever the device is doing.
B008DWG5HE,6,6,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,7,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,6,8,Now I would be the first to say that I probably will never truly task a quad core to its max potential.
B008DWG5HE,6,9,I've used several tablets and smart phones with different processors and the best in my opinion is a quad core.
B008DWG5HE,6,10,The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.
B008DWG5HE,6,11,I do think that the price needs to go down a bit, and this could be a superb one.
B008DWG5HE,6,12,The spec resolution on the tablet is below average but I really don't notice it unless I have it right next to a higher res tablet and even then have to pay specific attention to it.
B008DWG5HE,6,13,Handling is smooth, and applications open quickly.
B008DWG5HE,6,14,If you are playing a game the battery goes low way to quick.
B008DWG5HE,6,15,I don't really use the Note features but so far battery life is decent, speed is quite good for an older model and the tablet is pretty light.
B008DWG5HE,6,16,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,6,17,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,6,18,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,6,19,Web pages loading time is fast but not nearly as fast as my laptop.
B008DWG5HE,6,20,If I had known that, I would've purchased the 32 gig version of the tablet.Overall, I think that this is an excellent tablet, and there's a lot of potential.
B008DWG5HE,6,21,I did a hard set twice and it came back as fast as new but it would slow again as I added Apps back in.
B008DWG5HE,6,22,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,6,23,Battery life.
B008DWG5HE,6,24,Overall it s a nice tablet plenty useful for reading and taking notes whichs is basically what i do most so far.
B008DWG5HE,7,0,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,1,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,2,I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.
B008DWG5HE,7,3,you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory?
B008DWG5HE,7,4,Free Dropbox storage is only 2 gig.
B008DWG5HE,7,5,What is best about this product is the 32gb of storage.
B008DWG5HE,7,6,The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,7,I purchased the 16 gig version of the tablet along with a 32 gig SD card for just that purpose, only to find out that I can't do that.
B008DWG5HE,7,8,SD card slot usles.
B008DWG5HE,7,9,I opted for the increased memory model because I wanted to feel as if I had the option for more memory.For traveling, it's great.
B008DWG5HE,7,10,I did some reading and decided on the 16GB since the tablet has space for ample expansion, and you can get a far larger micro SD card for the $50 difference- I got the 64GB SanDisk class 10 one.
B008DWG5HE,7,11,Haven't yet figured out how to put files onto the SD chip instead of the internal drive.The tablet comes with a two year 50 Gig access to Dropbox (file storage).
B008DWG5HE,7,12,Note 10.1  a great Tablet that have many functionabilities that others don't.Best thing is the fact that have 32Gb and the expandible memory.Galaxy Rocks!
B008DWG5HE,7,13,You actually start with more like 11.6GB free space after the OS and whatnot, and 59.5GB on the card (I'm not sure why about that, I think it may have come with stuff on it).
B008DWG5HE,7,14,The only thing to be aware of is some things will only work or want to go on the internal memory, and like any storage drive, the number is a lie.
B008DWG5HE,7,15,Sure, you won't get the super-high 1080p clarity you might get with a different higher-res tablet, but who wants to waste SD card space on a video twice the size for a display that's not even close to a desktop monitor in size?
B008DWG5HE,7,16,As Androids to, this is the best one.
B008DWG5HE,7,17,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,7,18,If I had known that, I would've purchased the 32 gig version of the tablet.Overall, I think that this is an excellent tablet, and there's a lot of potential.
B008DWG5HE,7,19,I was able to move over my music, video files, and other docs I wanted access to and still have a good amount of space left.I also already use Dropbox and love it.
B008DWG5HE,7,20,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,7,21,I bought one and discover it wired without data SIM , I never saw even a note about that no sim card this really wired
B008DWG5HE,7,22,I also hope more apps will continue to appear to support the S-pen.So, here's a rundown of some features:I love that it had a micro SD expansion slot.
B008DWG5HE,7,23,Thinner and lighter than my old iPad 2, I prefer keeping it in a case to avoid any issues with dropping/dinging it.In terms of peripherals - You can use up to a 64GB micro SD card with this tablet, which is one of the reasons I went with the 16GB instead of 32GB version (check the price difference between the extra GB edition vs microSD pricing).
B008DWG5HE,7,24,Apps can only install on default memory*.
B008DWG5HE,8,0,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,8,1,WIFI ONLY.
B008DWG5HE,8,2,For those who wants to use this device to read.
B008DWG5HE,8,3,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,8,4,Good Device.
B008DWG5HE,8,5,It is useful but for those problems.
B008DWG5HE,8,6,It works great and can be used for games and help with his homework.
B008DWG5HE,8,7,This is a great device and very useful for teaching and other such tasks.
B008DWG5HE,8,8,Great in some ways.
B008DWG5HE,8,9,It's portable, fast and works well in a mobile environment.
B008DWG5HE,8,10,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,8,11,Web pages load quickly but not as quickly as other devices.
B008DWG5HE,8,12,So I didn't send it back.Great device love it my kids love it.great
B008DWG5HE,8,13,I like this device a lot.
B008DWG5HE,8,14,But if I use this device, I cannot see the character clearly.
B008DWG5HE,8,15,Web pages loading time is fast but not nearly as fast as my laptop.
B008DWG5HE,8,16,Like, but not in love yet.
B008DWG5HE,8,17,However, I will say that I have no problem reading small text on internet pages or on pdf files.
B008DWG5HE,8,18,I use this device to check Facebook, my e-mail, and do online searches.
B008DWG5HE,8,19,Just like the samsung galaxy 4 phone, love it, easy to use basics.
B008DWG5HE,8,20,MAJOR peeve:  This is a mobile device which most people are going to use as a web device.
B008DWG5HE,8,21,My girlfriend has taken video footage with her phone (an Apple phone, that she has never had a problem with she says) of this device freaking out for minutes on end.
B008DWG5HE,8,22,I loved it!!impressed with the speed and set up.
B008DWG5HE,8,23,All the ones I use can be tiled - Polaris office, s-note, the internet browser, the video player, and email.
B008DWG5HE,8,24,All webpages should be functional on mobile devices.
B008DWG5HE,9,0,The keyboard does not work well.
B008DWG5HE,9,1,It's very responsive and sublime to touch.
B008DWG5HE,9,2,Nice Unit.
B008DWG5HE,9,3,It is smooth, fast, nice looking, and has the S-Pen.
B008DWG5HE,9,4,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,9,5,I have not played with the S pen yet because I want to get a screen protector first.
B008DWG5HE,9,6,Please tell me you are working hard... Photoshop touch is nice but it ain't illustrator.I use Note pretty much indoors, so I am not in the position to tell people whether the screen is bright outside.
B008DWG5HE,9,7,The protector looks great (little glare), works fine with the S-pen, and wasn't too hard to get on without bubbles.
B008DWG5HE,9,8,It is easy to use, and the screen/display is great!
B008DWG5HE,9,9,Awesome screen allows for great graphics.
B008DWG5HE,9,10,Included S Pen does not have the eraser side seen in some online videos.Gaming - VERY GOOD - Frame rates are fantastic, touch and accelerometer responsiveness seem great.
B008DWG5HE,9,11,The S-pen is very good, much like the Surface Pro's pen, except it's at half the price.2.
B008DWG5HE,9,12,The display is nice and bright and the unit can be used even outside on a sunny day.
B008DWG5HE,9,13,Good tablet for 2012.
B008DWG5HE,9,14,Applying a matt screen protector affects the S-pen's functionality somewhat, making it less sensitive and creating a drag.
B008DWG5HE,9,15,I am actually typing this review on my tablet.
B008DWG5HE,9,16,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,9,17,It'd be great have a glass anti-glare display finish that does not affect the S-pen's functionality.4.
B008DWG5HE,9,18,It's portable, fast and works well in a mobile environment.
B008DWG5HE,9,19,The tablet itself is nice with some goodfeatures.
B008DWG5HE,9,20,Wacom penabled, the S Pen has "good enough" pressure sensitivity (probably on par with a Bamboo based on my own subjective feel/use) and is also great for note taking.
B008DWG5HE,9,21,The stylus is built in, a great help.It offers you the chance to make notes in your own writing, not type.
B008DWG5HE,9,22,I put the Mini-guard matte anti-glare screen protector on right out of the box so there would be minimal chance for dust and that worked really well.
B008DWG5HE,9,23,I wanted it for art -- I draw as a hobby, but haven't for years -- and the description of the S-Pen's sensitivity really made it sound like a perfect match.I'm afraid though that the pen sensitivity is nothing to write home about.
B008DWG5HE,9,24,Could have bought a laptop for 200 bucks that allows me to do that
B008DWG5HE,10,0,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,10,1,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,10,2,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,10,3,The tablet itself is sturdy, with great resolution.
B008DWG5HE,10,4,The 10 inch display is fine plus its size and weight.
B008DWG5HE,10,5,OK, let;s get it over with, the screen isn't as high resolution as the Apple, but it;s pretty good.
B008DWG5HE,10,6,So far, so good.
B008DWG5HE,10,7,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B008DWG5HE,10,8,- Stylus pen is good and easy to hold for average size hand.
B008DWG5HE,10,9,I wear glasses so its the right size for me, yet its small enough to fit in my tote.
B008DWG5HE,10,10,- Infrared and bluetooth are functioning well.
B008DWG5HE,10,11,Also, the body is smooth and slick, and until I had a case I found it hard to keep a firm hold on the device.-
B008DWG5HE,10,12,And it works as advertised.
B008DWG5HE,10,13,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,10,14,Overall it s a nice tablet plenty useful for reading and taking notes whichs is basically what i do most so far.
B008DWG5HE,10,15,Great ideas.
B008DWG5HE,10,16,Excellent Deal.
B008DWG5HE,10,17,Amazingly fast and responsive!
B008DWG5HE,10,18,As a desktop user, I began to get used to it and use it in my work as writer.
B008DWG5HE,10,19,It's only for S Note app.  - Multiscreen feature can only be used with few built-in apps.
B008DWG5HE,10,20,The Galaxy Note had some of the best and most consistently good reviews on the Internet, and given how much I loved and used my previous tablet, I decided to upgrade to the Galaxy.Good:- Lightweight- Good screen- Good sound- The S-Pen is nice, though I use it mostly in games and programs when the touch zones are too small for my fingers.
B008DWG5HE,10,21,(But, see my note below)Not so good:- I can feel the body flex when I hold it and I am not confident it would survive a serious fall (I once dropped my Xoom on concrete and it survived).
B008DWG5HE,10,22,I got this tablet because I'm an amateur artist and I wanted to get a device that was good to draw on as well as had basic laptop functionality to replace my old one so I'm not as tied to my PC.
B008DWG5HE,10,23,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,10,24,Poke around in S-note, see how you like the feel of the pen (though be aware it may have been abused and not work as well as it should.)Should
B008DWG5HE,11,0,Also, the Note 10.1 has no built in full size or mini USB or HDMI ports.
B008DWG5HE,11,1,Drawing lines, other shapes, handwriting, formula recognition and all are awesome.Cons - No USB or HDMI port.
B008DWG5HE,11,2,There should be a micro or mini USB port on the left side of the device (in landscape) so that it can be used in landscape or portrait while propped up on a stand.
B008DWG5HE,11,3,I liked having the expansion capabilities with micro SD card slot but the proprietary dock/USB port was a pain.
B008DWG5HE,11,4,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,11,5,Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such.
B008DWG5HE,11,6,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,11,7,Samsung does offer adapters that connect to the charging port--but that is an extra cost and an inconvience.
B008DWG5HE,11,8,I've found I don't use the extra ports all that much so it isn't a big deal for me.
B008DWG5HE,11,9,The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.
B008DWG5HE,11,10,Samsung's sPen enabled applications look nice enough and offer some nice capabilities like text, formula, and shape recognition.Other reviews have complained about the lack of ports, but you can buy an adapter to give you those ports.
B008DWG5HE,11,11,But I feel it is quite bright, usually I put 30-40 % of maximum brightness.What was the reason to use 30 pin adapter instead of using microUSB?
B008DWG5HE,11,12,- Camera is awesome under normal light.
B008DWG5HE,11,13,At this stage in the game I don't see the need for proprietary connectors.
B008DWG5HE,11,14,- Volume is good, even louder than my laptops.
B008DWG5HE,11,15,It's only for S Note app.  - Multiscreen feature can only be used with few built-in apps.
B008DWG5HE,11,16,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,11,17,Note 10.1, I got an additional cable... still not cool.Okay, I don't have to charge the Note that often so it is not too bad.
B008DWG5HE,11,18,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,11,19,Good device....needs a few improvements.
B008DWG5HE,11,20,Battery life.
B008DWG5HE,11,21,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,11,22,The OS was fast at first but as I added Apps it got slower and choppy.
B008DWG5HE,11,23,I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.
B008DWG5HE,11,24,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,12,0,Work and Home Companion.
B008DWG5HE,12,1,It is easy to conceive drone system for transporting package.
B008DWG5HE,12,2,Easy to personalize.
B008DWG5HE,12,3,Google needs to overhaul the Android OS to make pen/drawing/handwriting recognition integrated seamless throughout the ANdroid operating ssystem.Another quibble is the way the stylus is designed in the Galaxy Note.
B008DWG5HE,12,4,10.1 size gives me a larger screen for productivity but not so large that it becomes less portable.
B008DWG5HE,12,5,Nice product.
B008DWG5HE,12,6,This is  the only good thing about it.
B008DWG5HE,12,7,The Note 10.1 packs some impressive specs and features and makes the best case for a stylus yet.
B008DWG5HE,12,8,Good Device.
B008DWG5HE,12,9,This shortcoming is more an issue with Android.
B008DWG5HE,12,10,It is too thin and short (I understand this design choice since they want to keep the tablet as thin and light as possible, but it makes the stylus less natural as a pen).
B008DWG5HE,12,11,This made me favor the Android system, because it was more open.I did a LOT of research on tablets to see what fit my needs best, and I know there are even others that are more like a laptop, with a detachable keyboard, like the Transformer series.
B008DWG5HE,12,12,I think it's easy to use and has everything you need for anything you want.
B008DWG5HE,12,13,It is smooth, fast, nice looking, and has the S-Pen.
B008DWG5HE,12,14,Much lighter and smaller than a laptop and does most of what I need.
B008DWG5HE,12,15,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,12,16,Otherwise it's an excellent Android device.
B008DWG5HE,12,17,It is easy to use, and the screen/display is great!
B008DWG5HE,12,18,Samsung was on the path to great product until they started to make it exclusive to thier products!!
B008DWG5HE,12,19,I like this device a lot.
B008DWG5HE,12,20,The bottom of the stylus does not act as an eraser (I do not understand this omission) and worse yet, the cross section of the stylus is rectangular, rather than circular.
B008DWG5HE,12,21,However, I did try to set up the TV remote feature and for some reason it partly worked and then did not work at all.
B008DWG5HE,12,22,It's portable, fast and works well in a mobile environment.
B008DWG5HE,12,23,Just like the samsung galaxy 4 phone, love it, easy to use basics.
B008DWG5HE,12,24,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,13,0,Samsung was on the path to great product until they started to make it exclusive to thier products!!
B008DWG5HE,13,1,NOT HAPPY!!!! Got a defective product!
B008DWG5HE,13,2,bad service so far I have not received the goods since being purchased from the 15th of January  nnnn n.
B008DWG5HE,13,3,Nice product.
B008DWG5HE,13,4,Product is fine and I love Samsung products but seller gets 3 stars for product seal broken.
B008DWG5HE,13,5,I cannot begin to describe how helpful the dual-view is.
B008DWG5HE,13,6,Satisfied customer that I am with this purchase than BestBuy.
B008DWG5HE,13,7,Shipped on time and tablet was intact, exceptions were fine.
B008DWG5HE,13,8,I truly love my Samsung Galaxy and because I'm a droid girl, I would never consider Apple product.
B008DWG5HE,13,9,I do not own any Apple or Android products, so I wasn't tied to either company.
B008DWG5HE,13,10,Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs.
B008DWG5HE,13,11,I think it will be fine but Samsung always seems to have some quality issues which some of their great products which I just do not understand.
B008DWG5HE,13,12,I have purchased so many things through amazon over the last 7 or so years but this is my first review.
B008DWG5HE,13,13,Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned.
B008DWG5HE,13,14,I'm happy.
B008DWG5HE,13,15,There are a few glitches here and there, but overall it is a very good product.
B008DWG5HE,13,16,Samsung makes a great pad with excellent support.
B008DWG5HE,13,17,But I'll need to decide if I want to return this thing for a replacement or deal with Samsung Customer Service which I know will not be fun.*EDIT
B008DWG5HE,13,18,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B008DWG5HE,13,19,I'm sure time will cure that issue.
B008DWG5HE,13,20,Best tablet for students--much better than ipad for college productivity.
B008DWG5HE,13,21,But just because I don't care tor this great Samsung product doesn't mean you won't fall in love with it.
B008DWG5HE,13,22,Samsung blames the printer that has no problems with other android or even a ipad.
B008DWG5HE,13,23,I rated it 3 stars, because I am sure it's an ok product, but the one we got is a HUGE disappointment, especially coming from Samsung!!!I have already emailed the company that I bought it from, hopefully they step up and help me out, because a lot of money was paid for a dud product!
B008DWG5HE,13,24,Probably a good learning experience for me, but be forewarned if you're not really tech-savvy and wanting to venture into the tablet world....you won't get much help from Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,14,0,I have owned 2 other android tablets before this and this 1 is by far the best.
B008DWG5HE,14,1,Best Android tablet I have owned.
B008DWG5HE,14,2,No Flashplayer operation.....I wanted this instead of the Apple iPad...now its just like the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,14,3,I don't miss my iPhone at all, therefore, Im not missing out on the ipad.
B008DWG5HE,14,4,As Androids to, this is the best one.
B008DWG5HE,14,5,The handwriting app is good.
B008DWG5HE,14,6,It even has Microsoft Office for Android on it!
B008DWG5HE,14,7,LOVE IT, BUT.........
B008DWG5HE,14,8,Good Device.
B008DWG5HE,14,9,And I confess, I bought one of the first iPads when they came out, have upgraded every time since so am pretty much married to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,14,10,It has so much features I'm not done exploring it.
B008DWG5HE,14,11,Switching from one window to another merely requires a tap on the window you want to work in.
B008DWG5HE,14,12,I was torn between this and the Microsoft Surface Pro.
B008DWG5HE,14,13,Perfect tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,14,However, I am quite familiar to android OS on my phone.
B008DWG5HE,14,15,The iPad eventually took the place of the laptop due to ease of use and portability........well move over iPad.
B008DWG5HE,14,16,This function only seems to work in the sketching program.
B008DWG5HE,14,17,This was one advantage over the IPAD I greatly looked forward to, but Flash is not available on this device.*Update
B008DWG5HE,14,18,Of course runs on android.
B008DWG5HE,14,19,The iPad is nice, don't get me wrong.
B008DWG5HE,14,20,multiscreen works great, and hopefully Samsung will add more apps that are compatible with it.Personally,
B008DWG5HE,14,21,I truly love my Samsung Galaxy and because I'm a droid girl, I would never consider Apple product.
B008DWG5HE,14,22,Just like the samsung galaxy 4 phone, love it, easy to use basics.
B008DWG5HE,14,23,- I love note taking features.
B008DWG5HE,14,24,I recently switched from an iPhone to galaxy s4.
B008DWG5HE,15,0,One complaint is that the screen is VERY bright and I've not found a way to dim it.
B008DWG5HE,15,1,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,15,2,Yes, the iPad has a screen that is a bit more vibrant, but unless they are sitting side by side you will NOT notice the difference.
B008DWG5HE,15,3,Also, when  viewing dark  movie scenes, the screen appears washed out around the edges, with the upper left corner appearing orangeish, the lower right corner appearing bluish, and a whitish fringe appearing all around the edges.
B008DWG5HE,15,4,Thus, unless you are looking directly at a right angle to where the pen is touching the glass, the image on the screen does not appear where you expect it to appear.
B008DWG5HE,15,5,I really believe this tablet wont last at $500 for too long.The second big problem is the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,6,Screen rotation is a bit too sensitive.
B008DWG5HE,15,7,With the screen facing away from the sun, however, reflections of myself and the scenery behind me dominate the screen and make it difficult to read the text.
B008DWG5HE,15,8,With the sun shining directly on the screen, I can read it fine.
B008DWG5HE,15,9,Also, there is a gap between the surface of the glass (where the pen tip touches), and the screen below the glass where the image appears.
B008DWG5HE,15,10,It is bright and colors are vibrant.
B008DWG5HE,15,11,It does have quite a large bezel around the screen but oddly it makes it a bit easier to hold.
B008DWG5HE,15,12,When using the tablet outdoors in bright sunlight, I find that the screen is bright enough to read text comfortably providing it is positioned properly with respect to the sun.
B008DWG5HE,15,13,But movies with dark scenes, which seems to be most movies these days, are difficult to see except in a completely darkened room (all the lights off).
B008DWG5HE,15,14,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B008DWG5HE,15,15,There are articles online about adjusting the sensitivity but evidently I have the only pen that doesn't respond to adjustments.Samsung hasn't been interested in providing solutions to screen sensitivity along with the pen issues.
B008DWG5HE,15,16,However, the glossy display reflects badly.
B008DWG5HE,15,17,Animated features and movies with brightly lit scenes are ok.
B008DWG5HE,15,18,only did 4 stars for two reasons....disappointed that the camera is only 5 mega pixels and now & then when I'm using this I wish it could do something (can't remember what at the moment) that it doesn't do.Over all I'm really happy with this device.
B008DWG5HE,15,19,We`ve gone from black and white to 12" color TVs all the way to easily available 60" LED TVs....why would I want to revert to a 10" screen to watch movies etc....that`s what my 42" is for.
B008DWG5HE,15,20,And text does appear slightly blurry around the edges.
B008DWG5HE,15,21,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B008DWG5HE,15,22,If he moves it when that happens, the screen will straighten out for a bit and then go back to lines.
B008DWG5HE,15,23,I will not directly compare this tablet to an iPad because the pros and cons for each platform are dizzying.
B008DWG5HE,15,24,Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine.
B008DWG5HE,16,0,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,16,1,The problem with all tablets is app support.
B008DWG5HE,16,2,It does NOT have flash player nor can you download it from the app store.
B008DWG5HE,16,3,opening apps & navagating around the O/S- able to play the HD .mkv
B008DWG5HE,16,4,While downloading apps, the Google Play Store froze on the Asus, never on the Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,16,5,And, you are constantly getting reminders from Google Play to update all of those pre-installed apps that you never use.
B008DWG5HE,16,6,I`ve had to download Firefox for Android.
B008DWG5HE,16,7,When I got the device I expected to be able to have any 2 apps running at the same time, so I could watch Netflix while using IMDB, etc.  Thus far, I have only found one or two apps from the market that support the split screen function.-
B008DWG5HE,16,8,It's asking I download Adobe flash player.
B008DWG5HE,16,9,So no websites which use Java can work....and I believe this is on all Android devices.
B008DWG5HE,16,10,I was very disapointed when I found out I can'get on Amazon Video, etc.
B008DWG5HE,16,11,However, if you want to watch videos from any other source, for example; Amazon Prime, facebook videos, yahoo videos, etc. they can't be played due to the Adobe Flash being blocked.
B008DWG5HE,16,12,Flash does not work on this version.
B008DWG5HE,16,13,If I could put my apps (realcalc or some other graphing calculator) down there then maybe, but really, if I could turn off the mini app option I would.
B008DWG5HE,16,14,Secondly, given that this is an android device, one would expect google products to work seamlessly with it....nope...Chrome is quite frankly rubbish on this device.
B008DWG5HE,16,15,If you have a browser open and are downloading something, and have sNotes next to it, when you tap over to sNotes, the browser stops downloading.
B008DWG5HE,16,16,Even if you install printer share, it is hard to use and not all apps work with it.
B008DWG5HE,16,17,Does not support Adobe Flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,18,Many tablet cameras are doing 1080p video.Multitasking: Side-By-Side windowing works only with Samsung apps, and the concept doesn't work that well in execution since you can't interact with both windows simultaneously.
B008DWG5HE,16,19,All the time is spent making good apps for the ibad.
B008DWG5HE,16,20,No flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,21,It won't work unless you have a samsung printer!
B008DWG5HE,16,22,The multitasking is little more than samsung showing you 2 apps at once; you still can only really do one useful thing at once.
B008DWG5HE,16,23,However, I have noticed that there's an issue with flash player, so right now I'm not able to view video on sites that require flash player.
B008DWG5HE,16,24,Unfortunately, only selected apps will work in the multi-window system.
B008DWG5HE,17,0,if you purchase their products you are on your own after they get your money.
B008DWG5HE,17,1,I have purchased so many things through amazon over the last 7 or so years but this is my first review.
B008DWG5HE,17,2,I bought the Note after reading the many reviews here.
B008DWG5HE,17,3,I bought first one, during the trial, it freezes soon, So, I returned it and excanged with new one.
B008DWG5HE,17,4,Made my purchase in February and have had nothing but problems.
B008DWG5HE,17,5,Don't Buy Refurbished from this company.
B008DWG5HE,17,6,If I had to do it again, I would never make this purchase.
B008DWG5HE,17,7,I expected this product to last for at least a couple of years.
B008DWG5HE,17,8,My company spends 1000s of dollar in amazon purchasing.
B008DWG5HE,17,9,You could buy a large version of one of those for the same price as this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,17,10,It's one thing to crash, and another thing to crash ALL THE TIME and preventing you from using other apps and having a good experience.Save your money.
B008DWG5HE,17,11,However I was not expecting this from seller with high reviews.
B008DWG5HE,17,12,It still reboots randomly sometimes 3-4 times in a 30 min time frame.
B008DWG5HE,17,13,I'm sure time will cure that issue.
B008DWG5HE,17,14,It does seem to take a bit of time to charge fully.Is the tablet worth the money?
B008DWG5HE,17,15,The only downside is I have yet to find a really good protective case for the Note.
B008DWG5HE,17,16,Bought this for the wife and perhaps just my poor research and expectations but I would have expected that this would be able to do much of what a windows based tablet would do.
B008DWG5HE,17,17,First of all, this item has shipped 3 days after I actually placed order.Second, the item was defective!!!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,17,18,This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device.
B008DWG5HE,17,19,would not have bought knowing this.
B008DWG5HE,17,20,Save yourself the hassle and go into the store to purchase one.
B008DWG5HE,17,21,Like with anything else not Apple, the people you know will find some reason to think it's not as good as their beloved Apple.
B008DWG5HE,17,22,I honestly would have passed and bought something else.
B008DWG5HE,17,23,Verry disappointed!!
B008DWG5HE,17,24,This purchase was a mistake :(
B008DWG5HE,18,0,I was able assemble the adopter /battery charger.
B008DWG5HE,18,1,Had one before and the battery died.
B008DWG5HE,18,2,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B008DWG5HE,18,3,It doesn't stop even long enough for me to hold down the power key and turn the device off completely.I have researched everything, and can not find anything on why it is doing this, or how to fix it!
B008DWG5HE,18,4,I have to charge pretty much every other day and at times daily if I use it a lot.
B008DWG5HE,18,5,The first one wouldn't even turn on!
B008DWG5HE,18,6,It still reboots randomly sometimes 3-4 times in a 30 min time frame.
B008DWG5HE,18,7,See how long the battery lasts.
B008DWG5HE,18,8,Last week it went into a reboot mode and I could not get it to turn off.
B008DWG5HE,18,9,What a bummer on Christmas to open a gift that isn't charged and can't charge because it has the wrong charger.
B008DWG5HE,18,10,The shipment received on time.
B008DWG5HE,18,11,Bummed to have to buy a charger now when this one should be came with the correct charger.
B008DWG5HE,18,12,If you attempt to charge this tablet via your computer, the tablet will show the battery icon as not charging.
B008DWG5HE,18,13,But I am hoping the battery has long life.These are my opinions about the Note 10.1 from about a few week long usage.
B008DWG5HE,18,14,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,18,15,The packaging was sent with the wrong charger, it had the charger for the phone, not the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,18,16,The battery lasts forever & its light.
B008DWG5HE,18,17,Battery drain seems faster than iPad.
B008DWG5HE,18,18,I hope it won't ruin the connection over time and keep it from charging.The case I bought has an opening for the charger, so that you can put it in easel position.
B008DWG5HE,18,19,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,18,20,I don't remember having to recharge the iPad the same day regardless of usage.5.
B008DWG5HE,18,21,Wrong cable.
B008DWG5HE,18,22,I tried a "do it yourself repair that did not work and order a new device.
B008DWG5HE,18,23,The non-removable battery is annoying simply because batteries for these mobile devices just don't last more than a couple of years before losing charging capacity.-
B008DWG5HE,18,24,The Package did not have instructions for four loose components shipped (part of adopter or battery charger and some thing else).
B008DWG5HE,19,0,And the sound quality and volume were excellent.
B008DWG5HE,19,1,Speakers stereo separation is very good but the lower frequency sound is poor.6.
B008DWG5HE,19,2,However, I keep mine in the Samsung case (sold separately), so the build deficits aren't noticeable.Speakers:Placing stereo speakers at opposite edges of the screen facing forward is a great idea, except the speakers aren't loud enough and have a tinny sound.
B008DWG5HE,19,3,The audio became occasionally inoperative and the headphone jack would crackle when using my ear buds.
B008DWG5HE,19,4,I sometimes plug in some computer speakers and listen to music at work through it.
B008DWG5HE,19,5,I find myself having to use headphones when watching videos.
B008DWG5HE,19,6,I tried other buds thinking there might be an issue with them but it was a consistent result, especially when turning the jack in the port.
B008DWG5HE,19,7,I do think Samsung has the right idea about the speakers in the front, genius really!
B008DWG5HE,19,8,Other than that, it seems to be put together tightly, and it looks fine, it's just not as good as you would expect from a high end tablet.
B008DWG5HE,19,9,The plastic back does flex a little under your hands, and there is a creaking noise when you push down on the edges of the screen, or apply a slight twisting motion to the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,19,10,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,19,11,While the construction of mine was solid, all the other negative observations of other reviewers were immediately apparent.
B008DWG5HE,19,12,Videos, on the other hand, are a different matter.
B008DWG5HE,19,13,Not enough to slow you down, just enough to be visually noticeable.
B008DWG5HE,19,14,I have yet to see it freeze or get into a state that requires a reboot.
B008DWG5HE,19,15,The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time.
B008DWG5HE,19,16,I tried a couple of them, some are okay, but most of just noise.
B008DWG5HE,19,17,Build quality is top notch.
B008DWG5HE,19,18,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,19,19,multiscreen works great, and hopefully Samsung will add more apps that are compatible with it.Personally,
B008DWG5HE,19,20,It still reboots randomly sometimes 3-4 times in a 30 min time frame.
B008DWG5HE,19,21,I eventually sold it as I was rarely using it.
B008DWG5HE,19,22,Our 4-year-old watches videos on this and, with the case we have, it's not possible to stand the tablet up for watching while it's plugged in.
B008DWG5HE,19,23,I will, however, note that the utter lack of external ports is disappointing.
B008DWG5HE,19,24,S Note is the highlight of the unit and the reason I bought the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,0,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,1,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,2,It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something.
B008DWG5HE,20,3,While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.
B008DWG5HE,20,4,The only reason I have this four stars was that the camera sometimes does not focus well if you are taking a photo of a room.
B008DWG5HE,20,5,The lack of that last star is for slight difference in screen quality.
B008DWG5HE,20,6,Because of the many features it has also almost replaced my digital camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,7,I am very happy w all the camera options that are also offered on the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,8,Video chatting works great as well.
B008DWG5HE,20,9,My opinion remains unchanged, SAVE your money and buy the Samsung Galaxy 2 tablet unless you will use the stylus and autofocus rear camera of the Samsung Galaxy NOTE.
B008DWG5HE,20,10,It has the weaknesses of most regular range digital cameras with low light, indoors, and motion.
B008DWG5HE,20,11,I believe that Asus must work out a lot of bugs in their infinity before it is worthwhile!Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,12,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,20,13,Does the auto spelling correct work well for you?
B008DWG5HE,20,14,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B008DWG5HE,20,15,In MY opinion, not worth the price over the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 Tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,16,is one drawback which, to me is quite problematic and could become huge over time.
B008DWG5HE,20,17,Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine.
B008DWG5HE,20,18,All the time is spent making good apps for the ibad.
B008DWG5HE,20,19,But at $500, that is a slap in the face.
B008DWG5HE,20,20,My point is just this, for $500, which what HIGH END tablets are going for, I would expect a little better.
B008DWG5HE,20,21,Too bad they don't work in multiscreen because this is a samsung hack.
B008DWG5HE,20,22,I look forward to a Note 2 when the time comes, though I don't think it will be soon.
B008DWG5HE,20,23,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B008DWG5HE,20,24,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,21,0,I did a hard set twice and it came back as fast as new but it would slow again as I added Apps back in.
B008DWG5HE,21,1,The old tablet had its issues with freezing up after the last update along with not enough ram.
B008DWG5HE,21,2,Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.
B008DWG5HE,21,3,I think the processor is fine and speedy.
B008DWG5HE,21,4,The UI seems okay and pretty responsive so no complaints there.
B008DWG5HE,21,5,The OS was fast at first but as I added Apps it got slower and choppy.
B008DWG5HE,21,6,The note 2 10.1 has twice the ram as the tab model.
B008DWG5HE,21,7,If you are expecting to use it to take notes, be prepared to be disappointed.
B008DWG5HE,21,8,And I confess, I bought one of the first iPads when they came out, have upgraded every time since so am pretty much married to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,21,9,Fast, however, while faster than my old Xoom I have to say the difference is not all that noticeable.
B008DWG5HE,21,10,I upgraded to the note 2 10.1 from the tab 2 10.1 as my previous tablet was damaged beyond repair.
B008DWG5HE,21,11,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,21,12,slow wifi on the note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,21,13,I purchased the iPad 2 when it was released and owned that for about 10 months before it fell and the screen cracked.
B008DWG5HE,21,14,Samsung blames the printer that has no problems with other android or even a ipad.
B008DWG5HE,21,15,Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 Should have been great....
B008DWG5HE,21,16,Still feels a bit plasticy, not as nice as ipad.Software - Everything seems to run without any hiccups, more polished and less buggy than what I've seen on Asus tablets.Let me know if there are any other aspects you'd like to get feedback on to help you make your decision on this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,21,17,Samsung uses Kies as its sync program.
B008DWG5HE,21,18,Disappointed with Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,21,19,Lots and lots of problems !!!!
B008DWG5HE,21,20,It still reboots randomly sometimes 3-4 times in a 30 min time frame.
B008DWG5HE,21,21,If you are playing a game the battery goes low way to quick.
B008DWG5HE,21,22,In the end, I think it was samsung that ruined it for me and I just feel this tablet is a little gimmicky.For the money I expected a better app experience from samsung.
B008DWG5HE,21,23,I need a few apps that work, not 20 where half of them are crap and the other half half work with one or two stand outs.
B008DWG5HE,21,24,I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,22,0,SD card slot usles.
B008DWG5HE,22,1,The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,2,I bought this 16G tablet and installed a 16G SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,3,While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-
B008DWG5HE,22,4,Warning... Samsung tablets and phones do not allow you to store apps in the SD memory.
B008DWG5HE,22,5,I bought this partly because of the sd card slot.According to Samsung you can't run apps from it and they can't store their data there.
B008DWG5HE,22,6,SD card not properly used.
B008DWG5HE,22,7,You cannot use Apps2SD, for example, to move apps from the Note's built-in memory to an external SD card without *rooting the device.
B008DWG5HE,22,8,I have a cheap 7" non Samsung tablet and I can move apps as I want.
B008DWG5HE,22,9,It seems reasonable that it is the user who should determine if speed or memory space is more important.
B008DWG5HE,22,10,Apps can only install on default memory*.
B008DWG5HE,22,11,I used 10% of the available 11 GB for only 4issues of PC world's enhanced additions.
B008DWG5HE,22,12,So if you want the note go for 32GB or you'll be sorry.
B008DWG5HE,22,13,This was a major concern as the tablet could accept a 64gb micro SD card for expansion and would lend itself to installing more apps in the future.
B008DWG5HE,22,14,Samsung told me that the reason they want apps on the main memory is for speed of access.
B008DWG5HE,22,15,Samsung's answer to my complaint was to tell me to delete some apps.
B008DWG5HE,22,16,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,17,All you can put there are pictures, music, etc.
B008DWG5HE,22,18,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,19,The Android system permits it.
B008DWG5HE,22,20,I did not know this and now it has become a real problem.
B008DWG5HE,22,21,Now I find out too late that Samsung is worse.
B008DWG5HE,22,22,you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory?
B008DWG5HE,22,23,I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.
B008DWG5HE,22,24,If I could put my apps (realcalc or some other graphing calculator) down there then maybe, but really, if I could turn off the mini app option I would.
B008DWG5HE,23,0,I really liked note 10.1 until I connected to wifi.
B008DWG5HE,23,1,I don't really need wifi that much and use the note to take notes, and would rather not have to back everything up again, so I'm going without the wifi.
B008DWG5HE,23,2,WiFi suddenly doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,23,3,slow wifi on the note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,23,4,This would be ok if it fixed the problem but it didn't.
B008DWG5HE,23,5,Pleade do a google search for slow wifi on the note 10.1.Tim
B008DWG5HE,23,6,Same problem still.
B008DWG5HE,23,7,Sync Problems.
B008DWG5HE,23,8,It says in the settings that it's connected to the school network, but when I try to access the internet, it doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,23,9,Has some issues.
B008DWG5HE,23,10,Lots and lots of problems !!!!
B008DWG5HE,23,11,It is useful but for those problems.
B008DWG5HE,23,12,It still reboots randomly sometimes 3-4 times in a 30 min time frame.
B008DWG5HE,23,13,I've had continual problems with Kies.
B008DWG5HE,23,14,but it occurs the same problem.
B008DWG5HE,23,15,I don't know if the problem is with the device, android OS, the school network or any combination of the three but the problem is that since this device isn't as popular as the iPad, the problem isn't going to be solved anytime soon.So if you need reliable access to wifi, this device may not be for you.
B008DWG5HE,23,16,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,23,17,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,23,18,MAJOR peeve:  This is a mobile device which most people are going to use as a web device.
B008DWG5HE,23,19,I thought that something that I had installed was causing the problem.
B008DWG5HE,23,20,Made my purchase in February and have had nothing but problems.
B008DWG5HE,23,21,Keeps freezing and then randomly rebooting.
B008DWG5HE,23,22,I've had this for a couple of months, but from about 2 weeks ago, the wifi stopped working on my school network.
B008DWG5HE,23,23,Secondly, given that this is an android device, one would expect google products to work seamlessly with it....nope...Chrome is quite frankly rubbish on this device.
B008DWG5HE,23,24,For the connection to be on the bottom is COMPLETELY impractical, as you have to lie the unit down to use any of your connections.
B008DWG5HE,24,0,Everything on screen is still visible, just no touch function at all with either finger or pen.
B008DWG5HE,24,1,However, the potentiometer was very sensitive and at first I over adjusted so that the pen was writing on the screen when it wasn't even touching the glass.
B008DWG5HE,24,2,We can't do anything on it, we can't even get to the home screen without it going nuts.
B008DWG5HE,24,3,The continual problems I have had with the note is that the left side of the touch screen lacks sensitivity when using the virtual keyboard.
B008DWG5HE,24,4,I was stumped about the "pen".
B008DWG5HE,24,5,You can work with any bluetooth keyboard as I understand it, though I've not done so yet.
B008DWG5HE,24,6,Turned out the pen was attached onto the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,24,7,There are times when you press a button or select something with the pen and it does not register, and you have to press a second time.-
B008DWG5HE,24,8,The Kensington keyboard that I use with my Note does not pair with it perfectly and supplies strange letters from other languages from time to time.
B008DWG5HE,24,9,Also, there is a slight lag time between the pen motion and the appearance of the image on the screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,10,Every time you pause, and start writing again, it starts a new text box.
B008DWG5HE,24,11,I am a avid typer (can you tell by the length of my article?), but for typing I was satisfied with using the touch screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,12,Well, I have been able to use it effectively in this manner, but I have found that the S-pen is rather tricky to use and takes some getting used to.The S-pen:The first thing I noticed when trying to write with the s-pen out of the box is that I had to press too hard on the screen to make it write.
B008DWG5HE,24,13,I discovered that writing with the pen is very different, and considerably more difficult, than writing with a pen on paper.
B008DWG5HE,24,14,Also, there is a gap between the surface of the glass (where the pen tip touches), and the screen below the glass where the image appears.
B008DWG5HE,24,15,The screen is slippery, so more control over pen movement is required than when writing on paper.
B008DWG5HE,24,16,The only thing that I was mad abt is.that the sticker on the box was opened but the product itself seemed un touched.
B008DWG5HE,24,17,You resume writing, "accuracy".
B008DWG5HE,24,18,This has been a five-star product until...Today, I just tried pulling out the pen and the touch panel seemed to go dead.
B008DWG5HE,24,19,I have changed tips from the rubber tip to the hard nylon type tip due to the rubber tip wearing out.
B008DWG5HE,24,20,If you hand write a few words and then pause, the handwriting is converted to text.
B008DWG5HE,24,21,This is a pain when your typing and find out autocorrect won't predict words correctly because it didn't sense you touching the letter selected.Moving on to the S pen.
B008DWG5HE,24,22,Lastly, even with touch input turned off, so only the pen will write on the page, the motion of the side of your hand on the screen will occasionally cause the page to move around or inadvertently zoom in or out.These problems were enough to cause me to consider returning the tablet when I first tried it.
B008DWG5HE,24,23,For example, I would like to hand write a whole page and then let the app convert the whole page to text at once.
B008DWG5HE,24,24,I hate virtual keyboards.
B008DWG5HE,25,0,That is one thing the ipad seems to have over Samsung is the devices seem a little more resistant to trauma.
B008DWG5HE,25,1,Wish I would have gone with the I-Pad.
B008DWG5HE,25,2,This device runs Android 2.3.
B008DWG5HE,25,3,This is a great device, however I feel Samsung was deceptive in that there was NO mention of it's provided App's only printing to Samsung printers.
B008DWG5HE,25,4,iPad is a much better device.
B008DWG5HE,25,5,Samsung blames the printer that has no problems with other android or even a ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,6,This shortcoming is more an issue with Android.
B008DWG5HE,25,7,I need to do more than a few things at once and I need all of my features at the same time.
B008DWG5HE,25,8,Blows the iPad AND Nexus 7 away.
B008DWG5HE,25,9,Too bad they don't work in multiscreen because this is a samsung hack.
B008DWG5HE,25,10,The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time.
B008DWG5HE,25,11,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,25,12,Admittedly a Samsung fan-boy, but apps and pen make it both a fun and productive device.
B008DWG5HE,25,13,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B008DWG5HE,25,14,In the end, I think it was samsung that ruined it for me and I just feel this tablet is a little gimmicky.For the money I expected a better app experience from samsung.
B008DWG5HE,25,15,So no websites which use Java can work....and I believe this is on all Android devices.
B008DWG5HE,25,16,Disappointed with Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,17,The keyboard does not work well.
B008DWG5HE,25,18,Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,25,19,Otherwise it's an excellent Android device.
B008DWG5HE,25,20,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,25,21,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B008DWG5HE,25,22,I wanted a tablet that had a 10.1" screen, could play HD .mkv
B008DWG5HE,25,23,Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 Should have been great....
B008DWG5HE,25,24,I am a writer and love to feel the flow of pen and pencil and the S Pen does it for me.
B008DWG5HE,26,0,Minus another for that port being for a proprietary power plug.
B008DWG5HE,26,1,Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such.
B008DWG5HE,26,2,However the lack of a HDMI or USB port hampers its versatility.
B008DWG5HE,26,3,I will, however, note that the utter lack of external ports is disappointing.
B008DWG5HE,26,4,I like the Lightning port better than the old 30 pin connector but still, proprietary?
B008DWG5HE,26,5,Very nice performance, disappointed by the lack of ports.
B008DWG5HE,26,6,Note 10.1, I got an additional cable... still not cool.Okay, I don't have to charge the Note that often so it is not too bad.
B008DWG5HE,26,7,To plug a flash/thumb drive directly into the Note 10.1 you have to buy a adapter.
B008DWG5HE,26,8,But unless Samsung starts making more pragmatic devices, I'm going to look somewhere else.In short - minus one star for only one port.
B008DWG5HE,26,9,The cable gets mashed on the bottom of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,26,10,Also the wireless connectivity to the dongle is fragile.
B008DWG5HE,26,11,For anyone who hates typing or finds it slow, this will be worth it's weight in gold.Has a mini usb port.
B008DWG5HE,26,12,I love the USB connectivity, but the location is terrible.
B008DWG5HE,26,13,It would be much better with those ports available on the device instead of the fragile connector which sometimes doesn't work.I look forward to an improvement in that area.
B008DWG5HE,26,14,My main contention hardware-wise is the location of the port, and the fact that it`s a Samsung-proprietary rip off of the iPad port, plus its location.
B008DWG5HE,26,15,Flash not supported.
B008DWG5HE,26,16,At this stage in the game I don't see the need for proprietary connectors.
B008DWG5HE,26,17,You can work with any bluetooth keyboard as I understand it, though I've not done so yet.
B008DWG5HE,26,18,I have about dozen microUSB cables in my house and my office, I could just use any of these as I do for my phone.
B008DWG5HE,26,19,I ended up buying an iPad 4 and my complaint is the same for Apple.
B008DWG5HE,26,20,Our 4-year-old watches videos on this and, with the case we have, it's not possible to stand the tablet up for watching while it's plugged in.
B008DWG5HE,26,21,Proprietary interface to charge, seriously not cool.
B008DWG5HE,26,22,I just hate using laptop during meetings - the clicking sound from keyboard just distracts everyone and sometimes it can be quite annoying.
B008DWG5HE,26,23,No regrets, but I hate it whenever I have to find the specific cable.
B008DWG5HE,26,24,Stick to the phones.
B008DWG5HE,27,0,I bought first one, during the trial, it freezes soon, So, I returned it and excanged with new one.
B008DWG5HE,27,1,It freezes too often.
B008DWG5HE,27,2,It freezes too often.
B008DWG5HE,27,3,I have had it for a week now, and still no crash.
B008DWG5HE,27,4,A month in, it keeps crashing.
B008DWG5HE,27,5,So, I decieded returning it as well.
B008DWG5HE,27,6,It still reboots randomly sometimes 3-4 times in a 30 min time frame.
B008DWG5HE,27,7,The Android system permits it.
B008DWG5HE,27,8,If the underlying operating system is not designed with the ability to do a thing then you can be assured you will not be completely happy with a hack like this.
B008DWG5HE,27,9,Even when I am doing so many things on this.
B008DWG5HE,27,10,Verry disappointed!!
B008DWG5HE,27,11,Keeps freezing and then randomly rebooting.
B008DWG5HE,27,12,Pull up maps, circle locations, go split screen and make notes, Like all of Samsung's other products, a winner.
B008DWG5HE,27,13,but it occurs the same problem.
B008DWG5HE,27,14,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,27,15,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,27,16,I tried a "do it yourself repair that did not work and order a new device.
B008DWG5HE,27,17,It locks up and the formatting is ridiculous.
B008DWG5HE,27,18,Secondly, given that this is an android device, one would expect google products to work seamlessly with it....nope...Chrome is quite frankly rubbish on this device.
B008DWG5HE,27,19,It took 2 weeks for repairs.
B008DWG5HE,27,20,Samsung was on the path to great product until they started to make it exclusive to thier products!!
B008DWG5HE,27,21,I do like the new styllus abilities as well as the opportunity to multi screen.
B008DWG5HE,27,22,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,27,23,Pleade do a google search for slow wifi on the note 10.1.Tim
B008DWG5HE,27,24,Worst investment I made.
B008DWG5HE,28,0,It took 2 weeks for repairs.
B008DWG5HE,28,1,Tried discussing with Samsung support and they were no help.
B008DWG5HE,28,2,According to Samsung customer service it wont be unblocked any time soon.
B008DWG5HE,28,3,The shipment received on time.
B008DWG5HE,28,4,Poor Inspection process and Bypassing Customer Service responsbility.
B008DWG5HE,28,5,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,28,6,Samsung's customer service experience.
B008DWG5HE,28,7,Samsung customer service is horrible.
B008DWG5HE,28,8,They said to return it back to sam's club, sam's club says to contact Samsung instead.
B008DWG5HE,28,9,Called customer support and they had me reset it to factory settings.
B008DWG5HE,28,10,I tried a "do it yourself repair that did not work and order a new device.
B008DWG5HE,28,11,People talk about having to call into Samsung support over and over and over again, the flippant attitudes of the support people, and the unwillingness for Samsung to stand behind their product and provide a new unit when it's obvious a unit is defective.For the complete lack of customer support and poor quality/design, I will not be buying ANY Samsung tablet.
B008DWG5HE,28,12,First of all, this item has shipped 3 days after I actually placed order.Second, the item was defective!!!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,28,13,I wanted to send this unit back to Amazon.com but Samsung has held up the progress because of the adapter and my 30 days  return warranty has expired with Amazon.I would have never had this problem with Apple.
B008DWG5HE,28,14,If Amazon is selling a product, I expect Amazon customer service to provide the required service.
B008DWG5HE,28,15,Immediately notified Amazon.
B008DWG5HE,28,16,Amazon responded promptly to contact Samsung Website.
B008DWG5HE,28,17,contacted and was told that its new and not refurbished item.
B008DWG5HE,28,18,Worst customer service I've ever experienced from a conglomerate electronics company.I ordered the Galaxy note 10.1 on 3/23/13 shipping and services from Amazon.com was  Superb!!!When I received my unit there was some issues so I opted to send it to Samsung for service, turns out the adapter was faulty and the battery inside of the galaxy note needed to be replaced.
B008DWG5HE,28,19,If I bought the product from Amazon, why do I have to contact the maufacturer's Website.
B008DWG5HE,28,20,Thanks, Samsung, for being the first company to really acknowledge the creative community and get together with Wacom.Is this going to replace a full fledged cintiq or intuos tablet?
B008DWG5HE,28,21,As a result I would not reccomend Samsung products nor will I be purchasing any in the future.
B008DWG5HE,28,22,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B008DWG5HE,28,23,I just wanted to try this as a last ditch effort, but still dead touch panel problems.I'm convinced to send it back to Amazon now.
B008DWG5HE,28,24,Why support a company who treats consumers this way?
B008DWG5HE,29,0,If he moves it when that happens, the screen will straighten out for a bit and then go back to lines.
B008DWG5HE,29,1,However lately when he moves it a certain way the screen gets lines across it and is unreadable.
B008DWG5HE,29,2,Instead, if you want to make a window disappear from the screen, you have to close the app appearing in the window.
B008DWG5HE,29,3,I am also disappointed that you can't shrink windows down to a single bar at the bottom of the screen like you can in Microsoft Windows for PC.
B008DWG5HE,29,4,Great idea, LOTS OF BUGS.
B008DWG5HE,29,5,6 months later there are issues.
B008DWG5HE,29,6,Satisfied.
B008DWG5HE,29,7,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,29,8,At first, I was extremely satisfied.
B008DWG5HE,29,9,Keeps freezing and then randomly rebooting.
B008DWG5HE,29,10,A month in, it keeps crashing.
B008DWG5HE,29,11,It still reboots randomly sometimes 3-4 times in a 30 min time frame.
B008DWG5HE,29,12,Unfortunately, only selected apps will work in the multi-window system.
B008DWG5HE,29,13,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,29,14,Lots and lots of problems !!!!
B008DWG5HE,29,15,Switching from one window to another merely requires a tap on the window you want to work in.
B008DWG5HE,29,16,Through trial and error, I was able to get the setting to where I wanted it.Next,
B008DWG5HE,29,17,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,29,18,It will automatically tile two windows side-by-side, and you can adjust the proportion of the screen that each inhabits.
B008DWG5HE,29,19,I have yet to see it freeze or get into a state that requires a reboot.
B008DWG5HE,29,20,Anyone else had similar experience with their note 10.1.?
B008DWG5HE,29,21,I tried a "do it yourself repair that did not work and order a new device.
B008DWG5HE,29,22,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,29,23,The plastic screeches and groans.One of previous actual "exceptional" devices  I owned was the touch pad, which had a plastic back.
B008DWG5HE,29,24,I need a few apps that work, not 20 where half of them are crap and the other half half work with one or two stand outs.

B00CYQPM42,1,0,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,1,1,There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation.
B00CYQPM42,1,2,Not enough apps.
B00CYQPM42,1,3,Does not do Google plus and most apps...
B00CYQPM42,1,4,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,1,5,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,1,6,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,1,7,The only downfall is no Google play store access.
B00CYQPM42,1,8,not playing videos.
B00CYQPM42,1,9,With an Android device, you can access the Amazon Android store, but with a Kindle Fire, you cannot access the Google Play store.
B00CYQPM42,1,10,Amazon you need to fix your App store
B00CYQPM42,1,11,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,1,12,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,1,13,I'm a news junkie and most of my news apps were available.
B00CYQPM42,1,14,Right now, there are about 1 million Android apps, and on the Kindle you can only get about 10% of them.I know some people think "10% of 1 million apps is still 100,000 apps which is plenty."
B00CYQPM42,1,15,Can't play POGO games on it so it is worthless to me.
B00CYQPM42,1,16,The Kindle HDX is great for Netflix and Amazon prime.
B00CYQPM42,1,17,But if you want a tablet that has unrestricted access to every app out there, you'll have to look elsewhere.
B00CYQPM42,1,18,They do not play.
B00CYQPM42,1,19,There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX.
B00CYQPM42,1,20,I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet.
B00CYQPM42,1,21,I have found many useful lifestyle apps (food diaries, calorie counters, etc).
B00CYQPM42,1,22,Although the Amazon appstore is still dwarfed by Google Play, Amazon's vast media library of books and magazines, videos, and music more than makes up for fewer apps, at least for me.
B00CYQPM42,1,23,Kindle Fire HDX.
B00CYQPM42,1,24,Great Kindle Fire....
B00CYQPM42,2,0,Got it at a great price
B00CYQPM42,2,1,Great for the price.
B00CYQPM42,2,2,Great!

B00CYQPM42,2,11,Love It!! What a great device!!
B00CYQPM42,2,12,A great little tablet.
B00CYQPM42,2,13,Otherwise this product is great!
B00CYQPM42,2,14,The best part for me is I got them at a fantastic price on Cyber-Monday!!!!! :)
B00CYQPM42,2,15,I highly recommend this tablet as a best buy of exceptional quality.
B00CYQPM42,2,16,A great deal for the price.-
B00CYQPM42,2,17,Great value!
B00CYQPM42,2,18,great gift.
B00CYQPM42,2,19,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,2,20,For the price you can't beat it.
B00CYQPM42,2,21,Great Gift.
B00CYQPM42,2,22,the price is a bit high might have to go with adifferent tablet all together.
B00CYQPM42,2,23,It was the best buy of the year.
B00CYQPM42,2,24,I would highly recommend this tablet!!
B00CYQPM42,3,0,Battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,1,battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,2,aweful battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,3,Battery life is pretty good.
B00CYQPM42,3,4,Already went threw the hints on how to save battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,5,Everything works great, but the battery life is not nearly as long as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,3,6,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,7,Battery life is great so far.-
B00CYQPM42,3,8,Battery life is not as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,3,9,battery doesn't last.
B00CYQPM42,3,10,Battery life is ok - probably need to recharge every other day with normal use.
B00CYQPM42,3,11,Not to happy with the battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,12,Seems battery doesn't last as long as first kindle.
B00CYQPM42,3,13,The lousy battery life is my main complaint, however.
B00CYQPM42,3,14,Really good.
B00CYQPM42,3,15,Light weightBattery life is over 10 hours.
B00CYQPM42,3,16,My previous kindle charged quickly even in use and had an amazing battery life!
B00CYQPM42,3,17,Have to charge it almost every day.
B00CYQPM42,3,18,Nice, but does not hold a charge long enough.
B00CYQPM42,3,19,I expected the battery to last much longer.
B00CYQPM42,3,20,Not as good.
B00CYQPM42,3,21,So far I can use my Kindle for two full days and not have my battery run down.
B00CYQPM42,3,22,The battery life is ok, but not as good as my larger iPad by far.
B00CYQPM42,3,23,One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge.
B00CYQPM42,3,24,Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours.
B00CYQPM42,4,0,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,1,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,4,2,Sound is really good (not home theater quality or anything) but better than any phone I've heard.
B00CYQPM42,4,3,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,4,4,This feels really good in your hand and the screen is BEAUTIFUL.
B00CYQPM42,4,5,The sound is also much better and louder.
B00CYQPM42,4,6,The screen is fantastic and the speakers produce great sound that is fairly loud.
B00CYQPM42,4,7,found the speakers to have decent sound.
B00CYQPM42,4,8,The sound quality is also top notch.
B00CYQPM42,4,9,The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.
B00CYQPM42,4,10,- I imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers.
B00CYQPM42,4,11,the audio books sound very good
B00CYQPM42,4,12,The sound while listening to audiobooks and movies is very good.
B00CYQPM42,4,13,And the sound!
B00CYQPM42,4,14,It sounds a tad more fuller than my Sony Xperia Tablet Z, but iPad 4 is still much better and sounds louder.
B00CYQPM42,4,15,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,4,16,The good and the bad.
B00CYQPM42,4,17,I can actually sense a better surround sound effect in videos that support this.I find that the speaker sound is actually pretty good the more I use it.
B00CYQPM42,4,18,It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers.
B00CYQPM42,4,19,Quite decent quality.720P
B00CYQPM42,4,20,Surround sound is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,4,21,The screen resolution is fantastic.
B00CYQPM42,4,22,The build quality is solid and the WiFi reception and streaming is impressive.
B00CYQPM42,4,23,awesome better than expected.
B00CYQPM42,4,24,sound is phenomenal, especially for such a little device.
B00CYQPM42,5,0,that isn't really a camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,1,I did not like the way the camera was.
B00CYQPM42,5,2,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,3,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,4,It could only be more perfect if it had a front facing camera!
B00CYQPM42,5,5,The picture quality is absurd.
B00CYQPM42,5,6,Works great.
B00CYQPM42,5,7,Picture is clear, color is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,8,I also don't like the front only camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,9,My only love about it is the camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,10,Clear picture, quality sound.
B00CYQPM42,5,11,Very easy to use and the picture quality is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,5,12,Very good better than what a t I expected.The only thing is the camera it only have front and not back.But I guess that's why it have the kindle hdx8.9 cause that have both.
B00CYQPM42,5,13,The camera could be a little better, but very nice to be able to Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,14,don't need a picture of my ugly mug looking at my kindle.
B00CYQPM42,5,15,....and I love the colors and depth to the pictures.
B00CYQPM42,5,16,VERY GOOD! Love this thing...........except the camera is on the WRONG side.
B00CYQPM42,5,17,Image is very good.
B00CYQPM42,5,18,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,5,19,The picture quality is awesome and I love playing games on it.
B00CYQPM42,5,20,The picture is awesome, it's super fast and it's just so pretty.
B00CYQPM42,5,21,As for the rest, the screen is very sharp, and colors are great.
B00CYQPM42,5,22,better picture and the sound is amazing!
B00CYQPM42,5,23,It's very hard to take a decent picture with it because you can't see what you're focusing on.
B00CYQPM42,5,24,You need a camera for Skype or other video app.-
B00CYQPM42,6,0,Fast, very fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,1,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,6,2,Great value!
B00CYQPM42,6,3,The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD.
B00CYQPM42,6,4,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,6,5,The screen on the HDX is amazing.
B00CYQPM42,6,6,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,6,7,The processor is amazingly fast and the graphics engine is top of the line.
B00CYQPM42,6,8,This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class.
B00CYQPM42,6,9,Great tablet!
B00CYQPM42,6,10,Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.
B00CYQPM42,6,11,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,6,12,The processor, it is very fast and loads pages quickly, and the 2 gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance.2.
B00CYQPM42,6,13,Even browsing with the HDX feels great.
B00CYQPM42,6,14,Compared to a nexus 7 which is the same price, the HDX seems to have a slower processor.
B00CYQPM42,6,15,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,6,16,Some apps I really enjoy on my android nexus 5 I can't get on the HDX without sideloading.
B00CYQPM42,6,17,It comes with a 2.2GHz quad-core processor, which is the standard in the latest tablets.
B00CYQPM42,6,18,The Silk browser on the HD wasn't responsive enough.
B00CYQPM42,6,19,I like how much faster the processor and Wi-Fi are too!
B00CYQPM42,6,20,The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory.
B00CYQPM42,6,21,The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon.
B00CYQPM42,6,22,Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The
B00CYQPM42,6,23,very nice apps, the resolution and sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,6,24,Graphics are great.
B00CYQPM42,7,0,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,7,1,However, this tablet is so much faster and with the 64 GB of storage I can do so much more.
B00CYQPM42,7,2,No mutlitasking, need QNX blackberry or Palm Pre cards layout.
B00CYQPM42,7,3,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,7,4,The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB.
B00CYQPM42,7,5,MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229.
B00CYQPM42,7,6,Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover.
B00CYQPM42,7,7,vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video.
B00CYQPM42,7,8,Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB
B00CYQPM42,7,9,too many slot pop ups.
B00CYQPM42,7,10,GB) of storage per hour.
B00CYQPM42,7,11,64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB.
B00CYQPM42,7,12,In this day and age, a table ought to have a Micro SD memory card slot for expansion, and an HDMI connector - ESPECIALLY a media tablet like these!
B00CYQPM42,7,13,This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size.
B00CYQPM42,7,14,So multiply the hours above by 5 to get an estimate of the maximum number of hours of SD videos you can download.
B00CYQPM42,7,15,To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80.
B00CYQPM42,7,16,To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40.
B00CYQPM42,7,17,This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,7,18,About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download.
B00CYQPM42,7,19,I realize that other HD videos may be a little more or less GB per hour, but using 1.7 GB per hour as a rough guide, here is the maximum amount of HD video you can download:16GB  (10.9GB available) - 6.4 hours32GB  (25.1GB available) - 14.7 hours64GB  (53.7GB available) - 31.5 hoursThe worst standard definition videos I found took up 330MB (which is .33
B00CYQPM42,7,20,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,7,21,If you're not sold on the reigning king of the tablet space, this is a good option for most users.
B00CYQPM42,7,22,Not all the daily free apps are very good, but some are.
B00CYQPM42,7,23,Download your young kid's videos in SD and save some space.
B00CYQPM42,7,24,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,8,0,I know they are working on it , but not fixed yet.
B00CYQPM42,8,1,Love It!! What a great device!!
B00CYQPM42,8,2,Good device.
B00CYQPM42,8,3,I am having problems with the WiFi hookup on occasion, but I'm sure there is an explanation for it.
B00CYQPM42,8,4,Great for watching movies and surfing the web.
B00CYQPM42,8,5,Web cripple.
B00CYQPM42,8,6,I do however have problems reading and watching movies while out in the sun.
B00CYQPM42,8,7,Email, Internet and books...what more does a girl need working on the road!
B00CYQPM42,8,8,It is very light and reading a book is great.
B00CYQPM42,8,9,I found it very easy to connect to the Wi-Fi in each hotel we stayed at.
B00CYQPM42,8,10,Regardless if your looking for something to watch Netflix on, read books, and surf the web it's excellent.
B00CYQPM42,8,11,I did have a problem with it not reading books I had already purchased (DRM problem).
B00CYQPM42,8,12,It works very well for music, reading docucuments and general web page browsing mhm habit video watching I is quite unreliable.
B00CYQPM42,8,13,It's easy to use and provides a high-quality experience for reading e-Books, browsing the Internet and watching video.
B00CYQPM42,8,14,The screen is sharp and clear, so it is great for reading and watching you tube videos.
B00CYQPM42,8,15,I haven't found it to be annoying at all and shouldn't be a deal-breaker.I use the device for reading of books and magazines, watching movies and television shows, playing games, e-mail and light surfing of the web.
B00CYQPM42,8,16,Works perfect, the kids love them!
B00CYQPM42,8,17,I read and write email, surf the web, read and listen to books and watch videos.
B00CYQPM42,8,18,(If you have already started watching it, and you try to watch it away from a Wi-Fi connection, you only get another 15 days to finish watching it before it gets deleted.)Be
B00CYQPM42,8,19,Love It!
B00CYQPM42,8,20,I use it every day, not just to read, but to play games, and to check email when away from home.You can teach old dogs new tricks!!
B00CYQPM42,8,21,Good browser.
B00CYQPM42,8,22,I watch all my shows on it!! Internet speed is even faster than my laptop!! Love that you can get email & there are plenty of free apps that I use!!
B00CYQPM42,8,23,I didn't notice any difference between the two tablets while reading books, watching videos, or browsing the internet.
B00CYQPM42,8,24,Nice device.
B00CYQPM42,9,0,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,9,1,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,9,2,Very nice tablet.
B00CYQPM42,9,3,The unit has a lovely display, it's responsive and a great overall tablet.
B00CYQPM42,9,4,It works very sporadic.
B00CYQPM42,9,5,One in three times it will work.
B00CYQPM42,9,6,It also has a great functional cover.
B00CYQPM42,9,7,I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).
B00CYQPM42,9,8,The touch sceen on the iPad also works a lot smoother and is more accurate.
B00CYQPM42,9,9,The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen.
B00CYQPM42,9,10,What I do like is when it does work it's pretty accurate as far as words.
B00CYQPM42,9,11,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,9,12,Screen is gorgeous and so clear it's like 3D at times.
B00CYQPM42,9,13,The only thing that I would like to see is a larger screen at the same price.
B00CYQPM42,9,14,I take it everywhere and use it all the time for work and play.
B00CYQPM42,9,15,Got a Poetic magnetic cover and it works great!
B00CYQPM42,9,16,I am using it to write this review, actually.
B00CYQPM42,9,17,(In my opinion anyway) the iPad is a lot easier to navigate around on, speech to text always works as well.
B00CYQPM42,9,18,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,9,19,I love the predictive keyboard, which to me is similar to my iPad minis, because I can make a lot of mistakes typing quickly.
B00CYQPM42,9,20,I think this tablet is great with just one negative.
B00CYQPM42,9,21,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,9,22,I kept hitting the virtual button during normal typing... changed it for a Nook HD+, which was a fantastic bargain for only $139 at the time.
B00CYQPM42,9,23,The display quality is truly awesome, the screen size is perfect for games and reading.
B00CYQPM42,9,24,If this option is one of your deciding factors, then don't.
B00CYQPM42,10,0,Really great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,1,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,2,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,10,3,Works great.
B00CYQPM42,10,4,As great as the ads said it would be!
B00CYQPM42,10,5,Nice tablet, but... Great little tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,6,Good shape, size and easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,10,7,Great value.
B00CYQPM42,10,8,Very Clear Screen.
B00CYQPM42,10,9,Great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,10,Really good.
B00CYQPM42,10,11,I know they are working on it , but not fixed yet.
B00CYQPM42,10,12,the screen is clear.
B00CYQPM42,10,13,Great resolution.
B00CYQPM42,10,14,It looks great too.
B00CYQPM42,10,15,Great.
B00CYQPM42,10,16,Beautiful display screen.
B00CYQPM42,10,17,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,10,18,very nice apps, the resolution and sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,10,19,It is a great traveling companion!
B00CYQPM42,10,20,I am a sitter at the hospital and it works well for what I need it to do.
B00CYQPM42,10,21,The device itself is light, easy to use, and pretty to look at.
B00CYQPM42,10,22,For the price it was a great deal.
B00CYQPM42,10,23,It has a great screen, it's lightweight, and the price is right.
B00CYQPM42,10,24,I am enjoying it so far other than that screen being a little small for me I think it has terrific features.
B00CYQPM42,11,0,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,11,1,The Lack of even a mini USB port.
B00CYQPM42,11,2,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,11,3,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,11,4,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,11,5,Then they took away the HDMI port which I use often to play a movies on my TV.
B00CYQPM42,11,6,The is some glare in bright light but that is the trade-off for color.The included apps are good enough.
B00CYQPM42,11,7,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,11,8,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,11,9,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,11,10,Movies look great, games look great, photos and games look great.
B00CYQPM42,11,11,Good shape, size and easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,11,12,Watching movies works for me - the 7" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.
B00CYQPM42,11,13,The improved 'carousel' and apps screen is also a nice improvement.
B00CYQPM42,11,14,I also like that there is a "on device" and "cloud" app storage so I can move apps to the Cloud when I don't want them for a time.
B00CYQPM42,11,15,Great tab, but until the Flash issue is solved, not perfect.
B00CYQPM42,11,16,Battery life is pretty good.
B00CYQPM42,11,17,Everything else in comparison like the display, size, sound and battery life are pretty much the same.
B00CYQPM42,11,18,The unit has a lovely display, it's responsive and a great overall tablet.
B00CYQPM42,11,19,This is a great device at an exceptional price.
B00CYQPM42,11,20,The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger.
B00CYQPM42,11,21,This feels really good in your hand and the screen is BEAUTIFUL.
B00CYQPM42,11,22,Love It!! What a great device!!
B00CYQPM42,11,23,Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it.
B00CYQPM42,11,24,I can not believe how good even the speakers are given the size of this device.
B00CYQPM42,12,0,But all in all, if you like thin, fast it is great.
B00CYQPM42,12,1,As great as the ads said it would be!
B00CYQPM42,12,2,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,12,3,This is a great product.
B00CYQPM42,12,4,Fast thin.
B00CYQPM42,12,5,Operates fast and smooth.
B00CYQPM42,12,6,It was fast, lightweight, and easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,12,7,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,12,8,GREAT PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,12,9,It would not operate.
B00CYQPM42,12,10,This thing is great!
B00CYQPM42,12,11,Easy to use and  lightweight.
B00CYQPM42,12,12,Great product!
B00CYQPM42,12,13,Excellent Device but very resiticted operationg system.
B00CYQPM42,12,14,The screen is beautiful and it is incredibly fast!
B00CYQPM42,12,15,The only thing is that the HDX has a different look for the Android Operating System which is actually very nice.
B00CYQPM42,12,16,So easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,12,17,This feels really good in your hand and the screen is BEAUTIFUL.
B00CYQPM42,12,18,They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.
B00CYQPM42,12,19,I liked it a lot it is easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,12,20,I like the display and it is easy to operate.
B00CYQPM42,12,21,But great, takes a second to download anything
B00CYQPM42,12,22,So far this thing is GREAT.
B00CYQPM42,12,23,There is VERY little customization, my android phone is much more user interface friendly, this, this is just messy.If you can manage through the funky menu system it's a good device, good reader, good gamer, good surfer, just lousy interface, not overly user friendly at all.
B00CYQPM42,12,24,All this goodness in a package that is thinner and lighter than before.Perhaps I am showing my age, but I am amazed at how such a feature rich product works so well right out of the box.
B00CYQPM42,13,0,Superior Product.
B00CYQPM42,13,1,Great customer service!!
B00CYQPM42,13,2,If I had known I wouldn't have purchased this product.
B00CYQPM42,13,3,Great product!
B00CYQPM42,13,4,Great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,5,fast shipping.
B00CYQPM42,13,6,Although it's old tech now, one thing I love about Samsung products is they LAST.
B00CYQPM42,13,7,I even called customer service and they said there's was a problem with it.
B00CYQPM42,13,8,This product will replace iPads in no time.My Dad loves the MayDay.
B00CYQPM42,13,9,I'm pretty aggravated any time I have to deal with Amazon Customer Service.
B00CYQPM42,13,10,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,13,11,So I contacted Amazon customer service and let me just say they really are as amazing as everyone says!
B00CYQPM42,13,12,Keep up the great work Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,13,13,The best part about the Kindle devices is the excellent customer service.
B00CYQPM42,13,14,Very nice product
B00CYQPM42,13,15,I am so happy to be back in the fold of happy Amazon customers.
B00CYQPM42,13,16,You now must purchase an additional product from amazon at a cost of around $100.
B00CYQPM42,13,17,I think they are a great value and being backed by amazon means they will be supported for a long time.
B00CYQPM42,13,18,However, I am largely happy with my purchase, and am definitely happy with Amazon's customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,19,I called customer service AGAIN and asked if I was eligible for a refund and they told me that because this was a replacement device I could not have a refund.
B00CYQPM42,13,20,Just plain exceptional product!
B00CYQPM42,13,21,I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one.
B00CYQPM42,13,22,It was the best customer service experience I've ever had.
B00CYQPM42,13,23,HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY.
B00CYQPM42,13,24,One of the associates had to call a lady back in because she told the customer that Kindle could not connect to 4G.This tablet is great.
B00CYQPM42,14,0,This works better than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,14,1,I have 3 ipads & a iPad Mini.
B00CYQPM42,14,2,Like the way I can find all my everyday apps, like banking or weather just like my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,14,3,My next was an iPad 2 and then a Microsoft Surface Pro.
B00CYQPM42,14,4,Good tablet overall but the thing is the appstore its has about 10x less than the apple apps in the appstore
B00CYQPM42,14,5,Much better than an iPad.3)
B00CYQPM42,14,6,I also own a Samsung Note 8, several iPads and have several other tablets as well.
B00CYQPM42,14,7,It is easy to use and compact.Does everything a mini I-pad does.
B00CYQPM42,14,8,Much better than an Apple I-Pad!
B00CYQPM42,14,9,Love it!
B00CYQPM42,14,10,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,14,11,Not enough apps.
B00CYQPM42,14,12,Automatic App Updates - This was recently something added to iPads as well, but it's a great feature.
B00CYQPM42,14,13,I have an iPad 1 and  wanted to upgrade due to slow speed and the inability to upgrade iOS/ app incompatibility.
B00CYQPM42,14,14,Not for me...but my husband loves it. .
B00CYQPM42,14,15,For him it's a nice improvement from the iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,14,16,Love it!
B00CYQPM42,14,17,I haven't gotten to use a 3G feature yet, but this tablet finds a WiFi connection where my Surface Pro, other tablets and even my powerful laptops can't get it.It's got great apps, the screen is stunning (looks better than the last iPad Air or Surface Pro 2), and its drop test rating is one of the better ones.
B00CYQPM42,14,18,While it's not perfect, it still provides the same functions you would find in other tablets (some of which are better).
B00CYQPM42,14,19,So it would have been obvious to just get the iPad.
B00CYQPM42,14,20,My husband has an IPad and I have to say, I like this Kindle so much better!
B00CYQPM42,14,21,I've got better things to do with my time that hack a product right out of the box.
B00CYQPM42,14,22,Loved it for media.
B00CYQPM42,14,23,Flash is available on Windows tablets if that is something you need.
B00CYQPM42,14,24,This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well.
B00CYQPM42,15,0,And it just looks sharp with the black screen and backing.
B00CYQPM42,15,1,The only other problem I have noticed is with the screen resolution.
B00CYQPM42,15,2,I've been very happy with the sharpness of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,3,The reflections are the worst when the screen is mainly black, which happens often because the main screen of the tablet is black.
B00CYQPM42,15,4,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,15,5,The screen is very clear and the options for use are almost endless.
B00CYQPM42,15,6,So I turned it back down to a brightness of about 75% which is bright enough without being too bright.The only problem I have with the screen is that it is very reflective, easily the most reflective tablet I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,15,7,There are 4 obvious shadows at the bottom of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,8,Has almost all of the apps I want, and all of the apps my wife ever needs (I'm a nerd who uses a few apps that are obscure).Screen:Responsive, bright, crisp, great viewing angle.
B00CYQPM42,15,9,Side by side the 7's reading screen on white looked "dirty" compared to the 8.9's crisp whiteness (same purple haze on both sadly).
B00CYQPM42,15,10,I have noticed my screen flickers when I am using an app that has color (basically everything except reading).
B00CYQPM42,15,11,So far not happy at all with a product that almost cost me $300.00 and has a HORRIBLE VERY OBVIOUS blue/purple line that goes alone the whole screen on both sides.
B00CYQPM42,15,12,The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.
B00CYQPM42,15,13,I do not like the blue lighting around the edges, it something resets and even with a black background (to avoid the blue lighting) it has a light flicker.
B00CYQPM42,15,14,So, I sent it back and got a replacement from Amazon.And then that replacement's display started flickering randomly.
B00CYQPM42,15,15,However, the display suffered more from the "blue" on the sides more than others I'd seen.
B00CYQPM42,15,16,Horrible Purple Blue Hue Along Edges Very Obvious!
B00CYQPM42,15,17,Watching movies works for me - the 7" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.
B00CYQPM42,15,18,If you're watching a high-def movie, the 4:3 aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the HDX and Nexus.
B00CYQPM42,15,19,It is easier to use than  the original which I also own.  the only down side is the sensitivity is so intense that pages change and directionality of the display even when I have not intended it.
B00CYQPM42,15,20,As soon as you go to the next screen, there are no more ads.
B00CYQPM42,15,21,In fact, the screen is much sharper than the HD (and the HD was very clear).
B00CYQPM42,15,22,The screen is sharp and clear, so it is great for reading and watching you tube videos.
B00CYQPM42,15,23,Movies are more crisper on the HDX than on the HD but one would only notice it if comparing side by side.
B00CYQPM42,15,24,This is still the default on the HDX, but swiping upward fills the screen with apps instead.*
B00CYQPM42,16,0,To few apps.
B00CYQPM42,16,1,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,16,2,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,16,3,The child or toddler apps I did download would freeze, not only the app but also the tablet!
B00CYQPM42,16,4,All it needs is a suitable app store.
B00CYQPM42,16,5,App store is awful!!!!!!!!!!
B00CYQPM42,16,6,Why is there no app for an update for Flash Player?
B00CYQPM42,16,7,No podcast player app.
B00CYQPM42,16,8,Amazon you need to fix your App store
B00CYQPM42,16,9,By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.
B00CYQPM42,16,10,Runs on a android system but does not allow google play.
B00CYQPM42,16,11,I can't download any videos as I get an error that it is already downloaded to another one of my devices!!
B00CYQPM42,16,12,No YouTube app.
B00CYQPM42,16,13,It is REALLY hard to quit apps.
B00CYQPM42,16,14,So some websites with videos cant play the videos.
B00CYQPM42,16,15,Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime.
B00CYQPM42,16,16,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,16,17,It's quite obvious if any Amazon App store guys have even tried to install this Magic 2014 game that it just won't install.
B00CYQPM42,16,18,Google doesn't support Adobe Flash in Android any more.
B00CYQPM42,16,19,My favorite game app doesn't make them for the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,16,20,There is another browser you can download to watch videos on but after a while that one catches so many viruses I had to delete it.
B00CYQPM42,16,21,The responsibility of Downloading and Installing of the Magic 2014 application belongs to the Amazon App Store (after all, it is Amazon App Store people who authorized this to be released in their store).
B00CYQPM42,16,22,While this means you don't get access to the actual G-mail app, Google Earth, Google+, and YouTube, the loss that hurt me the most was the inability to install Chrome.
B00CYQPM42,16,23,If you want a legitimate version of any Google product, or many other Google play apps, you cannot install it without a side-load situation.
B00CYQPM42,16,24,No Google Chromecast.
B00CYQPM42,17,0,I FOUND THAT THE PRICE WAS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,17,1,My son (8) bought this with his own money.
B00CYQPM42,17,2,I wish I never bought it!
B00CYQPM42,17,3,This was my 4th kindle and I will not be wasting my money on one ever again.
B00CYQPM42,17,4,I am really disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,5,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,6,Why waste money on buying then having to buy everything else when you can get a Kindle Fire HDX that just plain kicks Apple's ass?
B00CYQPM42,17,7,I bought two of these for Christmas, one for me one and one as a gift, at $179.
B00CYQPM42,17,8,I purchased this as a gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,9,It was a Christmas present.
B00CYQPM42,17,10,I know that you get what you pay for, so I guess I should have gotten an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,11,Would recommend buying a case for this and all kindles since they can be slippery at times.
B00CYQPM42,17,12,I bought this, as a gift for my 72 year old mother.
B00CYQPM42,17,13,Save your money and purchase Google/Android.
B00CYQPM42,17,14,Great buy for the value.
B00CYQPM42,17,15,I guess I'm going to pay $200 more for and Ipad which I didn't want to do in the first place.
B00CYQPM42,17,16,This is the most expensive waste of money!
B00CYQPM42,17,17,I am just very disappointed in it for what I paid for.
B00CYQPM42,17,18,I will immediately get rid of the device when I am back in the states and buy an IPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,19,The same thing happened when I bought the Kindle Paperwhite a  year ago.
B00CYQPM42,17,20,Do not purchase as a gift or you will have a hard time getting warranty replacement.
B00CYQPM42,17,21,If you buy it as a cheaper alternative to other Android-based tablets you will likely be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,22,They will not provide me with a replacement since I gave the Kindle as a Christmas gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,23,Disappointed in this.
B00CYQPM42,17,24,Disappointing after owning an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,18,0,The battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,18,1,Battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,18,2,battery doesn't last.
B00CYQPM42,18,3,Does not hold it's charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,4,The battery charger is faulty and the only way I can charge the kindle is to prop up the cord.
B00CYQPM42,18,5,Battery only last for two to three  hours.
B00CYQPM42,18,6,Cannot turn it off.
B00CYQPM42,18,7,Low battery life.
B00CYQPM42,18,8,The first one after less than a week woudn't charge.. Sent it back and they sent us a new one.
B00CYQPM42,18,9,I don't want to have to turn on Quiet Time all the time just to get this to stop.
B00CYQPM42,18,10,The Kindle recently died, the battery cannot be charged, even when using a different charger.
B00CYQPM42,18,11,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,12,I have to hold the power button down for 15 seconds or more for it to shut off.
B00CYQPM42,18,13,If the cord is propped up I can leave it plugged in all night and it won't charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,14,One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,15,Battery life is great so far.-
B00CYQPM42,18,16,Every time I turn the tablet on I get  advertising.
B00CYQPM42,18,17,Even in the day time or with light, I have to make a concerted effort to determine which way is up and remember that the power button is on the left.
B00CYQPM42,18,18,Something's amiss here.What is going on with this, TILTED power plug/charger?
B00CYQPM42,18,19,My only complaint is that it takes a very long time to recharge the battery so you don't want to forget to plug it in overnight.
B00CYQPM42,18,20,The Kindle froze and I couldn't do anything until the battery ran out and then I was able to restart it.
B00CYQPM42,18,21,I have this unit for several weeks now and since then I have experienced a couple of slow down response and three "blue screens" although the unit is 40%, 80 % and 55 % charged, the first time it came back after 4 hours, the second and third time after several minutes.
B00CYQPM42,18,22,Everything works great, but the battery life is not nearly as long as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,18,23,Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.
B00CYQPM42,18,24,I find myself accidentally pressing the wrong ones from time to time.
B00CYQPM42,19,0,In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough.
B00CYQPM42,19,1,I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones.
B00CYQPM42,19,2,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,19,3,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,19,4,If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder.
B00CYQPM42,19,5,With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste.
B00CYQPM42,19,6,I bought headphones so that I can hear all video-play clearly and well.
B00CYQPM42,19,7,Now I just have to find a pretty case for it!!
B00CYQPM42,19,8,found the speakers to have decent sound.
B00CYQPM42,19,9,I am very happy with the resolution and the sound.
B00CYQPM42,19,10,It sounds like I am sitting in a surround sound movie theater.
B00CYQPM42,19,11,I bought this for my father who has low vision.
B00CYQPM42,19,12,Not for Low Vision.
B00CYQPM42,19,13,I hear it is not that difficult.
B00CYQPM42,19,14,He can manage to get around it just fine and we have the parental settings etc.  so it's good for the parents..
B00CYQPM42,19,15,Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.
B00CYQPM42,19,16,I eventually figured out that if you angle the tablet slightly away from you, or slightly toward you, much of the reflection is eliminated.SOUND - The speakers are in the back.
B00CYQPM42,19,17,The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.
B00CYQPM42,19,18,If I am on the treadmill, I cannot hear it at all.
B00CYQPM42,19,19,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,19,20,I disagree with some of the reviews that said the audio was superior.
B00CYQPM42,19,21,The sound quality is also top notch.
B00CYQPM42,19,22,The sound while listening to audiobooks and movies is very good.
B00CYQPM42,19,23,This got pretty annoying!
B00CYQPM42,19,24,6 NOV 2013**In Settings/Device/Applications/Videos Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 Audio is shut off by default.
B00CYQPM42,20,0,The HDX has a front facing camera, but lacks a rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,1,It also doesn't have a rear facing camera, it only has a front facing one, like for apps such as Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,2,The poor quality front facing only camera on it.
B00CYQPM42,20,3,If you take the time to put a camera, why not make give it a front and rear with more megapixels to really compete with other tablets?
B00CYQPM42,20,4,The 7” version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.
B00CYQPM42,20,5,I don't like just front camera ure feature..rather, I prefer rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,6,#1 the camera on this model is only front facing but it seems that on all of the other HDX models that are larger they have a front AND rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,7,The rear facing camera would make my 32BG purchase choice more useful.
B00CYQPM42,20,8,I bought the unit over the nook because it stated that the unit had a camera, but did not specify that it was only and front facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,9,Also the camera is the worst part, the camera is only on the front of the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,10,I ONLY WISH THE CAMERA WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
B00CYQPM42,20,11,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,12,The only camera is on the front side (screen side), so taking video or a picture with it is difficult because you can't see the screen.
B00CYQPM42,20,13,-- the camera takes wonderful video / photos : additional options available 4 use w/ the camera -- one drawback > front camera only -if u desire front / back u would have 2 purchase 8.9 device -- pixels woo -- mayday feature haven't used it  yet -- has voice 2 text feature--
B00CYQPM42,20,14,The only pictures you can take of are yourself because if you turn it around you can't see what you are taking a picture of.
B00CYQPM42,20,15,I am not sure what use the camera on the front is, unless you like to take selfies holding what amounts to a book in front of you.
B00CYQPM42,20,16,A camera on the back would be much preferable.
B00CYQPM42,20,17,I bought the HDX so that I could possibly use the features of Amazon Prime, and the front facing camera for my time spent in Thailand.
B00CYQPM42,20,18,I do a little Face Book time and it works well for that too.Money well spent I think.
B00CYQPM42,20,19,It was a huge disappointment!In my opinion they took more away and only added a camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,20,I also thought he camera would be usy to use.
B00CYQPM42,20,21,It could only be more perfect if it had a front facing camera!
B00CYQPM42,20,22,It now comes with a cable and wall charger.There is no rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,23,This dissapointed me alot because I spend alot of extra money to pay for the 32 GB to take pictures on it but I cant really take any pictures of use with the front facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,24,This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well.
B00CYQPM42,21,0,Not what I expected.
B00CYQPM42,21,1,It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.
B00CYQPM42,21,2,Not what I expected, camera is not adjustable and you have to play with it.
B00CYQPM42,21,3,Lots of freezing and unexpected hangs.
B00CYQPM42,21,4,Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,21,5,I have an iPad 1 and  wanted to upgrade due to slow speed and the inability to upgrade iOS/ app incompatibility.
B00CYQPM42,21,6,No chrome, Firefox, atomic, or safari.
B00CYQPM42,21,7,The speed and screen difference alone is worth the upgrade.
B00CYQPM42,21,8,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,21,9,The child or toddler apps I did download would freeze, not only the app but also the tablet!
B00CYQPM42,21,10,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,21,11,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,21,12,I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently.
B00CYQPM42,21,13,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,21,14,Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.
B00CYQPM42,21,15,The improved 'carousel' and apps screen is also a nice improvement.
B00CYQPM42,21,16,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,21,17,Watching movies works for me - the 7" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.
B00CYQPM42,21,18,I like how much faster the processor and Wi-Fi are too!
B00CYQPM42,21,19,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,21,20,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,21,21,I bought this for my 7 year old and it worked fine at first but now it keeps freezing up and we can't turn it off or anything it just freezes on whatever she was doing playing the music on and on can't even power it down until the battery dies wouldn't recommend this product.
B00CYQPM42,21,22,The processor, it is very fast and loads pages quickly, and the 2 gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance.2.
B00CYQPM42,21,23,I find it very useless due to the fact that there is not many apps.
B00CYQPM42,21,24,The cursor jumps around randomly.
B00CYQPM42,22,0,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,1,32GB will provide you more memory space for pics, hd movies, etc. Apps eat up a lot of memory quickly.I recommend that Amazon provide the approx number of movies etc can be stored on each kindle model with its specs.
B00CYQPM42,22,2,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,22,3,The 16 GB isn't really 16 GB, which is par for the course.
B00CYQPM42,22,4,It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2.
B00CYQPM42,22,5,Still having a few problems finding things on this one, after I got used to the last model.
B00CYQPM42,22,6,I don't have any complaints or suggestions for future changes so far (except maybe to quit tempting me with new models for a while!).
B00CYQPM42,22,7,Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage.
B00CYQPM42,22,8,The lack of onboard storage (which was promoted earlier on as a none issue for modern users) has turned a real problem and the 16GB version actually leaves the user with closer to 8 or 9GB than the 16GB advertised.
B00CYQPM42,22,9,I also like that there is a "on device" and "cloud" app storage so I can move apps to the Cloud when I don't want them for a time.
B00CYQPM42,22,10,To few apps.
B00CYQPM42,22,11,I find it very useless due to the fact that there is not many apps.
B00CYQPM42,22,12,But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing.
B00CYQPM42,22,13,And a lot of apps will consistently ask.
B00CYQPM42,22,14,The child or toddler apps I did download would freeze, not only the app but also the tablet!
B00CYQPM42,22,15,I have a newer Mac, and my Mac does not recognize the device.
B00CYQPM42,22,16,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,22,17,Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app.
B00CYQPM42,22,18,The fact that the device does not support storage expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,19,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,22,20,The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!
B00CYQPM42,22,21,This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well.
B00CYQPM42,22,22,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,22,23,Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge.
B00CYQPM42,22,24,I can access the small amount of music I have stored in Amazons cloud, but Video is blocked.
B00CYQPM42,23,0,WIFI Connectivity.
B00CYQPM42,23,1,Won't Connect to my Wireless Router.
B00CYQPM42,23,2,My other devices have never had an issue.
B00CYQPM42,23,3,It is hard and slow to connect to WiFI unlike my other Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,4,wi-fi drops constantly.
B00CYQPM42,23,5,The wi-fi connection drops constantly for no apparent reason.
B00CYQPM42,23,6,Thus, I ran into the very same connectivity issues that I had with my old Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,7,i got this particular model so i could have internet/ wifi anywhere.
B00CYQPM42,23,8,And the update fixed all the problems I had encountered.
B00CYQPM42,23,9,even that would not work.
B00CYQPM42,23,10,At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem.
B00CYQPM42,23,11,He sent a few emails telling me he was working on the problem and the last email I received stated his superiors said I should update my kindle with the new update because it would fix my problems..
B00CYQPM42,23,12,Whenever I would connect to Wifi the Kindle would shut down and reboot.
B00CYQPM42,23,13,Had issues with the first Kindle Fire HDX 7" with the system shuting down every time I tried to connect to wifi.
B00CYQPM42,23,14,If the connection issues were resolved, I would give this 5 stars.
B00CYQPM42,23,15,I am especially disappointed that my problems have now been written off.
B00CYQPM42,23,16,A very unexpected bonus to the new device.
B00CYQPM42,23,17,It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day.
B00CYQPM42,23,18,This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well.
B00CYQPM42,23,19,Today, I was at Starbucks, where I tried connecting to the internet through their free WIFI service, but failed to connect.
B00CYQPM42,23,20,it constantly loses my wi-fi singnal (at least 2-3 times per day).
B00CYQPM42,23,21,Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems.
B00CYQPM42,23,22,She couldn't comprehend that I could not complete her troubleshooting checklist because the device was not working!
B00CYQPM42,23,23,I thought that the Kindle Fire HDX would solve the problem of connecting without WiFi.
B00CYQPM42,23,24,Some days it works fine but once it starts acting up, it will continuously drop connection every 2 - 10 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,24,0,The only thing I don't like is the keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,24,1,Like HDX very much and wish a touch cover like keyboard case to make it more productive.
B00CYQPM42,24,2,Will need to find a way to change the keyboard layout.
B00CYQPM42,24,3,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,24,4,For example, something like Surface touch cover.
B00CYQPM42,24,5,My only complaint about this product is that it's way too sensitive to touch.
B00CYQPM42,24,6,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,24,7,I miss being able to click on the top of the screen to get to settings.
B00CYQPM42,24,8,I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times.
B00CYQPM42,24,9,I keep finding things that  I didn't know were there.
B00CYQPM42,24,10,For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit.
B00CYQPM42,24,11,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,24,12,But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,13,My only gripe is that the text to speech shuts off if you manually turn a page and when screen rotates.
B00CYQPM42,24,14,Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,24,15,It's really frustrating.
B00CYQPM42,24,16,Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app.
B00CYQPM42,24,17,This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached.
B00CYQPM42,24,18,At launch, it is understandable the lack of accessories but productivity focus accessories such as integrated case/keyboard are missing at launch.
B00CYQPM42,24,19,It's more of an annoyance than a problem.
B00CYQPM42,24,20,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,24,21,The back is a hard rubber, which is rubbery enough not to be slippery, but not so rubbery that it's mushy.SCREEN - The HDX has a 1920 x 1200 screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,22,I've got better things to do with my time that hack a product right out of the box.
B00CYQPM42,24,23,I find myself accidentally pressing the wrong ones from time to time.
B00CYQPM42,24,24,The only other problem I have noticed is with the screen resolution.
B00CYQPM42,25,0,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,25,1,Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.
B00CYQPM42,25,2,I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet.
B00CYQPM42,25,3,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,25,4,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,25,5,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,25,6,Kindle Fire- best kept secret for devices.
B00CYQPM42,25,7,This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well.
B00CYQPM42,25,8,A very unexpected bonus to the new device.
B00CYQPM42,25,9,Actually it makes me feel like I need a dummies book to work it
B00CYQPM42,25,10,There are apps I wish I could get on the Kindle Fire HDX.
B00CYQPM42,25,11,With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD
B00CYQPM42,25,12,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,25,13,This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.
B00CYQPM42,25,14,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,25,15,You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.
B00CYQPM42,25,16,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,25,17,Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app.
B00CYQPM42,25,18,Great tablet, but again the 7" screen doesn't cut it.
B00CYQPM42,25,19,I was one of the first to buy a Kindle back when Amazon first introduced these devices.
B00CYQPM42,25,20,It still has a lot of kinks to be worked out.
B00CYQPM42,25,21,For the price of a Kindle Fire HDX, you will not find anything better.
B00CYQPM42,25,22,Would recommend buying a case for this and all kindles since they can be slippery at times.
B00CYQPM42,25,23,;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.
B00CYQPM42,25,24,Galaxy tab, Nexus, iPad, iPad mini).
B00CYQPM42,26,0,The Lack of even a mini USB port.
B00CYQPM42,26,1,Only thing that is really lacking is a USB port otherwise it is a great little product.
B00CYQPM42,26,2,My only complaint is the power/USB port is angled so when the cable is plugged in and the tablet is on the table, the cord does not lay flat.
B00CYQPM42,26,3,The USB port sticks out at an odd angle, making it difficult to plug in.
B00CYQPM42,26,4,The placement of the USB port for charger is a great improvement.
B00CYQPM42,26,5,Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away.
B00CYQPM42,26,6,The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3.
B00CYQPM42,26,7,It's just very odd and makes charging annoying.2)
B00CYQPM42,26,8,My phone did and our laptop did but mind showed me a keyboard and asked for a pin????
B00CYQPM42,26,9,have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle.
B00CYQPM42,26,10,Much better than an iPad.3)
B00CYQPM42,26,11,Except....when I took it to the beach and opened the cover, I didn't see a way to connect to the hotel's wi fi.
B00CYQPM42,26,12,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,26,13,And, even though some difficulty, I transferred my I-tunes.
B00CYQPM42,26,14,Again, not a huge deal but also something to bear in mind if youre in the market.5
B00CYQPM42,26,15,The user interface is an improvement also because one now have "home" and "carousel".
B00CYQPM42,26,16,I will immediately get rid of the device when I am back in the states and buy an IPad.
B00CYQPM42,26,17,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,26,18,Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%.
B00CYQPM42,26,19,I love the predictive keyboard, which to me is similar to my iPad minis, because I can make a lot of mistakes typing quickly.
B00CYQPM42,26,20,Then they took away the HDMI port which I use often to play a movies on my TV.
B00CYQPM42,26,21,If the connection issues were resolved, I would give this 5 stars.
B00CYQPM42,26,22,Another thing I like about this product, is that it dosn't  have proprietary issues.
B00CYQPM42,26,23,The battery life is ok, but not as good as my larger iPad by far.
B00CYQPM42,26,24,Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,27,0,I bought this for my wife and have had it maybe month and everything stopped working can not even unlock screen when you reset it.
B00CYQPM42,27,1,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,27,2,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,27,3,i despise the thing.
B00CYQPM42,27,4,I do this and the Kindle reloads and the same things happens again.
B00CYQPM42,27,5,kindle fire 7 Quit working.
B00CYQPM42,27,6,Defective Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,27,7,Pros and cons of my kindle.
B00CYQPM42,27,8,You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on.
B00CYQPM42,27,9,I will admit there were some bugs while working the device.
B00CYQPM42,27,10,I am returning the device in the morning.
B00CYQPM42,27,11,I would have given it 5 stars but some of the apps will flip upside down when I have the screen locked in one place.
B00CYQPM42,27,12,Also, the Kindle crashed on me.
B00CYQPM42,27,13,It's not a big deal, just annoying.
B00CYQPM42,27,14,For instance, I have run into a few occasions where it has crashed and restarted.
B00CYQPM42,27,15,So I've had the Kindle for nearly a month now.
B00CYQPM42,27,16,The lag could be a result of several things, including the hardware or system resources provided on this device.
B00CYQPM42,27,17,While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me.
B00CYQPM42,27,18,I've used others in the past, and I never could get past how slow they operate; however, Kindle Fire HDX is an exception.
B00CYQPM42,27,19,Again I would guess it's a lack system resources or possibly a hardware issue.The Flexibility of the Kindle:In terms of flexibility I guess this could be seen as subjective.
B00CYQPM42,27,20,Love my Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,27,21,While I'm not familiar with other operating systems, I will say that Fire OS is very smooth.
B00CYQPM42,27,22,Here's what I've found to be the problem with the Kindles Flexibility and one of the outstanding issues I've found with it.Amazon had set up packet blocking and redirect on their devices.
B00CYQPM42,27,23,Thus, I ran into the very same connectivity issues that I had with my old Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,27,24,I have seen Prime lock up and lag on all the devices I own, but none of the others have the severity or frequency of problems the Kindle has.
B00CYQPM42,28,0,I have contacted support about these problems.
B00CYQPM42,28,1,poor support.
B00CYQPM42,28,2,I am going to contact support again to see if they can help.
B00CYQPM42,28,3,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,28,4,The device is 5 months old...After contacting Amazon Kindle support a fourth time, someone finally helped me.
B00CYQPM42,28,5,It took a few days for a very supportive customer service chap from Ireland to sort out the problem.
B00CYQPM42,28,6,Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept.
B00CYQPM42,28,7,I called customer service AGAIN and asked if I was eligible for a refund and they told me that because this was a replacement device I could not have a refund.
B00CYQPM42,28,8,I want to return it.
B00CYQPM42,28,9,He sent a few emails telling me he was working on the problem and the last email I received stated his superiors said I should update my kindle with the new update because it would fix my problems..
B00CYQPM42,28,10,Therefore, I am no longer receiving any more emails about this issue which means the problems are not fixed and now I don't know what to do about it.
B00CYQPM42,28,11,i contacted customer service and it took them a week to send a canned email with instructions on how to load an email.
B00CYQPM42,28,12,When I called customer service they were great (the reason that this go any stars) I received a replacement and I am having the same issues.
B00CYQPM42,28,13,I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support.
B00CYQPM42,28,14,But in the end, I will be returning this device.
B00CYQPM42,28,15,I called customer care, they helped me quickly reset the device to factory settings and it seemed to have fixed it.
B00CYQPM42,28,16,However, Amazon will not replace the Kindle when I call as they claim I did not register the device, but they verified that I did purchase it as it is in my order history.
B00CYQPM42,28,17,So, in the end, this device has been boxed back up and will be going back to Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,28,18,So after contacting Amazon three times for this issue to get a replacement Kindle, I am still stuck with an unusable Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,28,19,Very happy customer.
B00CYQPM42,28,20,I've only had it a little over 3 weeks.
B00CYQPM42,28,21,Do not purchase as a gift or you will have a hard time getting warranty replacement.
B00CYQPM42,28,22,I've done tech support for a business I once owned, and a simple thing like this can make a huge difference in how a customer perceives a company.I had also emailed Amazon, received a reply with a number, and gave that a call.
B00CYQPM42,28,23,So far I've had no problems with my Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,28,24,If I had to do it again, I would not buy it and I want to send it back
B00CYQPM42,29,0,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,29,1,Disappointing.
B00CYQPM42,29,2,Just hanged up with the CS and they assure that is a software feature, and that can be fixed with a software update.
B00CYQPM42,29,3,This is the second one that the freezing happens so I'm not sure if it's something mechanical or what the reason is for it freezing.
B00CYQPM42,29,4,not completely satisfied.
B00CYQPM42,29,5,Having a lot of issues with this!!!
B00CYQPM42,29,6,pro and con.
B00CYQPM42,29,7,Difficult to read on a sunny beach but great everywhere else.
B00CYQPM42,29,8,Overal disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,29,9,The device shuts down and restarts while reading.
B00CYQPM42,29,10,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,29,11,I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently.
B00CYQPM42,29,12,Lots of freezing and unexpected hangs.
B00CYQPM42,29,13,For instance, I have run into a few occasions where it has crashed and restarted.
B00CYQPM42,29,14,Otherwise it's a great little machine!
B00CYQPM42,29,15,It's hard to scroll through screens without opening something about which you have no interest.
B00CYQPM42,29,16,Shuts down while reading.
B00CYQPM42,29,17,The issue has not been fixed.
B00CYQPM42,29,18,I saw all of the complaints about the blue haze around page borders and the initial glitches in set up.
B00CYQPM42,29,19,And there's a very tiny window underneath the carousel that suggests content similar to what you're reading/doing/watching already.
B00CYQPM42,29,20,Awful Initial Experience.
B00CYQPM42,29,21,I will admit there were some bugs while working the device.
B00CYQPM42,29,22,I have also run into situations where I've had to reinstall apps for them to work properly again.
B00CYQPM42,29,23,I use it a lot more than I use my desktop now.
B00CYQPM42,29,24,It's very non-intrusive (is that a word?) and I have no issues with it.Ease of set up is amazing as always.
B007P4YAPK,0,0,AND the screen is slightly larger than on an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,0,1,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,0,2,I've watched movies while traveling on both this tablet and the iPad and notice very little difference.
B007P4YAPK,0,3,I loved this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,0,4,The Amazon ads for the white one also show black.
B007P4YAPK,0,5,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,0,6,Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as "floaters" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,0,7,The screen resolution isn't as good, but unless you're super picky there's not enough difference for it to matter.
B007P4YAPK,0,8,But about a month ago, I noticed small little blotches in my screen that are white to greyish in color, but are only visible when the screen is displaying deep blacks.
B007P4YAPK,0,9,Short-lived love, now cautious like.. I researched tablets for almost a month before deciding on this one.
B007P4YAPK,0,10,The iPad is a superior device in every single way, from the screen, to performance to apps to battery life.Here's my review.I had the retina iPad for a while before I picked up this tablet, I knew it wasn't a high resolution screen going in so it wasn't a shock but I was still surprised at how quickly I got use to the iPad screen, the Transformer screen doesn't compare at all.
B007P4YAPK,0,11,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,0,12,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B007P4YAPK,0,13,In your hand something more squarish is easier to hold when you're talking about a 10" tablet, the longer the tablet the better for movies (in theory) but for everything else, and I mean everything, the 4:3 feels much more natural and is easier to hold.Again, I own this and I own an iPad -- I'm not an Apple fanboy and obviously I'm not an Android fanboy, I just want what is best I can get for my money and I can clearly state the iPad is a better device.
B007P4YAPK,0,14,I ordered blue and got black even though the box said blue.
B007P4YAPK,0,15,It's not a super high resolution display, so the individual pixels are pretty good sized, and this was pretty noticeable.
B007P4YAPK,0,16,It sure does not refer to the color of the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,0,17,Guess you can order any color you want as long as it is black.More later.
B007P4YAPK,0,18,I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general.
B007P4YAPK,0,19,I do love the size of it and it is easy to use, just too slow.
B007P4YAPK,0,20,All the great reviews made me believe this tablet might work out of the box.
B007P4YAPK,0,21,You like her enough to try again, but you know there were problems and they most likely have not gone away..  On the plus side, this tablet is an impressive piece of technology.
B007P4YAPK,0,22,Compared to the iPad I recently bought for my wife, it is really nothing much to write home about.
B007P4YAPK,0,23,Perhaps worst of all, possibly because of the increased resolution (the improved resolution was NOT apparent to MY eyes - it appeared to me about the same as all the other tablets) the device is incompatible with MANY apps!Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,0,24,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,1,0,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,1,1,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,1,2,I didn't have an opportunity to use it for the Amazon Prime Instant Videos before it stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,1,3,The app store for Apple is way better.
B007P4YAPK,1,4,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B007P4YAPK,1,5,However the lag and app failures were too much for me.
B007P4YAPK,1,6,I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app.
B007P4YAPK,1,7,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,1,8,While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps.
B007P4YAPK,1,9,Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you.
B007P4YAPK,1,10,I download audio books from the library so am not next to the tablet all the time.
B007P4YAPK,1,11,Having problems with mine, it is slow, and sometimes it kicks me out of a program, especially on the internetThe games I download on it are easy to play and we seem to have no problems there.
B007P4YAPK,1,12,I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general.
B007P4YAPK,1,13,still needs work.
B007P4YAPK,1,14,This was it... until it stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,1,15,The only other small problem I've had is when maximizing Youtube videos to full-screen - sometimes it doesn't play correctly, (EDIT 070612 -- the Youtube App automatically updated recently and I no longer sometimes have a problem with maximizing video - it works perfectly now every time.)I've
B007P4YAPK,1,16,NOTE any apps that are not compatible with the tablet you are testing.
B007P4YAPK,1,17,Honestly Android is just not there yet, but I see why people love it.So for me this didn't work out.
B007P4YAPK,1,18,Then I started installing apps, which at first was a joyful experience.
B007P4YAPK,1,19,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,20,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,1,21,Good visual, BUT people should know that Android newer versions is not Adobe Flash capable so if you (for instance) want to hook it to your TV using HDMI you better have a geek friend who can download a different Flash player.
B007P4YAPK,1,22,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,1,23,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,1,24,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,2,0,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,2,1,Though the tablet is a great product.
B007P4YAPK,2,2,None of the other Tablets were matching up on price, so when I saw the TF300 for the same price for the 32G, I jumped on it.
B007P4YAPK,2,3,Great tablet for the first two months.
B007P4YAPK,2,4,great tablet with some large setbacks.
B007P4YAPK,2,5,As this was a new model I waited to review - the tablet was great for the first two months - LOVED it!
B007P4YAPK,2,6,Product needs work.
B007P4YAPK,2,7,I bought my TF300 and was very impressed with the performance of the tablet for the price.
B007P4YAPK,2,8,For what is it worth, it is NOT worth it, and deserves 2 stars.
B007P4YAPK,2,9,Apparently I have a lemon, will be returning.Can anyone recommend a good android tablet?
B007P4YAPK,2,10,It's amazingly powerful and very well priced for the features it has.
B007P4YAPK,2,11,The screen quality is far superior to anything I've used previously, so I'm perfectly happy with it.
B007P4YAPK,2,12,Considering the cost, great tablet!
B007P4YAPK,2,13,The price is hard to beat for what you get.2.
B007P4YAPK,2,14,I ordered this tablet because of the price and the company reviews.
B007P4YAPK,2,15,The good plus is that it is a good affordable tablet to buy which I purely love it despite faults on it.
B007P4YAPK,2,16,I bought this tablet for my son for his birthday and for the first 2 weeks it was perfect!
B007P4YAPK,2,17,Best Android tablet, but quality issues.
B007P4YAPK,2,18,Don't buy.
B007P4YAPK,2,19,I absolutely love it and am very happy with my choice.
B007P4YAPK,2,20,Cnet reviewed this as good...better than a comparable Toshiba.
B007P4YAPK,2,21,I received this item a few days ago, and if I'm honest, I probably haven't done a great deal else but play with it since, (since charging it for the first time for over 8 hours as recommended.)I
B007P4YAPK,2,22,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,2,23,I could and am going to buy an Ipad 2 for the same price as the transformer 300 its just not worth dealing with all the possible problems these units seem to have after only a short period of regular use.
B007P4YAPK,2,24,I would rate it 5 starts if it worked the way it did when we first bought it!
B007P4YAPK,3,0,Powerful and has a good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,3,1,They are a photo junkie and just cannot get enough battery life.2.
B007P4YAPK,3,2,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,3,3,I last about 2 days of heavy use.
B007P4YAPK,3,4,Being able to use the keyboard was great, and the amount of extended battery life you get from it was amazing.
B007P4YAPK,3,5,On the down side the battery life isn't as good as the iPad's and requires more frequent charging.
B007P4YAPK,3,6,Battery life is poor - I have to recharge it all the time.
B007P4YAPK,3,7,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B007P4YAPK,3,8,Bad charger-seems to be a problem.... Tablet worked well until I tried to charge it after its first battery drain the first day of use.
B007P4YAPK,3,9,Example: one tech support insisted that 10 hours of battery life advertised is the 'stand-by' time as in the cell phone, and 5-6 hours of usable battery time is normal, which makes absolutely no sense.
B007P4YAPK,3,10,The fully charged battery dies within couple of hours of continuous use.
B007P4YAPK,3,11,I thought I must have hit the power button the first few times it happened.
B007P4YAPK,3,12,ASUS does not seem to educate their tech support properly.Now I have new replacement unit and the battery life is much longer 7-8 hours under the same condition, although it is still shorter than what they advertise.
B007P4YAPK,3,13,Unfortunately the day after I got it, I went to plug the tablet into the keyboard dock and it wouldn't click.
B007P4YAPK,3,14,Running on balanced power mode and at 25% brightness, it was running only 5-6 hours.Returning and getting the replacement unit was very easy with Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,3,15,It's a nice tablet as long as you stay off-line.
B007P4YAPK,3,16,This makes the battery last a maximum of an hour when you are trying to use the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,3,17,Not long after I got it, it started to give me problems.
B007P4YAPK,3,18,First impression was that I could tell it was faster than A500 it was more responsive meaning faster screen swapping...The major issue I ran into was that if I grasped the TF300 on the upper left corner near the power button the tablet would just completely shut down!
B007P4YAPK,3,19,When the battery is very low, even if it's plugged in, you cannot turn it on for 5 minutes or so until it charges up a little (not sure this is specific to only this tablet).5.
B007P4YAPK,3,20,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,3,21,I flipped it upside down to find the charging port broken, I presume from detaching from the keyboard dock the previous night.
B007P4YAPK,3,22,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,3,23,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,3,24,Feels cheap.
B007P4YAPK,4,0,The build quality was much better, everything aligned and in place.
B007P4YAPK,4,1,I like the build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,2,The design is good and simplistic.
B007P4YAPK,4,3,Bad video recording sound.
B007P4YAPK,4,4,I was trying in several environments to discard any sound source, but always it recorded the sound with the whistle.
B007P4YAPK,4,5,Decent product performance, shoddy build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,6,The tablet feels good itself.
B007P4YAPK,4,7,All in all, I THOUGHT this was going to be a solid product but in the end, the price of the tablet ended up being too good to be true because of the build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,8,Decent sound.8.
B007P4YAPK,4,9,ASUS is the way to go if you all about just quality only without bell and whistles.
B007P4YAPK,4,10,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,4,11,My nexus is a better performer.
B007P4YAPK,4,12,I had an Nexus 7 for a while as well and had the same situation with the battery and apps (although the build quality was quite good).
B007P4YAPK,4,13,But its really good for the price!
B007P4YAPK,4,14,Clearly there are quality issues with it!
B007P4YAPK,4,15,Best Android tablet, but quality issues.
B007P4YAPK,4,16,Feels cheap.
B007P4YAPK,4,17,Because ASUS makes good quality than samsung despite they have alot of bells and whistles.
B007P4YAPK,4,18,Even though the back is plastic (to help with gps/wifi), it feels solid with little flex.4.
B007P4YAPK,4,19,But on the other hand, it feels cheap.
B007P4YAPK,4,20,I Buy ASUS TF300 in nov/2012, it is very good product... almost, I got a problem: When I video recording, it is recording the video with a whistle sound included...
B007P4YAPK,4,21,Not good when one of the touted features is the display.
B007P4YAPK,4,22,The speakers are OK, but don't get very loud but they're acceptable.
B007P4YAPK,4,23,It's not a super high resolution display, so the individual pixels are pretty good sized, and this was pretty noticeable.
B007P4YAPK,4,24,Awesome tablet, plagued by quality control issues.
B007P4YAPK,5,0,Its good for some things but not others.
B007P4YAPK,5,1,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B007P4YAPK,5,2,The concept is very good I just hope it becomes more refined.
B007P4YAPK,5,3,still needs work.
B007P4YAPK,5,4,I do love the size of it and it is easy to use, just too slow.
B007P4YAPK,5,5,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,6,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,5,7,The screen quality is far superior to anything I've used previously, so I'm perfectly happy with it.
B007P4YAPK,5,8,If you are planning on using this tablet for games and other non work/school related things you dont have to search any farther.
B007P4YAPK,5,9,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,5,10,The new IPS+ high resolution screen is superb, the faster processor is welcome, the TF700 feels better constructed overall than the TF300, (partly due to being primarily made of metal), and having a built in flash for the rear camera is a nice extra too.
B007P4YAPK,5,11,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,5,12,The only reason I haven't thrown this piece of crap off my fifth story deck is that I'm hoping to find a sucker on craigslist to take it off my hands.
B007P4YAPK,5,13,Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera.
B007P4YAPK,5,14,however if you are planning on using this for work or school get something different.
B007P4YAPK,5,15,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,5,16,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,5,17,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,5,18,The TF300 was an incredible piece of kit when it worked, but my confidence in the materials and construction is gone now.
B007P4YAPK,5,19,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,5,20,It's not a super high resolution display, so the individual pixels are pretty good sized, and this was pretty noticeable.
B007P4YAPK,5,21,I'm still tempted to buy another, but the TF700 with its Gorilla Glass inspires more confidence.
B007P4YAPK,5,22,However, the main reason I chose the TF700 over another TF300 was its inclusion of Corning Gorilla Glass.
B007P4YAPK,5,23,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,5,24,I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general.
B007P4YAPK,6,0,My iPad 2 is fast, reliable, great looking Apps, and very responsive to EVERYTHING.
B007P4YAPK,6,1,Apps run quickly and the graphics/screen transitions in Android seem pretty snappy.
B007P4YAPK,6,2,Performance is quite decent.
B007P4YAPK,6,3,I've verified this isn't due to calibration settings or the screen being dirty.By contrast the Acer Iconia 500 was very responsive both to touch input and general app performance.
B007P4YAPK,6,4,Very responsive to inputs and can run any Android app available.
B007P4YAPK,6,5,Hopefully a new breed of tegra 3 competitors(tablets) will emerge anytime soon with faster and improved SoC's(28nm instead 40nm fab process on tegra 3 SoC) as samsung exynos quad core and qualcomm snapdragon S4.
B007P4YAPK,6,6,There are also a growing number of games from NVIDIA that only the Tegra processor can handle.
B007P4YAPK,6,7,Great idea, mediocre execution, poor performance.
B007P4YAPK,6,8,If they are critical to the OS, then these Apps should be hidden.
B007P4YAPK,6,9,There are many ugly Apps that do not work well.
B007P4YAPK,6,10,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,6,11,NO MORE ANDROID TABLET FOR ME.
B007P4YAPK,6,12,When compared to other Android tablets, this one was supposed to be the best.
B007P4YAPK,6,13,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,6,14,Asus, you've gotta get all that quad core processing to work with android better!
B007P4YAPK,6,15,Besides quad core the tablet is very slow in response.
B007P4YAPK,6,16,The browsers are not very responsive too.
B007P4YAPK,6,17,When I end-task on some Apps, they relaunch at same state.
B007P4YAPK,6,18,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,6,19,It may have a quadcore, lots of ram, and a nice GPU in it, but all this hardware is useless because Jelly Bean cannot utilize the hardware very well.
B007P4YAPK,6,20,It has a lower-power CPU and less storage capacity, yet this supposedly more powerful tablet ultimately feels like a downgrade.
B007P4YAPK,6,21,It's not a super high resolution display, so the individual pixels are pretty good sized, and this was pretty noticeable.
B007P4YAPK,6,22,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,6,23,Powerful and has a good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,6,24,No touch screen, but with the speed diff, I will use it from now on.
B007P4YAPK,7,0,Plenty of storage space.
B007P4YAPK,7,1,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,7,2,HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6.
B007P4YAPK,7,3,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,7,4,I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts.
B007P4YAPK,7,5,I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable!
B007P4YAPK,7,6,I have no SD card installed.
B007P4YAPK,7,7,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,7,8,I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.
B007P4YAPK,7,9,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,7,10,had the same NEW model one and loved it tho.
B007P4YAPK,7,11,I am ordering the micro SD card to boost additionally the speed and, of course, get more memory.
B007P4YAPK,7,12,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,7,13,Android tablets can't use all software.
B007P4YAPK,7,14,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,7,15,Even when it freezes up in an app the OS remains stable.7.
B007P4YAPK,7,16,Decent sound.8.
B007P4YAPK,7,17,It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly.
B007P4YAPK,7,18,The odd thing is the sync works perfectly fine on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which has less storage, RAM, etc.Sound:Sound is quite a bit more tinny than the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 speakers are quite good, and this tablet can't compare.
B007P4YAPK,7,19,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,7,20,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,7,21,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,7,22,Honestly Android is just not there yet, but I see why people love it.So for me this didn't work out.
B007P4YAPK,7,23,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,7,24,I also struggled a little with the new environment of Android 4 as I'd only ever used Android 2.0 before, although a within an hour or two I'd got up to speed with it and now it's second nature.
B007P4YAPK,8,0,Not for School or Work.
B007P4YAPK,8,1,Yes, it performs rudimentary functions like surfing the web(if you don't mind dial up like speeds).
B007P4YAPK,8,2,I'm not a big gamer just want to do basic email, web, and the occasional game or video.
B007P4YAPK,8,3,I am furious that I can not rely on this device for tasks that are critical for work or school.
B007P4YAPK,8,4,Now, mind you that I have a wifi router 2 feet from me and a perfect wifi connection.
B007P4YAPK,8,5,Unfortunately, I have had a few problems with it.
B007P4YAPK,8,6,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,8,7,Got this to help me in school, but like the I -Pad it's more for Entertainment, has limited Office, Word, and anything else that you might need to get work or school done...I am now saving to get a Laptop computer, gave this to my kids, nice toyPS.
B007P4YAPK,8,8,I loved my TF300 Tablet, and it was beginning to replace my laptop for casual use like email, internet, shopping, banking, etc.
B007P4YAPK,8,9,I have not had any heat issues, if that is what makes the aluminum preferred.I do email, surfing, and some board games..........and some small office spreadsheet work.
B007P4YAPK,8,10,It's light, and very easy to tote around.Excellent product.
B007P4YAPK,8,11,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,8,12,I do love the size of it and it is easy to use, just too slow.
B007P4YAPK,8,13,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,8,14,The Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 inch tablet maintains strong wi-fi connection both anywhere in my home and at the school where I attend classes.
B007P4YAPK,8,15,I bought it in place of a laptop to make school easier since it is light and easily stored in a book bag.
B007P4YAPK,8,16,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,8,17,I use this tablet at home and only to surf while I am sitting watching TV.
B007P4YAPK,8,18,For streaming videos from Youtube or Netflix it's not so good.
B007P4YAPK,8,19,The touch screen worked flawlessly, and it was very responsive.
B007P4YAPK,8,20,There are a variety of other problems associated with 4.2, but I'll let you do your own Google search to learn about those.The nice thing about this device has been the incredible speed with which ASUS gets firmware updates published, but in the case of 4.2, this created far more problems than it solved.
B007P4YAPK,8,21,I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app.
B007P4YAPK,8,22,I am not sure if this is related to the performance problem or not, but there are always major slowdowns just before a crash-to-reboot.
B007P4YAPK,8,23,I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general.
B007P4YAPK,8,24,No touch screen, but with the speed diff, I will use it from now on.
B007P4YAPK,9,0,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,9,1,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,9,2,The touch screen worked flawlessly, and it was very responsive.
B007P4YAPK,9,3,Perhaps a week after the update, my keyboard on the dock stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,9,4,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,5,I love the android slide touch keyboard that comes with it.
B007P4YAPK,9,6,Back in mid-July I was on the couch using the tablet (without the keyboard) when the touch screen just stopped responding.
B007P4YAPK,9,7,The tablet looked great, was responsive, and relatively easy to navigate.
B007P4YAPK,9,8,Something that I can use for leisure but then I can use it for school note taking or paper writing as well with the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,9,9,The touch screen stopped responding but for awhile I could dock it to the keyboard and it would respond.
B007P4YAPK,9,10,This was it... until it stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,9,11,Works fairly well.
B007P4YAPK,9,12,I had typed in the three letters for the airport but the tablets was acting like there was noting typed in the provided field.I was wanting a tablet because I though they would be faster to use.
B007P4YAPK,9,13,I have found that the touchscreen is not very responsive at times.
B007P4YAPK,9,14,It makes writing with the tablet so much easier.
B007P4YAPK,9,15,They are a little faster than a laptop when first turing on, but I'm not impressed with tablets and am now researching which laptop to buy.
B007P4YAPK,9,16,It was fast, the price was right, the keyboard dock was interesting, but I returned all three.
B007P4YAPK,9,17,Price wise it was a good deal.One of the first few days I had it, the letter "a" just kept rolling across the screen like it was stuck.
B007P4YAPK,9,18,Since it is both the docking station/keyboard and the tablet I don't know what I will get back... rebuilt or new?
B007P4YAPK,9,19,I like the idea of the keyboard dock with the mouse and I like that you can hook-up things like blue-tooth gaming pads - that is something the iPad really needs to allow, both the mouse if you have a keyboard attached and game pads.Summary - buy an iPad - it's better in every way.
B007P4YAPK,9,20,It still accepts input via the touchpad and mouse key, only the keyboard keys stopped functioning.
B007P4YAPK,9,21,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,9,22,Yes, for the Asus you can buy the keyboard and attach it to the tablet, but then I might have well just bought a laptop (which is what I'm looking for now).I tried a couple of games on it.
B007P4YAPK,9,23,it's a pretty good product.
B007P4YAPK,9,24,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,10,0,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,10,1,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,10,2,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,10,3,The screen resolution isn't as good, but unless you're super picky there's not enough difference for it to matter.
B007P4YAPK,10,4,It's not a super high resolution display, so the individual pixels are pretty good sized, and this was pretty noticeable.
B007P4YAPK,10,5,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,10,6,still needs work.
B007P4YAPK,10,7,I have had my Transformer TF300T since June...loved the tablet...been great.
B007P4YAPK,10,8,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,10,9,Considering the cost, great tablet!
B007P4YAPK,10,10,The design is good and simplistic.
B007P4YAPK,10,11,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,10,12,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,10,13,The appearance and handling characteristic are great.
B007P4YAPK,10,14,So I replaced the digitizer and was good for about two more weeks.
B007P4YAPK,10,15,Loved the tablet until hardware issue...
B007P4YAPK,10,16,Not good when one of the touted features is the display.
B007P4YAPK,10,17,Product needs work.
B007P4YAPK,10,18,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,10,19,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,10,20,The example I received had a speck of something underneath the glass, that I could see on light backgrounds/content.
B007P4YAPK,10,21,The touch screen worked flawlessly, and it was very responsive.
B007P4YAPK,10,22,My iPad 2 is fast, reliable, great looking Apps, and very responsive to EVERYTHING.
B007P4YAPK,10,23,The ASUS has a terrific screen and nice size/form matter.
B007P4YAPK,10,24,The Asus transformer 300 fit the bill.
B007P4YAPK,11,0,Tablet felt nice and responsive; keyboard dock, unfortunately, broke the charging port.
B007P4YAPK,11,1,So I must be careful about how many app I run before clearing out the active stuff.LOVE the keyboard / battery.
B007P4YAPK,11,2,HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6.
B007P4YAPK,11,3,Although I didn't buy it, I like the docking keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,11,4,The Galaxy also has a much nicer, more polished feel to it - wish it had the keyboard integration like the ASUS.As for the battery/keyboard, the weight balance is not very good and the unit is very top heavy/tippy because the screen is so much heavier than the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,11,5,As a long time android user, when I saw a quad core tablet with an attachable keyboard with additional battery, HDMI out, SD slot, etc.
B007P4YAPK,11,6,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,11,7,Then, 2-3 months later, the connector ports that hold the tablet to the optional keyboard started showing signs of stress.
B007P4YAPK,11,8,Given that the combo is not super thin or light, I'd gladly take on additional weight in the keyboard (maybe via bigger battery) to not have it be so tippy.Overall feel is very plasticky compared with much more polished units from Samsung.
B007P4YAPK,11,9,Power and volume buttons are slightly raised allowing you to easily access them even when it's a in case.9.
B007P4YAPK,11,10,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,11,11,Powerful and has a good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,11,12,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,11,13,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,11,14,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,11,15,They are a little faster than a laptop when first turing on, but I'm not impressed with tablets and am now researching which laptop to buy.
B007P4YAPK,11,16,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,11,17,Being able to use the keyboard was great, and the amount of extended battery life you get from it was amazing.
B007P4YAPK,11,18,The touch screen stopped responding but for awhile I could dock it to the keyboard and it would respond.
B007P4YAPK,11,19,HDMI out is a bit flaky.
B007P4YAPK,11,20,Another issue is the keyboard, while it is really nice to have and actually works well, the keyboard has 4 anti-slip rubber bumbers under it to keep it put while using it, but once you attach the tablet/monitor, the keyboard attaching pocket would have to be swung up from one end while the other end swings down below the keyboard level thus lifting the keyboard from one end making the rear 2 of the rubber anti-slip bumpers ineffective, and the unit now slips easily.
B007P4YAPK,11,21,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,11,22,I love the android slide touch keyboard that comes with it.
B007P4YAPK,11,23,Battery life is poor - I have to recharge it all the time.
B007P4YAPK,11,24,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,12,0,This is a really nice tablet with the up to date Android operating system and is easy to navigate.
B007P4YAPK,12,1,It's light, and very easy to tote around.Excellent product.
B007P4YAPK,12,2,Makes a great paper weight.
B007P4YAPK,12,3,Light and powerful.
B007P4YAPK,12,4,If you enjoy buyer's remorse, this is a product for you my friend.
B007P4YAPK,12,5,Excellent.
B007P4YAPK,12,6,Other than that, it's un-intuitive and user un-friendly to say the least.
B007P4YAPK,12,7,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,12,8,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,12,9,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,12,10,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,12,11,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,12,12,The plastic of the frame at these locations is thin and poorly made.
B007P4YAPK,12,13,Hey, I have a $10 case for it, and now it feels like leather.
B007P4YAPK,12,14,This was it... until it stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,12,15,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,12,16,Though the tablet is a great product.
B007P4YAPK,12,17,No touch screen, but with the speed diff, I will use it from now on.
B007P4YAPK,12,18,Not good when one of the touted features is the display.
B007P4YAPK,12,19,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,12,20,Best Android tablet, but quality issues.
B007P4YAPK,12,21,it's a pretty good product.
B007P4YAPK,12,22,The design is good and simplistic.
B007P4YAPK,12,23,The Galaxy also has a much nicer, more polished feel to it - wish it had the keyboard integration like the ASUS.As for the battery/keyboard, the weight balance is not very good and the unit is very top heavy/tippy because the screen is so much heavier than the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,12,24,All the great reviews made me believe this tablet might work out of the box.
B007P4YAPK,13,0,Incomplete product without a chord.
B007P4YAPK,13,1,The tablet was shipped USPS and was shipped on Tuesday.
B007P4YAPK,13,2,Good product, had shipping issues.
B007P4YAPK,13,3,I otherwise like the product it is very responsive.
B007P4YAPK,13,4,Great customer service and quick responses from this company though.
B007P4YAPK,13,5,I also paid for expedited 2 day shipping.I did NOT get 2 day expedited shipping.
B007P4YAPK,13,6,They however did not ship this product with a power supply chord but they advertised one would come with the product.
B007P4YAPK,13,7,I contacted Asus and they said it was a manufacturer defect and to return it.
B007P4YAPK,13,8,If I had known it was going to be like this, I personally would not have purchased it.
B007P4YAPK,13,9,Product needs work.
B007P4YAPK,13,10,Where is product manual.
B007P4YAPK,13,11,Faulty initial product, easy exchange.
B007P4YAPK,13,12,Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs.
B007P4YAPK,13,13,I appreciated all of the product reviews.
B007P4YAPK,13,14,Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned.
B007P4YAPK,13,15,Also Amazon provided a credit for the $3.99 shipping charge because of the issues with the carrier.
B007P4YAPK,13,16,It's ok but... Replaced my Acer Iconia A500 with this.
B007P4YAPK,13,17,ASUS support staff is hit or miss, but the replacement unit is excellent and has no issues.
B007P4YAPK,13,18,This product may be right for someone, but not me since the Android phone I currently have has the same features as this and I really do not need two devices so similar.
B007P4YAPK,13,19,After she purchased it, they told her to go to the Apple store, 20 miles away,to learn how to use the new IPAD.
B007P4YAPK,13,20,When it is outside the 30 days, Amazon will only refund a partial amount and the manufacturer warranty kicks in.
B007P4YAPK,13,21,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B007P4YAPK,13,22,This product is fairly decent.
B007P4YAPK,13,23,it's a pretty good product.
B007P4YAPK,13,24,Good product initially, Firmware update issues and terrible repair service.
B007P4YAPK,14,0,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,14,1,Its good for some things but not others.
B007P4YAPK,14,2,It was great until the last OS upgrade.
B007P4YAPK,14,3,Android tablets can't use all software.
B007P4YAPK,14,4,The Android OS is not quite up with the user interfaces we would expect with Microsoft Office or Apple products.
B007P4YAPK,14,5,I own both platforms, I love my Google TVs but the Android tablets are just not very good, mainly due to the horrible software situation.
B007P4YAPK,14,6,It is to bad, I was really beginning to love it.
B007P4YAPK,14,7,The kick backs over their must be huge because I literally just put this thing down and went back to my iphone.
B007P4YAPK,14,8,Some of the problem is probably Windows stuff but the Windows machines don't even see the tablet but the tablet sees the Windows machines.
B007P4YAPK,14,9,Again and again applications just don't take advantage of the additional screen size of the tablets.
B007P4YAPK,14,10,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,14,11,It's flat out slow compared to the iPad 3.
B007P4YAPK,14,12,however if you are planning on using this for work or school get something different.
B007P4YAPK,14,13,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,14,14,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,14,15,I had an Nexus 7 for a while as well and had the same situation with the battery and apps (although the build quality was quite good).
B007P4YAPK,14,16,This product may be right for someone, but not me since the Android phone I currently have has the same features as this and I really do not need two devices so similar.
B007P4YAPK,14,17,The app store for Apple is way better.
B007P4YAPK,14,18,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,14,19,I do love the size of it and it is easy to use, just too slow.
B007P4YAPK,14,20,Other than that, it's un-intuitive and user un-friendly to say the least.
B007P4YAPK,14,21,Went back to my iphone.
B007P4YAPK,14,22,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,14,23,The iPad is a superior device in every single way, from the screen, to performance to apps to battery life.Here's my review.I had the retina iPad for a while before I picked up this tablet, I knew it wasn't a high resolution screen going in so it wasn't a shock but I was still surprised at how quickly I got use to the iPad screen, the Transformer screen doesn't compare at all.
B007P4YAPK,14,24,Best Android tablet, but quality issues.
B007P4YAPK,15,0,The screen sensitivity is very good though.
B007P4YAPK,15,1,But about a month ago, I noticed small little blotches in my screen that are white to greyish in color, but are only visible when the screen is displaying deep blacks.
B007P4YAPK,15,2,There are several others who have had the cracked screen problem.
B007P4YAPK,15,3,Tablet two appeared to have a foreign object stuck under the glass of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,4,Screen tearing issues.
B007P4YAPK,15,5,OK, but screen not bright enough for out doors and weak WiFi signal pickup.
B007P4YAPK,15,6,My screen is horrible i cannot use it in a dark room at all it looks horrible.
B007P4YAPK,15,7,Tablet three had a dead pixel near the center of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,8,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,9,Tablet one had a stuck-on pixel close to the center of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,10,However, the second one still had a dead pixel.
B007P4YAPK,15,11,The screen brightness is fine for indoors but outdoors in daylight forget it.
B007P4YAPK,15,12,This is actually my second TF300 that has had issues with the display as the first tablet I bought had really bad problems with what looks like bad contrasts that caused my screen to make very distinct graduations between colors when they were gradually going from a black to white like a fading sensation.
B007P4YAPK,15,13,The ASUS screen brightness was also a weak point, I had to take it out of the auto brightness mode and crank it up to get a decent brightness level even indoors, when placed next to the i-pad, the sharpness and the brightness weakness of the ASUS really stood out.
B007P4YAPK,15,14,I would have been fine if the color was washed out like the bottom or bright white like the top, but the gradient just annoyed me.
B007P4YAPK,15,15,however I started experiencing some screen flickering, the task bar jumps up and down, on the left side of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,16,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,15,17,The screen quality is far superior to anything I've used previously, so I'm perfectly happy with it.
B007P4YAPK,15,18,It was perfect, until several hours of use.When I turned the device on I noticed a bright spot on the bottom of the screen but I can live with it.
B007P4YAPK,15,19,I doubt I'll ever need to use the tablet outside in bright sunlight, so I have no complaints other than the fact that there are two odd several inch horizontal smudges on the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,20,So I quickly bought an expensive screen protector since I was sure I would keep it.
B007P4YAPK,15,21,I got it from a shop, Worked well, but noticed a dead pixel on the first one.
B007P4YAPK,15,22,Looking closely I noticed a hairline crack along 3 sides of the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,15,23,Clearly there are quality issues with it!
B007P4YAPK,15,24,Somewhat related to the keys on the left side bottom.
B007P4YAPK,16,0,When I end-task on some Apps, they relaunch at same state.
B007P4YAPK,16,1,There are many ugly Apps that do not work well.
B007P4YAPK,16,2,If they are critical to the OS, then these Apps should be hidden.
B007P4YAPK,16,3,glitchy without flash.
B007P4YAPK,16,4,If I launch an app, I often have to wait up to 5 seconds before I can even interact with anything in the app.
B007P4YAPK,16,5,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,16,6,Android tablets can't use all software.
B007P4YAPK,16,7,Once an app is running and in-focus, it runs fine.
B007P4YAPK,16,8,Adobe flash player and shockwave not available so some movies, etc don't play.
B007P4YAPK,16,9,I then began setting it to my liking (e.g., arranging apps on screens, etc.
B007P4YAPK,16,10,Apps, browser and native email program freeze up all the time, probably about 10-20% of the time.3.
B007P4YAPK,16,11,NO MORE ANDROID TABLET FOR ME.
B007P4YAPK,16,12,Then I started installing apps, which at first was a joyful experience.
B007P4YAPK,16,13,I got this fixed simply installing the app "juicy defender plus"Tegra 3 compatibility issues with several games, most of them fixed after rebooting, the game just freeze after 10-15 seconds.
B007P4YAPK,16,14,Then crash, and so I uninstall the app.
B007P4YAPK,16,15,I am not talking about just app crashing, but for some reason apps cause the whole system to reboot.
B007P4YAPK,16,16,This happens for multiple apps, which is why I suspect the problem is NOT the applications.The crashing needs to be fixed.
B007P4YAPK,16,17,The tablet did a firmware update the first time I turned it on.
B007P4YAPK,16,18,Sometimes it streams ok, but majority of the time it slows and stops video stream.
B007P4YAPK,16,19,some times I get unresponsive messages, or some other times my browser just close out.Browser issues, I tried them all, skyfire, chrome, firefox beta, browser ICS, opera, dolphin all of them behave erratically randomly.Screen quality is so so, not as great as tf201 and overall not better(visually) than tf101some google play store apps/games no longer worked.
B007P4YAPK,16,20,Even YouTube videos.
B007P4YAPK,16,21,This time I'm posting a video on YOUTUBE to show them what it's doing.
B007P4YAPK,16,22,I always use it to take notes in my class and play games.
B007P4YAPK,16,23,Cold reboot is the only way to close all the Apps completely.
B007P4YAPK,16,24,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,17,0,I don't know if this usually happens with other tablets but i will never buy another asus
B007P4YAPK,17,1,ok for the money.
B007P4YAPK,17,2,I did get money back since I purchased warranty from square trade.
B007P4YAPK,17,3,Buy another brand!
B007P4YAPK,17,4,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,17,5,This was purchased expecting it to last well.
B007P4YAPK,17,6,But its really good for the price!
B007P4YAPK,17,7,I bought this in May and I waited until now to review this product so I know I have tried everything there is to it.
B007P4YAPK,17,8,When I bought it there was no re-manufactured warning, instead I guess these is a tablet returned and then resold.
B007P4YAPK,17,9,not as good as the reviews.
B007P4YAPK,17,10,Bought it refurbished.
B007P4YAPK,17,11,Properly will buy IPAD next time.
B007P4YAPK,17,12,Please do yourself a favor and don't waste your money.*****
B007P4YAPK,17,13,Overall I'm disappointed and would not buy again.
B007P4YAPK,17,14,Evidently I bought the tablet from "Amazon Wharehouse" which can not be returned after 30 days.
B007P4YAPK,17,15,My one year with the TF300T has been a very disappointing one.
B007P4YAPK,17,16,Sent both back and company refunded part of my money.
B007P4YAPK,17,17,This is likely my last ASUS purchase, but I will be using Square Trade again!I forgot to mention, ASUS has no regard toward protecting identity theft.
B007P4YAPK,17,18,It died only 6 months after purchase KEEP AWAY FROM ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,17,19,Good Tablet-Keyboard is Junk.
B007P4YAPK,17,20,I bought that tablet for my 8 years old son  to play games,  it freezes very often, my son has been keeping told me the "Tablet needs to see the doctor".
B007P4YAPK,17,21,Fortunately we purchased this with a third-party warranty.
B007P4YAPK,17,22,BUT the fact that my children are playing on my ipad more than this tablet makes me want to get my money back for it and go buy another ipad for them!!Right now - this tablet is horrible - hence why they are only getting 2 stars from me - if i could give it a 0 I probably would since we really can't even use it right now.
B007P4YAPK,17,23,It was returned to ASUS under warranty.
B007P4YAPK,17,24,I will be returning this.
B007P4YAPK,18,0,It would charge then stop charging in a contual cycle.
B007P4YAPK,18,1,I tried some temp fixes to try and get it charged again.
B007P4YAPK,18,2,Powerful and has a good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,18,3,Bad charger-seems to be a problem.... Tablet worked well until I tried to charge it after its first battery drain the first day of use.
B007P4YAPK,18,4,Another charger is $30--will I have the same problen with that one?
B007P4YAPK,18,5,Battery life is poor - I have to recharge it all the time.
B007P4YAPK,18,6,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B007P4YAPK,18,7,When the battery is very low, even if it's plugged in, you cannot turn it on for 5 minutes or so until it charges up a little (not sure this is specific to only this tablet).5.
B007P4YAPK,18,8,They all DO NOT charge when plugged in, which eventually runs down the battery in the tablet when you are trying to use both as a unit.
B007P4YAPK,18,9,The fully charged battery dies within couple of hours of continuous use.
B007P4YAPK,18,10,really wanted this to work.
B007P4YAPK,18,11,Put the charger in the freezer to reset the thermal breaker--yes it worked, so far..... Currently it is charging.
B007P4YAPK,18,12,But start from yesterday, I can't even turn on my tablet.
B007P4YAPK,18,13,After 7-9 minutes this tablet turn back to the home screen or just plane shuts down.
B007P4YAPK,18,14,This makes the battery last a maximum of an hour when you are trying to use the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,18,15,First, the tablet takes too long to get started when turn it on, slow navigation and finaly after 3 months it begun to turn on and off automatically until the battery got over.. it happened over and over again and i had to ask for a new one.
B007P4YAPK,18,16,In 3 months the tablet didn't work correctly.
B007P4YAPK,18,17,See how long the battery lasts.
B007P4YAPK,18,18,I placed an order for a new cable on Amazon.com to try while Asus take their time to replace the broken one.Startup is slow and takes a long time to charge.
B007P4YAPK,18,19,Reboot by itself and doesn't want to turn on again.
B007P4YAPK,18,20,Everything worked fine for the first night but the next day the unit began to crash on me and restart on its own will.
B007P4YAPK,18,21,Then, I need to wait for several hours in order to turn it on back.
B007P4YAPK,18,22,Without the dock it's better but still seems to drain at least 10-15% a day, meaning it will be dead within a week even if you don't use it at all.
B007P4YAPK,18,23,The tablet did a firmware update the first time I turned it on.
B007P4YAPK,18,24,I opened the box charged the tablet, when i turned it on i noticed dead pixels right away.
B007P4YAPK,19,0,Quality control issue.
B007P4YAPK,19,1,ASUS definitely needs better quality control.
B007P4YAPK,19,2,(You can get a $100 tablet from Pandigital, etc. that will stream video and audio at the same pace quality.)Also,
B007P4YAPK,19,3,hopefully Asus will get those issues fixed in time, eventually.Shame on Asus for such poor quality control in their tablets line up.
B007P4YAPK,19,4,The build quality of the unit is an issue and should be recalled.
B007P4YAPK,19,5,While the construction of mine was solid, all the other negative observations of other reviewers were immediately apparent.
B007P4YAPK,19,6,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,19,7,The touch screen is non-responsive at times and when it does work it begins to freeze, skip and jump.
B007P4YAPK,19,8,Bad video recording sound.
B007P4YAPK,19,9,Awesome tablet, plagued by quality control issues.
B007P4YAPK,19,10,The screen resolution isn't as good, but unless you're super picky there's not enough difference for it to matter.
B007P4YAPK,19,11,It's wide enough to notice easily.
B007P4YAPK,19,12,The build quality was much better, everything aligned and in place.
B007P4YAPK,19,13,On the bad side, many of the apps do not work on this, they complain that its not compatible with the device.
B007P4YAPK,19,14,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,19,15,After 7-9 minutes this tablet turn back to the home screen or just plane shuts down.
B007P4YAPK,19,16,Clearly there are quality issues with it!
B007P4YAPK,19,17,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,19,18,The applications all downloaded easily and work well, I bought an external speaker to listen through the speakers on the tablet are fine.
B007P4YAPK,19,19,I Buy ASUS TF300 in nov/2012, it is very good product... almost, I got a problem: When I video recording, it is recording the video with a whistle sound included...
B007P4YAPK,19,20,Okay... crash, restart working.
B007P4YAPK,19,21,When it does work it works well but it's so rare when that happens.
B007P4YAPK,19,22,The ASUS has a terrific screen and nice size/form matter.
B007P4YAPK,19,23,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,19,24,But I noticed the replacement has a different issue: a gap along the bezzel on the left side of the screen near the volume button.
B007P4YAPK,20,0,Especially near the forward facing camera.
B007P4YAPK,20,1,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B007P4YAPK,20,2,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,20,3,While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.
B007P4YAPK,20,4,Until Asus works out several bugs, there are better tablet choices.
B007P4YAPK,20,5,Does the auto spelling correct work well for you?
B007P4YAPK,20,6,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,20,7,My screen is horrible i cannot use it in a dark room at all it looks horrible.
B007P4YAPK,20,8,I think Asus focused more on innovation than giving this machine a soul that really gets it going.
B007P4YAPK,20,9,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B007P4YAPK,20,10,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,20,11,Everything worked fine for the first night but the next day the unit began to crash on me and restart on its own will.
B007P4YAPK,20,12,And also the internet will not convert for some reason and I have to restart it for it to connect.
B007P4YAPK,20,13,I've used some devices where that isn't the case, so it can be done, but it just doesn't feel good here.
B007P4YAPK,20,14,This especially seems true when I use Skype.
B007P4YAPK,20,15,After 7-9 minutes this tablet turn back to the home screen or just plane shuts down.
B007P4YAPK,20,16,Good value, better options available though.
B007P4YAPK,20,17,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,20,18,Okay... crash, restart working.
B007P4YAPK,20,19,Bought the tf701 everything was fine but was not impressed with it and got a Samsung Note 10.1 2014.Update...I did seem to find a fix to my problem with the ghost inputs. 2 days so far with me in control of my tablet.
B007P4YAPK,20,20,As I stated above it worked perfectly for the first 2 weeks and since...well let's list what has gone wrong.1)
B007P4YAPK,20,21,Price wise it was a good deal.One of the first few days I had it, the letter "a" just kept rolling across the screen like it was stuck.
B007P4YAPK,20,22,Not working out that way.Bluetooth and GPS and camera work great.I will fiddle with it for a few more days but atm I am undecided about this tablet.Btw, when ordering this tablet one has a choice of blue or white.
B007P4YAPK,20,23,I bought 2 of these hoping to yahoo video chat but I find out that the Asus does not support yahoo video chat.I think if I knew this I would have kept looking for a tablet that would.ASUS Transformer TF300 T-B1-BL 10.1-Inch 32 GB Tablet (Blue) ASUS TF300T-A1-CG 10.1-Inch 16GB Tablet - Gold Edition
B007P4YAPK,20,24,On the downside, the rear speaker is pretty marginal and poorly placed.
B007P4YAPK,21,0,Besides quad core the tablet is very slow in response.
B007P4YAPK,21,1,That is the same performance I expect from a tablet and this ASUS never has, not even when new.
B007P4YAPK,21,2,Too slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,3,disappointed in the performance.
B007P4YAPK,21,4,While I was not expecting the same performance of the more expensive ipad, I never expected such a poor performing tablet as the asus 300tf.
B007P4YAPK,21,5,I would expect it to do a lot and very fast but it hangs and is very slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,6,It single handedly promotes slow boot up as well as weak app performance and slow sync.
B007P4YAPK,21,7,Asus, you've gotta get all that quad core processing to work with android better!
B007P4YAPK,21,8,It does not shutdown like others have put it but I would not call it a highend quad core processor.
B007P4YAPK,21,9,No touch screen, but with the speed diff, I will use it from now on.
B007P4YAPK,21,10,Really fast responses, a couple of app crashed here and there.
B007P4YAPK,21,11,I've always gathered that Asus was among the leaders in the Android tablet game, so I'm rather disappointed.
B007P4YAPK,21,12,And it wasn't touch responsive.
B007P4YAPK,21,13,The touch screen is non-responsive at times and when it does work it begins to freeze, skip and jump.
B007P4YAPK,21,14,update:  I find the speed of this product to be too slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,15,Its ok if you use it just for that but dont expect this to do anything more.
B007P4YAPK,21,16,Just stuff like that gets pretty annoying pretty fast.
B007P4YAPK,21,17,I have to reboot the tablet periodically to regain performance.This sluggishness doesn't make it unusable.
B007P4YAPK,21,18,I find the periodic firmware updates from Asus a bit annoying as they do not really improve any of the app performances.
B007P4YAPK,21,19,The single biggest detriment contributing to my rating is the poor Wi-Fi performance.
B007P4YAPK,21,20,This tablet just isn't worth the money if you wanna waatch videos; the processor is too slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,21,I am also very disappointed with NVDia, this processor is a piece of crap.
B007P4YAPK,21,22,I've actually had this for about 9 months now, so I've been using it pretty extensively.The biggest complaint I have about this tablet: It's sluggish.
B007P4YAPK,21,23,Screen tearing issues.
B007P4YAPK,21,24,Performs well normally.
B007P4YAPK,22,0,I have no SD card installed.
B007P4YAPK,22,1,I am ordering the micro SD card to boost additionally the speed and, of course, get more memory.
B007P4YAPK,22,2,I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts.
B007P4YAPK,22,3,I aim to leave the internal memory primarily for apps and app data - I'm sure it will take many years for me to even approach filling it up.Android 4 (ICS) is an absolute joy to use, much better than I anticipated.
B007P4YAPK,22,4,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,22,5,In addition to submitting a payment form w/ credit card information, they require everyone to scan the front and back of their credit card and drivers license and include them as well.
B007P4YAPK,22,6,I am not talking about just app crashing, but for some reason apps cause the whole system to reboot.
B007P4YAPK,22,7,Plenty of storage space.
B007P4YAPK,22,8,HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6.
B007P4YAPK,22,9,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,22,10,I don't find this a problem at all.
B007P4YAPK,22,11,I would probably buy another one but from a store that you could go back to if you have problems.
B007P4YAPK,22,12,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,22,13,Buy another brand!
B007P4YAPK,22,14,The only other small problem I've had is when maximizing Youtube videos to full-screen - sometimes it doesn't play correctly, (EDIT 070612 -- the Youtube App automatically updated recently and I no longer sometimes have a problem with maximizing video - it works perfectly now every time.)I've
B007P4YAPK,22,15,from day one I have had trouble with the device being a little slow and if I let things get backed up it'll crash.
B007P4YAPK,22,16,Then crash, and so I uninstall the app.
B007P4YAPK,22,17,After a lot of headache trying to get Cyanogenmod, I gave up and put instead Cromi-X.
B007P4YAPK,22,18,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,22,19,Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you.
B007P4YAPK,22,20,Cold reboot is the only way to close all the Apps completely.
B007P4YAPK,22,21,However, after the OS get updated by JellyBean, my tablet starts to shut down (reboot) by itself.
B007P4YAPK,22,22,Restarting the device fixed the problem temporarily.
B007P4YAPK,22,23,did have a few teething problems, (nothing to do with the unit, but rather my own stupidity.)
B007P4YAPK,22,24,Okay... crash, restart working.
B007P4YAPK,23,0,Annoying problems.
B007P4YAPK,23,1,Restarting the device fixed the problem temporarily.
B007P4YAPK,23,2,First off, very quickly, the problems with the browser will not be addressed by asus.
B007P4YAPK,23,3,And also the internet will not convert for some reason and I have to restart it for it to connect.
B007P4YAPK,23,4,Now, mind you that I have a wifi router 2 feet from me and a perfect wifi connection.
B007P4YAPK,23,5,The touch screen is non-responsive at times and when it does work it begins to freeze, skip and jump.
B007P4YAPK,23,6,When it does work it works well but it's so rare when that happens.
B007P4YAPK,23,7,According to them ASUS is not doing anything to fix the problem.
B007P4YAPK,23,8,Online you will find others have had this problem with the tf300-t.
B007P4YAPK,23,9,From a cursory bit of research on the Internet, it seems that TRIM is not implemented properly, and this is what causes the performance problems.
B007P4YAPK,23,10,The web browsing on three different browsers lagged, stalled, and crashed.
B007P4YAPK,23,11,Generally the ASUS is ok, but it had a hard time picking up a strong wi-fi signal at home so the download was too slow and sometimes it would time out, while the i-pad had a full signal strength.
B007P4YAPK,23,12,Searched internet and found out this is a major problem with other users.
B007P4YAPK,23,13,They are hardware issues.
B007P4YAPK,23,14,Previously, I owned a kindle fire which was slow, a bit clunky and unresponsive while web browsing.
B007P4YAPK,23,15,Apps, browser and native email program freeze up all the time, probably about 10-20% of the time.3.
B007P4YAPK,23,16,OK, but screen not bright enough for out doors and weak WiFi signal pickup.
B007P4YAPK,23,17,It doesn't matter which browser I'm using (default browser, Firefox, Firefox Beta) it crashes.
B007P4YAPK,23,18,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,23,19,We first tried a factory reset but it did not resolve the problem.
B007P4YAPK,23,20,I am not sure if this is related to the performance problem or not, but there are always major slowdowns just before a crash-to-reboot.
B007P4YAPK,23,21,Except perhaps the toaster.This tablet crashes constantly.
B007P4YAPK,23,22,constant crashing.
B007P4YAPK,23,23,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,23,24,My wifi connection rarely registers a full signal even though I use the tablet in the same room as the router most of the time.7.
B007P4YAPK,24,0,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,24,1,Back in mid-July I was on the couch using the tablet (without the keyboard) when the touch screen just stopped responding.
B007P4YAPK,24,2,The touch screen stopped responding but for awhile I could dock it to the keyboard and it would respond.
B007P4YAPK,24,3,The touch screen is non-responsive at times and when it does work it begins to freeze, skip and jump.
B007P4YAPK,24,4,The touch screen became completely unresponsive I had to attach the keyboard so I could enter my password and log on.
B007P4YAPK,24,5,There are several others who have had the cracked screen problem.
B007P4YAPK,24,6,Kept getting touches not registering, and phantom touches registering where I wasn't touching.They sent the same unit back with the same problems.
B007P4YAPK,24,7,Problem is....even if I am not even touching that area it is now doing it.
B007P4YAPK,24,8,Faulty keyboard when it arriveed.
B007P4YAPK,24,9,After waking it up it may take 5-10 seconds before it starts responding to touching the screen.
B007P4YAPK,24,10,Another issue is the keyboard, while it is really nice to have and actually works well, the keyboard has 4 anti-slip rubber bumbers under it to keep it put while using it, but once you attach the tablet/monitor, the keyboard attaching pocket would have to be swung up from one end while the other end swings down below the keyboard level thus lifting the keyboard from one end making the rear 2 of the rubber anti-slip bumpers ineffective, and the unit now slips easily.
B007P4YAPK,24,11,Although I didn't buy it, I like the docking keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,24,12,It would also cause the virtual keyboard to shake up and down rapidly.2.
B007P4YAPK,24,13,Other times, I need to click, click, click click click.
B007P4YAPK,24,14,And it wasn't touch responsive.
B007P4YAPK,24,15,If I touch in the top left corner of the screen it will bring the power off message up and reboot.
B007P4YAPK,24,16,The touchscreen problems hardly ever happen now, but they do still happen.
B007P4YAPK,24,17,Put it on the dock crash.
B007P4YAPK,24,18,I still like it but not enough to warrant the $750 I now have invested in it and the docking keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,24,19,Okay... crash, restart working.
B007P4YAPK,24,20,And in several games, the tablet frequently stutters or pauses for several seconds in the middle of it all.Tablet touch sensitivity:The tablet has a very hard time registering clicks.
B007P4YAPK,24,21,I have seen NONE of these types of crashes on my galaxy S2.-I understand this is a review for the tablet, but my keyboard dock has stopped functioning.
B007P4YAPK,24,22,It is not software related, as the "power off" message comes up on the screen..if I tap off of it to make it go away it comes right back...and then it reboots.
B007P4YAPK,24,23,I didn't get the keyboard attachment for this tablet so I can not speak to that.
B007P4YAPK,24,24,I would press buttons a few times before the tablet would compute the demand.
B007P4YAPK,25,0,I then began setting it to my liking (e.g., arranging apps on screens, etc.
B007P4YAPK,25,1,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,25,2,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,25,3,There are many ugly Apps that do not work well.
B007P4YAPK,25,4,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,25,5,When not frozen, tapping an app would sometimes work, but more often would execute an entirely different app (note they were not at all near each other on the screen).
B007P4YAPK,25,6,All the great reviews made me believe this tablet might work out of the box.
B007P4YAPK,25,7,Below is a review of several tablets I tried in MY chronological sequence with them, with explanations of why I rejected all but the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,25,8,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B007P4YAPK,25,9,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,25,10,All the other features of this tablet can be compared favorably with all other apps on the market.
B007P4YAPK,25,11,The iPad is a superior device in every single way, from the screen, to performance to apps to battery life.Here's my review.I had the retina iPad for a while before I picked up this tablet, I knew it wasn't a high resolution screen going in so it wasn't a shock but I was still surprised at how quickly I got use to the iPad screen, the Transformer screen doesn't compare at all.
B007P4YAPK,25,12,On the bad side, many of the apps do not work on this, they complain that its not compatible with the device.
B007P4YAPK,25,13,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,25,14,Android should not feel this "beta" given this is a 2nd generation Android tablet and Android itself has been around for years now.
B007P4YAPK,25,15,Asus TF300 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,25,16,I liked it and bought another only to have it start doing the same thing on and off and no I was not Hacked.
B007P4YAPK,25,17,But I noticed the replacement has a different issue: a gap along the bezzel on the left side of the screen near the volume button.
B007P4YAPK,25,18,asus tf300.
B007P4YAPK,25,19,But comparing this to the iPad 2, why should I put up with this behavior?
B007P4YAPK,25,20,Not sure if this is a hardware issue or an Android issue but I'm baffled at the sluggishness of the thing.
B007P4YAPK,25,21,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,25,22,The ASUS has a terrific screen and nice size/form matter.
B007P4YAPK,25,23,On paper this seems like a great tab i was trying to decide between the galaxy tab2 10.1 an the asus transformer .tf300
B007P4YAPK,25,24,Should have bought the Galaxy Tab 2 instead.
B007P4YAPK,26,0,Plugging in a micro hdmi cord was a little difficult due to this, and I am sure the port would break off if i did it often.
B007P4YAPK,26,1,Issues with charger cable - loose fit.
B007P4YAPK,26,2,Even the center port, where the tablet actually interacts with the keyboard cracked.
B007P4YAPK,26,3,We are not all computer savvy.
B007P4YAPK,26,4,I am sure I wouldn't notice it if I didn't look extremely carefully, and it wasn't much of a problem to me but the hdmi port was misaligned from its socket!
B007P4YAPK,26,5,It would charge then stop charging in a contual cycle.
B007P4YAPK,26,6,should be a mini-tutorial or a better pamphlet of instructions included with the purchase.
B007P4YAPK,26,7,Once the plastic adjacent the hinge broke off, the hinge was very loose and damaged the connector between the keyboard and the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,26,8,This eventually led to a small crack along the back of the tablet between the two ports.
B007P4YAPK,26,9,I need support to get to the tablet to meet its performance capabilities.The tablet itself is powerful and fun.
B007P4YAPK,26,10,I had to separately order a power supply chord because without the chord I can only use it until it ran out of power.
B007P4YAPK,26,11,This is likely my last ASUS purchase, but I will be using Square Trade again!I forgot to mention, ASUS has no regard toward protecting identity theft.
B007P4YAPK,26,12,I placed an order for a new cable on Amazon.com to try while Asus take their time to replace the broken one.Startup is slow and takes a long time to charge.
B007P4YAPK,26,13,How the wear was so great as to cause cracking of plastic is beyond me.
B007P4YAPK,26,14,They all DO NOT charge when plugged in, which eventually runs down the battery in the tablet when you are trying to use both as a unit.
B007P4YAPK,26,15,The touch screen stopped responding but for awhile I could dock it to the keyboard and it would respond.
B007P4YAPK,26,16,Approximately 3-4 months after purchase, my tablet would reboot by itself whenever I touched it.
B007P4YAPK,26,17,Though the tablet is a great product.
B007P4YAPK,26,18,I like the idea of the keyboard dock with the mouse and I like that you can hook-up things like blue-tooth gaming pads - that is something the iPad really needs to allow, both the mouse if you have a keyboard attached and game pads.Summary - buy an iPad - it's better in every way.
B007P4YAPK,26,19,Then, 2-3 months later, the connector ports that hold the tablet to the optional keyboard started showing signs of stress.
B007P4YAPK,26,20,Unfortunately the day after I got it, I went to plug the tablet into the keyboard dock and it wouldn't click.
B007P4YAPK,26,21,Within 9 months, the plastic rim near the hinge started to break off.
B007P4YAPK,26,22,ASUS does not stand behind their products.
B007P4YAPK,26,23,Yes, for the Asus you can buy the keyboard and attach it to the tablet, but then I might have well just bought a laptop (which is what I'm looking for now).I tried a couple of games on it.
B007P4YAPK,26,24,seven months after buying it and the dock, it's broken.
B007P4YAPK,27,0,Screen tearing issues.
B007P4YAPK,27,1,I liked it and bought another only to have it start doing the same thing on and off and no I was not Hacked.
B007P4YAPK,27,2,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,27,3,Screen tearing started occurring within a couple of days.
B007P4YAPK,27,4,I had my tablet for almost 2 months so it is too late for me to return it.
B007P4YAPK,27,5,from day one I have had trouble with the device being a little slow and if I let things get backed up it'll crash.
B007P4YAPK,27,6,I tried to "factory reset" and "cool boot" it and it is still has the same issue.
B007P4YAPK,27,7,But start from yesterday, I can't even turn on my tablet.
B007P4YAPK,27,8,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,27,9,Once I turned it back on, it was fine and it never happened again.It had a GPS, but the only time it would show me my location was when I would connected to a Wifi signal.
B007P4YAPK,27,10,Restarting the device fixed the problem temporarily.
B007P4YAPK,27,11,And there really is no dearth of tablet specific apps on Android, that's just a myth now.I have returned my device as of now but will be ordering another soon.
B007P4YAPK,27,12,Got this tablet a week back.
B007P4YAPK,27,13,I really can't point out the pros and cons at this point.
B007P4YAPK,27,14,Reboot by itself and doesn't want to turn on again.
B007P4YAPK,27,15,Not sure if this is a hardware issue or an Android issue but I'm baffled at the sluggishness of the thing.
B007P4YAPK,27,16,I even did a factory reset to make sure there wasn't an issue, but it's exactly the same.
B007P4YAPK,27,17,When I bought it there was no re-manufactured warning, instead I guess these is a tablet returned and then resold.
B007P4YAPK,27,18,Seems there's a factory glitch that it shuts itself off and on every couple minutes.
B007P4YAPK,27,19,The touch screen is non-responsive at times and when it does work it begins to freeze, skip and jump.
B007P4YAPK,27,20,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,27,21,some minor issues.
B007P4YAPK,27,22,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,27,23,It disappeared after some time without using it.
B007P4YAPK,27,24,After 7-9 minutes this tablet turn back to the home screen or just plane shuts down.
B007P4YAPK,28,0,Tweaked Out with no Support.
B007P4YAPK,28,1,I called customer support and they were no help.
B007P4YAPK,28,2,It was returned to ASUS under warranty.
B007P4YAPK,28,3,Poor customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,4,I have not called customer service yet as I keep hoping they will fix these issues with another update.
B007P4YAPK,28,5,I sent the unit in for repair and it was returned without the problems being addressed.
B007P4YAPK,28,6,Product needs work.
B007P4YAPK,28,7,I received the tablet and a few days later had problems with it.
B007P4YAPK,28,8,According to them ASUS is not doing anything to fix the problem.
B007P4YAPK,28,9,RETURNED
B007P4YAPK,28,10,Not sure why this happened so i did a hard reset and called the customer support which was terrible and of no help which i could not find online.
B007P4YAPK,28,11,Of course, the Amazon return window had expired about a week before so I contacted ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,28,12,Also Amazon provided a credit for the $3.99 shipping charge because of the issues with the carrier.
B007P4YAPK,28,13,By then it was too late to return the device.
B007P4YAPK,28,14,After a week this problem began to worsen and after two weeks the screen became unusable.
B007P4YAPK,28,15,Thankfully, I also bought a Squaretrade warranty for my unit at the time of my tablet purchase so I contacted them and they are currently processing a full refund for me after receiving my unit and stating that a repair is not possible.If
B007P4YAPK,28,16,I called Amazon and they don't currenty have one in stock so their advise is to chack back in a week or so maybe they can do an exchange then.
B007P4YAPK,28,17,I sent it in to ASUS for review and they stated - "Nothing found - no repairs necessary."
B007P4YAPK,28,18,did have a few teething problems, (nothing to do with the unit, but rather my own stupidity.)
B007P4YAPK,28,19,Update *****After sending the unit in a second time (between both, I was without it for around a month), they finally sent it back mostly fixed.
B007P4YAPK,28,20,I placed an order for a new cable on Amazon.com to try while Asus take their time to replace the broken one.Startup is slow and takes a long time to charge.
B007P4YAPK,28,21,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B007P4YAPK,28,22,I called ASUS and they issued an RMA, stating that it was likely a short in the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,28,23,So far I've sent it in to ASUS for repair twice (and going back for the third time today) - but they still haven't been able to fix it.
B007P4YAPK,28,24,I will probably return it if ASUS doesn't reply to my request for a replacement cable.
B007P4YAPK,29,0,Some of the problem is probably Windows stuff but the Windows machines don't even see the tablet but the tablet sees the Windows machines.
B007P4YAPK,29,1,I've also seen it scroll across 2 or more screens when I only want to scroll across 1, or just completely drop scrolling actions.
B007P4YAPK,29,2,I can't tell if all of these issues are completely software or issues with the tablet input itself, but the end result is a very frustrating navigation experience.Stability:My tablet crashes at least once daily.
B007P4YAPK,29,3,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,29,4,Networks are always a pain.The hardware seems to work great but the software is weak.
B007P4YAPK,29,5,Cold reboot is the only way to close all the Apps completely.
B007P4YAPK,29,6,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,29,7,There are many ugly Apps that do not work well.
B007P4YAPK,29,8,A few more tweaks (using Xposed to force the launcher and the browser to stay resident) makes for a satisfying experience.
B007P4YAPK,29,9,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,29,10,The touch screen is non-responsive at times and when it does work it begins to freeze, skip and jump.
B007P4YAPK,29,11,Other than that so far I've experienced a few automatic reboots when trying to use various apps and many system hangs that require force closes.
B007P4YAPK,29,12,They do not immediately start scrolling when touched like on safari, there is a slight annoying delay, and when you zoom in and out, there is rendering lag.
B007P4YAPK,29,13,I have to awkwardly use my left index finger, and even then a lot of the motion gets dropped or garbled.
B007P4YAPK,29,14,There is no way to end-task completely.
B007P4YAPK,29,15,After a lot of headache trying to get Cyanogenmod, I gave up and put instead Cromi-X.
B007P4YAPK,29,16,When things work properly, this tablet is very fast.Unfortunately, things do not work properly a lot of the time.
B007P4YAPK,29,17,Some games that require you to use 2 thumbs (one for navigation, the other for actions like shooting) are completely confused by any movements I make with my left thumb.
B007P4YAPK,29,18,Other times, I need to click, click, click click click.
B007P4YAPK,29,19,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,29,20,Okay... crash, restart working.
B007P4YAPK,29,21,I then began setting it to my liking (e.g., arranging apps on screens, etc.
B007P4YAPK,29,22,But mine wasn't the normal situation.
B007P4YAPK,29,23,There are several others who have had the cracked screen problem.
B007P4YAPK,29,24,They are all terrible.
