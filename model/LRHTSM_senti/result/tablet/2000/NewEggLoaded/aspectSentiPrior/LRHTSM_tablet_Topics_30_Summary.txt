B008DWG5HE,0,0,love it!
B008DWG5HE,0,1,love it but....
B008DWG5HE,0,2,Love everything about it.
B008DWG5HE,0,3,I loved my new tablet.
B008DWG5HE,0,4,I really love this device (using it right now).
B008DWG5HE,0,5,Love this tablet way better than an ipad!
B008DWG5HE,0,6,I love the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,0,7,I love it!
B008DWG5HE,0,8,is really good the read books.
B008DWG5HE,0,9,For those who wants to use this device to read.
B008DWG5HE,0,10,I suggest you buy amazon kindle fire HD, although there's no S-pen.
B008DWG5HE,0,11,Like, but not in love yet.
B008DWG5HE,0,12,i like the multi screen and  the resolution es good my be in mucho better iPad screen  but is  more productive that other tablet
B008DWG5HE,0,13,You don;'t need to read big reviews  to know that this tablet is better than apple !but can be better !
B008DWG5HE,0,14,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,0,15,I had a Xoom for almost 2 years and loved it.
B008DWG5HE,0,16,I loved it!!impressed with the speed and set up.
B008DWG5HE,0,17,But if I use this device, I cannot see the character clearly.
B008DWG5HE,0,18,Larger screen for reading, magazine viewing and pictures than a Nook.
B008DWG5HE,0,19,THIS NOTE BOOK SOUNDED LIKE A GOOD DEAL AND HAS MORE THAN WHAT I REALLY NEED BUT WANT TO LEARN WHAT THIS TABLETS GOT TO OFFER.
B008DWG5HE,0,20,I'm on my second book out of a 3 book series using the Kindle app.
B008DWG5HE,0,21,Also, it keeps my eyes happy with the 10.1 inch screen.
B008DWG5HE,0,22,I read both James Bowen's books without noticing any problems whatsoever.
B008DWG5HE,0,23,Colors are bright, text is crisp when viewed like you would normally, and 720p (HD) videos look fantastic.
B008DWG5HE,0,24,We`ve gone from black and white to 12" color TVs all the way to easily available 60" LED TVs....why would I want to revert to a 10" screen to watch movies etc....that`s what my 42" is for.
B008DWG5HE,1,0,Other apps can give you .psd
B008DWG5HE,1,1,it great.
B008DWG5HE,1,2,Although 16:9 is great for video and gaming.
B008DWG5HE,1,3,I found it logical for the most part.The app selection seems very good.
B008DWG5HE,1,4,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,1,5,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,1,6,It's only for S Note app.  - Multiscreen feature can only be used with few built-in apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,7,When I got the device I expected to be able to have any 2 apps running at the same time, so I could watch Netflix while using IMDB, etc.  Thus far, I have only found one or two apps from the market that support the split screen function.-
B008DWG5HE,1,8,You can always browse the Google Play store before buying the tablet to see if what you want is there (although not all apps are supported by all devices- I learned sadly the Popcap games there are not supported for this tablet).
B008DWG5HE,1,9,opening apps & navagating around the O/S- able to play the HD .mkv
B008DWG5HE,1,10,It also supports Nook and Kindle (and I'm sure others) so you can shop at other app stores too for your games, music, movies, books, etc, you are not tied just to Google.I think this tablet is a great size for reading, I generally tilt it sideways for browsing the web or reading.
B008DWG5HE,1,11,I love the android platform,  this will get 5 stars when they get an app for amazon instant.
B008DWG5HE,1,12,Only selected Samsung apps work in multi app mode.
B008DWG5HE,1,13,I managed to set up this tablet using a few productivity apps for work and the apps cost me nothing.Pros: Huge number of apps available on play store that are built for tablet use.
B008DWG5HE,1,14,The handwriting app is good.
B008DWG5HE,1,15,IR good for tv remote which works great btw, no waiting to sync up each time app closes/reopens.
B008DWG5HE,1,16,I wud like there to be more apps for the S pen since I find the Snote kind of limited when it comes about doing diagrams and flowcharts (if anyone can recommend me an app to do so id be thankful) Another thing is that i dont know how to save the snotes i make when open it from the mini apps, say im using the kindle app reading and i want to take some notes then i close the snote and there s no way i can re open it again with what i had written down before.
B008DWG5HE,1,17,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,18,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B008DWG5HE,1,19,However, I did try to set up the TV remote feature and for some reason it partly worked and then did not work at all.
B008DWG5HE,1,20,I had about 100 apps installed and 2 widgets on the home screen.
B008DWG5HE,1,21,This tablet is a great size.
B008DWG5HE,1,22,I wanted a tablet that had a 10.1" screen, could play HD .mkv
B008DWG5HE,1,23,But hey that's what Google is for.
B008DWG5HE,1,24,While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps.
B008DWG5HE,2,0,Great.
B008DWG5HE,2,1,Great Tablet, Very Happy!
B008DWG5HE,2,2,Great tablet but do your research before buying.
B008DWG5HE,2,3,GO REFURBISHED...THE PRODUCT WAS AS GOOD AS NEW...SAVE MONEY...BE HAPPY...!!! Love the product.
B008DWG5HE,2,4,For the price I paid, I am happy with this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,2,5,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,2,6,From one artist to any others out there, do not buy this product.
B008DWG5HE,2,7,I am very happy with this purchase.
B008DWG5HE,2,8,This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device.
B008DWG5HE,2,9,I love it!
B008DWG5HE,2,10,Got this as a gift for my sister.
B008DWG5HE,2,11,I am happy.
B008DWG5HE,2,12,Great tablet for the money.
B008DWG5HE,2,13,I bought this before I went on Vacation last summer, So I have now owned it for about 9 months.
B008DWG5HE,2,14,Since I've purchased this tablet I can't put it down.
B008DWG5HE,2,15,I bought this for my son to use.
B008DWG5HE,2,16,love it!
B008DWG5HE,2,17,I went to Best Buy several times to poke at this tablet before deciding to buy.
B008DWG5HE,2,18,I compared prices and specification and of course Amazon price won!
B008DWG5HE,2,19,This is my first purchase of a tablet and I choose Samsung Galaxy note 10.1 ( I was thinking about this for over an year and trying to get it at the right time and price).
B008DWG5HE,2,20,Love this tablet way better than an ipad!
B008DWG5HE,2,21,Got this tablet for my husband as a gift and for 6 months it was great and he was extremely happy with it.
B008DWG5HE,2,22,I'm happy.
B008DWG5HE,2,23,I got the Samsung because I am not happy with the iPhone4s and Apple....so I didn't want to get an iPad.
B008DWG5HE,2,24,I expected this product to last for at least a couple of years.
B008DWG5HE,3,0,It had ample battery life sufficient for my use.
B008DWG5HE,3,1,Battery doesn't last long.
B008DWG5HE,3,2,Long battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,3,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,3,4,Battery life excellent.
B008DWG5HE,3,5,Battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,6,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,3,7,Always seems like we are charging it.
B008DWG5HE,3,8,See how long the battery lasts.
B008DWG5HE,3,9,Battery seems to last pretty long.
B008DWG5HE,3,10,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B008DWG5HE,3,11,I think I was down to 77% or something so battery life should be fine.
B008DWG5HE,3,12,The battery doesn't last that long as I would have liked but that's fine with me.
B008DWG5HE,3,13,Same usage as entry 1) above, except at 30% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 10 hours.
B008DWG5HE,3,14,Pretty good.Thus, as you can see, the battery life seems to depend heavily on how brightly the screen is set.
B008DWG5HE,3,15,Battery drain seems faster than iPad.
B008DWG5HE,3,16,The battery does seem to do well and I had the screen pretty bright and working on a digital sketch for about 2 hours.
B008DWG5HE,3,17,I don't really use the Note features but so far battery life is decent, speed is quite good for an older model and the tablet is pretty light.
B008DWG5HE,3,18,If you are playing a game the battery goes low way to quick.
B008DWG5HE,3,19,home page takes about 15 seconds to fully load.Battery:I timed various usages with a chronometer and this is what I found:1) 1-1/2 hour of video at 100% brightness, 1 hour of internet with wifi on, the rest of the time using polaris office and s-note side-by-side at 60% brightness, power saving mode off - battery only lasted 6-1/2 hours.
B008DWG5HE,3,20,But, Alas! after plugging the charger in for a couple of hours and seeing a battery charge symbol on the screen I elected to turn in on and________---------________ Nothing!
B008DWG5HE,3,21,I have to charge pretty much every other day and at times daily if I use it a lot.
B008DWG5HE,3,22,The display is nice and bright and the unit can be used even outside on a sunny day.
B008DWG5HE,3,23,Definitely not good.2) Continual looping the movie "Immortals" at 50% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 9 hours.
B008DWG5HE,3,24,It also supports Bluetooth.I was very impressed with the battery life.
B008DWG5HE,4,0,i like the multi screen and  the resolution es good my be in mucho better iPad screen  but is  more productive that other tablet
B008DWG5HE,4,1,And the sound quality and volume were excellent.
B008DWG5HE,4,2,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,4,3,The build quality is fine.
B008DWG5HE,4,4,Feature-Packed Tablet, Better than Expected.
B008DWG5HE,4,5,I sincerely believe they could have built a better tablet than this (at the price they are asking for it).
B008DWG5HE,4,6,Build quality is top notch.
B008DWG5HE,4,7,Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine.
B008DWG5HE,4,8,OK, let;s get it over with, the screen isn't as high resolution as the Apple, but it;s pretty good.
B008DWG5HE,4,9,Great tablet, but would be better if it was cheaper.
B008DWG5HE,4,10,Solid product with great screen.
B008DWG5HE,4,11,I still think they could be louder on tablets but this design is a  good start.8.
B008DWG5HE,4,12,The screen is excellent.
B008DWG5HE,4,13,Other than that, it seems to be put together tightly, and it looks fine, it's just not as good as you would expect from a high end tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,14,great.
B008DWG5HE,4,15,The speakers are great, and the pen with s note makes this tablet better than the rest.
B008DWG5HE,4,16,Speakers stereo separation is very good but the lower frequency sound is poor.6.
B008DWG5HE,4,17,is really good the read books.
B008DWG5HE,4,18,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,4,19,You should have not issues covering the speakers with your hands.Build Quality - GOOD - Nice fit and finish, no loose parts, no surprises.
B008DWG5HE,4,20,But to those people I also ask, wouldnt it be much better, or wouldnt you feel like you got your money's worth more if it had a solid metal backing, or maybe even a better screen res?
B008DWG5HE,4,21,But the two things that are holding it back, in my opinion is the cheap build quality and screen res.
B008DWG5HE,4,22,The display is nice and bright3.
B008DWG5HE,4,23,Text is nice and crisp, HD movies look great.
B008DWG5HE,4,24,However, I keep mine in the Samsung case (sold separately), so the build deficits aren't noticeable.Speakers:Placing stereo speakers at opposite edges of the screen facing forward is a great idea, except the speakers aren't loud enough and have a tinny sound.
B008DWG5HE,5,0,picture great sound!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,5,1,What it has works great!
B008DWG5HE,5,2,- Camera is awesome under normal light.
B008DWG5HE,5,3,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,5,4,It is easy to use, and the screen/display is great!
B008DWG5HE,5,5,The only issue I could see was no HD display and the rear camera could have been a little better.
B008DWG5HE,5,6,It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something.
B008DWG5HE,5,7,However, I also need to present pictures on it and the 7" might have been too small for that.
B008DWG5HE,5,8,For low lighted scenarios, quality of photo may go down.
B008DWG5HE,5,9,It seems required for any portable device to have a camera nowadays, and both front and back are there, but the photos aren't great.
B008DWG5HE,5,10,So I didn't send it back.Great device love it my kids love it.great
B008DWG5HE,5,11,This tablet gets the basics right: a high quality, bright screen, and fast processor.
B008DWG5HE,5,12,Great camera for video and still shooting.
B008DWG5HE,5,13,But from the demos I have watched I think it will be fun!A few things to consider though before purchasing...first, the camera doesn't take the greatest pictures.
B008DWG5HE,5,14,It works great and can be used for games and help with his homework.
B008DWG5HE,5,15,Amazingly fast and responsive!
B008DWG5HE,5,16,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B008DWG5HE,5,17,I have not played with the S pen yet because I want to get a screen protector first.
B008DWG5HE,5,18,The camera takes nice pictures.
B008DWG5HE,5,19,Just trying to find a decent tablet can be taxing with all the options and issues.
B008DWG5HE,5,20,Its still a good feature if you don't have super high expectations.The camera is adequate, but unimpressive.
B008DWG5HE,5,21,i like the multi screen and  the resolution es good my be in mucho better iPad screen  but is  more productive that other tablet
B008DWG5HE,5,22,Its thin and uses Gorilla Glass.
B008DWG5HE,5,23,great tablet with some flaws.
B008DWG5HE,5,24,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,6,0,Amazingly fast and responsive!
B008DWG5HE,6,1,Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.
B008DWG5HE,6,2,Don't expect a quad core to be amazingly faster than a dual core, but it can handle concurrent tasks with aplomb.Cons:1.
B008DWG5HE,6,3,But if you hate lag, you'll love a quad core because there's just about always enough processor for whatever the device is doing.
B008DWG5HE,6,4,i like the multi screen and  the resolution es good my be in mucho better iPad screen  but is  more productive that other tablet
B008DWG5HE,6,5,Now I would be the first to say that I probably will never truly task a quad core to its max potential.
B008DWG5HE,6,6,This tablet gets the basics right: a high quality, bright screen, and fast processor.
B008DWG5HE,6,7,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,6,8,would like more smooth and good resolution.
B008DWG5HE,6,9,Stylus integration is great,just not enough good apps out yet for it.
B008DWG5HE,6,10,OK, let;s get it over with, the screen isn't as high resolution as the Apple, but it;s pretty good.
B008DWG5HE,6,11,The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.
B008DWG5HE,6,12,The screen is excellent.
B008DWG5HE,6,13,Solid product with great screen.
B008DWG5HE,6,14,Text is nice and crisp, HD movies look great.
B008DWG5HE,6,15,I've used several tablets and smart phones with different processors and the best in my opinion is a quad core.
B008DWG5HE,6,16,The display is nice and bright3.
B008DWG5HE,6,17,Many tablet cameras are doing 1080p video.Multitasking: Side-By-Side windowing works only with Samsung apps, and the concept doesn't work that well in execution since you can't interact with both windows simultaneously.
B008DWG5HE,6,18,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,6,19,This tablet has a fast processor.
B008DWG5HE,6,20,They expect you to buy all their high priced video games and movies in their Play Store.
B008DWG5HE,6,21,Apple does a great job of innovating and packaging hardware and software.
B008DWG5HE,6,22,The screen is fine.2.5.
B008DWG5HE,6,23,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,6,24,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,7,0,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,1,not really 32 GB.
B008DWG5HE,7,2,Free Dropbox storage is only 2 gig.
B008DWG5HE,7,3,I bought the "32 GB" version but it really only has 26 GB of total memory - about 24 of which are available with the product out of the box.
B008DWG5HE,7,4,I purchased the 16 gig version of the tablet along with a 32 gig SD card for just that purpose, only to find out that I can't do that.
B008DWG5HE,7,5,I bought the 16-gs, because it was cheap, now 32 gs is cheaper, if you want it buy this tablet,  buy the  32gs,,,, because the aps can not be moved to sd memory ,, I have the 16gs, and I have little memory and it sucks,but the tablet works good
B008DWG5HE,7,6,you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory?
B008DWG5HE,7,7,What is best about this product is the 32gb of storage.
B008DWG5HE,7,8,Haven't yet figured out how to put files onto the SD chip instead of the internal drive.The tablet comes with a two year 50 Gig access to Dropbox (file storage).
B008DWG5HE,7,9,The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,10,If I had known that, I would've purchased the 32 gig version of the tablet.Overall, I think that this is an excellent tablet, and there's a lot of potential.
B008DWG5HE,7,11,SD card slot usles.
B008DWG5HE,7,12,I opted for the increased memory model because I wanted to feel as if I had the option for more memory.For traveling, it's great.
B008DWG5HE,7,13,The only thing to be aware of is some things will only work or want to go on the internal memory, and like any storage drive, the number is a lie.
B008DWG5HE,7,14,You can do some things with Polaris Office which is very nice as long as you put any of your work on a microsd card.
B008DWG5HE,7,15,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,16,I did some reading and decided on the 16GB since the tablet has space for ample expansion, and you can get a far larger micro SD card for the $50 difference- I got the 64GB SanDisk class 10 one.
B008DWG5HE,7,17,I bought one and discover it wired without data SIM , I never saw even a note about that no sim card this really wired
B008DWG5HE,7,18,I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.
B008DWG5HE,7,19,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,7,20,You actually start with more like 11.6GB free space after the OS and whatnot, and 59.5GB on the card (I'm not sure why about that, I think it may have come with stuff on it).
B008DWG5HE,7,21,I was able to move over my music, video files, and other docs I wanted access to and still have a good amount of space left.I also already use Dropbox and love it.
B008DWG5HE,7,22,Thinner and lighter than my old iPad 2, I prefer keeping it in a case to avoid any issues with dropping/dinging it.In terms of peripherals - You can use up to a 64GB micro SD card with this tablet, which is one of the reasons I went with the 16GB instead of 32GB version (check the price difference between the extra GB edition vs microSD pricing).
B008DWG5HE,7,23,I also hope more apps will continue to appear to support the S-pen.So, here's a rundown of some features:I love that it had a micro SD expansion slot.
B008DWG5HE,7,24,It did not disappoint.Firstly, this tablet is fast, really fast.
B008DWG5HE,8,0,WIFI ONLY.
B008DWG5HE,8,1,Good Device.
B008DWG5HE,8,2,For those who wants to use this device to read.
B008DWG5HE,8,3,It's portable, fast and works well in a mobile environment.
B008DWG5HE,8,4,I like this device a lot.
B008DWG5HE,8,5,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,8,6,You also can not connect your printer either via WIFI or direct.
B008DWG5HE,8,7,If you want a video player/gamer just for a bigger screen than your phone, then I would look elsewhere.
B008DWG5HE,8,8,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,8,9,I still like it and will make some time to work with it more.
B008DWG5HE,8,10,But if I use this device, I cannot see the character clearly.
B008DWG5HE,8,11,Moderate use would not include near constant video watching and gaming, but reading, web surfing and some rather light gaming.4.
B008DWG5HE,8,12,Video chatting works great as well.
B008DWG5HE,8,13,It is a useful device for lightweight traveling.
B008DWG5HE,8,14,I will say that for a tablet this thing is AWESOME.
B008DWG5HE,8,15,All webpages should be functional on mobile devices.
B008DWG5HE,8,16,Good for lightweight traveling.
B008DWG5HE,8,17,It says in the settings that it's connected to the school network, but when I try to access the internet, it doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,8,18,I think it's easy to use and has everything you need for anything you want.
B008DWG5HE,8,19,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,8,20,When I got the device I expected to be able to have any 2 apps running at the same time, so I could watch Netflix while using IMDB, etc.  Thus far, I have only found one or two apps from the market that support the split screen function.-
B008DWG5HE,8,21,Across the board tablets do not fulfill all the aspects of computing that a laptop or desktop computer might, and for those aspects that they do fulfill, the tend to do so with some caveats.
B008DWG5HE,8,22,I actually see absolutely no problem with the graphics from the few videos I have watched.
B008DWG5HE,8,23,I would recommend this device to all road warriors.
B008DWG5HE,8,24,i like the multi screen and  the resolution es good my be in mucho better iPad screen  but is  more productive that other tablet
B008DWG5HE,9,0,It's very responsive and sublime to touch.
B008DWG5HE,9,1,Nice Unit.
B008DWG5HE,9,2,Bought the case from Poetic and well you can't tell what it's made of in a case...4.
B008DWG5HE,9,3,Be careful about screen protectors: most are "squishy" and so don't really work with the stylus.
B008DWG5HE,9,4,Please tell me you are working hard... Photoshop touch is nice but it ain't illustrator.I use Note pretty much indoors, so I am not in the position to tell people whether the screen is bright outside.
B008DWG5HE,9,5,Good tablet for 2012.
B008DWG5HE,9,6,The screen is excellent.
B008DWG5HE,9,7,It is smooth, fast, nice looking, and has the S-Pen.
B008DWG5HE,9,8,sPen and Photoshop Touch.
B008DWG5HE,9,9,Haptic feedback is nice touch to this ipad user.
B008DWG5HE,9,10,The protector looks great (little glare), works fine with the S-pen, and wasn't too hard to get on without bubbles.
B008DWG5HE,9,11,Awesome screen allows for great graphics.
B008DWG5HE,9,12,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,9,13,Stylus integration is great,just not enough good apps out yet for it.
B008DWG5HE,9,14,The screen is fine.2.5.
B008DWG5HE,9,15,i like the multi screen and  the resolution es good my be in mucho better iPad screen  but is  more productive that other tablet
B008DWG5HE,9,16,The display is nice and bright and the unit can be used even outside on a sunny day.
B008DWG5HE,9,17,I should have bought an Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,9,18,However, it needs a real keyboard.
B008DWG5HE,9,19,The handwriting app is good.
B008DWG5HE,9,20,I hate virtual keyboards.
B008DWG5HE,9,21,I also dabble in art (I'm no artist) and the S-Pen is great.
B008DWG5HE,9,22,The display is nice and bright3.
B008DWG5HE,9,23,Other tablets support a stylus, but they all have a rounded rubber end or a clear plastic disc around the point if it is fine, because the touch technology works differently for those tablets.
B008DWG5HE,9,24,Because S-pen is not that useful.I returned it after one day because of the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,10,0,Works great.
B008DWG5HE,10,1,good produict and works very well.
B008DWG5HE,10,2,In few works !
B008DWG5HE,10,3,What it has works great!
B008DWG5HE,10,4,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,5,Work and Home Companion.
B008DWG5HE,10,6,great.
B008DWG5HE,10,7,This tablet is a great size.
B008DWG5HE,10,8,It is beautiful and works great!
B008DWG5HE,10,9,Great in some ways.
B008DWG5HE,10,10,I have only had this for a month, but it seems like a great product.
B008DWG5HE,10,11,This tablet works very well and has many nice features.
B008DWG5HE,10,12,Great Hardware.
B008DWG5HE,10,13,And it works as advertised.
B008DWG5HE,10,14,Great Hardware hampered by inferior software.
B008DWG5HE,10,15,Perfect tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,16,HUGE improvement over G Tab 2.Compass - Worked great.
B008DWG5HE,10,17,Solid product with great screen.
B008DWG5HE,10,18,it great.
B008DWG5HE,10,19,No Flashplayer operation.....I wanted this instead of the Apple iPad...now its just like the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,10,20,This is a great device and very useful for teaching and other such tasks.
B008DWG5HE,10,21,Great product good price, does all it is was meant to do. will do business with this vendlor once again
B008DWG5HE,10,22,I love the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,23,And I confess, I bought one of the first iPads when they came out, have upgraded every time since so am pretty much married to the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,10,24,Only thing I am not too keen on was there was no built in Swype keyboard like my HTC phone, but I bought the app so that was fixable
B008DWG5HE,11,0,Also, the Note 10.1 has no built in full size or mini USB or HDMI ports.
B008DWG5HE,11,1,I really love this device (using it right now).
B008DWG5HE,11,2,You need multiple expensive accessories just to hook up USB host, SD cards, and HDMI.
B008DWG5HE,11,3,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,11,4,The problem from my point of view is that samsung removed the hdmi port and usb port in order to sell accessories.
B008DWG5HE,11,5,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,11,6,Battery life excellent.
B008DWG5HE,11,7,Not as good as Alt+Tab, but a close secondBLUETOOTH KEYBOARDI think a bluetooth keyboard is a must.
B008DWG5HE,11,8,It's not always easy to get wireless - especially if driving.
B008DWG5HE,11,9,There should be a micro or mini USB port on the left side of the device (in landscape) so that it can be used in landscape or portrait while propped up on a stand.
B008DWG5HE,11,10,It also supports Bluetooth.I was very impressed with the battery life.
B008DWG5HE,11,11,To plug a flash/thumb drive directly into the Note 10.1 you have to buy a adapter.
B008DWG5HE,11,12,- Volume is good, even louder than my laptops.
B008DWG5HE,11,13,I still like it and will make some time to work with it more.
B008DWG5HE,11,14,It gets the job done, its just not going to make amazing vacation photos.I believe you can get a Samsung or bluetooth keyboard for this separately, so you can get more of a laptop feel.
B008DWG5HE,11,15,Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such.
B008DWG5HE,11,16,Only thing I am not too keen on was there was no built in Swype keyboard like my HTC phone, but I bought the app so that was fixable
B008DWG5HE,11,17,Flash not supported.
B008DWG5HE,11,18,love it but....
B008DWG5HE,11,19,Please tell me you are working hard... Photoshop touch is nice but it ain't illustrator.I use Note pretty much indoors, so I am not in the position to tell people whether the screen is bright outside.
B008DWG5HE,11,20,I only did spend that kind of money just for the  "NOTE" part of it otherwise many other tablets were lot less expensive and some have more features like USB port.
B008DWG5HE,11,21,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,11,22,Samsung does offer adapters that connect to the charging port--but that is an extra cost and an inconvience.
B008DWG5HE,11,23,It's only for S Note app.  - Multiscreen feature can only be used with few built-in apps.
B008DWG5HE,11,24,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,12,0,It did not disappoint.Firstly, this tablet is fast, really fast.
B008DWG5HE,12,1,would like more smooth and good resolution.
B008DWG5HE,12,2,It is smooth, fast, nice looking, and has the S-Pen.
B008DWG5HE,12,3,This tablet works very well and has many nice features.
B008DWG5HE,12,4,I like spen functionality ... and would like more smooth and good resolution.
B008DWG5HE,12,5,This tablet has a fast processor.
B008DWG5HE,12,6,It is beautiful and works great!
B008DWG5HE,12,7,- Stylus pen is good and easy to hold for average size hand.
B008DWG5HE,12,8,This is  the only good thing about it.
B008DWG5HE,12,9,It does take some getting use to the Android operating system when trying to navigate the web.
B008DWG5HE,12,10,It is easy to conceive drone system for transporting package.
B008DWG5HE,12,11,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,12,12,It is too thin and short (I understand this design choice since they want to keep the tablet as thin and light as possible, but it makes the stylus less natural as a pen).
B008DWG5HE,12,13,It is easy to use, and the screen/display is great!
B008DWG5HE,12,14,Good Device.
B008DWG5HE,12,15,Display is crystal clear.
B008DWG5HE,12,16,OK, let;s get it over with, the screen isn't as high resolution as the Apple, but it;s pretty good.
B008DWG5HE,12,17,I will try setting it up again since I think this would be a pretty cool feature.
B008DWG5HE,12,18,However, I am quite familiar to android OS on my phone.
B008DWG5HE,12,19,- I love note taking features.
B008DWG5HE,12,20,Google needs to overhaul the Android OS to make pen/drawing/handwriting recognition integrated seamless throughout the ANdroid operating ssystem.Another quibble is the way the stylus is designed in the Galaxy Note.
B008DWG5HE,12,21,The stylus does respond pretty good and the painting experience is good but it seems to falter a bit with detail or smaller lines.
B008DWG5HE,12,22,The Note 10.1 packs some impressive specs and features and makes the best case for a stylus yet.
B008DWG5HE,12,23,I wanted the 4 G and this is the ice cream sandwich, which I didn't understand.
B008DWG5HE,12,24,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,13,0,Samsung was on the path to great product until they started to make it exclusive to thier products!!
B008DWG5HE,13,1,bad service so far I have not received the goods since being purchased from the 15th of January  nnnn n.
B008DWG5HE,13,2,Samsung's customer service experience.
B008DWG5HE,13,3,First of all, this item has shipped 3 days after I actually placed order.Second, the item was defective!!!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,13,4,Product is fine and I love Samsung products but seller gets 3 stars for product seal broken.
B008DWG5HE,13,5,I truly love my Samsung Galaxy and because I'm a droid girl, I would never consider Apple product.
B008DWG5HE,13,6,I returned this item.
B008DWG5HE,13,7,I wanted to send this unit back to Amazon.com but Samsung has held up the progress because of the adapter and my 30 days  return warranty has expired with Amazon.I would have never had this problem with Apple.
B008DWG5HE,13,8,Nice product.
B008DWG5HE,13,9,All the other features are great but what good are they if you can't print your reciept after purchasing your item  from Amazon?
B008DWG5HE,13,10,It is beautiful and works great!
B008DWG5HE,13,11,Shipped on time and tablet was intact, exceptions were fine.
B008DWG5HE,13,12,Tablet came on time but in a rather large box.
B008DWG5HE,13,13,Don't Buy Refurbished from this company.
B008DWG5HE,13,14,Tried discussing with Samsung support and they were no help.
B008DWG5HE,13,15,I got the Samsung because I am not happy with the iPhone4s and Apple....so I didn't want to get an iPad.
B008DWG5HE,13,16,I do not own any Apple or Android products, so I wasn't tied to either company.
B008DWG5HE,13,17,I have an iPad and mini IPad and not sure if galaxy is as friendly use as apple products.
B008DWG5HE,13,18,contacted and was told that its new and not refurbished item.
B008DWG5HE,13,19,Samsung blames the printer that has no problems with other android or even a ipad.
B008DWG5HE,13,20,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B008DWG5HE,13,21,The tablet box seal was broken.i
B008DWG5HE,13,22,It took 2 weeks for repairs.
B008DWG5HE,13,23,So, while I returned my Galaxy Note 10.1, I can't say it isn't a great tablet for others.
B008DWG5HE,13,24,Did not like how Amazon shipped it out, after spending all that money it should of been bubble wrapped or something, not just thrown into a box.
B008DWG5HE,14,0,I have owned 2 other android tablets before this and this 1 is by far the best.
B008DWG5HE,14,1,Best Android tablet I have owned.
B008DWG5HE,14,2,One of the best TABLETs in ANDROID market.
B008DWG5HE,14,3,Much Better!
B008DWG5HE,14,4,Best android tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,5,I love my Samsung galaxy note.
B008DWG5HE,14,6,However lately when he moves it a certain way the screen gets lines across it and is unreadable.
B008DWG5HE,14,7,Great for Digital Painting and Sketching.
B008DWG5HE,14,8,Good Device.
B008DWG5HE,14,9,The main and almost only reason I got this tablet is because of the Stylus and screen precision which makes digital painting and sketching much better than in an iPad.
B008DWG5HE,14,10,If he moves it when that happens, the screen will straighten out for a bit and then go back to lines.
B008DWG5HE,14,11,The Galaxy Note 10.1 has the potential of being the best of both worlds.
B008DWG5HE,14,12,It even has Microsoft Office for Android on it!
B008DWG5HE,14,13,I use SketchBook Pro on both devices and the difference is huge.I'm even getting a Wacom bamboo stylus to improve the drawing and painting experience even farther.As to Android OS.
B008DWG5HE,14,14,Work and Home Companion.
B008DWG5HE,14,15,I was torn between this and the Microsoft Surface Pro.
B008DWG5HE,14,16,One:  you can only have one window of each of the compatible programs open at a time (so, you can't have two Polaris office items open at once) and there are relatively few programs that are compatible with the multiscreen.
B008DWG5HE,14,17,10.1 size gives me a larger screen for productivity but not so large that it becomes less portable.
B008DWG5HE,14,18,If you do need a tablet with the pen and windows, and are willing to put up with the pen's deficiencies, you might like the note 10.1, but I'ld wait for the price to come down.
B008DWG5HE,14,19,Best darn tablet for using a digital pen.
B008DWG5HE,14,20,The S-pen is very good, much like the Surface Pro's pen, except it's at half the price.2.
B008DWG5HE,14,21,Great.
B008DWG5HE,14,22,The digitizer is pretty good, but I actually prefer the Surface pro digitizer but that is more of an ultrabook then a tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,23,i like the multi screen and  the resolution es good my be in mucho better iPad screen  but is  more productive that other tablet
B008DWG5HE,14,24,The included pen applications are very good, and there are some more pen applications in the market.There are some niggling problems.
B008DWG5HE,15,0,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B008DWG5HE,15,1,One complaint is that the screen is VERY bright and I've not found a way to dim it.
B008DWG5HE,15,2,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,15,3,I really believe this tablet wont last at $500 for too long.The second big problem is the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,4,With the sun shining directly on the screen, I can read it fine.
B008DWG5HE,15,5,With the screen facing away from the sun, however, reflections of myself and the scenery behind me dominate the screen and make it difficult to read the text.
B008DWG5HE,15,6,Also, when  viewing dark  movie scenes, the screen appears washed out around the edges, with the upper left corner appearing orangeish, the lower right corner appearing bluish, and a whitish fringe appearing all around the edges.
B008DWG5HE,15,7,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B008DWG5HE,15,8,The screen is fine.2.5.
B008DWG5HE,15,9,It is bright and colors are vibrant.
B008DWG5HE,15,10,When using the tablet outdoors in bright sunlight, I find that the screen is bright enough to read text comfortably providing it is positioned properly with respect to the sun.
B008DWG5HE,15,11,Unfortunately, the screen has amazingly terrible backlight bleeding.This seems to stem from a multicolored spot on the screen that is visible at an angle.
B008DWG5HE,15,12,The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.
B008DWG5HE,15,13,Thus, unless you are looking directly at a right angle to where the pen is touching the glass, the image on the screen does not appear where you expect it to appear.
B008DWG5HE,15,14,Yes, the iPad has a screen that is a bit more vibrant, but unless they are sitting side by side you will NOT notice the difference.
B008DWG5HE,15,15,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,15,16,Screen rotation is a bit too sensitive.
B008DWG5HE,15,17,I purchased the iPad 2 when it was released and owned that for about 10 months before it fell and the screen cracked.
B008DWG5HE,15,18,Also, there is a gap between the surface of the glass (where the pen tip touches), and the screen below the glass where the image appears.
B008DWG5HE,15,19,Also, there is a slight lag time between the pen motion and the appearance of the image on the screen.
B008DWG5HE,15,20,I get to use my favorite apps and a higher resolution screen.
B008DWG5HE,15,21,Display is crystal clear.
B008DWG5HE,15,22,And text does appear slightly blurry around the edges.
B008DWG5HE,15,23,It does have quite a large bezel around the screen but oddly it makes it a bit easier to hold.
B008DWG5HE,15,24,But movies with dark scenes, which seems to be most movies these days, are difficult to see except in a completely darkened room (all the lights off).
B008DWG5HE,16,0,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,16,1,It does NOT have flash player nor can you download it from the app store.
B008DWG5HE,16,2,The problem with all tablets is app support.
B008DWG5HE,16,3,I was very disapointed when I found out I can'get on Amazon Video, etc.
B008DWG5HE,16,4,Therefore, this tablet will not run Flash video.
B008DWG5HE,16,5,I'm on my second book out of a 3 book series using the Kindle app.
B008DWG5HE,16,6,It's asking I download Adobe flash player.
B008DWG5HE,16,7,However, if you want to watch videos from any other source, for example; Amazon Prime, facebook videos, yahoo videos, etc. they can't be played due to the Adobe Flash being blocked.
B008DWG5HE,16,8,October 19On the FLASH PLAYER:There are several ways to get around not having flash player.
B008DWG5HE,16,9,Probably Google will come up with an app to do this and at the same time track what you watch.
B008DWG5HE,16,10,Flash not supported.
B008DWG5HE,16,11,Even if you install printer share, it is hard to use and not all apps work with it.
B008DWG5HE,16,12,And, you are constantly getting reminders from Google Play to update all of those pre-installed apps that you never use.
B008DWG5HE,16,13,I`ve had to download Firefox for Android.
B008DWG5HE,16,14,Flash does not work on this version.
B008DWG5HE,16,15,There is no obvious way to view Amazon Prime videos or to view many Internet sites that use flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,16,Does not support Adobe Flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,17,No flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,18,One of the problems- Every time I clicked on any link/button to install flash, the device would take me to the play store and tell me flash wasn't available.I eventually found an application that requires flash, downloaded it, and let it install flash automatically, thus bypassing all automatic links to the google play store.However, once flash player is installed, it still doesn't work as well as a PC with the sites I frequent (rosetta stone, amazon).
B008DWG5HE,16,19,Great tablet but it does not support flash!
B008DWG5HE,16,20,no flash.
B008DWG5HE,16,21,opening apps & navagating around the O/S- able to play the HD .mkv
B008DWG5HE,16,22,When I got the device I expected to be able to have any 2 apps running at the same time, so I could watch Netflix while using IMDB, etc.  Thus far, I have only found one or two apps from the market that support the split screen function.-
B008DWG5HE,16,23,So no websites which use Java can work....and I believe this is on all Android devices.
B008DWG5HE,16,24,To my dismay Adobe (the company who makes Flash video software) stopped supporting Flash for android.
B008DWG5HE,17,0,if you purchase their products you are on your own after they get your money.
B008DWG5HE,17,1,I bought the Note after reading the many reviews here.
B008DWG5HE,17,2,I bought first one, during the trial, it freezes soon, So, I returned it and excanged with new one.
B008DWG5HE,17,3,This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device.
B008DWG5HE,17,4,You could buy a large version of one of those for the same price as this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,17,5,My company spends 1000s of dollar in amazon purchasing.
B008DWG5HE,17,6,The Note goes with me every time I'm out the door.
B008DWG5HE,17,7,I buy this again?
B008DWG5HE,17,8,would not have bought knowing this.
B008DWG5HE,17,9,I ended up buying an iPad 4 and my complaint is the same for Apple.
B008DWG5HE,17,10,Verry disappointed!!
B008DWG5HE,17,11,However I was not expecting this from seller with high reviews.
B008DWG5HE,17,12,I'm sure time will cure that issue.
B008DWG5HE,17,13,It's one thing to crash, and another thing to crash ALL THE TIME and preventing you from using other apps and having a good experience.Save your money.
B008DWG5HE,17,14,I gave a few days for myself before put a purchase order.
B008DWG5HE,17,15,Made my purchase in February and have had nothing but problems.
B008DWG5HE,17,16,If you want 10.1 tablet, wait for the Nexus 10.
B008DWG5HE,17,17,My point is just this, for $500, which what HIGH END tablets are going for, I would expect a little better.
B008DWG5HE,17,18,So, I decieded returning it as well.
B008DWG5HE,17,19,Bought this for the wife and perhaps just my poor research and expectations but I would have expected that this would be able to do much of what a windows based tablet would do.
B008DWG5HE,17,20,overall good experience with this tablet.
B008DWG5HE,17,21,A decent product but could be better.
B008DWG5HE,17,22,As you have probably read from other reviews, this feels like a cheap McDonalds toy.
B008DWG5HE,17,23,I used to take the iPad in the field with me on average 3-4 times a week.
B008DWG5HE,17,24,You don;'t need to read big reviews  to know that this tablet is better than apple !but can be better !
B008DWG5HE,18,0,I was able assemble the adopter /battery charger.
B008DWG5HE,18,1,charging cord.
B008DWG5HE,18,2,But, Alas! after plugging the charger in for a couple of hours and seeing a battery charge symbol on the screen I elected to turn in on and________---------________ Nothing!
B008DWG5HE,18,3,I'm having battery charging issues though!
B008DWG5HE,18,4,Had one before and the battery died.
B008DWG5HE,18,5,Unit takes a long time to charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,6,As of now I must Hard shut down to get to full charge and sometimes that doesn't even do it.
B008DWG5HE,18,7,It doesn't stop even long enough for me to hold down the power key and turn the device off completely.I have researched everything, and can not find anything on why it is doing this, or how to fix it!
B008DWG5HE,18,8,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,18,9,the battery was defective.
B008DWG5HE,18,10,The first one wouldn't even turn on!
B008DWG5HE,18,11,Last week it went into a reboot mode and I could not get it to turn off.
B008DWG5HE,18,12,I held-in the start button for 10, 20, 30 seconds up to a couple of minutes and one time the screen came alive with some inverted yellow triangle flashing.
B008DWG5HE,18,13,Unplugged the charger and the screen did come on for about three minutes until I tilted it upward from the table.
B008DWG5HE,18,14,Using supplied Samung charger I plug in, go to bed, wake up and its at 26%? Battery icon shows it's charging.
B008DWG5HE,18,15,What a bummer on Christmas to open a gift that isn't charged and can't charge because it has the wrong charger.
B008DWG5HE,18,16,The shipment received on time.
B008DWG5HE,18,17,Left the charger on over-night and again, the screen with the yellow triangle.
B008DWG5HE,18,18,Ridiculously short charging cord...pay this much for a tablet..you would think they would give a longer cord.
B008DWG5HE,18,19,Bummed to have to buy a charger now when this one should be came with the correct charger.
B008DWG5HE,18,20,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,18,21,Same usage as entry 1) above, except at 30% brightness, power save mode on - battery lasted 10 hours.
B008DWG5HE,18,22,But I am hoping the battery has long life.These are my opinions about the Note 10.1 from about a few week long usage.
B008DWG5HE,18,23,I hope it won't ruin the connection over time and keep it from charging.The case I bought has an opening for the charger, so that you can put it in easel position.
B008DWG5HE,18,24,I tried a "do it yourself repair that did not work and order a new device.
B008DWG5HE,19,0,The audio became occasionally inoperative and the headphone jack would crackle when using my ear buds.
B008DWG5HE,19,1,I tried other buds thinking there might be an issue with them but it was a consistent result, especially when turning the jack in the port.
B008DWG5HE,19,2,i like the multi screen and  the resolution es good my be in mucho better iPad screen  but is  more productive that other tablet
B008DWG5HE,19,3,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,19,4,I sometimes plug in some computer speakers and listen to music at work through it.
B008DWG5HE,19,5,Again, the back is most likely not an issue but it does kind of feel "cheap".
B008DWG5HE,19,6,Build quality is top notch.
B008DWG5HE,19,7,I tried a couple of them, some are okay, but most of just noise.
B008DWG5HE,19,8,I have yet to see it freeze or get into a state that requires a reboot.
B008DWG5HE,19,9,Solid product with great screen.
B008DWG5HE,19,10,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,19,11,And the sound quality and volume were excellent.
B008DWG5HE,19,12,If you are playing a game the battery goes low way to quick.
B008DWG5HE,19,13,Only thing I am not too keen on was there was no built in Swype keyboard like my HTC phone, but I bought the app so that was fixable
B008DWG5HE,19,14,The video quality, at least through Skype, is much better  than the iPad 3 for some reason.
B008DWG5HE,19,15,The plastic screeches and groans.One of previous actual "exceptional" devices  I owned was the touch pad, which had a plastic back.
B008DWG5HE,19,16,I will, however, note that the utter lack of external ports is disappointing.
B008DWG5HE,19,17,I find myself having to use headphones when watching videos.
B008DWG5HE,19,18,I expected this product to last for at least a couple of years.
B008DWG5HE,19,19,Speakers stereo separation is very good but the lower frequency sound is poor.6.
B008DWG5HE,19,20,So far, so good.
B008DWG5HE,19,21,The speakers are loud and front facing, woo-hoo!
B008DWG5HE,19,22,One thing I wanted it for was using a bible app on it for church & to take notes, as I've been using my phone & that is too small.
B008DWG5HE,19,23,I did find the note to be on the slow side at times I did experience lag.
B008DWG5HE,19,24,good produict and works very well.
B008DWG5HE,20,0,Great camera for video and still shooting.
B008DWG5HE,20,1,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,2,The camera takes nice pictures.
B008DWG5HE,20,3,The only reason I have this four stars was that the camera sometimes does not focus well if you are taking a photo of a room.
B008DWG5HE,20,4,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,5,The video quality, at least through Skype, is much better  than the iPad 3 for some reason.
B008DWG5HE,20,6,The lack of that last star is for slight difference in screen quality.
B008DWG5HE,20,7,The speakers are loud and front facing, woo-hoo!
B008DWG5HE,20,8,Video chatting works great as well.
B008DWG5HE,20,9,Because of the many features it has also almost replaced my digital camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,10,Lack of compatibilty.
B008DWG5HE,20,11,While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.
B008DWG5HE,20,12,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,20,13,But at $500, that is a slap in the face.
B008DWG5HE,20,14,I guess that isn't too bad, so long as it works.
B008DWG5HE,20,15,Skype crashes on any device I use at some point.7.
B008DWG5HE,20,16,The only issue I could see was no HD display and the rear camera could have been a little better.
B008DWG5HE,20,17,Many good points and one problem.
B008DWG5HE,20,18,It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something.
B008DWG5HE,20,19,Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine.
B008DWG5HE,20,20,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B008DWG5HE,20,21,is one drawback which, to me is quite problematic and could become huge over time.
B008DWG5HE,20,22,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,20,23,The main and almost only reason I got this tablet is because of the Stylus and screen precision which makes digital painting and sketching much better than in an iPad.
B008DWG5HE,20,24,Screen shot function is also good.10.
B008DWG5HE,21,0,This tablet has a fast processor.
B008DWG5HE,21,1,I did a hard set twice and it came back as fast as new but it would slow again as I added Apps back in.
B008DWG5HE,21,2,I also tried using other launchers asi know touch wiz tends to slow down the device down like it has on my s3.
B008DWG5HE,21,3,The old tablet had its issues with freezing up after the last update along with not enough ram.
B008DWG5HE,21,4,Samsung uses Kies as its sync program.
B008DWG5HE,21,5,Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 16 GB.
B008DWG5HE,21,6,I think the processor is fine and speedy.
B008DWG5HE,21,7,I found the s3 to be slow considering it has 2gb of ram.
B008DWG5HE,21,8,The OS was fast at first but as I added Apps it got slower and choppy.
B008DWG5HE,21,9,In the end, I think it was samsung that ruined it for me and I just feel this tablet is a little gimmicky.For the money I expected a better app experience from samsung.
B008DWG5HE,21,10,Too bad they don't work in multiscreen because this is a samsung hack.
B008DWG5HE,21,11,I was set to keep the tablet but it started to have performance issues.
B008DWG5HE,21,12,Not quite as responsive as I would like.
B008DWG5HE,21,13,I need a few apps that work, not 20 where half of them are crap and the other half half work with one or two stand outs.
B008DWG5HE,21,14,The UI seems okay and pretty responsive so no complaints there.
B008DWG5HE,21,15,Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 Should have been great....
B008DWG5HE,21,16,The multitasking is little more than samsung showing you 2 apps at once; you still can only really do one useful thing at once.
B008DWG5HE,21,17,Sync Problems.
B008DWG5HE,21,18,Lots and lots of problems !!!!
B008DWG5HE,21,19,Great piece of hardware, but lacks software.
B008DWG5HE,21,20,the battery is ok especially when you use a power saver,  thanks to to the android market.
B008DWG5HE,21,21,Quad Core processor is necessary IMHO.
B008DWG5HE,21,22,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,21,23,I need to do more than a few things at once and I need all of my features at the same time.
B008DWG5HE,21,24,The note 2 10.1 has twice the ram as the tab model.
B008DWG5HE,22,0,SD card slot usles.
B008DWG5HE,22,1,The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,2,I bought this 16G tablet and installed a 16G SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,3,While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-
B008DWG5HE,22,4,I bought this partly because of the sd card slot.According to Samsung you can't run apps from it and they can't store their data there.
B008DWG5HE,22,5,SD card not properly used.
B008DWG5HE,22,6,I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.
B008DWG5HE,22,7,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,8,You cannot use Apps2SD, for example, to move apps from the Note's built-in memory to an external SD card without *rooting the device.
B008DWG5HE,22,9,Warning... Samsung tablets and phones do not allow you to store apps in the SD memory.
B008DWG5HE,22,10,It seems reasonable that it is the user who should determine if speed or memory space is more important.
B008DWG5HE,22,11,So if you want the note go for 32GB or you'll be sorry.
B008DWG5HE,22,12,I have a cheap 7" non Samsung tablet and I can move apps as I want.
B008DWG5HE,22,13,I do like the speed, I do like the layout , I do like the external Msd slot.
B008DWG5HE,22,14,I liked having the expansion capabilities with micro SD card slot but the proprietary dock/USB port was a pain.
B008DWG5HE,22,15,This was a major concern as the tablet could accept a 64gb micro SD card for expansion and would lend itself to installing more apps in the future.
B008DWG5HE,22,16,Apps can only install on default memory*.
B008DWG5HE,22,17,Samsung told me that the reason they want apps on the main memory is for speed of access.
B008DWG5HE,22,18,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,19,I used 10% of the available 11 GB for only 4issues of PC world's enhanced additions.
B008DWG5HE,22,20,The ONLY use they giveis for backing up data.
B008DWG5HE,22,21,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B008DWG5HE,22,22,All you can put there are pictures, music, etc.
B008DWG5HE,22,23,Samsung's answer to my complaint was to tell me to delete some apps.
B008DWG5HE,22,24,Haven't yet figured out how to put files onto the SD chip instead of the internal drive.The tablet comes with a two year 50 Gig access to Dropbox (file storage).
B008DWG5HE,23,0,I really liked note 10.1 until I connected to wifi.
B008DWG5HE,23,1,I don't really need wifi that much and use the note to take notes, and would rather not have to back everything up again, so I'm going without the wifi.
B008DWG5HE,23,2,slow wifi on the note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,23,3,Pleade do a google search for slow wifi on the note 10.1.Tim
B008DWG5HE,23,4,It is useful but for those problems.
B008DWG5HE,23,5,It says in the settings that it's connected to the school network, but when I try to access the internet, it doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,23,6,Lots and lots of problems !!!!
B008DWG5HE,23,7,Has some issues.
B008DWG5HE,23,8,Same problem still.
B008DWG5HE,23,9,WiFi suddenly doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,23,10,I don't know if the problem is with the device, android OS, the school network or any combination of the three but the problem is that since this device isn't as popular as the iPad, the problem isn't going to be solved anytime soon.So if you need reliable access to wifi, this device may not be for you.
B008DWG5HE,23,11,I would have rated this 5 stars if it wasn't slow.
B008DWG5HE,23,12,My girlfriend has taken video footage with her phone (an Apple phone, that she has never had a problem with she says) of this device freaking out for minutes on end.
B008DWG5HE,23,13,MAJOR peeve:  This is a mobile device which most people are going to use as a web device.
B008DWG5HE,23,14,I also tried using other launchers asi know touch wiz tends to slow down the device down like it has on my s3.
B008DWG5HE,23,15,I also experienced the wifi dropping on the second note I tried.
B008DWG5HE,23,16,MANY people have this problem since update to JellyBean from ICS.
B008DWG5HE,23,17,For the connection to be on the bottom is COMPLETELY impractical, as you have to lie the unit down to use any of your connections.
B008DWG5HE,23,18,I did find the note to be on the slow side at times I did experience lag.
B008DWG5HE,23,19,Experiencing a major problem after a week.
B008DWG5HE,23,20,Many good points and one problem.
B008DWG5HE,23,21,SPASTIC OS, intermittent wi-fi disconnection.
B008DWG5HE,23,22,But the technology is not there yet.I use chrome browser on this and it seems to freeze a lot on it.May25th- Updated to 3 star after using it some more.
B008DWG5HE,23,23,I've had this for a couple of months, but from about 2 weeks ago, the wifi stopped working on my school network.
B008DWG5HE,23,24,No issues with Wi-Fi like some people have reported.13.
B008DWG5HE,24,0,We can't do anything on it, we can't even get to the home screen without it going nuts.
B008DWG5HE,24,1,The keyboard does not work well.
B008DWG5HE,24,2,And touching the wrong part of the screen will send you to some unexpected places.
B008DWG5HE,24,3,However, the potentiometer was very sensitive and at first I over adjusted so that the pen was writing on the screen when it wasn't even touching the glass.
B008DWG5HE,24,4,I am a avid typer (can you tell by the length of my article?), but for typing I was satisfied with using the touch screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,5,Every time you pause, and start writing again, it starts a new text box.
B008DWG5HE,24,6,The continual problems I have had with the note is that the left side of the touch screen lacks sensitivity when using the virtual keyboard.
B008DWG5HE,24,7,Missing parts not once, not twice but 3 times, and all boxes were open.
B008DWG5HE,24,8,Everything on screen is still visible, just no touch function at all with either finger or pen.
B008DWG5HE,24,9,There are times when you press a button or select something with the pen and it does not register, and you have to press a second time.-
B008DWG5HE,24,10,To get it to work you have to detach the tablet from the cover then move it.
B008DWG5HE,24,11,It comes with a pen, and it works pretty well.
B008DWG5HE,24,12,The screen is slippery, so more control over pen movement is required than when writing on paper.
B008DWG5HE,24,13,Well, I have been able to use it effectively in this manner, but I have found that the S-pen is rather tricky to use and takes some getting used to.The S-pen:The first thing I noticed when trying to write with the s-pen out of the box is that I had to press too hard on the screen to make it write.
B008DWG5HE,24,14,Lastly, even with touch input turned off, so only the pen will write on the page, the motion of the side of your hand on the screen will occasionally cause the page to move around or inadvertently zoom in or out.These problems were enough to cause me to consider returning the tablet when I first tried it.
B008DWG5HE,24,15,Until I discovered the "Null Keyboard" app, I wasn't happy with the interaction between the two devices because the on-screen keyboard would pop up whenever I tapped a text box.
B008DWG5HE,24,16,This has been a five-star product until...Today, I just tried pulling out the pen and the touch panel seemed to go dead.
B008DWG5HE,24,17,You resume writing, "accuracy".
B008DWG5HE,24,18,The touchscreen keyboard goes nuts with ghost typing; it opens and closes programs, goes from one page to the other, and has acutally changed settings as well.
B008DWG5HE,24,19,For example, I would like to hand write a whole page and then let the app convert the whole page to text at once.
B008DWG5HE,24,20,I was stumped about the "pen".
B008DWG5HE,24,21,If you hand write a few words and then pause, the handwriting is converted to text.
B008DWG5HE,24,22,Turned out the pen was attached onto the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,24,23,The "n" and "m" keys often do not register properly causing multiple delays in touch typing.
B008DWG5HE,24,24,In the yellow lined paper template, they don't work very well.
B008DWG5HE,25,0,Wish I would have gone with the I-Pad.
B008DWG5HE,25,1,iPad is a much better device.
B008DWG5HE,25,2,Samsung blames the printer that has no problems with other android or even a ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,3,I found another app that works better for me.
B008DWG5HE,25,4,This shortcoming is more an issue with Android.
B008DWG5HE,25,5,The keyboard does not work well.
B008DWG5HE,25,6,This device runs Android 2.3.
B008DWG5HE,25,7,I'm sure time will cure that issue.
B008DWG5HE,25,8,This is a great device, however I feel Samsung was deceptive in that there was NO mention of it's provided App's only printing to Samsung printers.
B008DWG5HE,25,9,The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time.
B008DWG5HE,25,10,So no websites which use Java can work....and I believe this is on all Android devices.
B008DWG5HE,25,11,I need to do more than a few things at once and I need all of my features at the same time.
B008DWG5HE,25,12,Samsung was on the path to great product until they started to make it exclusive to thier products!!
B008DWG5HE,25,13,It has a great split screen feature.
B008DWG5HE,25,14,I have purchased so many things through amazon over the last 7 or so years but this is my first review.
B008DWG5HE,25,15,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,25,16,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,25,17,Otherwise it's an excellent Android device.
B008DWG5HE,25,18,I didn't buy this from Amazon, but feel I should make a coment.
B008DWG5HE,25,19,That is one thing the ipad seems to have over Samsung is the devices seem a little more resistant to trauma.
B008DWG5HE,25,20,I did not buy this on amazon, but will be taking it back tomorrow as to get it print on anything other than a samsung printer is a act of god.
B008DWG5HE,25,21,Too bad they don't work in multiscreen because this is a samsung hack.
B008DWG5HE,25,22,Would recommend especially to people who are using a Samsung Android phone
B008DWG5HE,25,23,Things feel less clunky than with the Tab 2.Overall it is very similar; primarily hardware boosted.
B008DWG5HE,25,24,In the end, I think it was samsung that ruined it for me and I just feel this tablet is a little gimmicky.For the money I expected a better app experience from samsung.
B008DWG5HE,26,0,Minus another for that port being for a proprietary power plug.
B008DWG5HE,26,1,Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such.
B008DWG5HE,26,2,However the lack of a HDMI or USB port hampers its versatility.
B008DWG5HE,26,3,I will, however, note that the utter lack of external ports is disappointing.
B008DWG5HE,26,4,I like the Lightning port better than the old 30 pin connector but still, proprietary?
B008DWG5HE,26,5,But unless Samsung starts making more pragmatic devices, I'm going to look somewhere else.In short - minus one star for only one port.
B008DWG5HE,26,6,The cable gets mashed on the bottom of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,26,7,You can work with any bluetooth keyboard as I understand it, though I've not done so yet.
B008DWG5HE,26,8,Note 10.1, I got an additional cable... still not cool.Okay, I don't have to charge the Note that often so it is not too bad.
B008DWG5HE,26,9,Very nice performance, disappointed by the lack of ports.
B008DWG5HE,26,10,You can't just hook up a micro-USB cable for charging, so if you didn't bring your Samsung charger, you're out of luck.
B008DWG5HE,26,11,Proprietary 30-pin cable and non-removable battery.
B008DWG5HE,26,12,In some cases (depending on the amount of juice it gets from the USB port) it will actually charge, but so slowly that it's practically useless.
B008DWG5HE,26,13,For anyone who hates typing or finds it slow, this will be worth it's weight in gold.Has a mini usb port.
B008DWG5HE,26,14,I love the USB connectivity, but the location is terrible.
B008DWG5HE,26,15,The first is annoying but you can buy $6 cables on Amazon as extras (the one that comes with the charging hub is *extremely* short, ~3 feet at most) that work just fine.
B008DWG5HE,26,16,I've found I don't use the extra ports all that much so it isn't a big deal for me.
B008DWG5HE,26,17,If you attempt to charge this tablet via your computer, the tablet will show the battery icon as not charging.
B008DWG5HE,26,18,My main contention hardware-wise is the location of the port, and the fact that it`s a Samsung-proprietary rip off of the iPad port, plus its location.
B008DWG5HE,26,19,At this stage in the game I don't see the need for proprietary connectors.
B008DWG5HE,26,20,Our 4-year-old watches videos on this and, with the case we have, it's not possible to stand the tablet up for watching while it's plugged in.
B008DWG5HE,26,21,Also, have adapter to transfer pics to tablet, but haven't gotten that to work yet.
B008DWG5HE,26,22,I have about dozen microUSB cables in my house and my office, I could just use any of these as I do for my phone.
B008DWG5HE,26,23,Its not practical for school, but thats partially because the keyboard I got to go with it won't sync.
B008DWG5HE,26,24,Proprietary interface to charge, seriously not cool.
B008DWG5HE,27,0,Slow, locks up and doesn't do much.
B008DWG5HE,27,1,The Android system permits it.
B008DWG5HE,27,2,It freezes too often.
B008DWG5HE,27,3,It freezes too often.
B008DWG5HE,27,4,I bought first one, during the trial, it freezes soon, So, I returned it and excanged with new one.
B008DWG5HE,27,5,I bought this to use for work and travel.
B008DWG5HE,27,6,A month in, it keeps crashing.
B008DWG5HE,27,7,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,27,8,For a while it would freeze up a lot while using the note app.
B008DWG5HE,27,9,but it occurs the same problem.
B008DWG5HE,27,10,If you are looking for a tablet that you can actually work from home on get a real tablet with a windows operating system.
B008DWG5HE,27,11,Not only would it freeze up it would lose what I was working on.
B008DWG5HE,27,12,Keeps freezing and then randomly rebooting.
B008DWG5HE,27,13,But as soon as we/she learns the operating system I'm sure it will be just fine.
B008DWG5HE,27,14,I found another app that works better for me.
B008DWG5HE,27,15,I thought that something that I had installed was causing the problem.
B008DWG5HE,27,16,This would be ok if it fixed the problem but it didn't.
B008DWG5HE,27,17,I still like it and will make some time to work with it more.
B008DWG5HE,27,18,Verry disappointed!!
B008DWG5HE,27,19,Great idea, LOTS OF BUGS.
B008DWG5HE,27,20,I did not know this and now it has become a real problem.
B008DWG5HE,27,21,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,27,22,It is frustrating.Would
B008DWG5HE,27,23,So, I decieded returning it as well.
B008DWG5HE,27,24,Very disappointed in my choice of a tablet.
B008DWG5HE,28,0,According to Samsung customer service it wont be unblocked any time soon.
B008DWG5HE,28,1,Poor Inspection process and Bypassing Customer Service responsbility.
B008DWG5HE,28,2,The shipment received on time.
B008DWG5HE,28,3,Tried discussing with Samsung support and they were no help.
B008DWG5HE,28,4,Samsung customer service is horrible.
B008DWG5HE,28,5,They said to return it back to sam's club, sam's club says to contact Samsung instead.
B008DWG5HE,28,6,I tried a "do it yourself repair that did not work and order a new device.
B008DWG5HE,28,7,Called customer support and they had me reset it to factory settings.
B008DWG5HE,28,8,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,28,9,People talk about having to call into Samsung support over and over and over again, the flippant attitudes of the support people, and the unwillingness for Samsung to stand behind their product and provide a new unit when it's obvious a unit is defective.For the complete lack of customer support and poor quality/design, I will not be buying ANY Samsung tablet.
B008DWG5HE,28,10,Immediately notified Amazon.
B008DWG5HE,28,11,If Amazon is selling a product, I expect Amazon customer service to provide the required service.
B008DWG5HE,28,12,If I bought the product from Amazon, why do I have to contact the maufacturer's Website.
B008DWG5HE,28,13,Amazon responded promptly to contact Samsung Website.
B008DWG5HE,28,14,Made my purchase in February and have had nothing but problems.
B008DWG5HE,28,15,I guess I'll have to send it in for service.
B008DWG5HE,28,16,This would be ok if it fixed the problem but it didn't.
B008DWG5HE,28,17,As a result I would not reccomend Samsung products nor will I be purchasing any in the future.
B008DWG5HE,28,18,So, I decieded returning it as well.
B008DWG5HE,28,19,if you purchase their products you are on your own after they get your money.
B008DWG5HE,28,20,Don't direct it to the product manufacturer to solve the problem.
B008DWG5HE,28,21,Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs.
B008DWG5HE,28,22,My wife uses it all of the time and she is pleased with the replacement.
B008DWG5HE,28,23,Like it...when it works!
B008DWG5HE,28,24,NOT HAPPY!!!! Got a defective product!
B008DWG5HE,29,0,Instead, if you want to make a window disappear from the screen, you have to close the app appearing in the window.
B008DWG5HE,29,1,I am also disappointed that you can't shrink windows down to a single bar at the bottom of the screen like you can in Microsoft Windows for PC.
B008DWG5HE,29,2,I have had it for a week now, and still no crash.
B008DWG5HE,29,3,I don' know how easy it is to delete things I'll never need, if I can delete at all.
B008DWG5HE,29,4,I find the processor to be quick and efficient but some minor things like closing windows and navigation through different "panes" can be a challenge at first.
B008DWG5HE,29,5,Perhaps in time I'll figure them out and change rating to 5/5.
B008DWG5HE,29,6,I find it annoying learning all of the little "tricks" that are needed to make this tablet as efficient as possible.
B008DWG5HE,29,7,I am also not able to log onto a Remote Desktop program so I can actually do work from home.
B008DWG5HE,29,8,Also all the screens and bar at the bottom are Very busy.
B008DWG5HE,29,9,I don't like it because it comes with way too many icons on the home pages and no way I could find to delete them.
B008DWG5HE,29,10,Unfortunately, only selected apps will work in the multi-window system.
B008DWG5HE,29,11,Also, this tablet screen seems to collect more "smudge" marks than others.
B008DWG5HE,29,12,Some features are difficult to use.
B008DWG5HE,29,13,Even when I am doing so many things on this.
B008DWG5HE,29,14,Rarely bogs or crashes.
B008DWG5HE,29,15,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,29,16,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,29,17,they failed on 5 occasions over a two month period to provide a users manual as promised.
B008DWG5HE,29,18,If he moves it when that happens, the screen will straighten out for a bit and then go back to lines.
B008DWG5HE,29,19,I'm sure time will cure that issue.
B008DWG5HE,29,20,The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time.
B008DWG5HE,29,21,The split screen is a nice idea, but only works for certain apps.
B008DWG5HE,29,22,Switching from one window to another merely requires a tap on the window you want to work in.
B008DWG5HE,29,23,I really believe this tablet wont last at $500 for too long.The second big problem is the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,29,24,All the time is spent making good apps for the ibad.

B00CYQPM42,1,0,Not enough apps.
B00CYQPM42,1,1,I like the variety of apps available.
B00CYQPM42,1,2,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,1,3,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,1,4,Can't play POGO games on it so it is worthless to me.
B00CYQPM42,1,5,app.
B00CYQPM42,1,6,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,1,7,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,1,8,They do not play.
B00CYQPM42,1,9,not playing videos.
B00CYQPM42,1,10,I'm really enjoying all the Apps and playing "Candycrush"!
B00CYQPM42,1,11,Now we can both play the games.
B00CYQPM42,1,12,They play games on it too.
B00CYQPM42,1,13,The only downfall is no Google play store access.
B00CYQPM42,1,14,I'm able to anything from play games to read books to do homework
B00CYQPM42,1,15,my daughter really wanted the furby boom app for her furby and we found out later it was only available through google play..
B00CYQPM42,1,16,I have found many useful lifestyle apps (food diaries, calorie counters, etc).
B00CYQPM42,1,17,My Granddaughter plays games on it and loves it too now she does not have to play them on my little phone.
B00CYQPM42,1,18,AND naturally there is an app for that!!!
B00CYQPM42,1,19,You know there HAS to be an app for that!
B00CYQPM42,1,20,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,1,21,With an Android device, you can access the Amazon Android store, but with a Kindle Fire, you cannot access the Google Play store.
B00CYQPM42,1,22,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,1,23,It also have more free games to download.
B00CYQPM42,1,24,LOVE MY KINDLE FIRE. it works great and my faimly can use for various different sites, apps and books on it,
B00CYQPM42,2,0,Got it at a great price

B00CYQPM42,3,15,Light weightBattery life is over 10 hours.
B00CYQPM42,3,16,Seems battery doesn't last as long as first kindle.
B00CYQPM42,3,17,Battery life is ok - probably need to recharge every other day with normal use.
B00CYQPM42,3,18,And the battery life is the best I have ever had.
B00CYQPM42,3,19,Have to charge it almost every day.
B00CYQPM42,3,20,Really good.
B00CYQPM42,3,21,My previous kindle charged quickly even in use and had an amazing battery life!
B00CYQPM42,3,22,Nice, but does not hold a charge long enough.
B00CYQPM42,3,23,Battery life is solid.
B00CYQPM42,3,24,I expected the battery to last much longer.
B00CYQPM42,4,0,Sound good.
B00CYQPM42,4,1,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,2,The sound is also much better and louder.
B00CYQPM42,4,3,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,4,4,The sound quality is also top notch.
B00CYQPM42,4,5,The colors are richer and sound is much better.
B00CYQPM42,4,6,The HD quality is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,7,very nice apps, the resolution and sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,8,The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.
B00CYQPM42,4,9,The screen is fantastic and the speakers produce great sound that is fairly loud.
B00CYQPM42,4,10,The sound while listening to audiobooks and movies is very good.
B00CYQPM42,4,11,This is a good product that was I expected to be because it has a better screen and more features than any other tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,12,Decent sound
B00CYQPM42,4,13,Great Device, Better than expected.
B00CYQPM42,4,14,the audio books sound very good
B00CYQPM42,4,15,Really great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,16,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,17,found the speakers to have decent sound.
B00CYQPM42,4,18,Sound is really good (not home theater quality or anything) but better than any phone I've heard.
B00CYQPM42,4,19,I would tell anyone that this is a great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,20,movies look great .
B00CYQPM42,4,21,The color is amazing and the sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,22,This feels really good in your hand and the screen is BEAUTIFUL.
B00CYQPM42,4,23,I can not believe how good even the speakers are given the size of this device.
B00CYQPM42,4,24,And the sound!
B00CYQPM42,5,0,Takes great pictures!
B00CYQPM42,5,1,I did not like the way the camera was.
B00CYQPM42,5,2,The picture quality is absurd.
B00CYQPM42,5,3,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,4,Clear picture, quality sound.
B00CYQPM42,5,5,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,6,The camera is awesome...
B00CYQPM42,5,7,Love the clear, crisp picture.
B00CYQPM42,5,8,It could only be more perfect if it had a front facing camera!
B00CYQPM42,5,9,I also don't like the front only camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,10,Very easy to use and the picture quality is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,5,11,Works great.
B00CYQPM42,5,12,Image is very good.
B00CYQPM42,5,13,The picture quality is awesome and I love playing games on it.
B00CYQPM42,5,14,Picture is clear, color is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,15,The built in camera is so nice and takes anexcellent picture.
B00CYQPM42,5,16,VERY GOOD! Love this thing...........except the camera is on the WRONG side.
B00CYQPM42,5,17,The camera could be a little better, but very nice to be able to Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,18,It's very hard to take a decent picture with it because you can't see what you're focusing on.
B00CYQPM42,5,19,Sound good.
B00CYQPM42,5,20,Picture is perfect.
B00CYQPM42,5,21,It's such a great picture that I had trouble focusing on the movie because I was in awe over how clear and sharp the image on the screen was.
B00CYQPM42,5,22,Picture and sound are great for movies and games.
B00CYQPM42,5,23,Wrong, unless you enjoy taking pictures of yourself!
B00CYQPM42,5,24,Looks great and the image is fantastic.
B00CYQPM42,6,0,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,6,1,The HDX has a new graphics processor that Amazon says has 4X the performance of the HD.* Faster processor - a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor in the HDX versus 1.5GHz dual-core processor in the HD.
B00CYQPM42,6,2,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,6,3,Awesome screen.
B00CYQPM42,6,4,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,6,5,This tablet is amazingly fast and smooth, with the fastest processor in its class.
B00CYQPM42,6,6,the quad core processing unit makes gaming easy and reading smooth.
B00CYQPM42,6,7,I've never had the previous iterations, but I have to say it's pretty darn good.
B00CYQPM42,6,8,The speed is amazing.
B00CYQPM42,6,9,Great Value for Optimal Performance.
B00CYQPM42,6,10,I like how much faster the processor and Wi-Fi are too!
B00CYQPM42,6,11,Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.
B00CYQPM42,6,12,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,6,13,The processor is amazingly fast and the graphics engine is top of the line.
B00CYQPM42,6,14,Some apps I really enjoy on my android nexus 5 I can't get on the HDX without sideloading.
B00CYQPM42,6,15,Once again, the beautiful screen and powerful graphics chip makes playing Minecraft a joy, even with Amazon's highly skinned version of Android running it.----------SCREEN:----------The
B00CYQPM42,6,16,It comes with a 2.2GHz quad-core processor, which is the standard in the latest tablets.
B00CYQPM42,6,17,Compared to a nexus 7 which is the same price, the HDX seems to have a slower processor.
B00CYQPM42,6,18,I just needed something with good processing power, an HD display, and something simple so that my mother could browse the web and watch Netflix or something.
B00CYQPM42,6,19,The processor, it is very fast and loads pages quickly, and the 2 gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance.2.
B00CYQPM42,6,20,The graphics are incredible!
B00CYQPM42,6,21,HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor.
B00CYQPM42,6,22,Screen is gorgeous and so clear it's like 3D at times.
B00CYQPM42,6,23,The iPad Mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen.Processor:HDX: 2.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB memoryNexus: 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro, 2GB memoryiPad Mini: 64-bit dual-core A7, 1GB memoryThe HDX and iPad come out ahead of the Nexus on processing power while the HDX and Nexus come out ahead of the iPad Mini on memory.
B00CYQPM42,6,24,The graphics are great.
B00CYQPM42,7,0,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,7,1,She has so much more storage space.
B00CYQPM42,7,2,However, this tablet is so much faster and with the 64 GB of storage I can do so much more.
B00CYQPM42,7,3,MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229.
B00CYQPM42,7,4,Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover.
B00CYQPM42,7,5,The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB.
B00CYQPM42,7,6,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,7,7,In this day and age, a table ought to have a Micro SD memory card slot for expansion, and an HDMI connector - ESPECIALLY a media tablet like these!
B00CYQPM42,7,8,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,7,9,64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB.
B00CYQPM42,7,10,too many slot pop ups.
B00CYQPM42,7,11,This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size.
B00CYQPM42,7,12,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,7,13,Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at $229 for the 16GB of memory model ($309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature.
B00CYQPM42,7,14,Movies, books, audio, and apps all run in superior order, with the only down side, is memory expandability (an extra slot for loading more solid state memory as a card).
B00CYQPM42,7,15,To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80.
B00CYQPM42,7,16,But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing.
B00CYQPM42,7,17,16 gigs is just too little to carry much media with you, with the device using a large part of that 16 gigs, for it's UI and OS you are not even getting a full 16 gigs (more like 10).
B00CYQPM42,7,18,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,7,19,Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage.
B00CYQPM42,7,20,Not the best tablet, but perhaps the best value.
B00CYQPM42,7,21,If you're not sold on the reigning king of the tablet space, this is a good option for most users.
B00CYQPM42,7,22,Very nice tablet.
B00CYQPM42,7,23,For kid use with SD video, the 32GB option will give you ample room for the convenience factor.-----------------------------------SPECIAL
B00CYQPM42,7,24,To double that memory to 32GB costs another $40.
B00CYQPM42,8,0,I know they are working on it , but not fixed yet.
B00CYQPM42,8,1,Good device.
B00CYQPM42,8,2,Love It!! What a great device!!
B00CYQPM42,8,3,WIFI Connectivity.
B00CYQPM42,8,4,Great for watching movies and surfing the web.
B00CYQPM42,8,5,I found it very easy to connect to the Wi-Fi in each hotel we stayed at.
B00CYQPM42,8,6,The 7" is working great.
B00CYQPM42,8,7,Email, Internet and books...what more does a girl need working on the road!
B00CYQPM42,8,8,Web cripple.
B00CYQPM42,8,9,It works very well for music, reading docucuments and general web page browsing mhm habit video watching I is quite unreliable.
B00CYQPM42,8,10,Great traveling companion.
B00CYQPM42,8,11,Also love Fashioning and web surfing on it.
B00CYQPM42,8,12,Otherwise a v good device for a commuter who likes to watch a movie while traveling to and fro work each day,display is exceptional.
B00CYQPM42,8,13,I can check my email and go to Facebook instead of always going to my computer.
B00CYQPM42,8,14,The wifi is fast.
B00CYQPM42,8,15,I am having problems with the WiFi hookup on occasion, but I'm sure there is an explanation for it.
B00CYQPM42,8,16,Is an easy way to surf trough internet.
B00CYQPM42,8,17,I use it for not only reading but gaming, email, and surfing the net.
B00CYQPM42,8,18,It's easy to use and provides a high-quality experience for reading e-Books, browsing the Internet and watching video.
B00CYQPM42,8,19,Wi-Fi quick.
B00CYQPM42,8,20,This is a great device at an exceptional price.
B00CYQPM42,8,21,I love this device!
B00CYQPM42,8,22,Nice device.
B00CYQPM42,8,23,I do however have problems reading and watching movies while out in the sun.
B00CYQPM42,8,24,Regardless if your looking for something to watch Netflix on, read books, and surf the web it's excellent.
B00CYQPM42,9,0,Nice tablet, but... Great little tablet.
B00CYQPM42,9,1,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,9,2,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,9,3,The only thing I don't like is the keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,9,4,It works very sporadic.
B00CYQPM42,9,5,I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).
B00CYQPM42,9,6,Have origami case, works well, no issues.
B00CYQPM42,9,7,the screen is clear.
B00CYQPM42,9,8,The unit has a lovely display, it's responsive and a great overall tablet.
B00CYQPM42,9,9,Nice unit.
B00CYQPM42,9,10,The touch sceen on the iPad also works a lot smoother and is more accurate.
B00CYQPM42,9,11,It also has a great functional cover.
B00CYQPM42,9,12,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,9,13,Fast, very fast.
B00CYQPM42,9,14,Nice device.
B00CYQPM42,9,15,Easy to use, lots of apps, light weight, and the screen is very clear.
B00CYQPM42,9,16,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,9,17,otherwise over all nice & compact.
B00CYQPM42,9,18,One in three times it will work.
B00CYQPM42,9,19,(In my opinion anyway) the iPad is a lot easier to navigate around on, speech to text always works as well.
B00CYQPM42,9,20,It's the perfect size for reading.
B00CYQPM42,9,21,GREAT PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,9,22,Display and refresh are great!
B00CYQPM42,9,23,This is awesome and very light.
B00CYQPM42,9,24,Fast, compact and light.
B00CYQPM42,10,0,The 7" is working great.
B00CYQPM42,10,1,I know they are working on it , but not fixed yet.
B00CYQPM42,10,2,Works great.
B00CYQPM42,10,3,It works very sporadic.
B00CYQPM42,10,4,Really great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,5,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,6,Great Tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,7,As great as the ads said it would be!
B00CYQPM42,10,8,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,10,9,I am a sitter at the hospital and it works well for what I need it to do.
B00CYQPM42,10,10,It works well and is smarter than I.
B00CYQPM42,10,11,It looks great too.
B00CYQPM42,10,12,Great.
B00CYQPM42,10,13,It's Great.
B00CYQPM42,10,14,Works perfect, the kids love them!
B00CYQPM42,10,15,It works just that well.
B00CYQPM42,10,16,great little pad.
B00CYQPM42,10,17,Really good.
B00CYQPM42,10,18,Great tablet!
B00CYQPM42,10,19,I have 3 ipads & a iPad Mini.
B00CYQPM42,10,20,One in three times it will work.
B00CYQPM42,10,21,Hardware is great!
B00CYQPM42,10,22,I would tell anyone that this is a great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,10,23,It is a great traveling companion!
B00CYQPM42,10,24,They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.
B00CYQPM42,11,0,And for the first time in my life, I am hooked on games.
B00CYQPM42,11,1,It's like a mini laptop to go!
B00CYQPM42,11,2,Love the easier-to-locate design of the on/off button and external volume control button too.
B00CYQPM42,11,3,And the possibilities are endless!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!
B00CYQPM42,11,4,Love it, love it!!
B00CYQPM42,11,5,It is small enough that it slips into my purse and is big enough that I can see what is happening on the screen.
B00CYQPM42,11,6,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,11,7,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,11,8,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,11,9,Movies look great, games look great, photos and games look great.
B00CYQPM42,11,10,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,11,11,The display quality is truly awesome, the screen size is perfect for games and reading.
B00CYQPM42,11,12,Then they took away the HDMI port which I use often to play a movies on my TV.
B00CYQPM42,11,13,It's lighter faster & clearer!
B00CYQPM42,11,14,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,11,15,Easy to use, lots of apps, light weight, and the screen is very clear.
B00CYQPM42,11,16,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,11,17,The is some glare in bright light but that is the trade-off for color.The included apps are good enough.
B00CYQPM42,11,18,I am able to use 3rd-party app stores to upload missing apps and outdated ones on the Amazon App Store, but still!2) USB Connection Port - The connection port on the device can be a bit of a nuisance.
B00CYQPM42,11,19,I got this because my Android phone's screen was too small for reading and some gaming and note taking.
B00CYQPM42,11,20,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,11,21,A redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find!
B00CYQPM42,11,22,images are very clear and most of all the battery life is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,11,23,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,11,24,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,12,0,The screen displays are crisp and easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,12,1,Good size screen and colors.
B00CYQPM42,12,2,Very Clear Screen.
B00CYQPM42,12,3,But all in all, if you like thin, fast it is great.
B00CYQPM42,12,4,The device itself is light, easy to use, and pretty to look at.
B00CYQPM42,12,5,Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.
B00CYQPM42,12,6,Very nice display
B00CYQPM42,12,7,Easy to use, lots of apps, light weight, and the screen is very clear.
B00CYQPM42,12,8,Very Nice.
B00CYQPM42,12,9,Fast thin.
B00CYQPM42,12,10,Just the right size!
B00CYQPM42,12,11,It was fast, lightweight, and easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,12,12,The screen is beautiful and it is incredibly fast!
B00CYQPM42,12,13,Beautiful display screen.
B00CYQPM42,12,14,the screen is clear.
B00CYQPM42,12,15,Fast, very fast.
B00CYQPM42,12,16,Easy to operate and easy to carry with her wherever she goes
B00CYQPM42,12,17,Amazing, Fast, Beautiful display.
B00CYQPM42,12,18,This feels really good in your hand and the screen is BEAUTIFUL.
B00CYQPM42,12,19,Easy to use and  lightweight.
B00CYQPM42,12,20,The screen resolution is perfect.
B00CYQPM42,12,21,I am enjoying it so far other than that screen being a little small for me I think it has terrific features.
B00CYQPM42,12,22,I like the display and it is easy to operate.
B00CYQPM42,12,23,Display and refresh are great!
B00CYQPM42,12,24,The display is beautiful, bright and color accurate.It is more than fast enough for my use.
B00CYQPM42,13,0,Great product!
B00CYQPM42,13,1,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,13,2,GREAT PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,13,3,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,13,4,Otherwise this product is great!
B00CYQPM42,13,5,A great product.
B00CYQPM42,13,6,If I had known I wouldn't have purchased this product.
B00CYQPM42,13,7,Great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,8,This is a great product.
B00CYQPM42,13,9,Another great product.
B00CYQPM42,13,10,Great customer service!!
B00CYQPM42,13,11,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,13,12,fast shipping.
B00CYQPM42,13,13,I even called customer service and they said there's was a problem with it.
B00CYQPM42,13,14,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,13,15,Keep up the great work Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,13,16,This product will replace iPads in no time.My Dad loves the MayDay.
B00CYQPM42,13,17,Although it's old tech now, one thing I love about Samsung products is they LAST.
B00CYQPM42,13,18,Easy to use and if you do have a question great customer service if quickly available.
B00CYQPM42,13,19,Thank you Amazon for making such a wonderful product and for having such wonderful customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,20,Great for Grandpa!
B00CYQPM42,13,21,Just plain exceptional product!
B00CYQPM42,13,22,So I contacted Amazon customer service and let me just say they really are as amazing as everyone says!
B00CYQPM42,13,23,I called Amazon and they replaced it with a new one.
B00CYQPM42,13,24,You now must purchase an additional product from amazon at a cost of around $100.
B00CYQPM42,14,0,Not the best tablet, but perhaps the best value.
B00CYQPM42,14,1,size wise, it's the best.
B00CYQPM42,14,2,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,14,3,This device is the best digital do hicky I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,14,4,My next was an iPad 2 and then a Microsoft Surface Pro.
B00CYQPM42,14,5,This is by far my best experience with a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,14,6,I also own a Samsung Note 8, several iPads and have several other tablets as well.
B00CYQPM42,14,7,My first was a Samsung Galaxy 7.5.
B00CYQPM42,14,8,As great as the ads said it would be!
B00CYQPM42,14,9,That would make it the best tablet there is.
B00CYQPM42,14,10,The only thing that I would like to see is a larger screen at the same price.
B00CYQPM42,14,11,Good Product!
B00CYQPM42,14,12,This is, to date, the BEST tablet I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,14,13,Beautiful display screen.
B00CYQPM42,14,14,best multipurpose tablet in medium size.
B00CYQPM42,14,15,Although it's old tech now, one thing I love about Samsung products is they LAST.
B00CYQPM42,14,16,I love it so far.
B00CYQPM42,14,17,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,14,18,Otherwise this product is great!
B00CYQPM42,14,19,It's the best rotating screen I've experienced on any Android device so far, and I've had my share of Android devices.There are a myriad of new features to learn from the upgrade.
B00CYQPM42,14,20,It has a great screen, it's lightweight, and the price is right.
B00CYQPM42,14,21,I have an iPad 1 and  wanted to upgrade due to slow speed and the inability to upgrade iOS/ app incompatibility.
B00CYQPM42,14,22,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,14,23,this thing rocks!
B00CYQPM42,14,24,It has a very sharp screen, it's very easy to use, and the price is right.
B00CYQPM42,15,0,Great Screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,1,The only other problem I have noticed is with the screen resolution.
B00CYQPM42,15,2,And it just looks sharp with the black screen and backing.
B00CYQPM42,15,3,This screen issue not so much.
B00CYQPM42,15,4,Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.
B00CYQPM42,15,5,The color screen is crisp and, as a color screen, is more suitable for technical volumes than the B&W; Kindles.
B00CYQPM42,15,6,The screen is very clear and the options for use are almost endless.
B00CYQPM42,15,7,I have noticed my screen flickers when I am using an app that has color (basically everything except reading).
B00CYQPM42,15,8,There are 4 obvious shadows at the bottom of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,9,Colors are rich and edges are sharp.
B00CYQPM42,15,10,screen is sharp.
B00CYQPM42,15,11,The screen resolution, colors, and brightness as well as the sound quality cannot be matched by the other tablets out there.
B00CYQPM42,15,12,The screen is just beautiful.
B00CYQPM42,15,13,Side by side the 7's reading screen on white looked "dirty" compared to the 8.9's crisp whiteness (same purple haze on both sadly).
B00CYQPM42,15,14,The colors and clarity of the screen are wonderful.
B00CYQPM42,15,15,I'd prefer a cream color (the stark white is a bit too bright for me) with dark black text.
B00CYQPM42,15,16,Reading, movies, games, etc are shown in perfect HD resolution.NOTE - The blue pixel edge issue is there, but it is not distracting to me.
B00CYQPM42,15,17,I do not like the blue lighting around the edges, it something resets and even with a black background (to avoid the blue lighting) it has a light flicker.
B00CYQPM42,15,18,I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times.
B00CYQPM42,15,19,The color saturation is very good, especially in gaming, but might have a little too much color contrast for some when watching video.
B00CYQPM42,15,20,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,15,21,The is some glare in bright light but that is the trade-off for color.The included apps are good enough.
B00CYQPM42,15,22,The display is very nice and video and video games look great, but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device.The not so great things about the Kindle HDX 16 GB.1.
B00CYQPM42,15,23,Watching movies works for me - the 7" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.
B00CYQPM42,15,24,The difference was so small that it didn't really matter to me.The Kindle HDX screen (1920 x 1200) has a higher resolution than the Kindle HD screen (1280 x 800).
B00CYQPM42,16,0,Does not do Google plus and most apps...
B00CYQPM42,16,1,There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation.
B00CYQPM42,16,2,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,16,3,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,16,4,To few apps.
B00CYQPM42,16,5,Amazon you need to fix your App store
B00CYQPM42,16,6,All it needs is a suitable app store.
B00CYQPM42,16,7,App store is awful!!!!!!!!!!
B00CYQPM42,16,8,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,16,9,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,16,10,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,16,11,No podcast player app.
B00CYQPM42,16,12,There are more apps being added constantly and so far I've found everything I've needed in the app store.
B00CYQPM42,16,13,Yes, this is tied to the Amazon App store.
B00CYQPM42,16,14,Why is there no app for an update for Flash Player?
B00CYQPM42,16,15,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,16,16,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,16,17,With an Android device, you can access the Amazon Android store, but with a Kindle Fire, you cannot access the Google Play store.
B00CYQPM42,16,18,If Amazon would just switch to Google Play for the app store, then there is nothing that would stop them from ruling the world!
B00CYQPM42,16,19,Within the Amazon Apps world, this translates to $5.00 to spend on any app.
B00CYQPM42,16,20,I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.
B00CYQPM42,16,21,The limitations put on the Kindle regarding apps is a drawback for those used to using google apps.
B00CYQPM42,16,22,My favorite game app doesn't make them for the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,16,23,I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet.
B00CYQPM42,16,24,By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.
B00CYQPM42,17,0,I FOUND THAT THE PRICE WAS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,17,1,I wish I never bought it!
B00CYQPM42,17,2,I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BUY!
B00CYQPM42,17,3,I am really disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,4,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,5,This was my 4th kindle and I will not be wasting my money on one ever again.
B00CYQPM42,17,6,Much better than an Apple I-Pad!
B00CYQPM42,17,7,I bought two of these for Christmas, one for me one and one as a gift, at $179.
B00CYQPM42,17,8,Good purchase.
B00CYQPM42,17,9,I purchased this as a gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,10,It was a Christmas present.
B00CYQPM42,17,11,So we purchased one for Christmas.
B00CYQPM42,17,12,Not what I expected.
B00CYQPM42,17,13,This is the most expensive waste of money!
B00CYQPM42,17,14,OfficeSuite is read only, must purchase for $4.99, price is not bad.
B00CYQPM42,17,15,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,16,I know that you get what you pay for, so I guess I should have gotten an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,17,If you are not, then buy it anyway as you will save at least $100 over the nearest priced iPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,18,I bought this, as a gift for my 72 year old mother.
B00CYQPM42,17,19,Disappointing after owning an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,20,Not disappointed one bit as it met all my expectations.
B00CYQPM42,17,21,Disappointing.
B00CYQPM42,17,22,Do not purchase as a gift or you will have a hard time getting warranty replacement.
B00CYQPM42,17,23,I am just very disappointed in it for what I paid for.
B00CYQPM42,17,24,The same thing happened when I bought the Kindle Paperwhite a  year ago.
B00CYQPM42,18,0,The battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,18,1,Battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,18,2,battery doesn't last.
B00CYQPM42,18,3,Cannot turn it off.
B00CYQPM42,18,4,One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,5,The first one after less than a week woudn't charge.. Sent it back and they sent us a new one.
B00CYQPM42,18,6,Battery only last for two to three  hours.
B00CYQPM42,18,7,The Kindle recently died, the battery cannot be charged, even when using a different charger.
B00CYQPM42,18,8,I don't want to have to turn on Quiet Time all the time just to get this to stop.
B00CYQPM42,18,9,There is no time zone for EST.
B00CYQPM42,18,10,Low battery life.
B00CYQPM42,18,11,Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours.
B00CYQPM42,18,12,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,13,I have to hold the power button down for 15 seconds or more for it to shut off.
B00CYQPM42,18,14,If the cord is propped up I can leave it plugged in all night and it won't charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,15,The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger.
B00CYQPM42,18,16,The battery charger is faulty and the only way I can charge the kindle is to prop up the cord.
B00CYQPM42,18,17,Battery - I get a couple days of heavy usage (8 hours) out of it.
B00CYQPM42,18,18,Battery life is great so far.-
B00CYQPM42,18,19,Really like this tablet, use it every day.
B00CYQPM42,18,20,But ultimately, it's the battery life that prompts me to return the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,18,21,Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%.
B00CYQPM42,18,22,Every time I turn the tablet on I get  advertising.
B00CYQPM42,18,23,I could stare at this thing for days (but won't).
B00CYQPM42,18,24,It has frozen on me a couple of times but all you have to do is shut it down.
B00CYQPM42,19,0,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,19,1,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,19,2,I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones.
B00CYQPM42,19,3,In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough.
B00CYQPM42,19,4,I'm not sure how they do it but the sound and volume on this thing is incredible.
B00CYQPM42,19,5,Ever heard of quality control?
B00CYQPM42,19,6,If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder.
B00CYQPM42,19,7,found the speakers to have decent sound.
B00CYQPM42,19,8,With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste.
B00CYQPM42,19,9,It sounds like I am sitting in a surround sound movie theater.
B00CYQPM42,19,10,I bought this for my father who has low vision.
B00CYQPM42,19,11,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,19,12,It improves the sound, especially with the built in speakers.
B00CYQPM42,19,13,Not for Low Vision.
B00CYQPM42,19,14,Sound is really good (not home theater quality or anything) but better than any phone I've heard.
B00CYQPM42,19,15,Battery holds up well..speakers could have more volume.
B00CYQPM42,19,16,I hear it is not that difficult.
B00CYQPM42,19,17,I bought this for my 7 year old and it worked fine at first but now it keeps freezing up and we can't turn it off or anything it just freezes on whatever she was doing playing the music on and on can't even power it down until the battery dies wouldn't recommend this product.
B00CYQPM42,19,18,While I disagree 100% this is I feel this is not "NOT NORMAL" It distracts the user while reading ect.
B00CYQPM42,19,19,Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.
B00CYQPM42,19,20,The simulated surround effect is noticed most of the time.I still think the iPad 4 has the best built in speakers I've heard on a phone or tablet.
B00CYQPM42,19,21,I eventually figured out that if you angle the tablet slightly away from you, or slightly toward you, much of the reflection is eliminated.SOUND - The speakers are in the back.
B00CYQPM42,19,22,The sound while listening to audiobooks and movies is very good.
B00CYQPM42,19,23,The sound quality is also top notch.
B00CYQPM42,19,24,The surround sound effect, once turned on is decent.
B00CYQPM42,20,0,that isn't really a camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,1,The HDX has a front facing camera, but lacks a rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,2,It also doesn't have a rear facing camera, it only has a front facing one, like for apps such as Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,3,The poor quality front facing only camera on it.
B00CYQPM42,20,4,The 7” version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.
B00CYQPM42,20,5,I don't like just front camera ure feature..rather, I prefer rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,6,she does however have a problem with the camera part, apparently you can only take pictures that are facing the front of the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,7,Also the camera is the worst part, the camera is only on the front of the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,8,#1 the camera on this model is only front facing but it seems that on all of the other HDX models that are larger they have a front AND rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,9,I ONLY WISH THE CAMERA WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
B00CYQPM42,20,10,this is not good because it does not seem you can take a picture of something you are looking at.
B00CYQPM42,20,11,don't need a picture of my ugly mug looking at my kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,12,I bought the unit over the nook because it stated that the unit had a camera, but did not specify that it was only and front facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,13,Very good better than what a t I expected.The only thing is the camera it only have front and not back.But I guess that's why it have the kindle hdx8.9 cause that have both.
B00CYQPM42,20,14,The Nexus 7 has both a rear and a front camera, while the Fire HDX only has a front camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,15,You need a camera for Skype or other video app.-
B00CYQPM42,20,16,If you take the time to put a camera, why not make give it a front and rear with more megapixels to really compete with other tablets?
B00CYQPM42,20,17,The only camera is on the front side (screen side), so taking video or a picture with it is difficult because you can't see the screen.
B00CYQPM42,20,18,The only draw back is that the camera lens is on the front (facing you) so the only thing you can really do is take selfies, which I DON'T do.
B00CYQPM42,20,19,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,20,It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,21,The rear facing camera would make my 32BG purchase choice more useful.
B00CYQPM42,20,22,Like last year's model, there is no rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,23,The only pictures you can take of are yourself because if you turn it around you can't see what you are taking a picture of.
B00CYQPM42,20,24,I had hoped I would be able to use it to take pictures and video as well as use it for video chat.
B00CYQPM42,21,0,Having a lot of issues with this!!!
B00CYQPM42,21,1,Lots of freezing and unexpected hangs.
B00CYQPM42,21,2,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,21,3,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,21,4,I use it a lot more than I use my desktop now.
B00CYQPM42,21,5,No chrome, Firefox, atomic, or safari.
B00CYQPM42,21,6,I still have to use my slow old computer.
B00CYQPM42,21,7,I assessed several different tablets, making charts on hardware, performance' pros & con's etc.
B00CYQPM42,21,8,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,21,9,Those are obvious initial speed bumps though, and they haven't been that bad.
B00CYQPM42,21,10,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,21,11,Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.
B00CYQPM42,21,12,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,21,13,Not disappointed one bit as it met all my expectations.
B00CYQPM42,21,14,Great Device, Better than expected.
B00CYQPM42,21,15,I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently.
B00CYQPM42,21,16,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,21,17,The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!
B00CYQPM42,21,18,Watching movies works for me - the 7" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.
B00CYQPM42,21,19,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,21,20,Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.
B00CYQPM42,21,21,I take it everywhere and use it all the time for work and play.
B00CYQPM42,21,22,I travel a lot and at times I just take this along!
B00CYQPM42,21,23,I've got better things to do with my time that hack a product right out of the box.
B00CYQPM42,21,24,only two things i dislike: The Boot up time after you turn it off is slow, and the fact that i can't use Google Play.
B00CYQPM42,22,0,No mutlitasking, need QNX blackberry or Palm Pre cards layout.
B00CYQPM42,22,1,I also like that there is a "on device" and "cloud" app storage so I can move apps to the Cloud when I don't want them for a time.
B00CYQPM42,22,2,It is REALLY hard to quit apps.
B00CYQPM42,22,3,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,4,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,22,5,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,22,6,It's ways to buy apps.
B00CYQPM42,22,7,Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB
B00CYQPM42,22,8,But I really could not have paid the price and I would have had to get a 16GB or a 32 GB.
B00CYQPM42,22,9,It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2.
B00CYQPM42,22,10,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,22,11,Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage.
B00CYQPM42,22,12,The fact that the device does not support storage expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,13,I am able to use 3rd-party app stores to upload missing apps and outdated ones on the Amazon App Store, but still!2) USB Connection Port - The connection port on the device can be a bit of a nuisance.
B00CYQPM42,22,14,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,22,15,The 16 GB isn't really 16 GB, which is par for the course.
B00CYQPM42,22,16,Still having a few problems finding things on this one, after I got used to the last model.
B00CYQPM42,22,17,The lack of onboard storage (which was promoted earlier on as a none issue for modern users) has turned a real problem and the 16GB version actually leaves the user with closer to 8 or 9GB than the 16GB advertised.
B00CYQPM42,22,18,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,22,19,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,22,20,Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app.
B00CYQPM42,22,21,I don't have any complaints or suggestions for future changes so far (except maybe to quit tempting me with new models for a while!).
B00CYQPM42,22,22,I find it very useless due to the fact that there is not many apps.
B00CYQPM42,22,23,Even so, apps can be side-loaded onto the device if you have basic technical know-how.
B00CYQPM42,22,24,But if you want a tablet that has unrestricted access to every app out there, you'll have to look elsewhere.
B00CYQPM42,23,0,WIFI Connectivity.
B00CYQPM42,23,1,Won't Connect to my Wireless Router.
B00CYQPM42,23,2,My other devices have never had an issue.
B00CYQPM42,23,3,And the update fixed all the problems I had encountered.
B00CYQPM42,23,4,wi-fi drops constantly.
B00CYQPM42,23,5,The wi-fi connection drops constantly for no apparent reason.
B00CYQPM42,23,6,It is hard and slow to connect to WiFI unlike my other Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,7,i got this particular model so i could have internet/ wifi anywhere.
B00CYQPM42,23,8,Thus, I ran into the very same connectivity issues that I had with my old Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,9,Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems.
B00CYQPM42,23,10,If the connection issues were resolved, I would give this 5 stars.
B00CYQPM42,23,11,Next time i will take the ipad.
B00CYQPM42,23,12,It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day.
B00CYQPM42,23,13,Whenever I would connect to Wifi the Kindle would shut down and reboot.
B00CYQPM42,23,14,At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem.
B00CYQPM42,23,15,even that would not work.
B00CYQPM42,23,16,it constantly loses my wi-fi singnal (at least 2-3 times per day).
B00CYQPM42,23,17,Some days it works fine but once it starts acting up, it will continuously drop connection every 2 - 10 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,23,18,This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well.
B00CYQPM42,23,19,I don't want to have to turn on Quiet Time all the time just to get this to stop.
B00CYQPM42,23,20,Since I'm not in a rush I really have no issue with this re-download problem.
B00CYQPM42,23,21,Today, I was at Starbucks, where I tried connecting to the internet through their free WIFI service, but failed to connect.
B00CYQPM42,23,22,I have a slow internet connection, and only one option for a service provider.
B00CYQPM42,23,23,I am especially disappointed that my problems have now been written off.
B00CYQPM42,23,24,I continuously have problems with my Kindle not hooking up to my wireless, which in turn makes it a pretty useless device.
B00CYQPM42,24,0,Like HDX very much and wish a touch cover like keyboard case to make it more productive.
B00CYQPM42,24,1,I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times.
B00CYQPM42,24,2,When using it, the screen will all of a sudden disappear.
B00CYQPM42,24,3,For example, something like Surface touch cover.
B00CYQPM42,24,4,Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,24,5,I have to take it out of the case  to start and to shut it down.
B00CYQPM42,24,6,I miss being able to click on the top of the screen to get to settings.
B00CYQPM42,24,7,I wish Amazon could come out some keyboard case for HDX.
B00CYQPM42,24,8,The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,9,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,24,10,This is the second one that the freezing happens so I'm not sure if it's something mechanical or what the reason is for it freezing.
B00CYQPM42,24,11,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,24,12,So my 3 year old son would hand me the tablet every time an ad came up so I could close it for him.
B00CYQPM42,24,13,Some days it works fine but once it starts acting up, it will continuously drop connection every 2 - 10 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,24,14,Except....when I took it to the beach and opened the cover, I didn't see a way to connect to the hotel's wi fi.
B00CYQPM42,24,15,Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One.
B00CYQPM42,24,16,For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit.
B00CYQPM42,24,17,The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!
B00CYQPM42,24,18,It continuously rebooted all day long.
B00CYQPM42,24,19,This screen issue not so much.
B00CYQPM42,24,20,This time, I waited a couple of days to see how it was received by the public and to catch a few of the early reviews before deciding to order.
B00CYQPM42,24,21,Will need to find a way to change the keyboard layout.
B00CYQPM42,24,22,The only thing I don't like is the keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,24,23,Next time I'm buying an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,24,24,I have this unit for several weeks now and since then I have experienced a couple of slow down response and three "blue screens" although the unit is 40%, 80 % and 55 % charged, the first time it came back after 4 hours, the second and third time after several minutes.
B00CYQPM42,25,0,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,25,1,The new screen is sweet too.
B00CYQPM42,25,2,This is a function that works well on other multi-touch devices, but on this kindle it just plain doesn't work well.
B00CYQPM42,25,3,Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.
B00CYQPM42,25,4,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,25,5,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,25,6,You can get most of the Amazon experience with a more conventional Android device.
B00CYQPM42,25,7,There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation.
B00CYQPM42,25,8,Gaming seems to work well except for some second screen features, like Battlefield's Commander app, on my Xbox One.
B00CYQPM42,25,9,I'm more of a gamer, so going onto Amazon to find out that some of the apps I wanted aren't available to the Kindle yet.
B00CYQPM42,25,10,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,25,11,I've got better things to do with my time that hack a product right out of the box.
B00CYQPM42,25,12,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,25,13,Although it should be mentioned that this may be partially be design, since there are many apps that do not work (yet) on this kindle's version of android.
B00CYQPM42,25,14,This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.
B00CYQPM42,25,15,Kindle Fire- best kept secret for devices.
B00CYQPM42,25,16,Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them.
B00CYQPM42,25,17,And the update fixed all the problems I had encountered.
B00CYQPM42,25,18,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,25,19,;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.
B00CYQPM42,25,20,Galaxy tab, Nexus, iPad, iPad mini).
B00CYQPM42,25,21,The Kindle is a terrific device for the price -- and we've not encountered any of the problems mentioned in other reviews.
B00CYQPM42,25,22,For the price of a Kindle Fire HDX, you will not find anything better.
B00CYQPM42,25,23,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,25,24,Would recommend buying a case for this and all kindles since they can be slippery at times.
B00CYQPM42,26,0,The Lack of even a mini USB port.
B00CYQPM42,26,1,Micro USB Connector - Bite it Apple!
B00CYQPM42,26,2,Only thing that is really lacking is a USB port otherwise it is a great little product.
B00CYQPM42,26,3,For the first time ever - a plug adapter is included!
B00CYQPM42,26,4,The USB port sticks out at an odd angle, making it difficult to plug in.
B00CYQPM42,26,5,Amazon is including a plug adapter so you can actually charge the device through a regular electrical outlet.
B00CYQPM42,26,6,Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away.
B00CYQPM42,26,7,The placement of the USB port for charger is a great improvement.
B00CYQPM42,26,8,My phone did and our laptop did but mind showed me a keyboard and asked for a pin????
B00CYQPM42,26,9,The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3.
B00CYQPM42,26,10,It's just very odd and makes charging annoying.2)
B00CYQPM42,26,11,You have to connect it at an angle on the device (around 30 degrees).
B00CYQPM42,26,12,Again, not a huge deal but also something to bear in mind if youre in the market.5
B00CYQPM42,26,13,Except....when I took it to the beach and opened the cover, I didn't see a way to connect to the hotel's wi fi.
B00CYQPM42,26,14,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,26,15,You can no longer use a HDMI device to stream to your TV.
B00CYQPM42,26,16,Now the apostrophe is on the numerical keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,26,17,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,26,18,Then they took away the HDMI port which I use often to play a movies on my TV.
B00CYQPM42,26,19,I gave it one star because of the charging problems that Amazon wouldn't fix.
B00CYQPM42,26,20,I am not taking any stars off of my rating because of the cover.I would buy another one in a heartbeat, if needed - it is that nice.
B00CYQPM42,26,21,If you crave everything Amazon like me, then it is a no brainer to purchase this.
B00CYQPM42,26,22,Watching movies works for me - the 7" screen is probably similar to watching a movie in the seat back screens of an airplane.
B00CYQPM42,26,23,Much better than an iPad.3)
B00CYQPM42,26,24,I could stare at this thing for days (but won't).
B00CYQPM42,27,0,I bought this for my wife and have had it maybe month and everything stopped working can not even unlock screen when you reset it.
B00CYQPM42,27,1,Crashed constantly.
B00CYQPM42,27,2,I got my wife a two year-old USED iPad, and it has worked flawlessly for a year in our possession, never freezing or requiring a hard reboot.
B00CYQPM42,27,3,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,27,4,They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.
B00CYQPM42,27,5,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,27,6,love love love it.
B00CYQPM42,27,7,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,27,8,The only thing is that the HDX has a different look for the Android Operating System which is actually very nice.
B00CYQPM42,27,9,I liked it, but it was too restrictive & locked down.
B00CYQPM42,27,10,love, love, love it.
B00CYQPM42,27,11,Pros and cons of my kindle.
B00CYQPM42,27,12,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,27,13,There's still no GPS in the Wi-Fi HDX, although unless you have the 4G model (which includes GPS), it doesn't matter so much.
B00CYQPM42,27,14,And the possibilities are endless!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!
B00CYQPM42,27,15,I wish you had included a brief pamphlet of instructions.
B00CYQPM42,27,16,Love Love Love.
B00CYQPM42,27,17,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,27,18,LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new Kindle!!
B00CYQPM42,27,19,A fun efficient affordable tablet.
B00CYQPM42,27,20,One of the first things I did in my settings was turn off letting things automatically detect where I am located.
B00CYQPM42,27,21,This was bought for my daughter but her mother and I both love it too.
B00CYQPM42,27,22,I concede that this might have prolonged the delay in getting it set up.
B00CYQPM42,27,23,files, you may not find all the apps you want or need - at this time.
B00CYQPM42,27,24,I'm a senior citizen who loves electronics and love the world of electronics.
B00CYQPM42,28,0,I have contacted support about these problems.
B00CYQPM42,28,1,I am going to contact support again to see if they can help.
B00CYQPM42,28,2,poor support.
B00CYQPM42,28,3,I called customer service AGAIN and asked if I was eligible for a refund and they told me that because this was a replacement device I could not have a refund.
B00CYQPM42,28,4,I want to return it.
B00CYQPM42,28,5,When I called customer service they were great (the reason that this go any stars) I received a replacement and I am having the same issues.
B00CYQPM42,28,6,It took a few days for a very supportive customer service chap from Ireland to sort out the problem.
B00CYQPM42,28,7,Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept.
B00CYQPM42,28,8,The device is 5 months old...After contacting Amazon Kindle support a fourth time, someone finally helped me.
B00CYQPM42,28,9,Very happy customer.
B00CYQPM42,28,10,I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support.
B00CYQPM42,28,11,I have never had a problem with Amazon in all the years that I have been their customer.
B00CYQPM42,28,12,Therefore, I am no longer receiving any more emails about this issue which means the problems are not fixed and now I don't know what to do about it.
B00CYQPM42,28,13,Its a poorly developed product with poor customer service.
B00CYQPM42,28,14,If I had to do it again, I would not buy it and I want to send it back
B00CYQPM42,28,15,I explained this to the tech advisors and they told me to send it back.
B00CYQPM42,28,16,i contacted customer service and it took them a week to send a canned email with instructions on how to load an email.
B00CYQPM42,28,17,Sorry, Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,28,18,This one just irked me one too many times with the return-replace-defective cycle.
B00CYQPM42,28,19,But in the end, I will be returning this device.
B00CYQPM42,28,20,He sent a few emails telling me he was working on the problem and the last email I received stated his superiors said I should update my kindle with the new update because it would fix my problems..
B00CYQPM42,28,21,I called customer care, they helped me quickly reset the device to factory settings and it seemed to have fixed it.
B00CYQPM42,28,22,I am especially disappointed that my problems have now been written off.
B00CYQPM42,28,23,I will be sending it back for a refund.
B00CYQPM42,28,24,not sure of all the gadgets, setting up my e-mail, just asked for help anywhere and time.the
B00CYQPM42,29,0,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,29,1,This is my first time with a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,29,2,Just hanged up with the CS and they assure that is a software feature, and that can be fixed with a software update.
B00CYQPM42,29,3,Otherwise it's a great little machine!
B00CYQPM42,29,4,The device shuts down and restarts while reading.
B00CYQPM42,29,5,I have only two issues: user error and screen resolution.
B00CYQPM42,29,6,A software update was just done, so I had hopes that my troubles were over.
B00CYQPM42,29,7,I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently.
B00CYQPM42,29,8,The only thing I don't like is the keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,29,9,Will need to find a way to change the keyboard layout.
B00CYQPM42,29,10,pro and con.
B00CYQPM42,29,11,Great, but needs a couple small tweeks.
B00CYQPM42,29,12,Difficult to read on a sunny beach but great everywhere else.
B00CYQPM42,29,13,I will continue to update Kindles as you continue to produce them.
B00CYQPM42,29,14,For instance, I have run into a few occasions where it has crashed and restarted.
B00CYQPM42,29,15,The issue has not been fixed.
B00CYQPM42,29,16,I have also run into situations where I've had to reinstall apps for them to work properly again.
B00CYQPM42,29,17,I am going to hold on to my device until mid November and see what happens
B00CYQPM42,29,18,She lives 1000+ miles away so I could not help her with set up and it took her almost 3 weeks to get it set up, so she could use it.
B00CYQPM42,29,19,I miss being able to click on the top of the screen to get to settings.
B00CYQPM42,29,20,Shuts down while reading.
B00CYQPM42,29,21,I will admit there were some bugs while working the device.
B00CYQPM42,29,22,Actually it makes me feel like I need a dummies book to work it
B00CYQPM42,29,23,Have a lot to learn but I'm getting the hang of it.
B00CYQPM42,29,24,I even showed my grown daughter the "offending" screen (saying nothing of the complaints) asking her if she saw anything, anything at all unusual or bothersome about the reading screen.
B007P4YAPK,0,0,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,0,1,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,0,2,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,0,3,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,0,4,it takes excellent pictures: beach wise, whc is very sunny or even in dark places like a church and sunset pix are pretty good,even the rainbow and the clouds  look amazing; i have no problems w/ all my Kindle books....i just love it
B007P4YAPK,0,5,AND the screen is slightly larger than on an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,0,6,I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire.
B007P4YAPK,0,7,I've encountered exactly the same thing on my wife's iPad 3 too many times to count.The screen is very good and in fact better than it needs to be in order to be both functional and pleasurable to use.
B007P4YAPK,0,8,The Amazon ads for the white one also show black.
B007P4YAPK,0,9,I've watched movies while traveling on both this tablet and the iPad and notice very little difference.
B007P4YAPK,0,10,When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.
B007P4YAPK,0,11,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,0,12,HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.
B007P4YAPK,0,13,Now, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as "floaters" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch.Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,0,14,The one problem, which is kindle related, is that there are not folders to organize the many books I carry around with me - a whole library in a very small package.3.
B007P4YAPK,0,15,Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.
B007P4YAPK,0,16,To be honest i truly loved the Xoom which is why i decided to upgraded heck if 2 cores are great 4 must be incredible.
B007P4YAPK,0,17,I've compared my tablet directly to a coworker's iPad 3, and actually prefer the black contrast better on the TF300.
B007P4YAPK,0,18,Guess you can order any color you want as long as it is black.More later.
B007P4YAPK,0,19,The screen resolution isn't as good, but unless you're super picky there's not enough difference for it to matter.
B007P4YAPK,0,20,As far as the display is concerned it is crisp, clear and the colors are beautiful.
B007P4YAPK,0,21,I have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it.
B007P4YAPK,0,22,But people buy this rubbish and leave good reviews because they have not had an iPad in their hands.If you want a tablet get an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,0,23,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,0,24,I ordered blue and got black even though the box said blue.
B007P4YAPK,1,0,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,1,1,Netflix plays beautifully.
B007P4YAPK,1,2,Android tablets can't use all software.
B007P4YAPK,1,3,Adobe flash player and shockwave not available so some movies, etc don't play.
B007P4YAPK,1,4,I went straight for swiftkey3 and works great with the TF300T.Native browser works great.Very little bloatware, thank you ASUS.If your looking for your first tablet you should know: Apps in the android line are NOT up to par with Apple apps, simple truth.
B007P4YAPK,1,5,The app store for Apple is way better.
B007P4YAPK,1,6,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,1,7,Another problem is app to app integration.
B007P4YAPK,1,8,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B007P4YAPK,1,9,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,1,10,Netflix and the music players work well, but what I really use it is for the following:1.
B007P4YAPK,1,11,If you have an android phone, this is the way to go - all my phone apps were added automatically to tablet.4.
B007P4YAPK,1,12,While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps.
B007P4YAPK,1,13,The Google Play lets anyone upload an app and thus even though there are seems to be plenty to choose from, the tablet version of the apps are really stretched out phone apps.
B007P4YAPK,1,14,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,1,15,Though the tablet is a great product.
B007P4YAPK,1,16,And there really is no dearth of tablet specific apps on Android, that's just a myth now.I have returned my device as of now but will be ordering another soon.
B007P4YAPK,1,17,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,1,18,Having problems with mine, it is slow, and sometimes it kicks me out of a program, especially on the internetThe games I download on it are easy to play and we seem to have no problems there.
B007P4YAPK,1,19,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,1,20,It does a great job at everything it does - the only time I ever see lag is multitasking between applications which heavily use the internet - such as a p2p application and netflix at the same time... doesn't work well.
B007P4YAPK,1,21,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,1,22,Apps run quickly and the graphics/screen transitions in Android seem pretty snappy.
B007P4YAPK,1,23,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,1,24,I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general.
B007P4YAPK,2,0,Good price.
B007P4YAPK,2,1,When you compare this tablet to an iPad it's a great buy.
B007P4YAPK,2,2,But its really good for the price!
B007P4YAPK,2,3,I would highly recommend not buying an Asus product.
B007P4YAPK,2,4,I would recommend this to anyone who wants a pretty high spec tablet but without the high end price.
B007P4YAPK,2,5,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,2,6,Great tablet for the first two months.
B007P4YAPK,2,7,This is a great tablet!
B007P4YAPK,2,8,So I decided to write this review.Bottom line: Not recommended product.This product works great for 6 months.
B007P4YAPK,2,9,The price was good at the time but now it is even better of course.
B007P4YAPK,2,10,I would highly recommend if your going to game, get an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,2,11,Buy it now.UpdateI originally bought this for my wife, after spending some time using the tablet, I've decided to purchase another one for myself.
B007P4YAPK,2,12,You can't beat the performance of this tablet for the price.
B007P4YAPK,2,13,Everything is good --- when it is working.I have been using the tablet for less than a month.
B007P4YAPK,2,14,As this was a new model I waited to review - the tablet was great for the first two months - LOVED it!
B007P4YAPK,2,15,It was more money but it works well and has more features.
B007P4YAPK,2,16,Compared to the iPad I recently bought for my wife, it is really nothing much to write home about.
B007P4YAPK,2,17,The good plus is that it is a good affordable tablet to buy which I purely love it despite faults on it.
B007P4YAPK,2,18,price nd user friendliness.
B007P4YAPK,2,19,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,2,20,Awesome Tablet for the price!
B007P4YAPK,2,21,I absolutely love it and am very happy with my choice.
B007P4YAPK,2,22,Overall, for the price of this tablet, I don't think you can get any better!
B007P4YAPK,2,23,Poor quality product.
B007P4YAPK,2,24,A very fast tablet, despite the price, I also bought the dock for it.
B007P4YAPK,3,0,Battery life is poor - I have to recharge it all the time.
B007P4YAPK,3,1,Battery life is around 7 hours for almost constant use.
B007P4YAPK,3,2,See how long the battery lasts.
B007P4YAPK,3,3,The battery still holds an all day charge with moderate usage.
B007P4YAPK,3,4,Had it for 3 days and could not charge it.
B007P4YAPK,3,5,The unit seemed very nice with a lot of good features until 3 days went by and it would not take a charge.
B007P4YAPK,3,6,Battery life is still around 10 hours tablet and 15 hours with keyboard attached (battery in each) running 740p HD movies with wifi and blue tooth off.
B007P4YAPK,3,7,The battery life is very impressive also.My only gripe with this is the screen.
B007P4YAPK,3,8,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,3,9,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,3,10,I last about 2 days of heavy use.
B007P4YAPK,3,11,Being able to use the keyboard was great, and the amount of extended battery life you get from it was amazing.
B007P4YAPK,3,12,On the down side the battery life isn't as good as the iPad's and requires more frequent charging.
B007P4YAPK,3,13,I doubt I ever get advertised battery life but it last a lot longer than a laptop so I am pleased.
B007P4YAPK,3,14,The SL101 screen has a more heavy-duty feel, but doesn't have a second battery.
B007P4YAPK,3,15,But like I said before, that is not needed because the battery is amply sufficient.
B007P4YAPK,3,16,Bad charger-seems to be a problem.... Tablet worked well until I tried to charge it after its first battery drain the first day of use.
B007P4YAPK,3,17,Even just the additional battery life is a thing of beauty alone, as I now always run the device in performance mode (which helps to cut down on lagginess), and still get good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,3,18,toshiba tablets have swappable batteries thereby doubling there usage time with one xtra battery.
B007P4YAPK,3,19,So when both screens are turned on the graphics power is pretty much the same.
B007P4YAPK,3,20,Charging is relatively fast.
B007P4YAPK,3,21,Screen seems pretty robust.
B007P4YAPK,3,22,It feels good, is easy to hold, and the screen is very nice, if not as bright as the Prime.
B007P4YAPK,3,23,If you see the battery symbol is low charge for 8 hours.
B007P4YAPK,3,24,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,4,0,Good enough but could be better!
B007P4YAPK,4,1,The build quality was much better, everything aligned and in place.
B007P4YAPK,4,2,I like the build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,3,The product build quality is not good as well.
B007P4YAPK,4,4,Decent product performance, shoddy build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,5,All in all, I THOUGHT this was going to be a solid product but in the end, the price of the tablet ended up being too good to be true because of the build quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,6,The design and build are both very good.
B007P4YAPK,4,7,Decent sound.8.
B007P4YAPK,4,8,ASUS is the way to go if you all about just quality only without bell and whistles.
B007P4YAPK,4,9,The Tablet itself is of poor quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,10,It feels good, is easy to hold, and the screen is very nice, if not as bright as the Prime.
B007P4YAPK,4,11,Poor quality product.
B007P4YAPK,4,12,I do belive that this is a good tablet, I just think that I got one that is not built quite right.
B007P4YAPK,4,13,To be honest the speaker sounds amazing but, having sound come from only one side kind of puts it out of balance for me.
B007P4YAPK,4,14,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,4,15,Screen seems pretty robust.
B007P4YAPK,4,16,Sound isn't the best (only one speaker), but it does get surprisingly loud for a little thing.Overall, so far I like the TF300 a LOT.
B007P4YAPK,4,17,Although I won't complain too much about it because the speaker is better than that of the prime and is very clear even at the highest level.Display Quality- video quality seems fine,  I watched a lot of YouTube trailers in HD and even watched Sherlock Holmes games of shadows in 720p and Avatar in 1080p and so far video quality seems fine to me and the tablet did not even hiccup.
B007P4YAPK,4,18,The design is nice and it feels pretty sturdy.
B007P4YAPK,4,19,The plastic back cover is of poor quality.
B007P4YAPK,4,20,The screen resolution isn't as good, but unless you're super picky there's not enough difference for it to matter.
B007P4YAPK,4,21,Clearly there are quality issues with it!
B007P4YAPK,4,22,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,4,23,Good value, better options available though.
B007P4YAPK,4,24,Even though the back is plastic (to help with gps/wifi), it feels solid with little flex.4.
B007P4YAPK,5,0,Clearly there are quality issues with it!
B007P4YAPK,5,1,The camera is decent quality, the image is grainy and when zoomed in the image is very jagged/razor-like.
B007P4YAPK,5,2,I can't say how much I love this tablet it's fast quality device with one exception in that Skype video is the very bad!This is a software problem and so I am hopefull that it will be fixed.
B007P4YAPK,5,3,Best tablet with one exception - SKYPE.
B007P4YAPK,5,4,There is something about the camera in the TF201 with indoor light.
B007P4YAPK,5,5,HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.
B007P4YAPK,5,6,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,5,7,Best Android tablet, but quality issues.
B007P4YAPK,5,8,But all and all I like it its a good price.
B007P4YAPK,5,9,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,5,10,All in all it is a decent tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,11,Decent.
B007P4YAPK,5,12,This includes the front-facing camera as well.
B007P4YAPK,5,13,The front facing camera is clearly designed to be used in landscape mode.
B007P4YAPK,5,14,Pretty darn decent for the price.
B007P4YAPK,5,15,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,5,16,So I quickly bought an expensive screen protector since I was sure I would keep it.
B007P4YAPK,5,17,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,5,18,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,5,19,Since  I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT likely to scan Bar or QR codes often, I felt I could live without the autofocus rear camera.
B007P4YAPK,5,20,I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.
B007P4YAPK,5,21,Petty darn good.
B007P4YAPK,5,22,The other thing to consider is video conferencing.
B007P4YAPK,5,23,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,5,24,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,6,0,It out performs most everything out there, has great graphics, and is well made.
B007P4YAPK,6,1,No touch screen, but with the speed diff, I will use it from now on.
B007P4YAPK,6,2,It's fast, smooth and very responsive, to my touch.
B007P4YAPK,6,3,The video is fantastic as well as the response time of the touch screen.
B007P4YAPK,6,4,Has quad core processor, 1 GB RAM, and cannot handle any process intensive tasks.
B007P4YAPK,6,5,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,6,6,Apps run quickly and the graphics/screen transitions in Android seem pretty snappy.
B007P4YAPK,6,7,If anyone can actually tell the difference in speed, they are pretty good, because it is only 0.1MHz difference.
B007P4YAPK,6,8,Tegra 3 is a beast when it comes to games.
B007P4YAPK,6,9,Snappy responses and Tegra 3 video a plus.
B007P4YAPK,6,10,The best processor, decent memory, expandability, and at a price point that doesn't make my checkbook cry.Update for the new (4.3)
B007P4YAPK,6,11,It is very smooth in all 3 of the Asus processor modes.
B007P4YAPK,6,12,I have found that the touchscreen is not very responsive at times.
B007P4YAPK,6,13,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,6,14,The Tegra 3 processor is also very zippy - the only slowdowns I have had with the tablet have been internet connection speed related.
B007P4YAPK,6,15,First off, this is a fast tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,16,The speed is fantastic!
B007P4YAPK,6,17,Very thin, and has a good grip feeling thanks to the textured back.
B007P4YAPK,6,18,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,6,19,Running on normal mode (you have power saver, normal, and performance), this tablets takes on everyday tasks and even some very intensive games like a champ.
B007P4YAPK,6,20,This is not a digital camera replacement but I know that if I ever needed a camera that this tablet can take decent enough pictures for me.- the webcam is also okay,  does not work too well in low light conditions but is good in adequate light levelsProcessor (tegra 3)- I'm so glad that Asus went with a quad core processor this to me increases the longevity of the tablet and the dual core processors in other tablets would have only lasted so long.
B007P4YAPK,6,21,Very responsive to inputs and can run any Android app available.
B007P4YAPK,6,22,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,6,23,I enjoyed the tablet and its performance.
B007P4YAPK,6,24,Light and powerful.
B007P4YAPK,7,0,HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6.
B007P4YAPK,7,1,Plenty of storage space.
B007P4YAPK,7,2,Having said that, I added a Poetic Hardback case which added a lot of stiffness/rigidity to the tablet.I'm very happy with the TF300, screen quality is good, has hdmi out, expandable storage via micro sd card slot, and you can add a USB adapter (which I bought) for external storage.
B007P4YAPK,7,3,Secondly the keyboard has an sd slot which lets you add an additional 32 gb of memory thereby making it a 96 gb tablet beating out both the ipad and the toshibas.
B007P4YAPK,7,4,The memory is 32gb, which is more then enough for most people.
B007P4YAPK,7,5,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,7,6,I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts.
B007P4YAPK,7,7,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,7,8,The prime does come in a 64 gig model but, i find that a 32 works just fine for me especially if you dont mind taking the time to swap out micro sd cards thus making the memory a moot point and i didnt feel like waiting on the toshiba(i like instant gratification).
B007P4YAPK,7,9,Still has full size  SDHC card slot on keyboard (yeah) and a Micro SDHC slot on the tablet  (big time yeah).
B007P4YAPK,7,10,I am ordering the micro SD card to boost additionally the speed and, of course, get more memory.
B007P4YAPK,7,11,It feels good, is easy to hold, and the screen is very nice, if not as bright as the Prime.
B007P4YAPK,7,12,Because you cant beat the price of 96GB pad (32 miniSD + 32gb SD in the Dock + 32 gb internal pad = 96GB), and the Ice Scream Sandwhich OS, and the "Netbook-Like" functionality, I have to give this atleast 4+ stars.Buy this, you will love it.
B007P4YAPK,7,13,The best processor, decent memory, expandability, and at a price point that doesn't make my checkbook cry.Update for the new (4.3)
B007P4YAPK,7,14,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,7,15,Good value, better options available though.
B007P4YAPK,7,16,I have no SD card installed.
B007P4YAPK,7,17,It folds up perfectly, fits in a very small space, and is extremely easy to tote around.
B007P4YAPK,7,18,It works really well and thumb drives pop right up, just like in Windows, when you pop one in.
B007P4YAPK,7,19,Good enough but could be better!
B007P4YAPK,7,20,Bought the Keyboard that only works on this asus product, bought a nice case, and bought a screen protector.
B007P4YAPK,7,21,Some minor downsides include no flash on the back camera (taking pictures can become difficult because of this), a battery life that only lasted between 6-8 hrs, a badly placed speaker that gets muffled if the table is on its back, and no expandable memory.
B007P4YAPK,7,22,Doing some research I discovered this is not an uncommon occurrence with this model unfortunately.
B007P4YAPK,7,23,The Android version of Sky Safari is identical to Apple version and works perfectly...my main reason for getting the ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,7,24,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,8,0,Its good for some things but not others.
B007P4YAPK,8,1,The noted internet work around is to go in to settings > wifi > forget the network, the reenter the network password - volia 52 mbs (unfortunately you need to do this each time you suspend the device).
B007P4YAPK,8,2,I have to do work on a linux server - very easy to ssh to servers at work, and run serious programs there.
B007P4YAPK,8,3,He does state that if it connects to wifi there they would just send it back.
B007P4YAPK,8,4,Really love it for this, so I can take it anywhere, and connect to the internet.
B007P4YAPK,8,5,The wifi works very well, a little better than my laptop (my laptop is a few years old) in fact.
B007P4YAPK,8,6,Wi-Fi has been great and it tethers absolutely great from my phone when I am not in Wi-Fi reach.
B007P4YAPK,8,7,The wifi is very strong, and the thing is really a joy to use in general.
B007P4YAPK,8,8,Web browsing is quite fast (I use Dolphin browser), and once I updated Adobe Flash, flash within web pages works great.
B007P4YAPK,8,9,We are not all computer savvy.
B007P4YAPK,8,10,Also when the tablet wakes up from suspend mode, the wifi connection speed is significantly less.
B007P4YAPK,8,11,When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.
B007P4YAPK,8,12,I loved my TF300 Tablet, and it was beginning to replace my laptop for casual use like email, internet, shopping, banking, etc.
B007P4YAPK,8,13,With the exception of one application, this is a fantastic device to bring while traveling, and for most things more useful than a laptop.
B007P4YAPK,8,14,Works fairly well.
B007P4YAPK,8,15,Wifi reception is so good, it found more servers around my house than any other device I own and has had full strength connected to mine since I fired it up, regardless of where I use it in the house.I was able to easily conect to my main computer via DLNA and stream the music and videos I have stored there.
B007P4YAPK,8,16,And like all laptops.. Wish it had red backlit key letters for low light/dark conditionsBy the way it does support AD HOC wifi which is necessary for me so I can use a SKY FI device to connect wirelessly to my telescopes and operate them remotely...works flawlessly.
B007P4YAPK,8,17,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,8,18,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,8,19,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,8,20,however if you are planning on using this for work or school get something different.
B007P4YAPK,8,21,It's one of the most handy devices for media consumption I've ever used.
B007P4YAPK,8,22,If you are planning on using this tablet for games and other non work/school related things you dont have to search any farther.
B007P4YAPK,8,23,Though the tablet is a great product.
B007P4YAPK,8,24,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,9,0,Touching the screen tips the balance.
B007P4YAPK,9,1,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,9,2,Bought the Keyboard that only works on this asus product, bought a nice case, and bought a screen protector.
B007P4YAPK,9,3,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,9,4,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,9,5,Also, the on screen ASUS keyboard is very glitchy.
B007P4YAPK,9,6,Nice.
B007P4YAPK,9,7,ASUS TF300T Tablet wit Keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,9,8,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,9,9,I originally got it without the keyboard, but then got the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,9,10,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,11,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,9,12,No touch screen, but with the speed diff, I will use it from now on.
B007P4YAPK,9,13,Another issue is the keyboard, while it is really nice to have and actually works well, the keyboard has 4 anti-slip rubber bumbers under it to keep it put while using it, but once you attach the tablet/monitor, the keyboard attaching pocket would have to be swung up from one end while the other end swings down below the keyboard level thus lifting the keyboard from one end making the rear 2 of the rubber anti-slip bumpers ineffective, and the unit now slips easily.
B007P4YAPK,9,14,Coupled with the keyboard dock it makes a pretty good laptop replacement.
B007P4YAPK,9,15,It's fast, smooth and very responsive, to my touch.
B007P4YAPK,9,16,Hey, I have a $10 case for it, and now it feels like leather.
B007P4YAPK,9,17,When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.
B007P4YAPK,9,18,The touch screen worked flawlessly, and it was very responsive.
B007P4YAPK,9,19,If you do get this make sure you get the dock and the case for it.
B007P4YAPK,9,20,Google apps works well, and it is easy with the keyboard to deal with email.8.
B007P4YAPK,9,21,Tablet felt nice and responsive; keyboard dock, unfortunately, broke the charging port.
B007P4YAPK,9,22,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,9,23,Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.
B007P4YAPK,9,24,Touch screen didn't work!
B007P4YAPK,10,0,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,10,1,This Tablet stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,10,2,really wanted this to work.
B007P4YAPK,10,3,Everything is good --- when it is working.I have been using the tablet for less than a month.
B007P4YAPK,10,4,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,10,5,Great tablet for the first two months.
B007P4YAPK,10,6,Makes a great paper weight.
B007P4YAPK,10,7,The product worked great for 2 months.
B007P4YAPK,10,8,Great hardware, buggy software.
B007P4YAPK,10,9,Just doesn't work.
B007P4YAPK,10,10,I do love the size of it and it is easy to use, just too slow.
B007P4YAPK,10,11,I have had my Transformer TF300T since June...loved the tablet...been great.
B007P4YAPK,10,12,I didn't want to go the ipad route.
B007P4YAPK,10,13,I am furious that I can not rely on this device for tasks that are critical for work or school.
B007P4YAPK,10,14,The appearance and handling characteristic are great.
B007P4YAPK,10,15,Loved the tablet until hardware issue...
B007P4YAPK,10,16,I bought this for my wife as an update from a first gen IPAD.
B007P4YAPK,10,17,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,10,18,Just got it last week - love it!
B007P4YAPK,10,19,and was not even that great
B007P4YAPK,10,20,Was great.... Now Sucks !!! First, let me start by saying that there are not enough stars  to rate this device WHEN IT WAS RUNNING ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich).
B007P4YAPK,10,21,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,10,22,An I-Pad Competer.
B007P4YAPK,10,23,I love it, but there is room for improvement.
B007P4YAPK,10,24,Of course though, all of those downsides are not too terrible and most of them can be worked around.
B007P4YAPK,11,0,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,11,1,Not necessary if you get the keyboard, however, as the keyboard has a full sized usb port built in.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Just found out that standard USB chargers (of any amperage) do not charge this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,11,2,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,11,3,Now, the SL101's keyboard is OK.
B007P4YAPK,11,4,I would have liked to be able to use the keyboard from a distance, without it being connected to the tablet, which would have been nice considering the HDMI port.
B007P4YAPK,11,5,Using the provided transformer, the tablet and keyboard are recharged within a few hours.The keyboard has support for 1 USB port, which I did not try yet except to recharge my phone.
B007P4YAPK,11,6,The keyboard on the SL101 takes a little getting used to, but the TF300 is natural right off the bat.
B007P4YAPK,11,7,I still prefer to be able to have additional power instead, but it would have been a nice feature to have bluetooth on the keyboard too.
B007P4YAPK,11,8,Still has full size  SDHC card slot on keyboard (yeah) and a Micro SDHC slot on the tablet  (big time yeah).
B007P4YAPK,11,9,The SL101 has a keyboard built into it and is marginally lighter than the TF300 with the keyboard attached.
B007P4YAPK,11,10,I never tried to see if the old keyboard would work on the new one...the new one is a bit different...has one USB port instead of two (negative).
B007P4YAPK,11,11,I purchased the keyboard dock and a bluetooth mouse to accompany the TF300.
B007P4YAPK,11,12,The TF300 when detached from the keyboard is very light.
B007P4YAPK,11,13,That cable that comes with it can get power from an ordinary USB port, but the amount of power would be so low it would take the whole day to recharge from a standard USB.
B007P4YAPK,11,14,Also, the keyboards don't appear to be getting stocked anymore, so, if you're going to get one, get one soon.Also, if you get this tablet, this is a handy addition: ASUS USB Kit for Eee Pad Transformer TF101, TF101G, TF201 & TF300 Tablets  This is a dongle that plugs into the charging port and allows you to use USB devices (Hard Drive, thumb drive, keyboard, mouse, gaming pad) with the pad.
B007P4YAPK,11,15,We bought the keyboard to get the extra battery life, and it is good for that, but the keyboard itself does not work well unless it is on a perfectly flat, stable surface.
B007P4YAPK,11,16,My friend prefers a standard mouse and can use his USB mouse no problem.
B007P4YAPK,11,17,It also plugs into the keyboard to recharge it independently, or to recharge both it and the tablet when they are assembled together, all the while still using the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,11,18,Ultimately, the mouse on Android is not that great of an add-on.
B007P4YAPK,11,19,The USB connection to my PC allows me to read this tablet like a hard drive.
B007P4YAPK,11,20,The keyboard has keys that make it possible to use the tablet entirely without touching it, but unfortunately, the bluetooth button is only used to activate/deactivate the tablet's bluetooth.
B007P4YAPK,11,21,Although I didn't buy it, I like the docking keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,11,22,And since one end of the cable is a true USB connector (the end that goes in the transformer) you could buy a USB extension cable (male/female) if 6 feet is not enough for you, and you don't want to bring an electrical extension cord closer to you.
B007P4YAPK,11,23,The screen could be better but its more than adequate, plenty of memory for the price with room to grow like a Micro SD slot and with the optional keyboard dock you get a full size SD slot plus you get a full size USB port for attaching external storage devices if you really are one of those that carries movie and music collections around.There's many positive things about this tablet but the one that impresses me the most is "optional" keyboard dock that turns this thing into a mini 10" notebook with a very usable keyboard and it closes and opens just like a notebook and it adds 5 extra hours of battery life.
B007P4YAPK,11,24,Also, when you have the screen at the best angle it can get (pretty much all the way back), when you touch the screen it has a tendency to tilt back because of the very fine balance the keyboard and the screen have.
B007P4YAPK,12,0,The home screen was nice, and pretty customizable.
B007P4YAPK,12,1,This is a really nice tablet with the up to date Android operating system and is easy to navigate.
B007P4YAPK,12,2,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,12,3,It feels light and thin for its size.
B007P4YAPK,12,4,You get a fast system, nice screen, the Ice Cream Sandwich with it.
B007P4YAPK,12,5,Very thin, and has a good grip feeling thanks to the textured back.
B007P4YAPK,12,6,The design is nice and it feels pretty sturdy.
B007P4YAPK,12,7,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,12,8,While the screen is not super IPS and thus is a little bit hard to use in direct sunlight, the screen is more than bright enough for easy use in every other situation.
B007P4YAPK,12,9,The design is also great.
B007P4YAPK,12,10,Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) is excellent.
B007P4YAPK,12,11,The TF300 actually makes a pretty good little word processor.
B007P4YAPK,12,12,Used to be good stuff; now it's cheap junky construction that has to be handled like eggshells, and even then, the screen will crack.
B007P4YAPK,12,13,Not good when one of the touted features is the display.
B007P4YAPK,12,14,And TF300 is **very easy** to have the screen broken.
B007P4YAPK,12,15,However, one of the main reasons I got this tablet was its upgrade to the Ice Cream Sandwich OS, and with the exception of the ability to make folders and thereby only needing one screen for all of my apps (I always have many more than I need), I'm NOT impressed with that new operating system.
B007P4YAPK,12,16,It mostly worked, but not always, and not as fast as I'd have preferred, and it took a lot of tweaking.
B007P4YAPK,12,17,Pretty darn decent for the price.
B007P4YAPK,12,18,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,12,19,The whole operation is much faster.
B007P4YAPK,12,20,I have actually used this tablet in sunlight, but in order to see clearly the sun must be at an angle, the screen at max brightness, and the background preferably in white or light color.Operating System (Ice Cream Sandwich)- This is my first android device and all I can say is Wow, kudos to Google.
B007P4YAPK,12,21,Switching between the screens is faster, smoother, and more seamless.
B007P4YAPK,12,22,Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.
B007P4YAPK,12,23,Awesome Tablet for the price!
B007P4YAPK,12,24,So when both screens are turned on the graphics power is pretty much the same.
B007P4YAPK,13,0,Though the tablet is a great product.
B007P4YAPK,13,1,The tablet was shipped USPS and was shipped on Tuesday.
B007P4YAPK,13,2,Good product, had shipping issues.
B007P4YAPK,13,3,This is the first time I've had to return a product to Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,13,4,I also paid for expedited 2 day shipping.I did NOT get 2 day expedited shipping.
B007P4YAPK,13,5,Great product; even better customer service.
B007P4YAPK,13,6,6 weeks later, the product was returned and it works for 1 month.
B007P4YAPK,13,7,I contacted Asus and they said it was a manufacturer defect and to return it.
B007P4YAPK,13,8,New Product Ordered but refurb received.
B007P4YAPK,13,9,If I had known it was going to be like this, I personally would not have purchased it.
B007P4YAPK,13,10,This is the second asus tablet I received from Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,13,11,This Tablet stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,13,12,No warranty or support.
B007P4YAPK,13,13,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B007P4YAPK,13,14,Full Disclosure: I did not buy this product from Amazon, but from Staples.
B007P4YAPK,13,15,I ordered this tablet because of the price and the company reviews.
B007P4YAPK,13,16,Poor quality product.
B007P4YAPK,13,17,This product may be right for someone, but not me since the Android phone I currently have has the same features as this and I really do not need two devices so similar.
B007P4YAPK,13,18,SO I contacted ASUS Support and got it repaired, but the the problems were not completely fixed.
B007P4YAPK,13,19,However, I wanted to review this product in general.I bought it in March 2012, and the product started to have multiple problems in September 2012.
B007P4YAPK,13,20,I sent the unit in for repair and it was returned without the problems being addressed.
B007P4YAPK,13,21,ASUS support staff is hit or miss, but the replacement unit is excellent and has no issues.
B007P4YAPK,13,22,It costs me $20 to mail the product to Texas to repair.
B007P4YAPK,13,23,It took about 3 weeks until the tablet returned and about one week later the problem returned.I sent it to ASUS repair again, and it was returned about 3 weeks later.
B007P4YAPK,13,24,The technicians and tech support are not very knowledgeable and have no authority to help you.
B007P4YAPK,14,0,Its good for some things but not others.
B007P4YAPK,14,1,is Android 4.0 stable at all? was looking at ASUS TRansformer and Samsung Galaxy android 4 devices.
B007P4YAPK,14,2,It was great until the last OS upgrade.
B007P4YAPK,14,3,AND the screen is slightly larger than on an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,14,4,Ultimately, the mouse on Android is not that great of an add-on.
B007P4YAPK,14,5,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,14,6,The touch screen worked flawlessly, and it was very responsive.
B007P4YAPK,14,7,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,14,8,Tab screen keep clicking and moving by itself.
B007P4YAPK,14,9,I used it extensively as it is a great tablet PC with fantastic functionality, speed, software, etc.
B007P4YAPK,14,10,Love android apps.
B007P4YAPK,14,11,3/4/2013:  Just installed the Android 4.2 update to this thing and it rocks!
B007P4YAPK,14,12,I bought the tablet based on several reviews that claimed it was about the best android tablet on the market then--given its speed, innovation, affordability, and upgradeable android OS.
B007P4YAPK,14,13,The Android OS is not quite up with the user interfaces we would expect with Microsoft Office or Apple products.
B007P4YAPK,14,14,Some of the problem is probably Windows stuff but the Windows machines don't even see the tablet but the tablet sees the Windows machines.
B007P4YAPK,14,15,Unfortunately, the two main business software applications I planned to use require a Windows OS.
B007P4YAPK,14,16,Half the price, 32GB with solid OS, and ample Android ( which really isn't bad) software availability.
B007P4YAPK,14,17,A stylus provides a better experience.
B007P4YAPK,14,18,Considering the mediocre resolution (1280X800) the screen was actually bright and decent, although it took a little while for me to get used to it, considering it replaced my retina iPad.
B007P4YAPK,14,19,The Android version of Sky Safari is identical to Apple version and works perfectly...my main reason for getting the ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,14,20,The screen is beautiful.
B007P4YAPK,14,21,Scrolling between screens is smooth and software loading is fast and responsive.Now the bad - and I will caveat, this is only my experience, so I can't say if it is common or not.
B007P4YAPK,14,22,*UPDATE*:  No longer applicable with subsequent software upgrades.As for ASUS, they make rock solid PC parts, so I was thinking this would rock.
B007P4YAPK,14,23,Screen seems pretty robust.
B007P4YAPK,14,24,The button to turn off the mouse pad is your best friend, because the mouse is very easy to touch with your thumb while you type and in turn moves focus on your screen to something else.
B007P4YAPK,15,0,Screen tearing issues.
B007P4YAPK,15,1,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,15,2,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B007P4YAPK,15,3,Tablet two appeared to have a foreign object stuck under the glass of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,4,drops, excessive pressure, something being dropped on to the screen, misuse, etc.).
B007P4YAPK,15,5,My sister has the New iPad and yes I can tell the difference in the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,6,But about a month ago, I noticed small little blotches in my screen that are white to greyish in color, but are only visible when the screen is displaying deep blacks.
B007P4YAPK,15,7,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,8,Not noticeable when it's on, but unmistakable when the screen is dark.Otherwise, it's beautiful, light, functional and zippy.
B007P4YAPK,15,9,There are several others who have had the cracked screen problem.
B007P4YAPK,15,10,The screen was okay other than some backlight bleeding along the edges.
B007P4YAPK,15,11,I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb.
B007P4YAPK,15,12,Great tablet but fragile screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,13,But I noticed the replacement has a different issue: a gap along the bezzel on the left side of the screen near the volume button.
B007P4YAPK,15,14,I would have been fine if the color was washed out like the bottom or bright white like the top, but the gradient just annoyed me.
B007P4YAPK,15,15,This is actually my second TF300 that has had issues with the display as the first tablet I bought had really bad problems with what looks like bad contrasts that caused my screen to make very distinct graduations between colors when they were gradually going from a black to white like a fading sensation.
B007P4YAPK,15,16,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,15,17,Needless to say the GPS was better as well.You can definitely notice a difference in the screen resolution, the TF300 is not as sharp on the colors.
B007P4YAPK,15,18,Bad Pixel.
B007P4YAPK,15,19,Tablet three had a dead pixel near the center of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,20,Tablet one had a stuck-on pixel close to the center of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,15,21,The ASUS screen brightness was also a weak point, I had to take it out of the auto brightness mode and crank it up to get a decent brightness level even indoors, when placed next to the i-pad, the sharpness and the brightness weakness of the ASUS really stood out.
B007P4YAPK,15,22,However, the second one still had a dead pixel.
B007P4YAPK,15,23,I got it from a shop, Worked well, but noticed a dead pixel on the first one.
B007P4YAPK,15,24,The screen brightness is fine for indoors but outdoors in daylight forget it.
B007P4YAPK,16,0,There are many ugly Apps that do not work well.
B007P4YAPK,16,1,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,16,2,When I end-task on some Apps, they relaunch at same state.
B007P4YAPK,16,3,The Google Play lets anyone upload an app and thus even though there are seems to be plenty to choose from, the tablet version of the apps are really stretched out phone apps.
B007P4YAPK,16,4,already downloaded and used dozens of apps and games from the Google store, as well as set up Kindle access and several news feeds and apps, and pretty much everything else I wanted.
B007P4YAPK,16,5,I didn't have an opportunity to use it for the Amazon Prime Instant Videos before it stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,16,6,(Other android devices do with no problem).
B007P4YAPK,16,7,In Apple world we have millions of apps to choose from the App Store and those are mostly high quality apps.
B007P4YAPK,16,8,If I launch an app, I often have to wait up to 5 seconds before I can even interact with anything in the app.
B007P4YAPK,16,9,(too late for the apps that are already installed on it by Asus).
B007P4YAPK,16,10,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,16,11,And I've had no problem finding apps on Google Play to fill all of my needs.
B007P4YAPK,16,12,If the user does not accept the permission the apps is not installed.
B007P4YAPK,16,13,If they are critical to the OS, then these Apps should be hidden.
B007P4YAPK,16,14,This happens for multiple apps, which is why I suspect the problem is NOT the applications.The crashing needs to be fixed.
B007P4YAPK,16,15,Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you.
B007P4YAPK,16,16,I am not talking about just app crashing, but for some reason apps cause the whole system to reboot.
B007P4YAPK,16,17,Using the Flash Player crashes after a while.
B007P4YAPK,16,18,Great product only one issue, Adobe Flash says it is not supporting this version of android OS which makes viewing certain web pages not possible.
B007P4YAPK,16,19,I got this fixed simply installing the app "juicy defender plus"Tegra 3 compatibility issues with several games, most of them fixed after rebooting, the game just freeze after 10-15 seconds.
B007P4YAPK,16,20,I bought this to stream Netflix and Amazon movies.
B007P4YAPK,16,21,The only other small problem I've had is when maximizing Youtube videos to full-screen - sometimes it doesn't play correctly, (EDIT 070612 -- the Youtube App automatically updated recently and I no longer sometimes have a problem with maximizing video - it works perfectly now every time.)I've
B007P4YAPK,16,22,I download audio books from the library so am not next to the tablet all the time.
B007P4YAPK,16,23,Still waiting for the games to start showing up for it in the play storeAnother plus is the support and following this tablet is seeing at Xda forums already.
B007P4YAPK,16,24,Asus pre-installs some apps for you, but do you really need those?
B007P4YAPK,17,0,Don't buy.
B007P4YAPK,17,1,ok for the money.
B007P4YAPK,17,2,Not good product.
B007P4YAPK,17,3,So, like the title of my review says, this will be my last Asus purchase.
B007P4YAPK,17,4,I orginally purchased this product in January.
B007P4YAPK,17,5,I bought this in May and I waited until now to review this product so I know I have tried everything there is to it.
B007P4YAPK,17,6,It is a waste of money
B007P4YAPK,17,7,This was purchased expecting it to last well.
B007P4YAPK,17,8,My first tablet, my last ASUS product.
B007P4YAPK,17,9,What a waste of money, I could Just Puke!!!
B007P4YAPK,17,10,I used to buy Asus productsd all the time.
B007P4YAPK,17,11,It  is good product, but it may be not good for games.
B007P4YAPK,17,12,Unfortunately, a disappointing product.
B007P4YAPK,17,13,Buy another brand!
B007P4YAPK,17,14,I will never buy ASUS again.
B007P4YAPK,17,15,I'm 62 years old and have dealt with quite a few.I will NEVER, EVER, buy any ASUS product again and will never recommend that company.
B007P4YAPK,17,16,not as good as the reviews.
B007P4YAPK,17,17,Bought this tablet in February.
B007P4YAPK,17,18,Do not purchase this product you may regret it in the end and could end up spending more then you think for this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,17,19,I recently bought a Zenbook.
B007P4YAPK,17,20,ASUS review.
B007P4YAPK,17,21,Never buying anymore from Asus.
B007P4YAPK,17,22,Do not buy this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,17,23,Guess I should have bought an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,17,24,Very disappointed in Asus.
B007P4YAPK,18,0,It would charge then stop charging in a contual cycle.
B007P4YAPK,18,1,I tried some temp fixes to try and get it charged again.
B007P4YAPK,18,2,WON'T CHARGE.
B007P4YAPK,18,3,Now the power doesn't seem to work.
B007P4YAPK,18,4,Power doesn't work...
B007P4YAPK,18,5,Now I can't turn it on.
B007P4YAPK,18,6,My tablet would not charge from either charger, but both chargers work with her tablet.
B007P4YAPK,18,7,It worked for 4 days before it would not turn on.
B007P4YAPK,18,8,I plugged it in and did not get the battery symbol.
B007P4YAPK,18,9,If you see the battery symbol is low charge for 8 hours.
B007P4YAPK,18,10,Another charger is $30--will I have the same problen with that one?
B007P4YAPK,18,11,Had it for 3 days and could not charge it.
B007P4YAPK,18,12,Sometimes the system says there is no battery after it was charging for several times.
B007P4YAPK,18,13,Bad charger-seems to be a problem.... Tablet worked well until I tried to charge it after its first battery drain the first day of use.
B007P4YAPK,18,14,This time i couldn't turn it back on.
B007P4YAPK,18,15,does not turn on.
B007P4YAPK,18,16,I have had this unit for a month plus 4 days and it will no longer charge.
B007P4YAPK,18,17,The battery is full, but the thing keeps turning off.
B007P4YAPK,18,18,They all DO NOT charge when plugged in, which eventually runs down the battery in the tablet when you are trying to use both as a unit.
B007P4YAPK,18,19,I usually get 2 days out of it before I charge it.
B007P4YAPK,18,20,This tablet was used no more than two hours a day.
B007P4YAPK,18,21,When the battery is very low, even if it's plugged in, you cannot turn it on for 5 minutes or so until it charges up a little (not sure this is specific to only this tablet).5.
B007P4YAPK,18,22,It would not power up so I left it on the charger for 12 hours and still nothing.
B007P4YAPK,18,23,It keeps turning off.
B007P4YAPK,18,24,However, within about a month, it started turning itself completely off, and It started to get cumbersome turning it back on.
B007P4YAPK,19,0,I was trying in several environments to discard any sound source, but always it recorded the sound with the whistle.
B007P4YAPK,19,1,Bad video recording sound.
B007P4YAPK,19,2,Quality control issue.
B007P4YAPK,19,3,Cannot believe the lack of quality!
B007P4YAPK,19,4,I bought this tablet in February of 2013 and it stopped working (no video, no audio) in June, 2014.
B007P4YAPK,19,5,Feels cheap.
B007P4YAPK,19,6,Will never buy Asus again, seems like their quality control is horrible.
B007P4YAPK,19,7,ASUS definitely needs better quality control.
B007P4YAPK,19,8,I Buy ASUS TF300 in nov/2012, it is very good product... almost, I got a problem: When I video recording, it is recording the video with a whistle sound included...
B007P4YAPK,19,9,It works extremely well....  Until you shave.
B007P4YAPK,19,10,As for speakers, it only has one, on the right (or bottom) side.
B007P4YAPK,19,11,I am extremely disappointed.
B007P4YAPK,19,12,On the downside, the rear speaker is pretty marginal and poorly placed.
B007P4YAPK,19,13,After a short while, I find out the screen does not respond to touch on the narrow edge near the headphone jack.
B007P4YAPK,19,14,I hear it is pretty good with Skype too, but I did not try that.
B007P4YAPK,19,15,I discovered it problem disappeared when I video recorded while I was charging the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,19,16,I click record, click it again to end, click the preview to watch it in gallery and it starts to record again.
B007P4YAPK,19,17,Even if there were 2, there is no way you could get stereo sound with speakers so close together, so one is enough.I decided to buy the matching keyboard for it, and now when I show friends my purchase they say "Oh!
B007P4YAPK,19,18,There are several others who have had the cracked screen problem.
B007P4YAPK,19,19,Terrible terrible product.
B007P4YAPK,19,20,Seems it may work a little too well.
B007P4YAPK,19,21,Back in mid-July I was on the couch using the tablet (without the keyboard) when the touch screen just stopped responding.
B007P4YAPK,19,22,Very disappointed in Asus.
B007P4YAPK,19,23,Sound isn't the best (only one speaker), but it does get surprisingly loud for a little thing.Overall, so far I like the TF300 a LOT.
B007P4YAPK,19,24,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,20,0,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B007P4YAPK,20,1,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,20,2,The camera has become completely useless.
B007P4YAPK,20,3,While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 table discussed below.
B007P4YAPK,20,4,I was quite disappointed, because overall I loved this little tablet.Without a good reason, the screen broke, with a U-shaped, single crack in the middle of it.
B007P4YAPK,20,5,bad digitizer and no manufacturer suppor.
B007P4YAPK,20,6,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,20,7,Also the DDMS does not connect so you cannot take a screen shot.Conclusion:So to conclude it is a cheap knock-off made by the lowest bidder out of inferior materials and low budget workmanship.
B007P4YAPK,20,8,If you want to hack and crack it I am sure it gets better, but you shouldn't have to!
B007P4YAPK,20,9,However, I did find a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,20,10,Maybe the case warped somehow (a sort of torque-twist might have caused that strange crack), but it wasn't treated harshly in any way.
B007P4YAPK,20,11,So I do like the tablet and it works great, when it works.
B007P4YAPK,20,12,I asked why I needed to do this when they asked for a picture.
B007P4YAPK,20,13,This especially seems true when I use Skype.
B007P4YAPK,20,14,Other times, it shuts off for no reason.
B007P4YAPK,20,15,I would recommend this to anyone who wants a pretty high spec tablet but without the high end price.
B007P4YAPK,20,16,They acknowledged the picture, gave me a case number and a number to call.
B007P4YAPK,20,17,Which is somewhat annoying for development on this unit.
B007P4YAPK,20,18,(Other android devices do with no problem).
B007P4YAPK,20,19,Then 5 stars absolutely.
B007P4YAPK,20,20,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,20,21,Cannot believe the lack of quality!
B007P4YAPK,20,22,I really want to love this device because it worked perfectly at other times.
B007P4YAPK,20,23,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,20,24,I bought this unit for development.
B007P4YAPK,21,0,Besides quad core the tablet is very slow in response.
B007P4YAPK,21,1,Too slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,2,I would expect it to do a lot and very fast but it hangs and is very slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,3,It single handedly promotes slow boot up as well as weak app performance and slow sync.
B007P4YAPK,21,4,I am also very disappointed with NVDia, this processor is a piece of crap.
B007P4YAPK,21,5,disappointed in the performance.
B007P4YAPK,21,6,It does not shutdown like others have put it but I would not call it a highend quad core processor.
B007P4YAPK,21,7,Personally not a fan of Samsung either, but hey I would bet that it performs well than this piece of junk even though the processor is dual core only.-
B007P4YAPK,21,8,There are not enough tablet optimized Apps, but many stretched out phone Apps... Jelly Bean is slow and not very responsive while multi-tasking.
B007P4YAPK,21,9,There are many ugly Apps that do not work well.
B007P4YAPK,21,10,My iPad 2 is fast, reliable, great looking Apps, and very responsive to EVERYTHING.
B007P4YAPK,21,11,That is the same performance I expect from a tablet and this ASUS never has, not even when new.
B007P4YAPK,21,12,It may have a quadcore, lots of ram, and a nice GPU in it, but all this hardware is useless because Jelly Bean cannot utilize the hardware very well.
B007P4YAPK,21,13,Its ok if you use it just for that but dont expect this to do anything more.
B007P4YAPK,21,14,When I end-task on some Apps, they relaunch at same state.
B007P4YAPK,21,15,However, it is still slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,16,This runs like its a single core processor from the 1990's.I bought this for my kid so that she can watch movies on it.
B007P4YAPK,21,17,The single biggest detriment contributing to my rating is the poor Wi-Fi performance.
B007P4YAPK,21,18,I sent it back and got the Samsung Galaxy tab2.
B007P4YAPK,21,19,If they are critical to the OS, then these Apps should be hidden.
B007P4YAPK,21,20,Great computer, until the power socket went bad.
B007P4YAPK,21,21,This thing is fast, enough ram, do not have to constantly kill background apps.
B007P4YAPK,21,22,Lot of bloatware apps included that makes your tablet slower than it already is.-
B007P4YAPK,21,23,The Jelly Bean OS don't have well control over the running Apps.
B007P4YAPK,21,24,The processor may not have the same specs but the samsung responds correctly and feels faster than the Transformer could ever be.
B007P4YAPK,22,0,I have no SD card installed.
B007P4YAPK,22,1,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B007P4YAPK,22,2,I am ordering the micro SD card to boost additionally the speed and, of course, get more memory.
B007P4YAPK,22,3,Thus SD storage is not available during debugging.
B007P4YAPK,22,4,It treats SD cards like you're only swapping a bit of data and taking it out.
B007P4YAPK,22,5,I bought a 32gb memory upgrade but due to the huge 32gb internal memory of which I've used about 10gb so far I've just used the additional memory for a hefty chunk of my music collection and podcasts.
B007P4YAPK,22,6,The tablet has difficulty recognizing a microSD card when it is plugged in.
B007P4YAPK,22,7,I aim to leave the internal memory primarily for apps and app data - I'm sure it will take many years for me to even approach filling it up.Android 4 (ICS) is an absolute joy to use, much better than I anticipated.
B007P4YAPK,22,8,I have never found an app that is "incompatible" with this model.
B007P4YAPK,22,9,One annoyance: plugging in a SD card, and having it treat it like a forever-external drive that it's compelled to constantly have a notification of it's foreign-ness.
B007P4YAPK,22,10,If the user does not accept the permission the apps is not installed.
B007P4YAPK,22,11,It doesn't care that you put it in there because you wanted more space for the tablet alone!
B007P4YAPK,22,12,Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you.
B007P4YAPK,22,13,I can't tell you how annoying lack of updates was with my phone.
B007P4YAPK,22,14,I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable!
B007P4YAPK,22,15,(Other android devices do with no problem).
B007P4YAPK,22,16,I am not talking about just app crashing, but for some reason apps cause the whole system to reboot.
B007P4YAPK,22,17,HDMI out and mirco SD card slot.6.
B007P4YAPK,22,18,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,22,19,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,22,20,Having said that, I added a Poetic Hardback case which added a lot of stiffness/rigidity to the tablet.I'm very happy with the TF300, screen quality is good, has hdmi out, expandable storage via micro sd card slot, and you can add a USB adapter (which I bought) for external storage.
B007P4YAPK,22,21,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,22,22,Plenty of storage space.
B007P4YAPK,22,23,SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark.
B007P4YAPK,22,24,Now my tablet has trouble recognizing me.
B007P4YAPK,23,0,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,23,1,Restarting the device fixed the problem temporarily.
B007P4YAPK,23,2,Touchsreen problems within 10 days.
B007P4YAPK,23,3,Too slow.
B007P4YAPK,23,4,The WiFi is slow, even though I have a high speed N network using a top-notch wireless router.
B007P4YAPK,23,5,But you will still receive notifications and stay connected to wifi once screen is off.
B007P4YAPK,23,6,Browsing the Internet crashes.
B007P4YAPK,23,7,Apps, browser and native email program freeze up all the time, probably about 10-20% of the time.3.
B007P4YAPK,23,8,Nothing but problems.
B007P4YAPK,23,9,Several times per days like lugs or something.
B007P4YAPK,23,10,Give me the simplicity and functionality of an Android device like this any day.
B007P4YAPK,23,11,Fortunately, it is not my primary computing device.
B007P4YAPK,23,12,I don't want a $600 device.
B007P4YAPK,23,13,Generally the ASUS is ok, but it had a hard time picking up a strong wi-fi signal at home so the download was too slow and sometimes it would time out, while the i-pad had a full signal strength.
B007P4YAPK,23,14,According to them ASUS is not doing anything to fix the problem.
B007P4YAPK,23,15,from day one I have had trouble with the device being a little slow and if I let things get backed up it'll crash.
B007P4YAPK,23,16,OK, but screen not bright enough for out doors and weak WiFi signal pickup.
B007P4YAPK,23,17,He does state that if it connects to wifi there they would just send it back.
B007P4YAPK,23,18,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,23,19,And I'm sure they'll address the web browser in the next update.
B007P4YAPK,23,20,A re-installation of the app usually fixes this problem.
B007P4YAPK,23,21,Everything worked for nearly 9 days.
B007P4YAPK,23,22,Searched internet and found out this is a major problem with other users.
B007P4YAPK,23,23,This tablet has a lot of problems.
B007P4YAPK,23,24,We first tried a factory reset but it did not resolve the problem.
B007P4YAPK,24,0,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,24,1,Touch screen didn't work!
B007P4YAPK,24,2,The screen immediately stopped reacting to touch.
B007P4YAPK,24,3,Cracked Screen.
B007P4YAPK,24,4,Screen Cracked while in Dock.
B007P4YAPK,24,5,Then touch screen started behaving crazy.
B007P4YAPK,24,6,Then touch screen started behaving crazy.
B007P4YAPK,24,7,Back in mid-July I was on the couch using the tablet (without the keyboard) when the touch screen just stopped responding.
B007P4YAPK,24,8,The touch screen stopped responding but for awhile I could dock it to the keyboard and it would respond.
B007P4YAPK,24,9,When i recieved my tf-300, the touch screen didn't work.
B007P4YAPK,24,10,Touching the screen tips the balance.
B007P4YAPK,24,11,The touch screen is non-responsive at times and when it does work it begins to freeze, skip and jump.
B007P4YAPK,24,12,Constantly Freezes, touch screen stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,24,13,There are several others who have had the cracked screen problem.
B007P4YAPK,24,14,ASUS TF 300 touch screen quit after 5 weeks.
B007P4YAPK,24,15,The touch screen does not work correctly.
B007P4YAPK,24,16,When we received the tablet back the touch screen worked perfectly.
B007P4YAPK,24,17,Even when we're not touching or using the tablet I noticed it just reboots itself.
B007P4YAPK,24,18,Several times per days like lugs or something.
B007P4YAPK,24,19,This tablet was great ... for a month, then the touch screen became unresponsive for no apparent reason.
B007P4YAPK,24,20,Screen tearing issues.
B007P4YAPK,24,21,Problem is....even if I am not even touching that area it is now doing it.
B007P4YAPK,24,22,Kept getting touches not registering, and phantom touches registering where I wasn't touching.They sent the same unit back with the same problems.
B007P4YAPK,24,23,Also, when you have the screen at the best angle it can get (pretty much all the way back), when you touch the screen it has a tendency to tilt back because of the very fine balance the keyboard and the screen have.
B007P4YAPK,24,24,After waking it up it may take 5-10 seconds before it starts responding to touching the screen.
B007P4YAPK,25,0,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,25,1,My sister has the New iPad and yes I can tell the difference in the screen.
B007P4YAPK,25,2,I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire.
B007P4YAPK,25,3,(Other android devices do with no problem).
B007P4YAPK,25,4,I would not buy this for a personal everyday use, because this is an Android device, which is an inferior product to the Apple iPad.
B007P4YAPK,25,5,I don't want a $600 device.
B007P4YAPK,25,6,This device runs Android 2.3.
B007P4YAPK,25,7,I have tried numerous times to upload new updates hoping it would fix how crappy this tablet works.Time to take it back.
B007P4YAPK,25,8,At first I was thinking I wouldn't be able to tell the difference... but I was wrong.This does not make me want to get the New iPad however, because I don't like the "Apple" way of doing things.
B007P4YAPK,25,9,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,25,10,Also, the on screen ASUS keyboard is very glitchy.
B007P4YAPK,25,11,Give me the simplicity and functionality of an Android device like this any day.
B007P4YAPK,25,12,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,25,13,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,25,14,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,25,15,Asus TF300 tablet.
B007P4YAPK,25,16,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,25,17,All the great reviews made me believe this tablet might work out of the box.
B007P4YAPK,25,18,I've purchased five iPads over the years, starting with the very first generation and none had screen issues; neither did my Samsung Galaxy Tab.
B007P4YAPK,25,19,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,25,20,Software-wise, ASUS tends to give you more liberty than others, like motorola, samsung, apple, etc. You'll get OTA updates a lot, enough to make you feel like you're not being left out.
B007P4YAPK,25,21,Never buying anymore from Asus.
B007P4YAPK,25,22,There are many ugly Apps that do not work well.
B007P4YAPK,25,23,But people buy this rubbish and leave good reviews because they have not had an iPad in their hands.If you want a tablet get an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,25,24,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,26,0,I don't like the propriety plug, and the no USB port.
B007P4YAPK,26,1,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,26,2,The tablet did not have POWER and so put the charger cable on.The table did not charge.
B007P4YAPK,26,3,Then my HDMI port got a short.
B007P4YAPK,26,4,This tablet does not have a mini USB port so you have to use the cable that it came with and if you loose that cable - tough luck.
B007P4YAPK,26,5,Plugging in a micro hdmi cord was a little difficult due to this, and I am sure the port would break off if i did it often.
B007P4YAPK,26,6,I have the USB adapter but its not great.
B007P4YAPK,26,7,Do micro-USBs not provide enough power?
B007P4YAPK,26,8,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,26,9,It's speedy and responsive and everything works.Just a couple of thoughts:1) I'm not a fan of the proprietary charging cable AND USB/Wall plug.
B007P4YAPK,26,10,A user commented about the extension USB issue and rightly informed me that it has to be USB 3.0, I was using a 2.0 cable.I use the tablet every day and it has become a necessary part of life.
B007P4YAPK,26,11,Even the center port, where the tablet actually interacts with the keyboard cracked.
B007P4YAPK,26,12,It would charge then stop charging in a contual cycle.
B007P4YAPK,26,13,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,26,14,It won't work for power or data with any cable extention.
B007P4YAPK,26,15,With the purchase of a micro HDMI to HDMI cable I was able to stream my netflix and watch on the large screen.
B007P4YAPK,26,16,Thinking that there is some defect in the tablet i was wondering what needs to be done.Then i saw this thin tape on the usb sync cable.
B007P4YAPK,26,17,My tablet would not charge from either charger, but both chargers work with her tablet.
B007P4YAPK,26,18,Not necessary if you get the keyboard, however, as the keyboard has a full sized usb port built in.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Just found out that standard USB chargers (of any amperage) do not charge this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,26,19,Then, 2-3 months later, the connector ports that hold the tablet to the optional keyboard started showing signs of stress.
B007P4YAPK,26,20,Also at the base of the charge port is the same issue with the skinny piece of thin plastic covering.
B007P4YAPK,26,21,By the way the cable connector suspiciously looking like the old iPhone and iPod connector.
B007P4YAPK,26,22,That cable that comes with it can get power from an ordinary USB port, but the amount of power would be so low it would take the whole day to recharge from a standard USB.
B007P4YAPK,26,23,I am sure I wouldn't notice it if I didn't look extremely carefully, and it wasn't much of a problem to me but the hdmi port was misaligned from its socket!
B007P4YAPK,26,24,Once the plastic adjacent the hinge broke off, the hinge was very loose and damaged the connector between the keyboard and the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,27,0,I liked it and bought another only to have it start doing the same thing on and off and no I was not Hacked.
B007P4YAPK,27,1,Okay... crash, restart working.
B007P4YAPK,27,2,The unit worked well until I bought the dock/keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,27,3,Without even installing any apps the system started constantly freezing.
B007P4YAPK,27,4,Install a few more apps (3 maybe, 4) working great.
B007P4YAPK,27,5,For those that work im sure it's a pretty nifty tablet, but im all set.
B007P4YAPK,27,6,In Apple world the app asks the operating system to use something that requires permission and the operating system asks user to grant that permission.
B007P4YAPK,27,7,(too late for the apps that are already installed on it by Asus).
B007P4YAPK,27,8,Then crash, and so I uninstall the app.
B007P4YAPK,27,9,The first thing I tried is the GPS.
B007P4YAPK,27,10,GPS locking is OK.
B007P4YAPK,27,11,There are many ugly Apps that do not work well.
B007P4YAPK,27,12,It is our choice what we install and what we do not install on our units.
B007P4YAPK,27,13,Bad QC problems.
B007P4YAPK,27,14,Then once problems started, there is no stopping it.
B007P4YAPK,27,15,I upgraded to the latest Android and reset to manufacture setting, still same problems.
B007P4YAPK,27,16,I know someone that has one, and they LOVE it!
B007P4YAPK,27,17,Honestly Android is just not there yet, but I see why people love it.So for me this didn't work out.
B007P4YAPK,27,18,Maybe I just got a bad unit.
B007P4YAPK,27,19,Then I started installing apps, which at first was a joyful experience.
B007P4YAPK,27,20,Constantly Freezes, touch screen stopped working.
B007P4YAPK,27,21,My unit always has the latest android available from ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,27,22,The slight tweaks ASUS has made to the vanilla system are fine, although it would appear users are locked into using the ASUS file manager which may be off-putting for some.
B007P4YAPK,27,23,I was more frustrated with the crashing and I am not feeling the love.
B007P4YAPK,27,24,I bought this unit for development.
B007P4YAPK,28,0,Tweaked Out with no Support.
B007P4YAPK,28,1,I contacted ASUS customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,2,They have no incentive to provide any actual customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,3,Needless to say this is getting returned immediately!
B007P4YAPK,28,4,so I called ASUS support by phone.
B007P4YAPK,28,5,It took about 3 weeks until the tablet returned and about one week later the problem returned.I sent it to ASUS repair again, and it was returned about 3 weeks later.
B007P4YAPK,28,6,have not recieved my tablet back from the Asus repair facility they have had it since 7/8/12.
B007P4YAPK,28,7,I called customer support and they were no help.
B007P4YAPK,28,8,I was assured that my tablet was still under warranty and that I could send it in for assessment and possible repair.
B007P4YAPK,28,9,Horrible customer support from ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,28,10,Poor customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,11,He said tech support was very backlogged.
B007P4YAPK,28,12,No warranty or support.
B007P4YAPK,28,13,While ASUS is willing to make the repairs, I have to pay the shipping to their repair facility.
B007P4YAPK,28,14,This is the first time I've had to return a product to Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,28,15,Asus TF201.
B007P4YAPK,28,16,Disappointing Customer Service.
B007P4YAPK,28,17,they told me I needed to send it in--at my cost--they would evaluate it and send me a quote.
B007P4YAPK,28,18,Incomplete product without a chord.
B007P4YAPK,28,19,I have called customer service twice, once last week and the second time yesterday to see if I could get any information.
B007P4YAPK,28,20,He said I could send it back for servicing.
B007P4YAPK,28,21,I had problems with the tablet freezing and I called tech support several times.
B007P4YAPK,28,22,So we came back to Amazon to get a replacement and were told that they would not replace the item.
B007P4YAPK,28,23,They don't have the replacement number for their own product?
B007P4YAPK,28,24,I then said to tell me what the replacement part number was if I wanted to repair it myself.
B007P4YAPK,29,0,I did what they said and it worked, but then only two weeks later the screen stopped responding again.
B007P4YAPK,29,1,I have tried numerous times to upload new updates hoping it would fix how crappy this tablet works.Time to take it back.
B007P4YAPK,29,2,Touchscreen stopped working...
B007P4YAPK,29,3,DOA  the screen never work.
B007P4YAPK,29,4,Touch screen didn't work!
B007P4YAPK,29,5,The machine screen shakes for over 30 seconds at times.
B007P4YAPK,29,6,Some of the problem is probably Windows stuff but the Windows machines don't even see the tablet but the tablet sees the Windows machines.
B007P4YAPK,29,7,On other apps the screen buttons work perfect.So far can't get the tablet to work on the home network.
B007P4YAPK,29,8,It disappeared after some time without using it.
B007P4YAPK,29,9,Issue with Touchscreen.
B007P4YAPK,29,10,Networks are always a pain.The hardware seems to work great but the software is weak.
B007P4YAPK,29,11,At first it would fix itself if I restarted it, but not anymore.
B007P4YAPK,29,12,The touch screen does not work correctly.
B007P4YAPK,29,13,Random reboots.
B007P4YAPK,29,14,At other times it wont let me select anything.Very upsetting.
B007P4YAPK,29,15,Random reboots happen when moved or shaken after 8 months.
B007P4YAPK,29,16,some minor issues.
B007P4YAPK,29,17,While the touch screen worked... it was as all the other touch screens out there.
B007P4YAPK,29,18,I'm really hoping its a software issue, if not I'm returning it.
B007P4YAPK,29,19,Tablet looks very good until I have a problems with touch screen.After about 4 weeks of using screen at top right part become occasionally unresponsive.
B007P4YAPK,29,20,I was using the tablet a week ago and it randomly rebooted and throws an error every time it tries to boot now.
B007P4YAPK,29,21,Another cracked screen to add to the list of others.
B007P4YAPK,29,22,All Honeycomb tablets had issues, they sooner or later had to go back due to defective manufacturing and software glitches.
B007P4YAPK,29,23,The touchscreen problems hardly ever happen now, but they do still happen.
B007P4YAPK,29,24,Sent for RMA once and it worked for about 3 weeks, then the same problem appeared a gain.
