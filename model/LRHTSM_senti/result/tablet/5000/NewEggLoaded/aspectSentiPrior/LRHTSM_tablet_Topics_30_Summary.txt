B008DWG5HE,0,6,I'm in love with it.
B008DWG5HE,0,7,For those who wants to use this device to read.
B008DWG5HE,0,8,But even though I have both Kindle Fire HDs which I also love, I missed the Samsung.
B008DWG5HE,0,9,I suggest you buy amazon kindle fire HD, although there's no S-pen.
B008DWG5HE,0,10,The SGN 10.1 is my second tablet, the first being the original Kindle Fire.
B008DWG5HE,0,11,I love my new tablet.
B008DWG5HE,0,12,Love it!!!!
B008DWG5HE,0,13,I love the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,0,14,love this.
B008DWG5HE,0,15,Late last year I got a Kindle Fire and this spring I went for a smartphone.
B008DWG5HE,0,16,Love, love, love this tablet!
B008DWG5HE,0,17,I love the size and the screen is very eazy to see and adjust.
B008DWG5HE,0,18,Love it!!
B008DWG5HE,0,19,The screen is clear with great color.
B008DWG5HE,0,20,I also have my nook and amazon kindle apps so I can read books and magazines.
B008DWG5HE,0,21,Love it love it love it.Only had it for a day but its great.i
B008DWG5HE,0,22,I really love this device (using it right now).
B008DWG5HE,0,23,I suggest not to buy this device, because the screen resolution of this device is bad.
B008DWG5HE,0,24,I have read other reviews of people complaining about the screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,1,0,You have so many App.s that can be found at the Google Play store, many are free.
B008DWG5HE,1,1,Not sure how games play out on it but videos look great.
B008DWG5HE,1,2,Other apps can give you .psd
B008DWG5HE,1,3,Therefore, this tablet will not run Flash video.
B008DWG5HE,1,4,One for their store and one for their apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,5,I use the Kindle app for reading.
B008DWG5HE,1,6,Kindle app works great and Amazon Prime movies work well in the browser.
B008DWG5HE,1,7,Also, every app I have looked at seems to be 40-50% cheaper on the Amazon app site than on Play Store.
B008DWG5HE,1,8,Can watch Amazon Prime videos (after loading flash),8.
B008DWG5HE,1,9,There's a great selection of apps optimized for tablets from Google Play, Amazon App Store, and Samsung Apps.
B008DWG5HE,1,10,There are thousands of apps on the Google Play Store to choose from.
B008DWG5HE,1,11,Work great wife love it  only thing I cant play vids from Amazon  dont know where to get the app
B008DWG5HE,1,12,Unless you love downloading lots of apps and downloading movies or something.
B008DWG5HE,1,13,Great tablet but it does not support flash!
B008DWG5HE,1,14,Lots of apps already installed.
B008DWG5HE,1,15,I also watch Netflix movies , read kindle books and Google play magazines on it.
B008DWG5HE,1,16,I down loaded the Video player MX-Video there is a free App. and I can view my HD videos on this tablet and they really look great.
B008DWG5HE,1,17,This is a problem right?.... Nope! Download the app camscanner (its free!!)
B008DWG5HE,1,18,Although 16:9 is great for video and gaming.
B008DWG5HE,1,19,Probably Google will come up with an app to do this and at the same time track what you watch.
B008DWG5HE,1,20,I had a Hava streaming box for TV - the app on iPad wasn't working, but it's Android app worked perfect...
B008DWG5HE,1,21,It's asking I download Adobe flash player.
B008DWG5HE,1,22,I would like to watch amazon prime videos like I do with my phone.
B008DWG5HE,1,23,I also find the Samsungs to be every bit as intuitive as the Ipad was.Apps: There are maybe 2 apps that the Itunes store has that I "need" in the Android app market, but all of the other apps that I already purchased for my Android phone were readily and easily available for download from the Google Apps store ("PLAY").
B008DWG5HE,1,24,There also is not a Japanese option available for download unless I go to the Play Store.
B008DWG5HE,2,0,Love, love, love this tablet!

B008DWG5HE,2,14,Great Product!

B008DWG5HE,2,24,Loved It.
B008DWG5HE,3,0,It had ample battery life sufficient for my use.
B008DWG5HE,3,1,Battery life is short.2.
B008DWG5HE,3,2,The battery life is really good too.
B008DWG5HE,3,3,Long battery life as it lastsall day.
B008DWG5HE,3,4,Long battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,5,Battery doesn't last long.
B008DWG5HE,3,6,- Battery life is good.
B008DWG5HE,3,7,Battery life is great too.
B008DWG5HE,3,8,One device for coordinating work life and private life.
B008DWG5HE,3,9,Battery life is great.
B008DWG5HE,3,10,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,3,11,Battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,12,My only issue is that it takes a long time to take a full charge and does not charge rapidly enough to use while charging, but the battery life is not bad.
B008DWG5HE,3,13,Battery life excellent.
B008DWG5HE,3,14,Battery life is about 7 hours...maybe a little more.The resolution of the screen is great.
B008DWG5HE,3,15,Battery charge.
B008DWG5HE,3,16,Longer battery life than the iPad or GTab.
B008DWG5HE,3,17,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,3,18,Fast, fun and longest battery life I have ever seen.
B008DWG5HE,3,19,Battery seems to last pretty long.
B008DWG5HE,3,20,See how long the battery lasts.
B008DWG5HE,3,21,Always seems like we are charging it.
B008DWG5HE,3,22,I think I was down to 77% or something so battery life should be fine.
B008DWG5HE,3,23,I usually have the brightness set to 10-15% or slightly less in classrooms or at home because that's all I really need but also to conserve battery life.
B008DWG5HE,3,24,Battery life is exceptional (I tend t forget to turn it off and the battery life has saved me more than once) Works well in all my business needs
B008DWG5HE,4,0,Good sound, better than any tablet I herd.
B008DWG5HE,4,1,The speakers are of great quality.
B008DWG5HE,4,2,It has great sound.
B008DWG5HE,4,3,This is as good as it gets.
B008DWG5HE,4,4,it has pretty good battery life, it also has an excellent quality sounding speakers, which i wasn't expecting on any tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,5,Feels solid to me and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,4,6,Not as good as the Ipad 3, but great.
B008DWG5HE,4,7,Sound is great.
B008DWG5HE,4,8,Here is the good and the .. well it is all pretty good.1.
B008DWG5HE,4,9,As far as quality of picture and sound, I can't really tell the difference.
B008DWG5HE,4,10,Yes it is plastic, but I like it, feels good, doesn't creak.
B008DWG5HE,4,11,Excellent product, good quality.
B008DWG5HE,4,12,i like the multi screen and  the resolution es good my be in mucho better iPad screen  but is  more productive that other tablet
B008DWG5HE,4,13,The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,4,14,The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast.
B008DWG5HE,4,15,Loud and decent quality speakers, probably the best on any tablet I've experienced6.
B008DWG5HE,4,16,Solid product with great screen.
B008DWG5HE,4,17,especially fond of the speakers.
B008DWG5HE,4,18,I never expected it to be as good as it is.
B008DWG5HE,4,19,Good solid tablet.
B008DWG5HE,4,20,solid build.
B008DWG5HE,4,21,Excellent battery, performance, stability, quality and also quantity.
B008DWG5HE,4,22,Better than my ol' iPad!
B008DWG5HE,4,23,It is different from the iPad, but that's a good thing, I think.
B008DWG5HE,4,24,Cudos Samsung on a quality product!
B008DWG5HE,5,0,Works great with good picture quality.
B008DWG5HE,5,1,The camera takes nice pictures.
B008DWG5HE,5,2,Truly love the front and back camera.
B008DWG5HE,5,3,I wanted front and back cameras.
B008DWG5HE,5,4,apps are easy to use and the camera front and rear are as good as other in it category.
B008DWG5HE,5,5,It has picture in picture video.
B008DWG5HE,5,6,picture great sound!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,5,7,Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great.
B008DWG5HE,5,8,And the picture quality is amazing.
B008DWG5HE,5,9,clear screen .
B008DWG5HE,5,10,I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet.
B008DWG5HE,5,11,Cameras are not the best you will see out there but both work nice.
B008DWG5HE,5,12,Pictures and videos are stunning.
B008DWG5HE,5,13,- Camera is awesome under normal light.
B008DWG5HE,5,14,nice front speakers.
B008DWG5HE,5,15,It seems required for any portable device to have a camera nowadays, and both front and back are there, but the photos aren't great.
B008DWG5HE,5,16,It is easy to use, and the screen/display is great!
B008DWG5HE,5,17,I then realized this happens mostly for apps that use the front facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,5,18,The front and rear camera works very well and the Photoshop Touch app is an excellent complement.
B008DWG5HE,5,19,I could go on and on about it but you get the picture.
B008DWG5HE,5,20,Because of the many features it has also almost replaced my digital camera.
B008DWG5HE,5,21,this is a great device.
B008DWG5HE,5,22,But from the demos I have watched I think it will be fun!A few things to consider though before purchasing...first, the camera doesn't take the greatest pictures.
B008DWG5HE,5,23,The speakers are of great quality.
B008DWG5HE,5,24,Nice priceMore to come over the weekend once we get into it more
B008DWG5HE,6,0,Fast and responsive.
B008DWG5HE,6,1,fast processor, clear and bright screen.
B008DWG5HE,6,2,Easy to use and good speed and screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,6,3,This tablet has a fast processor.
B008DWG5HE,6,4,It did not disappoint.Firstly, this tablet is fast, really fast.

B008DWG5HE,6,8,The response of both the S-Pen and touch screen are great.

B008DWG5HE,6,18,It is very fast and smooth.
B008DWG5HE,6,19,It's very responsive and sublime to touch.
B008DWG5HE,6,20,The screen is clear with great color.
B008DWG5HE,6,21,Perfect power, great value for a quad core.
B008DWG5HE,6,22,It's fast vs orginal 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,6,23,Speed is great and the screen is great, I take more productivity tools over high resolution screen tablet anyday.
B008DWG5HE,6,24,The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great.
B008DWG5HE,7,0,Make sure to get a 32gig micro SD card, to expand the memory.
B008DWG5HE,7,1,I wanted a SD card slot for additional storage.
B008DWG5HE,7,2,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,3,Features I like -1) you can expand additional memory up to 64 gb (16+64) with micro sd card.2) S - PEN feature for your creativity.3)
B008DWG5HE,7,4,The storage capacity is excellent, 16GB, plus an extra 16GB SD card for the full 32GB of storage.
B008DWG5HE,7,5,I don't recommend buying the 32gb version because this has a Micro SD slot for extra storage space up to 64gb.
B008DWG5HE,7,6,Another great feature is that even though this device comes with 32 GB internal memory, I can insert a 64 GB card.
B008DWG5HE,7,7,not really 32 GB.
B008DWG5HE,7,8,updates not in the cards.
B008DWG5HE,7,9,With the exantion slot my note went from 32gb to 96gb.
B008DWG5HE,7,10,Love the SD card slot option and again... it's great having a dedicated stylus.
B008DWG5HE,7,11,You have the freedom to play with your storage the way you want by buying as many mini cards as you want.
B008DWG5HE,7,12,This is a great tablet and for only $11.00 I added 16 more GB via mini SD.
B008DWG5HE,7,13,Expandable Storage.*
B008DWG5HE,7,14,Thanks Samsung, you guys made a great tablet with a great idea!I bought 32 gb one, and I am about to use it with my 32 gb SD memory card too.
B008DWG5HE,7,15,Ended up buying a 32GB mini SD card for the tablet which does give me 64 GB which helps.
B008DWG5HE,7,16,At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,7,17,I highly recommend that you buy the Sandisk 32gb Micro Ultra memory card.
B008DWG5HE,7,18,I bought the 16-gs, because it was cheap, now 32 gs is cheaper, if you want it buy this tablet,  buy the  32gs,,,, because the aps can not be moved to sd memory ,, I have the 16gs, and I have little memory and it sucks,but the tablet works good
B008DWG5HE,7,19,The amount of storage to me is great.
B008DWG5HE,7,20,While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-
B008DWG5HE,7,21,Micro SD support7.
B008DWG5HE,7,22,I am running a 64GB card and it works great.
B008DWG5HE,7,23,It will handle up to a Micro 64GB SDXC storage card which writes up to 30mbps, really adding lots of extra storage since most tablets only support 32GB.
B008DWG5HE,7,24,Took a long time researching tablet options...I was looking for more than 16gb and ability to use expanded memory via sd cards.
B008DWG5HE,8,0,is really good the read books.
B008DWG5HE,8,1,really great for reading my books and comics.
B008DWG5HE,8,2,Good Device.
B008DWG5HE,8,3,Not as good as the Ipad 3, but great.
B008DWG5HE,8,4,This device has replaced my laptop as my main computing device.
B008DWG5HE,8,5,The Note works great for all the other things (like music,web, video and books).
B008DWG5HE,8,6,I think it is great.
B008DWG5HE,8,7,great.
B008DWG5HE,8,8,Enjoy watching shows, internet and games.
B008DWG5HE,8,9,This is a great device and very useful for teaching and other such tasks.
B008DWG5HE,8,10,I can play a youtube or any other type of video and have float around the screen while I surf the web or check e-mail.
B008DWG5HE,8,11,A new way of doing computing.
B008DWG5HE,8,12,Great in some ways.
B008DWG5HE,8,13,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,8,14,This alone makes this device.Performance....
B008DWG5HE,8,15,Its great being able to see what's on my other devices and use them as I need from one tablet.
B008DWG5HE,8,16,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,8,17,Many things can be done on it and is like a laptop.
B008DWG5HE,8,18,good for  watching movies and listening to music.i'm
B008DWG5HE,8,19,This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.I love how customize-able the screens are.
B008DWG5HE,8,20,I read ebook, surf web, and watch videos.
B008DWG5HE,8,21,It does everything you need a tablet to do from watching videos, downloading all kinds of apps, listening to music, surfing the web, reading books, and most of all TAKING NOTES.My laptop has been gathering dust for a long time now since I got the Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,8,22,I use my computers mostly for email and web searching and shopping.
B008DWG5HE,8,23,I use it as a book reader, to watch videos while I workout at the gym, to check email and facebook, to check the weather.
B008DWG5HE,8,24,Great Tablet!
B008DWG5HE,9,0,I am now looking at getting a keyboard for it because using the on screen keyboard is really inefficient for tyling more than about one sentence.
B008DWG5HE,9,1,And well, after trying several apps, I must say that best for writing are: Quill, Write and Papyrus.
B008DWG5HE,9,2,You resume writing, "accuracy".
B008DWG5HE,9,3,I use it more for reading, but I love the pen and being able to write instead of type.
B008DWG5HE,9,4,The handwriting app is good.
B008DWG5HE,9,5,You can write as though you were using a pen and paper.
B008DWG5HE,9,6,You can write and draw on this tablet asefficiently as you do on paper.
B008DWG5HE,9,7,Love all the apps it's got.
B008DWG5HE,9,8,I don't like software keyboards so I love being able to write everything out.
B008DWG5HE,9,9,If you want to get this tablet for anything except the pen, don't do it and go for other tablets with better resolution/price/etc.
B008DWG5HE,9,10,The S Pen is so accurate that you can hand write whole sheets of handwritten text with it.
B008DWG5HE,9,11,The S-Pen feels like a real pen when you are writing not like those gummy bear stylus tips that the other tablets use to write with.
B008DWG5HE,9,12,I'm a writer and it's so much easier writing than typing!
B008DWG5HE,9,13,If You Want to Write with a Stylus This is the Tablet to Buy.
B008DWG5HE,9,14,If you hand write a few words and then pause, the handwriting is converted to text.
B008DWG5HE,9,15,I've seen other top-of-the-line tablets used with an after-market stylus where you write really big in 1/2 the screen and what you write is digitized down (sometimes unreadable) into your "notes" in the other half of the screen.Not so with the Samsung Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,9,16,The S note app allows you to take notes or even write math equations.
B008DWG5HE,9,17,You can use the pen to draw or write with it.
B008DWG5HE,9,18,S Note and PS Touch are geared to work well with the new Samsung Galaxy S Pen.
B008DWG5HE,9,19,love it!!! GREAT, so much better than an IPad.
B008DWG5HE,9,20,I screengrab my calculator app to capture graphs and get those into my notes.
B008DWG5HE,9,21,You can write math equations into the note app and it'll solve them, same with chemistry symbols, and the pen feature works really well.
B008DWG5HE,9,22,I also didn't like how on ipad you can only line up the Apps in little rows.
B008DWG5HE,9,23,The keyboard does not work well.
B008DWG5HE,9,24,Some drawing apps to recommend is Layerpaint and tvpaint.
B008DWG5HE,10,0,Good size screen!
B008DWG5HE,10,1,Very nice tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,2,Very nice Tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,3,This tablet is a great size.
B008DWG5HE,10,4,I love this tablet because it has a nice large screen, but is still not hard to carry.
B008DWG5HE,10,5,I think it's easy to use and has everything you need for anything you want.
B008DWG5HE,10,6,love, love, love this!
B008DWG5HE,10,7,Its pretty fast and the size is just right.
B008DWG5HE,10,8,Love this tablet!
B008DWG5HE,10,9,Really love this.
B008DWG5HE,10,10,Great Tablet!
B008DWG5HE,10,11,You will love it!
B008DWG5HE,10,12,LOVE IT.
B008DWG5HE,10,13,Nice product.
B008DWG5HE,10,14,Love this tablet!
B008DWG5HE,10,15,I love this product...
B008DWG5HE,10,16,This is Great.
B008DWG5HE,10,17,We Love it.
B008DWG5HE,10,18,Good Device.
B008DWG5HE,10,19,It is very nice to take notes with but I am still learning to use it.
B008DWG5HE,10,20,Nice priceMore to come over the weekend once we get into it more
B008DWG5HE,10,21,Fast shipping and Good product.
B008DWG5HE,10,22,I love my tablet.
B008DWG5HE,10,23,This tablet works very well and has many nice features.
B008DWG5HE,10,24,Very functional and fast.
B008DWG5HE,11,0,Also, the Note 10.1 has no built in full size or mini USB or HDMI ports.
B008DWG5HE,11,1,The only thing that I don't like about it is that there is no usb port.
B008DWG5HE,11,2,You can plug your external USB Hard Drive in and watch Movies etc.Also has some great App's.
B008DWG5HE,11,3,I purchased a portable folding Bluetooth keyboard that works great and I added a Bluetooth mouse.
B008DWG5HE,11,4,Would of preferred a full size hdmi over the micro.
B008DWG5HE,11,5,It will handle HDMI to a big screen and USB keyboards, mice, game controllers, external hard drives, I have have tried a 500GB external hard drive, and it should do even larger, just pickup the adapters.
B008DWG5HE,11,6,I knew I wanted an Android device and one that had an SD card slot as well as a micro USB slot.
B008DWG5HE,11,7,This kit provides access to many USB devices (including printers, USB sticks, keyboards, mouses and SD cards).
B008DWG5HE,11,8,You can transfer files but the power output from standard USB ports is not strong enough to power the Note.
B008DWG5HE,11,9,I bought an SD Card reader for $8 and hdmi adapter for $34 - hooked up a bluetooth mouse and keyboard and I can use my TV like a smart TV now.
B008DWG5HE,11,10,Apparently the output from a PC USB port isn't enough to charge the Note (which I can understand).
B008DWG5HE,11,11,A great Tablet.
B008DWG5HE,11,12,You need multiple expensive accessories just to hook up USB host, SD cards, and HDMI.
B008DWG5HE,11,13,I am now looking at getting a keyboard for it because using the on screen keyboard is really inefficient for tyling more than about one sentence.
B008DWG5HE,11,14,It takes less than a minute to recognize the USB Drive, the same time it takes for a laptop to recognize a new USB Drive.
B008DWG5HE,11,15,When I plug in a USB external hard drive to the tablet, the tablet tells me that the USB device requires too much power to operate (stick with the thumb drives, or AC adapter powered external HDDs).
B008DWG5HE,11,16,I didn't want Ipad like the majority but I haven't found anything lacking, I also bought the kingston bluetooth keyboard case as well and these two things work very well together.
B008DWG5HE,11,17,So I just have to make sure not to charge the device while I am using a few camera specific apps.
B008DWG5HE,11,18,You could probably use it for a full day without having to charge.I do not have a keyboard.
B008DWG5HE,11,19,I also like that I can connect it to my computer's USB port and use it as an external hard drive.
B008DWG5HE,11,20,Mainly, when I try and charge the Note while using it, the charging cable fits into the bottom of the device.
B008DWG5HE,11,21,Evernote works nicely on the big screen.9.
B008DWG5HE,11,22,HDMI out works nice.
B008DWG5HE,11,23,Battery life is great too.
B008DWG5HE,11,24,I love the cardboard thin Bluetooth keyboard that connects magnetically.
B008DWG5HE,12,0,Wish I would have gone with the I-Pad.
B008DWG5HE,12,1,It just seems so much "freer" than the ipad.
B008DWG5HE,12,2,Bye bye Apple Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,12,3,So far I think it has everything the ipad had and then some!!
B008DWG5HE,12,4,Better than the Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,12,5,Hasta la vista ipad....
B008DWG5HE,12,6,No Flashplayer operation.....I wanted this instead of the Apple iPad...now its just like the iPad.
B008DWG5HE,12,7,I have an iPad 2 as well.
B008DWG5HE,12,8,Love this tablet way better than an ipad!
B008DWG5HE,12,9,No iPad bashing from me.
B008DWG5HE,12,10,Looking for something better than an iPad?
B008DWG5HE,12,11,First Android tablet and I love it!!
B008DWG5HE,12,12,Love my Android!
B008DWG5HE,12,13,I have an iPad and mini IPad and not sure if galaxy is as friendly use as apple products.
B008DWG5HE,12,14,Better than the Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,12,15,I debated for a while between the ipad and the samsung galaxy note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,12,16,I did not want to get an Ipad because I am not used to using Apple products.
B008DWG5HE,12,17,You can do much more things than with an ipad.
B008DWG5HE,12,18,Better than my ol' iPad!
B008DWG5HE,12,19,And then I gave my iPad to my cousin..
B008DWG5HE,12,20,iPad bites the dust.
B008DWG5HE,12,21,iPad is a much better device.
B008DWG5HE,12,22,So much better than Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,12,23,So much better then an iPad!
B008DWG5HE,12,24,iPad 2 screen looks the same to me as Note 10.1.Galaxy
B008DWG5HE,13,0,Great Product.
B008DWG5HE,13,1,I returned this item.
B008DWG5HE,13,2,Samsung was on the path to great product until they started to make it exclusive to thier products!!
B008DWG5HE,13,3,First of all, this item has shipped 3 days after I actually placed order.Second, the item was defective!!!!!!!
B008DWG5HE,13,4,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,13,5,Product is fine and I love Samsung products but seller gets 3 stars for product seal broken.
B008DWG5HE,13,6,I purchased this tablet to replace a IPAD.
B008DWG5HE,13,7,I've had experiences with Ipads and other tablets in the past but never purchased one because they have little to no value for productivity.
B008DWG5HE,13,8,Tablet came on time but in a rather large box.
B008DWG5HE,13,9,Received on time no issues at all.. . . . . . . . . . . . . .
B008DWG5HE,13,10,Excellent product, good quality.
B008DWG5HE,13,11,NOT HAPPY!!!! Got a defective product!
B008DWG5HE,13,12,The seller was willing to help me with anything I needed help with as well.
B008DWG5HE,13,13,It was priced right on Amazon and I love free shipping it was here in 2 days.
B008DWG5HE,13,14,This was my first time shopping with amazon and im really impressed, timely delivery and good customer service.
B008DWG5HE,13,15,Product is as described by seller.
B008DWG5HE,13,16,Excellent product, would recommend it to everyone, especially businessmen/women.
B008DWG5HE,13,17,Also the quick quality service you get from Amazon is a plus.
B008DWG5HE,13,18,All the other features are great but what good are they if you can't print your reciept after purchasing your item  from Amazon?
B008DWG5HE,13,19,excelent product.
B008DWG5HE,13,20,wonderful product.
B008DWG5HE,13,21,Overall, Apple fanboys can keep their iPads... I'm MORE than happy with my Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,13,22,Shipped on time and tablet was intact, exceptions were fine.
B008DWG5HE,13,23,Productivity at home.
B008DWG5HE,13,24,Productivity at work.
B008DWG5HE,14,0,Great tablet!
B008DWG5HE,14,1,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,2,Great.
B008DWG5HE,14,3,this is a great device.
B008DWG5HE,14,4,Great Hardware.
B008DWG5HE,14,5,The best device I've ever seen.
B008DWG5HE,14,6,Best tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,7,best tab.
B008DWG5HE,14,8,I have owned 8 Android Tablets and one Windows tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,9,I have owned 2 other android tablets before this and this 1 is by far the best.
B008DWG5HE,14,10,Best Android tablet I have owned.
B008DWG5HE,14,11,Great Product!
B008DWG5HE,14,12,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,14,13,Good Device.
B008DWG5HE,14,14,This device is just what I needed.
B008DWG5HE,14,15,It's great.
B008DWG5HE,14,16,I love this thing...
B008DWG5HE,14,17,It even has Microsoft Office for Android on it!
B008DWG5HE,14,18,Better then a laptop!
B008DWG5HE,14,19,The best tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,20,Best Tab I have used.
B008DWG5HE,14,21,Great tablet.
B008DWG5HE,14,22,Since that has a windows 8 operating system and its not Android.
B008DWG5HE,14,23,It's fast as lightingThe s pen is great.
B008DWG5HE,14,24,So much better then an iPad!
B008DWG5HE,15,0,Well, I've got to say, that on a 10" screen, I'm not sure how OBVIOUS a difference there is between the two.
B008DWG5HE,15,1,The screen resolution has not been a problem.
B008DWG5HE,15,2,How important are they to you?3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting.
B008DWG5HE,15,3,screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,4,The only thing that i would have wished more is a higher screen resolution.
B008DWG5HE,15,5,The screen is fine.2.5.
B008DWG5HE,15,6,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,15,7,iPad 2 screen looks the same to me as Note 10.1.Galaxy
B008DWG5HE,15,8,Dimming the display in settings didn't work...this app keeps the screen bright & I've not found a way to dim it.I
B008DWG5HE,15,9,One complaint is that the screen is VERY bright and I've not found a way to dim it.
B008DWG5HE,15,10,The screen resolution and brightness seems fine but an HD screen would be very, very nice.General comments on the slate itself.
B008DWG5HE,15,11,The screen was also great looking I didn't even notice that it wasn't 1080p or a retina display.
B008DWG5HE,15,12,It is punchy with good blacks and looks plenty sharp at the normal viewing distance of a 10" screen.
B008DWG5HE,15,13,Yes, the iPad has a screen that is a bit more vibrant, but unless they are sitting side by side you will NOT notice the difference.
B008DWG5HE,15,14,Unfortunately, the screen has amazingly terrible backlight bleeding.This seems to stem from a multicolored spot on the screen that is visible at an angle.
B008DWG5HE,15,15,With the screen facing away from the sun, however, reflections of myself and the scenery behind me dominate the screen and make it difficult to read the text.
B008DWG5HE,15,16,I actually found out that it will not only run split screens plus 5 apps like I mentioned but up to 11.The screen resolution is NOT an issue at all.
B008DWG5HE,15,17,We`ve gone from black and white to 12" color TVs all the way to easily available 60" LED TVs....why would I want to revert to a 10" screen to watch movies etc....that`s what my 42" is for.
B008DWG5HE,15,18,Feel it skim across the screen.
B008DWG5HE,15,19,thing to note about the screen.
B008DWG5HE,15,20,For the naysayers who complain about the screen resolution and compare it to the Retina display on the iPad, my first comment is guess what?
B008DWG5HE,15,21,I think the resolution is just fine.
B008DWG5HE,15,22,Thus, unless you are looking directly at a right angle to where the pen is touching the glass, the image on the screen does not appear where you expect it to appear.
B008DWG5HE,15,23,I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.Bad things (I think)-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful.
B008DWG5HE,15,24,Display is crystal clear.
B008DWG5HE,16,0,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,16,1,The problem with all tablets is app support.
B008DWG5HE,16,2,It does NOT have flash player nor can you download it from the app store.
B008DWG5HE,16,3,It supports all android applications.
B008DWG5HE,16,4,I also find the Samsungs to be every bit as intuitive as the Ipad was.Apps: There are maybe 2 apps that the Itunes store has that I "need" in the Android app market, but all of the other apps that I already purchased for my Android phone were readily and easily available for download from the Google Apps store ("PLAY").
B008DWG5HE,16,5,One for their store and one for their apps.
B008DWG5HE,16,6,You'll also get some tips on the various app's that support it.
B008DWG5HE,16,7,Going to the app store and loading new apps is totally painless since I never have to login to the store.
B008DWG5HE,16,8,I think this will be a useful app as well.
B008DWG5HE,16,9,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,16,10,There's a great selection of apps optimized for tablets from Google Play, Amazon App Store, and Samsung Apps.
B008DWG5HE,16,11,Did not work from google store.
B008DWG5HE,16,12,Skype app for Android works really well!5)
B008DWG5HE,16,13,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,16,14,has their own app market and they pre-install some apps on your tablet.
B008DWG5HE,16,15,The Android system permits it.
B008DWG5HE,16,16,Their store is useful but that is all I use.
B008DWG5HE,16,17,All the time is spent making good apps for the ibad.
B008DWG5HE,16,18,One app in particular- ironically- the AMAZON mobile app- was not available for use on the Samsung Tablets.
B008DWG5HE,16,19,You will need how to install apps and visit the app store.
B008DWG5HE,16,20,You can download from Android Market (Play Store) and the Samsung Store, which is really neat.
B008DWG5HE,16,21,opening apps & navagating around the O/S- able to play the HD .mkv
B008DWG5HE,16,22,But, the upside is that there is an app and a fix for everything.
B008DWG5HE,16,23,I have more shortcuts to apps than I know what to do with.
B008DWG5HE,16,24,I had about 100 apps installed and 2 widgets on the home screen.
B008DWG5HE,17,0,if you purchase their products you are on your own after they get your money.
B008DWG5HE,17,1,Why would anyone buy an iPad?
B008DWG5HE,17,2,Bought this over iPad and well worth the money.
B008DWG5HE,17,3,I've refrained from buying a tablet for several years now.
B008DWG5HE,17,4,I've had it now for about 3 months and it just gets better and better.
B008DWG5HE,17,5,But I was feeling good with my money so I decided to buy.
B008DWG5HE,17,6,I was iffy on buying this tablet since reviewers were kind of giving it a hard time.
B008DWG5HE,17,7,iPad isn't.
B008DWG5HE,17,8,This tablet makes the iPad obsolete.
B008DWG5HE,17,9,would not have bought knowing this.
B008DWG5HE,17,10,I didn't buy this from Amazon, but feel I should make a coment.
B008DWG5HE,17,11,BUT... the price was not cheap either.
B008DWG5HE,17,12,love it!!! GREAT, so much better than an IPad.
B008DWG5HE,17,13,To me Apple is a niche product.
B008DWG5HE,17,14,My company spends 1000s of dollar in amazon purchasing.
B008DWG5HE,17,15,I expected this product to last for at least a couple of years.
B008DWG5HE,17,16,I returned it in 1 month, it had similar problems.
B008DWG5HE,17,17,Made my purchase in February and have had nothing but problems.
B008DWG5HE,17,18,This device isnt worth the price they are asking for it and you are a fool if you buy it a that price.First, there is nothing special about the device.
B008DWG5HE,17,19,Seven months later, after many problems,  Asus refunded my money.
B008DWG5HE,17,20,I didn't buy mine from Amazon as I couldn't find it on Amazon.
B008DWG5HE,17,21,Love this product.
B008DWG5HE,17,22,An expensive toy with little productivity.
B008DWG5HE,17,23,As you have probably read from other reviews, this feels like a cheap McDonalds toy.
B008DWG5HE,17,24,If i have to buy an tablet again, i will definitely consider some other brands as well.
B008DWG5HE,18,0,As far as charging times go, it will charge about 15%+ per hour when not being used, 12% if used while charging.
B008DWG5HE,18,1,But, Alas! after plugging the charger in for a couple of hours and seeing a battery charge symbol on the screen I elected to turn in on and________---------________ Nothing!
B008DWG5HE,18,2,charging cord.
B008DWG5HE,18,3,I was able assemble the adopter /battery charger.
B008DWG5HE,18,4,I'm having battery charging issues though!
B008DWG5HE,18,5,I let the battery die out, plugged in the charger, allowed it to fully charge before I turned it on again and then it unfroze.
B008DWG5HE,18,6,Battery charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,7,If you don't use it very much I have gone 5 days on one charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,8,Had one before and the battery died.
B008DWG5HE,18,9,The first one wouldn't even turn on!
B008DWG5HE,18,10,Used new cable and old charger and it charged, used old cable and new charger and NO CHARGE.
B008DWG5HE,18,11,My only issue is that it takes a long time to take a full charge and does not charge rapidly enough to use while charging, but the battery life is not bad.
B008DWG5HE,18,12,Battery live lasts for almost two days without a charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,13,Unit takes a long time to charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,14,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,18,15,The first day it died, the next day after updates on the second  day wifi issues.
B008DWG5HE,18,16,As of now I must Hard shut down to get to full charge and sometimes that doesn't even do it.
B008DWG5HE,18,17,I can't get enough play time with it!!
B008DWG5HE,18,18,I STILL haven't got the opportunity to use it off a full 100% charge.
B008DWG5HE,18,19,It doesn't stop even long enough for me to hold down the power key and turn the device off completely.I have researched everything, and can not find anything on why it is doing this, or how to fix it!
B008DWG5HE,18,20,I held-in the start button for 10, 20, 30 seconds up to a couple of minutes and one time the screen came alive with some inverted yellow triangle flashing.
B008DWG5HE,18,21,I came home and ordered it that day!
B008DWG5HE,18,22,So I turned about 15º and asked to look at the Note tablet.
B008DWG5HE,18,23,Even with continuous use, I only have to plug my tablet in to charge overnight.
B008DWG5HE,18,24,Last week it went into a reboot mode and I could not get it to turn off.
B008DWG5HE,19,0,And the sound quality and volume were excellent.
B008DWG5HE,19,1,Videos are full screen with front-facing stereo speakers.
B008DWG5HE,19,2,I am not expert on sound system, so all I cared was whether I can hear sound loud enough.
B008DWG5HE,19,3,3.5mm headphone jack is on the top of the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,19,4,speakers can get loud which isn't bad but when you turn the tablet from widescreen to tall screen (as I call it) I just think the tablet looks a bit weird especially since the speakers will be top and bottom and slightly to the right or left.
B008DWG5HE,19,5,The device is very well made, and the plastic is not low quality, but it doesn't have the feel and heft of an aluminium device that I prefer.
B008DWG5HE,19,6,Speakers stereo separation is very good but the lower frequency sound is poor.6.
B008DWG5HE,19,7,The build quality is fine.
B008DWG5HE,19,8,I find myself having to use headphones when watching videos.
B008DWG5HE,19,9,I really loved the sound on it with its stereo front facing speakers.
B008DWG5HE,19,10,Beyond the speakers, the tablet is light and plastic.
B008DWG5HE,19,11,The plastic screeches and groans.One of previous actual "exceptional" devices  I owned was the touch pad, which had a plastic back.
B008DWG5HE,19,12,No it doesn't feel "cheap" at all.
B008DWG5HE,19,13,The speakers are loud and front facing, woo-hoo!
B008DWG5HE,19,14,The side front facing speakers get loud.
B008DWG5HE,19,15,The sound is loud enough and I don't hear any popping or weird echoey noises.
B008DWG5HE,19,16,However, I keep mine in the Samsung case (sold separately), so the build deficits aren't noticeable.Speakers:Placing stereo speakers at opposite edges of the screen facing forward is a great idea, except the speakers aren't loud enough and have a tinny sound.
B008DWG5HE,19,17,I can get click sound by pressing corner, sticking button (first one was volume, second one was power).
B008DWG5HE,19,18,it has pretty good battery life, it also has an excellent quality sounding speakers, which i wasn't expecting on any tablet.
B008DWG5HE,19,19,I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.Bad things (I think)-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful.
B008DWG5HE,19,20,Aesthetically there is a bit of plastic on the sides were the speakers are, I don't much like the look of it, if it were a bit smaller I'd enjoy the look of it more, but honestly when I'm using it I don't notice it.
B008DWG5HE,19,21,The audio became occasionally inoperative and the headphone jack would crackle when using my ear buds.
B008DWG5HE,19,22,Our 4-year-old watches videos on this and, with the case we have, it's not possible to stand the tablet up for watching while it's plugged in.
B008DWG5HE,19,23,The screen is fine.2.5.
B008DWG5HE,19,24,Side by side and careful scrutiny is the only way you would  know.
B008DWG5HE,20,0,Great camera for video and still shooting.
B008DWG5HE,20,1,It has a decent front camera for video chat, and the a decent rear camera with a flash, tablets are not cameras but this one is above average.10)
B008DWG5HE,20,2,Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great.
B008DWG5HE,20,3,Video isn't that great either, but this is a tablet we're talking about here, not a Canon/Nikon/Sony dSLR or video camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,4,According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,5,I then realized this happens mostly for apps that use the front facing camera.
B008DWG5HE,20,6,The picture and video quality are even better than expected.
B008DWG5HE,20,7,I would have rated this 5 stars if it wasn't slow.
B008DWG5HE,20,8,The video quality, at least through Skype, is much better  than the iPad 3 for some reason.
B008DWG5HE,20,9,It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something.
B008DWG5HE,20,10,The rear-facing camera takes really decent images!6)
B008DWG5HE,20,11,But if you are working with it alone you will see that it is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.The camera is by far one of the weakest things in the tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,12,The lack of that last star is for slight difference in screen quality.
B008DWG5HE,20,13,The only thing this is good for is circling dates.
B008DWG5HE,20,14,It has picture in picture video.
B008DWG5HE,20,15,The first thing that stuck out to me were the speakers being in the front, rather than the rear.
B008DWG5HE,20,16,I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet.
B008DWG5HE,20,17,It has front facing speakers like all tablets should have.16)
B008DWG5HE,20,18,Both the front 1.9MP camera and 5MP camera fully live up to their specs.
B008DWG5HE,20,19,With Smart Stay, the front facing camera will look at you.
B008DWG5HE,20,20,Many good points and one problem.
B008DWG5HE,20,21,Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.IF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet.
B008DWG5HE,20,22,* Cameras - Amazon removed the images I posted for some reason so just take my word that the cameras work well.
B008DWG5HE,20,23,only did 4 stars for two reasons....disappointed that the camera is only 5 mega pixels and now & then when I'm using this I wish it could do something (can't remember what at the moment) that it doesn't do.Over all I'm really happy with this device.
B008DWG5HE,20,24,The SPen does a whole lot of other things that you'd have to explore yourself to appreciate it.4.Decent front and back facing cameras.Just discovered the camera has zero shutter lag.5.
B008DWG5HE,21,0,I did a hard set twice and it came back as fast as new but it would slow again as I added Apps back in.
B008DWG5HE,21,1,Well done Samsung!The Note is quite responsive, having a quad-core processor and 2Gb RAM.
B008DWG5HE,21,2,I found another app that works better for me.
B008DWG5HE,21,3,For a while it would freeze up a lot while using the note app.
B008DWG5HE,21,4,The Note 10.1 has a much faster processor and more ram (2GB) than both the Ipad 4 and infinity.
B008DWG5HE,21,5,These key differentiators plus the power of a 1.4 Ghz Quad Core and 2 GB of RAM deciding to buy this tablet is a no brainer!
B008DWG5HE,21,6,The OS was fast at first but as I added Apps it got slower and choppy.
B008DWG5HE,21,7,I can't get enough play time with it!!
B008DWG5HE,21,8,The old tablet had its issues with freezing up after the last update along with not enough ram.
B008DWG5HE,21,9,That is, you can have multiple apps running at the same time on screen but at this point, the number apps that are compatible is VERY limited.Second, the advert reads "Exceptional Performance with Quad Core Processor".
B008DWG5HE,21,10,What really sold me on the Note was the hardware: 1.4 GHz QUAD-core processor and 2GB of RAM.
B008DWG5HE,21,11,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,21,12,you could do it, but for having a quad-core processor, the keyboard doesn't respond very quickly and i have had lots of accuracy issues with it.
B008DWG5HE,21,13,The multitasking is little more than samsung showing you 2 apps at once; you still can only really do one useful thing at once.
B008DWG5HE,21,14,I was set to keep the tablet but it started to have performance issues.
B008DWG5HE,21,15,I need to do more than a few things at once and I need all of my features at the same time.
B008DWG5HE,21,16,I found the s3 to be slow considering it has 2gb of ram.
B008DWG5HE,21,17,When it is at maximum speed, infinity and galaxy browser loaded pages in equal speed.
B008DWG5HE,21,18,Even better than expected...
B008DWG5HE,21,19,The extra RAM is also necessary as the Note can perform some "multitasking" by way of a number of apps that have been designed to run alongside each other.
B008DWG5HE,21,20,The note 2 10.1 has twice the ram as the tab model.
B008DWG5HE,21,21,I also tried using other launchers asi know touch wiz tends to slow down the device down like it has on my s3.
B008DWG5HE,21,22,But once experiencing the stability & speed of Galaxy Note 10.1, I don't think I can go back to infinity or any other android tablet that gives us freeze or crush every hour.=============
B008DWG5HE,21,23,The UI seems okay and pretty responsive so no complaints there.
B008DWG5HE,21,24,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,22,0,SD card slot usles.
B008DWG5HE,22,1,This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,2,I bought this 16G tablet and installed a 16G SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,3,The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.
B008DWG5HE,22,4,I purchased a 32GB micro SD card to increase storage space for my videos.
B008DWG5HE,22,5,I bought this partly because of the sd card slot.According to Samsung you can't run apps from it and they can't store their data there.
B008DWG5HE,22,6,While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-
B008DWG5HE,22,7,Also, with their mini-sd drive (I bought the SD 64 gb card) you can put music on there if you didn't want to use Kies.
B008DWG5HE,22,8,SD card not properly used.
B008DWG5HE,22,9,With the app you can see your files and download them into the tablet from the card or drive.
B008DWG5HE,22,10,There is an expansion slot (up to 32GB only) and I popped in the Sandisk 32GB card.
B008DWG5HE,22,11,It accessed the SD card witout any issues.
B008DWG5HE,22,12,you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory?
B008DWG5HE,22,13,Make sure to get a 32gig micro SD card, to expand the memory.
B008DWG5HE,22,14,I can increase my storage with Micro SD cards or use them to access media I don't want to load onto the Note.
B008DWG5HE,22,15,You cannot use Apps2SD, for example, to move apps from the Note's built-in memory to an external SD card without *rooting the device.
B008DWG5HE,22,16,I bought one and discover it wired without data SIM , I never saw even a note about that no sim card this really wired
B008DWG5HE,22,17,When I downloaded a 3.5gb game, it asked me if I wanted to save to external SD instead of on-board memory (YES!).
B008DWG5HE,22,18,The ONLY use they giveis for backing up data.
B008DWG5HE,22,19,So if you want the note go for 32GB or you'll be sorry.
B008DWG5HE,22,20,It comes with 16 Gb of native storage, but Can be expanded by 64GB with a micro Sd card.One thing that I love about Android devices is you're not stuck with one music or movie player.
B008DWG5HE,22,21,But if you are just getting your Note, i would suggest waiting until you get the update before using the card so you can just use the exFAT format.My particular card is a Sandisk "MobileUltra" SDXC card with a Class10 rating.
B008DWG5HE,22,22,I also love having the micro SD card option as then I don't worry about space.
B008DWG5HE,22,23,If there are some files on my computer I need on my tablet I get my mini sd card to transfer the files and upload them on my tablet.
B008DWG5HE,22,24,Warning... Samsung tablets and phones do not allow you to store apps in the SD memory.
B008DWG5HE,23,0,I really liked note 10.1 until I connected to wifi.
B008DWG5HE,23,1,I don't really need wifi that much and use the note to take notes, and would rather not have to back everything up again, so I'm going without the wifi.
B008DWG5HE,23,2,WIFI ONLY.
B008DWG5HE,23,3,slow wifi on the note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,23,4,I also connect to multiple WiFi networks at work and other locations and never have an issue trying to connect.-
B008DWG5HE,23,5,Pleade do a google search for slow wifi on the note 10.1.Tim
B008DWG5HE,23,6,Has some issues.
B008DWG5HE,23,7,Connect to the wireless router.
B008DWG5HE,23,8,This tablet wastes no time in connecting to any available wireless network and does whatever is asked of it.
B008DWG5HE,23,9,It says in the settings that it's connected to the school network, but when I try to access the internet, it doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,23,10,I'm sure time will cure that issue.
B008DWG5HE,23,11,You also can not connect your printer either via WIFI or direct.
B008DWG5HE,23,12,It connects quickly and hasn't had any issues.
B008DWG5HE,23,13,Lots and lots of problems !!!!
B008DWG5HE,23,14,The device must be reset.
B008DWG5HE,23,15,Same problem still.
B008DWG5HE,23,16,They are all set up on our wireless network.
B008DWG5HE,23,17,I use to have an IPAD with 3G and found it more expensive than using the WiFi with a hotspot device.
B008DWG5HE,23,18,WiFi suddenly doesn't work.
B008DWG5HE,23,19,I don't know if the problem is with the device, android OS, the school network or any combination of the three but the problem is that since this device isn't as popular as the iPad, the problem isn't going to be solved anytime soon.So if you need reliable access to wifi, this device may not be for you.
B008DWG5HE,23,20,Problem:  Ipad  or  Samsung Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,23,21,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,23,22,My girlfriend has taken video footage with her phone (an Apple phone, that she has never had a problem with she says) of this device freaking out for minutes on end.
B008DWG5HE,23,23,It connects easily and works just like it should.
B008DWG5HE,23,24,On top of that I can just use it to connect to the internet, etc.
B008DWG5HE,24,0,The touch screen is great.-the
B008DWG5HE,24,1,screen keyboard is customizable.
B008DWG5HE,24,2,We can't do anything on it, we can't even get to the home screen without it going nuts.
B008DWG5HE,24,3,It touch screen system is perfact.
B008DWG5HE,24,4,thing to note about the screen.
B008DWG5HE,24,5,The touch screen is extremely sensitive and it takes only the slightest of touch to registeryour input.
B008DWG5HE,24,6,The screen is very sensitive.
B008DWG5HE,24,7,I feel like that is space that can be used for placing more icons or something but when you touch the empty space the home screen will go the next screen over.
B008DWG5HE,24,8,* Screen - Very sensitive.
B008DWG5HE,24,9,Someone would think that a 10 inch wide screen is hard to type on.
B008DWG5HE,24,10,Everything on screen is still visible, just no touch function at all with either finger or pen.
B008DWG5HE,24,11,I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.Bad things (I think)-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful.
B008DWG5HE,24,12,I often have to press screen buttons multiple times to get it to register.-
B008DWG5HE,24,13,There are times when you press a button or select something with the pen and it does not register, and you have to press a second time.-
B008DWG5HE,24,14,The continual problems I have had with the note is that the left side of the touch screen lacks sensitivity when using the virtual keyboard.
B008DWG5HE,24,15,However, the potentiometer was very sensitive and at first I over adjusted so that the pen was writing on the screen when it wasn't even touching the glass.
B008DWG5HE,24,16,I am now looking at getting a keyboard for it because using the on screen keyboard is really inefficient for tyling more than about one sentence.
B008DWG5HE,24,17,It can be a big keyboard, a small keyboard that you can drag anywhere on the screen, or a split up keyboard that has half of a keyboard on one side of the screen and the other half on the other side.
B008DWG5HE,24,18,It keyboard is wonderful with pre-emptive facility.
B008DWG5HE,24,19,Some times you can press the button on the S Pen to erase instead of write and some times you can just use your finger to erase while using the S Pen to write.
B008DWG5HE,24,20,Well, I have been able to use it effectively in this manner, but I have found that the S-pen is rather tricky to use and takes some getting used to.The S-pen:The first thing I noticed when trying to write with the s-pen out of the box is that I had to press too hard on the screen to make it write.
B008DWG5HE,24,21,It will recognize when you are looking at the screen or when you are not looking at it.
B008DWG5HE,24,22,The "n" and "m" keys often do not register properly causing multiple delays in touch typing.
B008DWG5HE,24,23,When you are at the home screens, there is like a literal inch on both the left and right sides of the screen where you cannot place apps or anything.
B008DWG5HE,24,24,It's just little things that I've noticed: the ink having a tad bit of lag as it "flows" onto the screen as you write.
B008DWG5HE,25,0,iPad isn't.
B008DWG5HE,25,1,This tablet makes the iPad obsolete.
B008DWG5HE,25,2,And it has everything that my Ipad has.
B008DWG5HE,25,3,I also didn't like how on ipad you can only line up the Apps in little rows.
B008DWG5HE,25,4,Why would anyone buy an iPad?
B008DWG5HE,25,5,I have an iPad 3 also and it's something it can never do.
B008DWG5HE,25,6,I have an Ipad as well as this Galaxy Note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,7,I would rather have all Samsung Note  10.1's then I would Ipads.
B008DWG5HE,25,8,To me Apple is a niche product.
B008DWG5HE,25,9,I got the Samsung because I am not happy with the iPhone4s and Apple....so I didn't want to get an iPad.
B008DWG5HE,25,10,I still have my new iPad but have forgotten and have not turned it on since.
B008DWG5HE,25,11,This definetely is an ipad smoker.
B008DWG5HE,25,12,Samsung's time has come.
B008DWG5HE,25,13,From that outlook, it is better than the Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,14,Compare it to the Ipad.
B008DWG5HE,25,15,I've had experiences with Ipads and other tablets in the past but never purchased one because they have little to no value for productivity.
B008DWG5HE,25,16,Even on the iPad 2, I still had at least 1 or 2 freeze/crush every other day or so.
B008DWG5HE,25,17,I have 5 Note 10.1 and 3 IPads.
B008DWG5HE,25,18,Samsung was on the path to great product until they started to make it exclusive to thier products!!
B008DWG5HE,25,19,This device runs Android 2.3.
B008DWG5HE,25,20,I debated for a while between the ipad and the samsung galaxy note 10.1.
B008DWG5HE,25,21,A GREAT DEVICE!
B008DWG5HE,25,22,the S Note app is great and I have used it sometimes for work.GREAT product.
B008DWG5HE,25,23,I love this Samsung device.
B008DWG5HE,25,24,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,26,0,Used new cable and old charger and it charged, used old cable and new charger and NO CHARGE.
B008DWG5HE,26,1,My Note stopped charging with both AC charger and through USB.
B008DWG5HE,26,2,I also like that I can connect it to my computer's USB port and use it as an external hard drive.
B008DWG5HE,26,3,Wish it used micro usb rather than proprietary data connection.
B008DWG5HE,26,4,The propriety SAMSUNG plug is BS but has faster charging than micro USB.
B008DWG5HE,26,5,When I plug in a USB external hard drive to the tablet, the tablet tells me that the USB device requires too much power to operate (stick with the thumb drives, or AC adapter powered external HDDs).
B008DWG5HE,26,6,I can connect other non-Samsung devices to my tablet so I don't have to buy proprietary adapters.
B008DWG5HE,26,7,Minus another for that port being for a proprietary power plug.
B008DWG5HE,26,8,Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such.
B008DWG5HE,26,9,However the lack of a HDMI or USB port hampers its versatility.
B008DWG5HE,26,10,I will, however, note that the utter lack of external ports is disappointing.
B008DWG5HE,26,11,I even tried connecting the tablet to the USB adapter to a USB SD card reader and finally to an SD card.
B008DWG5HE,26,12,Using both new adapter and cable my Note charged flawlessly.
B008DWG5HE,26,13,Bummed to have to buy a charger now when this one should be came with the correct charger.
B008DWG5HE,26,14,You can transfer files but the power output from standard USB ports is not strong enough to power the Note.
B008DWG5HE,26,15,Mainly, when I try and charge the Note while using it, the charging cable fits into the bottom of the device.
B008DWG5HE,26,16,The cables are the problem.
B008DWG5HE,26,17,Apparently the output from a PC USB port isn't enough to charge the Note (which I can understand).
B008DWG5HE,26,18,Samsung devices each seem to require their own charger and none of them seem interchangeable at all.
B008DWG5HE,26,19,To plug a flash/thumb drive directly into the Note 10.1 you have to buy a adapter.
B008DWG5HE,26,20,When I try to charge it from a source that doesn't provide enough power (it needs 5v 2A), the tablet tells me that it is receiving inadequate power.
B008DWG5HE,26,21,I ordered several replacement cables (Note to charger/USB) and a new AC adapter.
B008DWG5HE,26,22,Female USB OTG adapter) which allows you to hook up a flash card reader or a USB thumb drive to your tablet.
B008DWG5HE,26,23,This kit provides access to many USB devices (including printers, USB sticks, keyboards, mouses and SD cards).
B008DWG5HE,26,24,No problems connecting to any bt devices so far.
B008DWG5HE,27,0,I have had it now for 4 months and have had very few issue's.
B008DWG5HE,27,1,Keeps freezing and then randomly rebooting.
B008DWG5HE,27,2,I just LOVE this thing.
B008DWG5HE,27,3,It does seem to be kind of slow at times and it can lock up easily.
B008DWG5HE,27,4,Slow, locks up and doesn't do much.
B008DWG5HE,27,5,I bought this just because I wanted it and because my old outdated one died but I can't put this thing down, everyday I find something new and exciting about this thing.
B008DWG5HE,27,6,For a while it would freeze up a lot while using the note app.
B008DWG5HE,27,7,That was quite annoying, but besides that incident, my Note has been great.
B008DWG5HE,27,8,This forced a total reset.
B008DWG5HE,27,9,Great Product if you want an Android Operating System.
B008DWG5HE,27,10,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,27,11,The first day it died, the next day after updates on the second  day wifi issues.
B008DWG5HE,27,12,It freezes too often.
B008DWG5HE,27,13,It freezes too often.
B008DWG5HE,27,14,So when they have some spare time they make a app for android.
B008DWG5HE,27,15,It is easy to conceive drone system for transporting package.
B008DWG5HE,27,16,I don' know how easy it is to delete things I'll never need, if I can delete at all.
B008DWG5HE,27,17,This is  the only good thing about it.
B008DWG5HE,27,18,Works perfectly had mine for a few months already.
B008DWG5HE,27,19,I love it firstly for Android operating system and lots of existing apps.
B008DWG5HE,27,20,I actually use my nexus 7 way more than this piece of garbage.
B008DWG5HE,27,21,I'm sure time will cure that issue.
B008DWG5HE,27,22,The shipment received on time.
B008DWG5HE,27,23,You have to turn it off a lot to get it to work.
B008DWG5HE,27,24,I held-in the start button for 10, 20, 30 seconds up to a couple of minutes and one time the screen came alive with some inverted yellow triangle flashing.
B008DWG5HE,28,0,It took 2 weeks for repairs.
B008DWG5HE,28,1,The shipment received on time.
B008DWG5HE,28,2,So, I decieded returning it as well.
B008DWG5HE,28,3,According to Samsung customer service it wont be unblocked any time soon.
B008DWG5HE,28,4,Poor Inspection process and Bypassing Customer Service responsbility.
B008DWG5HE,28,5,At first it said it did not support my device!
B008DWG5HE,28,6,Samsung customer service is horrible.
B008DWG5HE,28,7,If I bought the product from Amazon, why do I have to contact the maufacturer's Website.
B008DWG5HE,28,8,Samsung's customer service experience.
B008DWG5HE,28,9,Called customer support and they had me reset it to factory settings.
B008DWG5HE,28,10,They said to return it back to sam's club, sam's club says to contact Samsung instead.
B008DWG5HE,28,11,People talk about having to call into Samsung support over and over and over again, the flippant attitudes of the support people, and the unwillingness for Samsung to stand behind their product and provide a new unit when it's obvious a unit is defective.For the complete lack of customer support and poor quality/design, I will not be buying ANY Samsung tablet.
B008DWG5HE,28,12,If Amazon is selling a product, I expect Amazon customer service to provide the required service.
B008DWG5HE,28,13,Immediately notified Amazon.
B008DWG5HE,28,14,Made my purchase in February and have had nothing but problems.
B008DWG5HE,28,15,I wanted to send this unit back to Amazon.com but Samsung has held up the progress because of the adapter and my 30 days  return warranty has expired with Amazon.I would have never had this problem with Apple.
B008DWG5HE,28,16,Amazon responded promptly to contact Samsung Website.
B008DWG5HE,28,17,I tried a "do it yourself repair that did not work and order a new device.
B008DWG5HE,28,18,Beyond the first 90 days Apple wants to charge for tech support.
B008DWG5HE,28,19,This would be ok if it fixed the problem but it didn't.
B008DWG5HE,28,20,To me Apple is a niche product.
B008DWG5HE,28,21,if you purchase their products you are on your own after they get your money.
B008DWG5HE,28,22,I know little about Apple products.
B008DWG5HE,28,23,Don't direct it to the product manufacturer to solve the problem.
B008DWG5HE,28,24,Missing parts not once, not twice but 3 times, and all boxes were open.
B008DWG5HE,29,0,However lately when he moves it a certain way the screen gets lines across it and is unreadable.
B008DWG5HE,29,1,If he moves it when that happens, the screen will straighten out for a bit and then go back to lines.
B008DWG5HE,29,2,And if you can't find your window, just hit the windows icon on the bottom and it shows a list of open windows.
B008DWG5HE,29,3,Be careful about screen protectors: most are "squishy" and so don't really work with the stylus.
B008DWG5HE,29,4,Instead, if you want to make a window disappear from the screen, you have to close the app appearing in the window.
B008DWG5HE,29,5,I am also disappointed that you can't shrink windows down to a single bar at the bottom of the screen like you can in Microsoft Windows for PC.
B008DWG5HE,29,6,I don't have time for that and want it out of the way.I believe that many of the inadvertent activations of these various screens could have been prevented by putting this bottom Home/MiniApps/Notifications bar at the top of the screen like on many phones.
B008DWG5HE,29,7,Switching from one window to another merely requires a tap on the window you want to work in.
B008DWG5HE,29,8,The screen is fine.2.5.
B008DWG5HE,29,9,I'm sure time will cure that issue.
B008DWG5HE,29,10,This bugs me a bit and I carry a micro-fiber cloth for the screen wherever I go, but without a case, the back gets as much or more cloth time.3.
B008DWG5HE,29,11,It will automatically tile two windows side-by-side, and you can adjust the proportion of the screen that each inhabits.
B008DWG5HE,29,12,Across several apps functions like zoom cause temporay blackout on screen during active scaling.
B008DWG5HE,29,13,I can have 2 apps open not only at the same time, I can use both at the same time, on the same screen.
B008DWG5HE,29,14,Also all the screens and bar at the bottom are Very busy.
B008DWG5HE,29,15,Having said that, however, I don't have any problem reading on the note 10.1's screen, and think that it really looks quite nice.
B008DWG5HE,29,16,I tried many cases and screen protectors before I settled on mine.
B008DWG5HE,29,17,Some of the time it will select the link you are trying to open in a web browser and the other times it will select another link close to the tip because it's not tracking correctly.
B008DWG5HE,29,18,Screen rotation is a bit too sensitive.
B008DWG5HE,29,19,Weird things like when the screen was locked and I rotated the tablet there would be a flash of the home screen or one of the programs running in the background.
B008DWG5HE,29,20,You also cannot customize your screens.
B008DWG5HE,29,21,You can also resize the windows and move them around.Touch Wiz is on top of Android and Works Seamlessly with it.
B008DWG5HE,29,22,When you reopen the app, it will come back up in the window on the same place on the screen, but the document you had open previously (in the case of Polaris) will have to be reopened.Screen:This is, of course, a standard 1280x800 resolution screen.
B008DWG5HE,29,23,Over 6 hours of screen time I was still at 50% one time.
B008DWG5HE,29,24,The conversion from Windows XP to touch screen and stylus was much easier than I had envisioned.

B00CYQPM42,0,24,Kindle vs Kindle Fire HD vs Fire HDX.
B00CYQPM42,1,0,Not enough apps.
B00CYQPM42,1,1,There are some apps that are not available through Amazon but there are other ways to get most of the apps you want with investigation.
B00CYQPM42,1,2,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,1,3,Does not do Google plus and most apps...
B00CYQPM42,1,4,not playing videos.
B00CYQPM42,1,5,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,1,6,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,1,7,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,1,8,You know there HAS to be an app for that!
B00CYQPM42,1,9,Also if i want to install google apps it is possible.
B00CYQPM42,1,10,The only downfall is no Google play store access.
B00CYQPM42,1,11,You play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).-
B00CYQPM42,1,12,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,1,13,Now, whenever possible, I'm going to download the movie to my tablet, and then watch it from the download.
B00CYQPM42,1,14,my daughter really wanted the furby boom app for her furby and we found out later it was only available through google play..
B00CYQPM42,1,15,app.
B00CYQPM42,1,16,I'm really enjoying all the Apps and playing "Candycrush"!
B00CYQPM42,1,17,With an Android device, you can access the Amazon Android store, but with a Kindle Fire, you cannot access the Google Play store.
B00CYQPM42,1,18,If Amazon would just switch to Google Play for the app store, then there is nothing that would stop them from ruling the world!
B00CYQPM42,1,19,But if you want a tablet that has unrestricted access to every app out there, you'll have to look elsewhere.
B00CYQPM42,1,20,They do not play.
B00CYQPM42,1,21,Right now, there are about 1 million Android apps, and on the Kindle you can only get about 10% of them.I know some people think "10% of 1 million apps is still 100,000 apps which is plenty."
B00CYQPM42,1,22,I have found many useful lifestyle apps (food diaries, calorie counters, etc).
B00CYQPM42,1,23,Why is there no app for an update for Flash Player?
B00CYQPM42,1,24,I also love to download Prime videos for later.
B00CYQPM42,2,0,Got it at a great price
B00CYQPM42,2,1,Great for the price.

B00CYQPM42,2,24,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,3,0,Battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,1,battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,2,aweful battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,3,battery doesn't last.
B00CYQPM42,3,4,The battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,3,5,Battery runs out way too quickly.
B00CYQPM42,3,6,The battery life is much longer.
B00CYQPM42,3,7,Already went threw the hints on how to save battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,8,The battery life is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,3,9,Battery life is pretty good.
B00CYQPM42,3,10,Everything works great, but the battery life is not nearly as long as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,3,11,Not to happy with the battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,12,Battery life is great so far.-
B00CYQPM42,3,13,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,3,14,The lousy battery life is my main complaint, however.
B00CYQPM42,3,15,Have to charge it almost every day.
B00CYQPM42,3,16,And the battery life is the best I have ever had.
B00CYQPM42,3,17,Light weightBattery life is over 10 hours.
B00CYQPM42,3,18,Seems battery doesn't last as long as first kindle.
B00CYQPM42,3,19,Battery life is not as advertised.
B00CYQPM42,3,20,Battery life is ok - probably need to recharge every other day with normal use.
B00CYQPM42,3,21,My previous kindle charged quickly even in use and had an amazing battery life!
B00CYQPM42,3,22,I expected the battery to last much longer.
B00CYQPM42,3,23,Battery only last for two to three  hours.
B00CYQPM42,3,24,There are battery savers that shut down what isn’t needed and does make a difference in battery life.
B00CYQPM42,4,0,Sound good.
B00CYQPM42,4,1,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,2,The HD quality is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,3,A great tablet at a great price.
B00CYQPM42,4,4,Great tablet at a great price...
B00CYQPM42,4,5,This is a good product that was I expected to be because it has a better screen and more features than any other tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,6,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,4,7,Really great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,8,great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,9,very nice apps, the resolution and sound is great.
B00CYQPM42,4,10,Sound is really good (not home theater quality or anything) but better than any phone I've heard.
B00CYQPM42,4,11,I feel like the hd speakers are a little better than this, but not much.
B00CYQPM42,4,12,The colors are richer and sound is much better.
B00CYQPM42,4,13,This feels really good in your hand and the screen is BEAUTIFUL.
B00CYQPM42,4,14,I would tell anyone that this is a great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,4,15,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,4,16,Decent sound
B00CYQPM42,4,17,The sound is also much better and louder.
B00CYQPM42,4,18,The built in speakers are also better than my iPad 1.
B00CYQPM42,4,19,The sound while listening to audiobooks and movies is very good.
B00CYQPM42,4,20,The Dolby speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass.
B00CYQPM42,4,21,And the sound!
B00CYQPM42,4,22,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,4,23,Just as good or even better than the Apple ipad.
B00CYQPM42,4,24,The screen is fantastic and the speakers produce great sound that is fairly loud.
B00CYQPM42,5,0,that isn't really a camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,1,Takes great pictures!
B00CYQPM42,5,2,this is not good because it does not seem you can take a picture of something you are looking at.
B00CYQPM42,5,3,The picture quality is absurd.
B00CYQPM42,5,4,I also don't like the front only camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,5,It could only be more perfect if it had a front facing camera!
B00CYQPM42,5,6,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,7,The poor quality front facing only camera on it.
B00CYQPM42,5,8,she does however have a problem with the camera part, apparently you can only take pictures that are facing the front of the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,5,9,Clear picture, quality sound.
B00CYQPM42,5,10,As great as the ads said it would be!
B00CYQPM42,5,11,don't need a picture of my ugly mug looking at my kindle.
B00CYQPM42,5,12,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,5,13,Works great.
B00CYQPM42,5,14,I don't like just front camera ure feature..rather, I prefer rear camera.
B00CYQPM42,5,15,The only camera is on the front side (screen side), so taking video or a picture with it is difficult because you can't see the screen.
B00CYQPM42,5,16,The built in camera is so nice and takes anexcellent picture.
B00CYQPM42,5,17,Very good better than what a t I expected.The only thing is the camera it only have front and not back.But I guess that's why it have the kindle hdx8.9 cause that have both.
B00CYQPM42,5,18,Very easy to use and the picture quality is excellent.
B00CYQPM42,5,19,The camera is awesome...
B00CYQPM42,5,20,The camera could be a little better, but very nice to be able to Skype.
B00CYQPM42,5,21,VERY GOOD! Love this thing...........except the camera is on the WRONG side.
B00CYQPM42,5,22,Love the clear, crisp picture.
B00CYQPM42,5,23,I ONLY WISH THE CAMERA WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
B00CYQPM42,5,24,Picture is clear, color is great.
B00CYQPM42,6,0,Great Screen.
B00CYQPM42,6,1,The processor is fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,2,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,6,3,A great tablet at a great price.
B00CYQPM42,6,4,Great tablet at a great price...
B00CYQPM42,6,5,The screen is beautiful and it is incredibly fast!
B00CYQPM42,6,6,Awesome screen.
B00CYQPM42,6,7,Great value!
B00CYQPM42,6,8,Amazing, Fast, Beautiful display.
B00CYQPM42,6,9,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,6,10,Fast, very fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,11,Beautiful display screen.
B00CYQPM42,6,12,The screen is just beautiful.
B00CYQPM42,6,13,Great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,6,14,like he says, it does it all, and the graphics are great and so easy to take along wherever you go.
B00CYQPM42,6,15,Great value.
B00CYQPM42,6,16,This thing is great!
B00CYQPM42,6,17,The graphics are great.
B00CYQPM42,6,18,The improved 'carousel' and apps screen is also a nice improvement.
B00CYQPM42,6,19,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,6,20,Display is amazingly sharp, and the android OS is very fast.
B00CYQPM42,6,21,This has been a great tablet.
B00CYQPM42,6,22,The unit has a lovely display, it's responsive and a great overall tablet.
B00CYQPM42,6,23,It's extremely faster now, light weight, the screen is amazingly clear.
B00CYQPM42,6,24,The display is beautiful, bright and color accurate.It is more than fast enough for my use.
B00CYQPM42,7,0,She has so much more storage space.
B00CYQPM42,7,1,However, this tablet is so much faster and with the 64 GB of storage I can do so much more.
B00CYQPM42,7,2,MUCH MEMORY SHOULD I GET:----------------------------The base model with 16GB memory is $229.
B00CYQPM42,7,3,The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB.
B00CYQPM42,7,4,Here's why:$2.50 per GB to add 16GB storage to base model for a total of 32GB.$1.67 per GB to add 48GB storage to the base model for a total of 64GB.I got the 64GB model because I am a content lover.
B00CYQPM42,7,5,64 GB was the cheapest upgrade option per GB.
B00CYQPM42,7,6,Love, love, love, LOVE it!
B00CYQPM42,7,7,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,7,8,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,7,9,This is the best value if you are going to upgrade the internal storage size.
B00CYQPM42,7,10,too many slot pop ups.
B00CYQPM42,7,11,If you're not sold on the reigning king of the tablet space, this is a good option for most users.
B00CYQPM42,7,12,I got the 32 GB version, so there is plenty of room for games and other apps.
B00CYQPM42,7,13,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,7,14,Movies, books, audio, and apps all run in superior order, with the only down side, is memory expandability (an extra slot for loading more solid state memory as a card).
B00CYQPM42,7,15,32GB will provide you more memory space for pics, hd movies, etc. Apps eat up a lot of memory quickly.I recommend that Amazon provide the approx number of movies etc can be stored on each kindle model with its specs.
B00CYQPM42,7,16,If you've never owned a tablet before, or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model Fire, I would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing - but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs. the minimum 16 GB.
B00CYQPM42,7,17,But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing.
B00CYQPM42,7,18,Also, I'm interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker's performance I mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case.Overall, at $229 for the 16GB of memory model ($309 for 64 GB of memory) I think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video / apps feature.
B00CYQPM42,7,19,To quadruple the base memory of 16GB to 64GB costs $80.
B00CYQPM42,7,20,Download videos in SD and it will save a lot of space and still be decent viewing quality.
B00CYQPM42,7,21,Love it, love it!!
B00CYQPM42,7,22,I highly recommend purchasing 32 GB .
B00CYQPM42,7,23,love my fire but go for the 32GB.
B00CYQPM42,7,24,Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage.
B00CYQPM42,8,0,Love It!! What a great device!!
B00CYQPM42,8,1,Great for watching movies and surfing the web.
B00CYQPM42,8,2,Good device.
B00CYQPM42,8,3,Movies look great, games look great, photos and games look great.
B00CYQPM42,8,4,I use it for not only reading but gaming, email, and surfing the net.
B00CYQPM42,8,5,It works very well for music, reading docucuments and general web page browsing mhm habit video watching I is quite unreliable.
B00CYQPM42,8,6,I read and write email, surf the web, read and listen to books and watch videos.
B00CYQPM42,8,7,I can check e-mails, facebook, read, play games.
B00CYQPM42,8,8,I mean c'mon, reading from the book is what it's all about.
B00CYQPM42,8,9,This is a great device at an exceptional price.
B00CYQPM42,8,10,I do however have problems reading and watching movies while out in the sun.
B00CYQPM42,8,11,It's easy to use and provides a high-quality experience for reading e-Books, browsing the Internet and watching video.
B00CYQPM42,8,12,Also love Fashioning and web surfing on it.
B00CYQPM42,8,13,Regardless if your looking for something to watch Netflix on, read books, and surf the web it's excellent.
B00CYQPM42,8,14,not playing videos.
B00CYQPM42,8,15,I love being able to check e-mail on it also.
B00CYQPM42,8,16,They play games on it too.
B00CYQPM42,8,17,Great traveling companion.
B00CYQPM42,8,18,Great for reading books and listening to music.
B00CYQPM42,8,19,I bought this kindle so I could watch my movies, read my books.
B00CYQPM42,8,20,It's very easy to use, and I like being able to read books and the Bible on it.
B00CYQPM42,8,21,I did have a problem with it not reading books I had already purchased (DRM problem).
B00CYQPM42,8,22,She reads and listens to music as well as plays games on it.
B00CYQPM42,8,23,I can check my email and go to Facebook instead of always going to my computer.
B00CYQPM42,8,24,I haven't found it to be annoying at all and shouldn't be a deal-breaker.I use the device for reading of books and magazines, watching movies and television shows, playing games, e-mail and light surfing of the web.
B00CYQPM42,9,0,I am using it to write this review, actually.
B00CYQPM42,9,1,The touch sceen on the iPad also works a lot smoother and is more accurate.
B00CYQPM42,9,2,The notepad app. is a nice feature.
B00CYQPM42,9,3,I am enjoying it so far other than that screen being a little small for me I think it has terrific features.
B00CYQPM42,9,4,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,9,5,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,9,6,It also feels better in the hand then other tablets.As with all non-iOS products, it doesn't have all of the apps or usability that I'd like, but that will come with time.
B00CYQPM42,9,7,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,9,8,Did not realize all the Apps available for this tablet and functionality this tablet provides.
B00CYQPM42,9,9,best multipurpose tablet in medium size.
B00CYQPM42,9,10,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,9,11,I keep finding things that  I didn't know were there.
B00CYQPM42,9,12,It's ways to buy apps.
B00CYQPM42,9,13,I love the ability to highlight, write notes, etc. on books and PDF files.
B00CYQPM42,9,14,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,9,15,I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).
B00CYQPM42,9,16,I love the predictive keyboard, which to me is similar to my iPad minis, because I can make a lot of mistakes typing quickly.
B00CYQPM42,9,17,This is a good product that was I expected to be because it has a better screen and more features than any other tablet.
B00CYQPM42,9,18,What I do like is when it does work it's pretty accurate as far as words.
B00CYQPM42,9,19,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,9,20,(In my opinion anyway) the iPad is a lot easier to navigate around on, speech to text always works as well.
B00CYQPM42,9,21,pretty AWESOME.
B00CYQPM42,9,22,I normally don't write reviews, even when I like something.
B00CYQPM42,9,23,They are small and fit comfortable in your hands, easy set up, easy screens to screens, everything is at your finger tips.
B00CYQPM42,9,24,This device is well designed, color is excellent, good battery life, good sized screen, easy to use and generally all around handy device to have and the price is excellent for what you get.
B00CYQPM42,10,0,I never had a tablet before and this is nice because it is the right size to take any place with you.
B00CYQPM42,10,1,Really good.
B00CYQPM42,10,2,I love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,3,love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,4,It is a great size and it works so nicely.
B00CYQPM42,10,5,Love Love Love.
B00CYQPM42,10,6,Good size screen and colors.
B00CYQPM42,10,7,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,8,Nice product and very easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,10,9,I love the size.
B00CYQPM42,10,10,Very nice.
B00CYQPM42,10,11,But all in all, if you like thin, fast it is great.
B00CYQPM42,10,12,Easy to use, lots of apps, light weight, and the screen is very clear.
B00CYQPM42,10,13,It is so light, and just the right size to hold.
B00CYQPM42,10,14,love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,15,I love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,16,Good Enough.
B00CYQPM42,10,17,Just the right size!
B00CYQPM42,10,18,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,19,Good shape, size and easy to use.
B00CYQPM42,10,20,I love it!
B00CYQPM42,10,21,Love it!!!
B00CYQPM42,10,22,Love it.
B00CYQPM42,10,23,Very nice product
B00CYQPM42,10,24,Loving it.
B00CYQPM42,11,0,The Lack of even a mini USB port.
B00CYQPM42,11,1,Only thing that is really lacking is a USB port otherwise it is a great little product.
B00CYQPM42,11,2,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,11,3,I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.
B00CYQPM42,11,4,It's got Miracast but unfortunately my tv doesn't support it so I can't make it mirror the screen on to the tv.
B00CYQPM42,11,5,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,11,6,When I realized too late that it had no HDMI out, I bought a Tronsmart miracast device.
B00CYQPM42,11,7,An HDMI output would have been good for the HDX also.
B00CYQPM42,11,8,The lack of an HDMI port and to watch TV, you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by Amazon.3.
B00CYQPM42,11,9,With the wifi off…battery life is very good.
B00CYQPM42,11,10,It's like a mini laptop to go!
B00CYQPM42,11,11,This device is well designed, color is excellent, good battery life, good sized screen, easy to use and generally all around handy device to have and the price is excellent for what you get.
B00CYQPM42,11,12,It is not the end of the world if I can’t hook up the hotel TV.
B00CYQPM42,11,13,Very light, great screen, good battery life.
B00CYQPM42,11,14,Movies look great, games look great, photos and games look great.
B00CYQPM42,11,15,Then they took away the HDMI port which I use often to play a movies on my TV.
B00CYQPM42,11,16,Again my old Droid telephone provides a USB port and offers a charging device with a built in USB hub that allows me to connect to any number of external attachments, and this tablet does not.Regretfully the impact of these limitations did not come to mind when I bought the Kindle, but would have if I knew the fully understood the tablets limitations.Would I recommend this tablet to friends or family?
B00CYQPM42,11,17,And the possibilities are endless!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!
B00CYQPM42,11,18,I understand the previous HD version had a HDMI output.
B00CYQPM42,11,19,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,11,20,Was so impressed I bought another one for my son.Ted A
B00CYQPM42,11,21,The battery is good and the camera is great.
B00CYQPM42,11,22,Something to keep in mind if youre shopping around for a tablet.Also I guess the HD models could hook up to a TV with a HDMI cable.
B00CYQPM42,11,23,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,11,24,One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge.
B00CYQPM42,12,0,I have 3 ipads & a iPad Mini.
B00CYQPM42,12,1,Better than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,12,2,Better than my ipad.
B00CYQPM42,12,3,I also own a Samsung Note 8, several iPads and have several other tablets as well.
B00CYQPM42,12,4,Just as good or even better than the Apple ipad.
B00CYQPM42,12,5,It out does my iPad mini by far.
B00CYQPM42,12,6,It is easy to use and compact.Does everything a mini I-pad does.
B00CYQPM42,12,7,Galaxy tab, Nexus, iPad, iPad mini).
B00CYQPM42,12,8,I like it more than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,12,9,I own an iPad 10inch.
B00CYQPM42,12,10,I'm an avid Apple product user and not a fan of Android phone OS.
B00CYQPM42,12,11,Good tablet overall but the thing is the appstore its has about 10x less than the apple apps in the appstore
B00CYQPM42,12,12,They say the android system is getting the bugs worked out and works as well as Apple.
B00CYQPM42,12,13,Love this tablet!
B00CYQPM42,12,14,I love it.
B00CYQPM42,12,15,I love it so far.
B00CYQPM42,12,16,For him it's a nice improvement from the iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,12,17,But I LOVE THIS THING!
B00CYQPM42,12,18,This tablet also doesn't have flash along with all modern Android and Apple products.
B00CYQPM42,12,19,I love this device!
B00CYQPM42,12,20,I have used, recently, a Nexus 7 (2013) and an iPad Air.
B00CYQPM42,12,21,;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.
B00CYQPM42,12,22,love the upgrade.
B00CYQPM42,12,23,Im not really sure how amazon even makes money off these things when you compare it too comparable apple of android products.
B00CYQPM42,12,24,Android based little powerhouse.
B00CYQPM42,13,0,Great product!
B00CYQPM42,13,1,If I had known I wouldn't have purchased this product.
B00CYQPM42,13,2,Great Product.
B00CYQPM42,13,3,GREAT PRODUCT.
B00CYQPM42,13,4,I returned this product.
B00CYQPM42,13,5,Great customer service!!
B00CYQPM42,13,6,Great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,7,Plus great customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,8,Great!
B00CYQPM42,13,9,It’s not like it used to be, buy our product and use it as you wish.
B00CYQPM42,13,10,Thank you Amazon for making such a wonderful product and for having such wonderful customer service!
B00CYQPM42,13,11,You now must purchase an additional product from amazon at a cost of around $100.
B00CYQPM42,13,12,I even called customer service and they said there's was a problem with it.
B00CYQPM42,13,13,I'm pretty aggravated any time I have to deal with Amazon Customer Service.
B00CYQPM42,13,14,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,13,15,Thank you amazon....
B00CYQPM42,13,16,Keep up the great work Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,13,17,Congratulations to Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,13,18,fast shipping.
B00CYQPM42,13,19,Amazon coins have been a great value!
B00CYQPM42,13,20,So I contacted Amazon customer service and let me just say they really are as amazing as everyone says!
B00CYQPM42,13,21,I think they are a great value and being backed by amazon means they will be supported for a long time.
B00CYQPM42,13,22,I was able to purchase this product during Amazon's wonderful Cyber Monday sale.
B00CYQPM42,13,23,Easy to use and if you do have a question great customer service if quickly available.
B00CYQPM42,13,24,However, I am largely happy with my purchase, and am definitely happy with Amazon's customer service!
B00CYQPM42,14,0,Otherwise this product is great!
B00CYQPM42,14,1,My next was an iPad 2 and then a Microsoft Surface Pro.
B00CYQPM42,14,2,Not the best tablet, but perhaps the best value.
B00CYQPM42,14,3,Hardware is great!
B00CYQPM42,14,4,This device is the best digital do hicky I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,14,5,Although it's old tech now, one thing I love about Samsung products is they LAST.
B00CYQPM42,14,6,There are a few financial apps that are not compatible with the tablet that are compatible with my other smart phones.
B00CYQPM42,14,7,The device is everything I hoped for.
B00CYQPM42,14,8,It is so FAST…compared to my android ASUS transformer tablet.
B00CYQPM42,14,9,I tend to take this thing everywhere with me.The only thing is I tend to prefer the straight android environment of the Nexus 7. Otherwise this is a great device.
B00CYQPM42,14,10,My first was a Samsung Galaxy 7.5.
B00CYQPM42,14,11,it..love it.
B00CYQPM42,14,12,love it.
B00CYQPM42,14,13,Good tablet overall but the thing is the appstore its has about 10x less than the apple apps in the appstore
B00CYQPM42,14,14,I first mis-read this for using Microsoft office.
B00CYQPM42,14,15,Great tool for everyone.
B00CYQPM42,14,16,Great Hardware, Horrible App store!
B00CYQPM42,14,17,This is the even better than my smart phone and I think it's smarter!
B00CYQPM42,14,18,Nice.
B00CYQPM42,14,19,This is, to date, the BEST tablet I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,14,20,This is a good product that was I expected to be because it has a better screen and more features than any other tablet.
B00CYQPM42,14,21,Hope the replacement works better .
B00CYQPM42,14,22,Google you can't exactly use Microsoft office but does have word processing capabilities for all of us "on-the-go" and who can't afford the beautiful new window tablets.
B00CYQPM42,14,23,By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.
B00CYQPM42,14,24,Good size over a full on tablet.
B00CYQPM42,15,0,Very Clear Screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,1,And it just looks sharp with the black screen and backing.
B00CYQPM42,15,2,It is just a slight blue haze at the borders--when displaying white--of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,3,I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times.
B00CYQPM42,15,4,Great tablet, but again the 7" screen doesn't cut it.
B00CYQPM42,15,5,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,15,6,The reflections are the worst when the screen is mainly black, which happens often because the main screen of the tablet is black.
B00CYQPM42,15,7,There are 4 obvious shadows at the bottom of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,8,As for the rest, the screen is very sharp, and colors are great.
B00CYQPM42,15,9,So I turned it back down to a brightness of about 75% which is bright enough without being too bright.The only problem I have with the screen is that it is very reflective, easily the most reflective tablet I've ever used.
B00CYQPM42,15,10,I did not noticed until I started reading about it.
B00CYQPM42,15,11,The screen is also great and very hi def.
B00CYQPM42,15,12,The screen is crystal clear (much better than iPad mini) and the viewing angle is incredible.
B00CYQPM42,15,13,The only other problem I have noticed is with the screen resolution.
B00CYQPM42,15,14,I don't think its so horrible that you won't be able to read on the white screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,15,I'd prefer a cream color (the stark white is a bit too bright for me) with dark black text.
B00CYQPM42,15,16,screen is sharp.
B00CYQPM42,15,17,It has a very sharp screen, it's very easy to use, and the price is right.
B00CYQPM42,15,18,Some very odd things such as displaying messages in colors that can't be read.
B00CYQPM42,15,19,I do not like the blue lighting around the edges, it something resets and even with a black background (to avoid the blue lighting) it has a light flicker.
B00CYQPM42,15,20,For an extra $150 and you get a much bigger screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,21,The back is a hard rubber, which is rubbery enough not to be slippery, but not so rubbery that it's mushy.SCREEN - The HDX has a 1920 x 1200 screen.
B00CYQPM42,15,22,I had high expectations for this device.
B00CYQPM42,15,23,I especially appreciate the ability of the high-res screen to show small text very clearly, which is helpful when browsing the internet.I like bright screens, but the HDX screen was actually too bright at 100% brightness.
B00CYQPM42,15,24,Which they sent quickly....and that one had more screen issues.I don't know if I just had bad luck, but that's the point when I gave up.
B00CYQPM42,16,0,To few apps.
B00CYQPM42,16,1,My bank app isn't available (capital one).
B00CYQPM42,16,2,First, it doesn't have many apps you probably want.
B00CYQPM42,16,3,All it needs is a suitable app store.
B00CYQPM42,16,4,App store is awful!!!!!!!!!!
B00CYQPM42,16,5,No podcast player app.
B00CYQPM42,16,6,Amazon you need to fix your App store
B00CYQPM42,16,7,No YouTube app.
B00CYQPM42,16,8,There are more apps being added constantly and so far I've found everything I've needed in the app store.
B00CYQPM42,16,9,Runs on a android system but does not allow google play.
B00CYQPM42,16,10,I can't download any videos as I get an error that it is already downloaded to another one of my devices!!
B00CYQPM42,16,11,By this I mean, I can't (easily) get any Google apps installed on the device.
B00CYQPM42,16,12,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,16,13,The child or toddler apps I did download would freeze, not only the app but also the tablet!
B00CYQPM42,16,14,The horsepower running this modified Android tablet makes all of the applications hum along.
B00CYQPM42,16,15,No Google Chromecast.
B00CYQPM42,16,16,Uses Android Apps, but no access to Google Play Store.
B00CYQPM42,16,17,If you want a legitimate version of any Google product, or many other Google play apps, you cannot install it without a side-load situation.
B00CYQPM42,16,18,The App Store is severely lacking and many apps don't run right on the new tablets (Dead Trigger is upside down) and side loading apps often leaves you with apps that either don't work or don't work correctly 100% of the time!
B00CYQPM42,16,19,I was also able to install a flash player and can now run any flash web apps through the Dolphin web browser.
B00CYQPM42,16,20,It's quite obvious if any Amazon App store guys have even tried to install this Magic 2014 game that it just won't install.
B00CYQPM42,16,21,The responsibility of Downloading and Installing of the Magic 2014 application belongs to the Amazon App Store (after all, it is Amazon App Store people who authorized this to be released in their store).
B00CYQPM42,16,22,It is a fully functional tablet, and with the "side loading" of applications from the Google Play store you can use this tablet for just about any Android application (although some games from Google Play must be connected to Google Play in order to function).By the way...I used the Mayday function to ask about a setting on the tablet.
B00CYQPM42,16,23,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,16,24,Downloading and Installing problem occursThe app store after 2 month is still a bit lacking.
B00CYQPM42,17,0,Much better than an Apple I-Pad!
B00CYQPM42,17,1,Next time I'm buying an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,2,I wish I never bought it!
B00CYQPM42,17,3,awsum,so worth the buy.
B00CYQPM42,17,4,Great buy for the value.
B00CYQPM42,17,5,This is the most expensive waste of money!
B00CYQPM42,17,6,I guess I'm going to pay $200 more for and Ipad which I didn't want to do in the first place.
B00CYQPM42,17,7,Disappointing after owning an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,8,I am really disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,9,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,10,I purchased this as a gift.
B00CYQPM42,17,11,I bought two of these for Christmas, one for me one and one as a gift, at $179.
B00CYQPM42,17,12,OfficeSuite is read only, must purchase for $4.99, price is not bad.
B00CYQPM42,17,13,The iPad is great!
B00CYQPM42,17,14,Wish I had purchased something else.
B00CYQPM42,17,15,It was a Christmas present.
B00CYQPM42,17,16,I know that you get what you pay for, so I guess I should have gotten an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,17,17,PRICED JUST RIGHT.
B00CYQPM42,17,18,This is my first time with a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,17,19,The same thing happened when I bought the Kindle Paperwhite a  year ago.
B00CYQPM42,17,20,Do not purchase as a gift or you will have a hard time getting warranty replacement.
B00CYQPM42,17,21,wait before you buy.
B00CYQPM42,17,22,My son (8) bought this with his own money.
B00CYQPM42,17,23,Disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,17,24,This device is so bad that amazon should be paying the customers to use this piece of junk!I am still having so many problems with my kindle.
B00CYQPM42,18,0,Cannot turn it off.
B00CYQPM42,18,1,The first one after less than a week woudn't charge.. Sent it back and they sent us a new one.
B00CYQPM42,18,2,One time, I plugged the Kindle into charge before leaving for work, only to come home eight hours later and find that the screen was still on, and the device hadn't gone up 1% in battery charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,3,The Kindle recently died, the battery cannot be charged, even when using a different charger.
B00CYQPM42,18,4,Low battery life.
B00CYQPM42,18,5,There is no time zone for EST.
B00CYQPM42,18,6,I have to hold the power button down for 15 seconds or more for it to shut off.
B00CYQPM42,18,7,Battery life is great so far.-
B00CYQPM42,18,8,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,18,9,The kindle came to me holding a charge so I could instantaneously turn it on and play with it.
B00CYQPM42,18,10,Then, when I pick the device up and actually use it, the battery is down to needing another charge within 1 or 2 (maybe 3) hours.
B00CYQPM42,18,11,Does not hold it's charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,12,Another time, I plugged the device in for the night at 68%, went to bed and woke up to find the device charged only to 77%.
B00CYQPM42,18,13,I have this unit for several weeks now and since then I have experienced a couple of slow down response and three "blue screens" although the unit is 40%, 80 % and 55 % charged, the first time it came back after 4 hours, the second and third time after several minutes.
B00CYQPM42,18,14,Battery - I get a couple days of heavy usage (8 hours) out of it.
B00CYQPM42,18,15,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,16,I did use the May day button to remove a popup screen I kept getting.
B00CYQPM42,18,17,Every time I turn the tablet on I get  advertising.
B00CYQPM42,18,18,If the cord is propped up I can leave it plugged in all night and it won't charge.
B00CYQPM42,18,19,Fully charged at 100% and left over night will find the device down to 88% without use.
B00CYQPM42,18,20,I bought this for my 7 year old and it worked fine at first but now it keeps freezing up and we can't turn it off or anything it just freezes on whatever she was doing playing the music on and on can't even power it down until the battery dies wouldn't recommend this product.
B00CYQPM42,18,21,For the same amount of use, I'm used to charging every 2 weeks or so instead of every 3-4 days.-
B00CYQPM42,18,22,The device once went into a boot loop while I was at work without a charger.
B00CYQPM42,18,23,I just can't have a device that I am constantly worried about keeping charged all the time.
B00CYQPM42,18,24,I could stare at this thing for days (but won't).
B00CYQPM42,19,0,The sound quality is good for a tablet.
B00CYQPM42,19,1,I turned it on and it does make a noticeable difference with surround sound effect, both with speakers and headphones.
B00CYQPM42,19,2,In any case, even though the sound is going away from you, the speakers are still loud enough.
B00CYQPM42,19,3,It sounded better than the speakers and was OK.
B00CYQPM42,19,4,If you're watching a video, you'll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side.
B00CYQPM42,19,5,Also the power and volume buttons are on the back of the device which is a terrible design feature if u have it in a case bc u have to take it out every time you want to turn it on or change the volume.
B00CYQPM42,19,6,If one does need a little bit louder sound, hold it with both hands from the top, and the sound reflects directly to you, making it sound a little louder.
B00CYQPM42,19,7,With my other devices, I just feel for the button and push.-----------------------------DOWNLOAD
B00CYQPM42,19,8,Love the easier-to-locate design of the on/off button and external volume control button too.
B00CYQPM42,19,9,I wish the on/off button was located on the top or side in stead  of the bottom.
B00CYQPM42,19,10,found the speakers to have decent sound.
B00CYQPM42,19,11,The volume is a bit louder (when NOT using earphones) on the HD.
B00CYQPM42,19,12,Sound, power, silly-pretty display, feel...and did I mention power???
B00CYQPM42,19,13,IT ON:----------The power button is on the left back side.
B00CYQPM42,19,14,Hit the On/Off button accidentally for even a tenth of a second and it turns off.The volume button is also on the back, on the right side.
B00CYQPM42,19,15,The power button and volume control have been moved.
B00CYQPM42,19,16,Even though the other side has two recessed buttons for the volume, it doesn't stand out enough for me.
B00CYQPM42,19,17,Users can get confused with volume buttons on the other side.
B00CYQPM42,19,18,With the speaker on full volume, I had a difficult time hearing the female tech, Celeste.
B00CYQPM42,19,19,The speakers are located in the top, when in landscape mode, which is somewhat different from many other tablets, and adds to the usefulness of the tablet for watching videos.
B00CYQPM42,19,20,The quality of the screen is as good as the 1920 x 1200 screen on the Nexus 7, and better than every other 7" tablet I've tried.
B00CYQPM42,19,21,Really annoying.When I'm trying to turn it on, it's quicker to turn the tablet over to find the On/Off button.
B00CYQPM42,19,22,The decision to put the speakers on top in landscape mode, was a very good one.----------GRAPHICS:----------The
B00CYQPM42,19,23,Now, I think it is really useful and can see myself turning to it all the time.In movies, tap the video screen and X-Ray pops up on the left side.
B00CYQPM42,19,24,When holding landscape mode, the top, where the speakers are, is smooth glossy plastic.
B00CYQPM42,20,0,I did not like the way the camera was.
B00CYQPM42,20,1,It also doesn't have a rear facing camera, it only has a front facing one, like for apps such as Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,2,The 7” version only has a camera facing you; no camera facing outwards.
B00CYQPM42,20,3,The HDX has a front facing camera, but lacks a rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,4,The poor quality front facing only camera on it.
B00CYQPM42,20,5,Also the camera is the worst part, the camera is only on the front of the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,6,You need a camera for Skype or other video app.-
B00CYQPM42,20,7,It's got a front facing camera that we've not tried yet, but will later for Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,8,I had hoped I would be able to use it to take pictures and video as well as use it for video chat.
B00CYQPM42,20,9,Only thing I'd change is the camera on the outside for pics not of myself
B00CYQPM42,20,10,I bought the unit over the nook because it stated that the unit had a camera, but did not specify that it was only and front facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,11,I would give this a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the problems I have had with getting Skype to work.
B00CYQPM42,20,12,Other than that it's pretty decent could have a better camera and a back facing one ...I did return it for a galaxy tablet that I am much more happy with.
B00CYQPM42,20,13,My only love about it is the camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,14,It's a high-def camera suitable for video-conferencing or Skype.
B00CYQPM42,20,15,If you take the time to put a camera, why not make give it a front and rear with more megapixels to really compete with other tablets?
B00CYQPM42,20,16,she does however have a problem with the camera part, apparently you can only take pictures that are facing the front of the kindle.
B00CYQPM42,20,17,Camera is fine for Skype chats but it's not going to win any awards.
B00CYQPM42,20,18,#1 the camera on this model is only front facing but it seems that on all of the other HDX models that are larger they have a front AND rear facing camera.
B00CYQPM42,20,19,But - she has a phone and a digital camera for that!
B00CYQPM42,20,20,The only pictures you can take of are yourself because if you turn it around you can't see what you are taking a picture of.
B00CYQPM42,20,21,I perhaps would have liked the buy the double camera better but I didn't realize the camera only shoots forward at yourself rather than a normal pic (unless I'm missing something).
B00CYQPM42,20,22,It could only be more perfect if it had a front facing camera!
B00CYQPM42,20,23,Not only was the quality very bad, Kindle support is horrible, via both chat and on the phone.
B00CYQPM42,20,24,Since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in, that may not be an issue.Camera: If there is a difference between last year's camera and this year's, I'm not able to see it.
B00CYQPM42,21,0,Great Device, Better than expected.
B00CYQPM42,21,1,For the price it has its drawbacks such as often freezing when the battery gets low.
B00CYQPM42,21,2,It is REALLY hard to quit apps.
B00CYQPM42,21,3,It comes with a 2.2GHz quad-core processor, which is the standard in the latest tablets.
B00CYQPM42,21,4,The device features a fast 2.2GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM for fast that run apps, games, and videos smoothly without an issues.
B00CYQPM42,21,5,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,21,6,It has plenrty of memory to keep everything you've ever opened up and running, but dang what A pain to quit.
B00CYQPM42,21,7,The battery life is not as good as last year's model.
B00CYQPM42,21,8,It is incredible how much the 2.2Ghz quad processor improved vs last year's model Dual 1.2Ghz.Screen (9/10):This is the biggest improvement over last year's model.
B00CYQPM42,21,9,Crashed constantly.
B00CYQPM42,21,10,It moves from app to app with great speed.
B00CYQPM42,21,11,Apri 28th update - Good upgrade from last year model-Beautiful Display, Great Device-Fell short on battery life.
B00CYQPM42,21,12,Battery life is great so far.-
B00CYQPM42,21,13,The hardware in this is powerful and easily high up comparative to other tablet-like device of this size.-
B00CYQPM42,21,14,I don't have any complaints or suggestions for future changes so far (except maybe to quit tempting me with new models for a while!).
B00CYQPM42,21,15,The HDX has no problem going through any webpages I throw at it.Hopefully more apps will be optimized to use quad core soon.
B00CYQPM42,21,16,Lots of good apps.We have an iPad for a couple of years, and I really have only used that to surf the internet.
B00CYQPM42,21,17,I got my wife a two year-old USED iPad, and it has worked flawlessly for a year in our possession, never freezing or requiring a hard reboot.
B00CYQPM42,21,18,Response times are instantaneous and I have found no lag in the OS.
B00CYQPM42,21,19,Good tablet overall but the thing is the appstore its has about 10x less than the apple apps in the appstore
B00CYQPM42,21,20,Thankfully, I can set time limits for them!**UPDATE 23 OCT 2013**:I could not download videos for offline use within FreeTime.
B00CYQPM42,21,21,HDX has the latest and greatest Adreno graphics to compliment the current king of the hill quad-core Snapdragon 800 2.2GHz processor.
B00CYQPM42,21,22,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,21,23,Compared to a nexus 7 which is the same price, the HDX seems to have a slower processor.
B00CYQPM42,21,24,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,22,0,It does not take an SD card for memory expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,1,Adding Miracast to the tablet is fine, but I would have liked to also have an HDMI port.There is no SD card slot, so there is no way to expand the memory after you buy it.
B00CYQPM42,22,2,There are a number of important apps, such as apps from Google, apps from banks, etc. that you might want to use.
B00CYQPM42,22,3,I also like that there is a "on device" and "cloud" app storage so I can move apps to the Cloud when I don't want them for a time.
B00CYQPM42,22,4,In this day and age, a table ought to have a Micro SD memory card slot for expansion, and an HDMI connector - ESPECIALLY a media tablet like these!
B00CYQPM42,22,5,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,22,6,The SD video file size for a 1:06 episode was 267MB.
B00CYQPM42,22,7,But yes, I do want them to have access to other apps and videos we already purchased.
B00CYQPM42,22,8,vs 32GB vs 64GB VERSIONSI downloaded several HD videos at the highest HD setting (there is more than one HD quality setting) and they took up about 1.7 GB of storage per hour of video.
B00CYQPM42,22,9,Especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage.
B00CYQPM42,22,10,GB) of storage per hour.
B00CYQPM42,22,11,Which leads into the next thing which is how many GB of memory you will need.16GB
B00CYQPM42,22,12,Right now, there are about 1 million Android apps, and on the Kindle you can only get about 10% of them.I know some people think "10% of 1 million apps is still 100,000 apps which is plenty."
B00CYQPM42,22,13,It bothers me that my old Droid Bionic cell phone has a SanDisk slot that will let me to expand storage to 64 gigs, but you're stuck with the memory provided on the Kindle you purchase.2.
B00CYQPM42,22,14,But the free storage is limited and in my case I've been buying music from Amazon since the 1990's and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing.
B00CYQPM42,22,15,So multiply the hours above by 5 to get an estimate of the maximum number of hours of SD videos you can download.
B00CYQPM42,22,16,The fact that the device does not support storage expansion.
B00CYQPM42,22,17,Let's say an app that is really important to you, like the app for your bank so you can do banking through your tablet, isn't available on the Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,22,18,About 1 hour video episode of Downtown Abbey. 10 Mb/s DSL download speed.SD = 5:44 minutes to download.
B00CYQPM42,22,19,This 1:06 hour 720P HD video file consumed 1.24 GBs of space.Next I tried the SD, or lowest quality option and downloaded Episode 2. This took 5 minutes and 44 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,22,20,My media is stored there free of charge and supports large and various file formats.
B00CYQPM42,22,21,without memory expansion, USB support or HDMI ports.
B00CYQPM42,22,22,There is an option to purchase additional storage, (I believe it's about $25 a year with other limitations).
B00CYQPM42,22,23,Amazons cloud does store music up to a point, but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge.
B00CYQPM42,22,24,files, you may not find all the apps you want or need - at this time.
B00CYQPM42,23,0,WIFI Connectivity.
B00CYQPM42,23,1,Won't Connect to my Wireless Router.
B00CYQPM42,23,2,My other devices have never had an issue.
B00CYQPM42,23,3,wi-fi drops constantly.
B00CYQPM42,23,4,Thus, I ran into the very same connectivity issues that I had with my old Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,5,i got this particular model so i could have internet/ wifi anywhere.
B00CYQPM42,23,6,The wi-fi connection drops constantly for no apparent reason.
B00CYQPM42,23,7,It is hard and slow to connect to WiFI unlike my other Kindle.
B00CYQPM42,23,8,Next time i will take the ipad.
B00CYQPM42,23,9,It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day.
B00CYQPM42,23,10,Not Worth the Aggravation of the Connection Problems.
B00CYQPM42,23,11,I found it very easy to connect to the Wi-Fi in each hotel we stayed at.
B00CYQPM42,23,12,Whenever I would connect to Wifi the Kindle would shut down and reboot.
B00CYQPM42,23,13,If the connection issues were resolved, I would give this 5 stars.
B00CYQPM42,23,14,it constantly loses my wi-fi singnal (at least 2-3 times per day).
B00CYQPM42,23,15,Today, I was at Starbucks, where I tried connecting to the internet through their free WIFI service, but failed to connect.
B00CYQPM42,23,16,I have a slow internet connection, and only one option for a service provider.
B00CYQPM42,23,17,Some days it works fine but once it starts acting up, it will continuously drop connection every 2 - 10 seconds.
B00CYQPM42,23,18,Wireless connects well and the tablet streams videos without a hitch.
B00CYQPM42,23,19,I continuously have problems with my Kindle not hooking up to my wireless, which in turn makes it a pretty useless device.
B00CYQPM42,23,20,At the same time this is happening, I am sitting next to her using my Motorola Xoom which has a good strong (four bars), stable connection, so it is not a network problem, it is a device problem.
B00CYQPM42,23,21,You have to reset the device if you ever forget your password and you'll lose all your apps.
B00CYQPM42,23,22,It came with instructions as to how to connect to WiFi, so I got that going the first night.
B00CYQPM42,23,23,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,23,24,Had issues with the first Kindle Fire HDX 7" with the system shuting down every time I tried to connect to wifi.
B00CYQPM42,24,0,The only thing I don't like is the keyboard.
B00CYQPM42,24,1,For example, something like Surface touch cover.
B00CYQPM42,24,2,The keyboard appears when it is supposed to and is very responsive, just like the rest of the touch screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,3,Touch screen is more responsive.
B00CYQPM42,24,4,My only complaint about this product is that it's way too sensitive to touch.
B00CYQPM42,24,5,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,6,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,24,7,Now that I can actually use the screen I can see that the device isn't worth it.
B00CYQPM42,24,8,Will need to find a way to change the keyboard layout.
B00CYQPM42,24,9,So far not happy at all with a product that almost cost me $300.00 and has a HORRIBLE VERY OBVIOUS blue/purple line that goes alone the whole screen on both sides.
B00CYQPM42,24,10,The opening screen has ads, which I discovered I can pay to remove.
B00CYQPM42,24,11,Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app.
B00CYQPM42,24,12,It's really frustrating.
B00CYQPM42,24,13,They are small and fit comfortable in your hands, easy set up, easy screens to screens, everything is at your finger tips.
B00CYQPM42,24,14,I also have been noticing the screen flicker at times.
B00CYQPM42,24,15,Like HDX very much and wish a touch cover like keyboard case to make it more productive.
B00CYQPM42,24,16,I even showed my grown daughter the "offending" screen (saying nothing of the complaints) asking her if she saw anything, anything at all unusual or bothersome about the reading screen.
B00CYQPM42,24,17,The only other problem I have noticed is with the screen resolution.
B00CYQPM42,24,18,After using it for only a few minutes, the screen freezes.
B00CYQPM42,24,19,For one, they've tweaked the virtual keyboard a bit.
B00CYQPM42,24,20,I don't have time to read as much as I used to, so I thought having a Kindle would not help me find more time to read, so why buy one?
B00CYQPM42,24,21,I do suggest a stylus, case and screen protector (in my other reviews).
B00CYQPM42,24,22,This is a good product that was I expected to be because it has a better screen and more features than any other tablet.
B00CYQPM42,24,23,only two things i dislike: The Boot up time after you turn it off is slow, and the fact that i can't use Google Play.
B00CYQPM42,24,24,This review in not about the functionality of the kindle but the lack of information in the box.
B00CYQPM42,25,0,No more IPads for me.
B00CYQPM42,25,1,You get both great price, great screen and great performance that surpasses iPad mini.
B00CYQPM42,25,2,So it would have been obvious to just get the iPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,3,Galaxy tab, Nexus, iPad, iPad mini).
B00CYQPM42,25,4,Well, in this case apples to androids to kindles.
B00CYQPM42,25,5,Here's my problems with the device:- Apps are solely from the Amazon Kindle App store.
B00CYQPM42,25,6,I got this because my Android phone's screen was too small for reading and some gaming and note taking.
B00CYQPM42,25,7,Cheaper than an ipad mini with a better screen, this device is a no brainer.
B00CYQPM42,25,8,You can't do this from the Kindle app on other Android devices.
B00CYQPM42,25,9,It took some time getting used to from android and ipad but I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested.
B00CYQPM42,25,10,Disappointing after owning an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,11,Great buy for the value.
B00CYQPM42,25,12,First things first; the screen!
B00CYQPM42,25,13,This will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this next year.
B00CYQPM42,25,14,Tablet is my go-to device for all internet related search I do.I have the following and/or used the following before:1) iPad 12) iPad 23) iPad 44) iPad Mini5) Kindle Fire6) Kindle Fire HD7) Kindle Fire HD 8.98) Asus Transformer with Keyboard9) Nexus 7 First Gen10) iPad Air 16gb WifiAs you can see, I been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them.
B00CYQPM42,25,15,Otherwise this product is great!
B00CYQPM42,25,16,I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.
B00CYQPM42,25,17,Screen - Sharpest resolution I have ever seen on a screen this size.
B00CYQPM42,25,18,Although it's old tech now, one thing I love about Samsung products is they LAST.
B00CYQPM42,25,19,This thing is great!
B00CYQPM42,25,20,This is a great product.
B00CYQPM42,25,21,If you are not, then buy it anyway as you will save at least $100 over the nearest priced iPad.
B00CYQPM42,25,22,It is REALLY hard to quit apps.
B00CYQPM42,25,23,;)So, I'm happy with my Kindle but probably wouldn't be if I didn't have my Galaxy phone to get my android app fix.
B00CYQPM42,25,24,It's a simple thing to do on my iPad Mini.
B00CYQPM42,26,0,Micro USB Connector - Bite it Apple!
B00CYQPM42,26,1,For the first time ever - a plug adapter is included!
B00CYQPM42,26,2,Amazon is including a plug adapter so you can actually charge the device through a regular electrical outlet.
B00CYQPM42,26,3,The USB port sticks out at an odd angle, making it difficult to plug in.
B00CYQPM42,26,4,The placement of the USB port for charger is a great improvement.
B00CYQPM42,26,5,But charging is very fast using the included charger.
B00CYQPM42,26,6,It uses the same end as Samsung but when I use the Samsung charger it either doesn't charge at all, or takes a very long time to charge.
B00CYQPM42,26,7,Only thing that is really lacking is a USB port otherwise it is a great little product.
B00CYQPM42,26,8,Here are my biggest disappointments:* They took the HDMI port away.
B00CYQPM42,26,9,Except....when I took it to the beach and opened the cover, I didn't see a way to connect to the hotel's wi fi.
B00CYQPM42,26,10,The Lack of even a mini USB port.
B00CYQPM42,26,11,It's just very odd and makes charging annoying.2)
B00CYQPM42,26,12,My phone did and our laptop did but mind showed me a keyboard and asked for a pin????
B00CYQPM42,26,13,You have to connect it at an angle on the device (around 30 degrees).
B00CYQPM42,26,14,have noticed that plugging in both the head phone jack and the micro-USB port requires going in at a slight angle.
B00CYQPM42,26,15,You will not regret it since this device is designed to be taken everywhere.
B00CYQPM42,26,16,6 NOV 2013***After almost a month and a half, I find the micro-USB power port to remain a tight and secure fit.
B00CYQPM42,26,17,The bottom line is that this is not a repairable device.
B00CYQPM42,26,18,Instead of placing the USB port on the bottom of the HDX (like it is on the HD) it is placed at the top left side which helps when using the carrying case.
B00CYQPM42,26,19,I know Amazon wants everyone to use the device for their content, but not allowing one of the largest app stores on your Android device seems illogical.
B00CYQPM42,26,20,I like to plug my device into the HDMI ports of hotel TVs and watch my shows from the bigger screen.
B00CYQPM42,26,21,It's one of the most secure feeling connections I've felt for a micro-USB device.
B00CYQPM42,26,22,And, I got Temple Run Oz (finally) which was not compatible with the original Fire.There are some design features I don't like, such as the way the charger sticks in at an angle.
B00CYQPM42,26,23,This is rather disappointing as it can be a powerful productivity device with the right accessories attached.
B00CYQPM42,26,24,I am able to use 3rd-party app stores to upload missing apps and outdated ones on the Amazon App Store, but still!2) USB Connection Port - The connection port on the device can be a bit of a nuisance.
B00CYQPM42,27,0,She had me "update" the system.
B00CYQPM42,27,1,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,27,2,I bought this for my wife and have had it maybe month and everything stopped working can not even unlock screen when you reset it.
B00CYQPM42,27,3,only two things i dislike: The Boot up time after you turn it off is slow, and the fact that i can't use Google Play.
B00CYQPM42,27,4,Just hanged up with the CS and they assure that is a software feature, and that can be fixed with a software update.
B00CYQPM42,27,5,I would have given it 5 stars but some of the apps will flip upside down when I have the screen locked in one place.
B00CYQPM42,27,6,This is the second one that the freezing happens so I'm not sure if it's something mechanical or what the reason is for it freezing.
B00CYQPM42,27,7,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,27,8,The fact that you cannot customize anything is annoying beyond belief and there's and advertisement every time you turn it on or in lock it is ridiculous no I don't want to buy a dirt devil thank you.
B00CYQPM42,27,9,Great tab, but until the Flash issue is solved, not perfect.
B00CYQPM42,27,10,One of the first things I did in my settings was turn off letting things automatically detect where I am located.
B00CYQPM42,27,11,And the update fixed all the problems I had encountered.
B00CYQPM42,27,12,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,27,13,While trying to start Flick Soccer, the device locked up on me.
B00CYQPM42,27,14,This really is one of the top tablets in its class.Note: As others have noted, the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi.
B00CYQPM42,27,15,But there were a lot of glitches.
B00CYQPM42,27,16,Occasionally shuts off when I am in the middle of something.
B00CYQPM42,27,17,We almost always use our cellphones for taking pictures, so that wasn't really a big concern for us.I would also recommend NOT paying the $15 to remove the lock screen only advertisements.
B00CYQPM42,27,18,It's not a big deal, but surprising after forgetting for the first time.**UPDATE
B00CYQPM42,27,19,It's not a big deal, just annoying.
B00CYQPM42,27,20,You'll only see them from time to time on the screen lock when you first turn the HDX on.
B00CYQPM42,27,21,It disconnects from our network at random times, and at other times will not connect at all, sometimes for an entire day.
B00CYQPM42,27,22,Assuming an app doesn't have an option to exit the app, just use the back button on the main screen of the app.
B00CYQPM42,27,23,Good tablet overall but the thing is the appstore its has about 10x less than the apple apps in the appstore
B00CYQPM42,27,24,Unlike some others, I had no trouble with this operation, no glitches or crashes.
B00CYQPM42,28,0,I have contacted support about these problems.
B00CYQPM42,28,1,I am going to contact support again to see if they can help.
B00CYQPM42,28,2,I called customer service AGAIN and asked if I was eligible for a refund and they told me that because this was a replacement device I could not have a refund.
B00CYQPM42,28,3,I want to return it.
B00CYQPM42,28,4,poor support.
B00CYQPM42,28,5,It took a few days for a very supportive customer service chap from Ireland to sort out the problem.
B00CYQPM42,28,6,The device is 5 months old...After contacting Amazon Kindle support a fourth time, someone finally helped me.
B00CYQPM42,28,7,Asus customer support was straightforward enough and they paid for shipping to the warranty dept.
B00CYQPM42,28,8,Therefore, I am no longer receiving any more emails about this issue which means the problems are not fixed and now I don't know what to do about it.
B00CYQPM42,28,9,When I called customer service they were great (the reason that this go any stars) I received a replacement and I am having the same issues.
B00CYQPM42,28,10,i contacted customer service and it took them a week to send a canned email with instructions on how to load an email.
B00CYQPM42,28,11,If I had to do it again, I would not buy it and I want to send it back
B00CYQPM42,28,12,I'v spent uncounted hours on the computer trying to find solutions for problems with other products and many more hours on the phone for tech support.
B00CYQPM42,28,13,I've only had it a little over 3 weeks.
B00CYQPM42,28,14,I called customer care, they helped me quickly reset the device to factory settings and it seemed to have fixed it.
B00CYQPM42,28,15,I am very disappointed and am in conversation with tech support.
B00CYQPM42,28,16,I will be sending it back for a refund.
B00CYQPM42,28,17,I called Amazon customer service and within 5 minutes they had ordered my replacement.
B00CYQPM42,28,18,He did everything he could to help and then said he would have to contact the managers and he would keep me posted by email.
B00CYQPM42,28,19,Sorry, Amazon.
B00CYQPM42,28,20,She was on the phone for several hours( at least 3+ hours and 3 separate calls ) with tech support before they figured this out.
B00CYQPM42,28,21,Its a poorly developed product with poor customer service.
B00CYQPM42,28,22,I explained this to the tech advisors and they told me to send it back.
B00CYQPM42,28,23,He sent a few emails telling me he was working on the problem and the last email I received stated his superiors said I should update my kindle with the new update because it would fix my problems..
B00CYQPM42,28,24,Do not purchase as a gift or you will have a hard time getting warranty replacement.
B00CYQPM42,29,0,Not sure if you can change the screen rotation.
B00CYQPM42,29,1,Third, the touch screen is glitchier than my iPad.
B00CYQPM42,29,2,It's hard to scroll through screens without opening something about which you have no interest.
B00CYQPM42,29,3,I miss being able to click on the top of the screen to get to settings.
B00CYQPM42,29,4,In time, I'm sure they'll fix these issues with updates.With respect to the apps that are available for this tablet, you'll might be disappointed.
B00CYQPM42,29,5,Only on the lock screen, and if you have the screen turn off before locking the only time you see the ads is when you have to unlock the screen.
B00CYQPM42,29,6,They can even take control of your Kindle screen and press the buttons for you so you can see whatever it is they are trying to explain.
B00CYQPM42,29,7,It is okay, not as good as hyped.Pros:ResponsiveGreat pictureCons:FreezesCan't completely close applicationsSpeakers point backwards which is annoying since they are great, but you can't hear them and watch something at the same time.Overall:I am sending it back and getting a Windows Surface since there is more you can do with it.
B00CYQPM42,29,8,I have to hold the power button down for 15 seconds or more for it to shut off.
B00CYQPM42,29,9,But if it failed the first time like it did for me, you won't see it when swiping down for the settings on top of the screen.
B00CYQPM42,29,10,I'll revisit this later with more time.The screen is glossy.
B00CYQPM42,29,11,I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.
B00CYQPM42,29,12,Next time I'm buying an iPad.
B00CYQPM42,29,13,I found myself shutting it down and restarting frequently.
B00CYQPM42,29,14,This is the second one that the freezing happens so I'm not sure if it's something mechanical or what the reason is for it freezing.
B00CYQPM42,29,15,Now one can remove an item from the carousel but it still will show up on the bottom of the screen in the "home" section.
B00CYQPM42,29,16,Why not just have it vertical or horizontal?
B00CYQPM42,29,17,Screen resolution is night/day better than original.
B00CYQPM42,29,18,When using it, the screen will all of a sudden disappear.
B00CYQPM42,29,19,Would recommend buying a case for this and all kindles since they can be slippery at times.
B00CYQPM42,29,20,My only complaint about this product is that it's way too sensitive to touch.
B00CYQPM42,29,21,best thing to ever be able use in one hand besides a taser in dangerous situation.
B00CYQPM42,29,22,Fourth, it's not easy to switch between apps.
B00CYQPM42,29,23,Who pulls out a plug "diagonally" from a device, we usually pull vertically down, maybe side, maybe vertically up.
B00CYQPM42,29,24,I would have given it 5 stars but some of the apps will flip upside down when I have the screen locked in one place.
B007P4YAPK,0,0,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,0,1,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,0,2,Once again... yes the screen on this tablet is great, but yes there is a VISIBLE improvement on the New iPad.
B007P4YAPK,0,3,I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire.
B007P4YAPK,0,4,My sister has the New iPad and yes I can tell the difference in the screen.
B007P4YAPK,0,5,Not noticeable when it's on, but unmistakable when the screen is dark.Otherwise, it's beautiful, light, functional and zippy.
B007P4YAPK,0,6,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,0,7,The blue color is a really nice dark blue, you won't be disappointed, many features and very good speed.
B007P4YAPK,0,8,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,0,9,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,0,10,At first I was thinking I wouldn't be able to tell the difference... but I was wrong.This does not make me want to get the New iPad however, because I don't like the "Apple" way of doing things.
B007P4YAPK,0,11,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,0,12,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,0,13,The resolution is beautiful and the brightness is remarkable.
B007P4YAPK,0,14,I have poor eyesight, but I can clearly read the screen even with full sun shining on it.
B007P4YAPK,0,15,Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.
B007P4YAPK,0,16,Buy it now.UpdateI originally bought this for my wife, after spending some time using the tablet, I've decided to purchase another one for myself.
B007P4YAPK,0,17,HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.
B007P4YAPK,0,18,The SL101 screen has a more heavy-duty feel, but doesn't have a second battery.
B007P4YAPK,0,19,Needless to say the GPS was better as well.You can definitely notice a difference in the screen resolution, the TF300 is not as sharp on the colors.
B007P4YAPK,0,20,I've compared my tablet directly to a coworker's iPad 3, and actually prefer the black contrast better on the TF300.
B007P4YAPK,0,21,A few other times the screen wouldn't turn back on even though I'm pushing the power button multiple times.
B007P4YAPK,0,22,It feels good, is easy to hold, and the screen is very nice, if not as bright as the Prime.
B007P4YAPK,0,23,Good price.
B007P4YAPK,0,24,If you don't already have a mobile device with amazingly high resolution and vivid colors, then you probably won't have any problems with the Pad's screen at all.
B007P4YAPK,1,0,Another problem is app to app integration.
B007P4YAPK,1,1,it won`t download Adobe media player and some things need that to play on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,2,Great product only one issue, Adobe Flash says it is not supporting this version of android OS which makes viewing certain web pages not possible.
B007P4YAPK,1,3,Netflix and the music players work well, but what I really use it is for the following:1.
B007P4YAPK,1,4,Google apps works well, and it is easy with the keyboard to deal with email.8.
B007P4YAPK,1,5,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,1,6,Web browsing is quite fast (I use Dolphin browser), and once I updated Adobe Flash, flash within web pages works great.
B007P4YAPK,1,7,HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.
B007P4YAPK,1,8,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,1,9,If you have an android phone, this is the way to go - all my phone apps were added automatically to tablet.4.
B007P4YAPK,1,10,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,1,11,The only problem with iTunes is its lack of many different video formats which is annoying, Android has a awesome array of format it supports without the need to convert which I love.-
B007P4YAPK,1,12,It is a decent tablet for the price.The Tegra 3 processor is ok, not impressed by it.though.I bought this tablet for the purpose of have adobe flash player but have found out android 4.0 and up does not support flash player,so its not the tablets companies fault.It is strange most all video on the internet requires flash player,go figure.
B007P4YAPK,1,13,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,1,14,I won't keep going into detail about why I like android better but wicked4u2c on YouTube has made a 5 part mini-series about why android is better using ICS and the iPad.
B007P4YAPK,1,15,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,1,16,No noticeable difference in the games I do play, but then I haven't really gotten a game that is built for the Tegra 3 yet.
B007P4YAPK,1,17,I've only watched a couple of HD videos, but everything's pretty smooth.
B007P4YAPK,1,18,tablet is good.
B007P4YAPK,1,19,In my personal opinion I like this tablet and the only thing that is wrong with it is that there are not many apps that are made for android tablets yet.
B007P4YAPK,1,20,Although I won't complain too much about it because the speaker is better than that of the prime and is very clear even at the highest level.Display Quality- video quality seems fine,  I watched a lot of YouTube trailers in HD and even watched Sherlock Holmes games of shadows in 720p and Avatar in 1080p and so far video quality seems fine to me and the tablet did not even hiccup.
B007P4YAPK,1,21,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,1,22,I can freely add and remove media files without having to go through an application like iTunes, although to be fair I actually like the easiness and organization iTunes has and wish Android had a free and better program like iTunes.
B007P4YAPK,1,23,I went straight for swiftkey3 and works great with the TF300T.Native browser works great.Very little bloatware, thank you ASUS.If your looking for your first tablet you should know: Apps in the android line are NOT up to par with Apple apps, simple truth.
B007P4YAPK,1,24,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,2,0,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,2,1,Good price.
B007P4YAPK,2,2,This is a great tablet!
B007P4YAPK,2,3,Very  good camera.Cons:1.
B007P4YAPK,2,4,I would recommend this to anyone who wants a pretty high spec tablet but without the high end price.
B007P4YAPK,2,5,Awesome Tablet for the price!
B007P4YAPK,2,6,The price was good at the time but now it is even better of course.
B007P4YAPK,2,7,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,2,8,I would highly recommend if your going to game, get an iPad.
B007P4YAPK,2,9,Buy it now.UpdateI originally bought this for my wife, after spending some time using the tablet, I've decided to purchase another one for myself.
B007P4YAPK,2,10,Overall, for the price of this tablet, I don't think you can get any better!
B007P4YAPK,2,11,Good tablet for the time.
B007P4YAPK,2,12,I use it a lot, so if that's a measure of worth, it's pretty worth it!
B007P4YAPK,2,13,I spent a lot of time researching before buying this tablet, and it was very nearly exactly what I needed.
B007P4YAPK,2,14,Many people like your product and the price range.
B007P4YAPK,2,15,You can't beat the performance of this tablet for the price.
B007P4YAPK,2,16,I bought a ASUS t101 and loved it for the three weeks I had it.
B007P4YAPK,2,17,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,2,18,These are the 2 main issues I've had in the past week.Otherwise, I'm happy with this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,19,As long as you know what you're getting (which is old technology), and you are smart about the price you should pay for that technology, you will be happy with this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,2,20,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,2,21,Well it's been a week since I got this tablet and overall I'm happy with it, but not completely satisfied.
B007P4YAPK,2,22,I bought this tablet on launch day and have waited to review it.
B007P4YAPK,2,23,Anything else and I would highly recommend the TF300T.Update: After a 6 months, a couple of problems have surfaced.
B007P4YAPK,2,24,I will point out though, the older ipads now seem so old, and this tablet feel just as snappy as the day I bought it.
B007P4YAPK,3,0,Battery life is around 7 hours for almost constant use.
B007P4YAPK,3,1,Very good battery life; especially using the dock.5.
B007P4YAPK,3,2,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,3,3,nice for it's time.
B007P4YAPK,3,4,But like I said before, that is not needed because the battery is amply sufficient.
B007P4YAPK,3,5,Battery life is above average, usually lasting a day and a half with moderate use.
B007P4YAPK,3,6,so obviously by now there are much better models of this tablet .. but for its time it was quite a gem ... only reason i will take away a star ... is the keyboard ... i found that it causes the battery to drain out much faster than expected.
B007P4YAPK,3,7,toshiba tablets have swappable batteries thereby doubling there usage time with one xtra battery.
B007P4YAPK,3,8,Charging is relatively fast.
B007P4YAPK,3,9,I usually read for an hour or so each night when I go to bed and this tablet with its mobile dock only needs charged every four days or so.
B007P4YAPK,3,10,That's always  good thing!
B007P4YAPK,3,11,Battery life is still around 10 hours tablet and 15 hours with keyboard attached (battery in each) running 740p HD movies with wifi and blue tooth off.
B007P4YAPK,3,12,The plastic back could be a little more substantial.Battery performance is fair, about 2hrs to charge and about 8hrs on battery.
B007P4YAPK,3,13,I doubt I ever get advertised battery life but it last a lot longer than a laptop so I am pleased.
B007P4YAPK,3,14,Even just the additional battery life is a thing of beauty alone, as I now always run the device in performance mode (which helps to cut down on lagginess), and still get good battery life.
B007P4YAPK,3,15,Screen seems pretty robust.
B007P4YAPK,3,16,Good price.
B007P4YAPK,3,17,The price was good at the time but now it is even better of course.
B007P4YAPK,3,18,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,3,19,So when both screens are turned on the graphics power is pretty much the same.
B007P4YAPK,3,20,when the tablet is by itself .. it sleeps for a considerable time ... but when the tablet is plugged into the keyboard .. i find the battery drains even faster ... go figure
B007P4YAPK,3,21,I'm not a heavy user (I mainly use my tablet to play word games and do light web browsing and reading), so I find that I rarely have to charge my TF300, perhaps once every other day.
B007P4YAPK,3,22,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,3,23,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,3,24,Power button problem.
B007P4YAPK,4,0,Good enough but could be better!
B007P4YAPK,4,1,The design and build are both very good.
B007P4YAPK,4,2,Overall, for the price of this tablet, I don't think you can get any better!
B007P4YAPK,4,3,It feels good, is easy to hold, and the screen is very nice, if not as bright as the Prime.
B007P4YAPK,4,4,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,4,5,The design is also great.
B007P4YAPK,4,6,But all and all I like it its a good price.
B007P4YAPK,4,7,Very thin, and has a good grip feeling thanks to the textured back.
B007P4YAPK,4,8,Screen seems pretty robust.
B007P4YAPK,4,9,I do belive that this is a good tablet, I just think that I got one that is not built quite right.
B007P4YAPK,4,10,If anyone can actually tell the difference in speed, they are pretty good, because it is only 0.1MHz difference.
B007P4YAPK,4,11,A solid tablet, at an affortable price.
B007P4YAPK,4,12,Sound isn't the best (only one speaker), but it does get surprisingly loud for a little thing.Overall, so far I like the TF300 a LOT.
B007P4YAPK,4,13,Asus makes great products for their price point, and this one qualifies, with the exception of the join of the back and front.
B007P4YAPK,4,14,It feels light and thin for its size.
B007P4YAPK,4,15,To be honest the speaker sounds amazing but, having sound come from only one side kind of puts it out of balance for me.
B007P4YAPK,4,16,Screen looks great I don't know how much brighter the prime is.
B007P4YAPK,4,17,I've only watched a couple of HD videos, but everything's pretty smooth.
B007P4YAPK,4,18,If would still be better than nothing if you didn't have the transformer with you.
B007P4YAPK,4,19,I hear it is pretty good with Skype too, but I did not try that.
B007P4YAPK,4,20,So far, so good.
B007P4YAPK,4,21,Tighten down on the Quality Control ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,4,22,If you are in a commercial building with metal walls, it might not be very good.
B007P4YAPK,4,23,So the quick review for this product is it is a very solid tablet, that for the speed, memory, and screen is well worth the buy.
B007P4YAPK,4,24,As for speakers, it only has one, on the right (or bottom) side.
B007P4YAPK,5,0,Best tablet with one exception - SKYPE.
B007P4YAPK,5,1,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,5,2,I can't say how much I love this tablet it's fast quality device with one exception in that Skype video is the very bad!This is a software problem and so I am hopefull that it will be fixed.
B007P4YAPK,5,3,it takes excellent pictures: beach wise, whc is very sunny or even in dark places like a church and sunset pix are pretty good,even the rainbow and the clouds  look amazing; i have no problems w/ all my Kindle books....i just love it
B007P4YAPK,5,4,HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.
B007P4YAPK,5,5,While the screen is not super IPS and thus is a little bit hard to use in direct sunlight, the screen is more than bright enough for easy use in every other situation.
B007P4YAPK,5,6,Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.
B007P4YAPK,5,7,The design is also great.
B007P4YAPK,5,8,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,5,9,Pretty darn decent for the price.
B007P4YAPK,5,10,Only time I have ever seen that is when I intentionally push hard on the front or back.
B007P4YAPK,5,11,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,5,12,The camera is decent quality, the image is grainy and when zoomed in the image is very jagged/razor-like.
B007P4YAPK,5,13,In fact, the screen is downright gorgeous.
B007P4YAPK,5,14,Once again... yes the screen on this tablet is great, but yes there is a VISIBLE improvement on the New iPad.
B007P4YAPK,5,15,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,5,16,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,5,17,The price was good at the time but now it is even better of course.
B007P4YAPK,5,18,Overall, for the price of this tablet, I don't think you can get any better!
B007P4YAPK,5,19,nice for it's time.
B007P4YAPK,5,20,Awesome Tablet for the price!
B007P4YAPK,5,21,Asus makes great products for their price point, and this one qualifies, with the exception of the join of the back and front.
B007P4YAPK,5,22,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,5,23,I've only watched a couple of HD videos, but everything's pretty smooth.
B007P4YAPK,5,24,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,6,0,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,6,1,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,6,2,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,6,3,It's fast, smooth and very responsive, to my touch.
B007P4YAPK,6,4,It out performs most everything out there, has great graphics, and is well made.
B007P4YAPK,6,5,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,6,6,The screen is beautiful.
B007P4YAPK,6,7,Good price.
B007P4YAPK,6,8,Snappy responses and Tegra 3 video a plus.
B007P4YAPK,6,9,The resolution is beautiful and the brightness is remarkable.
B007P4YAPK,6,10,The best processor, decent memory, expandability, and at a price point that doesn't make my checkbook cry.Update for the new (4.3)
B007P4YAPK,6,11,The TF300 actually makes a pretty good little word processor.
B007P4YAPK,6,12,Awesome Tablet for the price!
B007P4YAPK,6,13,HD Video plays smoothly and clearly.
B007P4YAPK,6,14,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,6,15,So when both screens are turned on the graphics power is pretty much the same.
B007P4YAPK,6,16,The Tegra 3 processor is also very zippy - the only slowdowns I have had with the tablet have been internet connection speed related.
B007P4YAPK,6,17,It is very smooth in all 3 of the Asus processor modes.
B007P4YAPK,6,18,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,6,19,You can't beat the performance of this tablet for the price.
B007P4YAPK,6,20,This is not a digital camera replacement but I know that if I ever needed a camera that this tablet can take decent enough pictures for me.- the webcam is also okay,  does not work too well in low light conditions but is good in adequate light levelsProcessor (tegra 3)- I'm so glad that Asus went with a quad core processor this to me increases the longevity of the tablet and the dual core processors in other tablets would have only lasted so long.
B007P4YAPK,6,21,The design is also great.
B007P4YAPK,6,22,You can Google all the differences between this TF300 and the upcoming Infinity, screen resolution is just one of them.But overall, this TF300 is an excellent tablet, especially at this price point.
B007P4YAPK,6,23,Overall, for the price of this tablet, I don't think you can get any better!
B007P4YAPK,6,24,Tegra 3 is a beast when it comes to games.
B007P4YAPK,7,0,Still has full size  SDHC card slot on keyboard (yeah) and a Micro SDHC slot on the tablet  (big time yeah).
B007P4YAPK,7,1,Because you cant beat the price of 96GB pad (32 miniSD + 32gb SD in the Dock + 32 gb internal pad = 96GB), and the Ice Scream Sandwhich OS, and the "Netbook-Like" functionality, I have to give this atleast 4+ stars.Buy this, you will love it.
B007P4YAPK,7,2,Pros- Affordable Android tablet- Good overall performanceCons- Unique/proprietary charging requirements- Possible issues with screen popping outJust wanted to share my findings briefly.
B007P4YAPK,7,3,RAM is expandable via a microSD card which is also a big plus.
B007P4YAPK,7,4,Good enough but could be better!
B007P4YAPK,7,5,It has always been very responsive.I have the 32GB version (don't know if there is less).
B007P4YAPK,7,6,Love the small size...easy to carry around instead of my big  laptop.
B007P4YAPK,7,7,Good affordable Android table with a few drawbacks.
B007P4YAPK,7,8,It folds up perfectly, fits in a very small space, and is extremely easy to tote around.
B007P4YAPK,7,9,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,7,10,Secondly the keyboard has an sd slot which lets you add an additional 32 gb of memory thereby making it a 96 gb tablet beating out both the ipad and the toshibas.
B007P4YAPK,7,11,So far I have not bought an additional micro-memory chip to put in it.
B007P4YAPK,7,12,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,7,13,Having said that, I added a Poetic Hardback case which added a lot of stiffness/rigidity to the tablet.I'm very happy with the TF300, screen quality is good, has hdmi out, expandable storage via micro sd card slot, and you can add a USB adapter (which I bought) for external storage.
B007P4YAPK,7,14,The price was good at the time but now it is even better of course.
B007P4YAPK,7,15,I hate it when you get a new software update and you can't find how to do anything anymore.
B007P4YAPK,7,16,The screen could be better but its more than adequate, plenty of memory for the price with room to grow like a Micro SD slot and with the optional keyboard dock you get a full size SD slot plus you get a full size USB port for attaching external storage devices if you really are one of those that carries movie and music collections around.There's many positive things about this tablet but the one that impresses me the most is "optional" keyboard dock that turns this thing into a mini 10" notebook with a very usable keyboard and it closes and opens just like a notebook and it adds 5 extra hours of battery life.
B007P4YAPK,7,17,If anyone can actually tell the difference in speed, they are pretty good, because it is only 0.1MHz difference.
B007P4YAPK,7,18,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,7,19,great processing speed, beautiful screen quality, good battery length, and the dock makes typing much, much easier.
B007P4YAPK,7,20,Will give another update when I get the new one.Hope the new one is better, if not I will not be buying Asus anymore, even if the ratings are great.
B007P4YAPK,7,21,It feels good, is easy to hold, and the screen is very nice, if not as bright as the Prime.
B007P4YAPK,7,22,I would have liked to be able to use the keyboard from a distance, without it being connected to the tablet, which would have been nice considering the HDMI port.
B007P4YAPK,7,23,Feature set for the price is great.. Asus seems to be the top as far as updates go.
B007P4YAPK,7,24,Overall a purchase that should last me a few years.
B007P4YAPK,8,0,I can do just about all things I usually do on my computer but most important of all I can travel anywhere and have access to most of the apps that I used.
B007P4YAPK,8,1,Books - much easier to read kindle books on this than on laptop or even e-paper reader.
B007P4YAPK,8,2,With the exception of one application, this is a fantastic device to bring while traveling, and for most things more useful than a laptop.
B007P4YAPK,8,3,When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.
B007P4YAPK,8,4,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,8,5,Really love it for this, so I can take it anywhere, and connect to the internet.
B007P4YAPK,8,6,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,8,7,I am a casual user and use my TF300t to play games, surf  the web, read eBooks, organise my life, and listen to music.Pros:1.
B007P4YAPK,8,8,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,8,9,I don't want a $600 device.
B007P4YAPK,8,10,Wi-Fi has been great and it tethers absolutely great from my phone when I am not in Wi-Fi reach.
B007P4YAPK,8,11,I hope no more problems and I can read my news from my comfy chair on my T300.
B007P4YAPK,8,12,Great for reading without the keyboard, and perfect for email and editing with the keyboard.Highly recommended.
B007P4YAPK,8,13,I also do not want to install iTunes on any of my PCs.I decided to purchase a tablet because I do not like having to boot up or keep a PC running just to check my email, surf the web, watch a video, or read an ebook.
B007P4YAPK,8,14,If you have an android phone, this is the way to go - all my phone apps were added automatically to tablet.4.
B007P4YAPK,8,15,The wifi works very well, a little better than my laptop (my laptop is a few years old) in fact.
B007P4YAPK,8,16,Wifi reception is so good, it found more servers around my house than any other device I own and has had full strength connected to mine since I fired it up, regardless of where I use it in the house.I was able to easily conect to my main computer via DLNA and stream the music and videos I have stored there.
B007P4YAPK,8,17,It's one of the most handy devices for media consumption I've ever used.
B007P4YAPK,8,18,Both Wifi and GPS work great.
B007P4YAPK,8,19,A super useful device.
B007P4YAPK,8,20,Netflix and the music players work well, but what I really use it is for the following:1.
B007P4YAPK,8,21,Give me the simplicity and functionality of an Android device like this any day.
B007P4YAPK,8,22,I can't say how much I love this tablet it's fast quality device with one exception in that Skype video is the very bad!This is a software problem and so I am hopefull that it will be fixed.
B007P4YAPK,8,23,Adding notes is easy.
B007P4YAPK,8,24,So far, so good.
B007P4YAPK,9,0,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,9,1,It does better with touch.
B007P4YAPK,9,2,Now, the SL101's keyboard is OK.
B007P4YAPK,9,3,I love the keyboard dock.
B007P4YAPK,9,4,Great little touch pad.
B007P4YAPK,9,5,Also, when you have the screen at the best angle it can get (pretty much all the way back), when you touch the screen it has a tendency to tilt back because of the very fine balance the keyboard and the screen have.
B007P4YAPK,9,6,It feels very natural to reach from the keyboard to touching the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,7,It always feels like I am trying to contort my hand to touch it, reaching over the keyboard, especially when it comes to touching the lower part of the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,8,Coupled with the keyboard dock it makes a pretty good laptop replacement.
B007P4YAPK,9,9,Great for reading without the keyboard, and perfect for email and editing with the keyboard.Highly recommended.
B007P4YAPK,9,10,Touching the screen tips the balance.
B007P4YAPK,9,11,I originally got it without the keyboard, but then got the keyboard.
B007P4YAPK,9,12,Google apps works well, and it is easy with the keyboard to deal with email.8.
B007P4YAPK,9,13,The keyboard also adds quite a few other features which i find i like.
B007P4YAPK,9,14,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,9,15,The angle and position is perfect for promoting the use of your finger to touch the screen.
B007P4YAPK,9,16,When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.
B007P4YAPK,9,17,Love the small size...easy to carry around instead of my big  laptop.
B007P4YAPK,9,18,Now, the way I see it, I would have bought a case for the tablet regardless of whether the thing flexes easy.
B007P4YAPK,9,19,great processing speed, beautiful screen quality, good battery length, and the dock makes typing much, much easier.
B007P4YAPK,9,20,Came with keyboard that includes extra battery.
B007P4YAPK,9,21,This should have been a no-brainer, especially when one considers that Asus made such a functional keyboard dock in the first place.
B007P4YAPK,9,22,It is, of course, significantly smaller than a regular desktop or laptop keyboard, but if you're at all comfortable with typing on netbooks then you shouldn't have any problems using the keyboard dock.
B007P4YAPK,9,23,I'm writing this review on my 5+ year old laptop.
B007P4YAPK,9,24,Because the screen is either too sensitive or not sensitive enough, playing games or typing very frustrating at times.Overall, I am having fun with my tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,0,tablet is good.
B007P4YAPK,10,1,Otherwise I love it
B007P4YAPK,10,2,It feels light and thin for its size.
B007P4YAPK,10,3,Nice 10" Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,4,The design is nice and it feels pretty sturdy.
B007P4YAPK,10,5,Love the small size...easy to carry around instead of my big  laptop.
B007P4YAPK,10,6,Just got it last week - love it!
B007P4YAPK,10,7,The design and build are both very good.
B007P4YAPK,10,8,I enjoy the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,10,9,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,10,10,Fast delivery.
B007P4YAPK,10,11,And I love it even more.
B007P4YAPK,10,12,For the way I use it, it's perfect.
B007P4YAPK,10,13,versatile and lovely.
B007P4YAPK,10,14,It feels good, is easy to hold, and the screen is very nice, if not as bright as the Prime.
B007P4YAPK,10,15,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,10,16,I am satisfied with this product, it is just what I needed.
B007P4YAPK,10,17,I love it, but there is room for improvement.
B007P4YAPK,10,18,Although during the second day I did have a screen glitch where the screen would gitter up and down.
B007P4YAPK,10,19,Not noticeable when it's on, but unmistakable when the screen is dark.Otherwise, it's beautiful, light, functional and zippy.
B007P4YAPK,10,20,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,10,21,nice for it's time.
B007P4YAPK,10,22,Google apps works well, and it is easy with the keyboard to deal with email.8.
B007P4YAPK,10,23,Really don't get what the big deal was.
B007P4YAPK,10,24,I got mine yesterday and I do love it.
B007P4YAPK,11,0,Not necessary if you get the keyboard, however, as the keyboard has a full sized usb port built in.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Just found out that standard USB chargers (of any amperage) do not charge this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,11,1,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,11,2,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,11,3,I would have liked to be able to use the keyboard from a distance, without it being connected to the tablet, which would have been nice considering the HDMI port.
B007P4YAPK,11,4,Came with keyboard that includes extra battery.
B007P4YAPK,11,5,Using the provided transformer, the tablet and keyboard are recharged within a few hours.The keyboard has support for 1 USB port, which I did not try yet except to recharge my phone.
B007P4YAPK,11,6,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,11,7,I still prefer to be able to have additional power instead, but it would have been a nice feature to have bluetooth on the keyboard too.
B007P4YAPK,11,8,Now, the SL101's keyboard is OK.
B007P4YAPK,11,9,The USB connection to my PC allows me to read this tablet like a hard drive.
B007P4YAPK,11,10,I purchased the keyboard dock and a bluetooth mouse to accompany the TF300.
B007P4YAPK,11,11,Having said that, I added a Poetic Hardback case which added a lot of stiffness/rigidity to the tablet.I'm very happy with the TF300, screen quality is good, has hdmi out, expandable storage via micro sd card slot, and you can add a USB adapter (which I bought) for external storage.
B007P4YAPK,11,12,Also, the keyboards don't appear to be getting stocked anymore, so, if you're going to get one, get one soon.Also, if you get this tablet, this is a handy addition: ASUS USB Kit for Eee Pad Transformer TF101, TF101G, TF201 & TF300 Tablets  This is a dongle that plugs into the charging port and allows you to use USB devices (Hard Drive, thumb drive, keyboard, mouse, gaming pad) with the pad.
B007P4YAPK,11,13,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,11,14,Almost all other chargers use the USB standard 5 volts (including iPad or Nexus 7).
B007P4YAPK,11,15,The keyboard has keys that make it possible to use the tablet entirely without touching it, but unfortunately, the bluetooth button is only used to activate/deactivate the tablet's bluetooth.
B007P4YAPK,11,16,My friend prefers a standard mouse and can use his USB mouse no problem.
B007P4YAPK,11,17,The SL101 has a keyboard built into it and is marginally lighter than the TF300 with the keyboard attached.
B007P4YAPK,11,18,The screen could be better but its more than adequate, plenty of memory for the price with room to grow like a Micro SD slot and with the optional keyboard dock you get a full size SD slot plus you get a full size USB port for attaching external storage devices if you really are one of those that carries movie and music collections around.There's many positive things about this tablet but the one that impresses me the most is "optional" keyboard dock that turns this thing into a mini 10" notebook with a very usable keyboard and it closes and opens just like a notebook and it adds 5 extra hours of battery life.
B007P4YAPK,11,19,It also plugs into the keyboard to recharge it independently, or to recharge both it and the tablet when they are assembled together, all the while still using the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,11,20,I also love that I can take my 500GB USB hard disk and use it interchangeably on both my  Win7 64 bit machines and the ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,11,21,To be honest the iPad does not give you any hardware features that it should, the tf300 has micro-hdmi, micro-sd, and you can buy an usb kit for the transformer to attach ntfs hard drives or keyboards and mice.-
B007P4YAPK,11,22,The dock was a nice option.
B007P4YAPK,11,23,The TF300 when detached from the keyboard is very light.
B007P4YAPK,11,24,A friend of mine, pretty much sold on iStuff, said he wished he could have a keyboard that attached to his phone, because my keyboard also has its own battery, and as you use the tablet, it sacrifices itself in order to transfer all its power over to the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,12,0,At first I was thinking I wouldn't be able to tell the difference... but I was wrong.This does not make me want to get the New iPad however, because I don't like the "Apple" way of doing things.
B007P4YAPK,12,1,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,12,2,Interfaces just like my android phone.
B007P4YAPK,12,3,I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire.
B007P4YAPK,12,4,Great Android ICS Tablet.
B007P4YAPK,12,5,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,12,6,I know this review is about the Asus, but I want to say that I own 4 android tablet devices using various Android operating systems and user interfaces, and of those the best, easiest to use, most enjoyable combination is the one on the Amazon Fire.
B007P4YAPK,12,7,And I love it even more.
B007P4YAPK,12,8,For those who don't like the comparison to the iPad I'm sorry, the iPad IS the standard.
B007P4YAPK,12,9,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,12,10,Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0) is excellent.
B007P4YAPK,12,11,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,12,12,The same version my galaxy nexus is running.
B007P4YAPK,12,13,Will give another update when I get the new one.Hope the new one is better, if not I will not be buying Asus anymore, even if the ratings are great.
B007P4YAPK,12,14,The Android version of Sky Safari is identical to Apple version and works perfectly...my main reason for getting the ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,12,15,3/4/2013:  Just installed the Android 4.2 update to this thing and it rocks!
B007P4YAPK,12,16,Many of the features are linked in to the operating system, Android 4.0 or "ice cream sandwich" ICS, and is finally up to par with Apple OS.
B007P4YAPK,12,17,I've used an iPad before and have owned an iPhone since it was released.
B007P4YAPK,12,18,In my personal opinion I like this tablet and the only thing that is wrong with it is that there are not many apps that are made for android tablets yet.
B007P4YAPK,12,19,(UPDATE:  I can now say that, with the Android 4.2 update, I no longer worry about the lag.
B007P4YAPK,12,20,The only thing the iPad has better than the tf300 is the app store in my personal opinion, don't get me wrong the iPad is an awesome device and they only problem I had was for $499 they still only give 16gb which was not enough for meICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) vs iOS- So a thing about iOS is the closed environment of apple.
B007P4YAPK,12,21,Just a helpful tip for those that may have or buy one of these.***UPDATE***
B007P4YAPK,12,22,An I-Pad Competer.
B007P4YAPK,12,23,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,12,24,Once again... yes the screen on this tablet is great, but yes there is a VISIBLE improvement on the New iPad.
B007P4YAPK,13,0,The tablet is great and the service was great.
B007P4YAPK,13,1,Great product; even better customer service.
B007P4YAPK,13,2,Great Right?
B007P4YAPK,13,3,Everything was great, but....
B007P4YAPK,13,4,Okay so I just purchased and received my new Asus TF300(blue).
B007P4YAPK,13,5,I am satisfied with this product, it is just what I needed.
B007P4YAPK,13,6,ASUS review.
B007P4YAPK,13,7,Raised the review stars, because of my satified experience with the product.
B007P4YAPK,13,8,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,13,9,The have not provided me with anything.But what can I say, this is a great deal no matter how you look at it.
B007P4YAPK,13,10,Amazon's customer support, in my opinion, is absolutely amazing.
B007P4YAPK,13,11,This one said that the new tablet had been shipped with Saturday delivery, at no additional cost.
B007P4YAPK,13,12,The only issue I have is that the unit was an AT&T; device previously.
B007P4YAPK,13,13,Will give another update when I get the new one.Hope the new one is better, if not I will not be buying Asus anymore, even if the ratings are great.
B007P4YAPK,13,14,I purchased three of these tablets (ASUS TF300) from Amazon, and had them in-hand within a matter of a few days.
B007P4YAPK,13,15,But for a 32GB at $399 shipped (no tax payed, free shipping, from new egg)it's a no brainer.
B007P4YAPK,13,16,Just the experience of dealing with something that doesn't work the first time is very disappointing.
B007P4YAPK,13,17,I read all the reviews of other customers, and seen that some are having the same concens, if not more.
B007P4YAPK,13,18,One of the tablets turned out to be defective (I guess there have been some issues with displays), so I started the process for replacing it on Amazon's website.
B007P4YAPK,13,19,It has a socket and service for an LTE sim card.
B007P4YAPK,13,20,Well, turns out they didn't have to do that, as UPS was out the very next day delivering the new tablet.
B007P4YAPK,13,21,Taking a star away until I get the new one.Updated 2/17/13Well like I said, I would come back and give another review of the ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,13,22,So far, I am not seeing any defects in the h/w or s/w as described in other reviews.
B007P4YAPK,13,23,The return process of the defective tablet was equally simple.The tablet itself is great.
B007P4YAPK,13,24,I waited a few days to update this review, to see if any problems cropped up.
B007P4YAPK,14,0,This is a great tablet!
B007P4YAPK,14,1,The TF300 has great hardware.
B007P4YAPK,14,2,Now for the good.I love this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,14,3,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,14,4,Wish Asus would provide some Gamma tuning app for the screen.
B007P4YAPK,14,5,Good hardware, shady software.
B007P4YAPK,14,6,Might not have noticed but I also have access to Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 devices.
B007P4YAPK,14,7,It's just not as nice.
B007P4YAPK,14,8,Ultimately, the mouse on Android is not that great of an add-on.
B007P4YAPK,14,9,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,14,10,Unfortunately, the two main business software applications I planned to use require a Windows OS.
B007P4YAPK,14,11,ASUS Transformer TF300.
B007P4YAPK,14,12,We found a really nice app that would do a fairly good job replacing Quicken, but we didn't want to have to start all over from scratch.
B007P4YAPK,14,13,I love the weight, the dimensions, the hardware specs!Asus also just pushed Android 4.1.1
B007P4YAPK,14,14,Personally, the mouse to me is not a desirable feature for a device based on touching.Screen:  SL101 wins.
B007P4YAPK,14,15,For what the tablet is designed for, it excels.The tablet even functions very well as a laptop replacement.
B007P4YAPK,14,16,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,14,17,I prefer the flexibility of Android and I already have an Android phone so I decided to give this one a try.
B007P4YAPK,14,18,While it is not a perfect laptop replacement (scrolling using the mouse or mousepad in particular takes a bit of getting used to and is subpar compared to a laptop), using the keyboard and mouse with the pre-installed office suite is simple, easy, and impressively powerful too.
B007P4YAPK,14,19,However, with as flimsy as the TF300 feels, I don't feel like its a smart move to use this tablet without a good hardback case.Done with the bad.
B007P4YAPK,14,20,The TF300 actually makes a pretty good little word processor.
B007P4YAPK,14,21,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,14,22,ASUS Transformer TF300.
B007P4YAPK,14,23,In my personal opinion I like this tablet and the only thing that is wrong with it is that there are not many apps that are made for android tablets yet.
B007P4YAPK,14,24,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,15,0,There was also some light bleed on the edges of the screen, noticeable only when viewing dark images/video.
B007P4YAPK,15,1,When my screen is black, I notice some light bleed in a few of the corners, but it's nothing major and becomes unnoticeable when the screen is displaying colors other than black.
B007P4YAPK,15,2,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,15,3,The screen does have some minor light bleed that is noticeable when the background is black but nothing that I consider overly objectionable.
B007P4YAPK,15,4,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,15,5,It's really pretty minor, but I notice when holding it at the corners that the screen edge can be squeezed into the case a fraction of a millimeter.
B007P4YAPK,15,6,The screen resolution is very crisp indoors.
B007P4YAPK,15,7,Some reviewers have commented on the slight lack of color depth in the screen, but I was able to adjust it to my complete satisfaction.
B007P4YAPK,15,8,That being said, the Pad's screen is a bit underwhelming.
B007P4YAPK,15,9,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,15,10,The first had one had light bleed at the left and bottom of the panel, this one is not quite as bad.
B007P4YAPK,15,11,It took me a while to adjust to the lower resolution and more subdued colors.
B007P4YAPK,15,12,That's always  good thing!
B007P4YAPK,15,13,Good price.
B007P4YAPK,15,14,If you don't already have a mobile device with amazingly high resolution and vivid colors, then you probably won't have any problems with the Pad's screen at all.
B007P4YAPK,15,15,I'm noticing this almost on all edges.
B007P4YAPK,15,16,It holds up well against any other tablet I've worked with and better than some.
B007P4YAPK,15,17,Great all around except for screen colors.
B007P4YAPK,15,18,What bothers me more is that when the background is completely white I can see a slight yellowish gradient near the top.
B007P4YAPK,15,19,It will adjust the image in 4 different positions; portrait, portrait upside-down, landscape and landscape upside-down.
B007P4YAPK,15,20,Setting up the background images was a bit of a pain.
B007P4YAPK,15,21,For a 10" tablet, this is adequate, but pixels are noticeable when you're doing up-close reading or surfing.
B007P4YAPK,15,22,Not sure if most people would notice this but it bothers me; especially when I'm reading ebooks.
B007P4YAPK,15,23,The screen feels solid around the rest of the bezel perimeter.
B007P4YAPK,15,24,The Pad's colors aren't as vibrant and text/images aren't nearly as sharp.
B007P4YAPK,16,0,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,16,1,And I've had no problem finding apps on Google Play to fill all of my needs.
B007P4YAPK,16,2,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,16,3,Still waiting for the games to start showing up for it in the play storeAnother plus is the support and following this tablet is seeing at Xda forums already.
B007P4YAPK,16,4,Asus has just added some widgets and apps.
B007P4YAPK,16,5,A re-installation of the app usually fixes this problem.
B007P4YAPK,16,6,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,16,7,That's always  good thing!
B007P4YAPK,16,8,Great product only one issue, Adobe Flash says it is not supporting this version of android OS which makes viewing certain web pages not possible.
B007P4YAPK,16,9,With the exception of the browsers, I've never had problems with any of the apps that were actually optimized or specifically designed for tablets.
B007P4YAPK,16,10,Setting flash to not load by default seems to help.
B007P4YAPK,16,11,And I'm sure they'll address the web browser in the next update.
B007P4YAPK,16,12,I'd definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for an Android tablet.
B007P4YAPK,16,13,it won`t download Adobe media player and some things need that to play on the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,16,14,Web browsing is quite fast (I use Dolphin browser), and once I updated Adobe Flash, flash within web pages works great.
B007P4YAPK,16,15,For the browser, I switched to Chrome and have had no issues, just have to go to the stock browser for flash related content.
B007P4YAPK,16,16,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,16,17,I believe this is more an Android issue than a tablet issue and I hope it will be corrected with an update.Third, the tablet has 3 performance settings.
B007P4YAPK,16,18,Its also about as close to vanilla Android as it comes wth out being a nexus.
B007P4YAPK,16,19,Yes, you can use Google Docs (now merged into Google Drive, if you weren't yet aware), but that presents you with Google Docs' main shortcoming: you need to be connected to the internet in order to use it.
B007P4YAPK,16,20,I waited a few days to update this review, to see if any problems cropped up.
B007P4YAPK,16,21,Entered my email address and it downloaded all the apps I have on my phone automatically.
B007P4YAPK,16,22,Since the update, I've also noticed a better web experience.
B007P4YAPK,16,23,Give me the simplicity and functionality of an Android device like this any day.
B007P4YAPK,16,24,Also,  some Tegra 3 optimized games crash from time to time.
B007P4YAPK,17,0,It was very, VERY much worth the money.
B007P4YAPK,17,1,Did I save $200 by not buying the Apple I didn't want?
B007P4YAPK,17,2,If you want a 7" tablet that is the tablet to buy.
B007P4YAPK,17,3,Raised the review stars, because of my satified experience with the product.
B007P4YAPK,17,4,Overall, for the price of this tablet, I don't think you can get any better!
B007P4YAPK,17,5,But all and all I like it its a good price.
B007P4YAPK,17,6,That, however, is not a knock on this tablet, and for the money, I think this Asus is the 10" Android tablet to buy.
B007P4YAPK,17,7,Will give another update when I get the new one.Hope the new one is better, if not I will not be buying Asus anymore, even if the ratings are great.
B007P4YAPK,17,8,Many people like your product and the price range.
B007P4YAPK,17,9,I read all the reviews of other customers, and seen that some are having the same concens, if not more.
B007P4YAPK,17,10,Buy it now.UpdateI originally bought this for my wife, after spending some time using the tablet, I've decided to purchase another one for myself.
B007P4YAPK,17,11,Overall a purchase that should last me a few years.
B007P4YAPK,17,12,Just the experience of dealing with something that doesn't work the first time is very disappointing.
B007P4YAPK,17,13,I'm writing this review on my 5+ year old laptop.
B007P4YAPK,17,14,Asus makes great products for their price point, and this one qualifies, with the exception of the join of the back and front.
B007P4YAPK,17,15,I purchased this on the reviews on Amazon and from Cnet, and other sites that I have visited.
B007P4YAPK,17,16,Taking a star away until I get the new one.Updated 2/17/13Well like I said, I would come back and give another review of the ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,17,17,I liked the tablet since day one, but just got a bad one.
B007P4YAPK,17,18,Gave it a last run for the money but will exchange for a new one.
B007P4YAPK,17,19,Certainly not a fault of the tablet itself.Overall really a wonderful buy and a great product, especially with the dock.
B007P4YAPK,17,20,I purchased a 27" Asus monitor some time before the tablet and it worked OK so decided to give Asus tablet a try.
B007P4YAPK,17,21,I'm quite amazed with this product, indeed a great product for the price.
B007P4YAPK,17,22,It will make it look, good and protect it also.
B007P4YAPK,17,23,Great product; even better customer service.
B007P4YAPK,17,24,Okay so I just purchased and received my new Asus TF300(blue).
B007P4YAPK,18,0,I usually get 2 days out of it before I charge it.
B007P4YAPK,18,1,Power button problem.
B007P4YAPK,18,2,Battery life is around 7 hours for almost constant use.
B007P4YAPK,18,3,A few other times the screen wouldn't turn back on even though I'm pushing the power button multiple times.
B007P4YAPK,18,4,The battery life is about average for a tablet.
B007P4YAPK,18,5,Turned on the Asus this weeked and came on real slow, then when everything came up, I seen that it stated that I was charging at 82%.
B007P4YAPK,18,6,The battery life is very impressive also.My only gripe with this is the screen.
B007P4YAPK,18,7,Also using the keyboard allows me to leave it plugged in and charging while i am using it without worrying about crimping the power cord or yanking it out of the wall socket.
B007P4YAPK,18,8,I liked the tablet since day one, but just got a bad one.
B007P4YAPK,18,9,I will play with it more in a few days to see if anything changes with it.
B007P4YAPK,18,10,It plays all my movies, it plays all my games, it's light, portable, and the battery life is great.
B007P4YAPK,18,11,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,18,12,I do wish there was a deep sleep mode, so that when the screen is turned off it would shut the system down.
B007P4YAPK,18,13,hummm!!  Changed the setting for timing out but it still just does what it wants.
B007P4YAPK,18,14,That is a flaw as far as I am concerned, because if the tablet screen times out and turns off, you lose USB power.
B007P4YAPK,18,15,But you will still receive notifications and stay connected to wifi once screen is off.
B007P4YAPK,18,16,It won't work for power or data with any cable extention.
B007P4YAPK,18,17,A user commented about the extension USB issue and rightly informed me that it has to be USB 3.0, I was using a 2.0 cable.I use the tablet every day and it has become a necessary part of life.
B007P4YAPK,18,18,I've decided to just leave it on the higher setting and sufffer the battery drain.Fourth, for some reason, you cannot use a usb extension cable.
B007P4YAPK,18,19,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,18,20,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,18,21,They give you a screen cleaner and you will use it quite a bit, every few days the screen needs a good wipe as the finger prints start to become very visible.
B007P4YAPK,18,22,Battery life is above average, usually lasting a day and a half with moderate use.
B007P4YAPK,18,23,This is dissapointing as I'd like to sit on the couch and charge at the same time, but the stock cable is too short.I still believe it's a great tablet and will only get better with software updates, but right now it suffers from glitchy, slow apps and OS.
B007P4YAPK,18,24,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,19,0,As for speakers, it only has one, on the right (or bottom) side.
B007P4YAPK,19,1,This means that watching a movie or playing a game in landscape (as they should be watched/played) meant that you only got sound out of one side, which doesn't sound like a big problem but it actually is really annoying really quickly considering that tablet speakers tend to be tinny sounding and aurally grating.
B007P4YAPK,19,2,It has surprisingly loud audio, but it lacks stereo output (either because there's just one speaker, or, if there are two speakers, they're too close together).
B007P4YAPK,19,3,Imagine someone talking loudly into one ear, and you'll know what it was like to listen to this speaker at any useable volume.
B007P4YAPK,19,4,That being said, the Pad's screen is a bit underwhelming.
B007P4YAPK,19,5,I wish there were speakers on both, or even three sides like some competitors have, but they sound clear and are loud enough for me.
B007P4YAPK,19,6,If I want louder I plug in headphones or connect some via bluetooth.Now on to the bad.
B007P4YAPK,19,7,Another awkward thing they did with the build was put the mono speaker to the right when tablet is positioned in landscape mode.
B007P4YAPK,19,8,When listening to audio/video in landscape mode it feels awkward because my right ear gets a higher volume than my left, but it isn't that big of a problem when in portrait mode.
B007P4YAPK,19,9,Its located on the top if your holding it in landscape mode.
B007P4YAPK,19,10,The build quality (or maybe the internal design) is not what I would call "bulletproof".
B007P4YAPK,19,11,However, the TF300t speaker was particularly irritating because it was on the side of the tablet when held in landscape.
B007P4YAPK,19,12,It still retained that swirled finish, which looked very nice and was practical too, since it provided a better grip.The single external speaker was pitiful as most tablet speakers are.
B007P4YAPK,19,13,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,19,14,The front facing camera is clearly designed to be used in landscape mode.
B007P4YAPK,19,15,That is a flaw as far as I am concerned, because if the tablet screen times out and turns off, you lose USB power.
B007P4YAPK,19,16,Good tablet for the time.
B007P4YAPK,19,17,If it ever freezes which is usually caused by an app I just wait a few seconds and everything goes back to normal.Camera/Webcam- Both the camera and webcam are decent for this tablet; I was not expecting them to be head turning so no complaints here.-
B007P4YAPK,19,18,You will not notice the plastic bending unless you actually look it.
B007P4YAPK,19,19,When I push on the screen near the left bezel I can feel it flex.
B007P4YAPK,19,20,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,19,21,Tighten down on the Quality Control ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,19,22,I hear it is pretty good with Skype too, but I did not try that.
B007P4YAPK,19,23,Although during the second day I did have a screen glitch where the screen would gitter up and down.
B007P4YAPK,19,24,When my screen is black, I notice some light bleed in a few of the corners, but it's nothing major and becomes unnoticeable when the screen is displaying colors other than black.
B007P4YAPK,20,0,The camera is decent quality, the image is grainy and when zoomed in the image is very jagged/razor-like.
B007P4YAPK,20,1,There is something about the camera in the TF201 with indoor light.
B007P4YAPK,20,2,Now the reason I took a star away.
B007P4YAPK,20,3,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,20,4,This includes the front-facing camera as well.
B007P4YAPK,20,5,If it ever freezes which is usually caused by an app I just wait a few seconds and everything goes back to normal.Camera/Webcam- Both the camera and webcam are decent for this tablet; I was not expecting them to be head turning so no complaints here.-
B007P4YAPK,20,6,The other thing to consider is video conferencing.
B007P4YAPK,20,7,Not just because of Megapixels, but the image is less grainy.
B007P4YAPK,20,8,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,20,9,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,20,10,The same version my galaxy nexus is running.
B007P4YAPK,20,11,But all and all I like it its a good price.
B007P4YAPK,20,12,Feature set for the price is great.. Asus seems to be the top as far as updates go.
B007P4YAPK,20,13,I can't say how much I love this tablet it's fast quality device with one exception in that Skype video is the very bad!This is a software problem and so I am hopefull that it will be fixed.
B007P4YAPK,20,14,Will give another update when I get the new one.Hope the new one is better, if not I will not be buying Asus anymore, even if the ratings are great.
B007P4YAPK,20,15,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,20,16,I can't tell you how annoying lack of updates was with my phone.
B007P4YAPK,20,17,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,20,18,I hear it is pretty good with Skype too, but I did not try that.
B007P4YAPK,20,19,Petty darn good.
B007P4YAPK,20,20,I would recommend this to anyone who wants a pretty high spec tablet but without the high end price.
B007P4YAPK,20,21,Also, when you have the screen at the best angle it can get (pretty much all the way back), when you touch the screen it has a tendency to tilt back because of the very fine balance the keyboard and the screen have.
B007P4YAPK,20,22,I have the USB adapter but its not great.
B007P4YAPK,20,23,If you have an android phone, this is the way to go - all my phone apps were added automatically to tablet.4.
B007P4YAPK,20,24,Give me the simplicity and functionality of an Android device like this any day.
B007P4YAPK,21,0,Is it too much to ask to be able to load pages at a speed greater than dialup?
B007P4YAPK,21,1,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,21,2,Apps, graphics, so what?
B007P4YAPK,21,3,Good tablet for the time.
B007P4YAPK,21,4,Also,  some Tegra 3 optimized games crash from time to time.
B007P4YAPK,21,5,Just slow.
B007P4YAPK,21,6,This thing is fast, enough ram, do not have to constantly kill background apps.
B007P4YAPK,21,7,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,21,8,Devices began coming out shortly after this tablet that had 1.5GB and 2GB of RAM, and the extra memory makes a huge difference in Android, probably more so than a faster processor would.All in all, it was a good tablet at the time it came out, and is still a decent tablet.
B007P4YAPK,21,9,It out performs most everything out there, has great graphics, and is well made.
B007P4YAPK,21,10,Apps that are optimized for tablets really shine on this device thanks to ICS and the quad-core processor.
B007P4YAPK,21,11,That's always  good thing!
B007P4YAPK,21,12,If anyone can actually tell the difference in speed, they are pretty good, because it is only 0.1MHz difference.
B007P4YAPK,21,13,As anyone with a smartphone knows, touchscreens are great but they are also not without their issues.
B007P4YAPK,21,14,Reloading and reconfiguring a bit of a pain but download speeds now as I would wish them to be.
B007P4YAPK,21,15,I had a Viewsonic G Tablet that I'd cracked and loaded a decent OS.
B007P4YAPK,21,16,Screen seems pretty robust.
B007P4YAPK,21,17,It is a dual CPU computer (therefore providing 4 core).
B007P4YAPK,21,18,These apps generally ran in the background and could not be killed/uninstalled.
B007P4YAPK,21,19,I hate its speed.
B007P4YAPK,21,20,I don't think performance is an issue.
B007P4YAPK,21,21,This was a common problem for this model, and in general, is a common problem with IPS screens.The biggest drawback to this tablet is the 1GB of RAM.
B007P4YAPK,21,22,It's pretty much like the TF201, except that the CPU is slightly slower.
B007P4YAPK,21,23,With the exception of the browsers, I've never had problems with any of the apps that were actually optimized or specifically designed for tablets.
B007P4YAPK,21,24,I can't wait for this thing to crap out so I can get something decent.
B007P4YAPK,22,0,It has a socket and service for an LTE sim card.
B007P4YAPK,22,1,The memory is 32gb, which is more then enough for most people.
B007P4YAPK,22,2,It treats SD cards like you're only swapping a bit of data and taking it out.
B007P4YAPK,22,3,Secondly the keyboard has an sd slot which lets you add an additional 32 gb of memory thereby making it a 96 gb tablet beating out both the ipad and the toshibas.
B007P4YAPK,22,4,RAM is expandable via a microSD card which is also a big plus.
B007P4YAPK,22,5,The only issue I have is that the unit was an AT&T; device previously.
B007P4YAPK,22,6,And I've had no problem finding apps on Google Play to fill all of my needs.
B007P4YAPK,22,7,The prime does come in a 64 gig model but, i find that a 32 works just fine for me especially if you dont mind taking the time to swap out micro sd cards thus making the memory a moot point and i didnt feel like waiting on the toshiba(i like instant gratification).
B007P4YAPK,22,8,One annoyance: plugging in a SD card, and having it treat it like a forever-external drive that it's compelled to constantly have a notification of it's foreign-ness.
B007P4YAPK,22,9,Having said that, I added a Poetic Hardback case which added a lot of stiffness/rigidity to the tablet.I'm very happy with the TF300, screen quality is good, has hdmi out, expandable storage via micro sd card slot, and you can add a USB adapter (which I bought) for external storage.
B007P4YAPK,22,10,So the quick review for this product is it is a very solid tablet, that for the speed, memory, and screen is well worth the buy.
B007P4YAPK,22,11,I can't tell you how annoying lack of updates was with my phone.
B007P4YAPK,22,12,Some minor downsides include no flash on the back camera (taking pictures can become difficult because of this), a battery life that only lasted between 6-8 hrs, a badly placed speaker that gets muffled if the table is on its back, and no expandable memory.
B007P4YAPK,22,13,It doesn't care that you put it in there because you wanted more space for the tablet alone!
B007P4YAPK,22,14,I really wanted a tablet with a USB port so I could transfer photos in the field but no models so equipped were/are available at the time with an IPS screen (another one of my requirements).
B007P4YAPK,22,15,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,22,16,The tablet is great and the service was great.
B007P4YAPK,22,17,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,22,18,Now my tablet has trouble recognizing me.
B007P4YAPK,22,19,I can do just about all things I usually do on my computer but most important of all I can travel anywhere and have access to most of the apps that I used.
B007P4YAPK,22,20,Another problem is app to app integration.
B007P4YAPK,22,21,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,22,22,toshiba tablets have swappable batteries thereby doubling there usage time with one xtra battery.
B007P4YAPK,22,23,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,22,24,Great product; even better customer service.
B007P4YAPK,23,0,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,23,1,My only complaint with it is that its wireless doesn't seem to make as good of a connection as it should.
B007P4YAPK,23,2,I have a pretty strong wireless signal in my bedroom but this tablet seems to often drop the signal.
B007P4YAPK,23,3,But you will still receive notifications and stay connected to wifi once screen is off.
B007P4YAPK,23,4,Give me the simplicity and functionality of an Android device like this any day.
B007P4YAPK,23,5,I don't want a $600 device.
B007P4YAPK,23,6,Right now I am having problems with my tablet staying on, and the browser closing on me, and when I shut it down it seem to be back on.
B007P4YAPK,23,7,And 2- even though the network is connected while sleeping (there's actually a setting for this), upon waking you have to wait for any updates to install before you can really use it for anything.Update 12\19 2013; I'm downgrading the network performance to poor/unacceptable.
B007P4YAPK,23,8,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,23,9,I believe this is more an Android issue than a tablet issue and I hope it will be corrected with an update.Third, the tablet has 3 performance settings.
B007P4YAPK,23,10,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,23,11,hummm!!  Changed the setting for timing out but it still just does what it wants.
B007P4YAPK,23,12,A re-installation of the app usually fixes this problem.
B007P4YAPK,23,13,So far, there's nothing I've tried to do with it that's slowed it down.I did notice two glitches; the browser shut down a couple of times for no reason and had a hard time coming back up.
B007P4YAPK,23,14,Since the update, I've also noticed a better web experience.
B007P4YAPK,23,15,Wifi reception is so good, it found more servers around my house than any other device I own and has had full strength connected to mine since I fired it up, regardless of where I use it in the house.I was able to easily conect to my main computer via DLNA and stream the music and videos I have stored there.
B007P4YAPK,23,16,And I'm sure they'll address the web browser in the next update.
B007P4YAPK,23,17,It also has a bit of a problem surfing the net.
B007P4YAPK,23,18,Sometimes,  for no apparent reason, the browser will close by it self.
B007P4YAPK,23,19,Wi-Fi has been great and it tethers absolutely great from my phone when I am not in Wi-Fi reach.
B007P4YAPK,23,20,I've tested the connection and its all in the Asus.
B007P4YAPK,23,21,The WiFi is very strong and fast but like other reviewers, I get the "wait" or " disconnect" message regularly.4.
B007P4YAPK,23,22,I have also read in the reviews that many people have had the wait/close message many times while browsing and my case is no different, I would suggest using another browser like dolphin which is a lot more stable and less likely to crash, my dolphin has yet to crash.
B007P4YAPK,23,23,The only issue I have is that the unit was an AT&T; device previously.
B007P4YAPK,23,24,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,24,0,The responsiveness of the touch screen is not consistent.
B007P4YAPK,24,1,Kinda wierd when you want to go and touch the screen and it just closes before you get there.
B007P4YAPK,24,2,This thing gets laggy and misses touch presses too much.
B007P4YAPK,24,3,It really detracts from the experience (but it also registers when your hand is close, even when you don't touch it).
B007P4YAPK,24,4,Because the screen is either too sensitive or not sensitive enough, playing games or typing very frustrating at times.Overall, I am having fun with my tablet.
B007P4YAPK,24,5,The screen is beautiful.
B007P4YAPK,24,6,Also, the on screen ASUS keyboard is very glitchy.
B007P4YAPK,24,7,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,24,8,A few other times the screen wouldn't turn back on even though I'm pushing the power button multiple times.
B007P4YAPK,24,9,The second time's the charm!
B007P4YAPK,24,10,Either way the problems stated above for me don't mean too much to me because I always buy screen protectors.-
B007P4YAPK,24,11,One of the tiny shift keys does give me some grief from time to time, but it's really to be expected.Also it's convenient the trackpad has an on/off button, because when you're typing, you will inevitably run your palm across the pad and create all kinds of annoying issues at random times.
B007P4YAPK,24,12,However, after several weeks of usage I did notice a few things that made me wish for better design.First I do get a little lag every now and then, even a little freezing of apps.
B007P4YAPK,24,13,The keyboard is very responsive, the mouse trackpad works great (though sometimes it takes it a moment to pop up when it comes back from sleep), there are lots of helpful hotkeys, etc, etc.
B007P4YAPK,24,14,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,24,15,The stock keyboard on this tablet is TERRIBLE.
B007P4YAPK,24,16,At first I was concerned, as when I took it out and started it up for the first time, it hung at the language choice screen.
B007P4YAPK,24,17,The keyboard works great now.
B007P4YAPK,24,18,I get the option to close the browser/app or wait for it to respond.
B007P4YAPK,24,19,Usually, right after selecting the "wait" option, it becomes responsive again.
B007P4YAPK,24,20,hummm!!  Changed the setting for timing out but it still just does what it wants.
B007P4YAPK,24,21,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,24,22,Why is this my big problem?
B007P4YAPK,24,23,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,24,24,Becase when you lift open the pad from the closed "laptop" position I notice I sometimes pull away the plastic edge near the camera.
B007P4YAPK,25,0,At first I was thinking I wouldn't be able to tell the difference... but I was wrong.This does not make me want to get the New iPad however, because I don't like the "Apple" way of doing things.
B007P4YAPK,25,1,I don't want a $600 device.
B007P4YAPK,25,2,Give me the simplicity and functionality of an Android device like this any day.
B007P4YAPK,25,3,My colleagues with ipads do not use the keyboard since it does not support the screen well.
B007P4YAPK,25,4,As I previously stated, the screen is great regardless of what anyone else says.
B007P4YAPK,25,5,It could be certain apps i'm using, but who knows, afterall that's the whole point of these android tablets...APPS.
B007P4YAPK,25,6,The Apple OS is more polished than Android, but Android has come very far since it's humble beginnings and I believe it will surpass IOS very soon.
B007P4YAPK,25,7,I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire.
B007P4YAPK,25,8,Great Device for the Price, Hopefully Android Appstore gets better Tablet Support.
B007P4YAPK,25,9,price nd user friendliness.
B007P4YAPK,25,10,I've used an iPad before and have owned an iPhone since it was released.
B007P4YAPK,25,11,Good tablet for the time.
B007P4YAPK,25,12,Sure, it's not a "retina" display but it's great for video and good enough for reading.
B007P4YAPK,25,13,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,25,14,I've encountered exactly the same thing on my wife's iPad 3 too many times to count.The screen is very good and in fact better than it needs to be in order to be both functional and pleasurable to use.
B007P4YAPK,25,15,Great product; even better customer service.
B007P4YAPK,25,16,One last note,  a lot of the reviewers seem to not like the plastic case or at least have some issue with it.
B007P4YAPK,25,17,The price was good at the time but now it is even better of course.
B007P4YAPK,25,18,When traveling one gets all the newspapers on the tablet where they are easier to read than on laptop - NY Times, Le Monde, etc.  New Yorker has poor support, and works better with an ipad unfortunately.9.
B007P4YAPK,25,19,Will give another update when I get the new one.Hope the new one is better, if not I will not be buying Asus anymore, even if the ratings are great.
B007P4YAPK,25,20,My sister has the New iPad and yes I can tell the difference in the screen.
B007P4YAPK,25,21,Software-wise, ASUS tends to give you more liberty than others, like motorola, samsung, apple, etc. You'll get OTA updates a lot, enough to make you feel like you're not being left out.
B007P4YAPK,25,22,The wifi works very well, a little better than my laptop (my laptop is a few years old) in fact.
B007P4YAPK,25,23,I believe this is more an Android issue than a tablet issue and I hope it will be corrected with an update.Third, the tablet has 3 performance settings.
B007P4YAPK,25,24,Once again... yes the screen on this tablet is great, but yes there is a VISIBLE improvement on the New iPad.
B007P4YAPK,26,0,I don't like the propriety plug, and the no USB port.
B007P4YAPK,26,1,What I found out then is that if the tablet is off (not powered off, just the screen off), the keyboard does not provide power to the USB.
B007P4YAPK,26,2,It now has a micro HDMI connection on the keyboard instead of the mini HDMI. on the t101.
B007P4YAPK,26,3,I never tried to see if the old keyboard would work on the new one...the new one is a bit different...has one USB port instead of two (negative).
B007P4YAPK,26,4,That cable that comes with it can get power from an ordinary USB port, but the amount of power would be so low it would take the whole day to recharge from a standard USB.
B007P4YAPK,26,5,I have the USB adapter but its not great.
B007P4YAPK,26,6,Also, you pretty much have to use the tablet upside-down when the adapter or the power cord is connected.
B007P4YAPK,26,7,Do micro-USBs not provide enough power?
B007P4YAPK,26,8,In the end, I decided that the USB adapter and this tablet would suffice.
B007P4YAPK,26,9,I would have liked to be able to use the keyboard from a distance, without it being connected to the tablet, which would have been nice considering the HDMI port.
B007P4YAPK,26,10,However, if you feel you have to do it, that cable plugs into the tablet, to recharge as you use it.
B007P4YAPK,26,11,Also at the base of the charge port is the same issue with the skinny piece of thin plastic covering.
B007P4YAPK,26,12,It's speedy and responsive and everything works.Just a couple of thoughts:1) I'm not a fan of the proprietary charging cable AND USB/Wall plug.
B007P4YAPK,26,13,Not necessary if you get the keyboard, however, as the keyboard has a full sized usb port built in.IMPORTANT NOTE:  Just found out that standard USB chargers (of any amperage) do not charge this tablet!
B007P4YAPK,26,14,I still prefer to be able to have additional power instead, but it would have been a nice feature to have bluetooth on the keyboard too.
B007P4YAPK,26,15,Almost all other chargers use the USB standard 5 volts (including iPad or Nexus 7).
B007P4YAPK,26,16,It also plugs into the keyboard to recharge it independently, or to recharge both it and the tablet when they are assembled together, all the while still using the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,26,17,Tablet locks to keyboard so no danger of it falling out like another brand I tried.Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5....wish it had a user replaceable battery...same issue with Ipads.
B007P4YAPK,26,18,The USB connection to my PC allows me to read this tablet like a hard drive.
B007P4YAPK,26,19,Using the provided transformer, the tablet and keyboard are recharged within a few hours.The keyboard has support for 1 USB port, which I did not try yet except to recharge my phone.
B007P4YAPK,26,20,The USB adapter works but I would have much preferred a cable because it becomes a rather long moment arm hanging off of a delicate connector when it is in place.
B007P4YAPK,26,21,The keyboard has keys that make it possible to use the tablet entirely without touching it, but unfortunately, the bluetooth button is only used to activate/deactivate the tablet's bluetooth.
B007P4YAPK,26,22,This tablet requires the ASUS-only 15 volt adapter in the wall to charge.
B007P4YAPK,26,23,If I look into the microSD port I can see the opening change shape when it's flexing.
B007P4YAPK,26,24,I also love that I can take my 500GB USB hard disk and use it interchangeably on both my  Win7 64 bit machines and the ASUS.
B007P4YAPK,27,0,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,27,1,If your tablet didn't update automatically (mine didn't) do so manually under Settings/About Tablet/System Firmware Update.
B007P4YAPK,27,2,Although during the second day I did have a screen glitch where the screen would gitter up and down.
B007P4YAPK,27,3,Booted perfectly, did a firmware update, and I was off.
B007P4YAPK,27,4,The first thing I tried is the GPS.
B007P4YAPK,27,5,They recommended a factory reset followed by a cold boot.
B007P4YAPK,27,6,Fortunately, this problem can be solved by software updates.
B007P4YAPK,27,7,If anyone knows how to put this tablet into diagnostic mode let me know so I can figure out if this is a hardware or software issue.I'll try to update this review as I log more time with the unit.
B007P4YAPK,27,8,Another issue plaguing the tablet is certain game apps not loading or crashing randomly.
B007P4YAPK,27,9,First of all, I would like to mention that this firmware update fixes the FLICKER issue that some of us have experienced.
B007P4YAPK,27,10,The only issue I have is that the unit was an AT&T; device previously.
B007P4YAPK,27,11,I hate it when you get a new software update and you can't find how to do anything anymore.
B007P4YAPK,27,12,The second time's the charm!
B007P4YAPK,27,13,Not a concern, at least for me.I dinged the TF300 a star because of the start up issues, and occasionally an app stops responding properly.
B007P4YAPK,27,14,There is,  however, one persistent issue that drives me mad.
B007P4YAPK,27,15,A re-installation of the app usually fixes this problem.
B007P4YAPK,27,16,I'll make sure to follow up with ASUS about this.Update (5/24/12)ASUS released an update for the TF300 on May 10th 2012.
B007P4YAPK,27,17,Both Wifi and GPS work great.
B007P4YAPK,27,18,Unfortunately, in the real world, things tend to work differently.
B007P4YAPK,27,19,To those that do have crashes and reboots I would suggest upgrading the firmware or trading it in for another one and definitely give the tf300 another chance.-
B007P4YAPK,27,20,I did as they recommended and the tablet did in fact become more stable.
B007P4YAPK,27,21,It wasn't the hardware but the software that was disappointing.
B007P4YAPK,27,22,Great Right?
B007P4YAPK,27,23,Everything was great, but....
B007P4YAPK,27,24,I don't think performance is an issue.
B007P4YAPK,28,0,That call had great, helpful service.
B007P4YAPK,28,1,This is the second asus tablet I received from Amazon.
B007P4YAPK,28,2,I called Google and they verified the serial number and called ASUS with me on the line.
B007P4YAPK,28,3,i waited until the T 300(as i call it), came out.
B007P4YAPK,28,4,I received email from ASUS with RMA form.
B007P4YAPK,28,5,I've updated the rating from 2 stars to four due to the great repair service Asus has provided me with.Only thing I didn't like is that I had to pay for sending the tablet, and also I would liked to know what was the problem that they solved, I mean a brief description of the repairs done to it.But anyway, that is ok.
B007P4YAPK,28,6,Just a helpful tip for those that may have or buy one of these.***UPDATE***
B007P4YAPK,28,7,I did it:)UPDATE (5/14/12)I received a reply from ASUS concerning my tablet's issues.
B007P4YAPK,28,8,Now, I've used Swiftkey on three other phones AND the Nexus 7, and had no problems with it.
B007P4YAPK,28,9,I couldn't catch his name because the line was so scratchy (on every call to ASUS!).
B007P4YAPK,28,10,He demanded a serial number for my Nexus before he could "help" me, when I read it to him, he replied, "that's not a serial number" and refused to help me.
B007P4YAPK,28,11,These are the 2 main issues I've had in the past week.Otherwise, I'm happy with this tablet.
B007P4YAPK,28,12,We can ALL help get these and other issues fixed faster by letting ASUS know.
B007P4YAPK,28,13,It gets stuck and tablet randomly shut itself off and reboots.I'm sending right now 8/28/2012 a request for RMA to Asus Customer Center.I'll be updating the outcome of this request.---
B007P4YAPK,28,14,I had such high hopes.UPDATE: ASUS customer service suggested my Android OS was corrupted (or I had problems with my WLAN - could rule that out as other devices work perfectly well).
B007P4YAPK,28,15,Told me to go back to the store I bought it from.
B007P4YAPK,28,16,I'll be keeping my TF300 because I'm hopeful that these issues will be patched and, once they are, I'll be one very happy consumer.P.S. Would you like to see your problems fixed?
B007P4YAPK,28,17,I had had a froyo tablet that had no such issues.
B007P4YAPK,28,18,Will give another update when I get the new one.Hope the new one is better, if not I will not be buying Asus anymore, even if the ratings are great.
B007P4YAPK,28,19,I found a solution that seemed to help a bit:  Completely factory wipe the machine 3 times and start over.
B007P4YAPK,28,20,Great product; even better customer service.
B007P4YAPK,28,21,o ---Update #2: Asus received the tablet on September 07, 2012 and I received a notification that tablet was delivered back on September 11, 2012.They fedex'd my ASUS TF300 and I finally got it back on Friday September 14th, 2012.So far everything is working perfect, they seam to have fixed the issue.
B007P4YAPK,28,22,Power button problem.
B007P4YAPK,28,23,I've been using this tablet for about five weeks now.
B007P4YAPK,28,24,Not exactly the most user-friendly thing to do out of the box.
B007P4YAPK,29,0,A few other times the screen wouldn't turn back on even though I'm pushing the power button multiple times.
B007P4YAPK,29,1,The screen on this tablet is great, but not the best.
B007P4YAPK,29,2,It would finally come on but it would show the welcome screen and boot up as if I did a restart, but obviously I didn't.
B007P4YAPK,29,3,Although during the second day I did have a screen glitch where the screen would gitter up and down.
B007P4YAPK,29,4,Either way the problems stated above for me don't mean too much to me because I always buy screen protectors.-
B007P4YAPK,29,5,They give you a screen cleaner and you will use it quite a bit, every few days the screen needs a good wipe as the finger prints start to become very visible.
B007P4YAPK,29,6,A quick reset took care of that and I have had no other problems until the 5th day where I got a random restart from an app freezing.
B007P4YAPK,29,7,The browser crashing from time toi time is one of the few problems with the tablet.
B007P4YAPK,29,8,It is a finger print magnet.
B007P4YAPK,29,9,The glass they used does not feel slick when sliding my finger across it like in the iPad 3. Also it is a fingerprint magnet which can get annoying.
B007P4YAPK,29,10,So when both screens are turned on the graphics power is pretty much the same.
B007P4YAPK,29,11,The combination of a touch screen and a "real" keyboard and mouse is a very awesome experience.The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it does have it's minor software glitches and the screen could have been better but all the pros overcome the cons very quickly and I would not change it for anything else at the moment.
B007P4YAPK,29,12,The reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because there have been a few glitches where apps will randomly close on its own.
B007P4YAPK,29,13,They did change the task bar out with a custom one.
B007P4YAPK,29,14,I have not compared it with other tablets but as far as I can tell this screen is good.-
B007P4YAPK,29,15,But you can even switch back to the default one in the setting.
B007P4YAPK,29,16,And I'll like it even more when the custom gone hit.
B007P4YAPK,29,17,It's really pretty minor, but I notice when holding it at the corners that the screen edge can be squeezed into the case a fraction of a millimeter.
B007P4YAPK,29,18,The only major problem I had for the tablet build was the fact that they decided not to use gorilla glass and went with hardened glass instead.
B007P4YAPK,29,19,Another awkward thing they did with the build was put the mono speaker to the right when tablet is positioned in landscape mode.
B007P4YAPK,29,20,Kinda wierd when you want to go and touch the screen and it just closes before you get there.
B007P4YAPK,29,21,Setting flash to not load by default seems to help.
B007P4YAPK,29,22,Great product only one issue, Adobe Flash says it is not supporting this version of android OS which makes viewing certain web pages not possible.
B007P4YAPK,29,23,However, after several weeks of usage I did notice a few things that made me wish for better design.First I do get a little lag every now and then, even a little freezing of apps.
B007P4YAPK,29,24,Also, when you have the screen at the best angle it can get (pretty much all the way back), when you touch the screen it has a tendency to tilt back because of the very fine balance the keyboard and the screen have.
