4869,1,1,"i purchased this afunta android tablet from the weize company in hong kong  which was my first mistake.i didn t realize that it was coming from hong kong until it was to late.it took a month and 6 days before i received it.that in itself disturb me  but again my fault.it was delivered in the time they specified but i would have ordered from a us base company had i been paying attention.the tablet is not the tablet i ordered  afunta just and android tablet.i want you to know this is my second review on this product.this review comes after two weeks of use.i am upset about it not being what i ordered.the tablet even though it s not the one i ordered works fine the only issue with it is the battery life and to me that s a big issue because you can t get through anything without having to charge it up.it has a nice bright screen which i turned down the brightness looking for more battery time.it s not happening.it surfs good and it s not slow at all downloads apps well connects to internet well.the charger that came with this tablet blew when taking out of plug socket.i found another around the house.my biggest issue is the battery life and sending me wrong tablet same processor and all but i wanted the looks as well.this afunta has a better look than the regular android tablet.i have learn from this experience.i will always make sure that what i purchase comes from a us base company.when you purchase something who wants to wait a month and 6 days before you get it.oh after i place my ordered i guess being the last one left at the time they switch over to svp tablet.",-1,1,16,0.198015,0.038706
