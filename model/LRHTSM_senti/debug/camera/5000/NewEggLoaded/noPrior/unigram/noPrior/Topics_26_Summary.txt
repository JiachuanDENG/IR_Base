From there, the Shoot Mode is accessed.What took a bit longer to find was where the controls are for the shutter and the aperture on manual mode.	-4.812

I purchased a 3-d party (Wasabi) battery pack (two NP-FW50 batteries, one Wasabi AC charger, one car charger converter for Wasabi AC charger, European converter) which works well with my NEX-5N.	-4.785
So I must buy the over-priced $79 Sony battery instead of a $20 replacement or spare.Is this a great camera?	-4.841
