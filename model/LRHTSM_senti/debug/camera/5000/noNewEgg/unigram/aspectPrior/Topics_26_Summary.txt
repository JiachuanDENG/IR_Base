(Of course in shutter priority I can set 1/125s shutter but then in good light it will stop down the lens instead of reducing the shutter speed.	-4.284
I've tried adjusting shutter speed, ISO, etc and still didn't have much luck.	-4.336
Most cameras have to use slow shutter speeds indoors in ambient light, because they just can't control noise and smear at ISO 800 and above.	-4.696

No built in viewfinder - you can buy one for $250 extra but I don't want to spend $250 on a viewfinder - a viewfinder and an extra lens take this camera up to 7N territory in cost which has a lot more than just the viewfinder.	-5.201

This one still has a 'minor' clicking sound when you shake it gently, but luckily the sound does not get copied onto video while recording unless you jerk around like crazy (but then this defeats the purpose of shooting a video :/).	-3.877
