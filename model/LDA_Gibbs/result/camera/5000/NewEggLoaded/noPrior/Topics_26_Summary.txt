Pictures Effects and other Manual Settings are under Brightness/Colors...I though those are for LCD Screen setting.	-5.229
Bounce flash even in portrait-oriented shots were surprisingly good (note, there's no swivel).	-5.283
Instead, it takes amazing low light pictures (even in a mostly dark room) in auto mode.	-5.477

I reviewed this camera to the Nikon 1 J1 and ultimately went with this camera instead.	-5.196
I own the canon elph 300hs and the nikon d3100 and this by far beats both.	-5.290

The camera makes using manual focus lenses a breeze using it's manual assist, and focus peaking settings.	-4.586
Focus Peaking has occasionally fooled me into thinking I have my subject in focus when I really just have a few elements within the focal plane.	-4.838
