In shutter priority mode, it allows you to select shutter speed.	-5.176
Every time I hand the camera to someone else, they press the video button instead of the shutter button.*	-5.280
However, because the camera must apply the correction upon pressing the button to take the photo, trying to do burst shots does no justice.	-5.488

The camera makes using manual focus lenses a breeze using it's manual assist, and focus peaking settings.	-4.887
I have the 18-55mm and 55-210mm lenses.PROS* Sony's Focus Peaking feature makes manual focus really easy for manual first-timers like me.	-5.185
