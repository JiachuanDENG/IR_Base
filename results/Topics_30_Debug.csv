6419,1,1,"i reviewed and bought the nexus 7  but then spent more time looking into the latest tablets and found another new tablet at amazon reseller tabletsprint called the novo 7 flame   which is a tablet less known in the united states   but overall offers a much better and more complete product compared to the latest nexus 7  kindle fire hd  and nook tablets    based on both user experience and looking at the major features of each of these products.tabletsprint seems to be the only us reseller right now of this new tablet.the maker   ainol electronics is actually an award winner for  best tablet of the year  2012 at the industry annual consumer electronics trade show  ces  held each january in las vegas   they won for the first novo 7 series model  which is a more basic model than the latest in the novo 7 series.the novo 7 fire   flame has a dual core processor that is fast   making web browsing quick  and so is using apps like a trial version of the new ms office suite for android that microsoft officially releases next month   as well as using processing intense programs such as 3d games   which work well with no lag time   based on some of the popular titles i tested out.another great thing is the novo 7 offers two high quality camera s   with a 2 mega pixel front webcam   it s hard to believe all four other major tablets out there skimp out on this feature   nexus 7   kindle fire hd  the new nook hd only have a 1.2 mp front camera   and apple is amazingly the worst with the ipad only having a .30",-1,0,2,0.341747,0.117630

6419,1,3,"hdmi is also great for the videos and photos i took with the tablet at a recent family gathering   being able to right away show some of the highlights on a big screen tv using the hdmi connection.the nexus 7 and new nook tablets don t even have hdmi  and the new kindle hd lists hdmi as a major selling point  but it is   half hdmi  with only 720p  not the standard 1080p hd    so the lesser picture quality is noticeable on a large screen tv and doesn t look nearly as good.when it comes to enough storage space for your files  the big three again limit you since they want you to use their online storage sites to make more money and therefore don t provide the flexibility that a micro sd storage slot provides   most people don t always have online web access  so this can be real difficult at times   the novo 7 flame has a micro sd port that takes up to 32gb micro sd storage cards   if your not familiar with that  they are file storage cards about the size of a dime   much more convenient to put your stuff on.the novo 7 is also built to last   it s the only tablet made with a thin metal exterior   which really can come in handle on the occasion when you accidently drop it   all the other devices are plastic   much more prone to damage.the novo 7 flame has most of the other major features as the nexus 7  kindle fire hd and new nook hd have  matching the nexus 7 and kindle fire hd with a high resolution 1280 x  800 ips backlit screen with wide 180 degree view  along with 16gb memory  wifi and bluetooth  and scratch resistant corning glass.another thing that sets the novo 7 apart is an option for 3g wireless service through many cell phone carriers as well as ethernet high speed cable connection    nexus 7  kindle fire hd and the new nook    7  tablets don t offer 3g   and the novo 7 also makes it easy to get internet through bluetooth from your cell phone as well.",-1,0,14,0.072380,0.024613
