But if you are working with it alone you will see that it is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.The camera is by far one of the weakest things in the tablet.	-4.612
Both front and back have decent image quality and so far the video taken on the rear facing camera looks great.	-4.652
I then realized this happens mostly for apps that use the front facing camera.	-4.783

This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card.	-4.278
The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.	-4.365
While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.-	-4.506
