Make sure to get a 32gig micro SD card, to expand the memory.	-4.368
Also, with their mini-sd drive (I bought the SD 64 gb card) you can put music on there if you didn't want to use Kies.	-4.841
Another great feature is that even though this device comes with 32 GB internal memory, I can insert a 64 GB card.	-4.845

I am now looking at getting a keyboard for it because using the on screen keyboard is really inefficient for tyling more than about one sentence.	-4.458
And well, after trying several apps, I must say that best for writing are: Quill, Write and Papyrus.	-4.487
I use it more for reading, but I love the pen and being able to write instead of type.	-4.548

3.5mm headphone jack is on the top of the tablet.	-5.081
I am not expert on sound system, so all I cared was whether I can hear sound loud enough.	-5.099
speakers can get loud which isn't bad but when you turn the tablet from widescreen to tall screen (as I call it) I just think the tablet looks a bit weird especially since the speakers will be top and bottom and slightly to the right or left.	-5.334

I wanted front and back cameras.	-4.039
According to the app developer, the app is incompatible with the tablet because the tablet does NOT have an "autofocus" rear facing camera.	-4.899
But if you are working with it alone you will see that it is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.The camera is by far one of the weakest things in the tablet.	-4.909

I will, however, note that the utter lack of external ports is disappointing.	-4.588
When I plug in a USB external hard drive to the tablet, the tablet tells me that the USB device requires too much power to operate (stick with the thumb drives, or AC adapter powered external HDDs).	-4.723
