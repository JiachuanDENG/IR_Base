6450,1,1,"i reviewed and bought the nexus 7  but then spent more time looking into the latest tablets and found another new tablet at amazon reseller tabletsprint called the novo 7 flame   which is a tablet less known in the united states   but overall offers a much better and more complete product compared to the latest nexus 7  kindle fire hd  and nook tablets    based on both user experience and looking at the major features of each of these products.tabletsprint seems to be the only us reseller right now of this new tablet.the maker   ainol electronics is actually an award winner for  best tablet of the year  2012 at the industry annual consumer electronics trade show  ces  held each january in las vegas   they won for the first novo 7 series model  which is a more basic model than the latest in the novo 7 series.the novo 7 fire   flame has a dual core processor that is fast   making web browsing quick  and so is using apps like a trial version of the new ms office suite for android that microsoft officially releases next month   as well as using processing intense programs such as 3d games   which work well with no lag time   based on some of the popular titles i tested out.another great thing is the novo 7 offers two high quality camera s   with a 2 mega pixel front webcam   it s hard to believe all four other major tablets out there skimp out on this feature   nexus 7   kindle fire hd  the new nook hd only have a 1.2 mp front camera   and apple is amazingly the worst with the ipad only having a .30",-1,1,25,0.327308,0.113920
